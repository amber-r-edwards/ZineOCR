WOMEN AND NONVIOLENCE

The Women and Nonviolence group in the  
Portland Area is going in a number of exciting  
directions. Women are working on another non  
violence workshop/training session, outreach,  
concrete program proposal and creating a col  
lection of resource materials.

A group is working on assertiveness training  
weekly in informal sessions (call 235 8954 for  
time and place).

Some women are working on program pro  
posals for the AFSC community dealing with  
women in transition, childcare and family devel  
opment.

Elizabeth Stuart, staff, is collecting materials  
on women in the military and any contributions  
energy or material-wise are welcome. For more  
info call 235 8954.

WOMEN’S RAP GROUPS

The YWCA Women’s Resource Center will  
make an effort to put women interested in forming  
Consciousness Raising groups in touch with  
one another. If you would like to join a group or  
attend a meeting to learn more about CR groups,  
please call the YWCA, 223 6281, ext. 49.

A member of the Women’s Resource Center  
Committee who has had two years experience in  
rap groups will help to organize the groups.

Most Consciousness Raising groups are small  
discussion groups (5 to 12 people) which meet  
weekly in members’ homes. Informal discussion  
can start off an evening or topics for meetings  
may be chosen by the group in advance.

Although each new group will have the respon-  

sibility of determining its direction, some possi-  
ble goals for groups are:

1) to exchange ideas and feelings freely  
and in the process to develop a special warm rap-  
port among group members;

2) to make us more aware of the social and  
economic pressures working to keep us in tradi-  

tional female roles (wives, mothers, nurses, teach-  

ers, librarians, etc.);  
3) to give one another strength to resist  

these pressures and to find satisfying alternatives.

Join us on February 19, 7:30 pm in the WRC  
area, main floor of the YWCA, 1111 S.W. Tenth  
Avenue, Portland.

WOMEN EMPLOYED Chery! A. Renton

The need for women to learn more about their  
career opportunities, job inequities or merely to  
learn more about general issues important to  
working women, has prompted the formation of  
WE—Women Employed. It is not intended to be  
a formal organization with officers and an agen-  
da, but an informal group of women who will  
meet for lunch with other women to discuss their  
common interests and concerns. In addition to  
these open meetings, we have informational pro-  
grams during the lunch hour at Equitable Sav-  
ings & Loan, 1300 S.W. Sixth, with speakers who  
discuss issues considered useful for working wo-  
men.

WE's first meeting in September, 1974, intro-  
duced WE to the downtown women. Our Octo-  
ber topic was “How Civil Rights Law Applies to  
Women” with Pat Haggin, Technical Assistance  
Coordinator, Oregon Civil Rights Division. In  
November, Jane Edwards, a Portland attorney,  
spoke to WE about “Legal Aspects of Sex Dis-  
crimination”. WE’s next meeting will be Feb-  
ruary 19 with Gretchen Kafoury as our speaker.  
Ms. Kafoury will be speaking on issues before  
the 1975 Oregon Legislature concerning women.

WE’s future intentions are to continue the  
monthly noon-time meetings with speakers, as  
well as, setting up three or four forums during  
the year to be held in the evening. These forums  
will be set up for the purpose of in-depth dis-  
cussion on problems facing women in today’s  
society.

WE is not intended to be an aggressive or mili-  
tant operation, but it is specifically supportive  
and fact-finding. WE stands for equal pay,  
equal opportunity and respect! Women need sup-  
port in their efforts to gain economic and social  
skills, and WE hopes to assist in this effort.

Any woman interested in learning more about  
WE is invited to attend our meeting to be held  
February 19 at Equitable Savings & Loan, 1300  
S.W. Sixth, noon to 1:00 pm or call Chery!  
Renton, 243 1880.
