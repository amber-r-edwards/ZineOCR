the right of citizens to determine what is best  
for their own communities. The people in the  
neighborhoods of District 8 must participate in  
determining the future of their own communities.  
The residents of the Northwest are doing this  
through their own Northwest Comprehensive  
Plan.  

a revised state income tax structure to eliminate  
favoritism and loopholes. Vera supports a grad-  
uated and progressive income tax, based on ability  
to pay. Present personal and corporate tax looph-  
oles must be closed in order to provide a more  
just and equitable system of taxation.  

100% state support of public schools. The sys-  
tem of local property taxes hurts the schools and  
the taxpayers. Vera favors a progressive state  
property tax to take the burden off low, middle,  
and fixed income property owners and renters.  

improved health care, housing, and community  
services for the elderly. District 8, with the high-  
est concentration of elderly citizens in the state,  
desperately needs such facilities as a multi-service  
center, neighborhood clinics, and special recrea-  
tion programs aimed at ending the isolation of  
our older citizens.

mass transportation. Vera favors using these

With just over a week left before the May 23  
Oregon primary, there is more need than ever be-  
fore for Oregon women to get behind candidates  
for public office who have been speaking to the  
issues that concern us. One of these candidates is  
a very exceptional person running for the Oregon  
Democratic nomination for President of the  
United States. This unique campaign was begun  
by Oregonians, and has had the most visible candi-  
date. Patsy Mink has visited Oregon on seven

THE CHANGING WOMAN  
WISHES TO BESTOW UPON  
STEVE ERICKSON  

Mrs. Vera Katz brings to her first candidacy a  
background of active participation in community  
programs. As chairman of the Citizens’ Task  
Force which established Portland's alcoholic de-  
toxification center, Mrs. Katz was also instru-  
mental in the passage of new legislation which re-  
defines alcoholism as a disease rather than a  
crime.  

A citizen's lobbyist for DEMOFORUM and  
chairman of the Oregon Kennedy Action Corps,  
she engineered vital migrant farmworker legis-  
lation during the 1971 session of the Oregon Le-  
gislature.  

In recognition of these achievements, she  
received the 1970 Sertoma Service to Mankind  
Award.  

Vera Katz, 38, is married, the mother of a 9-  
year-old son, Jesse, and holds a Master’s Degree  
in Sociology. She has lived in the Northwest sec-  
tion of Portland for 8 years. She resides at  
1274 N.W. 25th Avenue.  

PATSY MINK, CANDIDATE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT, SAID TODAY THAT ALL  

CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAR SHOULD WRITE OR WIRE THEIR CONGRESS PEOPLE. A VOTE ON THE DRINAN BILL WILL OCCUR WITHIN  

the cigar-of-the-month Award for his excellent  
feature story on junior rose festival princesses in  
the Oregonian special section. That was really  
telling it like it is instead of the mumbo-jumbo  
the Rose Festival witch doctors usually put out  
to lure their victims into the tryouts. We wish  
for more truth-in-news features about sex explo-  
itation and discrimination of women from our  

establishment dailies but maybe you just better  
subscribe to The Changing Woman, rather than  
live in hope and die in despair!  

Mr. Erickson, you can claim the cigar of your  

Patsy Mink will be addressing the Mock Demo-  
cratic Convention at the Memorial Coliseum on  
Friday, May 19, at 10:00 a.m.  

It is hoped there will be other appearances in  
the Portland area before May 23rd so watch your  
paper or call the headquarters.  

THE NEXT TEN DAYS IN THE HOUSE AS A RESULT OF THE TWO-THIRDS VOTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS ON APRIL 18TH, FORCING  
THE BILL OUT OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE WITHIN 30 DAYS... THIS BILL WILL CUT OFF ALL FUNDS FOR THE CONTINUA-  

TION OF THE WAR AND ORDER TOTAL WITHDRAWAL OF OUR TROOPS FROM INDOCHINA,
