MAY MEETING OF EAST CENTRAL DEMOCRATIC  

WOMEN  

The annual Fund-raising Luncheon of East  
Central Democratic Women took place according  
to tradition at the Carnation Dairy dining room,  
the first Tuesday in May.  

President Eleanor Tomlinson opened the after-  
lunch program. Helen Turnquist, program chair-  

man, invited candidates in the audience to say a  

few words.  

These, or their wives who spoke for them, were  
Gretchen Kafoury, wife of Steve running as State  
Representative from District 13; Bill Jeffery, also  
of District 13; Gracie Hansen of District 18; Diane,  
wife of Jim Shank of District 16; Mary Klonski,  
candidate for the position of National Committee  
Woman; and Bob McKee for District Attorney.  

Helen Turnquist then introduced head table  
speakers: Beulah Hand, unopposed candidate for  
Secretary of State and the first woman to run for  
this office; candidates for State Treasurer,  
National Committee-woman Alice Corbett and  
Jeanne Dost; for the position of Attorney General,  
Betty Browne, and the wife of Joe Smith, Betty.  

Following these speakers were representatives  
for two U.S. Presidential Candidates: Gretchen  
Kafoury for Patsy Mink and Blaine Whipple for  
George McGovern.  

Leaflets were passed out to tables explaining  
candidates’ positions on various issues. Door  
prizes were given by Carnation Dairy and Grandma  
Cookie Company.  

Meetings of E.C.D.W. are recessed until  
September.

---Member Oregon Consumer League

I believe in the repeal of all laws that restrict  
what a person can do with his or her own body.  

I also believe in the freedom to pursue the life  
style chosen by the individual.  

I advocate for the restoration of all civil rights to  
those held in our Penal system.  

President Nixon should be impeached for his  
most recent aggression against the people of  
Southeast Asia. The war must be ended.  

Equal rights for all people, under the law, are  
a must for the cause of human dignity. Sex, race,  
age, religion, etc., must not be discriminated  
against.  

Oregon needs better enforcement of existing  
laws relating to pollution. Industries which have  
been found guilty of polluting should not be  
forgiven penalties levied.  

Progressive income taxes based on ability to  
pay, with loopholes closed, is Oregon’s only tax  
reform answer. Any personal property or con-  
sumer oriented tax is regressive and should be  
eliminated.  

Oregon needs more adequate legislation in the  
area of consumer protection and stronger enforcement  
of present laws.
