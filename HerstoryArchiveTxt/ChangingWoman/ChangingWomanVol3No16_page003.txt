MEDIA TASK FORCE REPORT

KISN RADIO

Every spring KISN Radio sponsors a Bridal  
Fair in order for local merchants to display  
household goods, furnishings and wedding clothes  
to about 3000 young, engaged women. Radio  
advertisements for the fair suggest that a woman  
will be happy if she simply gets married and buys  
the right things.

The NOW Media Task Force has met with Mr.  
Sol Rosinsky, manager of KISN, to express our  
concern that women attending this year’s fair  
(March 8-9) be exposed to information about  
some of the non-commercial aspects of marriage.  
For example, what legal rights does a married  
woman have in the areas of credit, insurance, em-  
ployment and name change? What services are  
available to help a couple work out agreements  
about finances, children, housework?

Mr. Rosinsky was very interested in providing  
this information. He agreed to:

1) Invite feminist marriage counselors to par-  
ticipate in the panel discussions held at Bridal  
Fair.

2) Work with NOW to produce a “Community  
Action Forum” program on marriage. The  
program will be aired at 8:30 am Sunday, March  
16 and will be announced at all four sessions of  
the Bridal Fair.

3) Print and distribute to the women attend-  
ing the fair a directory of local resources avail-  
able to women, e.g., birth control and health ser-  
vices, counseling services, where to file an em-  
ployment discrimination complaint. KISN will  
mail out copies of the directory to anyone who  
calls and requests one (226 7191). If you like  
the directory, be sure to compliment KISN with  

KPTV (Channel 12)

During the fall of 1974, the NOW Media Task  
Force met with the management of three local  
television stations in order to discuss ways in  
which the stations might improve their treatment  
of women, both in programming and in employ-  
ment. Two of the stations, KPTV (Channel 12)  
and KATU (Channel 2), were very receptive to  
the concerns we expressed.

KPTV agreed to:

—appoint two feminists to the KPTV Commu-  
nity Service Advisory Committee

—appoint Karen Malmsten, the station’s pro-  
motion manager, to act as a liaison with femin-  
ists in the community

—increase its news coverage of the women’s  
rights movement and problems of women

—air public service announcements provided  
by NOW

—produce a pilot program which, if successful,  
will be made into a series about women

—circulate among on-camera personnel a list  
of guidelines to the use of nonsexist language

—work to place women on its staff in a wider  
range of job assignments

The commitments listed above were added to  
KPTV’s public files.

KATU (Channel 2)

KATU agreed to:

—interview representatives of twenty feminist  
groups in order to ascertain the problems and  
needs of women in the Portland area

—send out a letter to local feminist groups,  
notifying them that KATU is interested in in-  
creasing its news coverage of women’s rights and  
problems of women

—affirmatively seek out women to serve as  
moderators on its public affairs programs

—utilize a list of community resources pro-  
vided by NOW in order to do programming about  
the problems of women over 50

—air public service announcements provided  
by NOW

—circulate among its staff a copy of NOW’s  
monitoring report on KATU’s local programming,  
as well as a copy of guidelines to nonsexist  
language

Both stations expressed a desire to be con-  
tacted more frequently by feminist groups about  
possible items for news coverage. Whenever you  
know of leads for news stories, please contact  
Don Stellges at KPTV and Thayer Walker at  
KATU.

KOIN (Channel 6)

Unlike the management of KPTV and KATU,  
Mr. Richard Butterfield, manager of KOIN-TV,  
expressed no interest in improving his station’s  
treatment of women. He was extremely rude to  
the NOW representatives who met with him on  
November 18. He interrupted us, shouted at  
us, used profanity and addressed us as “honey.”  
After this meeting, we had difficulty arranging  
another meeting with Mr. Butterfield or any  
other KOIN-TV representative.

On January 2, NOW filed a petition with the  
Federal Communications Commission to deny the  
license of KOIN-TV. The petition was filed be-  
cause of the employment policies of KOIN-TV to-  
wards women and minorities, the treatment of  
women in the station’s programming, and Mr.  
Butterfield’s unresponsiveness to NOW. Our data  
on programming was derived from a study con-  
ducted June 16-22, 1974. During that week,  
we monitored nearly all KOIN-TV programming,  
from sign-on to sign-off time, and compiled stat-  
istics about the overall portrayal of women.

Our petition with the Federal Communications  
Commission.

All radio and television stations are licensed  
by the Federal Communications Commission and  
are required by the Commission to operate in  
the public interest. The stations all welcome  
comments about their programming; such com-  
ments help them to do their jobs more effec-  
tively. If you have any criticisms or compli-  
ments to make about a particular program, be  
sure to let the station know by writing or tele-  
phoning. Be specific. State the name of the  
program, the date, and the time that it was  
broadcast.

The four local television stations are listed below:

Mr. Thomas Dargan  
Manager, KATU (Channel 2)  
2153 N.E. Sandy Blvd.  
Portland, OR 97208

LAUREL —to Marlo Thomas and the sponsors of  
her television special, “Free to Be, You and Me.”  
It presented a non-sexist view of parents and  
their functions in the family. It also presented  
non-sexist views of careers for both men and wo-  
men. It should be an annual event on TV. When  
it is rerun, parents should be sure their children  
view the show and talk about the points made by  
some of the segments.
