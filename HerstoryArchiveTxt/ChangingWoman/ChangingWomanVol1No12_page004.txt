in Roger Martin's Committee. Mr. Martin (

Womens Caucus  
Candidate Poll  

Portland area Oregon Women’s Political Caucus received the results of the Questionnaire mailed to  
candidates within each House and Senate district, generally by a Caucus member living in the district.  
These are the tabulated results. These caucus members then met as a group and evaluated the  
questionnaires on a point basis to determine the candidate's overall rating. Each question was given  
+2, +1, 0, -1, or -2. The highest rating is +14, the lowest a -14. (Seven questions) Some districts had  
a much better follow-up than others, resulting in a considerably varied rate of return. Follow-up in the  
General Election should be much better, if only because of the number of candidates being greatly  

reduced.  

Question No. 4 concerned Senate Bill 308 sponsored by Betty Roberts in the last session. It would  
have made it illegal to discriminate on account of sex in public accommodations in Oregon (restaurants,  
bars, hotels, etc.) resulting in some very silly answers.  

Some candidates thought public accommodations referred to toilets.  

S.B. 308 passed the Oregon Senate by a vote of 28 to 2 last session. It was then tabled in the House.  

Senate Seat No. 7) both voted to table this bill in committee.
