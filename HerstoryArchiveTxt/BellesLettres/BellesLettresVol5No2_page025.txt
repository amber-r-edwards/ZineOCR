This Is My Century

New and Collected Poems

Margaret Walker

Since being selected as the recipient of  
the Yale Series of Younger Poets award  
in 1942, Margaret Walker has emerged  
as a major figure in American poetry.  
This Is My Century brings together  

one hundred of her poems, including  
the award-winning debut collection  
For My People.  

“Always immediate but classic in  
voice, Walker’s poetry has a timeless  
quality. . . . If younger poets have  
ranged farther in voice and content,  
it is because they stand high on the  
shoulders of giants such as Margaret  
Walker” — Booklist.  

“Walker writes with a strength and  
clarity that befits her large vision of  
American and African American history”  
—Library Journal.

My Story  

Elisavet Moutzan-Martinengou  
Translated from the Greek by  
Helen Dendrinou Kolias  

Elisavet Moutzan-Martinengou lived her  
entire life (1801-1831) on the Ionian  
Island of Zakynthos, enduring a  
severely restricted existence that had  
altered little for genteel Mediterranean  
women since the Renaissance.  

My Story is the first English transla-  
tion of the autobiography of this  
remarkable woman who found an outlet  
for her loneliness and frustration in  
writing. $22.50

He Included Me  
The Autobiography of  
Sarah Rice  

Transcribed and Edited by  

Louise Westling  

In her own words, a black woman born  
into the rural twentieth-century South  
recalls her life. Laced with humor and  
strength, He Included Me presents the  
spirited testimony of a determined  
working woman and a rare account of  
a black family and race relations at the  

poverty line.  

“He Included Me provides a female  
counterpoint to All God’s Dangers...  
Sarah Rice is a remarkable woman, and  
the interview transcript prepared by  
Louise Westling is an extraordinarily  
rich and compelling treatment of that  
life” — Jacqueline Jones.

of the Seventeenth Century presents

span the whole of Europe, highlighting  
the manifold contributions women
