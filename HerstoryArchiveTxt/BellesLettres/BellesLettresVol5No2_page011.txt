Y | ‘he latest poetry collections by
Paula Gunn Allen, Shirley
Geok-lin Lim, and Adrienne

Rich show how three women who seem

to have little in common culturally share

a woman’s experience in the world that

makes them sisters.

Paula Gunn Allen writes with a view
to Native American tradition. Skins and
Bones, a varied and striking collection,
clothes everyday events in language si-
multaneously natural and poetic, un-
forced and structured. Perhaps “Taku
Shanskan” shows best what Allen seems
to be about:

that history is an event

that life is

what happens to be

what happens to me

god. history. action

the Lakota word for it is:

what moves moves.

they don’t call god “what moves
something.”

not “prime mover.”

“first mover” “who moves everything or
nothing.”

“action.” “lights.” “movement.”

not “where” or “what” or “how” but

event. GOD

is what happens, is:

moves moves.

nu

Lakotas say: god.
what we do.

In such a world then, where God is not
“out there” or “over there” doing some-
thing to us, but instead manifesting ex-
istence through life, movement, and
feeling, we can take joy and/or find pur-
pose in many things.

Allen finds joy when she rejects Mil-
ton’s coy Eve, who believed Adam her
superior — “Hee for God and shee for
God in him” (Paradise Lost, [V:299) —
in “Eve the Fox.” Here Eve romps de-
lightfully in the garden of Eden as she
saunters

over to Adam the hunk

who was twiddling his toes and
devising an elaborate scheme

for renaming the beasts: Adam
was bored, but not Eve for she
knew the joy of swivel hips

and the taste of honey on her lips.

Eve then tempts her mate to “bite into
this”

And wham-bam,

the change arose, it rose up in Adam

as it had in Eve and let me tell you

right then they knew all

they ever wanted to know about knowing

Allen’s wry use of rhyme and cadence
celebrates and laughs about human na-
ture, sex, and the fall all at once.

Music, often sounded through repe-
tition, permeates many poems, as in the
poignant “Something Fragile, Broken,”
with its series of two-line stanzas that
repeat key words and phrases to describe
how loss hurts even if it is for the best or
just the way the world works. The same
cadence builds up the sensual
“Arousings,” where rain washes clean
the roadways and, in the third stanza,
nature’s force is tied to love’s:

how you loved me. made love to me.

what I saw there when I was held.

in the wild tangle of our tongues’
necessity,

rooting in soft-leafed places, melting and
pouring like the hills today, ground
gone to water, running toward the sea.

wrapped in white as becomes one just
awakened.

and her awakening is not death or war,
not rage.

she’s in love, that woman the world.
she's in love.

There are many more fine poems here,
such as “Fantasia Revolution” (a hard
look at post-revolutionaries), “Horns of a
Dilemma” (“the consequences of partial
vision”), “Dear World” (concerning her
mother’s lupus — “She says it’s a disease
/ of self-attack. / It’s like a mugger broke
into your home / and you called the po-
lice / and when they came, they beat up
on you / instead of on your attackers”),
“Grandma’s Dying Poem” (“Do you sup-
pose that / when grandma/ dies / more of
her stays than goes?”), and “Taking a
Visitor to See the Ruins” (complete with
shameless pun).

Shirley Geok-lin Lim

Shirley Geok-lin Lim has traveled far
from her homeland. Born in Malacca,
Malaysia, she now teaches at West-
chester Community College in New
York State. Modern Secrets includes
material from an earlier prize-winning
first book, as well as more recent work.

The mood of her earlier poems —
focused on Malaysia — is sensuous, col-
orful, and playful. “Crossing the Penin-
sula” flashes with primitive colors and
evocative visions of the tropics, and
“Monsoon History” gives a tantalizing
view of the Pacific island’s wet air,
which “curls / In apparitions of smoke.
/Like fat white slugs furled / Among the
timber.”

Other poems range widely through
the world, touching on universal expe-
riences, such as death’s surprise in “The
Windscreen’s Speckled View” or family
relations in “Family Album,” a villanelle
about a boy and his mother.

Sex, as in Allen’s poetry, is some-
times viewed with amusement. “August
Heat” rollicks along, propelled by four-
line stanzas with rhyming first and last
lines and internal couplets:

What a nuisance is this lust,

Lying like an assassin in the dark,
Silent, intent, and the park

A sudden wilderness thick with musk.

Lim is a first-rate poet who allows her

readers to visualize the worlds she has
experienced.

Time’s Power, Adrienne Rich’s latest
slim volume of poems, is the latest pro-
duction of a distinguished career de-
voted to poetry (fourteen books) and
letters (three prose books). The poems
in Time’s Power are elegiac, solemn, and
often haunting, sometimes cryptically
melancholy. One such poem is “Living
Memory,” whose whispers of memento
mori remind the reader of the tragedies of
Vietnam and AIDS:

All we can read is life. Death is invisible.

A yahrzeit candle belongs

to life. The sugar skulls

eaten on graves for the Day of the Dead

belong to life. To the living. The
Kaddish is to the living,

The Waiting Room
by Mary Morris

New York: Doubleday, 1989, $17.95,
273 pp.

I remember the waiting room in the lit-
tle train station in Jackson, Michigan,
when I was growing up during World
War II. Young men who only months
before were boys, their duffel bags for
pillows, lay across wooden benches,
waiting for trains that would carry them
one step closer to the war. Some sat with
girlfriends or parents and wives and chil-
dren, all stunned to silence by the inevi-
tability of parting. Something drew me
to the waiting room in those days. I ac-
cepted the waiting as what women did,
and in a strange kind of empathy needed
to witness over and over the sight of a
soldier grabbing his woman in a bear hug
as she held on to her hat with her free
hand and kicked one spike-heeled shoe
back from the force of the embrace.

As Mary Morris put it in an April 30,
1987, HERS column in The New York
Times, “From Penelope to the present,
women have waited — for a phone call,
for a date, for a marriage proposal, for
the man to return from sea or war or a
business trip. To wait is to be powerless.
Like patients and prisoners, women

herself?) battles her mother “over music
lessons / mine, taught by you” to “Turn-
ing,” with a still-feisty spirit challenging
“Whatever you are that has tracked us
this far” to answer the unanswerable “So
why am I out here, trying / to read your
name in the illegible air?”

These poems all seem intensely per-
sonal, confessional, as in “One Life”:

A woman walking in a walker on the
cliffs

recalls great bodily joys, much pain.

Nothing in her is apt to say

My heart aches. . .

It is all too mixed, the heart too mixed
with laughter,

raucousing the grief, her life

too mixed, she shakes her heavy

silvered hair at all the fixed

declarations of baggage. I should be dead
and I’m alive

don’t ask me how. . .

My heart doesn’t ache; sometimes though
it rages.

Honest, unflinching, these fine poems
seem to spring freely from Rich’s heart.

AUTHOR OF NOTHING TO DECLARE

have waited for the freedom to enter the
world.”

Now Morris, author of Nothing to
Declare, a journal of a woman traveling
alone, has given us The Waiting Room,
an intricately plaited novel of three ge-
nerations of women whose lives are pro-
foundly affected by the consequences of
waiting, women who must come out of
the living burial that waiting entails into
action and healing daylight.

Zoe comes home after an absence of
many years to confront her brother's
breakdown. She must probe for causes.
Does his escape from reality stem from
the drugs he took in Canada where he
fled to avoid the Vietnam war, or does
the answer lie closer to home? Zoe has
buried something too: the memory of an
old love whose loss has trapped her in
the past. Numbed, she is like the tiny
man frozen to death for a million years
and perfectly preserved in the Museum
of Ice she visits on her return.

June, Zoe’s mother, has had to piece
together a life after her husband returns
from World War II, estranged from her
and their little family, unable to face
reality except from behind the relative
safety of a camera lens. For years, June
buries herself in her home, an environ-
ment she continues to perfect until it is
as hermetically sealed as a tomb.

And finally, we have Naomi, the
