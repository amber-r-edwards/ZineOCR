Elaine Starkman’s preface to

Beyond This Body echoes

Prospero’s speech in The Tempest
about actors who "were all spirits, and /
Are melted into air" and signals that she
names reality (that we all fade and die)
and looks at life directly (that much
upon which we spend our time may be,
after all, useless).

and when her skin slackens
and eyes fade and hearing dims
will her lips smile

will her mind turn
toward this labyrinth
from which she takes her meaning

will her fears

and foolish pleasures
her urgency and dread
escape into air

along with these words
on yellowed paper

The “labyrinth” that Starkman
wanders through in this collection in-
volves childhood, maturation, sexuality,
travel, friends, and marriage. She has
taught for over sixteen years in Califor-
nia colleges and coedited State of Peace:
The Women Speak.

Nothing is sappy — especially in the
title poem, where achievements are out-
lined ironically in a little shopping list:

after years

after she’s
studied
married
borne babies
proved her worth
again and again.

The poem concludes that after "she
learns / to throw off" protective layers
and question her physical reality,

more than ever
she needs to know
this intimate riddle
of her own flesh.

Sharp, common images adorn
Starkman’s verse: the "doggy breath" of
her daughter "hummin in that sweet
high voice / that only the last one has";
"sounds flat as Sandburg / faces safe as
hands." Primarily her style is "invisible"
as in the poems quoted above — the
way we might talk ourselves if we could.
Some poems hint of James Joyce —
especially "Where are the children"
when she writes to her children,
"Mamma’s gone to a pub tonight."

Mamma’s mind flashes with all the boys
she’s ever loved and she wants them all
back. She thinks of poor Gerty MacDowell,
Leopold Bloom studying the waxen pallor of
her face and fingers white as lemon juice,
the lameness of that delicate creature.

"In Your Absence" shows love's

strength as well as vulnerability.

You're gone tonight,

the first time in a year;
I'm gleeful as a girl,
imagine myself at a bar
having a one-night stand.

Why? I hate bars,
don’t drink, and wouldn’t
let anyone touch me.

Are these thoughts

my need to know

I can live without you,

my fear I’ll love you too much.

She continues, wishing that her lover
(why do I fight the urge to say "or hus-
band" when I suspect he may be both?)
"won't age / from the power that cor-

Naomi Long Madgett

rupts men" and confessing that, al-
though she feels anger toward me, "By
night I hear the hum / of your mind next
to mine / and know you make me good."

Starkman’s direct, earthy, witty muse
seems to fail her only when she falls into
the "Liberal guilt" syndrome and blathers
on in its obligatory way about poor
people she sees or smugly mocks
thoughtless, unenlightened yuppies en-
joying "the good life" despite terrors
throughout the world.

But I know she is my sister when she
jokes in "Just Once" how great it would
be to be paid for exposing "our natural
resources."

Just think. I could
take two trips a year,
print bad poems, dole out money.

I could give up
teaching English
part-time all year.

Sandra Gilbert’s introduction charac-
terizes The Life of Mary as "ambitious";
certainly, Charlotte Mandel’s aspiration
is commendable. Mandel has had a dis-
tinguished career as poet (author of A
Disc of Clear Water and Doll) and inde-
pendent scholar, but I am always a little
suspicious when works require "intro-
ducing" to guide a reader’s response. In
this case, Mandel’s "poem-novella"
seems neither poem nor novella. The
author’s meditations, mixed between the
Virgin Mary and a modern Mary, strug-
gle under the task of also forwarding the
narrative. It is as if Mandel outlined a
novel and then, instead of writing it,
filled it with sketches such as the follow-
ing report of the modern Mary taking
her newborn baby home.

On his seventh day, a nurse
inserts his fists into flannel
and knitted wool.

She rolls his head into a cap
with ties of satin ribbon,
enfolds him in hooded fleece
and a blue quilt.

Before the child is given her, Mary
is made to sit
in a wheelchair.

Now that is boring. Nothing seems to

happen; she just takes the child home
from the hospital. Using verbs to carry
action "inserts" and "rolls" and "enfolds"
in the first stanza does not make poetry.
And chopping sentences into short lines
and pauses does not either.
“The Life of Mary does have some
beautifully wrought lines. Mandel can
write and can startle, as in the following
stanza of a surrealistic vision of Michel-
angelo’s Pieta coming to life

A strange sweat gathers
under the hooded robe
Marble thighs ache

beneath the fallen male body

"Look," a voice shouts in the church,
"the virgin mother’s face—

she bleeds she bleeds white blood —"
A groan like a tunnel of wind
buffets the glass wall

She is too warm—

Her son cannot breathe—

She lowers the half-naked body

to the floor, rises erect:

"Give him air!"

The scream sweeps the people to the farthest
door

"I am stone," the mother cries

smashing her left hand like an axe

through the glass

Air sighs through the hole

wide as her forearm

"Now, when he is ready," the woman says,
lifting the man to her lap,
"he will breathe."

Here Mary’s determination, con-
fidence, and strength shine through
sparing narrative and powerful imagery.
And yet this passage stands out because
so many others are flat. The book offers
some admirable lines from a poet whose
promise and potential seem as yet only
partially realized.

Octavia herself gazes at us from the
sepia-tinted cover of Naomi Long
Madgett’s Octavia and Other Poems.
Born in 1885 and dead by 1920 of tuber-
culosis, this woman subject of the first
half of the book seems to hold the world
at bay with a formality both shy and
proud. "Here I am," she says. "I don’t
care what you think. [pause two beats]
Do you like me?"

Madgett imaginatively reconstructs
the life of her long-lost relative by using
letters (real or imagined), descriptions,
and heart’s wishes to bring her to life
and, finally, to come to terms with
Octavia’s pain and joy. She writes in "At
Rest":

I searched for you and found you
Now I leave a yellow rose

of remembrance on your grave.
Soon enough I will return

to join you in this sod, but

till then, I exorcize you

from my spirit, old skeleton
rattling around all these years

in my skin. Now be at peace.
Rest. Rest now. And so will I.

Poems and haunting photographs of
this educated, cultured, part African,
Spanish, French, and Cherokee family
reveal the presence of three other
children in addition to Octavia.

I liked the last section best, however,
because the poet lets down her own Oc-
tavia-like barriers and describes her life
and friends. Sometimes she writes with
shocking honesty as when she describes
the brutal murder of a kind, old woman
("December Finale"); sometimes with
self-deprecating humor ("Letting It All
Hang Out"); and sometimes with great
love ("Without Condition").

All these years
I have loved you
without condition

of return

So what if now

another voice sustains you,
another hand teaches you what
love means?

It’s all right, it really is

all right because

I have loved you all

these years

without

condition of return.

This poet knows much about her life
and mine. Madgett, editor and publisher
of Lotus Press, is professor emeritus at
Eastern Michigan University.

Linda Hogan (Savings) is aware of
what she is doing, but sometimes I just
do not care. You might. She is a deeply
meditative poet, and I suspect that
Savings would endure well if one dipped
into it over the years. Her images are

firm; her poetic structures are com-
petent. There is little in these poems to
disgust and nothing slovenly; but many
poems seem heartless, cold, even forced.
Take, for example, these lines from "The
Lost Girls."

We go on

or we don’t,

knowing about our inner women
and when they left us

like we were bad mothers or lovers
who wronged ourselves.

What is that really saying? Do we go
on or do we not? And who is this "we"?
What is an "inner woman"? She never
really explains but concludes that she
will go on "loving all the girls and
women / I have always been." That is
nice for her, but I feel as if I have been
lectured by a condescending aunt.

Hogan’s pattern of I am this, no I am
that appears repeatedly, most objec-
tionably in the final stanza of an other-
wise fine and disciplined poem, "Two of
Hearts."

and I am their blood,

no matter what,

and I am not their blood
no matter,

but, oh, this world,

this cut and cutting world.

That smacks too much of Shelley at
his most self-indulgent, as for example in
"Ode to the West Wind" when he cries
"I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!"

But enough negative. Many poems
sing. "Savings" ("Night unravels / the
calcium from bones"), "What Has Hap-
pened to These Working Hands?",
"Geraniums" ("Life is burning / in every-
thing, in red flowers"), "Morning with
Broken Window" and "The Legal Sys-
tem" are all thoughtful, fresh explora-
tions, almost prayers.

And Hogan catches certain images su-
perbly well, especially those of the wild
creatures she often incorporates into her
poems. To be surprised by her keen eye
is a joy. In "The History of Fire," for ex-
ample, she says "and I am smoke with
gray hair, / ash with black fingers and
palms." My favorite metaphor appears in
"Rain" where she sees falling rain as
"birth waters" that "are breaking down /
the sturdy legs of sky." She speaks of
poignant little "skeletons of mice left be-
tween beams" ("The House") that we
also see in "Pillow" with "the mice
within our poisoned walls."

A few stanzas from "Elk Song" show
how magically Hogan blends animals
and humans in her best poems.

We give thanks

to deer, otter,

the great fish.

and birds that fly over

and are our bones and skin.

Even the yelping dog at our heels
is a hungry crow

picking bones wolf left behind.
And thanks to the corn and trees.
The earth

is a rich table

and a slaughterhouse

for humans as well.

The earth shakes.

People say it’s a train full of danger

or the plane-broken barriers of sound,

but out there

behind the dark trunks of trees

the gone elk have pulled the hide of earth
tight and they are drumming

back the woodland,

tall grass and days we were equal

and strong.

These books illustrate the ways we
can draw from our own experience to
create a voice uniquely our own. To
paraphrase another writer, not to do so is
a kind of suicide. Each poet writes from
her experience in life; each woman’s life
is unique not only from the lives of men
but also from the lives of other women.
