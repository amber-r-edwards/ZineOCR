NEW DIRECTIONS FOR WOMEN, that is. A 16-year-old unabashedly
feminist newspaper, full of investigative reporting, interviews with well-

known and not-so-well-known women, cultural criticism, biting satire, book,
movie, music reviews and much, much more.

Not convinced? Listen to what Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Ms. Editor and author
of Among Women has to say: “I have been reading NEW DIRECTIONS FOR

WOMEN since its beginning and never -- never -- have I read an issue without
learning from it.”

So give us a try. $1.00 will get you a sample copy, $10.00 will get you a
