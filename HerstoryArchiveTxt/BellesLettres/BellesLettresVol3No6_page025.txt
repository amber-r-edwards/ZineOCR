THE ART OF THE WOMAN  
The Life and Work of Elisabet Ney  

By Emily Fourmy Cutrer  

“Constantly involving, refreshing and quite perceptive.”—Kirkus Reviews. “Cutrer’s rigorous biographical-critical study paints a vivid picture of this adventurous woman’s frustrating existence as a frontier artist.”—Publishers Weekly. The Art of the Woman does justice, finally, to Elisabet Ney, the flamboyant sculptor who transfixed Schopenhauer and left the court of the half-mad Ludwig of Bavaria for America, ultimately settling on a decaying estate in Texas where she became an important catalyst to cultural activity. A volume in our series, Women in the West. xvi, 271 pages, introduction, epilogue, notes, bibliography, index, 40 b&w illustrations. $24.95
