Useful Gifts

Stories by Carole L. Glickfeld

Winner of the Flannery O’Connor Award
for Short Fiction

Charged with the mysteries of childhood,
Useful Gifts explores the world of Ruthie
Zimmer—the youngest child of deaf-mute
parents living in Manhattan in the 1940s
and 1950s—as she interprets for her parents
worlds as expansive as her rooftop play-
ground and as diverse as the neighborhood
below.

“When Ruthie Zimmer translates for us,
we come to understand that the world of
the deaf is not at all silent; it’s bursting with
life and conversation. It is we who cannot
hear them”—New York Times Book Review.

To Newfoundland

Poems by Caroline Knox

Witty and venturesome, the poems in

To Newfoundland represent some sort of
journey to some sort of new-found land,
whether the Vikings’ journey to L’Anse-aux-
Meadows or the poet’s own excursions into
traditional forms such as the sonnet, the
villanelle, and the pantoum, or into prose
poetry and play scenes.

“A colorful, revealing portrait of Puerto

captivated by tales about her mysterious
uncle. The two finally meet in a Paterson,
New Jersey, tenement—where the tensions
between the new American culture and
surviving island ways threaten to explode.
