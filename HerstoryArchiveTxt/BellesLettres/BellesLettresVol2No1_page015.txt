Ties, continued from page 6

the hurricane, during which the survivors  
sit and count their losses and are un-  
ceremoniously sent back to ordinary real-  
ity, not better, not wiser for the storm —  
only more bereft.

An Item From the Late News is also set in  
a remote, self-sufficient outpost of human  
nature: Allbut, an aptly named rural  
community in the Queensland outback.  
Each inhabitant is broken, chipped away  
physically and morally by misfortune or  
failed love or prejudice. The only one who  
seems intact is Wafer, a newcomer who  
fears nuclear war and is building a bomb  
shelter for himself in which to wait out the  
conflagration. Wafer can still think and  
feel, enough to offer help to the mis-  
fortunate and a gentle admiring love to a  
young girl. But he is misunderstood and  
hated; and finally, when it is discovered  
that a lump of rock he carries like a talis-  
man is a hunk of sapphire, the town can  
use its self-righteous greed to persecute  
and finally kill Wafer in a horrifying chase  
scene reminiscent of Golding’s Lord of the  
Flies. Only the narrator, a failed artist who  
was in love with Wafer herself and who is  
telling the tale after ten years have passed,  
has made any peace with herself over the  
brutality in which she was a half-willing  
participant.

In both novels, the alienation between  
individuals is reflected in a vast alienation  
between the sexes. Men and women live  
in different worlds, equally dispiriting and  
mutually impenetrable to the other. This  
alienation makes love impossible,  
marriage unbearable. But no rela-  
tionships work in these worlds. Male  
friendships are nonexistent in A Boatload  
of Home Folk and lead to brutal murder in  
An Item From the Late News. Women  
never achieve more than a glimmer of  
sympathy for each other’s unhappy lots in  
either novel.

Despite their bleakness, these tales are  
a pleasure to read. The power of Astley’s  
crisp, clear prose makes each novel a tour  
de force. Her sharply styled sentences rush  
headlong like the natural forces of the  
weather — or the heart. The novels are  
short, but seem even shorter because they  
move so inexorably toward implosion.  
And Astley’s bitter irony, astringent in  
these wounded worlds, brings healing in  
hilarity. We cannot help laughing as Miss  
Paradise prepares a mocking “commun-  
ion” meal of cardboard strips in white  
sauce for the hurricane survivors,  
responding when asked what it is with “It’s  
a panacea... . It should cure — a lot of  
things.” The lacerating joke is thrust  
deeper when Gerald announces after the  
meal, “This is the difference. . . between  
animals and us. That we make attempts to  
survive. Plates and all.” In a world of ties  
that do not bind, there is survival value in  
knowing what nourishes and what merely  
fills the stomach. Astley’s honesty is  
meant to encourage unblinking devotion  
to such distinctions.

THE DESTINY OF OD

ISABELLE  
EBERHARDT

A BIOGRAPHY

A subject to which few intellectuals ever  
give a thought is the right to be a vagrant,  
the freedom to wander. To have the  
courage to smash the chains with which  
modern life has weighted us (under the  
pretext that it was offering us more liberty),  
then to take up the symbolic stick and  
bundle and get out!

To be alone, to be poor in needs, to be  
ignored, to be an outsider who is at home  
everywhere, and to walk, great and by  
oneself, toward the conquest of the world.
