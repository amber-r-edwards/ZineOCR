IN A SUMMER SEASON

Elizabeth Taylor. Dial Virago (p) 6.95 1.98
This is Taylor's sexiest novel in which each
character through the course of the story
becomes infatuated with someone. It is Tay-
lor's description of the importance of each

effect of these infatuations on everyone
around them that makes this novel so pierc-
ingly funny. (251/61682)

Tenterhooks: Love at Second Sight

Ada Leverson. Dial Virago (p) 9.95 1.98

MAURICE GUEST

Henry Handel Richardson.

Dial Virago (p) 9.95 1.98
Ethel Florence Lindesay Richardson wrote this
novel of degrading sexual obsession from the
point of view of its masculine victim. It takes
place in late 19th-century Leipzig, the music
capital of Europe, where the hero, Maurice
Guest, has gone to train to become a great
pianist. He finds a muse in Louise Dufrayer,
who is in love with and has been dumped by
the resident genius, Schilsky, who bears re-
semblance to a bitter caricature of Richard
Strauss. Louise accepts Maurice as a substi-
tute and leads him into a maze of depravity to
morgues, drunken debauches, and a prosti-
tute's bed. As a study of the tragic power of
desperate love, the novel ranks in the great
tradition of the European naturalist novel.

ORDINARY FAMILIES
E. Arnot Robertson.

“Ordinary families are all alike, every ordinary
family is extraordinary in its own ways,” writes
Polly Devlin in her introduction to this delight-
ful novel. It's the story of three middle-class
families, the Cottrells, the Rushes, and the
Guests observed through the eyes, ears, and
voice of the young heroine Lallie Rush.

THE SOUL OF KINDNESS
Elizabeth Taylor. Dial Virago (p) 6.95 1.98
The soul of kindness was what Flora believed
herself to be, and made almost everyone else
believe. Tall, blond, and as beautiful as a Bot-
ticelli girl, she appeared to have everything
under control — her household, her baby, her
husband, her all-too-loyal friend, Meg. Only
the painter, Liz, refuses to become a worship-
per at the shrine. In this novel, Taylor explores
deception and the disease of self-love.
(219/64683)

51217

STRANGERS

Antonia White. Dial Virago (p) 6.95 1.98
These seven stories, written between 1928
and 1943, reiterate the themes that recur
throughout White’s work: the pains and joys
of growing up and falling in and out of love;
the borderlands between love and loneliness,
sanity and madness, belief and the loss of
faith. (173/54&83)

Maureen Duffy. Dial Virago (p) 6.95 1.98

Margaret Kennedy
Together and Apart

TOLD BY AN IDIOT
Rose Macaulay. Dial Virago (p) 7.95 1.98
This novel is Macaulay's panoramic tour de
force revealing through three generations of
one extraordinary family the social, political,
and religious fortunes of England from the age
of Victoria to the 1920s. There is Victoria, a
Pre-Raphaelite beauty intent on marriage;
Maurice, shaking his fist at the injustices of
the world; Stanley, a follower of Ruskin and
Morris, doing good as radical fashion dictates;
Irving, a lusty young capitalist; and Una, born
for happy marriage and maternity. All are
watched from the sidelines by their sister
Rome. Detached, intelligent, urbane, she ob-
serves her family; to her, their sound and fury
signify nothing — but to the reader the mem-
ory of Rome's one brief love affair strikes the
final note of truth, defiantly affirming that it
is better to have loved and lost. (315/23&83)

51221

THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE

trying to ease the pain of her dying mother.

power. (190/59681)
