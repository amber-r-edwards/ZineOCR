Biographies, Letters,  
and Memoirs  

A biography with an irresistible  

title (deriving from an epithet  

used against its subject) is A  
Woman of No Character, a book by  
Fidelis Morgan about eighteenth-  
century author Délariviére Manley  
(Faber & Faber). Extremely popular in  
her day, Manley influenced the male  
writers of the time (now called the major  
writers of the period) and later provoked  
both controversy and critical misogyny.  
You can read her work in Dale Spender’s  
Pandora series, Mothers of the Novel.  
Although attacked for the preposterous-  
ness of her autobiographical writing  
(which she meant to be read as fiction  
anyway), her biographer finds the true  
events of her life even more amazing.

Making Faces: Memoirs of a Caricatur-  
ist by Aline Fruhauf (Seven Locks Press,  
PO Box 27, Cabin John, MD 20818,  
$19.95), and they give a good idea of her  
style. From the 1920s through the  
1950s, she caricatured prominent art-  
ists, designers, musicians, and actors.  

When we did our special issue on  
Jewish women writers last September,  
there was a Holocaust book I had heard  
of but had not received in time to in-  
clude. After seeing the issue, Iris Till-  
man Hill from the University of North  
Carolina Press sent me Auschwitz:  
True Tales From a Grotesque Land  
(HB, $16.95; PB, $8.95) by Sara  
Nomberg-Przytyk. About this kind of  
book I am speechless. The author says  
she needed twenty years’ distance before  
beginning to write it or she would have  
gone mad. I opened it, thinking I could  
bear to read a little to tell readers some-  
thing about it, and my eye fell on this:  

We were standing, as was our  
wont, in front of the block watching  
the sky turn to a deeper red. All  
around us was quiet that night,  
because there was no transport.  
Apparently there was a large backlog  
of corpses that had to be burned  
before the new raw material could  
be brought in. Suddenly, the still-  
ness was broken by the screaming of  
children, as if a single scream had  
been torn out of hundreds of  
mouths, a single scream of fear and  
unusual pain, a scream repeated a  
thousand times in the single word,  
“Mama,” a scream that increased in  
intensity every second, enveloping  
the whole camp and every inmate.  
Our lips parted without our being  
conscious of what we were doing,  
and a scream of despair tore out of  
our throats, growing louder all the  
time. . . . Finally, our screaming  
stopped. On the block we could still  
hear the screams of the children  
who were being murdered, then  
only sighs, and at the end every-  
thing was enveloped in death and  
silence. The next day the men told  
us that the SS men loaded the  
children into wheelbarrows and  
dumped them into the fiery ravines.  
Living children burned like torches.  
What did these children do to suffer  
such a fate? Is there any punishment  
adequate to repay the criminals who  
perpetrated these crimes?

“Social Diseases” of  
Feminist Foremothers  

Susan Koppelman’s “fishbowl”  
panel at last summer’s National  
Women’s Studies Association  
conference looked at what women  
scholars do with disturbing material  
about women they are working on.  
Lynda Koolish said she has en-  
countered antisemitism and classism in  
Virginia Woolf’s work as well as  
antisemitism in certain passages in the  
writing of Paule Marshall. She was most  
passionate, however, about hearing a  
homophobic paper given on The Color  
Purple at MLA by a Black scholar. She  
spoke out then and later wrote the au-  
thor of the paper a letter, which was re-  
ceived positively.

Blanche Cook participated via a let-  
ter, regretting that work on her biog-  
raphy of Eleanor Roosevelt prevented  
her from being there. Roosevelt, she  
wrote, was “as complex and contradic-  
tory as her time.” She was “casually ra-  
cist, yet her stereotypes evaporated as  
time went by.” She was one of the first to  
see the continuity between racism here  
and in Germany; her protests and those  
of Carrie Chapman Catt were unfortu-  
nately ineffective before 1945.  

Judith Arcana spoke of her biography  
in progress of Grace Paley, in whom she  
sees a “rising consciousness” and an abil-  
ity to “come to terms with specific issues  
and to rectify mistakes.” Examples of  
blind spots are Paley’s use of the generic  
male (objected to by a character in her  
most recent collection of stories), her  
use of “fairy” and “queer” to refer to gay  
men in the narrative voice, and her  
longstanding omission of lesbians or the  
idea of lesbian love. On the last page of  
Later the Same Day, Paley’s autobio-  
graphical character Faith, a writer, is  
asked by a friend, “where is my life?”  
When Faith asks if she can forgive her,  

the friend says, “From now on I’ll watch  
you like a hawk. I do not forgive you.”  

Glynis Carr and Susan Koppelman  
are working on an anthology of interra-  
cial relationships. Carr voiced a concern  
with changing the canon of lit-  
erature and a disappointment in the at-  
titudes of many of the white women  
writers. They opposed race oppression,  
yet could not see their own racism. Har-  
riet Beecher Stowe, for instance,  
avoided many pernicious stereotypes of  
her day, yet her lighter characters are  
the ones closer to salvation.  

Dale Spender started out by saying  
that her degree in Australian literature  
was a “degree in boys” (but she neglected  
to read Miles Franklin and Henry Han-  
del Richardson because she thought they  
were men). The few women who wrote  
and whose work survived were almost  
exclusively white. Almost all of them  
mentioned race and dispossession in  
their work, yet in two hundred years,  
none of the men did. Some of these  
women writers (whom Spender is re-  
printing in paperback editions from  
Pandora Press) seem racist at times to us  
today. But to keep them in oblivion  
because of that would be counter-  
productive, she said. We need to re-  
present them to see their strengths and  
to share their joy. For instance, Cather-  
ine Martin in Incredible Journey put on  
record the heroic love and devotion of  
an aboriginal woman robbed of her  
child. She was reviled for her “outra-  
geous” stand. Yet today she could be  
condemned for not going far enough.  
“We sometimes approach things  
ahistorically,” said Spender. “How will  
people evaluate us?”  

Cathy Davidson, who has done such  
fascinating work on the early novel in  
America, gave a preamble about a novel  
she had written that was a “radical revi-  
sion of the Tiresias myth.” An editor at a  
major New York publishing house had  
read it and was keen on publishing it,  
but dumped it angrily when she found  
out from Davidson’s agent that the work  
was not a hot autobiography. She then  
told about being perturbed in her studies  
of anonymous early novels by being una-  
ble to tell which authors were men and  
which were women. Being wrong about

several attributions made her think  
twice about how often we read irony into  
women’s works — how we want women  
of the past to reflect our values. How  
much do our principles make us create  
people in our own image?  

Emily Toth (whose biography of Kate  
Chopin is due out soon from Atheneum)  
took up this question, saying that we  
have a desire for the women we are writ-  
ing about to “do the right  
thing.” She found herself willing Cho-  
pin to be a feminist — to have close  
women friends and be part of women’s  
groups. She told how Chopin’s first bi-  
ographer interviewed only men and  
hence lost the voices of women. His fil-  
ter was that he wanted Chopin to be a  
chaste widow, so he portrayed her that  
way and ignored sources of conflicting  
evidence. Both he and Toth wanted  
Chopin to be their kind of person. Yet  
Toth found that Chopin was not partic-  
ularly sympathetic to women in writing  
or in life.  

Annette Kolodny sent a ringing call  
to action, to wit: “To be feminist and act  
powerfully in the world does not require  
absolute perfection. We must act as best  
we can. We should be scrupulously hon-  
est and not evade mistakes or hide our  
battles, prejudices, or internecine war-  
fare. We must not rewrite history.”  

Susan Koppelman spoke about her  
dismay at being denied access to feminist  
groups and resources because of  
antisemitism, “fatophobia,” and able-  
ism. Relating these issues to the prob-  
lems being discussed, she said that  
knowing people are being exclusionary  
out of prejudice shifts the burden from  
the target to the source. “What does it  
do to people,” Susan asked, “who have  
been the victims of oppression if we lie  
about that oppression, if we say it wasn’t  
as bad as it was or it wasn’t there?” From  
hindsight it could appear that people’s  
struggles against oppression are merely  
paranoid. If we do not expose honestly  
the “social diseases” of our feminist fore-  
mothers, then the true dimensions of  
the struggles of the victims of generalized  
oppression (racism, homophobia, able-  
ism, antisemitism, xenophobia) cannot  
be understood, and we assume that they  
had allies when they did not.
