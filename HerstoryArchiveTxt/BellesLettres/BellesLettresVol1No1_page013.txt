Memory and  
Desire

The Lover, by Marguerite Duras.  
Translated by Barbara Bray. New York:  
Pantheon Books, 1985, $11.95, 117 pp.  

Since 1959, when she wrote the  
script of Alain Resnais’s  
Hiroshima, Mon Amour,  
Marguerite Duras’s success has been  
growing constantly. Yet, it took the  
French institution 40 years after  
Duras’s first book, Les Impudents  
(1943), to acknowledge her enormous  
talent by giving her the Prix Goncourt  
for her autobiographical novel, The  
Lover. This award is usually given to  
young writers in recognition of their  
emerging talent. The Goncourt jury  
awarded Duras the prize not for The  
Lover itself but for her entire oeuvre.  

If one is conversant with Duras’s  
work, one cannot help reading The  
Lover as repetition, as a condensation  
of the patterns and obsessions of her  
prose. Her work is like an ongoing  
weaving, with threads interconnected  
from one book to another and from  
film to book to play.  

Although her style is still the same  
in The Lover— full of inversions and  
repetitions — the use of pronouns  
changes. For the first time, the  
narrator uses the autobiographical “I.”  
But she also alternates the use of “I”  
with “she” to refer to the same  
“person,” as if an omniscient narrator  
could not be the object of her own  
discourse, as if the lifelong custom of  
using “she” when recounting stories  
could not be given up, and as if one  
needed to keep a distance from one's  
autobiographical text. The Lover  
recaptures the essence, the source of  
life, a remembrance of things past. As  
such, it is closer to Duras than any of  
her previous texts. Both La Maladie de  
la Mort (1980) and the experience of  
withdrawal from alcohol, which is  
related by Yann Andrea in M.D.  
(1983), gave her the energy to  
reconsider the past and to write The  
Lover.  

Like Nathalie Sarraute with  
Enfance (1983), Duras takes  
autobiography as a challenge. Because  
her family members are all dead, she  
can now dare to go straight to the  
point and reveal herself, her family,  
and her Chinese lover. Whereas  
Sarraute’s secret lay in her mother’s  
leaving with a lover, Duras recalls her  
first lover and also her love/hate  
relationship with her family members,

especially her mother. The beginning  
of her passionate love affair takes  
place on a ferry crossing the Mekong  
River, and this striking moment recurs  
several times in the novel like an  
obsessive theme.

As she said in an interview with  
Liberation (September 4, 1984), her  
affair lasted only a year and a half,  
but the story is without end. It  
remained a source for many of her  
fictitious characters. What is special is  
the silence between the two lovers;  
what prevails is physical contact.  
Because there is no question of love,  
the relationship is essentially limited  
to physical, yet heightened,  
sensations. “The present is so strong  
that it cannot be explained by words.  
When love is not declared, it has the  
strength of the body, the total  
strength of its ‘jouissance.’ Its story  
must be told from outside. One  
cannot enter into it,” Duras said  
during that interview.  

Because of the title of the book,  
one expects the story of the lover to  
be paramount, but Duras also recalls  
the intense relationship between  
mother and children and between  
brothers and sister. In books like The  
Sea Wall or Days in the Trees, she had  
written around the subject, without  
saying the essential. In The Lover she  
talks explicitly about her mother’s  
madness, her brother’s aggressiveness,  
and the discovery of her own  
sexuality, of desire and pleasure.  
Throughout the book the weft of  
these stories is so tight that it is  
impossible to sort out the essential.  
Which is more important, the family  
situation or the encounter with the  
lover? Probably both, because both  
are mixed in the narrative.  

There are also many digressions  
from the main story. The book begins  
with an incident in which a man  
comes to tell Duras that he prefers the

way her face looks now because time  
has put its mark on it. This event  
triggers a process of remembering how  
early her face has been marked by  
time. She talks about her face having  
been ravaged by alcohol: “Drink  
accomplished what God did not.” But  
she also says that she had this face  
even before she began drinking.  
Alcohol delineated what was already  
there. On her face one could also see  
desire and “jouissance” before she had  
experienced them.  

She drifts into other things: the  
high heels and the man’s hat she  
usually wore, which created an  
ambiguous image. She attracted  
people’s attention because she dressed  
so informally. She now sees herself as  
“available to all, available to all eyes,  
in circulation for cities, journeys,  
desire.” All parts of her clothing  
contradict one another. Finally she  
comes back to the central scene on  
the ferry: Someone in a limousine is  
watching her. Again she stops,  
leading us to believe that she must  
interrupt her narrative so often  
because the event is indeed so crucial.  

Although Duras does not call  
herself a feminist, she is sensitive to  
bonding between women. Her  
memories of her high school  
girlfriends are very vivid. She recalls  
their beauty, their warmth, the  
complicity she had with them. Her  
desire for one of them is very  
powerful: “I’m worn out by the beauty  
of Helene Lagonelle’s body lying  
against mine. Her body is sublime,  
naked under the dress, within arm’s  
reach.” Violence is an important  
element in her past and in her fantasy  
life. However, the intensity of her  
desire is the source of this violence:  
“I'd like to eat Helene Lagonelle’s  
breasts as he eats mine in the room in  
the Chinese town where I go every  
night to increase my knowledge of  
God. I’d like to devour and be  
devoured by those flour-white breasts  
of hers.”  

The variety of narrative patterns,  
the interweaving of different stories,  
and the use of Duras’s own obsessions  
throughout 40 years of creative work  
make The Lover a central book in her  
career. Although she deserved the  
Prix Goncourt for many other books,  
let us rejoice that her artistry has  
finally been officially acknowledged.

Inheritance  

Grandmother, all year  
you've moved inside my skin  
trained me to your ways  
taken over lesser clay —  
kinship claiming its own.  

Yesterday in a junk-shop window  
I became your glassed twin —  
even to the brave coat  

rescued from a son’s discarding.  

And my hand, become your own,  
moved like a divining rod  

toward the one true piece  

of gold — I watched you  

finger it through glass.

Slave-daughter  

She entered the best back doors  

in town  
bread-kneader, translator for owls  
and babies, interpreter of myths,  
goddess of mint beds and sunflowers.  
Arbiter, healer, diplomat,  
she earned her five dollars.  
In memoriam I climb  
her high abandoned stairs  
and knock at her back door.

Matriarch  

The moment I took her from the box  
I knew she was kin: high-browed,  
inscrutable eyed, composite  

of my grandmother and her rival  
sister, come together in this,  

their grandmother’s face.  

To a grandchild she would say,  
“How bad you do need switching!”  
Yet she was swift defender  

of the falsely accused: “Annie  

is a wild, hoydenous creature,  

but she is a high-toned, honorable  
child and would scorn to tell a lie.”  

“God catch it!” she would cry  
when a child stumbled toward fire  
and some divine representative  
always did — white or black,  
male or female, the rescue  

was what mattered, achieved  

by whatever hand.  

She herself had just one — the left.  

A broken arm, set badly, sawed off  
when she was sixteen. The surgeon  
fell in love with her austere beauty,  
died before he could claim her.  

She wore a black cape to hide  

the missing arm, pinned her handwork  
to her skirt to hold it fast.  

On her back, some spider hand  
has lettered Big Mother.  

I will keep her stern visage  
upon the memory’s eyeball  
holding it against a time  

when I might need rescue  

by the left hand of God.
