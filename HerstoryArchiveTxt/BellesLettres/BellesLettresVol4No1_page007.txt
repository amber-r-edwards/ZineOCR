Fried Green Tomatoes at the  
Whistle Stop Cafe  
by Fannie Flagg  

Random House, 1987, $17.95, 403 pp.  

Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe  
is a southern novel — but not a southern  
novel with belles dripping magnolia sweet-  
ness while lamenting the good old days.  

The cafe is run by Idgie Threadgoode and  
her friend Ruth Jamison, with the cooking  
being done by Sipsey and Onzell and the bar-  
becue by Big George, Onzell’s husband. (An  
added plus are recipes printed at the end so  
that readers enthralled by the descriptions of  
the food can try to make their own.)  

Idgie Threadgoode succeeded in being  
different when she decided she would no  
longer wear dresses. As this was just before  
her big sister’s wedding, her mama had to  
have a suit specially made for her. Later after  
her brother Buddy’s unfortunate death, Idgie  
wouldn’t listen to anyone until Ruth came to  
work with the church camp for the summer.  
Ruth becomes the love of Idgie’s life, but  
Ruth is engaged to be married, so at the end  
of the summer Idgie has to most unhappily  
watch Ruth leave. Idgie runs wild for a time,  
but then in a well-planned and well-acted  
abduction, Idgie rescues Ruth — now preg-  
nant — from her seemingly upright but ac-  
tually low-down husband.  

Tales of the Threadgoode family are told  
to Evelyn Couch, a woman who knows life  
hasn’t been what it should have been for her  
but sees escape only through food. Each

Works of Wit by Women Writers  

Elizabeth Bennett in Pride and  

Prejudice. In a list of prac-  
titioners of dry, ironic humor, one  
would have to include her creator, Jane  
Austen, as well as countrywomen  
Elizabeth Taylor and Anita Brookner.  
Prompted by this issue’s special section,  
I thought about other authors that made  
me smile — or even better, laugh out  
loud. With help from a few other book-  
women, I came up with the following  
noncanonical, noninclusive list of  
funny women writers. I am sure you will  
find some of them and more in the  
Walker and Dresner anthology, which is  
not published as I write this. (Remember  
also the humor in the work of Black  
women writers that Cheryl Clarke  
pointed out in the May issue’s review of  
Invented Lives.)  

“Life’s love a laugh,” said  

Beryl Bainbridge: This Britisher’s  
many novels have in common mordant  
humor of an inky black hue. Braziller  
publishes her here.  

Blanche Boyd: Tall tales and absurd  
situations enliven the prose of this  
Southern-born essayist and raconteur;  
she is working on her third novel.  
Barbara Comyns: Her quirky, droll,  
unique novels — The Vet's Daughter,  
Our Spoons Came From Woolworths, Sis-  
ters by a River, The Skin Chairs, Who Was  
Changed and Who Was Dead — have  
been republished by Virago. A para-  
graph chosen at random from Sisters:  

Some time later we had a rather  
frightful governess called Tucker,  
she didn’t have a very long reign,  
one day when she was taking us for  
a walk to Marcliff, we found a  
landslide made of clay, so we all slid  
down on our bottoms and couldn’t  
get up again, at least we pretended  
we couldn’t, so Miss Tucker got all  
angry and flustered and eventually  
had to slide down too. When we  
started walking home we had to pass  

Belles Lettres  

Sunday Evelyn goes with her husband to the  
Rose Terrace Nursing Home, where he and  
his mother watch television while Evelyn  
escapes to the visitor's lounge to eat hidden  
candy bars. There she meets Virginia  
(known as Ninny) Threadgoode, who is, she  
tells Evelyn, just visiting Rose Terrace while  
her neighbor Mrs. Otis settles in good. As  
Ninny talks to Evelyn about the  
Threadgoodes, Evelyn becomes caught up in  
their lives, so that the weekly visit to the  
nursing home becomes the high point of her  
week.  

The novel goes back and forth in time  
between the scenes between Evelyn and Mrs.  
Threadgoode, Whistle Stop during the time  
of the cafe, and Dot Weems’s column in the  
Weems Weekly, where we keep up with the  
town’s doings. Dot Weems writes about all  
local events, including the death of a  
ninety-eight-year-old woman “of what was  
thought to be old age.” Interspersed is the  
continuing account of Evelyn Couch’s own  
move from passivity to action.  

As a chronicle of life in a small town dur-  
ing the Depression years, Fried Green Toma-  
toes brings in the entire population from the  
Black families to the white Baptist minister,  
a teetotaler to whose home people looking for  
some whiskey are sent. It is a beautifully  
funny novel that not only found me laughing  
aloud but had me rushing to the phone to  
read selected passages to friends. As is said  
down South, Fannie Flagg done good.

JIMANY AND FRITZ.  

through a field of great snorting  
cows, Mary and Beatrix just went  
on, but I just refused to, poor Miss  
Tucker tried to drag me but I spat  
at her, then she suddenly sat down  
and started crying. I felt horrified,  
there she sat on the grass all hud-  
dled up, she wore a huge hat of  
very coarse straw, like a giant bis-  
cuit, ever since she came I had  
been longing to bite it but had not  
had the chance, so I said “If you  
will let me bite your hat I’ll go  
through that awful field” so I bit her  
hat, you could hardly tell anyone  
had had a bite out of it, then we  
went through the field and I felt so  
brave I touched one of the cows and  
it took no notice, so I was never  
frightened of them again.  

Lorena Cassady: Hair Suit (Jane Press,  
753 Walker Ave., Oakland, CA 94610,  
$8.95). Joy Tremewan, producer of a  
radio book program in Memphis, says  
that this “rich and macabre novel rocks  
with undercurrents of terror: of being  
disconnected with life, of nothing mak-  
ing sense.”  

Stella Gibbons: Cold Comfort Farm.  
Long after being captivated by this  
kooky cult classic, I learned that it was a  
send-up of D. H. Lawrence! Available in  
a Penguin paperback.  

Florence King: When Sisterhood Was in  
Flower; Confessions of a Failed Southern  
Lady. Her piece on being unable to get  
through a John Updike book was worth  
the purchase price of the inaugural issue  
of Lear’s.  

Fran Leibowitz: Metropolitan Life; So-  
cial Studies. Fun and catharsis are to be  
had by sharing vicariously in Fran’s bad  
habits. How our paltry grievances fade  
into nothingness in the face of Fran’s  
vast storehouse of contumely toward  
what she finds objectionable or un-  
comfortable!

tini, Loos is a flute full of Veuve Clic-  
quot. The situations may have become  
dated, but not her effervescent word-  
play. This is from Blondes:  

So then his son said to his papa,  
“Why do we not ask the charming  
ladies to go out to Fontainebleau  
to-day?” So his papa said it would  
be charming. So then I said, “How  
are we going to tell you gentlemen  
apart, because if it is the same in  
Paris as it is in America, you would  
both seem to be Monsieur  
Broussard.” So then we got the idea  
to call them by their first name. So  
it seems that his son’s name is Louis  
so Dorothy spoke up and said, “I  
hear they number all of you Louies  
over here in Paris.” Because a girl is  
always hearing someone talk about  
Louie the sixteenth who seemed to  
be in the antique furniture business.  
I mean I was so surprised to hear  
Dorothy get so historical so she may  
really be getting educated in spite of  
everything. But Dorothy told Louie  
he need not try to figure out his  
number because she got it the min-  
ute she looked at him. So it seems  
his papa’s name is Robber, which  
means Robert in French. So  
Dorothy started in to think about  
her 25 francs and she said to Rob-  
ber, “Your mother certainly knew  
her grammar when she called you  
that.”  

Ruth McKenney: My Sister Eileen.  
Stories from this hilarious collection  
were reincarnated as the film of the same  
name with crackerjack comedian  
Rosalind Russell.  

Lorrie Moore: Self-Help; Anagrams.  
Her metaphysical puns and conceits are  
a magnificent last-ditch stand against  
despair.  

Sei Shonagon: Pillow Book. She was a  
contemporary and rival of Japan’s great  
prose writer, Lady Murasaki Shikibu.  
Particularly amusing (although not  
meant as such) are her catalogues of  
“hateful,” “very hateful,” and “most  
hateful” things, which her courtly fas-  
tidiousness finds in abundance:  

One is in a hurry to leave, but  
one’s visitor keeps chattering away.  
If it is someone of no importance,  
one can get rid of him by saying,  
“You must tell me all about it next  
time”; but, should it be the sort of  
visitor whose presence commands  
one’s best behavior, the situation is  
hateful indeed.  

One is just about to be told some  
interesting piece of news when a  
baby starts crying.  

An admirer has come on a clan-  
destine visit, but a dog catches sight  
of him and starts barking. One feels  
like killing the beast.  

One has been foolish enough to  
invite a man to spend the night in  
an unsuitable place — and then he  
starts snoring.  

A gentleman has visited one  
secretly. Though he is wearing a  
tall, lacquered hat, he nevertheless  
wants no one to see him. He is so  
flurried, in fact, that upon leaving  
he bangs into something with his  
hat. Most hateful!  

Sue Townsend: The Diaries of Adrian  
Mole. He is tormented by love-longing  
for his classmate, the lovely Pandora, by  
spots on his face, and by his parents’  
self-centered and unseemly behavior.  
He is a self-styled intellectual who in-  
flicts on the BBC bad poetry written on  
colored papers. He is thirteen-year-old  
Adrian Mole, and his hapless adven-  
tures and sad sack commentaries have  
found their way into more than five mil-  
lion homes in Britain alone.  

Jane Wagner: The Search for Signs of  
Intelligent Life in the Universe. From her  
assertion that “reality is nothing but a  
collective hunch,” to her suspicion that  
language was invented out of “humani-  
ty’s deep need to complain,” to her de-  
piction of 1960s feminists toting candles  
in the shapes of labias, Wagner’s script  
for Lily Tomlin’s one-woman play shows  
a satirical but bemused intellect plowing  
the fertile fields of the human psyche.
