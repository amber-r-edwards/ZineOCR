The Ordeal of Elizabeth  
Vaughan: A Wartime  
Diary of the Philippines  
edited by Carol M. Petillo  

Athens: University of Georgia Press,  
1985, $24.95, 312 pp.  

For students of the diary as a literary  
genre, The Ordeal of Elizabeth Vaughan  
is a treasure. The diarist is an  
American woman who with her  
children was trapped for four years in  
a Japanese internment camp in the  
Philippines. She used her daily  
writings to make sense of her bizarre  
and dehumanizing situation, to  
reassert her civility in a demoralized  
environment, to keep alive her  
obviously sharp sense of observation  
and analysis, and to restructure the  
meaning of her life. The diary became  
her library and her classroom, her  
mentor and her confidant.  

With the Japanese invasion of the  
Philippines, everything in Vaughan’s  
life fell apart. A member of the  
affluent and privileged American  
mercantile community in the  
Philippines, Vaughan had for several  
years enjoyed a life of grace and  
luxury — a beautiful house, a bevy of  
servants, polite company, fine  
clothes, a devoted husband. The war  
and the invasion robbed her of all of  
these. Her husband disappeared;  
throughout the years of her  
internment she was unaware that he  
had died after suffering through the  
“death march” from Bataan.  
Vaughan’s home, her fineries, and her  
security vanished. She was reduced to  
living at subsistence level, struggling  

for food, bereft of privacy, and subject  
to humiliations. She struggled for her  
own survival and for that of her two  
young children. Her coping with the  
vast changes in her life forms the  
drama of this book.  

Vaughan’s diary is made even more  
gripping by the introductory essay  
written by historian Carol Petillo,  
who specializes in the history of the  
Philippines. These prefatory remarks  
set the diarist and the diary into  
context. Petillo shows that Vaughan  
did not conform to the stereotypic  
image of the frivolous colonialist wife  
who is concerned with clothes,  
bridge, parties, and status. Although  
Vaughan may have enjoyed all of  
these, she also demonstrated an  
admirable degree of resilience and  
humanity that cannot fail to impress.  

Trained in journalism at the  
University of Georgia, Vaughan later  
studied sociology at Vanderbilt and at  
the University of North Carolina.  
There she worked on a project  
designed to observe and analyze the  
life of the South and, it was hoped,  
to transform local racial mores. Before  
1936, when she ventured to the Far  
East where she met and married an  
American engineer working in the  
Philippines, Vaughan had taught and  
studied the effect of culture and  
geography on social structure. The  
skills learned in graduate school and  
the insights achieved through her  
work are evident in her diary;  
Vaughan drew on her training as she  
shrewdly observed the day-to-day  
occurrences at the internment camp  
and as she strove to make sense of the  
relations between captive and captor  
and among the captives themselves.

Jonestown  
& Other Madness  
poetry by Pat Parker  

Firebrand Books (141 The Commons,  
Ithaca, NY 14850), 1985, $11.95 (HB),  
$5.95 (PB), 75 pp.  

Pat Parker’s fifth book of narrative  
poems might well have been subtitled:  
how we are treating each other during  
this age of Reagan and the New  
Right, of complacency and reaction.  
“We have become too quiet,” she  
warns, in the face of easy answers  
about the tragedy at Jonestown, the  
Atlanta child murders, and the  
approaching execution of Priscilla  
Ford, who drove her Lincoln  
Continental into a crowd in Reno,  
Nevada. “It is time for those with  
vision to speak loudly before the  
madness consumes us all.”  

Parker's vision is indeed straight  
ahead and piercing. She is concerned  
with the damage that institutional  
racism and homophobia inflicts within  
the lesbian/gay community and within  
the women’s community in general,  
demonstrated in poems like “Bar  
Conversation.” Parker questions the  
correctness of sadomasochism, an  
ongoing controversy: “Did we grapple  
with our own who hated us/ so  
women could use whips and  
chains? . . . Did we take to the  
streets/ so women can carve swastikas  
on their bodies?”  

In “My Brother,” written for the  
gay singer Blackberri, Parker  
remembers the paper boy Claude of  
whom even her father was proud:  
“works hard/ goes to church/ gives his  

money to his mother/ and each  
Sunday/ we would go to church/ and  
there would be Claude/ in his choir  
robes.” Yet this model child was  
beaten and robbed before being  
thrown lifeless in front of a passing  
car by a gang of neighborhood boys  
yelling “Faggot!” She asks, “How  
many cars have you dodged, Berri?”,  
not only cognizant of the homophobia  
within the Black community but also  
the sexism of lesbian audiences who  
are not ready to “take our Black  
Queerness into the face/ of this place  
and say/ Hey, here we are/ a faggot  
and a dyke, Black.” A singer and a  
poet with good news. Jonestown &  
Other Madness, which also includes  
some wonderful love poems, is at once  
lyrical and political. Don’t miss it.

The Spirit’s Pilgrimage  
by Mirabehn  

Great Ocean Publishers (1823 N. Lincoln  
St., Arlington, VA 22207), 1984, $9.95,  
319 pp. Introduction by Barbara Grizutti  
Harrison.  

Madeleine Slade, named “Mirabehn”  
by Mahatma Gandhi, cared  
passionately for two men. In pursuing  
one, Beethoven, she found the other,  
Gandhi, through her friendship with  
author Romain Rolland, who had  
written books on both men.  

In 1925 Mirabehn left her home,  
England, to join Gandhi at his ashram  
in India, where she stayed for the  
next 35 years. (She received one  
admonition from her parents — to be  
careful — but this was no trivial  
move: She belonged to a ruling class  
family; her father was a commander in  
the British Navy.) Becoming Gandhi’s  
servant, confidant, adviser, and loved  
friend, she nursed him, prepared his  
food, taught his first premise of  
nonviolence (self-sufficiency) to  
villagers, represented him abroad,  
went to the 1931 Round Table  
Conference in London with him,  
went to jail with him. What some  

may denigrate as a suppressed love  
affair or relationship based on  
subservience alone is described here as  
a friendship that endlessly served the  
Satyagraha movement. After Gandhi  
was assassinated in 1948, Mirabehn  
continued to work in India until  
1960, when, her life turning full  
circle, she moved to Austria to  
resume her study of Beethoven.  

In telling her own story as much as  
telling the story of Gandhi’s role in  
pushing India toward independence,  
Mirabehn replicates the same devotion  
to Gandhi in this “autobiography” as  
she gave to him in life. Very plainly,  
not beautifully or even skillfully  
written, the book lacks any  
preoccupation with the author’s self or  
with her private revelations. Mirabehn  
gives only cursory mention of the  
sudden death of her sister, for  
example, and likewise of her interest  
in marrying a man who could not  
reciprocate her feelings. But she  
ignores many emotional and personal  
aspects of her life to say instead,  
simply and selflessly, “This is what we  
did.” What she did, always with  
purpose and devotion, is an inspiring  
and beautiful story.

The Story of Avis  
by Elizabeth Stuart Phelps  

New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press,  
1985, $25.00 (HB), $10.00 (PB), 278  
pp. Edited by Carol Farley Kessler.  

The Philadelphia Inquirer began its  
1877 review of Phelps’s novel as  
follows: “The characters are projected  
with greater power and developed  
with a more consummate subtlety  
than in any previous work of the  
author, while there is no want of  
dramatic interest, and the story is  
constructed with a skill that must hold  
the attention of the most superficial  
reader.” The remainder of the review  
criticizes The Story of Avis for its  
“morbid” sentiment. Well, we have  
had 100 years to refine our notion of  
morbidity, and this ornately articulate  
novel is playful; both kind and  
hopeful in its vision of the female/  
male conundrum.  

Avis, at 26, returns from her  
European art studies convinced that  
“marriage is a profession” for which  
she has no aptitude. Her father, a  
philosophy professor, “had long since  

tabulated his daughter as a glittering  
syllogism whose premises were  
incorrect.” But Philip Ostrander is  
driven by his love of this woman to  
teach her the “sweet lesson of love’s  
surrender.” When he returns wounded  
from the Civil War, Avis capitulates.  
“It was his physical ruin and  
helplessness which appealed to the  
strength in her.”  

Here the Bildungsroman, or  
apprenticeship novel, takes on the full  
flavor of the Kunstlerroman, or the  
artist novel, from a woman’s point of  
view. When the fall sewing is done,  
when the baby learns to walk, when  
the housecleaning is over, when the  
company is gone — then the poem  
can be written or the picture painted.  
Just as Mann’s Tonio Kréger might  
speak to a male artist, Phelps speaks  
to women artists in a manner that we  
can readily understand. More than  
this, Phelps’s insights into the  
feminine heart are both touching and  
true. (On wife battering: “It is  
surprising how insecure of foot women  
with drunken husbands, as a class, are  
found to be.”)  

I had intended to speed read The  
Story of Avis. I read every word.

Moll Cutpurse:  
Her True History  
by Ellen Galford  

Firebrand Books (141 The Commons,  
Ithaca, NY 14850), 1985, $15.95 (HB),  
$7.95 (PB), 224 pp.  

Not one to let male accounts of a  
winsome and audacious woman’s life  
gather dust in obscurity, Ellen Galford  
has retold in this clever blend of fact  
and fiction the life of Moll Frith, an  
Elizabethan adventuress who is  
rebellious enough to make suffragettes  
of later generations blush. Pairing  
Moll with Bridget, a fictitious (though  
perhaps not-so-fictitious) lover, and  
telling the story from both points of  
view, Galford journeys the reader  
through Moll’s initial desire to  
become a man (a quest charmingly  
thwarted by Bridget), to her ultimate  
triumph as a woman who lives life on  

her own terms. The novel is filled  
with the famous personages of the  
time, but more engaging are the  
vignettes portraying imagined  
personages — such as Judith  
Shakespeare, whom we last met in  
Woolf's A Room of One’s Own.  
Galford’s Judith manages to  
successfully elude the scorn and  
debauchery of an unsympathetic  
London to live, as do all the spirited  
women in this novel, a life of  
independence and artistry.  

It is particularly refreshing to see  
issues that we moderns are apt to  
regard as belonging exclusively to our  
own time, handled in the context of  
an era more than 300 years removed.  
The ecstasies and agonies of coming  
out as a lesbian, of rejecting  
conventional marriage and living as a  
single woman, and of realizing one’s  
dreams in the patriarchal environment  
are skillfully depicted with tender  
insight and consistently delicious wit.
