®% Belles Lettres Interview &%

Novelist and critic Doris Grumbach's
newest book, published by

E.P. Dutton, is The Ladies. The
story is based on the true account of
two 18th century upper-class Irish
women, Lady Eleanor Butler and Sarah
Ponsonby, who fled their homes to live
together in Wales. In this interview
with Belles Lettres, Grumbach talks
about her work in progress and about
writers and writing.

BL: Where did you first learn about
the ladies of Llangollen?

Grumbach: I think it was in Co-
lette, in The Pure and the Impure. That’s
very inaccurate, but so is my book!
And then I was talking to May Sarton
one day, and she told me about The
Call of the Wild Goose [by Mary Gor-
don], published by Virginia Woolf.
May gave me her copy.

BL: How much did you embellish
their lives?

Grumbach: Well, of course, I
created all the conversations, and
every episode in the book is imagined.
But Eleanor kept a journal for a
number of years. I used that to get
the flavor of the daybook entries. I used
the figures on what they spent for
things, because I had no idea how
much something would cost back then.
About their doubts and their wonder-
ings—if there were others like them
before, and what they were—I simply
imagined that that must have been
true. Likewise, their delight in finding
a love like theirs in the letters of
Madame de Sevigne.

BL: The Ladies must have betrayed
an extraordinary amount of emotion.
Wasn’t it a convention at the time for

women to have “romantic friendships”—
friendships that rarely evolved into
their living together?

Grumbach: At the time, women
wrote romantic letters to each other.
Critics say, “Well, it meant nothing.”
But I’m not sure. I think it was the
sublimation of their love, which had
only the form of letters. Willa Cather
is a prime case. I am persuaded that she
never allowed herself to have an affair.
But that she loved women, we have
ample evidence. She lived with a
woman for forty years, and it may well
have been just a friendship. But she did
passionately love one young woman,
to whom she wrote such burning letters
that Cather insisted they be burned.
She also burned the ones that Isabel
wrote her.

BL: How did you react to the snob-
bery Eleanor showed in her diaries?
Would you have enjoyed meeting the
Ladies?

Grumbach: I would have never got-
ten in! You had to have either a title
or be someone extraordinary in the
literary world—like Wordsworth—
somebody very accomplished, some-
body whose work they knew. They
were great snobs. The sexual snobbery
that the world showed toward them
they reflected in their social snobbery.

BL: In the novel you quote Scott on
the “great and endearing devotion” of
the Ladies. Was this the primary aspect
of the Ladies’ lives that appealed to
you?

Grumbach: What I felt as I was writ-
ing the book, and what I feel about en-
during relationships between women, is
that there is very little difference in
nature between the relationship

Name

women have over a long time and
marriage. I don’t think of marriage in

a legal sense, but of dedicating your life
to another person, staying with them
through thick and thin.

BL: In a broad sense, the novel taps
into a universal fantasy about secluding
oneself with one’s lover forever. But
gay people in particular often feel an
urgent need to escape from family and
society.

Grumbach: Yes, I think that is
peculiar to the gay experience; you're
quite right. They could not live to-
gether the way they could if each of
them had a husband, not in the com-
munity in which they were born. And I
think that is true of many gay people.
They must get away from where they
are because the community is hostile to
their choice. It was particularly true for
Eleanor and Sarah because there was
so much pressure on them to marry
well; and in Sarah’s case, the pressure
was the very unpleasant one of her
uncle. So they knew they had to get
away.

BL: Was this an enjoyable book to
write from the viewpoint of language?

Grumbach: It was. I could really tell
the story in the same tone that they
were speaking, and I found that fun. It
took work, because, although I’ve read
a lot of 18th century novels, in my head
there isn’t a running vocabulary. For-
tunately, I own 16 volumes of the
OED, and I looked up a great deal. I
had to be certain these words were
being used. And while I did that I
would come upon little formulations
that were useful to me. They had
sentences that used the words, and
some of them would turn out to be
serendipitous finds.

BL: Do you write a certain amount
or for a prescribed time every day?

Grumbach: I work every day from
about 7:30 to 2:00. If it comes, it comes,
and if it doesn’t, I do something else.
I’m working on a book about Willa
Cather, and I go from fiction to non-
fiction if one fails—sort of a hedge

against despair. The novel I’m writing
now is about the love affair between
an aging woman and a very young boy.
It’s not like Colette, but it is based on
an affair that I knew about. It’s about
aging and love.

BL: What writers do you envy most?
What writers would you most like to
have met?

Grumbach: The writer that I admire
most and always have is Henry James.

Belles Lettres Subscription Form

I read James all the time. I admire his
enormous capacity for the language,
and I admire the subtlety with which
he gets into characters. I couldn’t write
like him. I don’t have his ability to take
a small thing and make it into a moun-
tain. The writer I enjoy the most is
Mark Twain. I’ve taught him for years,
and I never tire of him. I like a lot of
modern writers—I think Anne Tyler is
a very fine novelist. Besides Henry
James, I wouldn’t have minded meeting
Edith Wharton and talking to her
about House of Mirth. I’m a great ad-
mirer of that book. I would very much
like to have met Virginia Woolf. Then
there’s Gertrude Stein...and Colette. I
loved Chéri and The Last of Chéri.

BL: Although Colette admired the
Ladies, she questioned the lengths they
took to protect their precious “retire-
ment.” In modern terms, they could be
seen as being a little paranoid. I think
that is what Colette was getting at in
her imaginary bed scene when she calls
Eleanor’s protectiveness a “delusion.”
Do you see a negative aspect to their
insularity?

Grumbach: In terms of their charac-
ters, they had all the faults that other
aristocrats had: They were egocentric,
proud, and class-conscious. It’s just
that they happened to be women. It is
true that they seemed paranoid about
the outside world. I don’t know
whether they were or not. It just
seemed to me that two women as vul-
nerable to criticism as they were would
be somewhat paranoid. I think any-
body who lives on the fringe of an

established society with no models to
base their lives on would become some-
what paranoid.

BL: Perhaps that’s something Co-
lette didn’t understand, because she
mostly did what she pleased.

Grumbach: Well, she was a free
spirit. She lived in Paris in the 20th
century, and many things conspired to
make her less concerned. She lived the
life of a music hall actress. She had no
reason to be worried.

BL: The Ladies was published by a
major trade publisher, not by a gay or
feminist press. What do you hope the
general public will respond to in this
story?

Grumbach: I hope they look at it as
a book that says truths about the
homosexual world that make them
more acceptable to the ordinary man
and wife. They are the same kind of
people; they live the same kind of lives.
