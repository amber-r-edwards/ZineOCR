Letter From  

the Editor  

Greetings! You are holding the first number  
of a quarterly review of books by women.  
Beginning with this issue (which inaugurates  
our fourth year), Belles Lettres will have win-  
ter, spring, summer, and fall issues. Don’t  
worry — the subscription price and yearly  
number of pages will remain the same. I hope  
you enjoy the heft of the new issues and the  
expanded features, such as Firsts in Fiction,  
the mystery column by Jane Bakerman, Im-  
pressions, and special sections (like the  
humor and biography reviews in this issue).  
Coming up will be Asian, Hispanic, and  
Appalachian writers, as well as Rediscoveries  
of Fanny Burney and Nora Hoult. Inter-  
viewees will be Maxine Hong Kingston and  
Denise Giardina.  

I have received many comments from  
readers and publishers about our “new look.”  
The credit goes to Darcie Johnston, who laid  
out this issue and the last three while juggling  
a full-time job, two young sons (do they ever  
get heavy!), and a songwriting career. (Her  
contributions are gratis, as are those of all of  
the editors.) Her artistry has bathed our  
pages in color, and her meticulous design is a  
tribute to women’s writing.  

If you received a “mystery” issue in the  
mail, liked it, and are not a subscriber, quick  
— fill out the subscription blank today! And  
if you do subscribe and are moving, send your  
change of address ASAP. The post office will  
not forward bulk mail.  

A beautiful letter concerning my great-  
grandmother came from my second cousin  
Elizabeth Mullaney (a charter subscriber!). It  
was such a moving fragment of rediscovered  
history that I asked her if I could excerpt it. (I  
later found out from my father that Ellen  
Tobin worked as a presser early on in her  
marriage, ironing for twelve hours a day.)  

When you started “Belles” my fa-  
ther told me you had inherited the  
cause of promoting women from  
your great-grandmother, Ellen Tobin  
Mullaney. For the first time ever,  
Pop shared that his mother had  
been active in the support of  
women’s right to vote and had at-  
tended the marches and rallies. Pop  
described the violent reactions of  
the crowd, something omitted in  
our textbooks.  

Ellen Tobin went against her  
husband’s order not to vote the day  
she was able to for the first time.  
Pop said his mother stood in front  
of a mirror putting on her hat and  
said “I’m going, Joe.” Pop never  
forgot that scene, for his mother  
had never been so defiant to his  
father.  

The hoodlums stood on the cor-  
ners of Elmhurst [in Flushing, New  
York] ready to give a hard time to  
any female going to exercise her  
newly won right. James was scared  
because it was just himself and my  
father to protect their mother  
against the community. Pop gave  
James the choice of escorting their  
mother or of dying instantly at  
[Pop’s] hands! How I laughed!  

Pop and James asked their  
mother not to vote but she’d have  
none of it. And so it was Ellen  
Tobin Mullaney walked out the door  
to the polling station with her sons  
Edward and James a few paces be-  
hind her. No one touched or said a  
word to them.  

Until you were starting Belles  
Lettres, I had never heard “Grandma  
was a Suffragette.” Pop said it was a  
scandal in his day, and throughout  
his life the connotation remained,  
so he had never shared it. It struck  
Pop that you, like his mother, were  
out to promote women, and he  
liked it. So much so that, in his  
own words, he took “the skeleton  
out of the closet.” And we laughed  
at that!

Chast included in her new collection, The  
Four Elements (Harper & Row).
