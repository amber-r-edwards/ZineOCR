How Far She Went  
by Mary Hood  

Athens: University of Georgia Press,  
1984, $13.95, 124 pp.  

Mary Hood's landscape, chronicling  
the continuity of life, is full of back  
roads and (not always gracious)  
country folks. A teenaged girl and her  
grandmother are chased in “How Far  
She Went” by a biker with “the  
invading sort of eyes the woman had  
spent her lifetime bolting doors  
against.” In “A Country Girl,” young  
Elizabeth’s life is changed with the  
arrival of Johnny Calhoun,  
“everybody’s kind and nobody's kin,”  
nearing 40 and “wild in the way that  
made him worth the trouble he  
caused.”  

Hood has created a world in which  
powerful, desperate emotions often  

The Invention of Flight  
by Susan Neville  

Athens: University of Georgia Press,  
1984, $12.95, 110 pp.  

Most of these stories are set in the  
Midwest. There is elderly Mrs. D, for  
example, in “Kentucky People.” Still  
spry and energetic, “she looks 20 years  
younger than she is, even in bright  
sunlight. She attributes it to the  
Normans, Merle and Vincent Peale.”  
Nothing tragic has ever clouded her  
path, thus she “shivers with  
excitement” when her neighbor asks  
her to help throw her husband out.  
Alma’s life in “Banquet” has not  
been as blissful. A widow, for years  
she has lived “with only one breast,”  
and her family does not quite know  
how to cope with it. As she nears the  
end of her life, she wants to let them

Rough Translations  
Stories by Molly Giles  

Athens: The University of Georgia Press,  
1985, $13.95, 135 pp.  

Although Molly Giles’s main concern  
in the bulk of these stories — the  
difficulties of communicating with  
others — has been explored by  
countless other writers, her work is so  
fresh it is as if we are encountering  
this territory for the first time. One  
character, the nameless narrator of  
“Pie Dance,” finds that ultimately her  
dog provides the most desirable, easy  
company. In “Planter Box” a nameless  
retired couple copes with the wife’s  
illness. Ever the optimist, the  
husband nurses her and runs the  
household. As he tends the planter  
box, “The whole box suddenly  
reminded him of the illustration from  
the Edgar Allan Poe story, and he saw  
that woman’s hand clawing through,  
bent and hideous in its fight for life,  
terrible, and yet . . . fighting.” He  
thinks that his wife “ought to fight  
too.” But she lies in bed, filled with  
“rage and hatred,” coughing and  
smoking. He claims that she was sent  
home to get better. “You have never,  
she’d told him, faced one second of  
reality . . . . I’m coming home to die  
. . . and the sooner the better.”  

In three stories we follow Joan  

Bartlett and her husband, John, as he

rage just beneath the surface. In  
“Inexorable Progress” (included in Best  
American Short Stories 1984) we  
witness one woman’s inevitable  
journey to suicide, which progresses  
unknown to her family. It begins:  
“There’s not much difference between  
a bare tree and a dead tree in winter.  
Only when the others begin to leaf  
out the next spring and one is left  
behind in the general green onrush  
can the eye tell. By then it’s too late  
for remedy: That’s how it was with  
Angelina.” We last glimpse her in the  
hospital, “clawing at the IV’s in her  
wrists that tethered her to life,” while  
her husband and daughter stare and  
still ask “Why?” There is a deep  
compassion in these consistently  
excellent stories, which remains with  
the reader long after the book has  
been closed.

know what her illness has taught her,  
and what it feels like, but her family  
does not want to talk about it: “each  
one of them positive that he is the  
one human being in the history of the  
earth who will never die.”  

Family life is also the subject of  
“Cousins,” arguably the best story in  
this collection. As the young people  
mature and by necessity grow apart,  
holiday meals become rushed affairs.  
The narrator admits: “Later we will all  
wash our hair to go out with friends.  
When it’s time to leave we feel relief.  
It is a scene we will repeat many  
times.”  

Other stories are not quite as  
captivating, although the power of the  
more effective pieces, such as the  
playfully imaginative “Johnny  
Appleseed” (included in the Pushcart  
Prize IV volume), makes up for the  
ones that disappoint.

Woodcut by J. D. Davidson  

is transformed from an aspiring,  
sensitive composer to a beer-guzzling,  
indifferent stranger. In “Peril,” Joan  
contemplates a number of possible  
scenarios — all tragic. “She thinks all  
these things are going to happen  
soon, before she is ready, if anyone  
can be ready, ever, for disaster.  
Because disaster . . . is always out  
there... . It’s a miracle, she thinks,  
that anything survives at all in this  
world.” We last see Joan, deep in  
thought, watering her carrot bed.  
Then “she looks all around her. No  
one can see. She bows her head. She  
prays.” Like all of Molly Giles’s  
characters, Joan’s humanity is  
achingly palpable. It leaves us hungry  
for more stories about ourselves.

A Society of  

Outsiders  
by Susan S. Lanser  

The New Feminist Criticism: Essays on  
Women, Literature and Theory, edited by  
Elaine Showalter. New York: Pantheon  
Books, 1985, $22.95 (HB), $13.95 (PB),  
403 pp.  

imagines a Society of Outsiders,  

women in but not of their  
professions, whose education at the  
hands of a patriarchy (ironically)  
protects them against certain  
temptations and risks of professional  
life. I evoke Woolf as I read Elaine  
Showalter’s major and most welcome  
anthology, because the question of  
inside and outside, of being locked in  
and locked out, seems essential to a  
collection whose title stakes out an  
entire field. Because The New Feminist  
Criticism is so rich and compelling a  
text, because it is likely to represent  
feminist criticism to a broad audience,  
it leads me to scrutinize the values  
that inform feminist criticism today.  

The anthology has the rare quality  
of being equally rewarding for both  
beginning feminist critics and long-  
standing practitioners. The 18 essays,  
framed by a thoughtful introduction  
and an extensive bibliography,  
represent major formulations of  
feminist criticism as it is practiced in  
American universities. Written  
primarily in the 1980s, the essays form  
a horizontal network that also  
acknowledges those writers and critics  
whose pioneering work has made  
possible this scholarship. Many of the  
essays will be well known to feminist  
critics, who will surely be grateful to  
find them gathered in book form. One  
finds, for example, addresses by  
Carolyn Heilbrun and Sandra Gilbert  
to the profession at large; critical  
re-visions by Annette Kolodny, Susan  
Gubar, Nina Baym, Elaine Showalter,  
and Nancy Miller; and essays by  
Barbara Smith, Deborah McDowell,  
and Bonnie Zimmerman that  
challenge the White and heterosexual  
biases not only of masculinist criticism  
but of feminist criticism as well.  

Together these essays disarm  
patriarchal objections to feminist  
scholarship, dismantle traditional  
notions of the literary canon and  
thereby recover once excluded works,  
and raise (most excitingly in the  
essays by Jane Tompkins and Lillian  
Robinson) the complex issue of  
evaluating literature. Together the  
essays try to codify the theoretical  
underpinnings of Anglo-American,  
feminist critical practice; Showalter’s  
“Feminist Criticism in the Wilderness”  
and Kolodny’s “Dancing Through the  
Minefield” are especially  
comprehensive in this regard.  
Together the essays reread important  
texts, mainly texts by women —  
Uncle Tom’s Cabin (Tompkins), “The  
Yellow Wallpaper” and “A Jury of Her  
Peers” (Kolodny), Sula (Smith and  
McDowell), La Princesse de Cleves  
(Miller) — in ways that readily yield  
new understandings of other texts as  
well.  

Through their varied voices and  
concerns, the essays begin to  
articulate the vast challenge that  
feminist criticism poses to literary  
scholarship. At the same time, the  
essays bear deep similarities, so that  
the singularity of the title — the  
feminist criticism — becomes true in  
perhaps unintended ways, reinforcing  
an illusion of greater unanimity than  
actually exists. I am concerned about  
the anthology on three counts. First, I  
think it underrepresents French-  
American feminist criticism — that  
body of American academic  
scholarship, grounded in the values  

|: Three Guineas, Virginia Woolf  

and methods of French post-  
structuralism, which has made a  
contribution to feminist criticism  
larger than two essays (by Nancy K.  
Miller and Ann Jones) accommodate.  
Second, it might be important to  
question feminist theory itself, for  
example, through Nina Baym’s “The  
Madwoman and Her Languages: Why  
I Don’t Do Feminist Literary Theory.”  
I am concerned also that some of the  
deeper challenges that feminist  
criticism is able to pose, not only to  
literary studies but to cultural politics  
in general, are largely absent here.  

This absence stems, I think, from  
the book’s wholly academic definition  
of feminist criticism. Although the  
introduction acknowledges that  
“feminist criticism developed as part of  
the international women’s  
movement,” that fact is here figured  
as part of history. This may be why in  
only one section of the anthology,  
notably plural in title (“Feminist  
Criticisms and Women’s Cultures”),  
does one find the contributions and  
concerns of Black and lesbian critics,  
who are outsiders from within feminist  
criticism itself. If Terry Eagleton is  
right to suggest that certain radical  
and transformative thinking simply  
cannot be inscribed in traditional  
academic discourse, it may not be  
accidental that it is in the writings of  
“sisters/outsiders” that one finds the  
strongest, often the most disturbing  
challenges of all.  

How valuable it would be, then,  
for this book to include, in its section  
on the canon, Alice Walker’s “One  
Child of One’s Own”; to end with the  
challenge of Audre Lorde’s  
provocative “The Master’s Tools Can  
Never Dismantle the Master’s House”;  
or to reprint with “Dancing Through  
the Minefield” the very provocative  
responses of Rena Grasso Patterson,  
Judith Kegan Gardiner, and Elly  
Bulkin that appeared in Feminist  
Studies? Such writings are often  
excluded from the definition of  
“feminist criticism,” marginalized as  
“nonacademic,” “noncritical,” or  
“polemical.” To the extent that those  
of us who practice feminist criticism  
in the academy are and must remain  
on the inside, I believe we need that  
Society of Outsiders who are freer  
than ourselves.  

The New Feminist Criticism stands,  
then, as a double sign. It is a major  
contribution to a field growing in  
scope and depth, and it will certainly  
help to extend feminist criticism  
within the academy. At the same  
time it also signifies the need for  
feminist criticism to become that  
space which locks no one out.
