Alma Maters  

Although many of our best writers have flourished without pursuing a formal  
course of higher education, others have attended colleges and universities while  
writing and learning to write. For this puzzle, match the writer with her alma mater.  
(Note: some of these writers attended more than one school; in such cases, we have  
chosen only one of the institutions to include.)  

. Anne Sexton a. University of Western Ontario  

. Nikki Giovanni b. Mississippi State College for Women  

. Margaret Atwood c. University of Toronto  

. Joan Didion d. Mount Holyoke Female Seminary  

. Eudora Welty e. Garland Junior College  

. Katherine Mansfield f. University of California, Berkeley  

. Emily Dickinson g. Ohio State University  

. Alice Munro h. Fisk University  

. Cynthia Ozick i. Queens College, London  

Letter From the Editors  

Dear Readers,  

The two questions we are asked  
most frequently about Belles Lettres are  
“Why are you starting this review?”  
and “What is your editorial stance?”  
So we would like to share with you the  
why and the what.  

We would be naive if we failed to  
acknowledge that there would be no  
pressing need for a publication such as  
Belles Lettres if women writers had  
always had the same freedom to write  
and critical acknowledgement for it as  
have men. Yet we are here for cele-  
bration, not for reparation. Times have  
changed since Charles Tansley, in To  
the Lighthouse, bespoke the times in his  
belittling remark “women can’t paint,  
women can't write.” In today’s fertile  
soil, superb women writers are spring-  
ing up like wildflowers. Accolades are  
being paid to new and well-established  
writers alike—Louise Erdrich, Ellen Gil-  
christ, Jamaica Kincaid (featured in  
this issue), Eudora Welty, and Alison  
Lurie are just a few who have recently  
received prestigious awards. But, to  
borrow a phrase from Mrs. Willy  
Loman, even more “attention must be  
paid.”  

Among the masses of books pub-  
lished yearly by hundreds of presses,  
many good books fail to reach their  
audience. Readers deserve to know  
about the fine women writers being  
published and reissued, especially by  
small publishers, to whom we owe a  
debt of gratitude for their commitment  
to publishing quality titles by women.  
Furthermore, critics need a forum in  
which to assess the achievements of  
contemporary women writers and to  
reevaluate the reputations of many  
women writers of the past as major  
figures, not sublunary lights, of their  
literary periods.  

Gore Vidal did this in an essay  
championing Edith Wharton as fully  
the equal of Henry James, and recent  
scholarship has reassessed the direction  
of the influence between Hilda Doo-  
little and her fellow Imagists. Carolyn  
Heilbrun, in her review of the latest  
Woolf biography, made this welcome  
and telling observation: “Virginia  
Woolf is beginning to be seen, in  
academic circles, as the central  
modern figure she is: the masculinist  
bias of English departments, which has  
led to the elevation of Joyce as the pre-  
eminent modern figure may soon begin  
to abate.” In this issue of Belles Lettres,  
Cathie Brettschneider points out a  
similar reinterpretation of who influ-  
enced whom in her review of the new  
biography of Lou Andreas-Salome,  
intimate friend of Freud, Rilke, and  
Nietzsche. In our September issue,  
Djuna Barnes scholar Mary Lynn Broe  
will no doubt have some provocative  
things to say about Barnes and stylistic  
influence vis-à-vis Joyce, Eliot, and  
Pound.  

As regards our editorial stance, we  
have said that “feminism informs  
rather than dictates our criticism.” By  
this we mean that we do not believe  
that any one critical theory should be  
imposed upon a work but that every  
work should be read and judged within  
its proper context. Feminism is one  
among many contexts. Since our pur-  
pose is to explore and celebrate writing  
by women, our viewpoint is naturally  
feminist.  

Will Belles Lettres be “scholarly” or  
“popular?” The answer is both. You  
will see as you read through this issue  
that we review trade, university, and  
small press titles as well as first-pub-  
lished, established, and minority  
writers. We are committed to publish-  
ing reviews that are well written and  
founded on quality scholarship, and  
that are entertaining as well.  

It has truly been a delight putting  
together this preview issue. We are  
eager to hear from reviewers, puzzle  
makers, cartoonists, readers, and sub-  
scribers as we prepare Volume 1,  
Number 1. We have said that today’s  
soil is more fertile. Belles Lettres has  
been sown, and now we ask you to  
help it flourish.  

Sincerely,  

Janet Palmer Mullaney
