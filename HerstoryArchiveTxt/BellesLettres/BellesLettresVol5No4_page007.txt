A Gallery of Women Artists

@ Below left and right: artist Joanne Brigham and cover art from Exposures:  
Women & Their Art, color photographs by Kenna Love; text by Ann Brown and  
Arlene Raven (New Sage Press, P.O. Box 41029, Pasadena CA 91114, 1989). This  
is an unbelievably wonderful book from the woman-owned publisher who gave us  
Women and Work. The wealth and diversity of women artists will exhilarate you  
(and the photographs of artists with their art are works of art in themselves). A  
“genuine American sampler," the book offers a cross-section of fifty artists (even  
performance artists, neon artists, and “found art” artists). Joanne Brigham,  
featured with her son and one of her paintings, was impressed by the similarities a  
fellow artist pointed out between her surrealist-tinged works and the paintings of  
the great Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, hitherto unknown to Brigham. "She credits  
the rising feminism in the arts with giving her the strength to persevere."
