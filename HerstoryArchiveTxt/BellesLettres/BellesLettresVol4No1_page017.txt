our strong poets. Four poets who

speak out of a breadth of female

experience and vision. Each has a
particular voice and uses it without
looking back. Levertov and Piercy espe-
cially move through a broad range of
concerns, listening to the inner sound-
ing as well as to the larger, more political
concerns. Yet perhaps the only particu-
larity these poets share is that energy of
naming that emerges from each one’s
commitment to a retrieval of memory;
and, truly, few strong women poets to-
day do not share this.

At times one senses a strangely bitter
(or wistful?) resignation in the “being
woman” of Gallagher’s poems. Her
opening title, “Kidnaper,” seems to set
the mood for much of the book: “He is
lost. I believe him. It seems / he calls my
name. I move / closer. He says it again,
the name / of someone he loves. I step
back pretending / not to hear. I suspect
/the street he wants / does not exist, but I
am glad to point / away from myself.”

Certainly there are moments in this
collection in which the poet’s own craft
changes the weight she displaces, pulls
her to full height in lines such as these on
which we enter “Beginning to Say No”:
“BEGINNING TO SAY NO/ is not to
offer so much as a first, is / to walk away
firmly, as though / you had settled some-
thing foolish, / is to wear a tarantula in
your buttonhole / yet smile invitingly,
unmindful / how your own blood grows
toward the irreversible / bite. No, I will
not / go with you. No, that is not / al-
right. I’m not your sweet-dish, your /
home-cooking, good-looking daf- /
fodil.” The lines are perfectly broken.
Craft and meaning are one.

What about Tess Gallagher’s retriev-
al of memory? In “Ritual of Memories,”
as in other poems, she does it through a
male counterpart: “you came up / like a
man pulling himself out of a river.” And
she tells him: “Remember, it was a
country road / above the sea and I was
passing / from the house of a friend. Look
/ into these eyes where we met. / I saw
your mind go back through the years /
searching for that day and finding it,
/you washed my eyes / with the pure wa-
ter / so that I vanished from that road
/and you passed a lifetime / and I was not
there.”

Memory is retrieved in Denise Lever-
tov’s Breathing Water, and there are
moments of connection with Gall-
agher’s voice; but Levertov is both
stronger and wilder, more explosively
contained and — when she lets go —
more dazzling. Speaking, as well, of
travelers and rivers, of the woman’s life
in its deepening reflection, she says:
“ ‘You give me / my life,’ she said to the
just-written poems, / long-legged foals
surprised to be standing ... But the
traveler’s words / are leaven. They work
in the poet. / The river swiftly / goes on
braiding its heavy tresses, / brown and
flashing, / as far as the eyes can see.”
Levertov takes risks also in her line
breaks and juxtaposition of language.

Particularly moving are a series of
poems written to friends who have died
young, or a sister who may be dead only
in her relationship to what we under-
stand as the world. I am referring to “In
Memory: After a Friend’s Sudden
Death,” “Missing Beatrice,” and “To
Olga.” The reverent physicality of the
first poem is as successful as any I have
read. In “To Olga,” as in so much of
Levertov’s work, the poem ends once,
then again — and perhaps yet again.
The poet takes another risk and wins.

Death is her terrain, as well, in “During
a Son’s Dangerous Illness.” The in-
comprehensible fact of a child dying be-
fore a parent becomes a brilliant meta-
phor for the unanswerable question:
“Parent, child — death ignores / proto-
col, a sweep of its cape brushes / this one
or that one at random / into the dust; it
was / not even looking. / What becomes
/ of the past if the future / snaps off, brit-
tle, / the present left as a jagged edge
opening on nothing?“

This poet has been around for a
while; she has published seventeen fine
books of poetry before this one. She
consistently reveals a fierceness crafted
to perfection yet clothed in a particular
enigmatic intention understandably dif-
ficult to label or contain. Recently, one
critic termed her “Christian” (with a
capital C). I disagree. Perhaps the best
disavowal comes from a poem in this
new collection: “Much moves in and out
of open windows / when our attention is
somewhere else, / just as our souls move
in and out of our bodies sometimes. /
Everyone used to know this, / but for a
hundred years or more / we’ve been los-
ing our memories” (“Window-Blind”).

In Levertov’s coming to terms with
memory, she is clear about how and why
it is ripped from us. For me, her most

memorable work combines her fine-
tuned human sensibility with what some
would call more political concerns, as in
“Every Day” and “Carapace.” And I
would like to quote a third, “Poet Pow-
er,” in full:

Riding by taxi, Brooklyn to
Queens, .

a grey spring day. The Hispanic
driver,

when I ask, “Es usted Mexicano?”
tells me

No, he’s an exile from Uruguay.
And I say,

“The only other Uruguayan I’ve
met

was a writer — maybe

you know his name? —

Mario Benedetti?“

And he takes both hands

off the wheel and swings round,
glittering with joy: “Benedetti!
Mario Benedetti!”

There are

hallelujahs in his voice —

we execute a perfect

figure 8 on the shining highway,
and rise aloft, high above traffic,

flying
all the rest of the way in the blue
sky, azul, azul!

“Making Peace” is another of these po-
ems where the internal and not-so-
external-as-we-might-hope planes
merge and function as a whole. “Peace,
not only / the absence of war” she de-

mands, and Linda Pastan’s “Grudnow”
(The Imperfect Paradise) echoes Lever-
tov’s contention that peace is so hard to
imagine “for it has not been experienced
in the reality of our life in history except
as the absence of war.”

Pastan says of her grandfather: “He
left, I heard him say, / because there was
nothing there. / I understood what he
meant / when I saw the photograph / of
his people standing / against a landscape
emptied / of crops and trees, scraped raw
/ by winter.” That poem ends: “He al-
ways / sipped his tea through a cube of
sugar / clenched in his teeth, the way / he
sipped his life here, noisily, through all
he remembered / that might have been
sweet in Grudnow.”

Throughout The Imperfect Paradise
Pastan is consistently retrieving mem-
ory. What she does with it when she
brings it up, however, bears little resem-
blance to what Gallagher or Levertov
do. In “Snapshot of My Mother at 15,”
Pastan says: “Sometimes in photographs
/ or deep in mirrors / I sense a disturbance
/in the molecules — a flick / of the past
or the future/. .. My surgeon father
/could peel back membranes . . . / like
my mother turning down / a bed.” Un-
fortunately, she takes a rather easy out:
“There are depths whose measure we
only guess.”

Memory is also one of the leitmotifs of
“At Xian,” and, more successfully, of
“Song of the Hypochondriac.” In the
latter, Pastan admits: “The book is pain,
/ and as I turn / its pages / words fly out
like dark / moths: / Embolism ... /
Cardiac ... / Metastasis. / Now the

parts / of the body speak, each / in its
own dialect, / having in common / only
memory.” The poem continues in an
evocative counterpoint between what
we are and what we are afraid to be:
“Explore us, / beg the breasts, /
trembling. / Wind me, says/ the clock / in
the wrist. / Try to swallow, / whispers the
throat, / starting to close.” But the poem
wanders off, leaving us dissatisfied: “I go
to bed / under the weight of everything
that could happen.”

“Ars Poetica” is an interesting varia-
tion on this common theme. Part
Three, “Rejection Slip,” is worth quot-
ing in full: “Darling, though you know / I
admire your many / fine qualities / you
don’t fill all my needs / just now, and
besides / there’s a backlog / waiting to fit
/in my bed.” Pastan’s book ends strongly
with a series called “The Imperfect Para-
dise.” :

Of the four books, my favorite is
Marge Piercy’s Available Light. Piercy
has been giving us essential poems for as
long as she has also been chronicling our
discoveries of self and world in her nov-
els. Work, solidarity, issues of sexism
and racism, the vital and necessary con-
nections, all are a part of her language.
As with Levertov, memory is a physical
place, to be risked and conquered. And
in her poems Piercy will not leave us
until she has conquered, often bringing
us up short in recognition.

“Hard Time,” as in one of Alice
Walker’s poems, uses the diamond as a
metaphor for the exploitation of the
Black South African worker. “Do you
know / where diamonds come from?” she
asks, “Whose suffering is this you wear
glinting at your ear / winking from your
finger? How many / children’s eyes shine
in it?. . ./Call it a diamond. Call it the
heart of a people.” And she ends: “This

is not a jewel / I would wear lightly. / This
is not a jewel / I would wear.”

Piercy takes bits and pieces of a sys-
tem’s popular culture, along with the
sickness of its social conditioning and
the formal conservatism of its fear, and
carves metaphors that keep us stumbling
upwards in an ever ascendant spiral of
discovery. She uses humor. She uses
courage. She covers a wide field with the
configuration of her line. She takes risks
and almost always comes out winning.
In her own field, she takes a few shots:
“To please a critic you should write lit-
tle, / a book every ten years. That shows
how hard / you work, slow as a glacier
advancing, / and critics, who may wish
to write / sometimes lying in bed in the
morning, / can justify abstention” (from
“The Fecund Complain They Are Not
Honored”).

She writes greatly about our woman-
ness, what it is to be woman, and she
confronts the ignorant and subversive
eye to eye. “Loving the Crone” speaks
well of woman's aging. In “Something
To Look Forward To” she addresses
menopause, as she once addressed
women’s work and rape in earlier poems,
relentless though humble, without easy
sentiment, illuminating all the dark
corners. “Wrong Monday” is also, in
that way, a woman’s poem, and here
Piercy engages us as well with her taut
humor:

First the alarm is mute. Forgot the

plunger.

I discover the milk is sour right

after

I pour it on cereal. I pad

to the door stepping into what the

cat

threw up. I clean the floor and

then

my hands smell bad. ‘Washing them

I splash my blouse and have to

change.

After driving for an hour I remem-
ber

I forgot to pack underwear and the

speech

I’m paid to give. The next sign

I see is ROAD CONSTRUCTION

NEXT 144 MILES. At that mo-

ment

stalled in traffic, my period starts.

And, as with the other poets re-
viewed here, Piercy deals in memory.
She does so differently from Levertov,
more persuasively than either Gallagher
or Pastan. In “How Divine Is Forgiving”
she says: “We forgive those who be-
trayed us / years later because memory
has rotted / through like something left
out in the weather / battered clean then
littered dirty / in the rain.” And towards
the end of the same poem: “We forgive
mostly not from strength / but through
imperfections, for memory / wears trans-
parent as a glass with the pattern /
washed off, till we stare past what in-
jured us. / We forgive because we too
have done / the same to others easy as a
mudslide; / or because anger is a fire that
must be fed / and we are too tired to rise
and haul a log.” Piercy is a beautiful
gatherer-in, crafting her endings in in-
telligent flesh.

One reads Piercy’s poetry, takes the
new collections as entities, and rejoices
in the way she chooses and orders, at the
way each poem sings in the whole, at
how the book is made. Elsewhere she has
spoken about how she has refused to in-
clude even an obviously fine poem for
years, waiting until it fits precisely into a
collection. And so her books are also
places, where everything happens as it
should. With a powerful new volume in
hand, there is always the question: Will
we find a poem in this book as good as “A
Work of Artifice” or with the staying
power of “Rape Poem”? Yes. “Perfect
Weather,” “I Saw Her Dancing,” and
“Maggid” are such poems, as is “Burial by
Salt,” about her mother and father. By
every poetic measure, Available Light is a
leap forward for Piercy.
