A View of Boston Common

by Merrill Joan Gerber

Lalia’s office window looked directly upon  
Boston Common and across to the great gold  
dome of the statehouse. (When she wrote her  
mother about this vista, her mother, who  
lived in Florida, sent her back an old Saturday  
Evening Post cover which boasted Lalia’s very  
view. “You are a lucky girl,” her mother  
wrote. “A very lucky girl.”)

Lalia supposed she was lucky; she hoped  
so. She was newly married (six months) and  

she had been engaged before college gradua-  

tion, an essential requirement of being lucky  
in the late 50s. She had even had a year of  

graduate school in English on a fellowship  
before she took her present job as “edit  
assistant” at Parker Publishing House.  
That too was luck: for an English major  
in publishing. Of course, she  

preferred to stay on in school.  

But all her girlfriends were marrying  
husbands through a plan. Her pay was  

Cromie, a pint-sized  
professor, now  
apologized that  
office to give back.  
offices were on

was as typing. He wrote

rested on his temples. He was an ambitious

her as he typed, not once  
face. “Let’s face it, Lalia,  
as any student here. Your  
grades are as good. You say you want me to  
recommend you for the PhD fellowship. But  
even if the English department here  
needs those fellowships. You’re only a  
student, you have other options. No, I’m  
not going to recommend you for going on. If  
you pass your orals, you'll get a terminal MA.  
If you don’t pass your orals, which as you  
know is a distinct possibility, you’re plain  
out of luck, my dear. That’s just the way it has  
to be.” She waited for more, but there was  

the ringing of his carriage return bell.  
She made her way back to her dorm in the snow,  
decided she would simply not take her  
orals. She believed he would never pass her  
and would not allow him to humiliate her  
as she walked down the hill to her room,  

*308, and the man beside her in his black top  

coat, his plaid muffler carelessly  
wrapped around his neck, moved through the blackness.  

Lalia never made her own lunch in the morn-  

ing. She came from side to side while Lalia followed  
behind him, her arms out as if to catch him  
should he fall backwards. Once in  
the outside with the sky  
whirling by, she walked  
on her own and he went his. Scones, j  
left him, Lalia  

thought of a car crash  
too. She was embarrassed.  

She tucked into  
down her lunch,  
longer first.  

From down the hall she heard  
typewriters and chatter of  
students from the art department. The  
students wore outfits to work as often as they could afford  
to, and when she listened to their exchanges  
she heard mostly gasps of admiration.  
“Where did you get that dress? How much  
did you pay for it? Don’t tell me!”  

Lalia couldn’t do it. She simply couldn’t  
join them. In any case, they ignored her be-  

cause she wore penny loafers, while they wore stockings and  
stiletto heels. One day Mr. Cromie called her  

aside. “You shouldn’t walk around in  
those shoes,” he said. “You shouldn’t be  

wearing those.”  

“Perhaps.”  

Lalia was Cromie’s student.  

She had children, due

two-minute waiting period when  
the ground drilled and shook  
into being.  

Lalia waited patiently. She had no work on  
her desk in the office. There was no reason to  
leave this spot. She waited, holding the icy  
silver container. When the strip of pictures  
came sliding down the chute she was there to  
catch it. In the first frame The Great Man was  
kissing the blonde. In the second, The Great  
Man was sticking out his tongue quite fool-  

ishly at her. She hadn’t  

peered puzzled, at Lalia through his window  
and glanced back.  

She had a job now,  
school, you know?  
She nodded, staring at the
