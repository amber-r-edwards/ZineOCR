Essays by Nancy Mairs

“Nancy Mairs’s unacceptant, insistent re-
examination and revaluation of self,
language, and ideas —a central strategy
of feminist thought —brings the reader
exhilarated through a series of risks
worth taking.” —Ursula K. Le Guin

“These essays are not only honest,
searingly so, they are witty, immensely
readable, and they pay no homage to
that imprisoner of female lives, the
appropriate.” —Carolyn Heilbrun

Feminism for the Health of It

Weaving together her unique tumor, word
creations, and astute analysis, former NOW President
Wilma Scott Heide moves beyond social critique to
offer feminism as a values transformation in language,
higher education, research, activism, health care,
economics, the media, and international policy. Nine
visionary essays; index.

164 pages, $8.95

Literary or publishing-minded people to be staff members,
volunteers, or interns for Belles Lettres. No, this is not the kind of
ad you read in the New York Review of Books. And this is not the
same kind of publication. We can’t offer you walks in the woods,
your favorite cuisine, or candlelight dinners. We can’t even offer
you a salary. We can offer you the opportunity to help bring forth
a publication that you can call your own. As a staff member or
volunteer you will take an active role in writing, editing, public
relations, keyboarding, typesetting, design, layout, fulfillment, or
distribution. If you want to gain knowledge and experience to
further your career or to receive college credit, apply for an on-
site internship. We pay a percentage of funds raised for advertising
sales, fundraising, and grant writing. You need not live in the area
to fulfill many of these roles. We are looking for people who have
publication skills to share. We are also looking for people who
have a serious interest in publishing and want to be trained. As
writer William Allen discovered when, as a youth, he tried to
become unique by balancing a broom on his finger for the Guinness
Book of World Records, “Talent helps all right, but in the end
what matters is still old-fashioned desire fostered by proper atti-
tude.” So if you have literary or publishing skills or knowledge —
OR — if you have desire and the proper attitude, write to the
editors, enclosing vita or resume, at P.O. Box 987, Arlington, VA
22216, or call (301) 294-0278 or (703) 524-7743.
