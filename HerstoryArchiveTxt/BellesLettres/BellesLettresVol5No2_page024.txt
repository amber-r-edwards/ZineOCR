“A LITERARY TREASURE-CHEST...

... Here is not just one voice, but many—all lifted in a
collective song of work, commitment and exhortation
to pass it on.” — The Women’s Review of Books

THE SCHOMBURG LIBRARY OF
NINETEENTH-CENTURY BLACK
WOMEN WRITERS series, under the

general editorship of Henry Louis Gates, Jr., has
rescued the voice of an entire segment of the
African-American literary tradition by offering
volumes of compelling and rare works of fiction,
poetry, autobiography, biography, essays, and
journalism written by nineteenth-century

black women.

“Extraordinary.... This magnificent project will
dramatically change the landscape of African-
American cultural history.”
—Eric J. Sundquist,
The New York Times Book Review

“What an astonishing gift... this collection is!”
—Alice Walker

“The collaboration among The Schomburg Center,
Oxford University Press, and these exceptional
scholars is an extraordinary event... but the
collection is a spectacular achievement.”
—Toni Morrison

“Reading the nineteenth-century black women
writers [these rising scholars] bring us in The
Schomburg Library, I feel as if we were watching a
gigantic ebony figure being unearthed. It is a
woman writing.”
—The Washington Post Book World
