Unfinished Painting, winner of  
the Lamont Prize for the most  
distinguished second book of  
poems of 1988, reveals Mary Jo Salter as  
a gifted formalist who takes the erotic  
beyond the body’s boundaries. She is  
interested, particularly, in representa-  
tions of the body as they cast a nimbus  
that suggests an ultimate otherness. In  
“The Rebirth of Venus” a sidewalk art-  
ist’s chalk drawing reveals  

a view of centuries coming unbracketed,  
as if the gates  

might swing wide to admit, here, in the  
sun,  

one humble man into the pantheon  

The dream and the divination of artful  
desire continue. She reminds us that the  
work of art does not, after all, last so very  
long; the dream of it proves longest. The  
artist’s chalk drawing won’t survive the  
afternoon:  

it’s clear enough the rain  

will swamp her like a tide, and lion-  
hearted  

he'll set off, black umbrella sprung again,  

envisioning faces where the streets have  
parted.  

The title poem examines the meaning of  
a mother’s half-finished portrait of her  
son. The incomplete and less-than-per-  
fect attain poignance in this collection.  
The mother has little confidence in her  
art, yet her child realizes its significance:  

Who (she must have asked) would care?  
He does: that finished head conveys  
still to him how, sought in a crowd  

a loved one stands apart — he’s taller,  
comes in a different shade.  

As in her first collection, poems in  
Unfinished Painting refer to her experi-  
ences in Japan. In “A Case of Netsuke,”  
Salter sees human order reflected within  
an artful microcosm. Like Marianne  
Moore, she views in animals, here  
carved in ivory and wood, moral views  
and attitudes that are “intimately fami-  
liar.” “Thwarted Rat-Catcher” suggests  
yet another principle of being and mak-  
ing:  

The gift,  

he chides himself, is to be swift  

and tireless; to hit on a connection —  
not just to pummel the rat but tell  

the whole tale in a nutshell.  

“Elegies for Etsuko” dramatizes in nine  
parts the loss of a friend who hanged  
herself at the age of twenty-eight. An  
elegy for Salter’s mother, “Dead Let-  
ters,” closes the collection. Together  
these poems act as twin poles through  
which Salter contemplates relationship,  
motherhood (her young friend was also a  
mother), memory, and loss.  

Salter’s poems are amply concerned  
with time — how it runs out, how our  
perceptions of it founder, how the awed  
attention which a young child receives,  
in time, must end. In “Summer 1983,”  
she writes,  

None of us remembers these, the days  

when passing strangers adored us at first  
sight,  

just for living, or for strolling down the  
street,  

praised all our given names; begged us to  
smile. . .  

You, too, in a little while,  

my darling, will have lost all this,  

asked for a kiss will give one, and learn  

how love dooms us to earn  

love once we can speak of it.  

This is a book, too, of family pleasures  
— of affection for a daughter and a hus-  
band, “Aubade for Brad” exhibits a witty

sexual gloss that the poem’s form em-  
phasizes:  

Darling, if you'll untie  

Your shoes again and lie  

for a moment here, while the sun turns  
all to gold,  

I may grow very bold.  

While the poem may display a coyness  
absent from the other collections under  
review, it presents in some measure Sal-  
ter’s characteristic tone: an affectionate  
levity that can suddenly turn “bold” and  
surprising. Yet a number of poems end  
on expected notes, closing with rhymes  
that take the edge off the unique con-  
nections she seeks: “died/amplified,”  
“tell/nutshell,” “gray/away,” “curl/girl,”  
“despite/write.” Such insistent rhymes  
cause some poems to halt prematurely.  

The collection coheres through its  
meditations on creating, particularly the  
making of the artful image — whether or  
not it survives time or is complete — and  
the artful maintenance of familial and  
friendly relations.  

Green the Witch-Hazel Wood, a win-  
ner in the 1988 National Poetry Series,  
bears a radiant, storybook quality. Ele-  
ments that in a poet less gifted than  
Emily Hiestand might seem overly pre-  
cious — princes and dark woodlands —  
are legitimately part of this poet’s interi-  
or landscape. Juxtaposed with images  
from other rhetorical fields and coun-  
tered by conversational ease, Hiestand’s  
work has a peculiar power.  

This poet aspires to a Wallace  
Stevens-like palette. The result is writ-  
ing embedded with multiple colors: po-  
etry that is like a rich fruitcake. In  
“These Are For Your Consideration,”  
she announces her project: one after  
another mysterious place or object is  
introduced, each charged with new en-  
ergies: a forest, a boy, a “mystery play  

. a holy landscape.” Finally we are  

left with a common orange, defamiliar-  
ized for us until it generates significant  

attention:  

Here is a holy landscape, the village  
enclosed  

by walls with helter-skelter angles so both  

sides of the tiny houses and walls are  
visible—  

a world that a god would see looking  
down  

that day on the town — the way a god  
sees  

both sides of all the human choices.  

Here is an orange that fits in the palm of  
your hand with segments like maps, and  
sweet, and hard.  

Hiestand’s is a large collection that  
could have benefited from some culling,  
in that certain poems suggest an earlier  
period in her development. The best  
poems, however, experiment with  
scale, expanding and shrinking scenes  
until images achieve potency. The  
drama of scale is played out, for in-  
stance, in “Hearing Voices”:  

We are carving goat cheese  

from grey gauze rinds and I’m seeing  

medieval cities, both sides of walled  
cities,  

and Renaissance perspective with comely  
spaces.  

Unlike the endings of too many con-  
temporary poems — poems that con-  
clude with sighs, variously wistful or  
deflated — Hiestand’s poems end with  
images that reveal relationships. She  
closes not with a click but with a new  
image. “The Generous Fish” is represen-  
tative:  

With lures we’re bound for the wrinkled  
stream,  

the plume of smoke that lifts from leafy  
woods  

as innumerable questions blink over  
bowlines,  

half-hitches, as in the thin pan, a sizzle—  

and the generous fish shrinks to a  

mouthful.  

Her interior world, forested and encas-  
tled, is countered by her focus on an ex-  
terior realm, botanical and sexual in  
“Amazonas,”  

You've got your cream-nut trees, your  
purple hearts,  

garlics of huge proportions and figs.  

On the floor, swank ferns wax eloquent  

and panicles of males scent the glades,  

floriferous in the extreme. Plumlike  
blooms.  

A sensuality, an unabashed play with  
language often renders her work distinc-  
tive:

...she leaves like the are of our moon,  

in phases from full to new, her deckled  
gibbous sedge  

waning, confounding, clerking and  
blurring the line  

from being to non in a motion so fine  
one wants a finer scope,  

the pure “O” of oculus to ring her dried  
and radiant seas.  

Just as her first poem ended with an  
image of an orange — that golden globe  
and segmented map for Hiestand — her  
final poem (“These I Have Loved”)  
closes with another related fruit and the  
poem itself as a Hopkins-like pied  
beauty:  

Take a good look at this tangerine,  

poles shrink like the moon of a violent  
giant,  

puckered at the navel like an old mouth,  

rumpled, stippled, flecked, dotted and  
pricked,  

patchy, pointillist and strewn with color:  

this is the world that is squeezed  

until the skin snaps and juice dribbles  
out.  

Jana Harris’s The Sourlands stands at a  
remove from these other collections in  
that this poet is primarily engaged in  
storytelling. Her work is the most direct  
and accessible of those under review.  
The Sourlands is divided into two sec-  
tions, “Shipwrecked in Useless Bay” and  
“The Bad Daughter Poems.” The Sec-  
tions’ titles suggest Harris’s focus on not  
simply the negative virtues — pride ex-  
ists in a certain uselessness and even  
more so, perhaps, in bad daughters —  
but also in a resurgent vitality that she  
discovers among her friends and neigh-  
bors in the Pacific Northwest.  

She is acutely interested in not only  
her friends and neighbors, but in  
broodmares, mushroom hunts, and  
methods of dealing with suffering, par-  
ticularly suffering which is unacknow-  
ledged by others. In “Your Mother” a  
daughter at last fits the shoes that her  
mother brings her. When the daughter  
suffers a bad fall from a horse, her pain is  
dismissed by her father — the dismissal  
amounting to another similarity,  
another “fit” between herself and her  
mother. Years earlier, her mother’s own  
pain had been ignored:  

Your leg doesn’t work the way it did this  
morning  

your father says it’s nothing  

your mother tells you: when a wall  

of their second dream house fell on her,  

everyone went right on working as if  

nothing happened, this your first  
memory:  

your mother prone and crying,  

her leg a side of meat, not unlike your  
own  

Harris displays the faculty of recognizing  
herself in the nonhuman. In “Sending  
the Mare to Auction” her speaker im-  
agines the irksome nature of the mare to  
be her own nature:  

I am shipping her off the way  

my mother did me, her black tail flowing  

in my dreams, now I wait for the van,  

she waits — little clock — by the fence  

haunches spread, the stallion watches her  

tail cocked, tart, sweating from head to  
hoof  

flesh hot as stove burners, selling this  
mare  

what is it I send to auction?  

This poet is at her most resourceful in  
poems that filter meditations upon the  
self through meditations upon others —  
and when she exploits a subtle musical-  
ity in poems that foreground the often  
common language of her choice.  

Olga Broumas’s fifth collection,  
Perpetua, displays a striking sensuality.  
Her eroticism takes many forms. “Field”  
is a tale of baffling multiple loves and yet  
— somehow — domestic bliss. There is  
the echoing sensuality of “Tryst”: “The  
human cunt, like the eye, dilates / with  
pleasure.” Such lingering sensuality  
lends respect to the body. In turn, res-  
pect for the dead appears in poems about  
Broumas’s father and the excavation of  
his bones in Greece. A note explains  
that due to Greece’s scarcity of land, the  
bones of the dead are exhumed after they  
have been buried for four or more years.  
The bones are then placed in tin lockers  
in mausoleums. “Though I was extreme-  
ly agitated and apprehensive about wit-  
nessing my father’s exhumation,” Brou-  
mas writes in a note, “the actual experi-  
ence was one of relief and joy to have  
him back on earth and in light with us  
again.” “On Earth” directly addresses  
her experience:  

The priest  

directed my attention gently  

from the smaller bones  

I instantly chose as father, dapper, petite,  
lithe  

dancer in uniform at Easter, leading his  

circle of men, to the raw and bold  

armful of deeply stained  

already by the wine. Earth, blood, vine.  

Death and the erotic are linked for  
Broumas. She is not hesitant in ap-  
proaching either. Her ability to caress  
both the body and the body’s death is  
one of the strengths of this collection.  
She unites a rollicking and tender love of  
the sensual self with an acceptance of  
the bonds-breaking of mortality. These  
come together for her through language:  

The text  

of sex, word for word and by heart  
divined, enacted  

in the antechamber of the soul so kindly  
also provided me, is my guide and prayer.  
When my skull shears and the sky  

fills in I’m found.  

Broumas is a massage therapist, an  
occupation that informs her poems.  
Often her own body seems permeable;  
touch allows her to sense the suffering of  
her clients — and to intuit the presence  
of suffering in many parts of the world:  

The gentle and the hard are being taken  

in legions and the globe  

milgat shake us off its flank like quarry  

just  

and start again with something less  

free, less  

wrecked by greed but it suffers us  

on its blue cetacean patience  

like festered barnacles.  

Like counted sheep midair over a stream  

the friends of the dead pause on my  
table.  

The shofar is ringing like starlight  

too young to have reached us.  

I do what I can  

with their breath and my hands.
