Josephine Whitney Duveneck  
Introduction by Wallace Stegner  

This touching memoir chronicles her  
courage in transcending life on the  
frontier to become one of the first  
woman doctors trained in San Francisco  
and to practice in the Owens Valley.  

This award-winning autobiography of  
the distinguished—almost legendary—  
Josephine Whitney Duveneck of  
California offers an unforgettable self-  
portrait of a woman whose awesome  
vitality, spunk, and enlightened dedica-  
tion to humanitarian and environmental  
causes are truly inspirational, “... handsomely printed and retains  
the delightful foreword by Mary Austin  
... an excellent primary source con-  
cerning pioneer California medical  
education and the social history of San  
Francisco during the early 1890s.”  

“Don't miss this beautiful book, it  
white light and love.”
