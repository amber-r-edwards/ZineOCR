Memory Board

Forgetting and forgiving are a pair of  
meritorious acts, especially when neg-  
lect or misrepresentation is involved, as  
both are in this story. Constance and  
Diana, lovers for 40 years, face Con-  
stance’s loss of memory with differing  
needs. Some experiences are less painful  
when forgotten, and Constance does not  
have to forgive what she cannot re-  
member. Diana fears that forgetfulness  
may endanger or even separate Con-  
stance from her.  

Diana uses a toy slate to list each day’s  
activities for Constance. They check off  
entries as events happen, although —  
as Constance demonstrates in a flash of  
independence — all the plans can be  
erased with a flip of the plastic. If Diana  
had prepared a memory board for her  
twin brother David, she might have  
written on it, Speak up! Diana and  
David have lived most of their adult lives  
in the same city, but for many years they  
have seen each other only once a year,  
on their birthday. David’s wife was  
homophobic, and he let her get away  
with it. When his wife dies, he tries to  
reestablish the closeness he and Diana  
had as children as well as introduce  
Diana and Constance to his daughters  
and their families.  

This is David’s story, and David’s self-  
awareness is the principal focus. At the  
center of a lesbian story, I expect to see  
a growth of lesbian awareness. This  
novel provides an interesting alterna-  
tive; lesbians act as the nurturing force  
in a man’s maturing. David valued in  
his sister qualities that he needed. “He  
trusted Diana far more than he had his  
wife or now his daughter, Mary, and not  
only because Diana was a doctor but be-  
cause she had been true to her own de-  
sire.”  

This book gives many insights into  
the experience of aging. Bones that hesi-  
tate because of pain, failing memory  
with its selectivity, eyesight problems —  
all these set scenes where patience and  
sharing are necessary. A young acquain-  
tance with AIDS is also brought into  
the network of these characters’ caring.  

Jane Rule was an early contributor to  
The Ladder, the groundbreaking lesbian  
periodical, and her first novel was made  
into the popular film, Desert Hearts. Her  
direct and sensible voice and natural  
humor linked to sharp observation come  
across in essays and stories. In her  
novels, and particularly in this one, she  
has room for characters with their quirky  
and sometimes distancing qualities to  
draw together in an intimacy that in-  
volves the reader, that instructs as well  
as engages.

Adios Mr. Moxley:  
Thirteen Stories  
by Josephine Jacobsen  

The Jackpine Press (1878 Meadowbrook Dr.,  
Winston-Salem, NC 27104), 1986, $10.95,  
158 pp.  

Josephine Jacobsen’s beautifully sub-  
tle and precise prose immediately con-  
veys why she is considered by many to  
be one of our country’s wisest, most  
gifted writers. Consider this amusing  
passage from “Criminal Career.”  

Irene, purportedly seventeen, but  
looking more Maybelle’s idea of twenty,  
labored under an extraordinary title.  
The first time Maybelle heard it, she  
assumed an error on her part, or that of  
Mrs. Guntz. Irene was a pear girl; that  
was definitely repeated. Not a peach,  
not a lemon, as anyone might say, but a  
pear. Maybelle assumed this to be a  
Frenchified variation of the other  
American expressions — but it seemed  
to carry neither praise nor denigration,  
as in the case of the former. When  
asked what Irene was, Mrs. Guntz  
clearly had repeated, negligently, “Oh,  
pear.”  

Or this psychologically astute passage  
from “The Ring of Kerry”:  

The days in the cool, sweet, damp air  
and the soft starless nights have been  
ideal. A small lump of foreseeable  
nostalgia is forming somewhere in  
Annie’s more obscure emotional  
regions. She is trying to learn from  
Dustin the supremacy of the present,  
but she lacks the talent, having secret  
lustings, of which she is sincerely  
ashamed, after past and future. For  
Dustin, each day opens exactly like one  
of the red or orange or yellow roses,  
fragrant with pleasurable possibility,  
blessedly ephemeral.  

“We'll remember this. . .” Annie  
carelessly has said before breakfast this  
morning, peering out at the ardent  
green of the lawn of that day’s  
farmhouse. . .  

“I expect we'll both be too busy  
doing something else. . .” Dustin has  
said, though he too languished at the  
lawn. He keeps selflessly trying to clip  
the small tentacles of attachments that  
fasten onto Annie, from places,  
people. He fears she will someday be  
immobilized by creepers.  

Jacobsen was the first woman after  
Elizabeth Bishop to be named poetry  
consultant at the Library of Congress  
after a long hiatus; many of her stories  
appear in literary magazines and  
O’Henry Award collections. One won-  
ders (a bit fatalistically) why only a  
small press from North Carolina chose  
to publish Adios Mr. Moxley, as they did  
Jacobsen’s first collection of stories, A  
Walk with Raschid.  

In a mode of quiet realism, Jacobsen  
places her characters in a wide range of  
settings and then plunges them into  
ethical and existential dilemmas. Her  
stories build up to and reverberate from  
powerful moments of altered percep-  
tion. We enter the minds of a woman

trapped into marriage to take care of a  
brain-damaged daughter, a pregnant  
woman overcome by seeing a plaque  
marking the location of a slave auction  
block, and a man who learns that his  
wife has betrayed his trust over his  
friendship with a Moroccan boy. Jacob-  
sen’s endings, ironic and often shock-  
ing, further jar our relation to everyday  
reality. In “Late Fall,” a priest sails into  
a junkyard to his death, his car in re-  
verse, and yet we feel that it is fitting.  
Appearances are not what they seem.  
Turmoil lurks beneath Jacobsen’s decep-  
tively calm narratives as it does beneath  
the tranquil surface of life itself. The  
stillness can be shattered in an instant,  
as it is by the tragic swimming accident  
in “The Edge of the Sea.”  

Jacobsen frequently explores the  
painful effects of stereotyping. A little  
girl in Atlantic City sees her mother sur-  
render a special friend, a German  
hotelier, at the advent of World War II.  
When a Black boy on a skateboard  
mocks an elderly man, a building super-  
visor mistakenly sees his racist suspicions  
confirmed and shoots the boy. A taxi  
driver terrorizes a passenger for refusing  
to join him in anti-Black invective.  

Although one of the joys of reading  
Jacobsen is her precise language — the  
sense of being in the hands of a writer  
who gets it exactly right — her prose is  
never schematic or rigid. She creates a  
space in which the reader must partici-  
pate. Feelings and experiences are often  
approximated, suggested: She declines  
to pin them down for us or to pass judg-  
ment. As we would expect from such an  
accomplished poet, her stories are im-  
bued with her gift for metaphor, as in  
the following passage from “Nel Bagno”  
in A Walk With Raschid. A single woman  
about to leave on a European trip has ac-  
cidentally locked herself in her apart-  
ment bathroom.  

She had thrown away a perfectly good  
vial of sleeping pills in a melodramatic  
gesture, a committing of herself to the  
fight under any circumstance — inherited  
from heaven knew what fictional or  
cinematic conditioning, she thought  
scornfully. But then her hand, like the  
paw of a starving bear after fish, had  
darted down, in case, in case. Why?  

Precious indeed is the writer who can  
engage us with her in asking “Why?”

Picking Up  
by Lucy Honig  

The Dog Ear Press (South Harpswell, ME  
04079), 1986, $15.95/$8.95, 203 pp.  

April Devoe, mother of three boys, picks  
potatoes from the fields to make a living.  
She has kicked out John, her husband,  
after finding he was cheating on her:  
“Why, I never lied to you!” he expostu-  
lates. “You just never asked!” Her sons  
play basketball after school with the  
young minister, Bob, whom April  
vaguely intends to look to for comfort  
some day. And then Sally, April’s al-  
coholic drifter of a mother with whom  
she has never gotten along, drops in.  
April must, like so many women, juggle  
all these parts of her life, along with her  
growing of her own natural foods, her  
membership in a food cooperative, and  
her clashes with her coworkers in the  
potato fields, clashes that may (or may  
not) lead to a final tragedy.  

This very good novel, deserving win-  
ner of the 1986 Maine Novel Award,  
presents painfully real, vivid, sympathe-  
tic, complex characters in whom one  
can believe. We cringe when John re-  
turns home and cruelly berates one son  
for being fat and lazy and the son turns  
on April when she defends him against  
his father. We want April to stay away  
from her husband, yet we understand  
when their sexual attraction overpowers  
them.  

Sally’s history, which we see in  
flashback, pulls the reader toward sym-  
pathy for her, even though her treat-  
ment of April as a girl was traumatic.  
Sally’s misunderstanding and scolding of  
the child April for a brutal experience  
leads the adult April to an understanding  
when something similar threatens one  
of her sons. And April the mother takes  
direct action.  

Honig is especially good at descrip-  
tions that put the reader in the scene.  
We are there when April hurts all over  
from the potato picking, when her body  
is soaked and her gloves stiff and heavy  
from mud during a rainstorm, when her  
mother preserves the huge amounts of  
tomatoes April has grown, when terror  
threatens. And we care. Honig is too  
good a writer to impose a false upbeat  
ending. April will survive, not because  
she is superwoman, but because she is a  
survivor, the very best thing for a woman  
to be.
