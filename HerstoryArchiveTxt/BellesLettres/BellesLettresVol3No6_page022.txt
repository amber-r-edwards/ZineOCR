The quotes underneath some  
of the photos of Australian  
authors in this issue come  
from a fascinating book of interviews by  
Jennifer Ellison called Rooms of Their  
Own (Penguin, $7.95, 248 pp.). I was  
struck by the sorority (in Germaine  
Greer’s term) among the writers, many  
of whom did not know each other.  
Jessica Anderson brings up Christina  
Stead: “I could never write like her,  
she’s so voluminous, but I admire her  
greatly and I think she had an effect on  
me just by writing about Sydney. She  
gave me courage.” Thea Astley is  
thankful that a multicultural society  
made possible “those marvellous stories  
of Beverly Farmer’s in Milk” and agrees  
that it is important to take on social is-  
sues: “I probably should have done it  
years ago, but someone like Olga Mas-  
ters, say, in The Home Girls, is very  
much tackling social issues, while doing  
a Jane Austen, which is why I admire her  
work so much.” Yet she “can’t imagine a  
man in a plane being seen dead” reading  
the book, “unless he happened to be an  
academic who was giving a paper on it.”  
Olga Masters in turn says that “Elizabeth  
Jolley’s got a wonderful short story called  
‘The Well-Bred Thief.’ It’s an exchange  
of letters between two women, and each  
of them writes in her own way. I envy  
her that story. I wish I’d written it.”  
® Our latest bulletin from the  
ever-prolific Dale Spender concerns  
exciting news of new reprint series. Her  
first project, for Pandora Press (distrib-  
uted now by Unwin Hyman), is “re-  
printing classic Australian women  
writers who have been buried under all  
that macho ‘outback’ men material.”  
Authors are Ada Cambridge, Rosa  
Praed, Catherine Martin, and  
Tasma. “To go with them,” she con-  
tinues, “I have written Writing a New  
World: Two Centuries of Australian  
Women Writers, which is a survey from  
convicts to the present day so that the  
women can be put into perspective, the  
themes identified, the tradition worked

kind of pioneer strength and moral rec-  
titude lacking in the decadent Blanche,  
neither woman can view the Black la-  
borers of the cane fields in a non-  
exploitative way. Blanche alternately  
disdains and lusts after them; Cindie  
raises their wages but never abandons  
her paternalism.  

Like all of the characters in a novel  
filled with references to people and  
events of the time, the women are aware  
of the debate regarding the proposed  
“White Australia” policy, on statute  
books by the 1880s but actually imple-  
mented in 1901. Throughout the 1890s  
there was increased agitation to deport  
expatriated Kanaka laborers in the name  
of protecting the conditions of white  
workers and the imagined prestige of  
Australia as, in Devanny’s censorious  
view, “an outpost of British Imperialism  
in the Pacific.”  

Devanny lacks the light touch of an  
Ada Cambridge, and the book founders  
at times in lectures on the history of  
Australian racism, particularly in the  
Labor Party (the novel was ill-received  
by Devanny’s Communist Party  
friends), and the events leading up to  
Federation. What is more impressive  
about Cindie is its imaginative fidelity to  
the strengths and evils of life in the Aus-  
tralian provinces and to the resilient  
heroine who thrived there.

For Penguin Australia, Dale is edit-

white invasion to the present” in her  
Penguin Anthology of Australian  
Women’s Writing, and her sister Lynne  
presents many genres in Her Selection:  
Writings by Nineteenth Century Aus-  
tralian Women. I am also delighted to  
announce the North American publica-  
tion of Dale and Lynne’s book of letters,  
Scribbling Sisters, from the University  
of Oklahoma Press, which Susan Kopp-  
elman reviewed in our second issue  
when the book was unavailable here.

@ The New Women’s Press in  
Aotearoa (the Maori name for New  
Zealand) is the only feminist publishing  
house in the country. Their works are  
not distributed here yet, except through  
women’s bookstores. One book to look  
for is a collection of contemporary short  
stories edited by Cathie Dunsford called  
New Women’s Fiction ($10.95, PB),  
which sold 2,000 copies in the first two  
weeks after publication in New Zealand.

@ I had never heard of Catherine  
Helen Spence (who was at one time  
called “the grand old woman of Aus-  
tralia”) before receiving an omnibus edi-  
tion of her work from the University of  
Queensland Press edited by Helen  
Thomson ($8.95, PB). Spence was  
poor, a spinster, and a colonial, con-  
strictions of her time that she broke  
through, raising three families of orphan  
children, writing at first in one of the  
few areas open to women to support her-  
self and her mother—fiction. Later she  
got her informed opinions in print in the

section focusing on a sub-  

scriber chosen at random was  

scheduled to begin in this issue.  
When I received the following letter of  
thanks from Renée Hartman for a book  
she had won in our subscriber drawing, I  
decided it was just the thing and asked if  
I could print it. (Renée, a bibliophile, as  
you will see, already owned the book I  
sent!) She lives in Millersville, Pen-  
nsylvania.  

I am a book buyer. More specif-  
ically, I buy and read women-  
authored books even though I have  
been called a sexist for this. I had  
once been an English major and in  
the early seventies realized that most  
of the reading I had done as an  
undergraduate had been of male  
authors. I began at that time to  
read women authors and, unfortu-  
nately, for the friends who have  
helped me through some moves, to  
collect them.  

My reading was initially guided  
by Women and Literature, an anno-  
tated bibliography of women writers  
put out by The Women and Litera-  
ture Collective in Cambridge. This  
told me about authors I knew noth-  
ing about — but the public library  
where I lived at the time had ex-  
cellent selections and there were  
only a few books I could not find.  
My serious collecting of women’s  
novels began when I was able to  
make trips to large cities and when I  
decided I wanted to own some of  
the books I was reading (a good  
library in a small town does not  
mean good bookstores).  

I am thankful now to Virago and  
other women’s presses for bringing  
out books by authors not always  
mentioned in my faithful guide —  
and while I buy a lot of Viragos as  
well as books from other women’s  
presses, I also find many books by  
these same authors at two wonderful  
local bookstores.  

Last year I decided to catalog my  
books — primarily so I could take a  
list to sales and prevent buying  
books I already own. When I spent  
time last fall adding to this listing, I  
discovered that I had added well  
over 100 books to the collection last  
year. Bookshelf space now is se-  
verely limited!  

But my reading of women’s au-  
thors is done somewhat in a va-  
cuum, in that too many of the  
women I know are too busy to read  
or are just not readers. I’m always  

pleased when Belles Lettres reviews a  

book I have been enthusiastic about  
as this lets me know that someone  
else shares my tastes.  

At present I find out about new  
books through the x!#/o NY Times  
and their occasional review of a  
woman-authored novel, Ms., Belles  
Lettres, and trips to bookstores in  
other cities. Because books are so  
expensive, I try to buy used books  
or go to a half-price bookstore  
whenever possible.  

Although I am sure that I read  
just as much when I was fully em-  
ployed (teaching in an alternative  

high school), I now have more time  
to read. I now bake and sell breads  
— and rising times are reading  
times.  

And it’s time to start the day’s  
baking.

“male” areas of law, politics, economics,  
and reform. She was a defender of the  
egalitarianism in colonial society; her  
Autobiography shows her deep knowl-  
edge of and involvement in Australian  
public life. Her first and best novel,  
Clara Morison: A Tale of South Australia  
During the Gold Fever (1854), gives val-  
uable insight into domestic and social  
issues of the time and is one of the first  
novels about Australia by a woman.  

From the same press comes Captives:  
Australian Army Nurses in Japanese  
Prison Camps, by Catherine Kenny.  
The author interviewed many of the liv-  
ing survivors of this experience, and the  
diaries, letters, and artifacts they pro-  
vided her greatly enrich the narrative.  

@ New titles by Australian authors  
discussed in this issue include The Sugar  
Mother by Elizabeth Jolley (Harper &  
Row), The Well-Dressed Explorer by  
Thea Astley (Penguin), Two by Astley:  
A Kindness Cup and the Acolyte  
(Putnam), and The Woman in the Picture  
by Viki Wright (Viking). For a sampler,  
The Faber Book of Australian Short Stories  
has a story by most of the women in this  
issue.  

Paperback Picks  

The second book by Marianne  
Gingher, Teen Angel and  
Other Stories of Young Love,  
is just out from Atheneum, but if your  
budget has the blues, start with her  
novel, Bobby Rex’s Greatest Hit  
(Ballantine, $3.95). It’s wildly inven-  
tive, sensually evocative, and un-  
abashedly tender.  

@ Fawcett went creative with the  
cover(s) of the mass market edition of  
Marge Piercy’s big novel of World War  
II, Gone to Soldiers ($4.95) using nine  
black and white photographs of the peri-  
od. Radio spots promoting the book will  
feature Lauren Bacall. In the fall,  
Fawcett will reissue six more Piercy nov-  
els with new covers. Piercy was a favor-  
ite in our recent renewing subscribers  
poll of writers you wanted to have inter-  
viewed. I'll work on it!  

@ Ballantine Books has reprinted  
Guadeloupean author Maryse Condé’s  
historical novel of early nineteenth-  
century Africa, Segu ($9.95), dedi-  
cated to the author's “Bambara ances-  
tresses” and translated from the French  
by Barbara Bray. It is an oversized paper-  
back with a mercifully large type size and  
a striking cover. Condé has taught West  
Indian literature at the Sorbonne, and  
her work is well known in French. This  
is only the second of her books to appear  
in English. (Heremakhonon, her first  
novel, is available from Three Conti-  
nents Press.) One hopes the mass mar-  
ket exposure will bring her a wider read-  
ership in this country.  

@ Other paperback news concerns  
perennial favorite Anne Tyler. Her new  
novel, Breathing Lessons, will be pub-  
lished by Knopf in October; however,  
Berkeley has already bought the paper-  
back rights for $1.426 million (eek!).  
Two big book clubs snapped it up  
simultaneously. Look for Kathleen  
Turner and William Hurt in the movie  
of The Accidental Tourist.
