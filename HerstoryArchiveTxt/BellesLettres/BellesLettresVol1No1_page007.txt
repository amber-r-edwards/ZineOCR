of Baltimore

Sandie Castle’s first published  
collection of poetry is  

reminiscent of the magazine  
proposed by e.e. cummings:  
“something authentic and delirious/  
you know something genuine like a  
mark/ in a toilet/ graced with guts and  
gutted/ with grace/ squeeze your nuts  
and open your face.” When I first  
read those lines by e.e. some years  
ago, I felt I had been slapped in the  
face. Castle’s poetry is the best slap I  
have had since.  

Polite words are foreign to Castle’s  
work. She uses no euphemisms. But it  
is not Castle’s words alone that slap.  
Her words are commanded by a strong  
voice, a voice that is raw, angry,  
bitter, sarcastic, obscene. Yet, even  
when it is suffused with any of these  
qualities, her voice can simultaneously  
be tender, plaintive, vulnerable, and,  
frequently, comic.  

Take, for example, the voice in  
“And the Band Plays On.” Castle  
(always clearly the speaker) encounters  
a former lover:  

Two years after it’s over  

and he wants to know  

what I’m doin tonight  

and ten years after it’s over  

my mother will ask what I’m doin  

with my life  

and then minutes after  

after you come  

you wanna know if I use birth  

control  

and what I'll do if I get pregnant  

and how long before I’ll know  

NO you didn’t mention that you  

have a wife  

Did you leave out anything else  

important like uh . . . syphilis or  

hepatitis?  

What ensues is a situation comedy  
that could be shown only on late-  
night TV, which in fact is what  
Castle likens the occasion to. The  
scenes are both comic and pathetic.  
“Look could I get on top for awhile?  

... [realize it’s takin some time/ but  
could we do it/ till we get it right?/  
We could always try turnin out the  
lights/ and pretendin we’re other  
people . . . . Are you sure we're on  
the same station?/ You seem more like  

PBS to me... . I’m having a hard  
time tellin/ if this is live or  
Memorex.”  

As excerpts from “Band” might  
hint, The Catholics Are Coming is  
more about coming than about  
Catholics. In his introduction to the  
book, Andrei Codrescu avows that  
“there is more of the sweet narcotic of  
sex in her poems than there is in any  
other contemporary poet I can think  
of. She is a true poet of Eros.”  
Whether just thinking about sex, as  
in “The Married Men:” “thinkin bout  
how nice it was/ to be kissin you the  
other night . . . made my legs squeeze  
shut . . . got me all excited. . . My  
legs wet/ my legs your back/ my legs  
your neck/ These legs locked”; having  
sex with a partner: “While I was  
grinding my body into yours with all  
my might. . . trying my best not to  
bite you” (“Lights Camera Action  
Cut”); or having sex alone, as in  
“Nobody Does it Better:” “Fingers  
falling off/ a wrist spins aching/ God  
yes tiny death/ please come take me,”  
Castle speaks of sex unflinchingly.  
Never one to sit by and idly describe,  
Castle yanks sex out of the closet,  
strips it naked, and gives it a good  
talking to.  

Codrescu is right, I think, but if  
Castle is a poet of Eros, she spends a  
lot of time on the banks of the Styx.  
Codrescu continues: “a tragic Eros  
. . . because there is just as much  
death, balancing it out.” He tells us  
that Castle has weathered the deaths  
of a childhood friend, a brother, and  
a husband. The influence of these  
deaths on Castle’s poetry is unmistak-  
able. For one cannot read this book  
without feeling first the weight of pain  
and grief and then the relief of having  
it spoken. I do not mean to imply  
that Castle’s poetry is self-serving.  
Even the poems most preoccupied  
with death bristle with life. Rather  
than attempting to rid herself of grief,  
Castle embraces and confronts it — in  
the same commanding voice that she  
uses to speak of sex.  

Castle’s words for the dead are  
bitter eulogies. To Georgie, a child-  
hood friend, she says: “You know I  
didn’t even come see you. . . cuz  
you stole everything I had/ jus to buy  
yerself that coffin.” To her deceased  
husband she screams: “So now I can  
say I loved you more/ Nobody around  
to argue it. .. I LOVED YOU  
MORE/ I really did/ goddamit.” There  
is a powerful poem dedicated to John  

Lennon, with the final verse:  
“Blackbird singing in the dead of  
night/ take these sunken eyes/ and  
learn to see/ All your life/ you have  
only waited for this moment/ to be  

. . . Shake it don’t break it/ Took yer  
mother nine months to make it/  
Free?” In one of her most bitter  
poems, “Maybe Next Year,” Castle  
proclaims that “Death laughs up its  
very long sleeve.” Perhaps the line  
that sums up Castle’s feelings about  
death best is this from “He Said”:  
“People say ta me/ ‘Christ San bury  
yer dead and forget it’/ But they just  
keep on comin/ If I put this shovel  
down I’ll be up ta my ass in corpses.”  

Castle yanks sex out of the  
closet, strips it naked, and  
gives it a good talking to.  

Lest I neglect the Catholics  
altogether, let me point you to per-  
haps the most brutal poem of this  
collection, “Dead Babies.” Castle  
creates some of the most nauseating  
images — simultaneously making the  
funniest parody of religion — that I  
have ever encountered. If dead baby  
jokes are quintessential sick humor,  
then Castle implies that God has one  

of the sickest. Excerpting lines from  
this gut-wrencher will not do. You  
must read it in its entirety to ex-  
perience its odd juxtaposition of the  
sick and the funny.  

Codrescu calls Castle “the  
Guerilla Duchess of Baltimore,” which  
does her both a justice and an in-  
justice. Born in the part of town that  
is now a sleek shopping mall called  
Harbor Place, Castle is assuredly a  
product of Baltimore, which is present  
in the people, the landscape, and the  
voices of her poems. But Castle is not  
purely a regional poet. What she  
speaks most plainly of, in a dialect  
not merely Baltimorean but distinctly  
her own, is the pain of loss. To say  
Castle is a guerilla does her justice.  
She is a warrior who combats the pain  
of loss, be it of love or of life. Sandie  
Castle may be angry, and she may use  
dirty words, but she is brave. She is  
not afraid to rail at what scares her  
most or to speak of what is most  
private to us all.

An Evening With the Guerrilla Duchess  

A bar in Baltimore. An open poetry  
reading. National Premium drafts were  
75 cents. I was having a second or  
third, occupying space on a  
comfortable stool with a perfect view  
of the mike and whoever stood behind  
it. I admit, though, that I was not  
appreciating fully the virtues of my  
location. I was thinking I might  
relinquish my space to one of the  
more avid listeners behind me  
straining for a better view. Harsh  
words, syrupy words, cryptic words  
were batted to my ears in left field. I  
caught them easily — none were  
hurled sincerely. None of them made  
me run to grab at the truth of it.  

On the sidelines I heard  
murmuring. “Sandie Castle’s here.”  
“Get Sandie to read.” “I don’t have  
anything with me,” Sandie said. My  
fingers closed around the book in my  
bag. And, no kidding, my heart  

The Sixty-Fifth  

Column  
by Chris Prouty  

Hers: Through Women’s Eyes, edited by  
Nancy R. Newhouse. New York: Villard  
Books, 1985, $15.95, 289 pp.  

The editor who asked me to review this  

book that I rarely, if ever, am  
attracted to books that are the result  
of collecting columns from  
newspapers. I believe that their  
original impact rests on that short-  
read zap that one can enjoy in the  
press, which is lost when it goes on  
page after page. This book is no  
exception, but it is good stuff.  

The women who contributed to  
the HERS column since its inception  
in the New York Times in 1977 say  
what they have to say with style and  
quiet certainty. There is no shrieking,  
although there is pain underneath.  
The powers of the New York Times,  
Abe Rosenthal and Arthur Gelb,  
must have been ecstatic when they  
saw the results of their decision to get  
behind a regular column by women,  
and one hopes that they read it  
carefully. The reader can be joyful  

if should have confessed to the  

started pounding. The book was  
bandied about, requests were made.  
“Love Poem for Johnnie B” was the  
choice. “This is gonna be weird,”  
Sandie said, walking to the mound.  
“You sure you want me to read this  
one?” We were sure.  

“Foggy night white mist suicides  
and snow drifts,” she began in her  
raspy-edged monotone that makes  
punctuation a theatrical production.  
The crowd, which had been making a  
low, constant din since the reading  
began, turned as quiet as a snow drift,  
as if Sandie had ordered it. “Here’s a  
machine,” she read matter-of-factly,  
dipped in sarcasm. “It will breathe for  
you,” she said, giving the word breathe  
all of the space allotted to the other  
four words combined. I felt as if  
someone had died. Maybe it was the  
National Premium, but I didn’t think  
so.  

that Nancy Newhouse, editor of the  
section in which the columns  
appeared, exercised such discernment  
in selecting writers.  

The 64 columns reprinted are by  
52 writers; Lois Gould, Mary  
Cantwell, Letty Pogrebin, Laura  
Cunningham, Joyce Maynard, and  
Gail Sheehy appear more than once.  
The columns had no titles, which was  
right and proper because each entry  
was about so many things. The editor  
divides them into categories, “A  
Question of Appearances,” “Mothers  
and Fathers,” “Aspects of Feminism,”  
“Between the Sexes,” “Singular  
Women,” “The Married State,”  
“Being Alone,” “Having Children and  
Raising Them,” “Person to Person,”  
“Women at Work,” “A Sense of  
Place,” and “Partings.” There are rich  
vignettes about Jean Rhys, Sister Joan  
Chittister, Gloria Steinem, Nora  
Astorga, Nadezhda Mandelstam, and  
a memorable 27-year-old male student  
in the literature class taught by Faye  
Moskowitz of Washington, DC. The  
point of these sketches is more how  
the writer reacted to those  
personalities than details on the life of  
the individual written about. The  
column by Sybil Adelman tells you as  
much about her transition from  
secretary to script writer as it does  

“Death is the gift that keeps on  
givin/ Nobody can take that away.”  
No emphasis on that was needed, and  
Sandie gave it none. “I jus wanna kiss  
you again and again/ but I’d ruin both  
our makeup.” Her grammar seemed  
perfect. “You thought limbo was a  
dance you did/ till you couldn’t go no  
lower.” I thought of all limbos. “Yer  
goin first class for the/ first time.” Her  
voice screeched over the second first.  
“There’s a bigass limousine outside/  
We ride over the place where you  
died/ It was the shortcut.” Too short.  
“I had such a good one ta tell you/  
and it breaks my heart ta keep it.”  

You told us a good one, Sandie,  
and it breaks our hearts to keep it.

Sandie Castle still lives in Baltimore,  
where she is writing her first novel.  

about her ex-boss Carl Reiner (always  
a favorite comedian of mine and now  
a bona fide hero pussycat).  

These short essays go beyond  
giving information, as these women  
writers encounter their deepest  
feelings, sharpen their coping skills,  
and lay out their conflicts and injuries  
in a spare, unwhiny way. Apparently  
“identification with” mail and phone  
calls came in lavishly to the New York  
Times as chords were twanged by one  
offering or another. Even a man or  
two responded.  

Which brings me to the final  
point. It is men who should read this  
book. No father who has abandoned  
his child for 10 years could fail to  
understand the feelings of his ex-wife  
after reading Jane Adams’s description  
of the day her son left to live with  
said father. The gentlemen of the  
Department of Agriculture could laugh  
and learn from Sue Hubbell’s tale  
about filling out a questionnaire from  
the D. of A. and life as a bee farmer.  

I still hold the same views about  
collected newspaper columns, but I  
am glad I read this one.
