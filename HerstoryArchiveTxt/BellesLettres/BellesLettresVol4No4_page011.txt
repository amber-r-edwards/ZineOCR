Poems of Stevie Smith is welcome.

Here is an expanded version of an  
earlier collection — 165 poems at a par-  
ticularly good time to reconsider this  
British poet as a purveyor of difficult  
truths.

A critical sense of Smith’s signifi-  
cance has grown since her death in  
1971. An unusual figure who lived with  
an aunt most of her life in a suburb north  
of London and who worked for over  
thirty years as a publisher’s secretary, she  
was a fierce original who held her own  
against the waves of literary fashion.

Smith specialized in refusals to be  
socialized into the expected and ac-  
ceptable response. She was never at ease  
with strictures. Pieties can be damned,  
the poem “Progression” suggests in its  
evocation of a voice that is wryly honest  
about indifference.

It is the Major Spruce.

And he’s grown such a bore, such a bore,  
I used to think I was in love with him  
Well, I don’t think so any more.

It was the Major Spruce.

He died. Didn’t I tell you?

He was the last of the Spruces,  
And about time too.

Deceptively, her simple rhymes occur  
inside of rebellious content. She takes  
pleasure in departures, differences of  
opinion, refusals to follow instructions.

Voices here are experienced. Even  
the children seem not so much inno-  
cents as beings who have renounced the  
protection and privileges of childhood.  
Such voices are unassimilated. Women,  
particularly, strip away hypocrisy in  
their monologues. Consider Lady  
“Rogue” Singleton in the poem bearing  
her name: “I am not a cold woman,  
Henry, / but I do not feel for you, / What  
I feel for the elephants and the miasmas,  
/ And the general view.”

The cover of the collection shows one  
of Smith’s quirky and revealing draw-  
ings: A grinning cat puffed up with ma-  
licious glee stands next to a seated,  
rather demure woman in a feathered  
hat. The combination of figures suggests  
a double self, a woman with her demonic  
double — a cat-self stripping away civil-  
ity.

Some critics have suggested that  
Smith veered among moral positions,  
skimming without alighting; this is a  
mistake. Even this slim collection re-  
veals that she held attitudes seldom  
crossed: a disdain for pretension, a fa-  
voring of exhilaration, a readiness to  
accept differences among people. Like  
Emily Dickinson, she found God puz-  
zling, a male god particularly defeating.

Her parody of a literary critic reveals  
her awareness of the deadly orthodoxy  
that often attends judgments — a  
mean-spiritedness and self-interest. Her  
disdain for a closed mind masquerading  
as a firmly considered position is perhaps  
best rendered in “Souvenir de Monsieur  
Poop.”

I perfectly apprehend the perilous nature  
of my convictions

And I am prepared to go to the stake

For Shakespeare, Milton,

And, coming to our own times,

Of course

Housman.

I cannot say more than that, can I?

And I do not deem it advisable, in the  
interests of the editor

to whom I am spatially contracted,

To say less.

Similarly, she found life-excluding  
refinement inimicable: “This English-  

10 Belles Lettres

woman is so refined / She has no bosom  
and no behind.”

There are poems that I wish were in-  
cluded in this new culling of Smith’s  
work. “The Wedding Photograph” and  
“The Hostage” would make fine addi-  
tions — the latter one of her most im-  
portant in its focus on her sense of exile  
and her paradoxical attitude toward  
death. She loved life, and yet she found  
death a comfort, a chance for ultimate  
control and escape from coercion. She  
writes of death in the tone another poet  
might reserve for a lover.

Diane Wakoski has fiercely pro-  

tected her integrity. And so to  

see these readable poems culled  
from her full-length collections and from  
her many smaller volumes is a pleasure.  
She is one of our most prolific poets, and  
it is surely time some of her best works  
were brought together.

Emerald Ice is a fitting title for the se-  
lected poems. Wakoski frequently in-  
vests in images of coldness, of ice,  
moons, and emeralds. Chill is her pres-  
ervative and a quality attached to her  
self-presentation: “Call me Diane,  
moon, silver archer, huntress, pillar of  
marble.” Hers is a crafty sensibility in  
which the chill of wine and strawberries  
mixes with a daunting self-criticism.

But for all her images of coldness, this  
poet has always been a voluptuary in the  
“camellia and caviar” atmosphere of her  
poems. Hers is the imagined world of a  
child of poverty who longs for security  
and beauty. California beaches and or-  
ange trees, raspberries and crocks of oli-  
ves — these appear as she invents a per-  
sona angry and queenly, intrigued by  
perfect and untouchable men and  
women, and yet with each year gaining  
self-acceptance.

Increasingly, food has become  
Wakoski’s preoccupation as her sign for  
honoring the female self, the female  
body no longer culturally trimmed and  
neutered. When food is her metaphor  
for Americanism and heterosexuality,  
poems strain under the burden of an  
exclusionary ideology. Most often,  
however, food serves her for erotic me-  
ditation. Her poems then are carefully  
weighted and refined, as in “Braised  
Leeks & Framboise.”

as fingers, from a sea goddess,  
braised, with butter, delicate  
from the Altadena garden.

Never has this poet admired self-  
imposed suffering. Her self-creation of  
the mythology of a woman pursuing  
pleasure and truth also makes for an aes-  
thetics of will. Against the purists she  
would divine an integrity that takes into  
account both “leapings and slidings.”

We are faithful always

to ourselves,

those leapings and slidings which take us  
somewhere

we feel

we must go.

She explores emotional climates, for  
her feelings are, as she writes in “Some  
Constantly Besieged Castle,” “ancient,  
heavy, sexual, historic, / as a 100-  
year-old carp, / swimming in the moat /  
of some constantly besieged castle.”

Images of women as cultural icons are  
meditated upon in “How Do You Tell a  
Story,” until finally Wakoski explores a  
way to make “a more complex beauty”  
from the struggles of maturity.

Inside,

I am shaped like a beauty,

the blood in my veins,

thank you, Kate,

is melted rubies.

It is for the upheaval of life, for  
persistence,

a more complex beauty,

that we twist and strain.

The work gathered like this strikes me  
as a poetry about luck; Wakoski’s fas-  
cination with those born beautiful or  
gifted or fearless turns the poems into  
explorations of fortune. How is one to  
face bad luck in a country that wildly  
admires the lucky?

Mortality and creativity — May  
Sarton’s twin themes — reso-  
nate through her new collec-  

tion, The Silence Now. And faith, not  
the long-lived ache of loss, informs her  
new work. Sarton begins with “New  
Year Resolve,” a fitting start for a collec-  
tion of promises.

For it is now or not

As old age silts the stream,  
To shove away the clutter,  
To untie every knot,

To take the time to dream,  
To come back to still water.

The poem promises a return, just as the  
volume offers a return to Sarton’s earlier  
voice through its third section of lyric  
poems written in earlier years but never  
before published.

The lyric with its emphasis on con-  
densation, its urgency, and the highly  
personal voice serves Sarton well. Her  
thematic concerns — silence as a well-  
spring for creation, the ebb and flow of  
the well-lived life — are echoed in the  
ocean pulse that recurs throughout the  
collection. To Sarton, silence is a pres-  
ence and a creative source in “The Si-  
lence Now.”

These days the silence is immense.

It is there deep down, not to be escaped,  
The twittering flight of goldfinches,

The three crows cawing in the distance

Only brush the surface of this silence

Full of mourning, the long drawn-out

Tug and sigh of waters never still —

The ocean out there, and the inner  
ocean.

She waits for growth beyond the will.  
In “Blizzard,” she imagines the daffodils  
that will emerge despite a snowstorm;  
they are synonymous with her desire for  
a fuller realization of self.

New Englanders are skeptical

Of what cannot depend on will,

Yet I should know that this wide range

Of white and green and constant change

has kept me kindled, on the edge of  
year,

Travelling the weather like a  
mountaineer.

Often it is the example of others that  
provides this poet with a model for sur-  
vival. “August Third,” a tribute to her  
mother, suggests as much.

Thinking of you

The old camel gets to her knees,  
Stands up,

Moves forward slowly

Into the new day.

If you taught me one thing  
It was never to fail life.

The book’s third section of earlier  
lyrics is less intriguing than the others;  
although highly crafted and tightly knit,  
a number of these poems lack the urgent  
immediacy of Sarton’s later work. And  
among newer poems, “Two Birthdays,”  
written in two sections for friends at the  
ages of eighty and ninety, appears largely  
occasional. Most of the new verses,  
however, reveal that her craft supplies  
her with the striking illusion of ease de-  
spite the conceptual weight of her medi-  
tations.

Like the other poets under review, a  
sense of faithfulness to an evolving self is  
prominent. Oddly, Sarton writes of a  
faithful “Muse as Donkey.” Sturdy, not  
easily moved, stubborn, a donkey seems  
a fitting figure for this poet engaged in  
homely truths and a spirituality that sus-  
tains itself through daily attention. Af-  
ter a crisis in love and work — a batter-  
ing by the moon goddess — her speaker  
borrows a donkey to represent a regener-  
ative act.

When I saw the long ears  
In the truck,  
It was kingdom come.

It was patience

Come to this gentle place  
Where only I am violent,  
Unregenerate,

Full of rage and anguish,  
Never at peace,

Among the silent flowers,  
The cool calming trees,  
This tranquil order.

This house. This garden.

I am a practical person.

Let us believe

That Mystery itself is fulfillment.  
It was given to me

To be deeply stirred

To be taken out of myself

By the “evidence of things not seen.”  
Now the donkey’s frail ankles  
Absorb my heart.

We are fellow-sufferers,

And we do not despair.

In the book’s final section, Sarton  
writes of one of her favored symbols in  
“The Phoenix Again.” The discipline of  
her art is evident.

And one cold starry night  
Whatever your belief

The phoenix will take flight  
Over the seas of grief

To sing her thrilling song  
To stars and waves and sky  
For neither old nor young  
The phoenix does not die.
