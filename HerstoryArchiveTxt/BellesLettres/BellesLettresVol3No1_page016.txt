narrator undercuts his assertions that he  
is a suffering “spirit,” a “seasoned ang-  
ler,” a compassionate “observer” of life,  
or a remorseful man. Like Hawthorne’s  
faithless Goodman Brown, this charac-  
ter sees treachery everywhere, including  
in his wife, whom he blames for fading  
too fast; in his former best friend, whom  
he constantly accuses of conspiracy; and  
in his institutionalized son, whom he  
rejects for not being able to fish and,  
therefore, for not being a man.

While one can appreciate Hawthor-  
nian ambiguity — the shadow ground  
between fact and fancy — in this novel  
the author’s failure to name the two  
main characters, the wife, or the wife’s  
illness mystifies. In addition, the se-  
quences of dream versus reality blur im-  
portant distinctions; questions rise and  
remain unresolved. Is the old man’s re-  
lationship to the girl that of seducer or  
surrogate parent? Which metaphor fits  
which character? Where do thematic  
undercurrents of environmental pollu-  
tion or industrial waste lead?

Much else about fishing is unclear in  
this novel besides the fishing metaphors.  
An experienced angler and writer friend  
of mine agreed and commented upon  
the remoteness of some references, for  
example, knowing that leaders are hol-  
low for flotation or that gravel spills  
occur in stream beds used for trout fish-  
ing. He also observed how strange it was  
that, in a time of crisis, the obsessed  
fisherman “never really goes fishing to  
deal with death or to sort things out.”

At the end of the novel, therefore,  
when lonely and locked out from his  
home, his son, and his single friend, the  
old man moans, “Believe me when I say  
I have learned almost nothing,” the  
reader nods assent but sadly does not  
care.

the politically conservative, anti-intel-  
lectual Phyllis, “in the kitchen among  
her sticky saucepans.” Wasting no pity  
on her ideological enemy, Dark mocks  
the tunnel vision of Phyllis’s reaction to  
Hitler’s invasions of Czechoslovakia and  
Poland — “we weren’t at war.” And in  
the domestic tragedies that bedevil Phyllis  
as the novel proceeds, Dark sees the vin-  
dication of those like Marty who question  
and experience life, who had not “been  
taught to be afraid of joy [or claim] the  
dreary satisfaction of conscious rectitude.”  
Dark’s forte is viewing character as politi-  
cal idea, but Phyllis in particular is sad-  
dled with too many distasteful ideologies  
to be a convincing character and the  
novel is far more valuable as social history  
than as art.

By 1959, with the Hitlers defeated and  
the days of the Phyllises possibly num-  
bered, Dark’s mood is buoyant. In Lan-  
tana Lane, a series of interlocking stories  
about a remote fictional farming com-  
munity, light humor replaces dark satire.  
A contented individualism characterizes  
the heterogeneous and seemingly egalita-  
rian group of former teachers, carpenters,  
bank clerks, and bus drivers who have left  
the cities for the utopian serenity of the  
land. While, somewhat curiously, women  
still seem to run the homes and men the  
fields, this does not diminish them nor  
lessen their voice in community affairs.  
Quite the contrary. In one typical sketch,  
“Gwinny on Meat-Day,” the narrator  
celebrates the multitalented Gwinny —  
mother, mainstay, and community or-  
ganizer. There are disagreements in Lan-  
tana Lane but no bitterness. Social order  
produces personal happiness; ideology is  
destiny. Perhaps that is why the book  
seems such unexciting reading. But what  
are women doing still relegated to the  
hearth? And who would wish for a life of  
no risk?

research, reveal the personal triumphs  
and tragedies of individuals who are  
drawn into the foreground by the poet’s  
gift for summing up a lifetime in a line,  
an image, a point in time. One such  
moment occurs in the poem “What  
Grampa Sam Told Me: Your Gramma,  
She Came Off the Boat”:

I beg master john to buy her, but he  
says she’s too mean,  

and no matter how I beg, all he says is  
no, and it  

isn’t but a week before those soul drivers  
sneak  

right out  

in the field,  

get her from behind, and master webb  

sells her down the river, laughs when  
they pay him. . .

An ambitious work, Civil Blood is the  
product of a talented poet who lets her  
work accumulate in meaning and whose  
insights into the human heart make her

In a way, all of your books are different  
from each other, although there is the “same  
stream.” Puffball, with its “Inside Liffy”  
sections devoted to the biological play-by-  
play of Liffy’s pregnancy, is different from  
the fairy-tale nature of Little Sisters, and  
both differ from The President’s Child.  
You seem to enjoy “playing about” with  
styles.

It comes naturally. When my life  
changes, the writing seems to change,  
and my view of the world alters. I wrote  
Puffball just after I’d been pregnant and  
had a baby, when that was very much  
with me. Little Sisters was written at a  
time when everything in my life was run-  
ning fairly smoothly. Language and form  
seemed much more interesting at the  
time. Every book starts from a different  
point. Praxis was a fictionalized essay on  
the title (an extraordinary word, which  
has about six different meanings). But  
you can’t write many books like that!  
An unconscious process is at work, ob-  
viously; it just so happens that you don’t  
quite know yourself what you are doing  
until you have done it. Not that you  
make it up as you go along, rather you  
keep some elements hidden from your-  
self in the same way as you keep them  
from the reader — it’s a kind of double  
think. If you let yourself know too much,  
you tend to get rather bored because  
then you're just writing it out. So if you  
can manage to reveal things to the reader  
as you go along... . It requires a lot  
of practice, and I do write a lot: You get  
better at it. You then permit yourself at  
the end of the book to explain the whole  

cast of characters beguilingly believable,  
passionate, and human. As she moves  
with an almost musical rhythm from  
lyric to narrative, Breckenridge keeps  
the long work from becoming tedious by  
investing it with the qualities of a drama  
as characters play out their lives on  
battlefields, in the political arena, or in  
fields of tobacco and cotton.

What unites Lisa Ress’s Flight Patterns  
with the others reviewed is the fact that  
a real life, whose roots spread through  
the generations of a family, moves on  
and through her pages. According to  
Phyllis Janowitz, Ress gives us a  
“glimpse of a permanence centered  
within the upheavals of time and place,”  
especially the “giant and terrible events  
of the past half century.” Ress per-  
sonalizes but does not trivialize the inci-  
dents in her family history, and it is  
them to whom the book is dedicated:  
“For my mother, my father, my grand-  
parents who got away, my grandparents  
who didn’t get away, and all of us who  
disappear.”

thing to yourself — if you’re lucky. What  
I do is really just pass my interests — or  
obsessions, if you like — on to the  
reader.

Do you see yourself as part of a tradition,  
George Eliot, perhaps, or Muriel Spark? Is  
there some particular author who has af-  
fected your work?

I simply don’t see it. I write what I  
write. Having read enormously from  
childhood, I have absorbed a great deal.  
But I don’t think writers consciously see  
themselves as part of movements or  
groups or see a line from anywhere to  
anything. That must be left to students  
of English literature!

I was always worried that I was going to  
draw that line incorrectly, like putting the  
lines through the dots and coming up with  
the wrong picture.

No, you put it where you like. I don’t  
mind — I would be very flattered to  
think of Muriel Spark; she’s a writer I  
admire very much, and I admire, natu-  
rally, George Eliot (when I can read  
her).

I was impressed by the fact that, in England,  
all kinds of people liked your work and tried  
to make you part of their camp. Did I read  
one of your works serialized in a popular  
women’s magazine?

Yes, I’ve had stories in women’s  
magazines. I’m quite pleased about that.  
I got commissioned by one rather by mis-  
take and I kept writing them stories and  
they kept saying, “no that’s too depress-  
ing.” I felt I had an obligation to them

In her poems, the small details and  
pieces of memories that people shore  
against the ruins of their lives have a  
cumulative effect. The directness and  
strength of her poems connect Ress to  
her family of survivors and to those  
whose memories endure. The “rhythmic  
pounding of the dead against the simple  
surface of the present” echoes through-  
out Flight Patterns. Ress’s poems are most  
effective when they sift through the rub-  
ble, “the remains of a world/ sunk under  
nettles, their roots/ binding them back  
to the soil.” She does not let herself sim-  
ply rely upon references to bombings,  
cattle cars, and death camps to evoke  
emotions; instead, her attention to  
commonplaces and the life that goes on  
in spite of atrocities lifts her poems and  
images out of the ordinary.

for some reason, and went on writing  
short stories. By the time I actually got  
one that suited them, I practically had  
a volume written!

Perhaps you've turned out to be a spokes-  
person for feminism, almost despite your-  
self, like the heroine of your book Praxis.

By accident really. In a way though,  
it’s the whole of society that creates the  
feminist rather than the feminist move-  
ment. It has to come from the inside  
out rather than the outside in. That’s  
why, in fact, readers of women’s  
magazines seem to me almost more im-  
portant than readers who know all that  
anyway. We have an enormous popula-  
tion of the kind of submerged women  
for whom all thought is, for the most  
part, denied by the culture they live in.

Do you have a reader in mind when you're  
writing?

Well, I think it’s me. I cast myself in  
the role of reader, and write the book I  
want to read. I love reading and nobody  
else has actually written it. It’s wonderful  
when you get a book that actually suits  
you or that you really respond to. I think  
those are the books I write for myself.  
You get through all the books in the  
library and the books on the shelf and  
you have nothing left so you are obliged  
in the end to write your own.
