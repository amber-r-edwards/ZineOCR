by Barbara Loren

Yesterday was a feast. . .

a round of poetry, my poems read aloud,

and then we joined in making

many a neat love song, each in turn

writing a new stanza...

we galloped with new meters, laughter and wine

ran through us, ‘your genius set

my blood on fire.

And now at home, I cannot sleep,

eyes staring round, awake, my legs and arms

alive between the sheets,

waiting for morning and another word from you.

—Catullus, #50

trans. by Horace Gregory

The references to the poems of

Catullus in the collection of let-

ters between Leslie Marmon
Silko and James Wright called The Deli-
cacy and Strength of Lace are fitting.
Catullus, like Silko and Wright, broke
away from the literary conventions of his
time. Had Silko and Wright ever spent
time together, they might have ex-
pressed the sentiment that Catullus
writes in the above fragment. As it is,
however, Silko and Wright met only
twice: once at a gathering of writers that
did not allow any time for them to talk
individually, and a second time in a hos-
pital after James Wright had just come
out of throat surgery and could not talk.
The Delicacy and Strength of Lace records
the relationship between Silko and
Wright, one that was built around a love
of writing.

Silko was working on Storyteller at the
time these letters were written. On one
level, her correspondences with Wright
are interesting in that they speak of her
process as a Native American writer.
She explores, in these letters, what it
means to be a storyteller in the tradi-
tional Native American sense and how
this heritage affects her sensibility as a
contemporary author. She is influenced
by two cultures, and her letters reflect
her struggle to be true to her Laguna her-
itage and to the American culture that
she has also inherited:

I keep running across all the dif-
ferent versions of single stories
which Aunt Susie has told — even
as I type “single” stories I think
“same story.” I realize that I am
learning now that there is no such
thing, that every time she told it
like it was the only version, well, it
was the only version of that story;
and it is just a certain training we
have, a training that makes us want
to try to group ideas or stories to-
gether, which leads us to want to
lump together all the stories, calling
them versions of the same story.

On a somewhat deeper level though,
the beauty of these letters lies in what
they reveal of the desire for sincere com-
munication between two people. The
Silko/Wright correspondences are filled
with honesty and desire to understand.
The reader sees the love that develops
between Silko and Wright and is moved
to want to reach a point in the book
where the two will meet and celebrate
their obviously deep connection. But
this never happens. Tentative plans to
meet are arranged but are always
thwarted by circumstances of the two
writers’ careers. There is, however, a
certain beauty in the fact that Silko and
Wright knew each other only through
what they both loved dearly: the written
word. Still, their words can’t help but
play a type of longing pavane.

When Silko tells Wright of her daily

pleasures and struggles on her land in

16 ® Belles Lettres

Arizona, Wright tells Silko of his travels
around Europe. Although the early let-
ters have a formal tone, this is gradually
dropped when Wright and Silko venture
to share their most difficult struggles and
greatest pleasures. What they came to
mean to one another is clear. Silko says
to Wright, “With you to write to, I go
through the day with a certain attention
I might not always have. I look for things
you might want to see for yourself.”
Wright responds, “Our correspondence
is one of the finest things I have ever had
anything to do with in my life.” At one
point, early on in the letters, Silko
writes, “At Laguna, when someone
dies, you don’t ‘get over it’ by forgetting;
you ‘get over it’ by remembering, and by
remembering you are aware that no per-
son is ever truly lost or gone once they
have been in our lives and loved us as we
have loved them.”

The Delicacy and Strength of Lace
remembers James Wright and the ex-
traordinary poetry he left to us before his
passing in 1980. It celebrates life and it
confronts death. It also gives a sensitive
insight into the works of Silko, the Na-
tive American author of whom Wright
said: “no living writer known to me so
deeply grasps the truth, and its signifi-
cance, as you do.”

Whereas Silko’s letters to
Wright discuss the role that
the storyteller plays in La-

guna tradition, American Indian Women
Telling Their Lives by Gretchen M.
Bataille and Kathleen Mullen Sands
explores the personal stories told in the
autobiographies of five Native
American women. As Bataille and
Sands explain, in most cases these auto-
biographies were written via a transla-
tor. In translation, there is always some-
thing lost. Bataille and Sands analyze
the art of composing an autobiography,
and their critical inquiry is perceptive
enough to be helpful to anyone seeking
to understand the insights and short-
comings autobiographies provide.

Bataille and Sands point out the oc-
casional tendency to romanticize that
occurs in some autobiographical nar-
ratives. When analyzing A Pima Past by
Anna Shaw, they are careful to point
out that: “The first hundred pages of her
life story are simplistic and roman-
ticized, partly because of the fictional
technique she employs and partly be-
cause of her selection of events.” They
also draw attention to the gaps that oc-
cur when any autobiographical informa-
tion is taken out of one culture and
presented to another culture:
“American Indian personal narrative
technique is significantly different from
the sequential form we assume of
Euro-American autobiography.”

American Indian Women Telling Their
Lives is a sensitive and intelligent collec-
tion of critical essays on the form of
autobiography. It is essential reading for
anyone who wishes to understand the
shortcomings and potential insights
provided by autobiographies of Native
American Women.
