ROSA LUXEMBURG  
A Life  
Elzbieta Ettinger  

“An absolutely first-rate piece of work. The  
research is impeccable, the story clearly and dra-  
matically told, and the writing superb.”  

—from Beacon  

— Doris Kearns Goodwin  

“A biography rich in psychological insight and  
sexual perceptiveness. Rosa Luxemburg: A Life  
allows us to see politics emerging from the influ-  
ence and predilections that shaped a remarkable  
personality. Ettinger has lived long and intimately  
with her subject; she persuades us that she  
knows her well and loves her even better. We  
come to believe in Rosa because Ettinger neither  
apologizes for her nor whitewashes her. She lets  
Rosa speak for herself.”  
—Vivian Gornick  
Village Voice Literary Supplement  

“An imaginative reconstruction of Luxemburg’s  
private life.”  

— Daniel Egger, The Nation  
$24.95 cloth  

EMMA GOLDMAN IN AMERICA  
Alice Wexler  

“When Goldman died in Toronto in 1940, she was  
a figure in history. No woman of her generation  
had lived a more exciting and more generative life.  
No woman had stirred so many to look upon life  
with fresh eyes, to become unencumbered by con-  
vention. It is that Goldman Wexler celebrates in  
her friendly yet critical and persuasive biogra-  
phy....She has done a magnificent job in integrat-  
ing the public myth with the intimate life.”  

— Chicago Tribune  
“A trenchant, sympathetic new biography.”  

— Newsweek  
$10.95 paper  

“A vivid picture of Rosa's  
contradictory and passionate  
nature and of her eventful  
personal life.”
