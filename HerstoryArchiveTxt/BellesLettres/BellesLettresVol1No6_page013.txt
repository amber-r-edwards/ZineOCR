Women’s studies in music have lagged far behind the other disciplines. Feminist journals in art and literature are firmly established and yet, as Joseph Kerman remarked last year in his important book Contemplating Music: Challenges to Musicology, serious feminism has yet to make a debut in musicology or music theory. Indeed the discipline is conservative and has historically followed the critical formulae of art historians. Now Linda Nochlin and others have shown that there is a feminine aesthetic in art. It is time to ask whether the same aesthetic exists in music — whether female musicians are recognizably different from their male colleagues.

Until a very few years ago, the question could not be addressed because there were simply no materials to assess. They lay buried in the archives of convents and libraries, and access was limited to persistent researchers who, like most scholars working with unexplored repertory, were not in a position to bring their discoveries out for public audition. Leonarda Records, Da Capo Press, and several small publishers have begun to help us rediscover our musical heritage, and compensatory essays such as those in Women Making Music are helping us to find the contributions of neglected women composers.

In their introductory essay, Bowers and Tick state that the sociology of music itself and its institutional structures have excluded women from musical history. Anne Yardley’s essay on cloistered musicians in the Middle Ages suggests that women were tremendously active in producing their own music. Their accomplishments culminated in the wonderfully mystical and idiosyncratic sequences and dramas of Hildegard von Bingen, the “sybil of the Rhine,” who described herself poetically as “a feather on the breath of God.” Her liturgical drama Ordo Virtutem is one of the great artistic achievements of that age. Its critically acclaimed performance in Boston this spring indicates that like all great works of art, its appeal is timeless. Maria Coldwell’s essay reminds us that the Middle Ages were a good time for women legally and economically. Women troubadours or trobairitz were active until 1314, when Salic law prohibiting inheritance through women limited their legal freedom.

Essays by Howard Brown, Anthony Newcomb, and Jane Bowers survey professional and nonprofessional opportunities for women in Italy from the 15th to the 18th century. We learn that music was a suitably decorous activity for women at court and that they were particularly active at Florence, Mantua, and Ferrara. An important appendix to Bowers’s essay lists compositions published between 1556 and 1700 with modern editions where available, a great help for performers in search of repertory. Ellen Rosand’s essay on Barbara Strozzi, “elective daughter” of a powerful member of the Academy and prolific composer of cantatas and arias, is an exemplary study from both sociological and musical perspectives. A collective essay by Julie Anne Sadie chronicles the extensive contributions of women in the ancien régime, both amateur and professional, most of whom were (at Versailles, for example) wives, sisters, and daughters of famous musicians.

It is time to ask whether the same aesthetic exists in music — whether female musicians are recognizably different from their male colleagues.

In the 18th century, the art song was an important aspect of domestic music making, a popular and praiseworthy activity for women. Marcia Citron’s “Women and the Lied, 1775-1850” describes the setting for the songs of Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, Clara Schumann, and several of their less well-known but not less well-connected colleagues such as Corona Schroter and Emilie Zumsteeg. Schumann herself is the subject of Nancy Reich’s beautifully written essay drawn from her recent biography. Reich treats her as an individual in relation to her father and to Robert.

A summary of the remembrances of late 19th-century German composer Luise Adolpha LeBeau is Judith Olson’s subject. She also considers society’s preconceptions of women’s abilities and its treatment of women composers. Suffragist Dame Ethel Smyth, friend of Virginia Woolf and one of the few female composers of opera, broke from the mold of woman as composer of parlor music. Jane Bernstein, in this essay, and Judith Tick, following with an essay on American musical life from 1870 to 1900, bring us to the 20th century; Carol Neuls-Bates’s article on American women’s orchestras from 1925 to 1945 shows that close to 30 active orchestras stretched from Boston to Los Angeles. Matilda Gaume summarizes the work of yet another connected composer, the talented Ruth Crawford Seeger, whose compositions were frequently the working out of her music theorist husband’s complicated theories of dissonant counterpoint. Her political or ideological decision to join her husband and others in collecting folk material robbed us of an exceptional composer.

With this volume and Neuls-Bates’s first-hand accounts in her Women in Music (Harper & Row, 1982), an anthology of source readings, the beginning of a general literature is added to the several important biographies of the past few years. From reading these works we know, for example, that successful women in music, like the artists who ran Germaine Greer’s “obstacle race,” were frequently the wives, lovers, or daughters of famous musicians because training was not available otherwise; that their music did not differ in style or content; and that they did not choose different subjects from those of their male contemporaries. There are more essays to be written, and there is more music to be heard, but with books such as this becoming available, readers can finally begin to contemplate music from a female perspective and to experience artistic history as a continuum in which women are not excluded because their work is inaccessible. If this were its only purpose, this would be enough, but Women Making Music is, as well, an elegant and essential book about music, a temporal phenomenon. Its very presence depends on physical perpetuation by performers who need books like this to discover its existence.

Jane Ambrose is a baroque flutist and music historian in search of music by women composers. She teaches at the University of Vermont.
