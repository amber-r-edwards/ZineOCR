CONVERSATIONS WITH WOMEN  

Daphne Morrison  

“I found this book incredibly moving.  
It made me more aware than ever before of the  
sisterhood of women, at the same time  
grieving over the cruel ways in which society  
so often traps them—and amazed at their  
strength.”  

—Sheila Kitzinger  

Most books about pregnancy and  
childbirth are practical guides that tell  
women what to do—how to eat right,  
how to keep fit, how to give birth. This  
book is different.  

Recalling past pregnancies and  
discussing current ones, fifteen women  
of different ages and backgrounds talk  
here in their own words about what  
being pregnant was like for them. The  
result is a revealing look at a  
commonplace—yet profoundly personal  
and powerful—event that most women  
will experience at some time in their  

lives. ISBN 0-919573-71-1
