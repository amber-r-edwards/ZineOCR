she celebrates her birthday

by crawling through a barbed wire fence
and climbing up the June green foothills
two thousand miles away is a womb

and a rather messy battle which she lost
after twenty-five years she would gladly return
armed to the teeth for a long siege.

but she feels like Cinderella’s sister

at the end of the story, too old, too large
today she sits behind barbed wire

and waits for an agent from the forest dept
to throw her out in celebration.

happy birthday to me

Stop Pretending

The office

is the place
you go because
you can't

do anything else.

(Mother said

it would be like this.)

The line
of

command watches you sweat
and fills out reports

while you sit

there

wondering
The office

is the deadbeat prison
high in the mountains
cut off from the sound

of butterflies

El Gilbert
NYC

we rush to fill the
boxes of the day

never realizing that

the day is really our

walks in the rain

and what we see

in between these
boxes.

for a friend —

(sometimes the soft rain
reminds me how)

when the sky, uncertain,
hesitates to smile or

say

and how (some half-
white mornings)

vague clouds dream to
mist

not quite knowing if

the shy sun will finger
her hair / wisps of

song she will be threading
somehow

and when she leaves (her
unsure smile)

will spin a fragile

basket

for my day

I am the hour

you stole

yesterday was a twig
someone picked / you

run ahead

like tears,

and clear the morning
early.

I am the rain lover
caught among nine red lights
and one green tree
in the wave of this swollen night
I am being eaten by
butterflies

Written May 2

The man came in and said hello how was she today. The woman said
hello she was a good girl see her smile at you do you want dinner now or
would you rather later. The man said later would be better and he
changed his clothes and played with the baby and read the paper and
then they were alone and the food was between them and they ate.
Anything happen today she asked, Not really he said I just didn’t get
done as much as I should have and things aren't as they should be and
sometimes I feel like I'm banging my head but I am moving ahead and
learning more. What did you do today he said. Oh, I got the laundry done
and wrote some letters and baked some bread and took care of my child
she said. She didn’t say, I thought a great deal about us and about the
wall I feel growing up between ourselves. About how we should be
friends and aren't even lovers. About how I want to welcome you home
with a kiss and a hug but am afraid to offend. How I always think I have
bad breath and maybe that’s why you don't kiss me. About how my mind
is cluttered with imaginary conversations that make my throat ache.
About you not giving time to an emotional growth which seems to me to
be so important and without which survival is in doubt. About how we
are not out front and how anger seems to store up and how afraid I am to
trip a plug which might lose yours towards me. Will you say “listen, we
have a good thing going, I think,” and imply, don’t shatter this shell I've
formed around me. Don't expose the emptiness for what it really is.

She says, do you like the soup. She doesn’t say, I feel like fucking and
talking while we fuck and playing again. It seems like fucking is all we
ever do together anymore, and that not very often and even then my
mind is full of things unsaid I want to say but am afraid to say which
often makes it hard for me to be all there.

He says, the soup is not as good as last time you made it. The bread is
good.

She says, thanks. She doesn’t say, you seem preoccupied. What's
wrong. What do you think about. What do you feel. Do you feel. Do you
think about us. What do you think, how do you feel. How do you feel
about my feelings.

She thinks she is weak because her mind runs. Sometimes she tries
to talk but because it means so much the words get stuck, the
vocabulary that is needed is lost and blocked and it's easier to talk about
the broken car, the new cookbook, the sick horse, the crying child. But
then the silence and the constant conversation-that-never-takes-place
warping existence even further. In the mirror she seems to look okay but
he doesn't look or seem to want beyond the satisfaction of an irritating
drive.

She wants to be free, free to feel, to think, to do without the fear of the
clutter which seems to inhibit all else except the mechanical, repetitive
moves. She wants him to be free from the restraints of his unsatisfied
drives of ambition, to be warm and grow and learn to touch and, if not to
completely understand, to sympathize instead of reject.

Dinner is over. The dishes get done. The bath gets run. They go to bed.
They go to sleep quietly
