One Million Rally

As many as one million  
Chilean people rallied in  
Santiago in the most mas-  
sive demonstration yet a-  
gainst the fascist rule of  
the US-backed Pinochet re-  
gime. Government forces  
attempted to sabotage the  
rally in a number of ways.  
They conducted night-time  
raids into the working  
class neighborhoods, moving  
from house to house issuing  
threats against any who  
would attend. The size of  
the rally proved that the  
repressive police tactics  
failed to intimidate the  
forces of the opposition.  
Instead these forces have  
grown stronger.

Self Defense

A woman was arrested in  
New York recently for de-  
facing a poster advertising  
the August issue of Pent-  
house in the Manhattan sub-  
way. Dorchen Leidholdt  
claimed in court that the  
act was not one of vandal-  
ism, but one of self-de-  
fense. She brought a copy  
of the magazine to court  
and offered to show the  
judge the issue which in-  
cluded a story celebrating  
the gang rape of a college  
woman, a photo essay on  
bondage, rape and death of  
a woman and a cartoon mak-  
ing fun of murder/rape. The  
judge refused to look at  
the magazine and dismissed  
the charges against her.

Red Zora Strikes

The car of Hamburg gynea-  
cologist Hans-Joachim Lind-  
emann was firebombed by a  
group of women called Red  
Zora and the underground  
Revolutionary Cells. They  
were protesting the steri-  
lizations Lindemann performs,  
usually on older women with-  
out their permission during  
exploratory gynecological  
surgery. Lindemann calls  
himself an international  
"expert" in sterilization  
questions in the Third  
World. Lindemann was brief-  
ly threatened with a trial  
in West Germany, and had  
planned to move to Chile,  
where sterilization is com-  
monly done. In their state-  
ment, Red Zora says: "Linde-  
mann....personifies the  
strategy of imperialists  
who, via their ‘population  
politics' control the fer-  
tility of women. Enforced  
sterilization happens to  
those on social welfare in  
the USA, to Indians, to poor  
women in Latin America and  
to approximately a third  
of all Puerto Ricans..."

Red Zora promises further  
action if the sterilizations  
continue.

Repressive Act

Reagan's teen chastity act  
has recently received a new  
round of funding. The act  
currently implements programs  
designed to discourage abor-  
tions by teaching teenagers  
abstinence. Hundreds of thou-  
sands of dollars are being  
spent under the act, includ-  
ing 15 research projects to  
study how the family, reli-  
gion, school and peer pres-  
sure affect adolescent sex-  
ual behavior. Videotapes and  
other educational materials  
are used to focus on the vir-  
tues of chastity, encourag-  
ing adolescents to serve as  
"models" for the community.

Say What?!

In August 1980 when he was  
campaigning for president,  
Reagan visited New York's  
South Bronx with a promise  
of aid. People gathered to  
jeer in disbelief, and Rea-  
gan yelled, "How can I help  
you if you won't even listen  
to me." Well, the help has  
finally come through in the  
form of a $300,000 federal  
grant to fix up 300 gutted  
buildings.

Over each boarded-up win-  
dow, decal sheets showing  
fake flowerpots, curtains,  
and shades have been stuck  
up. "Perception is reality,"  
says Mayor Koch's Housing  
Commissioner, pointing out  
that the decal method saved  
hundreds of millions of dol-  
lars in costs for really  
fixing up the neighborhood.

Woman Hating

Women in Thunder Bay, On-  
tario Canada, protested the  
"T-shirt Game" booth at  
this year's Canadian Lakehead  
Exhibition. The "game" was to  

throw darts at a woman's  

breasts which were really  
balloons positioned under a  
t-shirt. They charged the  
exhibit with dehumanization  
and gross insensitivity to-  
ward women.

Food For All

An angry crowd of 1,000  
women recently forced the  
mayor of a small town in  
North East Brazil to hand  
over several tons of food  
from local stocks. After  
learning that a government  
emergency work program had  
only 200 available places,  
the women marched on the  
local agricultural coopera-  
tive store and threatened  
to ransack it unless maize,  
rice, beans and other basic  
foodstuffs were distributed.  
On the same day 1,500 peo-  
ple, many of them women,  
invaded the northeast town  
of Itavira seizing food  
from market stalls.

No Rights Here

Marion Penitentiary, where  
Leonard Peltier is locked  
up, was put on lock-down  
on Oct. 28 after the deaths  
of two guards. The lock-  
down continues with reports  
of many prisoners being  
beaten, exercise and family  
visits denied, and inmates  
totally confined to their  
cells, with meals served  
individually. The meal sit-  
uation is of special con-  
cern, since there are re-  
ports that in early Nov. a  
guard was caught carrying  
arsenic into the prison. In-  
mates are fearful of being  
poisoned and Leonard is on  
a hunger fast. Supporters  
feel that the volatile sit-  
uation at Marion could be  
used as cover for another  
assassination attempt on  
Leonard.

Supporters are asking for  
letters to be sent to Con-  
gresspersons or to the pri-  
son officials directly:  
Norman Carlson, Director,  

US Federal Bureau of Prisons  
320 First St. NW, Washing-  
ton, DC 20534 and Harold  
Miller--Warden, Marion Fed-  
eral Prison, PO Box 1000,  
Marion, IL 62959. Or money  
or support needed by Leonard  
Peltier Support Group, PO  
Box 18717 Denver, CO, 80218.

Violence

Two weeks of horrific vio-  
lence in Sri Lanka (South-  
east Asia) left 2000 Tamil  
women, children and men dead,  
and 150,000 homeless. In  
late July, three schoolgirls,  
members of the Tamil ethnic  
minority, were seized by  
members of the armed forces  
and gang raped. In retalia-  
tion, Tamil separatists laid  
an ambush in which 15 sol-  
diers died. What followed  
had evidently been carefully  
planned. Gangs of thugs with  
lists of Tamil homes and  
businesses moved through  
Colombo, the capital, beat-  
ing, killing and burning.

Women workers in Sri Lanka  
have been badly hit as a re-  
sult of this racial violence  
against three million Tamil-  
speaking people which has  
caused widespread homeless-  
ness and unemployment.

Kangaroo Courts

A former sheriff and 2  
former deputies have been  
convicted of torturing pri-  
soners to make "confessions."  
Six people who fell into  
their hands said they had  
been handcuffed either to a  
chair or table, with a towel  
wrapped around their faces.  
Their heads were pulled back  
and water was poured over  
the tightly wrapped towel  
until, nearly drowning, they  
"confessed." In addition  
the sheriff, his son, two  
bail bondsmen and another  
deputy have also been in-  
dicted for arresting motor-  
ists in a “marijuana trap"  
along U.S. Highway 59. The  
highway arrests were usually  
not recorded, bond money  
was kept by the sheriff's  
office and items seized were  
sold illegally.
