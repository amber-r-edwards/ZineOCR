Official Response Hostile

Law Students Protest White Male Faculty

Lynette Cazeall

The failure of the University of
Colorado School of Law to hire
any full-time women or minority
faculty members gave rise to a
picket of the Fleming Law
Building in Boulder on Monday,
September 29. A group fluctuating
from 30 to 100 law students and
concerned community members
participated in the demonstration,
which culminated at noon with a
rally on the south lawn. Many more
students shared the goals and
frustrations of those on the picket
line, but refrained from marching
for fear of a counteraction by the
Law School involving (1) retaliation
in grading and (2) escalation of
existing discriminatory practices.

Background

Since 1973, students have been
negotiating with the Law School to
obtain assurance that it will comply
with Federal law, which requires
that an affirmative action plan be
adopted to correct past discrimination.
Last spring, after the School again
failed to adopt such a plan or to fill
its vacancies with women or
minorities, students filed a complaint
with H.E.W. (Health, Education and
Welfare Dept. of the U.S.) alleging
discriminatory hiring practices which
jeopardize the quality of their
education.

The official Law School response
to the students has been hostile. No
student representation has been
allowed on the faculty hiring
committee, and until this year there
weren't even any women or
minorities on it. This year one
woman and one black were
appointed — but neither is allowed
voting power.

Middle Class Predominates

The official reasons for failure to
hire women and minorities are (1)
lack of enough qualified candidates,
(2) lack of sufficient funds to entice
the few qualified candidates to go to
the boonies offering more to teach,
and (3) for women professors, the
difficulty of their husbands’ finding
employment in the area. Students
feel that the School's use of a talent
search service which charges a fee
to those seeking employment limits
its candidates to wealthy middle
class graduates of eastern schools,
a class largely composed of white
males and already over-represented
at the Law School. A search such
as is required by affirmative action,
that is, one tailored to locating
qualified women and minority
candidates, they feel, would give
the hiring committee more than
enough candidates to choose from.
Further, the students propose that
better use be made of local resources
by offering part-time professorships
to women and minority members of
the local practicing bar.

Wirth Cops Out

The demonstration was supported
by the Student Coalition Against
Racism (SCAR), National Lawyers
Guild, Boulder NOW, Univ. of Colo.
Students Union, the C.U. Affirmative
Action office, Boulder Mayor
Penfield Tate, and U.S.
Representative Timothy Wirth.
However, Tim Wirth, liberal in
support of women’s rights, quickly
retracted his support when confronted
by the Law School, and wrote a letter
disclaiming responsibility for the
telegram of support initially issued
from his office.

Picketer’s Speech

The following is an excerpt from
an address by Bourtai Hargrove,
one of the women law students
participating in the picket:

“It comes as no surprise to women
who are entering law school to find
an all-male faculty or to find that
women, who do much of the
important administrative work of
the school, receive no recognition
and are paid subsistence wages.

“We know that the university
affirmative action plans for faculty
hiring are largely pro forma. In the
five years between 1968 and 1973,
despite increased pressure from the
government and from private groups,
the fraction of faculty women
nationwide increased by less than 1
percent, although there was a
dramatic increase in the number of
women who received PhDs between
1960-1970 and were available for
teaching positions.

“We also know that male
supremacy is more firmly entrenched
in law than in any other professional
field. In 1973 only 2.8 percent of
the attorneys in this country were
women. Of the 200 women
associated with law faculties in
1972, only 33 were listed as full
professors. A 1972 study, based on
interviews and questionnaires,
concludes: ‘Sex discrimination as
perceived by male and female
professionals is common in law,
medicine and architecture, but is a
significantly accentuated characteristic
of law.

“Even a past president of the
American Association of Law Schools,
Alfred Conard, admits that: ‘In view
of the high intellectual achievements
of women we are likely to find plenty
of available talent. So long as women
are a smaller proportion of our law
faculties than of the legal profession,
we should suspect ourselves of not
having gone far enough.’

“Just as these statistics are prima
facie evidence of discrimination
nationally, the facts about faculty
hiring are prima facie evidence of
discrimination at our own school.

Patriarchal Elitists

“Let's take a closer look at our
faculty. First of all, they are a caste
elite and a patriarchate. There really
is no way they can hide the fact that
they are white male. Secondly, they
represent the point of view of a
privileged class. More than half of
them graduated from Harvard or
Yale, two of the prestige schools
which have traditionally served the
upper classes of this country.
Remember that Harvard was the last
of the all-male law schools; it
remained off-limits to women until
the 1950s.

“Is it any wonder that men from
this background, when placed in an
appointment committee, develop
selective blindness and cannot see
the qualifications of women candidates?
In a 1970 study, the chairmen of
psychology departments were given
descriptive paragraphs of job
candidates for evaluation. Male
candidates were offered hypothetical
positions at higher ranks than female
candidates, and more men than
women were considered suitable for
tenured positions, although the
paragraphs describing the candidates
were identical except for name and
sex. An entirely separate study in
1971 showed that ‘average’ males
were rated above ‘average’ females
both in general evaluation and in
inclination to hire. The study
concludes that high-prestige
universities are more, rather than
less, biased against women.

“There are compelling reasons why
we need women on this faculty. One
is the fact that our faculty does have
a limited, class-oriented point of
view. This may be fine for training
corporation attorneys, but who's going
to represent the other side? It may be
great for turning out district attorneys,
but who's

Benefits Non-existent

Household Technicians Discuss Co-operative

Peggy Hickox and Phyllis Kadison

On October 14th a small group of
women met to discuss the possibilities
of forming a Household Technicians
Cooperative. Discussed were ways of
upgrading pay, obtaining benefits,
sharing job information and team
working.

The co-op idea originated when one
household worker, Norma Jacobs,
decided to call a meeting of women
doing the same kind of work. At the
first meeting, quite a few basic
problems and goals were discussed.
To begin with, the women discovered
that “household worker” can mean a
lot of different things, from live-in
maid to part-time apartment janitorial
work. Two of the women had many
years of experience with live-in work
and talked about the lack of
independence in live-in situations,
even though the job conditions
sometimes appear to be more desirable.

Wide Differences

The women also discovered there
were wide differences in wages and
working conditions. Both the older
and younger women who were getting
paid less felt that this was partially
due to age discrimination — they were
either considered too old to do the
job or too inexperienced and immature.
The women also discovered that one
of the more deceptive ways of keeping
wages low for housework is to hire a
woman for a given time or set fee and
to give the employee more than a
reasonable amount of work to be done
in the allotted time. All the women
found that they frequently work 10
hours for 8 hours’ pay. The possibility
of charging overtime in these situations
was discussed. Many employers also
keep the wages down by taking
advantage of women who are new in
the country and non-English speaking
by hiring them as “cheap labor.”

No Benefits

Another major area of concern was
the lack of benefits from household
work. There are no paid holidays,
paid vacations, sick leave, workmen's
(women’s) compensation or retirement
benefits. The women who are full-time
household workers have to pay for
their social security out of the limited
wages they receive, and must keep
their own private medical insurance.

Household Technicians Unions have
been started in New York, Washington
and Baltimore and the women at the
meeting discussed the idea of forming
a similar union in Denver. Anyone
