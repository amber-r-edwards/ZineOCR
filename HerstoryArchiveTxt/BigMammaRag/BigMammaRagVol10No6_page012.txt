grew, as if I am not a Les-
bian. Also, I learned to be
self-destructive—that is how
I dealt with my anger. I
learned to swallow my tears,
vomit my food—I learned that
I deserved no privacy (some-
times twenty to a room). How
I longed for a room of my
own!

After years of hospitaliza-
tions, half-way houses, drugs,
and out-patient therapy—I
recognized that never were my
issues dealt with: my need to
come out politically, with
strength and pride, my need
to deal with my mother, fath-
er, family and their abuses
of me, my need to look at how
dependent I had become on the
mental health system, and its
drugs and negative reinforce-
ment, my anger/self-destruct-
iveness, and my need to be
who I am and grow rather than
stagnate. Some of these is-
sues I was able to work on in
treatment. In Minnesota there
is a chemical dependency and
alcoholism treatment center
for Lesbians. I managed
through the help and support
of Lesbians to stay out of
hospitals for two whole years.
I naively trusted a Lesbian
therapist during this time;
but after being pushed on
some extremely difficult is-
sues farther than I could han-
dle or cope with, I became
thoroughly anxiety stricken—
too needy and dependent upon
my therapist. This therapist
could not/would not handle
my needs and I was forced
back into the system I had
fought so hard to free myself
from. In MN, it is possible
for a therapist to sign com-
mitment papers. Commitment is
a civil process by which one
goes through a hearing. If
the psychiatrist, lawyers
etc. deem the patient in need
of "therapy" then she is for-
ced to follow whatever "ther-
apy" is prescribed. Also,
once one has been "committed"
it is on one's record, just
as if one has a police re-
cord—except, in some cases,
the stigma is worse. During
this last time, my therapist
committed me (I had always
managed to not be committed
before), I played their
game in order to get out:
when to get up, when you're
locked into your room, when
to go to sleep, what not to
talk/think about, where to
work, forced groups and ex-
ercise, who to live with,

what to eat, pretending to
take the drugs, doing their
cleaning, and on...

I'm amazed at myself...the
self that I am now. No long-
er do I play by their rules
for me. No longer do I dis-
own my sanity, my lesbianism,
my intelligence, my right to
be this size, my ability to
teach, share, care, give.

I have not yet won every
battle; often I become immer-
sed in self-pity and awesome
loneliness yet: I survive.

I survive my battles with
extreme back pain. I've brok-
en my back twice and now have
complications with arthritis
and disc disease. I survive
the memories of abuses by my
family, and the doctors/
nurses/therapists/priests

who were in power. I survive,
yet also struggling so very
hard to continue owning my
growth and who I am now—
regardless of whether others
want to recognize me, listen
to me, much less give cred-
ence, or credibility to who

I am. I am a strong, miracle,
survivor. A poem written a
long time ago:

deal with me, visit me in
hospitals (psych and medical),
spending time with me—etc.
because I took too much ener-
gy. I own that I get needy. I
also realized that to know,
or share, or visit me would
mean that at some point, (un-
less I were to remain super-
ficial/dishonest) you would
probably respond to my pain,
craziness, anger, oppressions
by feeling/experiencing your
own pain, craziness, anger,
oppressions—and that takes
energy; energy that many
Lesbians do not want or are
too frightened to expend.
Recently, I was told that I
need to learn how to ask for
what I want, or even just to
"take in—hear" good things
about me, and giving and
taking in a relationship.
Yet, before I began to find a
few women who were willing to
relate to me, if I wanted to
relate to anyone, I had to do
all of the work: I made the
phone calls, I did the invi-
ting—I guess I would have
even vacuumed myself to be
walked on. It confuses me how
to come to a balance between

Well, oak tree, you're here.

Solid.

Solid like yesterday (not me) Listen

I'm not crazy.
Confused isn't crazy

(what is? I've

got this world all figured out, oak tree—

(don't tell though, they'll

ask more)

More than I care to say.
I'll leave, yes I will, I'll leave
and tell this (rotten) world I'm gone
(gone) but they won't be sorry...
not really...one more copped out
philosopher can't hurt.
So, hang in there oak tree......

(I may be back)

I am back, alive, strong,
growing. I have survived the
system that abuses women,
especially Lesbians/fat wom-
en.

Since submitting this arti-
cle, I realized that I did
not clarify some important
issues and facts. I could
have filled these columns
with several more horror stor-
ies of my times spent in in-
stitutions and "therapy"; but
that is not my purpose. I do
not think/feel that I stress-
ed how little support, caring
sharing—is received by a
Lesbian woman with mental
health "problems". Most wom-
yn did not want to know me,

giving and taking.

Sometimes I think that some
of the dykes I have known
have not wanted to know/
relate to me because they
feel that it is not "politic-
ally correct" for me to
have allowed myself to be
abused, therapized by the
patriarchal mental health
system (although there have
been Lesbian therapists who
put me back into that system,
&/or work within it). Nor is
it "politically correct" for
me to go to a doctor (male or
female) of Western medi-
cine. I do not totally dis-
agree that western medicine

continued from page 13

is bad in many ways, nor do I
put down finding ways to heal
yourself through foods, relax-
ation—imagination—mind con-
trol—inner strengths, and on.
But, I do feel angry at being
judged or shamed/guilted or
told that if I choose any
aspect of western medicine
that I am setting myself up
to once again be dependent
and not have any power. I hear
that there is that possibili-
ty and have experienced it,
but I also know that there
have been times that I would
surely have died, and complex-
ities of my being that I have
yet learned or found ways to
deal with without western
medicine.

Some facts about support
systems for straight women
and Lesbian women in the men-
tal health system:

1) Straight women usually
have visitors, have concerned
persons sometimes even coming
to groups, receive mail,
gifts, phone calls.

2) Lesbian women are usu-
ally isolated—do not have or
receive the above and in both
the mental health and medical
units of a hospital, if you're
a "known" lesbian they
may put you in a room by your
self, with an old woman who
is too senile to notice, or
with women who are too crazy
to be concerned,

3) There are many mental
health, chemical dependency,
job-seeking centers that ca-
ter to straight women.

4) If you are Lesbian and
need help with the above you
can choose (in Mpls.) from a
few places and private thera-
pists who are lesbian or you
can try a women's center and
not be able to deal with is-
sues that need to be dealt
with honestly—much of the
time you have to talk in
“code”—i.e., not giving the
gender of your lover. Also,
sitting in a group of straight
women—you’re subjected to
their problems with men,
children, fear that they
might be "raped" by you and on.

5) Straight women may kiss,
hug, hold hands with male
visitors—and this is perfect-
ly okay.

6) Lesbian women who have
visitors are expected to pull
the curtains around their
beds (if there are curtains)
or totally refrain from any
