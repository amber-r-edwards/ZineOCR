French Prostitutes’ Strike Continues; Téninil Ship Workers Strike

(Editor's note: The following
article was written from infor-
mation supplied by Schofield
Coryell in Paris)

“Prostitutes, yes — whores,
no!" “‘No Sexual Ghettoes!”
“The State Is A Pimp!” read
three of the many banners
stretched across the walls of the
large Paris meeting hall where
2,000 prostitutes gathered on
November 18 for their first
national convention.

The meeting was a further
step in a militant prostitutes
movement, which began early
last summer in Lyon when 200
prostitutes occupied a church in

protest of intensifying police
harassment. The movement
quickly spread to other

major French cities, where
prostitutes were also exper-
iencing stepped up arrests. Al-
though prostitution is legal in
France, scores of prostitutes
were being rounded up daily on
charges of assuming “an at-
titude likely to provoke de-
bauchery.”

Delegates from Lyon,
Marseilles, Toulon and several
other cities participated actively
and enthusiastically. Many rose
to tell their own stories of
beatings by police in arbitrary ar-
rests, and the heavy fines and
unjust taxes arbitrarily imposed
against them.

Prostitutes’ Demands

A manifesto containing a list

of demands has been drawn up

by prostitutes throughout
France, and is currently before
the government. The manifesto
calls for an end to police brutal-
ity against prostitutes, amnesty
for all convictions to date, and an
end to the policy of arrests based
on the article in the penal code
forbidding “behavior tending to
provoke debauchery.” The
women explain in the docu-
ment that this article is used ex-
clusively and unjustly against
women, since it is never used to
arrest men who make advances
to women on the streets.

The manifesto also demands a
fair system of taxation for pros-
titutes, and calls for the same
social benefits, such as social
security, that other workers are
entitled to.

Two developments were
received with special apprecia-
tion at the convention. First, a
woman of the Family Planning
Association proposed the
creation of local ‘support com-
mittees’ wherever prostitutes
are engaged in organized strug-
gle for their rights. This she said,
would give the movement added
political scope and impact,
involving a larger number of
people.

Second, a government official
belonging to the Socialist Party,
the largest parliamentary op-
position to the government of
Valery Giscard D’Estaing, rose to
express the Party's support of
the prostitutes’ demands. “It's
as if half the country took a step

in our direction,” said one
prostitute from Lyon.

Another result of the conven-
tion was a change in the leader-
ship of the organization of the
Paris prostitutes. The new mem-
ber of the leadership, Jackie, is a
40-year-old prostitute who was
an active trade unionist until cir-
cumstances forced her into
prostitution five years ago. She
also is the mother of two sons.

Police Prevent Demonstration

Several units of club-wielding
riot police formed a line to pre-
vent the thousands of prosti-
tutes and their supporters from
demonstrating after the
meeting. But a few hundred
people managed to circumvent
the police line and began
marching toward the National
Assembly, where deputies were
debating the budget.

Before they got very far, how-
ever, another crowd of riot police
charged them, roughly shoving
about fifty people into waiting
vans. Two of the prostitutes
were held on charges the next
day. In response, the French
Prostitutes’ Collective issued a
statement in protest of the police
attack. “Do you think you will
silence us with blows?” it read.
“The more we are attacked, the
more sympathizers we will
have.”

ERA Opponents’ Figures Faulty

If one could believe the op-
ponents of the Equal Rights
Amendment (ERA), as to the
numbers of people they claim
who are against ERA in Colo-
rado, then the population must
be undergoing quite an expan-
sion. Their figures do not correl-
ate with some known facts.

For example, at the hearings
held by the legislature on the
ERA this year, a total of 103
people testified. Of the total, 63
testified in favor of the ERA; 30
against; 8, neutral. Interesting
enough, 10 speakers were from
out of state which means the
number of pro-ERA Colorado
residents was 93. Thus, 2/3 of
the Coloradans testifying were
in favor of ERA.

In the testimony on religion,
17 testified in favor of the ERA;
10, against. 11 of the pro-ERA
religious speakers represented
large, national, religious organ-
izations.

When the committee con-
cluded its hearings, they voted
on both the federal and the Colo-
rado ERA’s. The tally was 5 to 4
in favor of the federal ERA and 7
to 0 in favor of the Colorado ERA.
Senator Schieffelin and Repre-
sentative Kennie abstained from
the Colorado ERA vote.

A few more numbers should
make it clear that Coloradans do
believe in equal rights. The Colo-
rado Coalition for Equal Rights is
an organization that brings to-
gether those who have en-

Herstory Project Announced

For nearly a year four Denver
women have been planning a
project to research and present
the role of women in the
development of Colorado. With a
recent grant from the Colorado
Centennial-Bicentennial Com-
mission, the Women in
Colorado: Hidden Faces project
has begun to prepare for a
touring graphic exhibit on
Colorado herstory. The Young
Women’s Christian Association
of Metropolitan Denver provides
sponsorship for Hidden Faces.

Dotty Jacobus, the program's
research coordinator, is
gathering information from
around the state to illustrate the
lifestyle of typical Anglo and
minority women. The exhibit will
explore the common situations
which brought women to the
state, how they lived and what
kinds of work they did, as well as
the social issues and
organizations which were im-
portant to them.

Readers who have access to
old photographs or documents of

Colorado women are en-
couraged to contact Dotty, par-
ticularly if the materials come
from outside the Denver area.
She also needs volunteers who
are seriously interested in
assisting with historical re-
search.

Mae West

According to project
coordinator Sherrie Branden-
stein, there is still a large need
for funds to produce the exhibit.
She is asking businesses and
foundations to provide support.
The staff plans several fund-
raising events for the coming
months, including a showing of
Mae West's film GOING TO
TOWN on Saturday, January 31
at University of Colorado-Denver
in coordination with the UCO
Women’s Center. The film will
be shown at 7:00 and 9:00 at the
UCD Auditorium for $3.00
regular admission and $2.50 for
students with I.D. The Hidden
Faces staff may be contacted at
Box 4623, Denver 80204 or by
calling 433-2179.

endorsed both the federal and the
Colorado ERA’s. These en-
dorsements have been done in
writing to the Coalition. At this
time 46 organizations have gone
on record in favor of the ERA.
These organizations are di-
verse; they include political, pro-
fessional, religious, social, and
educational organizations and
labor unions. Collectively, they
represent at least 130,000 ERA
supporters and more people are
joining with these ERA support-
ers every day.

Coloradans, overwhelmingly,
voted for the ERA in the past,
and they still do today.

Bare Tit Gets Brick

Ann Daniel

The Bare Tit, a coffeehouse,
has twice been the object of ver-
bal protest from women’s
groups in the area. (see Novem-
ber BMRA) The ownership was
told on both occasions that the
name of their establishment was
sexist and offensive to women.
The women stated that the
matter was not handled con-
structively by the owners on
those two occasions, and
something further than dia-
logue would be undertaken.

The women proceeded to
compose leaflets and launch
plans to organize picketing.
However, this was not enough
for some. Unrelated to, and in-
dependent of the women pro-
testing with leaflets and picket
plans, some person or persons
on 12 December hurled a brick
through the window of the Bare
Tit. The brick hurling was ac-
companied with a call to the
BMR office in which a voice
stated, “political action has just
been taken against the Bare Tit.”

This is the second time that
the Bare Tit has been the object
of a brick. Neither time have the
assailants been identified.

A strike begun September 10
by mostly women workers at 4
shrimp packing plants in Tampa,
Florida, could be the start of a
union organizing drive in the
Tampa shrimp industry which
employs 4,000 unorganized
workers.

Approximately 125 workers at
Tampa Maid have been on strike
since the company's offer in
September of $2.10 an hour
with no fringe benefits. The
strikers have affiliated them-
selves with the Amalgamated
Meatcutters Union.

Eleven workers have been ar-
rested on the picket lines and
several others beaten by police
in the weeks following the walk-
out, in which nearly 100% of the
workers at the plant
participated.

Half of the striking workers are
white, one-third are black, and
the remaining are Spanish-
speaking people from several
countries. A great measure of
unity has developed on the
picket lines, with workers often
singing “Black and White To-
gether, We Shall Not Be
Moved,” in both Spanish and
English.

One woman described the
cold, wet work where people are
forced to stand for long hours at
a wage of $2.10 an hour. “I’ve
already gotten pneumonia
once,” she said. “I’m poor. You
just have to stand there and take
it because you have to work for a
living.”

Union organizing in Tampa, as
throughout the South, is an up-
hill battle because of anti-union
“right to work” laws and the
courts’ willingness to grant anti-
picketing injunctions. In Tampa,
most of the shrimp workers work
in small sweatshops with no
protection from firings, while the
employers use the presence of
numerous unemployed people
in the area to prevent workers’
organizing.
