Nurses Fight Conspiracy

The Foreign Nurses Ad Hoc Committee,  
a group representing 33,000 foreign  
nurses working in the US, demanded last  
month an immediate investigation into  
discriminatory acts and criminal con-  
spiracy aimed at them. At issue is a  
proposal, soon to become federal law,  
that would require nurses to pass an  
exam overseas as a prerequisite for  
obtaining an American visa. The ad hoc  
committee says the test is culturally  
biased and that the US government and  
the American Nurses Association are  
conspiring to "discriminate, disenfran-  
chise and deny entry to qualified nurs-  
ing personnel from all over the world."  
Most of the 33,000 foreign nurses in  
the US are from the Philippines and  
they are calling for a nationwide nur-  
ses strike October 2nd, unless there  
is immediate action.

Chastity Belt Lowered

On a scale of 1 to 18, chastity is  
the least important criterion in sel-  
ecting a mate in the eyes of both fe-  
male and male college students accord-  
ing to an Arizona State University  
Study. Desire for home and children,  
never before below seventh among wo-  
men, has fallen to 10th. Until 1967,  
women preferred a greater age gap be-  
tween spouses than did men. The latest  
study says this position has been re-  
versed as has the number of preferred  
children. Women now prefer fewer  
children than do men.

Bringing Up Baby

The US Census Bureau reports that  
only a quarter of the women raising  
children alone are receiving child-  
support payments from absent fathers.  
The Bureau reports that 1.3 million  
divorced, separated, remarried or nev-  
er married mothers receive child sup-  
port payments averaging $2430 a fam-  
ily. The mothers most likely to re-  
ceive some child support from absent  
fathers were divorcees and well-edu-  
cated women.

Equality in Hurricanes?

Remember Anita plying her trade in  
the Gulf...Cekia wasn't as big as  
some of her older sisters... Belle's  
temper teased and threatened...and  
Blanche, perfectly formed. When hur-  
ricanes were exclusively female, not  
only were they described as "she,"  
they were often regarded as risque,  
sexy ladies by the media. But where  
have you heard Bob can't get it up  
or Impotent Bob stinks as a name? With  
Hurricane Bob, the media very quickly  
got down to describing the hurricane  
as "it," a part of the weather scene.

Brains Below the Belt

Female teacher: "The best physicist  
in my class is a girl." Male teacher:  
"Yes, but she's got a boy's brain."  
This story from the Birmingham Women  
and Science Conference shows why  
there are so few women scientists.

Blaming the Victim

A San Francisco cabbie who was fired  
from her job after being raped by a  
passenger she picked up has been re-  
hired. The taxi driver, Rosemary Bel-  
son, was originally fired by the  
Falcon Cab Company so that she could  
find safer employment. "I can't afford  
to take any chances. I'm lucky the cab  
wasn't hurt," said the owner of the  
cab company on why he wouldn't rehire  
Belsen. However, when Belsen charged  
that her dismissal was discriminatory,  
the owner agreed to “give her a sec-  
ond chance."

Rapist Culture

"Guys, if you're into beating up  
your wife, why don't you beat her up  
and then come to the performance of  
Battered Wives tonight." That's what  
WSAY broadcaster Jack Simmons is re-  
ported to have ad-libbed after he read  
an ad on the air for the Toronto punk  
rock group. His station manager told  
the New Women's Times, "it just must  
have been one of his quips."

The one-night summer appearance of  
the band in Rochester, New York—  
standing in front of their logo, a  
clenched fist with a red, blooddrip-  
ping lipstick kiss on it—was greeted,  
as they have been in other cities, by  

a group of women marching and chanting  
in support for women who have suf-  
fered in what protesters described  
as “rapist culture."

Bible Babble

A Wisconsin school district recent-  
ly expelled a young junior high  
school woman whose parents objected  
to her participation in physical edu-  
cation classes. Barbara and DeWayne  
Stebbins told the Port Edwards school  
board that their interpretation of  
the Bible leads them to believe that  
physical education is a form of “idol  
worship" and "produces masculinity  
on the part of girls." For these rea-  
sons, they forbade their daughter to  
participate in P.E., which is requir-  
ed for all students. The school board  
chose to expel the young woman for  
not meeting this requirement. The  
Stebbinses, whose son takes P.E. in  
the same school district with his  
parents' approval, say that the Bible  
clearly states that "girls should  
concentrate all their efforts on  
skills to be used in the home."

Closet Workers

A recent study in Boston's gay and  
lesbian communities found that two  
thirds of the women and men surveyed  
have kept their sexual orientation  
secret from their employers. Half of  
these "closeted workers" are seriously  
concerned that they would lose a pro-  
motion or be fired if their employers  
discovered their lesbianism or homo-  
sexuality. The survey was undertaken to  
help lobbying efforts for anti-dis-  
crimination legislation in Massachus-  
etts by showing the need for legal  
protection.

Silent No More

In a precedent-setting legal case  
for French women, three men from the  
south of France have been sentenced  
to serve four to six years in prison  
for the gang rape of two Belgian les-  
bians. This case was the first in  
France in which rape victims succeed-  
ed in being heard by the criminal  
court that judges serious crimes. The  
two-day trial provoked incidents of  
violence, with local men reportedly  
menacing, threatening and sometimes  
striking women lawyers, journalists  
and spectators.

Sperm Alert

The New England Journal of Medicine  
is out with a report linking cervical  
cancer in women to a virus carried by  
the male sperm. Doctors conducting  
the study found that the risk of cer-  
vical cancer for women whose partners  
had not had vasectomies was four  
times greater than for those women  
whose partners had been sterilized.  
This, the researchers say, supports  
theories that some agent in sperm  
which is absent in vasectomized men  
carries a cancer-causing virus.

Any Dose An Overdose

Pregnant women living near the  
Three Mile Island nuclear power plant  
will be studied during the next two  
years by scientists trying to learn  
how they are affected by low-level  
radiation, and by the fear of it. An  
estimated 8,000 women will give birth  
between March 28th, the day of the  
radiation leak, and March 27, 1981,  
who live within a ten-mile radius of  
the nuclear facility. Pregnant women  
living near the plant were advised  
to leave the area after the accident  
because their body tissues are parti-  
cularly susceptible to the effects of  
radiation.

Silkwood Upheld

A federal judge has rejected mo-  
tions by the Kerr-McGee Corp. to  
overturn the $10.5 million awarded the  
children of Karen Silkwood. Silkwood was  
a lab technician at Kerr-McGee's  
Cimarron nuclear facility when she  
died in a mysterious car crash in  
1974 en route to turn over documents  
of plant violations to a newspaper  
reporter. The $10.5 million was awarded  
to her children earlier this year after  
a federal court jury found Kerr-McGee  
guilty of negligence in the plu-  
tonium contamination of Silkwood  
and her apartment. It was the first  
such settlement in the nation involv-  
ing off-site contamination.

Prison Baby

A young Florida woman, who was  
sentenced to 7½ years in prison for  
a five dollar armed robbery (she  
had no previous record), left the  
Florida Correctional Institute for  
Women last month with her infant  
daughter who was born in prison and  
a $100 check from the state. Terry Jean  
Moore, 23, became the first Florida  
inmate to successfully sue the state  
under a 1969 law allowing women to  
retain custody of prison-born babies  
up to eighteen months. When her  
daughter, Precious, was born, Moore  
refused to let authorities take her  
away. Moore was paroled after serv-  
ing two years and her daughter serv-  
ing five months.

Crime of Feminism

Maria Rosa Dalla Costa, author of  
"The Power of Women and the Subver-  
sion of the Community" and a founding  
member of the International Feminist  
Collective, has been notified by It-  
alian authorities that she is being  
investigated and suspected of "par-  
ticipation in armed bands." Scores  
of activists have been arrested and  
put in prison in the wake of the pre-  
sent wave of repression in Italy.  
Magistrates have not justified their  
accusation against Dalla Costa, who  
for the last ten years has been act-  
ive in the Feminist Movement in Italy  
and internationally. It is clear, in  
fact, that this is precisely her  
crime and the magistrates are signal-  
ing their determination to criminal-  
ize the struggle women are making in  
Italy.

Break the Chains

A civil rights task force investi-  
gating conditions inside the Federal  
Correctional Institute for Women in  
Alderson, West Virginia has recommend-  
ed that the facility be "phased out.”  
In recommending the closure, the task  
force cited three issues that have  
been the object of protests by women  
inside Alderson—isolation, health  
care, and educational opportunities.

Earlier this year, the maximum sec-  
urity unit at Alderson was closed af-  
ter a storm of protests by prison  
activists charging that selection for  
the security unit had always been  
arbitrary and directed at politically  
active women. Among the women now  
held at Alderson are Lolita Lebron,  
one of the four Puerto Rican nation-  
alists who shot at members of Con-  
gress in the 1950s, and Rita D.  
Brown, a member of the Seattle-based  
George Jackson Brigade. Before her  
transfer to New Jersey, Black activ-  
ist Assata Shakur was also held at  
the facility.
