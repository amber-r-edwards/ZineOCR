Women In Ireland At War: Fighting

Women Against Imperialism &
Belfast Women's Center

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

The conflict between Ire-
land and England is almost
800 years old. The division
of Ireland in 1922 created
two states:

1. The 26 counties (later
to become Eire) were predom-
inantly Catholic, and the Ca-

tholic church held a special
position in the state.

2. Northern Ireland (or Ul-
ster) was predominantly Pro-
testant and dedicated to
maintaining the link with
Britain.

The present conflict is a
campaign dating from the War
of Independence which seeks
the reunification of Ireland.
Ireland is, however, a male-
dominated society both North
and South. Where we differ
from women in the South or
women in Britain is that our
situation is exacerbated by
the fact that the Royal Ul-
ster Constabulary (RUC), the
British Army and the Ulster
Defence Regiment are all arm-
ed. (The Royal Ulster Consta-
bulary is the Northern Irish
Police force. It is backed
up by the part-timers of the
Ulster Defence Regiment; both
forces are almost 100% Prote-
stant. They have several
times led, aided or simply
turned a blind eye to Loyal-
ist attacks upon the Catholic
minority.) Add to this four
major paramilitary groups and
at least another four minor
paramilitary groups who are
also armed and you arrive at
the position of an armed pat-
riarchy. It is not hard to
imagine the degrees of fear
that these men with their ea-
sy access to arms can inflict
on their wives and families,
and how they can resort to
weapons to impose their dic-
tates and standards on women.

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BACK-
GROUND

Northern Ireland is the
poorest region within the U-
nited Kingdom. We have the
highest unemployment rates,
lowest wages, poorest stock
of public housing and highest
cost of living. We have the
highest numbers claiming in-
validity benefit, a very high
percentage of single parent
families (mostly headed by
women), practically no child
day-care facilities and the
highest prison population.
After a long campaign by wo-
men's groups, new divorce
laws were introduced in April
1979. We have no abortion
law equivalent to the English
1967 Abortion Act; women seek-
ing abortion must travel to
England or seek out one of
the growing numbers of back
street abortionists.

THE PAST 12 YEARS

For the average working
class woman in Northern Ire-
land the conflict of the past
12 years has exacted a heavy
emotional toll. Riots, shoot-
ings and explosions as chil-
dren made their way to and
from school sent the consump-
tion of tranquilisers and
sleeping pills soaring. The
gutting of homes adjacent to
bomb targets or in the midst
of riot areas where petrol
bombs were used resulted in
homelessness. Raiding of
homes by the British Army has
often reduced the interior
and furnishings to waste.
Visiting relatives in jail
and supplying them with es-
sentials such as footwear has
depleted the meagre family
budget and created financial
hardship.

"Although the British
government keeps telling us
it is a ‘law and order’
problem, or a Catholic and
Protestant problem, or civ-
il unrest or just 'the
troubles', to me it was a
war situation from the very
beginning. Because you know
when I looked out of my
window what I saw was a
soldier with a gun pointing
in the window, and when I
went out to the back garden
to hang up the washing
there was a tank sitting in
the next door neighbour's
garden and the turret moved
around after me. . .and the
soldier came into my house
and put the gun up against
my neck and said 'Up agai-
nst the wall'. . . I just
couldn't think of that in
terms of a law and order
problem, or a civil unrest
problem, to me that was a
war. . . . So of course the
British presence affects us
as women--how can't it--
they're here.
(Mary, Derry housewife
and community activist.)

HOW DO WOMEN COPE IN THIS
SITUATION?

Because of the high percen-
tage claiming Unemployment
and Invalidity Benefit women
are forced to bring up fami-
lies--often larger than the
English average--at poverty
level. If they fall behind
with their rent, the Payment
of Debt Act will be used ag-
ainst them, which means both
current rent and a percentage
of arrears, plus a 50p admin-
istration fee, will be deduc-
ted at source from their
state benefits. Should they
fall behind in their electri-
city payments they will face
the prospect of either sign-
ing an agreement to start
paying current consumption
charges immediately and at
the same time pay off arrears
--no matter how large--within
a two year period, or have
their electricity supply cut
off.

NATIONALISM AND THE INVOLVE-
MENT OF WOMEN

Irish history shows that
women have always played a
significant role in the nat-
ional struggle. Their ener-
gies have been poured into
fund raising, welfare work,
providing accommodation and
campaigning. Women have, how-
ever, seldom risen to posi-
tions of authority except
where they have adopted the
male ideals, aims, and dis-
cipline of the movement.

The failure of feminist is-
sues to emerge as part of the
overall policy of any of the
movements is proof of this.
This view is not surprising
given the historical link be-
tween Irish Catholicism and
Nationalism, which even in
this day and age manifests
itself when such organisa-
tions tar and feather women
who break the "Moral Code"
for instance by going out
with other men while their
husbands are in jail.

PRISONERS IN "A" WING

The condition of the women
prisoners in “A" Wing of Ar-
magh jail is undoubtedly bad
--but so is the condition of
all women prisoners. The dem-
onstrations outside Armagh
jail on International Women's
Day have done little to indi-
cate that the overall posi-
tion of female prisoners is
of importance to the organi-
sers of the demonstration.
This year, for example, the
Derry Women Against Imperial-
ism group demanded improve-
ments for "prisoners of war"
alone. The difficulties
faced by "ordinary" prisoners
were ignored.

NATIONALISM VS. LIBERATION?

The views of individual
members of Derry Women's Aid
differ somewhat in emphasis,
but as a group which works
with battered women who come
to us from across the border
in Southern Ireland, we are
well aware of the fact that
the condition of women there
is far worse than that of wo-
men from the North. It is
naturally of some concern to
us that the unification of
Ireland would mean a transfer
of power from English to I-
rish men. The women of Nor-
thern Ireland would as a re-
sult move from a male-con-
trolled society into a male-
and church-controlled socie-
ty. National liberation, in
our view, is only progressive
when it can be seen to be
leading towards socialism and
a society in which women's
liberation will be facilita-
ted and effected.

The uncritical support giv-
en by some English feminists
to the nationalist struggle
being waged here in Northern
Ireland is of little help to
us, or indeed, to the women
in the whole of Ireland. The
ability of English feminists
to concentrate on the nation-
al liberation struggle is a
luxury we can't afford. While
they dwell on the ideologies
of the situation, we are con-
fronted by, and have to work
with, the practicalities that
result from violence, home-
lessness, poverty and conser-
vative attitudes.

The struggle for women's
liberation will at times en-
tail confrontation with the
British Army and state insti-
tutions, but it will also in-
volve challenging the atti-
tudes of church, political
and paramilitary groups. With
the help and support of other
feminists our struggle for
women's liberation would be-
come a lot easier.

WOMEN'S LIB-

international

Back Against The Armed Patriarchy

A group of women who were
members of the women's com-
mittee of the International
Tribunal on Britain's Pres-
ence in Ireland went to Nor-
thern Ireland in 1978. They
wanted to find out what the
British presence means speci-
fically for women.

We realised during our vis-
it how widespread sexual as-
sault and harassment have be-
come. Sexual intimidation by
the Army and the Royal Ulster
Constabulary (RUC) should not
be regarded as just one more
form of brutality amongst ma-
ny, nor as simply another ex-
ample of men's sexism. What
disturbed us most is that
sexual assault and intimida-
tion appear to be increasing-
ly used as a conscious and in-
tegral part of the interroga-
tor's technique.

If younger women and girls
are subjected to it more than
older women--as it appears--
this surely isn't because
they make more "attractive"
victims, but on account of
the added sexual vulnerabili-
ty that goes with their
youth. Many of them will be
virgins. With those girls
who are unmarried but are
sexually experienced (and,
with surveillance being what
it is, this is something the
Army and RUC will usually
know) the interrogators often
attempt to induce guilt in
them by slagging them as
whores and sluts.

"They said I would be
raped and nobody would
know about it because I
was only a wee slut any-
way. One of them said
he would get two men in
to rape me and he wouldn't
be surprised if he
went into the room and
my clothes were lying in
one corner and me in a-
nother."

(Statement by a 19-year-
old girl)

In all this they are able
to capitalise upon the strict
morality within the community,
and the silence on sexual
matters, which leaves girls
very ill-equipped to with-
stand treatment of this kind.
It is this kind of treat-
ment which is used to "en-
courage" women into signing
statements of guilt. Ninety
percent of all convictions
for terrorist offences are
obtained on the basis of sig-
ned statements alone. In other
words, there is no evidence
save the statement the woman
or man has signed, often af-
ter days of torture. Prison-
ers frequently appear in
court hardly able to stand,
their injuries and bruises
obvious for all to see.

Unfortunately, there is no
jury to see them; the British
Government dispensed with
such democratic luxuries for
the special Courts. Instead,
evidence is heard by one
judge alone. There doesn't
even appear to be much pre-
tence at impartiality; "tri-
als" which result in people
being sent down for 14, 15
years have sometimes lasted
no more than 25 minutes. And
there have been numerous
cases of prisoners appearing
in court undefended, because
they have not been allowed to
see a solicitor.

Solidarity: No Liberation In Isolation

Ed note: The following inter-
view was edited and reprinted
from Newsfront International.
Translated from Arbeiterkampf,
West German bi-weekly. The
interview is with Maureen Gib-
son, a member of the H-block-
Armagh-Committee. Gibson, who
had been imprisoned in Armagh
Prison in Northern Ireland
from 1977 to the end of 1980,
took part in the strikes held
by women prisoners.

Q. At the Women's Congress in
Dublin, which took place on
March 7 in solidarity with the
women in Armagh, weren't there
different views on the quest-
ion of women's liberation?

A. I was not in Dublin but at
a similar Women's Congress in
Belfast, where there were also
considerable differences ex-
pressed. The representative
of Sinn Fein (Ourselves Alone)
the political arm of the Pro-
visional IRA presented Sinn
Fein's new women's program
and explained how women in
Northern Ireland have emanci-
pated themselves since the
beginning of the civil war in
1969. While she was present-
ing the women's program,
which supports divorce and
birth control but, as before,
is totally against abortion,
a whisper went around the
room. Sinn Fein means to say
that abortion will be made
unnecessary. In the "New Ire-
land" there will be available
contraceptives, childcare, an
end to discrimination against
unwed mothers and so on.

The question of abortion
was only one conflict among
the women present. Another
was the exclusion of men from
women's events. We discussed
that in prison, too, and most
of us didn't see any differ-
ence between the situation of
men and women in jail. We
have always dealt with men
on an equal basis, so we ne-
ver thought about the quest-
ion of self-liberation. In
Northern Ireland there is a
natural feeling of solidarity
among men and women. We need
each other in order to sur-
vive.

I myself don't find it
right to exclude men from
women's events. I believe
that we must educate them,
that we must explain how this
society and men themselves
oppress women.

Q. Do you believe that it is
important for Ireland to have
a women's movement that con-
cerns itself primarily with the
interests and needs of women?

A. Yes, of course. I didn't
mean that it's not necessary
to have a movement. Just the
opposite. But in Northern Ire-
land you can't lead one strug-
gle and ignore the other.

Q. Not only within Sinn Fein
but throughout Ireland it ap-
pears that the women's ques-
tion is now being discussed
more and more. Why do you
think that is?

A. Women today are more poli-
tically aware. Ten years ago
a woman was concerned only
with her own home. She had
too many of her own problems
to find time to sit down and
discuss other people's pro-
blems. But as the situation
changed in Northern Ireland,
so did the women. Women were
sharply confronted by this
change in 1975 when thousands
of men were arrested and the
women were left alone with the
children. They had to be both
mothers and fathers. Many wo-
men had to assume many diff-
erent responsibilities: the
house, business and politics.
Many began to get involved in
Sinn Fein or other groups and
within these groups they saw
the possibility to push for
women's liberation.

When women think about their
problems as women, they can't
separate one revolution from
another.
