Women’s Health Clinic Resists Harassment

Vicki Ziegler

The Women’s Health Service
Clinic of Colorado Springs,
recently experienced its first
community harassment. The
incident involved a minor who
came to the clinic for an abor-
tion procedure. Because Colo-
rado law concerning minors is
ambiguous (even more so in
Colorado Springs, where it has
not yet been tested through the
courts), the clinic’s position was
tenuous. The problems experi-
enced came from several out-
side sources: primarily the girl's
parents, the health department
and the school district.

Policy on Minors

The Clinic's policy concern-
ing minors and abortion, since
opening in October 1975, has
been to advise every client in ad-
vance that parental consent is
required for any woman under
the age of 18. A husband's con-
sent for women living with their
spouses is also required. The
clinic’s history form asks age
and date of birth; but does not
require identification. It is poli-
cy during counseling to ascer-
tain whether or not the woman
requesting the abortion pro-
cedure has outside support. This
might include the support of her
spouse, her boyfriend, her
parents, or her friends. Women
are actively encouraged to con-
fide in their parents, if that is a
possibility for them, and to elicit
their support. Clearly, there are
many young women for whom
this is not a realistic possibility.
At the time of this particular inci-
dent, the clinic had never dealt
with a minor who had not al-
ready told one or both of her
parents about the pregnancy.

The first indirect contact with
the minor in this case was
through a telephone conversa-
tion with her school social
worker. The social worker called
the clinic and requested infor-
mation about abortion and about
requirements for minors. She
was informed that Colorado law
requires parental consent for
anyone under the age of 18, but
that the clinic does not require
identification proving a woman's
age. The young woman involved
decided, based on this in-
formation, that she would lie
about her age on the forms she
would fill out in the clinic. We
still did not know her name.

Panel Discusses Abortion

Lynette Cazeau

In 1973, when the United
States Supreme Court decided
Roe vs. Wade, it was easy to be-
lieve that a woman's right to
choose to abort would be given
the protection that a newly
recognized constitutional right
deserved. Not so, however, as
those attending the 1976 Wes-
tern Regional Conference on
Rep. Sarah Weddington of
Texas, who argued Wade before
the court, characterized a
woman's right to choose to abort
as “fundamental.” It was thus
given the same importance as
the right to marry whomever (of
the opposite sex) you choose, to
establish a home and bring up
children, to be free from
sterilization against your will, to
choose to be pregnant and bear
the child, or to opt against preg-
nancy by using contraceptives.
All these rights, characterized as
“fundamental,” are protected
from any governmental intru-
sion, unless the state can show
what is known as a “compelling
interest.”

In Wade, the court found that
the state, if it wanted to, could

Client and H.S. Counselor

The second contact came from
her school nurse, an employee
of the health department who
works in the school several days
each week. The nurse had pre-
viously referred several young
women to the clinic, all of whom
had the consent of one or both
parents. She had been counsel-
ing this client to tell her mother
about the pregnancy, and had
learned from the social worker
that the young woman planned
to come to the clinic and obtain
an abortion without her parents’
consent. The nurse was hostile
because she had lost control of
this particular case. She infor-
med the clinic that the client was
15 years old and had been coun-
seled by us. As it turned out,
neither of these things was true.

Meanwhile, the young woman
did finally come to the clinic for
pregnancy screening and coun-
seling, but without clinic staff
knowledge as to her identity.
She signed the forms as an 18-
year-old, was thoroughly
counseled about the proce-
dure. A laminaria was inserted
that day (the dilating device
which is inserted the day before
an abortion procedure). The fol-
lowing morning a second call
was received from the health de-
partment nurse who threatened
to call the woman's parents and
close down the clinic if the abor-
tion were done. (The latter threat
was implied, but was clearly a
threat.)

Shortly after this call (in which
the client was named for the first
time), Mary (pseudonym) came
into the clinic for her abortion
procedure.

Father Threatens Clinic

The nurse had demanded that
the clinic not proceed with the
abortion. Medically this was not
possible, since the laminaria had
been inserted the day before.
She was informed of this fact,
and she immediately called
Mary’s parents. The father
called the clinic and, after re-
ceipt of written permission from
his daughter, was told the facts
in the situation. Both parents
were invited to come to the clinic
for a consultation with the doc-
tor and the staff. When they
came it was eminently clear to
clinic personnel that dialogue
would be next to impossible. The

constitutionally regulate abor-
tions as follows: (1) to protect the
woman's health in the first tri-
mester, it can require that a
licensed physician perform the
abortion; (2) to protect the
woman's health in the second
trimester, the state can re-
gulate the entire medical proce-
dure; and (3) to protect the in-
capability of meaningful life out-
side the mother's womb.

Guideline

Like most constitutional
decisions, Wade did not so much
settle the issue as it opened the
debate. For example, in a Connec-
ticut case decided by the U.S.
Supreme Court last November,
the Court upheld the conviction
of an abortionist on the grounds
that he was not licensed as a
physician.

In so doing, the Court ex-
plained that the rationale for its
liberal holding in Wade was the
fact that, under modern medical
procedures, the patient mortal-
ity rate in first trimester abor-
tions is at least as safe as in
childbirth. The Court's view, was
that for that low mortality rate, the
presence of a licensed physician was essential. Thus it
would be irrational under Wade
to allow a non-licensed phy-
sician to perform abortions.

Cyril Means, professor at
New York Law School, pointed
out that abortions in the first tri-
mester are more than “at least
as safe” as childbirth — they are
at least eight times as safe.

A case which will be argued
before the U.S. Court

process: (1) “viability”
defined exactly as the Supreme
Court defined it, thus failing to
address a problem specific to
legislation, namely, how will an
abortionist know whether or not
she is violating the statute if she
has to guess whether the fetus
had the capability of meaningful
life outside the mother's womb at
the time it was aborted? Criminal
statutes must be clear, e.g. “viability occurs at 28
weeks.” (2) The abortionist is re-
quired to attempt to save the
fetus just as though she were
assisting in a live birth. This pro-
vision was struck at the trial
court level as directly in opposi-
tion to Wade's characterization.

The nurse implied that she could
be fired for “interfering” and being
“unprofessional”; and she
implied that this incident could
“close down the clinic.”

Parental Consent Not Required

The Clinic’s attorney, adher-
ing to Federal District Court
ruling by Judge Finesilver, Feb.
1975, concluded that parental
consent is in fact not required
under present Colorado law. The
nurse informed the clinic that
she would have health depart-
ment lawyers check into this.
Clinic staff members also sug-
gested that she herself had
acted quite unprofessionally in
betraying the confidentiality of
her client. Her response to this
was that the girl was “half-witted,” immature, and not clever
enough to carry it off by herself.
In the opinion of clinic staff who
work with her, Mary is a normal
16-year-old. The nurse reiterated
that she felt the rights of the
parents in this case to be more
important than the rights of the
minor woman. The meeting was
basically a stalemate. The nurse
insisted that the clinic require id-
entification for minors or prove
to her that Colorado law doesn't
require this. Clinic staff sug-
gested that she begin informing her
minor clients of their right to
abortion, with or without the
consent of their parents.

Report Pregnancies

The clinic's next meeting was
with the social worker, at her re-
quest. She was extremely upset
about the lack of confidentiality
in the school system. She in-
formed us that she had been ad-
vised by school officials that she
must report immediately any
knowledge of a pregnancy or
abortion coming out of a coun-
seling session with a high
school woman. She was also
concerned about her own job
and the school nurse’s threats
and disparaging remarks about
her to school officials and to us.
She informed us that the nurse
(in a mandatory meeting with
Mary, the principal, the dean of
students, the social worker, the
nurse and Mary’s parents) had
said she would see Women’s
Health Service closed down.

The clinic found itself in the
very uncomfortable position of
facing a potential court battle.
Although secure in the right-
ness of their actions and in the
prospects of probable victory,
the potential damage a court
case, at this particular time,
could cause was intimidating.
The clinic has been open only six
months. Clientele is small and
relatively poor. Community sup-
port is ever-growing, but still un-
tested. A restraining order clos-
ing the clinic would remove the
only secure revenue available
for fighting a court battle. Fortu-
nately, the court cases which
have been won in Denver were
held to be valid in Colorado
Springs by the District Attor-
ney's office. They announced
that 16 is now considered legal
age, which cleared the clinic of
any possible wrongdoing.
(Mary, it turned out, was not 15
as the nurse had told us; she was
16½ and therefore of legal age.)
They also mentioned that be-
cause the Colorado law on statu-
tory rape had recently changed
the age of consent to 15, they
would no doubt use that age as
age of consent for abortion as
well. As a result of this incident,
clinic policy has been changed in
line with this legal advice.

The repercussions of the case
have not yet ended. Clinic staff
has subsequently met with
school and health department
officials, discussing at length
both legal and operating
policies, as well as confidential-
ity between school personnel
and students.

There was a brief attempt to
prevent the clinic from carrying
out an important school district
workshop scheduled for April.
The workshop involves sexual-
ity and contraceptive education
for all school social workers and
health educators, with the op-
tion to attend a several-session
increment course taught by the
Women’s Health Service staff.
To lose this workshop would
have been a critical stab at com-
munity credibility and outreach
and education program. Be-
cause the case was fairly tight,
and because of the support of
several important community
people, the workshop will take
place as scheduled. On the sur-
face of things, this ends the case
of this particular minor.

The problems raised in this in-
cident, unfortunately, have been

Legal Aspects

of the woman as the physician's sole patient. The state is now
arguing that this provision
should be interpreted to apply
only if the fetus is born alive. (3)
The statute requires that a minor
woman must have the consent
of her parents, and a married
woman is not involved in the choice
whether to bear the child. Also
involved is the married woman's
legal autonomy from her hus-
band, who under the statute has
the veto power even if he is not
the begetter of the fetus. (4)
Finally, the statute limits the
methods by which abortion may
be performed by making saline
abortions criminal. Professor
Means stated that in no other
field of medical jurisprudence
does the law intrude upon a
physician's discretion in this
manner. He said that, while sa-
line abortions may not be al-
ways as safe as other proce-
dures, they are still safer than
childbirth, and in some indivi-
dual circumstances, they are a
more appropriate procedure
which doctors in their medical
discretion should be free to

A New York statute currently
being challenged provides a dif-
ferent illustration of the attack
on the right to abort. The statute
limits Medicaid coverage of
abortions to those “medically in-
dicated,” or to terminate preg-
nancies resulting from rape or
incest. The Circus Court of Ap-
peals struck the statute down on
the ground that a state has no
power to add restrictions to
federal money. Should the U.S.
Supreme Court reverse on this
point, the remaining question
will be whether it is constitu-
tional to coerce a woman in the exer-
cise of her right to choose abor-
tion by providing economic incen-
tives for childbirth.

Boston illustrates the way court-
room tactics are being em-
ployed in the battle for the
legality of getting a criminal
conviction for abortion under
present statutes. The case in-
volved a late-term abortion by the
hysterotomy method. This
method is similar to a small
Caesarean section. The prose-
cution, during the whole course
of the trial, kept referring to the
fetus as “born” from the time.
