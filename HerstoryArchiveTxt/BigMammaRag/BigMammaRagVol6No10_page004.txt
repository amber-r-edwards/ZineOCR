The Trauma of Incest

Judy Barlow

The December 1977 issue of  
Penthouse featured an article  
entitled "Incest, the Last Taboo."  
But according to a survey by  
Psychiatric Quarterly, one-third of  
all female children are sexually  

abused before they reach 18. One  
incest really is the  
color of it, if it is talking about  
incest that is taboo.

*87% of victims are female children  
(DeFrancis)

*90% are father-daughter or step-  
father-step-daughter (Maisch)

*Sexual abuse is one of three prim-  
ary reasons why children run away  
from home.  --Runaway Newsletter

The Children

"Daddy used to make me sit on  
his lap all the time, and he used to  
rub against me with his thing all  
hand until he got all red in the  
face and would very abruptly push  
me down.”

Most studies of incest try to  
stereotype the victims. One of  
the more common stereotypes is that  
the victims are children of poor  
families where there are conditions  
of overcrowding and too little  
money. Other studies describe the  
victims as seductive and claim that  
the victims bring on the assaults  
or that they fantasize or exaggerate  
their experiences out of proportion.

"Nobody would have believed me.  
Daddy was a big executive. He was  
a member of the Community Chest, the  
Rotary Club and always had his  
picture in the paper."

In her book Conspiracy of Silence:  
The Trauma of Incest, Sandra Butler  

says, "Victims are white, black,  
Latin, and Asian. They are male  

and female. They are 5, 7 and 12  
years old. They are fat, skinny,  
ugly, beautiful, poor, wealthy and  
middle class. Incest is relentlessly  
democratic."

"I felt so different from the other  
kids in school. I was sure that if  
I wasn't careful they would be able  
to tell something about me. I never  
even laughed out loud until just  
a few years ago. I tried to be  
invisible.”

"I didn't know that it didn't  
happen in everybody's family. Daddy  
told me it was natural and he was  
just teaching me the facts of life.”

Although the victims of incestuous  
assault show few similarities,  
many exhibited similar reactions.  
Almost all of them felt guilty for  
somehow being responsible for the  
attacks. Many of them accepted  
total blame. Most of them tried to  
make excuses for their fathers.  
Many thought, at at least one point,  
that the sexual assaults were not  
real, but only a “dream.” Many  
have sexual problems such as frigid-  
ity as adults. All of them have  
been betrayed.

"That night I got a razor and  
tried to cut off my skin. I wanted  
to destroy the thing that had  
caused me all the trouble and  
confusion and hurt--my body."

Many young women felt a sense of  
loss of both parents. They often  
felt that they couldn't tell their  
mothers or felt she must know and  

just was not willing to do anything  
about it. Many women interviewed  
expressed more anger toward their  
mothers than their fathers. The  
reaction shows, however, not how  
much more responsible the mothers  
are, but rather how we are conditioned  
into expecting more from our  
mothers. Just as mothers are to  
blame for homosexual sons and delin-  
quent children, they are also  
blamed for incestuous attacks on  
their children.

"At first, I think I was about 3,  
he only used to have oral sex with  
me. Then he would hold my head  
tight between his legs and push  
me around until I sucked him off.  
"Get your vanilla milk shake," he  
used to say. But one night when I  
was about seven and he was drunk--  
well, he penetrated me. I screamed  
and cried all night. I will never  
forget that pain. It felt like  
he was pushing into me up to my  
throat. I felt like I would choke  
or vomit or die from the pain. I  
bled for days and couldn't even walk.  
You know, he kept me home from  
school for a week--just so no one  
could tell."

The Fathers

Incestuous aggressors are uncom-  
fortably familiar. They have been  
raised in traditional homes. They  
believe in the traditional roles  
of husband as strong provider and  
wife as housekeeper-mother-sex object.  
They do not know how to talk about  
their feelings. Most of them are  
not illiterate, violent or alcoholic.

"I don't know if I was trying to  
punish my wife or my mother. I  
just got so confused.”

An overwhelming number of sexually  
abusive fathers interviewed felt  
they had done nothing wrong. Several  
others said that they were “initiating”  
their daughters. Others claimed  
their daughters acted seductively.  
One of the most common reasons the  
fathers gave for sexually abusing  
their daughters was that it was  
their wives' fault for not satisfying  
their sexual needs. Once again, the  
woman is at fault.

"When I finally confronted him  
about it 20 years later, he denied  
it, then he hit me, and then said  
"So what?" I mean he neatly didn't  
see anything wrong with what he had  
done to me."

Psychiatrists have categorized  
sexually abusive fathers as adult-  
children. They have relinquished  
fathers of blame by classifying them  
as children who are not responsible  
for their own actions. They blame  
the father's childhood experiences  
and of course his mother.

The Mothers

When a woman is married she is  
told that being a good wife is the  
most important job in her life. When  
she has children she is told that  
being a good mother is the most  
important job in her life. No wonder  
there is a dichotomy when she has  
to make a choice. "Mothers who  
consciously or unconsciously avoid  
knowledge of the sexual aggression  
of their spouses in order to maintain  
a precarious sense of security  
in their lives, however ephemeral,  
pay the highest price a woman can  
pay; the offering up of her children."  
(Butler)

"Yes, I guess I really knew what  
was happening, but what could I do?  
I’m married when I was 16, I never  

had a job and he was making money  

by then. Once I went home to my  
parents and took the kids and all of  
their stuff with me. I was really  
going to leave him. But my mother  
said, "You made your own bed, now lie  
in it." After all, what could I do?

The predominately male psychiatric  
community has found many ways to  
blame mothers for incestuous assaults  
on their children by men. Some  
theorists claim that the mother  
identifies with the child and is  
gratifying her own incestuous desire  
for her fathers. Others claim that  
mothers set the stage for a role  
reversal in which her daughter acts  
as her mother to fulfill a relation-  
ship she never had with her own  
mother. Women are accused of  
"deserting" their husbands emotionally  
and sexually, forcing their child-  
ren to assume that role. "Desertion"  
includes a mother’s taking a job,  
developing an outside interest,  
having another child or being emotion-  
ally or physically unable to assume  
her wife/mother role.

"It made me feel terrible, like I  
was one of his "other" women. I  
was competing with my own mother."

Just as the psychiatric community  
allows men to assume the role of  
child, it also gives women as wives  
the responsibility for caring for  
this adult-child-husband, and there-  
fore makes her responsible for his  
actions.

"I never actually told her what  
my father was doing, but my God, the  
evidence could have! There were  
bloody panties, semen-stained pajamas,  
soaked sheets. Everything was right  
there for her to see. And she chose  
not to."

Getting Help

There are few places where victims  
of incestuous assault can go to get  
help. Most school counselors claim  
that it just isn't a problem in  
their schools. Most clergymen claim  
it isn't a problem in their religious  
community. Most welfare workers say  
it doesn’t come up very often. But  
when it does, no one seems to want  
to listen.

"When I was 5 I got gonorrhea from  
my father. Do you believe it? The  
doctors and nurses never said a word.  
No one ever asked me how I got it.  
I'm sure that they could tell that  
something was wrong down there. They  
just kept talking about dirty sheets  
and toilet seats. No one ever  
asked.

Most victims of incestuous assault  
tried to tell someone at some time, but  
no one usually listened. They were  
frequently punished for telling or  
told that their daddy was a nice man  
and it wasn't nice to say things like  
that about him. Adults are frequently  
unbelieving--just will not believe  
what the child has to say.

"Things got so bad that I ran  
away from home when I was 12, but the  
cops found me. I finally got up  
enough nerve to tell the officer  
why I had run away. Anything was  
better than being sent back there.  
I had to tell a whole string of  
faceless people my story. They never  
looked at me. They just took notes  
and stared at the floor when I spoke.  
One man came back and said that my  
dad was a minister and well-respected  
in the community. He said I should  
never even think things like that  
about him, let alone say them.”

Sometimes the father is sent to  
prison. The daughter is made to feel  
guilty and responsible. Frequently  
the loss of income, the shame, and  
the guilt are too much for the mother  
to bear and she takes it out on the  
already abused child. Rarely is the  
mother-daughter relationship unaffected.

After Effects

"I'm 62 now. My brother raped me  
frequently from the time I was  
4 or 5 until I was 17. I was never  
intimate with anyone again until  
I was 50 and that was with a woman. I  
was asexual--never even masturbated.  
You know, now that my life is almost  
over it's finally begun.”

Living through incest is only part  
of the battle. The scars remain.

"You know, I can't even go down on  
my husband. That makes me sad--like  
I'm depriving him of something. I  
just know it would make me vomit."

The degree of violence or trauma  
involved in the incestuous assaults  
seems to have very little to do with  
how many scars a woman carries  
through her life. One woman whose  
father was only an exhibitionist is  
now confined to a mental hospital  
with a poor prognosis for recovery.  
Another woman who became pregnant  
with and bore her father's child at  
13 appears to have survived with  
few scars.

"The first time I had sex with a  
man, it all came flooding back. It  
just really hurt."

Comments

Before we can begin to deal with  
stopping incestuous assault, we  
must first place the blame where it  
belongs. No amount of extenuating  
family circumstances or bad childhood  
experiences relieve the man of blame.  
It was he alone as an adult who  
initiated sex with his child. He and  
he alone must assume responsibility  
for his actions.

We must dispel the myth that women  
are responsible for everything that  
goes wrong within the family. We must  
dispel the myth that a 3-year-old  
child knows what being seductive  
means. We must learn to talk about  
incest, to listen, to expose, to  
punish.

The problem begins in the family.  
If the family is so sacred that keeping  
it intact and together takes presi-  
dence over protecting a child from  
abuse, it must be changed. Within  
the family one human being is truly  
the possession of others. Not even  
a child's body is her own.

We are given a lot of chances to  
develop sexual relationships, but  
only one chance at having loving,  
caring parents.

"I learned to hate my body. He  
would have oral sex with me for hours  
it seemed. He wouldn't stop until  
I would reach orgasm. Then he would  
say, "See, you really do enjoy it as  
much as I do.” I felt betrayed by  
my own body!"
