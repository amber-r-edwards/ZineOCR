Early Lessons - Getting A’s in Anger

Sable A. Walls  
age 115  

To me sexism is:

Having the gym teacher telling only  
BOYS to take the equipment out and  
not even letting the girls try, giv-  
ing boys "A's" in gym when they can't  
do shit and giving girls "B's" and  
"C's" when they can do something.

Here are some other sexist things:

Boys grabbing your ass because they  
like the feel. Boys snapping your  
bra (if you wear one). Having boys  
say things like "Ah Shaddup you're  
only a girl so you can't do nuthin',"  
if the teacher is male he might give  
higher grades to the girls with big  
busts! THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THEY  
GOT HIGHER GRADES!

A girl at Teller Elementary (1150  
Garfield) got molested by about 10-  
20 boys (5th and 6th grades). At lun-  
chtime they came up to her and got  
her down and took all of her clothes  
off and threw them around. Then they  

played search and solve with her body.

The thing that surprises me is that  
the gym teacher (a woman) was about  
5 feet from them and didn't do any-  
thing except suspend them for 5 days!  
Hell! I would have lined those boys  
up in front of a firing squad.

Mother and Child Abuse

Diane Scheeler

There's been a lot of publicity  
lately about child abuse. This is  
the Year of the Child. These two  
things may explain the sudden con-  
cern of so many media and social  
service agencies about what is a real  
and very bad problem.

What we don't hear about in the  
straight media is the times when the  
police and social workers use the  
excuse of controlling child abuse to  
violate mother's civil rights, inclu-  
ding the right to protection from  
search and seizure without a warrant.  
Poorer women and welfare mothers are  
naturally more vulnerable to this  
type of police abuse.

In the housing projects where a  
Denver feminist lives, poverty and  
racism, all the hostility and petti-  
ness just propagate the violent cli-  
mate. On Wednesday p.m. a long stan-  
ding feud finally exploded between her  
and a family along the same row  
of projects. Someone called the cops  
who arrived on the scene and demanded  
to be let into the woman's apartment.  
She refused to let them in. In the  
report later, the cops said she was  
"hysterical" and that they suspected  
child abuse. She said, "Of course  
I was hysterical -- I didn't want  
them to take my kids." Because of her  
being "uppity" and not cooperating,  
the police got in and hauled her  
7 and 2 year old children out of bed  
where they'd been sleeping peaceful-  
ly at 11 p.m., took them to the fam-  
ily crisis center and kept the terri-  
fied children overnight. The next

morning, the mother had to be very  
cool and even say that she thought  
the search and seizure was "justi-  
fied" in order to get her kids back.  
The children luckily had no bruises  
or scrapes like kids normally have.  
If the doctor's examination had tur-  
ned up bruises, or if she had come  
in cursing and demanding her child-  
ren back, she could have lost cus-  
tody, perhaps forever. This long-  
standing practice of Social Service  
and the police force is dangerous.  
Apparently there's nothing you can  
do if you have kids and this should  
happen to you, except know that you  
need to be cool, and take friends  
with you when you go to pick up  

your kids. There has to be a hearing  
72 hours after the kids are picked  
up at which time they must formally  
charge you with child abuse if they  
haven't released your kids yet.

You do have the right to have a law-  
yer at this hearing and it's probably  
a good idea.

There is a real class bias here as  
to who gets picked as a child abuser.  
So many upper and middle class women  
got abused as kids, yet their folks  
were never turned in because that  
kind of thing isn't supposed to hap-  
pen in richer families. That dynamic  
is still true.

But all feminists need to be aware  
of this potential new harassment.  
If our homes can be broken into  
because someone "suspects" child a-  
buse with no reasonable grounds to  
do so, what other excuses can they  
find and what use can be made of  
free access to our private lives?

There are things in school you  
wouldn't believe that's going on.  
For instance, at Teller Elementary  
School, the girls all have huge  
busts! And the boys are very chau-  
vinistic and sexist, you wouldn't  
believe it! And the girls all wear  
tight, tight jeans and shirts that  
show their bras. All the “cool” boys  
have or are going with the sexy big  
busted girls.

But if you think that's bad, it's  
only the beginning!

One boy in school thinks one of  
the big busted girls is in love with  
him. He goes around molesting her  
by putting his hand between her legs  
and rubs her vagina! And if you think  
that's bad, he makes her kiss him!

That very same girl was also stripped!!  
All of her clothes taken off!!  
And on the playground!!

Kickball in my school is unfair to  
the girls. Whenever we play kickball  
and our team is up to kick and we're  
in line------ , the girls are at the  
end of the line. They don't get a  
vote, they're in the back if they're  
good or not. By the time we get to  
kick we have too many outs and most  
of the time we lose.

August 10, 1978: I woke up around  
3:30 a.m. with strong, steady con-  
tractions. It was finally happening!  

everything I could find, taking  
classes, and generally preparing my  
mind and body for this day. I called  
my friends Karen and Lisa and they  
were here by 4:30 a.m., anxious and  
excited. The three of us drank tea  
and went over the lists of "who does  
what when" until 5 a.m., when I  
called my midwife Carol. She had  
just moved to the mountains, so I  
left a message with the answering  
service. I was still in early labor,  

around 7 a.m. I figured most people  
were getting ready for work, so I  
got on the phone and let everyone  
know what was happening. We woke up  
Terry, my roommate, around 8, which  
was about the time “the gang" star-  
ted showing up. It was also the time  
my labor started getting intense, so  
we moved into the bedroom and got  
things set up. My midwife showed up  
around 10 a.m. and took over. She  
checked my dilation and found I was  
already opened up to 7 cm. My con-  
tractions were about three minutes  
apart, and I was having to concen-  
trate to get through each contrac-  
tion. Carol put her things in order  

We got halfway through that when I  
had a contraction and had to quit.

So we waddled back into the bedroom.

For nine long months I'd been reading  

so we just hung out and relaxed until

massaged constantly, and I got lots  
of verbal support from everyone.

Around 1:30 p.m., Carol decided to  
break the waters. I was 9 cm, dila-  
ted, and getting anxious to see who  
was hiding out in me. As soon as my  
waters were broken, I went into  
transition. For 45 minutes, I had  
intense, back-to-back contractions.  
That was heavy. There were times dur-  
ing transition that I had some beau-  
tiful, colorful hallucinations.  
Everyone there helped me through it  
by breathing with me and lots of  
touching. When the pushing contrac-  
tions started, they caught me off  
guard and I lost control. Karen and  
Carol grabbed me and started breath-  
ing with me until I got back to-  
gether, but I was freaked out for a  
minute or so. Carol checked and felt  
that I was completely dilated, and  
said it was OK to push with the con-  
tractions.

I was pretty tired by then and was  
not pushing hard enough, so I had to  
squat for a long time to move the  
baby down the birth canal. Again, I  
got lots of support from my friends,  
mostly verbal. Around 4 p.m., Carol  
told me the baby had to be born soon  
or we'd have to go to the hospital.  
I have a short pubic bone, and the  
baby's head was stuck. So, I gave it  
everything, and Amory emerged at  
4:16 p.m. The lights were dim,  
voices were soft, and the love over-  
flowed. Amory was immediately placed  
on my stomach, where she cried in  
short, tight gasps for a while. We  
rubbed her and talked to her until  
the placenta was ready to be deli-  
vered. Terry took her then and held  
her in a bath of body-temperature  
water. Amory stopped crying, looked  
around, opened her hands: and com-  
pletely relaxed in the bath. After  
she was dried off, I took a shower,  
and Amory got to know her new  
friends. The moment she was handed  
back to me, she started nursing and  
soon fell asleep. I felt so full of
