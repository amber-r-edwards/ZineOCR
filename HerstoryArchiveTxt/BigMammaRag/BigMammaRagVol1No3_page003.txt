P.2. Since we last came to you, we
on the staff of BMR have under-
gone several changes. Some of
our members have gone, and new
women have joined us. The major-
ity of us were undergoing some
sort of personal upheaval or
other, and for a while the paper
seemed to have a low priority
for most of us. Couple that
with the organizational problems
of any new project-oriented
group, and you have it; we were
getting bogged down.

We seemed to rally, however,
around the issue of our group
process. This carries a lot of
significance for us, because we
are determined to carry sister-
hood into the interactions of
our work group. The usual hier-
archy we confront in our jobs
and society as a whole disgusts
us — no person's potential is
highly utilized when orders are
handed down from the top. We
each see a lot of ourselves in
the paper, so there is an abun-
dance of creativity to tap. We
have struggled to find ways to
bring out each woman's unique
contribution.

The first major structural
decision we made was to split in-
to task groups: Ads & Distribu-
tion, Journalism, Photos & Graph-
ics, Layout and Communications.
In these smaller groups, we have
started seeking procedures which

will facilitate our interaction.
Some methods we have adopted
are choosing a woman by lot at
the beginning of one meeting to
chair the next so that she can
prepare an agenda and assure
continuity and follow-through of
our efforts, and choosing a
Process Observer, also by lot at
the beginning of each meeting,
to facilitate our evaluation of
our interaction. Interwoven
into these efforts is our own
commitment to each other, to
hear and to speak and to respond
to one another's feelings.

At present, it would be safe
to say that none of us is totally
satisfied with BIG MAMA RAG. We
continue to be excited about the
possibilities for Denver's first
women's journal, however, and we
have batted around numerous pro-
posals for upgrading BMR.

We are investigating means of
improving our appearance so that

we will have a more appealing for-

mat. We want to go to smaller
print throughout so that we can

widen the scope of our information

and carry more news — national,
local, international — and more
investigative journalism. This
would involve expanding our
journalism group, specifically
with part-time experienced women
writers, and would also include
publishing more often.

We have expanded sufficiently
to require office space and the
supplies that go with it, but to
date we do not have the money to
obtain such a luxury. This is

another area we are investigating.

We have discussed many times
the question of who we want BMR
to reach. Although we intended
the paper as a forum for any
woman to speak, we must concede
that through our choice of arti-
cles, we make the paper more than
a forum. We know that a woman
who has decided conclusively

where we’re at

against the liberation movement
will never open BMR, and we are

not missionaries trying to

change her.

But we do want to speak to
women who are beginning to feel
anger about the roles assigned
to them, to women who are be-
ginning to reach out for a new
grasp on themselves and for a
new communication with other
women. There are a lot of these
women whom BIG MAMA is not
reaching, and we are open for
suggestions as to solving this
dilemma. One thing that would
help is to know who we are
reaching, so please let us know
who you are.

About the only editorial
policy we have begun using so
far is that, while constructive
criticism of one another and
the women's movement is welcome,
anything that is downright des-
tructive or damaging to sister-
hood will not be printed. Fur-
ther, we are trying to come up
with some guidelines to use to
upgrade the quality of our
writing in general.

We are a strong group of
women, and we have begun an ex-
citing project, a chance to ex-
press ourselves and provide
Denver women with an invaluable
communications network. But we
have limited time and limited
resources (all of us work full-
or part-time at other jobs to
support ourselves and families).

We want to hear from you, and
we feel an absence of response.
We want your suggestions and
reactions on format, content,
style, whatever — and to a
large degree, the evolving
quality of BIG MAMA RAG depends
on it.

the Connection

The Connection, an infor-

mation, referral, and
counseling center located at
the corner of 18th and Clarkson,
has been in operation for two
and one-half years. A staff
of two women and two men is
available from 9-9 Monday
through Friday.

Four of our services may
be of special interest to
women. First, among our job
listings are some openings
especially created for women.
If you have a skill and are
seeking employment call us at
892-1812. Second, we know of a
number of excellent feminist
counselors, some of whom will
take referrals from us on a
sliding-scale basis. Third,
we specialize in child
advocacy. This involves
working with juvenile offenders
and assisting them with legal
hassles and group home place-
ments. Lastly, problem
pregnancy counseling which
consists first, of helping
women decide among the available
options. If she chooses to have
a therapeutic abortion, we
refer her to trusted physicians
either in Denver or out-of-state.
One of our female staff
members accompanies her to a
Denver hospital if she has no
one else to be with. We have
never been unable to arrange
a legal abortion for a woman
with financial problems.
