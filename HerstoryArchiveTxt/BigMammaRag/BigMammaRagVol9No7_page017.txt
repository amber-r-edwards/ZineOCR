The Rhode Island Feminist
Theater (RIFT), a collective
of 8 white women, performed

review

in Boulder on April 30. Their
performance of "Paper Weight"
about women in office work,
was excellent. As is each of
their plays, "Paper Weight"
was written collectively.

RIFT was first formed in
January of 1973 by 6 women
and 6 men, out of a desire to
examine sexual politics and
interactions from a feminist
perspective. None of the ori-
ginal members are still with
RIFT, and the collective
evolved into all women, which
eventually became a conscious
decision. Some men do support
work - ushering, box office,
etc.

For most of their existence,
RIFT members have all held
outside jobs as well as work-
ing with the theater. Since
last August, though, they
have all been supported
through their work in RIFT,
mainly through touring, but
also from donations and
grants (one which sponsors
them to do free performances
throughout Rhode Island). It
is a full-time job - besides
writing, rehearsing and per-

Page 22 - Big Mama Rag, July, 1981

forming, they do all the
bookkeeping, grant writing,
booking, set designs, etc.,
themselves.

The performance in Boulder,
“Paper Weight," is one of
three plays in RIFT's reper-
toire. "Internal Injury" is
about battered women; "One
is Silver" concerns women's
friendships with each other.

"Paper Weight" is an ex-
cellent portrayal of what
goes on in almost any office
in any large corporation.

The action takes place in the
records department of Quality
Life Insurance Corp.

Kim (Julie Pember) comes on
stage first - erstwhile hip-
pie, former factory worker
now file clerk (the only
difference, "It's cleaner,"
she says in that N.Y. accent).
But it's a job, and she tol-
erates it by getting high in
the parking lot on her breaks.

Your good, clean all-Ameri-
can girl, Joyce Morton (Mar-
cia Desy), appears next. She
takes her job very seriously;
lives at home and works out
physically in all her spare
time because she enjoys it!
Her fantasy is to win a gold
medal in the Olympics.

Cindi (Robin Leidner) is a
"typical" secretary - latest
fashions, spike heels, the
works. Self-deprecating,
always on a diet, though she

is thin. Her life seems taken
up with clothes and make-up -
her appearance.

Melissa Sue (Deborah Ber-
toldi) is the loud mouth.
Very individualistic - always
expressing her opinion, no
matter how unpopular; yet
traditionally ethical - do
the best job you can, be the
best mother you know how to
be.

The office supervisor is
Mary O'Malley (Sherilyn
Brown), middle-aged spinster
with polyester pant suits,
totally loyal to Quality Life.
She lives at home with her
mother and Tommy the cat.

The visible villain (though
you realize that the other,
real villains are behind the
scenes) in "Paper Weight" is
Adele (Ms.) Showalter, woman
executive. In order to esta-
blish credibility with the
company and her fellow execu-
tives (male), she feels she
must do everything exactly by
the book - no compromising,
no bending the rules.

The action centers at first
on the office routine - the
boring monotony of it only
enlivened by the talk among
the women. There is a genuine
caring for each other, espe-
cially among the ones who
have been there the longest -
Mary, Melissa Sue and Cindi.
There is a lot of banter,

some gossip, some confronta-
tions. Melissa Sue is the one
most aware that the corpora-
tion is only using them as
cogs in the machine, useful
as long as they perform their
specific function; and very
expendable. This becomes clear
to all of them when Melissa
Sue finds she needs to leave
early each day to be with her
son in speech therapy. Mary,
the supervisor, agrees to
this, as Melissa Sue is so
valuable to her in the office,
and also a friend - she says
she can easily arrange it
with a friend in personnel.
Unfortunately, the new re-
cords department head, Ms.
Showalter, insists on going
through channels. "Channels"
turns out to be the policy
committee, made up of all the
department heads, which says
“If we let you have the time
off, everyone would be ask-
ing for it." I have certainly
had that line quoted to me!

Faced with the choice of
either keeping her job or
being with her son, Melissa
Sue quits, since her son is
more important. Cindi, Kim
and Joyce make up a petition
to get regular employees on
the policy committee, which
Mary refuses to sign for fear
of losing her job.
