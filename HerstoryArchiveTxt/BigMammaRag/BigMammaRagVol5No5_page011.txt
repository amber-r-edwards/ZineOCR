‘And We Rose And Won With Women’s Might’

Vicki Piotter

"With fingers weary and worn  
With eyelids heavy and red  
A woman sat in unwomanly clothes  
Plying her needle and thread.  
Stitch, stitch, stitch.  
In poverty, hunger and dirt  
And still with a voice of dolorous  
pitch  
She sings the song of the shirt."  
-Song of the Shirt

Women in the clothing and textile  
industry make up 12% of all women who  
work outside the home. The majority  
of the women are concentrated in the  
lower-level areas of the industry,  
such as sewers and stitchers, weavers  
and spinners.

Garment and clothing workers are one  
of the few areas of the female work-  
force that is organized. In fact, the  
two unions with the largest number of  
women members are the International  
Ladies Garment Workers Union, with  
85% women, and the Amalgamated Cloth-  
ing and Textile Workers, which has  
90% women in the clothing industry,  
and approximately 50% women in the  
textile industry.

The history of women as clothing  
workers in the US dates back to colo-  
nial days during the 1600s. Half the  
women who emigrated to the colonies  
were indentured servants. Most of  
these women were poor and were forced  
to sell their services for a period  
of 3 to 6 years to the "master" who  
paid for their ship's passage to the  
"land of opportunity."

Under the indentured system, young  
girls were owned until they were six-  
teen or eighteen. During that time,  
the apprenticeship system for girls  
emphasized instruction in "spinning,  
weaving, sewing and knitting." They  
were taught the trades of dressmaking  
and laundering.

In 1656, the first compulsory labor  
law affecting women was passed by the  
Massachusetts State Court:

"Fearing that it will not be so  
easy to import clothes as it was  
in past years, thereby necessitating  
more home manufacture," it stated,  
"...all hands not necessarily employed  
on other occasions as women and girls  
shall spin according to their skill and  
ability, and the selectmen in  
every town, do consider the con-  
dition and capacity of every  
family, and accordingly do assess  
them at one or more spinners."

Women continued with the domestic  
manufacturing of clothes until the  
end of the Revolutionary War, at  
which time the domestic system was  
doomed. Textile making was the first  
craft to move from the home to newly  
built factories.

The first factory of this kind was  
established by Samuel Slater in 1790  
in Rhode Island. Slater's first tex-  
tile mills employed only children, all  
under the age of 12; other newly  
founded mills followed this pattern.  
However, by the 1830s, the develop-  
ing textile mills looked increasingly  
to "young ladies" as the most prefer-  
red type of millworker.

One of the first mills to make an  
all-out effort to recruit women and  
young girls from farm life was the  
Lowell factory in Massachusetts. In  
the early 1800s women's labor was in  
surplus, because the labor in the  
home, or as domestics and teachers,  
could not be fully utilized. However,  
many families’ morals would not allow  
their daughters to go to work in a  
distant town unless certain standards  
were established.

Lowell responded to these social  
mores by building a "model" mill com-  
munity. The women and girls who enter-  
ed the textile mills, in large num-  
bers, were, at first, closely super-  
vised. They were told when to get up  
and when to go to bed, what to do on  
the job, when to eat, what to do for  
recreation, how to behave, and where  
to go to church.

In the beginning, the millworkers  
found the new existence an exciting  
relief from the farm life they left  
behind. At first, the salary seemed  
sufficient-- $2.00 a week after room  
and board for a 70 hour work week,  
but then a change took place. Lowell  
increased the number of looms the  
women were required to tend; from  
one, the number jumped to three or  
four. This was accompanied by the  
“premium” system whereby bonuses were  
given to overseers who succeeded in  
getting more work out of the women  
than before. The premium system  
greatly deteriorated employee/super-  
visor relationships.

During speedup, wages continued to  
average $2.00 per week, but in 1836,  
when the mill owners decided to in-  
crease the deductions for boarding  
house expenses, 1500 Lowell women and  
girls walked out of the factory. They  
paraded through the streets singing:

"Oh, isn't it a pity that  

Such a pretty girl as I  
Should be sent to the factory  
To pine away and die?  

Oh, I cannot be a slave;  

I will not be a slave.  

For I'm so fond of liberty  
That I cannot be a slave."

As a result of this walkout, the  
Lowell Female Reform Association was  
formed, but it was unable to stop the  
steady deterioration of conditions in  
the mill towns. The names of women  
and girls who protested poor working  
conditions were sent around to other  
companies and a blacklist developed.  
The management of various mill compan-  
ies were so closely connected that  
any worker could be easily prevented  
from getting another job in the re-  
gion.

During the 1840s, the expanding  
mill systems required more workers  
than the immediate area could provide.  
Active recruiting in Europe and the  
potato famine in Ireland in the 40s  
brought waves of Irish workers to  
the textile plants. Wages took a drop  
because there was now an excess labor  
pool and underpaid workers could be  
“kept in line” by the threat of unem-  
ployment. Many of the New England  
women, instead of uniting with their  
Irish co-workers, felt that, "It is  
incalculably better that the native  
girls fill the mills. If the Irish  
girls remain, wages may come down."

THE  
MANAGEMENT  

-A Pictorial History of American Labor

During the period of early attempts  
at labor organizing (1820-1860) most  
women workers were employed in the  
garment making trades. An early indi-  
cation of the desire of women to or-  
ganize took place in New York in 1831  
when 100 members of the New York Asso-  
ciation of Tailoresses went on strike  
for higher wages. They resolved that  
"the prices of Tailoresses ought to  
be advanced at least ‘one-third, and  
in some cases doubled." These militant  
women also said that whether they won  
the fight or not, “We will not relax  
in our efforts to support and increase  
this Society...this Society will pre-  
vent in the future the like depres-  
sion we now labor under."

Conditions in garment sweatshops  
and cotton mills were dirty, dark and  
damp. Workers were usually at their  
machines at 6 am and stayed there,  
except for one brief lunch break, un-  
til 8:00 at night, or later.

One garment worker, Pauline Newman,  
described how  

"during the winter months we were  
extremely uncomfortable-- if not  
actually freezing. The only heat-  
ing facility in these places was  
a stove, put in the middle of  
the floor. The warmth was insuf-  
ficient for all-- but especially  

for those of us who were placed  
near the windows. I recall sever-  
al places in which when a window  
was broken, a cardboard would be  
replaced for the glass. Thus ad-  
ding to the cold and depriving  
us of what a bit of daylight  
that window afforded. How we suf-  
fered from the cold. In the sum-  
mer we suffered from the heat,  
for these places were suffocat-  
ing. In these disease breeding  
holes, we toiled from seventy to  
eighty hours a week. Saturday  

and Sunday included...a sign  
would go up on Saturday after-  
noon: ‘If you don't come in on  
Sunday, you need not come in on  
Monday.'"

There were many abortive strikes  
throughout the New England states  
from the 1840s on, and an increasing  
degree of militancy on the part of the  
young women. Middle class notions of  
"unladylike" behavior were being ig-  
nored as factory doors were broken  
down with axes and scabs were entreat-  
ed to join the women or forced to  
leave the factory. By the late 1840s  
women were demanding the ten hour  

day.

Immediately following the Civil War,  
organized labor was catching on. How-  
ever, most of the newly formed unions  
were excluding women and Blacks. The  
Knights of Labor was one exception  
which had 12,000 women members in  
twenty different industries, including  
housewives. Some garment and textile  
workers belonged to the Knights of  
Labor, but it wasn't until the early  
1900s that women in the clothing  
industry began to speed up organizing  
activities.

The clothing industry at the turn of  
the century was concentrated in the  
cities where there was a large supply  
of cheap labor. The great number of  
recent immigrants from Europe-- pri-  
marily from Italy, Russia, Bohemia,  
Poland and Lithuania-- many of them  
women and girls with some skill at  
sewing, afforded the employers with a  
ready source of willing labor.

Desperately in need of jobs, it was  
not unusual for women and girls to  
earn $2.50 a week, for they were in  
no position to bargain. It was also  
not unusual for them to take unfin-  
ished work to their homes to be complet-  
ed, often with the help of young  
children. Apart from their low wages  
and constant threat and frequent actu-  
ality of being thrown out of work  
suddenly when work was shifted to a  
plant where it could be done more  
cheaply, the clothing workers faced  
thousands of injustices in the plants.

This was the atmosphere in the  
Chicago industry in 1910. The growing  
restlessness of the workers erupted  
when a group of girls walked out in  
protest of still another wage cut in  
a pants shop of the giant Hart Schaf-  

fner and Marx firm. Within three weeks  
most of the 8,000 workers in the co-  
mpany's plants had joined them. Soon,  
almost all of Chicago's 35,000 cloth-  
ing workers were on strike.

The strike lasted four months and  
was marked by violence, arrests, and  
the death of two workers. Despite  
their determination, the workers re-  
turned to work with no improvements,  
except those employed by Hart Schaf-  
fner and Marx, who had signed a con-  
tract.

According to one source, "the gener-  
al strike failed because the workers

did not have the support of the  
leadership of their union, the United  
Garment Workers. The UGW, which had  
confined itself to the cutters and  
tailors-to-the-trade (men) had made  
no serious attempt to organize the  
large masses of the clothing workers  
(women). They had, in fact, been  
embarrassed by this great upsurge and  
had tried to terminate the strike on  
any terms."

In New York, at the turn of the cen-  
tury, conditions of the industry were  
similar to those in Chicago, but the  
outcome of worker protests were more  
encouraging.

In New York, a large percentage of  
the waistmakers and needle trade work-  
ers were members of the International  
Ladies Garment Workers Union, which  
was formed in 1900. The women who  
assumed leadership positions advocated  
militancy, which finally paid off in  
the 1909 “Uprising of the Twenty Thou-  
sand."

The shirtwaistmakers of two shops,  
one of them the Triangle Shirtwaist  
Company, had been on strike for a  
month. At a mass meeting of garment  
workers one teenager, who had suffered  
broken ribs from an attack on a picket  
line, addressed the meeting. She said,  
"I am a working girl, and one of those  
who are on strike against intolerable  
working conditions. I am tired of lis-  
tening to speakers who talk in general  
terms. What we are here for is to de-  
cide whether or not we shall strike. I  
offer a resolution that a general  
strike be declared. Now."  

The next day over 20,000 workers  
walked out of their sweatshops and  
fought a bitter thirteen week strike.  
They endured evictions, attacks, hun-  
ger and cold. In the end, they brought  
the International Ladies Garment Work-  
ers into more than 300 shops, with  
more pay and a shorter work week. The  
song the workers sang during the  

strike, “Hail the Waistmakers", be-
