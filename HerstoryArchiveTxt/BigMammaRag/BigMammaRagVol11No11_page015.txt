What parts of people's pain

be done to make that indiv-

institution.

In response to "recent
regulations in Massachusetts
and legislation in CA sought
to limit or control the use
of electroconvulsive “ther-
apy”—ECT.", a Task Force
of the Colorado Psychiatric
Society was appointed to
"review scientific evidence
concerning both the value
and potential dangers of
the "treatment". The Task
Force describes the "tech-
nique" of ECT—"Inducing

0.1-0.5 seconds between two
scalp electrodes...This cur-
rent must be sufficient to
stimulate a grand mal sei-
zure: the patient instantly
loses consciousness, devel-
ops tonic stiffening (the
forceful tonic stiffening of
muscles sometimes fractures
bones), and then jerks with
bilateral clonic movements
of face and extremities. (Fo-
llowing the clonic phase of
the seizure, artificial ven-
tilation is provided as
needed until normal respir-
ation resumes.) Without
seizures the treatment is
ineffective." The most fri-
ghtening thing about the
description of ECT from the
Task Force is its sterility—
I mean that it says nothing
about how the "patient" ex-
periences it. The medical
model of "mental illness"
gives us a disease such as
psychosis, neurosis, a
psychopath/a sociopath
(these people are the people
in jails and institutions
for the "criminally insane")
and then we have a cure. I
think of the joke "the cure
was a success but the patient
died." Some joke. And yet we
are so "mystified"/unin-
formed about the workings

"professional" in these
fields are given license

to experiment with people's
bodies and minds.

A man, 55 years of age,
came to our picket here in
Denver, he had been tor-
tured with shock when he
was seventeen. Said it
ruined his life, destroyed
parts of his mind, left
his nerves and muscles dam-
aged, headaches and head-
aches. He talked—said we
had to tell people that we
weren't bad or dangerous
or violent, that we didn't
deserve the treatment we
get. That shock treatment
is torture.

In the political/feminist
community in Denver organi-
zing the anti-shock demon-
stration did get some
people aware of psychiatric
practices that they would
like to think aren't done
anymore. Specifically we
sometimes would get support
for our position against
shock but not for any of
our politics against psy-
chiatry as social control,
the danger in friendly al-
ternative therapies. I
write to say that these
issues cannot be separated.
It is the theories and
practices of Psychiatry/
Psychology that allows for
shock and psychosurgery
and electrical stimulation
of the brain to control
behavior, and aversive

"therapy" (shock applied to

genitals, etc.) and drug-
ging and people restrained
and being treated like ani-
mals. It is what psychiatry
would have us think—who is
dangerous. I can think of
lots of people I think are
dangerous and powerful and
not just "potentially dan-
gerous to self and others"
but definitely dangerous to
lots and lots of people and
they will never be locked up.
I fight in myself the de-
sire to give up—or live.
And when life is the choice
there is no choice but for
me to be out to destroy
psychiatry and all that it
means for our understand-
ing of ourselves and our
relationships.
the economic and social
structures behind all our
relationships. Psychiatry
lies in its family by fami-
ly/one by one analysis and
solution. Their understand-
ing leaves out a lot of in-
formation i.e. about

The Twelfth Annual International Conference For Human Rights
and Against Psychiatric Oppression will be held in Denver,
Co., in the late spring, or early summer. If anyone has any
fundraising or organizing ideas—let us know. A conference
organizing committee will begin to meet soon. Our first
priority is to find a place to have it—if anyone has any
suggestions for a place in the Denver area please get in
touch. We are excited to bring together as many current and
ex-inmates as possible for the conference committee—and

to just be in support of each other. Write: Attn. Lori
