I am interested in seeking some form of post-conviction relief, but I am not educated enough in legal matters to handle it myself and cannot afford an attorney. Another inmate here at ORW has prepared this letter for me, in the hope that perhaps your readers can give me some support in this matter.

The man who murdered my husband is currently a fugitive from justice after posting an appeal bond, while I sit in prison serving a 22 year to life sentence for a murder I did not commit, nor even witness, and a robbery in which I was an unwilling participant. I was coerced into entering a plea of guilty. Is this justice?

I will welcome any and all assistance you or your readers are willing to give and would appreciate hearing from you. A self-addressed, pre-embossed envelope would be helpful for replies. I have been through so very much and cannot bear to think of spending the next 12 years of my life in this prison. Won't you help me?

Sincerely,
