In May 1980, a 24-year-old
Puerto Rican woman facing a
possible death sentence in a
US court turned her back on

struggle

the presiding judge, faced
her courtroom supporters and
refused to participate in her
own trial. She said, I,
Maria Haydee Torres, am a
Puerto Rican Prisoner of War.

america held hostage

I am a product of the contin-
uous struggle waged by my
people. I am the conscience
of my people in arms. And as
a captured Prisoner of War,
neither this court nor this
country has any right to
treat me like a criminal and
subject me to those things
for which they have brought
me here. They say they want a
sample of my hair, a sample
of my writing, and to subject
me to a line up. Neither my
hair nor my soul shall they
have. I am free, and neither
these bars nor this miserable
and shameful country can keep
me imprisoned.

Haydee is one of five women
and six men who are accused

The elections have come & gone, mudslinging & evasion of
issues were beautifully handled. More Democrats

in the House & Repubs held fast

in the Senate. Ronknee

stumped around the country in his cowboy boots shit-kicking
all the way. If we stay the course, hang in there with over
10% unemployment & rising, gov't spending on war toys
reaching astronomical red figures, agency budget slashing
& put prayer back in schools...we may all go to heaven poor

but in a blazer of gory.

The anti-nuke freeze amendment won in many states but if
the boys really followed through, where would they put them
& how would they get rid of them, they still haven't figured
out what to do with the MX missile system..

Georgie Walrus in Alabama got
his old job back as govern-
or by showing how much he cared

for Black folks. But the

other guy was even worse they said.
Our glorious leaders have dipped into the Disability Ins-
urance Trust Fund to the tune of $581 million to give to
the Social Security Old Age & Survivors Insurance Trust
Fund so that people could get more benefits with the ex-
pectation that more will have to be borrowed through the
end of June: More people throughout the land of the freeze

are homeless. Shelters for the night are opening all over
the country & taking in the homeless -- at the rate of 20-

30 per shelter. If only us poor

would go away maybe the

budget could get balanced & them that's rich could relax

& get on with their polo games.

Nixon & his thugs got together for a Watergate reunion
in DC, laughing & joking all the time. Nixon is being made
into a respectable senior statesman by being interviewed
about foreign policy through the big eye. The

joke is on us, he got away with

it all.

Watts had some parties too & didn't invite

us, but we paid over $6,000 for

clamour was so great that the Re-

pubs were forced to pick up the
tab. My how those folks live.
The gov't is claiming in a

Utah lawsuit that the radiation
level in above-ground nuke testing

in the '50-60's was too low to have
caused cancer in 24 residents, that

goes along with their policy of
disclaiming that Agent Orange didn't do
nothing to US soldiers who were exposed to

it, no one seems concerned

about what the reaction is on the Viet Nam people.

of membership in the Fuerzas
Armadas de Liberación Nacional (FALN), an armed clandestine
organization that has carried out more than 100
armed attacks within the US
in support of Puerto Rican
independence. These 11 Puerto
Rican patriots were convicted in 1981 on numerous
counts, including seditious
conspiracy to overthrow the
US government by force of
arms. They have received
sentences ranging from 55
years to life. All, like Hay-
dee, declared themselves
Prisoners of War and refused
to participate in their
trials.

These five women, Haydee
Torres, Dylcia Pagan, Carmen
Valentín, Alicia Rodríguez
and Lucy Rodríguez, are moth-
ers, poets, and political
activists involved in their
communities; one is a teacher,
one a TV producer. Where did
they find the courage and
determination to struggle to
speak in a courtroom where
they were bound and gagged
and where the judge said open-
ly that they should all be
shot? How did they come to
place bombs in corporate head-
quarters and to declare war
on the world's largest imper-
ialist power?

In the words of Alicia
Rodríguez: Our actions were
not dictated by whims, but
by a clear understanding of
the colonial situation in
Puerto Rico. Therefore, the
conditions of my people (both
in the US and in Puerto Rico)
have forced us to move against
subsistence wages, extremely
high inflation, mass unem-
ployment (which forced the
migration of almost half of
the population of Puerto
Rico), genocide (40 percent
of Puerto Rican women of
childbearing age have been
sterilized), and the perpet-
ual effort of US colonialism
to destroy our language and
culture through forced assim-
ilation and annexation.

The US enforces colonialism
in Puerto Rico through mili-

tary intervention, political

repression, assassination,
and imprisonment because
Puerto Rico is strategically
important to US corporate and
military interests. Throughout
the long history of Puerto
Rican resistance, it has be-
come clear that independence
will never be won through
elections or negotiations with
the US government. The only
way to Puerto Rican independ-
ence is the same way which has
succeeded from Viet Nam to
Zimbabwe--a people's war for
national liberation.

Four armed clandestine or-
ganizations on the island and
FALN inside the US are demon-
strating that the US is not
invincible. They are develop-
ing the capacity to fight,
building the people's confi-
dence, and through their ex-
ample are raising the level
of militance of the entire
nation. They are striking
blows against the colonizer
and are mobilizing the Puerto
Rican people to participate
in a people's war for indepen-
dence and socialism. Last
year, when the power company

-ESP/BR

turned off the electricity in
Villa sin Miedo (a community
of squatters who were carry-
ing out a militant struggle
against the colonial govern-
ment), one of the armed organ-
izations of the island bombed
the electrical installations
in the Condado tourist dis-
trict of San Juan saying that
if the poor cannot have elect-
ricity, neither can the rich.
The power company was then
forced to turn on the elec-
tricity in Villa sin Miedo.
Last May during Ocean Venture
82, a massive air-sea naval
exercise, the Macheteros killed
one sailor and wounded
three others declaring that no
US military occupies the
island. Their capacity to
make good on their vows was
made clear in January 1981
when they destroyed $45 million
worth of jets at the
heavily guarded Muñiz Air
Base near San Juan.

A major strength of the
Puerto Rican struggle is the
existence of nearly 4 million
Puerto Ricans in the US. This
means that the war for Puerto

“national’’

Been An Integral Part Of The Struggle”

Rican independence is, and
will increasingly be, carried
out inside the US as well as
on the island. Since 1974,
the FALN has carried out over
100 bombings of US military
and corporate targets in US
cities. Their most recent
attacks were the March 1st
bombing of Banker's Trust in
Manhattan in response to the
massacre of Palestinians in
Beirut only two days before.
This ability of the Puerto
Rican armed movement to
attack the empire in the
heart of its own cities will
be a decisive factor in the
winning of the war for inde-
pendence.

The five women Prisoners
of War are participants in
this developing people's war.
They see their struggles as
women as an integral part of
the struggle for independence
of their nation. They have a
vision of themselves that
totally contradicts the de-
pendent and powerless Puerto
Rican woman that imperialism
tries to perpetuate and ex-
ploit, and they are making
that vision a reality with
their lives. From behind
prison walls Haydee Torres
talks about her identity as
a revolutionary Puerto Rican
woman, I think that you don't
have to be a certain sex to
be committed... You have to be-
lieve that what you are doing
is going to make a difference.
I actually believe that. In
Puerto Rico, women have al-
ways been an integral part of
the struggles because they
always believed that they
could make a difference as
human beings. I think that in
fighting together, in standing
side by side with our compan-
eros, I think that I have
done a lot more for the equal-
ity of women. If we can say
that in fighting together we
are fighting to rid society of
inequalities--that's one of
those inequalities that we are
fighting to rid ourselves of.
And when we fight we learn
something about ourselves; so
that when we build something
new, it's going to be built
differently. It's going to be
something good, it's going to
be just and it's going to be
honestly human.

Haydee and the other women
Prisoners of War are examples
to us of what is meant to be
a liberated woman. They, like
women from Nicaragua to Zim-

babwe,

are transforming
themselves through their
participation in the struggle
to defeat imperialism and
create just societies free
from colonialism, male supre-
macy and all forms of oppres-

sion. We as white women in
the US must have the same
goals. We must ask--what does
it mean for us to carry on
our struggle to gain our
liberation within a system
which is based on colonialism
and terror? What does it mean
for us to carry on our
struggle without totally
challenging the genocide of
imperialism? We can look at
South Africa and imagine what
it would mean for white South
African women to fight for
their liberation as women
without making their primary
demand the freedom of the
Blacks and the destruction
of the racist white settler
state. It really isn't any
different here where white
people enjoy the world's
highest standard of living,
reaping the benefits of
imperialism's control over
colonized Black, Chicano/
Mexicano, Puerto Rican and
Native peoples here in the
US and Third World peoples
around the world.

We need to put our struggle
as women into the larger
perspective of what the
majority of women in the

world are fighting for. Our
fight must be in solidarity

with the national liberation
struggles which are leading
in the destruction of im-
perialism. Our fight must be
to tear this whole system
down. It is in this way that
we can lay the basis for
building something new.

On International Women's Day

(March 8, 1983), demonstrations

in solidarity with all freedom
fighters and prisoners of war
will be held nationwide at
women's prisons. The demonst-
rations will focus on women
like the five Puerto Rican
Prisoners of War who are
fighting for the liberation of
their nation with arms. These
women demonstrate how we as
women can liberate ourselves
through our participation in
the struggle to defeat imper-
ialism and build societies
free from colonialism, male
supremacy, and all forms of
oppression. We urge women to
participate. For more infor-
mation contact The New Move-
ment in Solidarity with the

olution, 3543 18th St., #17,

Haydee Torres’ Health Endangered

Haydee Torres' health is
once again endangered. Haydee
is one of the 11 Puerto Rican
POWs held in US prisons, acc-
used of membership in the
Puerto Rican armed clandestine
independence organization, the
FALN. Due to prison neglect,
Haydee has been suffering from
an untreated bacterial infec-
tion of the uterus for more
than a year. This condition is
accompanied by sharp abdominal
pains that are particularly
acute during her menstrual
period.

Several months ago, the Nat-
ional Committee to Free Puerto
Rican Prisoners of War initi-
ated a successful telegram
campaign demanding that Haydee
be treated by a physician of
her choice. After much pres-
sure, the prison authorities
relented, but at the last mo-
ment refused to allow Haydee
to select her own doctor. In-
stead, they hand-picked an
area physician to examine her.
This doctor prescribed large
doses of a potent pain-killer
that temporarily relieves the
pain, but does nothing to el-
eviate her condition overall.

The longer-term effects of
this infection are very dang-
erous. The prison staff phys-
ician has already informed
Haydee that she will surely
develop uterine cancer if her
condition continues untreated.

The San Diego Metropolitan
Correctional Center, where
Haydee is currently imprisoned
is not adequately equipped to
house prisoners with serious
medical problems. There are no
yard facilities, and only pre-
packaged institutional foods
prepared through a microwave
process are served. This den-
ies Haydee the fresh air,
daily exercise and nutrition-
ally balanced diet necessary
for her complete recovery.

Please write letters of con-
cern to: Warden, Metropolitan
Correctional Center, 808 Union
St., San Diego, CA. 92101, de-
manding that Puerto Rican
Prisoner of War Haydee Torres
be immediately transferred to
a state or federal institution
where she may receive proper
medical care.
