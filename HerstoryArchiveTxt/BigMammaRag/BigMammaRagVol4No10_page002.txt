Saxe Trial Ends With A Hung Jury

Deborah Taylor, V. Piotter, Kate Sharp and Eileen Bresnahan

The murder/armed robbery trial of  
Susan Saxe ended in Boston, October  
15th with the jury of six women and  
six men unable to reach a verdict.  
After five days of jury deadlock,  
Judge Walter McLaughlin declared a  
mistrial on all the charges. He also  
told the jury not to discuss the case  
outside the courtroom, saying such  
discussions would make it difficult  
to find a "fair and impartial" jury  
for a possible second trial.

Herstory

On September 23, 1970 the Brighton  
Branch of the State Street Bank was  
robbed. A policeman, Patrolman Walter  
Schroeder, was killed. Five suspects  
were named: Susan Saxe; Kathy Power,  
who is still a fugitive; Stanly Bond,  
who was killed at the Walpole State  
Prison in 1972 before going to trial;  
Robert Valeri, who turned state's  
witness in exchange for a plea of man-  
slaughter; and William Gilday, who is  
of _.

years on the FBI's ten most wanted  
list for her overall radical acti-  
vity. She was then charged with a  
series of federal offenses--conspir-  
acy to rob a Philadelphia bank,  
theft of classified documents from  
an armory in Newburyport, Mass.,  
possession of a molotov cocktail,  
and avoiding a federal fugitive  
warrant. On June 9, 1975, Susan pled  
guilty to these charges. Sentencing  
on them is to be held up until her

Saxe was tried for one count of  
first degree murder and two counts of  
armed robbery for allegedly taking part  
in a Boston bank robbery six years ago  
in which a policeman was killed. She  
was tried under Massachusetts's felony  
murder law which states that if a per-  
son is killed in the course of a rob-  
bery, all alleged participants are  
charged with first degree murder,  
whether or not they actually did the  
killing.

Susan Saxe was arrested in Philade-  
lphia on March 27, 1975. The day before  
her arrest, the FBI had passed her  
photo out to the Philadelphia police  
department, telling them she could  
probably be found in the women's com-  
munity or gay community. She was spot-  
ted by a patrolman walking down the  
street with Byrna Aronson, her lover.

Suit Stems From 1974 Arrest At UFW Picket Line

Terra and Tea

A civil suit by three United Farm  
Worker supporters was successfully  
brought to trial the week of October  
5th. Arlene Irlando, Michelle  
Hobart, and Margie Stewart filed the  
suit against employees of Jefferson  
County as a result of their treatment  
by law officers after their arrest  
at a UFW picket, November, 1974.

At the protest against the sale of  
Gallo wine at Applejack Liquor Store,  
17 men and 8 women were arrested. The  
men were beaten and released. However,  
three of the women, who had demanded  
their rights, were thrown in solitary  
cells and held down by male guards  
while a matron searched them.

Indications are that the arrests  
were planned well in advance and that  
racist attitudes prevailed. At the  
time of the ongoing protest at Ap-  
plejack Liquors, an injunction, filed  
by the owner of the liquor store,  
prevented picketers from gathering  
within a certain distance from the  
store. Picketers were well outside  
this limit on the day of the arrests.

In testimony during the trial, it  
was mentioned that a meeting had occurred  
between the Jeffco sheriff's  
department, the Wheatridge local  
force, and the Denver police about  
the picketers.

When the law enforcement agencies  
went into action, they started by  
grabbing all Chicanos in the area,  
including one woman who was covering  
the picket for a television station.  
"If what the police did was not  
blindly racist," insists Michelle,  
"then it was clearly provocative."

Racism of the law officers was  
much more open in the jail. When  
Arlene Irlando was brought in, the  
guards who were standing around called  
her “Mexicali Rose" and cries of  
"put the Mexican in solitary" were  
heard.

Racism was also apparent in the  
attitude of the defense attorney.  
At one point during the trial, he was  
examining Arlene. She asked him to  
repeat a question and he replied  
by saying something to the effect  
that she couldn't speak English,  
implying that by not understanding  
English, she was of lesser intelli-  
gence and worth.

It was by such arrogance that the  
lawyer for the defense lost the case,  
commented Arlene. According to her  
account, his subtle sexism reinforced  
everything that the plaintiffs had  
said. Their entire testimony centered  
around the fact that the men were  
treated differently than the women.  
The motivating force for the treat-  
ment that the women received was that  
to control a woman, one humiliates  
her. The defense attorney tried to  
do just that in the courtroom.

Testimony for the trial, which was  
before a jury in Judge Finesilver's  
courtroom of the U.S. Court in  
Denver, extended through the week.  
The jury deliberated for two and a  
half hours, asking at one point for  
clarification as to the difference  
between punitive and assessed damages.

The decision was against the two ma-  
trons and the male officer involved.  
Damages were awarded which amount  
to slightly over $24,000.

According to Michelle, the defense  
attorney had tried to convince the  
jury that the suspension of prison-  
ers' rights while in jail was accept-  
able, and that anyone who demands  
their rights and fights for the  
rights of others is really asking  
for the loss of their own rights.  
The real victory was that the women  
fought their unjust treatment, for  
themselves and for others.

The attorney for the police is  
an interesting character. It has  
been said that if there is a politi-  
cally wrong side to a case he will  
be on it. This is in reference to  
his propensity to be hired by any  
and every police department in the  
area in cases of abuse by police of-  
ficers and insurance companies. His  
specialty is convincing a jury that  
“law and order" means that law en-  
forcement agents can act in any man-  
ner to "protect" ordinary citizens.  
His record is formidable.

state trials are over.

In exchange for her plea of guil-  
ty, the government guaranteed that  
she would not be given more than a  
ten-year sentence on the federal  
indictments. More important to  
Susan, she would never be called to  
testify against anyone she met while  
underground and would never be cal-  
led to testify against Kathy Power.  
The third part of the federal plea  
bargain, which Susan insisted upon,  

In this particular trial, however,  
he seemed unable to effectively apply  
the strategy he is known for.  
Michelle felt that he had been er-  
ratic in his strategy, trying some-  
times to show that they were tough  
UFW women who could take any punish-  
ment, and at others to show that  
they were sissies for bringing the  
action to court. A portion of his  
plotting appeared to be an attempt  
to show that the suit was being  
brought purely for the publicity for  
the UFW that it would create.

The suit was originally filed by  
Nancy Crow, a Guild attorney. Her  
complaint, however, was too broad  
in its field of defendants. There  
were several John Does in her filing,  
mainly because her main concern in  
the suit was the violation of civil  
rights and due process. The attor-  
ney who finally took over the suit,  
Ray Satter, streamlined the suit  
when he took over. He made the John  
Does more specific and changed the  
focus to false arrest.

When they went to court in Octo-  
ber, the defendants named in the  
suit were the two matrons, Root and  
Bringle, the male officer who held  
Margie when she was being searched,  
Boyce, and the Jeffco sheriff, Bray.  
All other defendants had been vol-  
untarily dropped by the plaintiffs  
because they were merely the officers  
who had been on duty that day and  
could not be positively identified.

Bray was dropped from the suit by  
the court. A legality in civil law  
made this possible. They had to  
show that the sheriff was actually  
giving orders, not only that he was  
in charge. This, they couldn't do.

Often during the trial, Michelle  
and Arlene were kicking each other  
under the table to keep themselves  
quiet. They were outraged by the  
lies of the officers. After the  
first few days of testimony, how-  
ever, the officers began contradict-  
ing each other and themselves, and  
it became easier to listen to them.  
In one particular instance, a de-  

was there would never be a Grand  
Jury investigation into the Phila-  
delphia women's community.

This final condition stemmed from  
previous Grand Juries in Lexington,  
KY, and New Haven, CT, convened under  
the guise of investigating the  
whereabouts of Susan and Kathy  
Power. The state used these Grand  
Juries to disrupt and intimidate  
the women's movement. Three women,  
Jill Raymond, Terri Turgeon, and  
Ellen Grusse, all served time for  
refusing to testify.

The Boston Trial

After pleading guilty in Philade-  
lphia, Susan was taken to Mass-  
achusetts to face state charges.  
After much delay, her trial for  
armed robbery and murder began  
September 15, 1976.

The first two weeks of the trial  
were spent on jury selection. The  
defense used the National Jury Pro-  
ject to help them choose a sympa-  
thetic jury. The NUP investigated  
each prospective juror thoroughly  
as to their friends, their jobs,  
and political orientation. This  
effort finalized in a jury averag-  
ing 24 years of age and containing  
more women than most juries.

The prosecution tried to have Susan  
convicted under the felony murder law  
where she would get a natural life  
sentence with no chance for parole.  
Early witnesses for the prosecution,  
Brighton Bank employees and customers,  
could not positively identify Saxe as  
being in the bank at the time of the  
robbery. One witness testified she  
recognized Susan on the basis that  
both Susan and the woman participating  
in the robbery had “thick lips," but  
could not identify her further. Saxe  
also did not appear in any photos  
taken by bank cameras during the  
course of the robbery.

UFW Women Win Strip/Search Suit

tective who was testifying stated  
that he had personally counted 99  
picketers on the day of the arrests.  
The other officers all said that  
there were 50 picketers.

One of the witnesses for the plain-  
tiffs who was most beneficial to  
their case was Sister Cecily, a mem-  
ber of the Sisters of Loretto. She  
is a strong UFW supporter and was  
also arrested at the time the other  
three were. Her testimony weighed  
heavily with the jury. In the  
above-mentioned example, she stated  
that there were 35 picketers. This  
trend continued throughout the  
trial. Sister Cecily's testimony  
continually contradicted that of the  
defense.

Both women felt relieved that it  
is over, for the present. Margie  
was unavailable for comment when we  
went to press. The main memory that  
they had was one of being unable to  
shout back when witnesses were ly-  
ing. The courtroom is a contrived  
scene, with each side given time in  
which to prepare testimony. Says  
Michelle, "Everything is so civil in  
court."

They were understandably  
concerned about the verdict, yet they don't  
feel that they were really victori-  
ous or that it was a big victory.  
Says Arlene, "It was no victory that  
most of the blame was put on the  
matrons. As far as the mechanics  
of who's in charge, they were as  
victimized as any of us. The blame  
should have been shared by the  
higher-ups." Bray's dismissal dis-  
appointed them all.

Right now the three women are busy  
getting their lives together. The  
defense attorney has 10 days from  
the date of the verdict to file an  
appeal. Should an appeal be filed,  
they will need more money to add to  
the funds they have raised in the  
past two years in order to re-fight  
the battle. All they really want is  
some rest and peace in which to  
continue their political activities.
