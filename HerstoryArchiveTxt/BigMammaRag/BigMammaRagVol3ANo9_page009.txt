LES GUERILLERES  
Monique Wittig  

Vicki Piotter  
and Clare Strawn  

“The women say that they  
have learned to rely on their own  
strength. They say that they are  
aware of the force of their unity.  
They say, let those who call for a  
new language first learn violence.  
They say, let those who want to  
change the world first seize all the  
rifles. They say that they are  
starting from zero. They say that a  
new world is beginning.”  

Les Guerilleres is visionary —  
woman becoming total in her  
experience not as individual  
woman, but all women as  
WOMAN.

Woman's body is integrated  
with her environment, her envi-  
ronment with her politics, her  
politics with her emotions, her  
body with her emotions. Where  
is the beginning of Les Guerill-  
eres? Where does it end? The  
entire book is written from a new  
base of definition. It is assumed,  
for instance, that time is not a  
function of linear order but of  
total experience. Our past is our  
future, our future the past.  
When did/will the revolution  
occur? A new language is  
needed to even talk about the  
book, a language that is a tool for  

revolution.  
“The women say, I refuse  
henceforth to speak this  

language, I refuse to mumble  
after them the words lack of  
penis lack of money lack of  
insignia lack of name. I refuse to  
pronounce the names of  
possession and non-possession.  
They say, “If I take over the  
world, let it be to dispossess  
myself of it immediately, let it be  
to forge new links between  
myself and the world.”  

Monique Wittig writes in  
French (translated beautifully to  
English). She uses the words of  
traditional language to create  
new strong images and  
definitions. Breasts, usually  
regarded as passive and all  
nurturing, are turned around to  
create...  

“Then the women, at a signal,  
uttering a terrible cry, suddenly  
rip off the upper part of their  
garments, uncovering — their  
naked gleaming breasts. The  
men, the enemy, begin to  
discuss what they unanimously  
regard as a gesture of  
submission.”  

“Some laugh out loud and  
manifest their aggressiveness  
by thrusting their bare breasts  
forward brutally.”  

Wittig uses isolated passages  
of poetic prose, each complete  
by themselves, yet  
interconnected like the links of a  
chain, forming the totality. The  
verbal passages are  
accompanied by pages of  
women’s names which echo  
their own meaning. O, symbol of  
woman, of the circle, is used

visually on blank pages, not as  
decoration, but integral to the  
story, the significance of which  
the reader can decipher for  
herself.  

In addition to language, Wittig  
sees violence, collectivity and  
separatism as being  
strategically necessary — for  
revolution. Les Guerilleres accepts  
the use of violence as an integral  
part of woman in her struggle for  
the new world. Violence is  
necessary to counteract  
violence.  

“The women say with an oath,  
it was by trick that he expelled  
you from the earthly paradise,  
cringing he insinuated himself  
next to you, he robbed you of that  
passion for knowledge of which  
it is written that it has the wings of  
the eagle, the eyes of the owl,  
the feet of the dragon. He has  
enslaved you by trickery, you  
who were great strong valiant.  
He has stolen your wisdom from  
you, he has closed your memory  
to what you were, he has made  
you that which is not which does  
not speak which does not  

possess which does not write,  
he has made you a vile and fallen  
creature, he has gagged abused  
betrayed you. By means of  
stratagems he has stupefied your  
understanding, he has woven  
around you a long list of defects  
that he declares essential to  
your well being, to your nature.  
He has invented your history.  
But the time approaches when  
you shall crush the serpent  
under your heel, the time  
approaches when you can cry,  
erect, filled with ardour and  
courage, Paradise exists in the  
shadow of the sword.”  

The violence portrayed in Les  
Guerilleres is brutal and  
frightening to those of us who  
have not recognized it as part of  
ourselves and a necessary part  
of the circle. If violence is  
necessary, it is possible only  
through separation from the  
enemy.  

“The women say that they  
could not eat hare veal or fowl,  
they say they could not eat  
animals, but man, yes they may.  
He says to them throwing his  
head back with pride, poor  
wretches of women, if you eat  
him who will go to work in the  
fields, who will produce the  
consumer food goods, who will  
make aeroplanes, who will pilot  
them, who will provide the  
spermatozoa, who will write the  
books, who in fact will govern?  
The women laugh bearing their  
teeth to the fullest extent.”  

In the face of struggle, there  
must be unity. We have to be  
able to rely on each other. This  
perhaps, is the most pertinent  

message to us in our current  
stage of struggle.  

“Friends do not let your imag-  
ination deceive you. You  
compare yourselves privately to  
the fruits of the chestnut cloves,  
mandarins green oranges but you  
are fruits only in appearance.  
Like the leaves you fly away at the  
slightest breeze, beautiful strong  
light subtle and prompt of  
understanding as you are. Beware  
of dispersal.  
Remain united like the  
characters in a book. Do not  
abandon the collectivity.”  

Les Guerilleres is the  
collective consciousness of the  
Lesbian Feminist movement —  
past, present, future. It is meant  
to be read aloud to each other; it  
is the dialogue from each of us to  
each of us, for all of us.  

“They say, if I relax after these  
great achievements I shall reel  
drunk with sleep and fatigue.  
They say, no, one must not stop  
for a single moment. They say,  
compare yourself to a slow fire.  
They say, let your blood become  
heated like metal that is about to  
melt. They say, let your eyes be  
fiery, your breath burning. They  
say, you will realize your  
strength, arms in hand. They  
say, put your legendary  
resistance to the test in battle.  
They say, you who are invincible,  
be invincible. They say, go  
spread over the entire surface of  
the earth. They say, does the  
weapon exist that can prevail  
against you?”

Surely, the 1975 San Diego  
Women’s Music Festival will  
stand as one of the most  
productive, joyous and  
aesthetically beautiful events for  
women this year. Imagine this  
setting: several hundred acres of  
woods, lakes and meadow, one  
thousand mostly bare-chested  
women ready to boogie and  
some of the best music yet to  
come from the women's  
movement. For three days,  
(Sept. 6, 7, 8) regular staged  
programming, workshops and  
almost continuous jam sessions  
provided the space for sharing,  
playing and playing around. A  
natural amphitheater with stage  
built under a massive oak  
encouraged women from all  
corners of the country to get up  
and do their thing for everyone  
else.  

And do it they did! Singles  
dominated the regular  

programming. One after  
another, women with guitars in  
hand sang their songs, mostly  
about, you guessed it: women.  
Exceptionally good; Soupy of  
Colorado, Holly Near, and Meg  
Christian of California. Both  
Holly and Meg were ably backed  
by Cris Williamson and Margie  
Adams (remember their  
performance at DFU?). While the  
singles soothed the days, the  
bands rocked us out at night.  
All the way from Juno, Alaska  
came Marswomen (they are all  
Aries) completely charming the  
crowd. The Shady Lady Blues  
Band got us funky and Moon, a  
three-piece jazz-oriented group  
from the Bay Area dazzled us  
with tight, complicated originals.  
Raw Honey of Denver was  
represented only in part by  
Christie Cuillot and myself and  
although we were greatly  
frustrated presenting only a

third of our act, the women  
seemed to love the few songs we  
did. Definitely the band of the  
festival was Bebe K'Roche (no, I  
don't know what that means).  
Their six-piece — percussion-  
dominated sound wowed ‘em  
good. They rock and they roll,  
and their original “Kahlua  
Woman” sounds like a hit single  
to me. Watch for their Virginia  
Rubino, keyboards and singer  
extraordinaire. She’s a comer.  
More kudos to: Fools  
Unlimited, a comedy/mime duo  
managed by Arina (Suzie)  
Isaacson, formerly of Denver.  
Sharp, sophisticated feminist  
humor has reached a new high  
in the cavortings of these two  
imaginative young women.  
Another kudo to Meg Christian  
for her “Song to my Mama”, a  
masterpiece. You can hear it on

Meg's Olivia Album, I Know You  
Know. For sheer presence, Cris  
Williamson deserves an award,  
her encouragement on others,  
her musical skill and  
professionalism make her the  
Women’s Musician Complete.  

Naturally, a few things went  
wrong: rain, start-and-stop  
drenching rain frustrated the  
sound crew (applause for a great  
job, Margo and Judy of Olivia)  
and forced cancellation of some  
acts. Low consciousness visited  
too, with some who came for a  
beer party, smoking in high fire  
risk zones and polluting the  
lakes. ("But it’s biodegradable  
soap.”)  

The true stars of the Festival:  
The San Diego Women’s  
Collective. Normally, they run  
an active and productive coffee  
house in the city, but they took  
on the massive job of planning —  
security, health and child care,  
food, fire protection and  
programming with marvelous  
efficiency.  

Of course, we all left high as  
kites. But, I think most of us took  
with us a new appreciation of  
the professionalism developing  
in the women’s music  
community, as well as  
notebooks full of contacts, ideas  
and tunes running through our  
heads, and most important,  
fresh enthusiasm for continuing  
the growth of our very own  
recognizable genre: women’s  
music.
