speak to global issues; we have a  
global perspective because of where  
we're coming from having lived in  

Latin America. But we also feel it is  
desperately important to root ourselves  
in something like an indigenous strug-  
gle in the city; otherwise, there's  

not much point in our being there.  

BMR: When you tour, do you connect  
mostly with left groups? How do you  
deal with women-only concerts?  

LUCHA: We have found that because we  
are an all-women's group coming from  
a Latin experience, that we combine  
two different kinds of groupings in  
the political spectrum. And the last  
tour we did was a real strong example  
of what that can result in. We orig-  
inally got the money to go halfway  
across the country from a women's re-  
ligious organization. And they were  
bringing in people who were basically  
interested in global politics. That  
was where we were in Denver. We played  
at Loretto Heights. And we also played  
at the Church of Guadalupe over in  
the Chicano section. It was very ex-  
citing.  

When we got to the West Coast we  
discovered—we already knew—that the  
women's community and the Chicano and  
other left communities—at least in  
Los Angeles—don't work together very  
much. But because of who we were and  
who we represented, they took it upon  
themselves to build a coalition in or-  
der to produce a concert. It was an  
incredible process that we simply  
sparked. We weren't there for most of  
it; we just did a concert. It was the  
concert we did with Holly Near in Los  
Angeles.  

The women of Iris Films co-sponsored  
it with the women of the Jose Medina  
Defense Committee. They had never  
worked together and knew very little  
about each other's struggles. As a  
matter of fact, there was historical  
tension between the Chicano—predom-  
inantly male kind of organizing—and  
the women's community. Although the  
person who is most instrumental in  
the Jose Medina defense is his own  
compañera, Rosa, who is a very strong  
Cubana, a very strong Latin woman.  

But obviously the committee is very  
mixed. And many of the men, if not  
all of the men, had never been around  
so many women, particularly lesbian  
women.  

Their process was to have numerous  
meetings, and to bring together a  
group of people made up both of women  
from the women's community and the

home for suitability, but was not  
aware of the existence of Donna Levy.  

The guardian ad litem eventually  
withdrew from the case before a form-  

al motion was made for his removal.  
And the judge, who was already lean-  
ing toward psychological testing of  
Betty, ordered the tests. A new  
guardian ad litem was appointed, who  
eventually recommended that Donna be  
awarded custody.  

Dr. Louise Apperson, a psychologist  
who tested Donna, testified that Don-  
na ranked well into the upper 10% of  
all the prospective adoptive parents  
she had ever interviewed. She also  
testified that sexual preference and  

“single parenthood had nothing to do  
with the ability to raise a child.  

Leona Kopetski, a psychiatric so-  
cial worker who interviewed the Lu-  
ceros, found that while they had a  
warm relationship, they "idealized  
family life" and denied any reality  
that appeared to threaten it. Not  
only did the Luceros not help Betty  
grieve for her mother, but they also  
contributed to the child's denial  
process, Kopetski testified.  

In January, Judge Weeks ruled that  
Betty remain with the Luceros until  
the final hearing because “in the  
short range" it would be detrimental  
to Betty to sever her relationship  
with Mrs. Lucero and her cousin Les-  
tie. However, the judge ruled that  
"in the long range Donna Levy is the  
preferable custodian; citing Donna's  
sensitivity, dependability and close-  
ness to Betty.  

A major factor in Donna's victory  
was the fact that the Luceros were  
not the happy nuclear family they  
pretended to be.  

Between January and the final order  
in June, the Luceros refused to par-  
ticipate in court-ordered psycho-  
therapy, and they also separated for  
a period of time in March. That sep-  
aration counted heavily against them,  
particularly because they did not  
tell the court about it, and because  
they had been warned that a separa-  
tion would be harmful to Betty.  

In final arguments, Gerash stressed  
the history of Lois Lucero's unstable  
marital life (two prior marriages be-  

“hicano community to do consciousness  
raising during the concert. It was  
what you would call security—but  
they didn't term it that; they termed  
it, trying to bridge the gap that  
would cause tension. And the concert  
went beautifully. . .It was an amazing  
experience—1600 people. Our under-  
standing is that the contact still  
goes on, not among a huge number, but  
among some. . .two of the women from  
Iris Films were present at the birth  
of Rosa's baby.  

The same thing happened to some  
extent in San Francisco. That is,  
among the people who had been doing  
Latin American organizing, there were  
some women from the women's community  
within the organization. But they  
had not felt like that was a part of  
themselves that they could bring into  
their organizing. But when this wom-  
en's band was coming from the East  
Coast, they wanted to bring it to  
the women's community. The whole  
thing opened right up, and the whole  
process has been very exciting. It  
happened just because we are who we  
are—not because it's something we  
tried to initiate.  

BMR: How do you approach women-only  
concerts?  

LUCHA: This is something we've talked  
about a lot, and find hard to deal  
with. . .It's just a hard question.  
When we've discussed doing women-only  
concerts, we've really tried to find  
out who those women are going to be,  
where they're coming from, why the  
women who are organizing the concert  
feel it's necessary that it be a  
women-only concert.  

For example, if we decided that  
this particular population of women  
was really important to reach, and  
we trusted the organizers, who deter-  
mined that these women would not come,  
the vast majority would not come, I  
don't think that we would write those  
women off. We don't want to write  
any women off. And yet we've been in  
situations—in California on that  
same tour—where an organizer for the  
United Farm Workers wanted to do two  

concerts—one for women only and one  

for mixed—in the same evening. We  
talked about it with her and among  
ourselves, and we called her back to  
question what does she think would  

be gained by that, and she ended up  
making her own decision that that was  
not necessary. So we haven't run into  
a whole lot of situations where we've  
had to make that decision.  

fore her relationship with Gil), the  
Luceros' separation, the likelihood  
of further separations, their inabil-  
ity to grieve for the loss of Betty's  
mother, their refusal to undergo  
therapy, and the obvious advantages  
of granting custody to Donna.  

It is unfortunate that the issue  
of marital stability was brought into  
the case; in fact it was a major issue  
in the Order handed down by Judge  
Weeks.  

It is obvious that Donna Levy was  
entitled—by all standards—to win  
custody of Betty. And it's also ob-  
vious that lesbian mother cases face  
incredible obstacles in the hetero-  
sexist legal system.  

Yet, the fact that the Luceros'  
separation was cited as an example  
of putting "personal interests" ahead  
of the interests of Betty is a re-  
flection of the kind of sexist rea-  
soning that is so often used against  
“unconventional” mothers seeking cus-  
tody of their children: mothers who  
do not have "stable" marriages.  

The Luceros lost their custody bid  
because they did not have the same  
level of commitment to Betty that  
Donna did—whether or not they stayed  
together; nor did they have the same  
sensitivity to the changes Betty needs  
to go through. Those were the facts  
that should have made it into the  
Order.  

The legal battle has left Donna  
with a huge bill: $5800 in legal  
costs and fees. Benefits, in addi-  
tion to the August Raw Honey concert  
at the Oxford Hotel (which raised  
less than $50 for Donna) will be held  
by the newly organized Victory Fund.

on every possible level: from phys-  
ical, mental, emotional, value sys-  
tems, the whole thing." Bernice sees  
this as a process of getting strength  
—and to imitate somebody is not to  
stand on your own strength:  

"And when I put a song out, I say,  
you can't imitate me because Bernice  
Reagon is standing in the room.  
There ain't no need for you to try  
to be Bernice Reagon. So why don't  
you hear what I'm saying and find  
out how you want to address that  
particular line. Ain't nobody can  
do that but you and that means I  
have to meet you on your strongest  
ground. And we come together on  
that basis and we're both powerful."  

When asked by a participant how  
she could relate positively to the  
Black experience, Bernice emphasized  
the importance of addressing one's  
own oppression: "Because when you're  
in a state of struggle, you can  
recognize it in others and be of  
use; otherwise, you're just being  
a missionary.”  

This question and response led to  
discussion about coalition politics.  
Bernice feels there's a low facility  
for coalition politics: this seems  
to be connected to groups with  
varying alliances and limited skills  
in being able to deal with other  
people who agree on one issue, but  
disagree on all others. Bernice  
addressed it specifically as:  

"I see a lot of people who think  
that because we are women that in  
fact all of our issues are the same.  
And that is erroneous. We are sep-  
arated by class, race and all of  
those things put a strong stamp on  

Kathy Kahn...  

came to Denver, where we lived for 3  
months.  

A federal fugitive warrant was is-  
sued for me and I was charged with  
“enticing away children," Missouri's  
parental kidnapping law. I employed  
at least seven private detectives, one  
of whom infiltrated left groups in  
Kansas City to try and find me through  
my friends. In November of '76, I was  
arrested and thrown into jail in Den-  
ver. The kids got away only because  
when I was arrested the police didn't  
seem concerned with searching the house  
for them. They only seemed anxious to  
take me to jail.  

While I was being held in jail, a  
private detective (who is known to  
have FBI connections), and who was  
working for Si put out the word to all  
the bail bondsmen and to my neighbors  
that I was a communist and that I had  
to be held on bond; otherwise I'd e-  
scape to China or Yugoslavia, and that  
both these countries had agreed to har-  
bor me and the kids. There were seven  
detectives on the case at $200.00 a  
day for 8 weeks. This head detective  
called himself a movement detective,  
whatever that's supposed to mean.  
Anyways, it became such a siege of  
terror that we finally had to surface  
the kids against their wishes. I had  
been held in solitary confinement  
while the police, together with Si's  
detectives broke down doors of move-  
ment people's houses looking for the  
kids. The judge threatened to take  
out kidnap warrants against my com-  
rades in Kansas City, and we had no  
alternative but to bring the kids for-  
ward.  

Si and Charlotte took the kids back  
to North Carolina, and I haven't seen  
them since. The two kidnapping charg-  
es, both felonies, were dropped “with-  
out prejudice," which means they're  
left hanging over my head for seven  
years in Missouri and three years in  
Colorado. The last time I saw my  
kids was for twenty minutes in jail in  
my prison uniform with a guard over me,  
and Cowboy just swore that he was go-  
ing to get away and that somehow he  
was going to get justice.  

This past July, five days after I  
was arrested on the Coors picket line,  
I received a summons to show up in  
court in North Carolina, so it's clear  
to me that what happens is that they  
move at a time that's very convenient  
for the FBI, and the FBI moves at a  
time that's very convenient for Si and  
Charlotte. You never hear of a case of  
the FBI getting involved in a mother  
running off with her children. You  
hardly ever hear of a woman going to  
jail over those kind of kidnapping  
charges. Clearly this whole thing has  
been used as political harassment, with  
assistance from Si and Charlotte, who  
are still trying to pass as progressive  
movement people, and in fact I think  
they are very dangerous to any left  
community, and working people in  
general.

organized. People are urged to call

us and we have to address the fuck-  
ups that are locked up in each one  
of those boxes. . .Women have dual,  
triple and quadruple identities.  
And when they become instruments of  
struggle, they have to address all  
of those identities. Every time you  
see a woman you are looking at a  
human being who is like you in only  
one respect, but may be totally  
different from you in three or four  
others. So when you come together,  
you come together for your common-  
ness, but give the child some  
space to be the other people that  
she is."  

Festival ...  

circulated before the festival, the  
collective took responsibility for not  
making a clear stand last year and of-  
fered encouragement to women who wish  
to organize their own festival on a  
different basis. The result was that  
a number of women committed to doing  
women-only concerts and skill-sharing  
did not have space to do so at Cham-  
paign, and for the most part, didn't  
attend.  

(A low-cost women-and-children-only  
festival will be held over the weekend  
of Aug. 30 near Mt. Pleasant, Michigan).  

One issue that cropped up in work-  
shops and conversations throughout the  
festival was outreach—how to use music  
to expose more women to feminist ideas  
and also how to use music to build  
bridges between feminist or lesbian-  
feminist groups and women in left or  
mixed movements. Below are excerpts  
from an interview with Lucha as they  
discuss that issue.

were getting increasingly more diffi-  
cult to obtain. Recently the station  
went through an upheaval and the mana-  
ger and programmer were replaced.  

In the face of all of these changes  
which brought pressure from the new  
people at KFML to conform to the new  
more conservative trend at the station  
the collective women decided to end  
Women Everywhere for the time being.  
For right now they are putting their  
radio skills to rest and pursuing  
other plans. Two members are leaving  

Denver and plan on taking their show  
to another town to continue this  
radio. Another member hopes to con-  

tinue feminist radio in Denver by  
working with the people who are in-  
volved in starting a community-based  
station, the Granfalloon.

indication, thousands of gay men in  
Denver.  

Lesbian politics are not gay pol-  
itics. Lesbians are oppressed as  
women before they are oppressed for  
sexual preference; therefore, les-  

bian concerns cover a much greater  

area than gay concerns. Until gay  
men realize that fact, activist les-  
bians will only give their energy  
to gay movement issues as individ-  
uals and for isolated issues.  

Can there be coalitions of les-  
bian feminists and men? Only if  
the handful comes forward to femin-  
ists. Otherwise, lesbians will  
find themselves oppressed, often-  
times more overtly than in society-  
at-large, by their “brothers.” Ac-  
tivist lesbians have no basis of  
unity with gay men until gay men  
realize their own sexism. It is  
the duty of the oppressors to change  
themselves.
