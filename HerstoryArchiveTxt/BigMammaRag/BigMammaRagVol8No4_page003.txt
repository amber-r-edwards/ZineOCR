Draft Analysis

Dear Judy, Lori, and Bobbe,

I read with much interest your analysis
of feminism and the draft in this
month's issue of BMR; I was especially
excited to hear of other women organ-
izing around this issue. Here in the
Boston area a group of us got together
about a month and a half ago to form
WORD (Women Opposed to Registration
and the Draft). We have a task force
working on feminist theory, another
planning and organizing actions, etc.
I'm enclosing some of the stuff we've
come up with—basically pretty similar
to yours.

We're dealing now with the thorny
question of just what is our place, as
an autonomous women's group, in the
anti-draft movement if there is no
longer a threat of registration for
women. There are so many perspectives
around the draft issue, some of which
incorporate feminism and some which
don't; anti-imperialism, civil liber-
tarianism, anti-racism, pacifism,
etc.—we've frequently been confused
about our role because it's not linear
at all, it's so multidimensional.
There's been some friction (fairly
mild so far) between our group and the
Boston anti-draft coalition; some of
its members don't wholly approve (to
say the least) of a group which ex-
cludes men.

Mainstream media response has been
okay so far. They're curious about
us.

Internally, there's a conflict
between women who see the draft, mil-
itarism, etc. as human survival issues
and want to work against them in a
women's (on the model of feminist and
lesbian anti-nuke and anti-racism
groups) with a feminist perspective
and others who feel that since there's
no longer purportedly any direct
threat of a draft for women, we should
leave the boys to fight their own
battles and go back to concentrating
on our concerns. I admit I'm person-
ally confused; things seemed a lot
clearer when I felt personally threat-
ened (although it turned out that, at
24, I wasn't draft-eligible after all).

Considerable energy and impetus have
dissipated—women have drifted away
(we had around fifty to sixty women at
the first meeting, but it's since
shrunk to a core of about 20-25) since
registration for women was tabled.
We're having a retreat in a couple of
weeks to discuss what our function
and focus should be in the anti-draft
movement, who we perceive as our
audience, whether we want to concen-
trate on reaching out to women—
especially high school women—or take
a more generalized approach (and risk
expending a lot of energy on duplicat-

COLLECTIVE

Blind Lesbians

Dear BMR,

We have just finished a catalog
called WOMANBOOKS FOR WOMEN WHO
ARE BLIND AND OR PHYSICALLY CHAL-
LENGED. We made this catalog
because women who are blind told us
they could not find the books they
need in existing catalogs. They
said they could not find feminist
books and lesbian books in formats
for the blind. We ran a list of
7,090 books (the holdings of WOMAN-
BOOKS bookstore in NYC) against
25,000 titles at the National Library
of Congress, Washington D.C. and
against 45,000 titles at Recording
for the Blind, NYC.

At the Library of Congress there
are 80 million books for those of
us with sight. There are only 25
thousand for those of us who are
blind. Of these, only a few hundred
might help women become aware of
(and thus begin to break free of)
our 5 thousand years of slavery.

In our catalog, books are arranged
by 37 subjects—subjects like femin-
ism, lesbian, rape, abortion—cate-
gories that do not appear in exist-
ing catalogs from RFB and NLS. Books
from both RFB and NLS are gathered
together in one catalog to make it
easier for women who are blind.
There is an author index, too. We
have read the catalog on to 7 tracks.
A beep system indicates subjects and
also letters of the alphabet in the
author index.

Women who need the catalog can get
it by sending $3 or two high quality
90-minute cassettes to: Gay and
Lesbian Blind, Suite 502, 110 East
23rd Street, New York, NY 10010.
Sighted women can help by sending
dollars and/or tapes to make the
catalog available to women who can-
not afford $3.

Lesbian Artists

Dear Big Mama Rag,

In the few years that I've been
supporting the lesbian performers
it seems that as they get more well
known they sell out on their lesbian-
ism. I feel that we are being used
to get known, then to perform for
the straights and get more money!
What really touched off my anger was
Cris Williamson, charging so much that
in turn if we want to see her concert
we've got to scrape up $7.50. I
haven't got that kind of money and if
I did I wouldn't pay it to see her
again.

Now when I hear of a new lesbian
artist I'm a little leery of what
their real motives are!

I know there are some exceptions to
the most like Holly Near. Am I the
only one who feels this way?

Rag Supply

Dear Wimnin,

I'm about to move to the country
and reckon I desperately need a
regular supply of Big Mama Rags
mailed to me so at least I know that
"somewhere out there” there are other
feminists, etc.

Enclosed please find a cheque for a
year's subscription (hopefully in-
cluding postage—let me know if it
doesn't!)

Your newspaper is wonderful—keep
up the good work!!

Thanks and look forward to receiving
your regular packets!

Understanding Revolutionary Feminism

Dear BMR,

I think what we are looking for is
an understanding of revolutionary
feminism. Perhaps it can be defined
most concretely by the kinds of activ-
ities pursued and the kinds of goals
envisioned. In contrast with liberal
feminism, it does not address heads
of state with petitions and pleas; it
makes demands and asserts control. It
does not recognize the legitimacy of
present forms of government or instit-
utional life (families, schools, health
systems, legal systems, etc.), but
strives to undermine that legitimacy
through strikes, demonstrations, self-
defense, and assertion of power through
community and workplace organizing and
through the building of a broad power
base for feminists.

It seeks alliances with all exploited or colonized groups
in the society, without compromising
feminist leadership around specifically
feminist issues. It seeks alliances
with movements for national liberation
around the world, giving support to
feminist organizations within these
movements.

Those who are engaged in such activ-
ities consistently, whether they be
factory workers, homemakers, teachers,
artists, civil servants, construction
workers, or lawyers, are (I think)
revolutionary feminists. Wherever we
are, we face the temptation of being
coopted or bought off—by union offic-
ials, by husbands or lovers, by "left"
organizations, by bosses or institu-
tional bureaucracies.

In some occupations, the risk of
cooptation is greater than in others,
and we need feminist organizations to
whom we are accountable in our daily
life, in our economic and political
activities, and even in our (some-
times unconscious) ways of behaving
toward each other. These organizations
can also protect us as we struggle to
subvert the institutions of which we
are a part.

It may be a good idea (and is usually
necessary for activists) to circulate
occupationally—five years as a school-
teacher, for instance, followed by five
years of factory work, followed by
work as a journalist or artist, farm-
worker, childcare worker, or bus driver.
If we organize ourselves, we can help
each other accomplish growth in our
personal lives which also serves our
movement.

Fetishism—the imposition of a mech-
anistic or “pure" model of a “feminist
revolutionary," with a rigidly defined
lifestyle, mode of dress, speech pat-
tern, circle of friends, occupational
choice—is an expression of personal
insecurity and theoretical confusion.
It is just as much to be fought against
as cooptation, escapism through drugs
or alcohol, and general backwardness.
