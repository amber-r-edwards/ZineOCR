RTD Lies: Union Strikes And Struggles

Deb Luger

This article is taken from
a conversation between myself,
Debbie Squires and Dona
Calacone. Debbie has been an
RTD (Regional Transportation
District) diesel mechanic for

union busting

about 4 years now. She has
been active in the Union
(Local 1001 of the Amalgamated
Transit Union) for quite a
while. Dona has been an RTD
bus driver for 3½ years.

Since July 12, 1982, RTD
Union workers have been on
strike. This includes bus
drivers, mechanics, clerical &
maintenance workers, traffic
checkers, & bus washers. Total
Union membership is approxi-
mately 1400.

There are presently only a
few issues left on the negoti-
ating table since the strike:

a) contracting work out to
non-Union workers

b) hiring part-time drivers—
RTD wants up to 15% of driv-
ers to be part-time, with no
monetary benefits, no choice
in routes or scheduling and
hired at a grossly lower pay
than full-timers. The Union
does not want part-time work-
ers, but may have to concede,
only under the condition that
part-timers are receiving
their fair share of benefits
& that full-time workers are
not laid off in order to be
replaced by part-timers. In
other words, part-timers could
only eventually replace driv-
ers who have voluntarily left,
i.e.: retired, etc.

c) wages—Union proposal is
for 1st year—complete freeze,
2nd & 3rd years—cost of living
& wage increase up to 12% by
the end of the 3rd year.

BUT THE MAIN ISSUE IS RTD's
ATTEMPT AT UNION BUSTING!!!

Union employees have been
working without a contract
since March 1st. Why has this
been so? When their contract
ran out in March, RTD repeat-
edly has negotiated in bad
faith.

The Union waited from March
to July to strike, for hope of
some good faith negotiations
with RTD & in the event of bad
faith (which had actually been
evident from the beginning),
for a Supreme Court decision
on mass transit and federal
funds. The Court was voting on
the issue of: if Company and
Union come to a stalemate in
negotiations, then "binding
arbitration" must take place.
What this would mean is that
an “impartial" arbitrator
hears both proposals & basic-
ally makes the final terms of
agreement. The Union was wait-
ing for this decision to be
approved by the Court because
they felt they'd get a better
deal with an "impartial" arbi-
trator than with RTD on its
own. It would also mean that
RTD's financial records would
be reviewed by the arbitrator
(in order to help make a deci-
sion on their financial status
and that would show where RTD
is really at. Unfortunately,
the Supreme Court voted this
bill "unconstitutional" be-
cause it would mean a non-
elected person would have
delegated powers on public
funds. At the point of the
"unconstitutional" ruling,
the Union went out on strike.
The Company's initial and
final proposals have been to-
tally unreasonable. Final pro-
posal as of July 31st present-
ed by RTD includes: contracting
work out, no cost of living
increases (in this city of
Denver which has one of the
highest inflation rates in the
nation), a 1-year freeze &
then a 96¢ increase by the end
of the 3rd year for bus driv-
ers, mechanics, bus washers &
maintenance, a 2-year freeze
& then a 30¢ increase by the
end of the 3rd year for cler-
icals & traffic checkers, hir-
ing of part-time drivers at a
wage much lower than full-tim-
ers & with no benefits & no
seniority. These are only a
few of RTD's unreasonable
points in the proposal.

While still in negotiations,
RTD & Kimball (RTD's Execut-
ive Director) have been ad-
vertising for qualified bus
drivers, mechanics & mainte-
nance workers in Chicago,
Atlanta, Salt Lake City &
more. Not only is this bad
faith, but the legality of
this is in question. This ac-
tion is no big surprise since
Kimball is notorious for his
strike breaking attempts in
many other cities where he's
previously worked. He & the
RTD Board of Directors &
Coors & Sec'y of Labor Dono-
van & Reagan & all his boys
(administration?) are sup-
porters of "Right to Work."
"Right to Work" bill, which
is already effective in Ariz-
ona, puts forth that everyone
has the right to work. What
it really means is that non-
union workers can be hired at
union shops, leaving unions
virtually powerless. It may
even mean that individuals
have the right to work below
minimum wage, and that all
workers, including children,
can work under any oppressive
working conditions at all.
This is a government approved
path to the sweatshops and
exploitation of workers.

So Kimball doesn't respect
the Union nor does he care
about running an efficient or
effective bus system. While
“heads would roll" in the past
if bus schedules were off in
timing or absent, Kimball
doesn't say a thing. While
Colorado residents voted
against a downtown light rail
system, we all are convinced
that a substantial portion of
RTD public funds are support-
ing this system, through the
OK of Kimball & the Board of
Directors.

And this is all nationally
being watched. Denver has be-
come a barometer for corpora-
tions to see just what they
can get away with against un-
ion workers. Reagan & his boys
set a truly reactionary path
with PATCO, giving all of big
business the go ahead to ig-
nore & exploit union & non-
union workers.

And the local media is pro-
management all the way and
proving it every day. The only
letters that are accepted in
full in the editorial sec-
tions are anti-worker, anti-
union & pro-management. We
know of many "letters to the
editor" of our local
"straight" press which have
either been denied print or
have been chopped up so de-
liberately as to deny any
explanations or opinions pro-
union. They are only present-
ing the Company side of the
story & false information at
that.

The media just focuses on
RTD workers earning $28,000
a year. Well that's not true!
RTD workers earn between
$11,400 to $25,600 yearly.
Only master diesel mechanics
earn at the top of the list,
which is about comparable for
them elsewhere (here in
Denver). And when RTD workers
work overtime hours they are
paid straight time, not time
