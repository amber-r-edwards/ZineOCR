in, several demonstrators met  
with Gov. Brown and showed  
the documentary film,  

Hurry Tomorrow. Not satisfied  
with his response to their  
demands, the demonstrators  
continued the sit-in and held  
a Tribunal on Psychiatric  
Crimes in his office which  
was attended by 150 people  
and a lot of reporters from  
radio, newspapers, and TV.  
Following the Tribunal, sixty  
participants marched on the  
office of Mario Obledo,  
secretary of Health, Educa-  
tion, and Welfare. The  
immediate effect of the sit-  

in was to start an investi-  
gation into inmate deaths  
in the California state  
hospital system, with a tre-  
mendous amount of publicity.  
A possible long-term effect  
of NAPA's activities was  
the creation of a statewide  
government-funded advocacy  
system for psychiatric  
inmates.  

Another successful campaign  
was organized by NAPA against  
the National Commission for  
the Protection of Human Sub-  
jects of Biomedical and Behav-  
ioral Research, a Congression-  
ally appointed body which in  
March, 1977, came up with re-  
commendations condoning the  
use of psychosurgery on child-  
ren, prisoners and involuntar-  
ily confined mental patients.  
In April, 1977, when the Com-  
mission tried to hold a meet-  
ing in San Francisco, 200  
people from NAPA and the Pris-  
oners' Union forced them to  
adjourn. Several other demon-  
strations were held to protest  
the Commission's recommenda-  
tions, and ultimately the  
Department of Health and Human  
Services decided to ban psy-  
chosurgery on those three pop-  
ulation groups in government  
funded institutions. (Unfor-  
tunately, H.H.S. did not ban  
psychosurgery entirely, and  
proposed that notoriously in-  
effective peer review commit-  
tees could regulate the pro-  
cedure.)  

Although former psychiatric  
inmates have rightfully taken  
the lead in the anti-psychia-  
try movement, the existence  
of institutions and policies  
which deny all human rights  
to those involved, profoundly  
affects everyone in our so-  
ciety. The problems faced by  
current and former inmates--  
denial of housing and jobs,  
social isolation, invasion of  
privacy, overcrowding, bad  
food, exposure to harmful sub-  
stances, vulnerability to rape  
and brutality--all are prob-  
lems faced by millions of  
people in this country. The  
"mental health" system encour-  
ages us to see these problems  
as personal, rather than look-  
ing to the source: the multi-  
billion dollar corporations  
which create an environment  
and culture where profitabil-  
ity is the only measure of  
worth. The solution to “emo-  
tional problems" cannot be  
found by turning to experts  
trained in the arts of power  
and control. The solutions  
must be found by trusting our-  
selves and each other in  
fighting back against the for-  
ces which are daily mystifying,  
robbing and damaging us. Or,  

as the slogan of the Mental  
Patients Liberation Front says  
"We'd rather be mad with the  
truth than sane with lies!"

originally appeared as part of  
a longer article on "Psychia-  
try as a Tool of Repression"  
in the March '83 issue of  
Science for the People.)

normal, healthy behavior.  

I rarely hear discussions  
about the impact of classism.  
Do you realize that most of  
the women who are the spokes-  
women and leaders of the fem-  
inist community are upper  
class or middle class academ-  
ics? Look at the bios in  
the books in the women's book  

not to be held back by other  
people's conception of talent.  
Many women are afraid to write,  
because they are sure they  
don't have talent. So I said,  
“I consider myself a great  
writer, as great as Virginia  
Woolf and Gertrude Stein,  
since comparing women's creat-  
ivity is pointless. After all,  
the idea of genius is a power  
trip that keeps us afraid to  
seriously explore our creat-  
ivity and power. Why compare,  
anyway, who can compare?"  

Well, no one could even  
speak for five minutes. What  
I said was total blasphemy.  

Whether a woman calls her-  
self a feminist or not, the  

real issue is whether she  
works to create a means for  
all oppressed women to have a  
voice.  

You're just  
a caterpillar.  

stores, listen to who speaks  
at rallies. Is a powerful woman  
one who has had achievements  
in the mainstream, white,  
male, upper-class culture? We  
are all being held back by  
this assumption that PhD ed-  
ucations and intellectualized  
speech means greater knowled-  
ge and insight. The respect  
that money, education, and  
position command is not at all  
a feminist value. It is a 20th  
Century Western Civilization,  
imperialist, male-dominated  
value. Amerikan cultural val-  
ues have been brainwashed into  
us and must be seriously con-  
fronted. That kind of con-  
frontation is not divisive,  
is often claimed.  

Once I went to a small group  
meeting of women who write.  
The conversation was going on  
and on about how great Virgin-  
ia Woolf and Gertrude Stein  
are and how we really need to  
study and study these great  
ones. It seemed to me that  
what Virginia Woolf was about  
was for women to go ahead and  
take their writing seriously,

who were formerly incarcerated  
and now are working in a fact-  
ory. A deep affection has grown  
up between the ex-patients and  
the other factory workers. One  
of the latter comments, "Be-  
fore their arrival here, we  

had lost a certain dimension  

of being human."  

The film ends with a party  
being held by the inmates with-  
in one of the large instituti-  
ons. They are honoring Marti-  
nelli, a current inmate who,  
sometimes at great personal  
risk, has fought for the righ-  
ts of patients, and inspired  
others to do the same. One can  
only wish that one were there  
to add one's own tribute to  
this courageous person, and to  
all the others (inmates, ex-  
inmates, workers, government  
officials, and filmmakers)  
involved in the creation of  
this profoundly revolutionary  
film.
