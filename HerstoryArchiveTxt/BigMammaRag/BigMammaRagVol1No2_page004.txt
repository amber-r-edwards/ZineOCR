society denied to her 19th cen-
tury sister, the middle class
lady of leisure.

While the majority of women
did essential, respected work
in the home, there was an in-
teresting minority of women who
worked outside the home. They
were butchers, silversmiths,
gunsmiths and upholsterers.

They ran mills, tanneries, ship-
yards and every kind of shop,
tavern and boarding house. They
were gatekeepers, jail keepers,
sextons, journalists, printers,
doctoresses, apothecaries, mid-
wives, nurses and teachers. This
comes as a surprise because we
usually think of women’s work
outside the home and in the pro-
fessions coming in the 19th cen-
tury, after a long and bitter
struggle. Apparently, however,
the prejudice against middle
class women working outside

the home, the horror with

which men heard women's de-
mands to be something more

than just wives and mothers,

was an idea that emerged not
early, but late, with the

growth of wealth and the bour-
geois culture of the late 18th
and 19th centuries.

So we come back to the ori-
ginal question, can we call
these conditions under which
colonial women lived, oppres-
sive to women as women? The
evidence of the oppression of
women per se is far from over-
whelming.

But sometimes we do find a
woman who was dissatisfied with
her position as a woman. I
wonder sometimes how Anne
Hutchinson, an early religious
rebel who ran intellectual cir-
cles around the governor of
Massachusetts Bay colony at her
trial, felt about the charge
that headed the list of com-
plaints against her, that she
had inspired other women to be
"rather...a Husband than a
Wife." We have no evidence
that Mistress Hutchinson was
anything but a religious rebel
but we have a little in the
case of another Anne. Anne

Bradstreet came to the American
colonies in 1630 as the bride
of an early governor of Massa-
chusetts. She was a poet, one
of the earliest in the English
colonies. Her poems run the
gamut from long philosophical
ones like "The Flesh and the
Spirit" to love poems written
to her "dear and loving hus-
band."
If ever two were one,
then surely we.
If ever man were loved
by wife, then thee...
But as happy as Anne was with
her marriage, she occasionally
spoke out against a society
that refused to take her intel-
lectual work seriously.
I am obnoxious to
each carping tongue
Who says my hand a
needle better fits,
A poet's pen all scorn
I should thus wrong,
For such despite they cast
on female wit:
If what I do prove well,
it won't advance,
They'll say it's stol'n,
or else it was by chance.
Despite the two Annes how-
ever, I think the evidence sug-
gests that given the frontier
conditions of the early colon-
ies in which life was equally
hard for both men and women,
and where women's work was as
vital and as respected as that
of the ordinary man's, great
debates about the essential e-
quality or inferiority of women
probably seemed to most people,
men and women alike, somewhat
irrelevant. A movement of op-
pressed women awaited a revolu-
tionary ideology of equality
and, at least as important, the
change of status forced on women
by the new industrial society
of the 19th century.

No. There is not as much writ-
ten about early colonial women
as there is about later women,
Elizabeth Dexter's Colonial Wo-
men of Affairs is the only book
about colonial women's work
outside the home. John Demos
has written a very good little
book on the colonial family, The
Little Commonwealth. Root of
Bitterness, a new collection of
documents edited by Nancy Cott,
has a couple of court trans-
criptions, Anne Hutchinson's
and a woman's who was accused
of witchcraft. There are bio-
graphies of Anne Hutchinson a-
round including one by a man
who attributed her rebellion to
menopause! Perry Miller's The
American Puritans contains sev-
eral of Anne Bradstreet's poems
and in yellowed notes from col-
lege I have listed a book by
J.H. Ellis, The Work of Anne
Bradstreet, if you really want
to get into it.

A friend who read the column
last time said she was compiling
a women's history bibliography
from the books I mention. She
suggested others do the same.
