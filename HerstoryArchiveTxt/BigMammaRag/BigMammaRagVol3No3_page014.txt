The new Feminist quarterly Quest is the most exciting new
journal since the Amazon Quarterly. The editors read like a who’s
who of dedicated grassroots Feminists with a long history of
impressive movement activities: Rita Mae Brown, Charlotte
Bunch, Karen Kollias, plus women from other countries. This is
the Quest editorial policy:

Quest: A Feminist quarterly is seeking long-term in-depth
political analysis and ideological development. Quest is
not an end in itself, but a process leading to new
directions for the Women’s Movement possibly including
such concrete forms as regional or national conferences, a
national organization or a political party. We, the editors,
are all women who have been in the movement for several
years and have reached a point where each answer leads
us to more questions. We have been through various
ideological and activist metamorphoses and end up feeling
that our overall perspective is still not adequate. Where
has the struggle brought us? Closer to real economic,
political, and social power for women? Closer to an end of
exploitation of and violence against women? Closer to
self-determination for all women? We do not have all the
answers ourselves and expect that Feminists across the
country and the world will contribute to this process of
seeking.

The first issue begins to describe the process of changes in
a Feminist revolution. Future issues will be on fame and power,
the selfhood of women, women and spirituality, and visions and
fantasies.

Charlotte Bunch’s criteria of differentiating necessary
reformist programs like ERA or daycare centers from co-opting
ones like more women executives was excellent. Rita Mae Brown,
in her Good Fairy role, was funny and brilliant in her analysis of
Lesbian Feminism. Her concrete examples of body language
differences among non-feminists, Feminists, and Lesbian/Feminists is a fine example of how head changes produce large,
readily-seen body language changes. The patriarchy will end when
women take up more space. A woman's space is large.

The last article describes the three main divisions of the
present Women’s Movement: the existential, the reformist, and
the anti-capitalist. The insights and drawbacks of each section are
discussed accurately. The need for conscious political education
within all groups is the timely conclusion to this well thought out

Feminist movement in small study groups. Because of its
in-depth analysis of the complex patriarchy, it is not easy reading.
Quest is clearly written and concise, but due to the enormity of its
task, quite a bit of work is needed to understand it. The patriarchy
is big and ugly. So let us meet the monster head on. Let’s study
Quest. Let us learn to outthink the beast, let us make our place,
our present head confusion, a better place - A woman's place. Read

ANTIGONE

I am Antigone,

Issue

of a house of sorrow,
Daughter

of the Fates

which bind men

and cast them into darkness,
Sister

of the Erinyes,

the Furies,

Mother of despair.

My dear, beloved ones,
distant now,
unreconciled,

bound by circumstance
to follow

the course now taken

though each knows the final end.

Each knows

the burden

which must be borne
on all tomorrows.

And I,

and I

bear for the both

the pain of all todays.

We must pursue

our destined finality.
The seeds

of this travail

were not

by our hands sown.
Blinded, as our sires,
we move,

in erratic fashion,
toward the completion
of our own
destruction.

OST

HARVESTER

These women come to the fields with the sun
in dirty jeans, high buttoned jackets

and bandanas wrapped half over their faces
and tightly knotted at the neck

like a hanging noose.

They climb aboard the Harvester—

a train leaving for a world that ends

where each row of tomatoes begins.

The Harvester crawls over the tomatoes

and They hunch over its long tongue
spitting out the red and rotted and green.

The small mechanical people, arms thrashing,
pick out the too wrinkled, the too hard

and throw them back to the field.

The Harvester moves along slower than the day
bumping and groaning with them,

slapping them with the shaft, bits of earth
stinging their cheeks, making their necks itch,
their eyes water, their noses run,

all that They cannot relieve

because their hands are soaked

with the juices and seeds and a few flies

that ended trapped too.

The foreman yells, “Vamanos, Vamanos!”
He rides on their ears into a dying sun
that They do not look up to see

that will be gone by the time

They step down from the steel engine
and walk away slowly, hands wrinkled
like the skin on tomatoes

They throw back to the field.

To the most spectacular event of our times.
Here you'll see the most vicious and dangerous animals in the world.
If you've paid your taxes the admission is free.

Please pay close attention to the signs!!!
Don’t feed these animals any pity and Don’t get too close to their bars.

These misfits are very dangerous, They'll try to steal your smile.
They may even try to reach out and touch your heart robbing you of

a little love.

Yes Ma’am, they’re dangerous all right!!
But we got them now. Cage after cage for your eyes to see.
Do you know that at one time they used to be free?

Grandma Grandma, quick come see. Hurry Grandma ---the animal in
the cage over there it looks just like my Mom,

UNTITLED

sit by the fire darling, let your body warm

while I singe your mind.

let us travel tonight and go above
the thin air, holding our breath lest

we explode.

I will show you stars, my love

and transplant
lightning on my
lips.
let sister sun's brilliance

follow in the footsteps of my

hands.

dazzle you with the cold intensity
borrowed from September

moon,

there are no corners holding
us

and I am

the galaxy.

LADY OF THE DOOR

Naturally, woman,

you think by remembering
the pale bonds

that cover us from birth
anyone could forget

the strong ones

that bind us

at the end of the other door.
I would be woman,

by first light,

who says something is loose
inside. Filament upon filament,
yes, woman,

the room is woven

and ready.
