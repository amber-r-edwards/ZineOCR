Women’s Coffeehouse  
Overperks

Woodwoman

The Full Moon Women’s  
Coffeehouse and Bookstore is a  
popular, nationally renowned  
meeting place for women in San  
Francisco. It celebrated its first  
birthday on March 7 this year,  
and it was right around that time  
that serious political differences  
within the Full Moon collective  
began surfacing. These  
differences have culminated in  
ten women leaving the collec-  
tive.

Since its inception, the struc-  
ture of the Full Moon collective  
has operated on two levels: the  
Small Collective and the Large  
Collective. The Small Collective  
consisted of the five women  
whose commitment and capital  
originally initiated the enter-  
prise. All power and respon-  
sibility rested with the Small  
Collective, who were also the  
legal owners of the business.  
The Large Collective was com-  
prised of all the women who  
worked as volunteers to staff the  

coffeehouse. Some of these  
women had been involved since  
before the Full Moon opened.  
Locking Horns  
Around February two major  
problems forced confrontation:  
The Small Collective was finding  
it impossible to continue  
shouldering all the responsibility  
for the functioning of the Full  
Moon; and members of the  
Large Collective were beginning  
to feel that they could no longer  
donate their labor if they were to  
continue powerless within the  
structure. Clearly some kind of  
restructuring was necessary. It  
was at this point that the Small and  
Large collectives locked horns.  
Members of the Small Collec-  
tive, afraid for the survival of the  
coffeehouse, tried to avoid  
change they felt was so radical  
as to introduce the danger of  
chaos. Members of the Large  
Collective, determined that  
nothing less than an equitable  
sharing of power would  
realistically suffice, pressed for  
radical restructuring.  

Feminist  

Relevancy and Definition  

Feminists Revamp —  
Socialism  

Kim Womantree  

“Socialist Feminism is a vision  
of the total transformation of  
society, a revolution. To defeat  
sexism, we must defeat the  
whole social system of  
capitalism, racism, and im-  
perialism, and we cannot do that  
without an organization that  
includes the whole working  
class. We do not know what  
form that organization will take,  
but we cannot deny our identity  
and our oppression as women,  
nor submerge the need for our  
own liberation, in the process of  
bringing about a socialist  
revolution.”  
from the introduction to the  
Berkeley-Oakland Women’s Un-  
ion Pamphlet, ‘Principles of Uni-  
ty”.

On the weekend of April 5 and  
6, in Oakland, California, the  
first regional West Coast  
Socialist Feminist Conference  
was held. Sponsored by the  
Berkeley-Oakland Women’s Un-  
ion (BOWU), the conference  
was open only to women in-  
volved in existing socialist-  
feminist groups. The conference  
was to facilitate communication  
between the different groups,  
and to focus on organizational  
practice. Attending were 190  
women from nine groups in-  
cluding Seattle Radical Women,  
groups from Sacramento and  
Los Angeles, San Francisco,  
BOWU, Santa Cruz, San Jose,  
and Eugene Women’s Unions.  

After some socializing and a  
welcome by BOWU, each group  
gave a detailed presentation on  
their herstory, internal struc-  
ture, problems, practice, and  
plans. With the exception of  
Seattle Radical Women, which  
split from the Socialist Workers'  
Party eight years ago, none of  
the groups present were over  
three years old. All have  
struggled and continue to  
struggle with questions of  
relevancy and definition:

In order to begin to  
answer these  
questions, many of the unions  
have followed the example of the  
pioneering Chicago Women’s  
Union, and drawn up Principles  
of Unity.

Socialist Feminist Analysis  
What is loosely defined as The  
Capitalist System gives humans  

money, prestige and power  
rewards upon oppression of  
each other. The power  
relationships thus formed in  
turn enable the System to sur-  
vive. Competitiveness and  
hierarchy, recognized usually as  
sexist oppression, are built into  
the Capitalist System, and  
woven into the fabric of our  
public and personal lives via  
nuclear family and male/female  
relationships. When these  
relationships become clear, it  
becomes also clear that to try to  
deal with sexism without deal-  
ing with capitalism is in the long  
run self-defeating.

Another basic premise is that  
under capitalism our needs will  
never be fully met. There is a  
need for an independent  
women’s union able to work  
with but not be co-opted by the  
male left and reformist  
feminists.

the ways in which women are  
oppressed under capitalism,  
how this relates to imperialism  
and struggles abroad, racism,  
and class, and the socialist

Structure:

Most of the women’s groups  
have evolved through one or  
more structures. The basic  
pattern seems to be that of an  
autonomous women’s organiza-  
tion, unified at least partially by  
shared socialist/feminist  
political beliefs, and subdivided  
into interest, focus, or work  
groups. Problems often en-  
countered in this subdivision are  
fragmentation, lack of feedback,  
and unified action.

Some of the unions have at  
large or “floating” members  
who belong to “no special-  
interest group. Disadvantages to  
this are that some members  
then feel alienated from  
decision-making, or generally  
out of touch. Another approach  
which the Berkeley-Oakland  
Union tried was assigning  
women to random small groups.  
This breaks down the cli-  
queishness that grows between  
women who have known or  

mediators were called in, long-  
time personal antipathies sur-  
faced at a series of grueling  
meetings; political differences  
polarized the group and finally  
ten women, one of whom had  
been a member of the Small  
Collective, left. Using funds from  
the former Full Moon Art Com-  
mittee, they published a state-  
ment in which they outlined  
their perspective on the history  
of the split and their reasons for  
withdrawing from the collective.

Collective, 363 Byxbee, San

Resolution

We haven't heard how the  
coffeehouse is functioning now,  
though we do know that it is still  
open. We understand that the  
old Small Collective/Large  
Collective system is still in  
operation, while active energy  
goes into researching alter-  
native structures. Next issue we  
hope to carry an up-to-date  
account.

time.  
Strategy and Practice

In the newer women’s unions,  
strategy and actual practice  
often seem to be the weakest  
areas. One reason it is difficult to  
map out beforehand is that  
strategy is often a play-it-by-ear  
kind of thing, adaptable to the  
situation, abilities of the women  
involved, and resources  
available. However, women are  
working on it, struggling,  
groping towards relevancy in an  
ongoing process.

The San Francisco and  
Berkeley-Oakland Women’s Un-  
ions believe in building a mass  
base by bringing their movement  
to the people instead of trying to  

Lesbian Hist

Exploration

Amazons

Rediscover Roots

Aurora Bingham

About 150 Amazons gathered  
in a mountain dale outside of Los  
Angeles to celebrate the Lesbian  
History Exploration conference.  
The isolation of the mountain  
forest provided the perfect  
retreat for the early May con-  
ference. The workshops and  
discussions that filled the  
following two days generated a  
woman energy of incredible  
intensity. The intensity of  
woman-identified-woman  
shared its warmth through  
music, food, dance and song,  
giving birth to the living reality  
and richness of woman's com-  
munity. An immense amount of  
planning for the Lesbian History  
Exploration was done by the  
Collective of Good Taste Produc-  
tions.  

The workshops centered  
around lesbian history. "The  
Lesbian Emerging in the Era of  
the New Woman" was a  
workshop presenting a historical  
perspective of the times and  
culture of being a lesbian at the  
turn of this century. “What the  
Well-Dressed Dyke Will Wear:  
How We Look, 100-1975" was a  

recruit to their movement.  
BOWU wants to make its  
presence felt, and has been  
successful by doing community  
workshops on lesbians and  
workplace, on the economic  
crisis, on child care, on women  
employed and unemployed.  
They have also done two radio  
presentations and want to get  
into the straight media more. A  
major part of union strategy is  
coalition work with other left  
organizations. They form ad-hoc  
committees around specific ac-  
tions. They may work with  
feminist groups around specific  
issues while staying away from  
a service orientation that leaves  
institutions unchanged. They

fabulous slide presentation of  
famous and infamous dykes in  
the dyke finery of the day:  
Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas,  
Amelia Earhart, and Romaine  
Brooks. The workshops and the  
following discussions inspired a  
strong sense of lesbian identity  
within a historical perspective.

The living realities of the  
community at the Lesbian  
History Exploration conference  
functioned with the ease and  
support of women-identified  
women. The food was delicious-  
ly vegetarian, with plenty of  
lentil soup, stoneground bread,  
honey and dried fruit to feed  
many a hungry dyke. Our pre-  
sent history was told and sung  
by Judy Grahn, Martha Shelley  
and Alix Dobkin.

The women who celebrated  
the Lesbian History Exploration  
left the mountain forest with a  
sense of their roots and  
strengthened in the identity of  
lesbian community. The Lesbian  
History Exploration Conference  
gave us a sense of lesbian  
community as a reality. We have  
our roots! We are growing  
together in lesbian community!

say, “a reform is only  
revolutionary when the move-  
ment is capable of showing that  
more than that particular reform  
is needed to solve problems  
people face in their lives.” The  
current focus group areas of  
practice are: labor, children,  
lesbianism, rape, theory (for  
study group), and anti-  
imperialism.

In the San Francisco Women's  
Union, priorities have been set  
for the next four months. Their  
internal practice will be 1) un-  
derstanding the character and  
practice of racism 2) dealing  
with it internally via self-  
education 3) developing consis-
