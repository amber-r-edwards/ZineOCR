A Minute Step Forward  
New Federal  

Deborah Taylor  

After five months of bitter har-  
anguing, on December 7, the House  
and Senate finally agreed on the  
terms by which the government will  
pay for abortions for poor women.  

This legislation forbids Medicaid  
abortions except when the mother's  
life is endangered or when she would  
suffer “severe and long lasting phys-  
ical health damage" if she were al-  
lowed to give birth. (Two doctors  
must certify that her health would  
be damaged.)  

In cases of rape and incest, Med-  
icaid funds will be allowed only if  
the rape or incest has been promptly  
reported to a law enforcement agency  
or public health service.  

This compromise legislation agreed  
to by both sides of Congress rep-  
resents a minimal liberalization of  
the Hyde Amendment which had taken  
effect August 4, 1977. Under the  
original Hyde Amendment, Medicaid  
abortions were allowed only when the  
woman's life was endangered.  

However, according to most esti-  
mates, two-thirds of the 260,000  
Medicaid abortions that were per-  
formed last year will still be pro-  
hibited under this legislation.  

To the extent that the compromise  
will allow abortions in cases of in-  
cest and rape, it could restore ac-  
cess to abortion for a number of  
women. In particular, it could help  
pregnant women under 18, all of whom  
are considered statutory rape vic-  
tims.  

However, it is still unclear  
exactly how various provisions in  
the legislation will be interpreted.  
This will depend to a large extent  
on regulations being drawn up by  
HEW Secretary Joseph Califano. Cal-  
ifano has announced on several oc-  
casions that he is personally op-  
posed to abortion.  

(At the same time that it is re-  
fusing public funding for abortion,  
the HEW is more than willing to pay  
for sterilization, currently cover-  
ing 90 percent of the cost of Med-  
icaid sterilization. 32% of all  
Black women under 30 have been ster-  
ilized, and 34,000 Native American  
women of childbearing age have been  
sterilized since 1973.)  

World Boycott Begins  

Legislation On Abortion  

This new legislation concerns the  
federal government; states can con-  
tinue to pay for Medicaid abortions  
if they so choose. Unfortunately,  
without the support of federal money,  
most states are withdrawing their  
state funding as well. So far 40  

out of the 50 states have cut off  
state funding for abortions.  

States are using budgetary prob-  
lems as an excuse to stop support-  
ing abortions. Actually, the cost  
of Medicaid abortions is small.  
(Colorado spent less than $100,000  
last year.) And the cost of each  
baby that is carried to term (or  
birth) is more than four times that  
of the cost of an abortion!  

(Luckily, Colorado is one of the ten  
states that is continuing to fund  
Medicaid abortions. Please see the  
article on page 1 of BMR for more  
information.)  

Crunch Nestlé's Quick!  

Deb  

News Item: Baby bottles have been  
banned in Papua, New Guinea. The gov-  
ernment has passed a new baby feed  
supplies act which bans the sale of  
bottles, nipples, and pacifiers without  
a doctor's prescription.  

The ban followed research in Papua  
which showed that breast-fed children  
are healthier and better nourished  
than bottle-fed children. The study  
also found that mothers often did not  
have the facilities to follow elabor-  
ate instructions for preparing the  
infant food which were outlined on the  
American-made (Nestlé's) baby products.  
As a result, their children got sick.  

There is a boycott currently going  
on against all Nestlé products in this  
country in protest against the big  
sales effort Nestlé is making in Third  
World countries to sell their baby  
foods and formula.  

Their advertising campaign has led  
to the death of thousands of infants  
because mothers want “to be modern" al-  
though the bottles cannot be sterilized  
and prepared adequately.  

With a profit margin of 72% on pro-  
cessed infant foods, Nestlé does not  
want to stop promoting its products  
even though people lack the means to  
use them safely.  

Sales of infant formula in western  
countries have declined in recent years.  
A search for new markets has led form-  
ula manufacturers to the Third World.  
Since no more than 10% of mothers  
(those who can't breast-feed) have any  
real need for formula, the manufactur-  
ers have had to launch a very aggres-  
sive advertising campaign to convince  
the other 90% that bottle feeding is  

“modern and scientific.”  

The advertising has been effective:  
i.e., in Chile where 95% of all mothers  
breast-fed 2 years ago, only 20% do  
today.  

Unfortunately, infant formulas are  
not appropriate for Third World count-  
ries where there is contaminated water,  
lack of refrigeration, and not enough  
money for fuel to boil water. The  
bottle and nipple become breeding  
grounds for bacteria. The babies get  
diarrhea and become malnourished.  

Doctors say there is an epidemic of  
"baby bottle disease.” Thousands of  
Third World babies have died and count-  
less others have become mentally re-  
tarded and permanently brain damaged  
because malnutrition is so critical in  
infancy.  

(In this country, baby bottle disease  
has been reported on Indian reser-  
vations, in farm worker camps, and  
urban ghettos.)  

Nestlé gives away free samples of  
formula in its promotion effort. By  
the time the mothers have tried it out,  
their own milk has dried up and they  
have no choice. Mothers have spent up

The right to abortion for all wo-  
men is under attack. Illinois re-  
publican representative Henry Hyde,  

sponsor of the Hyde Amendment, open-  
ly acknowledges: “We don't want to  
stop abortion just for the poor, but  
for all women."  

Opponents of abortion (Right to  
Lifers) are determined to get an  
even stronger ban on Medicaid abor-  
tions when the legislation goes back  
to Congress for renewal next spring.  

The Right to Lifers are also trying to  
get a constitutional convention  
called to write an amendment to the  
Constitution banning all abortions,  
because of a constitutional ‘right  
to life.' Nine states have already  
voted to call a constitutional con-  
vention which would be the first  
since 1789. (Twenty-five more states  
are needed.)  

Karen Stamm, a spokesperson for  
the Committee to End Sterilization  
Abuse and a member of the Committee  
for Abortion Rights and Against Ster-  
ilization, says, "The opposition  
has painted abortion as anti-family,  
anti-American, and anti-God. It will  
take a long time and a lot of work  
to change that. We need a steady  
barrage of court and public actions,  
an organized network capable of pull-  
ing out massive numbers of people  
and have solid community roots.  

"We have to tie abortion rights  
into other everyday concerns like  
day care, unemployment, comprehensive  
health care, and education, instead  
of leaving it as an alien concept."  

Last year, 300,000 women depended  
on government funds for abortion.  
Without this support, it is estimated  
that 85 women will be hospitalized  
and five women will be killed every  
week as a result of illegal or self-  
induced abortions.  

Most of the women facing butcher  
abortions will be poor, third world,  
and teenage women, since a good 60%  
of the abortions in the U.S. last  

year were done in clinics attended  
by the poor.  

Only 29% of the 1.1 million abor-  
tions last year were performed in  
those private hospitals in which the  
Supreme Court guarantees the right  
of women who can afford it to an  
abortion on demand.  

Mother  

LNS  

Jeanne Baum, a Native American woman  
is currently appealing her conviction  
of being an “unfit mother."  

Baum’s fight began in 1975 when her  
13-year-old daughter Siba criticized a  
textbook’s portrayal of Geronimo as a  
"bloodthirsty savage." Siba's teacher  
replied that "The Indians got what  
they deserved."  

The teacher also told the students  
that Siba had no right to be proud of  
her Indian heritage because of the  
“atrocities” the Indians have com-  
mitted.  

When Ms. Baum protested this blatant  
racism, the school authorities all con-  
spired to protect the teacher. Ms.  
Baum then removed Siba from the school.  

School district leaders responded by  
charging Baum in family court with  
withholding Siba from school “without  
just cause or valid reason." The  
family court judge ignored Baum's as-  
sertion that the school's “ignoring  
racist behavior was tantamount to en-  
dorsing racism." He ruled in favor of  
the school board and ordered Siba in a  
foster home.  

(Indian families are frequently bro-  
ken up by the state; Indian children  
are institutionalized and placed in  
foster homes 20 times as often as other  
children in this country.)  

The Baums fled their New York home  
only hours before officials were to  
take away Siba. They spent the fol-  
lowing year (1976) traveling across  
the country, staying primarily with  
sympathizers on Native American reser-  
vations.  

Last October 17, Baum presented  
arguments to an all-white male panel  
of judges at a New York State Appeals  
Court. They will announce their de-  
cision in several months.  

As Ms. Baum says, "A racist educator  
is no education at all."  

A brief signed by 115 organizations  
and individuals in support of Baum in-  
sisted that the issue is racism and  
not Baum's neglect of Siba. The brief  
stated that it is the "fundamental  
right of children to attend schools  
untainted by racial prejudice: schools  
which foster each student's regard and  
respect for the equal status of all  
peoples and groups in this society."

Women Prisoners Fight System  

On October 11, the U.S. Court of  
Appeals heard the case of the Bedford  
Hills Correctional Facility women de-  
manding that the preliminary injunc-  
tion issued last June, ordering male  
guards out of their living quarters,  
be upheld.  

The case was being appealed by pri-  
son authorities who had hired male  
guards earlier this year. They based  
their case on a court decision concern-  
ing equal job opportunity within the  
Corrections Department for men and  
women.  

The three justices presiding over  
the case were not as open-minded as  
the judge had been in June. One, in  
fact, was extremely hostile and worried  
that men would lose their jobs should  
final determination be in favor of the  
women. This is not the case as the men  
could be re-assigned to jobs elsewhere  
at the facility outside the women's  
quarters.  

He also believed that the issue  
could be solved by throwing out the  
‘bad apples" and that the men did not  
upset the women very often. This per-  
ception completely disregards the  
reality the women have to live with:  
men looking in on them at will, during  
their most private moments, while show-  
ering, at the toilets, sleeping, etc.  

The issue at stake here is the  
right to privacy that each sex is en-  
titled to from the other sex.  

The reality is that the presence of  
men in women's living quarters is just  
another show of threatening force on  
the part of the oppressor, another  
form of humiliation liable to break the  
women down and make them “behave.” Men  
in women's wards are there, as they  
are in the outside world, to remind  
women that they are powerless, weak,  
and inferior, and they better obey or  
else they'll be beaten up and raped.  

If the prison authorities were really  
concerned about equality for men and  
women, women would be granted equal vo-  
cational training and jobs in male dom-  
inated fields like carpentry, plumbing,  
and electronics. (These fields are only  
open to men in prison.)  

The treatment women get inside bars  
is a concentrated, terrifyingly magni-  
fied form of the treatment women get  
all over the world.  

The women's movement has not paid  
enough attention to women in prison.  
Black, Spanish-speaking, and poor,  
they are often more oppressed than we  
are. They are in prison for drugs,  
prostitution, self-defense against  
rape and wife abuse—"crimes" arising  
out of the despair of poverty and  
female oppression.  

In the process of examining the  
source of our oppression, we should  
recognize the similarities between  
our experience and the experience of  
women in prison, and not see them as  
the “other" from which we can safely  
disassociate ourselves. We should  
make every effort to embrace the exper-  
ience of our sisters behind bars.  

The women in prison are victims of  
the same system as we are.  

The final hearing of the case of  
the women at Bedford Hills will be in  
January. We should flood the court-  
room, write the Governor of New York  
State, the Bedford Hills Correctional  
Facility authorities, our legislators.
