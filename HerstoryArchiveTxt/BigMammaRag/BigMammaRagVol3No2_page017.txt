POETRY

HORSES

I want to go to Elitch Gardens  
and ride all the rides  
I want to sing to a bird  

I want to lie in the grass on  
the side of a mountain and  
be covered with green leaves  
Do children laugh when they eat Cheerios?  

What is the story you were going  
to read to me tonight?  
Is it the one I taught to you?  

Who said ears are for hearing?  

We are so naive. We who have no  
expectations  

Will you hold my hand while I cry.  

Let's go to the airport and buy insurance  

We can eat wildflowers again  

We can speak to the clouds in a very firm voice  
You dirty clouds! . .  

or something like that.  

I want to see you tonight the  
merry-go-round goes too slow  
I want someone to give this poem to  

Someone who knows what I know  
Someone who likes to run upwind  

Someone who eats cheese  
Someone who loves old ladies  

THIS IS FOR YOU, ANNA DOUGLAS  

It was a very busy day and I didn’t brush my teeth or really wake up  
so I ran my fingers through my hair  
swore deadly curses under my breath  
held my head in misery  

'til you  
an exotic Belladonna  
crowned me with your spirited laugh  

Someone who sprinkles their yard at night and nestled me in your steady, tranquil gaze.  

Someone who sees highways in the palm of my hand  
Someone who prays to the wheatfields of Kansas while  

driving home from nowhere  
Someone who sees eternity in the mirror.  

I want a hamburger garden with a border of buns  
A turtle who does stand-up jokes  

A stage for the turtle and me  

A closet of tuxedos  

A little boy with big ears  

Is everyone as old as I am?  

Who asks these questions?  

Am I hearing them correctly?  

Do I have the right to understand?  
Do I play cards as much as I'd like?  

I want a new deck  

I want to be a crowd at a rodeo  
and cheer for the bucking bronco  

Here, please take this meager poet’s offering,  
a spindly receipt of our friendship  
and view it if there is ever any doubt .  
that you are really  
loved.  

~Angela Wilson  

DIASPORA  

Pray for the children  
home in the streets  
card hustlers/smooth talkers  
at the age of nine  
sing loud hallelujahs in these silent halls  
and make the reverend shiver and pray.  

I want to whisper secrets to a large tree Judgment day is here and no one  

Number 7 was a Volkswagen  

I ate French donuts in Greenwich  
Village every night for a month  

Stars are patient  

I want to be new  
I want to meet you again  
I want to write from right to left  
noom eht ta tniugs ot tnaw I  
I want to put a cannon to my head  
and pull the trigger  

I want my scars to heal  
I want to forget my memories  
I want a drink of water  

I want to be a birthday party  
I want to know when it starts  

I want another turn.

SOLSTICE  

In the forest the women come and go  
speaking of our mother, Sappho.  
Speaking of them all.  

Speaking of woman, the beginning and end,  
woman, the ever continuing force of life.  

Speaking of Lilith and Cleopatra; the flaming Joan;  
Madame Curie and Lucy Stone.  
Speaking of them all.  

Woman, the regenerative. Balanced in swaying harmony  
between mother and daughter.  
Rocking out the phoenix.  

“I am the phoenix.” Yes sister,  
you are the phoenix.  
Speaking of them all.  

The phoenix of the earth.  

The phoenix of woman.  

The phoenix of life force; all that is feminine.  
Rocking, rocking it out.  

Moving the ashes.  

Joan, we have come to regenerate you.  

In the forest of the mother,  

In the power of our lives,  

In the fire of the night,  

Wrapped close to death, the wings unfold  
And the phoenix rises,  

rises  

Speaking of them all.  

-Linda Fowler
