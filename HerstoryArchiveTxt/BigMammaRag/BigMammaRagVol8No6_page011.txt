Lesbians & The Missing Link Of Feminism:

Constance Perenyi

In the last three years, I have
fully understood what it means to be
a lesbian. I have been ignored, taunt-
ed, followed, snubbed, spat at, and
tolerated. I have been forced out of
housing and, strangely enough, even
hired for a job because I am a les-
bian. I have dealt with men, straight
women, and lesbians in ways I would
not have if I had not come out. And
of all those experiences, it has been
those that I've had with other les-
bians that have made the most impres-
sions on me.

Time and again, I am amazed when I
talk to other women who, on the sur-
face, seem to share parts of my past
with me, but who also maintain that
their lesbianism has been a perfectly
rosy, fulfilling experience for them.
The overwhelming feeling that I get
is that women who choose to re-
late to other women are supposed to
be happy - instantly and automati-
cally. At times, when I have talked
about the pain of my first relation-
ship and the loss and sense of being
ripped off that I've felt with other
women - friends and lovers - I fre-
quently meet with disbelief. It is
as if we as women should never admit
disappointment in other women. We
build a bubble of contented and mys-
terious sisterhood for ourselves to
live in, and it is just too transpar-
ent, too fragile to survive disappoin-
tment.

tarial/clerical position were soli-
cited by the American Friends Service
Committee (AFSC), an organization

I connected with the anti-war move-
ment and other liberal causes, so

I decided to go for it.

From my interview on, I was aware
that my employers hired me on behalf
of their affirmative action program.
And at first, I was relieved to be
"out", and also so politically naive
that I did not yet question the
validity of the hiring plan.

tion) and even at that, the organiza-
tion and staff are "non-traditional."
I do not care how you cut it - trad-
itional or non-traditional - being
oriented towards religion and family
structure gives a group an undeniable
respectability and automatic credibi-
lity that I, as a lesbian, and espec-
ially as a revolutionary feminist who
is trying to make my way outside of
those oppressive traditions, will
never have

in the AFSC - unless I opted to

"Join up." I could have been accepted
if I had remained acceptable, if I had
not questioned. Admittedly, my ques-
tioning was tentative and inarticu-
late, especially at first; and that,
in itself, fed my self-doubts and
confusion even more. Most of the time,
I just knew that I was unhappy, and
that I did not feel a basis of trust
to talk about it with my employers. I
remembered that it is easier for

fe.

After the first nine months I had
begun to doubt, and only after leaving
recently have I been able to make ana-
logies. Something from the beginning
did not feel right; I was as uneasy
with my employers' expectations of me
as I had been with my parent's hopes.
In both cases, I molded well in the

beginning - quietly, responsibly and

respectably. I did what I was supposed
to do. I was a good daughter/student

and I was a good secretary/token lesbian.

But, there was a time bomb ticking in-
side of me, making me more and more
edgy, more and more unsatisfied.

At first as an AFSC employee, I went
dutifully to committee and staff meet-
ings. I heard and saw what the organi-
zation and its members try to do. I
was told by my supervisor that she
believes there are certain "values
and traditions" that are worth preser-
ving, that there is a human goodness
that must be developed within exist-

'If you could make two of your fantasies come

true, what two would you pick?

I would very much like to cure world
hunger and watch two women making

love too.

I have a puzzle to put together
here - I mean to connect some exper-
iences that seem so different and
confusing. Lately, I have really ques-
tioned whether my experiences as a
lesbian are like other women's -

I am guessing that they are. Even
though I'm often given the message
that they are not; and despite the
odds, I am trying to reconstruct the
commonalities. I am convinced that
the connection is that 1) as lesbians
are women, and 2) as women are objec-
tified, so therefore lesbians are ob-
jectified as well, both by the world
at large and by the inside world of
women's communities.

OUT IN THE WORLD

When I first came out openly, I
did so joyfully, unselfconsciously,
almost as if I had forgotten the les-
sons I had learned growing up in a
straight society. Even though it was
destined to become messy, I did not
think of consequences - at least ini-
tially. But within months, I was
subdued by reality and came out only
in situations that felt safe. I pro-
tected myself, but most importantly,
I safeguarded my closeted - but ob-
vious - lover.

Quickly, I learned to evade the
issue of lesbianism when I looked for
somewhere to live or somewhere to
work. I did not lie; I just did not
admit. So, I was surprised to find
a job listing in the newspaper that
encouraged "minorities and gay people”

ing systems. It did not take long
for me to realize what those values
are - they are those of religion and
the family. The way the AFSC promotes
their value system is by constructing
volunteer program committees that are
made up primarily of good family and
god-fearing people.

This expressed itself in seeming
contradictions. Nationally, the AFSC
supports the right of women to choose
to terminate a pregnancy; but locally,
an endorsement of a national abortion
week was blocked by committee members
who could not - as Catholics - get behind
the motion. I began to wonder if the
fact that I was a lesbian was shared
by staff with these conservative
committee members, or if I was merely
a silent statistic.

Besides the committee meetings there
were the few "social gatherings" I
attended before I decided that I was
just too out of place to be comfort-
able. What confused me the most was
dealing with a group that promotes an
image of total acceptance and a “gee,
you are lucky to be associated with
such a great organization” attitude.
If I objected, even moderately, to
the pervasiveness of religious be-
lief in the Service Committee, it was
pointed out to me that even if the
Friends are Quakers, and even if my
supervisor was a Roman Catholic nun,
the fact remains that not everyone
involved is religious (meaning they
do not belong to a specific denomina-

To Whom it May Concern,

I will be coming out officially

on Saturday, October 12.
Everything that happens
before then doesn’t count.

- Nicole Hollander/ Na, can I be a feminist and still like men?

And that is my first connection.
When I started the job, I was seen not
just as a token lesbian, but as some-
one who could possibly become a member
of the big, happy organizational fami-
ly. I got a job another lesbian may
not have gotten if she had not been
their "type" - if she had been some-
one who, because of her background,
education, looks, way of speaking,

had gotten in the way of the AFSC pro-
gram.

In time, as I became more sure of
my feminism, I got in the way too. And
for a long while, I blamed myself for
not fitting in. I had not dealt with
a family atmosphere for years, and

I sure as hell could not, or would not
do it again. Even if I was accepted
on some levels as a lesbian, I was ne-
ver taken seriously as a feminist.

(My supervisor would read something I
had written in Big Mama Rag and ask
when I was going to “do something "
with my writing - like sell it to

Ms. or Nation.)

Frequently, I went through a day of
work feeling crazy, like I was fail-
ing...I had to keep reminding myself
that my definition of feminism was
different than that of my employers -
that when I spoke of myself as a fem-
inist, I meant more than just putting
women into leadership positions. There
seemed a greater respect for lesbians
running for Congress than for lesbians
working with unpaid, unrecognized
collectives.

I felt split in half, and in brief
moments of clarity when I could stop
blaming myself, I saw that the prob-
lems stemmed from a misleading "af-
firmative action" policy. Would an
employer hire a disabled person and
then ask her to climb three flights
of stairs to get to her desk? How
about hiring a token black woman or
a Chicana and then requiring her to
attend all-white social events? How
about hiring a lesbian, a radical fem-
inist, and then trying to integrate
her into a religious, family-oriented
organization? Until an employer is
willing to deal with all of the ram-
ifications of hiring someone "differ-
ent", and that may mean slowing down
a program and doing some introspec-
tive evaluation, then affirmative
action is just a farce - it is doomed
to fail and it is the “outsider” who
will suffer by either conforming or
leaving.

After months of struggling with
myself and the organization, I gave
notice. While the most obvious rea-
son for leaving was my political di-
vergence with the AFSC's pacifism,
it was not the most important, at
least to me. In so many ways, I felt
powerless to change my position with

my mother to accept me as a lesbian
(she once told me that her friends
knew "what" I was) than as a feminist,
as an adult woman who might, in some
ways, be like her. Likewise, it was
easier for the AFSC to see me as a
gay person rather than as a woman who
defined herself, and her feminism
differently than they do. I was stuck
in a role because, for once, I had
been promised acceptance for that
role.

WITH OTHER WOMEN

At first, when I agreed to write
about role playing in the lesbian
community for this issue, I did not
understand why I wanted to clear my
head about the AFSC first, or even
how the two issues connected. All I
knew was that the deep anger and dis-
appointment I felt about both were
similar.

Actually, they are similar in many
ways because both my experiences with
roles and with affirmative action have,
at different times in my life, denied
me my full self. If my job denied my
identity as a feminist, so have my re-
lationships in which my identity as
a woman has been scorned.

Aware of my lesbianism at the age
of 13, I did not act on my feelings
until my early twenties. Looking back
on those confused years, I am glad
that I waited because, in a sense, it
was an act of self-preservation. I
also had plenty of time to learn
what I liked about myself and other wo-
men; and so by the time that I came out,
I had a lot of expectations. My rela-
tionships with men had been tradi-
tional and destructive, and I found I could
no longer ignore my feelings of attrac-
tion for women.

I was drawn to my first lover because
I was sure that she was a lesbian and
that she would not laugh at my feel-
ings about her. Although I had assumed
all of this from afar, I was correct
in my assumptions and within a short
period of time, we became sexually in-
volved. Or rather, she became sexually
involved with me - during the first
several months of our relationship,
she touched me while she subtly, and
sometimes not so subtly, put her own
body off limits to me. At first, I
was confused and hurt; she explained
that she had some hang-ups about her
sexuality, and she asked me to be
patient. But for the year that we
were involved, she never really opened
up to me. The few times she let me
touch her were followed by complete
denial on her part. Twice, she abrupt-
ly terminated her connection with me.

So then I threw her on the bed, and I said, ‘Look, Mabel, I am now issuing my own
White Report!

by taking another lover and insisting
that she wanted to be monogamous with
her. The last time ended our involve-
ment as lovers - and friends.

It has taken me almost two years to
figure out what went wrong. Again, I
began by blaming myself, by naively
looking away from what was the most
obvious. My first lover, who was al-
most a decade older than I was, came
out as a teenager and had developed
a misogynist, male-identified attitude
towards her lesbianism. I soon real-
ized that she wanted to be involved
with "femmes" so that she could re-
main the "butch" on top. Yet, she
hated her lovers for our womanness -
she ridiculed, again subtly and not
so subtly, my softness. And in rebell-
ion, I chopped off my hair and stopped
wearing dresses because I wanted her
to treat me as an equal. I was less
comfortable with myself than I had
been in straight society - and in many
ways, I was less willing to take re-
sponsibility for my own life.

I did write a lot of poetry then,
trying to unscramble my feelings of
shock and disappointment:

I wanted you to love me so much
that I was willing to sacrifice
everything.
And when I had in fact sacrificed
everything,
I did not remember who I was;
then, I wanted to hate you,
and I ended up where I had begun,
wanting you to love me

because,

I no longer could.

And:

colored plastic.
you said,
"Ah, here it is -
your discontent
your reasoning & rationality
your sexuality

And you asked me why we never talk
about you,
and I could not answer.

For hours you grief-bombed me,

with anger and doubt
And you wonder why we never talk
about you.

For hours, I listened, and cried,
and tried to fight back,

of course, the only reason I resist
you is that you say you are right,
but somehow, when I am safely shelt-
ered from your emotional arsenal,
I know that I am alright.

And you wonder why we never talk
about you.

To me, that role playing in itself con-
tinues to split us in half; it separ-
ates lesbianism from feminism and
it makes us feel insecure as women.
Also, it keeps us non-threatening by
maintaining the status quo that keeps
men strong and women weak.

The connection between these two
parts of my past seems clear now -
both are tied to my identity as a
lesbian and as a feminist, and both
have put me in a place of denying
myself as a whole being. When we as
women are seen in only one light, we
are objectified. If we're not made
into centerfolds or men's willing
wives, we're simply cast as dykes. We
can be another woman's “femme” or
"butch", or we can be someone's to-
ken lesbian friend or employee. When we insist on being taken ser-
iously as feminists, our lives
become more difficult, but also more
fulfilling. We force ourselves and
each other to integrate our feelings
about women into our lives, our re-
lationships, and our politics. We

And then, I was flooded with the
anger I had felt after months of hum-
iliation. I wrote about feeling the
same kinds of insecurities I had felt
around men - I felt shamed, unattract-
ive, and worthless. But mostly, I
was furious:

You tip through women like index
cards,

each of us filed according to
our ability to make you
feel good about yourself.
And when our experiences become dog-
eared,
you tear us in half,
you throw us away
piece by piece
until you can start all over again.

Much later, after gaining some per-
spective and talking with other lesbi-
ans, I realized that most of us, whe-
ther we are feminist or not, have had
experience with role playing with
other women. The reasons seem clear
to me now - we have all experienced
not only the misogyny of our culture,
but the pressure to define ourselves
as either masculine (meaning: strong,
independent, dominant) or feminine
(meaning: fragile, pretty, submiss-
ive). As confining as these charac-
teristics are, it is often easier
to play along with the game than
to break the rules. For two women
relating as lesbians, tradition
has set up "acceptable" roles of
husband and wife to make the rela-
tionship seem a little less perverse.

because they have adapted to male
