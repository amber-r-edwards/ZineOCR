Jan Clausen takes on “political women”

Politically active feminists have  
a lot to contend with. First, there  
is the antagonism of the outside  
world - the institutionalized and  
internalized hatred of women that is  
compounded if we are lesbians, and  
intensified even further, it seems,  
if we are feminists who choose to  
work outside the system. Next, there  
is the struggle that we face with  
other women within our own "communi-  
ties," if we can call loosely-knit,  
and politically undefined groups of  
coexisting women "communities." Now  
it appears that we have a new prob-  
lem to cope with, and that is the  
stereotype of the "political woman"  
put forth in a new anthology of  
short stories by Jan Clausen.

Having read and appreciated Clau-  
sen's poetry over the past few years,  
I picked up Mother, Sister, Daughter,  
Lover ready to dive into a refresh-  
ing combination of fiction and poli-  
tics. Instead, I found myself diving  
headlong into cement, reading the  
first stories cautiously, then feel-  
ing confusion and finally outrage.  
For nearly a week after finishing  
the last story, I doubted myself and  
my politics, had symbolic nightmares  
in which I was involved in active,  
bloody struggle with both men and  
women, and finally realized that it  
was Clausen's intentions, and not  
my commitment, that I should be  
scrutinizing. I am deeply concerned  
about the effects that this seeming-  
ly "innocent and sensitive" book will  
have on the political women's move-  
ment.

-Women in the Struggle for Liberation

On the surface, all of Clausen's  
stories are about women's relation-  
ships with each other, just as the  
title implies. Most of the women are  
downwardly mobile white lesbians in  
their late twenties/early thirties,  
living in New York City on food  
stamps, welfare, or low paying jobs.  
Many of the stories involve young  
daughters, and their connections  
with either biological or non-biolog-  
ical mothers, who almost always are  
peripherally involved with the poli-  
tics of the women's movement. The  
stories seem to be variations on the  
same themes, but there are two that  
best exemplify Clausen's approach to  
the lives of her subjects, and most  
significantly, to feminist politics.

The first, appropriately titled  
"Today is the First Day of the Rest  
of Your Life," is the longest story  
in the collection. It details a day  
in the life of Alice, from lonely  
waking hours, through early morning  
hassles with her daughter Jackie,  
onto the trials and tribulations of  
the unemployment office, more hassles  
with Jackie, the inevitable encoun-  
ter with a "political woman," a sur-  
prise encounter with a current under-  
aged fling (who is having problems  
with the older woman who is “keeping  
her,”) and finally dinner with a for-  
mer lover. Throughout the story, A-

lice seems a bystander in her own  
life, motivated more by a sense of  
should's and should-not's than any  
real involvement with her own pain,  
or the pain of other women. The most  
telling part of the piece occurs  
when daughter Jackie comes crying  

to Alice after she has been teased  
by a neighbor boy. Feeling character-  
istic white, liberal guilt, Alice has  
just explained to Jackie that Leroy,  
who is black, probably has some good  
reasons for feeling angry with white  
kids:

"Oh, Leroy, Schmeroy." Thus Jackie,  
miraculously recovered from her  
grievances, her eyes perfectly dry though  
her cheeks are still blotched red.  
"I don't even care about Leroy. He's  
just a baby anyway.”

"What in the world are we talking  
about, then?" But Alice, though wi-  
tated, recognizes in operation Jack-  
ie's amazing knack of finally get-  
ting around to the real emotional  
point (oh in this I've done well,  
she thinks, modestly taking credit,  
she's so in touch with her feelings).

"I just wanted to know why I'm  
the only one who is different,  
that's all."

Alice is mystified, as perhaps she  
is meant to be. "Different from  
what?"

"Just different. From everybody. I  
mean, everybody's something. Every-  
one's Black or Italian or Jewish or  
Puerto Rican or Catholic or Irish  
or Lutheran or Something. I’m the  
only one who's nothing."

"Oh sweetheart." Alice wants to  
laugh, and though she doesn't it  
shows. "You and me both," she says  
hugging Jackie. "We're both in the  
same boat, we're both nothing. It's  
called being a WASP, a plain, bor-  
ing old American. Some places they're  
in the majority, though not on  
this block, not on the IRT express,  
not in the world.”

She is too easily amused. "Not  
you," and Jackie pulls away. "You're  
you know, you're with women. By  
which Alice understands that her  
daughter is too prudent to use the  
word "Lesbian" in front of her  
guest. And perhaps she's right.  
Though the apartment is full of pos-  
ters, books, magazines on which  

~New Women's Survival Sourcebook

that word is emblazoned, and though  

Delores (ed: Jackie's best friend)  
has been coming over for years  
without incident, still it is true  
that some things are best left un-  
articulated. "It's just me, I'm  
the only one who is nothing,"  
Jackie concludes, and begins to wait  
again, compressed by her own presen-  
tation.

And later, after having defused  
the situation by comforting Jackie  
with the possibility of spending  
more time with her grandmother,  
Alice muses:

But vacuuming her living room  
aug she puts it all together, sees  
things differently: how the children  
protect her, each other, them-  
selves: how she protects herself  
protecting them. And where they  
have learned to lie, Delores not  
wanting to say what she knows  
about racism, pretending to be-  
lieve that people are people. Jackie  
unable to lash out at Leroy with  
the first, obvious weapon to  
readily to hand: Black bastard. She  
wonders if perhaps they really ima-  
gine her to be as innocent as she  
has wanted to imagine them. Maybe  
they think she thinks she lives,  
they all live, in the better world  
she has tried to get them to act  
as though they live in: maybe their  
guilt is that they cannot share  
her imagined innocence.

This imagined innocence is not just  
Alice's - it is Jan Clausen's - and  
it is not some kind of literary de-  
vice - it is the tone that dominates  
every story in the anthology. Like  
all pretended innocence, though, it  
is dangerous; and this is most evi-  
dent to me in the piece called "The-  
sis: Antithesis." It begins, "Two  
women were friends; then they quarel-  
led over politics.” Immediately, we  
pick up that they are no longer  
friends; and we perceive that for A-  
manda, from whose perspective the  
story is told, politics is the great  
divider, the monster that alienates  
and separates women friends. Jean, the  
"political woman," is no longer Aman-  
da's friend; but she remains a fas-

love to love Jean, if only Jean were  
a different kind of woman; but in-  
stead, all Amanda can muster is that  
fascination, and contempt. And once  
again, the main character remains  
"innocent":

Take, for example, my first sen-  
tence: ‘Two women were friends; then  
they quarelled over politics.' Neith-  
er Jean nor Amanda would have used  
the word "quarrel." Amanda would have  
said that her friend Jean had simply  
become impossible; that she, Amanda,  
had to draw the line somewhere. This  
is how half of her, the rational,  
injured half, would have explained  
it. The guilt-ridden, remorseful  
half would have retorted sarcastically,  
'Yes, she got to be too much  
trouble, so you ditched her. You  
didn't want to be bothered." To be  
fair, most of Amanda's friends would  
have corroborated the first explana-  
tion; they too found Jean, or rather  
her politics (but it became increas-  
ingly difficult to separate Jean  
from her politics; this was part of  
the problem), insufferable.

The story goes on to explain that,  
on the other hand, Jean and her  
friends would have bought the  
"guilt-ridden" explanation: that Am-  
anda had indeed ditched Jean. But,  
nowhere are Jean's feelings about  
this given credit. Instead, the  
rest of the story goes on to paint  
Jean as a driven, unreasonable and  
fanatic woman. At one point, we are
