violence, to change a society which  
endorses violence against women, and  
to end sex-role stereotyping.  

We look forward to working with  
you.

BMR: Living collectives?  

Tommy: Yes. Four or five women and  
their kids living together and they  
have one counselor who comes whenever  
they miss.  

BMR: Is the safehouse being used as a  
basis for other political activities,  
besides the living collectives?  

Alex: They want to politicize

their lives. Sometimes we burn out be-  
cause we find that half of the women go  
back (to a situation in which they are  
battered). Then we say, O.K. but they  
know they can come back and maybe the  
second or the third time, they check it  
out.  

But we have to find out  
what the woman wants to do.  
If she wants to go back, we try to help her be  

Give Me Your Good Ear  
From Page 19  

Give Me Your Good Ear is Francie's  
cry to her mother, to her be-nice-  
everything-will-be-alright mother. It  
is Francie's cry to listen, to admit  
the past, to release the anger and pain  
that catapults from mother to daughter.  
To break the chain. To start to heal,  
and maybe to go on from there. Maureen  
Brady's novel is the well-told story of  
a woman coming to terms with her mo-  
ther in herself and with the events in  
the past that, once lived, have to be  
understood.

DON'T AGONIZE - ORGANIZE  

Inform yourself and others about  
worker rights and responsibilities  
and exercise them. This might  
happen through union meetings,  
community meetings or leaflets and posters.  

Encourage further women's occupational  
health research through WOHRC and  
pressure on OSHA and NIOSH by women's  
groups.  

Encourage more funding of NIOSH re-  
search and OSHA enforcement through  
informing and pressuring congresspeople.  

Make sure your union or employees  
association considers women's health  
and safety needs a priority rather  
than a reason for exclusion.  

Fight against the exclusion of  
women by “health” standards, rather  
than employers making the job safe for any-  
body to do.  

Learn about substances and  
practices used in your job. Watch for  
unsafe practices and find your voice.

wants a divorce or she wants to be  
alone, we give her support.  
So we have to start with  
the individual woman.  

BMR: The safehouse is  
important to...  
I think it's the most important because it's in the  
community. It's the only known safe  
place.  

Tommy: I think we've had  
contact with institutions -  
services, court...  

BMR: I can see where  
this could impact!  

about the power relations  
between men and women in society.  

Alex: Yes. I expect this to happen in  
court because all the judges who are  
trying the cases of battered women  
are forced to confront what is  
happening in the family. They  
take it away and don't think  
about the women who must  
be held some  
accountable.  

and you must be  
mindful in knowing you  
are not alone.
