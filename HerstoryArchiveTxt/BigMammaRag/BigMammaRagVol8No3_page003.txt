Weinbaum Replies

Dear Big Mama Rag,

I am writing concerning the review
of my first book, The Curious Court-
ship of Women's Liberation and Social-
ism, Vol. 8 No. 1, by Ingrid Hughes.
Actually, I am not writing to defend
myself as reviewed authors are likely
to do; in fact I commend you for
printing the best review the book had
gotten yet. Hughes has stressed what I
often forget myself not only in the
writing of books but also in daily
life practice: that unconscious motives
do not invalidate the conscious ones.
I am sure this will help those who
might be having difficulty with the
psychohistory interpretation.

Something which might come as a
surprise to those who read my inter-
view with Carol Anne Douglas in O44
Our Backs (Summer '79) where I voiced
some of my frustrations with South
End Press, here I am writing to defend
the publisher which on some accounts
Hughes felt deserved to be faulted.
Hughes brilliantly conceives a connec-
tion between Dorothy Dinnerstein's
book, The Mermaid and the Minotaur,
and my own. In fact Hughes' linking
of the two makes my own interpretation
less outlandish and more palatable. I
am linking the two—along with other
Freudians such as Chodorow and Horney
—in further writings.

The defense of the press here is
that the suggestion of incorporation
of feminist Freudian writings was made
by the South End people. Although I
understood the basis of the suggestion
I chose to not follow it at that par-
ticular moment. The South End collec-
tive suggested that an index might
be useful. I declined that as well.
The faulting for the proofreading is
mine also, for I did have ample oppor-
tunity to touch up the bulky galleys.

In fact, given the times and the
economic situation, South End does not
deserve to be faulted but should be
commended for existing at all.

With love to all whose stamina for
struggle is manifest by reading this
paper,

Correcting Mistakes

Dear Editors:

I would like to correct a couple
of mistakes you made in printing my
review of Batya Weinbaum's Curious
Courtship of Women's Liberation and
Socialism. In referring to attitudes
men have that prevent women's freedom
I wrote, "This sexual jealousy is not
conscious." You printed "unconscious."

In addition, in the next to the
last paragraph there is a sentence
that should read: "I think she is
suggesting not just an analytic tool,
but an ideological one: if we start
thinking of the family as a house-
hold, and then break that down to
its members, we can begin to see the
members in their peer kin groups
(sisters, brothers) rather than their
families, and thus change our con-
sciousness." You left out a few
words.

I am delighted to have you print
my work, but regret these and other
mistakes (accept for except, con-
trolled for controlled). I work hard
at my writing and would like readers
to know what I wrote.

In sisterhood,
Ingrid Hughes

Draft Response

Dear BMR,

Your coverage of the February 13th
community meeting which led to feminist
participation in the International
Women's Day Stop the Draft rally was
unfair and misleading—both for what
your story said and left out.

You didn’t say how the 30 women who
showed up that night at Woman to
Woman—many of whom had never set
foot in the bookstore before—were
prepared to organize as feminists
against the draft. I think that's
a really important thing in our
community; it's a big change from the
60's, when doing anti-war work meant
putting our own politics in the back-
ground.

You didn't even hint at why we de-
cided to work on a demonstration
with other groups—as opposed to
going it alone. Many of us felt that
we could make a strong feminist pres-
ence at a large, very visible rally;
that we could thereby have our say
with groups we seldom ever see let
alone work with, and that may be,
just may be, we could begin a broad-
based anti-war movement...

You mention that another group
“under the direction of" the American
Friends Service Committee was plan-
ning a rally for the same day we want-
ed, International Women's Day. You
don't mention that the AFSC coordinated
what was really a very diverse
group of organizations—including the
American Indian Movement, the ACLU,
the Socialist Workers Party, Commun-
ist groups, NOW, the Kwanzaa Coalition,
etc., etc., etc.

You mention that we (meaning those
of us who later called ourselves
Women Say No) decided to present our
points of unity to the AFSC, which
later "refused to read" them. This
is not true. The points of unity
Women Say No developed (as much for
ourselves as anyone else) were never
presented to the larger group plan-
ning the rally. Nobody else's points
of unity were presented either. The
only requirement for participating in
the rally was opposition to the draft.
We weren't acting as a coalition—in
the sense of a group that argues
positions and comes out with some
sort of unified position.

It's also untrue that the AFSC
(or anybody out of the dozen or so
groups representatives attending
planning meetings) refused to consid-
er having all women speakers at the
rally. We never demanded that. Al-
though we originally talked about
doing so, we later decided to request
that at least half of the speakers be
women.

Pat Lowther

Dear BMR:

You've probably been flooded with
responses, but just in case:

Pat Lowther was a Canadian poet
who was murdered in September 1975.

I don't think her murderer has ever
been found although I believe police
held her husband for questioning for
a short time. She was found dead in
the woods in a remote area. There
were reports that she was quite fear-
ful before her death, as though she
knew something.

One of her books of poetry, A Stone
Diary, was published in 1977 by
Oxford University Press, Toronto.
According to the book cover, she had
had three other books of poetry pub-
lished by small presses.

Sincerely,
Sondra Corry
Sherbrooke, Quebec

In fact, yours was the only response
that we received about Pat Lowther.
Thank you so much for the information.

Incarcerated Lesbians

Dear BMR,

I am interested in finding out how
and why lesbians are admitted to
mental institutions. Do they admit
themselves or are they referred by
a doctor on the basis that they are
lesbians, which is supposedly not
to happen but I feel still takes
place?

I would very much appreciate any
response from interested readers.

Thanks,
M. Horgan
