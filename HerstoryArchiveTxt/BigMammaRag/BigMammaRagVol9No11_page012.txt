Cleaning  

(Reprinted from Connexions)  

It is a frightening junc-  
ture in history for immi-  
grant women in Britain. Over  
the last 35 years they have  

race and class. But because  
they have to confront these  
three oppressions, as well  
as exploitation, they have  
to think of concrete ways of  
fighting it, and their organ-  

Sex, race, class oppression  

come searching for work and  
decent wages; they have step-  
ped off planes hoping for a  
better life less burdened by  
hardship, not only for them-  
selves but for their child-  
ren and the families they  
left behind. Called "sett-  
lers" or “patrials", these  
women come from former  
British colonies like Pakis-  
tan and Kenya, territories  
like Hong Kong, and such  
poverty-stricken nations as  
the Philippines. While pro-  
viding the hands and backs  
for the labor no one else  
will do, they find themselves  
feared and reviled for their  
dark skin, their accents and  
the threat they pose to the  
“purity of the British way of  
life".  

Discrimination and racism  
in Britain permeate the state  
and its laws. Since Britain  
has no written constitution  
or bill of rights, laws can  
be arbitrarily and selective-  
ly imposed. For example, the  
Vagrancy Act of 1824, known  
as "sus" for suspicion, makes  
it a crime to "loiter with  
intent to commit an arrest-  
able offense," and is ap-  
plied by the police when they  
deem someone is behaving  
"suspiciously"--jostling a  
pedestrian on the street or  
carrying property one cannot  
prove is one's own. "Sus"  
laws, harassment and brutal-  
ity by the police, and acute  
youth unemployment have been  
the immediate and most ob-  
vious catalysts for the re-  
cent explosion of fury in  
England's ghettos. But ra-  
cism, which has worked it-  
self into nearly every facet  
of life, is the bitter issue  
that remains even after the  
embers have cooled. For  
black and Asian women it is  
a harsh and pressing real-  
ity. In the words of a com-  
munity activist: "Black wom-  
en face all kinds of oppres-  
sion; the phrase ‘triple  
oppression’ has become almost  
trite, but it's true: sex,

izations have to come to  
grips with all those exper-  
iences, all those histories  
together."  

Immigration is the other  
half of Britain's legacy of  
colonialism. While depleting  
the colonies of their natur-  
al resources and thereby de-  
stroying the indigenous  
economies, the unemployed  
have been left with little  
alternative but to migrate  
to Britain in search of work.  
This army of unemployed has  
provided Britain with an  
endless supply of unorganized  
workers to fill the lowest  
status jobs. From the ear-  
liest days, women have borne  
more than their share of the  
injustices and miseries of  
that legacy.  

After World War II,  
Britain's expanding economy  
brought about a surge in de-  
velopment that drew English  
workers into offices and  
factories, creating a 20-  
year period of high employ-  
ment. Labor shortages soon  
became a serious problem,  
especially in the rapidly  
growing service sector which  
was suddenly incapable of  
luring British workers into  
its ranks because of low  
pay, unsocial hours and of-  
ten unpleasant working con-  
ditions.  

To fill the gaps, the  
government recruited more  
than 200,000 East Europeans.  
Over a third of the immi-  
grants were women. Despite  
this massive influx of la-  
bor, the need for workers  
in transportation, hotels,  
hospitals, laundries, restau-  
rants and domestic service  
continued. Employers, among  
them British Transport and  
the British Hotels and Res-  
taurant Association, began  
establishing their own re-  
cruitment offices in Ja-  
maica, India and other Com-  
monwealth countries. West  
Indians began migrating to  
Britain in greater numbers,  
reaching an annual rate of  

30,000 people in 1955. In-  
dians and Pakistanis started  
arriving in the early 1960s  
along with Spaniards and  
Asian East Africans from  
Kenya and Uganda. Since a  
large share of the jobs fell  
into the category of "wom-  
en's work," recruiters in-  
creasingly turned to the  
large, accessible female  
work force abroad.  

At the same time there  
was a fear of being "swamped"  
by people of other cultures.  
In 1962, the government in-  
stituted a voucher system  
under the Commonwealth Immi-  
gration Act which set up  
entry quotas and reduced the  
number of immigrants from  
former colonies from 39,000  
a year in 1962 to 3,000 a  
year just a decade later.  
Racism rather than economics  
precipitated initial immigra-  
tion restrictions. Britain  
suddenly came to fear the  
people it had twice betrayed  
--first in the colonies, then  
in the seat of the empire  
itself.  

With industry faltering  
and unemployment rising, ad-  
ditional legislation came on  
the books in 1968 restricting  
entry of Asian East  
Africans who were right-  
fully laying claim to Brit-  
ish citizenship following  
the independence of their  
homelands, Kenya and Uganda.  
The mechanism of control  
over immigration from third  
world colonies and depend-  
ent territories was well-  
oiled by 1970, already  
thousands of blacks and  
Asians had been turned away.  

Lena and Parita, two wom-  
en active in Brent Action  
Against State Racism, ex-  
plained in a recent inter-  
view: "...as far as most  
black people are concerned,  
there has been a steady  
growth in state racism...  
There has been a steady in-  
terlinking and build-up of  
controls: immigration con-  
trol; plus stopping people  
at the point of entry; plus  
control over people who are  
settled here. They are being  
harassed not just by wel-  
fare agencies but even by  
traffic control...What  
black people face as indi-  
viduals, and understand only  
too well, is state racism-  
even if they don't call it  
by that name."

who will provide you with  
clothing and other personal  
necessities and reimburse

penses, including air fare.  
All for only $2,000. Just  
sign here."  

In the 1960s, employment  
agencies, with their scen-  
arios of paradise, moved  
from the Commonwealth and  
Common Market countries to  
dip into the reservoirs of  
cheap labor that bore no  
direct claim on Britain and  
the welfare state. Work per-  
mits issued during this  
period were mostly for dom-  
estic employment, especially  
for the thriving hotel and  
restaurant industries which  
traditionally employed a  
higher proportion of for-  
eigners, particularly for-  
eign women.  

The enticing wages and  
working conditions agents  
promised drew many women  
from the Philippines, where  
a teacher only earns $100 a  
month. Colombian and Peru-  
vian women were packed off  
with tourist visas expecting  
to find and be eligible for  
work. But without permits  
they discovered they could  
only legally be employed as  
au pairs (meaning "without  
salary"). After borrowing  
air fare at exorbitant in-  
terest rates from their  
agencies, the women soon  
found themselves unable to  
pay back the loans. Many  
have been forced to work il-  
legally in hotels and res-  
taurants or are driven into  
prostitution. By 1971, half  
a million women had reached  
Britain's shores, in most  
cases enlisted to clean up  
after the British.  

Language barriers, ignor-  
ance of work permit regula-  
tions or immigration re-  
strictions and economic des-  
peration make these women  
the easy prey of unscrupu-  
lous, even extortionate  
practices. Women migrating  
to Britain have often found  
themselves completely at the  
mercy of agents. "When we ar-  
rived at Manchester Airport  
we were met by Mr. G. from  
the E. Employment Agency.  
He gave us contracts to  
sign, but he didn't give us  
a chance to read them. He

also charged us $56 each just  
for taking us from the air-  
port to Burton or Trent."  
Agencies, believed to average  
$600 on each body sent  
abroad, reveal none of the  
perils and none of the hard-  
ships of migration.  

With the support of com-  
munity organizations, unions,  
the London-based Migrant Ac-  
tion Group and others, women  
have brought widespread pub-  
licity to the business prac-  
tices of agencies and em-  
ployers who contract from  
them. In some cases it has  
led to crackdowns on the  
labor trade, despite govern-  
mental indifference to the  
plight of immigrants. Some  
women have taken their pro-  
test even further by suing  
employers as well as agencies  
for breach of contract. But  
many women fear the conse-  
quences of going to court or  
taking any official action  
because of the threat of  
deportation. The pressure  
from families back home who  
depend on the money from a-  
broad is an even more power-  
ful constraint on these wom-  
en who fear not only for  
themselves but for the live-  
lihood of those they left  
behind.  

The advantages of immi-  
grant trade for Britain are  
obvious, but emigration also  
benefits countries like the  
Philippines where 35 to 40%  
of the population is unem-  
ployed or underemployed.  
There, emigration is not only  
accepted but encouraged. Sim-  
ilarly, in Colombia, 12% of  
the potential work force in  
the seven largest cities is  
unemployed, while an added  
10% is underemployed. Ignor-  
ing the dubious practices  
of employment agents means  
these countries are quickly  
relieved of thousands of un-  
employed and poor who govern-  
ment officials feel represent  
a national time bomb.  

In addition to defusing  
discontent, emigration helps  
alleviate the staggering for-  
eign debt of third world coun-  
tries since workers send mil-  
lions of dollars in foreign  
currency back home every year.  
In 1978, income from the earn-  
ings of Filipinos working a-  
broad was second only to reve-  
nues from coconut oil, the  
country's number one export.  
To ensure this inflow of cap-  

ital, the Philippine govern-  
ment has in the past issued  
work permits binding foreign  
employers "to assist the  
worker in making remittances  
from his/her salary to his/  
her own bank account in the  
Philippines" to equal no less  
than 30% of the worker's sal-  
ary!  

Because of their extreme  
isolation and the difficulty  
in attracting public attention  
to their plight, au pairs and  
homeworkers are perhaps the  
most vulnerable of immigrant  
women. According to the Nat-  
ional Homeworking Campaign,  
there are an estimated quar-  
ter million homeworkers in  
Britain, a majority of whom  
are Asian immigrants. The ad-  
vantages they present to em-  
ployers are significant.  
Homeworkers mean extraordinar-  
ily cheap labor requiring no  
overhead, no contracts and  
complete freedom from unions.  
Cut off from other workers,  
burdened all the while by dom-  
estic chores, they also re-  
present a docile but indust-  
rious work force.  

Moslem immigrant women are  
particularly exploited because  
they are bound by culture to  
the home, forbidden by trad-  
ition as well as husbands to  
obtain any form of work that  
might interfere with their  

-Glenda Jones  

just because the work is so  
exploitative, but because it  
serves to reinforce the very  
problems Pakistani women have  
in adjusting to their new life  
in this country."  

In a similar vein, the  
status of au pair carries no  
legal protection, being term-  
ed a "cultural" exchange ra-  
ther than the truly economic  
one that it is. A Home Office  
leaflet, recommending guide-  
lines on the relationship of  
au pairs to the families with  
whom they are employed, states  
that au pairs come “primarily  
to learn English and to live  
as a member of an English  
family." They are to receive  
“pocket money and undertake  
light housework and childcare  
on a partnership basis.  

Yet the average pay re-  
ceived by women in private  
service in 1977 was only eight  
pounds a week. Many of the  
25,000 au pairs work a 60-hour  
week and over half are employ-  
ed more than the 30 hours re-  

commended by the Home Office.  
Women brought to Britain under  
false pretenses - finding the  
jobs promised them nonexis-  
tant or that their visitors’  
visas exclude them from em-  
ployment - often have no al-  
ternative but to accept work  
as au pairs. Without air fare,  
the choice to return home is  
not even theirs.  

The hardships these women  
experience are often intensi-  
fied by their youth and the  
fact that they are alone and  
strangers to British society.  
In 1977, a quarter of all au  
pairs changed families. Those  
who did so without the appro-  
val of the Department of Em-  
ployment are, if discovered,  
subject to deportation, re-  
gardless of the conditions  
that made them leave.  

Many thousands of women  
brought into the country by  
British and overseas agencies  
are discovering, often years  
after their arrival, that the  
conditions under which they  
entered Britain were and still  
are illegal. Last year 200  
Filipinas, who had applied to  
have their children join them,  
faced shocking news: rather  
than granting them permission  
to be reunited with their  
families, the Home Office in-  
formed the women they were  
due to be deported as “illeg-  
al entrants." Most of the wo-  
men had work permits for jobs  
as resident domestics which  
stipulated that the holder be  
single or have no dependent  
children under 16.  

Officials have admitted  
that the regulations against  
children were originally in-  
tended to prevent women, who  
as resident domestics were  
required to reside in accom-  
modations provided by their  
employers, from bringing de-  
pendents into inadequate live-  
ing quarters. It was not in-  
tended as a measure to con-  
trol immigration. But now,  
suddenly, with the economy  
floundering and racist hys-  
teria mounting, the Home Of-  
fice has expediently reinter-  
preted the intent of the stip-  
ulation and is applying it  
retroactively.  

The women under attack have  
stated that the agencies ne-  
ver informed them of this  
policy. In many cases, where  
the existence of children was  
made known, the agencies doc-
