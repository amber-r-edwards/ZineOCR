Doris Raven Darkwing Foster
Nuketa
Leah Ansara, is a Native
American woman who has been
in prison for 32 months, 22

of which she has spent on
death row in Jessup, Maryland
Prison. She was convicted of
the 1981 murder of Josephine
Dietrich; her husband Tommy Foster confessed
to in both oral and written
statements to the court. He
confessed how he stabbed
Josephine Dietrich and then
he and Elizabeth Phillips
disposed of her body and
robbed the dead woman's apartment
to provide a cover. At a lat-
er time he retracted the
confession and implicated

Raven again. The confessions
were not allowed to be heard
by the jury and Elizabeth
Phillips was given immunity
from prosecution. Tommy Fos-
ter in a plea bargaining
deal with the district att-
orney is doing 12 years in a
psychiatric institution or
whenever they determine he
is well, (whichever comes
first).

Additional statements by a
friend of the murdered woman
were heard in the judge's
chambers but were not allow-
ed as testimony in court.
She stated that Josephine
Dietrich told her that "Tom-
my Foster had threatened to
kill her." The public defen-
der got the judge to approve
her words to be said in his
chambers--therefore the
words were in Raven's tran-

script for the Appeals Court.
The Maryland Court of Appeals

overturned Raven's 1st con-
viction in June of 1983 be-
cause hearsay testimony that
would have implicated Tommy

the murder her hus-

ruled
the trial

Foster was incorrectly
inadmissible by
judge

In setting up
trial attem
the Attorney
lay the trial for
months, because

more time to prepare

case against the
judge that convicted her the
1st time--Judge Cole--is
still set to be the trial
attending judge.

In a statement from Amanda
Bull, Raven's public defend-
er: the 2nd jury trial took
place on Feb. 21, 1984. "Doris
Ann Foster received the ver-
dict of being guilty of a
felony murder. However it has
not been established that Ms.
Foster did indeed stab Ms.
Dietrich. This fact will
have to be litigated on the
date of sentencing, which
has not, at this time, been
scheduled."

According to U.S. propagan-

No More Cages

da a "person is innocent un-
til proven guilty." But the
U.S. criminal injustice sys-
tem doesn't really work that
way. Countless people spend
months and years in jail for
"crimes" that have not yet
gone to trial, or as in
Raven's case she spent months
in jail on a conviction that
was overturned...More time in
jail waiting for a retrial--
found guilty--and yet the
actual crime--the murder--

is still "under litigation."
Maintaining imperialism, ra-
cism, classism & sexism...
maintaining control of the
working class and all
oppressed peoples is the true
role/purpose of our "legal
system." The injustice sys-
tem purposefully tries to in-
timidate, dehumanize and tor-
ture people into submission,
to accept their "punishment"
at the hands of the court.
Raven's case is no exception
and it is important that we

work to overthrow the Sys-
tem, to work towards
release.

west Passage.)

Paula Three Stars, a 30-
year-old Oglala Sioux woman,
was charged with first-
degree murder for the shoot-
ing of her common-law hus-
band of six and a half
years, Daniel B. (Sonny)
Evening, Jr., during a
battering episode on March
12, 1984.

Paula suffered physical
abuse from Sonny throughout
their relationship. Sonny
was a heavy user of both
alcohol and other drugs.

When Sonny was in an abusive
mood, Paula would try to
hide herself in the house
and garage but gradually
Sonny discovered all her
hiding spots, according to
an acquaintance of Paula's.

Paula called the police
for help during one of the
battering episodes but was
told there was "nothing they
could do." Realizing the
police would not respond to
a domestic dispute, Paula
called again and reported
a robbery. The police res-
ponded immediately, but in-
stead of arresting Sonny,
they arrested Paula for
making a false report. In-
stead of being taken to a
shelter, she was taken to
jail.

A week before the shoot-
ing, Paula sought refuge
with a neighbor after her
husband had taken a shot
at her. Paula, fearing for
her life, shot Sonny during
a battering episode on the
night of March 12.

Paula Three Stars, a
mother of two, former ex-
ecutive secretary of a
Northwest Indian Health
Board and former nurse's
aide, has the support of
her family, community, NOW,
the Equal Defense Alliance
(EDA), the Northwest Indian
Women's Circle, Leonard
Peltier Defense Committee
and Women of All Red Na-
tions (San Francisco). The
EDA, founded in 1980, is
based on the premise of the
basic right for a woman to
act in self-defense.

A week before
trial was to begin, she
accepted a plea bargaining
offer from the prosecutor.
She pleaded guilty to first-
degree manslaughter, a
lesser crime. The prosecu-
tor is recommending proba-
tion.

In a statement following
her decision, Paula said
that she is innocent and
had acted in self-defense.
She accepted the plea bar-
gain since she didn't be-
lieve she would receive a
fair trial due to her sex
and race. This ordeal has
made Paula "more aware that
I wasn't the only one (bat-
tered woman). It makes me
sad to know that I wasn’t
the only one - it's a hell
of a comfort - but it has
really snapped my eyes open.
I'm determined that if I
can ever help someone in
that situation, I sure
will."

Paula's sentencing hear-

ing will take place April

13 in the Snohomish County
Superior Court, Washington.
Supporters are encouraged

to attend the hearing and

to write letters to Judge
Hanson asking him to give
probation, not a prison
term, to Paula. Letters

can be sent to Paula's de-
fense attorney: Mr. Al Lyon,
Public Defenders Office,
Snohomish County Courthouse,
Everett, WA 98201. Donations
of money are also needed.

Stars Defense Committee,
