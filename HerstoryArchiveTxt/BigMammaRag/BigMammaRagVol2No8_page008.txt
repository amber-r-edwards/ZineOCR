Interview. «<<

MARTIN/LYON

Metivists, Authors, Lesbian

Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin are probably the first two women you
ever hear about in terms of national exposure about being Lesbians.
In 1955 they started one of the first organizations in the country for
Lesbians and they have been active ever since, first with the Civil
Rights Movement, then with Gay Liberation, and now they are work
ing primarily within the Women's Movement. Sometimes referred to

affectionately as the “Mothers of Lesbian Liberation,”
they recently published a book called Lesbian/Woman, 
which focuses on women and Lesbian

proud activism.
Denver on April 5 to do a
presentation at the University of Denver Center and it was
Big Mama Rag (with Janet Sergi) and 
others who “picked their brains”

about the experiences of being both

Lesbian and mothers.

They were in
engagement at Colorado University
to discuss that several women from

the Daughters of Bilitis, the recently-formed San Francisco
Lesbian Mothers Union and anything else we could think of.

Although they provided us with a wealth of
information, we only were able to reprint a portion of
that interview here. The following are excerpts:

Choc: Do you see the Women's
Movement as just a civil rights
movement, or do you see it as a
lot more than that?

Phyllis: I think it’s both. The
Women’s Movement is running
on a lot of different levels so you
have women doing things from a
lot of different levels of con-
sciousness. NOW has primarily
aimed at civil rights, but there’s a
lot of awareness among NOW
women that they also need to
deal in terms of what's going to
happen in the future — what
kind of society do we want — and
what in the hell are we talking
about when we talk about
revolution.

Del: What kind of a society do we
want to live in? We may think in
terms of what could happen in
the next 5 or 10 years, but we
have to go way beyond that. We
think it is very necessary for
there to be some women’s think
tanks where different women
from various groups really get
together and start thinking about
the future and what is it we want
in this society. So we would like
to see Feminists rally all over the
country doing this sort of thing.
And then maybe getting
together later to see what all
we've come up with, you know,
sort of brainstorming.

Phyllis: There are a lot of women
who have decided maybe
socialism or Marxism or
whatever “ism” is the answer,
but it doesn't necessarily seem
to me in view of what we've seen
of socialist societies that that’s
really the answer for women and
gay people anyhow. I have not
seen any societies evolving
around the world that I would be
comfortable living in in terms of
being a woman and being a gay
person.

Del: Not only that. At least in this
society we know who the enemy
is, we know what we're dealing
with. Some of these other con-
cepts — like a socialist govern-
ment — would just change the
name of my oppressor and I
wouldn't have the advantage of
at least knowing the structure
and knowing the society I'm
dealing with. You talk about
revolution — you turn things up-
side down — but the way I see it
now, certainly gay people would
still be oppressed.

Phyllis: You don’t want to turn it
around so that we still end up on
the bottom.

Choc: Do you think that all
women are, or should be,
Lesbians, in order for a real
women's revolution to take
place?

Del: Speaking personally, I'm
certainly not a Separatist. I don’t
see how you can do away with
half the population of the world. I
also wouldn’t want to live in just
a gay society. I'm really in-
terested in all human beings. I
think there needs to be a lot of
consciousness-raising...a lot of
changes in society. Every in-
stitution needs to be turned up-
side down. Some women who
want to separate out — who
don't even want to have their boy
children — this is counter-
revolutionary. I think I’m too
much of a humanist to buy all
that.

Phyllis: Yeah, I'd agree with that.
As far as all women being
Lesbians, I think certainly all
women have that potential. Or
even more broadly, all people
really have the capacity to relate
to both sexes — on a sexual
basis. A lot of switching is
happening within the Feminist
movement. A lot of women are
becoming aware of either their
own inherent Lesbianism that
they weren't aware of, or were
afraid to face. Or simply that it’s
a lot easier to deal with women
nowadays than it is to deal with
men. I've never quite been able
to understand why everybody
freaks out — all the heterosex-
uals seem to think somehow or
other that if we loosen up the
laws on homosexuality,
everybody is going to turn gay.
I've really always had a little
more faith in heterosexuality
than that — than they seem to
have.

Janet: What do you think about
the concept of a woman's
culture? The Women’s Move-
ment is not just a civil rights
movement and it’s not exactly a
humanist movement. At this
time in history, we have to focus
on women and the concept of a
woman’s culture with woman’s
art, philosophy, critiques of the
male-dominated culture. What
are your views on that aspect of
Feminism?

Phyllis: I think it’s really exciting
— the kinds of things that are
happening. I think that a
woman's culture is not
necessarily being developed —
it's being dredged up out of
where it’s been. It isn’t as if we
haven't ever had a women’s
culture — it’s been suppressed,
repressed, never discussed,
nobody knew about it. Now it’s
being pulled together so that
more and more women are
becoming aware of the
capacities of women to create.
Marge: I understand you are the
co-founders of the Lesbian
Mothers Union, or helped to
found it. What is this organiza-
tion, what is it all about?

Del: The Lesbian Mothers Union
grew out of the Gay Women's
West Coast Conference in 1971.
At this point I threw out the idea
that there were Lesbian mothers
and that their issues were not
being dealt with either in the gay
movement or in the Women’s
Movement. All of a sudden we
had a bunch of women deman-
ding a workshop and also
questioning why we didn’t have
child care there. Nobody ever
thought in terms of having child
care at a Lesbian conference
because of literature that’s been
handed down by the
professionals who talk about
sexual behavior rather than the
whole person — who might be a
gay person even though there
are lots of women who are ac-
ting out heterosexual roles.
We've been following all the
different custody cases and
helping and supporting women
who have custody cases going.
Then we also have rap sessions
where women can discuss some
of the problems they have with
their children, with their
neighbors, within the family —
how do you tell your kids? Are
you open in front of the kids?...
They also have socials where
they get their families together
because they think it is impor-
tant for the children to have
peers who are in the same
situations...
Marge: You said earlier you con-
sider Lesbianism to be the
backbone of the Women’s Move-
ment. Why do you think that?

Phyllis: There’s just so many of
us in it and we all seem to be do-
ing a lot of work. And we don't
have to ask our husbands if it’s
all right for us to go to the NOW
meeting or whatever meeting.
We're free to get involved. DOB
(Daughters of Bilitis — the first
Lesbian organization in the U.S.
—Ed.) was essentially a
women's rights organization
from the beginning. It didn’t real-
ly quite know that’s what it was,
but a lot of the things DOB was
saying in the late 50’s and 60's
are the same kinds of things that
the Women’s Movement is say-
ing now. Since Del got on the
national board of NOW, we dis-
covered there are all these gay
sisters who are presidents of
NOW chapters and who are very
involved on this level or that
level. And more and more all the
time are coming out and being
open about it. There's just really
no question that a lot of the work
and a lot of the creativity and a
lot of the blood, sweat and tears
in the Women’s Movement has
come from gay women, mostly
gay women in the closet until
fairly recently.

Phyllis Lyon

Choc: You've been working with
Lesbians for a number of years. I
wonder if you could tell us of
some of the changes you've
seen. How would you compare,
say, working with Lesbians in
1974 to working with Lesbians
when you first started
Daughters of Bilitis?

Del: In the first place, it's Bilitis
(Bilitis)...

Choc: I never did know how to
pronounce that.

Del: Bilitis makes it sound like
tonsillitis and a disease, and
we're trying to get away from
the disease concept. There’s just
been tremendous changes.
When we first came out so to
speak, everybody was into the
whole butch-femme trip. You
found that that was the way you
had to act in order to be accepted
by your peers, and of course,
everybody's looking for a support
group. So we got into the role-
playing in the beginning. Except I
had a problem playing the butch
role — I was a pretty sissy butch.
I remember there were eight of
us who'd started DOB — four
couples, and there was one
other couple that the butch
didn’t seem so butchy either so
she and I became buddies. We
began to get into more discus-
sion and we decided we should
be developing our own ways of
relating instead of imitating the
only relationships we'd had as a
model — the heterosexual one.
We would have to really start to
think in terms of how best we
could work out our own
relationships and not do this im-
itation thing. As we delved into
that we began to realize then the
whole thing about sex roles —
what are called masculine and
feminine are indeed human
traits and that we all have these
varying traits to varying degrees
and that what society had been
handing down was really a
cultural thing because in other
cultures the role could be reversed.

Marge: I'd like to play the devil's
advocate for a few minutes
because in doing panels, es-
pecially in high schools, one of
the most sensitive areas is that
of gay parents and the children
in that situation.

Phyllis: That is a problem. Any
child growing up in any kind of
“deviant” family, whether it’s
hippy, divorced, poor, rich, if
they're different than their peer
group, they're going to have
some kind of trouble with their
peers. I almost died the first time
I had to go to school wearing
glasses. Everybody knew boys
never make passes at girls who
wear glasses. In those days that
was the feeling. So you cannot
protect kids from what's gonna
happen in the outside world. But
that's not a reason not to be open
and honest with your kids. You
can't raise your kids and never
tell them you're a Lesbian —
they'll have all these strange
feelings about what's going on
with their mother and who are
these strange women that come
in and you never see any kind of
affection, they never know about
love between adults. That seems
to me to be a lot worse than
somebody yelling on the
playground, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah
your mother’s a Lesbian,” or
something like that. If you give
the child the support within the
home so that the child un-
derstands the whole situation
and understands why the kids
are going to yell that, it's not a
pleasant thing for them, but they
can certainly deal with the other
kids, deal with a hell of a lot. And
I think they can deal with that kind
of thing a lot better than with
growing up in an anti-affection
home or in a home where they
always know there’s something
there that they can’t quite put
their finger on. And where the
mother’s miserable. It's like kids
that grow up in families where
the parents stay together for the
sake of the children, the kids
always know there's something
wrong. Kids are very perceptive.
Marge: You mentioned that in
addition to your book
Lesbian/Woman that you have
two other publications?

Phyllis: We've done a little
booklet through the National Sex
Forum called Lesbian Love and
Liberation, which is illustrated
with photographs of gay women.
And we're also working on a
book called Lesbian/Mother,
but we haven't started writing it
yet.
