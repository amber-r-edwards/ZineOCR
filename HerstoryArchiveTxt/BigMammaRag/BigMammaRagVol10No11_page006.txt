More Sterilization

A recent study of Puerto  
Rican women in Hartford, CT,  
found that over half of the  
women interviewed in a random  
sample had been sterilized.  
This rate is even higher than  
the alarming rate on the is-  
land of Puerto Rico, which has  
the highest sterilization rate  
for any country in the world.  
The majority of the locally  
performed operations were done  
at Hartford Hospital, an in-  
stitution in the heart of the  
Puerto Rican community, which  
has only two Latin doctors and  
few Latin people on its pro-  
fessional and para-professional  
staff. Many of the women sur-  
veyed indicated that, although  
they did not read English, they  
were given English consent  
forms to sign authorizing the  
operation. Over half said that  
they were not adequately in-  
formed about the implications  
of the operation performed on  
them. Many women reported that  
they were pushed into it by  
poverty, a lack of social ser-  
vices, and the severe housing  
crisis in the Puerto Rican  
community.

Class Action Suit

Four teen-age girls have  
filed a class action suit a-  
gainst officials of Colorado  
State Hospital and other off-  
icials, claiming the state's  
"voluntary" commitment law  
for youths is unconstitutional.  
People under the age of 18  
can be "voluntarily" committed  
to the Colorado State Hospital  
at Pueblo on the signature of  
their guardian. The four teen-  
agers were committed to the  
hospital by their guardians,  
three of whom were county  
social service department  
caseworkers. The suit asks  
for an injunction preventing  
such "voluntary" commitments  
in the future and $2,000 dam-  
ages for each member of the  
class.

Charges Dropped

Manslaughter charges against  
Lori Ann Newman (see November  
BMR) were dropped after a de-  
tective's affidavit supported  
her claim that she shot in  
self-defense when she killed  
a man who was breaking into  
her house - a man who had  
broken into her house before  
and had raped her.

Women Need Less

Japan is the only country  
which discriminates between  
the sexes in livelihood assis-  
tance allowances, based on the  
dubious statistics that women  
have less caloric requirements  
than men to survive.

Meltdown Potential

In a study of 19,400 "ev-  
ents" at nuclear power plants  
from 1969-79, Critical Mass  
Energy Project found 169 could  
have led to core meltdowns.  
The NRC says actually only 52  
had meltdown potential.

Sweatless Slimming

New-age weight-loss salons  
are selling sweatless slim-  
ming. For a mere $25, custo-  
mers have the privilege of  
lying on a couch for 45 min-  
utes while electrodes taped to  
"hanging bellies, deflated  
derrieres, and pooped-out  
pecs" emit thousands of tiny  
Billed as "the civil-  
ized way to streamline your  
body," the technique is sup-  
posed to trim and tone muscles  
by forcing them to contract  
spasmodically. Salon owners  
claim that each session yields  
the same results as 1,500 sit-  
ups. The FDA calls this claim  
“fraudulent,” arguing that  
these minishock treatments are  
neither safe nor effective.

Jesus And Video

The Reverend A.K. Horton of  
Brookville, Ohio, “trying to  

generate some excitement in  
our kids and also attract some  
new members," announced that  
his church would give away a  
Pac-Man home video game.

Gays Outlawed

The Iranian Majlis (parlia-  
ment) has officially outlawed  
a list of moral offences in-  
cluding sensual kissing, homo-  
sexuality and drinking alcohol.  
Under the new law passed in  
mid-September, first offenders  
can receive 100 lashes, with  
stricter punishment for repeat  
offenders. Tehran newspapers  
reported that persistent homo-  
sexuality will be punishable  
by execution.

Kiko Not Guilty

Francisco "Kiko" Martinez,  
a Chicano lawyer and activist,  
was found not guilty on Nov.  
20th of charges of possessing  
and mailing explosives. He  
was accused of mailing letter  
bombs to 2 Denver cops and a  
store owner in 1973, and had  
fled the country in fear for  
his life when he heard he was  
wanted on those charges. He  
was arrested when attempting  
to re-enter the U.S. at the  
Mexican border in 1980. At  
first a mistrial was called  
because of conspiracy between  
the judge and the FBI. He was  
again tried in federal court  
and found not guilty by a  
jury of 8 women and 4 men.  
This is a victory for the  
Chicano struggle and for all  
progressive people.

Activists Released

Maggie Bozeman and Julia  
Wilder were recently released  
on parole from Alabama state  
prison after serving nine  
months on framed-up charges  

of "vote fraud." (see story  
in March, '82, BMR)  
CDP Is Attacked

On November 15, the Comite  
de Defensa Popular in Chihua-  
hua City, Chihuahua, Mexico,  
was attacked by government  
forces at a demonstration.  
Hundreds were arrested and  
two of the leadership, Sigala  
and Aquilar were severely  
beaten and their whereabouts  
are not known. Another demon-  
stration in Delicias, Chihua-  
hua, also organized by the  
CDP, was attacked with hun-  
dreds arrested. The CDP is one  
of Mexico's leading revolu-  
tionary organizations with  
over 300,000 people, organi-  
zing over 40 land takeovers  
in the state of Chihuahua.

The colonias in Delicias  
and Guadelupe Victoria have  
been repeatedly surrounded  
by the army, reportedly search-  
ing for weapons, holding peo-  

ple temporarily and beating  

them.

People should write the  
president of Mexico demanding  
the repression and attacks be  
stopped as well as Sigala and  
Aquilar be presented. Write:

Miguel de la Madrid  
Palacio Presidencial  
Mexico, D.F., MEXICO

Also call your local Mexican  
consulate demanding the same -  
the Denver # is 832-2621.
