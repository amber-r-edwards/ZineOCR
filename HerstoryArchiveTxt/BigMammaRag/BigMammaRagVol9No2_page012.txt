FDA Imposes New Controls On Cervical Cap Use

Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
regulations instituted this month
will limit women's access to what may
be one of the safest, easiest and
most effective methods of birth con-
trol.

Feminist health activists are be-
coming involved in controversy con-
cerning the cervical cap, a small de-
vice which fits tightly over the cer-
vix, and like the diaphragm, places a
physical barrier between sperm and
uterus.

The new regulations supposedly are
aimed at tightening up rules for test
ing safety and effectiveness of med-
icines and health devices but femin-
ists charged that the rules are a sop
to U.S. drug manufacturers and will
halt the cap's importation from Bri-
tain, where it is manufactured. U.S.
companies, feminists say, are buying
time to develop their own cervical
cap. In addition, health activists
charge, corporations may feel threat-
ened by the widening use of the cap.
The cap is a “low profit" item -be-
cause it requires little or no sperm-
icide, the component of the diaphragm
which makes it profitable.

In the past 18 months, 20,000 caps
have been imported by U.S. clinics
and physicians. The cap appeals to
many women because it calls for the
use of little or no spermicide, and
because it may be kept in place 3-7
days longer than the diaphragm.

The FDA recently classified the
cap as an “investigational device,"
charging that the manufacturer, Lam-
berts Dalston Ltd., has not produced
safety and efficacy data. Beginning
in January, all shipments of the caps
to the U.S. will be seized unless
they are being imported by institut-
ions conducting an FDA-approved stu-
dy. Such institutions must hold an
exemption number issued by the FDA.

The reclassification of the device
has caused an outcry among health cli-
nics already dispensing the cap. "We
agree, there is a need for more modern
data on the cap," said Barbara Seaman,
author of the book Women and The
Crisis in Sex Hormones. “But it is
senseless for the FDA to put restrict
ions on the cap, which is such a be-
nign device, while the Pill and the
IUD are unrestricted." According to
the New Hampshire Feminist Health
Center, one of the first U.S. import-
ers of the cap in 1978, two years of
experience shows it to be 93% effect-
ive.

"The key issue here," notes Marion
Banshaf of the Abortion Rights Move-
ment, "is who is allowed to do re-
search on women's health and what
kind of information is accepted as
valid." As it now stands, all of
the research on the cap is by the
National Institute of Health (NIH).
Health activists fear that even if
women's clinics succeeded in obtain-
ing exemption numbers (allowing them
to dispense the caps), the decision
on the cap's future will be decided
completely from NIH data.

This assumption was confirmed by
Dr. Lillian Yin, head of the FDA's
gynecology and radiological device
unit. Yin said that the data from
women's clinics would be "biased" be-
cause women who go to such clinics
are "highly motivated" and would tend
to use the cap exactly as it theore-
tically should be used. She claimed
that the NIH study would compare the
effectiveness of the cap and the dia-
phragm among a broader spectrum of wo-
men, thus getting actual use effect-
iveness.

No one claims that the cervical
cap is the perfect answer to the fru-
strating question of safe birth con-
trol for women. But feminists be-
lieve that women should be given com-
plete information about the cap and
the freedom to decide for themselves
whether it is the right method to use.

Tampons And Toxic Shock Syndrome

TSS is a severe illness occurring
almost entirely in menstruating women
using tampons. TSS produces a varie-
ty of symptoms:

-sudden onset of a high fever with
vomiting

-diarrhea

-tenderness or pain in the muscles
followed by

-decreases in the blood pressure be-
low normal (hypotension) and in se-
vere cases, shock

-a sunburn-like rash is present dur-
ing the acute phase of the illness
(about the 10th day after onset)

-the skin may shed, particularly on
the palms and soles.

There is a 30% chance of the illness
reoccurring in women who have had TSS
once.

Two common factors have been iso-
lated so far in the women diagnosed
as having TSS:

1. The use of tampons during menstru-
ation
2. A bacterium, Staph Aureus, present
in the vagina

Residents of Denver County, eli-
gible for LEAP benefits (Low Income
Energy Assistance Program) will be
getting their first checks during
the week of January 26th, Armando R.
Atencio, Manager of the Denver Social
Services Department said today.

Approximately 19,000 checks will
be distributed in amounts ranging
from $123.00 to $142.00 for eligible
clients with a monthly income under
$500.00.

Persons interested in applying
for energy assistance can still do
so through Feb. 27, 1981. Any one
month in the period from Nov. 1980
through Feb. 1981 is the eligibility
period. Eligibility is based on the
total gross monthly income and can-
not exceed the following maximum in-
come limits.

J Household Size Max. Monthly Income

1 Person $398
2 Persons $522
3 Persons $648
4 Persons $776
5 Persons $903

(For each additional person add $127)

Applications will continue to be
taken at the Denver Dept. of Social
Services LEAP Unit located at 660
Bannock (telephone 629-7273), or in
any of the established outreach loc-
ations:

Current research is attempting to es-
tablish the relationship between Staph
Aureus and tampons in the occurrence
of TSS. However, other factors under
investigation include:

-a substance called Carboxymethyl-
cellulose (it is not clear if this
is used in the tampon or in the ap-
plicator)

-changes in the material composition
of tampons in the last few years

-the possibility of a new mutation
of Staph A. being involved in TSS.

Staph Aureus is a bacterium common-
ly carried on the skin, in the armpit
and in the nose and is about us all the
time. Many people carry Staph A. and
never know it because their own body
defenses prevent the bacteria from
doing any harm. However, Staph A.
produces toxins (poisons) that it re-
leases into its environment, in this
case, the vagina and/or the tampon.

It is thought that 5-15% of women
have this bacteria present in the va-
gina but it is not known what percent-
age of women have this bacteria pre-
sent during menstruation. Staph A.
may act as a co-factor in TSS in the
following ways:

-Staph A. may be introduced into the
vagina in the process of inserting
the tampon
-Staph A. may already be present in
the vagina and grow in the favor-
able environment provided by the tam-
pon. Once it is growing, it is
producing toxin.
-As yet unstudied physiological
changes during menstruation (a rise
in the pH level of the vagina, hor-
monal secretions) may create a hos-
pitable environment for bacterial
growth.

-Abrasions and ulcerations caused by
the tampon may provide convenient
passageways for the toxin (secreted
by Staph A.) into the bloodstream.
-There is some speculation that the
overuse of antibiotics in recent
years has resulted in a mutation or
stronger strain of Staph A.

Although an increased risk of TSS
was observed with Rely brand tampons,
cases of TSS have been reported with
all tampons introduced by the major
manufacturers.

It could be illegal for employers
to deduct cash register shortages or
losses from wages of protected work-
ers if by doing so the wages fall be-
low the federal minimum wage of $3.10
an hour. Doyle I. Loveridge, Regional
Administrator for Employment Stand-
ards, U.S. Dept. of Labor, in Denver
says both employers and employees a-
like are unaware of the provisions of
the wage and hour laws. Employers
could be in violation of the Fair
Labor Standards Act, if they:

a. Deduct from wages to make up cash
register shortages and losses.

b. Withhold even one cent of a work-
er's pay, if the worker is being
paid $3.10 an hour or less.

c. Pay their employees less than
one-and-a-half times their regular
rate of pay for all hours worked
over 40 in a workweek. (Deductions
for shortages and losses may
not cut into overtime pay.)

d. Require their workers to buy,
launder, or mend their own uni-
forms without compensating the
workers for the money spent in
the activities of uniform mainte-
nance.

e. Deduct money out of an employee's
wages to pay for a required work
uniform,

f. Deduct money out of wages to pay
for replacement of a broken or
lost tool.

g. Deduct money out of wages to make
up for loss on a bad check the
employee took from a customer.

If you have questions or think you
are or have been a victim of unfair
deductions from your paycheck, con-
tact:
