Herstory of

International Women’s Day

Much of the information and
data on the history of March 8th,
International Women’s Day, is
difficult to obtain, as is a lot of
other historical evidence that
discloses the tenacity and mili-
tancy of women. This oblitera-
tion of our story obscures the
basis of our exploitation and how
to eradicate it. To celebrate this
day is to acknowledge our past
and its lessons, our strength in
the future.

The idea for such a day orig-
inally developed from the dis-
pute over women’s suffrage. The
Austrian Social Democrats be-
lieved that the vote for women
could undermine the battle for
male franchise, as in 1907 work-
ing class men were not fran-
chised. Clara Zetkin (1857-1933),
an active and leading socialist,
demanded that the vote be
extended to women. She and many
others, always consistent in
articulating and combating
women’s oppression, raised this
issue at the 1907 Congress of the
Second International in Stuttgart.
Here it was resolved that women
should vote, and that the fight for
suffrage should be in conjunction
with the working class move-
ment and not with bourgeois re-
formists.

In 1911, March 8th was ob-
served in Austria, Denmark,
Germany and Switzerland. The
ensuing events quickly re-
vealed that suffrage wasn't the
only issue! Alexandra Kollontai
(1872-1952), a Bolshevik fem-
inist and member of the Party's
Central Committee, recounted
how “Germany... and Austria
were one seething, trembling
sea of women. Meetings were
organized everywhere. Halls
were packed so full that they had
to ask workers to give up their
places to the women. Men
stayed at home with the child-
ren for a change, and their
wives, the captive housewives,
went to meetings.” In Austria
alone 30,000 women and men
marched and demonstrated in
the streets.

In 1913, Russia also ob-
served March 8th, and Kollontai
was one of the organizers of the
illegal ‘Morning Teach-In On
the Woman Question’. Most of
the organizers were arrested,
but activities in the following
years continued nonetheless.
International Women's Day in
1917 heralded the inception of
the Russian Revolution, as huge
demonstrations manifested
themselves everywhere, and
thousands of women in Petro-
grad demanded bread for their
children and an end to the im-
perialist war.

Women’s Conference Planned

Plans are being made by the
Colorado Women's Con-
ference Committee (CWCC) to
draw together Colorado women
in a state convention next fall.
The committee, brought to-
gether by the Denver Commis-
sion on Community Relations,
includes representatives of
several women’s organizations.

Using the U.S. National
Women’s Agenda as a starting
point, CWCC is planning to get
input from local communities
state-wide as to the priorities of
Colorado women, and thus for-
mulate a state pre-convention
agenda. By making such pre-
paration before the projected
two-day convention it is hoped
that most of the convention can
be spent developing a specific
plan of action to improve condi-
tions for women in Colorado.
Funding is being sought for
the convention under provisions
of recently passed H.R. 8903,
which directs the National
Commission on the Observance
of International Women’s Year
to organize and convene a
National Women’s Conference.
The bill, introduced by Bella
Abzug of New York, and spon-
sored by fifteen Congress-
women (including Pat Schroeder
of Denver), calls for state
conventions, in addition to and
preceding the National Con-
ference, which is to occur before
the end of 1976.

Int'l Tribunal

Big Mama Rag Vol. 4, No. 3

Patriarchal Crime Judged

The International Tribunal on
Crimes Against Women will take
place in Brussels, Belgium,
March 4-8. The aim of the
Tribunal is to raise conscious-
ness internationally about the
oppression women suffer in a
male-dominated world. Under
the slogan “international sister-
hood is more powerful",
organizers hope that for women
to share their awareness of in-
justices the world over will
deepen and strengthen our com-
mitment to each other, and
facilitate activism in those coun-
tries where there is, as yet, no
visible feminist movement.

The format of the Tribunal will
provide for testimony on specific
crimes against women, analy-
sis workshops and solution
workshops. There will also be
media presentations relating to
the issues raised, as well as
parties, poetry readings and
music. The last day will be
devoted to discussions of pro-
posals for actions and solutions.

Broad Perspective

Which crimes are dealt with
will depend on the testimony
each country’s Tribunal
Committee wants to present:
most, however, are expected to
fall into the four broad cate-
gories of sexual crimes, medical
crimes and those relating to
reproduction, legal crimes and
those relating to the family, and
political crimes and those
relating to production.

Tribunal groups or national
contacts had been established in
26 countries at last count, al-
though others were in the
process of forming. The 26 coun-
tries are Australia, Austria, Bel-
gium, Canada, Denmark, Egypt,
England, France, West Ger-
many, Greece, Holland, Iceland,
India, Ireland, Israel, Italy,
Japan, Mexico, Norway, Por-
tugal, Puerto Rico, South Africa,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and
the U.S.A.

These national groups will
collect evidence of crimes
against women in their own
countries, and select and gather
testimony on those they wish to
present at the Tribunal. The U.S.
Committee chose four crimes on
which to present testimony,
based on a year’s work gather-
ing feedback from women
across the country. These are
rape, femicide (the murder of
women and girls because they
are female), the poverty of
women as compared with men,
especially of single mothers and
older women alone, and the op-
pression of women by their
traditional role in the home.
Forced sterilization may be in-
cluded in this list; however, it is
known that the Puerto Rican
delegation will definitely present
testimony on this crime.

There will also be local tri-
bunals across the U.S., one of
them in Denver. To be held
sometime in April, the exact date
and venue have not yet been
determined. Call 831-9094 if
you want to help organize or
participate.

Lesbian Abducted

A member of the Philadelphia
lesbian feminist zap group
DYKETACTICS! was abducted at
gunpoint on January 12 by two
men in broad daylight. The kid-
nappers drugged her and drove
her to Camden where they took
her to an abandoned house and
interrogated her about her sex-
ual identity, activities and the
people whose names they found
on papers in her pockets. They
also warned her that her les-
bian feminist activities “could be
dangerous to your health.” After
her release, she complained to
police in both Camden and in
Philadelphia, but got no re-
sponse except that a routine re-
port was made to the FBI. The
FBI has not contacted the
woman.

National Media Group

Media Women in Action is a
new group to coordinate na-
tional actions about the media. It
is issuing a call for proposals and
actions that can be undertaken
locally and nationally. For infor-
mation, or to submit proposals,

Ridley, Administrator.

“Snuff” Snuffed

Members of the Philadelphia
group DYKETACTICS! forced a
local movie theatre to withdraw
the pornographic movie “Snuff”
after one and a half days (a
three-week schedule had been
planned). “Snuff” depicts the
murder and dismemberment of
women, and it has still not been
revealed whether these crimes
are real or acted. DYKETAC-
TICS! demonstrated outside the
theatre and then ‘stormed’ it,
threatening damage to the
screen and projection room. At
this point the theatre’s man-
agement agreed to negotiate,
and the movie was withdrawn
the following day.

Working Women's Wages

One out of every three adults
in the U.S. is either single, wid-
owed or divorced. Of these, 12.5
million are raising one or more
children, and 90% of these child-
ren are being raised by single
mothers.

More than half of all women
18 to 64 are workers outside the
home. Among all families, about
one out of eight is headed by a
woman; almost three out of ten
black families are headed by
women. And among poor fami-
lies, women are heads of house-
holds in more than two out of
five cases.

Women who completed grade
school earn 55¢ for every $1.00 a
man with a grade school educa-
tion gets, and the same goes for
high school graduates. Four
years of college only brings a
woman's wages up to 60¢ for
every dollar earned by a male
college graduate.
