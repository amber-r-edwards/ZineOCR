“An invitation came to me from a
friend...to visit her at her home on

a ranch. With the added inducement
that land could be procured in west-
ern Nebraska by meeting the condit-
ions of the federal government. I embraced this opportunity..." Thus Clar
issa Griswold described her introduc-
tion to homesteading in Nebraska in
1885. She was one of numerous women
who homesteaded alone in the western
United States during the turn of the
century.

Information about women's ex-
periences is being documented by
Sheryl Patterson-Black, coordinator
of the Women's Studies Department at
the University of Colorado-Boulder.
Patterson-Black became interested in
women homesteaders while conducting
research for a book on homesteading
technology. She found consistent ref-
erences to women who homesteaded sin-
gly or with other women.

In an article in the Summer issue of

these

mer, 1979, Patterson-Black notes
that her research in diaries, letters,
photos, land office records and per-
sonal interviews uncovered some new
information. Preliminary data
from land offices in Lamar, Colorado
and Douglas, Wyoming indicate that
nearly 12 per cent of the sample of
homestead entrants were women. Final
ownership of a land claim could be
obtained with a cash payment after
six months' residence or with full-
time residence for five years. In
Patterson-Black's preliminary sample
group of those who had filed a home-
stead entry, 42.4 per cent of the
women had successfully made final
proof of ownership; only 37 per cent
of the men had done so.

Despite the fact that many women
did farm successfully on the plains,

that her research

Literary works by women authors
convey a fuller view of women's lives
on the prairie. Patterson-Black cites
the writings of Willa Cather and
Sandoz, in particular, for their

presentation of various female char-
acters on the plains frontier. These
characters were often capable and en-
thusiastic homesteaders, as well as
being doctors, mid-wives, madams, etc.
Significantly, both Cather and Sandoz
had lived on the Great Plains at some
time and their characters were based
on real people.

The Little Known Lives of Early Women Homesteaders

of homesteading women's experiences,
Patterson-Black discovered that women
filled a multitude of roles, both
traditional and non-traditional,
in prairie culture. They paid for
their land claims by teaching school,
freighting, selling milk and eggs,
sewing, and running shops. They were
sometimes active in politics. It was
Mary E. Lease, a Farmers’ Alliance
activist who was credited with the
famous statement, "What you farmers
need is to raise less corn and more
hell." Along with other duties, many
women homesteaders raised large fam-
ilies alone.

Even keeping house was quite a
challenge on the prairie. It involved
using buffalo chips for fuel and
keeping grass from growing in the sod
floor under the furniture. Mrs. H.C.
Stuckey is quoted as saying, "Sometimes
the water would drip on the stove while I was cooking, and I would have to keep tight lids on the skillets to prevent the mud from falling into the food. With my dress pinned up, and rubbers on my feet, I waded until the clouds rolled by.”

One significant aspect of the Home-
stead Act was that it restricted
homesteads by enacting laws to those
who were single or widowed. Apparent-
ly, married women circumvented
the law by filing in their maiden
names and claiming to be single. How-
ever, the restriction must have dis-
suaded some married women from stak-
ing claims which they may have des-
ired. The effect of this discrimin-
atory practice in federal law
warrants further historical research.

Patterson-Black is preparing a
book on women who homesteaded the
Great Plains alone or with other
