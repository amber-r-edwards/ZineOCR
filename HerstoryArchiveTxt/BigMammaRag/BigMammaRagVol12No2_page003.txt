A Great Job, Mama

Dear BMR:

One thing I've noticed
lately is that a lot of peo-
ple are writing in to criti-
cize you, you are apologiz-
ing profusely, they are
criticizing your apology,
you apologize again, and so
on. None of us are perfect,
none of us are "politically
correct." I'm sure a lot of
us would like to think so,
but that's bullshit.

I'm not going to tell you
that you are doing a great
job in spite of your mis-
takes, but only that you are
doing a great job. As for
the people who have appoint-
ed themselves to the task
of exposing your "disgrace-
ful" errors, I would like
to see what sort of publica-
tion they are able to pro-
duce for the next decade.

Poor And Homeless

Dear Mama:

I am a woman who is being
harassed and oppressed in
an emergency housing shel-
ter. I am beginning to see
that another way to oppress
women is by keeping them
homeless through under/un-
employment and then giving
them little choice but to
go to oppressive, fatherly-
fundamentalist-value shel-
ters, where they must eith-
er ‘fall in line', or be
harassed by ‘well-meaning’
staff of pseudo-ministers,
mostly men. Usually white
men. This is the second
time this has happened to
me and I wonder if other
women have encountered
similar things in being
poor and homeless. Also,
the lesbians around me are
being very non-vocal, ex-
cept for a few supportive,
but cynical ones. What is
gay supposed to be anyway?
How lesbian does one need
to be before a sister will
understand her need and help
her? Is this the kind of
community we are forming?
More of the same old class-
ist shit as before? Write
and tell me different or
send support for my
struggle.

Support For Woods

Dear Big Mama Rag,

I would like to extend my
thanks to you and Juana Marie
Paz for so thoroughly publi-
cizing the brutal situation
of Lonnie M. Woods in Novem-
ber's “Women in Cages". Fea-
tures on the personalized
experiences of incarcerated
women are an especially ef-
fective means of outreach to
the community on the atroci-
ties of life in "Corrections"
facilities. At least I was
horrified enough by Lonnie's
letter to really open up and
become aware of the hell
women live in cages tended
mostly by men.

If you feel Lonnie's story
is one which merits further
outreach commitment, then
maybe you will find use in
printing the poem I wrote
for her. I thought that if
other women prisoners who
read BMR see the follow-up
and concern for one woman's
story, they might be more
encouraged to relate their
stories and seek help and
love from the outside. Any-
way, my main purpose was to
write it and send to Lonnie.
Thanks for printing her ad-
dress. I think BMR is an in-
valuable service to women
at large.

In support of the struggle,
Roxi Hamilton

(Collective note: we're
sorry for not being able to
print your poem, we just
are short of space lately.
If anyone out there would
like a copy, by all means
write us and we'll be glad
to send a copy. Also, Lon-
nie Woods can be written to
at: #14217, 1479 Collins
Ave., Marysville, OH 43040.)

of home for poor
people.

Herizons Response
BMR:

Down to brass tacks! I've

been avoiding writing this
letter in response to Sue

Doell's article on the closing of Herizons; an extreme-
ly painful issue because of
the incidents and personal
feelings involved. I've
written and torn up six
copies.

Sue's article addresses
issues - some of the -isms
involved in closing Heri-
zons - but does not explore
the process involved. I feel
distrustful of political
"revelations" if lacking in
a sense of process. I want
to believe Sue's sincerity
but I need to know/hear/
talk about how we've gotten
where we are now, how we
deal/dealt with issues, and
about power and control.

Sue's last paragraph seem-
ed to contradict the feeling
of the article by saying -

"I said no (to the idea of
collective). I firmly be-
lieve (d)..." Whether there
were options or energy to
transform Herizons is some-
thing we won't know - because
Sue decided we could not try
and maintains in her last na-
ragraph that that was the on-
ly possible decision. My
situation is that in the spirit
conveyed by most of the art-
icle -

The decision was not

then and is not now Sue's
alone to make.
Perhaps finance could have

been worked out, perhaps not.

Financial reasons, however,

are in themselves
very political. The women
with energy to be at Heri-
zons were totally lacking in
financial resources.
Options were never explored
(though some lip service was
given) because none of us
were afforded the oppor-
tunity to talk collectively. I,
an "employee" didn't even
know the rent until I read
Sue's article.

When Sue stayed away from
the store for a prolonged
period of time, the women
keeping Herizons' doors open
were told to do what they
needed to do to keep opening
every day. Herizons changed
by the fact that the women
spending time there changed.
I think at this point, a
potential power struggle
developed. Sue reacted like
someone losing control - and
she was - by the essence of
our being there the charac-
ter of Herizons was chang-
ing. For however long Heri-
zons functioned without our
discussing finances - it
was and would be a different
space than Sue left. We were
accused of “taking over the
bookstore" - not through
direct dialogue - but through
2nd and 3rd hand messages
and innuendos. I chose at
that point to leave - rather
than struggle through proxy
and mixed messages.

Now, I don't want to read
about the classism of Heri-
zons' clientele, or inher-
ent in Herizons. I feel
these statements are true,
but lacking in substance.

I want to discuss and under-
stand what happened inter-
nally at Herizons. I feel
deep political lessons are
to be learned and we must
face them squarely and up-
front.

I appreciate how I think
Sue feels (we haven't talked
in months - which in itself
is a statement). I feel an
analysis of the events at
Herizons would involve an
in-depth explanation of vul-
nerable and painful experi-
ences and feelings. But for
any worthwhile political
evaluations it must be done.
I'd like to use Herizons as
a catalyst for intense comm-
unication. I'd like to hear
dialogue on the closing of
Herizons, the process in-
volved - and these issues
lead to fundamental ques-
tions - how did we support
Sue while she was undergoing
root changes, how did Sue
(did Sue?) seek input from

women involved; how were wo-
men involved defined, what
happened to communication
then and now?

There was a

or indirectly. Herizons was
also affected. I need dis-

cuss these effects (and sug—

gest Sue does too). I do
need to discuss the theories of
rape, but rather what the
brutal attack meant to our
lives; how we respond to
crisis, how we respond to
each other, what we do with
energies after the immediate
crisis has passed...ad in-
finim...It all relates. I
would like to propose an
open dialogue on these is-
sues. Perhaps BMR would be

a safe vehicle for this
dialogue.

In closing, I would like
to stress that this letter
is an attempt to raise ques-
tions I feel must be add-
ressed before we begin to
understand Herizons. And to
Sue, a public apology is
"nice" - but I would rather
feel the intense struggle
we have been avoiding than
read an “I'm sorry".
