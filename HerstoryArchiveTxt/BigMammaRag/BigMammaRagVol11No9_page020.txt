We are concerned that women's/lesbian publications have often failed to reflect the experiences  
and viewpoints of Third World, working-class and older women. CONDITIONS includes work in a  
variety of styles by both published and unpublished writers of many different backgrounds. We wel-  
come submissions from all women who feel that a commitment to other women is an integral part of  
their lives.
