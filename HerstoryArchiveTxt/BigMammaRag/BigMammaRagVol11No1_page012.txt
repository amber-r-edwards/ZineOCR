Black Women

Aboriginal children face a
future of unemployment, ill-
health and homelessness. Ab-
original adults are those
suffering most in the present
recession. Dispossessed and
homeless, they may be forced
to live in impoverished dwel-
lings including wiltjas,
lean-tos, sheds, shanties and
car bodies. Aboriginal people
of 20-29 years are 20 times
more likely to suffer from
diabetes than whites. The
Aboriginal ethnic blindness
rate is the worst in the
world. Trachoma, its major
cause, was eliminated in

white Australians 30 years
ago.

Aboriginals are also hidden
from sight or silenced in
white men's jails. In Queens-
land, 70% of the female prison
population is Aboriginal. 40%
of all people within Austral-
ian prisons are Aboriginal.
The "justice" of these stat-
istics is blatantly obvious
in the "black spitter and
white spitter cases" before
the courts. One example is
the maximum sentence given to
Percy Neal, ex-chairman of
the Yarrabah Community Coun-

Women's

11) Woman School rebirth in
the center will begin soon.
We will have seminars, exer-
cising classes, tools for sur-
vival. We also hope to get a
loan that will help pay off
our debts and open a business
that will be community owned
(women only) to support the
center as well as create jobs
for women.

Rocky Mountain Women Center
is one of the last surviving
"woman-only" spaces in this
region. Economic realities of
1982 and 1983 are not nec-
essarily promising. As a col-
lective, we accept the respon-
sibility of keeping RMWC open.

The defense for a new trial
is based on numerous violations,
including denial of my rights
to due process under the law
by refusing me the attorney

of my choice and the right to
be tried by a jury of my peers,
suppression of evidence of my
mental condition on Sept. 19,
1979 and of police brutality
at the time of the arrest, and
erroneous and misleading in-
structions by the Judge to

the jury.

cil. Percy spat at a depart-
mental officer and was init-
ially sentenced to 2 months
imprisonment. He appealed to
the Queensland High Court and
was subsequently sentenced to
6 months imprisonment—the
maximum penalty for minor
assault in Queensland—because
the High Court felt the two
months sentence was "mani-
festly inadequate." Since
Percy was sentenced, a white
person charged with spitting
on a police officer was
fined $100.

UPDATE

Results of the Commonwealth
Games were that over 800 pe-
ople were arrested during the
Games.

228 people were arrested
at an Aboriginal Land Rights
March; the bail is over
$20,000. An assassination at-
tempt on Charles Perkins,
housing spokesperson for the
Aboriginal Development Comm-

ission.

To coincide with the start
of the Commonwealth Games, a
sit-in was held at Queensland
House, London. The Aboriginal
nation's representative pre-

sented the following demands:

1. Queensland and Australia
to recognize us as a separate
nation.

2. Restore sovereignty to us
over all the lands we live on
and lay claim to.

3. Our culture—and the true
history of the white settler
state invasion of our lands
and nation.

4. Full support for Aborig-
inal protest carried out dur-
ing the Commonwealth Games,
which we have intended to be
non-violent.

5. Condemning the Australian
Government for sending Austr-
alian army personnel into the
protest region to be used
against the protesters.

From the Aboriginal Ambas-
sador to Europe:

We will never be satisfied
until our nation can live
peaceably in our own land
with no interference from any
nation, particularly the rac-
ist white colonial settler
state known as Australia.

and alive. Our minimum opera-
ting cost per month equals
$950.00. The current collec-
tive has inherited a total
sum of $3500.00 in old bills.
The financial reality of RMWC
is at this point tenuous; how-
ever, we believe in ourselves
and our ability to survive,
and in the power of women.

We are in desperate need of
support from women. We need
your input, participation,
involvement and donations.

(We will accept checks, money
orders, pledges, anything
green that resembles money.)

We are also in need of furn-

iture, chairs, sofas, lamps,

throw rugs, tables and a de-

cent electric typewriter. We

are in constant need of paper,

pens and other office supplies.
We need women to form comm-

ittees to:

upgrade our library

staff the bookstore

book and non-book ordering

outreach and publicity

newsletter

political organizing

planning and implementation

new programs as yet unborn.

We believe every woman will
have/has a stake in Rocky
Mountain Women Center.

Bond has been set at $100,000.
Currently, I'm imprisoned in
the State Institution for Wo-
men located at Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma. I've been in prison
over the past 3 years, missing
the everyday learning experi-
ences and growth of my child.
I desperately need to be free
to care for my child while
waiting for the appeal trial.
Any money used toward the bond
will be returned after the
appeal trial.

White Women
from page 9

ists cannot refuse to acknow-
ledge black women's right to
self-determination on the is-
sue of land rights. Our black
sisters need our support in
their struggle to find their
own culture; their struggle
that, like ours as feminists,
is against the white patriar-
chal takeover of culture and
the extreme oppression meted
out by the State to maintain
this power.

We need to go beyond white
guilt. We have the example of
our New Zealand feminist sis-
ters who were a strong, mili-
tant part of the anti-Springbok
protests last year. Whilst sup-
porting the black struggles,
they gained enormous amounts
politically, emotionally and
spiritually from the links
made with black women around
a black struggle. We have to
actively involve ourselves in
supporting black women's
struggle for land rights and
the right to determine their
own lives.

terial is severely limited
(two newspapers per week).

The attack on Helga Roos
signifies a new dimension in
attempts at the destruction
of the lives and identities
of political prisoners in
Germany. It is important to
immediately stop this project
against Helga Roos.

We request the national and
international public take a
stand against this attempt at
psychiatric institutionaliza-
tion and help to prevent it.

Letters from groups and in-
dividuals should be sent to:
