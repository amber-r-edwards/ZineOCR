letters home to mama

NOW Donation!

Hi -

This is the last of the money left in
the now-defunct East Metro Denver NOW
account.

We voted to give it to you because
you're doing more for feminism than
NOW.

Keep the presses rolling.

Yéionie and a big THANK YOU, not only
for the check, but also for the words
of encouragement. We incorrectly
reported in last month's "Where We're
At" that we owed our Landlord since
October for our office rent. Our very
tolerant and non-pushy Landlord in-
formed us that we owed since last

August, in case we had forgotten. Any-

ways, the check we got from NOW has
caught us up on three months rent,
bringing us up to November (to get
Biee?). Any other donations will be
cheerfully accepted as we further
attempt to bring our rent up to date.

More Graphics

Dear BMR -

When will you change that logo used
for “letters to Mama" - I'm getting
tired of it.

Bored in Boulder

Dear Bored -
We have been working (erratically)
on finding a new graphic for the Let-

ters page. We welcome any and all
graphics. If anyone out there has
something they think is appropriate,
please send it in.

case for Missouri to get the law
changed.

We are in need of support and do-
nations. The woman involved is ex-
tremely competent at her service,
very into her power and women, and
into just using and taking what you
need.

Any help or information would be
wonderful.

in home birth (In the OZARK HILLS for
the past 3 years) was taken from her
woman-built YURT in the woods. They
came to get her after dark - it was
cold . . . she was just building a
fire when a man's face loomed in the
window: "You're under arrest - come
with us NOW." . . .They interrogated
her, took away her shoes, and locked
her up. She has been arraigned on 2
counts of “Practicing medicine and
being a midwife without a license."
She IS an R.N.. . .has been attending
births for 3 years - BUT - rumor has
it, a local M.D. ($$$) made the com-
plaint. NOW she faces potential fines
of $1,000 on each count and possible
jail term. WOMEN. . . YOUR rights

In August of 1975, the National
Radical Feminist Convention (NRFC)
was held in York, PA. The Conference

Committee unexpectedly came out of

that with a surplus of approximately

$2,000, so unexpectedly that no plans

were made in advance to deal with

this possibility.

Some of us have been in communica-
tion with each other the past few
months, through meetings and corres-
pondence, trying to determine the best
process to use in putting the money
to good use.

We decided that the best way to de-
termine the fate of the money was to
ask conference participants for pro-
posals which described a definite
plan for the usage of the money. We
then took a poll by sending out pac-
kets of the proposals we received.
Each woman then voted for the project
she thought most appropriate.

The conference committee has been
reduced to three women: Lee Mosswood
and Darlene Pagano of Oakland, and
Morgan Starchild of Denver. The res-
ponsibility for this final structure
and organization lies with us.

We remaining members decided that
the money would be divided among only
three groups.

It is with great pleasure that we
finally announce the fate of the mon-
ey. Lesbian Mother's Defense Fund,
in Seattle, will receive 35% ($673.75)
OPAL (Ozark Power & Light) a Women's
Land trust in Missouri will receive
30% ($577.50); and 35% ($673.75) will
go to the Offense Against Psycho-
surgery Fund, of Hatfield, MA. Inter-
est earned will be returned to the
Bay Area Feminist Federal Credit
Union, where the money has been kept.

The sum of money we had been left
with was $1925. This is after all
expenses had been covered, including

the costs of the polling mail-outs.
We thank all those women who helped

us resolve this situation with their

time, encouragement and suggestions.

Dear Sisters,

I would like to let you know some of
the recent developments in regard to
"Working on Wife Abuse", a national
directory for people dealing with the
issue of battered women. The direc-
tory lists refuges, services, public-
ations, films, funding sources, task
forces, etc., etc., concerned with
this issue.

Because of the great need for com-
munication on this issue, I started
gathering information in the summer of
'75 and have subsequently published
four editions of the directory. It's
over one hundred pages now and contains
about one thousand entries. I’m plan-
ning to update and republish it soon
again. The directory is being used
widely for referral by those working
