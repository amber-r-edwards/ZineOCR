Craftswomen from page 4

"It's a pleasure doing busi-
ness with you." Now that would
never have happened at a cheap
man's press. I paid about 2
thousand dollars for 1 thousand
copies. Iowa City is hold-
ing the metal plates in case

I can ever print some more.
Pagan gave me the first thou-
sand. She has a master's de-
gree in feminist theory and
writing from Goddard Cambridge
-- that feminist school that
died -- she earned the money
typing for $6 an hour at a
terrible place. I told Iowa
City I would pay the rest af-
ter the National Women's Stud-
ies Conference at Storrs. But
at Storrs, they put us crafts-
women in an ROTC hangar while
all the other women were in
other buildings. I lost money.
The conference cost me more
than I made. Iowa City Women's
Press was really nice about
waiting for the money.

I signed a contract with
Barbara Grier. She said Naiad
Press would advertise and
distribute the thousand cop-

ies. Well, I never saw an ad
for my book. If you advertise
a book, it sells. If you
don't, it doesn't. My book
just sold itself and is now
out of print. Barbara Grier
never did pay me all the mon-
ey. I figure she still owes
me $329.40. She says no --
that she gave the rest of the
copies to prisoners. I figure
she is using my $329.40 to
build a lesbian pornography
empire and I have terminated
my agreement with her.

Let's talk about money. To-
day I applied for a job at the
supermarket. It's the only
job in town. On the applica-
tion there is a question:
"Have you ever been convict-
ed of a criminal offense? If
yes, explain." I skipped the
question. The woman noticed
and told me to fill it in. I
wrote: "Yes. Twice, I sat on
a step of the Pentagon with
Women's Pentagon Action and
I was sent to federal prison,
twice." I spent $500 to buy
the silver to make axes to

According to a recent secret
opinion poll, 60% of the pop-
ulation in Ireland (26 coun-
ties) is against a referendum

being held on an amendment
which aims to ensure that
abortion will never be legal-
ized.

The 26 counties have had to
go through three general elec-
tions in the last 18 months;
at least one-third of the pop-
ulation lives on or below the
poverty line and people are
angry that the coalition gov-
ernment has bowed to pressure
from the 'Pro-Life' Amendment
Campaign to carry out a re-
ferendum which will cost
1,000,000 pounds. Neverthe-
less, if it goes to the peo-
ple, the amendment will al-
most certainly be passed.

The amendment reads, The
State acknowledges the right
to Life of the unborn and,
with due regard to the equal
right to the Life of a mother,
guarantees in its Laws to
respect and, as far as prac-
ticable, by its Laws, to vin-
dicate and defend that right.

Abortion In Ireland

Although abortion is already
illegal, this amendment will
threaten the health and lives
of many women who may be de-
nied treatment, e.g., for cancer,
because of risk to the fetus.
It could mean that injunc-
tions will be taken out to
stop women traveling abroad
for abortions and, if a woman
defied an injunction, she
could face trial and imprison-
ment on her return for con-
tempt of court. Referral
agencies and well-woman clin-
ics are also likely to become
targets of the 'Pro-Lifers'
and the attack is likely to
be extended to contraception
such as IUDs and morning
after pills. Many women will
be forced to continue unwant-
ed pregnancies and return to
backstreet abortions.

The Anti-Amendment Campaign,
PO Box 1285, Dublin 7, Ire-
land, urgently needs funds
and support to continue its
fight against the amendment.

The Women's Right to Choose
Campaign, PO Box 1076, Dublin
1, which is affiliated to the
Anti-Amendment Campaign is
also fighting for a woman's
absolute right to choose an
abortion.

too. She says, "I think it is
because we are not eating
enough." I would be dead if
Pagan didn't hand me some
twenties when she has some.
The money for her job is
running out.

I don't want to leave you
feeling bad. We women have
been unpaid servants for 5000
years and that is long enough.
We are resisting. We are ris-
ing up all over the planet to
stop the missiles, to save
life on the planet, to change
almost everything fast. It is
almost impossible, but we
just might break free if we

take to Indiana. I worked on
them for weeks. I paid $45
for a table, $80 for gas, $42
for a room, $20 for having my
car towed. I bought some gran-
ola bars and oranges. I
couldn't afford a meal ticket
or concert tickets. On the way
home I spent $13 for a room at
Freeway Inn Motel in Mt. Gile-
ad, Ohio. Around a corner and
out of sight, some crafts-
women sat all day long, selling
nothing. I got home with $440.
How am I supposed to live on
that?

Pagan says I look awful,
and I do. She looks dreadful,
