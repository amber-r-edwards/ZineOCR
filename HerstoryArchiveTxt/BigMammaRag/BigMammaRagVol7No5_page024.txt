Rape And Patriarchy...continued from pg 22

Rape is an inevitable consequence of a patriarchal society. Rape is one
of the atrocities along with murder, war, imperialism and colonialism that
express and validate phallocentricity. "All personal, psychological, social
and institutionalized domination on this earth can be traced back to its
source: the phallic identities of men." (Dworkin) Rape is part of our liter-
ary and artistic heritage--a cultural ideal. How then, can women be free
from rape? The answer lies in the destruction of the patriarchy, the eradi-
cation of all the antiquated, oppressive values and institutions that sustain
male supremacy.

Women are taking the first steps in breaking the debilitative effects of
sexism. We are creating “a counter-reality, a mutually guaranteed support
of female experience, undistorted by male interpretation". (Mehrhof) Women
are helping each other redefine themselves. We are finding the resources to
take ourselves seriously as women. Women will discover the method for erad-
icating the power discrepancy between women and men. Through our collective
energy/wisdom we will create a whole new world where domination, oppression
and inequality do not exist!
