Lesbian Incest Survivors from page?

home, I was still afraid to  
go back and stay overnight,  
feeling crazy because I didn't  
understand why. Now, I real-  
ize that what was being called  
affection and roughhousing was  
filled with a lot of sexual  
tension. And although my fath-  
er didn't force any overt sex-  
ual acts on me, he did force  
himself physically on me. It  
has been very difficult for  
me to admit this to myself,  
and the support I got from  
the group has helped me im-  
mensely.

Some childhood memories  
are coming back now, although  
there are whole years that are  
still missing. I am continuing  
to tell friends of my exper-  
ience and I continue to be  
amazed at how often incest  
happens and how silent we have  
been about it. My parents vis-  
ited me recently and I was  
able to tell them about my  
uncle; they were shocked, hurt  
that I hadn't told them be-  
fore, and very supportive of  
me. Maybe someday I'll be able  
to confront my father about  
his actions as well.

I know now how much energy  
it took to keep silent and I

but at the misinformation you  
gave the public as to who I  
am. I am not nor have I ever  
been the secretary of the  
National Task Force for Coun-  
ter Intelligence Program Lit-

proudly with this organiza-

The barefaced distortion of  
facts coupled with the format  
in which my name and the name  
of the other sisters presently  
incarcerated here at MCC for  
refusing to cooperate with the  

RICO Grand Jury only leads me  
to the conclusion that you are  
misinformed, unethical and in-  
capable of representing my in-  
terests and most certainly  
not my son's.

***When I was nine years old  
my father came into my bed-  
room late one night and oral-  
ly raped me. Because it was  
late—and I had been sleeping;  
because not a word was ex-  
changed the whole time; be-  
cause I kept my eyes closed  
through most of it; and most-  
ly because I couldn't recon-  
cile this monster with the  
father I adored, I was left  
the next morning with just  
the memory of all the physi-  
cal sensations and the feel-  
ing I'd had a feverish night-  
mare. For me, being in the  
incest group was the begin-  
ning of being able to trust  
my own memories and percep-  
tions around that night; to  
dispel any doubts I had left  
that I was making the whole  
thing up. The validation I  
received from the other wom-  
yn gave me the courage I  
needed to see a hypnothera-  
pist to relive the painful  
memories and all the feel-

All of our ideas and per-  
spectives come from who we  
are and how we relate. We  
feel it is important to in-  
clude the following infor-  
mation about ourselves:

We are 4 separatists; 1  
lesbian feminist. Two of us  
are Jewish, all of us are  
light-skinned. Three are  
working class; 2 are middle  
class. Three never related  
sexually to non-womyn. Four  
are femme; 1 is butch. One  
of us is fat. One is a co-  
alcoholic; 4 are recovering  
pot addicts. Our ages are:  
26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32.

jobs that a man would look  
after them—so much for inde-  
pendence. I suppose lesbians  
had thoughts on this but the  
book doesn't mention lesbians—  
did we exist in the 40's?  

The last chapter talks about  
the film and I feel each of us  
should really read the chapter  
(and the book, of course) and,  
see the film because of the  
propaganda and how it was  
used and realize it is not too  
far removed from the propagan-  
da that is being aimed at wo-  
men by the government, the  
media and the Moral Majority  
right now. No matter how pol-  
itical we think we are, or  
sophisticated or dykie—prop-  
aganda is hitting us with the  
kind of woman we should be,  
and as the economy gets worse  
it will hit us harder in order  
to remove us from jobs and  
get us back to our rightful  
place, under the patriarchal  

thumb.  

The main fault I found with  
the book was that it rarely  
mentioned women of other  
races, it doesn't mention  
Jewish women and how they ty  
fared in the defense industry  
because I just know that anti-  
Semitism did not evaporate.  
The book doesn't make politic-  
al connections that I wish it  
had. The fact of using racism  
as a tool of capitalism/imper-  
ialism to divide us is not  
discussed, classism is just  
mentioned. The focus is sex-  
ism (which doesn't talk of  
the patriarchy) but that ain’t  
enough, not near enough.  

The book has listings of  
films, books, slide/tape shows  
that sound good and available?
