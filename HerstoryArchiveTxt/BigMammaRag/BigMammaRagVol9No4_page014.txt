1980 paperback $3.50

Top Ranking; Racism and
Classism in the Lesbian Com-
munity is a collection of
articles edited by Sara
Bennett and Joan Gibbs. In
their own words, Top Ranking
is part of the "on-going dis-
cussions of racism and class-
ism in the lesbian community.”
All articles received were
printed with a minimum of ed-
iting and although it did not
include any native, Latina,
or Asian lesbians, at least
one third of the articles
are by black women.

The first article is by
Sara and Joan, and gives
the best synopsis of the
Black experience in Anglo
America from 1492 to the pre-
sent that I have read. It
goes on to give an analysis
of classism and racism in
the context of U.S. expan-
sion into Puerto Rico and Mex-
ico. It includes a statement

more on page

from Maria Haydee Torres,
an FALN warrior who, with ten
other Puerto Rican freedom
fighters, was captured in 1980.
She is presently serving a
life sentence for murder.
(BMR vol. 9, no. 1, p. 3)

The point of the history
is to prove that "racism
is rooted in and a fundament-
al part of the 'U.S.'". They
make a very clear analysis
of what it means to be Black
working class as opposed to
white working class. For
instance, a black family's
income is 59% of a white
family's and the infant

mortality rate is 50% higher
for blacks than for whites.
Given all these statistics
they surmise it would be
a miracle if racism did not
exist in the lesbian commun-
ity. They end the article
citing specific examples of
racism in our community and
suggestions for how to begin

working against it.

Another article by Charoula
talks about her group, "Women
Free Women in Prison". This
group exemplifies the pledge
coming more and more to the
lips of political lesbians:
"I will actively work to
support the struggle against
Racism". The collective vi-
sits women in prison, brings
them materials, acts as lia-
son between them and the out-
side world, goes to trials
and class action suits, drums
up publicity, organizes let-
ter campaigns and publishes
a newsletter, No More Cages.

Charoula points out that
90% of women in prison in
New York are black and all
of them are poor. "To be for
women—and to ignore the spec-
ial plight of women in prison
is a contradiction." She ends
the article saying to attack
prisons by aiding prisoners
is attacking the state itself.

The next article I would
like to recommend is “Making
Visible the Invisible..." by
Vickie M. Mays. She gives an
extensive bibliography for
those of us looking for books
to alleviate our ignorance
on black culture. She also
gives us a bonus: books about
woman-to-woman marriages

practiced by a number of
African tribes. Her point in
citing these marriages is that
black lesbian's herstory is
even less visible than white
lesbian's. She goes on to say
that white women’s resources
promote their invisibility.
"The Afro-American lesbian...
finds herself without a wom-
en's center which caters to
her needs or without a body
of literature readily available
to tell her about her lesbian
sisters. Yet many times the
Euro-American lesbian commu-
nity fails to provide this
supportive function by the
sharing of resources..."

All in all, the booklet is
unique (unfortunately) and
excellent. That it appears in
print now is fortuitous, with
the fervor over racism pre-
sently going on in our com-
munity. Unfortunately, this
booklet is not available in
any of our bookstores, al-
though I have been trying to
order it for RIP and Woman-
to-Woman. It can be gotten
by sending $3.50 to FEB. 3
PRESS, c/o Joan Gibb and
Sara Bennett, 306 Lafayette
Ave., Brooklyn, New York, 11238.

The $3.50 is on a more-if-
you-can, less-if-you-can't
basis.

Nations Clash Over Feminist Issues’ from page 11

Economic relationships between
the industrialized and the
developing countries. The
quality of life of women in
the developing countries de-
pends very much on whether
they gain control over land
and its uses, over other
natural resources, and over
their own labor.

When countries in the world

are having a dialogue with one
another on the new political
relationship and the New Int-
ernational Economic Order, it
is important that women of the
developing countries join in
and become part of this
change. Here lies a dilemma
for the feminists of develop-
ing countries. How could they
side with their men in the
struggle to bring about in-
ternational justice and to ba-
lance the North-South power,
and, at the same time, side
with European and North Amer-
ican feminists in the common
struggle against sexism at

the international level?
The fact that women had to
struggle with each other com-

ing from different parts of
the world to the Copenhagen
Conference showed that women
have now begun to move them-
selves from the periphery
situation to the center of the
power struggle between North
and South, East and West.
Knowing world history, I would
worry if it were the other way
around—that when there is a
struggle of this kind to end
economic exploitation and
political domination, the
representatives of half of
humankind who are female come
together at the Mid-decade
Women's Conference merely to
indulge in analyzing the con-
ditions of victimization, to
cry over each other's should-
ers, and to end up with peace
and harmony.

The difficulties between wo-
men of the developing coun-

Page 18 - Big Mama Rag, April, 1981

tries and women of Europe and
North America at the Copen-
hagen Conference signaled
that many of women have al-
ready penetrated into the
national and the international
economic and political struc-
ture; women, and many of them
feminists, are now working,
not as outsiders in institu-
tions and governments, but as
insiders trying to change the
structure from within.

The resolutions and deci-
sions adopted by the confer-
ence, many of them new and
never before discussed in any
UN meeting, reflect many of
the North American and Euro-
pean feminists’ agenda, such
as the resolution on battered
women and violence in the
family, on elderly women and
economic security, promotion
of equality in education and
training, exploitation of
prostitutes and the traffic
in women's bodies. They also

include many of the Third
World women's agenda topics
such as women in agriculture
and rural areas, women living
under the condition of ex-
treme poverty, apartheid and
women in South Africa and
Namibia, the situation of
women in Chile and Bolivia,
and the implementation of the
goals of the United Nations
Decade for Women within the
framework of United Nations
efforts to achieve the New
International Economic Order.
Knowing all the constraints
of national and international
bureaucracy, I am more than
satisfied with the results of
the Conference. We tried our
best to bring into the Con-
ference feminists' thinking
and aspirations for the fu-
ture of humankind.
