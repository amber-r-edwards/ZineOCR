Editor's note:  

The quotes in this article are  
from interviews with different  
women at the two women's bars in  
Denver, the Three Sisters and the  
Velvet Hammer. The women in the  
pictures do not necessarily make  
any of the quoted statements.  

Although there are other bars  
that women go to in Denver, this  
article was not intended to give  
comprehensive coverage of the bar  
scene. Rather we focused on these  
two bars because they serve women  
exclusively. They provide woman-  
space where women can relate to  
women without the interference of  
men.  

Why do you come to the bar?  

I LIVE OUT OF THE CITY AND IT IS NICE  
TO MEET WOMEN AND TO HAVE A LOT OF  
PEOPLE AROUND.  

I LIKE TO GO HERE BECAUSE I LIKE A  
PLACE I CAN RELAX WITHOUT MEN.  

I LIKE TO DANCE, TO CRUISE, LOOK AROUND.  

I LIKE BARS BECAUSE YOU CAN GET CRAZY  
IN BARS.  

I GO TO THE BARS WHEN I'M BORED  
WITH MY JOB.  

I GO AFTER A BRONCOS GAME. IT DE-  
PENDS ON MY MOOD, BUT AT LEAST ONCE  
A WEEK USUALLY.  

I GO IN SPURTS, ONCE EVERY SIX  
MONTHS, IF I'M LONELY AND BORED.  
ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK.  

IF I HAVE A LOVER AND AM ACTIVE IN  
OTHER ACTIVITIES, I DON'T GO AS  
MUCH.  

THERE IS NOT THAT MUCH GAY WOMEN'S  
STUFF IN DENVER, SO THE BAR IS REAL  
IMPORTANT FOR WOMEN TO RELATE, ESPECI-  
ALLY FOR SINGLE WOMEN.  

I MET MY LOVER AT A BAR; I FIRST SAW  
HER WHEN SHE WAS PLAYING POOL.  

WHEN I CAME OUT, I TOOK UP POOL.  

Sexuality  

I LOVE DANCING, SEXUAL DANCING TOO.  

IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD TO SEE OTHER  
PEOPLE WHO ARE HAPPY AND LOVING EACH  
OTHER.  

CLUTCHY COUPLES ARE OK BECAUSE THIS  
IS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES THEY CAN GO  
WHERE THEY CAN SHOW THEIR AFFECTION.  

BUT BLATANT SHOWING OFF AND HAVING  
ORGASMS IN FRONT OF EVERYONE ISN'T  
GOOD - THEY SHOULD GO HOME. ONCE I WENT  
INTO THE BATHROOM AND GOT IT ON WITH  
A WOMAN I HAD JUST MET.  

What do you want changed?  

I WOULD LIKE ANOTHER POOL TABLE.  
WE NEED A GOOD DISCO - LIKE A WOMAN'S  
BROADWAY OR DOC WEEDS.  

THE MUSIC IS TOO SENTIMENTAL AND SLOW  
SO PEOPLE CAN HUG.  

I WOULD LIKE MORE WOMEN'S MUSIC ON  
THE JUKEBOX.  

THERE SHOULD BE A SECTION FOR  
SMOKING.  

I WISH WE HAD POPULAR MUSIC ON THE  
JUKEBOX, LIKE MELISSA MANCHESTER,  
CARLY SIMON AND PHOEBE SNOW.  

I WOULD LIKE TO PLAY DARTS.  

Meeting women  

I USUALLY COME HERE WITH MY LOVER.  

IT IS DIFFERENT COMING ALONE. WOMEN  
ARE MORE AGGRESSIVE WHEN I COME ALONE.  

I MEET A FAIR NUMBER OF WOMEN AND I  
GO OUT WITH SOME OF THEM.  

IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE ON A MEAT RACK  
WHEN YOU'RE HUSTLED AS SOON AS YOU  
ENTER THE ROOM.  

I LIKE TO MEET PEOPLE WHO WANT TO  
KNOW ME AS A PERSON, NOT JUST SOME-  
ONE TO SLEEP WITH FOR THE NIGHT.

Bars and alcoholism  

GAY PEOPLE ARE OPPRESSED, AND A FEELING  
OF OPPRESSION SURROUNDS THE BARS. WE  
CAN'T GO ANYWHERE ELSE.  

I LIMIT MYSELF TO TWO BEERS. I DON'T  
NEED ALCOHOL FOR A CRUTCH.  

THE BARS PROBABLY CONTRIBUTE TO TOO  
MUCH DRINKING, BUT THIS WAS MORE TRUE  
IN THE PAST WHEN WOMEN HAD NO OTHER  
PLACE TO GO. NOW THERE ARE OTHER  
PLACES LIKE THE BOOKSTORE AND SPORTS.  

A DENVER PUBLIC SCHOOLS BUS DRIVER  
SPENDS $25 OF THE $600 A MONTH SHE  
EARNS AT THE BARS.  

IF ANYONE STARTS A GAY COFFEE HOUSE,  
NO ONE GOES, BECAUSE DRINKING HELPS  
PEOPLE SOCIALIZE.  

IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A WOMEN'S  
COFFEE HOUSE WHERE YOU COULD GO AND  
READ AND RELAX WITHOUT HAVING TO  
DRINK.  

Crowded on weekday evenings.

I LIKE A PLACE WHERE I CAN —  

THE VELVET HAMMER  

The Velvet Hammer opened on September  
1, 1976, five months after Ms J's  
closed in the same location at 23rd  
and Clay Sts. It is a small, cozy,  
women's bar. In the front room is a  
pool table which is usually not  
available. Several tables and an L-shaped bar are lit by  
candlelight and are small enough to  

encourage intimate conversation. In  

the back room is space for dancing,  

a jukebox and several tables.  

"The managers, Linda Ryan and Sharon  
Bankes (Conga player and lead singer  
with B.F. Sugar) want the bar to be  
feminist. Since the opening they have  
held a benefit for the Rachele Yaseen  
Defense Fund (the Denver Lesbian  
mother custody case.) They want to  
support the development of a local  
women's culture. They encourage women  
artists, poets and musicians to per-  
form there and get exposure.  

Every Wednesday night there is live  
women's music and on Sunday afternoon  
there is a poetry reading. The wall  
space is available for women artists  
to show their work. The bar takes no  
commission from sales. Please call  
them and tell them what you would  
like to offer. (455-9827 after 4 P.M)  

Sharon and Linda see the bar as a  
space where women can be who they  
are in a relaxed atmosphere. They  
have put Olivia records on the jukebox,  
such as Chris Williamson and  
Meg Christian. They post notices of  
events in the women's community. They  
will be selling the Colorado Women's  
Resource Book and perhaps other books  
from Woman to Woman Bookcenter.  

This bar offers excellent homemade  
chili and tortillas. Every Sunday  
from 11:30 on, they serve brunch for  
$1.50 with Bloody Marys for 75¢.  

A typical activity at the bar was  
the poetry reading on Sunday, November  
14th, when four local women read  
their poetry. Jeannie Winer, Anita  
Vallerio, JoHannah Reilly and Karen  
Rice King gave a poetry reading of  
unique pleasure. These women are  
students from Boulder and have never  
performed before. It was a delight to  
hear them.  

While they were reading in the back  

room, women in the front room contin-  

ued to talk and play pool, but nei-  
ther group disturbed the other. This  
bar provides space for several diff-  
erent needs of women to be met at the  
same time: social and cultural.  

We tend to forget that bars meet  
athletic needs also. Dancing and  
playing pool are good ways to let  
off steam and relax.  

This bar serves an important  
function in our community. The only  
problem is that not enough women  
know where it is since it is so new  
in Denver.  

The Velvet Hammer is located at  
2638 W 23rd St where 23rd intersects  
with Clay. The easiest way to get to  
it is to get off the Valley Highway  
or I-25 at the 23rd Street Exit. It  
is at the end of the first block  
on the left. There is a woman's  
symbol over the Schlitz sign.
