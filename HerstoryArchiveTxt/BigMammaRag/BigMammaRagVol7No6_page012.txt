for the children

I work today and there are children  
playing below my window.  
I learn about the effects of radiation  
on young bodies,  
and the children sing, and cry, and shout,  
their voices in my consciousness  
always.  

for a while,  
every child's voice I heard was yours.  
I miss you...  

I remember the day we became a "family":  
two women and a child  
the commitment your mother asked of me  
was a commitment to you...  
and I was frightened  
frightened of you  
frightened of the child in me  

Of families  

staying together - for whom?  

my family stayed together for the sake of the parents,  

of course.  

and from an early age,  
I assumed responsibility for  
the family's future:  
I was my mother's mother  
and my father's nemesis...  
he told me my existence was a mistake.  

But the only mistake is that we tried too long  
to be  
a family-  

bound for years by guilt  
violence  
bitter disappointment.  

but we were children together  
and together we learned  
and overcame the incredible odds  
that two such different children  
would ever meet and become friends.  
We learned to share each other.  

for months,  
every golden child I saw was you.  

I have not forgotten you. How do you remember me?  

I will always love you for that night  
you understood and I did not.  
I was trembling with fear and sadness,  

knowing our lives together had changed.  

You cried too,  

and held me in your five-year-old sensitivity.  

Why has it taken me so long to know  
what loss has hurt me most?  

I did not know what caring was until I broke free,  
and only now am I learning what it means to  

love  
and to be loved.  

Funny-  

each of us lives alone now, without other people,  
a nuclear family scattered  
released  

relieved.  
For a while, I hoped we might  

really get to know each other as we are  
(without the definitions).  

And now I know  

we would never have chosen to know each other at all,  

all those years  
for the sake of the children.  

sometimes I see you on your way home from school,  

and I want to stop and tell you  
I still care...  
would that frighten you?  
or am I the only one who is afraid?  

visiting times - what a joke.  

you were caught in the storm of afterwards,  
you were the victim of feelings unresolved-  
and I am eaten out by a system that separates us,  

freezes us into different spaces,  

but my feelings for you have never grown cold-  
and this morning as I remember your warmth,  
I am glad that you do not know me because I was there  

for the sake of the child.  

The American Way of Life  

Children, Violence, and the Nuclear Family  

Dianne Talmadge  

It was not unusual for my father to  
come home after having spent his pay-  
check, and then some, on a three-day  
binge, to look for that five dollar  
bill he knew my mother was hiding  
somewhere in the trailer. After hav-  
ing destroyed the place without find-  
ing the extra beer money, he would  
beat the shit out of my mom until she  
finally gave up and turned over the  
five. Two hours later he would return  
to fuck her till he was tired of it  
and go to sleep.  

The next day, if he had a job to  
still go to, he would have me and my  
mother up to fix him some breakfast,  
would kiss me good-bye on the cheek,  
yell at my mother, "the fucking  
bitch", to make sure a decent dinner  
would be ready for him when he got  
home, which was a difficult task con-  
sidering there was no more money and  
she was never sure of when he would  
show up.  

I would then pour my mom a cup of  
coffee and get the things from the  
bathroom to dress up the cuts and  
bruises from the night before, but  
would not put them away because in  
a few hours I knew she would be check-  
ing me over to make sure that in her  
fit of rage, loneliness and frustra-  
tion, she hadn't beaten me up too  
badly. I did not question my mother's  
love.  

The "Rocky Mountain News" or the  
“Denver Post" would love this story.  
Were this happening now, as opposed  
to 17 years ago, I could read tomorrow  
morning them demanding, not that my  
father be arrested for wife-beating  
or marital rape, but that I be immedi-  
ately removed from my mother's care.  
They would make headlines out of an  

abusive situation-- “Sick a de Tor-  
tures Child"-- and advertise the need  
for more centers and studies to cure  
women, these few and far between women  
with serious behavioral defects. They  
would be wrong.  

This year, in all the media blitz  
about the “battered child“, in all  
the sensational stories about scald-  
ings, beatings and sometimes deaths,  
they have taken what should be a very  
clear picture of what the violence is  
all about, but have focused it only  
on the child, so that in the end re-  
mains the picture isn't in focus at  

The physical abuse of children is  
a woman's issue, not because women  
are statistically the ones who beat  
on their children (men, on the other  
hand, sexually abuse their children  
with much greater frequency), but be-  
cause it concerns the very real condi-  
tions under which women and children  
live. Child abuse is the natural re-  
sult of the expectations of a woman's  
role as a mother put into conflict  
with the realities she encounters in  
the day-to-day questions of survival.  
Child abuse is not an isolated prob-  
lem with individual solutions, but a  
collective reaction to the powerless-  
ness women experience in the confines  
of the family, which in the hierarchi-  
cal structure sees the man on top  
and the woman, boy child and girl  
child on the bottom, in that order.  

Given the existing family model,  
which under capitalism is the nuclear  
family, child abuse makes sense. My  
family is an example of how logical  
it is that violence is a symptom of  
the family unit most of us have been  
forced to live under.  

The statistics also tell the story  

had there been a choice.  

in clear terms and get rid of the  
myths the media chooses to perpetuate.  
It is a fact that 70% of child abuse  
cases occur in "real" families. A  
"real" family is one in which both a  
man and a woman live together with  
children, within the laws of marriage.  
All other variations of family are,  
according to societal values, incom-  
plete, or “not as good".  

I come from what is considered the  
basis of a good family. My father,  
when he was “winning the bread", was  
the bread-winner. My mother, in marry-  
ing at 19, did the deed called upon  
of all good women-- she tried to fit  
into the carefully designed,  

fulfillment as a human being-- that of  
financial dependence on a man through  
marriage, while keeping his home and  
being a selfless loving mother to his  
five children. She found out, however,  
that this complex model, filled with  
pressures and rigid expectations,  
didn't work.  

90% of abused children come from  
families with "marital problems” most-  
ly centered around alcohol and money.  
I can remember nothing but my parents  
violent arguments around these two  
issues. We never had much money, and  
what we did have my father managed to  
drink. In the meantime, he expected my  
mother to keep the kind of house, pre-  
pare the nourishing meals, and wear  
the kinds of clothes displayed on TV  
via "Father Knows Best" and "The Donna  
Reed Show." The cutting edge of child  
abuse is present again: the expecta-  
tions of her role versus the realities  
of the situation.  

I once asked my mother why she  
didn't divorce my dad and she answered  
with, "What else do I know how to do?”  
There is nothing unimportant about  

caring for children, yet it is “unskilled"  
labor, not only unpaid, but it  
carries the stigmatism of "lowly".  

My mother, as all mothers, was the  
workforce of the home. Without this  
"hidden" workforce, our economic sys-  

"romantic  
role model which would ensure her full-  

Choice-  
sometimes I am overwhelmed.  

Open a cage door and people  
are reticent  

to move  

outside. .  

we take small steps  
each of us a child learning to walk.  

but we have choices  
when we choose to make them  

each of us an adult learning to run.  

a child is part of my life  
but people I knew as family are not-  

look,  
we can change the outcomes  

I may never choose to conceive a child  
But I don't have to "own" my own  
to have a family.  

a child taught me sharing  
adults taught me possession  

and knowing that,  

I choose to be a child again  

so I can grow up right this time -  

so I can share my life with women who  
understand  

that we need  
a world  
of  
choice.  

fill  

tem would fall apart, and in fact,  
depends on getting the labor of two  
people (the man and the woman) for  

the price of one (the man's). Yet, she  
spent 24 hours a day, in isolation  
with her children, doing a job with  
very few resources at hand, without  
getting any rewards or recognition.  

She felt powerless, and that powerlessness  
was obvious to me at a very  
early age, and it made me sick, I  
hated the way she would beg my father  
to not beat her, to not spend the  
money on alcohol and gambling, to  

not hock the TV, to not keep moving  
around from job to job. The circum-  
stances may vary from family to family  
but the power dynamics are built in  
and enforceable by law. Although some  
men may have no real power in larger  
society (and my father was certainly  
one who did not) men of all classes,  
races and ages share power over the  
women and children they are involved  
with in the family.  

I know that the only time my mother  
felt in control of a situation was  
with her children, and only when my  
father was not around. I know that  
the times she acted out her frustra-  
tion on me were the times in which  
she was feeling the "pinch"- of the  
division of power, of economics, of  
the burdensome responsibility of hav-  
ing children in isolation with no  
other support.  

Later, I would ask my father why  
he did not get divorced when it seemed  
obvious with all his AWOL's from  
his marriage to my mother that he  
really didn't want to be there. His  
reply was, "The family has to stay  
together for the sake of you kids.
