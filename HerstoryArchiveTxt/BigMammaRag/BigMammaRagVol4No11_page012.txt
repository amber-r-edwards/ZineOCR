Rap Group For Parents

A Denver mother is forming a sup-
port group for the parents of
lesbian and gay children. Betty
Fairchild formed a similar group
in Washington D.C. after she learned
six years ago that her son is gay.

The group will focus on ending
feelings of isolation, sharing
feelings, offering support, reading
new materials and sharing good ex-
periences in an informal friendly
setting.

She said she hopes parents may
be able to reach the point she has
reached in her relationship with
her son: "I don't want him to go
straight. I want him to do what-
ever's right for him."

Mrs. Fairchild can be reached
at 831-8576.

Insurance Under Fire

The Feminist Party plans to
examine the hiring and firing pol-
icies of major insurance companies,
especially as they affect women
who seek to unionize clerical level
employees. Insurance companies hire
large numbers of women who desper-
ately need their jobs so that
unionizing is almost impossible.

The Feminist Party is asking
women to investigate local companies
and report instances of sexism and
racism to the EEOC.

In the Kitchen

The Connecticut Human Rights
Commission has ruled a woman's
place is in the kitchen, if she
wants it that way and works at
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

The Commission found nine Chicken
franchises guilty of discrimination
against women who want to work in
the kitchen and ordered the firms
to stop assigning women exclusively
to counter work.

Hair-Raising Ad

Women at the University of
Washington in Seattle are protesting
the Clairol Loving Care Hair Color
ad that appeared in the June, 1976,
1008 HOUSEKEEPING.

The ad pictures a businesswoman
with the headline, “On men, gray
hair is distinguished. On me, it's
just plain old." The copy beneath
begins, "Sure, it's unfair. I have
only a few grays. If I were a man,
I'd be growing them gracefully.
Instead, I'm plucking them furiously."

This One Won't Burn?

A new bra, devised at a Scottish
hospital, may be a major break-
through against breast cancer.
According to the Times of London,
the bra measures minute temperature
changes every few minutes, making
it possible to detect cancer cells
in their earliest stages.

According to the bra's inventor,
Dr. Hugh Simpson, a pathology lec-
turer at Glasgow Royal Infirmary,
the bra could also be modified to
serve as a contraceptive. By
measuring temperature changes in a
woman's breast, it can show the
safe period very accurately, he
says.

Job Leave For Dads. Not Moms

The American Bar Association
has been charged with sex discrim-
ination in granting men -- but not
women -- paid maternity leaves.

Complaints were filed in Novem-
ber with the US Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission by ABA em-
ployees Catherine Milton, Bernadette
Price and Mona Lyons. They charged
that while women are denied any
form of paid leave by the Washing-
ton, D.C. Bar Association office,
men are allowed up to five days
paid leave.

Lesbians, Not Police, On Trial

Jury Rules Against Dyketactics

Dyketactics lost their lawsuit
against the City of Philadelphia and
the Philadelphia Police Department
for using police harassment and
brutality against members of the
group. After two hours of delibera-
tion, the six woman, six man jury
found the police innocent of using
unnecessary force when they “removed"
the women from a 1975 demonstration
at City Hall.

The six members of Dyketactics
were asking $200,000 in damages for
two separate incidents that occurred
December 4, 1975, when various
groups appeared at city council
chambers to protest the council's
failure to pass Bill 1275, a gay
rights bill to provide equal rights
in housing, public accommodations
and jobs.

Dyketactics displayed banners
reading, "You shall have the comfort
of our silence no longer," and led
the group in chanting, “Free 1275."
City Council President Schwartz then
ordered the Sergeant-at-Arms to
clear the room. Chamber guards moved
through the crowd and focused on the
women; they were thrown to the floor,
kicked, and sexually molested.

AIT members supporting the protest
were then forcibly evicted, and most
eventually left upon hearing the
chambers had been emptied. Dyke-
tactics decided to stay and demon-
strate outside Schwartz's office.
They used a thirteen-foot high witch
puppet and guerrilla theater to pro-
test enforced heterosexuality and
the subjugation of women. The witch
cackled, "I am the lesbian suppressed
in every woman."

The second incident took place
as the women finished their theatre;

If Boss Comes On
Your Rights Go Out

If your boss fires you for re-
fusing to have sex with him, you
cannot sue for damages under the US
Civil Rights Act, a federal judge
in New Jersey ruled last month.
Instead, you should file a civil
suit charging extortion or swear
out a rape complaint.

The ruling came when US District
Court Judge Herbert J. Stern dis-
missed a suit brought by Adrienne
Tompkins, a stenographer for Public
Service Electric & Gas Co. She
charged that her supervisor fired
her after she refused to sleep with
him.

Tompkins' lawyer, Nadine Taub,
argued that the 1964 Civil Rights
Act protects women who are asked
to perform sexual favors at work.

But according to a November
Associated Press report, Stern said
that “sexual attraction is a natural
part of life and that federal courts
cannot become involved." However,
Stern did rule that Public Service
must still stand trial under the
Civil Rights Act on charges that
Tompkins was fired in retaliation
for making a complaint about her
boss.

The Civil Rights Act specifically
forbids retaliatory firings. That
clause has been used successfully.
The same week that the New Jersey
ruling came down, the New York Times
reported that a New York City ac-
count executive was awarded nearly
$89,000 in back pay from her former
boss. She had been fired after
accusing her employer of sex dis-
crimination in salary.

members of the Civil Disobedience
Squad blocked both exits and encir-
cled the remaining seven women. They
were shoved to the top of the
stairs, split into small groups and
were kicked and punched down four
flights. Six of the women required
medical treatment.

At the trial, the head of the
Civil Affairs Unit denied using
force against the women and claimed
the squad had merely removed them
from the building.

At one point in the trial, a wit-
ness for the women was asked by the
defense if she had had sex with
members of Dyketactics. When she
said no, he asked her if she was
a lesbian, a question she refused
to answer. The judge charged her
with contempt of court, but dropped
the charges after a session with

Feminist Women's Clinic Set

Dyketactics' lawyer, Holly Mayuigan

Mayuigan told the jury in her clo-
sing statement that a vote for the
women would be a vote against a
system of rough justice. She said,
"The plaintiffs have grievances
because they were punished for being
lesbians."

The defense told the jurors that
the women had "used the courtroom
for the gay rights movement."

The jury found that the women's
civil rights were not violated by
the police and did not award them
any damages.

In a press release issued after
the trial, the women said, "It was
our lesbianism, not police brutality
that was on trial." Despite the
outcome, Dyketactics plans to con-
tinue the struggle for basic human
rights as women and lesbians.

For Lawsuit Against Doctors

The Tallahassee Feminist Women's
Health Clinic has won a trial date
of November 29, in their case
against five OB/GYN physicians.

The case, to be heard in Talla-
hassee Federal Court, is commonly
referred to as "The Feminists vs.
the Doctors," and centers on the
attempts of the medical profession
to monopolize women's health care
and abortion services.

The central issue in the case
concerns "back-up" coverage for
women to see a doctor in case of
complications following an abor-
tion. The five doctors claim that
the FWHC's “back-up" is deficient
and therefore had "good reason”
for attempting to drive the FWHC
out of business.

The doctors' testimony at the
trial should be interesting. For
example, in August of 1975, Defen-
dant Dr. Crane was asked by the
FWHC to provide back-up service
for the clinic. He replied, “You
are not going to find any doctor
who will work with you unless you
stop advertising." He recommended
the clinic do something doctors in
the area could support; instead of
gynecological Self-Help clinics,
he said the FWHC should operate
self-help clinics for “obese
ladies." He said, "I just hate,
and I know other doctors hate
treating fat ladies, we just can't
seem to do anything with them."

In their efforts to find a "back-
up" doctor during 1975, most other
doctors refused to talk with FWHC
representatives.

The scale of justice, monetarily
speaking, is currently tipped in
favor of the defendants with the
backing of the Capitol Medical
Society, the Florida Medical Ass-
ociation, the Florida OB/GYN Soc-
iety and the American Medical
Association. The FWHC is confident,
however, that the defendants are
in a shaky position due to the
tremendous amount of evidence
already in the record that they
will have to explain.

The FWHC feels the outcome of the
trial will have a profound effect
on a number of facilities and doc-
tors throughout the country con-
cerning the method of national
health care delivery and women's
rights to control our bodies.
Women's facilities that are less
than "approved" by established
medical interests, especially
abortion clinics, should watch for
news of the trial with special
interest.
