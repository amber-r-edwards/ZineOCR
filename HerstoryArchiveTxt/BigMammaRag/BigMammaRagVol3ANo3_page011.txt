Dialogue With A Witch

once you had good fortune

to be an old hag

broken teeth bloated belly
furry breasts hanging

no more need for

lithe thighs expressed in clinging bikinis
passionate fucks by the sea
muscle tone relaxed years ago
no more planning for

moist lips on deserted beaches
no future in your ass

how to draw a pension?

what man will support you?
your brain is old and weak

you are not paying attention

only one log left to burn
fireplace empty like your bed
sleep alone

anger won't help

men just give you indigestion
your panties are iron now
raise cats

ignore judgments

from those terrible whispering children

Sisterhood is not Magic

Whatever did the witches do
They must have quarrelled beneath the stars

about how to ease the pain of wounds

With ergot,

or belladonna or

nasturtium.

And argued

taking long moonlight walks arm in arm,

About how to save the “devil's party”,

cj

_. where to meet most safely

And when a sister went on trial, Jacoba for example,
Even lovers among witches

must have disagreed over what would be
her best defense.

Disturbing a quiet constellation

in a July sky.

To some

their magic

seemed easy

But we

who often walk
in their footsteps
know better.

Summer 1973

Is it alright with you

if I love you not for who you are

or what you've done

but for the scent and taste and feel of you?

I am so tired of the games

the complications and conspiracies

If it's alright with you

I could dig the inspirations

of making love with you for no reason
but because I want to.

I ask for nothing but your touch
warmth and adventure in the night
I want to listen to the music

of your heartbeat

and kiss those lips that smile

Speak no words

but let us languish in togetherness
Our only common property -

being alive

in mutual exultation.

For Two Sisters

I think of you often
womanlove(rs)

sounds of your steps

up the cellar stairs

emerging from the basement
in the mornings

still drowsy with sleep
lovemaking on your breath
on your bodies

aura of smells and warmth enveloped you then

it wasn't the words we spoke

or the things we did together

that have stayed with/in me these years
but the touch of your closeness and
womandepth of your loving

that have become for me

a time worn mirror

into which I've often looked

seeking my reflection there

The Pole a Century Tall Or Being “‘Feminized”

“Women look so beautiful on poles”
Strong legs in Levis, feet in boots,

Hard hats, climbers, orange vests, gauntlet gloves

On the top you feel strong & free
Up there you look down
On the world all around

It took women a century to get to the top of this pole
Pain & sweat & determination every inch of the way

It took just 3 days to get pushed down
Look Ma no hands

“Give both hands for Ma Bell”

Pa Bell burned me off my poles
“Women’s hands are for typing.”
“Women’s legs are for miniskirts”
Give me back my strength & freedom
Give me back my climbers & belt

My hands feel crippled & strange

My legs feel numb

My brain is asleep

My heart cries out in anger & pain

God Bell sits on his heavenly throne in the sky

But we shall shake & shake & shake
Until fat daddy comes crashing down.

round round round round round round round round

round is woman

not as man supposes by breasts and buttocks

but because ends meet in circles

returning, rolling, processing cycles cycles cycles

A Platonic Friendship

At some point

In our searchings for each other
One of us always shies away
Where we might have touched

We talk.

We hold each other with our words
And do not find out

What would happen

If we tried

To hold each other's bodies.

Venom II

I wonder about the

tight-faced

work-worried women

in cloth coats and curlers

who collect in surly women crowds
spitting hate

in Birmingham or Boston.

I worry about their

sullen spite

collected in years of

shabby schools and sometimes jobs

poisoned and prodded

by habits

by fears

by landlords and leaders
who revile them

provoked and pitted

against their enemy's

enemy.

What turns class hatred
inside out?
freezes a longing for freedom
into splintered cries of ice
to pierce the heart
of those
Black people
who properly
are allies. 

What is the bridge
to you?

our struggle

must reveal it.

Winter 1974
