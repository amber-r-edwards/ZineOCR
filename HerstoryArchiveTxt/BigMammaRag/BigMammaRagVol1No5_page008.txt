Marie Loves Basctmase A Seery

By Debbie B.

Marie's apartment had a  
window which looked down onto  
the quiet street in the city,  
or onto the other old houses,  
or showed a hint of the mount-  
ains between the houses across  
the street. The mountains  
were the view Marie chose to  
look at this evening. They  
were why she had chosen to  
move to Denver. But Denver  
had become a cold, lonely,  
city for Marie. It contained  
few friends for her. She had  
been in Denver for almost a  
year, a year filled with few  
events but many memories of  
Rosemary. Rosemary was a  
close friend back East to  
whom she had written for a  
year at the small college  
Marie had graduated from last  
year, and where they both met  
in a small "Social Concerns"  
class the year before.

Marie was a good student in  
college, majoring in Sociology.  
In her senior year of studies,  
she was quiet and  
well liked by the others  
in the dorm. She dated occa-  
sionally but didn’t seem to  
adapt well in that atmosphere.  
It didn’t seem to bother Marie,  
but it did bother the few girls  
and at times her friends’  
parents reminded her,  
college was to find the  
one and only man for  
you to marry and how  
this if men like her.

Rosemary was outgoing,  
pretty and popular with the  
men. She had quit her sorority  
at the end of her sophomore  
year feeling it was silly and  
hypocritical. At the same time  
she became active in the  
peace movements on campus. Her  
sharp skirts and practical  
sweaters changed to blue jeans  
and work shirts. With all this  
change, her boyfriend had be-  
come critical and felt she was  
becoming too radical for his  
taste in women. Instead of  
trying to talk through her  
transition at Rosemary's pleas,  
he wanted the relationship to  
break up. So she gave back his  
fraternity pin with feelings  
of hurt and defeat but hoping  
he might really want her back,  
always hoping. But now her  
time was spent with Marie, and  
she enjoyed her moments totally  
alone with her.

When Marie was approaching  
her graduation, she wondered  
what was going to happen in  
the future. Her life philo-  
sophy was centered around the  
now time. Nothing was impor-  
tant in the past, nor should  
one worry about the future.  
All energy and emotion should  
be put into the present, the  
now. But the paradox appeared  
when she panicked at the  
thought of graduating and not  
coming back next fall to  
school. She had to make some  
plans for the future, something  
to look forward to. She de-  
cided it was a decision that  
Rosemary should have a part in  
also. They had talked about it  
off and on, but one day de-  
cided, since it was such a  
beautiful day, to go into the  
park and talk about both their  
futures.

They both loved to explore  
the park and thought they had  
explored all of it when they  
came upon a quiet, secluded  
part far from the road, the  
college, and any other person.  
That was where they both de-  
cided Marie should go on to  
Denver, to explore a new city  
and wait for Rosemary to grad-  
uate. Then Rosemary would  
join her in Denver, and they  
both would stay there or go on  
to San Francisco or Europe.  
That was also where Marie  
really saw the beauty in  
Rosemary's eyes and her  
emotions moved her enough to  
venture a touch on Rosemary's  
cheek with her fingers.  
Rosemary was not startled by  
the touch, she accepted it  
fully. Marie took her finger  
lightly down Rosemary's face  
to the side of her mouth.  
There she moved her finger  
over Rosemary's lips lightly,  
gently. Rosemary bent over  
Marie and kissed her on the  
lips, softly, delicately. Then  
again they kissed and again  
and their fingers ran through  
each other's long, brown hair  
that flowed on their bodies.

That was what Marie re-  
membered now of Rosemary, her  
softness, her beauty. Marie  
would get letters weekly and  
an occasional phone call to  
keep her memories of Rosemary  
flowing. Rosemary would soon  
join her, and they would be  
happily together again. Marie  
was certainly unhappy now, but  
in the future with Rosemary  
she would be happy, they would  
be happy.

The next few days in Denver  
passed slowly in Marie's life.  
Her horrible job in the office  
added to her misery with the  
people who mocked her for not  
being a part of their ugly  
world. But one day contained  
a letter from Rosemary which  
was greatly needed by Marie.  
She ripped it open reading  
rapidly. It read of trivial  
matters in Rosemary's last  
days at college, the papers  
due, the tests coming up, and  
more about some silly man  
Rosemary had met. This upset  
Marie; he was more a part of  
Rosemary's life with each  
letter. Marie became more  
frustrated while reading  
further about him. Then she  
came upon the passage in the  
letter that talked about  
Rosemary moving into an apart-  
ment with him after graduation.  
Nothing was mentioned about  
coming to Denver or being with  
Marie. All was about him and  
living with him.

Marie started pacing  
around the apartment furiously.  
She had no sense of things  
around her, nor could she see  
anything outside herself.  
Miraculously, she did not bump  
into anything but internally  
she bumped into every memory  
of Rosemary she possessed.  
Marie had something in her  
hand, heavy, hard, cold. She  
then saw it flying through the  
room crashing against the wall.  
She then heard a scream that  
started deep inside her and  
found its way out through her  
mouth.

Tears ran down her cheeks  
as she went to the phone. She  
became irritated when she  
couldn't readily find Rosemary's  
number. But why would she  
need it when she knew it by  
heart? She tried to steady  
her hand and read the numbers  
through the tears in her eyes.  
The numbers clicked away, the  
line connected, the ring,  
Rosemary's voice. Marie  
thought she would choke, no  
words would come out at first,  
but she was surprised at the  
ease in her voice.
