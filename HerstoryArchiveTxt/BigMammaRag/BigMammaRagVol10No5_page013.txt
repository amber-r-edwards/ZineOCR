“A Woman On Society's Terms: I Was Once An

Batya Weinbaum

Inductive reasoning is when
you go from the particulars
of the experience to the gen-
eral principle. From the small
to the large. From the inci-
dent to the rule. From the in-
side out.

This paper is about the im-
pact of institutionalization,
or how the mental hospital ex-
perience, supposedly designed
to make people better, makes
many worse.

I am qualified to write this
paper for several reasons. I
have been in therapy, various

think the system--particularly
around production and repro-
duction of sex roles--works.
In fact, once when in the
hospital I got an invitation
to keynote a conference about
women in the Netherlands,
talk about juxtaposition of
opposites, perceiving things
in the extreme, black and
white, high and low. In short,
when I come up with interpre-
tations, other people agree
with me and speak of how I
make their experience of the
world, if not more bearable,
at least more meaningful.

I emphasize this fact for

voices from our lives

kinds, off and on for the last
five years. The last year and
a half of which included four
institutionalizations in a
community mental health cen-
ter under what the psychiatric
profession would deem optimal
conditions--family near, plen-
ty of personal visits, and
the attention of a genuinely
concerned psychiatrist. All
through the experience I read
books--The Politics of Exper-
ience, by R.D. Laing; the
various popular novels about
the experience by Gordon, for
example, and Piercy; Bateson's
Ecology of Mind; books on de-
pression; psychiatric books
delineating the "borderline"
symptoms. Finally over the
past six months I began to
read sociological studies a-
bout mental institutions. I
am still trying to understand
why (the madman's question,
as defined by the culture;
see Zen and the Art of Motor-
cycle Maintenance). I got in-
volved in the institutional-
ization process, and why I am
so scarred by it.

My qualifications for gener-
alizing to theoretical explan-
ations based on this personal
experience also stem from the
fact that I have had a lot of
experience theorizing. From
the fact, I say. Not from de-
lusions of grandeur, not from
exaggeration or distortion—
but from the genuine factual
reality that I am a widely
published feminist theorist.
When I generalize from my ex-
perience, or reason inductive-
ly to explain the social re-
ality I live through in a new
way, people buy what I have
to say. They read it. They
pay me money to come speak to
them, to explain to them even
further the dynamics of how I

those who will discount what
I will say because I was stu-
pid enough to play the mental
patient in life's theatrics
of the absurd. This makes
what I have to say irrelevant
and unbelievable, you or the
society tells me. What I have
to say is automatically dis-
carded and swept away, read
or interpreted or heard as
yet another manifestation of
another symptom. In fact at
times, even I have been con-
vinced that for several years
the theories I was making up
were nothing more than my
schizophrenic ideas of refer-
ence. Once in lock-up (euphem-
istically called "special
care" on the unit) a guard
(euphemistically redesignated
“psych tech") said to me
point blank there was no
such thing as feminist theory.
He was sane, functioning I
was not; that I believed in
my work was an incidence of
my own insanity, he thought;
in vain I disagreed with him.

‘That was before the wear-
ing down of the hospital had
really gotten to me.

What kind of feedback did
I get in the hospital that
reduced me to believing an
uninformed psych tech's word?
A chorus of mixed voices
from patients, friends, fam-
ily, staff and doctor: put
away my writing, stop writing
books, give up all this lib-
erated woman bullshit; what
I needed was a man, somebody
else to anchor me, to have
children; wear make-up, go
to the beauty parlor, wear
my hair in curls; go into
the helping professions,
love my mother, learn to com-
municate with my family;
channel myself in a new di-
rection, stop taking initia-

tive, be passive, dependent
and obedient; stop thinking,
stop being intellectual, put
love before work, personal
relations before need for
shelter, other people before
self, emotional needs before
career ambitions; put off
graduate school, do things
for other people, get into
daily activities provided
for me, cooking; stop making
decisions, let other people
take care of me; I was no
authority, others knew more
than I what was best for me.
In short what I got was a
cancellation of my self, or
the parts of me which my adult
self had struggled to be; and
encouragement to become the
culture's definition of woman-
hood and femininity, synonymous
with being a mental patient,
or so it appears to me.
Consider the classic stereo-
type: can’t make decisions,
gets identity through other
people; economically irrespon-
sible; prone to emotional

came at once both. I once was
an independent female; now
I'm a tamed shrew. That's the
"humanizing" effect the hos-
pital had on me.

But the independent female--
let's evaluate just in how
far I was before this nervous
breakdown or more politely
called "depression" hit me
after the publication of my
first book. What I experienced
after the book came out was
more or less a loss of gender
identity. Back in New York
where I had been living and
where my problems began, I
was used to having my life
center around intellectual re-
lations with women. I was too
self-directed, smart and am-
bitious for many a man. For
example I protested when park—
ing my car that a date would
grab the steering wheel and
turn it right in my hands, ex-
plaining he was "just trying
to help me" innocently. Or
when someone else would want

to decide what I should eat

outbursts; gets off the topic
easily; can't be coherent or
logical; gets distracted eas-
ily; opinion of self based on
opinion held by other people;
ignorant of how the world
works; oversensitive; cries
easily; given to hysteria.
But the stereotype of the
female, or the mental patient?
It seems the same to me. Be-
cause trying to shove me into
the stereotypic female role
was such a rough fit, I be—

for me, or offer me his coat
needlessly. Or when I would
say I felt comfortable wear-
ing a scarf, and a date would
whip it off of my head, the
better to look at me.

that exists for them. Once I
asked a man if he wanted to
have children. Yes, he answer-
ed abashed, how did I know,
admiring my perceptive quali-
ties. "Because you are treat-
ing me like one,” I answered
him. Needless to say, that
relationship didn't go.

Before entering the hospi-
tal, I was typing up my jour-
nal, largely filled with anec-
dotes about my search for a
man, and calling it Notes on
Psychotic Men by a Psychotic
Woman: Or Dating in New York.
Somehow with the publication
of my book, the intensity for
my search became worse.

Partly because of society's
confusion on how to react to
a woman's coming-out-as-an-
intellectual ritual. The re-
action of society's primary
indoctrinating unit, the fam-
ily, was typical. My parents
reacted to this plateau in
my career by wanting to take

care of me. My mother was in-
sulted and offended (as she
usually is by me) that I was
able to organize my book par-
ty by myself. After all, her
services had been necessary

to organize my brother's wed-
ding for him, completely. My
father started to give me mon-
ey and wanted to buy me a coat
--his symbol of wanting to
protect me. I was made to feel
guilty, rejecting his econom-
ic offers of assistance at
first, as if I was crazy for
wanting to do things on my
own and in my own way. My
brother and his wife, though
invited, did not come to my
book party, and when I asked
my father why not, my father
informed me, "Don't worry,
they'll come to your wedding."
Although I hadn't planned
one. Given my success as a
writer but my failure as a
woman on society's terms,
this made me feel worse. At
the book party, I was told I
looked like a bride, as if
wearing something borrowed,
something old, something new
and something blue. . .I in-
vited every man I had gone
out with throughout my seven
years in New York, frantically
covering for the lack of a
single partner. The shrink I
was seeing came, pregnant to
the party, at which I served
vodka and knishes, a Jewish
dish frequently served at
rituals. Her pregnancy with
a child seemed to diminish
the importance of the birth
of my book.

I began to fly around the
country to do speaking en-
gagements, and when going
through the midwest, stopped
to visit my parents. When
was I going to have a baby,
my mother's cleaning lady
asked me; flippant then, I
asked, when was she going to
write a book. But each time
I flew back to my loft in
New York, I longed for a ba-
by, a man, and resolutely
pursued the building of my
career based on my accomp-
lishments, wondering if it
really had been my success
which was putting them off.

I was dumb, hopeful and
ambitious--then. I thought
that I had constructed a
step in my career, and I
proceeded to try to build on
it. But no. This is what led
to my breakdown or depression.
What I call the gap between
consciousness and social id-
entity. This gap creates the
craziness in this world,
in extreme cases such as
produces the mental patient.

In my consciousness, Book
One should have led to Book
Two, and the rewards should
have been greater, not less.
Doors should have opened for
me as a result of my own suc-
cess, not dictated by the
mores of medieval chivalry.
Instead I was unable to mar-
ket the ideas for my second
book successfully and was
backed into doing a series of
oda jobs once again. And ex-
cept for a few women's publi-
cations, nor could I get Book
One reviewed.

Instead of building up, I
had fallen down. My conscious-
ness might have been using the
sports metaphor of building
up, rung to rung, add another
ten pushups every workout,
but since the ladder of the
patriarchal social hierarchy
does not include a foothold
for women's work, domestic or
public, instead of stepping
up, I had fallen down.

And I had fallen flat. The
cost of living went up, while
my capacity to earn went down
in spite of my accomplishments.
Was this what success had
wrought me? I had the same
feeling as I did when as a
child I tried to crawl up-
stairs to the second floor of
my parents' two-story house.
My brother, the elder by three
years and always violent to
me, threw me back down just
as I reached the top of the
stairs. I experienced terror,

reeling backwards. When I hit
the bottom my mother didn't
pick me up, or touch me, but
towering above hands on hips
asked, “Whose fault is this?
Come on! Stop crying! Tell me!
I've had enough of this!"

But there was no mother at
the bottom now. No one to hit
up against, not like when as
a child in frustration I hit
my head against the wall. The
only one to hit up against
was myself.

Following thoughts, which
used to be a liberating pro-
cess learned in therapy from
my first shrink, became dan-
gerous for me. Following
thoughts in my mind became
like restless wandering in a
dangerous city. One wrong
turn, and I'd be in a bad
neighborhood. My mind, which
had once been like an octopus
with eight eyes wandering,
became a blank.

I became afraid to go on
the streets. I began to pick
up men just to maneuver a-
round, to get home from work
or just to get from post of-
fice to store on one of my
jobs. I decided to get out of
New York, I used the money my
father had given me to go to
an artists' colony to try to
re-center myself by writing,
as writing was a way I had
gained control and mastery in
my life previously.

Little did I know my prob-
lems would follow me. I became
afraid to drive. I found I
couldn't control the ups and

downs,

the free associating
in the car. I was trying to
finish a second book, a
theory of the workplace large-
ly developed by first-hand ob-
servations and analysis of
personal experience. I con-
tinued to develop the parad-
igm I was writing about anal-
yzing my current New York
jobs, or the ones I was leav-
ing; and I was writing about
the process of theory develop-
ment--my own--as well. But I
began to have the feeling that
I was being driven to the
back of my mind by the women's
movement. Not only was I con-
scious of the personal basis
of the theory (which is more
than most men are) but I was
exposing myself by writing
about it. Luckily I knew peo-
ple would be interested in

my story. Even so, the inten-
sity with which I was writing
and struggling with my own
confusion and passion was ev-
ident to all around me.

My parents began to tell me
to come home (a small town in
the midwest, home to them,
and where my childhood had
been) to go to the hospital.

I was scared, so it sounded
good, but I knew it was wrong.
My mother described the hos-
pital (she worked for a branch
of it) as a simple place where
you withdrew to re-evaluate
goals. That sounded nice, safe
I had left the shrink I was
seeing in New York. When you
