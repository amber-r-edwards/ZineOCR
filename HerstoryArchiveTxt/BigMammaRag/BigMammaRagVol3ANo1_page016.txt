— the poem must speak to the thing itself

— we humans forget that  
a blank page yields collage,  
the heart expands and contracts  
each must stand  
in her own sunshine  

For Anne Sexton  

When Plath died, you wrote:  

“Oh Sylvia, Sylvia... what is your death  
but an old belonging?”  

Now you've done it, too,  

Big Mama Rag  

Vol. 3-A, No. 1  

the death you said you had outgrown.  

You made a pact with your friend Max  
“to beat down death with a stick.  
To take over.” Saturday Max said  

The Prince and the no, it wasn’t your divorce,  

Princess it was life that depressed you.  

Life, that opened inside you “‘like an egg”  

The prince ran. . in your poem, a fiery child.  

The princess sat.  
I believed you, Anne,  

The prince stood up. when you said “Live, Jive,”  
The princess sat down. I thought it could be done.  
And now your death is a hole,  
The prince took a shit. a tear in my life that I won’t mend:  
The princess relieved herself. I need to know the death  

that killed your poems.  
The prince fucked.  
The princess made love. You wrapped your poems around your life,  
tracing your mother’s aging profile  
in your mirror, your daughter’s womanhood  
across your womb. “Mother worn and used,”  
you crooned: stroking Linda, touching me.  

The princess will now stand up and run  
to relieve herself of the fucking prince.  

Chocolate Waters  
Denver I thought that poetry had saved you,  
“middle aged witch,” Anne —  
I thought you had swallowed magic,  
not capsule bombs,  
had been delivered to me, an egg, a sun.  
But death, your boy, your baby  
won you with false promises  
of being “no more a woman  
than Christ was a man.”  

Not so, Anne, not for you  
or for me. With your mother and daughters  

and sad whiskey father,  

your pills and martinis  

and witch words flying around you,  

you cast your woman's spell on me.  

So that I sit here, Develop Your Self Image  
your poems across my desk, At The Gynecologist’s  
your name on all the shiny covers:  

ANNE SEXTON, as if I didn't know you,  
with your words beating in my mind When I was 14 I  
there was a big discussion  

Back and forth I rock  
your death against my breast.

Shecat  

Woman labors, giving  
birth to herself.  

Cocks and spit and hairy  
chests are all going down  
before this groan. Heads  
of everything are going  
back and forth, and men  

are nodding in their sleep.  

And it is men  

I will watch.  

I will see them wake,  
foaming in their froth,  
while the smooth strength  
of woman rises first  
and makes their way.  
And I will be glad  

for this child  

that grows alone,  
Singing in the night.  
Shecat  

Last Poem for a Lover  

I breathe,  
you smother.  

My prizes  
make your winning worthless.  

I have to bleed, you say,  
so you won't weep.  

The scraps won't feed us both,  
and neither will the feast.  

My nourishment makes you  
lean and yellow-eyed.  

Speaking without your will,  
I've nullified your being.  

The terms are yours,  
I can't reject them.  

It's you or me.

at my yearly checkup  
about whether to inject  
my breasts w/foam  

my mother and the doctor  
decided against it  
because w/time  

the stuff got crunchy  
rice krispie breasts  
they figured  

was worse  

than being  

small  

opinion  

I just lay w/my bare bottom  
on the examining table  
(they didn't use sheets  
in those days for  
adolescents)  

getting colder  

and colder  

and colder  

and littler  

and littler  

and littler
