British Racism

The British Government has ordered
an end to the use of virginity tests
on women arriving from India, Pakis-
tan and Bangladesh. The rationale for
the tests was that, if the women were
virgins, they were more likely to be
"truly engaged" to a man in England.
The program was ordered cancelled
following a public outcry.

Enough Is Enough

A judge in Ohio issued a temporary
restraining order to prevent an abor-
tion sought by a 15-year-old victim
of rape. The order was later dissolved,
allowing the young woman to have the
abortion on the condition a physician
be present to take blood and tissue
samples of the fetus. The restraining
order had been granted at the request
of the defense attorney who claimed
the abortion would destroy evidence
needed by his client to defend the
rape charge.

CIA Come-on

Kemba Maish, a Howard University
professor of psychology reports that
she was approached by the Central
Intelligence Agency to work as a CIA
agent in Africa. She said she received
a call from “someone...he said he
was black...and that he was the dir-
ector of some section of the CIA
which was recruiting black people,
specifically black psychologists to
go to Africa and develop profiles on
foreign nationals."

Maish said the CIA recruiter offer-
ed to pay her a "fantastic salary"
but that she turned it down and warned
that many African students in the
US are being approached to work as
CIA agents against the interests of
the people in their own countries.

Pill Politics

Where American women are increasing-
ly warned away from the pill and its
risks, women of Bangladesh and most
other "underdeveloped" nations, can
get their birth control pills every
month from the local cigarette vendor.

Healthright, the women's health
quarterly, recently reported on the
consequences of uncontrolled use of
the pill for these women and their
children. Sixteen percent of the
women are already pregnant and run a
serious risk of bearing an infant
with severe birth defects because of
pill use, while 90% of the women
taking the pill are breastfeeding
babies. The pill has been documented
to cause a drop in the milk supply,
resulting in malnutrition for the
living children.

Look But Don’t Touch

Three months after granting custody
of her two children to a lesbian moth-
er, a male judge has ordered that the
children be turned over to their fath-
er. The British judge, in his original
judgment, awarded the mother custody
along with severe restrictions on her
personal freedoms. He required that
she not live with another person with-
out court approval; he reversed his
decision after learning that the moth-
er had moved with her children to
Toronto from London to live with her
female lover.

Court Sense

"Lesbianism was only one of several
factors in deciding custody," wrote
Judge George Cook in a Michigan Cir-
cuit Court decision awarding custody
of four-year-old Jayson to his mother,
Raelynn Smith. "It is rather the kind
of care, the quality of care-- true
love, security, affection and counsel-
ing of discipline-- that are import-
ant. Thus, if two female homosexuals
can give that kind of care, it matters
not that they are lesbian nor does it
matter that the child is male or fe-
male." In making his decision in favor
of the mother, Cook cited testimony
that lesbianism is "not a disorder or
a disease, but a variation of female
sexuality."

The Tea We Drink

Revelations about the inhumane con-
ditions of workers on tea plantations
in Malawi have provoked investigations
by various trade union organizations.
Malawian children aged 8-12 are em-
ployed as tea pickers, work long hours
on a regular basis for 30 cents a day.
Midshift meals consist of ground
maize porridge and a morsel of dried
fish after each monthly payment
serves as incentive for higher pro-
ductivity. In addition to a diet
deficient in vitamins and protein,
flu and pneumonia are also plagues
which kill many child workers. Acci-
dents are rampant. What pass as clin-
ics on the plantations are ramshackle
sheds staffed by ill-qualified per-
sonnel. Most of the diseases which
are seen in the clinics could be trea-
ted at no cost to the companies, most
of which are British owned.

Depo Dealing

Although the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration banned the three-month inject-
able contraceptive, Depo-Provera, for
use in the US in 1978, hundreds of
thousands of women worldwide are still
being given the drug without any idea
of its dangerous side effects. UpJohn
Pharmaceuticals has appealed the FDA
decision and is requesting further
hearings to decide its future in the
states. Meanwhile, people are urging
that the ban be applied on a world-
wide basis, supplying authorities
with letters, documents and affidavits
substantiating the harm and serious
side effects of Depo-Provera.

Kidnapped

Among the estimated thousands of
Argentines secretly abducted by the
country's junta since 1976, there
are 57 pregnant women. The wherea-
bouts of these women and the babies
they should have delivered are still
a mystery. Most of the 18-34 year
old women were at least 5 months pre-
gnant when seized according to a
document prepared by the Permanent
Assembly of Human Rights in Buenos
Aires, to be given to the Human
Rights Commission of the US led Org-
anization of American States. The
women were kidnapped from their homes
by armed troops who sped away after
each raid in unmarked cars, often
with the women tossed into the trunks.
Meanwhile, the OAS Human Rights Comm-
ission visit to Argentina has been
postponed.

Scarlet Letter Bill

In June, the Health and Welfare
Committee of the Louisiana House ap-
proved a bill requiring that abortions
be recorded on state death certifi-
cates bearing the name, age, marital
status and address of the mother. The
bill now faces a vote in the full
House. Opponents dubbed the measure
"the Scarlet Letter bill" in refer-
ence to the Nathaniel Hawthorne story
of a woman forced to wear a red let-
ter "A" on her dress as punishment
for adultery.

children and great-grandchildren over

Valium Violence

A special grand jury in Arlington,
Virginia, empaneled to investigate
allegations of brutality and mistreat-
ment of women prisoners, has broaden-
ed its focus to include the use of
drugs to control prisoners' behavior.

According to the Washington Post,
more than 53% of the prescriptions
written by the jail's chief physician
were for valium, chloral hydrate and
dalmane, drugs used to relieve ten-
sion and stress. In the meantime,
Sheriff Elwood Clements told the news
paper he feels the jail has nothing
to hide and that the latest accusa-
tions are just a case of “jailitis."

All In the Family

On the basis of existing reports
and information from federal, state
and local government agencies, it is
estimated that there is some form of
domestic violence in 1/4 of all famil-
ies in this country.

The basic facts: one fourth of all
murders in the US occur within the
family (half of these are husband-
wife killings); one out of three fe-
male homicide victims is murdered by
her spouse; only 2% of the men who
beat their wives or living partners
are ever prosecuted; there is a strong
correlation between the husband's use
of alcohol (one study shows 50%) and
incidence of wife beating.

Heaven Can Wait

Joan Clark, who since 1973 had
been a staff executive for the wo-
men's division of the United Method-
ist Church, gave the denomination's
Board of Global Ministers a state-
ment declaring her lesbianism as part
of a report on sexuality she research-
ed during a leave for professional
development. The six-member commit-
tee requested and received her resig-
nation, but the 75-member division
turned down the recommendation and
Ms. Clark subsequently withdrew her
resignation.

Pressure from leadership and indivi-
dual pastors was brought to bear and
in the final hours of the meeting in
May, the division reversed its deci-
sion; Clark refused to resubmit her
resignation and her employment was
terminated. In firing Clark, the
Central Texas Conference Board of
Global Ministers said, “we affirm her
as a person but do not affirm her
lifestyle."
