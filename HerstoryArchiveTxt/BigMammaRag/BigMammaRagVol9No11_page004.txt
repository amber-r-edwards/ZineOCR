TERRA Exposes Turkeys

Laura Carlson

On Saturday Nov. 22 and Sun-
day Nov. 23, members of TER-
RA (a local feminist group)
brought "The Real Thanksgiv-
ing Story" to eight shopping
centers in the Denver area.
On Nov. 25, two TERRA women,
dressed as Pilgrims, followed
up with leafleting of the
downtown Denver lunch hour
crowds.

A three minute skit drama-
tized a condensed history of
relations between Native Am-
ericans and white settlers
from the first Thanksgiving
feast. Instead of acting out
the traditional story of
"brotherly" love between ra-
ces, the players showed ear-
ly dependence and greed of
the settlers. An accompanying
leaflet described how, in
reality, John Smith and com-
pany very quickly betrayed
the goodwill of the Natives.
They stole fields cleared by
the Natives for their own use

and began a history of plun-
der and land theft that con-
tinues to this day.

TERRA used the skit as a
timely educator on the strug-
gle for Native land rights.
The group solicited funds
and food for Yellow Thunder
Camp (See BMR, Oct. 1981) and
The American Indian Movement
sponsored reclamation of Na-
tive lands in the Black
Hills. The group raised over
$50 and distributed over a
thousand leaflets.

Response to the skit and
leaflet was mixed, ranging
from racist hostility to ap-
athy to curiosity and warm
support. Native land rights
struggles along with repro-
ductive rights and anti-
uranium industry work are
TERRA's three areas of acti-
vism. For more information
come to a meeting of the
group, Thursday, 6:45 to
8:00 at 737 17th Ave. in
Denver, or call 399-4243 or
