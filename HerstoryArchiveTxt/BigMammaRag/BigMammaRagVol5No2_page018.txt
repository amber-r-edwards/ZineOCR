Casse Culver Gives Lesbianism A Country Flavor

Cheryl and KR

Casse Culver was in Denver last  
December visiting a friend. On the  
15th, she sang at the Velvet Hammer.  
A few days later, she was dragged  
from the pool table to give the fol-  
lowing interview.

Casse: How does my music relate to  
my politics? Well, my music is com-  
ing out of a personal space, ok? Be-  
cause I'm living in a sexist and ra-  
cist society and a homophobic society  
a lot of my songs are coming out of  
that influence. You know, being op-  
pressed. I think I came out as a  
lesbian when I was 22; I was writing  
love songs for women 10 years ago.  
I'm 32 now, right? Just that very  
act of writing a love song to a woman  
is a political act in this society.  
But then in '73--I was singing my  
women-identified songs for all those  
years--but in '73, when I moved to  
Washington DC, I was introduced to a  
lesbian political community.

What happened was my music was put  
into a political framework, an overt  
political framework. The music it-  
self is political because the person-  
al is political. So that's how it  
relates; so when I'm singing to a  
lesbian and women audience, I'm put-  
ting it in a political context and  
heightening the political content.  
But, I'm doing songs like "Good Old  
Dora", which is about God, but a fem-  
ale vision of what the spirit of life  
should be all about instead of a pa-  
triarchal vision. I wrote that song  
in '69 before I was introduced to  
lesbian feminism.

BMR: So how did lesbian feminism  
change you?

Casse: The most dramatic change was  
that I finally had an audience. I  
had been singing in straight bars and  
clubs, and I was singing my women-  
identified material. Things would  
get pretty hot because the audience  
would react really weird. So when I  
started singing to lesbians specifi-  
cally, I really found an incredibly  
energizing supportive atmosphere for  
my music.

At the first National Women's Music  
Festival--I went there, and that ini-  
tiated a lot of contacts across the  
country. So with my partner at that  
point, Spots, I went across the coun-  
try, and it was like finding heaven  
after being in hell. It was just  
great. Here was this validating ex-

perience for both myself and the au-  
dience. And I've been doing that for  
2-1/2 years, singing almost exclusiv-  
ely to lesbian feminist or lesbian  
audiences.

It's really a privilege to be ear-  
ning money in this way. Pretty much,  
I'm earning a living, $4,000 to $5,000  
a year, something like that. Which  
is enough to live off of if you're  
careful. So that's the most dramatic  
way that my life has been changed and  
also it made me realize that my songs  
are political. Before I thought that  
politics were when you went to the  
polls and voted, and I would have  
none of that shit anyway. It didn't  
have anything to do with where I was  
at--being a lesbian and a street sin-  
ger--it didn't touch my life partic-  
ularly. Putting my music into a po-  
litical context just heightened the  
politics that were already there be-  
cause of the personal being political.  
Also, it got me in touch with other  
people's struggles; it got me to con-  
front my own sexist attitudes, and it  
got me to confront my racism. Just  
made me a more sensitive person to  
the oppression of the patriarchy.

BMR: Holly Near defines herself as  
a cultural worker, how do you relate  
to that?

Casse: Well, I relate to that pretty  
easily. I feel that the patriarchal  

culture we're living in, since it  
pervades our every second, because  
the ruling class which is white and  
male has control of the technology,  
it feels that indeed I am involved in  
a cultural revolution. So, I can  
relate to the idea of being a cultur-  

al worker, and I have described my-  
self like that on occasion. How I  
do my work may be different than the  
way Holly does her work, with the em-  
phasis on the struggles she's in-  
volved in. But it seems pretty clear  
to me that I'm involved in a lesbian  
cultural underground and that I'm  
part of building the underground.

And that has responsibilities that  
go along with it. Like making sure  
that everybody is remunerated for her  

work, not just the artists, but the  
people who put on the concert and the  
people who spent a whole lot of time  
setting the whole thing up in various  
cities. I have found that a whole  
lot of women don't take themselves  
seriously yet. They're still doing  
this volunteer labor bullshit.

I think it’s really important for  
the audience to understand the econo-  
mics of our small numbers; when we  
have small numbers, the ticket prices  
have to be higher, and everyone has  
to share a greater burden of the  
whole thing. When our audience ex-  
pands, the ticket prices can either  
stay the same or go lower, unlike  
patriarchal economy, which has ticket  
prices really cheap because labor is  
not taken seriously; then when they  
quote, become a star, unquote, they  
capitalize on that and raise the ti-  
cket prices, and you're paying $4.50  
to $8.50 to fill up a 4,000 seat au-  
ditorium.

Right now the economics are such  
that each of us has to bear a greater  
load: the performer, the producer,  
and the audience. In that respect,  
when I talk about being a cultural  
worker, I mean myself and the produ-  
cer, and the audience all working to-  
gether to make a space for ourselves  
to experience our culture, the les-  
bian and women's experience from the  
inside out. Which, is all we've got,  
we've only got our internals, we're  
not externally supported at all. We  
have to come from the inside out.

I think it's really interesting to  
see how many people it takes to put

together a concert. Like this last  
little cultural event we had here in  
Denver at the Velvet Hammer--Susan  
Binder coordinated the whole thing,  
Cheryl with her van was real neces-  
sary, Marilyn had the sound system,  
Kathy let us use the piano, Linda  

let us use the space. It took energy  
to get all those things together, to  
get it set up and it took me and my  
work and the audience coming to make  
it happen--I think it's really impor-  
tant to publicize the financial sit-  
uation, what the gross receipts were,  
what the expenses were and who got  
what at the end of the concert. I  
think if we publicize the finances we  
will demystify the process and show  
the women who pay the $2.00 to come  

where their money is going.

This applies to our work as les-  
bians and as women because women have  
traditionally been totally unpaid for  
their labor in the patriarchal soci-  
ety. It seems really important to  
me that we take ourselves seriously  
and demand that green energy for our  
labor. Unfortunately women, lesbians  
especially, have very little money;  
there's just not a lot of money  
around. Paying ourselves is just a

real dilemma.

For me, it's stepping over the bar-  
rier and getting away from exclusive-  
ly women or lesbian events and start-  
ing to move out into the enemy camp  
and play my music in more traditional  
spaces once again. Because I have a  
support group I draw my energy and  
resources from, I can start going out  
and playing country and western music  
which I like to do. I can play in  
country and western clubs and summer  
music festivals and start reaching  
out to other women who are on the  
fringes, at the same time make more  
money for me so I don't have to tot-  
ally rely on what little resources  
women and lesbians have.

BMR: Country music usually is con-  
sidered the pits in terms of femin-  
ism. Could you talk about why you  
like it and play it?

Casse: Country music, before it be-  
came super marketable, spoke directly  
to people's lives. It was earthy mu-  
sic, not pretentious, downhome and  
gut-level. It spoke to problems:  
going grocery shopping, taking care  
of the baby and getting laid off  
work, basic reality.

I like the chord structures, they  
are easy to learn and that's impor-  
tant to me because music belongs to  
the people. It's not the private  
property of the super well educated  
musician. I tried learning music  
when I was a kid and I was a total  
failure at it. But here I am, I'm  
doing music, so music should belong  
to the people. I write with simple  
chords and I've been put down for it  
mostly by male musicians, but women  
can pick my music up right away and  
play it. For example, Marilyn sat  
down and learned one of my songs in  
a half hour.

I have a tremendous amount of re-  
spect for Tammy Wynette. That woman  
was a hairdresser before she was a  
mother alone with a couple of kids  
and happened to write a couple of  
songs and went into this music pub-  
lisher. She had been beating the  
pavement for a long time with her  
songs. She sings songs women in her  
cultural space can really relate to,  
like D-O-I-V-O-R-C-E.

BMR: What kind of feedback have you  
gotten from the strong lesbian stand  
you've taken in your music?

Casse: I've had some people tell me  
to take it easy. That I would do bet-  
ter if I didn't take such a strong  
lesbian stand and the thing that I  
see is that I do not have as large an  
audience as Cris Williamson or Meg  
Christian, who have not been as mili-  
tant in their lesbianism. I watched  
their audiences grow, and my audience  
pretty much stayed the same. I think  
that has something to do with the  
fact that I'm very upfront about my  
lesbianism.

I felt I owed that to myself and to  
the women because lesbianism fucking  
saved my life. If I hadn't acted on  
my lesbian impulses, I would be a  
crazy woman in a mental institution  
or probably be a suicide statistic.  
So I feel I owe this to myself and to  
other lesbians to reinforce our  
strengths, but that cost me something.  
I know I won't be able to do that  
when I go into the enemy camps be-  
cause that's suicide singing my woman-  
identified songs.

I think there are double factors  
there, they have albums out. Our  
audiences started out equal and their  
audience became greater, but that's  
also because they are doing more pop  
music, music that women are more  
tuned into. I'm talking about white  
middle class women, which is the ma-  
jority of the lesbian feminist move-  
ment, at what I can see, being white  
middle class myself. Because playing  
music in this culture is a fucking  
privilege, because if my father and  
mother's money had not supported me  
in some way I don't know if I would  
be doing what I'm doing now. So I  
feel playing music in this culture is  
a privilege. So that's why I see  
that most of the musicians we see in  
the forefront of lesbian music are  
white and middle class.

I get real strong about taking my  
power back.

Also the fact that I play country  
western music; as you say, a lot of  
people think of country and western  
music as the pits.

My future visions right now are  
really moving out into a space where  
the patriarchy is not so evident. And  
that's mostly the wasteland, where  
they haven't found ways to capitalize  
on these lands, like the desert and  
the foothills. I'm thinking about  
moving to the southwest and forming  
a women's community. That's really  
my vision, starting to live off of  
the land, like 80% off of the land  
and only 20% off my music. I don't  
know how soon I can do that, I'd  
like to do it soon, though.

I live in the middle of the city,  
in Washington DC. I live in a real  
nice apartment. My lover and I have  
a very nice arrangement; my future
