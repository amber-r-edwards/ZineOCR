Politics of Health

Blue

~~~ Health, it’s said, is wealth, but
for whom? What does it mean to
be healthy, wealthy, and wise?
Why has “health” become the
handiest adjective to push any
product into a market basket:
health shoes, health foods,
health pills, health books, health
insurance? If it is true that a
healthy mind resides in a healthy
body, is health only a personal
matter?

Health is politics, and it is
important for the movement to
analyze and understand the
politics of health. The word
“politics” implies an overall
strategy or scheme, an organiza-
tion for an end. In our patriarchal
capitalist society, both the con-
cept of health and the means to
health have been appropriated
into a more general politics.
There is a strategy; there is an
organization, whether conscious
or unconscious, for an end. That
end is unhealthy for women. Its
result may be first to sever us
from our money, but it is finally
to alienate us from our bodies
and to sabotage our strength, or
independence, and our effectiveness.

It would be simplistic to im-
agine that we could identify as
villain any one agency of the
patriarchy: the food industry, the
AMA, the drug manufacturers,
the advertising agencies, or the
health pundits. Nevertheless,
we can identify an overall cycle
to which each one of these
agencies contributes. It is this
cycle which makes health a
political issue.

The phrase “to take control of
our bodies” has become a move-
ment slogan, but its relevance
has thus far been limited to the
issues of birth control and abor-
tion. When we begin to examine
the cycles of dependencies to
which we are all, to a greater or
lesser extent, enslaved, it be-
comes clear that we have lost
control of much more than just
our reproductive functions: we
are risking the total loss of our
basic strength, our vital
energies, our profoundest
health...

There are many individual
cycles that could be identified
here, cycles from which the
patriarchal society and its in-
dustries benefit, but they all
involve the notion of consump-
tion as a “cure,” whether the
consumption be that of food,
alcohol, or drugs, weeks at a
health spa, or lifetimes on one or
another health scheme. The
basic organization of these
cycles is tripartite: first there is a
state or quality of life which is a
norm, something the society,
either literally or metaphorically,
calls “health”; next there is a
reaction to that state, a dis-ease
which generally in this society
involves depression or anxiety;
finally there is the ‘cure’ which
allows us to reenter the cycle
where it began, in the “health”
of the norm. By reentering it, we
consent to it; by consenting to it,
we reinforce its possession of
and power over our lives.

All feminist analyses, even
most enlightened or liberal
patriarchal analyses, agree that
this society is sick. The con-
ditions under which we live
include an exploitative sexual
caste system, a materialistic
definition of success, the tyran-
ny of a heterosexual family
pattern, the fear of the body, and
the idealization of the isolate self
in hard competition for the
trophies of power: position and
property. It is no wonder that our
bodies rebel.

This rebellion takes the form
of disease. It may be generalized
— a vague depression, sleep-
lessness, unrelieved tension or
anxiety, any of the symptoms
and strategies of neurosis. Or it
may be specific: gastro-
intestinal disorders, heart at-
tacks, cancer. The theory that
disease is psychosomatic, the
body's expression of the mind’s
torment, seems, in this analysis,
both apt and attractive: when we
cannot choke down or digest
what is offered us, it is not
probable that our alimentary
systems will go askew? In a
society systematically neglec-
ting the centers of life, is it any
surprise that hearts cease to
function? When there is always
something eating at us, isn’t it
probable that cancerous
growths will seem a literal
realization of a persistent
metaphor? A dis-ease,
generalized or specific, is a
warning; it is a message that
something has gone deeply, per-
haps permanently, wrong.

It is well known that the patri-
archal medical system tends to
treat the symptom rather than
the cause. In this strategy, the
ailment, and not the warning it
embodies, becomes the focus. If
depressed, we take pills to pep
us up and pop us back into the
conditions which depressed us
in the first place. If anxious, we
are soothed by chemicals that
allow the anxiety-producing
conditions to remain intact. If
chronically empty, chronically
hungry, we fill ourselves with
non-nutritious, even potentially
poisonous, food; we become
chronic overeaters. The treat-
ment of more advanced specific
diseases often constitutes the
same patching and propping, the
surgical and chemical repair-
work which reinserts the robot
into the intricate machinery
which first mangled and maimed
it. And then, of course, the cycle
begins again.

All of this we submit to,
understandably, because it falls
into the established patriarchal
notions of health and healing.
We believe our doctors; we mis-
trust our senses. If we have
obediently consumed our food
and medicines, faithfully under-
gone our treatments, we feel we
must be healthy. But the con-
ditions which produce sickness
are still there and will remain
there until we transform the
patriarchal politics of health into
a feminist politics of healing.
Treating the symptom rather
than the cause, managing day-
to-day, ignoring, adjusting to, or
even smothering each new
warning — all this is the essence
of reform. It tinkers with the
details only to leave the basic
structure unaltered. We need,
here as elsewhere, a politics of
revolution: we need an overall
strategy, a scheme, an organiza-
tion for an end, a way to cleanse
ourselves not only of our symp-
toms but also of the causes
which perpetuate them.

It is hard to know where to
begin. Health, as it has been
defined for us, is a compromise,
an evasion, and our age seems
too complex, too deafened by
historical and intellectual
definitions of health, to hear
clearly the voice of healing.
Nevertheless, we might begin
with the simple understanding
that our health is now the
system's wealth: it is a capturing
of our money, a sapping of our
energy, an appropriation of our
bodies.

If we are to become indep-
endent of the medical establish-
ment, we must reclaim what we
have lost. We must re-establish
faith in our bodies’ natural
warning and healing systems,
knowledge of the traditions of
women's healing skills (herbal
and naturopathic), and con-
sciousness of what constitutes
and perpetuates true health.

With our bodies in our own
control, our potential is barely
conceivable. We would cer-
tainly recapture our spiritual,
intellectual, and physical
heritage, the reality of a healthy
mind in a healthy body; we might
even begin to actualize such
now dormant faculties as self-
healing, telepathy, or partheno-
genesis.

To begin a feminist politics of
healing, we first need to analyze
the patriarchal politics of health.
Next, we must consider how
best to render patriarchal health
cycles and dependencies in-
effective: is it a private or a public
struggle? Is it a more practical
target for small groups or for
widescale programs? What
aspects of the struggle lend
themselves to massive re-
education efforts? Which are
more appropriate for wide-
spread political organizing?

In future articles, we hope to
examine both the causes and the
possible solutions for the con-
junction of attitudes and agen-
cies which constitutes the
patriarchal politics of health. We
would appreciate articles, ideas
or information which might help
us begin disentangling our
health from their wealth and
establishing a truly radical, even
revolutionary, politics of healing.

Officials Unresponsive
to Child Care Needs

Carol Hille

On the evening of October 29,
the cafeteria at the North Cam-
pus of Community College was
crowded, mostly with women,
many of whom will be hit hard-
est by the new State regulations
on eligibility for child care
assistance, and Federal Title XX
regulations raising the ratio of
children to attendants in day-
care. The audience had come to
listen to a panel of legislators
and local officials of the
Colorado Social Services, hop-
ing to have some questions
answered concerning their
plight.

The meeting was what its
primary organizer, Ms. June Bel-
ker of Community College, North
Campus, called an “infor-
mational rally.” The information
they got was, essentially, that
there was not enough money in
the State budget to take care of
their needs and that they will
have a hard time getting those
with the most control over State
money to listen to their dif-
ficulties.

Issues Evaded

The meeting was kept in strict
order. The big questions were
either unasked or unanswered.
One young woman, about to be
forced out of college because
she did not qualify for child care
assistance under a ruling that
allows it only to those who have
only one year of training left,
asked angrily how many men
would be forced out of school be-
cause they couldn't get their
children cared for. She was
called to order, and no further
comment was ever made on that
particular subject. Un-
mentioned also was Ms. Bel-
ker’s statement that the
penalties attached to mother-
hood are unjust. The meeting
was kept in such excellent order
that the officials, several of
whom appeared to be extremely
bored and exasperated, manag-
ed to leave without having to do
more than reiterate that there
was no money in the budget for
child care.

Some of the panelists who
were not there were of interest:
Dr. Foley had been invited, but
declined. Arie Taylor was to have
come, but was called away by
State Business and could not
attend.

The meeting did give women a
certain amount of clarification of
the situation they must contend
with. Some seemed to be un-
aware that the enforcement of
the new restrictions on who may
receive child care assistance is
already under way; under Title
XX, states are at liberty to decide
what constitutes eligibility for
such assistance. Colorado has
eased its tight budget by cutting
out many mothers receiving
child care assistance. The wel-
fare that these mothers will have
to accept instead of supporting
themselves and their children is
a Federal expenditure.

The enforcement of the crippling
ratios instituted by the
Federal government on the
number of children to the number
of attendants has been de-
ferred until early next year, and
Judy Cercke of Pat Schroeder's
office tried to reassure the
audience that on the Federal
level, at least, some attempt is
being made to have these ratios
corrected. As they stand, they
will put many or most home-care
and day-care centers out of
business.

Money

The theme of the entire
meeting was money; it was set
by Dave Ashmore, Director,
Division of Title XX, Colorado
Department of Social Services.
Money was the reason, he said,
for the new tighter restrictions
on mothers; there was no money
budgeted for adequate child
care, much less to accommodate
the new Federal restrictions.
However, the question as to why
no more money had been ap-
propriated for child care
assistance was asked. Child care
assistance money comes out of
the Social Services kitty; Gary
Angerhofer, Chief Planning Sec-
tion, Office of Planning and
Evaluation, seemed to indicate
that the allocation had been
made on the basis of percen-
tages of the budget used in
previous years.

According to Ms. Belker, Bob
Rease, Social Service Rep-
resentative for HEW, had
volunteered to come to the
meeting and try to answer some
questions for those concerned.
He was sympathetic, but had
little to offer in the way of
suggestions for mitigating the
situation, although he deplored
the fact that unused funds from
surrounding states could not,
under Title XX, be transferred to
the needs of Colorado.

Byron Wight, Executive Direc-
tor of Mile-High Child Care
Association, while conceding
that the problem was lack of
money, insisted somewhat hotly
that more of the money avail-
able should be allocated for child
care assistance, on the grounds
that children will suffer if such
budget corrections are not
made. Kay Dowd, Child Care Co-
ordinator for Boulder, expressed
concern that these cuts in child
care might signal a trend to-
ward elimination of Social Ser-
vices.

Class Action

The representative of Denver
Legal Aid present, Bill Benjamin,
indicated that laws, rather than
money, are the problem. He said
that when money gets tight, the
laws get bent to accommodate
short budgets, and that those
suffering from the cutbacks in
child care assistance should
take their difficulties to the
courts. One of the audience
asked Mr. Benjamin if a class
action suit on grounds of sexual
discrimination could be filed in
this matter. He indicated that it
might be possible.

The fundamental problem,
according to Regis Groff, State
Senator, is that the budget is in
the hands of politicians for
whom human issues come last
and least; that those suffering
from the effects of their al-
locations must write letters to
the legislature and pack
meetings where the State's
finances are disposed of. He took
the audience somewhat to task
for allowing the situation to be-
come critical before trying to do
something about it. According to
Senator Groff, the only way for
day-care mothers to gain their
needs is to make certain that
those in charge of the funds cannot
ignore them.

And After

As the meeting broke up,
groups of home-care mothers
and day-care center owners
stayed, talking in groups. They
have been fighting the new
restrictions mostly without help
or notice, and their tone is
cynical and distressed. Most of
them will be put out of business
by the new laws. With mothers
now aware of the hardships they
face because of these laws, they
may, at last, find themselves with
some important backing. What
women can do for the im-
mediate future, several people at
the meeting indicated, was to
support Senate Bill 24-25,
which would provide additional
funds for implementation of Title
XX regulations. Senator Haskell
is supporting this bill, and needs
all the interested backing he can
get.
