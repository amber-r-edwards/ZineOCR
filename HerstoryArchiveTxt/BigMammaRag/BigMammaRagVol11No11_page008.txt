U. S. Imperialism Fails To Weaken The

Silvia Baraldini

On September 3, 1983 the
case of U.S. vs. Sekou Odinga
ended with defeat for the

U.S. government. Our trial
which the government hoped
would be a showcase for their
strategy of criminalization
of the New Afrikan national
liberation struggle and its
anti-imperialist allies,
became another front for the
revolutionary movement to
defend people's fundamental
human right to self-deter-
mination and independence.
The government was defeated
because those of us on trial,
led by the New Afrikans,
pursued a strategy that
countered charges of racke-
teering, bank robbery and
murder with an uncompromi-
sing defense of the New
Afrikan Movement, its right
to wage armed struggle to
pursue its liberation, and
the role of the anti-imperialist
movement to fight in defense
of the right of oppressed
nations to self-determination.

Those of us who were con-
victed, New Afrikan Freedom
Fighter Sekou Odinga and my-
self, Silvia Baraldini, mem-
ber of May 19th Communist
Organization, convicted of
racketeering conspiracy and
actually participating in
the liberation of BLA member
Assata Shakur (slave name
Joanne Chesimard) and for
Sekou one expropriation in
Danbury, Ct. We view our
conviction as an affirmation
of the need for revolutionary
struggle in this country,
and in particular the New
Afrikan Independence move-
ment. New Afrikan revolu-
tionary artist Bilal Sunni-
Ali was absolved of all
charges. Iliana Robinson
was found not guilty, and
New Afrikans Jamal Joseph
and Cecilio Ferguson guilty
of accessory after the crime
for aiding N.A.F.F. Mutulu
Shakur after the attempted
expropriation of October 20,
1981 in Nyack, NY.

Central to the trial was
the struggle against U.S.
imperialism, the continued
colonialization of the Black
nation and the development
of armed struggle over the
last 20 years within the
ranks of the New Afrikan
independence movement. The
liberation of freedom fighter
Assata Shakur illustrates
better than any other action
the issues of our trial. By
liberating one of its lead-
ers, the Black Liberation

Army showed its commitment
to the liberation of its
people because Assata Shakur
has become a symbol of the
resistance to the daily opp-
ression experienced by Black
people. Prisoner-of-War Sun-
diata Acoli, who was called
by Sekou Odinga as a defense
witness, talked eloquently
about why Black revolution-
aries initiated the armed
struggle in the late 1960s.
He spoke both about the

less others rebelled and
took up arms to free their
people from the yoke of
slavery. Two distinct strat-
egies emerged for the lib-
eration of Black people. One
advocated integration into
the United States. The other
recognizing that even with
the end of slavery, the col-
onial status of Blacks was
not ended but transformed
into an oppressed nation
whose citizens were force-
fully kept in semi-feudal
conditions, whose labor was
exploited; whose men, women
and children lived under the

constant terror of both
police forces and organized
white supremacist gangs, ad-
vocated a struggle for in-
dependence focused on the
south. Black people who
through their labor, crea-
tivity and civilization had
transformed the South into
one of the richest regions
of the United States and had
created part of the surplus
capital that enabled the
United States bourgeoisie
to expand and wage war a-
gainst Native American na-
tions in the West and Mexico.

During the Civil War Black
people had demanded land and
reparations; instead after
a few years of democracy under
Black Reconstruction, they
found themselves re-enslaved
through the system of share
cropping. Liberation of the
Black Belt South remained
the focus of Black nation-
alism. The necessity for in-
dependence was not diminished
by the advent of reforms
gained after tremendous bat-
tles that spanned and cul-
minated in the civil rights
struggle. The lessons to be
learned from this history of
struggle was that fundamental
conditions of Black people
would remain the same unless
they fought for independence.

New Afrikan Independence
movement was born and all
conscious citizens (those
who took the oath) committed
themselves to the liberation
of the New Afrikan nation.

The Role of the Armed
Struggle

Resistance to the continued
colonization of Black people
always included actions of
armed resistance. In the
late 1960s Black revolu-
tionaries began to build a
formal underground. Recog-
nizing that freedom could
not be achieved through
voting, demonstrations or
petitioning, faced with a
counterinsurgency program
aimed at the elimination of
Black resistance, they em-
barked on armed struggle.
Units formed and took the
name of the Black Liberation
Army. From 1971 they tar-
geted the police because
they are the military force
that represents U.S. imper-
ialism in their communities;
they liberated a number of
their members who were held
captive inside prisons; and
they carried out expropria-
tions to finance their stru-
ggle. Increasingly the poli-
tical focus of their action
was the liberation of New
Afrika. The armed struggle
