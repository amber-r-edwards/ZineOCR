“Rooming-in” Outdated?

This is a column for men and  
children as well as for women.  
This is a column about the first  
hours and days of child care.  
Since the woman is central  
physiologically in the childbirth  
process, we must reclaim our  
rights from the hospital and the  
doctor. This means knowing  
what is available today in the  
hospital, knowing what we want  
and why we want it. This means  
having the facts that give us the  
courage to stand against male  
mate and male doctor if their  
opinions are different than ours.  
(The subject here is limited to  
hospital deliveries though some  
of the ideas may relate to home  
delivery as well.)

“Rooming-in” refers to the  
newborn child’s remaining with  
the mother in her room almost  
immediately after birth through  
discharge from the hospital. This  
was the usual arrangement in all  
U.S. hospitals until the turn of  
the century, and there never has  
been nurseries for normal new-  
borns in most European  
hospitals. So why did the new-  
born nursery, with strictly  
limited parent-child interaction,  
become the norm in this coun-  
try? I have been able to find only  
suggestions, not definite  
answers.

Possible Answer  
One possible answer is the  

worry over infection. It should be  
remembered that at this time  
most deliveries were still done at  
home. Women entering the  
hospital were often otherwise ill  
or had problem pregnancies. These  
women and their babies went to  
large open wards rather than to  
rooms of two to four women as is  
done today. Screening techni-  
ques for disease organisms  
were primitive or nonexistent, so  
an infected woman's bacteria or  
virus literally flew around the  
ward finding easy prey in the  
debilitated women and the new-  
borns. However, it has since  
been clearly shown that  
“rooming-in” is actually safer  
than nurseries with respect to  
infection.

At the turn of the century, a  
French doctor, Pierre Budin, was  
busy popularizing nurseries and  
incubators for premature in-  
fants. Budin sent a young stu-  
dent, Martin Cooney, to exhibit  
his methods at fairs in England  
and the United States. Cooney  
finally settled on Coney Island  
where, in 39 years, he raised  
over 5,000 premature infants.

Why the ideas for premature  
infants came to be applied to all  
infants may have to do with  

Cooney’s commercial success.  
For whatever reasons, nurseries  
soon became the rule in our  
hospitals. With this separation  
often went other rigid rules  
which discouraged breast  
feeding and depersonalized the  
childbirth process. Healthy  
women, eager to care for their  
new children, were treated as in-  
valids. Fathers were often  
treated as intruders.

Today there is a swing back to  
“rooming-in” and other more  
open procedures, but this swing  
has been slow getting started.  
The roots go all the way back to  
some problems recognized by  
Budin and Cooney, who ran into  
many trouble spots as well as  
benefits with their procedures.  
One big problem was getting  
mothers to accept their children  
after the long period of separa-  
tion caused by using nurseries.

Slow Start

Then in the late 1940s Duke  
Hospital decided on an ex-  
perimental program of com-  
pulsory rooming-in. Interesting-  
ly, the rationale used was similar  
to that for instituting the nursery  
system in the first  
place—prevention of infection.  
The biggest obstacle wasn't con-  
vincing the mothers; it was the  
obstetricians and nurses who  

objected. Though prevention of  
infection was the motivation for  
the experiment, the primary  
rewards were psychological and  
educational.

Over twenty-five years later,  
“rooming-in” is still the excep-  

tion in U.S. hospitals, but  
evidence in its favor is piling up.  
Some of this research is review-  
ed in an outstanding article,  
which I recommend in its entire-  
ty to all of you. This is “Mothers  
separated from their newborn  
infants” by Marshall H. Klaus  
and John H. Kennell in Pediatric  
Clinics of North America, vol.  
17, no. 4, November, 1970.

Part II of this article, which dis-  
cusses specific ideas for  
women who are considering  
“rooming-in”, will be published  
next month. — Ed.

Note: Nothing has yet been  
decided about the legality and  
limits of midwifery in Colorado.  
We will report what is happen-  
ing as soon as anything does  
happen.

“Girls,” Start Cheering!

by Becky Bohannan

Athletics is a field which men have dominated ever since the  
Olympics of ancient Greece. But lately, with the Billie Jean King-  
Bobby Riggs exhibition and such heartthrobs as Olga Korbut, more  
and more people are taking an interest in women’s athletics. With  
this newly acquired enthusiasm, I investigated Cherry Creek High  
School's sports program. What I discovered simply reaffirmed my  
initial impression, that though the situation is not without hope,  
sexism abounds in the athletic department.

Cherry Creek offers thirteen  
varsity sports for boys, plus  
junior varsity, freshman, and  
sophomore teams. It offers the  
girls a grand total of five, which  
are gymnastics, swimming, ten-  
nis, track, and field hockey. The  
situation is improving. For the  
last ten to fifteen years (accor-  
ding to one coach) girls have  
been playing volleyball and  
basketball on the chance that  
these sports would become  
sanctioned by the Colorado High  
School Athletic Association.  
Now finally, both sports have  
been sanctioned for next year,  
which means they will be able to  
receive funds out of the activities  
budget and play in a regular  
league.

Pat Morgan is a member of the  
girls’ track team in which her  
events are discus and shot-put.  
She is also on the volleyball  
team. Pat has a number of com-  
plaints about the sports  
program. Speaking on the small  
amount of funds granted to girls’  
teams, she says, “Boys get this  
and boys get that and they  
always come first in equipment  
and privileges. No attention is  
given to the girls.” The coach of  
one of the girls’ teams says the  
same thing. She could not quote  
the figures exactly, but there is a  
large difference between the  
amount of funds the boys receiv-  
ed compared to the amount girls  

sports receive. She also  
protested the fact that in the  
sport she coaches, she is ex-  
pected to coach her entire team  
herself while the boys’ team of  
the same sport has a coach and  
two assistant coaches. Each  
team has an equal amount of  
participants and events. “I’m try-  
ing to do an impossible job,” she  
says, “if I'm to come out with a  
winning team.”  
Tiny Articles

Girls’ sports are rarely  
publicized to any extent, a fact  
which especially bothers Pat.  
“There's almost never anything  
in the school paper about the  
girls’ sports except maybe some  
real tiny article. Girls’ swim  
team puts up their own signs. No  
one comes to watch the track  
team. Oh, at the district and  
state meets there will be a few  
people, but otherwise it’s zilch.  
Of course, we don’t have a fan  
club following us around. In pep  
assemblies you never hear  
about girls’ sports. The boys’  
football team has been in-  
troduced so many times you  
know every single guy. But the  
girls’ teams are never in-  
troduced. If they did, I don’t think  
the boys would take it.”

In looking through the  

school’s annual for the last two  
years and back issues of its  
newspaper, it became evident  

that Pat had every right to com-  
plain. Cherry Creek's 1972 an-  
nual contained 22 pages  
devoted to sports. Four of these  
were about girls’ sports. The  
amount of space allotted to girls’  
sports actually declined in ‘73  
with only two pages representing  
two of the five sports. A  
number of issues of the paper  
didn't even mention any girls’  
sports. Others had one article or  
possibly two. None were in a  
prominent position on the page.  
Most of the articles just gave a  
straight news story.

One article with the title  
“Women’s Lib in Sports,” (from  
The Union St. Journal, Sept. 21,  
1973) stood out from the rest. Its  
introductory paragraph began,  
“In the age of male dominance,  
the female role in sports was sit-  
ting on the sidelines cheering on  
the varsity (all male) teams.  
Now, however, the girls are  
realizing how much exercise  
conditions their figures, keeping  
them slimmer, trimmer, and  

generally good looking...”  
“Can't Leave Out Girls”

Another example of the con-  
descending attitude toward  
girls’ sports appeared in an arti-  
cle written by a coach. He spoke  
of the outlook for the spring  
sports program and mentioned  
all the boys’ teams and a number  
of male individuals. At one point  
he stated, “...and yes, we cannot  
leave out the girls’ program...,”  
which was the only mention of  
girls in the entire article. This  
statement seems to reflect the  
general opinion of the school.  
“Let’s not forget the girls,” but  
that’s exactly what people do.  
Forget the girls.

The major complaint of the  
two women interviewed is the  
way in which men react to them,  
especially men also involved in  
athletics. “What really upsets  
me,” said the coach, “is that too  
many of the student body and es-  
pecially the boys involved in  
athletics, cut down the girls who  
go out for sports.” Being an ob-  

ject of this contempt, Pat said, “I  
get the impression sometimes  
that we're really looked down  
on. Especially in my event 'cause  
most girls don’t go around lifting  
weights.” She then went on to  
say, “The most recognized girls’  
sport at Cherry Creek is Pom-  
Pom, Cheerleading. Wow! It's  
fine to be a cheerleader but is  
that all the girls can be? The boys  
have the idea of putting us in the  
category of cheerleaders so that  
we can idolize them with their  
great accomplishments, not to  
be equal but to stay below and  
idolize, well FORGET IT!”

Contemptuous Treatment

If Cherry Creek is any indica-  
tion of other high schools, girls’  
athletic programs are neglected  
by school administrations and  
actually treated with contempt  
among certain students. But the  
situation is changing slightly. In  
the last two years, two new  
sports have been added to the  
program and two more will be  
added next year. This could easi-  
ly be attributed to the Feminist  
movement, which has  
generated all the publicity and  
discussion of equal rights. The  
climate was right to expand the  
girls’ program. The contempt  
shown for girls in sports by  
athletic boys is probably their  
natural negative reaction to  
change that confronts their  
stereotypes of the role of women  
that we have all been indoctrinated with.

All Pat and others like her are  
asking for is a change. “Athletic  
girls just don’t have a fair chance  
to progress. None. Girls that  
want to compete should be able  
to. We have the same  
capabilities. We can compete  
against other women in the  
same events men compete in.  
But we're never given any  
recognition.” Well, the male  
athletic establishment had  
better beware, women athletes  
not only have the drive to com-  
pete, they also have the drive to  
prove themselves, and they will.
