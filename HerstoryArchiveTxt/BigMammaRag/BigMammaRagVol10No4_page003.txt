Fine Issue  
Dear BMR:

Your last issue on spiri-  
tuality (Vol 10#3) was the  
finest I've seen on that top-  
ic in any women's publica-  
tion. As a witch/healer/hexer  
and former psychiatric inn-  
mate, I think important  
points were covered in all  
the articles. I liked what  
Calliope shared of her Menn-  
onite background and her re-  
cognition of the healing  
power of poetry. Marilyn  
Caffey's examination of  
dualism forced me to think of  
splits I make not just with-  
in but without--bad/good,  
biochemical/cultural, indi-  
vidual/collective. Is a mer-  
ger possible of certain di-  
cotomies?

I very much appreciated  
Kim Womantree's serious hu-  
mor and catchy writing style.  
Equally important was her  
realization of the politics  
of spirituality and how this  
works in the concrete world.  
Like Kim, I too practice  
alone because "I have not  
found any coven or group I  
feel comfortable with." In  
the Bay Area I suspect cov-  
ens are merely "fronts" for  
feminist therapy and I've  
got a "negative" reputation  
'cause my "vibes" bum those  
who've "got it" out.

I appreciated Rose's ar-  
ticle dealing with the blend  
of "being a witch and being  
a mad woman." I think of the  
book I looked through at a  
"woman's" bookstore in Oak-  
land on drugs. It pushed the  
idea of how the horrible  
psychiatric poisons are cures  
for "mental illness" and that  
the witches burned, tortured  

and hung in times past were  
actually "schizophrenics."  
This garbage is no news to  
any politically conscious ex-  
inmate which brings me to  
your collective.

More than any other pub-  
lication, I think you are  
really struggling with issues  
of psychiatric violence. It  
almost gives me hope for the  
women's movement to see how  
sensitive you've gotten to  
language, stereotypes, and  
the problems of victims of  
psychiatry. Though feminism  
is not where I want to put  
my energy anymore, I'm glad  
somebody is working on that  
front. We need all the help  
we can get.

I also wanted to say  
thanks for the criticism/  
self-criticism of your paper.

In a letter to Off Our Backs,  
a woman wrote in complaining  
about their sarcastic re-  
sponse to criticism and was  
quite upset with recent  
headlines. The collective's  
response, "During layout  
weekends, we don't weigh each  
word, headline and graphic  
endlessly or we would never  
meet deadlines...we try to  
add a bit of humor to them."  
The humor shows up in the  
areas the staff is most ig-  
norant about, and then they  
get defensive when they "blow  
it." My point is, I recognize  
the difficult and perhaps  
sometimes thankless work you  
at Big Mama Rag are doing in  
contributing to the good of  
the planet. Criticism/self-  
criticism, sensitivity, hon-  
esty are among the most im-  
portant ingredients in put-  
ting out a worthwhile publi-  
cation--and Big Mama Rag is  
at the top of the stack as  
far as I'm concerned.

Open Letter

Dear Woman to Woman Collec-  
tive,

Ever since I came to Den-  
ver almost 3 years ago, I  
have heard about Woman to  
Woman wanting to “reach out"  
to all women, including wom-  
en who are handicapped, dis-  
abled, etc. Yet nothing is  
being done at all about wom-  
en who have lung/respiratory  
diseases and who, because of  
these diseases, are highly  
allergic to cigarette smoke.  
A couple of years ago, I  
used to be part of your col-  
lective and got very sick  
several different times af-  
ter being exposed to cigar-  
ette smoke in the store. Con-  
sequently I had to quit being  
a part of the collective and  
coming to Woman to Woman.

I had heard that there  
was a new collective and sup-  
posedly more sensitive women  
on the collective. Today I  
came into the store and had  
to walk through the front  
sitting area where a couple  
of women were smoking. Noth-  
ing has changed for me. Is  
this an exclusive club for  
women who can breathe in  
smoke and not start choking  
for air? I find this to be  
very discriminatory on your  
part and very insensitive  
to all the women who need  
that store as much as you do  
who can't come in because  

you choose to smoke. I fully  
realize and appreciate that  
smokers have the privilege  
to smoke (in nonpublic places)  
but, on the other hand, non-  
smokers have the right to  
breathe and by allowing women  
to smoke in Woman to Woman,  
you are taking the right to  
breathe away from women such  
as myself with lung diseases  
if we choose to come into  

the store. And by continuing  
your smoking policy, we  
don't even have the choice  

to come into the bookcenter!

Womyn's Land

Dear BMR Readers,

In the situation I describ-  
ed in my Jan BMR letter, I do  
not use the term "Jewish wo-  
myn" arbitrarily like, "the  
Jewish womyn ordered a cup of  
coffee."

The tribe I describe and  
the lands have a very long  
and complex history. My crit-  
icism of myself is that I  
have opened a very large is-  
sue for discussion in a limit-  
ed forum--a letter column.

My concern with the anti-  
semitism consciousness in the  
womyn's movement is that po-  
tential exists for the reali-  
ty of anti-semitism to be  
used to justify racist acts.

I consider the war by Is-  
rael against the Palestinian  
people to be a racist form of  
genocide. Although the reli-  
gious significance of Pales-  
tine has been explained by  
both sides, it is clear to me  
that white people prefer to  
settle on third world land,  
as opposed to colonizing  
another white country.

At La Luz, womyn of colour  
land in Northern California,  
in the late 1970's there was  
no former religious connec-  
tion between the Jewish womyn  
and the land. The original  
womyn of colour group had  
split up and I had gone back  
with my child, who was 3-4  
years old at the time, to try  
to form another womyn of  
colour living group. Unfortun-  
ately, this never happened.  
Though individual womyn of  
colour came and went the only  
womyn making a commitment to  
stay and settle on the land  
was myself. Being alone proba-  

bly made me more vulnerable  
than anything else.

Most of the womyn who came  
to La Luz during this time  
came at my invitation because  
I had put out an open call in  
the tribe for help. Unfortun-  
ately, I found that many white  
womyn had a hard time relating  
to me as primary caretaker on  
the land and a person whose  
rights and plans had to be  
respected, as opposed to an  
appendage of the white tribe,  
which I had always been. So,  
although womyn came in good  
faith to help, there were pro-  
blems in clarifying people's  
positions--as either decision-  
makers or guests.

It was clear that some wo-  
myn were simply not going to  
accept the fact that on womyn  
of colour land all their as-  
sumptions, ways and decisions  
were not necessarily imple-  
mented.

A group of Jewish womyn  
claimed that they had every  
right to the land, since they  
considered themselves womyn  
of colour. I consider this a  
racist act of sabotage  
against myself that was pos-  
sible because I was so out-  
numbered by white and Jewish  
womyn on the land, again--La  
Luz was womyn of colour land.

As far as I know, no white  
womyn's land has ever been  
challenged by Jewish womyn  
and the only time womyn of  
colour land was challenged by  
Jewish womyn was when one wo-  
myn of colour was isolated  
there--myself.

I do not deny that the over-  
all culture, the womyn's move-  
ment and myself personally
