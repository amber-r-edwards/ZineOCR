Letters Home To Mama

Feminist Evolution  
Dear Sisters,

The evolution of the feminist  
movement over the past decade  
has been an overwhelming  
triumph for the early pioneers of  
this social and economic revolu-  
tion. It is an indication of the  
strength, cohesiveness, and  
impetus of our drive that we are  
dealing with increasingly com-  
plex questions. One such is the  
matter of power. Because power  
has traditionally been the op-  
pressive tool of white male  
society, feminists have rejected  
power and have attempted to  
organize societies and sub-  
societies based on non-  
hierarchical and non-power  
concepts. This has often led to  
groups which functioned as  
many-headed hydras, the domi-  
nant features being lack of  
decisive action, long and rambl-  
ing meetings, and loss of  
membership due to persistent  
seasickness from being con-  
stantly adrift. Before anyone  
puts me in the male-apologist  
bag, let me clearly define my  
beliefs about men. Feminists no  
longer need men for cultural,  

economic, sexual, political,  
religious, reproductive, (Yes,  
Virginia, WE can reproduce  
without men!) or any other  

reason. Men, like the passenger  
pigeon and the dinosaur, are a  
dead-ended group. I would like a  
totally Amazonian society and  
deal with men reluctantly. Need-  
less to say, I teach no male any of  
the Arcana. So, I am not defen-  
ding a male ideology.

Societies MUST have leaders,  
and without the ability to act, will  
not endure. (Could this be why  
the CIA has an interest in strong  
feminist leaders?) Leaders must  
have power, power to decide,  
power to act, power to lead.  
Power does NOT mean the  
creation of oppressive tactics,  
and rape of justice, or the  
diminution of the individual. All  
of these males have equated

with power, and have indeed  
brought about through power  
freely given or ruthlessly taken.  
As we learn from decaying  
matter the stench of death so let  
us learn from male dominated  
societies the outcomes of the  
abuse of power. But, we must  
not fear power because of the  
past and current abuse. If we are  
to have a society, if we are to  
have law, progress, culture,  
peace, if we are to have our  
feminist world, we must not be  
afraid to give our chosen leaders  
power. What males have done  
with an instrument of society is  
unimportant in this respect.  
What is important is that women  
use these instruments wisely  
and with love.

The Wicce established these  
truths centuries ago. Are we  
listening yet?

Blessed be,

Dear Big Mama Rag!

Just a quickie to let you know  
that we at Sister are reading you  
regularly. Seems like L.A. sisters  
are turned on to Big Mama Rag.  
I always pick up my copy at Sister-  
hood Bookstore with the  
assurance that you're going to —  
one more time — let me know  
what's happening with sisters in  
the hinterland. (I’m from Okla.  
City & can't get any Okla.  
women’s press publications.)

Last time around was really  
right on! The article on Norma  
Jean Serena was very much  
appreciated. We reprinted in the  
August issue of Sister. Also,  
Sister recently got a T.V. news  
spot doing women’s news by  
women for women. Our first  
show focused on forced  
sterilization and we zeroed in on  
Ms. Serena. The photo collage of  
your two staffers on vacation  
was really warm and loving  
recognition. Enjoyed it!

I read many women's  
publications on a regular basis  
but somehow Big Mama Rag is

Red Stockings Responds  

Dear Editors:

The reason for including  
Redstockings’ history, both  
group and individual, and quotes  
from our forthcoming journal  
Feminist Revolution in our press  
release concerning Gloria  
Steinem’s CIA associations was  
political not “self-righteous” or  
“self-congratulatory” as stated  
in your July 1975 article. The  
purpose was twofold: 1) to  
provide a context for our critique  
of Steinem and Ms. by showing  
the politics of the group from  
which it was coming and 2) to  
make clear that the press  
release was written not to attack  
the women’s liberation move-  
ment but to defend it in the face  
of ongoing attacks and dilution  
by the power structure.

We do feel it is necessary for  
women to know the history of  
the women’s liberation move-  
ment in order to understand  
where we are right now, just as  
it is necessary to know  
Steinem’s political history in  
order to fully understand her  
present position. The author of  
your article seemed quite con-  
cerned with history herself as  
she described Redstockings’  
background and raised as “rele-  
vant” why some early members  
are not currently in the group.  
However, she made some  
historical errors. Ti-Grace Atkin-  
son was never a member of Red-  
stockings, though she is  
publicly supporting the press  
release. Rita Mae Brown was  
not “an early member of Red-  
stockings.” She briefly joined one  
of the spin-off groups of the  
original organization. Before  
leaving she made clear her dis-  
agreement with the Redstock-  
ings Manifesto, which  
represented the basic founding  
principles of the group.

The issues we raised concern-  
ing Steinem and Ms. are  
serious ones. It is in the interest  
of the women’s liberation move-  
ment that they be judged directly  
on their own terms without the  
diversion of speculation on per-  
sonal motives.

Sincerely,  
Barbara Leon

Socialist Feminist  
Dear BMR,

This letter is intended as a  
criticism/self-criticism. The arti-  
cle I wrote on the socialist  
feminist conference in Dayton  
had a heavy negative emphasis  
that I did not intend. I was not  
strong enough, apparently, in  
including the positive results of  
the conference, so I will say here  
that: Over 1500 women spent 3  
days and $30 talking and plan-  
ning and struggling with each  
other about a revolution, and if  
race and class privilege allowed  
many of them to come, and if  
the conference site, Antioch  

College, was elitist, then those  

privileges and that elitism  
came under heavy attack at the  
conference. Proposals were  
accepted to find a cheaper site  
next time, and to open up the  
conference more to third  
world and working class women.

Most socialist groups that have  
been around a while are heavily  

male-identified, rigid in their  
rhetoric and threatened by  
strong women. That doesn’t  

mean that we can afford to trash  
socialism as a revolutionary  
theory or indulge in name-  
calling. It means that we have to  
be clear that our siamese twin  
enemy is patriarchy and  
capitalism, that we have to be  
careful not to say THE ONLY  
(revolutionary strategy, real  
revolutionaries, problem, solu-  
tion) is (communism, socialism,  
lesbianism, feminism,) like  
many self-righteous politicos  
that talk only to each other say  
THE ONLY.  
Congratulations on your con-  
tinuing survival.  
Sincerely,  
Kim Womantree

Dear Sisters,

Please put the enclosed check  
towards the reconstruction of  
your equipment lost in last  
weekend's trashing. In spite of  
our political differences, I am  
enraged and saddened that you  
became the target of such a  
malicious act. We must resist  
such repression together.

In struggle and unity,

Greetings Sisters,

We read about the cowardly  
attack on your paper in LWS. We  
have also noted a number of  
attacks against women’s papers.

We are unable to contribute to  
you at this time. We do send you  
greetings of solidarity and unity!

When you are able to, please  
send us a copy of the paper.

In struggle,

Dear BMR:

I'm really sorry your offices  
“got it.” The positive side is in  
knowing that it probably  
wouldn't have happened if Big  

Mama Rag wasn't making  
waves.  
Keep up the good work.

Dear Sisters,

We are writing to tell you that  
we have heard of the vandalism  
and destruction that was done to  
Big Mama Rag and send our  
regrets and also our outrage.  
Please let us know if we can do  
something to help you. Our best  
to you...

Dear Big Mama Rag,

We heard about the trashing  
and we know how that is — we  
also know how it helps to have  
all the support others can give —  
so we got this together at an  
editorial and collective meeting.

Keep on struggling,

Womanspirit  

The following letter was  
written by two Seattle women in  
response to the position on  
childcare of the Womanspirit  
Tribal Gathering. The publicity  
on the gathering contained the  
following section on childcare:  
“NO GROUP CHILD CARE WILL  
BE PROVIDED. We strongly urge  
you to leave your child/ren  
behind with the most loving  
persons you know. Care of  
children will be the cooperative  
responsibility of the small  
groups in which children live  
during our Gathering Time.  
Living in these groups will be on  
a VOLUNTEER BASIS. With all  
that is going on, who will choose  
to do child care? Nursing babies  
should not be a problem, but  

tearful and dependent children  
of any age will be unhappy in a  

large group of ‘strangers’ in a  
“strange” place. Older girls who  
can make friends or be comfor-  
table watching are most  
welcome.”

The publicity also had a list of  

what not to bring. This list  

included males over six years of  
age.

The Seattle letter was signed  
by fifty-seven people.

Seattle, Wa.  
July 18, 1975  

To the women of  
Womanspirit Tribal Gathering:

We are angered and appalled  
at Womanspirit’s lack of feminist  
perspective in the area of child-  
care. Womanspirit has made it  
virtually impossible for mothers  
to be there and leaves us to  
question exactly who will be  
there and what they will be  
sharing.

Childcare should be a right in  
society, especially in the  
women’s community (that in-  
cludes, as well, the lesbian  
community). Unfortunately, in  
all these realms, women with  
children are on the lowest  
stratum of life’s totem pole,  
economically and socially.

Some of us are welfare  
mothers, lesbian mothers, or  
both. Some of us are not  
mothers but feel that pregnancy  
and/or motherhood are not a  
social disease, and should not  
affect our ability to economically  
provide for ourselves. So we ask  
you for some time to listen and.
