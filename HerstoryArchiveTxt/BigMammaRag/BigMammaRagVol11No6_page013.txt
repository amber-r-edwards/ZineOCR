British Pigs Hassle Politically Active "Angry Women"

A woman in Leeds, England,  
has been arrested and charged  
with causing criminal damage  
and conspiracy to cause crim-  
inal damage, in connection  
with 17 arson attacks by the  
group "Angry Women" on porn  
shops in Leeds. The woman,  
Connie O'Donovan, is an ac-  
knowledged lesbian feminist.  
She was kept in gaol for 2½  
days before being allowed  
access to a lawyer, and for a  
further 4½ days before being  
released on conditional bail.  
This is contrary to English  
law and constitutes extreme  
harassment. During the 7  
days she was in gaol, the  
cops questioned her at all  
times of the day and night.  
She was forbidden to flush  
the toilet, wash or have any-  
thing to eat without asking  

permission; she was told she  
could leave as soon as she  
gave the police a name (Ms.  
Big?) and that she could  
write the name in her address  
book so that they could 'find'  
it and she wouldn't have to  
take responsibility for giv-  
ing it; she was offered help  
with decorating her new flat,  
and she was taken out for a  
meal. The police also threat-  
ened to take her mother and  
sister (who both live 150  
miles away) into custody and  
put her sister's children in-  
to care. This threat arises  
out of the fact that Connie's  
sister's car, which was in  
Connie's care at the time, was  
stolen (presumably by Angry  
Women), driven into a porn  
cinema and set alight the day  
before Connie's arrest.

Connie now has to be home  
by 2 am and has to report to  
the cop station every day.  
She's been told that she'll  
be taken into custody again  
if there are any further ar-  
son attacks or even graffiti  
relating to women's oppres-  
sion. If found guilty, she's  
unlikely to get away with  
less than 5 years in prison  
and it could easily be more.  
It seems there is no serious  
evidence against her but the  
cops are prepared to go to  
any lengths to get informa-  
tion about Angry Women. A  
couple of months ago they  
pulled in another woman and  
wrecked her house while  
searching it (see page 6).  
Although she was released  
fairly quickly, it's appar-  
ent that no woman in Leeds is  

safe from the constant threat  
of police harassment.

According to English law  
Connie is eligible for legal  
aid and can choose her own  
lawyer, so the government is  
paying for her to be repre-  
sented by one of the best  
feminist lawyers in Britain.  
Her next court appearance is  
scheduled for 25th April but  
it seems very unlikely that  
the police will proceed with-  
out another name so they'll  
probably postpone it in the  
hopes of intimidating Connie  
into giving them more infor-  
mation.

Letters of support for  
Connie may be sent to her

Eva Williams From Page 14

Dear Sisters,

Many of you may have heard  
of this case of Eva Williams--  
a young Black woman from  
Holmes County, Mississippi,  
who was allegedly raped by  
the deputy sheriff, while in-  
carcerated (awaiting trial)  
at the Holmes County Jail.

Eva is still in  
the Holmes County jail. She  
is very frightened. Her trial  
will probably not take place  
until fall, 1983. In the  
meantime, her safety is at  
stake--both physical and  
mental.

Eva's bond has been set at  
$20,000. The National Council  
of Churches has been asked,  
and it appears that they will  
put up the $20,000 to bail  
Eva out of jail. That process  
is in motion right now.

Last week we had to make an  
immediate decision as to  
whether or not we would re-  
tain a private attorney for  
Eva, or allow her to go  
through trial with her court  
appointed attorney--who is  
also the attorney for the  
sheriffs in the county! (Re-  
member, it was a deputy sher-  
iff that allegedly raped Eva.)  
We had hoped to be able to  
get legal counsel from some  
women's groups, but were for-  
ced to act quickly or take  
the chance of Eva going to  
trial with her appointed at-  
torney. We retained an attor-  
ney at the cost of $2500.  
There will be other costs  
such as telephone, postage,  
copies, etc.

Eva Williams has no money.  
She has 3 children. The most  
a mother with 3 children can  
receive of welfare assistance  
is $130/month. Her cases are  
such that they exemplify  

abuse in every aspect of life.

We believe that the women  
in the US will rally behind  
Eva Williams. We are also  
well aware of the economic  
crunch that everyone, and  
especially women, are going  
through at this time. Because  
of this, we are asking each  
woman who receives this let-  
ter to donate $1 to help a  
sister defray the costs of  
this case. We are asking that  
you will ask every other  
woman in your church, your club,  
your school, your religious  
congregation, at your work  
and wherever else you go, to  
also donate $1. Would you  
please do this? Our goal for  
obtaining the $2500 lawyer's  
fee is June 22, 1983. That  
means we all have to move  
fast. Money that is collected  
for this should be sent to  
our organization and ear-  
marked "For Eva Williams de-  
fense." If possible, once it  
is collected, make out a  
check for the entire amount  
collected and send that by  
check or money order. We  
would ask that you keep track  
of who sent the money so that  
you can give them a report on  
how well we have done, and on  
how her case is coming along.  
Because of the immediacy of  
the situation that came up,  
our organization was forced  
to give $1500 to her attorney  

already, and have taken the  
responsibility of making sure  
he gets the rest. We did this,  
knowing that it had to be  
done and believing that women  
in America would be willing  
to help out in this situation.  
Feel free to duplicate this  
letter and send it to whoever  
you feel would respond. Thank  
you for caring enough to act.

In struggle for justice,

Letter From Page 3

more reactionary than that  
approved by other parties like  
Christian Democracy in other  
countries, as it is the case  
in Italy.

In Spain, 3,000 women die  
every year as a consequence  
of illegal abortions done in  
inhumane conditions. About  
500 thousand women have abor-  
tions every year, either in  
our country, or going to Eng-  
land or Nederland, yet several  
thousand of them are judged,  
condemned and imprisoned after  
having suffered the trauma of  
an illegal abortion.

The sentence for having had  
an abortion performed or for  
collaborating or helping in a  
case of abortion goes up to six  
years in prison. And the PSOE  
project is only going to help  
3% of the women affected by  

this terrible problem.

The Catholic Church and the  
Spanish right have organized  
a big campaign with the slogan  
“right to life" with a great  
array of economic, political  
and human means.

The Feminist Party, together  
with the most progressive wings  
of Spanish society, are  
calling on the RIGHT OF THE  
WOMEN TOWARD THEIR OWN BODIES,  
and we affirm that only the  
women have the right to decide  
about their pregnancies, about  
their will on wanting or not  
to be a mother.

The fight for the legaliza-  
tion of FREE ABORTION is going  
to be very hard.

We know we can count on IN-  
TERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY in the  
fight for free abortion. That's  
why we are calling on you, so  
that you will give all the in-  
formation to the mass media  
and to the progressive politi-  
cal groups in your country  
about the fight of Spanish  
women for free abortion.

We need your help that can  
be shown among other things  
with sending telegrams or let-  
ters to the MINISTERIO DE  
JUSTICIA, Sr. Fernando Ledesma,  
Madrid, Spain, calling for the  
legalization of free abortion.  
Please send us a copy of the  
letter or telegram.

If we give birth, we have  
to be the only ones to decide  
about it.

Thank you sisters for your  
feminist solidarity.

For the feminist victory!
