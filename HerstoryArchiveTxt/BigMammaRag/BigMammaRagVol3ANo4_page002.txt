Guess Who’s On Top Now?

Jane Alpert, Feminist Media,  
the Left, and the Feds.

Linda Fowler

“You don’t need a weather  
man (or woman) to know which  
way the wind blows.” And in this  
case, perhaps it is better if you  
haven't one. Uncle Sam, that  
crafty old patriarch, has kicked up  
quite a storm. His opponents are  
so busy pointing fingers, they  
haven't taken time to examine  
the evidence.

Latest in this series of finger  
pointings is a statement sup-  
posedly issued by weather  
women denouncing Alpert (Ma-  

jority Report, April 19). It hopefully  
shows a temporary lack of  
clarity in the thinking of these  
brave sisters. When you're in the  
middle of a storm and hanging on  
for your life it can be difficult to  
get your directions straight. The  
statement suffers from a  
backward type of logic. It goes like  
this: since fugitives have been  
busted at varying times since  
Alpert surfaced, Alpert must be  
responsible for the busts. For the  
statement writers, life apparent-  
ly began when Alpert surfaced,  
nothing ever happened before  
that, and there is no space of time  
between the surfacing and the  
busts in which anything else  
could have occurred. Or, to put it  
another way, they don’t know  
what she said, but they know  
what happened later “as a  
result”, so she must have said  
“something”. (Is it too elemen-  
tary to point out that unless we  
know what was originally said  
we do not know whether or not  
later occurrences were a result of  
this action?)

King of the Mountain

The left (male, that is) is seizing  
the opportunity to discredit  
feminism and feminists with  
charges like “counter-  
revolutionary.” Having been  
rather inactive since losing all  
their office staff a few years ago,  
they may be hoping to stage a  

comeback by guilt-tripping the  

staff back into the office and the  
rebellion.

Meanwhile, Uncle is sitting  
back, scratching and cackling,  
examining the fine position he  
now holds: the so-called move-  
ment people are busy with their  
more-revolutionary-than-thou  
battles; feminism, the only active  
movement in the country, is  
being discredited and divided;  
the left is on its deathbed, and  
everyone is suspicious of  
everyone else.

“Divide and conquer,” Julius said.  

“It is the essence of oppression  
to set us against other oppressed  
peoples. To break our spirit. To  
set us against ourselves. To make  
us forget the real enemy. This is  
the strategy of the oppressor,”  
said Ti-Grace, et al, and then  
proceeded to prove it by lashing  
out at Jane Alpert.

Confusion reigns.

At the risk of being bourgeois,  
let us try to look at the evidence.  
The Best Show in Town

The entire affair resembles a  
Greek tragedy. The cast of  

characters is lengthy, with  
several heavies marching in and  
out at appropriate moments,  
upstaging one another with  
either rhetoric or theatrics, a  
tragic heroine, played by Alpert,  
and a chorus, the feminist press,  
droning periodically in the  
background. It is the best show in  
years.

There are some real issues  
here, but you have to look  
carefully to see them. They’re  
obscured among the power grabs  
and emotional verbiage. And, like  
most Greek plays, this one is  
really about the struggle  
between the patriarchy and the  
matriarchy with the tragic  
heroine caught between a rock  
and a hard place.

Remember Oedipus? His crime  
wasn't killing his father, it was  
loving his mother — incest. The  
matriarchal taboo. Breaking the  
mother’s law was a crime no  
amount of attrition could wipe  
out. Later Orestes had to find a  
patriarchal Dorian god to forgive  
him for the murder of his mother  
and free him from the  
matriarchal Furies. Good thing  
for Orestes it was the time of the  
patriarchal revolution, huh?  
Perhaps our heroine will have a  
stroke of luck too. Remember to  
look for the hidden meaning  
when you get to the end of this  
play.

The Scenario

(We know Greek plays were  
not divided into acts, but they  
should have been.)  
Act I: 1969  
Scene 1: Chicago — the Days of  
Rage demonstrations. One of  
those arrested in connection  
with the violence there is Barry  
Stein. Stein goes underground  
and is not to be heard from again  
until 1974.  
Scene 2: New York City — the  
living room of an apartment.  
There are four people. These four,  
Jane Alpert, Sam Melville, David  
Hughey and Pat Swinton, will  
later be charged with conspiracy  
connected with the bombing of  
Federal Buildings in NYC.  
An explosion. In 1974 Alpert will  
talk about the big argument she  
and Melville had over what she  
called his irresponsible actions.  
How he endangered lives by not  
checking out the routines of  
employees in a building before  
bombing it. (She says that she  
took this on as her job.)  
More bombs.  
The BUST.  
Scene 3: The four are arrested.  
Pat Swinton disappears before  
being indicted. The FBI considers  
her a fugitive. Alpert pleads guilty  
but jumps bail in May of 1970  
before coming to trial. Melville  
pleads guilty ... he is sentenced  
to serve his term in Attica State  
Prison in New York.  
John Hughey, who also pleads  
guilty, is jailed for less than one  
year. He is represented in court  
by Fred Cohn, a lawyer. Sources  
in New York allege Cohn is an ex-  
weatherman.  
Act II:  
Scene 1: May, 1970 — 1973 An  
unknown building in New York.  
Alpert is talking to some  
nameless people. She is asking if  
they will aid her when she is  
underground. She is asking their  
help to get Sam Melville out of  
prison. When the talk is over she  
is satisfied they will help her in  
both ways. But, she complains  
later, the help she needs is not  
forthcoming. She says these  
people got only Tim Leary out and  
only because they wanted to  
sway the drug culture to their  
political bent. A tool for organiz-  
ing, she says. She heads for  
California. Phone calls. She tries  
to set up meetings with others  
who are underground. Each time  
she is seen waiting at the ap-  
pointed spot. Each time, no one  
comes to meet her.  
Scene 2: September, 1970. John  
Hughey is released from prison  
on parole. No one comments  
about his light sentence or  
questions his integrity.  
Sept. 13, 1971. Attica Prison. A  
massive rebellion of the inmates  
is ended in brutal fashion by the  
state police. Sam Melville is  
dead, killed along with many  
other prisoners.  
Scene 3: New Mexico, 1972.  
Alpert accidentally runs into  
Mark Rudd and several other  
fugitives. There is a meeting with  
Alpert, Rudd and some women  
fugitives. Alpert tries to get them  
to support feminist goals and  
principles. She talks of women’s  
oppression. She asks for support.  
The answer comes, “After the  
revolution.” They say the oppres-  
sion of women is not an im-  
mediate problem. They say it is  
not as important as the oppres-  
sion of men. They say, “You must  
help us organize around the  
Attica uprising.”  
Alpert writes Mother Right, a  
theory of feminism, and Letters  
to My Sisters Underground. She  
says she has woken up to her  

own oppression. She says she  
and her sisters are being used,  
she says she will fight for her  

people.

Act III: Between 1973 & Oct.,  
1974

Scene 1: Guilford, Vermont. A  

commune called the Total Loss  
Farm. Barry Stein and a woman  
who now calls herself Shoshana  
Davis are talking. The farm is  
home for Stein for 1½ years  
while he is underground. It is also  
home for Shoshana (Pat Swin-  
ton) Davis.

Scene 2: Outside an apartment in  
San Francisco Patty Hearst is  
being stuffed into the trunk of a  
car by a group calling themselves  
the Symbionese Liberation  
Army. She later joins her captors  
as a fugitive.

June 3, 1974: an FBI office. An  
agent says the FBI is hot on  
Patty’s trail and says a final  
solution is near. He will say it  
again, and again, and again...

Act IV: Oct. 1974 — April, 1975  
Scene 1: Oct. 9, 1974 Barry Stein  
turns himself in to authorities.  
Cook County District Court,  
Chicago. Barry Stein is arraign-  
ed on charges of aggravated  
battery (from the Days of Rage  
affair) and unlawful flight. He is  
released on $50,000 bail in the  
custody of his parents. He  
returns to Brattleboro, Vt. where  
he is the director of a community  
health clinic. He does not go to  
jail.

No one questions this, or doubts  
his integrity.

Oct. 22, 1974 — Mickey Cohen, a  
California underworld figure  
tells the FBI he knows where  
Hearst is and can get her. Too  
dangerous, says the family. What  
did the FBI say? We don’t know.  
Patty remains at large. The FBI  
remains frustrated.

Nov. 14, 1974 Jane Alpert sur-  
faces in New York. She is charged  
with conspiracy and unlawful  
flight. Though she says she is  
talking to the FBI, she says it is  
only about herself. She tells the  
FBI that she hasn't been in  
contact with any other fugitives.  
The movement community gets  
uptight. Alpert is sentenced to 27  
mo. in prison. Everyone is saying  
she got a light sentence and  
questions her integrity.

Feb., 1975 — The busts have not  
yet begun. The first of many  
statements, letters, and articles  
appear in the feminist press in Off  
Our Backs, Jane has denounced  
the left, but her recent interview  
has not yet been printed. This  
letter of Ti-Grace, et al, implies  
that Alpert has betrayed us  
(women). It says we must be loyal  
to Attica. It says we are Attica. We  
don't know who is Bedford Hills.  
(A woman’s prison in New York.)  
March 12, 1975: Pat Swinton is  
busted in Brattleboro, Vt. She has  
been living at Tacker’s Corner  
Farm (former Total Loss Farm)  
while at work in a health foods  
store.

Scene 2: March 13 — a court  
room in New York City. Swinton  
is being arraigned. She pleads  
not guilty. One of her lawyers,  
Fred Cohn, in stating her case  
says that Jane and Pat were in  
contact while underground. He  
says Pat expected to get busted.  
About Alpert, he says liberally  
that you never know whether  
information you are giving is  
valuable. It is apparently true.  
Because of Cohn’s statements,  
Alpert gets her parole privileges  
revoked and faces the possibility  
of two new charges, harboring a  
fugitive and giving false informa-  
tion. Another of Swinton’s  
lawyers, Betty Levinson, is a  
member of the National Lawyer's  
Guild.

The government wants her to  
testify before the grand jury in  
connection with Swinton. They  
did not know she and Swinton  
had been in contact while  
underground. Perhaps, they  
reason, she knows about other  
fugitives, too. Perhaps she knows  
more than she claims, they  
reason. The chorus, by this time,  
has begun to drone. It speaks of  
collaboration and dichotomized  
issues, alternatives like fighting  
and suicide. It does not sing of  
deepening fragmentation  
within. The chorus will continue  

this same drone for the duration  
of the play.

Scene 3: A woman is talking with  
Fred Cohn about his statements  
in court. About his non-defense  
of Alpert's position. Informed  
sources in New York tell us that  
Cohn admits knowing that Alpert  
did not turn in Swinton. But  
Cohn, the sources say, is still  
angry about Alpert’s repudiation.
