U.S. Office Of Terrorism Targets FALN Members

Susan Goding

On July 24th, 1981, a 12th
member of the FALN (Puerto
Rican Independence Movement)
was convicted of charges of
seditious conspiracy to over-
throw the government. This
trial, of Oscar Lopez, dif-
fered from the trials of the
other 11 in that Alfredo Med-
ez was produced as a witness
for the prosecution. Mendez,
one of the other 11, who had
been held incommunicado by
the government since April 28
appeared in court on July 23
to turn on his comrades and
his nation with lies aimed at
discrediting the Puerto Rican
independence movement. Lopez
confronted Mendez, catching
him in his own lies and ex-
posing him as a traitor.

Mendez was not the only
FALN member the government
pressured to collaborate. On
Friday, July 30th, 8 days
after Mendez testified, 8
FBI and assorted police went
to Dwight Correctional Center
where 4 of the women POWs
are held. They met separately
with Dylcia Pagan Morales,
Carmen Valentin, Lucy Rodri-
guez and Alicia Rodriguez.

Dylcia Pagan describes the
encounter: "Once in the room,

the door was locked behind me.
The 2 agents extended their
hands to greet me. I immediat-
ely asked who they were and
what they wanted...Without
hesitation the male agent,
Walsh, sat behind his desk

and with a quasi smile said,
‘After all, Freddie Mendez got
a very good deal. He talked to
us. The details I can't dis-
close, but I can assure you
we can offer you the same.

You have information we want.
In return for it, we can make
you a very good offer.'"

Pagan and the others turned
down the offer.

Pagan summed up the lesson:
"What we can learn from this
experience is that we can ex-
pect the U.S. Office of Ter-
rorism to be amongst us on a
frequent basis. Secondly, the
U.S. government is diligently
attempting to pacify and break
the independence movement
which fosters armed struggle.
They sincerely think that
independence for Puerto Rico
is a negotiable item like all
the commodities of the multi-
national corporations..."

their stand there. 38 congr-
esspeople who had signed a
support letter and the law-
yers involved convinced them
it was in their interest to
follow it to its legal con-
clusion so the government
would have no recourse. Later
Russell Means made a state-
ment to the effect that “...
we know it is going to come
right back down to what hap-
pened on the 8th, the govern-
ment is not going to give up
the land, it is going to play
all the games it wants to
play but ultimately it is
going to come down to the
fact that we are going to
have to make a stand.“ It was
also said "...the media has
the audacity to come here and
ask us if we are armed, and
what do they expect? We live
in the belly of the monster,
we are a few people trying to
defend our rights and they
have all the weapons, includ-
ing nuclear weapons that they
are free to use at any point
and have on people and they

(the media) have the nerve

to ask us if we are armed.
And we say Damn right, we are
armed with the pipe, with our
spiritual presence, with the
dedicated people here, with
axes, shovels, along with
everything we need to defend

ourselves."

I think it is important be-
cause so often people confuse
who really have the arms and
the buffer zone is there as
a statement of non-violence
and we accept the fact that
people have the right to self
determination and a right to
defend themselves because it
has been proven that the
government has used arms on
defenseless people. Non-
violence is a tactic and the
people in the buffer zone
have agreed that the Indian
peoples have a right to de-
fend themselves and that
makes it a little different
than just being committed to
non-violence. We have had
problems with people saying,
"I just can't stand the

thought of the nationalist freedom
fighters. Trade union activ-
ists are being jailed without
cause or on trumped up charg-
es and released. The Grand
Jury is being used for the
political persecution of all
activists.

The same excuses from the
50's and 60's are being used
to justify the actions against
civil liberties. The "inter-
national connection" has been
the theme of investigations.

tional terrorist groups."

And since the new Senate

Subcommittee on Security and
Terrorism, headed by Jeremiah
Denton (R-AK), has targeted
“international links" of
domestic groups for investi-
gation, Pagan's warning to ex-
pect the U.S. Office of Terr-
orism to be amongst us on a

frequent basis cannot be taken
lightly.

people can't have guns, they
can't defend themselves.

The buffer zone has decided
that ultimately it will be a
personal decision as to what
we will do in times of viol-
ence, there are certain
strategies, but the people
have to be committed enough
to the issues or committed to
an understanding of what will
take place and an acceptance
of it.

There has been a blackout
of news about the Camp, but
the national media was there
on Sept 8, 9, they were asked
to leave at confrontation
time. The people who stayed
were the alternative press.
They stayed in the Camp and
they filmed and documented
and the trust is in these
people. We have limited

As in all national strug-
gles, it is up to us to
understand the struggles of
Indian peoples through read-
ing books about the cultures
of the different tribes,
about the struggles the peo-
ples have had and are now
having. For the Lakota peo-
ples life is a battlefield
every day and we have no
concept of what that is like.
People on the reservation do
not have fine medical care,
do not have good transport-
ation, do not have access to
good markets, just daily
living is a struggle. What
federally funded social
programs that existed on and
off the reservation have
started to be cut down or cut
out. Many houses on the res-
ervation have outdoor water
pumps and toilets, floors
are hard earth and winters
are cold. The government
patrols the reservation and

puts people's lives in jeopardy

daily.
