WD...
From Page 1

“You will not be allowed to
march with those signs,”

Roderick replied.

After much more discussion
and argument, the workshop
voted to support the WD march.
The feminists present, in dis-
agreement with this decision,
asked to submit a minority re-
solution to the general RFBO
body.

The minority resolution basic-
ally presented a feminist analy-
sis of the inseparability of pat-
riarchy and capitalism, and
stated feminist views on indivi-
dual solutions, the nuclear fami-
ly, and self-determination for all
women.

After the reading of the minor-
ity statement there followed ap-
proximately fifteen minutes of
debate. The feminists were
variously called racists, asked to
separate patriarchy and capital-
ism and to name which came
first, and accused of “wasting”
the organization's time with
“bullshit.” A vote followed, nine
people voted not to support the
IWD march and approximately
26 voted to support it.

Everybody went home angry.

The RFBO meeting was on
Saturday, February 14. On Tues-
day, February 17, what would
normally have been a Feminism
and Anarchy class at the Woman
to Woman School, became a
meeting to disperse informa-
tion and organize around the
WD march. Approximately
twelve women were present,
those not in the class having
learned of the meeting by word-
of-mouth.

Leaflet

The group decided to put to-
gether a leaflet, stating their
agreement with the demands of
the march as feminists define
those demands. This leaflet was
written in a series of meetings
taking place over the following
two weeks. More than twenty
women had input on the writing
of the leaflet.

The group decided to call
themselves Lesbian/Feminist
Workers.

The leaflet read as follows:

Take International
Women’s Day
Back for Women

AS WE MARCH TODAY IN
RECOGNITION OF OUR
PAST VICTORIES, WE
MUST NOT FORGET THE
STRUGGLES WE HAVE YET
TO FACE. THERE ARE STILL
THOSE IN THE WORKING
CLASS WHO WOULD
LABEL THE CONCERNS OF
MODERN FEMINISTS AS
IRRELEVANT OR REFOR-
MIST. ONCE AGAIN WE
ARE CALLED UPON TO DE-
MONSTRATE THAT WE, AS
WOMEN, UNDERSTAND
OUR OWN OPPRESSION
AND KNOW WHAT IS
NECESSARY TO END IT.
Around the turn of the

century, working class
women — undeterred by
those fathers, husbands,
brothers, and sons who
could push aside women’s
needs as “bourgeois” —
demanded that their op-
pression be recognized as
part of the working class
movement. Women’s pres-
sure forced the Austrian
workers movement to sup-
port women’s suffrage in
conjunction with the work-
ing class movement. On
March 8, 1908, to show
their support of women’s
issues, women and men in
Austria established the first
International Women’s Day.
By 1911, International
Women's Day was observed
in many European
countries and women's
issues had moved to the
forefront of working class
struggles. RESISTANCE TO
THE CURRENT RADICAL
FEMINIST MOVEMENT BY
ELEMENTS OF THE LEFT
PROVES THAT THEY HAVE
NOT LEARNED THE LES-
SONS OF HISTORY.

We support the demands
of this march as working
women, as radical femin-
ists, and as lesbians.

Full Equality for
Women— We define Capi-
talism/Patriarchy, includ-
ing the states, institutions,
and individuals who sup-
port and perpetuate it, as an
enemy of all women. As
woman-identified women
WE WILL DEFINE OUR-
SELVES AND OUR OPPRES-
SION AND ESTABLISH THE
CRITERIA OF OUR “EQUAL-
ITY.” We, as working
women, must struggle with
more than on-the-job
issues. Some issues which
we are dealing with in
Denver include women in
prison, rape and street har-
assment, grand juries,
child care/welfare/food
stamp cut-backs, un-
employment and under-em-
ployment, lay-offs and job
discrimination, health care,
the oppression of lesbians,
mothers, and single
women, and sex-role
stereotyping. We support
women’s right to organize in
the workplace, which in-
cludes the home.

Down With Imperialism
— Imperialism is an
economic and cultural sys-
tem based on competition,
aggression, and domina-
tion of one group by
another. We recognize the
parallels between men’s
control of women and U.S.
imperialist domination of
other countries. RAPE IN
ALL FORMS MUST BE
ABOLISHED.

Support the Struggles of
Third World Peoples— We
align ourselves with the
people of the Third World in
their struggle for freedom
from U.S. and all other
forms of imperialism. We
support the right of Third
World and all women to
think and to choose a life-
style for themselves, be it as
wife and/or mother, as
woman-identified woman,
as lesbian, or as single
woman. WHILE WE, AS
FEMINISTS, DO NOT WISH
TO PERPETUATE THE NU-
CLEAR FAMILY, WE OP-
POSE ATTEMPTS OF THE
STATE TO UNDERCUT
WOMEN'S RIGHT TO SELF-
DETERMINATION, BE IT
THROUGH WELFARE RE-
GULATION, FORCED
STERILIZATION, OR ANY
OTHER MEANS.

The leaflet, in English and
Spanish, was distributed
throughout Denver. It was at-
tempted, wherever possible to
post them just slightly to the left
of leaflets posted by the IWDC.
Support

Various local groups were
contacted to explain the at-
tempts of the IWDC to exclude
lesbians and feminists from the
march. Denver groups which
either refused to support the
march or withdrew their sup-
port from it over this issue in-
cluded: National Lawyers Guild,
Young Socialists Alliance,
Meccha (a metropolitan State
College Chicano group), and
Youth Against War and
Fascism.

There was some discussion of
the role of men in women’s
struggle: one man, responding
to Morgan Starchild’s separatist
position, was moved to inform
her that “no matter what you do,
you can’t go anywhere without
the seed that is in me!” (pointing
to his penis).

Some time was spent by
panelists and audience alike
vying for the primacy of various
oppressions, i.e. patriarchy vs.
imperialism vs. capitalism vs.
the ruling class oppression of
the working class.

One point of interest was that
both minority women on the
panel, as well as most minority
workers from the audience,
were putting their energies into move-
ments that speak coherently to
the specific issues of their situa-
tion.

Discussion continued well
beyond the advertised five
o'clock limit, but this reporter left
before it ended, with the dis-
tinct impression that much more
can be accomplished by women
discussing women's issues
while the men are elsewhere:
dealing with their own sexism, if
they are really that committed to
women's struggle.

On Friday, March 5, a meet-
ing of L/FW was held at the
Woman to Woman Center.
Twenty women were present to
paint banners, make armbands,
and discuss security precau-
tions for the march. It was
known that every attempt would
be made by the IWDC to prevent
the group of feminists from
marching.

In anticipation of the WDC
turning to the state for aid, law-
yers were contacted and a bail
fund was arranged.

The morning of Saturday,
March 6, approximately 50
women, 10 children, and 5 men
gathered at Woman to Woman
Center. A brief practice was
held, to be sure that defenses
were strong.

Some members of the October
League had said that they would
“take the banners away” from
the feminist group. An official
representative of OL tele-
phoned a member of L/FW to
state that OL parade marshals
would prevent them from
marching with “unauthorized”
banners.

The feminists discussed the
possibility of a violent confron-
tation. It was decided that if a
fight started, it would not be
initiated by L/FW, but that the
banners would not be surren-
dered and the group was deter-
mined to march. Everyone as-
sociated with L/FW was given
an armband and cautioned not to
become separated from the
group.

The feminists proceeded in a
group to Curtis Park, at 23rd and
Curtis, where the march was to
begin. There a first confronta-
tion with the police occurred over
whether a truck carrying children
of L/FW members would be
allowed in the march. The
parade permit called for only two
trucks. After a brief consulta-
tion, the police decided that the
L/FW truck would be allowed in
the march line and that the
L/FW contingent should march
behind their truck.

Immediately following this,
several persons associated with
the October League approached
the L/FW group. They
asked to speak to the spokes-
person. When informed that
there was no spokesperson, they
informed the entire feminist
group that they would “not be al-
lowed to march” with the ban-
ners that they were carrying.
The banners in question read,

“Lesbian/Feminist Workers,”
“Support Inez Garcia — Self De-
fense is Our Right,” “Stop Wel-
fare/Daycare Cuts,” “Support
Custody Rights for Lesbian
Mothers,” “End Racism — Sup-
port Third World Struggles,” and
“Take International Women’s
Day Back for Women.”

The L/FW group, arms linked
in solidarity and defense, re-
plied that International
Women's Day is our day, and
that the right to define women’s
oppression belongs to women.
The feminists stood firm in their
determination to march.

Road Block

Meanwhile, the IWDC con-
tingent of the march was for-
ming up in the street. The IWDC
group was much smaller than
had been expected, having lost
their minority and women's
support. The march began to
proceed down the street. As
L/FW attempted to fall in line,
approximately 15 members of
the October League formed a
line across the street and re-
fused to let them pass.

Since the forward contingent
of the march was rapidly moving
away, L/FW decided to attempt
to sweep around one side of the
OL line. When the two groups
met, OL members attempted to
grab banners away from the
women of L/FW. A brief scuffle
ensued. Both factions sepa-
rated their own members from
the fray. Though some banners
were damaged, L/FW lost pos-
session of none. No one was
seriously injured.

At this juncture, the police, ob-
stensibly present for “traffic
control,” intervened. They in-
formed L/FW that, the parade
permit having been issued to the
IWDC, the feminists would not
be allowed to march in the
street.

Despite L/FW protests that
the IWDC had advertised the
march as public and protests by
L/FW lawyers that the police
were interfering with First
Amendment rights, the police
refused to relent. The police con-
ceded, however, that they could
not prevent the feminists from
marching on the sidewalks.

The OL group, urged on by a
male speaker, marched in the
street. And the feminists, the
women, marched on the side-
walk, chanting “Women united
will never be defeated.”
