last three years trying to save  
4 million dollars of welfare  
grants reflects the inadequacy  
and incompetency of such a  
program. However, Congress  
still chose to fund it again.  
WIN program became the  
vehicle to implement the  
Talmadge Amendment.

In November of 1971, Nixon  
vetoed a child care bill which  
proposed free child care  
centers to families earning  

less than $4,000.00 a year.  

These child care centers  
would have been communi-  
ty-administered, yet his rejec-  
tion was based on the  
reasoning that child care  
centers were a threat to the  
most fundamental institution  
in this country - the family!

The child care centers,  
Nixon reasoned, would offer  
more opportunity for women  
to leave the family and go to  
work. It is ironic that a year  
later, the poor welfare Chica-  
na is mandated (by the  
Talmadge Amendment) to  
leave her home to look for  
so-called “employment” or  
“training” and to leave her  
children at child care centers.  
Where was Nixon’s veto this  
time around?

Mothers Cannot Choose

It should be emphasized  
that the welfare mother is  
mandated to leave her child-  
ren at a child care center if  
there is one available. If she  
rejects the child care center  
because of its location, its  

facilities, its program, or its  
personnel, she will be “dere-  
gistered”--rendered ineligible  
for welfare. Thus, if the center  
is not bilingual, bicultural and  
totally negates the family life  
style as well as usurping the  
authority of the parent, the  
Chicana on welfare has no  
right to accept or reject  
programs concerning the wel-  
fare and education of her  
children. Presently, the num-  
ber and the quality of available  
child care centers is insuffi-  
cient to meet the working  
mothers’ needs, especially the  
poor working mother.

If the Chicana is forced to  
put her children into educa-  
tional centers which have  
traditionally failed her people,  
her children may become  
drop-outs at a much earlier  
age. The child’s life can be  
surrounded by not only racist,  
monolingual, monocultural  
institutions, but the child can  
also come to contend with the  
stigma and harassment en-  
countered from the educa-  
tional institutions towards  
people on welfare. Unfortu-  
nately, the taxpayer accuses  
the child as the source of his  
financial burden. Welfare  
mothers want to prevent this  
victimization of their children.

Amendment

—Jay Schatz  
CWRL Challenges Welfare

The Chicana Welfare Rights  

organization challenges the  
Talmadge Amendment to real-  
ly deal with the problems of  
welfare. In doing so, it hopes  
to work for a program which  
will provide good training and  
valuable jobs. In addition, it is  
striving to have the work and  
the rights of poor women  

recognized.

In general, minimum wage  
laws are applicable to all  
industries and occupations  
except domestic service and  
farm workers. The Talmadge  
Amendment creates a new ca-  
tegory of workers who are also  

exempt from the minimum  

wage law - the welfare recipi-  
ent worker. In order to insure  
that people really get off, or  
stay off welfare, the standard  
minimum wage should in-  
clude all working people. In  
addition, a welfare recipient  
should receive the same  
salary as other workers doing  
the same job.

Chicana Welfare Rights  
requires all training programs  
to include a community labor  
council to help identify the  
needs of the labor market in  
order to prevent wasting time  
in being trained for obsolete  
jobs with no future. Jobs  
should be open for individual  
advancement in that field. The  
quality of training should be  
sufficient and adequate rather  
than provide instant short-  
lived panaceas.

Traditionally, civil service  

jobs have used tests as a  
selection process in hiring.  
These tests do not necessarily  
reflect the kind of jobs applied  
for. Chicana Welfare Rights  
recommends that training  
include preparation for civil  
service jobs. It feels civil  
service test requirements  
should be withdrawn, or  
substituted through partici-  
pation in the training pro-  
gram.

In the case of college  
scholarships or other valuable  
training, equal recruitment  
should exist for both men and  
women. According to the  
Talmadge Amendment, un-  
employed fathers and youths  
sixteen years and older were  
identified as priority targets in  
the WIN training program.  
CWR believes that this atti-  
tude ignores the fact that the  
majority of adults on welfare  
are women as heads of  
household. These women  
should have equal opportunity  
in training and for employ-  
ment.

A widow of 56 years, having  
raised five children who are  
now over the age of 18 years,  
cannot receive social security  
benefits. Her children are too  
old for aid to dependent  
children, and she is too young  
for the old age plan (for people  
62 years and over). As far as  
her employability is con-  
cerned, there is little demand  
for a woman her age in the  
labor market. Her employable  
status is greatly reduced  
because housework and  
motherhood are not counted  
as work experience.

Three Point Program

CWR has identified a three  
point program insuring the

can be improved; in another  
sense people making produc-  
tions for profit can share some of  
their resources to help  
proliferate skills and access. A  
balance can be reached if people  
shared similar attitudes regard-  
ing the need for true alter-  
natives. Unfortunately, the taste  
for money and technical  
chauvinism have pushed some  
of the public access people  
beyond caring whether they  

create alternatives or not. Just  

as creating a profitable business  
out of Cable television has  
become the only concern of  
companies rather than offering  
relevant programming as an  
alternative to Broadcast and  
rather than promoting use of the  
media by the public to create  
their own TV.

Gladly enough Community  
Television is gaining strength. In  
places around the country at-  
titudes are changing and oppor-  
tunities for women look more  
promising. At Input in  
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the staff  
includes skilled and dynamic  
women. They stress training  
rather than production and  
maintain a library of community  
produced tapes. In another part  
of the country, a group of women  
have leased an entire channel of  
Cable and are producing video  
exclusively for, about and with  
women. Minority women are ac-  
tive producers of “survival”  

rights of poor women on  
welfare. First, recognition of  
woman's work in the home as  
a mother and as a housekeep-  
er must be provided through  
Social Security benefits. Se-  
cond, women on welfare  
should be given the right to  
choose whether to work in the  
home, or out of the home.  
Third, free, 16-hour commun-  
ity controlled child-care cen-  
ters must be provided for  
families earning less than  
$4,000.00 a year.

It is an injustice when the  
Equal Rights Amendment,  
which demands equal pay for  
equal work, does not extend  
to the mother whose work is  
not considered part of the  
labor force. Society forgets  
that she is responsible for the  
maintenance of the labor  
force. The ERA is a victory  
only for the “recognized and  
organized” employed. The  
“unrecognized” worker - the  
mother - has still to fight for  
her equal rights in order to  
secure payment for her job,  
and to secure social security  
benefits for her service.

The middle class commun-  
ity as well as the low-income  
community must be educated.  
They must be made aware of  
the fact that the welfare  
recipients are not the only  
victims of the educational and  
economic system. The great-  
est criminals - who hurt the  
taxpayer are the corporations  
which can legally avoid paying  
taxes and the landowners  
such as Talmadge of Georgia,  
who are subsidized not to use  
their land. It is not the people  
struggling for food, shelter  
and a decent job.

tapes in the Anacostia  
neighborhood of Washington,  
D.C. through a video group  
called Project Accountability.  
They spread helpful information  
about nutrition, health care,  
grocery shopping, etc., to their  
neighbors by showing these  
tapes in laundromats, hospital  
waiting rooms and on street cor-  
ners. Project Accountability  
even produced a tape about  
trash problems in a housing pro-  
ject, and they gave a special  
showing for City Council  
members, as they were too  
“occupied” to visit the  
neighborhood themselves.

And here in Denver, the  
Denver Community Video  
Center is actively promoting  
Community television. Through  
various special projects, an In-  
dividual’s Workshop program,  
and a newly emerging Social Ac-  
tion Television (SATV) Task  
Force, the Video Center is  
among those groups who  
believe that people have a right  
to participate in and have access  
to the organs of communications  
in this country. And since televi-  
sion is by far the most powerful  
media of this era, learning video  
skills is as vital to all of us as  
learning to read.
