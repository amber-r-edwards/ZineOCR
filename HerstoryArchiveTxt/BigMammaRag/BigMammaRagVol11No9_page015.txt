Jewish Lesbians  
from page 3  

this letter in the spirit of  
the long and continuing trad-  
ition of radical Judaism. This  
Yom Kippur, let us resolve to  
further educate ourselves a-  
bout the history and current  
conditions in the Middle East;  
push through our fears; dis-  
cuss the information and our  
feelings, criticize and let  
our thoughts be known. May  
peace and reconciliation be-  
come a reality for all of us.

Israeli Feminists  

Letter to the editor:  

We are Jewish feminists li-  
ving in Israel. We feel a  
need to speak for ourselves  
and a need to be heard by oth-  
er feminists around the world.  
We want to respond within  
the women's movement to the  
debate over present Israeli  
government policy, as well  
as to accusations of imperi-  
alism and racism directed at  
Israel. Underneath all this  
lies the basic question often  
debated in certain feminist  
circles: Does Israel have the  
right to exist?  

We are here in Israel be-  
cause we are expressing our  
identity as Jews and are a-  
ware of a long history of  
anti-Semitism. Israel has not  
solved that evil, but it is  
providing a place where Jews  
can live without the internal  
threat of expulsion or death  
which has steadily accompa-  
nied us throughout our histor-  
y. If Zionism means a move-  
ment that established and  
maintains a place that will  
ensure the survival of the  
Jewish people, then we are  
Zionists.  

We are feminists who are  
trying to confront patriar-  
chal violence, racism and  
sexism, and many times we  
are appalled at our country  
just as citizens of other  
countries are ashamed of  
their governments' policies.  
Having to depend on nation-  
hood for Jewish survival (a  
necessity in the modern world  
of nation-states) has tragic  
limitations, but we'd rather  
be able to live as free Jews  
in the world than commit sui-  
cide for the sake of what is  
"politically correct", agreed  
that committing suicide is  
not politically correct.  

We are desperate for peace  
and search for ways to solve  

the Jewish-Arab-Palestine  
problem. We freely criticize  
the present government and  
are not averse to hearing  
criticism from the outside.  
But our existence is not up  
for debate. This debate, how-  
ever intellectually sound,  

is anti-Semitism at its worst  
and a betrayal by our femin-  
ist sisters.  

We search to enter into di-  
alogue with all concerned  
persons, and reach out to  
groups and individuals alike.  

We offer our support to  
Jewish and non-Jewish femin-  
ists in the Diaspora who feel  
overwhelmed by anti-Semitic  
sentiment. We are open to  
sharing what it feels like  
to live in Israel.  

We offer our search for an  
open dialogue to all femin-  
ists with the clear under-  
standing that our right to  
exist is a given.

Sexual Exploitation  

Dear Editor:  

One consequence of the mil-  
itarization and modernization  
of Thailand is the sexual ex-  
ploitation of women. There are  
700,000 prostitutes in Thai-  
land because soldiers, tour-  
ists, businessmen take advan-  
tage of young women brought  
to Bangkok to provide sexual  
favors. Thailand has the worst  
VD record in the world. Tour-  
ist companies advertise the  
availability of Thai women.  
European men marry Thai women,  
bring them home and then aban-  
don them. There are an estima-  
ted 10,000 Thai women in Eur-  
ope and in other countries  
where they maintain themselves  
by domestic work or prostitu-  
tion. Anyone with information  
on the problem is urged to  
contact:

Lesbians And AA  

Dear Big Mama Rag,  

Thank you for your July is-  
sue and the article Lesbians  
and Alcoholism. I am very  
glad the feminist community  
is becoming aware of this  
increasing problem.  

I am a thirty-two year  
old lesbian and recovering  
alcoholic, and would like  
to share with you my exper-  
ience, strength, and hope.  

As I said, the article Les-  
bians and Alcoholism is ap-  
preciated, but I also feel  
that it was not entirely ac-  
curate in its representation  
of statistics regarding re-  
covery from alcoholism and  
otherwise painted a rather  
grim picture for the woman  
who still suffers and is  
looking for a way out. Also,  
in view of the fact that  
about one third of all sui-  
cides in the U.S. are com-  
mitted by alcoholics, I feel  
it is necessary to be entire-  
ly open-minded about this  
subject.  

The article stated that  
although there are some gay  
groups of A.A., (by the way  
I belong to one of these  
groups) the recovery rate  
is dismally low - I believe  
3% was stated. This is a  
gross misrepresentation. For  
those who make it to Alcoho-  

lics Anonymous, the incidence  
of recovery is approximately  
75%.  

It is known by psycholo-  
gists, clergy and those of  
the medical profession that  
A.A. is the only type treat-  
ment for the disease of al-  
coholism which holds this  
sort of success rate.  

It was brought out in the  
article that A.A. is "deeply  
rooted in Christianity and  
Patriarchy". This seems to  
be a superficial observation  
on the part of the writer.  

Yes, it is true that the  
twelve steps of recovery con-  
tain the word "God", but it  
is also stated emphatically  
that one is completely free  
to choose the higher power -  
or greater power if you wish  
- of one's own understanding.  
Simply put, one can easily re-  
place the word "God" with the  
words "Great Goddess" and the  
program will work. The word  
"God" in the Twelve Steps is  
almost invariably followed by  
the words "as we understood  
him" or “her" if you wish.  

In view of the seriousness  
of this disease, alcoholism,  
I feel it would be wise to  
consider that the text Al-  
coholics Anonymous and the  
Twelve Steps were written in  
the late 1930's, a time of  
little enlightenment on femi-  
nist issues and I encourage  
any woman who feels she may  
have a drinking problem to  
seek help immediately and  
above all to keep an open  
mind.  

Yours truly,  
Linda Ss.
