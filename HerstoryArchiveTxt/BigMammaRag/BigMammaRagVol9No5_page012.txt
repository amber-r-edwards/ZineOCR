Chemical Straitjackets: Medication For Profit  
TTA  

(ed. note: In spite of the  
matter-of-fact nature of the  
following information on phe-  
nothiazines I found myself  
crying as I read it and at  
first I wasn't sure why. And  
then I knew—I had been plac-  
ed on Stelazine for about two  
years without being given any  
warning of its side effects:  
they only told me not to get  
out of bed too fast. To look  
back now I realize that I had  
been a walking example of the  
side effects listed below. At  
the time I thought I was re-  
ally losing control. I was  
living by myself at the time  
and would get up in the morn-  
ing for work and pass out  
while getting dressed and  
come to on the floor. I was  
then fired from my job be-  
cause of seeming to be slow  
and tired all the time. This  
only added to my depression  
and problems...and ended me  
back in the hospital. Lori  

This information on pheno-  
thiazines is important read-  
ing for all who have been or  
are now on any of these drugs.  
We have a right to know.  

The following is reprinted  
from Phoenix Rising an anti-  
psychiatric journal from Can-  
ada.  

THORAZINE AND OTHER PHENO-  
THIAZINES  

The phenothiazines - more  
commonly known as "major  
tranquilizers" or "anti-  
psychotic drugs" - are pro-  
bably the most powerful and  
dangerous psychiatric drugs  
in existence. Some critics  
(inmates included) call them  
“chemical straitjackets,"  
“chemical strong-arms," or  
“chemical lobotomies." How-  
ever, their advocates - vir-  
tually all psychiatrists -  
prefer to call them "medica-  
tion," "psychotropic drugs,"  
or "chemotherapy."  

Almost all psychiatric in-  
mates are given these drugs,  
and experience their many  
serious effects.  

~ Some of the most commonly  
prescribed phenothiazines  
are Thorazine (chlorproma-  
zine); Stelazine (trifluo-  
perazine); Mellaril (thior-  
idazine); Moditen, Modicate  
or Prolixin (fluphenazine);  
Trilafon (perphenazine) and  

~ Etrafon (perphenazine and  
amitriptyline).  

The "chemical revolution"  
in the treatment of the  
"mentally ill" began in the  
early 1950s, when Thorazine  

~Page 18 - Big Mama Rag, May, 1981  

was first discovered and  
used. During the 1960s and  
1970s, chemotherapy became  
psychiatry's treatment of  
choice.  

However, these drugs are  
extremely dangerous, gener-  
ally toxic, and sometimes  
fatal. When given in even low  
or moderate dosages for a few  
months, the phenothiazines  
exert almost total control  
over the person's physical  
and emotional life. Most  
people taking these drugs  
quickly become so weakened  
and apathetic that they are  
incapable of expressing any  
strong emotion or of showing  
spontaneity or direct action.  
People suffering these "side  
effects" may become convinced  
that they are really "going  
crazy" or "psychotic," par-  
ticularly if they have not  
been informed that the reac-  
tions are caused by the  
drugs.  

The phenothiazines produce  
many unpredictable non-muscu-  
lar and muscular effects.  

COMMON NON-MUSCULAR EFFECTS  

Drowsiness. Extreme fatigue,  
sleepiness and lethargy.  
This tends to be interpreted  
by psychiatrists as "uncoop-  
erative behaviour."  

Dryness of mouth.  

Blurred vision (especially  
near vision).  

Constipation.  

Weight gain. (Some people  
complain of increased appe-  
tite while on phenothiazines;  
the weight gain may be due  
to increased appetite or to  
general slowing of metabol-  
ism, which occurs with the  
drugs.)  

Nasal congestion.  
Changes in the EEG (wave  
pattern).  
Orthostatic hypotension (sud-  
den drop in blood pressure).  
This usually happens when the  
person stands up quickly from  
a lying-down or sitting posi-  
tion, with resulting dizzi-  
ness and faintness. Some  
people pass out briefly when  
this occurs. It is most com-  
mon at the beginning of drug  
"treatment" and in older  
persons.  

Impotence or loss of sexual  
drive.  

Sensitivity to sunlight.  
Severe allergic sunburn oc-  
curs when skin is exposed to  
sun, especially with people  
on high doses of Thorazine.  
Impaired thought and speech.  

LESS COMMON NON-MUSCULAR  
EFFECTS.  

Decrease in white blood cells  
(leukopenia and agranulocy-  
tosis). The latter, though  
rare, results in lessened  
resistance to infection and  
disease, and can be fatal.  
Increased likelihood of grand  
mal seizures, especially in  
people with a history of  
epilepsy.  

Allergic skin rash.  
Difficulty urinating.  
Irregularity or absence of  
menstrual periods.  

Lactation (swelling and se-  
cretion of milk in breasts).  
False pregnancy tests.  
Allergic type of hepatitis.  
Eye problem. Opacity of the  
lens or cornea of the eye be-  
cause of thickening. This  
occurs with Thorazine.  
Changes in the EKG (electro-  
cardiogram, or heartbeat  
tracings).  

Sudden death. People taking  
these drugs have died sudden-  
ly from no discernible cause.  
Such deaths may be due to  
heart failure or to asphy-  
xiation. The number of cases  
reported has been small  
(about 25 in English-language  
literature), but the unre-  
ported number may be far  
greater.  

COMMON TEMPORARY MUSCULAR  
EFFECTS  

Akathisia. Uncontrollable  
constant movement of part or  
all of the body, with the  
feeling of extreme tension  
and of being unable to sit  
still, sometimes with inabil-  
ity to sleep.  

Dystonia(s). Sudden muscle  
spasms of the neck, back,  
legs and/or face. Sometimes  
the eyes become painfully  
stuck in an upward gaze  
(oculogyric crisis).  
Pseudo-Parkinsonism. Increase  
in muscle tension which leads  
to rigidity of body, masklike  
face, shuffling walk (the  
"Thorazine shuffle"), hunched  
posture, tremors of the hands  
and drooling.  

COMMON PERMANENT MUSCULAR  
EFFECTS  

Tardive dyskinesia. A disorder  
of the central nervous system  
caused by any phenothiazine.  
Symptoms of T.D. include  
slow, rhythmic and involun-  
tary movement of the face  
and limbs; cheek-puffing;  
lip-smacking or lip-purs-  
ing; chomping or chewing

of the jaws; undulation of  
the tongue or repeated  
tongue thrusts in a "fly-  
catcher" movement; occa-  
sional stiffening of the  
neck and arms; difficulty  
in swallowing and speaking  
in severe cases; rotation  
of the ankles and toes; or  
wrist and finger movements.  

This syndrome is a definite  
indication of damage which is  
irreversible and permanent.  
Approximately 30% to 50% of  
people "maintained" on these  
drugs develop T.D. In one  
study, 43% of psychiatric  
outpatients developed T.D.  
after an average of four-and-  
a-half years on the drugs.  
Other studies have found  
rates as high as 56% among  
institutionalized people.  
Some people showed signs of  
T.D. after only eight months  
of medication.  

T.D. was first discovered  
in 1958. Fifteen years later,  
the psychiatric profession  
officially recognized this  
danger in a special editorial  
published in the April 1973  
issue of the Archives of Gen-  
eral Psychiatry. There is no  
known cure for T.D. except  
complete and immediate stop-  
page of the drug, which may  
only give temporary relief.  

To a limited extent, these  
“side effects" can be coun-  
tered by the administration  
of anti-Parkinsonian drugs,  
which usually reduce or mask  
the neuromuscular effects of  
the phenothiazines. Some com-  
monly prescribed anti-Parkin-  
sonian drugs are Artane, Co-  
gentin, Kemadrin, Akineton  
and Benadryl. However, these  
drugs have their own "side
