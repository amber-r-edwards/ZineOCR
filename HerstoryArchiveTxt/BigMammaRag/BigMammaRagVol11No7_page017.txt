The Feminist Arab-American  
Network (F.A.N.) is a new or-  
ganization of feminists of  
Arab heritage living in the  
US. This organization is an  
outgrowth of the long-term  
alienation we have experienced  
as Arab-Americans working  
within the US feminist move-  
ment, and as feminists within  
our Arab-American communities.  
F.A.N. is interested in col-  
lecting: Bibliographies on  
Arab women, personal and fami-  
ly histories, writings on top-  
ics of concern to Arab-Ameri-  
can feminists, info about lo-  
cal projects and activities in  
which you are involved. For  
more info, write: F.A.N., Box

Senior Action In A Gay Envi-

zing their new outreach cam-

SAGE most are the ones most  
difficult to locate--the ol-  
der lesbians and gays who are  
confined to their homes or to  
institutions. SAGE is deter-  
mined to identify and serve  
these members of our communi-  
ty. SAGE has also started an  
oral history project that will  
record the recollections of  
our oldest members. SAGE needs
