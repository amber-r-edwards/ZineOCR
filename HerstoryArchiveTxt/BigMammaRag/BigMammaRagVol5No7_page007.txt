As the federal government ends

of a camera through a tube in the

Representative Elizabeth Holtzman  
(D-NY) has introduced a bill, H.R.  
6399, designed to “plug a loophole"  
in the Equal Pay Act. The Equal Pay  
Act currently allows wage differen-  
tials when "based on any other fact-  
or than sex.” Holtzman's bill would  
narrow this provision specifically  
to exclude economic profitability  
as a factor on which employers can  
base a wage differential between  
employees doing similar work. Holtz  
man's move was spurred by the Su-  
preme Court's refusal to review an  
appellate court ruling which con-  
strued the Equal Pay Act to permit  
an employer's paying salesmen who  
sell men's clothing higher salaries  
than saleswomen who sell women's  
clothing.

The warden of the Ohio Reformatory  
for Women called in an outside riot  
squad July 6 to break up a peaceful  
sit-in by women protesting the con-  
ditions. Some 18 women were badly  
beaten and 16 were transferred to  
the men's prison in Columbus, Ohio.  
One woman had three seizures as a  
result of beatings. The women  
received no medical attention, exer-  
cise or showers for days after the  
incident.

The women had been protesting  
the medical care, food, slave pay,  
and commissary prices.

Protests should be sent to the  
warden.

Women Win Suit

A U.S. District Court has ordered  
the Dallas Independent School Dis-  
trict to pay over $1 million in back  
wages plus interest to 336 female  
custodians. The women had been  
paid less than male custodians doing  
equivalent work. The court order  
resulted from an Equal Pay Act law-  
suit filed by the U.S. Department  
of Labor; the school district must  
also immediately increase the wage  
rates of all female custodians to  
equal the rates paid male custodians.

Let It Ride

Lesbian feminists in Los Angeles  
are calling on all sisters across  
the country to join them in a  
FREEDOM RIDE! Pressing for lesbian  
visibility and gay rights at the  
IWY National Conference in Houston,  
Texas (Nov. 18-20) the project is  
in its early planning stages.

Plans so far include leaving  
the L.A. area several days before  
the conference, bus caravans stop-  
ping in cities along the way to  
hold actions or demonstrations and  
to pick up more women on their way.

The purpose is to bring lesbian  
visibility as a definable force to  
the conference by pressing for  
passage of all pro-feminist, pro-  
minority, and pro-gay resolutions.

A comprehensive review of oral  
contraceptive studies has yielded  
"no clear evidence" that the pill  
causes cancer. Saying that the  
issue of cancerous and noncancerous  
tumors is the longest standing and  
least resolved of all medical con-  
troversies surrounding the pill, re-  
searchers at George Washington Uni-  
versity Medical Center call their  
findings “encouraging,” but note  
that a basic lack of knowledge of the  
roles of hormones in tumor devel-  
opment still leaves the results of  
future research unpredictable. The  
researchers also confirmed previous  
reports that pill users seem less  
likely to develop benign breast  
tumors and more likely to develop  
benign liver tumors than non-users.

Tn Th e Moed

A few startling statistics intro-  
duce the problem of "mood" drugs:  
women use 70% of legally prescribed  
minor tranquilizers, the majority  
of major tranquilizers and 72% of  
all antidepressants. Jane L. Hollo-  
way presented these figures to the  
American Public Health Association  
in 1976, in a paper entitled "Women  
and Legal Drug Use." Holloway is one  
of a number of feminists trying to  
draw attention to the over-use of  
mood drugs as one of the major men-  
tal health problems facing U.S. wo-  
men.

Mood drugs are problematic for two  
reasons: (1) tranquilizers, barbit-  
uates and antidepressants often  
cause serious physical side effects  
in regular users; (2) such drugs  
tend to mask, or cover up, the emo-  
tional problems they are supposedly  
being used to "treat." These two  
objections to mood drugs are rela-  
tively easy to document. Some femin-  
ists, however, believe that they are  
just the tip of the iceberg; the  
real issue, they say, is that mood  
drugs are used to "pacify" the fe-  
male population. Such pacification,  
the thesis continues, is an integral  
part of a social order that keeps  
women "in their place” and inhibits  
individual and collective growth.

Valeur Improving

A recent article in womanSports  
magazine argues that social rather  
than biological factors have limited  
the performances of women athletes,  
and predicts that women's running  
and swimming times will eventually  
equal those of men.

Analyzing data on male and female  
track and swimming events, woman-  
Sports found that the gap has narrow-  
ed considerably in the past four  
decades. Both men and women have  
improved significantly over the  
years because of improved nutrition,  
more efficient and effective train-  
ing methods and the increased avail-  
ability of facilities, the magazine  
reports, but the fact that "the bio-  
logical differences between men and  
women may be much less significant  
in sports than has always been -  
assumed."
