Public Assistance

Kim Womantree

On Wednesday, February  
17, at 1:30 PM at the Colorado State Capitol, there was  
a hearing on House Bill 1193.

workfare

1193 is called by its supporters a "job diversion program"  
modeled after a pilot program in Weld County. The critics of  
1193 call it "workfare" and say it will only create  
more hungry, frustrated poor people. Three spoke in favor  
of 1193 - Ruth Prendergast, one of the 30 Republican sponsors  
of the bill - and two men who are wheels in Weld County social  
services. They said the program in Weld County is "successful"  
in spite of a 44% dropout rate. Six people testified against  
the bill.

Their testimony is as follows:  
Flo Mendez, member of the  
State Board of Social Services  
and a former welfare mother:  
1) HB 1193 is especially bad  
for ADC mothers. The bill is  
vague and says "any" person  
applying for public assistance  
would be diverted into this  
job program. People would work  
at public service jobs at a  
site the State determines for  
40 hours/week at $3.35/hour.  
This goes on for 6 weeks, then  
comes two weeks of "employability training," after which  
the recipient is supposed to  
get and keep a private sector job. If they don't or can't,  
they can't be in the program  
for 30 days. It's not clear  
whether or not an ADC mother  
could get a check in that 30  
days. What makes the bill  
bad for everyone is that the  
bill  

1) has nothing in it about  
assessing needs of people applying for public assistance  
for other kinds of help like  
food stamps, Medicaid, housing  
subsidies, etc. Most poor people need 1 or more of these  
services; this program could  
be a way for the bureaucracy  
to say, "You're working now,  
you don't need this stuff."

2) The 30-day time lag AFTER  
a person goes through the program and before they can get in  
it again if they can't get a  
job will "victimize people  
who are already victims," according to Ms. Mendez. She  

asks the question, "Who pays  
rent, buys food, pays bills,  
etc., during that 30 days?"

3) The bill proposes no job  
skills training--only whatever  
OJT you can get for 6 weeks  
at menial jobs. So in an  
economy with a 10% unemployment rate, basically the  
bill would channel people into  
dead-end jobs, if they can even find one. "There  
is a difference," Ms. Mendez  
reminded the Legislative Committee, "between training  
and slavery."

Slavery

4) All of the above would be  
hard for single mothers who  
would be channeled into this  
program instead of getting  
on AFDC. What makes it even  
worse for mothers is that  
there is no provision in the  

bill for funds for transportation, childcare, and other  
work-related expenses. This  
would presumably come out of  
the $3.35 an hour salary.  
5) Childcare funds are a  
must for single mothers. Under  
new Federal guidelines that  
1193 would be bound by,  
mothers with kids over the  
age of 3 would have to work.  
So mama with kids between  
3 and school age a) suffers  
hardship to pay for childcare  
b) imposes on family c) leaves  
the kids by themselves which  
leaves her open to charges of  
neglect & losing her kids.  
Ironically, this last is one  
of the few circumstances in  
which she could possibly get  
more money if she can get a  
sympathetic social worker.  
4) Ms. Mendez reminded the  
Committee that the majority  
of women who are on AFDC  
are on it because welfare  
has no adequate provision to  
collect child support because  
of the sexist system and the  
sexist men who father kids  
and abandon them.

A man who helps ADC mothers  
with legal aid said studies  
show workfare does not  
significantly reduce welfare rolls.

Joanne Williams, a Denver  
woman who was in a SET job  
readiness program, said, "You  
get six weeks of training. If  
you don't find a job in 2  
weeks, you don't get a check.  
That's not fair."

Josie Medina, another ADC  
mother who used to be employed  
at Cudahy before the lockout, said; "I think it stinks.  
This bill is just trying to  
make us poor people more  
poor." Of her SET training  
program, she said, "We have  
people in our class who are  
job-ready and can't find work.  
They get paid $30 a week on  
the program." Referring to  
the Cudahy strike and lockout  
(see BMR Oct 81 issue), she  
said, "If you're fired on a  
boss's whim, what happens?  
No money for a month. No as-  
surance of a job."

Hard Times Rally

On Saturday, February 13,  
about 150 people gathered in  
front of the Colorado State  
Capitol at noon for a Hard  

Times Rally and Soup Kitchen.  
The Alliance for Basic Human  
Needs, a coalition of many local activist groups, organized  
the rally. Speakers talked  
about the effects of cutbacks  
and urged legislative and electoral action to fight these cutbacks.  
Fern Taylor reminded us that  
the cafeterias in schools cut  
300,000 kids off of school  
lunches because of the budget  
cuts. She said that the policy-makers are “anti-gay, anti-old,  
and anti-handicapped," and that  
the cuts will result in a lot  
of sickness because preventative  
medicine and immunization  
programs are being cut. Ms.  
Taylor finished,  

“Just because we are treated  
like dogs doesn't mean we  
have to roll over and play  
dead."

The Still Ain't Satisfied  
Feminist Singers were part of  
the program. They sang songs  
from the feminist and gay movements, and from the resistance  
of Chile.  

Lorraine Garcia of the Alliance  
reminded us that, "We must  
not be silent when our  
survival is at stake."

One refreshing thing about  
the rally was the "soup kitchen" idea. A lot of street  
people and unemployed people  
came. It was good to see new  
faces instead of just the  
same old crowd of leftists.  
All in all, it was a good be-  
ginning and this writer hopes  
to see coalitions built and  
work continue. The Alliance  
for Basic Human Needs has various action committees which  
people can join: They are sponsoring a statewide People's  
Congress March 13. See your  
BMR calendar.
