on the dark side of the moon

Promises

I will meet you there  
on the dark side of the moon  
(the parts they've not touched)  

I will tell you what’s inside me  
about the sticks of dynamite  
laid side by side  

in all the beds I’ve ever slept in.  
I open and close,  

open and close,  

and still sometimes  
I am drawn back  

I offer part reason part madness.  

I want a marker somewhere  
that will tell me where my home is.  
I want to know that women love,  

I am next to you  
you've not seen me yet.  
I am darker than you,  

I am disguised.  

I collect the barbed wire  
Strung between my lovers.  

I save it as proof  

that only change will save us.  

the Questions  

searching the gravestones for my name.  

I collect the words that pass as meaningful;

I THINK THEY THINK  

I think he doesn’t like me.  

I think she wants him to leave me.  
She wants me to be alone.  

She wants to be me and not so alone.  

I think they think I’m weird.  

Everything I say is wrong so I may as well not say anything.  
I think they think that it would be nice if I leave.  

They’re only pretending to like me.  

Maybe it would be good if I left.  

I could stop thinking what they're thinking.

I've given up nailing my rusty shutters tight.  

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS  

He’s gone,  

Seven years now,  
Who tended my  
Fears and guilts  
So tenderly.  
They served him.  

Cratered,  

Like old ruins of rapacity  
In these mountains,  
Overgrown and hidden now.  
And quiet.  

Carol Hille  

Can you touch me when you're angry?  
Will you tell me what has made you?  
Will you meet me on the dark side of the moon?  

What do you offer as proof?

The poetry which was submitted for this issue was huge -- in both  
quality and quantity. Ellen Marie Bissert, editor of Thirteenth  
moon, has contributed some excellent work. Women who have  
possibly never published before are sending in their poems. If this  
is a sign, it is a good one. Let it flow.

What will all the birds do who depended on bits from the house  
And those who plant their nest in the porch venetian blinds  
When the cozy folds of this rotting house make way?  

The dogs are unbearable  

They are a reason to make the weeds grow in the garden  

And Bootsie, jawless, cannot chew another bone  

Without gratitude for another day.  

Who will look toward your room and be afraid?  

Those who love beauty as you?  

I could stay home forever - there's room to grow - already the  
basement inspires like a cool vine promising aftertaste  

What will the tools do with their new owner? A '49  
Studebaker pick-up truck that doesn’t pass 30 until it sees  
The light of country fields  

The life I lived here that didn’t go anywhere  

But away  

The tidal wave that caught you is frozen beneath the earth.
