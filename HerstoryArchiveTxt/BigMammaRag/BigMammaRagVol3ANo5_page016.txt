Mother Moon

passed me by one month
in transition from
manmade to

Her Cycle

as if to reprimand me

for betrayal to
premeasured linear time
allocated by man-chemical

Her grace

moved through me

warm sticky red

between my thighs

ending the feeling of disharmony
three quarters moon glad.

When You Finally Flip Out

Break the pencils.
Let them know you exist.
Tell yourself nothing matters.
Burn the book, find a match
if you can.
Go down in the elevator.
Push aside security guards.
Tear up your I.D. before them.
Leave bloody footprints in the lobby.

Kiyomizo

The smell of flowers through the thick smell of incense,
candle prongs sticking up from wax puddles

like rows of Giacometti sculpture

cheesecloth kimono stamped from the rouge pots

of the temple,

the city is hazed over in the foggy heat.

In the pines, moss grows thick

and cool over roots, like the damp fur of a dog.
I run my finger over it.

The barbed wire fence rusts a rich copper
rough as coral, crumbly as dried flowers,
a triple-strand necklace around the bushes.

A butterfly, one pale yellow stripe down each black wing,
flying, a yellow vibration in a field of black,

a bumble bee, silent.

A boy told me of the moths of Asia.

“They are beautiful,” he said, “but they are moths.”

Night

The night, like a raven
glides between us.

Dreams pull us by the hair.

Our bodies hang

like stripped skins

in a tannery.

A guillotine

beheads the day

with a rusty shriek.

“Lies, lies, compromise!

Women who bear thorny clouds
pass under doorways,

whores covered with cigarette burns,
bloody fetuses slip through transoms.
I open up my palm

and am alone in the dark.

Your breathing is like

the pulse

of an incorruptibly distant star.

We are someone else.

Final divorces
are granted at night.

Lili Bita

The First Death Poem

Death is the smooth face on the back
of the bald man’s head

turned away,

light pouring in around him like juice,
making his businessman’s suit black
as shame. I am a vulgar fan

of life on any terms.

At any cost — life after

a stroke, life that is just an idea
drooling down a cane,

my obscene

preference for life comes

hot on the heels of no knowledge
but several lovers taken away
forever in death's sealed van,
leaving me doting

on breath itself,

a terrible Sunday School hangover black
as a headache, oh

no

don't

tell me it’s a kind of faith

in life, but the little mongoloid
baby with a hole in her heart has
a living animal soul behind

the half-dark screens of her eyes.

Her mother says
each time

pneumonia goes around I just
pray she'll catch it.

Poems to Two Women

1. In Lieu

Dear Meg,
I wanted you to come

And the bald-faced man in the oil-black suit, dear,

waits outside on the porch. Newspapers write you this poem
sail through him to land like slaps but it won't be the same
on the cheek of the house.

II. To Martha, for the class is over

He waits politely. My dear, Meg, Martha, I want to touch you
most of the time you are beautiful because I have to leave.
There’s no hurry. When we talk
It's all his. In the rain that fell
Meg, come into my life, for May serenade.

Pay with me in it we sat close on a bench,
Some nights wanted to pretend spinning fantasies,
he asks for the baby for just a few days, butterfly wings, dead cats.
I slip a cabbage leaf outside, that we lived. Two witches, delighting in secrets
rich with veins as a purple placenta in the same place, that talk turns to spells.
Dear Meg, yet long before that day

you had ceased being a student;
maybe from the time you first
gave me yourself
sitting on the porch one word at a time.
Such long hours I have saved all your poems.
Asking for the baby I accept your magic
asking for me as you accept mine.
Asking for a face
wanting to be liked. If Martha, this poem
can be a light brush
of my finger on your hair.

Pieces

Mind breaks

in four pieces.

One for your morning coffee.

One for them and their monkey friends.

And two for the corporation show.
