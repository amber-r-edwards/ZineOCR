Lakewood Lesbian

Carol Mueller, a Lakewood lesbian,  
has been ordered to give up custody  
of her two children, because of what  
Judge Winston Wolvington termed her  
"severe" homosexuality. In addition,  
Mueller was ordered to pay her ex-  
husband $200 a month in child support.  

After finding that both Carol and  
John Mueller were fit and loving par-  
ents, Golden District Judge Wolvington  
ordered Mrs. Mueller to relinquish  
custody of her 9-year-old daughter  
and 4-year-old son.  

“I think that the problem of the homo-  
sexuality of the mother is severe now,  
with the oldest child being age 9,  
and can't help but become more severe as  
the children go into puberty, adoles-  
cence, and an effort is made to raise  
the children," the judge said.  

When asked by the Rocky Mountain  
News why he viewed her homosexuality  
as a problem for the children, the  
judge said he considered the "role  
models, environment, and the kind of  
people they (the children) will be in  
touch with." "When it (a homosexual  
relationship) goes on in the home it  
can be an adverse factor," Wolvington  
said.  

The father also has problems of de-  
pression and anger caused by Carol  
Mueller's homosexuality and the resul-  
ting divorce, the judge said. But  
"every indication is that the father's  
anger and depression will go away and  
that the mother's problem will not  
go away as easily," he said.  

Carol Mueller's lawyer, Alan Bucholtz,  
said he was "thunderstruck" by the  
decision and would file a motion for  
a new trial within two weeks. If that  
motion is denied, he will appeal the  
decision to the Colorado Court of  
Appeals.  

"There is case law in Colorado that  
says sexual preference is not an  
issue (in this type of case), nor is  
any conduct that doesn't affect the  
relationship between parent and child,"

Safe House  

Safe House, a shelter for battered  
women, will be able to continue its  
service now until at least December  
15th. The reprieve came when two oil  
companies chose the option given to  
them by the courts of donating to the  
shelter in lieu of paying a court fine  
for misuse of federal oil and gas  
leasing lotteries.  

Safe House was threatened with clos-  
ing when earlier this year Denver  
Social Services cut off its funding.  

Safe House, a long-term shelter with  
a nationally known residential treat-  
ment program, offers groups in assert-  
iveness training, consciousness rais-  
ing, parenting and self-defense. Child-  
ren participate in play therapy and in  
groups and individual sessions where  
they are encouraged to express their  
feelings. Safe House also provides  
community education, which ranges from  
speaking to church groups and high  
school classes on rape, incest and  
battering, to providing in-services to  
health care professionals and police.  
It also sponsors support groups for  
rape victims and battered women which  

Bucholtz said. "Plainly and simply,  
homosexuality has no bearing on wheth-  
er someone is a good parent.”  

-Mom's Apple Pie-  

In 1978, Mueller began working at a  
land title company where she met and  
became intimately involved with a wo-  
man co-worker. When she revealed her  
feelings to her husband, the marriage  
began to break apart. Shortly there-  

after, Carol began divorce proceedings.  

Wolvington's decision overturns the  
recommendation of a District Court re-  
feree who studied the case. In a Nov.  
1979 report, the court referee con-  
cluded that Mueller's homosexual rela-  
tionship “had no effect on the child-  
ren" and was not a factor in the cus-  
tody decision. The referee concluded  
that Mueller should have custody of  
the couple's children and that John

The line for battered women, open 24  
hours, is 388-4703.  

Mueller should pay her $325/month  
child support.  

Dr. David Muller, a Denver psychia-  
trist who evaluated the family during  
the divorce proceedings, and Thomas  
Meehan, who conducted an evaluation  
for the Jefferson County Department of  
Social Services, both recommended that  
Mueller retain custody of the children.  

Muller reported that Mueller had  
raised her children “very satisfactor-  
ily" thus far and that her domestic and  
parental skills were “considerable.”  

"I do not believe that there would be  
any specific harm to the children re-  
sulting from their mother's homosexual  
relationship," Muller wrote.  

An appellate decision squarely on the  
issue of sexual preference as a “nega-  
tive" factor in a custody case would  
be a landmark in Colorado, according  
to James Wallace, law professor at the  
University of Denver.  

“There has been a case-by-case ero-  
sion of the traditional view that  
homosexuality makes one an unfit par-  
ent," Wallace said. "The trend now is  
that homosexuality, in and of itself,  
does not make one an unfit parent.  
Something beyond that must exist which  
negatively affects the parent's relat-  
ionship with the child.”  

Until 1967 courts rarely awarded  
custody to lesbian mothers. Now it's  
not unusual. The U.S. Supreme Court  
has refused to hear cases on the sub-  
ject. The trend in lower courts has  

ian Loses Kids  

been toward giving lesbian mothers  
custody.  

Homosexuality has been an issue in  
several Colorado cases. In 1978, Denver  
District Judge Al Lichtenstein found  
both parents fit as custodians and  
awarded custody to the lesbian mother.  

Lichtenstein said “the court is not  
to consider the conduct of a party  
that does not affect his relationship  
to the child." The children, he said,  
would have the “benefit of both love  
and affection they've observed" be-  
tween their mother and her homosexual  
lover.  

That same year, Judge Roger Cisneros  
denied the request of a lesbian mother  
to retain custody of her two children.  
But Cisneros noted that the woman's  
sexual preference was not an issue.  
"A lesbian would be a good mother,"  
but, he said she had other problems.  

In an unusual case in 1977, Juvenile  
Judge Orelle Weeks granted custody of  
a child to the former lover of a de-  
ceased lesbian, rather than to the  
child's aunt and uncle (See BMR Vol.5  
No.7, Aug/Sept 1977). The judge ruled  
the lesbian lover's sexual preference  
did not affect the child and wasn't  
related to her ability as a parent.  
The woman's stability and commitment  
to the child, and the child's attach-  
ment to her were major factors in  
the decision, Weeks said.  

None of those cases were appealed.

Woman Assaulted  
During Polygraph Test  

Sylvia Reynolds, a former employee  
of Weberg Furniture in Westminster,  
is suing Weberg and George L. Coon,  

a polygraph examiner for $150,000 in  
actual damages and $150,000 in puni-  
tive damages because she claims she  
was sexually assaulted during a poly-  
graph exam.  

After two cash drawer thefts, Weberg  
required all of its employees in book-  
keeping to take a polygraph exam. Dur-  
ing the exam, Reynolds says, Coon made  
sexual advances to her. After she  
complained about Coon to her em-  
ployer and to law enforcement author-  
ities, Coon then wrote a report accus-  
ing Reynolds of "deception" regarding  
the embezzlement.  

Because of that report and Reynolds’  
refusal to take another polygraph  
examination, she was fired.  

On January 10th, Reynolds and five  
Weberg cashiers went to the George L.  
Coon Agency, 7907 W. 16th Ave, to be  
tested.  

While strapped into the polygraph  
chair during a three-hour session,  
she says, Coon embraced her, then  
stooped to his knees and forcibly  
kissed her. He also suggested that  
they spend the night together. When  
she became extremely upset and started  
sobbing, Coon told her to come back  
another day to be tested again. Coon  
told her the exam was inconclusive.  

"When I walked into the hallway  
after the test, he told me, ‘Honey,  
I know you didn't take the money. We  
can take care of this.'" A witness in  
a waiting room area says she heard  
Coon make the same remark to Reynolds.  

Another Weberg employee was tested  
by Coon the same day, prior to Rey-  
nolds. The woman said that Coon asked  
her to remove her thin sweater before  
beginning the exam. “I said I would  
take it off if he had a robe I could  
wear,” the second woman said, "but he  
said he didn't have one. Then he  
asked me if I was wearing anything  
underneath the sweater. I said no,  
and he seemed embarrassed. I was  
embarrassed too, and very nervous, and  
I thought that was a bad way to start  
the test."  

Reynolds' attorney, Richard Stuckey,  

complained to the Golden district  
attorney's office on January 15th,  
five days after the polygraph.  

On January 17th, two days after the  
district attorney's office was noti-  
fied, Coon wrote a report accusing  
Reynolds of deception during her  

exam. Reynolds was later fired.  

Reynolds also went to Lakewood po-  
lice officer Doug Peterson to make a  
criminal complaint. Peterson and the  
district attorney's office decided  
March 27th not to file a charge of  
sexual assault against Coon, which,  
at most, would have been a misdemeanor.  

Peterson said Coon presented a  
witness who claims he watched Coon  
and Reynolds over a closed circuit  
television set located in another room.  
According to Peterson and Assistant  
District Attorney Mike Tully, the pre-  
sence of a witness to rebut “one on  
one testimony" - Reynolds' word a-  
gainst Coon's - made the case too  
weak to prosecute.  

But Reynolds’ attorney said John V.  
Alman, the alleged witness, made a  
statement that he watched Coon and  
Reynolds during the exam only “30 to  
35 minutes." According to Coon's own  
report, the exam lasted from 2:12 pm  
until 5 pm.
