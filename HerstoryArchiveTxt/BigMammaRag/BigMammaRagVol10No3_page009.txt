Two Alabama women may go to
prison in January because of

southwest of Birmingham near
the Mississippi line, is 40%
Black. It has no Black ele-
cted officials except mayors
of tiny all-Black towns. Ms.
Wilder and Ms. Bozeman are
life-long residents of the
area and have long been ac-
tive against injustice.

"1968 was my waking-up
period," Ms. Wilder has said.
"We were trying to get Black
cashiers hired at Piggly-
Wiggly. We had a march, and
13 of us went to jail. I was
the oldest.

Ms. Bozeman describes what

criminal injustice system

their work to help Black cit-
izens register and vote in
rural Pickens County.

They are Julia Wilder, 69,
president of the Pickens
County Voters League and an
officer of the local Southern
Christian Leadership Confer-
ence, and Maggie Bozeman,

51, president of the local
NAACP.

Ms. Wilder and Ms. Bozeman,
who live in Aliceville, Ala.,
were arrested in November,
1978. The technical charge
against them is "vote fraud."
What they were actually doing
was helping elderly voters
understand the ballot and
vote.

They were convicted by an
all-white jury in 1979. Ms.
Wilder was sentenced to five
years, and Ms. Bozeman to
four years. Ms. Bozeman was
also fired from the teaching
job she had held 27 years.

The convictions were appe-
aled to the Alabama Court of
Criminal Appeals, which up-
held them, and to the Alabama
Supreme Court, which refused
to review. In November of
1981, the U.S. Supreme Court
refused to hear the cases.
Their lawyer, Solomon Seay of
Montgomery, moved for suspen-
sion of sentences, and a hea-
ring was set for December 1.

When the day for the hear-
ing came, the courtroom in
Carrollton, Ala., the Pickens
County seat was packed with
supporters of the women.
Circuit Judge Clatus Junkin
postponed the hearing until
January 11. However, local
observers doubt that he is
planning to suspend the sen-
tences.

Pickens County, which is

was happening in 1978. "We
had a big registration drive,
and Black candidates running
for office. The politicians
were especially afraid of the
young woman we ran for School
Board against a white banker.
As it turned out, she only
lost by 106 votes, too."

As part of the campaign,
Voters League members went to
the homes of house-bound eld-
erly citizens, took absentee
ballots, and if necessary
helped those who could not
read or write fill them out—

all perfectly legal, according

to Attorney Seay, if the vot-
ers' wishes were followed.

Ms. Wilder and Ms. Bozeman
were charged with "fraud" in
connection with 39 of those
ballots. The offenses were
alleged to have occurred in

the primary run-off. Officials

waited until the day before
the general election to make
the arrests. "They picked me
up at school—just as I was
coming in from the playground
with my kids," says Ms. Boze-
man. "There were five police
cars."

At the trials, the state
subpoenaed many of the eld-
erly voters. According to
Attorney Seay, all but one of
them testified on cross-exam-
ination that they knew exac-
tly what they were doing and
that the ballots were marked
as they wished.

"One woman testified that
she didn't know what the vo-
ting was all about," Seay re-
ported. "The State Court
of Appeals said the evidence
was "confusing" but the tes-
timony of that one woman was
sufficient for the jury to
convict."

Courtroom pressure on the

Voting-Rights Activity

elderly voters was intense.
One of them, Lou Sommerville,
95, recently described it.

"The lawyer said to me,
didn't Ms. Bozeman come to my
house and try to make me let
her fix up my ballot. It
wasn't true. So I told him
I'm the Lord's child, and
the Lord doesn't want a lie.
I said, I have to tell the
truth. No matter how many
times they ask me, I'll keep
telling the truth."

The charges against Ms.
Wilder and Ms. Bozeman are
not just an isolated incid-
ent. Just last year, a young
Black man in Pickens County,
Willie Davis, was charged
with disorderly conduct for
explaining the ballot to vo-
ters.

When Ms. Bozeman picked
up absentee ballots that year
she said the sheriff said to
her, "You're getting some
more of them. Maggie Boze-
man will get them to vote if
she has to vote them herself.
We're going to get you this
time."

At the time of the women's

December hearing, local dis-
trict attorney P.M. Johnston
told the news media in Birm-
ingham: "They could have
been arrested on other char-
ges since their conviction.
Their efforts at the polls
have continued. They aren't
satisfied with voting them-
selves. They have been bring-
ing people into the polling
places, watching them vote,
insisting that they be allow-
ed to assist people."

Immediately after December
1, local officials added in-
sult to injury. They sent Ms.
Wilder and Ms. Bozeman let-
ters telling them their own
names had been removed from
the voting rolls because the
conviction was upheld.

But the two women aren't

Maggie Bozeman and Julia Wilder

giving up. "No matter how
rough it gets, I'm going to
be here," Ms. Wilder said re-
cently. Ms. Bozeman, in ad-
dition to continuing voter re-
gistration and education work,
constantly appears before lo-
cal governing bodies—City
Council, County Commission, Bo-
ard of Education—to protest
various forms of discrimina-
tion.
Among those who came to

Pickens County to support

the women at the time of the
December 1 hearing were
Black elected officials from
10 surrounding counties, Al-
abama Democratic Conference
Chairman Joe Reed, NAACP so-
utheastern director Earl T.
Shinhoster, SCLC leaders Pre-
sident Joseph Lowery, Rev.
John Nettles, Rev. R.B. Cot-
ten; representatives of
the Federation of Southern
Co-ops, Alabama Hunger Coal-
ition, the Equal Rights Con-
gress, the Southern Organiz-
ing Committee and other
groups.

There is a legend that the
face of a Black man lynched

—Judy Hand/No More Cages

in Pickens County after the
Civil War can be seen in the
window of the courthouse in
Carrollton. After the Dec. 1
court session, Dr. Lowery
told those who had gathered:

"These two women were pol-
itically lynched. We came
here to be on their side. We
are going to launch the big-
gest voter registration drive
ever seen in Pickens County."
