Picket At Armagh, IWD 1982 ¢

(This Statement is reprinted
from Gaining Ground, an Anar-
cha-Feminist paper from Bel-
fast, Ireland.)

As many people gather out-
side Armagh prison on Interna-
tional Women's Day, to show
their solidarity with women
inside, and in a symbolic ges-
ture to emphasise the need
for continuing solidarity
within the women's movement

Ireland

generally, they will undoubt-
ably underline the fact that
over twenty women in Armagh
remain on the no work protest
Whilst these prisoners remain
on protest (in continuing re-
sistance to the British poli-
cy of criminalisation) they
lose remission, the number of
“visits they can receive is re-
duced, and their weekly par-
cels are also affected. We
should all be aware that a
yearly symbolic picket should

women outside to continue to
support the prisoners and to
campaign for humane condi-
tions. This work has to be
constant, if the struggle of
Armagh prisoners is not to
be seen as secondary to that
of their male comrades; and
if Armagh gaol is to receive
constant, rather than once-a-
year attention from the wo-
men's movement.

The prisoners in Armagh, in
a statement issued on Interna-
tional Women's Day, extended

greetings throughout the
world, "especially to those
who, like ourselves, are en-
gaged in the struggle for
freedom, in El Salvador, Pal-
estine, the Basque country
and the many others who have
pledged their support to us."
"With the war situation in
our country, political and so-
cial issues are an ever pre-
sent reality to day-to-day
life. Our knowledge and aware-

ness have grown as each cri-
sis falls upon us. And as wo-
men come to terms with hard-
ship after hardship, few have
been left unscathed by Bri-
tish oppression, and while we
continue to play our part in
the struggle, we should also
look to ourselves as women
and determine what we wish to
obtain for ourselves........"

"As seen in the past, Irish
women did not successfully
tackle women's issues in the
aftermath of the 1916 rising,
and we should learn from

those mistakes... women could

< cannot handle both issues toge-

ther; that of national libera-

tion and that of women's

one issue to cloud the other,
but instead we should combine

the two in our pursuit of
freedom....We must remain be-
side our male comrades, not
only in planning our country's
future, but also in establishing
equal rights for ourselves.
Today, we should avail of
every opportunity present to
come together to discuss and
explore what we want to see
in the Ireland of tomorrow."

"We cannot allow the same
situation to evolve as in the
past, when women played a com-
paratively strong role in the
Rising and civil war, but af-
terwards disappeared into
oblivion, gaining little or
nothing for women's rights."

"We must not halt at the
halfway house, but follow it
through until we have asserted
all our aims."

are seeing people who you are
not sure are there and hearing
them talk to you on the sub-
ways, no one understands you.
Not even the therapist who
had been supportive and un-
derstanding for so many years.
She said I was hallucinating
just to try to get her to
mother me, that I was compet-
ing with her baby by my col-
ossal dysfunctioning. That's
all well and theoretically
nice, but when you are getting
lost in the streets, it
doesn't help you. At this
point I began to realize that
there is violence involved in
the so-called therapeutic re-
lation. Like with Marxism, an
intellectual trend I had held
much interest in. There is
violence involved in the pur-
est execution of the theory,
and not everyone can deal
with violence. If workers
take over the factories as
Marxism suggests, half of
them would get shot. Workers
know this, so they don't do
it. Therapy patients are more
vulnerable. They get hooked
on completely trusting basic-
ally irresponsible individuals
who eventually--no matter
what the brand of therapy--
misuse it. They do this in
two ways: by accusing you of
an unwarranted dependency,
which they have encouraged

in you; or by asking you
where you have gotten the un-
realistic illusions they

have implanted in you.

When I left my therapist in
New York, I turned to friends,
and this put great stress on
my relationships. I knew this,
and I felt like I was losing
people from my unnatural need
to cling to them to batten
down my own hysteria and to
constantly go over decisions
with them. My father's voice
tempted me on the phone.

"Come home and see Dr.**;
he'll come right to the house
to see you." You know it's
wrong to let fathers take care
of you, but you are scared--
of going out, of breaking down
to total strangers. You get
there, and the doctor reas-
sures you--that's what fathers
are for. "It's all right to
want to be cared for. Maybe
you need it."

Before I tried to enter a
hospital in New York on my own
for the first time in the mid-
dle of all this, I had grabbed
two of my topical notebooks
(I kept running notebooks on
different themes at the time).
Audience and Femininity. I was
extremely conscious of my use
of flirtation as a connection
to other people during this
whole time. The immediate con-
tact kept my mind from spin-
ning. Instead of writing about
sex roles for the far away
audience of the book, I was
compulsively acting them out
for whomever would look. I
was quite conscious of the sex-

ual connection to the psychia-
trist in the hospital serving
the same function for me. Here
was a man who would be my aud-
ience, and listen to me. He
was offering to take me in,
like the hero in Victorian
novels. He was taking respon-
sibility for me. Here was a
man who accepted my flighti-
ness, confusion, my femininity
--and even seemed amused at it
in me. I made a lump transfer
of trust to him, although I
was uncomfortable having done
that and fought it constantly.

In I'm Dancing As Fast As I
Can, Barbara Gordon has writ-
ten how women are more likely
to fall victim to the psychiat-
ric professional ritual. In
my case becoming a classic fe-
male and a mental patient co-
incided pretty exactly. I be-
came a mental patient so to
speak, to get my female gender
identity back, since publishing
an intellectual book had pret-
ty much shaken it for me. I
got into an intense relation-
ship with a male psychiatrist
because I didn't like what my
feminist consciousness told
me. With his help I tried to
batten it back down. Relating
to this male consistently
paying attention to me gave me
hope that I too could be a
success as a female.

Given the severity of sexism
among men, the male psychia-
trist becomes a utopian alter-

native, especially attractive
to the woman who is out of
the sex role and thus exper-
iencing identity confusion.
He is kind, and assures her
trying to say with his pat-
ience and presence that all
men are not out to screw her.
This was in my case in stark
opposition to my own raw ex-
perience in unmediated impure
life, and with the rest of the
men on the unit who began to
hassle me as soon as I was
checked in on the first night.
The first night, comments
were made about my appear-
ance, which I was hostile to,
and I was accused of being a
lesbian. Juxtaposed to that
was the kind fatherly pro-
tective type, and I felt re-
lieved to be accepted and
understood by him. I stayed,
responding to his pleas that
I needed him, and exclaimed
that I would rather die than
go to Massachusetts to re-
turn to my work, or to a un-
iversity that was offering

me a low-paying fellowship to
continue being a female in-
tellectual. He stepped into
my patriarchally induced
ambivalence about accepting
my own individual overturning
of the sex role. I walked in-
to the trap that he was an
unknown enactor of. I re-
jected my own work, choosing
instead a passive dependence
on him.
