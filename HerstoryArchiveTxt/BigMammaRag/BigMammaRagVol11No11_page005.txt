Psychiatric Inmate Fights Electroshock  

Ontario Coalition To Stop  
Electroshock

Collective  

An historic legal case in-  
volving the individual's  
right to refuse electroshock  
("ECT" or "electroconvulsive  
therapy") is now unfolding  
in Ontario. Last month, a  
psychiatric inmate (an in-  
voluntary woman patient) in  
Hamilton Psychiatric Hospi-  
tal refused to consent to  
electroshock--her husband  
also refused to consent on  
her behalf. Despite the wom-  
an's and husband's refusals,  
her psychiatrist appealed  
to the review board which  
then ordered that electro-  
shock be administered to  
her. However, because of  
legal pressure from her law-  
yer, the hospital and Minis-  
try of Health agreed not to  
administer electroshock to  
this woman--at least tempor-  
arily. (To protect her right  
to privacy and confidential-  
ity, we cannot disclose the  
woman's name at this time.)  

The woman's lawyer, Carla  
McKague, will soon be argu-  
ing her case in the Supreme  
Court of Ontario on the gr-  
ound that electroshock  
falls within the definition  
of psychosurgery ("lobotomy")  
in Ontario's Mental Health  
Act. The Act outlaws psycho-  
surgery for any involuntary  
patient. Under Section 35(1)  
of the Act, psychosurgery is  
defined in part as: "...Any  
procedure that, by direct or  
indirect access to the brain,  
removes, destroys or inter-  
rupts the continuity of his-  
tologically normal brain ti-  
ssue..."  

Electroshock, it will be  
argued, destroys normal  
brain tissue or causes brain  
damage. If the judge dec-  
ides that ECT meets the Act's  
definition of psychosurgery,  
then ECT may not be admini-  
stered to any involuntary  
patient in Ontario. This ru-  
ling could protect thousands  
of people who otherwise  
would be subjected to this  
brain-damaging, psychiatric  
procedure. The ruling would  
also be a great victory for  
psychiatric inmates' rights  
in Canada. To the best of  
our knowledge, this is the  
first time that a psychiat-  
ric inmate has challenged  
ECT or any other forced ps-  
ychiatric treatment in court  
in Canada.  

The legal costs in fight-  
ing this crucial case will  
impose a financial burden  

upon the woman and her hus-  
band. We therefore are ask-  
ing you to contribute what-  
ever you can to help meet  
these costs. A cheque or  
money order should be made  
payable to: Brodey, Waclaw-  
ski & Smolkin together with  
a note stating your donation  
is for the shock case. The  
address is: Brodey, Waclaw-  
ski, & Smolkin, 78 Charles  
Street W., Toronto, Ontario  
M5S 1K8. We thank you and  
deeply appreciate whatever  
financial support you can  
offer. STOP SHOCK NOW!

Nicaraguans Build Health Care  

(Reprinted from Outwrite)  

Susanna, midwife, has been  
a volunteer worker in Nic-  
aragua for the past two  
years. She was in England  
for a few weeks before re-  
turning to a country now un-  
der increasing threat of  
counter-revolutionary war.  
She talked to Outwrite a-  
bout health in Nicaragua  
and her work with the local  
midwives in the north of the  
country.  

Under Somoza's dictator-  
ship, until July 1979, the  
Nicaraguan people suffered  
the most appalling health  
conditions. Amongst a popu-  
lation of two and a half  
million, only 28% had access  
to the (largely private)  
medical facilities. In rural  

areas, 95% of the population  

had no access to potable  
(drinking) water. Infant  
mortality was estimated  
at 140 per thousand, though  
few records were kept. Tet-  
anus and diarrheas were  
amongst the major causes  
of infant mortality. Malar-  
ia, tuberculosis and para-  
sitism were endemic through-  
out most of the country.  

"Health is Power" became  
a central message of the  
Sandinista revolution, and  
in three years the people  
have practically eliminated  
or vastly reduced most of  
these diseases, through a  
massive vaccination and pub-  
lic health campaign. This  
has been achieved through  
the unusual commitment of  
the Sandinista government to  
community control of health  
care.  

Although it took the gov-  

ernment nearly a year's del-  
iberation, they decided to  
not only build more hospi-  
tals and train medical staff  
to send into the community  
(as did the Cubans, for ex-  
ample) but to support the  
informal health sector es-  
tablishing Primary Health  
Care within the community,  
based on local volunteers  
and extending the work of  
the traditional midwives  
(parteras populares). To-  
day in every community (of  
1000-2000 people), there is  
a health centre where a  
trained nurse and group of  
brigadistas (volunteers)  
work together with the mid-  
wife. Medical supplies are  
provided, a doctor and some-  
times a dentist will visit  
weekly. Every six months  
open meetings are held at  
the centre.  

The local midwife is a wo-  
man who emerges within the  
community as a natural lead-  
er, a strong woman with a  
knowledge of traditional  
health care. Knowing when a  
woman in the area is due to  
give birth, she will usual-  
ly go and live with the wo-  
man (75% of women in Nic-  
aragua do not get married,  
and 60% of births take place  
in the home). There she will  
look after the woman and  
any other children, keep her  
house clean, deliver the  
child, and maybe stay with  
the woman for up to twenty  
days after the birth. For  
this--up to one month's  
work--she might receive  
100 cordobas (5 or 6 pounds).  

In her two years, Susanna  
travelled in the north of  
the country, and helped to  
train over 350 new midwives.  
She held weekly training  
courses for the parteras  
populares. Not to retrain  
them, "their skills were  
more suitable than my four  
years university training,"  
but to extend these skills  
with a much needed know-  
ledge of female physiology,  
and technical details (such  
as how to cope with breech  
births, post partum hae-  
morrhage, etc.).  

The second aim was to  
introduce certain basic  
methods of hygiene to coun-  
teract tetanus, diarrhoea  
and so on. And it is these  
methods, together with  
the vaccination campaign,  
largely effected by the  
85,000 brigadistas across  
the country, that have been  
responsible for the extra-  
ordinary success of the  
health campaign.  

Susanna worked without  
funds to start with, though
