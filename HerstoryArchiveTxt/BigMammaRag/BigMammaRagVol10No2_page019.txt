Haitians

Salvador, how long it will

be before the Salvadoran
refugees will find themselves
in the same situation...not
qualifying for political
asylum in the US, threatened
with, and actively subject

to deportation.

The issue of political
asylum for the Haitian re-
fugees has linked together
their struggle with that of
Salvadoran refugees and
Mexican undocumented workers.
Organizations as varied as the
Anti-Defamation League, the
YWCA, the Committee in Sol-
idarity with the people of
El Salvador, Black Viet Nam
Veterans for Social Justice,
Farmworkers Rights Organ-
ization and the National
Immigration and Refugee
Network have organized demon-
strations and/or issued
statements of solidarity in
demanding political asylum
for the Haitians, an end to
extensive US support for
the corrupt Duvalier regime
and a halt to the ban in
international waters of
Haitian refugees by US
immigration officials.

There have been a steady
stream of actions over the
last 6 weeks.

December 12 - 6,000-7,000
people demonstrated in
Washington, D.C. and over
5,000 in Puerto Rico in
support of Haitian refugees.

December 25 - Hunger strikes
by the Haitians at Krome

from page Il

Avenue Detention Center (18
miles west of Miami at the
edge of the Everglades)
begin.

December 24 - Hunger strike
begins at the Flushing Navy
Yard Detention Center in
Brooklyn, where women have
been held since July.

December 26 - In San Juan,
more than 200 Haitian ref-
ugees prevented immigration
officials from putting up
extra fences around the Fort
Allen compound. U.S. immigra-
tion officials brought in
about 100 Border Patrol
guards from Texas to beef up
security at the camp. Haitian
leaders have criticized
immigration officials as well
as the governor of Puerto
Rico for the lack of adequate
facilities to house the
refugees. Jean-Claude Bajeux,
coordinator for the Inter-
Regional Council for Haitian
Refugees, said the situation
remains "a tinderbox that can
go off at any moment."
December 27 - 700 demonstra-
tors gather outside barbed
wire fences at Krome Avenue
in support of the hunger
strikes. When more than 200
of the demonstrators stormed
the fences they were tear
gassed and clubbed by riot
equipped police. Eight people

were arrested on charges of
unlawful assembly and a ninth
person was charged with arson
and resisting arrest. An

estimated 20 refugees escaped.
December 29 - the January 2
Coalition held a news confer-
ence at the United Nations
which featured civil rights
activist Dick Gregory and
Attorney Ramsey Clark. During
the course of the news conf-
erence, three Haitians chain-
ed themselves to the UN
entrance gate in protest of
Reagan Administration polic-
ies. They were arrested and
have a court date January 29.
December 31 - tens of
thousands of Puerto Ricans
lit candles in their windows
in support of the demand of
freedom for the Haitian
refugees. Ironically this
action coincided with Reagan's
call on Americans to light
candles to protest martial
law in Poland. More than
800 Haitians are being held
at a concentration camp in
Puerto Rico--so called Fort
Allen.

Protesters in Brooklyn Jan. 2 denounce mistreatment of Haitian refugees.

-Chris Tellez/Guardian

January 2 - 1800 people in
Chicago gathered in mass
protest against US policies
and treatment of the Haitians.

January 3 - A militant march
and demonstration in Brooklyn,
New York brought together
about 3000 people. The march
was so massive that demon-
strators seized the streets,
even though police tried to
keep the march on the side-
walk.

We, as feminists, must
continue the public outcry
in support for political
asylum, freedom for the
refugees and an end to
Reagan's reactionary policies
and the repressive government
in Haiti...until these
demands are met.
