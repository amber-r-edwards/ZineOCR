Lesbians Barred

During their recent national tour,  
the Berkley Women's Music Collective  
tried to sandwich in a visit to Tor-  
onto, Ontario. When they arrived at  

the border, Canadian Customs concluded  
they were lesbians after a thorough  
search of their truck. After several  

frustrating hours, they were issued  
a permit on the condition that they  
not perform musically and would post  
a $150 bond to ensure their return.  
Various Canadian groups are fighting  
for changes in the immigration system  
which prohibits lesbians and homo-  
sexuals from entering Canada. Canadian  
Customs are not alone in the effort  
to keep out “perverts.” On numerous  
occasions, lesbians from Toronto have  
been stopped from entry into the  
United States on the grounds of les-  
bianism.

Exploitation Kills

Francis Moore Lappe, author of  
Diet For A Small Planet has devel-  
oped a new theory after four years  
of research: That hungry nations  
could feed themselves, but are pre-  
vented from doing so because much  
of their protein resources are  
exported to feed the cattle of de-  
veloped nations.

Lappe now rejects her original  
thesis that America's excess grain  
production is the key to ending  
world hunger.

Battered Wives Hit Back

The first comprehensive challenge  
to the treatment of battered wives  
by US courts and police was made  
in December by 12 women who filed  
suit in Manhattan Supreme Court.

The women, who said that they  
had been repeatedly beaten by their  
husbands, charged that they were  
denied help by police who refused  
to arrest their husbands.

Family Court is also named in  
the suit for denying the women  
access to judges who might have  
issued orders of protection.

Rome Feminists March

An estimated 10,000 women con-  
ducted an anti-rape torchlight  
parade through the streets of  
Rome recently. Men were barred  
from the march. Organizers said  
the number of rapes in Rome is  
increasing, making the streets  
unsafe after dark.

Also in Rome, feminists have  
taken over an empty government  
building, aiming to turn it into  
a women's community center. They  
are members of the feminist arm of  
the Italian Radical Party, and as  
of December, had occupied the  
building for about a month with  
little government harassment.

Dangerous Affair

The Georgia Supreme Court ruled  
January 6th that a man does not have  
the right to kill his wife and her  
lover when he catches them having  
sexual relations.

The court ruled in the case of an  
ordained minister who was convicted  
of the October 1975 slaying of his  
wife and her lover.

The court further said that the  
Georgia Court of Appeals has ruled  
“that killing the lover to prevent  
adultery could be justified homo-  
cide to protect the marriage, though  
killing the spouse could not be just-  
ified because it would terminate the  
marriage.”

Marital Rape Law

The Australian state of South  
Australia passed a law prohibiting  
rape within marriage, the first such  
legislation in the world. The bill  
further prohibits questioning of the  
victim about her previous sex exper-  
iences or morality, and states the  
victim need not appear at the hear-  
ing unless the judge decides there  
are special circumstances.

Domestic Workers Win

A district court in North Carolina  
has ordered a private employer to  
pay back wages, damages, and legal  
costs for failure to pay the federal  
minimum wage to a domestic worker.  
It was the first suit filed under  
the Fair Labor Standards Act, where  
a $2.20 per hour minimum wage applies  
to domestic workers who receive at  
least $50 per calendar quarter from  
one employer, or who work more than  
eight hours per week for one or more  
employers.

Childcare Tax Break

The new Tax Reform Act makes changes  
in the tax break for child care, open-  
ing it to many more 1976 taxpayers.

It replaces a deduction for child  
care expenses with a dollar for dol-  
lar childcare credit.

For married couples, until this  
reform, both parents had to be employed  
full time. Now they can get the credit  
if one spouse works part-time, or  
is a full-time student. A divorced  
or separated parent with custody of  
a child also can get the credit, even  
if the child cannot be claimed as a  
dependent.

Abortion Victory

The New Jersey Supreme Court  
ruled in November that private non-  
sectarian hospitals cannot prohibit  
the use of their facilities for  
elective abortions.

The case stemmed from the refusal  
of several hospitals to provide  
abortion services based on a “con-  
science clause" in the state law.  
Twenty-eight states have adopted  
conscience clauses, which say that  
doctors and nurses can refuse to per-  
form abortions on "moral" grounds.

Good For Profit

Lessening criminal penalties for  
prostitution, gambling and porn-  
ography may be putting more money in  
the pockets of organized crime, a  
federally-funded study reported in  
December.

The study, prepared by the National  
Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice  
Standards and Goals, said that partial  
legalization of gambling and porn-  
ography has increased the incidence  
and profits of both.

"As to prostitution, its current  
connection with organized crime ap-  
pears to be increasing through own-  
ership of bars and massage parlors,"  
it said.

In typical government study  
fashion, the report told states to  
use caution in cutting criminal pen-  
alties for “victimless" crimes. What  

the study didn't include, apparently,  

is an analysis of why decriminaliza-  
tion alone is not enough to wipe out  
the exploitation of women.

Lesbian Sourcebook

Women of the National Gay Task  
Force are working on a lesbian  
resource book to be published by  
Prentice Hall in late 1977 or  
early 1978.

Articles will cover therapy and  
counseling, monogamy and other  
lifestyles, legal problems and  
remedies, lesbian mothers, activism,  
culture, theory, race, class and  
age. Brief personal testimonies  
(3-5 typed, double-spaced pages)  
and black and white photos are  
sought. Contact Ginny Vida, NGTF,  
80 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10011.

Unemployment Ruling

Colorado women who quit their  
jobs because of "family circum-  
stances" may not be denied unemploy-  
ment compensation benefits, the  
Colorado Supreme Court ruled Nov. 30.

The case arose when Virginia B.  
Kistler quit her Colorado job to  
move to California with her husband.  
She was unable to find a job there,  
but was denied unemployment benefits  
through Colorado. The court said  
such a practice violates the con-  
stitutional guarantee of equal pro-  
tection under the law.

Joke’s On Him

A New York weather forecaster  
recently opened his nightly report  
with a crack about rape. The news  
report right before his spot told  
of an eight-year-old girl who had  
been attacked by a would-be rapist.

“With rape so predominant in the  
news lately,” he said, “Confucius  
once said: ‘If rape is inevitable,  
relax and enjoy it.’"

Calls and protests from women who  
do not particularly “enjoy” the idea  
of rape poured into the television  
station. He was suspended and ABC  
announced that he will not get his  
job back.

Ultimate Deodorant

The Monsanto Company, makers of  
cosmetics, food dyes and insecti-  
cides, is now claiming to have devel-  
oped the ultimate deodorant.

Veilex, as the product is called,  
reportedly manipulates the human  
nose so that it perceives only pleas-  
ant smells and shuts out the bad ones.  
It is thought Veilex interferes with  
the brain's ability to identify one  
smell from another, but no one knows  
what will happen to our senses of  
smell and taste if they are constant-  
ly exposed to a chemical which inter-  
feres with the brain's activity.

Veilex will soon be appearing on  
the marketplace in the form of house-  
hold deodorizers.

Live Longer, Pay More

Women workers at the Los Angeles  
Department of Water and Power no  
longer have to pay for living longer.  
Up until a recent court ruling,  
they were required to pay into  
their pension plan 15% more than  
male workers in their department.

The city reasoned that since women  
live longer, they should pay more  
into the fund.

Protest In Spain

One of the most widely publicized  
issues in Spain has been the fight  
to overturn the country's ban on  
divorce, a lever which gives men  
the power to victimize women on  
charges of adultery.

In Barcelona, Maria Angeles Munoz,  
28, is charged with adultery by her  
husband who had left her. She  
hasn't been tried yet, but a judge  
threatened her with jail unless she  
gave up custody of her daughter to  
her husband's parents.

The case triggered strong fem-  
inist protest, including a march by  
5,000 in Barcelona last November.

Oil Settlement

Nearly a billion dollars in back  
pay has been awarded to the 640  
minority and women employees of  
the Gulf Oil Company's Port Arthur,  
Texas refinery.

The award came out of a major  
settlement of race and sex discrim-  
ination issues last fall between  
the company and the US Department  
of Labor. Gulf has agreed to abide  
by affirmative action guidelines.
