Donna Levy, a lesbian and second
mother to her deceased lover's daugh-
ter, won custody of the child after
an eight-month legal battle in Den-
ver Juvenile Court.

Also fighting for custody were
Lois and Gil Lucero, sister and
brother-in-law of the child's natural
mother—Jeanette Hatzopoulos, who
committed suicide last year.

According to Gerald Gerash, an at-
torney and gay activist who represen-
ted Donna in court, the decision
marked the first time a court has
granted custody to the lover of a
person in a lesbian or gay relation-
ship.

The issues of race, single parent-
hood, and lesbianism were pervasive
underlying themes in the case. How-
ever, the decision handed down by
Juvenile Court Judge Orrelle Weeks
was formally made on the standard
"best interests of the child" crit-
erion.

The Luceros had represented them-
selves as a “loving” family who
could give 7-year-old Betty (not the
child's real name) the "normal" mo-
ther and father figure that Donna
could not.

Donna—who, with Jeanette, had
raised Betty from birth—was clearly
the child's psychological mother and
the only party in the case who could
openly and honestly help Betty
through the very important grieving
process over her mother's death.

The court ruled that Donna be gran-
ted permanent custody because "she
will offer more stability to the mi-
nor child as she has a stronger com-
mitment that the child comes first
and her personal desires come second!"

The ruling also said that the Lu-

Custody Battle

ceros “do not have this intensity of
commitment" and cannot offer the sta-
bility that Betty needs. However, as
Betty had been living with the Lucer-
os since last September, they were
judged to be "significant adults" in
her life and were granted visiting
rights. The court also called for
psychotherapy for Betty, who has bar-
ely begun the first stage of accept-
ance of her mother's death.

Donna and Jeanette met and became
lovers 15 years ago in their home-
town of Denver, when Donna was 19 and
Jeanette, 23. Both women had wanted
to have children, but Donna was un-
able to have any. Eventually, Jean-
ette slept with Betty's father, a
student from Thailand who was passing
through town, in hopes of getting
pregnant. Both Donna and Jeanette
decided to raise the child together.
A few years after Betty's birth, they
moved back to Denver from Los Angeles
where they had lived for a time, so
that Betty could get to know Jean-
ette's and Donna's families.

As it turned out, Betty spent more
time with Donna's family. In 1974,
Donna and Jeanette split up, with
Betty remaining with Jeanette. Nev-
ertheless, Donna maintained a strong
relationship with Betty, taking her
on her days off and seeing her often
during the week. Donna, who is a
bus driver with RTD, would often let
Betty ride the bus with her after
school hours.

Jeanette's suicide last July 5 left
Donna with both an emotional shock
and the necessity of arranging child
care during her working hours. She
arranged for Betty's grandmother and
the Luceros to care for Betty on a
temporary basis during work days, in

hopes that Betty would do well in
the company of her cousin Leslie and
other children, and in hopes that
Betty's presence would be a comfort
to Jeanette's family.

The arrangement worked for only a
few weeks. One day, when Donna went

to the Luceros to pick up Betty, she

was told by Gil Lucero that she and
Betty were "too close" and that Bet-
ty needed a father figure. The Lu-
ceros subsequently filed suit for
custody.

Meanwhile, the Luceros were telling
Betty to forget about her mother and
Donna and to consider her new family
as her parents.

Donna later filed a petition to
intervene in the case and she was
granted standing by the court.

In a statement made under oath,

Mrs. Lucero testified that Betty

loved her husband Gil because she's
never had a father "and it's some-
thing special to her because now she
says she has somebody to call 'Dad'

and not have to be embarrassed at
school when everybody else says they
have a Dad and she doesn't." Mrs.
Lucero also said that Betty loves the
feeling of having a Dad “and he being
the breadwinner."

In addition to such obvious sexism
and heterosexism, racism was also un-
covered in the relationship of the
extended Lucero family to Betty.

When Betty was living with Jeanette,
who was Chicana, and Donna, who is
Black, she never raised issues of
race in a negative manner.

Later, after court proceedings be-
gan and Donna was allowed to resume
visits with Betty, Betty asked what
race Donna's lawyer was.

Betty also told Donna that Lois
Lucero's sister had yelled at her for
expressing a desire to live with Don-
na: “Why do you want to live with
that nigger? You'll become a nigger
yourself."

As Donna and her lawyer began to
prepare the case, they feared that
the longer the separation between
Donna and Betty, the more successful
the Luceros would be in convincing
Betty that Donna no longer loved her
because Donna was not attempting to
see her. Eventually the Luceros con-
sented to brief weekly visits in the
Lucero home.

A second major fear was the obvious
prejudice of the original guardian
ad litem—a court-appointed person
who is supposed to represent the
child.

When the guardian ad litem refused
attorney Gerald Gerash's request for
psychological testing of Betty, Don-
na, and the Luceros, Donna and her
lawyer became increasingly suspicious
that the issue of race and the issue
of a lesbian raising a little girl
were underlying the motives of the
guardian. He hadn't even interviewed
Betty—the person he was supposed to
represent—before forming an opinion
in favor of the Luceros. His opinion
was based on the report of the Dep-
artment of Social Services social
worker who had screened the Lucero
