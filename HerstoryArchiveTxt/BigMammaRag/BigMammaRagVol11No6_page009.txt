Big Mountain Elders Strongly

Susanna Smith

On April about 100
Diné (Navajo) and Hopi people
and white supporters gathered
at Big Mountain, in northern

Navajo/Hopi

Arizona, to show their stead-
fast resistance to the forced
relocation by the U.S. govern-
ment of Diné and Hopi people
from their land. Big Mountain
people have a long history of
resistance from the Long Walk
in 1864 to resisting forced
relocation now. (The Long
Walk is when Col. Kit Carson
forced nearly all 8,000 Diné
living at Big Mountain to
walk to Ft. Sumner in eastern
New Mexico. 100's of Diné
died, but many escaped the
federal troops and were still
living at Big Mt. when the
imprisoned Diné returned 4
years later.)

In 1882, then President
Arthur unilaterally establish-
ed a reservation for the Hopi
people within the boundaries
of the Diné reservation, to-
tally ignoring the fact that
this land had been home to
both Hopi and Diné. Interfer-
ing again, the U.S., in the
Healing-Jones decision of
1962, in a suit brought by
the Hopi Tribal Council a-
gainst the Navajo Tribal Coun-
cil, declared that the Diné
and Hopi had equal rights to
the disputed land. (Tribal
Councils are U.S. established
governing councils, set up so
that someone could sign
leases for mining on Indian
lands. They are not consider-
ed legitimate by traditional
Indians.) This decision esta-
blished the so-called "Joint
Use Area" (JUA) within which
is Big Mountain. In 1974, Con-
gress passed Public Law (PL)
93-531, the so-called "Navajo-
Hopi Land Settlement Act,”
mandating the relocation of
members of one nation living
on land partitioned to the
other. This involves some
8-10,000 Diné and 100 Hopi.
Meanwhile, in 1966, both tri-
bal councils had signed leases
with Peabody Coal Co. to strip
mine Black Mesa (a sacred area
within the JUA) for coal. The
forced relocation of people
from Big Mountain and the rest
of the JUA will pave the way
for more energy corporations
to mine estimated millions of

Page 10 - Big Mama Rag, June, 1983

dollars worth of coal, oil
and uranium deposits there.
Presently, besides the mining

at Black Mesa, there was/is
a boom in uranium mining and
milling in that area of the
country, known as the Four
Corners, causing numerous
health atrocities for those
working and living in the
area.

The gathering at Big Moun-
tain served three purposes.
One purpose was for all con-
cerned people, Diné, Hopi
and white supporters, to give
support and strength to the
struggle - to show the U.S.

government and corporations
that people will not be moved
off their land. Another pur-
pose was for the elders at
Big Mountain to share the his-
tory of the struggle there
and decide what actions to
take next. A third purpose
was for the white people pre-
sent to talk with each other
about strategies for support -
education in our own communi-
ties, how to materially sup-
port the resistance at Big

Mountain and in the JUA in
general and to get direction
from the elders about how to
go about this.

A recurrent theme through-
out the weekend was an empha-
sis on respect - respect for
each other as human beings,
respect for the land, for all
living things. Traditionally,
the Diné women are responsible
for the family land - the
earth, which is sacred to the
Diné and all Native American
peoples. Today, the elder wo-
men are the leaders in the re-
sistance of the people of Big
Mountain. Because of govern-

mental interference with a
traditional way of life, the
men often leave the land to

go into town for work and many
children attend boarding sch-
ools where they are taught

the white American, Christian
way of life. They often leave
the reservation for jobs, also.
This trend is reversing some-
what, as Indian people realize
what the costs of "assimila-
tion" and "relocation" are -
alcoholism, disintegration of

Resisting

family life, a high rate of
suicide - in other words -
genocide. And unlike white
culture, where older women,
and older men, are denigrated,
pushed aside as useless, old-
er people in Native American
cultures are respected and
looked to for decision making
because of their experience
and wisdom.

Katherine Smith, a 64-year-
old elder of Big Mountain,
was arrested in September,
1979 for firing a rifle to
stop members of a government
crew from building a barbed
wire fence dividing the land
and the people. In September,
1980, four women, sisters
Marlene Bennally, Louise Ben-
nally, Sally Tsosie and their
mother Alice Bennally, were
arrested when attempting to
prevent government crews from
fencing their homeland. On
April 5th of this year, Mae
Wilson Tso was arrested when
attempting to stop BIA (Bur-
eau of Indian Affairs) agents
from impounding her livestock.

Impoundment has a long his-
tory for the Diné and Hopi
people. In the early part of
the century, the U.S. govern-
ment attempted to apply
"scientific" range management
principles to the eroding
lands on the reservation. The
theory of range management -
that erosion could be stopped
by reduction of the herds of
sheep - in practice began
years of slow starvation for
the Diné and Hopi. Another
motivation for the livestock
reduction was/is a further
attempt to colonize the Hopi
(who have never signed a
treaty with the U.S.) and Diné
people. It was hoped that the
indigenous people would "pro-
gress" from their traditional
farming (Hopi) and sheep gra-
zing (Diné) to a money based
economy - working jobs in con-
struction, mining, etc. The
Diné woman has traditionally
been responsible for the care
of the sheep which provides
food, clothing and spiritual
meaning within her culture.
In the government plan, men
would be the laborers for
money and women would be split
off from their highly valued
position in the community.
From the first "scientific
management" to the present
laws enforcing stock reduc-
tions, the people of Big Moun-
tain and the JUA have prac-

Forced Relocation From Their Homeland

ticed continued resistance by
not participating in "elec-
tions" and by refusing to
apply for grazing permits,
which limit the number of an-
imals a person or family may
have. There is currently a
huge backlog of court cases
concerning impoundments and
grazing permit appeals.

Diné people rely on their
livestock as their liveli-
hood - impounding animals for
lack of a permit is starving
them into relocating. Mae
Wilson Tso relates her exper-
ience about being arrested
when attempting to stop the
impoundment of her horses:

I'd like to mention that
what had happened to me was
on April the 5th...it was
Washington and their stock
control programs that they
put towards the people out
here. I had experienced one
of those actions. It was when
the rangers took our horses
and we had a chase and we
finally caught up with them.
We tried to talk to them in a
good way with good feelings
so they would release our
stock, and we did all this
with respect, but we reali-
zed that the orders from
Washington are carried out
without any interruptions and
nobody talking back to these
laws. As a result, those In-
dian police had handcuffed
me. So, to these Indians who
were enforcing the laws of
Washington, I feel they are
those Indians who do not
think of their mothers or
fathers. They do not think
of their grandmothers and
grandfathers. They do not won-
der if they are in good
health. They do not respect
their own mothers. The rest
of us Indian people - if we
respect our mother and father
and our grandmothers and
grandfathers, we will stay on
our land. We will work and
try to continue on; to sur-
vive daily - working with
what we were given to provide
for us. We will remain with
our people. Since the Execu-
tive Order of 1882, and on
down through the years of how
that land was talked about
outside our areas, and also
through the years up to when
Public Law 93-531 was passed -
we remember the old people
that some of us had seen who
had talked to us about the
Long Walk that their mothers

and fathers had experienced
and how they were able to re-
cover from those wars... today
that is why respecting those
teachings, that is why today
our nation is still alive. We
have not given up the life
the creators had given us.
Since the day that we were
born to this earth,
through our childhood and
through our adulthood - all
the teachings that we recet-

ved, we were never taught that

we human beings created this
earth. We were not told that
we created the livestock. But
these things are for us
to live off, and the living

things are for us to walk with

on this earth, and we will
respect them, as we will nes-
pect one another as humans.
We will cherish these laws.
This is our life, and this is
our mind. Washington tells me
today that I have violated
their great laws and I had

disrespect for their society -

that I was a threat to their
world. But I see that they
are guilty of many things.
The many things they were
guilty of that day - they
were spying on our houses
that day. They were stealing
our livestock. Those things
they are guilty of. They do
not have the courage to pre-
sent themselves - to come in-
to our hogan and present
themselves as human beings.

Their system is harming a lot

of people. They have inflicted

pain on me, inducing a
heart attack, which caused
me to wake up the next morn-
ing in the hospital. They
had set my trial for the 27th
of this month (April, but it
has been postponed), and they
keep reminding me that I am
an outstanding criminal and
that I have violated so many
sections of their law. But I
have my defense, as many of
you already know, and us Diné
people know. That we respect
our birthright, and that we
live there, where we were
born. And also we continue
on, to struggle to survive,
with all that has been men-
tioned in the papers here.
Those that fly, and those
that walk on four legs, and
the water life, and the land,
that provides us cornfields,
that provides us food. This
law, the government's law,
their intention is that no-
body will ever interfere or

stall their actions. We had
hoped for them to take a slow
course, but they are not tak-
ing a slow course. It is an
immediate terrorism that has
to be completed - to be com-
pleted within so many years.
Many of us Diné people here
know only how to survive on
sheep and the farm and the
little things we do around
our hogan - the weavings.
Many of us just know this
way, we do not know any other
life. So we want to continue
in that way, and we want your
support. Your support will
strengthen me to fight along
with my people. So the way I
want things resolved for my-
self, and for my nation, is
to be resolved so we can be
free - free of pain, and that
our mother the earth is free
from destruction. It is all
true about how we seek to-

wands our life and the things
we are saying...

I feel that I have not re-
covered from all this yet as
far as my health and my men-
tal condition. I also realize
that the struggle must con-
tinue, and that we find ways
to go about so that the opp-
ressor's actions will cease.
Also I get strength from
knowing that what happened
to me on that day when I was
arrested and got beaten I
feel that those witnesses
there - the witnesses were
the great spirits that existed
that day - the wind, the
sun, the land itself. They
had witnessed what had hap-
pened. I hope that their
judgment will be the truth,
that their judgment will be
powerful...
