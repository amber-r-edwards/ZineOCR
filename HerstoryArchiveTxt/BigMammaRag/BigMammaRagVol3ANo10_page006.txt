system which uses her images

BMR comment

The following article, in two parts, reports Margo St. James’ remarks  
during a recent visit to the Denver area. The initial section is the  
reporter’s impression of the speech that Ms. St. James delivered at the  
University of Colorado on October 7th, and the second section is an  
exclusive interview which Margo granted at a later date.  

While the editors agree with O’Bie that “Margo St. James is a gusty  
woman,” we find ourselves in disagreement with a great deal of what  
Ms. St. James had to say. Of primary concern are her comments on  
pimps. We fail to see the validity in a line of reasoning which runs, “If legal, taxpayers pay for the vice  
we allow rape and wife beating, why not pimps?” Is not the “we”  
referred to here the oppressive male system which is the enemy of us  
all? Are we to agree that because women have been made the victims of  
rapists and wife-beaters, we should also be made the victims of pimps?  
Are we to agree that because women have been made the victims of  
rapists and wife-beaters, we should also be made the victims of pimps?  
The editors also take exception to the remarks made about lesbians  
and lesbian prostitutes. The equating of a woman committing oral sex  
with a man, with a woman making love with another woman is  
repugnant to us. And to say that the lack of financial resources is the  
reason why lesbians don’t frequent hookers is an insult to all women,  
and “a male tendency toward objectification and de-  
personalized sex.”  

There are a number of other points with which we are also un-  
comfortable. For one, we take little comfort in the knowledge that while  
20% of all women who walk the streets ‘get brutalized by the cops,’ only  
16% get brutalized by “their” pimps. For another, we doubt that  
“every housewife in America” has read even one of Xaviera Hollander’s  
books, nor do we appreciate the stereotypical view of “housewives.”  
We could go on, but space is limited. For the rest, we leave the reader to  
draw her own conclusions.  

After the morality trips have  
been dusted off the true objec-  
tion to decriminalization comes.

Katie O’Brien

Margo St. James is a char-  
ming woman whose eyes are  
permanently smile-crinkled. She  
is imminently interested in  
money, or the lack of it, as it  
applies to women. She can  
disarm a harasser with a warm  
smile and a brief comment (‘I fall  
in love every spring.’) or her  
eyes can turn to steel and she  
can leave a predator withering  
and wishing he’d never tangled  
with her (once when a Hell's  
Angel started undressing,  
threatening to “fuck her good,”  
she pointed to his genitalia and  
laughing hysterically, said ‘with  
that?’) She’s an ex-law student,  
a political activist, a strong  
feminist and author of the up-  
coming Whores, Housewives  
and Other Mothers. Margo has  
been all three.

She started hooking fifteen  
years ago when busted on a bum  
soliciting charge. Out on bail two  
days later she found she was  
jobless with no prospects. The  
only choice was to make the  
crime fit the punishment — she  
took to the streets. Now, as the  
founder of “a loose woman's  
organization,” COYOTE, (Call  
Off Your Old Tired Ethic) she is  
no longer in the business but  
working and fighting for the  
decriminalization of prostitution.

Prejudice

The world's oldest profession  
is rife with prejudice and punish-  
ment, with the woman always  
the victim. Speaking at the  
University of Colorado on Oc-  
tober 7th Margo called for more  
“bad” women. One of her  
primary objectives in these  
speaking engagements is to  
shed some light on the hooker  
myths. Films and religious  
fanatics view prostitution as  
perverted, sick. Feminist groups  
refuse support for what they see  
as the ultimate in exploitation.  
While Margo doesn't seem to be  
pushing for full membership in  
the front pews of the local  
Church, she is pushing for the  
right of women to control their  
own bodies, and make money  
through the only medium of  
economy they know — their  
bodies.

It is very easy for a woman to  
be picked up for soliciting. All it  
takes is the presence of a vice  
squad member and his opinion  
that the woman in question is  
exhibiting lewd and lascivious  
conduct. As Margo points out,  
“how many men do you know  
who have been arrested for  
directing the same types of  
remarks to a woman?” Once  
arrested the woman’s money  
can be confiscated as  
“evidence”; she can be brutalized  
on the way down to the  
station, especially if she doesn’t  
keep up the expected banter.  
Under the law a woman can lose  
her home, children and any  
chance of entering another  
profession if she capitalizes on  
the present system — the same  
down to “but these women don’t  
pay taxes.” As Margo explains,  
hookers get to keep ap-  
proximately 10 to 20% of their  
earnings once the pimps, land-  
lords, cabbies, grocers, literally  
anyone who poses a threat to  
her cover, are paid off.

Approximately 10% of all  
hookers are lesbians. Since  
most sex requested of whores is  
oral anyway, this doesn’t seem  
to work any particular hardship  
on lesbians. (I find that hard to  
swallow!) The fact is lesbians in  
the business find themselves  
more compassionate and  
tolerant towards men after they  
have been hooking for a while.  
Perhaps a grudging respect  
associated with payment?  
Regarding lesbian hookers ser-  
vicing other lesbians, Margo  
points out that women don't  
have the money to pay hookers  
so it is not a big business.

Economics

Convincing politicians they're  
ten years behind the times is not  
an easy task. In fighting for  
decriminalization of prostitution,  
Margo is convinced she’s taking  
the first step towards cleaning  
up politics. She is presently  
advocating that hookers up the  
price to $20.00 until the ERA is  
passed. When asked how she  
rationalizes her feminism with  
hooking she grins and says,  
“when the choice is kissing ass  
or sucking cock, I'll take the one  
that pays $25.00 or better an  
hour.”

Interview

BMR: Margo, could you go into  
some more of the myths vs. the  
facts surrounding prostitution?  
MSJ: Dope is one of the biggest  
myths — the one that says all  
hookers become junkies and  
that heroin is intertwined with  
street prostitution. Particularly  
police and doctors would have  
you believe this. Ninety per cent  
of the women junkies turn to  
prostitution to support their  
habit. The opposite is not true —  
ninety percent of all hookers are  
not junkies. The only dope most  
of them are into is speed so they  
can work longer. Lesbianism  
among prostitutes is another  
myth. It’s the same as the  
general population, about 10%.  
People would have you believe  
we're man-haters but we aren't  
any more than all lesbians are.  
Mistreatment at the hands of  
pimps is another overblown  
myth. Twenty per cent of all  
women who work the streets get  
brutalized by the cops as op-  
posed to 16% by their pimps. The  
illegality of prostitution is also a  
sign to the perverted Jack the  
Ripper types that it’s all right to  
rip women off. He can pick her  
up pretending to be a trick and do  
anything, right down to murder.  
BMR: How will decriminal-  
ization change that?  

MSJ: It will allow discreet  
advertising, allow women to  
work in a safer way, off the  
streets. But I don’t want to see  
any kind of rules or regs put on  
by the city, county or state  
because it again allows a  
middleman to make money off  
the women. We need total  
decriminalization to keep the  
worker from getting screwed.  
BMR: Regarding middlemen,  
are they necessary? Isn’t 35% of  
a large sum a better take than  
90% of an open field with no  
contacts?  

MSJ: No, because with  
decriminalization many doors  
will open. Sex will become avail-  
able to many who would never  
have sought it before — the  
aged, the retarded, the handi-  
capped. These are people who  
would never, as a rule, contact a  
pimp. But everybody needs sex.  
BMR: I'd like to get back to some  
of the myths. How about VD?  
MSJ: That's the good one. The  
myth that all whores are dirty.  
Until we admit that everyone can  
get it and that everyone has it,  
it's going to be an epidemic  
problem. The highest percent-  
age of VD is among young people  
who don’t know any better due  
to lack of sex education coupled  
with loosening of morals. The  
highest rate of VD is in the age group  
15-25. Not among prostitutes.  
The nationwide statistics for VD  
among prostitutes is under 5%.  
BMR: How many in that 5% get  
it given to them by customers?  
MSJ: Most of them do get it from  
the customers. Houses in  
Nevada claim their women have  
a check every week. Ludicrous.  
Logical. After being checked,  
her second customer could give  
it to her and she could pass it on  
to 60 customers during the  
week, before the next check. If  
they were really concerned why  
not take a slide from every man  
who visits the houses? But they  
don't want to embarrass the  
customer. But if you really want  
to cure VD, get the men who are  
passing it around instead of  
blaming the women, locking  
them in jail, denying bail,  
quarantining, shooting them up  
unnecessarily. The choice is  
being held over for a few days  
until tests come back or take a  
shot. Not wanting to stay in jail  
they opt for the shot. So, bad  
medicine causes imbalance in  
the vagina, yeast infection, etc.  
And some jerk gets a vicarious  
pleasure out of watching these  
women rub their asses. Know  
any other disease you can go to  
jail for supposedly passing on?  
BMR: What about the myth of  
faking orgasms?  

MSJ: Prostitutes know how to  
have orgasms better than  
straight women. Or anyone else  
who hasn't had sex education  
for that matter. If a customer has  
been going to a whore for any  
length of time he’s a good lover.  
Hookers don't lie to men about  
their technique; they don't want  
to be subjected to a lot of bad sex  
so they speak up. Hookers don't  
have the romantic inhibitions of  
a lover. They'll tell a man if he  
needs to lighten up.  

Public Opinion  
BMR: Is there any particular  
image COYOTE is working for or  
are you mostly concerned with  
legal aspects?  
MSJ: It’s very important to mold  
public opinion and that’s what  
we're doing. If we're successful  
we'll change more of the sexist  
attitudes of this country than any  
other group. The illegality of  
prostitution is an object lesson to  
all women to watch their p's and  
q's and stay at home or have a  
respectful job. It’s also a lesson  
to men that they can rip women  
off and get away with it. It  
teaches that if women are out  
alone they deserve to be ripped  
off or raped. Police are brothers  
of the rapists in this instance.  
They perpetuate that attitude  
that gives the United States the  
highest rape incidence in the  
world. As long as the condoned  
arm of the establishment can rip  
us off, all men think they have  
that right.  
BMR: Have Xaviera Hollander's  
books helped or hindered the  
image of the hooker?  
MSJ: Her books at least brought  
the subject up. Every housewife  
in America read it so it at least  
opened the doors. Xaviera hasn't  
any political or social conscious-  
ness but it was a start.  
BMR: How do most hookers get  
started?  
MSJ: By being solicited enough  
times and finally saying yes. I've  
been propositioned for money  
since I was 15 or 16 years old.  
Women are fucked from the time  
they're born, why not get paid?  
BMR: How do hookers compare  
with straights for strength,  
moral fiber, etc.?  
MSJ: Prostitutes are just as  
romantically oppressed as any  
other group of women. Just  
because they know men inside  
out doesn’t mean they have any  
more control over their  
emotions. They work, business-  
like, cool, independent. In their  
private lives they're romantically  
oppressed by some guy. They  
choose to be. They're not  
advancing any faster than  
anyone else. In fact maybe  
slower because they're more  
isolated.  
BMR: Are there any feminists  
hooking?  
MSJ: Not many. Hookers don't
