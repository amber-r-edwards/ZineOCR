Dear Carol,

It is a privilege, a personal risk,
and a responsibility to report for
the feminist press. I know it is a
job you take very seriously. This
letter is feedback and criticism of
your article on Joan Little, (BMR
Sept. 75) both the politics and
the journalism of it. Believe me, I
am not nit-picking. I am very
serious about what I've got to
say.

Since I was in Raleigh, and at-
tended the Little trial for a week,
my disagreements arise both
from different perceptions of
what happened and a different
analysis of what the signifi-
cance of the trial is to the
women’s movement. The dif-
ferent analysis centers around
what I consider your excusing
feminists’ political passivity, and
your pitting racism against sex-
ism.

Responsibility

It is true the Joan Little
Defense Fund (JLDF) did not
have a strong consciousness
about sexism, and paid it lipser-
vice mostly. They did have a deep
consciousness about racism,
and how it operates in both the
rapes of black women and the
false convictions of black men, at
least in North Carolina. To me,

Big Mama Rag Vol. 3-A, No. 11

Joan Little: Women

Racial Bias Seen in Little Coverage

the responsibility for raising the
issues of sexism in this trial,
given the make-up of the JLDF
and the defense team, rested
primarily with feminists, both
nationally and locally. In local
fund-raising activities around
the country, both racism and
sexism were raised as political
issues, depending on the make-
up of the local organizations.
However, in Raleigh, there was
no strong feminist organization
to raise those issues in a
national spotlight or to raise the
consciousness of the defense
team itself. And nationally, as far
as I know, no women’s organiza-
tion devoted itself substantially
to the Little case. (Where was
NOW’s national task force on
racism, or on prisons? Or NBFO?)
Shitwork Appropriate

I remember you and I talked
about it in Raleigh. Where are
the feminists? Why weren't
women at the trial? I think that
the answer is much more com-

plex than that poor feminists

were “white-braided.” To me, it is
completely appropriate for the
JLDF to ask white feminists to
raise money and to organize
white women to march in,
demonstrations at the court-
house. In any case, being per-

sonally offended is no excuse for
feminists not to continue to work
on Joan's case and all of its
issues. Or to excuse feminists
from their responsibility be-
cause they had done “shit
work,” had their phones used,
put up posters, etc., is just plain
bad politics. Politically, white
feminists must be able to work
with blacks on cases of mutual
concern, or they must form their
own groups and raise issues
strongly and independently.

My own impression was that
TALF (Triangle Area Lesbian
Feminists) women were isolated
from the black community and
into a separatist politics that
didn't challenge them to deal
with racism actively. They barely
had a political base in the white
lesbian community, much less
among white feminists, white
women generally, or black
women at all. To blame the black
community for not giving leader-
ship to these women is a joke —
inexperienced politically,
separatist in direction and acting
out a kind of intellectual defen-
siveness about their own in-
action, they were useless to
JLDF as a political organization.
Apparently, they were unable as
a group, either to form a strong
independent support group for
Joan, or to work with the JLDF,
or to build relationships across
race/class lines that could be
politically useful to them in the
future.

Racism vs. Sexism

My other serious criticism is
that you pitted racism against
sexism. The misleading head-
line (“Little Freed; Feminism
Raped”) the subhead, (Racism,
Not Sexism”) and your tone at
the end of the article did that. I
believe this to be bad politics be-
cause it fails to present the total
situation of the black woman,
and it furthers destructive
political diatribes over which is
the more serious oppression.

Sexism Not Obscured

And finally, you state that the
“important thing feminists must
see from the Joan Little case is
that rape and sexism were
obscured by the issue of racism
by both black and white men
who used the case to further
their political-personal am-
bitions and reputations.” NO!
Racism did not obscure sexism.
The point is that no one took res-
ponsibility for raising the issue
of sexism at the trial, including
the local NBFO chapter. There
are many reasons for this, not
necessarily related to anyone's
personal ambitions. For ex-
ample, the fact is that Joan went
to the black for help initially, and
not to feminists; or that Jerry
Paul had no strong feminist con-
tacts in that area; or that there
were no well-organized, cred-
ible feminist groups there.

Important Lessons

I think the important thing for
white and black feminists to
learn about this case is how to
relate to people across race
lines, how to take responsibility
for raising issues, to create both
independent organizations and
coalitions that can work con-
structively on joint issues. The
failure to learn these lessons
could mean that minority com-
munities will never take white
feminists seriously, and that
white feminists will never have
the opportunity to learn from
those outside their own
race/class backgrounds.

While I don't entirely agree
that it “is a privilege, a personal
risk and a responsibility” to
report for the feminist press, I do
feel that we have a serious
responsibility to each other
when we criticize our political
differences especially when that
criticism is published in the
feminist press.

This letter is a response to the
criticism by Jackie St. Joan, of
my article on the Joan Little trial
(BMR, Sept. 75). It illustrates
how the article was not in any
way “irresponsible journalism”
as has been charged. It shows
that our differences are mainly
political and chiefly involve our
different interpretation and
analysis of the trial and its
importance to the women's
movement.

The facts of the case and the
analysis printed aren’t contrived
or dishonest or “incorrect.” I
spent countless hours listening
to often monotonous, some-
times fascinating but always
revealing testimony that slowly
but inevitably uncovered
defense strategy, politics and
priorities.
Passivity Not Excused

In no way was “feminist
political passivity” excused in
the article. It was reported and
examined. By talking to area
feminists I found out what they
had done and actually tried to do,
what they didn’t do and couldn't
do. I strongly disagree that “the
responsibility for raising the
issues of sexism in the trial,
given the make-up of the JLDF
and the defense team, rested
with feminists…” It did not
solely rest with feminists, and
feminists did raise those issues.
They simply weren't allowed to
use the auspices of the JLDF —
its money, resources, and con-
nections to deal with sexism.

Area feminists that I talked to,
both black and white, had a race
consciousness and saw the
issue of racism as vital in the
trial and as important as that of
sexism. It was not they who
chose to ignore, negate or in-
validate any political oppression.
Fledgeling Groups Defended

It is destructive, non-suppor-
tive, belittling and is contradic-
tory to feminist principles to
criticize Triangle Area Lesbian-
Feminists (TALF) women for not
being politically sophisticated
and experienced in community
action when their group was at
best a few months old when
Little turned herself in.

The local NBFO, the other
feminist group that you so
criticize for their inaction, was
only six weeks old when the
testimony of the trial started.
It is chauvinist and elitist to be
critical of one of the first groups
of black feminists in the area,
who had little political ex-
perience, because they didn’t
jump into the JLDF mire as soon
as the ink was dry on their
chapter papers.

The JLDF evidently thought
that the issue of sexism was
good enough to use to raise tens
of thousands of dollars for her
defense effort. It thought the
issue of rape was good enough
to get national/international
support and publicity that made
the trial one of the more impor-
tant and well-publicized trials of
the decade. But the JLDF and the
defense team didn’t think that
the issue of sexism was good
enough to use in the defense or
in raising the consciousness of
Little’s supporters.

Shitwork

It is not “appropriate for the
JLDF to ask white feminists to raise
money and organize white
women to march in
demonstrations” when the fund
ignored and shut out those same
feminists months earlier when
they tried to raise the pertinent
issues of rape and sexism in
Little’s case. Again, the money
that these women helped raise
was acceptable and the “shit
work” they did was acceptable.
Their insistence upon raising
feminist issues and having input
into policy and power was
not. Feminist presence was
threatening and unwelcome.
The women then disassociated
themselves from the group and
were understandably insulted
when a man came to them not
long after telling them to organize
women for demonstrations.

There is nothing indica-
tive of “bad politics” about
showing how feminists
responded to intimida-
tion through the rhetoric of
racism. The article did not ex-
cuse feminists from anything
but it did not indict them either.
Feminists I spoke with didn’t get
further involved with the JLDF
after they realized that the issue
of sexism was really being
ignored, because they felt that
any dissent, especially from a
women’s group, would have
been viewed as divisive to the
