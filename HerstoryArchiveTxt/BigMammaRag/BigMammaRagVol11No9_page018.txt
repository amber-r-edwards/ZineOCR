meetings and organizing with  
each other, confronting ra-

Canada is a reaction to the  
political work being done  
there. Many groups active in  
the environmental and anti-  
war movements have tried to  
put as much distance between  
themselves and the Five as  
possible: unwilling to imagine  
"that the Five might in fact  

be innocent. This possibility  

seemed to have escaped most  
people who have taken it for  
granted that the state would  
never arrest innocent people.  
Bulldozer For political  
groups like Bulldozer, who  
support the Vancouver Five  
politically and personally,  
who refuse to deny the links  
between themselves and all  
political prisoners, continued  

is inevitable.

As political prisoners, sup-  
porters, and revolutionaries  
in Canada and the US have  
learned and are still learn-  
ing--the repression is escala-  

ting here and everywhere and  

our actions and politics make  
us criminals. As Shelly Miller,  
a New York grand jury resister  
said: "I think it's very seri-  
ous, that question of crimin-  
alization of politics...be-  
cause they're trying to make  
political activity illegal."

pists and batterers and the  
cops, picketing and demon-  
strating and doing civil dis-  
obedience, and on and on.

We in the predominantly  
white women's movement, in  
order to really fight the  
violence perpetrated against  
us, need to do all these  
things and also make coali-  
tions with all oppressed  
peoples. Until we refuse to  
do single issue organizing,  
the women's movement will  
continue to be racist and  
classist. We must fight from  
the "grass roots" up, looking  
to each other for support and  

Struggle to grow and change  

and make a new society.
