Investigation of Chicago's Abortion Clinics Causing Controversy _

Pressure Mounting To  
End All Abortions  

Vicki Piotter  

Under explosive headlines, the  
Chicago Sun-Times started publishing  
in the middle of November the results  
of their five-month “undercover”  
investigation of Chicago's abortion  
clinics. The newspaper's reports  
have added even more to the battle  
being waged in Illinois politics  
around the issue of abortion.  

Sun-Times investigators reported  
that conditions varied greatly from  
clinic to clinic, but four of the  
most blatant violators were guilty  
of the following: abortion procedures  
performed on dozens of women who were  
not pregnant; abortions performed on  
women over the 12-week limit;  
high instances of infection and other  
serious complications as a result of  
unsterile conditions; incompetent  
staff, falsified medical records,  
Medicaid fraud; and lack of critical  
post-operative reports and examina-  
tions.  

In some clinics where doctors re-  
ceive payment by the abortion, the  
operation was completed in as little  
as two minutes, without time for the  
anesthetics to take effect as physi-  
cians raced each other. It was also  
discovered that several referral ser-  
vices receive payment for each pat-  
ient sent to the clinic, and that  
some counselors are paid not to coun-  
sel but to convince the woman to have  
an abortion.  

Since the stories have appeared,  
politicians have scrambled to cover  
themselves or get mileage out of  
public sentiment. For example, State  
Sen. Richard Daley (son of the former  
mayor) hastily announced he would re-  
introduce legislation requiring state  

licensing of all abortion counselors.  

The Illinois Planned Parenthood  
Council and other critics of the  
Daley measure argue that passage  
would fail to prevent unethical coun-  

seling procedures while unnecessarily  

disqualifying a large number of vol-  

unteer and "non-professional" counsel-  
ors who work at crisis centers as well  

as clinics.  
And of course, the right-to-lifers  
are riding again, demanding addition-  

al restrictive legislation on a state-  

wide level, and have gotten a shot in  
the arm in their efforts to place a  
Human Life Amendment to the Consti-  
tution, “demanding recognition of the  
personhood and all constitutional  
rights for the pre-born child in the  
womb."  

While the Sun-Times series contin-  
ues, it is expected they will detail  
favorably conditions found at other  
Chicago clinics. Susan Hicks, execu-  
tive director of a "clean clinic",  
the Midwest Population Center, said  
that, "the public information aspect  
of the series is positive. If people  
had this information earlier, these  
clinics would not be able to exist."  
Since the publicity, she said more  
women have become more critical and  
ask many more questions.  

Women's groups in the Chicago area  
held a press conference in mid Nov-  
ember, discussing a pro-choice ap-  
proach to the recent disclosures. The  
Chicago Coalition of Concerned Women  

said, "We are faced with two choices—  

to go forwards or to go backwards. To  

go backwards is to return to the years  

prior to 1973, to the time before  
legalization of abortion and the  
horrors of back alley abortions, coat  
hangers, hotel rooms, infections and  
murders."  

They further stated that although  
they support the closing of abortion  

clinics with the worst abuses, "these"  

clinics are the major providers of  
services to Medicaid patients, and  

thus, once more, poor and third world’  

women are the ones most likely to  
suffer.”  

The news reports have also turned  
attention to the status of the "Burke  
Amendment" currently before the Chica-  
go city council, sponsored by a num-  
ber of right-to-life groups. The  
amendment would require physician  
counseling of a woman prior to her  
abortion; that the Board of Health  
"develop reasonable regulations for  
the humane disposal of unborn child-  
ren after abortions"; and that women,  
their parents when they're minors and  
their husbands be given pictures and  
information on the characteristics of  
the unborn child at the time of the  
abortion.  

While the effects of the investiga-  
tion in Chicago are not yet resolved,  
one sure thing is that other news-  
papers across the country, following  
the "success" of the Sun-Times, will  
seek out sensational headlines of  
their own. Instead of focusing on  
how to weed out those doctors and  
clinics which are capitalizing and  
profiteering on a woman's misfortune,  
the pressure will skyrocket to shut  
down all abortion operations.

How close are we getting to that all  
too familiar back alley? In a little  
over a year, since the passage of the  
Hyde Amendment in August 1977 cutting  
federal monies for abortion, the num-  
ber of Medicaid abortions has dropped  
98% in states following the new govern-  
ment guidelines.  

Today, only six states provide state  
funding for poor women in need of abor-  
tion, a horrifying figure compared to  
the 47 states which offered funding  
before the August ‘77 date.  

In New Jersey, the number has fallen  
from 1,150 abortions funded a month to  
just 19. In Texas, from 257 to 2 a  
month. In fact, the cutoff of funds  
has been almost total in many states,  
despite the exceptions that are sup-  
posed to be made.  

A woman's right to choose was hit  
in further attacks, this time by the  
Ninety-Fifth Congress. Among other

Sioux Mother Fights

"To remove the child from the in-  
fluence of its savage parents" was  
the goal stated in the charter of  
the first federal boarding school  
for Native ("Indian") children in  
1890. That goal is still intact in  
1978 as shown in the fight of Berna-  
dine Brokenleg for custody of her  
child.  

To rear a “child who has physical  
features of a non-Indian nature...  
in an environment (the reservation)  
consisting of primarily Indian  
people...would be detrimental to  
her physical and emotional well-  
being," ruled a Texas court judge  
in deciding to deny Brokenleg cus-  
tody of her child in 1976. Today,  
the Sioux mother of Tiffany Butts,  
whose father is white, has taken  
her appeal to the US Supreme Court.  

Native groups have argued strong-  
ly against the ruling. It is  
“plainly inaccurate to say that be-  
cause an Indian has blue eyes or  
light hair or complexion that he  
cannot become accepted as an Indian  
person..." reads a statement by the  
8,000 member Rosebud Sioux nation  
in South Dakota.  

Meanwhile, Tiffany has been raised  
most of her nine years outside of  
the reservation by her white pater-  
nal grandparents in a society which  
scorns her Native cultural values.  
Child of a mixed marriage, Tiffany  
moved with her mother to the Rose-  
bud reservation in 1972, after  
Brokenleg's marriage to Bernard

ment budget restricting abortion fund-  
ing;

tional conference calling for the

tional activities, lawsuits and lobby-  
ing.

of the Supreme Court decision giving  
women the legal right to choose abor-

Supreme Court Test  

The US Supreme Court agreed last  
month to review a 1974 Massachusetts  
law which requires single women un-  
der 18 to get parental or court  
permission in order to obtain an  
abortion. Recognizing that a "minor  
has a basic constitutional right  
to abortion” which may be interfered  
with by “potentially hostile" par-  
ents, the Court took the case after  
it was tied up in Massachusetts  
state courts for two years.  

"What this law has accomplished,"  
said Leslie Cagan of the Boston  
Abortion Coalition, "is the utter

Butts was annulled. Fourteen months  
later, her father and his parents  
took the girl away on vacation and  
never returned her.  

Since 1973, Butts' parents have  
kept Tiffany in their home in Texas,  
where Brokenleg has visited her  
daughter three times.  

In 1975, the grandparents peti-  
tioned for custody, claiming that  
the mother had abandoned and ne-  
glected her child in violation of  
Texas law.  

Even though a psychiatrist and  
two officers of the tribe testified  
that Brokenleg was a competent  
mother and that the child's best  
interests would be served by re-  
maining on the reservation, the  
court decided in favor of the grand-  
parents. Yet, Brokenleg was not  
deemed an "unfit" mother.  

Tiffany's fate reflects the na-  
tional statistics on the forced sep-  
aration of Native children from  
their Native families. One out of  
four Native children is taken from  
her/his people and placed in a  
white foster home or institution.  

Native people have battled back  
through legislative action and as  
part of the overall struggle for  
tribal sovereignty against what  
many charge is cultural genocide  
through “Indian removal" policies.  
And they recently scored a victory  
as Native groups throughout the  
states welcomed implementation of  
the Indian Child Welfare Act.  

Finally passed by Congress this  
fall after years of legislative  
stalling tactics, the bill was  

signed by President Carter on Nov-  
ember 9. It will "stop the theft  

of Indian children and recognize  

that tribal courts are the appropri-  
ate judicial bodies" for deciding  
the welfare of Native children. In  
addition, the bill would set mini-  
mum due process standards, such as  
prohibiting the conditions of pov-  
erty on many reservations from being  
used as evidence of neglectful  
parents.  

How the Welfare Act will affect  
the Supreme Court's decision to  
accept or reject the Brokenleg  
case is uncertain; however, many  
people are hopeful the bill will  
lessen the chances of similar cases  
recurring.
