At last there is a health  
clinic in Denver that will give  
us thorough medical care;  
that will teach us about  
keeping our bodies healthy;  
that will teach us about keeping  
our bodies healthy; that takes  
a feminist viewpoint of our  
problems in the male-dominated  
social and medical  
worlds; and that doesn’t rip  
us off with high medical fees.

Creative Health Services,  
which is located at 4645 East  
Colfax Ave., began in 1972 as  
an idea of a group of nurse  
practitioners. Realizing the  
oppressive nature of the  
traditional doctor-nurse and  
doctor-patient relationships,  
the 16 RNs (13 of whom hold  
master's degrees in nursing)  
set out to make it on their  
own.

The group sought to  
advance the nurses’ role in the  
eyes of the public, to  
establish an independent  
economic base for nurses,  
and at the same time to offer  
responsive health care to  
women and the larger  
community. The solution  
seemed to be a clinic - a  
nurses clinic that the working  
staff would create, control  
and direct. Money to open the  
clinic was raised by $300  
investment from each staff  
member. There is no govern-  
ment or foundation funding.  
With equal financial shares  
and equal positions in the  
clinic, each member would  
have equal say in the  
operations, creating a non-  
competitive and supportive  
atmosphere.

Clinic For Whom?  
A clinic for whom, though?  

And offering what services? -  

“We felt that higher income  
people had no problem with  
adequate medical care, and  
that good care is also offered  
through the Denver hospitals  
for those who are destitute,  
even though they do not  
always know how to obtain it.  
We also felt, however, that  
low-middle income people  
were not offered good medical  
care at a price they could  
afford. These people have  
been our target group,”  
claimed Rorry Zahourek, an RN  
from the clinic.

With help from the Denver  
chapter of NOW, studies were  
conducted to determine the  
geographic location of the  
target group. The clinic was  
then located according to data  
gathered from the studies.

At the same time, the  
nurses began to consider  
their operational goals and  
problems as well as the  
specific services the clinic  
could offer. The clinic decided  
to have a “wellness” orienta-  
tion - to promote health and  
prevent illness, and to teach  
people how to deal with their  
chronic illnesses. Pediatrics,  
maternity and family plan-  
ning, adult medical surgical,  
and psychiatric mental health  
would comprise the major  
areas of practice.

A First for Nurses

Creative Health Services  
was officially opened in  
December of last year. The  
first clinic in Denver to be  
staffed entirely by nurse prac-  
titioners, the venture was  
initially met with skepticism  
by the local medical estab-  
lishment. The efforts of CHS  
to keep their cohorts infor-  
med, however, has gone a  
long way toward easing that  
initial concern. “We now have  

a good relationship with other  
areas of the medical profes-  
sion,” stated Frank Lane, the  
only male member of the CHS  
team.

An advisory board was  
formed to augment the clinic  
staff. It is composed of RNs  
and doctors and includes a  
social worker, an environ-  
mental economist, a health  
planner, and a consumer  
counselor. This board has  
proved itself vital, both in  
terms of the clinic and  
patients, and in maintaining  
communications and under-  
standing between CHS and  
the medical profession of  
Denver.

Most patients at CHS are  
women who live within a ten  
mile radius of the clinic. Many  
nurses as well as older  
people, children and minority  
groups come to CHS.

In addition to physical  
health care the organization  
offers community programs  
that have been highly success-  
ful. Focusing on the prob-  
lems of being a woman in  
today's society, the programs  
emphasized women's self-  
concept, with special empha-  
sis on assertiveness training.  
Response was so favorable  
that CHS is considering  
sponsoring another similar  
workshop if community needs  
and interests indicate.

Offering improved alterna-  
tives for patients, Creative  
Health Services provides hyp-  
nosis therapy for smoking  
(which they say has been  
partially effective) and for pain  
control with good results.

Emphasis on Teaching

Preventive health care re-  
quires knowledge of one’s  
body and how to care for it. A  
physical for women, for  

example, includes not only a  
pelvic exam, pap smear, and  
breast exam, but instruction  
in doing self-breast exams  
and in how our body works.  
You are told about the special  
medical and health needs of  
women and how to keep  
healthy.

One patient told us, “I have  
never been so involved with  
my own physical. Every step  
of the way everything was  
explained to me, I was  

encouraged to participate in  
parts of the exam, and was  
educated to my body in a  
way that I have never been.  
I was a participant rather than a  
mannequin on a table being  
worked over by some ‘profes-  
sional’.”

As yet, CHS does not teach  
pelvic self-exams, but is most  

“Everything About Me is Fine”

Members of the all-woman  
play at the Changing Scene  
practicing for their November 7  
performances.

Two one-act plays written  
and performed by women will  
be presented at the Changing  
Scene, 1527½ Champa (be-  
tween 15th and 16th on  
Champa in downtown Denver)  
beginning on Thursday, Nov-  
ember 7th. The plays will  
begin at 8:30 on Thursdays,  
Fridays, and Saturdays, the  
7th thru the 9th and the 14th  
thru the 16th. It will begin at  
7:30 on the two Sundays, the  
10th and 17th of November.

The two plays, in alphabeti-  
cal order, are Kathia by Janet  
McReynolds and The Thrilling  
Life of a Circus Performer  
Will One Day Be Yours by  
Theresa Marffie-Evangelista.

Kathia is a gothic tale set in  
San Francisco about a woman  
who takes a room in the house  
of an older woman. The older  
woman has been renting  
rooms for years so she could  
increase her “adopted daugh-  
ters” in a special, hidden  
room. The mental process  
that will ultimately end in the  
possession of one person over  
another begins soon after the  
young woman moves into the  
house and discovers the true  
identity of the landlady. The  
house comes to represent the  
woman's life and her actions  
determine her survival.

Janet McReynolds who has  
also written and published a  

book (that is now out of print)  
“I Have a Great Desire,” which  
is about the relationships  
between a woman, a soldier,  
and a yet to be born child. The  
playwright also writes a  
column in the “other” Boulder  
daily (the Colorado Daily  
being THE daily in Boulder)  
and will be giving a reading of  
her poetry at the University of  
Colorado in the UMC on  
December 10th.

The Thrilling Life of a  
Circus Performer Will One Day  
Be Yours is a play about the  
relationships of women to  
women. The main character,  
who is portrayed by two  
actresses, is at a crisis-deci-  
sion making point of her life.  
The play shows her relation-  
ships with different women in  
different periods and aspects  
of her life, and it depicts her  
loss and the loss of all  
women. But in the words of  
Diane McDaniel, a woman  
involved in the play, “Life  
doesn't let you resolve any-  
thing. It just goes on.”

Some of the women who  
have been working together in  
the play say that they have  
really gotten to know each  
other - and other women’s  
feelings and have developed  
close friendships with each  
other through the weeks of  
rehearsals. Says Stephanie  
Nellhaus, who plays the part  
of Mary, the daughter of one  
of the women, “I have a good  
understanding of women  
through this play.”

It is much easier to do a  
play with all women cast  
members than with men and  
women, says one member of  
the play's cast. Male actors  
don’t seem to work as hard.  
Women are more dedicated,  
give each other support and  
have more empathy for their  
character and for each other.

Theresa Marffie-Evangelista  
has written other plays, is  
from New York.

Rick Collier is the director  
of both one-act plays and is  
currently appearing in  
“Championship Season” at  
the Gaslight Theatre in Den-  
ver. He receives good reviews  
from the players members of  
both casts. He works directly  
with each individual and is  
easy to get along with,  
something which can’t be said  
for most other directors.  
Since the play is about  
women, he relies on the cast  
members to interpret the roles  
instead of putting his “own  
ideas of what women should  
feel and how women should  
act in the play. He seems to  
give the cast the freedom they  
need to use their own  
experiences as women in the  
play.
