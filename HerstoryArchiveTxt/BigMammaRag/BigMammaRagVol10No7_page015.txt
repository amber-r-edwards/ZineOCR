I Never Got To Say from page 13 __-

growing up without me. When I  
think back, sometimes I don't  
even know how I lived through  
it....actually, there were  
times that I did come close  
to dying from my own hand,  
but somehow I never quite  
carried it through!

In December, 1981 I saw an  
ad in the Rocky Mountain News  
announcing a Mothers Without  
Custody meeting. I was  
astounded! Other women like  
me? Where have they been all  
my life? During the month of  
December, when this group was  
being born locally, we (six  
of us) met every single week!  
It was the Christmas season,  
the season to be jolly, and  
we were so thrilled to have  
found each other! From the  
discussions that I have been  
involved in with the Mothers  
Without Custody group I have  
found several things to be  
true:

The court system mostly  
looks upon us as nonpersons.  
If we left, for whatever  
reason, we must be punished,  
by the judges, by the ex-  
husbands, by society. If we  
are lucky, we may have an ex-  
husband that takes kindly to  
our plight and "lets" us have  
visitation rights IF he feels  
that we are not living in sin,  
living a lesbian lifestyle,  
hanging out with hippies.....  
I think some of them picture  
us as dancing through a life  
without a care in the world  
(now that we are rid of our  
children).....In actuality,  
some of us are wondering how  
we are going to make it  
through the next day, physi-  
cally, emotionally, and  
financially without falling  
apart!

If we have exchanged cus-  
tody, thinking that we would  
retain a close relationship  
with our children because he  
was so good about agreeing to  
the terms, nine times out of  
ten, he will move so far away  
as to deny us this close re-  
lationship because we can't  
afford all the plane trips and  
telephone calls necessary to  
keep it going. It certainly  
has never turned out like we  
thought it would! If our  
children were taken away by  
the "child welfare" agency,  
we must have been really evil  
and mistreated our children  
and "somebody" just had to  
step in and do something for  
the poor children.....never  
mind the poor mother.....If

our child has been snatched  
by the father we usually  
don't have a chance to find  
him/her because the courts  
don't look upon it as kid-  
napping so we live in the  
agony of guilt that we  
weren't more careful and  
where is my child now? and  
does s/he still remember me?  
CECs-p) \CECiin so 2

So, women who remain  
childless are unnatural.  
Women who “abandon" their  
children are crazy, heartless  
lesbians, selfish, you name  
it. We are going through a  
phase, flipped out, thinking  
only of ourselves and the fun  
we are going to have. Every  
day we are dealing with  
society's attitude toward us  
and with our own attitudes  
toward us. We are varied in  
our experiences and how we  
got to be mothers without  
custody. Our lifestyles run  
the gamut from straight to  
gay to all the other stops on  
the continuum, but we all  
share common bonds: We are  
mothers, our child/children  
are living apart from us, we  
are (as one woman in the  
group put it) survivors in a  
wilderness territory.

At our meetings we are  
finding positive ways of  
dealing with our situations.  
On Mother's Day weekend we  
went on a camping trip in  
Pike National Forest and 3/4  
of the group who went had  
never even camped before!  
This was the first Mother's  
Day that I have actually  
enjoyed. We share our feel-  
ings, we talk about our fears,  
how our children will look  
when they step off the plane  
and we haven't seen them for  
a year, how they will treat  
us, how we will treat them...  
We have speakers at our

meetings who talk to us about  
the legal system that we know  
so little about, who help us  
learn to be assertive, fight  
fairly, feel good about our-  
selves. We set up networks  
for mothers without custody  
to always have someone to  
talk to in an emotional  
crisis, and after all the  
years of thinking I was the  
only one, I have found other  
women who support each other,  
so we can all learn to  
support ourselves.

We encourage any woman who  
is living separately from her  
children, or even considering  
the possibility, to come to  

our meetings. We are an emo-  
tional support group with  
resources and information to  
share. Being a mother with-  
out custody in the society  
that we live in is a far-  
reaching experience that  
touches every aspect of a  
woman's life and we are find-  
ing it a lot easier knowing  
that there are other women  
who do not need an explana-  
tion, who know how we feel...  
Meetings are held on the  
first Sunday of each month,  
7 p.m., Glendale Firehouse  
Community Room, 999 S. Cler-  
mont St. For more information  
call 777-1964 or 373-0489.

The Arrests from page 5  

were released on $53 bail.  
Some of the groups whose  
members participated in the  
civil disobedience action  
were the Alliance for the  
Liberation of Mental Pat-  
ients (Philadelphia), the  
Network Against Psychiatric  
Assault (Berkeley), Project  
Renaissance (Cleveland),  
Oakland Patient Environmen-  
tal Nexus (Pontiac, MI) and  
the Mental Patients Allian-  
ce (Oswego, NY). The 10th  
International Conference  
was organized by a Toronto-  
based group called On Our  
Own, and was attended by a  
number of Canadian as well  
as American individuals and  
groups.

When asked for a statement  

A Once Closed  

In conclusion, I hope that I  
have made two things clear.  
One, that "Judeo-Christian  
Tradition" is a false concept,  
a tricky way to talk about  
Christianity. Second, that  
being Jewish need not pose  
shameful dilemmas for femin-  
ists. Judaism has kept in-  
tact women's forms of worship

after her release, Anne  
Boldt of Berkeley said:  
“Those of us who partici-  
pated in the sit-in were  
survivors of psychiatric  
assault. I was locked up  
and given harmful drugs  
many times over a five year  
period and had no real ch-  
oice about it. Then I had to  
listen to the psychiatrists,  
now they have to listen to  
us. This time I chose to be  
locked up in order to be  
heard."
