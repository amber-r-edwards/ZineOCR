Letters Home to Mama  

Dear BMR,  
As President of DOB, I try to  
read all the women's  

publications that come to the of-  
fice. Your paper is always fine —  
but this month’s was super-  
good. The stuff about class was a  
welcome relief, joy to me. I want  
to thank you all for a good job and  
a really good newspaper.  

If you get a chance and have  
an extra bibliography, Women  
Loving Women from the writer's  
conference, we could really use  
it in our reference material.  

Again my best to you all and  
thank you BMR,  

Barbara Collier.  

Dear Women,  

Got the copy of Big Mama Rag  
today and said, “Well let's see  
what this has to say.” I really en-  
joyed it — it touches on issues  
that are relevant to all women,  
and it brings strength to me and  
I know to my sisters when I show  
it to them. Well, I wanted to tell  
you that instead of simply order-  
ing the publication.  

Yes we would be interested in  
receiving Big Mama Rag on con-  
signment. We send $.30 for  
each copy sold. Also if you have  
back issues we would enjoy  
reading them.  

In sisterhood,

Dear BMR People,  

A very Big-inadequate-but  
nevertheless heartfelt  
“Thanks.” BMR is a major  
happening in my life as I search  
for re-entry into the land of “liv-  
ing” women.  

Please know that your work is  
appreciated.  

Love,  
Jan

Dear Sister Editors,  

It was good to see in your  
newspaper the front page story  
on “A Working Class Perspec-  
tive.” Instead of saying, as so  

many feminists have, that we  

are all women and therefore  
barriers like class and race don’t  
concern us, B.M.R. has chosen  
to deal with class — an issue  
that has, does, and will divide  
women unless we consciously  
labor to overcome it. I have some  
reservations about the analysis  
which I hope you will print as a  
dialogue on this topic in the  
Women's Liberation Movement  
is long overdue.  

In the “Analysis” by the  
editors that went with the story  
of a poor white woman and what  
she has gone through and her  
anger at middle class women the  
editors of B.M.R. say: “Any  
perspective on class issues in  
the feminist movement must  
have as a reference point the

fact that women are oppressed  
first as women and secondarily  
for their class background,  
among other things, such as  
their race or sexual  
preferences.”  

Instead of taking the ground  
that what women’s liberation is  
all about is totally new human  
relations, becoming whole  
human beings, and taking back  
our heads, the editors of B.M.R.  
are saying that poor and Black  

and Latina women must define  

themselves as women first. If we  
have learned anything from the  
formation of groups like the  
National Black Feminist  
Organization or Coalition of  
Labor Union Women it has to be  
that women will define  
themselves as a totality.  

No white woman is going to  
tell a Black woman that she is a  
woman first and then Black. The  
fact is that she is both, a Black  
woman, and she is reminded of  
that fact every day of her life.  
There is no way that a Black  
woman in Boston is not going to  
see her Blackness as something  
that oppresses her as deeply as  
her womanness. To think that  
this means that poor or Black  
women will not fight for  
women’s liberation is not true.  
Not only will they, they have,  
even before Sojourner Truth  
spoke up for women over 100  
years ago.  

Big Mama Rag thinks that  
they are going to solve the class  
division in the women’s libera-  
tion movement by listening to  
the anger of their working class  
sisters. While this is important,  
working class women have  
much more to offer the women’s  
liberation movement than their  
anger. While the WLM is so  
concerned with strategy and tactics  
the passion for a philosophy of  
liberation comes from those who  
have experienced this society in  
all its oppressive dimensions. It  
is poor and Black women who  
will never accept this world as it  
is or try to “make it” by moving to  
the country or starting a  
women's bank.  

Women are a revolutionary  
force and reason and if we only  
accept the anger, the force, of  
working class and Black sisters,  
and not their revolutionary  
reason as well, we will never  
move to a truly new human  
society. Because freedom is a  
totality and because freedom is  
inseparable from self-  
development, this is the only  
way that the barriers between  
women and between other op-  
pressed groups fighting for  
freedom can be overcome.

Dear Sisters,  

Here is $1.50 for the five  
copies we sold of your October  
issue. I feel sure we'll sell others  
because the Bloomington  
women seem to like your fine  
newspaper.  

Your October issue dealing  
with the class issue was very  
helpful to me as I am trying  
harder to examine my (middle  
class) background and get rid of  
those things — those attitudes  
and actions — that oppress and  
alienate women from the work-  
ing class. Reading “Yesterday's  
Lessons” has really been help-  
ful, too.  

I also enjoyed reading  
Chocolate Waters’ “To the Man  
From the Denver Post.”  

Some of my friends were at  
the Lesbian Writers’ Conference  
in Chicago and really liked the  
women they met from BMR.  

I'm real thankful you are  
around.  

In struggle,  

Diana, for

Dear Big Mama,  

Your last two issues (Women  
in Prison, A Feminist Analysis of  
Class) have been excellent. BMR  
has improved so much since the  
issues I first saw about two years  
ago - not only in the quality of  
writing, but in the substance of  
the ideas dealt with, in depth.  
Big Mama Rag seems to have  
moved away from rhetoric and  
toward relevance. Con-  
gratulations for sticking with it  
so long and through so much  
hassle. It’s been worth it.  

In sisterhood,

Dear BMR,  

Having just finished your arti-  
cle on Jill Johnston, I felt com-  
pelled to respond.  

I was very disappointed in the  
article. It came off as a piece of  
heroine worship. Your feelings  
are all well and good, but “frank-  
ly my dear, I don’t give a damn.”  
Since I wasn’t able to travel to  
Boulder to hear her, I was in-  
terested in what had been said,  
etc. I wasn't interested to hear  
that her children had attended,  
that she is semi-famous for a  
number of (semi-) crazy exploits,  
or that the building closed at  
11:30 but people came to hear  
her the next day anyway.  

You spent roughly half the ar-  
ticle in meaningless descriptive  
bullshit. When I came to the part  
where you mention that you  
were more interested in her nice  
personality than the contents of  
her talk, I could, to an extent, un-  
derstand why there was so  
much filler and so little actual
