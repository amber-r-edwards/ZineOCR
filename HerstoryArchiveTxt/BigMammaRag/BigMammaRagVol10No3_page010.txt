Carrying The Power From The Dance

by Calliope

I grew up with a patriarchal
religion, the strong part of my
culture. A daughter to the
preacher caste among the
Mennonite people in eastern
Pennsylvania, the Mennonite sub-
culture was really the only

circles

one I knew. There were no
movies or TV in my childhood,
although enough contact to
know they existed. There were
any number of worldly sins
that kept one from being part
of the accepted community,
and many missionaries and
pressure to conform. And al-
ways a strong sense of being
separate from the prevailing
world. And so a strong sense
of participation in family.

I gained some good from my
learning there - a real sense
of the sacred and holy, a
sometimes example of a shar-
ing community, a belief in
the horror of war, a strong
social conscience, and a feel-
ing of personal participation
in the spirit. On the other
hand, the above came most to
me when I believed their
words and not my reality.
Which was of course manifest
from other of their words.
Words about women being sub-
missive to men, being silent
in church, taking their dir-
ection from God, father and
husband, in that order. The
women were mostly responsible
for the prevention of the
sins of sex. There were
strict rules about what parts
of the body to keep hidden
at all times. So in the years
1968-1971, because I went to
a church high school, I had
to keep my knees covered, and
a separate piece of material
covering my dress over my
breasts, and my hair pinned
up and covered with a net hat.
This while Janis Joplin sang,
mini skirts were in, and pot
was queen. It was another
planet. Except because of the
stance against war, we had
contact with anti-war people.
So we did have a sub-group of
Mennonite high school and
college students who had our
own version of the 60's. But
as my sense of self grew
through that, so did my femi-
nism, and my struggle to love
myself as woman.

I became cynical and de-
pressed. A great anger smol-

dered. The evils done to
women in the name of God
burned across my heart. And
I took the insult personally.
So I stayed far from religion,
and due to the earlier con-
tact, looked to the left for
my community. And quickly
went through the male left to
the lesbian feminist left.

As did many others, but this
is only my story.

So I thought I could go
away from my past, only to
find we all carry it with us.
And what I learned about all
of us is that we are not
whole people. We have exam-
ined our childhood cultures
and found them lacking, but
we haven't replaced them or
changed them in a way that
gives us the strength found
from drawing together.

What I feel about the left
is that we have a lot of peo-
ple who have reached one part
of understanding, but not the

from the Lunatics calendar,

other parts to make a whole.

I believe in a holistic ap-
proach to life and the strug-
gles therein. And so we have
a lot of radical understand-
ing about hunger and sickness,
for example, and how we
shouldn't have to live with
them, but are unable to change
our own knowledges and prac-
tices that are part of the
cause. We have to see our-
selves as part of what needs
to change. We have a radical

understanding of the part
Christianity and organized
religion has played in op-
pressing people, yet we still
think Christmas is the way

to draw together for winter
celebrations. We forget that
all our understandings of his-
tory and economics and gov-
ernment are based on his-
story with all the other parts
of the story lost or left out.
We need to widen our under-
standing of the basis of
radical change.

I do not believe we can
ever just deal with our phy-
sical reality and not our
spirits or vice versa. To do
so is to fall into the patri-
archal trap of separation and
compartmentalization. I be-
lieve we have much work to do
in this world where people
cry. But we have healing as
much as fighting to do. I
support those of us engaged
in the physical struggle on

the fronts. But too often we
only "see" the material, and
we forget about the power of
beliefs, and how involved
they are in creating a reali-
ty. I do not believe we tot-
ally create our own reality
because there is too much
collective reality of oppres-
sion, but we do participate
in life, based on our be-
liefs. We can create the
reality of how we fight.

Our knowledge of the stren-

gth of the patriarchy is a
key to understanding the
power of belief. We all be-
lieved those lies for a long
time. And they only die now as
much as we disbelieve them.
And to do that requires new
strengthening of our spirits.
The book The Spiral Dance
quotes this from Diane Di
Prima,

When we return to the circle

we have won clear.

Return the Dance to the
pulses of the Hunt.

I believe in war dances and
ritual objects for power to
help us in our fight. I be-
lieve in the power of the
earth, and the reminders of
her we can carry with us -

a rock, a shell, a plant wo-
ven into a shirt, a pot made
from clay. The part art has
in our lives is to help us
communicate with our spirits,
and thereby heal and grow.
When I worked politically
with the left, I did not feel
the time to be an artist. The
concept was great - if you
could draw pictures for leaf-
lets, fine, but no time for
the individual process of
creativity. It's taken me a
long time to figure out the
difference between art as the
patriarchal world makes it,
with all the money business,
etc., and art as personal ob-
jects to touch us with our
non-brain selves.

Because of all I have been
required to learn about my-
self, I know that because of
a deep hatred of patriarchy,
and the way it is implemented
to our spirits, we try to
keep out all matters of the
spirit. To do so is to lose
the best parts of ourselves,
and to be less than human.

This is how I learned this
about myself. I was immersed
in "political struggle" and
had no balance for my anger
and pain, and kept myself
working through the whip of
guilt beyond my limits. I
was burned out and pissed off.
One day I was practicing some
poems to read at a coffee
house, and there was one,
“Wild Angels," by Ursula Le
Guin, that I kept reading
over. When I could say it
from memory I did so - shut-
ting out everything else. To
my surprise, it evoked a
flood of feelings in me. I
felt like I was praying for

Spirituality

To The Fight--

the first time in ten years.
Strong negative and positive
feelings came side by side.
I could hear my father's
solemn voice praying in
church. But the sense of awe
and comfort were the strong-
est. My spirit was calling
to me of a deep yearning
need. From there, through the
magazine WomanSpirit, many
books and other women, I
moved forward on the journey
to a feminist, human way of
understanding the earth, her
cycles, my cycles, intuition
and power.

It was a coming home. My
spirit could come out of the
corner I'd slammed it into.
And as this happened, I
found I had to go back to
family and rediscover the
things in me that were formed
and tainted by that particular
patriarchal filter. To take
my loving dyke woman self
back and understand what I
had learned on the way from
there and back. One thing I
learned was that I could re-
late to my family from a more
comfortable place because I
knew the strengths of my be-
liefs, and no longer took in
their criticism of my not
being like them. And that the
ideals of faith and character
in a lot of religions are
good models to strive for,
but somehow we are not able
to love the non-attainment
of perfection as well as its
attainment.

Only now that I am returned
to the women am I beginning
to see things make more sense.
And in so seeing to let go of
the past and believe in our
Power to change. To try to
walk what the Native Ameri-
cans call the sacred red road
of balance. Which is to bal-
ance the spirit self with the
body self and the mind self.
And in the balancing find
strength.

I believe there are non-
physical forces and ways to
fight using them. And we are
fools if we continue to be-
lieve we can beat the forces
of death at their own game.

I believe with all I know
and all I feel that women
have a power among us that
far surpasses any power a-
gainst us. A circle of
witches dancing in the moon-
light, or around the Pentagon
have more power than a thou-
sand guns. Because the guns
are only the power of death.

The Circle Complete

O wild angels of the open hills

Before all legends and before all tears:

O voyagers of where the evening falls

In the vast August of the years:

O half-seen passers of the lonely knolls,
Before all sorrow and before all truth

You were: and you were with me in my youth.

Angels of the shadowed ancient land

That lies yet unenvisioned, without myth,
Return, and silent-winged descend

On the winds that you have voyaged with,
And in the barren evening stand

On the hills of my childhood
Savage, before all sorrow,

in whose silences,
your presence is.

Ursula Le Guin

the dance is the power of
life. The power of belief in
our strength.
WE ARE ALL THERE IS
AND ALL THERE IS
IS ALL WE ARE TO BE

With all of the 20th cen-
tury's larger than life
heroes, we are encouraged to
think of power as an incred-
ible and unusual strength
residing in one body - instead
of sheroes - she-rows winding
around and around and thus
channeling power. Power is
after all, the issue, and
what we're fighting is the
male god of death. And I do
not believe we can fight
death with death. Each of us
has different tasks to do in
this life. Some of us are
witches and psychic healers.
I am a witch, and would like
to try to tell you what I
work for.

The task that we have to do
is to call on the deepest
parts of ourselves to resist
To resist believing and do-
ing what the patriarchy says
is right - in every area of
our lives. To identify the
forces of death, and choose
life, for all of us. To know
that past lives can be future
visions. To believe that we,
as each generation have with-
in us the power to swing the
tide. And to be what we know
human to be, with all of our
immense bravery in its full
beauty.

This article is written
mainly to women, because I
think we have a special po-

wer, but I do not exclude
men from the power to change.
Men who understand the andro-
gyny of the spirit, and res-
pect others' visions. And I
know we require real alli-
ances with different visions
to see us through these times.

I think we need to be more
conscious of our inner selves,
others, the earth, and the
sky. And to build our links
with each other from where
we are in the wheel of the
year, and the cycles of our-
selves. A circle - a linking.
A bowing back of our indivi-
dual backpacks to join in the
chanting murmuring of the
earth. We women carry with
us the secret to life - the
opening to the mother. We've
carried it cloaked and mysti-
fied, and now we carry it with
honor and joy. Secret bearer
from the queen, and She-is-us.

We are the most She-is-us
when we are conscious of our
connection in the circle of
life. We are needing the old
signs and symbols around to
remind us of the spiraling
way of growing. We carry with
us the centuries of pain and
know it is us, along with
joining our power to end it.
We are women, we are the
secret opening. And we are
remembering how to step through.
Leaping the abyss. Believing
we can.

We are now in seed form,
but we are not necessarily a
plant that grows leaf by leaf.
We can burst into full flower
in an instant. But only after

we have learned the art of
leaf by leaf.

And all that a “circle”
gathering does is to remind
us of our power, and to help
us share it. And when we see
our power in each other's
eyes, we have become danger-
ous, but not to ourselves. A
lot of us resist the word god-
dess because of the reminder
of the male god. But we need
to repossess something that was
with us long before patriarchy
took it for its use. I don't
think of a goddess as a great
entity who sits in the sky
and rewards or punishes. I
see it as a way of explaining
our collective entity of the
earth and her people. When we
step outside of our immediate
consciousness, we become
something larger than our-
selves. And we understand
that better if we remember
the old myths and stories of
people everywhere.

The great spirit goddess
is us--the circle complete.
The earth and all she is.
The faeries dancing. Looking
the Shadow square in the eye
and dancing. And then carry-
ing the power from the dance
to the fight against the
Shadow--in whichever of its
many manifestations we choose.
I myself have only glimpses
of our links and of our
power, but have such strong
responses triggered in me
by those glimpses, that I
believe our power ageless
and timeless. Persephone
rising.
