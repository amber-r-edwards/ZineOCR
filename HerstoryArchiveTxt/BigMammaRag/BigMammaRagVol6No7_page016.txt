I want to write this article, not  
as critic, but as poet, lover of  
words, woman. I want to share this  
poetry I hold in my hands: Adrienne  
Rich's newest book of poems, The  
Dream of a Common Language.

No one lives in this room

without confronting the whiteness of  
the wall

behind the poems, planks of books,

photographs of dead heroines.

Without contemplating last and late

the true nature of poetry. The drive

to connect. The dream of a common  
language.

Ours is a political and cultural  
movement that has produced remarkably  
few heroines. To be sure, there are  
well-known women, many of them media  
stars, singled out by the male press  
as worthy of attention, or notorious  
in some fashion. Too, we have silent  
heroines; some are in prison, some are  
women we know privately: our mothers,  
perhaps. We have a few politicians,  
a few athletes, some writers who have  
touched us with their words. But to  
me, Rich is someone special; a woman  
who gathered her poems from the aca-  
demic world of prizes and rewards,  
who turned to embrace women, and to  
share her very best with us.

But there come times - perhaps this  
is one of them -

when we have to take ourselves ser-  
iously on the;

when we have to pull back from the in-

cantations,

rhythms we've moved to thoughtlessly,

and disenthrall ourselves, bestow

ourselves to a silence, or to a deep-  
er listening, cleansed

of monotony, formulas, choruses, lam-  
ents, static

crowding the lines. We cut the wires,

find ourselves in free-fall, as if

our true home were the undimensional

solitudes, the rift

in the Great Nebula.

No one who survives to speak

new language, has avoided this:

the cutting away of an old force that  
held her

rooted to an old ground

the pitch of utter loneliness

where she herself and all creation

seem equally dispersed, weightless,  
her being a cry

to which no echo comes or can ever  
come.

Dream of a Common Language collects  
Rich's poems written between 1974 and  
1977. They include "Twenty-One Love  
Poems" which have been published sep-  
arately by Effie's Press, a feminist  
press. Many of the poems were first  
published in feminist magazines, such

as Amazon Quarterly, Chrysalis, Her-  
esies, Moving Out, Sinister Wisdom,  
and 73rd Moon. The poetry contains a  
continuation of the themes Rich has  
been writing on for years - exposing  
the patriarchy, encountering women,  
integrating the practical and emotion-  
al spheres of ‘women's work', renam-  
ing the world. In a 1975 collection  
of her poetry with criticism (Adrienne  
Rich's Poetry, edited by Barbara  
Charlesworth Gelpi and Albert Gelpi),  
Rich commented:

But to write poetry or fiction, or  
even to think well, is not to fan-  
tazise or to put fantasies on paper.

For a poem to coalesce, for a charac-  
ter or an action to take shape, there  
has to be an imaginative transforma-  
tion of reality which is in no way  
passive. And a certain freedom of  
mind is needed - freedom to press on,  
to enter the currents of your thought  
like a glider pilot, knowing that  
your motion can be sustained, that the  
buoyancy of your attention will not be  
snatched away. Moreover, if the imag-  
ination is to transcend and transform  
experience it has to question, to  
challenge, to conceive of alterna-  
tives, perhaps to the very life you  
are living at that moment. You have  
to be free to play around with the  
notion that "day me make love"  
might be hate; nothing can be too  
sacred for the imagination to turn in-  
to its opposite or to call experimen-  
tally by another name. For uniting is  
renaming. (p. 96)

Renaming has many aspects. In part,  
it means reclaiming our history.  
The Dream of a Common Language begins  
with a section called “Power", and  
includes poems about famous women.  
About Madame Curie she writes, "She  
died a famous woman denying her  
wounds / denying her wounds came from  
the same source as her power."

Section II contains "Twenty-One Love  
Poems" which reads more as one long  
poem. It is a meditation, a thinking  
aloud on love and love between women  
and between two distinct women, on  
separations, and on unities.

If I could let “he know: as  
two women together as a wo:  
nothing in civilization has made  
together as a work  
heroic. in its ordinariness,  
the show picked, halting traverse of

a ch:  
are the fiercest attention becomes

routine  
- look at the faces of those who have  
chosen it.

Finally, in a section called "Not  
Somewhere Else, But Here," Rich ex-  
plores the meaning of the “common  
language." In the most delicate in-  
tegration of abstract ideas and con-  
crete imagery, Rich writes of what  
women have to share in a world of  
common language, a world where death  
is a shared experience, as well as  
life; a world where each woman is  
valued for herself: "two women, eye  
to eye/measuring each other's spirit,  
each other's limitless desire, whole  
new poetry beginning here."

Heresies on Lesbian  
Art and Artists

Constance Perenyi

This is a personal reaction to Her-  
esies: A Feminist Publication on Art  
and Politics. Having just produced its  
fourth issue, the Heresies collective  
has passed a crucial, albeit initial  
test of time. The quarterly is an  
idea-oriented journal devoted to the  
examination of art and politics from  
a feminist perspective; and it plays  
an essential role in the redefinition  
of art for women. The collective  
statement at the beginning of each  
issue explains, "We hope that Heresies  
will stimulate dialogue...encourage  
the writing of the history of femina  
sapiens, and generate new creative  
energies among women."

Each issue is edited by a different  
group, composed of some of the per-  
manent collective members, and open to  
women who are interested in the topic  
at hand. The third volume was devoted  
exclusively to Lesbian Art and Artists  
and was shaped entirely by lesbian  
energy. The editors state, "This issue  
of Heresies arises out of our need to  
challenge the heritage of secrecy,  
silence, and isolation which has been  
a necessity for lesbians who make art."  
They assume the responsibility they  
assign themselves: to vigorously seek  
out and publish lesbian artwork with-  
in a lesbian context.

I am looking at Heresies through  
this issue because it means so much  
to me personally. Initially, I intend-  
ed to review the journal by responding  
intellectually to its quality of aes-  
thetics and content. But, I cannot  
shortchange myself that way: so, in-  
stead, I am opening myself to ideas ~  
which affect me deeply. By drawing on  
several sources, including my own  
journals, I am letting my work talk.

For a time, I almost believed that  
survival would be enough, until I  
realized that art is the need to de-  
fine and redefine within the context  
of my own experience. I do this in  
order to have something to relate to  
in the absence of the content of my  
own experience, of myself. And then,  
I realized that to make my own art  
will mean accepting myself, and to  
accept myself will mean accepting  
other women for themselves; and to  
accept all of us will mean to accept  
art on art's own terms.

By definition, a heresy is a reli-  
gious belief opposed to the orthodox  
doctrines of a church; and a heretic  
is one who professes a heresy by hold-  
ing an opinion opposed to established  
views. As a lesbian, and a feminist,  

I am a heretic; but I grew up learn-  
ing to cross myself with better or  
lesser intentions, a kind of catholic  
personality doctrine. I did it for so  
many years that I had no idea how to  
shrug off the teachings of the church.  
The portrait of the young woman as  
artist-- frustration, self-hate,  
shame. Shame - for being a woman, for  
not being enough of a woman, for not  
being a man, for not being either.

Lesbian artist.  
I wish I had a Lesbian artist button.  
A small black and white button with  
six-point Optima letters.  
Intimate. Women would have to read it  
up close.  
A button for a high-energy ode  
clearly a word that makes me happy.  
It didn't always.

Last fall, Harmony Hammond, a mem-  
ber of the Heresies collective, was  
in Denver. She shared slides of work  
made by lesbians, and talked about  
women's fear of making art. "My work  
process is so painful to me that I  
always need reassurance from other  
women that it's OK, that it's legiti-  
mate." And:

In my personal life the power of  
the combination Lesbian/ feminist/art-  
ist is tremendous. By personal life I  
mean the life I lead in my studio,  
where I take measurements of myself  
and begin to invent hypotheses and  
possibilities based on these measure-  
ments. One way in which the power...  
has manifested itself is in the terror  
that I uncover through painting. I  
can speak very tangibly as though with  
a painting my head had split open and  
something has been birthed from that  
chasm.

Sometimes I think I'm giving birth  
to myself. Other times, I know what  
I'm really doing. I am pulling the  
well-worn carpet of the past from un-  
der my feet and am letting go of words  
that I held as my last possession, my  
first expression. I am embracing my-  
self as a heretic and as an artist.  
Harmony Hammond said, "The commitment  
grows - the work and I. And I am less  
afraid that the work will leave me.”  
And the continuum of reality and ab-  
straction continues circling around,  
chasing each other's defined selves,  
pursuing each other's undefined essence,  
and meeting at a point where each  
ceases to exist, meeting at a  
point where each begins to begin.

The connections between our lives  
and our work must be constructed and  
recognized... It is essential that  
these connections and their powerful  
political ramifications be given cre-  
dence and a loud, loud voice. Despite  
my terror at signing my name to this  
magazine, my convictions are strength-  
ened over and over: the presence of  
Lesbians and Lesbian artists must be  
affirmed. The third issue of Heresies  
is an attempt in this direction. My  
personal dedication is to all Lesbian  
artists who understandably remain bi-  
lent, in hopes that they won't always  
have to.
