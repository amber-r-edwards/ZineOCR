Ongoing Anger  
Dear BMR Readers,

The letter from the three  
Jewish women & your editorial  
policy last month made me  
think about finally coming  
forward with something that  
I've held on to for a long  
time. /

You see, the reason I had  
to leave La Luz (lesbian of  
colour land in Northern Calif  
--now gone) was because the  
Jewish women reclaimed it.

They said they were women  
of colour & couldn't be deni-  
ed access to the land. Which  
means, of course, that as the  
only woman of colour wanting  
to settle there at the time  
this struggle went on--I had  
no control over who came &  
went--though I tried.

They said I oppressed them.  
My lover was Jewish. They sa-  
id I was using my power as a  
woman of colour to manipulate  
her .-. I couldn't take it. I  
asked the white women for  
help.

Of course, I left. But it  
didn't stop. That tribe & th-  
ose women hate me so much for  
holding out 'til the end that  
it was my land & they couldn't  
take it back--that a year la-  
ter a white woman jumped me  
while screaming that I was an-  
ti-semitic & that she was si-  
ck of racist elitist third  
world women using racism as a  
manipulation against Jewish  
women.

I am talking about the tribe  
of women who started open wo-  
men's land with OWL Farm, (Or-  
egon Women's Land.)

I went back to OWL afterwards  
thinking I would be safe  
there but two Jewish separat-  
ists came & started with the  
hate mail, the accusations,  
how I had oppressed their peo-  
ple by not wanting them to re-  
claim La Luz.

"You're Spanish & Christian  
& you've been oppressing me  
for 3,000 years.”

Among other things, awful  
things, the kind of things  
people die for--I thought of  
keeping the letter, knew I  
could get support for it lat-  
er, if things ever changed--  
if people didn't always say I  
had oppressed the Jewish wo-  
men deserved to be punished.

‘That's why they wouldn't  
share their $500.00 a month  
with us (me & my daughter who  
was 4 years old at the time &  
the other woman of colour &  
her lover--the only people on  
the land at the time were the  

six of us.) when the food ran  
out.

We started eating soaked  
soybeans. I sprouted every  
bean in the place. They were  
asked by the only other white  
woman on the land to share  
their resources. They didn't  
want to be communal.

I don't know what to say a-  
bout this. I'm sure the let-  
ter is choppy. I've tried,  
these last few years, not to  
think of my shame & disgrace  
in the tribe.

But now it seems I have to  
think about it. In order to  
redeem myself in some small  
measure, in my own eyes. I  
published my journal & sold  
it through ads in women's pu-  
blications.

It's very choppy because I  
left out a lot--some that I  
didn't dare write about--the  
part about the Jewish women  
challenging me for the land &  
invalidating my every right  
to the land because I am an-  
ti-semitic.

You see, where I lost was  
that I never denied it. I was  
sure, then as now, that I mu-  
st be anti-semitic, because  
I'm an American & it's simply  
part of my culture.

But that's when I started  
to distrust politics because  
in spite of all the racism  
“consciousness” they had it  
perfectly figured out how I  
was wrong & had no rights. A-  
gain. So, you see, that's no  
different than before so I  
left.

Persephone Press just re-  
sponded to my book submission  
by saying the book lacks ana-  
lysis. The reason the book  
lacks analysis is that I was  
afraid if I told the truth,  
the white women, or the Jew-  
ish women, whatever is the  
difference, would have block-  
ed the distribution of the  
book within the feminist pre-  
ss community by saying it was  
anti-semitic.

So I left that part out. or  
at least I didn't call it wh-  
at it was. And I didn't clea-  
rly say what I thought of it.

In other words, I invalida-  
ted myself out of fear of wh-  
at they could do to me. How  
was I to know the time would  
come. Years later, when white  
women would say Jewish women  
are not Third World & don't  
have the right to take our  
land? How was I to know that?  
I hoped.

You see, when the original  
lesbian of color group split  
up (for many reasons) nobody  
wanted to go back there but  
me, and my baby girl. So they  

only had one person to go  
through--me.

I do not say the following  
lightly & I hesitate only for  
fear that the reader who has  
trusted my credibility up 'til  
now will begin to question  
perhaps again, my sanity, at  
least my perceptions.

But I find that life is not  
worth living without truth &  
I have already sacrificed too  
much in the pursuit of safety  
& the prize is empty.

So I say it, now, three,  
perhaps four years later.

I left the tribe because I  
was afraid the white women  
would kill me. Naturally, th-  
ey say I'm crazy & explain  
my madness better than I cla-  
im my sanity but there is no  
doubt in my mind that had I  
stayed & fought to the end--  
I would not be alive today.

Some accident perhaps, a  
freak mishap & everyone sorry  
but understanding.

"Juana was so high-strung.  
Really it was only a matter  
of time--very self-destruc-  
tive woman--what a shame."

But I didn't stay & I did-  
n't die & I wonder at the ab-  
ility of the world to convin-  
ce me so totally that I am  
really not here.

I will go back now & finish  
the book--put back all the  
things I left out.

Much love to you in your  
present work.

Mother’s In Need

(collective note) JuDee is  
involved in a child custody  
case for her two children.  
Since her divorce six years  
ago, the kids were legally  
in her custody. They went to  
visit their father last  
Spring and have not returned  
--they are being kept illeg-  
ally by her ex-husband.  
JuDee is a lesbian, so the  
court case will probably be  
a long one.

Dear Friends:

I am writing to you in  
hopes that you might be able  
to help. I would like to  
know if you could put this  
in your paper. I didn't get  
any results here because the  
Gay people of Phoenix do not  
stand together. I have even  
tried to sell craft items  
that we make, but that didn't  
work either.

I have not been able to  
send my lawyer any money so  
I don't know if or when I'll  
get my kids home. It's very  
sad to be without them at  
Christmas time.

Ruby (my mate) and I have  
been together for six years.  
We are now living in a two  
bedroom apartment with her  
three kids and two grand-  
daughters. We have no heat or  
hot water because the build-  
ing has been condemned, (The  
gas heaters are bad.) We have  
to move but we can't afford  
it. Please tell me, where do  
we turn to now. I know that  
people everywhere are having  
rough times, but this is  
ridiculous.

If you know of anyone that  
could help us in our situat-  
ion please ask them to call  
me at 602-274-6591 or write  
to me. (Address below) We  
will repay anyone that will  
help us as soon as we can.

I could also use some moral  
support. If anyone could  
write to me, I would be so  
grateful. I miss my kids so  
much and it might help to  
know of others in the same  
situation of losing their  
kids because of a lifestyle.

Thank you so much for your  
time.

God bless you and Merry  
Christmas.

Sincerely,

JuDee Waelk
