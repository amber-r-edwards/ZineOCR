UMEJA was conceived in
thought Sept. 16th, my daugh-
ter's birth, because my
child was a birth-defect ba-
by. It gets kind of hard
dealing with children at all
and if the child has birth
defects, or is disabled in
any way, things get tight.
Umeja's primary goal is
geared toward disabled kids —
with a special outreach to
children who are both handi-
capped and also 3rd World. 
It is also aimed at provid-
ing the needed support to
wimmin who are rearing dis-
abled children. Umeja is 4
lesbian wimmin strong. One
has been a director of a
school for the handicapped;
another womon has done exten-
sive work with physically
and emotionally challenged
kids; one womon has had her
children taken from her; I
have a daughter who has
birth defects. Any wimmin
