Women: Don't Work With The Police!!

Women Against Imperialism

During the first two weeks
of September, the San Francisco
police department launched
a major campaign to recruit
women. Store windows across
town displayed big posters
showing the picture of four
smiling policewomen saying
"We're Doing the Job; You Can
Too. Salary: $23,000." This
is part of a major effort by
police departments all over
the U.S. to drastically in-
crease the percent of women
police to 30% by the year
2000. Along with this recrui-
tment campaign, a series of
articles and editorials ap-
peared in local papers, full
of human interest stories
of women breaking through
sex discrimination to become
tough (yet sensitive) police.
But this campaign was not
left unchallenged.

Within days of the appear-
ance of the posters, stickers
were slapped up across them
carrying the message: "WE
DON'T WANT EQUAL RIGHTS TO
BE KILLER COPS -— SUPPORT
BLACK AND CHICANO MEXICANO
LIBERATION STRUGGLES." And
at the opening of the recruit-
ment drive, Women Against Im-
perialism held a demonstra-
tion. The chant “Police Women
- No! Women Freedom Fighters
- Yes!" capsulized the pers-
pective which Women Against
Imperialism brought to the
demonstration: that the lib-
eration of women will be ad-
vanced by women becoming full
participants in the struggle
to destroy imperialism, not
by joining the police who are
the armed enforcers of this
violent and white supremacist
system.

Women Against Imperialism
called for the demonstration
to counter the growing belief
that police recruitment of wo-
men is a progressive develop-
ment that will both help hu-
manize the police and advance
women's liberation. The police
can no more be reformed than
the U.S. army or the KKK. The
principal purpose of the
police is to maintain an order
that is based on controlling
colonized Black, Puerto
Rican, Chicano Mexicano, and
Native American peoples in
the U.S. (just as the purpose
of the U.S. armed forces is
to control colonized people
in other parts of the world).
They are a domestic occupying

army in Third World communi-
ties. For women to work with
the police means becoming
tied more firmly to the very
system that benefits from
our own degraded position.
Our definition of women's
liberation is NOT equal part-
icipation in running this
disgusting and exploitative
system.

One of the key chants dur-
ing the demonstration was
“Women Are Here To Take A
Stand/Against Killer Cops
and the Ku Klux Klan." We
chose this chant to emphasize
the fact that the police
kill hundreds of Third World
people across the country
each year. In Los Angeles a-
lone they average one kill-
ing a week (80% of them are
Black or Mexican). The first
murder of the year was car-
ried out by a woman cop. Only
last month in Long Beach, CA,
the KKK held a public rally
with the message that a cer-
tain amount of violence is
necessary to protect "the Am-
erican way of life." Soon
after the rally, the Long
Beach police shot and killed
a 13-year-old Black child.
These are not isolated inci-
dents, the result of a few
bad apples in the police.
This is genocide!

Comité Contra La Represión
spoke to the demonstration
addressing the question of
how colonialism, violence,
and oppression can be brought
to an end. She said, “Some-
times people think that dem-
onstrations like this don't
really have much impact. We
can't expect immediate re-
sults. But we know that we
can have an impact. Colonial
occupying armies can be de-
feated.

Our Comité, through

the example of National Lib-
eration struggles throughout
the world, has come to learn
about and support prolonged
people's war as the way we
will achieve our liberation
as colonized Chicano Mexic-
anos. Demonstrations like
this begin to organize people
against the police, begin to
educate people as to the role
of the police in our commun-
ities and to support our right
to reclaim our land. This

is occupied Mexico and we
will carry out a people's

war to defeat U.S. imperial-
ism and to establish social-
ism. Our people are uniting
with Puerto Rican people who
are fighting for independence
and socialism, with the Black
nation which is struggling
to liberate New Africa - the
land in the south which Black
people developed and fought
for over hundreds of years,
and we support Native people
who are struggling for sov-
ereignty. Demonstrations like
this play an important part
in this process. It helps
clarify what side people are
on. Those of us here are on
the side of justice, we are
here because we want to be
part of the struggle to cre-
ate a new society and a new
woman and man who together
are committed to struggling
against oppression." Women
Against Imperialism agrees
with this perspective and
believes that it is by parti-
cipation in the strategy be-
ing led by these forces that
white working-class women
and men can contribute to
the struggle.

We are not fooled when the
police come on to us with
catchy "feminist" slogans
like “Women, Take Command of
Your Future: Join the Police"
because we understand that
when women join the police,
they are joining the enemies
of all women. It is the po-
lice who rape colonized women
like JoAnn Little, putting
women on trial when they re-
sist. Police protect the
porn industry, beat up les-
bians, and accuse us of "pro-
voking" men who rape or
batter us.

Women fighting within na-
tional liberation struggles
all over the world are show-
ing us that women's libera-
tion is won by our conscious
participation in the struggle
to defeat this imperialist
system. The way we as women
can really take command of
our futures is by following
the examples of women like
Assata Shakur, a leader of
the Black Liberation Army;
Haydee Torres of the Eleven
Puerto Rican Prisoners of
War; and Judy Clark, a white
anti-imperialist who is one
of the October 20th Freedom
Fighters. In the words of the
representative of the Comité
Contra La Represión: "And
let it be clear - that any-
one who puts on a police
uniform chooses to serve the
U.S. imperialist state. It
doesn't matter if it's a
woman or a Latina or a Black.
A pig is a pig. They know
their role and so do we."

We must oppose police re-
cruitment in our communities
and take our stand on the
other side!
