Purdy: Prison Deaths And Injustices

Willene Clark and
excerpts from No More Cages

On May 31, '82, Toni Holmes,
an inmate at Purdy Treatment
Center For Women (Washington
State Prison), was found dead

washington

in a maximum segregation cell.
Phyllis Richey, also an inmate
in segregation, died eleven
days later.

"Segregation" (or "max"/maxi-
mum segregation or "ag seg"/
administrative segregation)
is a one-story building at
Purdy. Women who have been
busted off parole or work re-
lease are first housed in se-
gregation when they are re-
turned to Purdy. Women that the
guards want to keep under con-
stant surveillance (women who
are depressed or suicidal) are
put in segregation, as are wo-
men who are uppity (women who
have been in fights, women
who refuse to follow orders,
etc.).

For most women, segregation
is punishment. It's a way to
lock you up even more than be-
ing locked upon the "campus"
of the "model treatment cen-
ter" of Purdy. The hourly
check of prisoners in max can
be a form of harassment. No
privacy. You never know when
a guard will come down the
corridor and look inside the
peephole of your cell. You do
not have access to the limited
recreational and educational
resources available at Purdy.
You are let out of your cell
for one hour a day for exer-
cise. The theory is that after
segregation you will be a "bet-
ter prisoner", i.e. you will
be willing to work in the kit-
chen for pennies an hour or
will not talk back to the
staff.

In both the Seattle/King Co-
unty Jail and Purdy, the treat-
ment for emotional turmoil is
usually isolation and often
psychiatric drugs. It seems
that the primary function
of a jail or a prison psychia-
trist is to sign medication
prescription orders. Neither
the jail nor the prison is re-
cognized as being part of

"mental health care sys-
tems".

Since the deaths of Toni
Holmes (Black, lesbian, lower
class and "mentally ill") and
Phyllis Richey (white, with a

history of suicide attempts),
conditions in segregation
have gotten worse. Everything
that could possibly be used
for suicide has been taken
out of the cells, leaving the
women in even more barren
cages. More women have been
checked into the "clinic",
especially those showing signs
of emotional turmoil. There
have been increased room
searches, especially the
rooms of women with a history
of suicide attempts. Women
who lived with Toni and Phyl-
lis in max stated, “We lived
with Toni in max, and some
were closer to her than oth-
ers. We heard Toni's cry for
help, we heard her die back
there. Today's Thursday, 10
days after the death of Toni
Holmes. Phyllis was found
dead in an Ag. Seg. after ap-
parently hanging herself in
the night."

Here at BMR we have receiv-
ed information from an inmate
at Purdy, Willene Clark. She
is writing on behalf of ano-
ther inmate in Ag. Seg. at
Purdy, Anna Schuler. Willene
writes: Anna, 24 years of age,
has been in the women's prison
system for eight years...
After having served over five
years imprisonment, she esca-
ped, via the front door after
a guard secured a ride for
her with a religious group...
apprehended after a year of
freedom, she was returned and
retained in the maximum se-
curity unit where she served an-
other year and subsequently es-
caped by cutting through the
back door of the maximum se-
curity unit, a door also in
the clear view of the guards.
Again she was apprehended and
returned to the general popu-
lation of max security, where
she maintained a nine-month
clear conduct, showing no
signs of violent behavior, nor
did she show an inability to
conform with the rules.

She was issued an infrac-
tion on the "pumped up" charge
of "attempting" to have sexual
misconduct after being discov-
ered in another inmate's cell.

Anna was placed in Ag Seg
for ten days of disciplinary
punishment. Upon concluding
her ten days, she was retained
on this status for pre-hearing

for inmates who show an inabi-
lity or unwillingness to con-
form to the rules, an inmate
who has displayed a chronic
behavior problem and presents
a serious threat to the safety
of staff or inmates through
demonstrated violent behavior."

She is released from her
cell for 60 minutes a day for
personal hygiene, which is usu-
ally a cold shower... it is usu-
ally after midnight, the insti-
tution's hot water supply is
shut off at 10 pm. She is re-
fused a radio and television and
fresh air. For 2 months she has
lived without the knowledge of
world news, current events or
daylight... She is made to visit
with friends and family behind
a closed door, through the
slot of which her meals are
served. Her meals, usually
sparse and inedible, are deliver-
ed in a paper bag on cardboard
utensils...

There were two deaths, ruled
as suicide, in the Ad Seg unit
last year. You may call it
suicide, but the inmates who
were there prefer to call it
emotional assassination, devasta-
ting self-destruction, man-
slaughter and murder, caused
by the staff's negligence of
inmate's emotional conditions.
Anna is the first person to
be referred for "Intensive
Management", there are others
who are being recommended

for such action. We need the
aid of the public to stop this
process of self-destruction.

The conditions in the hole in
Walla Walla are much more hu-
mane than this. We as women
declare at least equal rights
and the same treatment that
the men in prison receive...
Even death row has better con-
ditions than Anna is now
receiving.

We would like support to
enable some sort of change in
her living conditions. Thank
you, please respond. When you
respond to this letter, please
send a response to me, Willene
Clark, and also to Anna Schu-
ler. Box 17, Gig Harbor, Wash.

I will continue to fight.
