equally in agricultural la-
bor it was inevitable women
would be involved.

The first action made it
clear that without women's
participation the struggle

would not get off the ground.

At harvest time, instead of

taking the grain to the Math,
it would be brought to the
villages. Since harvesting
is chiefly a women's job,
those who went to perform
this task were women. They
were surrounded by the hired
ruffians and musclemen of
the Math with their big

lathis. The fundamental prin-

ciple of the struggle was
to remain non-violent--they

would stand as a moral force.

In this case, the commitment
to stay non-violent rendered
the lathis ineffective. Be-
cause only if you come into
a clash can the sticks be
used. The first round was
very successful and gave an
enormous fillip to the whole
movement.

When some of the women
activists tried to raise
the issues of alcoholism
and wife-beating, there was
enormous resistance. At one
meeting, the women decided
men should share the house-
work because unless men
shared in the housework, the
women would not find the
time to be active. The ac-
tivists related how one
woman went home and said
to her husband, “After to-
night you'd better pick up
your plate after the meal"
and she got such a massive
thrashing. Many women were
beaten that same night for
similar "provocations.”

The next morning the child-
ren brought the news, no
longer was it a private
issue, but it was a public
issue and an issue for the
organisation. At a meeting
they decided that men who

beat their wives should
be socially boycotted. Sim-
ilarly with drunkenness
because it often leads to
wife beating, and at many
of the meetings, the men
came drunk. So anti-liquor
campaigns were launched in
several villages. Children
would be the reporters.
"Oh in that home they're
brewing liquor." They would
say, "My father beat up
my mother last night." It
was no more possible to
keep it hushed up. So a
group of women would go to
the home where the liquor
was brewed, break the li-
quor pots, confiscate the
materials used for brewing
liquor and auction them.
If a man beat a woman, no-
body would speak to him
for a number of days, they

would not accept food from
him, nor would they offer
him food or water.

In other places women
would organise night pat-
rols. Fifty or so would
go up and down the streets
with wooden baskets used
as helmets to protect
themselves from attack. If
they found a man coming
home drunk they would de-
mand a fine, and if he re-

fused they would keep him
in a community hall and
insist on his paying a
fine.

At the same time repres-
sion from the unrest was
growing. People were ar-
rested on trumped up charg-
es, there were physical
threats, beatings, people
actually killed. At one
stage of the struggle, the
Math landowners hired la-
bourers from outside to
come and plough the land
the landless poor identi-
fied as their own. When
these hired ruffians tried
to plough the land, child-
ren would spread themselves
like a white sheet
on the field and prevent
the ploughing. Meanwhile
the villagers would un-
yoke the bullocks.

At the time of the next
harvest, the people them-
selves ploughed the fields
despite repression. The
Math owners didn't stop
them ploughing because they
didn't care who ploughed
as long as they got the
harvest. At the time of
the harvest police and the
military came in.

Between 1980 and 1982
this movement experienced
severe repressions after
the Congress party returned

to power--guns, beatings,
arrests on trumped up charg-
es of fraud, loot and mur-
der. It was observed that
the more the repression,
the more the participation
of women. When there is
brutal repression then ev-
ery drop of your blood, ev-
ery resource that you have
in your family, has to be
utilised, to get through
that phase. Also where

there is repression some of
the ties that bind women
to domesticity begin to
break down. When you have
to face guns, it's nice to
have women around, they
are usually better at tak-
ing the bullets. In other
struggles it has been found
that when police enter the
villages and rape, men us-
ually run away to the for-
est and women and children
are left to hold the fort.
Finally, the movement
was able to force the gov-
ernment to distribute some
land among the landless
poor. It identified 1000

acres as illegal holdings
although the rural poor
had identified 3000 acres.
Now this is where the most
important part of the wom-
en's struggle came. As with
all such land reforms, the
government started distrib-
uting land to heads of fam-
ilies, assumed to be men.
Some of the women activists
intervened and the landless
poor women of the area

forced the stoppage of the
land redistribution saying,
we both shed blood but sud-
denly you have become land-
owners and we have become
your dependents.
