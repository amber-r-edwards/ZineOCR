The history of the west has largely  
been written by men with a distinct  
male perspective. Tamsen Donner: a  
woman's journey is the poetic re-  
creation of one woman's passage  
west, and it is very special.  

With a grant from the National En-  
dowment, Ruth Whitman traveled across  
the country repeating the ill-fated  
Donner trail. Combining historical  
research with poetic license, Whit-  
man wrote the journal that Tamsen  
Donner might have written herself.  

“When I began writing Tamsen Don-  
ner's lost journal, I did not know  
who I was writing about; only that  
I was writing in the person of a  
pioneer woman in the mid-nineteenth  
century, who was approaching a last  
range of mountains in the western  
part of the continent. When I fi-  
nally identified her by name, I re-  
cognized her immediately as though  
she were someone I had known."  

The Donner name is famous (or  
infamous) in western lore. Under the  
leadership of George Donner, a group  
of emigrants left Illinois in 1846  
for California. Most were never to  
arrive. Following an untraveled  
route across the Wasatch Mountains,  
miscalculating the time to cross the  
Salt Desert, they were in the Sierras  
a scant one hundred miles from the  
Sacramento valley when they were  
caught in a series of blizzards that  
left them snowed in for six months.  
Many resorted to cannibalism. Some  
who were able to walk were brought  
out by rescue parties. Tamsen Donner  
sent her children out, but stayed  
with her dying husband. Her body  
was never found.  

Out of such a dramatic story, a  
lovely work of poetry and prose has  
been drawn.

what else can I part with?  
I will keep one Sketchbook one

to see me to the end of the journey  

go Light  
go Light  
I must walk Lightly  

Alternating prose and poetry, the  
book is notable for its musing un-  
derstatement. At every point, Whit-  
man shuns the dramatic use of im-  
agery and language to let the story  
quietly flow, as journals often do.  
Still, there is a natural momentum,  
as the prairies which seemed like  
oceans to an eye still longing for  
New England, gives way to mountains,  
called by the familiar: "a city/  
of stony mountains/ under a roof of  
snow." In the desert, dreaming of  
water, she writes, “let gray be-  
hemoths of rain/ enter and flood my  
valleys." Near her death in the  
Sierra's, she concludes:  

If my boundary stops here  

I have daughters to draw new maps  

on the world  

they will draw the lines of my  

face  

they will draw my gestures my  

voice  

they will speak my words thinking  

they have invented them  

they will invent them  
they will invent me  
I will be planted again and again  
I will wake in the eyes of their  
children's children  
they will speak my words.

Non-Sexist Books for Children  

Fran Day  

Woman to Woman Feminist Bookcenter  
is expanding our collection of chil-  
dren's books. We have nonsexist, non-  
racist picture books and young fic-  
tion.  

Children's conceptions of themselves  
and their world are greatly influ-  
enced by the books they read. Sex-  
role stereotyping restricts children's  
perceptions of what they and others  
can do, feel, and become. The rigid  
sex roles depicted in most children's  
books - active, independent male  
characters and passive, dependent fe-  
male characters - are detrimental to  
the healthy development of young  
readers of both sexes. We have se-  
lected books which specifically  
challenge existing stereotypes; our  
books feature girls in strong, active  
roles and boys in sensitive, gentle  
roles. Also since the ratio of books  
about boys to books about girls is  
nearly four to one in the children's  
literature field today, most of our  
books feature girls as the main char-  
acter.  

I'm Like Me: Poems for People Who Want  
to Grow Up Equal  

Siv Widerberg  

illustrated by Claes Backstrom  
translated from Swedish by V. Moberg  
Feminist Press, 1973  

$2.75/paper, for ages 7-15  

This is a children's book of un-  
conventional poems that deal with  
topics that really concern kids -  
divorce, dirty words, dreams, grow-  
ing up with friends. Siv Widerberg  
candidly and humorously combines  
imagination and art to debunk the  
damaging myths we are fed as children.  

Nothing But a Dog  
Bobbi Katz  
illustrated by Esther Gilman  
Feminist Press, 1972  
$2.50/paper, for ages 3-10  

This is an irresistible book about  
an active girl who flies kites, builds  
things, and is vice-president of  
the tree-climbing club but longs for  
a dog. It is refreshing to see this  
kind of vital, initiative-taking  
young female that is so conspi-  
cuously missing in most children's  
books.  

What? Another Closet?  

The Women of L.U.L.N.J.A.  

Drinking is part of the “Amerikan  
way," and we think it's time to que-  
stion it, along with many of the  
other elements we're questioning in  
our culture. Very little research  
has been done on the incidence of  
alcoholism among minorities, women,  
and gays. It has been estimated,  
however, that one in three lesbians  
is an alcoholic. We'd like you to  
think about alcoholism, talk about  
it with your friends and begin to  
look at the damage it's doing to  
many of our lives.  

Until recently, concern for the  
treatment of women alcoholics has  
been minimal. Even less attention  
has been directed to the particular  
needs of the lesbian alcoholic.  
Within our community, drinking has  
been uncritically accepted for too  
long as something “everyone does."  
For many of us drinking has become  
dangerous and destructive, to the  
point of being detrimental to our  
entire lives.  

In addition to developing a gen-  
eral awareness of the effects of  
alcoholism on our own lives and  
the lives of other women, we need  
to actively take steps to support  
sobriety. For some of us, drink-  
ing is lethal and our sobriety is  
a state of being which we fought  
hard to acquire. We need your sup-  
port to help us maintain our so-  
briety.  

You can help us by taking the  
issue of alcoholism seriously -  
by taking a woman seriously when  
she tells you, "I am an alcoholic."  
To be able to make that  
statement, a woman must go through  
a lengthy process of developing  
awareness and acceptance of her-  
self. Take that process seriously,  
and give all the support you can  
to any woman who is dealing with it  
either as a recovering alcoholic or  
as a lover and/or supporter of an  
alcoholic.  

For many of us it took years to  
be able to accept the fact that we  
are alcoholics and sometimes, just  
as long to begin doing something  
about it. Once a woman makes that  
statement, the last thing she needs  
is to have someone close to her not  
take it seriously. By minimizing  
the importance of what the state-  
ment "I am an alcoholic" means,  
you may well be contributing to  
that woman's continued drinking.  

As alcoholics, we drink be-  
cause we choose to drink. However,  
as friends, lovers, and supporters,  
you can make a major difference in  
our continued resolve not to drink.  
Don't "assume" that every woman at  
the bar or at a party is someone  
who can safely drink. When you find  
a woman who says she can't, accept  
her where she's at in her sobriety  
and don't stigmatize her by ma-  

king an issue of the fact that she  
doesn't want a drink.  

Within the last couple of years,  
we have been aware of a hopeful  
development - there are now some par-  
ties and functions at which alcohol  
either is not served or, at least,  
where some beverage in addition to  
alcohol is being served. We ap-  
preciate this kind of sensitivity  
and feel that, in many ways,  
alcohol-free social situations may be a  
good thing for us all.  

We as alcoholics are highly a-  
dept at the guilt-trip game. We do  
it to ourselves all the time and we  
think it is not helpful to lay add-  
itional guilt trips on a recovering  
alcoholic, or on yourself as a  
lover or supporter of an alcoholic.  
There may be times in the recovery  
process when a woman drinks again.  
A "slip" shouldn't be treated as  
the end of the world and certainly  
not as the end of the recovery pro-  
cess. A slip might even be useful  
in the sense that it would show a  
woman that she, in fact, can't  
drink non-alcoholically.  

We think the recovery process is  
likely to be most successful if a  
woman can begin replacing her old  
habits (not dealing with feelings,  
problems, people) with new ways of  
approaching her life. In some cases,  
this means giving up certain  
friends, not going to the bar for a  
while, taking up some kind of phy-  
sical exercise, joining a rap group  
and, generally, beginning to take  
responsibility for herself, as well  
as allowing time to nurture herself.  

Recovery seems to be much easier  
when it is shared with other women  
who are in a similar place. Although  
our stories differ, there seems to  

be no end to the "aha, I know ex-  
actly what you're talking about"  
experience in a group discussion.  

In the process of open discussion,  
we're also benefitting from the in-  
sights which other alcoholics or  
lovers and supporters may have  
which are new to us. We've found it  
especially helpful to have a group  
in which both alcoholics and sup-  
porters participate. For many of us,  
seeing "it from a lover's perspec-  
tive” can be quite an unsettling but  
equally valuable experience.  

We hope you will join with us in  
creating a new awareness of alcho-  
holism among all of us. We don't  
have "the cure” and we certainly  
don't have an established set of  
"answers." What we do have is an  
abundant supply of caring and sup-  
port which we want to share openly.  
Getting educated about alcoholism  
is a process which takes time and  
commitment. So is getting sober.  
Maintaining our sobriety is like-  
wise an ongoing process and, like  
many experiences in our lives, feels  
good when it is shared.
