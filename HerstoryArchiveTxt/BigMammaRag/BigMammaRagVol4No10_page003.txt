Strokes

Friends at BMR,  
I recently came into some money  

which I want to share to help support  
things I feel good about.  

I hope you all are doing an excellent job  

of providing information to feminists  

in the Rocky Mountain area. BMR is  

the only newspaper I ever read these  

days.  
Good luck to you.  
Sincerely,  
Nancy  

Lollipop Power  

Dear Sisters,  
Lollipop Power, Inc. is a feminist  

collective that has published non-sex-  
ist children's books since 1971. We  
also do our own printing and distribu-  
tion. The books we have published so  
far are picture or early-reading books  
for children ages 2-9, but we are open  
to the possibility of publishing mater-  
ial for older children as well.  

Our books have always had as goals  
the combating of sex stereotypes in  
children's ideas of female and male  
roles and behavior, the depiction of a  
variety of family types and childcare  
situations, and the representation of  
racial and cultural minorities. Be-  
cause large publishers are now begin-  
ning to incorporate some of our goals  
into their books, we are searching for  
manuscripts to meet specific needs  
which continue to exist:  

--strong female protagonists, espec-  
ially Black, Spanish-American, and Na-  
tive-American girls and women or stor-  
ies set in third world nations  

--friendship and solidarity among  
girls and women  

--non-traditional family situations:  
e.g., single mothers; families living  
together; extended families; women  
living with children;  

--non-heterosexist values: e.g.,  
children and lesbian mothers; early  
childhood sex-education materials  

--females who are struggling to  
CHARGE VALUES AND DEH AMID Reem oom rns.  

The books we have published have

Credit Union  

Dear Sisters,  

This is in response to the art-  
icle/statement of purpose (it's  
unclear to me which it is) of the  
Colorado Feminist Federal Credit  
Union. First, I would like to em-  
phasize that though I am a former  
member of the board of the Massachu-  
setts Feminist Federal Credit Union,  
I am not now representing that org-  
anization. I do support feminist  
credit unions, specifically, and the  
concept of self-help embodied in cred-  
it unions, generally.  

There are some points in the art-  
icle which I wish to take issue with:  
1) To state that the Colorado Fem-  

inist Federal Credit Union is the  
first feminist credit union to con-  
front the contradictions in operat-  
ing both within a capitalist struc-  
ture and within an anti-movement is  

an outrageous, self-righteous assump-  
tion. I say this from my own exper-  
ience.  

2) The Colorado FFCU “is committed  
to providing services to the credit  
union members ‘without regard to  
race, creed, color, national origin,  
sex, marital status, sexual prefer-  
ence, ancestry, or handicap'"...the

sion."  
feminist"  

While the designation "fem-  
may indicate an affinity  
group, it does no more than that.  
Credit union services cannot be  
limited to or favor a feminist com-  
munity, legally or ethically.  

3) "Special consideration will be  
given to women working actively in  
the feminist movement." To reward  
political belief and action with  
monetary privilege is either fatal-  
ly naive, or downright Orwellian;  
it invites opportunism and politi-  
cal dishonesty of the most destruc-  
tive sort. By this policy members  
of the credit union staff, board,  
credit or supervisory committees  
would be able to obtain loans more  
easily than other women. In addi-  
tion, it ignores the fact that many  
women cannot, for reasons other  
than lack of political awareness,  
afford to put in 40 hours a month  
(10 hours a week...a lot of time  
on top of 40 hours of work) for  
feminist activity.  

4) The credit union does not have  
to charge 12% interest once it is  
breaking even. It cannot also de-  
clare an interest refund without  
paying a dividend. So the goal of  
paying no dividend is not possible.  

5) Having been a board member, I  
am fully aware that there are times  
when a meeting closed to general  
members is necessary; however, the  
board is accountable to credit un-  
ion members for all decisions. It  
hardly seems in keeping with that  
spirit of accountability so strongly  
expressed in the BMR article to re-  
quire advance notice of a member's  
presence at a meeting. It is fairer  
to have closed meetings as neces-  
sary.  

Feminist credit unions are attemp-  
ting a difficult balancing act; and  
the character of each credit union  
will reflect the interests and needs  
of the community around it. The  
credit union can function effective-  
ly only when and if it is able to  
respond to those needs. Credit un-

To reply point by point:  

1) In making this statement, I was  
thinking specifically of the CFFCU's  
low dividend/interest refund policy,  
which is intended to confront the  
said contradictions in terms of  
hard cash, I know of no other cre-  
dit union, feminist or otherwise,  
which has enacted any such policy.  

Outside of this context, however,  
you're right: the statement is self-  
righteous. I should have been more  
specific.  

2) The Credit Union is legally  
bound to limit its services to a  
feminist community, since feminism  
constitutes the common bond of its  
membership.  

I don't really understand your  
question: I get the feeling that  
you're asking something else, but  
I can't figure out what.  

3) The idea is not to "reward pol-  
itical belief and action with mone-  
tary privilege," but to offer some  
compensation to those who often  
make sacrifices in order to work  
as feminists.  

I am informed that Credit Union  

loan applications are rou-  
tinely much more carefully scrutin-  

run by women  
owned by women
