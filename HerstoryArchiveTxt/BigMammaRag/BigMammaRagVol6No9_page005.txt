A survey by the editor of the Year-  
book of American and Canadian  
churches revealed that 76 of 211  
Christian church bodies have or-  
dained women.  

10,500 women are ordained in  
the full ministry (they comprise 4%  
of the total clergy force). More than  
one-fourth of the women clergy  
have been ordained by the Salva-  
tion Army, and women account for  
40% of seminary enrollments.

The Spirit of  
Houston  

A comprehensive picture of how far  
behind American women are in  
their goal of equality emerges from  
The Spirit of Houston, the 308-  
page, illustrated, official report  

of the National Commission on the  
Observance of International  
Women’s Year, which has just  
been published.  

The report, submitted to Presi-  
dent Carter and Congress with a  
plea for ‘‘prompt and positive  
action,’’ includes the text of the 26-  
plank National Plan of Action  
adopted by several thousand  
delegates to the first Federally-  
funded National Women’s Confer-  
ence last November, factual back-  
ground reports on each plank;  
narrative descriptions by author  
Caroline Bird of the Houston con-  
ference and the 56 state and  
territorial meetings that preceded  
it; a chronology of American  

| women’s history; several hundred  

photos by Diana Mara Henry, Pat  
Field and other women photo-  
graphers; and extensive other  
material.

‘*Family  
Disputes”’  

A suit brought by twelve battered  
women against New York City’s  
Family Court and Probation De-  
partment has been dismissed by  
the New York State Appellate  
Court.  

The suit charged that the Fam-  
ily Court denied the twelve women  
— who claimed their husbands  
beat them regularly — access to  
judges who could have issued  
restraining orders against the hus-  
bands.  

The Appellate Division ruled,  
however, that the women did not  
have a case against the Family  
Court and overturned a previous  
decision which had granted them  
permission to sue the Family Court  
and Probation Department.  

An earlier suit, filed by the  
same 12 women, had charged that  
New York City police refused to  
arrest their husbands, despite evi-  
dence of beatings. Police had  
claimed that they couldn’t interfere  
in “family disputes.”  

That suit ended in an out-of-  
court agreement by police to arrest  
wife-beaters.  

Attorneys for the 12 women say  
they will appeal the latest ruling to  
the New York Court of Appeals.

Librarians  
Organize  

On August 11, 1978 the profession-  
al librarians at the Mugar Memor-  
ial Library at Boston University  
voted 11-7 for representation by  
Local 925, Service Employees In-  
ternational Union, AFL-CIO. The  
B.U. librarians join the Brandeis  
University librarians, represented  

by Local 925 since 1976, thus be-  
coming the second group of private  
academic librarians in the Boston  
area to successfully seek collective  
bargaining rights.  

‘The librarians hope to use col-  
lective bargaining to improve salar-  
ies and benefits as well as to fur-  
ther professional concerns,”’ com-  
mented Jackie Ruff, Local 925 Rep-  
resentative.  

Union organizing began in Nov-  
ember 1977 when the librarians  
first requested a vote but the Univ-  
ersity created legal obstacles which  
postponed the vote by ten months.  
The librarians union is part of the  
trend toward collective bargaining  
at B.U. where the faculty have  
begun contract negotiations and  
where the clericals recently voted  
to unionize.
