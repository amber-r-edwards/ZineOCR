Political Womanpower: Some Colorado Candidates ...

controllable budget is de-
fense, of which only 5% is for
strategic weapons).

Other political concerns
which do not receive adequate
attention in the “men’s club”
of the United States Congress
include children and the aged.
“Children are our most impor-
tant natural resource,” Repre-
sentative Schroeder stated,
but they appear in the budget

only when legislation is
enacted to control juvenile
delinquency.

Concerning the possibility
of governmental subsidizing
of day care centers, Repre-
sentative Schroeder suggests
giving tax incentives to
corporations to set up day
care centers for their employ-
ees’ children. She said, “we
might be able to get this
through because it won’t take
any funds.”

According to a study
conducted by Ralph Nader,
white women over 65 are the
poorest segment of the
population. In a question and
answer period which extended
after the general meeting
adjourned, Ms. Schroeder
stated that the Ford Founda-
tion has allocated funds for
grocery stores on wheels
which will allow the aged to
purchase groceries at home.

We're on the verge of trying
to get different kinds of
people in Congress, she said.
As an example, Wilbur Mills
has a 30-year-old woman
running against him. But we
have a long way to go getting
women into responsible gov-
ernment positions. Out of six
Nixon nominees to the Su-
preme Court there were no
women; there is no woman in
the Cabinet; no woman in the
Senate and only sixteen
women in The House of
Representatives. Representa-
tive Schroeder said she often
tells her colleagues that “a
stag Senate is a stag nation.”

Press releases from the
Nixon Administration praise
the number of women hired
for government service. Re-
presentative Schroeder added,
“this is a phenomenal record—
more than we've ever had
before,” but she explained
sarcastically the increase
means that of 12,000 govern-
mental positions, 118 are
filled by women (less than
1%). Of those having a GS 13
rating, only 4% are women;
yet, the GS 1 through GS 6
ratings are 70% women. "This
is no great sterling example.”

Pat Schroeder stated that
the nation is watching Denver,
because Denver has demon-
strated the effectiveness of
the grassroots movement, in
challenging the Olympics, re-
moving nerve gas, and, in
electing a woman whose
campaign was based on the
value of the individual. “We
can't let people get crushed,”
Ms. Schroeder affirmed.

Representative Schroeder
emphatically pointed out that,
“there is no bill that doesn't
affect women. Legislation
affecting the tax code, Social
Security and military benefits
all apply to women. “We are
53% of the population. I am
tired of women apologizing
for being women,” she said.

Pat Schroeder was at home
among friends that evening.

Peggy Sanbourne, R-House
District 35 - sees a “need” for
child care but does not think
that it should be completely
free but cost should be on a
graduated scale; thinks that
closing down the Women’s
Prison needs more study and
that there would have to be “a
suitable alternative” maybe a
half-way house in Denver;
feels that there is a “vast field
of education that needs to be
done on rape” and that the
proposals need to be looked
into; “I’ve always been known
to be a very fair individual,”
says Sanbourne. “I believe
there are important values for
America and Colorado that are
best expressed in a Republi-
can political philosophy: that
without emphasis on financial
responsibility, personal own-
ership of the means of
production, traditional values
in education, and homage to
God within the family circle
there can ultimately be no
family, no knowledge, no
production and no nation.”

Arie Taylor, D-House District
7 - Definitely supports state
funding for comprehensive
child care facilities; believes
that cost should be based on
ability to pay for all parents;
supports the right for every
woman to decide whether to
have a child or not; thinks
that the Women’s Penitentiary

should be closed and women

returned to metro Denver
where they can be near their
families; supports including
pregnancy and pregnancy-re-
lated problems under the
scope of unemployment com-
pensation; supports “most”
of the rape reform proposals,
“but some need strengthening.” Taylor is a people-oriented
representative and is a
strong supporter of a consu-
mer rights bill that will keep
the “consumer from getting
ripped off.”

Sarah Masterson, R-House
District 28 - Masterson does
not want the state to fund
child care but thinks that
businesses should be encour-
aged to do it on their own;
parents should pay for the
cost of child care because
“when responsibility is taken
away from people to pay it’s
bad. The state should work
through free enterprise. The
candidate does not want to
get embroiled in the abortion
controversy, but concedes
that “there are many cases
where abortion is the only
answer. I’m not going to sit in
judgment - I'm not eager to
fight the Supreme Court.
Masterson supports state
funding of family planning;
and believes that the penalty
for rape should be the “same
penalty as for premeditated
murder,” and that the rape
reform proposals will proba-
bly help to clean up the
ambiguous prosecution sur-
rounding rape.

Barbara Holme, D-State Sen-
ate District 5 - supports fully
state funding for comprehen-
sive child care facilities with a
sliding scale, with fees
increasing as the family
income rises. “To improve
child care in my district I
would like to encourage
businesses, churches, tem-
ples, and schools to operate
or at least provide space for
child care facilities. I whole-
heartedly support the Equal
Rights Amendment and the
Supreme Court's decision in
Roe v. Wade (which allowed
women the freedom to decide
whether or not to bear
children). Feminist task for-
ces should make every at-
tempt to achieve quick ratifi-
cation of ERA. Any attempt to
amend the Constitution to
limit a woman's right to
decide whether to bear child-
ren should be opposed.
Should such an amendment
be passed by Congress, it is
important to have strong
legislators in every state
refuse it ratification. I would,
of course, oppose ratification
of such an amendment.
Holme supports state funding
of family planning since
“voluntary family planning
prevents unwanted pregnan-
cies, prevents the need for
abortion and is the most
effective government program
per dollar spent; favors
improving our jails and
prisons and hesitates “to add
any more facilities to the
Denver metro area while
growth here remains so
uncontrolled; believes the
“unemployment compensa-
tion is primarily for those who
become involuntarily unem-
ployed. With birth control,
most pregnancy is voluntary
and the associated costs,
except for the poor, should be
borne by the families;”
supports all the rape prosecu-
tion reform proposals.

Pat Burrows, D-House District
52 - “I support state funding of
child care facilities. I support
state support of a study
looking into the feasibility of
on-site facilities, jointly sup-
ported by industry and go-
vernment. I believe alternative

Coven Gets Revenge; Ames, Iowa-- When Iowa State University
lent its facilities to the Miss Iowa Beauty Pageant two years ago,
the Women's Coalition sought the help of a local witch coven -
DARC, the Des Moines Ames Radical Coven. It hexed the
pageant and its supporters, and the television station, KDIN. Within
an hour KDIN suffered a power failure. Part of the hex involved
laying a curse on ground earmarked for a football stadium. A
substantial portion of the construction was complete when lo! it
began to tilt and sink slowly into the ground. Barbara X of DARC
expressed surprise that it had taken so long. She said the coven is
willing to remove the hex in return for a 7.4 million dollar child
care center to be built in its place. (Off Our Backs, Aug-Sep. 74)

Widening Gap Reported in Earnings-- According to the latest
consumer income survey of the US Bureau of the Census, the
income of a typical full-time woman worker employed year-round
in '73 was $6,490- or 57% of her male counterpart in the work
force. The gap between the sexes has thus widened and was three
percentage points bigger in '73 than it was in '71. (The
Spokeswoman, Aug. 15, 74)

INDYKEMENT of Ms. Magazine-- “On behalf of six million Lesbian
women and hundreds of thousands of women-identified
Feminists in the USA...the Lesbian Tide magazine charges Ms.
magazine with: Gross neglect and psychic genocide against
Lesbian women, sexist and heterosexist representation of
women, and perpetuating anti-feminist attitudes and politics...”
The Tide went on to point out that in two years of publishing, Ms.
“has published 5 out of 505 major articles (.99%) by Lesbians
about Lesbians’ lives and needs; has printed 9 out of 537 letters
(1.7%) by, about, or relating to Lesbian women; has employed
one active, public Lesbian on its editorial staff; has printed
innumerable ads which consistently portray women in exclusive
relationship to men, in fashion model imagery and in
professional, classist roles." Also noting that Ms. is owned by a
male corporation, the Tide went on to resolve “that until Ms.
re-evaluates and begins to adequately represent the politics and
lifestyles of Lesbian radical Feminists, we the Lesbian Nation
cancel our subscription and support of a magazine whose pages
have canceled our reality.” (The Lesbian Tide, Aug, 74)

How to Avoid Rape!-- “Don't go out without clothes, that
encourages men. Don’t go out with clothes, any clothes
encourage some men...Avoid childhood, some rapists are turned
on by the very young. Avoid old age, some rapists inflict
themselves on older women...Don't have a father, grandfather,
uncle, or brother, these are the relatives who most often rape
young women. Don't marry, rape is legal within marriage. To be
quite sure, don't exist!” (Saskatoon WL Newsletter, July, 74)

Shameless Gossip-- It has recently been reported that an avid fan
of BMR distributed papers in all the gas station women’s
restrooms from Denver to points East. (Talk about grassroots
organizing!) Someone else said that the restrooms were a
good place for the papers.
