Keeping In Touch

Dear BMR:

This is in answer to your
postcard asking if I've been
receiving the paper. Yes, I
have, and I have found it
most interesting. I learn a
lot from your articles and
I hope you can keep up the
good work. I am grateful for
my subscription. I will no-
tify you if I am released,
but I will probably be here
for at least another year.

I am hoping you'll have an
article about the Chicana
women and also about how

the Crusade for Justice is
doing. Corky Gonzales sent
a letter of support to me

at the time of my sentencing
which meant a lot to me. I
have been down for almost a
year now and rely on papers
like yours to stay informed
of what our people are do-
ing to stay together and
take up the challenges of
the 80's. During the 60's
the Crusade played a very
strong and principled role
building opposition to
as well as develop-

Last month, we failed
to credit Connexions, An
International Women's
Quarterly, 4228 Telegraph
Ave., Oakland, CA 94609,
properly. We reprinted
"Women In Ireland At War:
Fighting Back Against The
Armed Patriarch" from
them. Connexions prints
translations of news-
papers and magazines from
all over the world and is
available for $10 a year.

However, since I've been out
of touch for a while, I am
uninformed as to what direc-
tions the work has gone in
and the areas of work being
taken up by Chicana women.
I recently read This Bridge
Called My Back--Writings by
Radical Women of Color
which I found most fascina-
ting and challenging. It
pushed me to really try to
use this time to educate
myself more thoroughly on
the concerns of third world
women. Since Bedford--where
I am in prison--is 75% Black
and Puerto Rican, I have
many sisters here with whom
I am sharing and learning.
We do not let the cruelties
and stupidities of this
place break our spirits. We
are well aware that our sis-
ters on the streets are al-
so struggling to survive,
and to get that little extra
mental and physical space
to build the forces of op-
position and renewal. Your
paper is a valuable resource
in helping in that process.
Thanks again, and I look
forward to the next issue.

{collective note: the post
card Cathy refers to is one
that we sent to all our sub-
scribers in prison asking
them if they were receiving
the paper regularly and in-
viting them to contribute
articles or graphics. BMR is
sent free to all prisoners
and mental patients. We will
be publishing a theme issue
on Incarceration and Women
in Prisons sometime early
next year.)

Forgotten Sisters

Dear BMR:

I have had a need to express
myself to other sisters invol-
ved in the struggle to gain
equal dignity. Why does it
seem that my sisters in the
movement have forgotten the
lost souls in prison? So many
women are here because of sex-
ism practiced by juries and
judges all over this state,
and the country as well. I
could tell you countless stor-
ies of women who are spending
life or years and years of
their youth warehoused because
they had to seek relief for
years of spouse abuse.

I am cynical enough to think
that the "media stars" of the
movement don't find the issue
of women in prisons, denied
access to training and educa-
tion available to male prison-
ers, isn't chic enough to take
any time out of their busy
schedules to think about us in
a place like this.

We are women who suffer un-
der the repression of male
prosecutors, male judges, and
laws created by men. After the
court system, we are then
housed in a system that is
male-run, and our future free-
dom is determined by a male-
dominated parole board. On re-
turning to the community, you
are more likely to be super-
vised by a male parole officer.
How can a woman ever get a
break?

If any one group of women
had to be made aware of
their value and self-worth as
women and positive human be-
ings, it is here, and it is
now. I try to do what I can,
but some positive support from
outside feminist groups would
have a positive effect on

inside BMR:

their sense of self.

Thanks for listening...I
think a woman's place is every
where her abilities will take
her, perhaps I can convince
others that this is truth.

Good luck and keep pushing.

I would welcome the oppor-
tunity to share thoughts with
other women across the country
who would like to know more a-
bout the penitentiary experience
or those who just wish to share
thoughts.

In the struggle,

about the
cover artist

Betye Saar, born in 1926,
grew up in Watts, CA. In the
late 1960s Saar began to col-
lect and use as art materi-
als certain derogatory com-
mercial images of Blacks.
Hoping to expose the racism
they conveyed, she incorpor-
ated into her work the em-
blems of such products as
Darkie toothpaste, Black
Crow licorice, and Old Black
Joe butter beans. In her
"Liberation of Aunt Jemima"
the well-known symbol for a
line of food products is tra-
nsformed into a gun-carrying
warrior for Black liberation.
A collage of pancake-flour
labels acts as a background
for the imposing figure. Al-
though the lower portion of
the doll's body carries a
sign of her former role, the
viewer senses that the real
Aunt Jemima will soon be free.
