Women Fighting Prison Administration

To Everyone Concerned:

We, the inmates of ACTC-P-
Santa Maria are very concerned
about an unjust and potentially
dangerous situation. Of the

arizona

approximately 170 females
that are inmates here, 5 of
these are incarcerated for
child abuse or killing, in
some cases the crimes being
heinous, to say the least.
Three of the child
killers were
in protective
custody until
they were released into pop-
ulation. Also yesterday eve-
ning, nine other women were
taken to lock-up because Ad-
ministration feels they are
a “threat to the safety and
welfare of these three in-

mates." They are presently

being held in Intensive Max,
lock-down status, without

any formal institutional or
state charges against them.
And to add insult to injury
(or perhaps to our intelli-

gence), Russ Savage, the
Correctional Program Super-
visor, has made the statement
that anyone who even discusses
the subject of the baby-
abuser/killers will also be
locked-up.

The majority of the remain-
ing population feel this is
extremely unjust on the part
of Administration. Child-
abuse/killing is an unaccep-
table crime in any institu-
tion. The action taken yester-
day will not ensure the safe-
ty of the three child-abuse
killers. It has only served
to create a higher level of
hostility towards them. Their
personal safety will only be
ensured if they are again put
on protective custody status,
and the nine innocent women
are released into population.

We ask that you publish
this letter, and in doing so
we are asking your readers
to write to the following to
express their concern over
this injustice. With assis-
tance and support from the
outside we hope to resolve
this situation.

Dear Friends,

I am writing to you in the
hopes that you can give some
support and much needed infor-
mation. To date I am presently
incarcerated in an Arizona
prison and have recently been
placed in Administrative De-
tention for reasons which are

not yet known. Myself and
eight other women were placed
in lockup based on confiden-
tial information on March 16.

As of yet no allegations of
our offenses have been brought
against us. There is no docu-
mentation as to what we've
done. What also appears
strange is that five of the
women who were locked up
have all been known to be
“jailhouse lawyers." We have
been fighting the system for
changes for several years,
some of us both in this state
and California. We can only
assume that the warden here
has brought this action a-
gainst us for this reason.

I have been in this situa-
tion before. In California I
remained in the hole for 14
months due to legal action
taken against the California
Department of Corrections. It
has now been two years since
I was released from the hole
and a year since I was re-
leased from the California
Institute for Women to be
transferred to Arizona.

I will give you the follow-
ing as to what has occurred
with myself and the other
women:

1. We were placed in Adminis-
trative Detention and referred
to classification based solely
on confidential information.

2. We were not given any other
written documentation as to
the charges against us, there
were no write-ups issued with-
in the 24 hour time frame,
therefore we are being told
to prepare a defense without
any knowledge of what our
offenses are.

3. There are no provisions as
to how we may obtain legal
materials. There is no proce-
dure by which we can obtain
legal references while in
this status.

I'm sure that there will be
more to follow since this in-
stitution has also been known
to inhibit correspondence
when individuals attempt to
seek support and information
from outside resources.
If I am not mistaken, our
constitutional rights to due
process, access to legal ma-
terials, and to confront and
defend against our accusers
are being impaired and denied.
The actions taken against us
appear to be on the whims of
the warden, Roxanne Phillips.
I am asking that letters be
written to the following peo-
ple inquiring as to why my-
self and these other women
were placed in lockup, why
our rights are being impair-
ed, why there is no provision
for legal materials to be ob-
tained, and why there is no
information being given to us
as to our charges:

Your support and informa-
tion will be greatly appre-
ciated by all of us.

Dear Friends:

We are writing to keep your
readers up-to-date on the
current injustice here at
ACTC-P-Santa Maria.

The nine women who were
put on “Administrative Deten-
tion" (for which there exists
no criteria, by the way),
went before the Institutional
Classification Committee on
March 23, and were given 90
days segregation based solely
on “confidential information
received from a reliable
source and corroborated by
independent sources," because
they were "considered to be
a threat to the orderly oper-
ation of the institution"

The women were, and still are,
being denied legal
representation and access to
legal materials. Russ Savage,
Correctional Program Super-
visor, has taken it upon him-
self to be judge and jury in
this matter, and, to date,
has succeeded in his recently
obtained "career."

We, the inmates of ACTC-P-
Santa Maria, feel this is a
grave injustice, and we seek
support and assistance from
all concerned. In publishing
this letter, we ask that you
write to the following, ask-
ing why these women are be-
ing detained illegally, without
1. a fair hearing, 2.
legal representation, 3.
access to legal materials,
or 4. substantial and con-
crete evidence to warrant
them being placed on Admin-
istrative Segregation for an
extended period of time.

Thank you.

Dear Friends,

This letter is an update
on what's happening with the
women at Perryville, Arizona,
not just the nine who were
slammed March 16, 1983, but
all of them.

The Administration appar-
ently feels that it must take
retaliatory actions against
the population as a whole.

At first only nine of us
were slammed but it would
appear that certain others
are in danger of this happen-
ing to them also.

These are friends of those
already slammed who have
helped with obtaining legal
materials, which cannot be
gotten otherwise, have con-
tacted outside sources like
the media and who are seeking
the help of professional leg-
al aid for us. It is possible
that the Administration is
formulating a second plot to
segregate these women also
based on "confidential infor-
mation" again.

Furthermore it seems the
Administration is also plan-
ning on retaliating against
the population as a whole by
suddenly instituting a pro-
perty procedure that until
now has never existed. What
this includes is pulling what
Admin. classifies as "excess"
property. Specifically it
means taking away “extra
clothes that were allowed in-
to the institution through
Property and mail room offi-
cers. It includes things that
are glass or in glass that
were also allowed in. They
have no answer for us when
asked why no glass, since
every window in the institu-
tion is glass some being the
size of entire walls! They
are also pulling all Hobby-
craft items, coat hangers,
clothes racks and anything
else that might provide a

“convenience.”

If this is not in direct
reprisal why has the adminis-
tration no other offer of ex-
planation or justification?

All of us presently slammed
have friends out there and we
cannot help them, nor can
they offer any more help than
they already have. We feel
the Administration is only
acting because there have
been too many questions asked
concerning our situation and
because of the injustice done,
no one is letting the matter
just drop. The only other
reason is that they may be
trying to clean up their act
for having allowed this in-
stitution to be run without
rules or regulations other
than memos from the Warden.
Still it should not be taken
out on the inmates. To have
them suffer for the Adminis-
tration's incompetence is
another form of cruel and un-
usual punishment prevalent
within prisons.

More will be written as
events occur. Please write
these people to ask why this
is being done:

Roxanne Phillips, Warden,
Women's Division, P.O. Box
3400, Santa Maria, Goodyear,
AZ 85338; Dr. James R. Rick-
etts, 321 W. Indian School
Road, Phoenix, AZ 85013;

Dr. Alex Garabedian, Warden
ACTC-P, P.O. Box 3000,
Goodyear, AZ 85338.

(Collective Note: The state
attempts to keep us divided--
one from the other, group from
group--so we will fight each
other and not them.

"Child abuse/killing" is
unacceptable, but we need to
look at a society which fosters
violence, self-hatred--
gives no support to mothers,
especially poor and/or single
mothers.

We will not urge the admin-
istration to lock-up in the
hole one group of women as
opposed to another group of
women, for whatever put the
individual woman in the prison
--she is there and is a pris-
oner of the state.

The prison administration
knows what the politicians and
bosses know, to control the
people you must divide them
(us). Prisons do what they do
best: pit Black against White,

Latinos against Black or any
available combination, label
one crime more horrible than
another...churn the waters,
fan the flames...add violence
upon violence until riots oc-
cur. With every riot prisons
come under "investigation",
administration heads may roll
but it serves a purpose; out-
side people "know" that the
prisoners are "beyond redemp-
tion and violent" and more
money is granted for newer,
stronger security measures and
bigger and better prisons are
built. The circle is then com-
pleted by more people going
through the court system and
being thrown into prison and
fighting for their rights in-
side and hope all of us out-
side will give support in
terms of writing to the above
addresses to protest all in-
justices done to the women.)

We recognize that for us,
the collective, we are free
and on the outside, there is
no immediate danger and the
issue of who is in lock-up
and for why is more remote.
