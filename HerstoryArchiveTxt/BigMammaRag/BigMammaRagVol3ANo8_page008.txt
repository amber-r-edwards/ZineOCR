REA THE aR

Ob’servations By Obie

A column

Yes Virginia, there is a collective
effort that works! It is called
Theatre X and it's visiting the
Denver Free University theatre
from its Milwaukee base.
Theatre X has been operative for
six years with exploration into
various mediums sharing artistic
expertise as well as the
less glamorous responsibilities.
One of their latest endeavors is
Razor Blades, an open-ended
piece, still in the making, which
involves audience participation.

Razor Blades is stunning — for
the first hour and a half. Three
hours is long-winded particularly
in a non-linear ‘no’ plot
necessary" setting. The theme is
fear and not one is sacred — fear
of death, fear of life, fear of love,
sex involvement, the dark, even
fear of possible fearlessness!
There is a progression from the
everyday fears (afraid of ring
around the collar) to the more
“fearful” atrocities (clubbing
seals, hunting endangered
species etc.) The modes of
communication of these fears
are simple, creative and relatively
gimmick-less.

The five-member troupe is
outstanding individually but as a
team they are superb. I’ve not
seen bodies used to elicit mood
done so stunningly in a long
time. At one point they fan in and
out reminiscent of an elusive sea
anemone in their symmetry, first
taking tentative steps then fear
closing in and they withdraw
into a tight huddle. Another
mood shows them struggling in
a sexual fishnet with their
bodies and the imagination of
the audience the only props.

Arleen Kalenich, somewhat
limited in range, (there was a
hint of the ingenue in everything
she did) nonetheless had some
poignant and funny moments.
John Kishline does not have
much to say in three hours but
does well with what's given him,
particularly in his brief
appearance as a hanged man.
Willem Dafoe rounds out the
quintet nicely doing a great
Marlon Brando and bringing
incredible energy as the dumb
fearless boy.

If the sound of sandpaper
could have a wistful quality, that
would be Flora Coker’s voice.
She is exquisite in all her
movements never overacting
when the temptation to do so is
present in many of her scenes.
John Schneider is so consistently
true in his interpretations that
several times I thought he was
breaking character and not acting
at all.

Since Theatre X is not a
traditional mode of expression
the traditional beginning, middle
and end are absent. But the
audience is rewarded with a
vigorous cast, fine dialogue and
a few excellent scenes. There
were two especially noteworthy
scenes — a highly charged
satirical bit on fears lovers play
out (Do you love me? Why do you
hate me?) and a portrait of a
person reduced to statistics (his
remains were equal to 1/85 of
his body after cremation, 34
people spoke of him after his
death, how many times in his life
he misunderstood, etc.)

Theatre X and its cast are
warm, vibrant and vital. Razor
Blades is an effort worth supporting.

“dreams of being a natural / woman”

Nikki Giovanni

Suzanne Johasz

Because the black woman
poet is doubly oppressed, by both
race and sex, her conflict involves
priorities (which come first: black,
woman, poet?) and identity itself
(is she a poet who happens to be a
black woman, a black who happens
to be a woman poet, a woman who
happens to be a black poet?).
Nikki Giovanni is a black woman
poet whose three volumes of
poetry, Black feeling, Black talk /
Black judgement (1970), Re:
Creation (1970), and My House
(1972) express her concern with
bringing together the politics of
blackness and the politics of
womanhood, for both define
herself.

In Gemini: An Extended Auto-
biographical Statement of My
First Twenty-Five Years of Being
a Black Poet (1971), she says:

I was trained intellectually and
spiritually to respect myself and
the people who respected me. I
was emotionally trained to love
those who love me. If such a
thing can be, I was trained to be
in power — that is, to learn and
act upon necessary emotions
which will grant me more control
over my life... My life is not
all it will be. There is a real
possibility that I can be the first
person in my family to be free.
That would make me happy. I'm
twenty-five years old. A
revolutionary poet. I love.

Power and love are what are at
issue in Giovanni's poetry and
life. In her earlier poems (1968 -
1970) these issues are for the
most part separate. She writes
of personal love in poems of
private life; of black power and a
public struggle in political
poems. She won her fame with
the latter, in poems like “The
True Import of the Present
Dialogue, Black vs. Negro”:
“Nigger / Can you kill / Can you
kill / Can a nigger kill a honkie /
Can a nigger kill the Man." In such
poems she speaks for her
people in their own language of
the social issues that concern
them. Her role is that of spokes-
woman: “I wanted to be / a
sweet inspiration in my dreams
/ of my people .. .“” When she
“screams and stamps and
shouts” in poems like “Beautiful
Black Men...” I want to say just
gotta say something / bout
those beautiful beautiful
beautiful outasight / black
men,” she is following the same
tactics as when she asks,
“Nigger can you kill.” In praising
blackness she is fostering and
inciting pride, achievement, and
revolution; for the proper pride in
and achievement of blackness is
revolutionary. Giovanni’s poems
are not treatises but emotionally
charged utterances impelling
the person reading or hearing to
feel and act with the poet:
“BLACK STEP ONE: / Get the
feeling out (this may be painful
— endure) / BLACK STEP TWO:
/ Outline and implement the
Program.”

In these early poems Giovanni
is also concerned with the
political, public implications of
the fact of her womanhood, and
all implications point to power-
lessness: “it's a sex object if
you're pretty / and no love / or
love and no sex if you're fat”
("Woman Poem”); “waiting and
sitting / cause I'm a woman / all
I know / is sitting and waiting /
Cause I gotta wait / wait for it to
find / me” (“All I Gotta Do”). But
black power (public) and female
powerlessness (private) are con-
tradictory, even as is her private
devotion to love and her public
devotion to destruction.

The need to bridge the gap
between public and private is
suggested in “revolutionary
dreams” (1970): “I used to
dream militant / dreams of
taking over America .. ."; “I used
to dream radical dreams / of
blowing everyone away with my
perceptive powers /... I even
used to think I'd be the one / to
stop the riot and negotiate the
peace”:

then I awoke and dug

that if I dreamed natural
dreams of being a natural
woman doing what a woman
does when she’s natural

I would have a revolution.

The nature of the revolution
itself is in question when words
like “militant” and “radical”
are poised against “natural” and
“woman.”

Revolutions might occur else-
where than in the streets, and
they need not occur only in male
terms, she is beginning to see,
here and humorously, in a poem
like “Seduction,” in which the
male keeps talking politics —
“And what about the situation . .
."; “the revolution. . ."’ — while
she is taking off his clothes and
making love to him. As the poem
concludes she remarks: “then
you'll notice / your state of
undress / and knowing you
you'll just say / Nikki, / isn’t this

What follows is an edited
version of a translation of a letter
written by the European mother
of an infant daughter, who is
married to a Sudanese.

Khartoum, Sudan, April 28,
1975.

I write to you about the
situation of women here.
Women are oppressed in TOTAL
slavery, but it is especially of one
aspect of that oppression I wish to
tell you. That aspect is circumci-
sion, actually amputation.

When girls are between 7 and
13 years of age they are “cir-
cumcised.” The clitoris is cut off,
as well as the labia minor and
labia major. After that, the girl is
sewn together, and these
stitches break at the delivery of a
child. In addition, the vagina is
sewn together, like a reinforced
hymen. So, as a rule, it takes
several weeks before a husband
has penetrated his wife.

The amputation is executed at
home by a “midwife.” The family
has a big party, and everybody is
happy. The women sing and
shout in order to drown the cries
of pain from the child. If every-
thing turns out “well,” the
parents are congratulated that

counterrevolutionary . . .?" The
implicit answer is no.

That answer becomes explicit
in her 1972 volume, My House,
which brings the revolution off
the streets and into her private
space. It articulates and
politicizes the private, personalizes
the public. Its poems about
grandmothers, friends, lovers all
in some way define a personal
sense of black power: “I'm glad /
I'm Black not only / because it’s
beautiful / but because it’s me /
and I can be dumb and old and
petty and ugly / and jealous but I
still need love ("Straight Talk’).
Other poems stress the element of
personal vision and the significance
of art itself: “the outline of a
face or a picture isn't really / a
face or an image of a face but the
idea of an image / of a dream that
once was dreamed by some artist /
who never knew how much
more real is a dream than
reality” (“Nothing Makes
Sense”). She is seeing that art
can create as well as reflect
reality, as revolutions do. She
has also begun to understand
that the revolution needs to
begin in her own individual life
in order to be “natural,” that
coming to terms with her own
gifts, powers, and needs has to
come first, and that love and
power are integrally related.

I'm saying it’s my house
and I'll make fudge and call
it love and touch my lips
to the chocolate warmth
and smile at old men and call
it revolution cause what's real
is really real
(“My House”)

Here Giovanni brings her
power bases together, her domi-
nion over houses, love, and
words. No longer passive in any
way, she makes the food, the
love, the poem, and a revolution.
In bringing together her private
and public roles and thereby
validating her sense of self as
black woman poet, Giovanni is
on her way towards achieving in
art that for which she was
trained: emotionally, to love;
intellectually and spiritually, to
be in power. As she writes in
“When I Die”: “and if I ever
touched a life I hope that life
knows / that I know that
touching was and still is and will
always / be the true / revolu-
tion.”

Maimed

the girl did not lose too much
blood.

The custom of “circumcising”
girls is 4,000 years old. This
amputation is called Pharaonic
circumcision. Everybody does
this to their daughters, except
for the tiny minority of whites,
who are held in contempt. They
represent the occupation forces
of past centuries who have
stayed on. “European-
influenced” upper-class
Sudanese also practice this
circumcision; even
gynecologists and physicians do
it.

The amputation is said to be
prohibited by law, for
appearances’ sake. Circumci-
sion of girls is not discussed, is
never mentioned in the media,
and the people refuse to discuss
it with foreigners. I feel power-
less.

The only thing I can do is to
create publicity abroad in order
to create pressure on the Sudan-
ese government, to force them to
deal with the issue. What do you
have to say about this? INTER-
