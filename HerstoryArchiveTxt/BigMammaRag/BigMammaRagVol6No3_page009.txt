MUST NOT ROCK  
Linda Marie  
Daughters Inc. 1977  

Tea School  

"Whenever Helda wasn't around,  
Lester would have me blow him or he'd  
ball me in the ass on just for kicks -  
in front of me or have me jerk him  
off....when Helda was around, he'd  
beat the hell out of me....when we  
were alone, he'd tell me he had to do  
that so Helda wouldn't get suspicious.  
But it didn't seem like a game.  
When he'd beat me bloody..."  

The "me" above is pre-teen Linda  
Dee. Helda is her mother, Lester her  
step-father. Helda was charged with  
child abuse several times before Lind  
and her younger brother and sister  
were finally removed from her home  
and made official wards of the state.  
The final removal for Linda came af-  
ter she turned her step-father in for  
sexual abuse when she was 12.  

The choice, as Linda saw it, was  

between being controlled by her mother  
who was controlled by Lester or con-  
trolled by the State. Her life was  
spent in various juvenile homes, foster  
homes, and girls reformatory schools,  
such as the "Convent of the Holy  
Terror" complete with sadistic nuns.  

As a baby, Linda's mother would  
tie her and her younger brother to  
the crib and leave them in the dark  
for days. Then Helda met and married  
Lester, who got his daily exercise  
by beating the children.  

Dinner was always a bad time, be-  
cause the children had to sit within  
Lester's reach. Linda tells, with  
little emotion, of one dinner where  
one of Helda's babies was crying in  
its bed. Lester beat the baby into  
unconsciousness to make it stop cry-  
ing. The knowledge is there that this  
was not an isolated occurrence.  

When 10, Linda broke her hip in a  
fall. Confined to a full body cast  
for eight months, she lies in a dark  
room, visited only by Lester and their  
old man boarder, who abuse her sexual-  
ly. She is, of course, totally help-  
less to run away and wholly at their  
mercy.  

"The old man gave Lester the down-  
payment on the house in exchange for  
a room there for the rest of his life.  
Helda, my little sister and I were  
included in this deal and he managed  
to get to each of us when he could....  
I was the child bride of my mother's  
husband who had chosen to share me  
with his boarder. I was ten years  
old."  

The terror of her home life has no  
limit. The church and the state were  
the stabilizing factors of her life,  
even though she knew "I was a file  
number to one and a lost soul to the  
other."  

How does Linda deal with the day-  
to-day horror of her life? The same  
way that any of us who were sexually  
abused and/or beaten by our fathers  
cope. She dreads it, but has no way  
out and therefore resigns herself to  
the pain passively, fantasizing about  
wonderful parents who will save her.  

It is important to remember that  
the story is true. Linda Doe, sexual-  
ly abused and beaten by her father,  
is myself with very few differences.  
Her family lived in desolate poverty  
while we were merely around the bot-  
tom, I never told until I was an  

adult. Linda's story makes me glad  
that I kept the “secret.” The book  
was very hard for me to read; the  
reality, the harshness, the methods  
of coping used by Linda brought all  
too many memories.  

The title refers to Linda's habit  
of rocking when she was put into the  
convent. She had to write the phrase  
hundreds of times because rocking  
meant she was disturbed and it upset  
the staff.  
perpetual motion. Repress the symp-  
toms, don't treat the cause. The book  
title is also a succinct summary of  
Linda's entire life and the ways in  
which she was treated by the man's  
courts and the man's church.  

There are many things not mention-  
ed about the beatings, probably be-  
cause they were too painful to remem-  
ber. How you don't cry when you're  
hit; don't wipe the blood when you  
feel it ooze down your face over your  
lip. You make up little magics that  
will save you. And most of all, you  
know you are going to outlive the  
bastard because you've planned his  
death in so many painful ways.  

The back cover of the book has an  
incredibly condescending quote from  
Rita Mae Brown: "The miracle isn't  
that Linda Marie lived through the  
life she tells about--women can live  
through anything--but that she lived  
through it with such a marvelous cut-  
throat sense of humor."

Linda did not live through her life  
with a "marvelous" sense of humor; she  
existed by giving up a few things like  
warmth and love. Those instances of  
"hilarity" are not funny; they are  
overwhelmingly bitter and angry. The  
comment that women can live through  
anything is so thoughtlessly glib as  
to be meaningless. As a woman who  
has "lived through it," I found the  
comment both offensive and demeaning  
to my struggle.  

When Linda turned her stepfather  
in, there were court hearings and  
psychiatric examinations that just  
blurred before her face. Men examin-  
ed her, men told her that she had  
started it, men told her that she was  
guilty. Even after her stepfather  
confessed, more or less, she was the  
one punished for the rest of her life.  
She understood the reasons for it,  
not at the time, but later. Probation  
reports, the transcript of the trial,  
and psychiatric evaluations are in-  
cluded in the book. The stepfather  
is determined not to be a sexual  
psychopath, just an average male who  
"lost control" when presented with a  
helpless female child.  

The book is simple and powerful.  
Any woman who has lived any portion  
of Linda's life, from rape to girls  
reform schools, from beatings to un-  
scaring poverty, will find something  
of herself in Linda. She is a sur-  
vivor.
