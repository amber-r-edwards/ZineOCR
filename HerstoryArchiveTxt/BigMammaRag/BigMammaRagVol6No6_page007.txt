WHAT MIGHT HELP

face it  
nothing helps

not women kissing sexy in the street  
not pizza not exercise

not orgasm not optimism not %  
loaster-ovens  
not moving to another part of town

not trains, not even if a sunflower  
thrives beside the tracks

before the tunnel, not even if  
the tunnel  
blooms forth in a platform of light

wine does not help nor anger  
nor the blue sky crisp above  
Christopher Street

nor palmistry nor poetry nor  
coffee ice cream  
nor remembering your dreams

what might help

to let the year shatter  
and slide into winter

to cook your potatoes*  
a silent chiff-dweller

while radio voices  
slip up the brick canyons

to lie in your single bed  
listening to sirens

to die by your own hand

to wake in the morning

"What Might Help" is the first poem  
in Jan Clausen's collection of poetry,  
after touch. It gets the book off to  
a brisk start. The pace and the inten-  
sity in the poem is sustained through-  
out the book. Clausen's style is rem-  
iniscent of the way a person with a  
dry sense of humor tells a joke: sud-  
denly you find that you have been lur-  
ed into the poem, but then you are ap-  
preciative of the luring.

at last spring co-opts us

the leaves thickening

to a crescendo of greens

a chromatic range

I never saw in the west

and, purple trees bloom

on the grass as the park mends

Jan Clausen is a founder and editor  
of Conditions, an excellent magazine  
of women's writing with an emphasis  
on writing by lesbians. She was born  
in Oregon and has resided in New York  
City since 1973. The clash of these  
two disparate realities-- the sensuous  
beauty of nature vs. the ugliness of

. big city life --is reflected throughout  
many of her poems.

x* & *

note how no one escapes  
the conditions of this life:

not the men playing drums,  
playing softball on the grass;  
not the women arranging

the picnic lunch

there's a politics attached

to the consumption of sugar and starch  
from the ice cream wagon;

a politics of whining children,

their mothers; of a city unappalled  
at the zoo's stench,

at the polar bear weary

and sick to death for the north

There's a politics of delirious  
women and men

who sit all day on the curbs

of my spit-slick street

with their paper-bagged booze

after touch is divided into three  
sections: Winter, Spring and Summer.  
I particularly enjoyed Winter which is  
especially bittersweet. Her poetry is  
understated, yet straightforward; it  
is quiet, yet it doesn't hesitate. Up-  
on subsequent readings, I felt as though  
I had been gently guided to ex-  
citement. Many poems are about herself  
and other women awakening to their own  
strength and reality:

you must understand  
that it is too late  
for your measures

for I already

have plans to come  
separate

screaming my own song  
into the new world  
filling my lungs

with its dangerous air

you must understand

400 late for what you want  
we can't sit around talking  
in the womb anymore

for already I have

begun to be born

Woman to Woman Coffeehouse:  
A Great Success

Dona Calacone

On the evenings of April 24 and  
May 1, between 70 and 90 women packed  
the basement of the Woman to Woman  
Bookcenter on the occasion of Denver's  
first women's coffeehouse. Each eve-  
ning offered a wide variety of enter-  
tainment. There was music, theatre,  
comedy, mime and poetry. (What more  
could one ask for?) The quality of the  
entertainment was high and there was  
ample time between sets to talk and  
socialize. An atmosphere of easy, en-  
joyable communication prevailed for  
audience and performers alike. And  
all of this was free; there was no co-  
ver charge and wonderful homebaked  
goodies were on sale at very reason-  
able prices.

The Woman to Woman collective sees  
the coffeehouse as fulfilling the need  
for a “non-alcoholic alternative meet-  
ing place for women of all ages" and  
also as a forum for women in the per-  
forming arts. Another coffeehouse is  
planned for June, the date not yet  
confirmed at this writing. There will  
probably be a nominal cover charge,  
perhaps 50¢, for the June coffeehouse  
which will be used to pay performers.  
Profits from the sale of refreshments  
are used to support subsequent coffee-  
houses. Once again, free childcare  
will be provided at the Gay Community  
Center.

It's obvious that support for a wo-  
men's coffeehouse does exist in Denver

and that there is a need for a relaxed  
non-alcoholic womanspace on a more  
frequent basis than once a month. The  
basement at Woman to Woman is less  
than ideal as a coffeehouse space,  
being poorly ventilated and rather  
small. However it is a fine beginning  
and the Woman to Woman collective  
should be applauded.

The collective needs support and  
help from women outside the collective  
to continue the coffeehouse. Anyone  
wishing to perform or help in any way  
should call the bookstore at 320-5972,
