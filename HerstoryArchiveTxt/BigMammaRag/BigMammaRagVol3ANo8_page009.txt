Funeral Day  

Finally, now, night, covers  

the level cement,  

smooths it with her hand,  

finally as cut earth  

closed over the wooden lid,  

sunset like a smudge of blood,  
walking down Broadway, each big  
shovel full of death falling  

on my stomach, her little body curled  
like an old lady foetus in the box,  
slices of sidewalk removed like shells  
and the soil heaves  

up like vomit!  

Claims the clean lady, I cannot,  

I will not, I cannot, my legs failed me,  
pushing the stroller like a Geiger counter  
looking for her heart buried  

under the hard cement.  

Mary,  

where are you. Just a little sign  

this isn't what it seems to be,  

you dead and buried, you  

dead. and your body buried, your life  
altogether over, the earth  

turned in March, ploughed up  

to take the not you that looks  

like you, the terrible twin, the false  
grin of the thing that apes you, you —  
I've lost you in the gruesome wonder  
of death all over, the earth like shit,  
I've lost you in the evil of death.  

I've lost death  

into evil,  

underground, fire, excrement,  
murder, torture, I walk through the valley,  
I fear the weight of natural topsoil  
there on your wide porous bones  

in their ancient unlaced stays of flesh.  

Buried in my body Satan  

peers around the twisted tree  

of the heart and whispers olly olly  
oxen free, let it all happen,  
blacken the good name of death.  

Mary, I name you, Mary, I remember,  
made to lie beside the still  

waters of no life, did you finally  
choose to taste  

or was it a humming -  

light, a drill, that was your moment,  
last of ninety-three years,  

and this grave  

day is but  

the gardening.  

your eyes,  
smooth and round as opals  
stare at me from under eyelids  
heavy with sleep  
imposing and beautiful you are,  
ripe and swollen  
and sour  
the dreams crease your face  
shivering and luminous  
it all begins to come clear  
dark and defined, they are now  
sisters have taught you no longer  
to be ashamed of the sour strength that  
in all your yesterdays you hid  
they teach you to fight back  
just scalding all your goals with  
your steam,  
just growing into the heavy, familiar body  
just awakening to the resistance  
that is fire within you  
like some hand grenade ready to explode,  
you crouch behind the old frightened smiles —  
it will be a surprise attack.

both horizons in silk petals,  

“gardening in our acts, flowing,  
lowering. Planted today.

No Longer on the Auction Block  

I am the woman you dreaded & I am the woman who told you so.  
I am the slumbering secretary you want to fire  
after lunch,  

collage the agency temporary who has worn out her welcome,  

a thick-stemmed mountain in black.  
Insanity and ashes; insanity believes  
ears can breathe and lies can smile.  
My nights are overwhelmed in light,  
my eyebrows think they bleed.  
No one has touched my earlobes  
in a globe's age;  

I am the woman who listens and listens and listens,  
who considers well what you say & continues to remain silent.  
Who never lets anyone see the caverns of her mind.  

I am the work of the horse, the edge of time,  

the insult who came to the party & won the door prize,  

I've given up earrings, the designs the something that crawls through the flesh in the night.  

are too complex.  

I am the black woman who grows over your eye,  

the white woman who presses against the side of the untouchable,  
the blend of both.  

Jean Sirius  

I am the little girl down the block with the braces,  
the 12-year-old mother who hides the evidence.  

I am a small stone that catches under the foot,  
a wet twig,  
a thorn that tears open the hand & dies.  

I am the courtesan, the prostitute,  

the candle left dripping on the kitchen sink,  

the face of the river running before you, the twilight  
song,  

the shadow that waits in the doorway, the murmuring of the  
end,  

the courage on going on without turning around,  

the keepsakes wrapped in tissue paper in a cigar box,  

black woman  
in a blue dress  
waits for a bus  

in the shade. the birds,  
tambourine the heavy eyelashes of a thousand women  
in one hand, looking in the same mirror.  

like a modern-day sojourner.  
she slaps the drum  

against her hip  

keeping time  

to her own truth.  

I am the woman you dreaded & I am the woman you  
love.  
I am a new road & a clear day.
