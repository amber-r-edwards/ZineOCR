"In 1969, very few people had heard  
of women's liberation..." and in  
1979, when women's liberation seemed  
like “old news", very few women had  
been able to say that they had read  
a feminist novel that reflected the  
women's movement with the honesty  
and passion that had taken so many  
of us by surprise, making us change  
not only the way we live, but our  
whole vision of what the world should  
be.  

Ten years' time has not produced  
that many fictional works around the  
women's movement. In January, 1980,  
Big Mama Rag received a review copy  
of Seed of a Woman by Ruth Geller.  

I looked at it on the table suspic-  
iously for days, its back cover face  
up taunting me to read it with the  
description: "an intense first novel  
of the emerging women's movement..."  
That's just the novel I was looking  
for, but hadn't found. I felt burned  
by “Burning Questions": the main  
character, Zane IndiAnna, was more  

of a voyeur to the events of wom-  
en's liberation, rather than a parti-  
cipant in not only the events, but  
the emotional changes for any woman  
involved in marches, the conscious-  
ness raising, and personal relation-  
ships with men and newfound rela-  
tionships with women. Her sense of  
self-importance (which there was  
plenty of) was in the label radical  
or revolutionary, not in the content  
of what being a radical revolutionary  
feminist really meant; I felt she  
was a "daring woman" more for shock  
value - it was not that she was being  
true to herself and her own values  
she claimed to possess, which were  
certainly daring at the time. To be  
remembered in the public's eye as a  
larger than life figure seemed to be  
her priority; she seized the women's  
movement as a means to reach this  
goal. What did it for me was when  
she discovered the FBI had a file on  
her activity in the women's libera-  
tion movement. The book went on to  
insult any woman seriously working  
on identifying the trappings of op-  
pression and trying to break through  
them when Zane IndiAnna made clear  
that women in the movement could  
measure their success by the length  
of their FBI file.  

I also felt ripped off by The Wo-  
men's Room. The book makes a good  
argument that things have to change  

before women can indeed live fulfill-  
ing lives; it tells a good story a-  
bout how one woman, having been opp-  
ressed by "Shit and string beans", can  
no longer silence her anger, and how  
she goes about making change in her  
life. Her alienation and anger at men  
is put into context with other women  
(at Harvard of all places) and good  
statements are made in the process  
around rape, marriage, and other "fem-  
inist issues". Where I felt ripped-  
off was when there are only three al-  
ternatives presented for a woman who  
comes to terms with her anger at men  
(and the world): 1) you end up totally  
alone walking the beaches of Maine  
with no one or no group of people to  
share your life; 2) you end up dead,  
carrying out a suicide mission against  
oppression and injustice; 3) you end  
up cynical with no expectations from  
other people or belief in women's  
ability to change.  

Other recent “women's liberation  
books" which left me frustrated, in  
which I'd hoped to catch glimpses of  
how we women are trying to change to  
meet the expectations we've set for  
ourselves to fight a world which is  
in conflict with the way things should  
be, were The High Cost of Living  
(where lesbianism was a crime) and  
Some Do (where rape is the gimmick).  

Tired of gimmicks and opportunism,  
it was with hesitation that I picked  
up Seed of a Woman. I'm glad I did; it  
wasn't until that last page was read  
that I put it down. There were no  
gimmicks: the author has obviously  
"been there", and what Ruth Geller  
provides is more than a fictionalized  

account of how women in the late six-  
ties began to first understand and  
then to deal with the implications of  
their involvement with “women's lib-  
eration" - on a personal level, in  
their relationships with the men in  
their lives, as a new political force  
within and separate from the anti-war  
movement, and as importantly, with  
each other.  

The process of “coming to terms" with  
women's liberation for three main char-  

acters in the book - Justine, Becky  
and Terry - is not immediate. It is  
what the book is all about; and this  
is what makes Seed of a Woman more  
a documented history of women's per-  

sonal and ultimately political change.  

At first, this lack of "immediacy"  
bothered me; five pages into the  

book I made a notation in the column  
that “Someone that conscious wouldn't  
submit to doing something she didn't  
want to do." I was referring to Becky  
and her inner voice which told her  
not to take on "extra" hard work just  
to help (read: please) the man who  
would eventually become her lover,  
but whose outer voice said "it won't  
be much trouble at all." Then it oc-  
curred to me that of course, she would  
let her outer voice be victorious,  
just as I let happen ten years ago  
(and at times still struggle not to  
let happen.) I didn't know then what  
I know now, just as she didn't know  
at the beginning of the book what  
she knew toward the end.  

At one point Becky, in one of her  
many acts of self-denial, dismisses  
a newly formed women's group as a  

"hen party" to her boyfriend after  
a meeting that she, herself, was in-  
volved with that had begun to tackle  
questions of "sexual politics" -  
bringing the rhetoric to the home-  
front. That sharing with other women,  
although still foreign to her,  
had obviously touched her somewhere  
and the "self-denial" was to assure  
herself, as much as her boyfriend,  
that it didn't have to mean change.  
Nowhere can the reader feel cheat-  
ed in being left out of how Becky,  
Terry and Justine feel the feelings  
they do, and how they come to the  
decisions they do. Even when there  
are some questions left unresolved  
for the women, it's not because the  
author couldn't sew it up nicely in-  
to a tight, finished product; it's  
because the process is never final.  
The women in the book are all around  
us - and are us - still discovering  
by trial and error the right answers  
to many of those questions.  
This, too, is why the book is not  
just a period piece. Although it is  
set on a campus, with anti-war ac-  
tivism and male radicals present  
throughout, the visions and changes  
that weave these women together are  
happening today. The "props" of  
the sixties can be changed with to-  
day's props and the story still works.  

At one point in the book Becky  
is spending a very uncomfortable eve-  
ning with Bryce, who wants to “lay”  
Becky, a friend of Bryce's and the  
friend's "chick". The "chick" Melissa  
is being ridiculed by Bryce for her  
habit of eating peaches and saving  
the pits:  

He snickered. "...In two months you've saved at least a dozen peach pits. I never asked why, because I assumed it was some moronic reason. But at this point my curiosity knows no bounds."  

"It's not a moronic reason."  

"Well then?"  

"I plant them."  

"Where?"  

"I don't know. Wherever I am."  

"You mean you just push them into  
the ground, just like that?"  

She nodded.  

"I hate to break your bubble, my  
dear child, but they won't grow."  

"Bryce, a seed always grows."  

"Not if it's got a pit around it,  
Missie dear. Not if it's encased in  
a shell."  

She didn't answer.  

Becky opened her mouth to volunteer  

Out of the Lesbians-Colorado con-  
ference last September came Sage, a  
new women's cultural production com-  
pany based in Denver.  

The first months of our existence  
were spent doing organizational work  
and participating in conceptual dis-  
cussions about our structure as a  
group and our process for operation.  
When we were asked to write an art-  
icle about ourselves it soon became  
apparent that, because we are a very  
diverse group of women, we would not  
be able to make a comprehensive pol-  
itical statement. We have, however,  
come up with some basic agreements  
about our work:  

1. All decisions made are by con-  
sensus.  

2. All events are to be made acc-  
essible to as many women as possi-  

ble. This means that we will have:  
- free childcare  
- interpretation for the hearing  
impaired  
- access for handicapped women  
- donation prices as low as possi-  
ble  
- work exchange  
- concerts for women only as well  
as mixed audiences  

3. We will be accountable to the  
women's community. We welcome feed-  
back and criticism and will hold  
community meetings to make it eas-  
ier for this to happen. Midnight  
at the bar does not constitute a  
community meeting.  

4. We are interested in producing  
more women of color than have been  
produced in the past. We are also

Colorful Listening Music  

Martie Mathers  

The Sirani Avedis album is out!  
Old news in Denver, all my friends  
already have a copy. There is a new  
cover, however. Tattoos is, above  
all, a great listening album. The in-  
strumentation is fine, especially  
Jean Fineberg's saxophone. More and  
more women's music is incorporating  
Latin and Afro-influenced percus-  
sion. Liberty Mata plays bongos,  
conga, guiro, woodblock, bells and  
keys; the album would not be the  
same without her. And for all who  
have not heard her, Sirani's voice  
is like an instrument itself.  

There are some phrases that just  
continue to echo in your mind even  
after one listening. "Here in rape  
city, isn't it a pity/Must be fat  
city for the boys," from "This  
American City, a "hell-like mascu-  
line creation." As piercing as are  
her descriptions, her melodies are  
smooth, weaving an ironic lullaby.  
At last not only good music, but  
political woman-awareness. In "You  
are the River" she exhorts, “child  
don't let them bend your precious  
spirit...Keep the child alive."  
"Rainbow Woman," another of my  
favorites speaks of her American dis-  
location as a member of the tiny Ar-  
menian minority: "You're from a her-  
itage of genocide and pain...and  
even today you sing the gutsiest  
songs." Yes, what she says is true:  
"You've got your own culture, woman."  

Sirani Avedis began her musical  
career at age 5, imitating rock  
and roll and rhythm and blues hits  
on the piano. By the time she was  
11, she had turned to the guitar;  
and by the age of thirteen, she  
entered a period of folk/rock pro-  
test music which brought her to  
coffee houses and night clubs in  
the Washington, D.C. area. By the  
time she had performed at the  
Earth Day rally in 1971, she had  
returned to the piano and was  
again pounding the keys to the  
funky rhythms of her earlier times.  

After playing with various D.C.  
bands, Sirani began to actively in-  
corporate her politics into her  
art; she was performing solo con-  
certs for women and writing music  
that focuses lyrically on women's  
realities, particularly minority  
women and lesbians. Armenian-Amer-  
ican, Sirani employs elements of her  
heritage to bring to contemporary  
music a unique sensibility. "Tat-  
toos" is her debut album. It is  
available locally at Woman to Woman  
Bookcenter at a price of  

$6.25.
