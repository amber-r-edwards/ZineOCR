Susan Griffin Makes Boulder Stopover

Diane O'Donnell

Susan Griffin came to Boulder last
week to publicize her new collection
of poems, Like the Iris of an Eye,
published by Harper and Row. Atten-
ded by a small but receptive audi-
ence, primarily composed of women,
she read her poems in a fine, clear
voice and also used the occasion to
read some in-draft excerpts from
her work-in-progress, Women and Na-
ture: The Roaring Inside Her.

Sponsored by the University of
Colorado Women's Studies Program and
two student groups, Susan was here
on one stop of a nationwide tour to
promote her new book and talk about
her new play "The Voices" as well.
Unfortunately, the reading was not
very well publicized beyond the cam-
pus, and this is a shame. Susan is
a writer who speaks to a broader
audience, one which should have had
an opportunity to know she was co-
ming.

The longtime feminist first pub-
lished in the women's presses such
as her friend Alta's Shameless Hussy
Press.

Her reading was preceded by the
Boulder Feminist Theatre Collective,
whose members performed her short
story "The Sink," and read/acted
poems from “Let Them Be Said" and
"Letters." Accompanied by guitarist
Lisa Lloyd, the player/readers were
Katie O'Brien, Dinah Leavitt, and
Juliett Wittman.

They performed movingly and skill-
fully, with obvious affection and
appreciation for Susan's words. I
wish the group had performed fewer
of the poems and let her do more of
the older ones, ones with which the
audience was familiar and wanted--or
at least I really wanted--to hear
her do herself. Several of the long

poems must be extremely hard to per-
form totally from memory which they
did, and with only a few observable
lapses. Poetry-as-play is a very
exciting phenomenon and oddly enough
a fairly rare one, for it seems like
such a natural combination. When it
is done well, it works. This time,
it was definitely done well. Susan
seemed both pleased and moved by

the Collective's performance of her
works.

Susan Griffin's work derives its
strength from the use of ordinary
common words, aligned musically and
lyrically in long lines. She uses
repetition extremely well, and
builds upon previous lines in a
striking manner. The best use of

this tactic occurs in the poem, “An
Answer to a Man's Question, ‘What
Can I Do About Women's Liberation?'"
--the poem popularly referred to as
"Wear A Dress." The beginning line
becomes a repeating refrain, used to
emphasize both a political point and
a poetic mode, as follows:

Wear a dress.

Wear a dress that you made yourself,
or bought in a dress

store.

Wear a dress and underneath the
dress wear elastic, around

your hips, and underneath your nip-
ples.

Wear a dress, with elastic and a
sanitary napkin and sling

back shoes on Telegraph Avenue and
try to run.

Borrow a child and stay in the house
all day with the child,

or go to the public park with the
child, and take the child

to the welfare office and cry and
say your man left you and

be humble and wear your dress and
your smile, and don’t talk

back, keep your dress on, cook more
nice dinners, stay

away from Telegraph Avenue, and
still, you won't know the

half of it, not in a million years.

The strong voices of the group were
very effective, and they used ges-
tures and movement quite well to
emphasize the points. The poem was
greeted by the audience with much
enthusiasm and obvious recognition
and identification.

In my opinion, "The Sink" was the
best performed of their pieces.
Using one woman as the protagonist,
one as the narrator, and one as the
actual sink itself was visually
vivid and more than just clever.

Another piece which was truly mov-
ing was the long chant, "I Like to
Think of Harriet Tubman." This poem
is one of Griffin's angriest, and
the choice of Harriet Tubman is a
very strong and appropriate one.

The group performed this piece as
a vocal unit, at first alternating
lines and groups of lines, then
building to a conclusion where they
read and almost shouted the final
lines. The audience was loudly
clapping, shouting, stamping their
feet in reaction. It was the cer-
tain moment, when all were one,
unified in feeling and response.

After the Collective's performance,
Susan came out quietly and non-offi-
cially. (Unlike many an official
C.U. visiting poet or performer) No
academic stuffiness, no aura of auth-
ority or pompousness, of holding
some magic secret that only widely

published writers are allowed. She
spoke with warmth and kindness. A
vivid feeling of generational con-
tinuity, women linked to women over
a long time period, was built up and
felt strongly through her reading;
especially when she mentioned having
found old journals of her grand-
mother and great-grandmother in an
attic, and keeping them, reading
them over a period of years.

Her quiet reading voice enchanted
some listeners, and frustrated
others who kept moving up closer to
hear her. I found her quietness
moving and effective, as it carried
its own low-keyed power, no shouting
necessary; the strength of the words
came through. The most memorable
poems were two she read from her
Tiredness Cycle--read, with a moving
introduction about how women with
young children have their own sense
of fatigue, an extra special tired-
ness all their own; again, heads

were nodding in recognition.
