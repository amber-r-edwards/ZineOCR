“You Can't Stop NOW!”
4 Cont. Held in Texas

National Public Information
Office, NOW -- Proving the
theme, “You Can't Stop
NOW!”, the women and men
attending NOW’s 1974 Na-
tional Conference initiated a
dynamic and far-reaching
program for the coming year.
Innovative strategies were
planned in such areas as
employment, marriage and
the family, women’s right to
choose, women in sports, and
international Feminism.
Combatting employment
discrimination was designated
as a high priority for the
coming year, with plans to
focus activities on large
corporations and on compli-
ance agencies which do not
fulfill their mandate. NOW
plans to take action both
nationally and locally against
Sears, which is a major
offender in failing to meet
equal employment opportuni-
ty standards for women.
NOW also made plans to
design and support legislation
which would guarantee home-
makers an income and social
security benefits. In addition,
the organization plans to
develop educational programs
to raise public consciousness
concerning the varying role
and skills of the homemaker.
Emphasizing women’s right
to reproductive choice and
control of their own bodies,

NOW resolved to oppose any
anti-abortion amendments to
the Constitution, stating that
“denial of a woman's right to
abortion is a religious, philo-
sophical, and, more impor-
tantly, a spiritual issue, and
not a political issue.” “With
determined opponents of
women’s rights such as the
Ku Klux Klan, John Birch
Society, Young Americans for
Freedom and Right to Lifers”
named as targets, NOW
affirmed its plans to monitor
both locally and nationally the
activities of these organiza-
tions.

In response to almost daily
requests for information from
all parts of the world, NOW
authorized affiliation with
viable international units and
made plans to adopt suggested
international by-laws and
encourage the convening of
new international affiliates.
NOW will apply for non-gov-
ernmental organization (NGO)
consultative status with the
United Nations, providing
many channels in the UN
through which NOW repre-
sentatives can offer the
feminist viewpoint and urge
concerted action.

Book Reviews

Trilogy. Diane Wakoski.
Doubleday. $2.95.
Janet McReynolds

This is a reissue of the first
three volumes of Diane
Wakoski’s poems, which have
previously been unavailable
except on the rare book
market, with an extremely
useful introduction by the
author. The collection, con-
sisting of Coins & Coffins,
Discrepancies and Apparitions
and The George Washington
Poems offer valuable
insights into the poet's later
work, as well as being a trip in
themselves.

Diane has always been
conscious of her position as a
female in a man's world. A
feeling of displacement and
alienation permeates these
poems. Unlike Adrienne Rich
and Anne Sexton, who both
seem at home in the feminine
side of their psyches, Diane
seems caught in a perpetual
conflict between the feminine
and masculine sides of her
mind, unsure of her own
identity and uncomfortable in
a world which insists on
treating her like a stranger.
She is inventing herself. Her
poems are an attempt to
construct a personal myth
which reacts to the dominant
patriarchal myth of our cul-
ture, at times complementing
it, at other times contradicting
it.

The dramatic poems take
the form of an extended
dialogue with a male who is
brother, father, or lover. The
brother, significantly,
committed suicide and ap-
pears in the poems as an
animus figure. The lover
poems are the most painful,
being filled with images of
dismemberment, fragmenta-
tion, death of the ego. Again
and again she hurls her
identity against the “other,”
experiencing the sense of
loneliness and abandonment
which is a common feature of
love relationships in our
society. One of the poems
comments:

A realization of difference
came,

and comes and comes and
comes.

When will I find a lover

who is not a blizzard of
slashed feelings?

The George Washington
poems are an examination of
the failure of patriarchal
society, the world of fact that
depersonalizes both men and
women, leaving them es-
tranged from their own feel-
ings. George Washington as a
symbol is a surrogate for her
personal father, who aban-
doned her when she was quite
small. In “The Father of My
Country” she says: my father
made me what I am,/ a lonely
woman,/ without a purpose,
just as I was/ a lonely child /
without any father.”

George Washington is also
metal, currency, agriculture,
the flatness of fact. In
“George Washington: The
Whole Man” she tests the
symbol against the men she
has known, illustrating her
premise that “somehow we
have all been swamped by
history and bamboozled a bit;
that its elegance is also an
absurdity. That our feelings
which we honor, simply
because we have them, are
also mundane and foolish.”
“Trilogy” read as one long
poem, becomes a spiritual
autobiography, an extended
dialogue with the world, in
which the poet, with no
guidelines except her own
feelings, is continually reject-
ing false images, readjusting
her vision, seeing the same
experience over and over, as if
multiplicity must eventually
render up all possible truths.

Sexual Honesty
edited by Shere Hite
Warner Paperback $1.50

Donna Good

During summer my time for
reading increases sevenfold
and in the past month I've
outdone myself, reading al-
most everything I'd put aside
all winter. Of all that I’ve read,
two books stand out in my
mind so much that I feel an
almost evangelistic urge to
tell you about them.

The first book goes by the
rather straightforward title,
Sexual Honesty. And that’s
really what it’s all about. Two
years ago a NOW member by
the name of Shere Hite sent
out an incredibly long and
comprehensive sex question-
naire to women all over the
country. She went to a lot of
trouble to make sure she got a
random sample of women
including it's almost impossi-
ble by any means to answer
the questions in
doctors’ offices, handing it
out freely to any woman met,
and, incredibly, having Oui
magazine publish it.

The book is subtitled, a
book by women, for women,
and is itself simply an
assortment of some of the
answers Shere Hite got in
response to her questions.
Reading the book, I was
depressed and, in turn,
elated. Most of the women
must have spent three or four
hours on their answers with
some of them obviously using
the questionnaire to vent
frustrations. Some of the
women just as obviously,
have used it to talk about a
forbidden subject.

I have never seen a book
which so clearly showed me
the bonds I share with other
women and how very basic
they are to our lives. I think
every woman should be given
a copy of this book on her
twelfth birthday (a new puber-
ty rite) and every man should
be required to read it at
ten-year intervals.

Walk to the End of the World
Suzy McKee Charnas
Ballantine Books $1.25

The other book I would like
to tell you about is a new
science fiction novel by Suzy
McKee Charnas called, Walk
to the End of the World. For
Feminists who love sci-fi this
book is a treasure. Instead of
the usual brilliant, virile,
dominant young fellow who
triumphs over the whims of
space and fate, we have a
whole new world built for us
—a world where the society
of the western world today
has been carried as far as it
can go along the way it now
pursues.

In Walk the atomic war has
come and long gone and a
new world has started to
rebuild itself; a world where
the sexes are completely
separate and women are the
dregs of the society, used for
breeding and total servitude.

Out of these dregs come a
strong female society (under-
ground of course) and from
this society emerges our
heroine — who is not saved by
any deus ex machina; does
not fall in love with the
handsome hero; and does not
give us our typical happy
ending.

overruled by her sister.

The amended resolution,
containing only a generalized
condemnation of violence
with an expression of sym-
pathy, was announced perio-
dically on Wichita radio
stations during the afternoon
when further information on
the cause of the shootings
testified to the group’s good
judgment and taste. The final
resolution read:

“With a deep sense of grief,
the National Women’s Politi-
cal Caucus deplores the
continued acts of violence
against humanity and the
caucus extends its sympathy
to the families of Mrs. Alberta
King, Edward Boykin and Mrs.
Jimmy Mitchell.”
