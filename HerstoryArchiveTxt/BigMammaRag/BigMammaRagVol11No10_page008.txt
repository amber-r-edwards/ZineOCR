No Justice

In the latest instance of  
anti-justice, the Justice  
Department has told the  
Greensboro Civil Rights Fund,  
who is involved in fighting  
for justice for the people who  
were killed and wounded by  
Klansmen and Nazis in 1979,  
that their attorney could  
no longer represent them.  
This is another attempt by  
the JD to "continue the cover-  
up of government by silencing  
those who expose it."  
They are trying to do this  
to Attorney Pitts because  
he is “undergoing federal  
criminal investigation"  
stemming from the time he  
tried to bring evidence in  
front of the grand jury by  
knocking at the door and en-  
tering and asking to speak  
to the foreperson of the  
jury. They call this act in  
pursuit of an honest jury,  
"tampering with a federal  
grand jury."

Maxine Barry

A 79 year old great-grand-  
mother, Maxine Barry, from  
Fort Lauderdale, FL, rescued  
another woman who was being  
attacked, saying that she  
would "be more aggressive  
next time.” Barry, who stands  
5-foot-4, was the only one  
who tried to help Sylvia  
Feliciano, although others  
saw the attack. "I was on the  
ground and he was on top of  
me," said Feliciano, "all of  
a sudden this old lady ran up  
and started hitting him on  
the back, saying ‘leave her  
alone, leave her alone." He  
ran away fast. If it wasn't  
for that lady, I might be  
dead now."

Flights Stopped

In Los Angeles, CA, over  
fifty people turned a pro-  
test demonstration in front  
of the Mexicana Airlines  
offices into a victory cele-  
bration, when they learned  
that their struggle had  
forced Mexicana to stop its  
death flights--deportation  
of refugees to El Salvador.  
The first target was Western  
Airlines which was forced to  
stop taking refugees back.  
Then Mexicana took over,  
but with so many demonstra-  
tions in front of its offi-  
ces it also had to stop the  
flights.

OSHA Memo Leaked

A plan to eliminate pend-  
ing safety proposals and  
investigations was revealed  
Sept. 20 by an anonymous  
official who leaked an OSHA  
(Occupational Safety and  
Health Administration) staff  
memo. The confidential memo  
is not about whether to ter-  
minate rule-making proce-  
dures on exposure limits to  
116 dangerous chemicals, but  
how to do it. Among the sub-  
stances that OSHA is consi-  
dering for official neglect  
are the known carcinogens  
beryllium, cadmium, chromium,  
nickel, toluene and the cur-  
ing agent for plastic called  
MBOCA. The memo suggested  
that OSHA treat each sub-  
stance on an individual ba-  
sis because, "It is easier  
to tell the public or in-  
dustry that the agency is  
doing nothing on a substance-  
by-substance basis than to  
explain why nothing is being  
done on 116 substances."

Yesh G'vul

Yesh G'vul (There is a Li-  
mit) was founded a month af-  
ter the beginning of the war  
in Lebanon by reserve offi-  
cers and soldiers in the  
Israeli army who oppose the  
war and see it as senseless  
aggression. They have circu-  
lated a petition signed by  
1,700 reservists asking the  
government not to call them  
to military duty in Lebanon.  
Since that time 76 of the  
protesters have been court-  
martialed and sent to mili-  
tary prison for refusing to  
serve. US marines are kil-  
ling Lebanese people right  
now, and we must unite and  
support courageous people  
everywhere to stop this  
“senseless aggression."

Invasion Protested

Within days of the invasion  
of Grenada in Oct., 2 demos  
were organized here in Den-  
ver through word of mouth. The  
first was a picket in front  
of the Federal Building. And  
on Fri, the 28th, 200 people  
demonstrated with placards &  
signs in front of the Marri-  
ott Hotel where Ed Meese  
(press sec) was speaking.

9907/1000

In another earlier reve-  
lation about OSHA it was re-  
vealed that OSHA has refused  
to tighten the exposure li-  
mit for the pesticide ethy-  
lene dibromide (EDB) despite  
two studies that concluded  
that more than 990 out of  
every 1000 workers exposed  
to the maximum legal level  
would develop cancer. Since  
Reagan took office 33 months  
ago, OSHA has issued no new  
safety standards and has  
moved toward formally scrap-  
ping more than 100 proposed  
standards and investigations  
began before he took office.

Protests In Manila

Chanting "Marcos resign!"  
hundreds of thousands of  
Filipinos surged into the  
streets in a dramatic chal-  
lenge not only to dictator  
Ferdinand Marcos, but to US  
neo-colonialist domination  
of their country. The most  
massive protest occurred  
when half-a-million people  
gathered in Manila to demand  
Marcos’ resignation. The  
same evening, thousands  
marching on Marcos' Mala-  
canang Palace were met by  
police with guns drawn. Dem-  
onstrators set fire to po-  
lice barricades and fought  
with rocks and firebombs.

In the face of mounting mass  
protests, Reagan may not  
stop in the Philippines as  
planned during his trip to  
East Asia scheduled for ear-  
ly November.

Argentine Amnesty

As the US-backed military  
government of Argentina is  
preparing to return to civi-  
lian rule after seven-and-a-  
half years of military dic-  
tatorship, the junta issued  
an amnesty....not for poli-  
tical prisoners, but for  
military officials who have  
committed murder and torture  
against the Argentinian peo-  
ple during the years of mil-  
itary rule. Some 50,000 peo-  
ple demonstrated in August  
against amnesty for the mil-  
itary and thousands more  
have protested the decree  
since it was issued.

US Amnesty

Richard Helms, former dir-  
ector of the C.I.A. has just  
been given the National Se-  
curity Award by Pres. Reagan.  
Helms supposedly left the  
post "in disgrace” for having  
lied and kept secret the  
C.I.A.'s involvement in over-  
throwing Allende in Chile.  
Goes to prove Reagan's true  
feelings about the U.S.'s  
plans right now in Grenada,  
El Salvador, Nicaragua,  
Honduras, Guatemala, the Dom-  
inican Republic, et al and  
etc.

Budget Overkill

When it comes to finding  
money for food stamps,  
school lunch programs and  
job training, the Reagan  
administration is tight-  
fisted as Scrooge. But down  
at the Pentagon, they were  
giving it away. September 30  
was the last day of the 1983  
fiscal year, and there was  
still $4.2 billion unspent,  
anything left over would have  
reduced the overall budget.  
In one day, they managed to  
spend the entire amount on  
234 contracts with companies  
such as Honeywell and Boeing.  
Most of these contracts were  
signed without competitive  
bidding, so these merchants  
of death can name their own  
price.

Or Was That 59°

In summer arrive at the  
company earlier...for your  
make-up might run in hot  
weather..."; "It is not good  
to go to lunch with women  
friends all the time. When  
you are asked to have lunch  
with a male colleague, you  
should go with him, it will  
enrich your world". These  
excerpts are released from  
The Glossary of Common  
Sense For Considerate Office  
Ladies at the Sumitomo  
Shoji Personnel Department  
in Japan. Japanese women are  
now challenging the entire  
employment policy through  
a women's support group—the  
first time in Japanese his-  
tory. Women's earnings in  
Japan average only 53% of  
those of men and over half  
of Japan's companies stated  
that promotions are not pro-  
vided for women.

75 Years To Life

Judy Clark, David Gilbert,  
and Kuwasi Bakagoon were sen-  
tenced to 75 years to life  
for attempting to expropria-  
te $1.6 million for the  
Black Liberation Army from a  
Brinks armored car. This  
month Kathy Boudin and Sam-  
uel Brown go to trial for the  
same charges. The prosecuting  
attorney stated it would be  
a serious mistake "not to  
take these defendants at  
their word when they state  
that they are revolutionar-  
ies." Let them know we are  
everywhere and we will win.
