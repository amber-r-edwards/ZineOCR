Valerie Taylor used to write les-  
bian novels way back in the late 50's.  
Books like Whisper Their Love, The  
Girls in 3B, and Return to Lesbos,  
edited by men, had no more political  
statement than treating lesbians as  
real people. Which was, for that per-  
iod, a fairly radical concept.  

Her books from that period were of  
soap opera simplicity. Erica, the  
heroine of Journey to Fulfillment, is  
a war-shocked German orphan who finds  
peace and quiet in the calm arms of  
an older woman. Barby, the lesbian  
member of The Girls in 3B, can forget  
the Terrible Secret from her past  
(rape by a Prominent Figure in town at  
13) in the gentle arms of an older  
woman.  

A pattern seems to appear in these  
older works. Taken superficially,  
the heroine is always more pretty  
than not. She is usually raped or  
forced through lack of control over  
her life (via innocence or feelings  
of worthlessness) to experience sex  
with a man. Men are always animal  
filthy creatures in these early  
novels, particularly in the disgusted  
eyes of the lesbian protagonist.  

The "he done her wrong" theme is  
exploited fully in these books. The  
young girl who liked her girlfriends  
because they smelled nice or were  
quiet, is rudely introduced to hetero-  
sexuality and refuses thereafter to  
deal with men. Sometime after, she  
accidentally discovers lesbianism and  
thinks it's the most wonderful inven-  
tion since division of the sexes.  

She meets the woman of her dreams in  
the next chapter. If these were wes-  
terns, they would no doubt ride into  
the sunset together...  

During a lecture at a recent Les-  
bian Writers Conference held in Chica-  
go, she talked about her early novels.  
Male editors would re-write endings,  
characters, and situations to fit  
their stereotypes rather than the  
realities portrayed by the authors.  
Often authors of lesbian books were  
fortunate if they were allowed to  
have a “sympathetic lesbian," let a-  
lone a strong proud dyke.  

Now women have their own press.

Last Issue, You’ll Recall...  

Andrea Chesman  

(Editor's Note: Last month we ran  
most of Andrea's column but in our  
haste we left out the last thing which  
should have appeared on page 14. We  
apologize to Andrea for the omission  
and also to the readers who searched  
in vain for something that was not  
there. For the first 2/3 of the arti-  
cle toast to the last issue, Vol. 5,  
no.  

what no other women have done. It is  
not just the case of a woman Secretary  
of State battling successfully on the  
diplomatic front (Madame Nguyen Thi  
Binh against Kissinger in Paris!) or  

a peasant woman leading a victorious  
army (General Nguyen Thi Dinh, Vice-  
Commander-in-Chief of the PLAF). It  
is the example of millions of women:  
carrying forward a nation's production  
during prolonged wartime conditions,  

feminist presses.  

Culture  

of growing up Right On). Valerie Tay-  
lor's latest book, Love Image, is pub-  

lished by Naiad Press, a Missouri bas-  
ed lesbian press. There are changes;  

there is a difference.  

The new book is about a child star  
in the early 60's. The action is  
slick Hollywood, and Anne “Baby”  
McClure is making her last child pic-  
ture, soon to move into a sex symbol  
role, "Nanette," directed by Rubloff  
(producer, family friend, and iron-  
fisted career manager).  

On the night of Anne's 16th birth-  
day, she is raped by Rubloff, who is,  
at his best, the Pig's Pig. After the  
rape she is cared for and held by a  
young woman hired to clean after the  
party, a stranger.  

Sometime between her 16th and 17th  
birthdays, her mother warns her about  
"those kind of women" who get young  
girls in their clutches and do terrible  
things to them like men. A thrilled  
Anne adds “only much nicer” to the  
lecture and sets off to find other  
women. She embarks on a series of one  
night stands, eventually settling down  
and living happily ever after with the  
woman of her dreams.  

Valerie Taylor has an amazing  
subtle eye for detail. In a very few  
sentences, the reader knows Anne's  
lifestyle, her past, and her dissatis-  
faction with both. Her stories, sim-  
ple as they are, compel interest. Her  
characters become real people with  
individual histories and, beyond bas-  
ics, individual reactions to their  
situations. Her craft always earns  
respect.  

The Girls in 3B is a prime example  
of the art of Valerie Taylor. She  
follows the separate lives of three  
separate women in the Big City and  
there is no break in continuity with  
the jump from story to story.  

One main difference in the new book  
is its feminism. Anne knows who owns  
whom and how and why. The distinction  
is made very clearly between the power  
her mother has over her life and the  
power, the real power... the man Rubloff  

has over both of them.  

She understands her value as a  
piece of property, as a female piece  
of property, as a beautiful female  
piece. She recognizes it and her pow-  
erlessness to fight it. The only so-  
lution left to her is that of running  
away and giving up the career forever.  

Valerie Taylor's latest paperback  
dyke novel has much the same flavor as  
her earlier works, but it also shows  
a growth in feminism and awareness that  
could only have been allowed her in the  

ghetto by Jane Melnick  

building roads and bridges again and  
again, shooting down enemy planes and  
sinking warships, writing great poetry  
organizing, teaching, healing." This  
book, a series of interviews and  
sketches, belongs alongside Agnes  
Smedley's Portraits of Chinese Women,  
(The Feminist Press); it is a must for  
all American women.  

For a change of pace entirely, A  
Birth Account by Gladys Hindmarch is  
another powerful piece of writing:  
this time, three sketches about her  
two pregnancies and the birth of her  
child. Into the final sketch about  
the birth, she incorporates the rhythms  
of her breathing into the prose, break-  
ing down those boundaries between  
prose and poetry. This is a beautiful  
book.  

These six books represent a wide ra-  
nge of age and experience. One ex-  
perience they do not represent is the

HOT the PRESSES  

Andrea Chesman  

When Barbara Grier/Gene Damon of  
Naiad Press walks into a room she  
brings with her a tremendous amount of  
energy. She is very talkative, and  
very amusing. With Barbara one can  
talk about the past 20 years of the  
women's movement, and what it is like  
to come out at 12 and then build a  
life entirely among women. One can  
talk about the history of the  
Daughters of Bilitis or the history  
of The Ladder, a lesbian magazine that  
published until 1972. When I met  
Barbara she was in Denver, about to  
speak to the women's community on the  
history of the movement, and to raise  
money for Naiad Press. We, or rather  
she, talked mostly about Naiad, about  
literature and about life.  

"Six to eight months before The  
Ladder stopped publication, I had  
been in correspondence with some women  
in the East who had been Ladder sup-  
porters. They are much older women,  
(I'd say elderly, but that's not tot-  
ally accurate chronologically. They  
are only in their early sixties, but  
they seem much older because they are  
both physically ill, both heart  
patients). They had a dream of start-  
ing a lesbian feminist press and they  
wanted to do this for years and years.  
Since I was no longer to be involved  
with The Ladder, they asked if I would  
like to be the slave, the work person.  

The two women, Anita Marchant and  
Muriel Crawford, provided the seed  
money to start the press rolling.  
"They used their retirement money,  
even though they are physically dis-  
abled, which is an extraordinarily  
brave thing to do."  

In 1974, Naiad Press brought its  
first book out: Sarah Aldridge's first  
book, The Latecomer. "I did most of  
the editorial work and the promotional  
publicity work and everything. Then  
it just started snowballing."  

The next year they brought out  
Tottie and Cytherea's Breath by Sarah  
Aldridge and Speak Out My Heart by  
Robin Jordan. “It's a simple coming  
out story. The only unusual or dif-  
ferent aspect of it is that it is in  
journal form, almost like a play. And  
it is a little different, too, in the  
sense that she tells about taking her  
lesbian lover home to her very tra-  
ditional family, including her minister  
father. It has been a very popular  
book but it never had a good review.  
Not one. But the book has sold and  
sold primarily to young lesbians who  
might also be thinking in terms of  
coming out to their family."  

"We were lucky in 1976 to bring out  
A Woman Appeared To Me (a very romantic  
lesbian novel by Renee Vivien, a.c.),  
and then we brought out our only book  
that isn't in line with everything else  
we are doing. We brought out Lesbiana.  
Lesbiana is a collection of book re-  
views from The Ladder. And it was  
brought out simultaneously with the  
Diana Press edition of the three an-  
thologies from The Ladder... But our  
primary function is to publish lesbian  
fiction."  

"In 1977, we did not have enough  
money to put out four books, we only  
brought out two. I am very happy  
with these because our physical ap-  
pearance has changed. We are much  
more attractive, better looking,  
better bound, and everything about  
them is nicer. Tee Corinne did covers  
for us, beautiful covers, for Love  
Image by Valerie Taylor and The Muse  
Of The Violets, which is the first  
translation to English of Renee  
Vivien's lesbian poetry."  

A: “Is Sandia working on another  
translation of Vivien's poetry?"  

B: “Sandia has completed one entire  
volume of Renee Vivien's poetry for  
future publication by us. If we can  
only afford to do it - which she is  
aware of. Then you have a local  
author by the name of Gingerlox whose  
book Berrigan will definitely be  
coming out in 1978 from Naiad Press.”  

A: "Do you get many unsolicited  
manuscripts?"  

B: “About 250 a year.”  

A: "Do you read all of them?"  

B: "I have two women who I'm sure  
are masochists who enjoy reading all  

the manuscripts that come in. I read  
4 or 5 pages to determine if indeed it  
is a book. In other words, if the  
person can write, because there are a  
great many people who write who can-  
not write. We are unfortunately in a  
movement which says "Sing if you can  
sing, write if you can write", and  
that's good therapy but it's not neces-  
sarily good literature."  

"If there is any potential these go  
to one of the two women who read for  
me for free, for fun. They like to do  
it. And they are both ideal readers.  
They're both extremely bright women  
who are extremely ordinarily educated.  
They are both high school educated;  
They have no college. They both are  
well read and read for pleasure. They  
have done all the things that real  
readers do which is grow up reading  
Nancy Drew and graduate from heroic  
girl's adventure stories to idiot  
romances to gothics and gradually from  
some act in their brain become better  
and better readers as they wander  
around public libraries. So these  
women are, in effect, the audience we  
are looking for. Of course, they are  
lesbians. If I haven't said that it  
is because I live in a world peopled  
only by lesbians and it's hard to re-  
member that everyone in the world  
doesn't."  

A: "What kind of story is Naiad  
looking for?"  

B: "I don't see any reason to tor-  
ture oneself to death while reading.  
Do I dare pick on my two favorite non-  
writers: Violet Le Duc and Monique  
Wittig? Who write beautiful gorgeous!  
put together literature none of which  
I can bear to read. I can read it,  
but I can't bear it. And don't mis-  
understand me. I do not like soap  
operas. And I don't even insist on  
happy endings although I must admit I  
am alone in that at Naiad Press. But,  

of course I believe in happy endings...  

"Naiad books are all basically the  
same place. I'm very candid about it.  
They are schlock. They are meant to  
entertain. You're supposed to be  
happy while you read them. I doubt if  
they enlighten, but they sure make  
people who live in little towns all  
over the country write letters that  
would make you cry if you could read  
them.  

"It is easy to forget when you are  
in the middle of something that the  
vast majority of women for whom this  
movement exists, don't know we exist.  
The vast majority of women who buy our  
books by mail, or buy Olivia Records  
by mail are out there somewhere in god-  
forsaken-ville USA...  

"I'm an accident in the movement.  
That is, I believe very strongly in  
lesbians. I believe in life and I be-  
lieve in being very happy. There is  
a literary/cultural tradition of ennui,  
the French word for boredom and spirit-  
ual desolation. And there is sort of  
a romantic thing about putting the back  
of your hand on your forehead and say-  
ing, "Woe is me; life is so sad." And  
it's not just male literature. It's an  
idea that we are all supposed to be  
screaming in pain and outrage. And it  
isn't that I don't see that there are  
things wrong. I do. But the whole  
point to living is being happy and  
that's basically what I've been trying  
to do in Rue (her farm, ac.)... I want  
every woman everywhere to live every  
day happily. That's a very simple kind  
of way of looking at it.
