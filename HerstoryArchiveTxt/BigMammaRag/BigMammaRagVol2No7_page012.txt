High School Women:  
Denver Career Fair Sexist  

Becky Bohannan  

A Career Exploration Fair  

descended upon Denver March  
11-15. Its purpose was to give  
high school and junior high  
students a chance to discover  
what they want to do in life.  
The information booklet that  
was available to students stated,  
“Career education...will help  
you know yourself better. What  
are you like? What do you want  
out of life?” These worthy goals  
ended up on the floor of  
Currigan Hall along with soda  
cans, straws and papers to be  
swept into trash cans and  
eventually buried. For Explo ‘74  
as it was called, did not allow  
students to answer the question  
“what shall I do with my life?”  
But instead things went more  
along the line of, “Since I am a  
girl what shall I do?” and “Since  
I am a boy what shall I do?”.  

Little Effort  

Little noticeable effort was  
made to interest teenagers in  
any career outside their  
traditional roles.  

The information booklet  
students received was blatantly  
sexist. Throughout the booklet  
were sketches of persons in  
various occupations. On the  
front and back cover were  
construction workers, a taxi cab  
driver, a doctor and many others  
all of whom were male. Not one  
woman was on the cover. Inside  
the booklet women were  
depicted in the usual role of  
nurse, secretary, model,  
stewardess, and housekeeper.  
Possibly the worst sketch  
showed a woman standing on a  
chair, raising her skirt and  
screaming at a mouse on the  
floor. The sketch above it  
showed a man exterminating a  
bug. How are we ever going to  
successfully combat sexism  
when students are supplied with  
information such as this? At the  
fair booths and displays were set  
up with representatives from  
practically every imaginable  
occupation. I talked with people  
in careers traditionally occupied  
by men. All those I talked with  
were men and any pictures at  
the displays of people in that  
particular field were of men.  
This also held true for fields  
generally occupied by women. I  
first talked with a man from a  
large engineering firm, who told  
me that only three women at  
the Denver plant held positions  
other than secretarial work.

involved in becoming a certain

kind of engineer he replied,  
“Well, if you want to become a  
lab technician...” Of course lab  
technician is about the only  
occupation in the field of  
engineering that employs  
women to any extent. He then  
said only two “girls” had been  
by to discuss engineering with  
him and they were school  
teachers, one of whom was just  
collecting information to give to  
her class. He went on to say that  
usually when girls walk by a  
display that’s full of engineering  
equipment, they don’t know  
what it is so they're not  
interested. At the brick laying  
exhibit the man I talked with  
said no women were actually  
laying bricks but of course they  
did have secretaries. Three  
women had applied for a job  
though only one was called and  
she made no response and so  
lost it. When asked what he  
would say to a teenage girl who  
wanted to become a brick layer,  
he answered, “A lot of people  
think brick laying is just laying a  
brick but she’d have to be able  
to lift heavy brick slabs. And the  
language men use on the job  
isn’t always the best.”  

Men Entertained?  

Insurance is a more open field  
for women, according to the  
man I talked with. He said a  
number of women worked in  
each department but, only a  
couple were department heads.  
Few women were in his position  
though which was senior  
marketing representative. The  
reason he said was that married  
women don’t like to travel on  
business. I asked him if he was  
married. He said he was. He then  
went on to say that many men  
find it uncomfortable to be  
entertained by a woman on  
business. “But,” he added, “if  
you’re intelligent, we want  
you.” I asked two veterinarians  
how many women in the Denver

area are veterinarians. They  
started counting on their fingers,  
“Oh...two...three...who's that  
other girl...?” They finally came  
up with six definitely and  
maybe seven or eight. They  
admitted that it’s more difficult  
for women to get into Colorado  
State University’s veterinary  
school. But the situation has  
improved in the last few years  
with the number of women  
rising from three or four to  
twenty out of about ninety in  
the School of Veterinary  
Medicine. Many young women  
expressed interest in the law  
display. That field has opened  
up some in the last few years.  
One of the lawyers at the  
display was a woman. This was  
the only male dominated  
occupation that made any effort  
to reach young women. After  
experiencing so much sexism, I  
was extremely happy and  
surprised to learn that the  
Denver Women’s Resource  
Center had a table where  
information and counseling was  
available. Right next to it was a  
table with information on  
women's studies classes being  
held at various local colleges.  
This small oasis was a much  
needed respite from the sexist  
atmosphere at the career  
fair.  

Traditional Roles  

Few of Explo’s organizers and  
career representatives tried to  
reach students and interest them  
in occupations outside of their  
traditional roles. But even those  
that made an effort got little  
response (except law). It would  
have been possible to tolerate all  
the chauvinistic remarks and  
sexist displays if the students  
themselves had rejected it. But  
instead they did just the  
opposite. Young women  
crowded around the  
cosmetology, modeling and  
secretarial displays while the  
boys were at the engineering,  
construction and automotive

booths. The majority seemed to  
accept their traditional role with  
no noticeable rebellion. What is  
going to happen to this  
generation of teenagers? Will we  
be content with our parents’  
world and do nothing to change  
it? If this career fair was any  
indication, that’s exactly what  
we are going to do!  

Free To Be  

The career fair could have been  
a celebration of freedom. Free-  
dom to be what we want to be  
and do what we want to do  
instead of what society dictates.  
Unless teenagers are encouraged  
to break out of their roles, the  
majority of them are going to be  

content to stay where it's  
comfortable. Then just like  
many of their parents, years  

later they'll regret they didn’t  
do more with their lives. Explo  
'74 had the chance to be  
something great. Something  
never before done. Instead, it  
would have been better if it had  
never happened because now a  
few students who maybe were  
contemplating breaking out of  
their role have been reassured  
that such a drastic move is not  

necessary.

forces pounding away at the  
narrowness of U.S. medicine  
today.  

Working for these groups,  

researching and developing an  
even larger body of knowledge  
with which to change what is  
poor but keeping the best parts  
of medical knowledge, will  
continue to shape the medical  
care we receive tomorrow. Both  
the organization and the  
scientific content of medicine  
are open to challenge. If a  
women’s group develops a new  
idea (like vacuum extraction of  
menses) we should not just  
accept the discovery without  
question, but should keep our  
minds open to exploring both  
the positive and negative aspects  
of the new discoveries. By  
continual self-criticism and  
education we will revolutionize  
our health care and be ready  
with a better system if our  
government is ever replaced with  
a system in which better ideas  
can flourish. In this as in other  
areas of the Women’s  
Movement, knowledge is the  
first step toward gaining power  
to control our own lives. It is  
much more difficult for a doctor  
to treat you poorly if you know  
enough to ask pointed questions  
at the crucial time, or to  
recognize an omission or error.  
It is much more difficult for the  
legislature to pass poor health  
programs or prejudicial licensing  
acts if a large body of informed  
women is questioning their  
actions. It is more difficult for  
men to retain power in any area  
if we know how and why they  
attained that power or  
position.
