their own genitals in a mixed group,  
any more than I would have. Over and  
over at Girl Scout camps I have seen  
groups of girls unfold and grow strong,  
only to immediately revert to their  
traditional roles when we were forced  
into a mixed event. Even now many of  
us, if we look honestly, must admit  
that we become stronger or weaker,  
more defensive or less outspoken. Do  
the celebrations of women's strength  
and solidarity happen only for women  
above a certain age? It seems to me  
that part of the reason we are strug-  
gling is to give our daughters what we  
ourselves could not have—a chance  
to be together and strong. Several  
young women at the festival started  
petitions for boy-free space—at nine  
and ten they realized the importance  
of such space, and surely their voices  
should be heard above the rest of us.  
Mothers of Males (a group that pe-  

tioned and leafleted for a mixed child-  

care while at the festival) feel that  

Feminist men must support this concept,  
not only all of us who have been raped  
and abused—physically and mentally—  
but also for those of us who have been  
ridiculed and repressed. In other  
words, for all of us.

The assumption seems to be made by  
M.O.M. that all Jewish mothers are  
feminists, and are raising their sons  
as such. In male childcare I met  
several gently, aware little boys. I  
met an equal number who called me  
“chick,” made sexual innuendoes about  
me and the men there, and derogatory  
comments about the appearance of one of  
the women I was with. Granted, these  
boys need to be re-educated, but not at  
this festival. If we are willing to  
use girls' childcare as a classroom  
for non-sexist attitudes among young  
mates, we should be equally willing to  
ship in truckloads of men who also need  
educations—with ourselves as the  
teachers. No, this weekend is ours.

This does not mean that I think that  

it's important in raising feminist sons  
that they be allowed to see women work-  

ing strongly together. Is it not just  
as essential to explain the impor-  
tance of women's space, and to start  
instilling a respect for this idea?

Anarcha-Feminism From Pg. 19

barriers decreed by a patriarchal  
society. An affinity which is a  
revolutionary structure, both a col-  
lective and a family, created to en-  
gender both the personal and the poli-  
tical; the intimacy acquired should  
help rid women of any human domination.  
Embraced by common ideals and comple-  
mented by individuals, an organizational  
form in its ability to be both  
communal and autonomous is socially  
supportive, knowledgeable and demo-  
cratic. Potentially, a base on which  
to build a cooperative, free and non-  
hierarchical society, an anarcho-feminist  
affinity could be our contribution to  
an alternative network of anarchist  
affinity groups.  

In action, I am proposing the re-  
generation of alternative life in the  
community. Possibilities are innumer-  
able. Storefronts and vacant build-  
ings abound in New York City to be  
seized and transformed into collec-  
tives. So do human lives. As I see  
it, whatever is organized should  
make a material difference to the  
community. Alternatives within an  
anarchist context that could touch  

Coverage Criticized From Pg. 2

tator. From this information BUR  
managed to conclude that "The plan-  
ning committee has already deter-  
mined which workshops they would  
like to see presented and know what  
thrust that particular workshop will  
have."

A later paragraph dealt with  
racism:

The question was raised as to  
what the planning committee was  
doing to include minority and  
Third World lesbians in the con-  
ference. The planning committee,  
all-white lesbians, said they  
are now trying to figure out  
ways to reach minority women.

What really happened was that the  
issue was raised and the women on  
the planning committee who are doing  
outreach and publicity explained the  
steps they had taken so far. They  
asked for any other suggestions. A  
couple of women did offer sugges-  
tions for places to advertise the  
conference. No one had any sugges-  
tions that the committee had not al-  
ready considered. The committee  
was also criticized for doing out-  
reach toward rural women and not  
toward Third World women. It was  
pointed out that in many parts of  
rural Colorado the majority of the  
population is Chicano.

BUR's interpretation of this in-  
formation, that the planning com-  
mittee is "now" trying to figure  
out ways to reach Third World women  
is vicious, irresponsible and appal-  
ling. The conclusion BUR would ap-  
parently like its readers to reach  
is that no one connected with the  
conference had enough sense nor  
sensitivity to deal with racism in  
the lesbian community until the  
women of BUR, also all white les-  
bians, pointed out the issue. It  
seems to me that since no one in  
the lesbian community, including  

that is anything but top grade. I was  
distressed by some of the things I saw  
happening in the boys camp—constant  

snacking, apathy, and lack of supervi-  

sion—however, I think that these things  

upon the survival of women’s lives  
are countless to say the least. But  
here are a few possibilities: a women-  
controlled health center and abortion  
clinic undictated by paternal doctors  
and profits; a collective refuge for  
battered women or a crisis center for  
raped women, in both cases, to foster  
community self-help as opposed to  
state police, courts and prison sys-  
tems. Perhaps an anarcho-feminist  
non-violent social ecology group  
could be another possibility. Acti-  
vities, for that matter, could com-  
patibly affect the larger community  
such as a self-managed housing co-op,  
food co-op, craft or working co-op.  
If a small, communal and molecular  
anarchist affinity appeals to your  

feminist sensibilities, your revolu-  

tionary lifestyle and your envision-  
ment of a proliferating free society,  
please send an address and telephone  
number where you can be contacted as  

well as potential space and, if you  

wish, your thoughts and ideas to me,

BUR has come near the ultimate  
resolution to the issue of racism,  
we would accomplish a lot more if  
we recognized, supported and con-  
structively criticized each other's  
efforts.

In the last paragraph the arti-  
cle mentions that the overall feel-  
ing of the meeting was one of hos-  
tility and tension. The article  
neglected to mention that the hos-  
tility came in with and was gener-  
ally perpetuated by the BUR mem-  
bers and their supporters who at-  
tended the meeting. The rest of  
the last paragraph doesn't deserve  
a response.

It seems as though BUR was de-  
termined to trash this conference  
long before the community meeting.  
It looks as though the collective  
needed to come up with its own  
"facts" in order to justify the  
conclusions they wanted to reach.  
To me, that is the ultimate in ir-  
responsible journalism, and has no  
place in a feminist newspaper.

Four of the five collective mem-  
bers were present at the meeting  
and apparently none of them thought  
it was necessary to be accurate.  
Discussion and constructive criti-  
cism of the politics, policies,  
strategies, etc., of the meeting  
would have been quite appropriate  
if they had been based on some  
truth. Trashing the meeting is en-  
tirely inappropriate. Lesbians can  
get that kind of coverage from the  
straight press. At least with the  
straight press we know to be ex-  
tremely skeptical of their cover-  
age. We expect to be misrepresen-  
ted there. Now, unfortunately, we  
know we also have to be extremely  
skeptical of the coverage feminist  
meetings and events receive from  
BUR.

were due to poor organization, and  
were no more a political organization  
or plot than the fact that most of the  
toilets were full on the fourth day.

As such the solution is input and  
energy. I suggest definite shifts of  
women, closer communications with the  
main childcare people (this year men),  
a closer camp, and a series of work-  
shops and projects available for the  
boys.

I would like to add that I saw many  
of the same problems in the girls' child-  
care, and am making a similar set of  
suggestions for improvements to the  
We Want The Music Collective.

Ro-Care From Pg. 2

The third day of the festival, a  
group formed called Mothers of Males.  
We heard more stories; about a woman  
who drove out from Maryland, got the  
same reception (any dogs or male  
children?) she promptly turned a-  
round and drove back. She didn't  
know about the separate childcare.  
We heard from a woman who was breast-  
feeding her son and who had to argue  
with the Festival Collective for  
three hours before she was allowed  
to keep her baby with her. We  
heard about the “red alert" that the  
security women had been overheard  
doing on the radio: "male child in  
blue and yellow tent, site 5." Poor  
little devil was probably running  
around without his pants on, like  
about a third of the women there.

He got deported. There were rumors  
of boys "passing" on the condition  
that they kept their pants on. Some  
mothers were desperate enough to try  
this solution—degrading and scary  
for her and for her child.

Other facts: Of the four men  
who were doing childcare, two had  
been asked to do it the day before  
they came, and one was there only  
incidentally, because his sound  
system was being used and he had to  
be available in an emergency. This  
says to us that providing high qua-  
lity childcare for the boys was not  
a priority. Another example of  
this: one argument against letting  
dogs on the festival grounds is  
that “they might bite a little girl.”  
The dogs were running loose at the  
site of the boycare. Who cared if  
the boys got bitten?

Food for the boys arrived at odd  
hours—3 P.M. and 11 P.M. for  
lunch and dinner. This was because  
the food couriers were mothers who  
were going to check on their kids  
anyway. The Collective did not  
set up volunteers for food running  
or any shuttle service, though  
volunteers were recruited for vir-  
tually everything else. In other  
words, the burden was on the moth-  
ers. The mothers complained about  
this; on the last two days of the  
Festival shuttle service was set  
up with reimbursement for gas.

What this amounted to was that  
mothers were allowed to organize  

a shuttle service. We ourselves  
spent about $15 running back and  
forth on the 30-mile round trip  
before the shuttle service was set  
up, which was never reimbursed.  
There was also one incident at the  
site where a man was giving a two-  
year-old boy a ride on a motorcy-  
cle which fell over. The child  
lay screaming for about 5 minutes  

while the man checked to see if  

his motorcycle was okay. In fair-  
ness to the men, who did a super  
job under tough conditions with  
the 20 or so boys, this was one  
isolated incident. But it was  
enough to worry all the mothers  
about the safety of their kids.  
When we met with one collective  
member, she said that the situa-  
tion was not oppressive. She  
didn't understand what we were  
complaining about. Her attitude  
was common. But we know it was  
oppressive.  
Mothers of sons were oppressed:  
1. by having to miss a lot of the  
festival worrying about, trans-  
porting and checking on their  
kids. Mothers had to make a  
choice: be with their kids  
or be with the music.  
2. by having to spend money for  
gas to the site.  
3. Emotionally, many of the  
mothers at the meeting expressed  
the feeling that they were  
being "punished" for having a  
son. They were made to feel  
like they were second-class  
mothers, and that the least  
they could do to compensate  
for having a child with a  
penis was to spend all this  
extra time and energy on it.  
Most of us felt alienated  
from all the good energy  
there, angry and negative.

We had a hard time getting  
over this to enjoy the much  
praised "woman-energy." Some  
never did.

We began passing around a pe-  
tition that said simply that we  
were not satisfied with the col-  
lective policies on male children  
and wanted to begin a dialogue  
with them to change it. About  
500 signatures were collected.  
Most of the mothers felt that  
what they wanted was to have  
their kids with them—to be able  
to share women's culture with  
their sons as well as with their  
daughters since kids get enough  
of the patriarchy anyway. The  
mothers want a separate camp-  
site on the festival grounds  
where they could be with their  
kids and listen to the music,  
even if the boys could not go to  
the entertainment. This was a  
compromise based on two things:  
1) that enough women and little  
girls wanted a women-only space  
that they, being in the minority,  
had to respect that, and 2) that  
if their little boys were allow-  
ed to go to the entertainment  
and wander around the site, they  
would certainly get a lot of  
hate and hostility (remarks a-  
bout a three-year-old boy's  
"prick hanging out—we don't  
want to see that") would be  
common and hurt their child's  
feelings. So the separate camp-  
site is a reasonable compromise  
that the Mothers of Males and  
their supporters want to see  
next year if there is another  
Michigan Women's Music Festival.  
In closing this letter, we want  
to just point out how ridiculous  
and unnecessary all of this is.  
An eight-year-old child who is  
outnumbered 400 to one should  
not threaten grown women. Boy  
haters often justify themselves  
by saying that they want to put  
all their energy into women  
(preferably lesbians). We say  
this is bullshit because boy-  
hating policies make women suf-  
fer. Mothers at the Michigan  
Women's Music Festival lost a  
lot of that good women-energy  
by worrying about their boys  
15 miles away. To respect wom-  
en, you respect mothers no mat-  
ter what sex their child is.

We urge mothers and others  
who disagree with the We Want  
the Music Collective's policies  
on male children to write to  

them at: 1501 Lyons Street,  
Mt. Pleasant, Michigan 48858.  
The collective says that there  
aren't enough mothers with male  
kids to change their policy,  
since many mothers simply do  
not go because of the policy.  
Our voices need to be heard.
