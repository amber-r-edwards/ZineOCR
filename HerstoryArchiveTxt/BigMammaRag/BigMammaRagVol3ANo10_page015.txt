talk religion or politics.  
Feminists are political. Once  
politicized though, whores are  
unstoppable. They'll die for a  
cause. They have nothing to  
lose.

BMR: You come across as a very  
strong feminist. Is there a  
problem for you balancing the  
two?  
MSJ: Sure. I have to fight the  
feminists sometimes who see it  
as such exploitation. They have  
to realize with this attitude they  
are continuing to view women  
as sex objects. I'm charging for  
my time, I'm well paid, and it’s  
not unpleasant. The women’s  
movement must accept us as  
equals. We're the scouts, we're  
behind the front lines in the  
smoke-filled rooms.

our house near 17th and Gaylord.  
Expenses are about $120.00 each  
month, including food. Call Brian,  
Bill or Kate at 321-0370.

Margo St. James is a gutsy  
woman who wields a lot of  
power in her ever-widening  
circle. When asked what kept  
her from turning in some  
hypocrites in high places who  
could be instrumental in her  
cause, she drew herself up to  
her full height and answered un-  
waveringly, “my integrity.”

The Lily Tomlin benefit has  
been cancelled due to circum-  
stances beyond the control of  
Big Mama Rag and NOW. Sorry  
folks, we're as broke about it as  
you are.

lack of race consciousness that  
stopped them from being able to  
work with the JLDF but the  
fund's inability to recognize  
sexism as an issue and see  
feminism as a political issue. It is  
presumptuous to apply our per-  
sonal experiences to another  
community of feminists and  
damn them for their inaction  
according to our standards.
