Beaten By Police

NEW YORK, NY-- Gloria Spector, a
woman who was beaten in front of at
least a dozen witnesses by New York
City Police over an alleged traffic
violation, was arraigned August 16th
on charges of parking illegally,
driving without a license and resist-
ing arrest.

Spector, who claims she is inno-
cent of the charges, was in Greenwich
Village last July waiting for her 13-
year-old daughter outside of an
animal clinic. She was parked, with
her motor running, in an illegal
zone.

James Ferguson, a witness to the
scene, said that two police officers
approached and told her to move on.
As Spector began to move her car
forward, the light turned red and she
stopped her car again.

The same two officers, Ferguson
says, then came up to Spector's car
and demanded to see her license and
registration. When she asked them
why and told them she hadn't done
anything wrong, Ferguson says they
yanked her keys from the ignition,
and pulled her from the car.

Ferguson says the officers then
smashed Spector's head against the
roof of the car when she protested and
started screaming for help.

Ferguson says that at the police
station, Spector was knocked around,
beaten, kept in handcuffs, and inter-
rogated for three-and-a-half hours.
She was allegedly promised freedom
if she signed a blank piece of paper.
When she demanded her rights,

Spector reports that one police offi-
cer told her “Don't tell us about
your rights. We’ll tell you all
you need to know."

Spector claims she had a current
driver's license in her wallet which
was removed when her handbag was con-
fiscated at police headquarters. She
has been charged with driving without
a license.

After spending nine hours at the
police station and consistently
protesting her arrest, Spector was
taken to Bellevue Mental Hospital,
in an attempt by police to prove
her insane. She was judged competent,
however, and released.

Spector's attorney, Neil Zang,
reports that his client has pleaded
not guilty to all charges. Zang
says a preliminary hearing on her
case will be held this week.

Zang said that Spector is consider-
ing filing a civil damage suit
against the New York City Police
Department and the two arresting
officers, charging them with police
brutality and violation of her civil
rights.

Affirmative Action

WASHINGTON, D.C.-- The U.S. Supreme

Court has given its nod of approval

to the largest and most far-reaching

affirmative action settlement ever
obtained by the federal government.

Only five days after they handed down

their very mixed opinions in the

Bakke case, the Justices declined to

review a challenge to the government’s
landmark 1973 equal employment agree-
ment with the American Telephone

and Telegraph Company (AT&T).

The AT&T agreement, reached via
consent decree, is the largest court-
ordered settlement ever made in an
employment discrimination case.
Negotiated by the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and
the U.S. Departments of Justice and
Labor, and revised by a supplemental
order obtained in 1975, the agreement
covers some 700,000 Bell System
employees, and provides $150 million
in back pay, salary adjustments,
promotions and other compensation.

Under the 1973 agreement, which
expires in January 1979, all Bell
Companies must establish employment
and promotion goals, and set annual
intermediate targets for the full
utilization of underrepresented em-
ployees in each of 15 job classifi-
cations. If any Bell company is un-
able to reach or maintain these tar-
gets, the settlement requires that it
depart from normal selection stand-
ards--including seniority--for employ-
ee promotions, and select instead
women and minority group members
who are at least "basically quali-
fied." This provision called an
“affirmative action override,”
applies only to promotions, and does
not affect competitive seniority
for layoffs or rehires.

The appeal which reached the Sup-
reme Court was initiated by three
unions representing Bell System
employees. The Communications Workers
of America, the International Brother-
hood of Electrical Workers, and the
Alliance of Independent Telephone
Unions intervened in the consent

decree and challenged the affirmative

action override provision on the
grounds that it interferes with their
collective bargaining rights and
agreements in violation of Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act and the due
process clause of the Fifth Amendment.
The unions also argued that the
settlement imposes illegal quotas
and that the affirmative action remedies provided go beyond permissible
relief for identifiable victims of
past discrimination.

The unions’ challenge was rejected
in U.S. district court in 1976,
and in 1977 by the Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit. In declining
to review the Third Circuit's holding,
the U.S. Supreme Court technically
set no national legal precedent. The
Court's action in the AT&T case
strongly indicates, however, that the
Justices agree that preferential
treatment for women and minorities
is necessary to offset the effects
of past job discrimination.

Depo Provera
In the Third World

NEW YORK, NY (LNS)-- The Upjohn
Company is currently trying to legal-
ize its dumping of Depo Provera on
women in Third World countries even
though the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-
istration in March refused to approve
use of the potentially carcinogenic
contraceptive in this country.

Friends of the drug company are
now testifying before a House sub-
committee considering a bill which
would allow export of drugs that have
not been approved by the FDA. Export
of such drugs is now prohibited.

Depo Provera is the only long act-
ing injectable contraceptive present-
ly in use. It is proven to cause
protracted bleeding, malignant breast
tumors in laboratory animals, blood
clots, headaches, and vomiting. Women
taking Depo Provera develop cervical
cancer-in-situ, a localized cancer
that eventually spreads, at up to
nine times the national rate.

According to Upjohn, the only Depo
Provera manufacturer, women remain
infertile for at least six months
after they stop receiving injections.
Other studies show that 24 percent
of all women remain infertile for
at least one year after they stop
receiving injections, and often
permanently.

Depo Provera has already been test-
ed on half a million women in Third
World countries, and Upjohn would
like to see the experimentation con-
solidated into regular sales by the
pending legislation. Upjohn is one
of the bigger U.S. drug companies,
with annual sales in the billion-
dollar range.

The largest-scale experiment has
been conducted in Thailand, targeting
national minority mountain women
traditionally discriminated against
by Thai military governments. In
neighboring Malaysia, the drug recent-
ly surfaced and women there have
evidence to trace it to a donation by
the Rockefeller-funded International
Planned Parenthood Foundation.

In addition to boosting profits,
widespread Depo Provera dumping
follows the prevalent government
theory that population increase fuels
revolution in the Third World.

Depo Provera is exported to 69
countries as part of a U.S. population
control program and many nurse
trainees are taught about Depo Pro-
vera in the U.S.

For instance, the University of
California at Santa Cruz trains nurse-
midwives from Africa and Asia through
its Extension program. The program
integrates family planning and
mother and child health, and the

A Salute to the Velvet Hammer

Fran Day and Crystal Arp

The Velvet Hammer Bar celebrated
its second anniversary Friday, Sept-
ember 1 with a gala evening marked
by entertainment, dancing, and food.
About 275 women enjoyed the lively
atmosphere surrounded by new improve-
ments such as a large gold-veined
mirror which highlights the dance
floor.

Linda Ryan and Linda Foley origin-
ally opened the bar on September 1,
1976 in a rented portion of an
already existing bar on the west
side of Denver. They soon decided to
move to a larger space in a more
accessible location. So on July
15, 1977 they re-opened at 3759
Chestnut Place. The new building

features ample parking, a spacious
kitchen, comfortable atmosphere and
an attractive interior. The decor
consists of hanging plants, stained
glass, and women's art (displayed
and sold with no commission for the
bar).

The Velvet Hammer has demonstrated
its support of women's issues
through numerous donations, benefits,
and posting of information. Key
among these was the generous offer
of the bar as collateral for bail
for the Bluebird Five. Other support
includes benefits for BMR, Rachael
Yaseen, East Metro Denver NOW, Lesb-
ian Mothers Defense Fund, and dona-
tions to the Women's Festival, NLFO,
Woman to Woman Bookcenter, and Mary

Jo Rischer Defense Fund. They have
supported many other organizations

as well as individuals needing assist-
ance. Future plans include benefits
for the Charlotte Peterson Defense
Fund, Gay Community Center, and the
Woman to Woman Halloween Auction.

The Velvet Hammer opens at 5 p.m.
Tuesday through Sunday. It is easily
accessible by bus #12 down Downing.
Call the Velvet Hammer at 534-9329
for more detailed directions.

We are looking forward to the new
menu featuring Mexican food, non-
alcoholic drinks, and a sandwich bar.
We commend the Velvet Hammer and the
two Lindas for their dedication. We
encourage women to come out and have
fun at the Velvet Hammer.
