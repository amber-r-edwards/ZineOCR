Women in Prison

Dear Mama:

Enclosed is a letter from a girl
friend of mine, who is in prison in
Kentucky State Corrective Center for
Women. Would you please publish this
letter? Her name is Judy Wood, Box
1696 Pee Wee Valley, Kentucky 40956.

It would be appreciated very much.
Sincerely,
Joe

I would like to make a public ap-
peal to any concerned citizens. A
new policy has been instituted at the
Kentucky Correctional Institution
for Women. This new policy was in-
stituted by the Associate Superinten-
dent for Custody and allows male cor-
rectional officers access at any time
to female dormitories without requir-
ing the presence of a female correc-
tional officer. Because of the poli-
cy, which is a gross invasion of ev-
ery woman's privacy at the Institu-
tion, these male officers are coming
into the sleeping and bathing facil-
ities alone. The only stipulation is
that at the beginning of the shift,
they inform the women that they will
be entering these living areas.

Several embarrassing and unnecessa-
ry incidents have occurred because of
this policy over the past 2 weeks.
Approximately 2 weeks ago, the Asso-
ciate Superintendent, who happens to
be a male, was making the 9:45 count.
When counting B dorm, he stopped at
the bathroom door and asked how many
residents were in it. One resident
answered, "2," to which the Associate
Superintendent replied, "I can't hear
a voice, I have to see a body." He
then entered the bathroom and had the
resident come out of the shower so
that he could count her.

The second incident also involves
the Associate Superintendent. Last
Friday night, he walked to the honor
unit, which is commonly called the
Staff House. At the Staff House, the
atmosphere is almost like a regular
home with bedrooms all on the second
floor of the building. After gaining
admittance, this man walked around

the first floor then went upstairs to
the bedroom area. He was not accom-
panied by a female officer and was
alone in the house with the women.
All the women present at the Staff
House at that time were dressed in
their nightgowns.

The third incident to be cited now
occurred at approximately 2 am one
weekday morning. A male correctional
officer who works the 12 to 8 am
shift came into the first floor of
the Staff House. A female officer
was with him but left him alone when
she went upstairs to count. This
male officer went into the living
room of the house completely unan-
nounced and very badly frightened and
embarrassed the resident sitting
there alone. This living room is not
similar at all to the dayroom areas
on the dormitories due to the relaxed
atmosphere of the Staff House.

The Associate Superintendent has
stated that his officers have the
right to go anywhere in the Institu-
tion, but does this man and his offi-
cers have the right to destroy the
last remaining bit of modesty that
these women have left? It would be
understandable if these male officers
were entering these areas if they
thought some Institutional rule was
being broken, but that is not the
case. This is a flagrant misuse of
authority and is stripping every wo-
man of the pride and modesty she has
for her own body.

After several complaints from the
women here, the Associate Superinten-
dent amended his policy only to in-
clude the living areas in the main
building. These areas include 2 dor-
mitories holding 35 women each, the
hospital and annex area holding 21
women each, and the 3rd floor holding
16 women. These areas hold the ma-
jority of the population. While this
embarrassing situation has been al-
leviated at the Staff House and Cot-
tage, it is still occurring in the
living areas of the main building.
These male officers are continuing to
come into the dormitories and bathing
facilities without announcing them-

We Mean No Harm

I must say that BMR gets progres-
sively more disappointing each month.
Nothing relevant or even of interest.
I am turned off by socialist politics
...knowing from years in the C.P. how
completely male-based they are, and
it pains me to see good positive wom-
en's energy turned to what I see as
divisive draining and dull men's ap-
proach--it's nothing personal, really
...it just hurts me to see it.

I also, or rather, along with that,
I found the October 76 cover really
vicious and incomprehensible--although
I am confident that Stacey will make
good use of it. Why in the world are
you so hostile to these lesbians?
They mean you no harm and have ex-

Dear Sisters:

Your October cover is beautiful--
and so is the sister featured thereon.
Could we know who she is? Such class
deserves at the very least a life-
time sub to 'Tross.

...We have the picture in a frame--
it used to be over the desk in the
old house but a friend (of ours ob-
viously, not yours) convinced us that
it would be kickier to have the frame
over the commode so that's where you
are in our house--it's very odd.

If we ever get it together we will
have our official photographer...
take a picture of a collective mem-
ber sitting on the thing reading
‘Tross while your picture looks down
on her....We are giving as gifts
several copies of the issue...to
friends across the country so you
will no doubt hang in bathrooms of
'Tross fans from coast to coast...
The idea was so fine and we were so
very pleased--we hope to meet you one
day and will feel sure we know you —
