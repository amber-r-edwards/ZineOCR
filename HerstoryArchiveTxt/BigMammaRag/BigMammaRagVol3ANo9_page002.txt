Grand Jury vs. Veronica Vigil

The

Denver Chicanas Harassed

Dorothy Child and
Clare Strawn

Across the country women in
feminist communities are
being subpoenaed by Federal
grand juries. Realizing the
ineffectiveness of F.B.I.
investigations and conspiracy
trials, the government is now
resorting to another repressive
measure — a nationwide
grand jury network to coerce
information from movement
people under threat of jail. One
of the primary objectives of the
grand juries is to stifle dissent
and intimidate people involved
in movement organizing.

Locally, Veronica Vigil, a
strong Chicana, has been the
latest focus of
harassment as the U.S.
government employs its latest
tool against El Movimiento
Chicano. It is difficult to second
guess the government's
reasoning whether it
condescendingly believes it is
attacking the weaker links in the
chain or whether it is beginning
to understand that women have
been an unrecognized source of
strength in all resistance
movements, but an undeniable
pattern is coming to light. The
government is singling out
women in its attempts to gain
access to the Chicano(a)
movement.

Harassment

Over a year ago six people
were subpoenaed by a federal
grand jury “investigating” the
1974 Boulder bombings which
resulted in the death of “Los
Seis (the six) and the
permanent injury of Antonio
Alcantar. Five of those
subpoenaed were women, the
other was Veronica Vigil's
common law husband. None of
them talked. Using what is
becoming a common tactic, the
government waited a year to
resume active, visible,
involvement in this process.
Hoping that they had waited long
enough for the mobilized
support to have dissipated, they
began active harassment of
Veronica Vigil who was to
become a symbol of Chicana
resistance. After repeated F.B.I.
harassment of her family,
friends, and employer, on July
21, 1975, Veronica Vigil was
contacted by F.B.I. agents
Melvin Fleming and Robert
Bishop. The agents asked her to
answer some questions.
Veronica stated that she had
nothing to say to them and
closed the door in their faces.

The next day, she was served a
subpoena commanding her to
appear as a witness to give
testimony before a second grand
jury “investigating” the 1974
bombings in Boulder.

Contempt

On August 19, 1975, Veronica
appeared at the Federal Court
House in Denver. After motions
to quash the subpoena were
denied, she was brought before
the grand jury. This particular
grand jury is composed of
sixteen members, none of whom
is Chicano.

Without the aid of counsel,
and in secret session with the
grand jury, Attorney General
Terry Wiggins asked Veronica
questions concerning her past
association with Los Seis de
Boulder as well as other matters.
She met all questions with
refusal, based upon several
Constitutional rights. It was then
claimed that her Constitutional
rights would not be violated if
she answered the question and
Judge Arraj demanded that she
answer or be held in contempt of
court. Later, she was granted
use immunity by the court. Use
immunity can be granted to
someone without one
requesting it and against one’s
own desire. It compels you to
testify, with the promise that
whatever is testified to cannot
be used against you in any way.
But the fact is that you can still
be indicted by the grand jury if
some independent evidence
(other than your own testimony)
comes to light. Veronica again
refused to testify.

Veronica now faces the threat
of being held in jail for the rest of
this grand jury (11 months). If a
new grand jury is impaneled or
the life of the grand jury is
extended she faces an additional
18 months. Altogether, Veronica
faces forty-seven months in jail
for her refusal to testify.

Comment

Veronica Vigil has been
accused of no crime. The Grand
Jury is a coercive as well as a
punitive device. This kind of
intimidation is being used
throughout the country: in the
feminist movement, the war
resistance, and in Colorado in
the Chicano movement, just for
a sampling.

It is clear that it is the United
States government who finds
the people contemptuous. On
September 18, Veronica's
hearing on the appeal was held.
As is common government
operating procedure, it is trying
to define our reality for us. The
attitude from the central judge
(there were three) was one of
general disrespect and
arrogance. The setting is
arranged as a clever weapon in
warfare, “The people,” pleading
their case before the judges, are
looked down upon both from
location as well as in attitude. The
environment is designed
deliberately to dwarf the
defendants.

Psychologically it was good
that the courtroom was packed
to hear the appeal argument. It is
good that the government knows
it cannot play all of its
underhanded tricks in private.
One of our best weapons is to
expose and embarrass the
government and its lack of
integrity.

A word to people who attend
future political trials: you hurt
your case by entering late. It
shows disrespect for the
defendant's lawyer, causing
unnecessary disruption, and
attention to be taken away from
the defense’s arguments. The
lack of respect, and the
arrogance and smug snickering
attitude of the judges in that
courtroom on September 19th
needed to be countered by a
stronger show of solidarity.
Straggling in late did nothing to
help Veronica’s case.

It was obvious that the judge
chose to have us believe that he
did not take us seriously. The
deck is stacked in his favor and
he seemed a bit too comfortable
with this fact. If we let him, he
will determine our reality for us.
He is trying. Veronica Vigil
claims ‘marital privilege’ as one
reason for not testifying. The
judge sits back and coolly says
prove it: “The government has
not conceded that a common law
marriage existed.” When
Veronica's lawyer, Ruth
Buechler, claimed electronic
surveillance, the inefficiency of
the bureaucracy called
government became obvious.
The law states that when
charges of electronic
surveillance are made of the
government, the government
must be answerable. The issue
is: must the government
produce concrete proof or is a
mere denial sufficient? It seems
the government is reluctant to
divulge what agencies are using
electronic surveillance, or
perhaps the government is
unable to prove or disprove its
use since its bureaucracy is so
hopelessly large and entangled.
The judge asked Ms. Buechler
how he should run his
government. He asked how the
government should disprove
such a claim. Perhaps it is a
clever tactic, this guise of
incompetence... or perhaps it is
simple truth... either way it is
frightening to be in the hands of
either fools or scheisters. To
paraphrase the judge:
“Obviously the government
couldn't know about illegal
wiretapping, could it?” Again,
the burden of proof is on the
defense rather than the
government.

If for some reason the F.B.I. or
the grand jury knocks on your
door, one recourse you have is to
call the Boulder Defense
Committee 492-6571 or the
National Lawyers Guild 320-

too.). If you wish to share energy

easily become reformist in its
definition. There are certain
safeguards we have attempted
to build into our clinic policy
which, in reality, we realize will
be difficult to accomplish and
will be accomplished only
through ongoing political
struggle and awareness. We
understand that our major
energies must necessarily go
into the delivery of health
services. On the other hand, our
vision for this clinic has been
evolving for three years. It is a
vision which includes struggle
against the system, and not
assimilation into it. It is a vision
which includes struggle against
racism, classism, heterosexualism
and ageism, in addition to
the obvious struggle against
sexism. Therefore we have built
into our policy the kinds of
“rules” which we hope will keep
us constantly aware of that
vision in the midst of daily
routine delivery of low-cost,
quality health care to our clients.

We will have regular and
frequent clinical/paramedical
training sessions, sharing our
individual skills collectively; we
will learn to speak Spanish,
because we understand the
importance of communication.
