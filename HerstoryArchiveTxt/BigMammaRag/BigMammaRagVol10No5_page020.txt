from page 21 Where We're At from page 2

Africans in America can
spend $5-10 to be packed into
fire-traps to shake their
bodies down to terra-firma,
but not $2 to help a woman
keep her children out of the
hands of "the system"—even
if you are among those who
think we deserve whatever
the penal system cares to
dish out to us, would you
also say we forfeit the right
to Motherhood? The right to
expect our children to re-
main ours? Over 50% of in-
carcerated women are losing
their children and I for one
will say to all those enter-
tainers, poets, writers who
never tire of praising the
strength and beauty of Afri-
can women that if you are not
also about foregoing a few
of your Botany 500 suits,

or I really should
say some of the officers mess
with you and they pull your
room or just anything to get
their revenge. I had a pri-
vate room and without any
reason at all I was given a
direct order to move to 46.

I had to give up my private
room to come back in the dorm
with 10 women. At first I
refused to come to camp 46
and I was told if I did I
would be put back in the dorm
and busted back down to C.
custody. I just got here to-
day and really don't have any
comments as of now. I'll be
writing more later.

in order to help me feed my
children, then your words
are empty and an affront to
not only me, but to your own
mother who no doubt was list-
ening to Mr. "B" croon about
her beauty while she was on
her knees scrubbing those
folks' floors in order to
raise you. I beseech African
women in and out of prison
to speak up and let's not
shame those wonderful women
of the 30's and 40's who in
the face of much more extreme
deprivation than we are
facing, showed themselves to
be women among women beyond
a doubt! Otherwise we cert-
ainly would not be here to-
day. It’s time for us to
talk...at least.

about the
cover artist

Suzanne Jackson is an art-
ist living in California.

I learned not to be afraid
to expose myself through my
art. I love nature, animals,
children, spirit, love and
myself as a woman. If within
my work the symbols reflect
my upbringing, my environ-
ment, my cultures and espec-
ially my femininity—that
is simply and everything of
beauty and value that I want
to do.

I basically believe that
my existence as a black wo-
man artist making a living
at what I love is itself a
political statement. I am a
peaceful person and in this
time that seems to be poli-
tical and in conflict with
what is this real world.
--Suzanne Jackson

told those underground to stay out of the peace-loving women's

Emma Goldman said, "History tells us that every oppressed
class gained true liberation through its own effort." Prisons
and psychiatric institutions are the tools the government
uses to take us out of the struggle.

SS — oe

We have some good articles on this theme for next month. We
decided to spread the theme over two months mainly because we
don't have the money to pay for a larger issue (we don't know
where the money's coming from for this one) and because
it will help us immensely to have that issue set up as much
as possible. We have a lot to do next month. Among things
happening is the International Conference on Psychiatric Op-
pression, May 14-18, which Lori is going to, the People's Fair
on May 22 & 23 and then the Anti-Repression Conference, (if you
need a place to stay or have space to share let us know) on
May 29 & 30 (both of which we're all going to). Time and energy
will be spread thin, but we hope to see at least some of you
there.

Don't let all this discourage anyone from sending letters and
action. Getting mail is always a welcome experience and we—

‘re still open to considering more articles for next month.
Copy deadline is early though, May 10th.

Speaking of articles, if you sent one in and haven't heard
from us, it's probably because we are still considering print-
ing it at a future date. We just haven't written to tell you,
in general correspondence tends to get backed up around here,
but hang in there, we'll write you eventually.

In the category of things we need is a adding machine that
prints the figures as they're punched. Also, May 9th, we'll
be silk screening for the People's Fair, if you're interested
in helping or learning (we'll probably have some good food
there too) write that date on your calendar, 2-5. Call for the
location.
