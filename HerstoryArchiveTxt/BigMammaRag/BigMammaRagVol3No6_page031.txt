WOMEN’S COFFEEHOUSE!
Every Sunday evening at 1031 E.
Colfax. 7:00 P.M. Get together
with sisters.

The offering circular of the First
Women’s Bank is available by
writing to the bank at 111 East
57th St., New York, N.Y. 10022.

The annual convention of the
National Educational Associa-
tion voted in Chicago in favor of a
resolution including sexual
orientation as a characteristic to
be protected against discrimina-
tion. This means the organiza-
tion, which has 1.4 million
members, is committed to
fighting discrimination against
gay teachers. (Advocate, Aug.
28, 74).

A campaign by several national
organizations, among them the
National Gay Task Force and the
National Organization for
Women, has begun to get the
U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service to stop
discriminating against
homosexuals. The Immigration
Code presently excludes per-
sons ‘afflicted with ... sexual
deviation’ (Sections 1182 and
1251 of the Code, Section 8) (Ad-
vocate, Aug. 28, ‘74).

Judas complained in ‘Jesus
Christ, Superstar’ that ‘Israelin
4 B.C. had no mass com-
munications,’ so the word about
spiritual transcendence reached
only a few.

No more. Mass communica-
tion has exploded today's
spiritual movement into a New
Age.

Using this as an impetus, the
Women’s Liberation Coalition at
the University of Colorado’s
Boulder campus has produced a
viable body of women to deal
with the opportunities that the
New Age offers in plenty.

“Media and Com-
munications” is a committee of
and for women learning power
leadership potential and com-
munications skills.

Because leadership involves
far more than strict intellectual
disciplines, the committee seeks
personal and societal con-
sciousness expansions through
contact with spiritual, emotional
and physical areas of human
endeavor as well as intellectual.

Bringing women to the public
eye through media coverage is
only one ongoing plan of action.

Other works in progress in-
clude the compilation of a com-
prehensive resource file of
women leaders and
organizations in the
Denver/Boulder area.

Out of this will arise Woman
Survival Workshops for the spr-
ing semester.

Liberation Coalition office, UMC

Boulder, Colo. 80302.
