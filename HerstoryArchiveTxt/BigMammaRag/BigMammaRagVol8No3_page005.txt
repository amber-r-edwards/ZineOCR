“Honor” Crimes  

Laila Shikhani Nakouz interviewed  
different women for her recent study  
of “honor crimes" in Lebanon, in  
which women who betray the "honor" of  
their family or tribe are killed.  
Said one woman: "A young woman's sta-  
tus in oriental society is pitiful  
indeed. If she falls in love, her  
brother gets angry. If she marries  
the man of her choice, her father  
will reject her. If she is seduced  

by a dishonest man, the members of  
her family hold counsel by which  
they decide to wash their honor with  
her blood."

Fired On  

The Paris feminist bookstore, des  
Femmes, was completely burned out  
in the fifth such attack in three  
years. A group called the Alliance  
of Women Against Abortion claimed  
"credit" for the attack. des Femmes  
plans to reopen.

Feminist On Trial  

Taiwan's leading feminist, on trial  
for sedition, charged that investiga-  
tors threatened to make her strip  
naked, and showed her a picture of an  
executed convict to get her to sign a  
confession. Lu Hsiu-Lien was one of  
eight staff members of the now sus-  
pended political magazine, Formosa,  
who were accused of conspiring to  
overthrow the Nationalist Chinese  
government by force.

Peep Show Payment  

The city of Chicago agreed March  
26th to pay $69,000 in damages to 191  
women who were stripped and searched  
by police officers after arrests for  
such minor offenses such as traffic  
violations and smoking on the subway.  

The ACLU had brought suit against  
the Chicago Police Department for the  
practice of forcing women who were  
arrested to remove their clothing for  
searches, while men arrested were not  
subjected to routine strip searches,  
resulting in sex discrimination and  
harassment. "The strip searches have  
consisted of a direction to women to  
disrobe, squat several times, and to  
spread their cheeks and vaginas for  
visual inspection by police," the com-  
plaint read.  

Get It in Writing  

The first sexual harassment case to  
be heard by the New York State Courts  
has been settled out of court. Doreen  
Romano sued her former boss for  
$100,000 after she lost her job as  
a typist because she turned down an  
offer for a raise. The raise had  
stipulations, however: her boss had  
typewritten on company stationery a  
demand for a sexual liaison with him  
in return.

Blame the Victim Game  

A woman trucker has sued Chevron  
USA for $5 million after being fired  
from the company “for her own good"  
following a rape and beating. The  
woman's attorney is charging that male  
victims of crime have not been termin-  
ated by Chevron. The lawyer says the  
woman would not have been raped if the  
company had provided her with the mech-  
anical assistance for her vehicle that  
male employees receive.

Disarming Rapists  

With rape reaching intolerable  
proportions in Italy (16,000 were  
reported last year), Italian women  
have formulated a plan of action  
against violence by proposing a new  
law which will be brought before  
Parliament by popular initiative.  

The law, proposed by the WLD (Women's  
Liberation Movement) and then adopted  
by other feminist groups and news-  
papers, contains 21 articles, start-  
ing with the legal right of the  
women's movement, as a whole, to  
serve as the plaintiff in a criminal  
trial. Also proposed is the introduc-  
tion of a single legal proceeding  
brought against a group involved in  
an act of violence against women, in-  
stead of each person being tried  
separately, as the case is now.

Women Will Not Obey  

Thousands of women recently battled  
police outside the British House of  
Commons while legislators debated pro-  
visions that would tighten Britain's  
abortion laws. The fight erupted,  
says the San Francisco Chronicle, af-  
ter a group of women were evicted  
from the Commons public gallery for  
interrupting the abortion debate. The  
women had unfurled a banner declaring  
"Women will not obey your bill" and  
shouted down anti-abortionists.  

Demonstrators marched on the Houses  
of Parliament when they learned of  
the evictions. Police formed a chain  
to keep them out, but the feminists  
forced their way in. Three women were  
arrested inside the House and several  
more outside.

Justice for Now  

The Supreme Court denied a request  
by the Justice Department to postpone  
a US District Court judge's ruling  
that the federal government must re-  
sume funding of all medically neces-  
sary abortions for women on welfare.  
The Justice Department had asked the  
Court to stay the decision pending  
appeal of the case. HEW has now  
issued orders that payments be re-  
sumed for Medicaid-funded abortions,  
pending the Supreme Court's final  
decision.

Yes We Can Can  
Defeat the Con Con  

Tennessee recently became the 16th  
state to call a constitutional con-  
vention for the purpose of defeating  
the 1973 Supreme Court decision leg-  
alizing abortion. A week earlier, a  
convention call was defeated in West  
Virginia which did, however, pass a  
"memorial" asking that the US Con-  
gress pass an anti-abortion amendment  
to the Constitution. Thirty-four  
states must approve a convention call

Arch Disease  

The United Way of Southeastern Pen-  
nsylvania has denied Women's Way, a  
coalition of six feminist agencies,  
membership in the organization be-  
cause of an agreement with the Cath-  
olic Archdiocese of Philadelphia  
which says that United Way will not  
fund any program or service that is  
in serious opposition to the moral  
teachings and principles of the Cath-  
olic Church. Specifically objected  
to was the inclusion of the Eliza-  
beth Blackwell Health Center which  
provides abortion services and  
CHOICE which provides contraceptive  
counseling and abortion referrals.

Bare Facts Exposed  

Three women face trial April 8th  
in Hartford, CT for an act of civil  
disobedience which occurred in a lin-  
gerie shop called Bare Facts which  
had advertised a 'Men's Night' at  
which women were to model skimpy  
nightwear while customers were treat-  
ed to free champagne. Further invest-  
igation by Women Against Violence  
revealed that Bare Facts had a back  
room called the Fantasy Room, in  
which were available chains, dildos  
with metal spikes and paperback books  
with such titles as Whippings For a  
Wicked Wife. The three women were  
arrested and jailed for eight nights  
after they had poured blood around  
the entrance to the Fantasy Room, on  
the merchandise and on a female man-  
nequin while demonstrators outside  
carried signs reading "this is the  
blood of raped and battered women."

Big Mama Rag Vol.8 No.3  

Smash Windows  

One hundred twenty-five people  
protested the anti-feminist, anti-  
lesbian film Windows in Madison on  
March 8th. They successfully prevent-  
ed one showing of the film when 35  
protesters stormed into the theatre  
chanting, "No more victims, no more  
lies" and "Porn is the theory, rape  
is the practice" and demanded to see  
the manager of that downtown theatre.  
The manager agreed to stop showing  
the film, however the sign in the  
window read that "the film would not  
be shown because management could not  
guarantee the safety of patrons and  
staff."

A Natural Act  

New York City's public TV station  
WNET is experiencing a wave of pro-  
test over its refusal to air a lesbian  
film by lesbian filmmaker Jan Oxenberg,  
as well as its decision not to air  
three other films about third world  
people, workers and the women's health  
movement. A Comedy in Six Unnatural  
Acts by Oxenberg was selected for  
viewing in WNET's “Independent Focus"  
series, a showcase for the work of  
independent filmmakers, by a peer re-  
view panel. In addition, 27 other  
films were selected for inclusion,  
three of which were later rejected,  
along with Oxenberg's Comedy. Oxen-  
berg said, “It was something of a  
‘coincidence’ that all four of the  
films that were eliminated from the  
series were very controversial polit-  
ical films."

Bigots On Parade  

A national March on Washington for  
“righteousness and morality" has  
been set for April 29, 1980. The  
March, known as both "Washington for  
Jesus" and "One Nation Under God",  
may have very serious implications  
for lesbians and gay men, as well  
as for other members of human rights  
movements. "Washington for Jesus"  
appears to be gaining widespread sup-  
port in the fundamentalist Christian  
community. Literature indicates that  
their goal is one million persons  
for the event.

Abreast of the Times  

A New York physician who practices  
in Brooklyn reports that one of his  
patients is now six years old and  
doing fine, after being breast-fed  
as an infant-- by her father.  

Dr. Wollman says the helpful dad  
was able to share the breastfeeding  
duties with his wife after taking  
hormone treatments which enabled him  
to produce milk.  

The Lesbian Difference  

Beverly Hoeffer of the University of  
California at San Francisco's School  
of Nursing says, yes, kids of lesbians  
are different from kids of straight  
women. She found that 40% of the sons  
of lesbians tested using the "Sex Role  
Concept Scale," scored as sex type  
feminine, meaning they were gentler  
and more concerned with other people's  
feelings than other boys. None of the  
sons of straight mothers did. Fifty  
percent of the daughters of lesbians  
scored as sex type masculine, with  
stronger qualities of leadership and  
outgoingness; again, none of the  
daughters of straight women did.
