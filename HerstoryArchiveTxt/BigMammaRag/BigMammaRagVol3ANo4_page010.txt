Woman’s Evolution from  
Matriarchal Clan to Patriarchal  
Family, by Evelyn Reed. Path-  
finder Press, Inc. (Paperback;  
$4.95)  

Annie Zeigler  

A much needed anthropo-  
logical study of the institution of  
the family and the interactions of  
men and women in society,  
Woman's Evolution is as  
tantalizing as Mothers and  
Amazons or The First Sex. With  
thorough documentation, which  
draws from many traditional  
academic sources — as well as  
from sources which are less  
acceptable to the vested  
interests of established  
tradition, Ms. Reed states a case  
for the original matriarchies in a  
logical and imaginative manner.  
Used as a basic anthropology  
textbook in women’s studies  
programs, Woman's Evolution is  
nevertheless written in an  
engrossing style that makes it  
hard to put down.  

Ms. Reed primarily talks about  
primitive cultures which have  
been studied in contemporary  
times. She convincingly  
undermines the assumptions of  
early (male) anthropologists  

about male-female, parent-  
child, and sibling relationships,  
pointing out the unmistakable  
biases written into much theory  
by patriarchally oriented  
anthropologists. She  
reconsiders the powerful taboos  
of cannibalism and incest by  
breaking through our  
unconscious assumptions about  
both. She suggests, for example,  
that primitive hunters could not  
recognize as members of their  
own species other hominids, or  
even their own offspring (here,  
of course, we are referring to  
male hunters).  

As killing and eating other  
species cannot be called  
cannibalism, so elaborate  
taboos sprang up over time as  
members of one primitive  
grouping made blood pacts with  
others. Ms. Reed talks about the  
nurturing and civilizing force of  
women, inventors of weaving,  
art, music, cooking, discoverers  
of fire, institutors of social and  
cultural custom, and protectors  
of the young from the  
competitive and hungry males;  
and she discusses the groups of  
cooperating and mutually supp-  
ortive females that lead to the  
preservation of human life and  

culture.  
In addition to providing  
valuable information, Ms.  

Reed's book serves another, and  
even more important function:  
for it evokes a vision of a culture  
that is free of many of the evils of  
patriarchy. She does not,  
however, advocate a return to  
the far-from-utopian  
matriarchal clan structure. More  
realistically, she discusses the  
economic and technological  
conditions that make various  
societal structures the best at a  
given time. And she stresses the  
need for us to discover a new  
organization — for she is  
convinced that patriarchy is no  
longer valid or even possible for  
these times. And she reminds us  
that times of change are painful  
and alienating, as human beings  
find themselves with new needs  
and old and inadequate means  
of dealing with them.  

Woman's Evolution from  
Matriarchal Clan to Patriarchal  
Family, which is available at the  
Big Mama Rag office in the  
Women’s library, is an excellent  
source of information and a  
useful starting point for  
reorganizing many of our hist-  
orical assumptions.

Pat Parker's  
Child of Myself  
and Pit Stop  

Janet Sergi  

When I asked Wendy of The  
Woman's Press Collective, if she  
had any ideas about racism for  
this issue, she said she had one  
small question, Why did they get  
loads of reviews for all their  
works except Pat Parker's  
poetry? Was it that white  
feminists were so afraid of saying  
one “wrong” word that they  
would rather ignore a black  
woman's work than risk being  
called a racist? Wendy went on to  
say Pat has read to every type of  
group, church, school and bar  
and yet still isn’t reviewed. To  
render a woman’s work invisible  
to the larger woman’s communi-  
ty is covert racism and much  
worse than an “incorrect”  
review. An interview with Pat is  
on page 5 of this issue.  

Pat’s poems come “from the  
cavities of bones / spun from  
caverns of air.” Her poems are  
written in the plain, but deeply  
felt style of The Woman's Press  
Collective. Each poem doesn't  
mystify or obscure a woman's  
reality, but highlights its  
meaning.  

In English Lit.,  
they told me  
Kafka was good  
because he created  
the best nightmares ever —  
I think I should  
go find that professor  
& ask why  
we didn't study  
the S.F. Police Dept.  

In Child of Myself she writes of  
her youth:  

“you were a mistake”  
my mother told me  
ever since I've been  
trying to make up.  

fought my way thru  
first grade  
defending my right to  
wear cowboy boots even if  
I was a girl which no one  
had bothered to tell me  

that the real hang up  

was something called  
virginity  

which I had already lost  

2 years ago to a really  

hard up rapist that I  

never could tell my  
parents  

about, not really  
knowing what  

had happened but somehow  

feeling it would not be  
to my advantage.  

In Pit Stop, powerful imagery  
comes across complemented  
with many good graphics and  
photographs. The caption above  
a picture of Pat’s friends after a  
dyke baseball game reads “I like  
your friends / they are real  
people / not phony-like your /  
sisters’ friend.” She tells of the  
many trips laid on her. She has  
had a white lover.  

And when we go to  
a gay bar  

& my people shun me  
because I crossed  
the line  

& her people look to  
see what's  

wrong with her —  
what defect  

drove her to me —  

She is black.  

My hands are big  
& rough  
like my mother’s  
my innards are twisted  
& torn  
like my father’s  
my self is  
my big hands—  
like my father’s  
& torn innards  
like my mother's  
& they both felt  
& were —  
& I am a product of that —  
& not a political  
consciousness.  

She is a black feminist.  

Have you ever tried to hide?  

In a group  

of woman  
hide  

your black self &  

her white mind  
SISTER!  

your foot’s smaller,  
but it’s still  

on my neck.  

She wants to break the chains  
of all people’s oppression and  
does not know how.  
how do I break these  

chains  
to whom or what  

do I direct pain  
black — white  
mother — father  
sister — brother  
straight — gay  

In Pit Stop “the anger spills  
over” / our animalism is  
showing / Let's drink to our  
shame. Her suicidal drinking is  
put into the perspective of her  

oppression.  

When I drink  

I scream  

I fight  

I cry  

I don't  
do these things  
when I’m sober.  

so far,  

my friends  

think the  

solution  

to my being  

a problem  

is for me  

to stop  

drinking.

Album Released  

Olivia Records has released  
their new record, Meg Christian:  
I Know You Know. The  
production of the record was  
delayed for several months by  
difficulties with mastering labs  
and pressing plants. “We had to  
reject their work seven times.  
They refused to take us seriously  
and insisted on giving us  
products which were noisy,  
scratched, and in general  
detracted from the high quality  
of the music.”  

“We have learned that a small  
women’s record company must  
replace clout with persistence —  
that is, until women can control  
the entire process of making a  
record.”

The Last Days  
of ‘Mary Stuart’  

Kathleen O'Brien  

Grass doesn’t grow on a busy  
street or in concrete either but  
occasionally a sturdy flower will  
wind its way persistently  
through the cracks of solid  
sidewalks blooming alone and  
unspoiled. So it is with “Mary  
Stuart” by Wolfgang  
Hildesheimer presented by the  
Third Eye Theatre. In a time  
when so much tripe passes for  
entertainment and/or  
information “Mary Stuart” does  
both and more.  

Hildesheimer’s work is more  
like a psychological study than  
an actual play. We are shown  
Mary, waiting for death and her  
desperate attempts at  
rationalization, and her Court;  
those who pull, poke, prod and  
hover vulture-like offering no  
comfort, just waiting greedily for  
Mary to parcel out the last of her  
jewels and treasures.  

The scene (there is only one)  
opens as Mary the victim is  
drawn to the place of her ex-  
ecution. There she is rewarded  
by a surprise meeting with the  
Chief Executioner (or Butcher)  
and his apprentice. Mary has  
decided that her death is merely  
a step in passing on to saint-  
hood and the nine choirs of  
angels, “Waiting is a martyr’s  
destiny,” and refuses to leave.  
Their ensuing tête-à-tête is  

macabre at best and chilling, as  
Mary, wild-eyed and slipping in  
and out of reality, wants to hold  
the axe and feel the blade and  
Jack relishes his anecdotes of  
past executions.  

In the classical sense it is not a  
play because there is no conflict  
and we are all aware of the  
outcome. It becomes then a  
vehicle for character roles and  
interaction. It is perhaps one of  
the best such vehicles for a  
woman today, the part of Mary  
Stuart being challenging and  
difficult. Vesta Garcia has some  
really fine moments as Mary the  
deranged, but falls just a trifle  
short of what is needed to carry  
the mood for two hours. Pat  
Mahoney is marvelous as Jack  
Bull the Executioner, combining  
just the right blend of pr-  
ofessional detachment and  
Protestant chauvinism.  
Accolades also to Mike Franco  
as the Queen’s Apothecary and  
Harold Aarons as the faithful old  
servant, Didier. Anyone  
interested in Elizabethan attire  
will find the costuming exquisite  
and authentic.  

All in all, in this day of orgiastic  
sex, violence, and shoot-em-  
ups, Mary Stuart stands head  
and shoulders above most of  
what's happening and is well  
worth the admission price.

Colorado Springs’ Circle One  
Women’s Health Service  

Publishes New Guide  

Barbara Hume  

“Women were the first  
physicians.” And a couple of  
Colorado Springs women,  
Elizabeth Campbell and Vicki  
Ziegler, have edited a book  
which is a significant step  
toward reclaiming our bodies  
from the modern male medical  
mess.  

Circle One: a woman's begin-  
ning guide to self health and  
sexuality, is 44 pages of feeling  
and fact which do indeed offer a  
good beginning to women’s self  
health and sexuality. But why  
add more words to the millions  
printed already each day in this  
country? Isn't there a long  
enough bibliography on sexuali-  
ty already existent in the English  
language and Our Bodies Our  
Selves is an excellent book on  
women's health written by and  
for women. Unfortunately most  
of the words written on female  
sexuality more truly express the  
male sexual attitudes and  
perversions of the male authors  
and of the few women who have  
written about woman’s sexuali-  
ty, fewer still have been free of  
the oppressive influence of their  
male colleagues. One good book  
by and for women about  
women’s health is great, and  
more good books is greater.  

The unique contribution of  
Circle One is that it concisely  
covers some of the territory  
covered in Our Bodies Our  
Selves and adds more good  
information on self health, pelvic  
exams, breast cancer and an  
especially good section on  
masturbation. Some of the  
information duplicates other  
good sources and some is new,  
but all is put together in a short  
easy to read in an evening form  
that lends itself to self growth  
and sharing with others.  

The book is so good that it is  
tempting to ignore the weak  
points. These points should be  
considered though if we are to  
learn from each other and also  
since a couple of them might be  
misleading. For instance, the  
section on the pelvic exam  

includes a note that the step by  
step explanation is intended to  
be learned in a group situation.  
Yet it would be nice if parts of it  
were clearer just from the text  
for those readers who do not at  
this time have access to a group.  
For instance parts of a speculum  
are discussed but with no  
picture to label the parts the  
names may be meaningless to  
some. The procedure itself is  
hard to follow by reading it  
through the first time, but would  
be a great help to read at home  
after a group to reinforce  
learning.  

Perhaps a graver error is the  
section on midwives which  
rightfully recognizes the efforts  
of midwives working outside the  
established medical system, but  
fails to recognize the great  
strides made by nurse-midwives  
working from within to topple  
the male from his artificial place  
in childbirth. The statement  
“Only a few states have license  
laws that permit the practice of  
nurse-midwifery, and then only  
under medical supervision” was  
partially true as recently as 1973  
but is completely misleading  
today.  

Another problem is presenting  
some treatments too superficial-  
ly for the woman who does not  
have access to further  
information. The use of yogurt in  
the vagina is a controversial  
treatment which certainly needs  
more research but is also  
probably more effective and  
certainly less harmful than  
many of the pharmaceutical  
nightmares offered women by  
dollar hungry giant corporations.  
Since the treatment may be used  
by many women, it would be  
nice if Circle One included  
specifics of how to insert, how  
much to insert, how often to  
insert, and, most important,  
what kind of yogurt since many  
of the commercial preparations  
have most of the good bacteria  
killed before the product is
