JBAKC Flyer  
from page 3  

In Nice Jewish Girls: A  
Lesbian Anthology (Perse-  
phone Press), Evelyn Torton  
Beck discusses the relation-  
ship between anti-Zionism  
and anti-Semitism. She also  
notes: "The degree of public  
and private hatred unleashed  
onto Israel seems far out of  
proportion to what Israel  
has actually done (in com-  
parison to other countries,  
such as England, France,  
Belgium, and the Soviet Un-  
ion--whose right to exist-  
ence is not questioned.  
(193-194)  

It is very difficult to  
understand how any group  
concerned with oppressed  
peoples as the JBAKC claims  
to be could fail to feel  
some sympathy for the desire  
of Jewish people for a home-  
land--unless it is out of  
ignorance of the history of  
the oppression and destruct-  
ion of Jews or out of anti-  
Jewish bigotry. It is strik-  
ing that while the JBAKC  
says it fights against fas-  
cism and the Klan, nowhere  
in the flyer is it even men-  
tioned that Jews have been  
and remain a constant scape-  
goat and victim of fascists,  
Nazis, and the KKK.  

It seems crucial to us  
that opposition to the fo-  
reign and domestic policy

of the state of Israel  
(which is not being defen-  
ded) and support for the  
Palestinian people not be  
used as a cover for anti-  
Jewish bigotry.  

A letter by a group of  
Ashkenazi Jewish lesbian/  
feminists in the May 29,  
1982 issue of Gay Community  
News discusses the anti-  
Semitic aspects of anti-Zi-  
onism and the destructive  
nature of the position that  
opposition to racism re-  
quires opposition to Zion-  
ism. To take the position  
that a commitment to anti-  
racism/imperialism requires  
an anti-Zionist stance is  
an outrageous denial of the  
reality of many Jews and  
non-Jews who are very ac-  
tively anti-racist and im-  
perialist and who also sup-  
port the right of Jewish  
people to a safe place in  
this world.  

What is especially puz-  
zling about all of this is  
that in the very same issue  
that includes the JBAKC's  
flyer there is a letter  
from Elly Bulkin criticizing  
the BMR collective for fail-  
ing to include a strong cri-  
tique of the anti-Semitism  
of a Christian lesbian group  
--Sisters United. In res-  
ponse to Bulkin's criticism  
Lori Bradford (for the BMR  
collective) wrote: "Anti-  
Semitism is a serious issue,  
is life-threatening to too  

difficult to read, tiny copy of black ink on red, red  
paper, and the further inaccessibility of the language,  
then on to the contents... 1) The omission of anti-Semitism  
is blatant anti-Semitism in practice 2) The dangers of  
single issue organizing in relationship to anti-Klan work-  
again the omission of any mention of attacks by the KKK  
on Jews as well as on lesbians and gay men. 3) And then  
for us as feminists the difference in how we define the  
enemy--as imperialism and patriarchy vs. imperialism.  

We offer this examination of our process not to make ex-  
cuses for it but rather to open it to the process of  
criticism/self-criticism, to be able to learn from our  
mistakes and in turn to be able to have our politics grow  
and develop. Thanks to all who help us in this area.  

In Struggle--for sure.

many and must be confronted  
along with racism as it hap-  
pens."  

In light of the expressed  
commitment of BMR to con-  
front anti-Semitism and the  
fact that the connections  
between anti-Zionism and  
anti-Semitism have been dis-  
cussed in feminist writings  
such as the two mentioned  
above, we are shocked that  
BMR included the JBAKC flyer  
without comment.

Some Ideas Changed  

Dear Lori - BMR:  

I do hope you read this  
letter and can print it in  
the next issue of BMR. I was  
sorry to miss the last an-  
nual anti-psychiatry confer-  
ence. I was in New York  
getting evicted from a sub-  
let apartment. I wasn't rea-  
dy to move on.  

Now I am. I am on a moun-  
taintop in West Virginia  
preparing to do some tarot  
readings for some friends.  
Just before I left the city  
Jenny came down to see me  
after Toronto and told me  
BMR had published my narra-  
tive on institutionalization  
and walked with me over to  
Djuna books to pick up a co-  
py--I was glad to see it, as  
I thought perhaps you had  
gotten turned off by my last  
note saying do what you want  
with the article, but know-  
ing something is going to be  
printed often keeps me alive.  

This one I had mixed re-  
actions to--first, an uneas-  
iness about being "out" in  
the women's movement as an  
ex-; and secondly, changes  
I have gone through since I  
wrote that piece nearly a  
year ago. I am asking you to  
print this letter because I  
feel I have a political res-  
ponsibility to cast a posi-  
tive image of overcoming op-  
pression. That article I  
wrote ended on a down note,  

"I developed a passive de-  

pendence on him..." (the  
male psychiatrist who both  
hired me as a consultant to  
research effects of institu-  
tionalization--which led to  
the writing of that paper--  
and who had previously com-  
mitted me).  

Besides ending on a down  
note, there were a few gaps  
of consciousness. I am writ-  
ing to point those out not to  

-Val Vaughan/BMR  

attack you, or to defend my-  
self, but because I feel  
there is some political pur-  
pose in the clarification.  

First, the article says  
that my first book (Curious  
Courtship) was only reviewed  
in "just a few women's  
papers." I criticize myself  
here for having that consci-  
ousness -- the men's papers  
are where it is important to  
get reviewed, as that is an  
interaction in a community  
of like-minded people. Want-  
ing to get a radical femin-  
ist critique of socialism  
reviewed in either the bour-  
geois press or the left cir-  
cuit was false consciousness  
on my part. It is important  
that people read the book  
for whom it has meaning. Not  
seeing the essentiality of  
the women's press was my  
fault.  

Second, the article says  
I was "accused of being a  
lesbian" in the institution  
by male inmates. This is  
false consciousness, too --  
as if "lesbian" was an epi-  
thet. It looks like when I  
was writing this article I  
still internalized a neg-  
ativity about something I  
was to try to become as a  
point of pride.  

In fact, I want to write  
here something of the con-  
tent of the ending of my  
second book Pictures of  
Patriarchy which South End  
will publish in the fall if  
all goes well. In it I talk  
about institutionalization,  
and being made to fit into  
the contours of the sex role  
-- and how coming out as a  
lesbian and getting involved  
in politics again and parti-  
cularly women's spirituality  
was the only way to turn it  
over -- to throw off the op-  
pression that had been  
thrust deep inside of me  
through the psychological  
rape of the institution. I'm  
not writing this just to  
plug the book, but to com-  
municate to women who read  
BMR that there is another  
step beyond passive depen-  
dence on men in institutions.
