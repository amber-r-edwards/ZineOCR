Dissolution: Six Denver Women’s

Jane Hoback

The Women's Movement, Denver, 1979  
--The Colorado Feminist Federal  
Credit Union folded. The bookstore  
and Big Mama Rag continue their cycle  
of struggle, revitalization, struggle.  
The Velvet Hammer shut its doors.  
Collectives are dropping like flies.  
Nary a whisper was heard on Inter-  
national Women's Day. A measly 250  
people, many of them Iranians, turned  
out to hear Kate Millett speak about  
women fighting for their rights and  
their lives in Iran.

What's wrong with this picture?

In a variation on women-in-the  
street interviews (some I talked to  
on the phone, some in person. Some  
I chose because I knew them, some  
because I didn't), six women talked  
about why they think the movement in  
the Denver women's community is at  
an all-time low.

Many offered theories with familiar  
strains: the economy, the conserv-  
ative turn the country as a whole  
seems to be taking, the lack of  
crises or issues we can rally around,  
unresolved questions of race and  
class in a predominantly white, mid-  
dle class movement.

But the best answers, and perhaps  
the most valuable ones, come from  
these women's personal experiences in  
our community: what they are doing  
as a result of or in spite of or may-  
be even to cause what's happening  
here. And why.

Because, abstract analysis aside,  
what's wrong with the picture comes  
from how it affects us personally and  
how we affect it. It is individual  
women, after all, who are the series  
of dots that form the picture.

Our experiences and our activities  
are different, of course. Few of us  
are full-time revolutionaries. But  

much of what these six women had to  
say became a familiar refrain after  
a while. We are either broke or our  
more active pursuit of our careers  
has made us too damned comfortable.  
We are tired of fighting the same  
old battles and getting nowhere.

Our internal squabbles often destroy  
us and we have no Iran, no Briggs  
initiative to make us forgive our  
differences.

Several of the women were frus-  
trated about not being able to de-  
pend on the feminist community,  
those women who, as one woman said,  
"should know better." What really  
bothers me," said the woman, a  
school teacher, “is the lack of sup-  
port for feminist projects. And  
I'm not talking about non-political  
women. It's the ones who are al-  
ready politicized and should know  
the bookstore is sagging and needs  
help."

Deirdre Reilly had the same, al-  
beit more blunt, indictment. "Dykes  
in this town are more interested in  
wearing a new hat than in getting  
involved in a political event and  
I'm pissed off about it. That seems  
real to me. What's worse is that  
those women used to look down on  
other women for the same thing. But  
because they're doing it now, it's  
okay.”

Vicki McConnell calls it "select-  
ive feminism. This is a white, mid-  
dle-class movement. If things get  
rough or if we get tired, we can  
always fall back on our privilege."

And in a community where the num-  
ber of politically active women is  
small at best, the loss of even one  
of our number hurts. After years of  
up-to-our-ears involvement, burnout  
may be inevitable. But these women  
see no droves of new women coming in  
to replenish the community. And we  
are to blame, they said. Unless  
there's a crisis, we make paltry  
efforts at outreach. And even dur-  
ing a crisis, the outreach is min-  
imal.

An Aurora woman complained the  
women's community is defined more by  
its geographical boundaries than by  
the women who participate in it.

"Everything happens in or near  
Capitol Hill so everybody who lives  
there may know about it. But I may  
not. There's no outreach to other  
areas. And there are a lot of  
women out there,” she said.

But if those situations are bad,  
something more insidious and des-  
tructive characterizes the Denver  
community, according to several of  
the women. "I get really sick and  
tired of the gossip and the trash-  
ing in this community. It never  
seems to die. I've made some bad  
mistakes. Everybody has. We can  
change, we can be sorry. But we  
just can't seem to forgive and for-  
get," the Aurora woman said.

Worse, said Crystal Arp, we gossip  
rather than confront each other  
about our problems. She has seen  
groups and projects she's been in-  
volved in torn apart because of it.  
"If women don't like a certain per-  
son or people in a group, they  
won't have anything to do with the  
whole group. They don't want to  
hear the other side or talk directly  
to the people involved: I really  
think they'd rather hear the rumors.  
What I see happening is the same  
thing women get accused of all the  
time--backstabbing."

For a few women, another part of  
the problem is some sort of purist  
insistence on total political  
agreement.

"It is this whole attitude that  
we have to agree on 100 percent of  
our politics or we're not going to  
get along or work together. We  
can't talk to each other because we  
disagree on one percent. I just  
can't deal with that anymore.  
There's too much to do," the school  
teacher said.

It hasn't been enough, however,  
to make her give up, to make her  
quit. But it has for others.  
Crystal, tired of “beating my head  
against a brick wall all the time,"  
has dropped out of any political  
involvement in the community for  
at least a year. “I'd like to find  
a group I can work with where we  
can get things done, but I'm just  
not emotionally equipped to fight.  
I have to do that every day in the  
establishment."

But Crystal and all the other  
women insist their political dir-  
ection and identification hasn't  
changed. If their commitment  
hasn't changed, sometimes their  
participation has. Vicki, for  
example, is a writer first these  
days. For too long, she feels, she  
sacrificed her art for political  
activity. "Now I'm writing first.  
But I'm also redefining being a  
writer in terms of that being a  
political contribution too."

Deirdre also has done some per-  
sonal redefining. She's not doing  
as much as she used to. But she's  
doing it better. "I'm learning not  
to get in over my head, not to  
over-extend myself, so I can give  
the most to the movement. And I'm  
more effective now."

Partly because of her frustration  
over the state of the community,  
but partly too because of her job,  
the school teacher contemplated  
dropping out or cutting down on  
some of her feminist activities.  
"I'm a lesbian and I can't be out  
on my job at all. I become schizo-  
phrenic almost to the point where I  
can't do it anymore. But I need  
the strength I get from feminist  
activities.” And she still feels  
good about the community. Personal  
relationships with individual  
women have been rewarding, she  
said, “although groups can be frus-  
trating. But I've got a lot of  
feminist energy and I'm going to  
use it.”

So the news isn't all bad. Most  
of the women feel the community is  
worth saving, worth risking dis-  
agreements and time and energy on.

Perhaps even more heartening is  
that two of the women who have not  
been particularly active in the com-  
munity have decided that now may be  
just the time to jump into the fray.

One woman explained, "I'm more  
committed to women now, period.  
I've been in kind of a rut and now  
I want to do something again."

Solutions to the problems the  
women outlined, however, are more  
difficult. The answers are as var-  
ied as the women's own personal  
ways of dealing with what is happen-  
ing. Some don't have a clue.  
Another thinks this community sore-  
ly needs a sense of tradition,  
"like Christmas, something we can  
count on, something every movement  
needs to stick together through the  
hard times.”

Vicki has a burning desire to see  
"fire and brimstone, born-again  
feminists" preaching our political  
gospel. Others are holding their  
breath.

We have, according to these  
women, a community which is more a  
function of its parts than of its  
whole--of the community itself.

We have apparently learned our ear-  
ly lessons well, and they die hard.  
Sometimes it seems we go on almost  
in spite of ourselves. But, inex-  
plicable as it may be, we do go on.

"Sure, a lot of things have dis-  
appeared or dissolved," Deirdre  
concluded. "But we also have the  
women's health clinic opening up.  
That's meeting a real, life-sus-  
taining need. We have to meet  
women's needs or they're not going  
to listen to us."

Deirdre may well have put her  
finger on the heart of the matter  
for all these women: What they  
seem to be saying, simply, is that  
we have to meet each other's needs  
--as women and as feminists--and  
we have to listen to each other.  
Hard. Because if we don't, the  
picture will continue to be out of  
focus and may eventually fade out  
completely.
