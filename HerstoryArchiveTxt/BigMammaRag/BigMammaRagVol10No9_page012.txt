Coming Out Colored is a
book in two parts, Spanish
and English, with the Spanish
translation first. It con-
tains a 57-page analysis (in
English, the Spanish is some-
what shorter) in seven sec-
tions: What It Is, Family,
Ethnic Culture, Illusions
of Grandeur, Wimin's Libera-
tion, Woomoon Identified, and
Facing Our Own Contradictions.

Also included in the book
are quotes from other womyn
of color around the country,
in response to a survey the
author has circulated in her
attempts to document the
goals and struggles of women
of color everywhere.

Update: December 1980 opens
the book with global politi-
cal analysis and examples of
institutionalized racism,
such as:

"The Bureau of Indian Af-
fairs was created a century
ago when farmers and gold
prospectors wanted Indian
land. The cavalry was then
called in if Natives did
not peacefully acquiesce.
Tactics haven't changed
much, just gotten more
sophisticated."

"The mainstream will shut
their eyes to genocidal
practices such as 40% cur-
rent conservative estimates
of sterilization of women
on reservations."

"Destruction of the earth
and genocide is not love.
Any future political system
must develop with respect
for human potential and
preservation of the earth
as high priorities if the
human race will evolve to
serve the noblest ideals."

After this political overview
Maya begins to explain What
It Is but not without first
stating,

"I make no excuses for the
way I write except I want
to be consistent, clear and
try to stay objective."

The uncompromised and unclut-
tered honesty of this author
helps to reassure me that the
80's are indeed a decade when
everyone will come out of the
closet and start straight-
talking about everything. Maya
Chumu is a practical and as-
tute political observer,

"Racism is a militant and
economic power play by
white people to exploit the
natural resources and labor
of dark people for the pro-
duction of excess goods."

"The emergence of color
wimin fighting for her own
liberation and that of her
people is possibly the most
important development in
the liberation struggle

for when we begin to see
the need for the liberation
of the most oppressed among
us, we will begin to iden-
tify with a united effort
to overthrow the common
enemy -- white imperialist
rule. The Liberation of
color wimin is not merely

a "good" humanitarian act
but a necessary important
first step for the libera-
tion of all oppressed
peoples..."

"The oppressors see us at
what price we will sell out.
We see ourselves as holy
wanting our creative ener-
gies (spirits) alive and
well in this world."

"Statistics show that the
average age of Anglo wimin
to come out is in their
early twenties, while for
third world wimin it is
their late twenties. It's
not hard to imagine the
additional pressures that
account for the difference
in ages."

"A strong criticism must
be issued here for the ig-
norance of white wimin who
continue with the death
(white) culture instead of
trying to incorporate col-
ored wimin and non-white
cultures into feminism..."

In the Family section Maya
makes some pointed observa-
tions about the role of the

family and women of color's

role in it,
"When our mothers held pos-
itions of major responsi-
bility within the family
we may have had a strong
role model to follow but
all our mothers had was a
double or triple load."

"The nuclear family is

used by a consumer society
to ensure the greater sale
of just about everything."

For those of us who are vet-
erans of many political move-
ments and struggles, Coming
Out Colored may expound on
political analysis that we
understand and agree with.
The strength of Coming Out
Colored, however, lies not
so much in new revolutionary
ideology, though it has that
too, but more in the fact
that it is a political or-
ganizing tool for women of
color and by a woman of color.

It is a way out of our op-
pressions. This book is an
example of writing at its
most fundamental; it uses
language to assess and anal-
yze the human condition for
purposes of making construc-
tive social and inter-per-
sonal change.

Implicit in the call for
this change is the conviction
that we can achieve it.

We can reclaim power over
our own lives and over-
come the helplessness that
has been imposed on us. And
writing is a powerful tool

in that process.

The message of this book
is that understanding and
analysis are the keys to
successful change. Through
a realistic and honest ap-
praisal of our lives and the
world around us, which the
book is, we can arrive at the
necessary conclusions and
solutions to the powerless-
ness that has been imposed
on us. And we can find our
self-confidence and strength
in the process.

This is a very short book.
I hope to see more of this
writer. Maya Chumu speaks
with all the quiet dignity
of an Indian in ritual. I
hope this book will encourage
more like it in our age when
everyone needs to speak out
on everything. Start any-
where, just start talking.

The line drawings by Renee
Perry and Zarie Amma Harat
and cover photos are impor-
tant because our reality
as women of color is that
forces have rendered us in-
visible. We need to see our-
selves and each other, to
know who we are. Lesbian of
color images are as crucial
at this stage of our evolu-
tion as lesbian of color
writings.

I heartily recommend this
book for its honesty, its
clear analysis and its com-
mitment to creating peace
and harmony out of chaos and
injustice.
