Lesbians - Colorado

Dear Sisters,

I would like to reply to the
letters by Carol Lease and Kathy
Bougher in the October issue criti-
cizing your coverage of the Lesbians
Colorado community meeting. The
thrust of both letters is that BMR's
coverage of the meeting, appearing
under Judy Barlow's by-line, was in-
accurate (or "not factual, full of
falsehoods, and blatantly misrepre-
sentative,” as Lease so redundantly
puts it). Well, perhaps she thinks
so, but as someone who was present
for the entire meeting, I found
your coverage accurately representa-
tive of information presented at
the meeting.

It is true, as Bougher says,
that she (Bougher) stated at the
meeting that conference time would
be available to women wishing to
schedule workshops. However, the
rest of the presentation had such
an our-plans-are-graven-in-rock fla-
vor that I can understand BMR's re-
port that, "the committee has alrea-
dy determined...". (Additionally,
some of the things she says she
said, I don't recall her saying at
all.) Indeed, I found myself won-
dering why these women were bother-
ing to have a community meeting--
their plans seemed so far and in-
flexibly advanced. Even their po-

licy change on male children was
not made at the community meeting,
but later, in private. Most of us
found out about it via a press re-
lease to BMR.

Lease goes on to say that, "to
infer that BMR collective members
represent the conscience of minor-
ity lesbians in this state is ra-
cist, insulting, ludicrous. BMR,
itself, is composed of white women
(italics mine)". So what? Is
Lease seriously telling us that
only minority and Third World wo-
men have the right or the duty to
confront racism? If so (and it
seems so), she is in error. White
women have a responsibility to at-
tack racism wherever we encounter
it, with as much vigor as though we
were its targets--for in the long
run, we all are.

And, for the record, it was not
only in the areas of outreach and
childcare that the conference ap-
peared to be racist, but also in
the location of the hotel where
the conference was to be held--
south Cherry Creek (read, “white
middle to upper-middle class").

I'm white, but my own working class
sensibilities were offended by the
choice of hotel.

Ironically, both Lease and
Bougher allude to your “trashing”
of the conference; while calling
you "yellow" journalists, "disgust-
ing, insensitive", (Lease); and
"vicious, irresponsible, and ap-
palling", (Bougher). Who is trash-
ing whom?

Finally, Lease puffs herself
up and throws a fairly formidable
smokescreen around your use of the
word "fascist". (So formidable,

in fact, that you retracted it.)
I don't know what flight of para-
noia made her think that you were
calling her and the women working
on the conference "fascists",
since Barlow's meaning was perfect-
ly clear, in context. What Barlow
was saying is that the conference
sought to appeal to all lesbians,
whatever their politics. This is
the essential problem of the con-
ference. The word “lesbian
doesn't refer to anything except
with whom one sleeps. This is, of
course, a political decision; but
for some the political implica-
tions are more clear than for oth-
ers. One can be a lesbian and
also be an upper class, profes-
sional, male-identified oppressor.
Or one can be a working class les-
bian feminist. As the latter, I
have less in common with the form-
er than I do with some men. Les-
bianism isn't enough to organize
around, if it's the only basis
you use; for to organize politic-
ally you need political agreement-
not merely a shared "lifestyle".

Gay rights activists frequent-

ly make the point that gays are
"no different than anyone else",
and this is essentially true.
Many gays are vociferous up-hold-

ers of the status quo--seeking to
protect their class and race pri-
vileges, while militating against
their oppression as gays. This
disgusting liberalism is apparent
in the Denver “commission” that

is currently seeking to force the
police department to hire more
gays as officers. A “commission”
of which Lease, herself, is a mem-
ber. What is the point of this
kind of effort? Are people to be-
lieve that a gay policeman is any
less our enemy than a straight po-
liceman? Can anyone tell us that
gays are less easily co-opted

than anyone else? (Of course not,
since we are, "just like everyone
else".)

Lease seems to think that all
criticism of her project is the re-
sult of "personal vindictiveness".
What, exactly, are all twelve or so
of us who criticized the conference
supposed to have against Carol Lease?
We criticized strongly but the basis
of all our criticism was political
concerns not private rancor.

Where our disagreement lay relates
very directly to Crystal Arp's let-
ter in the same issue. Crystal says
we shouldn't fight each other, but
"the system". I agree with her,
though she never specifies what she
means by "the system". To me "the
system" is Patriarchy/Capitalism.
The two cannot be separated--if one
is supported it directly supports
the other. The conference was af-
flicted with political schizophrenia-
attempting to attack patriarchy in a
limited way while upholding capital-
ism. Workshops on small businesses
and real estate investing, along
with the private/public goal of the
conference organizers to elect a les-
bian to public office, only serve
to uphold “the system". So in at-
tacking the conference we are not,
in fact, attacking each other, but
"the system" as some women uphold it.
Some women are not my sisters. Some
women are my sisters but are follow-
ing a course that I believe to be
counter-revolutionary. I don't real-
ly know quite where the conference
organizers stand on this sisters/
not sisters spectrum. But giving
them the benefit of the doubt, which
they certainly deserve, I believe
they are in serious error. I oppos-
ed their politics at the community
meeting and I shall continue to op-
pose projects masquerading as femin-
ist that in fact do "the system's"
work. It is only through strongly
promoting and defending our politics
that we make progress toward our
goals. This is not to say that we
have all the answers or are always
right--but only that we know what
feminism means to us, that we are
willing to struggle with and for our
politics, and that we feel it is our
serious political responsibility to
fight for our politics whenever we
feel they are being betrayed. It is
only through this process of strug-
gle that all of our politics develop
and that our movement's goals and
politics are safeguarded.

Some are probably thinking, “but
these were women working together to
do some good". Or, perhaps, as I
have frequently heard in the Denver
community, “but it wasn't a bad con-
ference--some good things came out
of it". To these I reply simply
that the end can never justify the
means. The fact that some good work
came from the conference does not
excuse the denials of feminism that
occurred during the planning and dur-
ing the conference.

The organizers seemed concerned
about offending anyone--except radi-
cal feminists. This is a particular-
ly bitter blow to come from those
supposedly within our own community.
It isn't pleasant to fight with wom-
en--to find that you have disagree-
ment so deep with others who also
call themselves, even if only pri-
vately, “radical feminists". But it
does no one any good to sweep those
differences under the blanket of
sisterhood.

Those of us who hold revolution-
ary goals realize that we are more
and more in the minority in the wom-
en's movement. All around us, on
"women's commissions", in "women's
safehouses" and “women's studies
departments" we see women who live

. feminism.

in the middle classes and accept
middle class, in-system values; pro-
fessionals, who believe the way to
gain “feminist” credentials is by
getting a degree from a male univer-
sity so they can “help women"--all
the while drawing a fat salary for
a cushy job. We have seen our pro-
jects co-opted time and again by
these women, for they have access
to "the system's" money and power--
the trappings of privilege. Those
who think that the way to advance
women to full “equality” is by giv-
ing more women access to “the sys-
tem's" power are wrong. Capitalism
does not lend itself to such access
by everyone, but only by a privi-
leged class. It is not a goal of
radical feminism to gain some women
admission into that privileged
class. This is a goal of liberal,
or if you prefer "bourgeois",

Only by ending capital-
ism will any of us on the outside
find real "freedom". It's like

the song says--"I can't be free
"til EVERYBODY else is...".

In sisterhood,

Dear BMR Collective,

I have been very interested in the
last two issues of BMR, specifically
with the topic of the Lesbians-Colo-
rado Conference. I did not attend
this controversial community meeting
so I don't know exactly what tran-
spired that evening. But I am left
with at least one sad assumption
based on the article by Judy Barlow.
Amid all those raised questions,
offered criticism, overall feelings,
grave concern and non-endorsement,
did anyone present offer any support
whatsoever? Was there any positive
feedback given to the planning com-
mittee? Apparently not.

As one of the workshop facilita-
tors, I was surprised to read of your
impression that the workshops were
previously determined and that the
particular thrust was already known
to the planning committee. The work-
shop committee did indeed offer me a
potential direction, and presented
some interesting, creative ideas and
questions that I was free to pursue.
I appreciated the assistance, and at
no time did I take their comments to
be decisions. The workshops were
totally controlled by the facilita-
tors and participants.

I feel very discouraged and angry
by the last paragraph of Judy Bar-
low's article and the October Edi-
tor's reply. You found it "difficult
to endorse a conference that is try-
ing to reach ALL lesbians", and
state that "Lesbianism alone is not
a basis for unity." A basic princi-
ple for the conference from the be-
ginning was to "meet one another, get
to know each other, talk about our
concerns, problems, interests, vis-
ions, have a good time, and explore
our differences". Let me repeat,

"...and explore our differences".

The article and editor's reply
leaves me with a very negative im-
pression of BMR. The whole concept
of horizontal hostility is becoming
quite stale these days, but I encour-
age the collective, both as indivi-
duals and most importantly as respon-
sible journalists, to do some self-
evaluation in this area.

In closing, I would like to thank
the planning committee and the many
other lesbians who were involved.

The Lesbians Colorado Conference was
the most organized event I've attend-
ed in this community and the success
of the conference can be directly
contributed to the incredible amount
of energy, talent and dedication
these women provided.

National NOW
Conference

Dear Big Mama Rag,

This is a report on the National
NOW conference held in early October
in Los Angeles. The dominant motif
of the National Conference was elec-
tion of leadership for the next two
years. Sisters, please remind me of
LA '79 in two years when we have the
next elections conference. I found my-
self shaking my head in disappointment
too often. Feminist politics were
abused. Minority opinions went un-
heard. Sincere questions were ques-
tioned rather than answered. Power
politics were wielded with differing
viewpoints browbeaten and bullied.
Such is life for a NOW activist.

Not all was vulgar. My Central
Denver sisters were beautiful. Our
integrity was superb. In contests
there are always factions. In our
feminist future, when Central Denver's
point of view is respected for its
value, there'll be no need for these
minority reports.

My source of consternation with
elections was Ellie Smeal‘s support of
a "team" of candidates. In essence,

a vote for someone not on the "team"
was voting lack of faith in Ellie.
Really, don't insult me, don't patron-
ize me, please: The blood and guts of
that tactic are too detailed to men-
tion here.

As a lesbian feminist delegate I ex-
perienced horror. Our workshops and
caucuses were a playground for tradi-
tional feminists. Leadership of these
by B. Chase (National LRTF Co-Chair)
was despicable and an insult to me as
a Colorado lesbian. She has little
lesbian feminist consciousness and is
not to be trusted. Our conference
work was inhibited by her liaison with
those in power.

No. We were not expecting too
much. We expected only the affirmation
of Lesbian Rights that NOW is committed
to by policy. No. We were not radical.
It is no longer a question of radical
versus traditional. We lesbians are
seen as radical only by those less
pure in their politics. A lesbian fem-
inist knows where she is in the move-
ment. Other sisters, do you? If you
don't, we'd prefer you didn't play
with us.

Resolutions were a parody with
prioritizing in favor of the “team”.
Few were discussed. The nuclear
issue never got to the floor--too het
for you NOW?

I'll probably get a bit of jazz
for these comments, but isn't that
why I'm here? Likeness of mind
bores me. I love you all in Denver
and miss you deeply.

Lesbian - Women’s
Studies Anthology

Dear Women,

At the conference in Lawrence in
June, I talked to Liz Phillips of The
Feminist Press about an anthology on
lesbians and women's studies. As you
know, TFP has not yet published any-
thing on lesbians. Before I submit a
proposal, I want to get suggestions
from many of you, so that the propo-
sal will reflect thinking other than
my own. The main audience for the
book would be students and teachers of
women's studies. But if creatively
organized the book ought also to ap-
peal to other women, both lesbians and
non-lesbians.

I did not find many women of color
to write for The Lesbian Path, an an-
thology of autobiographical writing I
edited, and for the proposed book I
want to be more thorough in searching
for those women who have not been vis-
ible enough in women's studies courses
and at our conferences. Please sug-
gest ways I can find a truly diverse
group of women for this book on les-
bians and women's studies.

The work I have in mind would not
be a primary text, since much lesbian
material is now available for classes,
but would be a supplementary text
which would give students and teachers
a context for lesbian studies. Arti-
cles on teaching lesbian poetry and
researching lesbian history, for ex-
ample, would be included.

Because anti-lesbian feelings are
still so strong on many campuses, the
book would include personal sketches,
e.g., by closeted heads of programs and
by students and teachers who came out
