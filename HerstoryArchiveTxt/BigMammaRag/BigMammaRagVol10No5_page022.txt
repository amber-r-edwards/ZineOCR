Mitsuye And Nellie - Asian  
American Poets creates a mo-  
ving and challenging double  
portrait of two women whose  
poetry expresses, with drama-  
tic clarity, the immigrant  
experience of Asian American  
women in a society contemp-  
tuous and suspicious of  
"Orientals." It is a film  
about tenderness and anger  
between mothers and daughters,  
generational conflicts and  
the breaking of stereotyped  
images of Asian American wo-  
men. Available from Light-  
Saraf Films, 131 Concord St.,  
San Francisco, CA 94112. 58  
minutes, 16mm color. Rental  
is $75, inquire regarding  
benefit showings.
