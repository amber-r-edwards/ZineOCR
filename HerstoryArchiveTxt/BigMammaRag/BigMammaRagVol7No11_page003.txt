More On the Lesbians -

Dear BMR,

As an ex-collective member, I am
amazed and delighted with each new
issue of BMR. I especially look for-
ward to reading articles by Constance
Perenyi, which always reveal politi-
cal and emotional insights to me. I
have also enjoyed reading collective
discussions such as the one on work-
ing by Vicki Piotter (August, 1979).
There is a tremendous amount of ener-
gy involved in putting the paper to-
gether, and I rely on BMR for my con-
tinuing source of news and feminist
analysis.

I have been following the Lesbian
Colorado Conference controversy in
BMR. I think that the criticisms of
the conference by BMR and other wom-
en are valid—e.g. around racism and
feminism. I think, though, that you
did a very one-sided job of covering
the conference, especially consider-
ing the more positive coverage of
the Conference on Violence Against
Women, a conference geared to pro-
fessional women and which cost $120
and was held in a very plush hotel,
albeit downtown. I realize that
you, as did I, disagreed with the
basic premise of the conference—
to reach all lesbians regardless of
political orientation. What it
comes down to, though, is that
there are many levels on which we
(as radical feminists) need to work
from running a women's center to
talking about women’s issues with
co-workers to anti-nuke stuff to
taking up arms and fighting back.
Each level is integral to the over-
all struggle and is necessary.

Which is not to say we shouldn't
criticize—it's important to criti-
cize and evaluate the work we and
others do. It is also important to
support progressive things, such as
a lesbian (!) conference. No, be-
ing a lesbian is not inherently pro-
gressive, but having a lesbian con-
ference is.

The lesbian conference reached a
lot of women who might otherwise not
have been exposed to ideas presented
at the conference, e.g. the criticism
around racism during the conference
wrap-up. It was a rare time for many
lesbians to get together and estab-
lish contacts around different issues.

I would have liked to have seen more
comprehensive coverage of the confer-
ence in the November BMR, plus more
analysis, instead of your relying on
letters to do that for you. It was
an important political event and de-
served more than two short columns
next to Lucia Valeska's speech.

Sincerely,
Susanna Smith

CONTRIBUTORS

Colorado Conference

Dear Big Mama,

The Colorado Lesbian Conference
was not radically feminist or revo-
lutionary. I agree that the con-
frontation of racism, or classism,
were not part of conference goals.
Compare the stated goals of CLC
("establishing networks to meet in-
terests and needs, to affirm lesbian
identities through culture and as-
sociations with each other, and to
increase the visibility of lesbians
as a group in society") with those
of the 3rd World Lesbian/Gay Confer-
ence recently advertised in BMR (to
establish networks and "to confront
the issues of racism, homophobia,
and heterophobia by and against 3rd
World Lesbians and Gays").

I agree with many of the criti-
cisms raised about the conference,
but I do not agree that the confer-
ence should not have happened at all.
If it did not confront racist and
sexist crap in our communities, it
did concern itself with being strong
and assertive and taking some con-
trol over our lives, sexually and
politically, and economically.

There was a fantastic workshop on
Lesbians and alcoholism, and other
drug dependencies. It was stimula-
ting and concretely helpful about a
very serious problem that is effec-
tive in immobilizing many of us (wom-
en). Another good workshop was by
the Socialist-Feminist Collective
from Boulder. And others to help
women in non-traditional jobs. And
others to talk about and act on gain-
ing economic power, as women. The
conference mainly concerned helping
Lesbians get a better deal in this
system (fighting homophobia for one)
and helping lesbians change the sy-
stem. It's true that is not very
revolutionary, but there are few
political events in this country
that could be called revolutionary
in the sense of seeing and fighting
all oppressions interconnectedly.

Before there can be unity on many
levels, there usually must be unit-
ies on one level (or a couple).
Meetings of people based on some
similarity between them. Yes, Les-
bians can be classist, racist and
support the values of the dominant
culture. But that is no reason not
to congregate on the basis of a very
real, shared oppression. I believe
that Lesbianism can be a basis for
unity, though certainly limited.
Lesbianism does not necessarily im-
ply a commitment to fighting all
injustice, or a revolutionary stand,
though you are certainly as or more
likely to find it there as in other
groups of women.

If all groups had to meet such

Political - Artistic
Integrity

Dear BMR,

In the last issue of BMR you
printed a poem, "Self-Defense",
written by me and credited to me
and to Becca Todd who I assume is
responsible for slight changes in
the wording. While I am pleased
that my writing is being used and
enjoyed by women, I am uncomfortable
when my words are changed and print-
ed without my being consulted or
even informed.

I appreciate the role of "folk
process” in the creation of our cul-
ture, and am delighted to play a
part in it. I copyright my work
only to protect it from exploitation
by non-feminists. On the other
hand, I have to live with everything
that is printed in my name, and
might not always agree with another
woman's use and interpretation of
my writing.

In this particular area, the
changes were politically and artis-
tically fine with me. Still, I am
not dead, only in prison, and can
be easily reached for consultation
and consent. My address until mid-
1982 is BOX 99, Framingham, MA
01701.

I would especially appreciate it
if anyone who wants to change any
of my writing or take lines out of
context would check with me first,
not because of my copyrights, but
out of respect for my political and
artistic integrity. Feminists are
free to read, use and copy my work,
of course. If they could also be
considerate enough to let me know
about it, then I could enjoy it
along with the rest of the world.

Women in Prison

Big Mama Rag,

I am a prisoner at the Ohio Refor-
matory for Women in Marysville, Ohio.
I have read several issues of your
paper, which another inmate receives
and have enjoyed them very much. I
do not have funds to buy your paper
but would like to receive it. It
keeps me in tune to other women who
feel some of the things I'm feeling
in my life.

I hope I'll be added to your mail-
ing list.

Sincerely,
Carolyn

Women Against Nukes

Dear Women,

We at Vancouver Status of Women
are interested in liaising with you
over the nuclear issue. At present,
there are plans to go ahead with ura-
nium mining in this province. As
feminists, we are very concerned. We
plan to present a brief outlining
the impact of uranium on women to a
Royal Commission that the provincial
government has established.

Our main purpose in working on
the brief is to use the opportunity
to educate women in the province
about the issue. However, we have
discovered that there is little re-
search that deals specifically with
women. Can you help us with any in-
formation that is available? Parti-
cularly that material that pertains
to uranium mining and hazards to wo-
men?

Does your group publish a newslet-
ter? If so, would you be interested
in exchanging newsletters?

Would you please contact us as
soon as possible? We would appreci-
ate any information that you can
provide.

In sisterhood,
