Living “Women And Madness”

ALIENATION
Close your eyes to nameless fears
Seal within your throat
The silent cries.

Never speak to strangers

Of dark, chimera images of night
In their fright

they might

build a wall around you
from the world.

Yes, I feel alienated from the fem-
inist community. I am an ex-psychi-
atric inmate which is as much a part
of my being as my feminism and my
lesbianism. I am oppressed by men-
talism as much as I am by sexism.
There is great fear of women's power
in the patriarchy. The fear of mad-
ness also goes very deep. This fear
of “losing one's mind” reminds me of
how it was when people believed the
earth was flat. If they voyaged too
far, they'd fall off the edge. This
fear is ever present in the women's
community, as it is in the dominant
society.

We seem to be at a point as femin-
ists where we analyze women's madness
in terms of sexism, racism, classism
and/or capitalism. We look at the
high rate of admission for women to
psychiatric facilities and think,
"no wonder Susan went off the deep
end, this culture is alienating."

I suggest we begin analyzing the

Having Been

Keta Rose

My friend Dee dee and I decided to
write to the women's community a-
bout what it is like to be women and
to be ex-mental patients and to be
feminists. I have written this letter
in my mind so many times.

I have been a prisoner of psychia-
trists. Psychiatrists - those who do
the thinking for us all in this so-
ciety. I served time as a psychia-
tric inmate. I was incarcerated for
54 months of “voluntary” confinement.
I was forced to have 17 shock treat-
ments, three bouts with lithium, six
months of prolixin, and many other
zombifying drugs. The people in this
country who are in prisons, in "cor-
rectional institution" prisons, are
getting forced-drugged with many of
the same drugs that people get in
mental hospitals.

Let me just tell you my story. I
was sitting here today thinking about
what would happen to me if anybody
should get it into their minds that
I was not sane. Certainly any angry
woman appears insane to a cop. Cer-
tainly the madness, our madness, our
essential rage at what has happened
to us as women, to our powers, to
the conditions that we live in, that
the animals live in, that our chil-
dren live in, that's madness. And
sometimes I show my madness. As a
matter of fact, I show my madness a
lot. And it's hard, believe me. How
do we show it and be safe? I was
thinking, "no, it could never happen
again, no, Keta, no, I tell myself,
it could never happen again." Well,
I'm afraid. I am afraid, because if
I was put into one of those places
for just a 72-hour “observation",
they would shoot me up so bad full of
toxic drugs to deal with my anger, to
deal with my madness, and to deal
with my rage, even if I wasn't show-
ing it. All of my madness and all
my rage is something I have given to
myself and to the community. Why
won't the feminist community claim
it?

I got locked up 10 years ago. It’s
hard to forget. It's a grip they
have, a real grip. There has been
incredible pressure on me from other
women, from other feminists, to
keep quiet about my incarceration,
to be still, to "let go of it", to
keep it my secret. I know we have to
survive daily in the world.

I know how much pressure we all have
to behave "normally". Still, I ask

various psychiatric metaphors and
examine exactly what they represent.
We may be surprised at our findings.
When I tell feminists I spent near-
ly three years in psychiatry's grip,
they often assume that something
must have been wrong with me to have
been there so long and treat me like
I’m contagious, a threat. When I
try to be assertive and express my
nightmare experience I'm often cut
short and advised to read Women and
Madness. Well, I've lived women and
madness. I wonder why they haven't
read the groundbreaking works by
politically aware ex-inmates like
On Our Own: Patient Controlled Alter-
natives To The Mental Health System
by Judi Chamberlin or Too Much Anger
Too Many Tears by Janet and Paul
Gotkin. 
The truth is that I got used to
being caged and labeled human gar-
bage, that after a while I believed
it was my place in the world. I held
hatred in my heart for those on the
outside who I thought were all pho-
nies (which was why they were not
in there with me.) That was almost
ten years ago and the hate has been
soothed though the anger still runs
strong.

Psychiatric metaphors pervade our
community and each time I hear them
I feel hit with verbal bullets. When
a feminist interchanges the words
paranoid and fearful, I wonder if she
realizes the enormous difference be-

There-

tween the two. Paranoia is defined
as a type of mental derangement
marked by irrational fears of perse-
cution. I believe what constitutes
irrationality is totally in the
judge's experience. Most women have
been persecuted beyond what we could
have imagined. I know too, that I
was incarcerated and tortured when
someone with more power and authority
used that label to define my exper-
ience. How do you think it feels to
be called crazy by sisters when you
have been locked up and drugged in-
to conformity because you disagreed
with the status quo? It makes me feel
like I don't belong, that I'm a
garbage person, that the women's com-
munity is not a safe home either.
I've realized over the past ten
years that of course the feminist
community is not isolated from the
larger dominant society. We as a sub-
group have our own set of standards
for appropriate behavior. If our per-
sonal feelings get too difficult to
handle, do we talk with each other?
No. We have our own brand of therapy
epitomizing the medical model. We go
to the closet/office of the feminist
expert and cry alone saying thanks
for the tissue with a check if we
can afford the privilege. Many think
of feminist therapy as a positive
outgrowth of the women's movement.

It's true that feminist therapists
are exposing the sexism which per-
vades traditional psychiatric prac-

tice. Some of these professionals
have been writing books demanding a
non-sexist mental health system. But
like their brothers, they are more
than willing to construct theories
about experiences they have not had.
They often look upon former psychia-

tric inmates with fear, sympathy,
protectiveness, distrust and anger.
Yet they are as sensitive as we to
the words, "not okay".

My own experiences with feminist
therapy have been negative. It was
the same old psychiatric oppression
repackaged in a non-sexist wrapper.
I believe now that because I am not
dependent on a 50-minute hour once a
week as the only time that I can
voice the unspoken and attempt to
understand my world, I have formed
deep and loving relationships
with others like me. When we are
hopeless, suicidal, sad, or joyful
and feeling useful, it's important
we share these feelings with each
other. We hold each other up during
stormy weather. We scream, and cry
and laugh together. We love and
trust each other and no price is put
on our very special relationship
with each other.

I expect someday, feminism will be
a universal language and we'll all
have a safe home. We are still build-
ing, changing, growing and strugg-
ling. The alienation I feel makes me
realize how important it is that this
growth continue. This hope I feel
makes me know it will.

Words To The Women’s Community

you sisters, I implore you to stop
ostracizing those of us who have
been punished for crimes against the
State in the name of Psychiatry.
Those of us who are incarcerated
learn a lot. This is what I have to
say. I have been treated like a
"crazy woman" in my own community.
Because I speak out about my frustra-
tions, I have been told to stop
being so negative. Because I speak
out about my imagination, I have been
humiliated. Sisters, if we feel
guilt, it's because society has
made us feel guilty. So let's not
pretend it's not there. Let's not
add to the guilt by making

each other feel bad when we express
our inner struggles. Let's not make
each other feel bad when we express
that we are insecure, that we have
doubts, that we are scared, that

we buy into some of the images about
ourselves that have been told us for
5,000 to 10,000 years. If we can be
open about these feelings, we can
heal ourselves.

We are Amazons, but we are not
coated in solid armor. The raw mat-
erial of my mind, the divine soil of
my mind, has been trampled on by arm-
ies of Patriarchy. And if I express
frustration, don't call me defeatist
or negative. Because I am not de-
featist. I know in my heart that I
will work and struggle until women
have reclaimed our power, until the
Earth is ours and healed. I know
that is my goal. Don't call me de-
featist, because I am able to
express my frustrations about the
daily struggles of this society and
my frustrations within the women's
community. What is it sisters? Why
do we have to act so "together"?

Why do we have to act like we are
having a good time all the time? We
have good and bad weather. Many times
we are miserable. A lot of times we
are feeling torturous things that
we can't quite get out of our minds.
Feeling scared (how often is it call-
ed being "paranoid"!), feeling in-
secure or freaked-out is part of

me, part of my real feelings. These
emotions are just as much a part of
me as feelings of happiness or calm
or confidence.

I'm saying that for us to be pow-
erful, we have to reclaim all our
emotions. Whatever any woman feels
comes from real experience. Feelings
emerge from personal and collective
experiences that come from difficult
and stressful struggles that we all
have lived. It's not "crazy" to feel
whatever we feel. Rather it is a
waste of our precious selves to
hold back from sharing with each oth-
er all of our feelings. We have been
taught to constantly channel our
words and deeds by a society ruled
by men who stay in power by direct-
ing women away from our power, by
directing us to fear our feelings.
Our minds are the most powerful tools
on Earth, locked up by fear and guilt.
How many women keep their fears to
themselves, because they think they
alone are feeling strange?

Let's stop calling women “crazy".
Let's accept weirdness in each other
at times other than when someone
breaks up with her lover or loses her
job. Let's stop treating women who
don't work for money, who are on So-
cial Security or welfare, as people
who are not giving. Because we all
give, and in our hearts, we know what
we give. That's what I have to say.

I am angry and disappointed about
how little interest the women's com-
munity has shown in women in psychia-
tric institutions. After all, 10 per
cent of the population gets locked-
up in mental prisons at some time,

and 2/3 of these people are women,
women of all ages and races and
classes. What happens to all of these
women is torture, real torture, cover-
ed up by science and technology. What
happens is brain-damaging drugs and
shock treatment. What happens is drugs
that blind you, like mellaril, drugs
that make you shake, like prolixin,
drugs that ruin your kidneys, like
lithium, drugs that seriously impair
the workings of your minds and bodies.
I'm asking you for your support.

Much of our energy, our rage, and our
power has been shut away in mental
hospitals. A lot of you who have
never been locked up, you have been
shut up by all the Psychiatric-
Freudian based lies about what is
normal. Yes, I've heard feminists
calling other women “mentally ill".
