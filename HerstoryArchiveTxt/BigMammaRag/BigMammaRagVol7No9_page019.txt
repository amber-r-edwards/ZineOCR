Dethroning Art

Why rather than a select few think-
ers and creators who play the
game the best, according to the
existing rules?

Myth #4:

To be an artist, a person has to
devote an entire lifetime, day-in
and day-out, to nothing but art-
making.

This one stems from the time-
honored expectation that an artist
will function as a tool for express-
ion, as a medium for some great
message. This is unrealistic if,
underneath it all, the artist is
a real person. It is even less work-
able if the artist is a woman who
has a commitment to other women,
and who wants to have a hand in
creating her own culture.

When I first got involved in ac-
tive feminist politics, I was de-
fensive about my artmaking; and at
times, considered retreating from
other women because I felt censured
by their suspicion of artistic
elitism. Then I began to understand
that there were indeed traditions
of artistic privilege and political
naivete. And I was still a part
of that. Gradually, I began to
struggle with that, committed my-
self to working with other women,
and found predictably that I had
less time and space for my own
creativity. At least that is how
it seemed on the surface.

Initially, I panicked because I
had bought shares in the myth that
an artist has to be 300% committed
to her art, and her art alone. But
then, I also began to realize that
I can be creative within the move-
ment, and that art and feminism
can coexist in my life. Not only
that, but they make me stronger,
more aware, more effective as an
artist and as a feminist.

I also see how important it is
for all of us to keep struggling
with the myths of artistic iden-

Women and Craft

With the resurgent interest in craft,
officials have discovered that there
is big tourist money in what women
produce. The article is developed
around the specifics of cooking, and
while Friedlander cites American in-
terest in native foods, she demon-
strates that this “appreciation"
entraps women. “While members of

the privileged classes, particu-
larly from abroad, have come to
appreciate Mexican cooking as one

of the world's great cuisines, for
Hueyapans it remains one of the
endless chores that the women must
attend to.“

What we are glorifying as craft,
as folk-art, is often an expression
of women's basic survival; or of
the long-standing traditions of sac-
rifice. I remember one experience
from childhood that clearly typi-
fies that attitude. While we were
looking at a beautiful, hand-
embroidered Japanese kimono, my father
cracked, "I bet a hundred women went

blind making that." I was hor-

rified by his caustic remark, and
painfully aware that he was probably
right. Not only that, but those
women did not even have a choice.

I have a choice in the kind of art
I make. And while I realize that
my decision to make crafts is rooted
in a whole different set of values
and circumstances, my basic process
is similar to that of other women
who have not had as many choices.
Frequently, I reject the sewing
machine because I find hand-work
to be more accurate and pleasing.
I also find it tedious, boring, and
often incredibly slow. Depending on

identity. More women must make room
within the movement for their art.
In so doing, we must also learn

to share skills/insights, and we
must be aware of the pull to become
stars by popularizing (and in the
process diluting) the content of
our work. In doing this, we will
become less "burdened by our talent,"
and will encourage other women to
explore their own creativity and
means of personal expression.

This is a joint responsibility,
however; a balance that must be
established between women who
are considered artists and women
who consider themselves “non-art-
ists." Together we must debunk the
myths of creativity and encourage
each other's struggles around that.
Together, we must challenge our
evolving culture and acknowledge
our own, as well as others' stren-
gths and weaknesses (and that means
learning to give and take con-
structive criticism). Together,
we must create real alternatives
and be aware of the pitfalls as we
work towards a future that is as
free from the limitations of the
past as possible.

And in ending, another quote
from Shirley Walton:

I perceive in me the potential
to do great things. But this poten-
tial does not make me special,
it is simply a part of me. It is
a part of me that must be given
...

The process of giving that room to
each other, and of making it for
ourselves, is at the heart of
feminism. It is the primary strug-
gle and the goal of creating our
own culture. The effectiveness of
our movement is determined by our
willingness to embrace and validate
our struggle, and the only way we
can do that is by questioning every
myth, challenging every assumption
as we go.

my mood, my stitching either grounds
or unglues me. At times, especially
right after I finish a piece and hang
it in my room, I love what I do;

and at other times, I detest it and
resent the people who admire it
without any sense of what goes into
even the smallest piece. A year
later, I understand why I was un-
strung before my show. It wasn't

the expectations of what would hap-
pen at the opening, but the daily
reality of small, exacting stitches.

I am in the midst of an artistic
crisis, and this is compounded by
the realization that the patience
and tedious time spent on my art
is not that different than the
trials of my everyday secretarial
experiences. And yet it is very
different because, 1) I am doing
this for myself (though at times I
have questioned that as well), 2)

I have other ways to express my-

self artistically (like my drawings),
and 3) I do have something, and

often something very meaningful, to
show for all the time spent.

When it gets down to it though, I
really love the texture and sensual-
ity of fabric. I need to understand
what it means to respect the mater-
ials of my craft - not just as a
connection with traditions I will
never fully be able to identify
with, but as a means of exploring
the significance of feminist ex-
pression in art. My quilts are not
like those that my great-grandmother
would have made - but then, my
life choices are different too. And
I do work with what I have. And
in that way, I can say that I carry
on women's traditions.

On the Edge

Big house. Have a party. Everyone
wants to see the inside of your house.
WILL you invite me? Biggest house in
town. Newest house in town. I hate
you. I hate your money. Will you
invite me to your party?

I don't know if their anger toward
me was really one of jealousy (as my
parents told me) or if they were just
reacting to my superior attitude. The
end result, however, is clear. I
had no real friends. I spent most of
my time alone feeling smug and super-
ior, yet lonesome and depressed. I
hated my parents' money, but I also
loved it. Love from my parents,
especially my father, was metered out
in dollars and cents.

Operation? Lose

Sean. Trauma. Fat gink. You have
everything you want. Sleep-walking.
Crying. Alone. But you have always

had everything you wanted. What have
you ever wanted that you didn’t get?
Mom said that she doesn’t like what
that medicine does--makes me spaced
out. Don't care. Laugh a lot. Fall
asleep during dinner. Just a dreamer.
She's an artist. Get straight. Get
with the REAL world. Money. You
can't live on dreams.

I don't think that I really under-
stood what class and struggle really
meant until my junior year of college
when I found myself alone and broke
and disinherited by my family. Money
became something dirty instead of
something magic and wonderful. I knew
that money couldn't and didn't buy

happiness, but when there wasn't enough

to register for a full load of classes
and I couldn't get financial aid be-
cause of my parents’ financial status,
I began to reevaluate my feelings about
money. I found myself in a similar
situation to the people I had looked
down at when I was growing up--poor.

I had no new clothes or car or even
food. I began to hate those, like

my father, who had money and power.

Love me some money. Give me some money.
Buy me this. Buy me that. Buy me.
Give me some money. Buy me something.
Love me.

Eventually my parents and I recon-
ciled and their money was available
to me again, but only after I had
worked for a year as a nurse's aide
on the 11-7 shift while going to
college full time during the day. I
sometimes accepted their help knowing
that I could and had survived without
it. Other times I felt that I was a
child again--asking them to prove
their love by giving me money.

characters out there in the world who

are racist. That it was not necessarily

a reflection of our politics.
Sandy: An interesting thing happened
the other day at football practice.
This woman who saw us last year at
the Gay Symposium, where we did a
skit about alcoholism, and she was a
reformed alcoholic. She was sitting
next to her lover and the skit was
about a drunk and the relationship
between her and her lover, and all the
shit that went on and all the pain.
She remembered the skit because it
embarrassed the hell out of her;
everything we showed, she was sitting
there going that's exactly how it
was. She told me she was ready to
crawl under the table because she
kept looking at her lover and thinking
I've done the same damn thing to her.

Years later I found myself alone
with a small child to support with no
where to turn for help but the welfare
department. The old feeling came rush
ing back. Not only was I subjecting
myself to poverty, but I felt that
I was somehow depriving my child--not
being a good mother because I couldn't
support my child without help.

There should be a law against people
like that having children. Only
people who can afford children should
be able to have them. Poor little
trash, probably will grow up to be
just like them. Lazy-assed parents.

I decided then that I had to find a
way to support myself and my child--
to know that I could really make it
on my own as an adult which somehow
always came back to how much money I
had or could earn. I went to vocation
al school, learned a trade, and got a
job that paid more than I could have
earned with my college degree.

Working in a trade that is dominated
by men allows me to earn a salary
where I can afford to support myself
and my child, but it also puts me in
the mainstream of the working class--
a blue collar worker with calloused
hands to show that I have really earn-
ed my pay. It has reinforced my anger
toward those with money and power--
the bosses, my father.

I am aware now that it is men like
my father who live off other people's
labor that are keeping my wages lower
than they should be. When I total up
the amount of money the company I work
for earns from my labor and that of
my co-workers, it makes me angry. I
feel the same kind of hostility toward
the bosses as I am sure people in my
hometown felt toward my family.

The unfairness of it all, the big
corporations paying their workers as
little as possible in order to keep
profits high, makes me angry. Knowing
that some fat capitalist is living off
of my labor while I try to make ends
meet makes me furious.

And yet, even as I approach 30, I
just can't seem to get rid of the
values that were so strongly instilled
in me while I was growing up. Somehow
to succeed, I still feel that I need
more and more money. I need money,
not just to survive, but to show the
world that I have succeeded--to show
that I, like my father, am a success
as a woman, as an adult, and as a
parent.

I love you, Mommie. Will you buy me

a toy? a present? How much do you
love me, Mommie? Will you buy me that
toy?

also performed on some fairly strange

here and talk about those experiences.
Jane: Well, a woman contacted me
and wanted us to go down to Colorado
Springs to perform at this new bar,
and she offered us money, which was
real novel. So we had all the arrang-
ements and it was in a new women's bar
which was supposedly in the basement
of the men's bar. So we went down to

offensive posters of women in bikinis
crouched over tigers and wearing
tight shorty t-shirts that said “beer
busts are better," and it was real
offensive.
