TEA ROSE PRESS is a partner-  
ship of three lesbians who  

publish, edit & do all the pro-  

duction of pamphlets and books  
of interest to feminist/les-  
bians. We plan to publish one  
book, & possibly a pamphlet,  
in Spring/Summer 1984. We want  
material which will speak to  
racially, economically and  
culturally diverse audiences  

& which expresses or reflects  
anti-oppressive politics; we  
have some interest in material  
suitable for use in Women's  
Studies. We are most interest-  
ed in a novel, but will con-  
sider theory or short stories.  
We cannot consider poetry. We  
invite submission of manu-  
scripts by July 31, 1983. (We  
cannot return manuscripts un-  
less they are accompanied by  
return postage.) Send to:

Farmworkers from page 4

farmworkers do not attend  
grade school past the 8th  
grade. The dropout rate in  
high school is 89%.  

Consumers are generally re-  
sponsive to FLOC pickets, ac-  
cording to Romero and Rodri-  
guez.  

"People commit themselves  
to our cause when we're right  
there at the stores," Romero  
said, “but we have to talk to  
more people. Churches and  
labor groups have helped us a  
great deal. They do as much  
as they can to put the word  
out for us, but there are  
many midwest cities where  
people are not aware of our  
struggles."  

FLOC also plans to continue  
pickets at as many tomato  

fields as possible in Ohio,  
Michigan, and Indiana during  
this year's harvest. Rodri-  
guez said the strikers have  
to prepare themselves for  
harassment and possible vio-  
lence. She relates past in-  
cidents where strikebreakers  
dumped human waste along the  
picket lines while local  
sheriff's deputies stood and  
watched. She said workers are  
also harassed by groups like  
the Ku Klux Klan.  

But the women have confi-  
dence they will win rights  
for the workers.  

"We have faith that we will  
get negotiations with the  
companies," Romero said.  
“When that happens the vio-  
lence and harassment against  
us will stop. We believe in  
ourselves, and those thoughts  
are what make us go on."
