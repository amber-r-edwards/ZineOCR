League of Housewives

Carol Lease

When I found out that the  
League of Housewives (LOH),  
the anti-ERA, Happiness of  
Womanhood affiliated group,  
was having an unpublicized  
state meeting for supporters  
only I decided to attend to dis-  
cover for myself what the league  
was really like.

LOH is infamous for its home-  
baked cookies that it delivered to  
the Colorado legislature. The  
women employ this tactic to try  
to convince male legislators that  
they represent a majority of  
Colorado women who oppose  
the Equal Rights Amendment,  
want to be subservient to men  
and have fewer rights than male  
citizens.

I wanted to attend the meeting  
incognito. I didn't want to cause  
or witness a distortion of the  
LOH's politics because of defen-  
sive reactions to differences,  
whether in clothes or opinion. In  
other words, I went in drag. I  
pulled out a dress, wore tights to  
cover my hairy legs (a sure give-  
away) and parked my car at the  
edge of the lot since a well-used,  
battered Volkswagen sitting  
among late-model station  
wagons and sedans would have  
blown my cover immediately.

The meeting opened with a  
prayer led by a minister who ask-  
ed God to help us rescind the  
ERA and keep us all safe. Bar-  
bara Stasko then led in the  
pledge of allegiance.

Reports were heard. The  
league does a lot of “grassroots”  
organizing by encouraging  
women to have their neighbors  
over for coffee to recruit them to  
sign petitions and write letters  
and make phone calls. The  
league also just opened an office  
at 4960 Evans. The phone and  
rent were donated and  
husbands are needed to make  
shelves for the anti-ERA  
literature.

League of Housewives

Self-Destructive Woman's Group  
Spreads Anti-Woman Line

The LOH organizes women on  
the precinct level, encouraging  
pressure on the respective  
representatives because “these  
fellas are only interested in the  
people who vote for them.” Their  
goals seem to go beyond the  
rescission of the ERA to bigger  
and better things — like the  
presidential primary. A well-  
written, intensive letter-writing  
guide is available to any in-  
terested woman who wants to  
stack the mail in favor of rescis-  
sion of the ERA. Complete letters  
specifically tailored for “the  
working girls,” the editor of a  
newspaper, to the legislator who  
opposes the ERA and to those  
who favor the amendment are  
ready to be copied and signed,  
complete with “feminine”  
language and gross distortions  
and misinterpretations of the in-  
tent of the proposed amend-  
ment.

Maryann Sanfilippo, who  
recently accepted the position of  
assistant director for the League  
of Housewives in Colorado only  
if “nobody would tell my hus-  
band” feels that housewives are  
in a fight for their very lives.

Sanfilippo replaced Hilma  
Skinner who resigned her posi-  
tion in order to help the governor  
of another state set up a third  
political party, according to  
Stasko. However, other sources  
report that Skinner apparently  
fell out of favor with the powers-  
that-be in the league because of  
“personal problems.”

The new assistant director  
takes pride in the fact that her  
presence in the state house,  
scurrying around to get “for-  
bidden” bills and hard-to-get  
documents irritates legislators.  
She feels that the lawmakers are  
trying to pass bills that could  
“take our children away from  
us,” that would let homosexuals  
adopt children and have the  
same rights as everyone else.

The ERA: What It Will and Won't Do

Carol Lease

The proposed Equal Rights  
Amendment to the Constitution  
states that equality of rights un-  
der the law shall not be denied or  
abridged by the United States or  
by any state on account of sex.  
This does not mean that all laws  
that distinguish on the basis of  
sex would be kicked off the  
books, but rather that all laws  
must treat men and women  
equally.

Equal treatment could be ac-  
complished by either extending  
laws that give benefits,  
privileges or obligations to both  
sexes or by rendering un-  
constitutional laws that restrict  
or deny equal rights or oppor-  
tunities to both sexes. When a  
law gives a benefit, privilege or  
obligation sex-identification  
words would be struck so that  
both sexes would enjoy the  
same benefits. Examples of this  
would be laws that permit  
alimony to be awarded under  
certain circumstances to wives  
but not to husbands, extending  
social security benefits equally  
to both sexes and laws that put a  
2% quota on the number of  
women in the military services.

But where a law restricts or  
denies equal opportunities to  
men or women, that law would  
be rendered unconstitutional  
under the ERA. Examples of  
such laws are those that exclude  
women from state universities  
or other public schools; laws that  
put restrictions on the number of  
hours a woman may work or the  
weight that a woman may lift on  
a job; laws that restrict women  
from working in certain oc-  
cupations; laws that prohibit  
married women from making  
contracts or establishing legal  
residence.  
History of the ERA

The Equal Rights Amendment  
is not a new idea. Resolutions  
proposing such a constitutional  
amendment have been in-  
troduced in every Congress  
since 1923. Hearings have been  
held by the House and Senate  
Judiciary Committees and the  
ERA passed the Senate twice,  
once in 1950 and in 1953.  
However it was passed with the  
“Hayden rider” which said that  
the ERA “shall not be construed  
to impair any rights, benefits, or  
exemptions now or hereafter  
conferred by law, upon persons of  
the female sex.”

This rider accomplished its  
purpose of killing the amend-  
ment since the rider's  
qualifications were not accep-  
table to women who wanted  
equal rights under the law. The  
sponsors of the amendment said  
that it was under the guise of so-  
called rights or benefits that  
women have been treated une-  

Chocolate-chip Paranoia

The League of Housewives  
acts out an overwhelming sense  
of paranoia. Anyone who  
doesn't agree with and support  
their fears, if female, is a  
“libber,” and, if male, isn't to be  
trusted. The women who com-  
pose the membership are white,  
middle-class housewives. The  
only black woman left after 15  
minutes and a Chicana was  
referred to as a “girl.”

According to their literature,  
some of which is printed by John  
Birch associate Phyllis Schlafly  
and the Happiness of  
Womanhood, women who enter  
the job market are responsible  
for the unemployment that the  
country is facing. Men get sick  
because of the tension and  
stress they suffer as a direct  
result of women who are taking  
over traditionally male roles.  
Submissive sons who are being  
raised by aggressive mothers  
may turn out as homosexuals.

Among the league’s basic  
principles are: “a firm belief in  
God's plan to have a man as the  
head of the family; to preserve  
femininity which will inspire  
masculinity and chivalry in her  
man; to teach our daughters the  
joy of true womanhood: to  
become housewives; to return to  
patriotism; remove  
revolutionary teachings in our  
public schools; to achieve a  
membership of 10 million  
housewives.”

The women at the meeting  
were (obviously) extremely  
threatened by feminism. They  
see women's liberation as deny-  
ing them their right not to work.  
The Equal Rights Amendment  
would, they feel, take away all  
their rights as women such as  
the right to be supported, to stay  
home, to be protected by rape  
and prostitution laws. The ERA  
would also threaten their roles  
as wives, they insist, by creating  
more competition for their  
husbands’ jobs, by allowing  
women who were in the military  
or work with their husbands to  
freely associate with their  
husbands and “sleep in the  
same barracks,” and by making  
alimony and child support laws  
apply to both men and women.

During the meeting there  
were constant innuendoes  
about women who were active  
in Denver-area politics or  
women's groups and supported  
the ERA. A “chief libber” seems  
to be Bonnie Androcopolis, a lob-  
byist for NOW, who, according to  
one member of LOH would be  
delighted if we all dropped dead  
this minute.” I asked Bonnie if  
she would be happy over the  
deaths of these women and she  
emphatically denies it.

Cookie Senator Speaks Too

After lunch Senator Joe  
Scheffelein, R-Lakewood, came  
to speak to the “girls” (as the  
Senator says) about his efforts to  
introduce a resolution in the  
state legislature to rescind  
Colorado's ratification of the  
ERA. Nobody seems to be con-  
cerned that such a rescission is  
unconstitutional and wouldn't  
be recognized by the federal  
Congress anyway. Scheffelein is  
an insurance agent who is paid  
by his company for his anti-ERA  
work.

The Senator lamented over  
the fact that no Democrats had  
the guts to help sponsor the  
resolution making it “impossi-  
ble” to get it through the House.  
He says that he can always get it  
through the Senate, but the  
House of Representatives is like  
a “brick wall.”

He lost the co-sponsor of the  
resolution and now hopes to get  
an interim legislative study of  
the rescission so that all the  
effects of the ERA on state laws  
could be seen, something,  
Scheffelein claims, has never  
been done in Colorado. Whether  

equally and denied opportunities  
which are available to men.  
The Equal Rights Amendment  
was finally freed from the House  
Judiciary Committee in 1970 by  
Rep. Martha Griffiths, was pass-  

LNS

ed by the House, delayed in the  
Senate by filibusters and then  
finally passed by the Senate in  
1972. So far, 34 of the necessary  
38 states have ratified this  
proposed 27th amendment to  
the Constitution.

or not the resolution will go to a  
committee will be determined at  
the end of this session in June.  
Meanwhile he told the women to  
keep those cards and letters  
coming.

He commented that they had  
nothing to worry about with the  
opposition’s Bonnie Androcopolis.  
(Must mean she’s pretty effective, I'd say.) "Bonnie  
doesn’t bother me," Scheffelein  
said. “I live 2 blocks down the  
street from her and I know her  
lifestyle and it's nothing to worry  
about.” Meaning, I suppose, that  
he thought Bonnie couldn't be  
counted among the “opposition”  
that would be able to unload a  
truck and help build shelves in  
the new league’s office.

Then came the first indication  
of sisterhood in the meeting. A  
woman in the back of the room  
chastised the Senator for at-  
tacking a woman who was not  
present to defend herself.  
Scheffelein promptly and  
profusely apologized, reminded  
the “girls” to keep up the good  
work and fled.

I had seen and heard enough.  
My only regret was that I didn’t  
volunteer to be the “chairman”  
of the League of Housewives’  
mailing list.

ANTI-ERA Forces

Opponents of the ERA have  
created an extensive, well-  
funded campaign for the past  
few years and are intensifying  
their efforts in states where the  
ERA has not yet been ratified.  
Among those groups that are  
visible in the anti-ERA campaign  
are the John Birch Society,  
right-wing writer Phyllis Schlafly,  
the Ku Klux Klan, the National  
Council of Catholic Women and  
the Revolutionary Union. In-  
surance companies have, in  
some cases, blatantly opposed  
the ratification of the ERA and in  
other cases financed the in-  
fluenced anti-ERA groups and  
state legislators. Many in-  
surance companies have power-  
ful lobbies that work in the state  
houses and many legislators  
have been and/or continue to be  
employed by insurance com-  
panies. (See Majority Report,  
Jan. 25, 1975.)

In Colorado, opposition to the  
ERA has attempted to rescind  
ratification. The effort has fizzled  
this year with the sponsor of the  
resolution, Sen. Joe Scheffelein,  
R-Lakewood, now attempting to  
have the entire “question” of the  
ERA put in an interim legislative  
study committee at the end of  
this session. Meanwhile, the  
League of Housewives, a state  
chapter of the Happiness of  
Womanhood, continues to flood
