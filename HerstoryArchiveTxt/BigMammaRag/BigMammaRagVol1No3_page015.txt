/ Why this, ever, why such to be

remembered
Somewhere let the sun shine through- As remembered, unfortunately, it
its warmth must be?
Penetrating rays healing the ravages We have them with us so short a
of the storm. are time
And let the frightened storm-driven Ere a cruel, cold, despairing
soul respond world erases

Why then begin this cruelty, this
cold despair

Even in the so-called haven we
should else create.

To its warmth and feel the goodness
of growth
Of stretching forth in the pleasure
em: such healing.

For earth and flowers and trees- —— Love is so ill-used when ill-

tempered
Such waste of effort without real
warmth

Understanding—and the gentle rain

—— of rebuke is received then
easily because it senses the
reason thus given.

That even the monster puppy senses
this insecurity

In baleful glances because, puppy-
like, he has made a puddle...

We have these young beloveds for,
ah, such a little while
And they are gone.

seemingly unproven yet
determined thought--~

What memories do we feed their

heart? Let us guide, for this is needed-
What will they remember most? 
What memories do you, past youth, 

remember?

Is it not the sudden pain of being Because the storm frightens even

me who grows old, and older

unloved;
still cannot understand
or of treasures The tumult and the crash and the

blinding of the lightning
flash, 

There is so little time to speak
with love to these impatient
to be grown

And again the wild wind blows-

And the voice of thunder awakens
the blissful sleeper who
quivers with the crash—

The foundations of the haven, home, why and only the earth
are shaken. bruises the tender plants it

The haven is again torn asunder 

So, with angry words, ill-spoken, And the cry is for mercy, Lord—

unchosen spat out without
regard for inner sanctity
Spewn forth, never to be forgotten.

for mercy and for remembering
understanding.
