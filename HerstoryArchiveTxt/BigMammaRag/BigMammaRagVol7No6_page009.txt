International Year

of the Child 1979

Anno Internazionale
del Fanciullo 1979

Fran Day

This year is the International
Year of the Child. To recognize the
rights and meet the special needs of
children, and to spur government ac-
tion on behalf of the children of the
world, the United Nations General
Assembly of 1976 proclaimed 1979 as
International Year of the Child (IYC).
This year-long observance, set during
the Decade of Women, marks the 20th
anniversary of the UN's approval of a
Declaration of the Rights of the
Child, a document modeled on the ear-
lier Human Rights Declaration.

What is the status of children to-
day? Children in all nations are in
trouble. Twenty years ago when the
Declaration of the Rights of the
Child was adopted, the international
community officially recognized that
the special needs of children every-
where had not yet been met. They
still have not been met today!

Problems exist in “progressive”
societies as well as developing coun-
tries. More than ten million or 17%
of all American children live in ab-
ject poverty; this makes them the
most disproportionately poor age
group in the United States--even poorer
than the elderly.

INADEQUATE DIET

15% of American children suffer
growth retardation due to lack of an
adequate diet; a third have a vitamin
A deficiency and a third are so anemic
that they need treatment.

"An inadequate diet, however,
is only part of what makes poor
children in the United States un-
healthy. Most babies of poor fam-
ilies enter the world unhealthy
because their mothers have been
unable to afford prenatal care.
This is largely what accounts for
the astonishing fact that thirteen
countries have a lower infant mor-
tality rate than the United States,
the richest country in the world.
And the rate of infant deaths for
Black, Latin, Asian and Native
peoples is almost twice that of
the rest of the population."

(Shelton)

One million teenage (12 to 17) fe-
males become pregnant each year.

One in five teenagers uses drugs more
than once a week.

Over three million children run away
from home each year.

The suicide rate of children under
15 has doubled during the past decade.

500,000 children under the age of
16 are presently involved in the
multi-million dollar racket of child
prostitution.

Child pornography is on the increase.

Children are the targets of big
business which bombards them with dis-
torted and false information about
the nutritional value of food and
beverages, all to make a profit. Ad-
vertising and the media manipulate
them with sexist, violent messages.
They are subjected to a sexist, rac-
ist, oppressive educational system
that encourages competition instead of
cooperation in order to perpetuate a
patriarchal/capitalistic/imperialistic
society.

Is the International Year of the
Child providing effective ways of
combatting these problems? Disappoint-
ingly but predictably--NO! In spite
of his pompous remark, "I hope to add
the prestige and the influence of the
Presidency itself to making this (IYC)
a successful effort," President Carter
and his administration and Congress have
repeatedly dragged their heels. They
belatedly set up a national commission
with few powers and insufficient funds.
Local groups are forced to do their
own fundraising; the Colorado Coalition
for IYC (all volunteers), frustrated,
their enthusiasm dampened, is consider-
ing having a bake sale to raise money to
cover printing and mailing costs!

This disturbing picture does not
stop with hunger, malnutrition, inade-
quate health care, juvenile crime,
child abuse, incest, rape, child porn-
ography, child prostitution, teenage
pregnancies, drug abuse, suicide and
runaways--it permeates every aspect
of the child's life.

"Living in substandard, crowded
housing often without heat, having
no place to play but the streets,
sometimes left alone because there
are so few day care centers for
children of working mothers, at-
tending schools that are little
more than jails, and even in the
case of some Mexican children in
the Southwest, laboring their child-
hoods away at backbreaking work,"
(Shelton) the conditions of life
faced by children are indeed grim.

"Although UNICEF ‘contributed
$3 million to IYC ‘to assess the
needs of children of developing
countries', this is a mere drop
in the bucket, a paltry sum com-
pared with what is needed. The
UNICEF annual budget is one-half
of one-tenth of one percent, or
0.00057 of the world's annual mil-
itary budget." (Durkin)

OTHER PROBLEMS

In addition to hunger, malnutri-
tion, and inadequate health care,
American children suffer from addi-
tional assaults on their mental and
physical health:

120 million children born in 1979
will be 21 years old in the year 2000.
What are the prospects for these and
for millions of others who will be-
come adults between now and the start
of the 21st century? They face nu-
merous severe problems.

"According to UN statistics, of
the 1.4 billion children in the
world, over 350 million lack edu-
cation, health care and sanitation.
200 million are always hungry;
vitamin A deficiencies cause
250,000 to become blind every
year; and untold millions suffer
from intestinal diseases due to
unsafe or inadequate water sup-
plies. In those parts of the
world where imperialism is domin-
ant, despite all the so-called
‘aid and development programs’,
conditions for children are worsen-
ing. In those countries, 15 mil-
lion children a year die before
they're five, with malnutrition a
major cause of death. Malnutri-
tion also jeopardizes the physical
and mental growth of over 100 mil-
lion children under five and af-
fects one-quarter of the children
in oppressed countries. Less than
10% are immunized against child-
hood diseases and fewer than half
of school age children attend
school. Millions of young chil-
dren have to go to work at an early
age and are deprived of any
real childhood. " -77,000 youngsters under the age of
18 are in American prisons, with the
cost of maintaining each child run-
ning $17,000 per year. (This would
"support" six mothers with two
children each on ADC.)

-One million children a year are the
victims of child abuse; 2000 chil-
dren die from abuse annually.

-350,000 children are adrift in
America's foster care system.
They are shunted around frequently--
denied permanence, loving attach-
ments, the chance to trust and be
nurtured by continuously caring
others.

-One-third of all female children are
sexually abused before they reach 18.
Twenty-five million American women
were child victims of incest by
fathers, step-fathers and older male
siblings. Girls as young as nine
months have been raped.

-Thousands of children witness their
fathers battering their mothers each
year.

-Only 2% of preschool age children
whose mothers work have the benefit
of day care in the US.
