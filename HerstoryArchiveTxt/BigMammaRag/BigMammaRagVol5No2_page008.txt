Test Tube Boys

Fertility specialists are awaiting  
the births of a special group of  
babies that have a 90% chance of  
being male because of a new “sperm  
separation" method.

It involves placing semen in a tube  
containing a solution that enables the  
“strongest swimmers" among the sperm—  
also the ones most likely to bear  
the male producing Y chromosome—to  
settle at the bottom. The concentrated  
sperm, which has become 65 to 95%  
“male producing” is then placed in a  
woman's uterus. The method does not  
work in reverse—since the X chromo-  
some (female) is not isolated in the  
process.

Tests are being done in Iran and  
Switzerland, but UPI reports that  
the process is also being used at the  
University of San Francisco Fertility  
clinic and at Michael Reese Hospital  
in Chicago. No one knows the ramifi-  
cations of widespread use of this  
method in a world where male children  
are culturally and economically more  
desirable.

Chemical Aftermath

In Italy, women from the radical  
Center for Information, Sterilization  
and Abortion are publicizing the long-  
term results of last year's massive  
chemical plant explosion in Seveso.

All 171 children in zone A, closest  
to the accident, suffered a decrease  
in white blood cells and face the risk  
of cancer. Almost 1,009 people from a  
wider zone are affected by this, but  
the government is keeping quiet.

Insignificant

The Department of Labor recently  
announced that women "significantly"  
increased their participation in ap-  
prenticeship programs—up 66% from  
1973 to 1975. Nevertheless, women  
still account for just 1.2% of all  
registered apprentices and the great-  
est numbers were in training as bar-  
bers and beauticians.

of women's writing with an emphasis  
on lesbian-authored material, begins  
publication in March. It will pub-  
lish three times a year, and will in-  
clude features, fiction, reviews,  
poetry and critical articles on  
feminist issues. Manuscripts are  
welcome. Address is P.O. Box 56, Van  
Brunt Station, Brooklyn, NY 11215.

Edelin Acquitted

Kenneth Edelin, a Black physician  
convicted for performing an abortion,  
was acquitted by the Massachusetts  
Supreme Court in early January.

Edelin was convicted by an all-  
white jury in 1975 for manslaughter  
of a fetus, after performing an abor-  
tion in Boston City Hospital.

No Laughs

San Francisco NOW is urging a boy-  
cott of “the recently-published book  
Titters: The First Collection of  
Humor by Women." The head of NOW's  
media committee says, "The overall  
effect of this book is one of vicious  
sexism," citing chapter headings like  
"Jugs," “Boobs" and "Knockers," with  
illustrations to match. The book  
features contributions by Gail  
Parent, Peg Bracken, Phyllis Diller  
and Anne Meara. Lily Tomlin reportedly  
withdrew because she thought the  

title was sexist.

“Liberalized” Law

Israeli women won a “liberalized”  
abortion law Feb. 1, despite protests  
that it was a “license for infanti-  
cide." Clearly the perceived needs  
of the state were at issue. One op-  
ponent, a rabbi, said, "Why bother to  
lure Jewish immigrants to Israel when  
you discourage population growth..."

The new "liberal" law permits abor-  
tions for reasons of health, possible  
birth defects, rape or incest, age  
(mothers over 40 and girls under 16),  
and in cases where the pregnancy is  
likely to cause "severe harm" to a  
woman or her children because of  
"harsh social and family conditions.”

That last clause was aimed at  
Sephardic Jews from Moslem countries  
(55% of the population) who have a  
higher birth rate, but only 2/3 of  
the spending power of Israelis from  
Western countries.

Nervous Nurses

If the thought of being hospitalized  
makes you nervous, you're not alone.  
Results of a recent questionnaire  
filled out by 10,000 nurses across  
the country reveal that nearly 1/3 of  
them would not want to be patients in  
the hospitals where they work.

Most respondents rated the care  
that patients received as a "low B."  
Lack of care was attributed to too  
much paperwork, too little direct  
nursing and too few nurses.

Crimes in Iran

An international campaign is  
underway for the restoration of  
human rights in Iran. Crimes cited  
include the imprisonment and tor-  
ture of two women: One, sociolo-  
gist Vida Hadjebi Tabrizi, was  
arrested for "investigating the  
living conditions of Iran's peasant  
population." Her life is believed  
to be in danger. The other woman,  
writer Atefeh Gorgin, was arrested  
for publishing contemporary liter-  
ature and is believed dead. Pro-  
tests should be sent to: Mr.  
Ardeshir Azhedi, Ambassador of Iran,  
3-05 Massachusetts Avenue, Washing-  
ton D.C. 20008. Backing the pro-  
test is the Committee for Artistic  
and Intellectual Freedom in Iran.

Maternity Care Pays

The French government is investing  
more money in maternity services,  
particularly pre-natal care. Reasons  
are economic: Economists argue that  
a nationwide campaign to curb handi-  
caps in the newborn is worth 5 times  
the expense. Women are paid to have  
a thorough check-up with a specialist  
if they turn up within the first 14  
weeks of pregnancy.

Rape Didn't Sell

Men's socks bearing the slogan  
"Help Stamp Out Rape. Say yes." have  
been removed from department stores  
in Cleveland after 200 delegates  
from the state NOW convention demon-  
strated outside one of the stores.

Abortion And The State

Compulsory abortion for all “elig-  
ible women" less than 12 weeks preg-  
nant is just one of the provisions  
that will come into force in Maharash-  
tra, India. The Indian government is  
relying on sterilization to meet its  
population goals. Immediate target is  
4.3 million vasectomy and tubectomy  
operations, and the insertion of 1.14  
million IUDs in 1977. Meanwhile,  
the Laotian government has banned the  
use of birth control in an attempt to  
build up the nation's population, de-  
pleted after a decade of war. In  
Singapore, foreigners seeking to marry  
citizens will be granted a marriage  
license only on condition that they  
agree to sterilization after the birth  
of their second child.

Porn Protest

A Monticello, New York judge has  
dismissed obscenity charges against  
a theater owner for showing the porn-  
violence movie Snuff, in which a  
woman is reportedly killed. Feminist  
Jane Verlaine, who brought the suit,  
will appeal.

Women had already picketed the  
theater, collecting more than a thou-  
sand signatures asking that the film  
not be shown.

Verlaine's lawyer, Andrea Moran,  
had this to say: "Had the victim  
in Snuff been an animal, the SPCA  
would have protested; had the victim  
been a Jew, the B'nai Brith would have  
protested. But the victim is a woman  
and we are not being allowed to pro-  
test."

The question of obscenity was  
never addressed, since the judge  
quashed the subpoena which Verlaine  
had issued for a print of the movie.

Abortion Jeopardy

The U.S. Supreme Court will review  
three cases involving the rights of  
poor women to abortion services during  
its current term.

Two of the cases involve challenges  
to laws in Pennsylvania and Connecti-  
cut which deny Medicaid reimbursement  
for elective abortions, while allowing  
reimbursement for childbirth and  
“therapeutic” abortions. The third case  
involves a prohibition by the City of  
St. Louis on abortions in public hos-  
pitals.

Do It Yourself

Do-it-yourself abortions involving  
prostaglandins are being tested in  
Britain's Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford.  
Methods used include pessaries or a  
gel, which are said to be painless, but  
must be used early (within the first  
5 to 7 weeks of pregnancy). The invent-  
or of the gel says there is no reason  
why women should not be able to use the  
new methods successfully at home.

Young Shavers

Health Network

After a year and a half of plan-  
ning and action, the National  
Women's Health Network has formally  
organized into a nonprofit corpor-  
ation aimed at providing education  
and fighting oppression around  
women's health.

In late 1975, the group held a  
‘memorial' protest during US Food  
and Drug Administration hearings.  
The protest commemorated the thou-  
sands of victims of the Pill, DES  
(the morning after pill) and meno-  
pausal hormone therapy.

In August, 50 women met in Wash-  
ington D.C. to set goals, elect a  
board of directors and start an  
information clearinghouse. Write  
them at Box 24192, Washington D.C.

Small Is Beautiful

The Service, Office and Retail  
Workers Union of Canada, a small,  
independent, Vancouver-based union,  
has built strong links between the  
women's and labor movements in West  
Coast Canada.

Most members of the four-year-old  
union are women. Seeking an auton-  
omy they could not find in US-based  
unions, the union decided to place  
a high priority on giving its mem-  
bers the skills to deal as equals  
with employers. For example, each  
bargaining unit handles its own  
meetings and negotiations.

The union also opposes a per-  
manent officialdom. Officials  
are elected for one year terms,  
after which they must return to  
the job. Recent contract gains in-  
clude "family crisis” leave, abo-  
lition of dress codes and parental  
leave.

Dangerous Drug

The Public Citizen's Health Re-  
search Group warned recently that  
the FDA is about to approve Depo  
Provera for injectable contraceptive  
use. The drug is not currently ap-  
proved as a contraceptive, yet HRG  
says that some 10,000 women received  
injections for that purpose last year.

Depo Provera has been shown to  
cause cancer in animals and is asso-  
ciated with cancer, chemical steril-  
ity and birth defects in women and  
their offspring. The FDA is expected  
to approve it for patients who cannot  
use or will not use other contracep-  
tive methods—likely to be poor  
women who lack adequate information  
or proper medical scrutiny.
