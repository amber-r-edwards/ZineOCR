the making of Antonia

Portrait of the Director

Sandia

When the lights went on after  
the showing of Antonia, a film  
about the life of Antonia Brico,  
world-renowned symphony con-  
ductor, at the Women's Film  
Festival, Jill Godmilow, the  
director, came on stage to  
answer questions about the film  
and the woman Antonia herself.  
Godmilow is very animated.  
Much of the force and vitality  
from the movie has obviously  
come right from her. She carried  
this same sense of electricity  
with her when I interviewed her  
for BMR, between the hectic  
pace of the workshops and infor-  
mal discussions at Womanview.

This movie is not her first film  
effort, but it is clear that direc-  
ting it and distributing it have  
been enlightening experiences  
for her. The obstacles she has  
had to overcome have been  
meaningful.

One difficulty in distributing  
Antonia has been that it is a  
documentary. The term  
“documentary” has a stigma at-  
tached to it: educational as op-  
posed to entertaining. One  
significance of Antonia is that it  
has made the transition. Unlike  
most documentaries, which are  
hard-nosed news commentaries,  
this film is a sensitive,  
cultural portrait. When God-  
milow at first tried to sell the film  
to TV she met negative reactions  
about this kind of documentary.  
However, when the New York  
critics endorsed the film, their  
“expert” response changed  
some attitudes. CBS bought 15  
minutes of Antonia, to be aired  
in January on their program 60  
Minutes.

The reluctance of TV networks  
to handle the film is partly ex-  
plained by their attitude toward  
independent films: they have  
their own production  
departments, and their egos.  
They are concerned with ratings  
and don’t want to invest the ad-  
ditional money needed for  
specials.

Distributing in theaters in-  
dependently is also difficult.  
Godmilow says she followed  
some of the tips given by Jerry  
Bruck, of I.F. Stone's Weekly, on  
how to get into independent  
theaters. It is obvious that Jill  
feels, along with other feminist  
filmmakers, the need to control  
her own films. That means hav-  
ing a say over where the movie  
will be shown. She wants it to be  
shown where it can best be ap-  
preciated, even to the extent of  
lending it out for fundraising.  
Godmilow also felt women  
should know about the business  
side of the film industry as well  
as the creative; they need to get  
the expertise and the con-  
fidence. This was a point I felt in  
total agreement with. Denver  
has done very little of either  
aspect in terms of filmmaking.

She said this was related to  
the other exciting aspect of dis-  
tributing your own film. Going  
around the country, as she has,  
she has been able to meet other  
women filmmakers. It is this  
continuing dialogue between  
women that can create a  
network of feminist artists at all  
levels.

Godmilow wanted to express  
how much she had been  
affected by Antonia Brico’s per-  
sonal strength. At first God-  
milow had wondered if An-  
tonia’s abilities as a conductor  
would really come across on  
film. And Godmilow admits to  
being naive perhaps — that An-  
tonia would compensate for her  
life struggle by seeing herself as  
a pioneer. Yet for Antonia this  
kind of “star” statement is com-  
pletely out of character. She is a  
woman who has kept working.  
The struggle has been part of the  
meaning of her life. It is this  
honesty that comes through the  
film. Antonia demonstrates her  
own greatness through her  
dedication to her work, without a  
concern for the standard  
American notions of success. It  
is a tribute to Godmilow that the  
spirit of Antonia Brico comes  
across with every frame.

A Talk with a

Festival Organizer

Chocolate Waters

“It was a real struggle all the  
way through,” said a Woman-  
view film festival organizer,  
Christine Brim. Ms. Brim, one of  
the few feminists involved with  
the Iowa City festival, was ex-  
plaining the difficulties she en-  
countered while trying to give  
Womanview even a  
millimeter feminist focus.

Members of the sponsoring  
organization, Refocus, originally  
wanted the exhibition to deal  
with how women have been por-  
trayed in the media — how they  
have been seen in the eyes of  
various producers, writers, and  
directors. Brim, who is a student  
at Iowa City University, im-  
mediately recognized that this  
point of view was distorted. “The  
majority of people who control  
the film industry are men and we  
are always seeing how men  
view women,” she explained.

Brim’s attempts at convincing  
Refocus members that the work  
of women themselves should be  
the concern of Womanview  
were first met with skepticism.  
Negative arguments ranged  
from “women haven't produced  
enough good work” to “people  
won't go to see women’s films  
and we have to make money.” In  
order to debunk these myths,  
Ms. Brim set off for Chicago to  
“find everything I could find”  
about women working with the  
photographic arts.

Obviously she found enough  
and Womanview emerged as  
what it was — an exhibition of  
the products of women in every  
area of filmmaking and  
photography. Despite the lack of a real  
feminist perspective at Woman-  
view, it must be remembered  
that Iowa City is still a pretty con-  
servative place and that the  
Refocus group itself is inundated  
with unenlightened ideas about  
women. Christine Brim and any  
other conference organizers  
who shared her vision for  
Womanview must be commend-  
ed for their hard work and  
perseverance in creating a  
festival which proudly displayed  
the works of women.

skilled and creative and all the  
rest of it for years. Once we get  
past this constant proving  
ground perhaps we can move on  
to different levels of sophistication  
and understanding about  
women and films.

Reel #5 Women par-  
ticipating in the festival ranged  
from feminists to human beings  
to anti-feminists to others, and  
this may have been one reason  
why the conference often seem-  
ed to lack enthusiasm and a real  
sense of purpose. On the one  
hand we had film critic Susan  
Rice expounding humanism and  
director Sarah Kernochan ex-  
pounding Marjoe and three  
women from Louisville engaged  
all weekend in promoting port-  
folios of male photographers. On  
the other hand there were  
women like critic Julia Lesage  
exploring feminist criticism and  
filmmaker Julia Reichert ex-  
perimenting with ways to make  
movies on any subject from a  
feminist viewpoint. There were  
also the small feminist film-  
makers who were anxious to  
show their own work and to talk  
about the problems they were  
having with production and dis-  
tribution.

Reel #6 . . . There were many  
valuable workshops which took  
place at Womanview including  
one on how to get money to  
make films and another on how  
to distribute your own films. One  
of the most rewarding  
workshops of the conference,  
however, was the one con-  
ducted by Julia Lesage from  
Chicago about feminist film  
criticism. Ms. Lesage pointed  
out that when viewing a film she  
is “interested in noticing where  
the women are not” and went on  
to add that men are usually in  
the foreground while women are  
in the background. She also  
noticed that women characters  
are most often just necessary  
complements to male  
characters, and that women in  
films are primarily the  
producer's projections of what  
he thinks a woman is or should  
be. It was pointed out, however,  
that feminist film criticism must  
do much more than simply com-  
ment about the inequities con-  
cerning women and men in the  
production. It must go on to  
question the very basis of not  
only standard art forms, but also  
the basic life assumptions which  
so many people unthinkingly  
take for granted. Questions of  
class, sexual politics, and the  
predominance of sex and  
violence must all be considered  
in feminist film criticism. Why  
are these things predominant?  
Whose interests do they serve  
and for what reasons? What do  
these reasons say about the  
world in which we live and how  
it operates?

Womanview was a very en-

joyable festival, but it seemed to  
be just a bit out of focus. The ex-  
hibition itself left something to be  
desired in the way of really  
centering on women's redefined  
roles and vision concerning the  
moving and still-life media, and  
on how these media can be used  
as tools for effective social and  
revolutionary change.

Nevertheless, there was a  
wonderful variety of excellent  
films and exhibits, and we  
welcomed the opportunity to see  
what women in the industry are  
producing and how they are  
viewing life around them. Many  
of the films shown at Woman-  
view are difficult to find and the  
organizers must be con-  
gratulated on their success in  
having located them. The format  
of the festival, while rigid in  
some respects, could also be  
changed around to meet in-  
dividual requests if one was per-  
sistent enough. Schedules were  
not so inflexible as they at first  
appeared and the conference  
women were extremely helpful  
in trying to satisfy the needs of  
those who attended. One dis-  
couraging aspect of the festival,  
however, was the predominance  
of well-known women in the film  
industry and we couldn't help  
but notice that there was a little  
too much star tripping going on  
and not enough really productive  
discussion. Our hope for  
Womanview next year is to see  
more of a feminist focus, to see  
the prize money awarded ex-  
clusively to women, and to see  
more of the small filmmakers  
presenting and discussing their  
own works.
