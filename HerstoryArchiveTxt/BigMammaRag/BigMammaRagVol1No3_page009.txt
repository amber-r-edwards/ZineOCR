WOMEN'S RIGHTS BY LAW —— the 19th step forward?

The law functions as the skeleton  
of our society. It holds deeply  
rooted mores, prejudices and beliefs  
in a coherent structure.

A revision of the law almost nev-  
er precedes a recognized and strong  
movement manifesting a change in our  
system of values, but rather follows  
such a change. Even when altera-  
tions are made in the laws, if the  
social movement that caused the  
change was not broad enough or deep  
enough, then the new or amended law  
will have little effect. It will be  
ignored or interpreted so strictly  
by the courts that its range becomes  
extremely narrow and thus its power  
negligible.

Two examples of the above would  
be the Fourteenth Amendment of the  
United States Constitution (Equal  
Rights Under the Law) and the Nine-  
teenth Amendment (Giving Women the  
Right To Vote).

The Fourteenth Amendment was  
passed shortly after the Civil War  
and for many years was interpreted  
to apply only to discrimination in-  
volving Blacks. It took decades be-  
fore the U.S. Courts began applying  
the 14th Amendment to any irrational  
discrimination against recognizable  
groups within our society.

After the passage of the 19th  
Amendment giving women the right to  
vote, the women's suffrage movement  
seemed to slowly come to a standstill  
for many years. Women did indeed  
vote, but as far as the law was con-  
cerned, that was about the only  
change for women.

The Justices sitting on our high-  
est Court through their decisions  
over the past century reflected what  
was the predominant attitude in our  
society about a "woman's place."

Around 1872, Mrs. Bradwell wanted  
to become a lawyer in the State of  
Illinois. The Illinois Bar Associa-  
tion said no. She appealed and the  
case was decided by the United States  
Supreme Court. The Supreme Court up-  
held the Illinois Bar Association.  
The Court said through Justice Bradley:

"Man is, or should be, woman's  
protector and defender. The natu-  
ral and proper timidity and deli-  
cacy which belongs to the female  
sex evidently unfits it for many  
of the occupations of civil life.

The constitution of the family or-  
ganizations, which is founded in  
the divine ordinance, as well as  
in the nature of things, indicates  
the domestic sphere as that which  
properly belongs to the domain and  
functions of womanhood. The har-  
mony, not to say identity, of in-  
terests and views, which belong,  
or should belong, to the family  
institution is repugnant to the  
idea of a woman adopting a dis-  
tinct and independent career from  
that of her husband."

The actual legal basis for the  
decision was based upon a married wo-  
man's inability to make and enforce  
contracts. Only her husband could do  
that. Therefore the court was wor-  
ried about how a married woman could  
effectively contract with and for her  
clients.

The Court went on to say: "The  
paramount destiny and mission of  
woman are to fulfill the noble be-  
nign offices of wife and mother.  
This is the law of the Creator."

It is ironic to discover how the  
protective laws for women were ap-  
proved by the U.S. Supreme Court.  
The approval of such laws was con-  
sidered to be a step in the right di-  
rection for the labor movement.

In 1905 New York had in effect a  
law applying to both men and women  
which stated that no worker could be  
required to work in a bakery more  
than 60 hours a week or 10 a day.  
That law was challenged and struck  
down by the U.S. Supreme Court. The  
law in so far as it concerned men was  
unconstitutional as a violation of  
the right to contract and due process.  
Note that the law was unconstitutional  
only as to men. The door was left  
open.

In approximately 1908 the Oregon  
Legislature passed a law limiting the  
hours a woman could work in a factory  
to 10 a day. The law was challenged,  
but the U.S. Supreme Court upheld  
the law and stated in part:

"The two sexes differ in struc-  
ture of body, in the functions to  
be performed by each, in the amount  
of physical strength, in the capa-  
city for long-continued labor, par-  
ticularly when done standing, the  
influence of vigorous health upon  
the future well-being of the race,  
the self-reliance which enables  
one to assert full rights, and in  
the capacity to maintain the  
struggle for subsistence. This  
difference justifies a difference  
in legislation, and upholds that  
which is designed to compensate  
for some of the burdens which rest  
upon her.”

The critical language in this case  
(Muller vs. Oregon) follows:  
"...Though limitations upon per-  
sonal and contractual rights may  
be removed by legislation, there  
is that in her disposition and  
habits of life which will operate  
against a full assertion of those  
rights....Differentiated by these  
matters from the other sex, she is

properly placed in a class by her-  
self, and legislation designed for  
her protection may be sustained,  
even when like legislation is not  
necessary for men, and could not  
be sustained."

This language has been used up to  
the present time to justify a legal  
double standard for men and women.  
Thus sex became a valid basis for  
classification and a valid basis for  
differentiation.

Protective laws sprang up in every  
state "protecting" women from long  
hours, from lifting heavy weights and  
from such things as going into mines  
and so forth. In the first case,  

Bradwell vs. Illinois, the Fourteenth  

Amendment equal protection argument  
was not even raised.

The entire concept brought over to  
this country from England of women  
as chattels (personal property) be-  
longing either to their fathers or  
their husbands was enhanced by such  
decisions handed down by our high  
court. Up until the last decade or  
so, women in almost all states suf-  
fered from legal disabilities such as  
the right to contract by herself,  
the right to have certain kinds of em-  
ployment, the right to control her  
property or indeed even to have pro-  
perty, the right to go into business  
on her own, the right to be on a  
jury and on and on.

Women and children and idiots have  
been treated in very much the same  
way in our laws. The basis of the  
theory behind this grouping is that  
women, children and idiots must be  
protected and special attention must  
be paid to them. This attitude has  
brought some curious results.

For instance, many states up until  
a decade ago had special sentencing  
arrangements for women. The laws of  
a particular state would set forth  
the minimum and maximum sentence that  
one could be given for being convicted  
of a particular crime. An example  
would be 4 to 15 years.

All of this was done in the name  
of helping the woman, just as many  
of our laws regarding the insane and  
juveniles are made for protection  
but more often than not result in  
far greater harshness than a "normal"  
man would receive from a standard  
sentence for the same or a worse  
crime.

Most of these kinds of laws re-  
garding sentencing of women have  
been repealed or held unconstitu-  
tional in recent years. The 14th Amend-  
ment has been the primary vehicle  
for such declaration of unconstitu-  
tionality.

The part the law has played in  
maintaining much of the myth and  
prejudice about women is considerable,  
complex and revealing. The above  
barely touches upon the meat of the  
subject.

How our society finally reached  
the point of passing an Equal Rights  
Amendment for women and just what if  
anything that Amendment will do is  
an interesting investigation and a  
lengthy one.
