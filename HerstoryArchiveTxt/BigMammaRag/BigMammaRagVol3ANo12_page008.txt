High School Economics

Course

Sixty-five Northglenn High
School senior women are par-
ticipating in a pilot course on the
“free enterprise system.” The
ten-hour course was designed
by an Adams County Chamber of
Commerce task force. The pur-
pose of the course, according to
Dr. Cheryl Rabideau of the Colo-
rado Economic Education Coun-
cil, is to provide the students
with “a foundation upon which
they may begin evaluating the
economic trends of today.”

own kitchens. The strike was
designed to draw attention to the
women's struggle for equality.
Some men stayed off their jobs
to look after their homes.

Lesbian Mother Case

A father in Dallas, Texas, is
suing for the custody of his two
sons on the grounds that their
mother is a lesbian. What makes
this case unusual is that the only
central issue is the mother’s
homosexuality, evidence of
which has been ruled relevant
by the judge on the grounds that
it affects the children’s environ-
ment. Another unique aspect of
this case is that it will be the first
of its kind to be tried before a
jury. Attorneys for the father
expect a fight all the way up to
the U.S. Supreme Court.

Big Mama sent you.

too close to Christmas for
women from other states to mail
the gifts to their children. This
year, in order to avoid the last
minute rush, they would like the
toys to be gathered by December
10th. The early date will also
avoid package loss in the mails.

The Minority Women’s Task
Force is also organizing a Christ-
mas party for the children of
women from the area. Mac-
Donald's has offered to provide
food for the children during the
six-hour ride. The correctional
institute is allowing the women
to make cookies and punch for
the party. The party will be either
the 12th or the 13th, depending
upon the schedule of the enter-
tainment. They have engaged
Blinky the Clown to show at their
party. The need is TOYS.

Anyone wishing to donate
toys may drop the toys at 431 W.
Colfax in room 500, that’s the
Commission on Community
Relations. If you cannot bring
the gifts yourself, you can call
Brenda Tolliver at 297-2621 or

(623-1465) can also arrange for

Title XX...

From Page 5

These programs are set up for
people on welfare, supposedly to
teach them “on-the-job” a skill
that will enable them to get off
welfare and find a good job. In
fact, the training is non-existent;
people end up working off their
welfare checks at dead-end
menial jobs. The only benefit
goes to the employer who
“hires” WIN people. The com-
pany gets a worker the boss
doesn't have to pay a salary to.
The Welfare Department pays
for it. Welfare recipients with
daycare are threatened with
losing it unless they go into a
welfare/workfare program;
other parents on welfare are
“encouraged” (forced) to place
their children in daycare so they
can be trained for a job — and
the daycare center itself is
seduced by the possibility of
more government money to save
spaces for families on welfare.
Either way daycare is used as a
tool to manipulate and pressure
parents into unwanted forced-
work programs.

Prying Into People’s Lives

A section of Title XX that is
particularly insulting to families
is the provision entitled “Parent
Locator Service.” This so-called
service checks up on families
with a missing parent and pro-
vides money to track down the
“deserters.” Under the guise of
“keeping the family together,”
this provision can be used to
harass families, interfere in their
private lives, threaten them with
a denial of daycare, etc. What's
more, this money could be better
spent for more daycare instead
of paying for ‘peeping’ Uncle
Sam.

The most far-reaching guide-
lines for the restriction of
sterilization abuse in the United
States were approved
September 11 by New York
City’s Health and Hospitals Cor-
poration.

Although federal guidelines
had been in effect previously,
there was widespread steriliza-
tion abuse in New York's
municipal hospitals, particularly
those in Third World com-
munities. Between 1972 and
1973, sterilizations had in-
creased by 180 percent in
hospitals in predominantly Puer-
to Rican neighborhoods and by
20 percent in Black com-
munities.

The new guidelines were
written by an ad hoc Advisory
Committee on Sterilization that
included people from Third
World communities and re-
presentatives of the Committee
to End Sterilization Abuse. They
include the following provisions:

— Consent elicited im-
mediately before, during, or after
an abortion, labor or childbirth
will be presumed involuntary.
(This is necessary because most
abuses take place at these
times.)

— An elective (non-
therapeutic) sterilization may
not be performed sooner than 30
days following the giving of in-
formed consent by the patient
(the hospital treating the patient
must offer other methods of
birth control during the waiting
period). This allows time for the
woman to think it over.

— Patients must be at least 25
years of age and legally compe-
tent.

— The patient must be fully
informed that sterilization is
permanent and cannot be un-
done, and the risks and alternate
methods of birth control must be
fully explained.

— The consent form must be
written in the patient's own
language.

The adoption of the guide-
lines in New York City is a victory
in the fight against sterilization
abuse. Activists fighting against
forced sterilization realize that
guidelines aren't enough, how-
ever. The next step, according to
Maritza Arrastia, coordinator of
CESA, “is to ensure implemen-
tation of these guidelines and
education on their importance
and purpose.”

Also to be watched, Ms.
Arrastia says, is how the Depart-
ment of Health, Education and
Welfare responds to the guide-
lines. HEW pays 90 percent of
the costs of sterilization and only
50 percent of the costs of
abortion in city hospitals. When
it comes time to refund medical
programs in the city, HEW may
switch its funds from public to
private hospitals, where the
guidelines don't apply, to put
pressure on the city to rescind
them.

In addition, Ms. Arrastia says,
“CESA must step up the fight so
that adequate guidelines are
implemented on a federal level.”
In the last five years,
sterilizations have tripled
nationwide. In Puerto Rico,
where the government has
carried on a systematic cam-
paign to encourage sterilization,
35 percent of all women of child-
bearing age have already been
sterilized and alternative
methods of birth control are still
largely unavailable.

Recently, members of CESA
met with representatives of the
Puerto Rican Women’s Federa-
tion to coordinate activities with
them. They also plan to continue
the campaign for stricter guide-
lines in cities in the U.S.
