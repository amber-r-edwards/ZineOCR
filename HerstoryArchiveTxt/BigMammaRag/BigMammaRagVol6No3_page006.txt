Anita, Oranges, and Coke

Coca-Cola owns 35,000 acres of
orange groves which provide revenue
to pay part of anti-gay crusader
Anita Bryant's salary as promoter of
Florida orange juice, according to the
Community Alliance of Philadelphia.
As a result, the Alliance of more
than 35 representatives of business,
professional, and civic leaders in the
city's gay community has announced a
boycott of the popular soft drink.
Many gay bars across the country have
also decided not to Coke up. The
Community Alliance of Philadelphia

Wife Abuse and Saunas

The billboards blazed "Beat Your
Wife" in huge letters. In smaller
letters, the signs added, "Go bowling."

The Bowling Proprietors Assn. was
trying to catch the eyes of potential
bowlers. But what it generated in-
stead was a controversy with the
Spouse Abuse Center, which provides
shelter and counseling for victims of
abuse.

Carole Morse, Director of the center
at a YWCA, said that when she saw the
billboard, "I almost cracked up my car.
This is just the sort of humor we have
to stop," she said. "I think it is
just the kind of mentality that makes
this (wife abuse) the largest unreported
crime."

L. A. "Sonny" Frantz, president of
the bowling association said, "This
has been our first experience with
billboards and it might be our last."

“We mean 'beat' in the competitive
sense," he said. "It means take her
up to the bowling lanes and show her
who's boss."

Amazon Warrior Unearthed

Moscow, USSR: An amazon warrior,
buried with her war horse, spears,
arrows and gold earrings was unearthed
by Soviet archaeologists recently.
The remains of the warrior, who lived
in the 4th or 5th century B.C., were
excavated near the Moldavian village
of Balabany. The scientists were
working at a burial mound built by the
Scythians, a nomadic tribe of ancient
times who roamed the areas north of
the Black Sea.

Rape Victim Sues Landlord

In what may turn out to be a pre-
cedent-setting case, a woman who was
raped by a man who forced himself into
her Berkeley, California, apartment,
has sued the building's owners and the
realtors who allegedly assured her
that the apartment was safe.

The 21-year-old rape victim charges
in her suit that her landlords knew
that a rapist was active in the neigh-
borhood, and assured her that the
building was, nevertheless, secure.

Her suit, filed in Alameda County
Superior Court, contends that she
suffered bodily injury and permanent
physical pain, and was forced, as a
result of the rape, to give up her job
and move in with her parents in another
state.

The suit charges that police had
told the building's managers that a
rapist was operating nearby, but the
managers did not--even after this
reminder--install deadbolt locks on
the building's outside doors as a city
ordinance requires.

The woman's lawyer, Andrew Gillin,
says the suit will ask for punitive
damages from the realtors who manage
the apartment building the rape victim
lived in.

Ten Pins, Rolling Pins

Feminists in New York are protesting
the latest ad copy from the Finnish
Airlines. Finnair suggests that the
first sauna was created after a Fin-
nish man beat his wife--and she loved
it.

The ad says that Vilho Vatanen, the
Finn, created the world's first sauna
when he locked his wife in the smoke-
house, set it on fire, beat her sound-
ly with birch leaves--and discovered
that she loved it.

The advertisement was developed by
Garmo, Inc., a New York advertising
agency, as part of a $500,000 campaign
for the Finnish Airline.

A spokesperson for Finnair, Ilkka
Mitro, says the ads were not meant to
promote wife abuse, but only to make
the idea of a Finnish Sauna appealing
to potential visitors.

The ad, one of a series of four, is
not scheduled to run again.

Self-Defense in
Public Schools?

A coalition of women in Los Angeles
is demanding that self-defense train-
ing be taught in all levels of public
school following the brutal rapes and
murders of 11 young L.A. women over
the past month.

The coalition held a militant memorial
service on the steps of the city
hall for the victims of what has become
known as the Hillside Strangler.

Their faces veiled, the women wore
red capes to symbolize their rage and
recited statistics on violent crimes
against women.

The coalition is also demanding that
telephone numbers of rape crisis hot-
lines be placed in a special emergency
listing in telephone directories, and
that the city give more financial sup-
port to rape prevention projects.

Extra-Terrestrial Sexism

Alan Sreenfield, a Tampa, Florida
U.F.O. researcher and author of the
book Saucers and Saucers, has called
for a "task force" to examine racism,
ageism and discrimination against wo-
men in U.F.O. organizations.

Greenfield, who describes himself as
an anti-establishment U.F.O. research-
er, says that all major U.F.O. organ-
izations are hopelessly “elitist” and
"Waspy."

The researcher, who edits a monthly
newsletter called Ufology Notebook,
says that the task force should examine
racism and sexism in the presentation
and study of extra-terrestrial phenom-
ena, and if necessary, should create
a joint committee to "increase partici-
pation in Ufology by minority groups
and women."

Greenfield says that most U.F.O.
groups are (quote) “middle American
types of organizations” and that the
validity of U.F.O. conventions in the
future are endangered by the "elitist
and waspy atmosphere" already present
in Ufology.

Pickers Can be Choosers

The right of women to pick apples
in New York state was affirmed by the
Human Rights Division, which ordered
an apple farmer to pay two women a
total of $1,512 in damages and to end
his discriminatory practices. Three
men who had been refused employment
in the company of the successful com-
plainants did not fare so well; the
Division denied they had been discrim-
inated against because of ethnic back-
ground.

The Human Rights Division, however,
failed to explain why a carload of
five Puerto Ricans was turned down
simply because two of them were
women.

The complaint stated that Carmen
Torres and Sonia Torres, both of
Rochester, and three male companions
had been referred by the New York
State Employment Service to Irish
Farms, of Monroe County, for employ-
ment as apple-pickers. The owner,
Amos Irish, had approached the car
bearing all five applicants, examined
their referral cards, and informed
them that females were not wanted.
The Human Rights Division, ignoring
that an entire carload--which just
happened to be Puerto Rican--had
been turned away, ruled discrimina-
tion against the two women because of
sex. They were awarded $756 each,

the equivalent of the salaries they
would have been paid plus interest
of 6%. In addition to paying damages,
Irish was ordered to inform all rel-
evant employment agencies that he no
longer unlawfully discriminates.
Apparently it is not unlawful, by
this ruling, to discriminate against
men who accompany women who are un-
lawfully discriminated against.

Polaroid Gives Grant

The Polaroid Foundation has award-
ed a $3,000 grant to the Janus Coun-
seling Association. "What's inter-
esting," Janus organizer Donna Medley
said, “is that we requested money for
services for lesbian mothers. We
made the proposal such that it didn't
have a straight (non-gay) component."
Polaroid was the only one of 10 lead-
ing foundations, including Playboy
and Rockefeller, who responded favor-
ably to the grant request.

Medley, a feminist therapist for
five years, intends to use the grant
money towards an advocacy program for
lesbian mothers--explaining lesbian
needs to city and state conferences,
and opening a position for a group
counselor for nontraditional family
therapy. For information write
Janus Counseling, 21 Bay Street,
Cambridge, Mass., 02139.

Not Assault

Seduction,

TRINIDAD, COLORADO -- Colorado Dist-
rict Court Judge Dean C. Mabrey has
dismissed charges against a man ac-
cused of sexually assaulting a young
widow. Mabrey characterized the as-
sault, in which, according to the wo-
man's testimony, John James Montano
broke the door of her trailer home,
pushed her against the wall, fell on
top of her, started kissing her, broke
the zipper on her pants, and placed
his hand inside, as "an attempted se-
duction." According to the transcript
of trial testimony, Mabrey said, “While
there may have been a slight confron-
tation of some kind and perhaps a feel-
ing out by the defendant herein as
to whether he would make some time
with the victim...nevertheless, after
a very short interlude and upon the re-
quest of the victim...the defendant
did leave. This is more like an at-
tempted seduction than it is sexual
assault, albeit a little bit rough,
but that is the way I remember it. It
has been quite a while." Mabrey later
added that the prosecution had “utterly
failed to prove any intent at all"
by Montano to do any wrong.

issue for more on feminist responses to
our Local Archie Simonson, who urged
hopefully to meet the same fate.
