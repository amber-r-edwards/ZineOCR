Turned on Woman is a collection of  
songs written by Ruth Mountaingrove  
during her life. The songs are often  
extremely personal glimpses into her  
experiences and friends. Between  
clusters of songs she has nestled bits  
of autobiography that add intimacy to  
the printed lyrics.  

Some of the songs made me feel close  
to Ruth, especially after reading the  
notes that went with them. "Tea Kettle" and "Moon Song" both  
spoke of her relationships with her  
lover, Jean. The genius of the songs  
is that the feelings of both Ruth and  
Jean are felt in the lyrics. Perhaps  
this is what makes women's music--  
Because we are all women, we have  
been both sides of relationships and  
so we know that there is no real di-  
chotomy.  

I have heard Ruth sing her songs  
several times, yet I was most impres-  
sed with the songs that I have never  
heard. Many of her lyrics are image-  
provoking: "Witches' Song" and "Love  
Song" are two that I would read aloud  
(although Ruth and Jean both assert  
that everyone can sing with the wom-  
anjoy within her, I won't even sing  
to myself) any time. Both are pecu-  
liarly haunting at night.  

The tunes are fairly simple; Ruth  
insists that anyone can sing them. I  
must admit that the notes on the staff  
didn't look very complex. A very min-  
imal degree of musical talent is all  
that is needed, but not necessary.  

Throughout the book are pictures  
taken mostly by Ruth herself. Many  
of them are of Jean, but there are no  

captions to the photos, thus making  
them much more a part of the moods of  
the songs. Small graphics on each  
page, most drawn by Jean, serve to  
illustrate the point of each song.  
The title song is on the back cover  
and gives very aptly the entire theme  
of Ruth's first song collection:  
"She's a turned on woman...She walks  
tall...She's got it together...She  
knows who she is...She loves who she  
wants...she's a woman's woman...I'm a  
turned on woman..." Ruth and Jean  

and New Woman Press have one more  
turned on woman to add to their list  
after I read this book.

Art and Politics Shape Boulder Feminist Theatre  

Cheryl Peake  

The Boulder Feminist Theater Col-  
lective is busy performing and put-  
ting together new pieces. While the  
group has gone through several chan-  
ges in membership, and now contains  
only the original founders, Juliet  
Wittman and Dinah Leavitt, they  
have not slowed down.  

They have cast and are now rehear-  
sing a play with seven women. These  
five new women are not members of  
the collective but are working with  
them, at least for the duration of  
this play. Dinah and Juliet are  
hoping that some serious feminist  
actresses will soon join them in  
their collective effort to put on  
"high quality theater with a femin-  
ist content." They are committed to  
combining their politics and artis-  
tic talents into their struggle to  
define feminist theater.  

The collective first began forming  
in May last year. Both women have  
strong backgrounds in theater. Dinah  
has done most of her acting and direct-  

ing in universities and, except for  
four years spent teaching high school  
drama, has remained connected  
with universities. She is currently  
writing her doctoral thesis on femin-  
ist theater.  

Juliet has been acting since her  
childhood. She has done summer  
stock, repertory theater, and spent  
several years in New York trying to  
“make it." Last Spring, Juliet was  
teaching a Women in Film course at  
CU Boulder. It was there that they  
met. Both women had dreamed of for-  
ming a feminist theater group and,  
as they joked, since they didn't  
think that Boulder could support two  
groups, they joined forces.  

To start with, Juliet and Dinah  
placed an ad in the Boulder paper and  
the student newspaper advertising  
for women who "considered themselves  
feminists and actresses." The mean-  
ing of that was pretty ambiguous in  
the beginning, with most anything be-  
ing okay, remembers Juliet. "Obviously,  
now we have much tighter con-  
trol, more organization, more control,  
more together."  

From that advertising, a group of  
five women evolved: Pat Kenny, Jenny  
Donalds, Mary Lou Richter, and Juliet  
and Dinah. They began working toget-  
her, trying to define what they wan-  

ted to do, what they thought feminist  
theater meant, and what kind of pro-  
cess they wanted to use. They met  
several times a week, doing voice  
work, sound and movement exercises,  
and experimenting with different me-  
thods of expression. Originally,  
they had dreams of being able to do  
guerilla theater, march on picket  
lines, do serious theater, skits, in  
short, everything.  

They decided to focus on doing more  
"serious" kinds of drama. They began  
to look for feminist playwrights, for  
scripts, for anything which would  
help them know more about this unde-  
fined "feminist theater" and feminist  

repertoire. Their first performance  
was for the Women's Institute of Al-  
ternative Psychotherapy. They did an  
off-off-Broadway play, "Lemonade"  
which was written by a man. Dinah  
recalls, "we had some reservations  
about it, but we didn't have anything  
that was a play by a woman, and we  
used it." It's about two middle-aged  
women who on Memorial Day go out to  
the highway independently of each  
other to sell lemonade. After they  
get over their embarrassment, they  
start chatting and reveal the stark-  
ness and boredom of their lives, the  
fantasies that each has created to  
make her life more interesting.  

Dinah began corresponding  
with other women's theater groups  
around the nation, asking them for  
any books, scripts, printed materials  
or suggestions they might have.  

Their goal was to work out their  
own pieces, to create from their own  
lives and experiences a script, col-  
lectively. That is a long process;  
as Juliet says, "It's not like get-  
ting together and improvising or  
thinking up clever lines like you  
might do for an improv thing or skits.  
They envision it as an organic pro-  
cess which will grow from their own  
process and might even be the kind of  
play that would never stop evolving  
but just keep growing with them.  

They decided to start with scripts  
since that would be quicker, give  
them experience, and help build a re-  

They also did an adaptation of a  
skit done by the Alive and Truckin’  
women's theater group from Minneapo-  
lis. Several junior high girls get  
into an argument over who Frank loves  
most, and end up deciding that Frank  
doesn't matter anyway.  

After their first performance, the  
Boulder women's community heard of  
them, and they were asked to perform  
at several NOW chapter meetings, for  
a campfire girl meeting, Internation-  
al Women's Day, and several Women  
Studies sponsored events. During  
that time, Pat left them to go to  
France to study; Mary Lou quit to  
have her baby, and Jenny was working  
full time with the Women's Institute  
for Alternative Psychotherapy, and  
had no time to work with them.

No Lies, No More, Not Now is a  
captivating book of poetry by a sen-  
sitive and extremely talented poet.  
d pat mattie published her poems be-  
cause she wanted to share with other  
women her process of coming out--  
the struggles, conflicts, self-  
doubt, and the self-awareness, cour-  
age, fulfillment and joy. She pre-  
sents a moving collection of poems,  
possessing a flowing, lyrical qual-  
ity. When reading straight through,  
as suggested by d pat, the reader  
journeys with the poet through the  
experience of change and growth.  
The skillful blend of images, exper-  
iences and perceptions encourages  
the reader to relate to and inter-  
act with her poetry.  

The pre-coming out poem describes  
the mannequin-like, plastic exis-  
tence of a person not in control of  
her own existence.  

my life is like acting out a  
scenario  

the story purports to be about  
me but  

someone else has written the  
script,  

is directing it and I move  
across  

the stage assuming the posture,  
the  

tones and the emotions of  
someone  

else's ideas of who what and  
why I am.  

In "Tomatoes and Green Onions"  
pat discovers her deep attraction  
to another woman, only to realize  
the absolute taboo society places  
on such feelings. She was married,  
had a child, and spent fifteen years  
trying to play out an artificial  
role. "Finders Keepers" explores  
these roles.  

The coming out poems relate to  
many aspects of being strong and  
being your own person. They also  
deal with the very human traumas of  
lesbian relationships. "To Mark on  
Moving Day" and “No Lies, No More,  
Not Now" poignantly describe the  
interaction between d pat and her  
son--the feelings of a mother who  
must leave an uncomprehending child  
with his father and who later, in  
the second poem, faces the fear of  
his rejection, yet has the courage  
to be honest. "‘how do you feel?'  
I pry. ‘I'm not sure I under-  
stand how or why anyone loves any-  
one else,' you say, / ...‘if you're  
happy, mom, / that's all that  
counts.'"  

"The Bath" is one of the strongest  
poems in the collection. In Part I,  
we see the twelve-year-old child  
Patsy who is told to “help aunt  
maggie out of her bath so she won't  
fall." The child is afraid. "…  
the girl child / wants to run away  
from grey / hair, false teeth,  
sagging / muscles..." She tries  
"… to ignore pendulous breasts  
hanging / over waist line--eyes  
seized / finally by a mound of thin  
/ scraggly gray pubic hair." Patsy  
flees in terror. In Part II Pat  
emerges as a strong self-confident  
woman who loves and respects her  
woman's body. “It is no longer 1975  
/ but 1949 and aunt maggie / says  
"help me, child." but / today Pat-  
sy won't run. / instead Pat will  
dry, dress / and stride out the door:  
on her own, free, younger / and  
less afraid today / than at 12."  

The final eight poems are a de-  
lightful blend of fantasy, exper-  
ience and eroticism. A metamorphosis  
has occurred and the inhibited, re-  
pressed, unhappy woman that we met  
in the beginning of the book has  
been transformed into a beautifully  
integrated human being who is in  
touch with herself and her reality,  
and is finally free to love and be  
loved.
