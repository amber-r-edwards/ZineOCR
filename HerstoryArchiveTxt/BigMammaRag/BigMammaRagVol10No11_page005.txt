Native Women Win

A Canadian parliamentary  
committee, set up to investi-  
gate discrimination against  
native women under the Indian  
Act, has recommended the res-  
toration of the rights of In-  
dian women who lost their  
status because they married  
non-Indian men. The proposed  
changes would involve provi-  
sion of federal services, such  
as housing, medical care, ed-  
ucational help and a share of  
band resources for those women  
and children who would return  
to the reserves once their  
status is restored. (see Nov-  
ember BMR).

Medical Marketplace

Physicians attending the  
annual meeting of the American  
Society of Internal Medicine  
in Chicago were offered a  
chance to earn three hours of  
continuing medical education  
credit for taking a course  
called "The Medical Market-  
place: Coping with Competi-  
tion," taught by a "consultant  
on analysis of buyer behavior  
and development of marketing  
strategies."

Servants Strike

Domestic servant women in  
Nagpur, India have organized  
to protest low wages and some  
have won raises, according to  
an article in Manushi. The  
average domestic servant is  
employed in several middle-to-  
upper-class households and is  
dependent on her employers for  
loans, used clothing and food  
as well as for her paltry  
wages. Last December, 100 wo-  
men and girls and two men  
working as servants in Rahate  
colony, gathered to form an  
organization, Molkari Sang-  
thana. They sent a letter to  
employers demanding a wage  
hike.

While some employers reacted  
by raising wages immediately,  
others refused. Members of the  
union struck on Jan. 14. The  
strike was a great success.  
Nearly 500 women with children  
joined the march as it filed  
through streets where many of  
the employers concerned live.

After the two-day strike,  
many women got raises. Most  
employers who tried to sack  
their servants were persuaded  
not to by strike activists.

Lambda Indonesia

Indonesian gays have pub-  
lished the first issue of G,  
gaya hidup ceria, the coun-  
try's first newspaper for les-  
bians and gay men. The first  
issue contains an introduction  
to the 9-month-old group Lamb-  
da Indonesia, a regular col-  
umn designed to answer queries  
about homosexuality, fiction,  
a contact page and national  
and international news.

We're Not Serious

Perhaps you thought diamonds  
and Rolls Royces were status  
symbols. Following the mood of  
the administration, it's now  
military hardware that defines  
the person. And only the very  
best, like Grumman's E-2C  
Hawkeye, a flying six-ton rad-  
ar system that goes for about  
$33 million. As Edward Luttwak  
of Georgetown's Center for  
Strategic and International  
Studies says, “Anybody who  
doesn't have an E-2C or its  
equivalent is not a serious  
person."

No Circumcision

Kenyan President Daniel  
arap Moi has outlawed the  
practice of ritually circum-  
cising young girls in that  
country. The decision followed  
reports of the death of four-  
teen girls of the Kamba tribe  
after such operations had been  
performed. It appears the  
girls had either bled to death  
after inexpert operating or  
developed blood poisoning.

Violence Violins

Theodore Brenner has been  
fined $750 for what amounts  
to the murder of his wife.  
Judge Michael Fisher, having  
dismissed a charge of homicide  
by reckless conduct, reduced  
the charge to misdemeanor  
battery. Ann Brenner died in  
December, 1980, after a beat-  
ing administered by her husband  
left her with four broken  
ribs. The judge said he felt  
Brenner would punish himself  
"for the rest of his life.  
The fine was secondary to  
what he is doing to himself."

Veto Video Vermin

A national coalition of  
Native people, women's and  
anti-racist groups has been  
formed to fight a newly mar-  
keted video game called "Cus-  
ter's Revenge." The game, mar-  
keted by American Multiple  
Industries and designed to be  
played on an Atari machine,  
features a white man, Custer,  
whose object is to cross an  
obstacle course to reach and  
rape a Native woman as many  
times as possible before get-  
ting hit by a rain of arrows.

Colorado motels are featur-  
ing it. It is rumored that  
the next game will involve a  
black woman. For more infor-  
mation, or to help fight the  
game, contact: The Colorado  
Inter-Council, c/o Cynthia

Affairs, State Capitol Bldg.,

Pentagon Preps Press

The Pentagon has had a tough  
time convincing the public  
and the sectors of Congress  
of the need to vastly increase  
the Army's chemical arsenal.  
To overcome this opposition,  
the Army has initiated an  
"Army Chemical Action Plan."  
The Army, according to Defense  
Week, wants to neutralize pub-  
lic concern about "the immoral  
and inhumane nature of CW  
(Chemical Warfare);...and the  
fact that the principle tar-  
get for the chemical weapons  
will be the civilian popula-  
tion since it cannot be pro-  
tected." The Army's plan calls  
for improving contacts with  

"media/journalists (and) per-  
sons who are influential in  
industry, academia, etc.," to  

"explain" the need for in-  
creased chemical armaments.

Obscene - Not Heard

A Berkeley, CA, man, now in  
the hospital with more than  
an inch of his tongue bitten  
off, has been charged with  
attempting to rape a 23-year-  
old San Francisco college stu-  
dent. During the course of a  
“first date," the woman char-  
ged that Daniel M. Paul, Jr.,  
tried to sexually attack her  
and hit her in the face about  
10 times. When he kissed her,  
the woman bit his tongue, ta-  
king off about 1½ inches.  
Paul ran screaming from the  
house and was eventually taken  
to a hospital—where he was  
charged with attempted rape.
