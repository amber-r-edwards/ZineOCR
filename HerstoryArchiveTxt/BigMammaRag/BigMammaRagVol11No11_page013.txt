Up So That Their Cries Are Not Heard

sleepwalking-constant drowsi-
ness. During the press con-
ference the head shrink says
that her responses to the
"therapy" were an exception—
she says the exception

is that she lived. Again

the fear in us as ex-inmates
of the tortures done to us
at the hand of doctors

is at best dismissed or
seen as an added "benefit" of
the "therapy".

The action in Syracuse fo-
cused on shock treatment as
have several other civil dis-
obedience actions across the
country where many ex-inmates
and supporters have been
arrested. The all too short-
lived ban on shock treatment
in the city of Berkeley is
a good basis for continued
political action against a
single psychiatric "proce-
dure"—connecting it with
a broader politic defining
psychiatry as social control.
There was a resolution pas-
sed at the Conference to
call for a North American
Day of Demonstration Against
Electroshock in the fall.

It turned out that two of
the psychiatrists most iden-
tified with the suit to over-
turn the ban on shock have
ended up in court. Edited
from writings by Jenny Mil-
ler? One of the final ap-
peals to intervene in the
judgment which overturned
the shock ban was brought
by Manuela Scott, the attor-
ney that had been defending
Measure T—the shock ban—based
on information uncovered
by the Coalition to Stop
Electroshock. Martin Ruben-
stein (one of the 2 shock
doctors at Herrick Hospital
in Berkeley) was put on one
year probation for violating
the state law regarding ECT.
According to Scott's brief,
Rubenstein filed suit against
Herrick for suspending his
admitting privileges from
April 6, 1981 through July
5, 1981, followed by proba-
tion. The reasons for disci-
plinary action were that Ru-
benstein "had administered
electro-convulsive treatment
in violation of the hospital's
requirements regarding

"informed consent" and a "per-

sistent failure on Dr. Ruben-
stein's part to complete peer
review sheets". Rubenstein
was also charged with deser-
ting a patient in acute me-
dical distress. Rubenstein
had previously been suspended
on numerous occasions.
Scott notes in her brief
that Rubenstein was the sole
witness for the plaintiffs
who were suing the city to
have the shock ban overturned.
Rubenstein is currently
being investigated by the

Aside from Rubenstein,
the psychiatrist who has been
most identified with the
suit against the shock ban
is Dr. Ronald Bortman, pres-
ident of the East Bay Chapter
of the Northern CA Psychia-
tric Society, and the only
named plaintiff. (The other
plaintiffs are a variety of

ple coming for me. I don't
ever remember again the feel-
ing of terror that I had
right then.

I remember being brought
into this room and incredi-
bly heavy leather straps and
then they strap you down and
you're screaming and crying.
I remember thinking I could
convince them even then that
I was okay and that they
didn't have to do this. Be-
ing just incredibly scared.

psychiatric associations,
none of which are located in
Berkeley.) Bortman has also
been recently hit with scan-
dal, having been charged
with filing false Medi-Cal
claims and grand theft. Ac-
cording to court records,
Bortman took Medi-Cal
patients for nursing home
patients he never saw.
His bail is set at $72,000.
This last motion for inter-
vention and a motion for
consideration were denied
and are again being
opposed by the city through
Scott the assistant city at-
torney, and through the Coa-
lition to Stop Electroshock.
Being at the 11th Annual
Conference For Human Rights
and Against Psychiatric Op-
pression in May was like a
home away from home. Being
with lots of other ex-inma-
tes made me feel easier,
like "fitting-in" was easier.
When I got back to Denver I
had 2 nightmares over and
over for weeks...dreaming
that I was being kept locked
in a small closet and drug-
ged and drugged until I was
lost—couldn't get out. The
second was being in a large
meeting—all women. Suddenly
I realize that almost all of
'em are therapists, and they
accuse me of keeping friends
away from “help" when they
need it most. I try to tell

through my head. And just
the convulsions and then
waking up in my room. And
knowing from the very begin-
ning that if you had one—
you had eleven more coming.
I don't remember the head-
aches going away, ever. I
always had a headache.

Every one got worse. I
knew what to expect. I knew
what was happening. You wan-
na talk just being made ac-
utely aware of being power-
less, that was it. I could-
n't run away, I couldn't
hide, I couldn't play the
game they wanted me to.

That was my whole exist-
ence then; shock treatment,

about staying out of the hos-
pital—how little help there

is there. The fear that I
would be there forever. Eter-
nally kept from killing self

confined to death by
pain and psychiatry instead—
And I run for my life...I
tried to stop the dreams by
not sleeping, that proved

to be very ineffective. I fi-
nally decided that the best
way to end my dreams was to
make that contact with other
ex-inmates—that I really wanted there

to be a demonstration against

shock torture here in Denver.
Shock is done all over town

at: Denver Gen. Hosp., Colo.
Gen. Hosp., Mt. Airy Psychi-
atric Center, Ft. Logan Men-
tal Health Center, and more.
Mostly women are given
shock. The “side effects" of
shock, which are really the
effects of shock, are pas-
sivity, fear, obedience and
submission, permanent brain
damage, short and long term
memory loss, difficulty in
concentrating and reading,
incredible pain in your
brain/bones/muscles, head-
aches, and death. Four of
us, later five, formed the
Women's Psychiatric Inmates
Liberation Front. Wow, how
great to be in mental pa-
tient meetings. Exciting and

waiting for it, recovering
from it. I knew I was having
convulsions—I’d wake up
with black and blue marks
where the straps were.

For the first time in my
life I didn't have any con-
cept of time. I judged ever-
ything by my headaches and
electroshock and when they
were coming to get me.

A serious repercussion to
electroshock is the black-
outs. Even when I wasn't
getting electroshock any-
more I'd just lose time. I'd
just kind of not be anywhere.
