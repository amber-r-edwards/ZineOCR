Tallahassee Health Clinic Loses Suit

MD’s Win; Feminists Lose

local physician with conspiring to
close the Center and its abortion
clinic. Linda J
the Center
all over the country are outraged
at the court's refusal to hear
a case so vital to the health
interests of all women.

On October 1, 1975 the TFWHC
brought an antitrust suit against
a group of doctors practicing
obstetrics and gynecology at Tal-

inter-

lahassee Memorial Hospital. The
suit charged the doctors with denying
to those physicians who cooperated
with the Center “the essential
privileges of consultation

and professional contact with oth-
er members of the medical commun-
ity," thus forming a restraint of trade
of destroying the business of the
Center and creating a monopoly for
themselves. Because fees for abor-
tions at the Clinic were
substantially lower than they were
at the Hospital, the clinic was
performing an increasing number
of the abortions in the area and
forcing some doctors to lower
their fees.

The suit describes the doctors'
attempts to close the clinic by
refusing it the services of the
medical community. It states that
the Defendants coerced the physi-
cian with whom the TFWHC had a
contract to withdraw his services,
leaving the clinic without a li-
censed physician to perform abor-
tions.

Anonymity

The Center has since been operat-
ing with the services of two non-
local physicians. Subsequently,
local doctors who provided backup
medical care agreed to do so only
under the condition that they
remain anonymous. Further efforts
of the conspirators have made it
increasingly difficult for the
abortion clinic to obtain satis-
factory aftercare treatment from
local doctors.

The TFWHC charged that the doc-
tors' groups formed “a combination
and conspiracy in restraint of

the interstate market for abortion
services in the area. They were accused of
monopolizing abortion
services in the area.

The Center sought damages in excess of
$100,000 for actual
losses plus loss of profits and goodwill.

But at the heart of the five doctors'
convincing

On the day before the trial was
scheduled to begin, US District
Judge William Stafford granted
summary judgment to the five phys-
icians. In effect, he ruled in
their favor without allowing the
case to go to trial. The next day
the American Public Health Associa-
tion announced it would lend its
support to the case by filing a
friend-of-the-court brief in behalf
of the suit. The 50,000 member or-
ganization said its evaluation of

directors of the Center had failed
to substantiate their charges of
conspiracy in accordance with the
exacting standards of federal anti-
trust regulations. The doctors
claimed that their activities were
motivated by professional concern
for proper medical standards rather
than by commercial interest. Staf-
ford's order upheld the medical
profession's policy of self-regula-
tion and peer review and said the
attorneys for the Center had failed

Denver Girls Club Continues In

Crisis

The Denver Girls Club is in severe
financial troubles. It closed down without
warning December 24th, then re-
opened January 5th with a two-month
emergency grant from the Johnson
Foundation. The grant for two months covers the salaries
of the staff, and the mortgage pay-
ments on the club building at 601
S. Irving. The fate of the Denver
Girls Club (only one of two Girls Clubs
in Colorado) is dependent on more
funds being obtained very quickly.
The Denver Girls Club, which has
been in existence for 5 years, has
been operating on a hand-to-mouth
basis since its original funding from
Model Cities ran out. The Club, or-
iginally started by Dianne Ducca,
operated out of people's homes, then
a storefront before obtaining Model
Cities funds. The Club was able to purchase the remodeled
church which contains a gym, an arts
and crafts room, a playhouse, a
stage, and a teen center. The large
building, now decorated with several
large murals depicting Mexican themes,
is busy most afternoons with from 45
to 50 girls participating in various
activities.

After the Model Cities monies were
exhausted, however, the center was
threatened with closure, and in No-
vember '75 was forced to close for
several months. At that time funds
were secured under an LEAA grant
(Law Enforcement Assistance Adminis-
tration) program “interface.” With
these monies, a staff of five was
possible; an executive director, Con-
nie Artzer; program director Gail
Pierson; her assistant Roger Brooks,
a part-time secretary, and a part-
time maintenance person.
While the grant paid salaries,
there was not a lot of money for
program development, and it was only
through the ingenuity of the staff
and the dedication of the volunteers
that provided the number and scope
of activities available to the girls.
A work/study student from CCD/Auraria
taught a gymnastics/modern dance
class; other women ranging in age
from 15 to 30 taught such activities
as pottery, painting, and basket-
ball.

The LEAA money ran out this summer,
and the club continued to operate
this past summer only because of a
grant by Gary Oil Foundation for
an adolescent girls program. Using
that grant, the Club was able to stay
open 5 days a week from 10 am to 4
pm, and put on a more extensive pro-
gram of classes in swimming, camping,
pottery, and tennis. (The tennis
team was second in the City League.)
Some girls were also able to attend
Beaver Ranch Camp.

Since this summer, the club has
existed on small donations and spare
monies. The work hours of staff
have been cut back and more reliance
has been placed on volunteers.
With the help of volunteers, a work/
study student, and much unpaid overtime
work by the staff, there is
a basketball team, drama
arts and crafts for girls
up. A lot of
to the center to hang
school to play with the
Particularly since a lot of
parents work, this is an excellent situation.

One of the most
programs, currently run by Pauline
Perko, is a group for young mothers,
aged 18 or younger. Pauline, who
was a volunteer for 8 months before
being hired as assistant program
director, believes that this
group helps alleviate the isolation that often happens
to young mothers. The group
provides a place to learn about nutri-
tion, parenting, childbirth, and is a social gathering place.

On October 1, 1975, the TFWHC
fought the allegations,

again claiming that it has represented one of
the feminist health movement's first
major attacks on the brutality
against women perpetrated by the
medical specialty of obstetrics
and gynecology.
A large group assembled
for the press conference,
carrying signs that read
“Support the Judge,”
“Stafford,” and “Boycott Local Ob/
Gyn's.” The demonstration moved
from the steps of the federal building to the Tallahassee Memorial Hospital. An editorial in a local newspaper called for intervention by the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department.

On December 14, the attorneys for
the Tallahassee Feminist Women's
Health Center filed a motion asking
for a rehearing of the suit. If the
rehearing is not granted, the suit
will be appealed to the Fifth Cir-
cuit Court in New Orleans. The
appeal could take two years or
longer.

Ms. Curtis says that local women
are supporting the Center in every
way possible and that their business
continues to grow although expansion
of the Center is curtailed by the
expenses of the suit. So far the
court case has been financed by
the Center, by private donations,
and by a grant from the Southern
Law Center.

Crisis
The program has been so successful
that Jefferson County is exploring the
possibility of bringing women down
to Denver to participate.

The continuation of any of the
programs at the Girls Club is very
conditional at this point. The
executive director is currently
talking with several funding organiza-
tions, and hopes that one will come
through with the $40,000 needed per
year. The Club has previously ap-
plied to many of these institutions
before, such as United Way, for fund-
ing. (The United Way is a big contri-
butor to Boys Club. The Denver Boys
Club is housed in a $3.5 million
facility.)

Most of these foundations,

Club down for various reasons.
