Preparing To Die And Fighting To Live:

Judy Barlow

When the symptoms first
appeared, I ignored them
thinking that I was just
overly tired. In retrospect
I can see that I had some
pretty destructive attitudes
about myself. Things like
working to the point of ex-
haustion where I didn't have
to take time to figure out
what was wrong with my body.
I worked so much that I was
always tired and then firmly
convinced myself that my
physical symptoms were merely
signs of exhaustion that
could be cured by sleep.

Looking back I remember
that some of my friends had
expressed their concern for
me months before I ever ad-
mitted that I might be sick.
I don't know if I can really
explain my behavior at that
time except to say that I was
very frightened. I felt like
I was somehow losing control.
I found myself reaching for
objects that weren't where I
thought they were and walking
into or stumbling over things
that were there. When my
friends suggested there might
be something wrong with me,
their recognition that I had
a problem terrified me. They
made it hard for me to ignore
my problem and I resented
them for that.

I don't remember exactly
how long I played that game--
several months I expect. In
that period of time I think
that I really alienated a lot
of people who cared about me.
How lucky I am that they were
still there for me later when
I realized that I did need
them.

What finally forced me to
face up to my problem and
seek medical help were a
series of frightening events.
My job involved driving a
company truck to customers'
homes to repair televisions.
I found that I was getting
electrical shocks and burning
myself daily in the course of
doing my job. I had several
near accidents driving the
truck and once blacked out
while driving. But the
clincher was when I woke up
on my living room floor with
my head bleeding. My seven
year old son was holding me
in his arms and crying, “Mom-
my don't die." That night
terrified him so much that
later he denied that it had
ever happened. I realized
that my behavior was not only
destructive to me, but it was
also somehow hurting everyone
I touched.

I think that the tension
and worry were especially
hard on my lover and son. My
moods and behavior became
pretty unpredictable. It
hurt me so much to think
about losing them that I
think I shut them out a lot.
From time to time I felt that
the three of us would get
very close to coping with the
situation and then some lit-
tle thing, anything would hit
me the wrong way and I would
cry and everyone cried a lot.
I think we were all pretty
angry too and really didn't
know where to focus that ang-
er. I wish that I could have
shared more with them. I
wish we had talked more about
our fears. Although we have
all survived the ordeal, we
all carry scars. I wonder if
they ever will heal complete-
ly.

By the time I sought medical
help I was doing poorly in
my job. All of my personal
relationships were strained.
I was not able to carry my
fair share of work as a
BMR collective member. I
frequently was unable to
keep myself fed and cleaned.
In short, I felt totally use-
less and so depressed. And
the really sad thing about
all of this is that it didn't
have to be this way. I was
paralyzed with fright, but
I was pretty much unconscious
of it. I never really
thought about or even recog-
nized what I was doing and
I wouldn't let anyone tell me
anything.

I understand now that a lot
of my behavior was influenced
by my need to be strong, in-
dependent and self-sufficient.
I had had a somewhat incapac-
itating illness once before
and I had promised myself
that I would never let it
happen again. Accepting an
illness meant to admit my
weakness, become dependent
on others and to go back on
a promise I had made to my-
self. And so I walked into
the clinic with feelings of
failure, depression and de-
feat. I felt that my body
had betrayed me again.

The medical horror stories
that I could tell are so
numerous that I can't include
all of them here. Like the
time I was intimidated into
signing a medical release
in order to get an experi-
mental drug that was potent-
ially very dangerous. I was
told, in effect, that if I
didn't agree to this risky
treatment that I would die.
In the last three years I
have seen over 50 doctors of
every rank and specialty and
many of these medical encount-
ers have brought pain and
intimidation if not a sense
of incredible fear and hope-
lessness.

I was tested for a string
of dreaded diseases and dis-
orders from multiple sclero-
sis to brain tumors to leuk-
emia. I saw a doctor several
times a week and followed all
of their orders and still I
felt only worse and worse and
worse. I finally had to stop
working because I was no
longer able to do my job.
While the doctors came and
went with one test and poss-
ible diagnosis after another
I became so physically un-
stable that I was afraid to
be at home alone and yet I
did not want anyone around
me either. Then my sick
leave from work ran out and
I found myself with no means
of income.

I had disability insurance
through my job and at first
was not really worried about
having money to live on. I
was still busy patting myself
on the back for having taken
out the option insurance
when I read the fine print on
the policy that said there
was a 20 week waiting period
before I could be eligible
for disability benefits. I
then called Social Security
to ask about their disability
benefits and was told that
I was not eligible unless I
"planned on being disabled
and unable to work for a
year." Well, no, I didn't
plan for it to last a year.

I didn't plan on any of it.

I then called welfare and
was told that I could get
ADC and food stamps if I quit
my job. I felt that since I
had paid premiums for my
disability insurance and had
good health coverage through
my job that I should not re-
sign. I also intended to
return to that job with the
seniority that I had accumul-
ated. The point that I want
to make is that not only was
my health failing and my life
in such turmoil, but I had
the added worry of not having
money for basic survival. I
didn't know where to turn.

In the meantime the big
doctors, although unsettled on
a diagnosis, told me that at
the rate my physical condi-
tion was deteriorating that
unless something could be
done to reverse the status
quo that my life was in
danger.

I can't think of any other
event in my life that had as
much impact as the day my
doctor told me to prepare
myself to die. I was strick-
en with some unnamed and un-
known illness that caused

“these puss should take care
of everything, dear.

One Woman's Journey Through Health

black-outs, double vision,
poor eye-hand coordination
and depth perception, anemia,
seizures and general useless-
ness.

After I left the doctor's
office, I came home and just
sat. I thought “why me?"
and listed and relisted all
of the reasons I should live.
During the course of that day
my mood and behavior changed
every 5-10 minutes. One
moment I vowed with determin-
ation to fight this thing and
beat it down, the next I was
crying hysterically with
grief and despair. That
night the BMR collective had
a discussion meeting schedul-
ed at my house. I think that
I began the meeting by drop-
ping my "news". I don’t re-
member exactly what happened
that night but I do remember
a lot of emotional intensity.
I remember feeling so fright-
ened and self-conscious and
yet removed. I think that I
was very uncomfortable with
everyone being so sad for me
and not many seemed to know
how to handle the situation
either. I insisted that the
discussion continue (I don't
even remember what the topic
was) and I guess it
was a farce. No one could
concentrate and I didn't even
try.

How can I describe the de-
spair and hopelessness that
followed--how depression and
anger dominated my life? Even
now, almost a year later I
can't force myself to write
more about dealing with death
because you see, I'm still
fighting.

The following are edited
versions of selected journal
entries I wrote during the
spring and summer of 1980:

Sometimes I can smell myself.
Antibiotics, medicine, vita-
mins, chemotherapy. I feel
dirty. It's the kind of dirt
that can't be washed off. No
matter how hard I scrub. An-
other layer just grows back.
I feel contaminated--like I'm
polluted--polluted with toxic
wastes that come in pills and
syringes. When I look in the
mirror I think "Certainly
that can't be me." Must be

a mistake so pale and sunken.
Reminds me of the time when

I was 16 and worked as a
nurse's aide in the geriatric
ward. It smelled like death,
decay. Like me.

It's funny about odors and
aromas. What I remember most
about my childhood are the
smells. The hospital. The
antiseptic smells in the lob-
by and hallways. The smell
of fever and diabetes and
cancer and old age. Of in-
continence and surgery and
blood and drugs...

It all comes back to me when
I go to the hospital or the
doctor's office. and I won-
der, "Is this how it's all
going to end for me?" I cry
a lot. I feel so alone. It's
the kind of loneliness that
I think that only the termin-
ally ill can really under-
stand. No amount of friends
or good politics can comfort.
While I am dying, I am alone
because there ain't no one
coming along but me.

So what do you do when you're
sitting in the stench of your
own body? How can you let
anyone near? I talk on the
phone. Keep a distance. ~
Don't touch. Don't hug.
Please don't look too closely.
I can't believe it's me.

Sometimes I think I can actu-
ally feel bacteria or toxins
swimming around in me. My
body is dying and it's taking
me down with it. I’ve lost
control. Sometimes I wish
that I could believe in God
so that I could at least have
someone to beg for help. I
understand why so many people
get really religious when
they get old or sick. I mean,
if you really believe in God
at least you've got someone
along for the ride. But not
me. All I got is me and I
don't look so good anymore.

My friends look so concerned.
Uneasy. We talk about commun-
ity and responsibility. Some-
times we even laugh together
and for a moment or two I
forget to remember what's
ahead. How do I feel? Noth-
ing new. What do I feel? I
can't explain. And it moves
me to tears when I understand
how much some really care--
how much I really care. How
can I explain how their love
and support makes me so high
that I know that I can sur-
vive? How a real revolution-
ary feminist can fight most
anything. But I'm so tired
that I fear I'll just give
in. Certainly death can be a
welcome relief. How can I

depend on their love and
support now? Sometimes it
seems like an escape from my
reality. And the smell. Cer-

tainly they've noticed.

When she said how much she
cared for me. How it made her
hurt inside and that she just
wanted me to know how much
she cared, I wanted so to
tell her too how happy I have
been just to know her. But
the words wouldn't come. And
then all of us laughed--a
nervous, uneasy kind of laugh.
"Wish you would let us know
what's going on," someone
said. "You send out such
double messages that we don't
know what to do." I want to
say that I'm dying and I'm
scared and alone and there's
nothing you or anyone can do
so just fuck it, all right.

I can't deal with it all in

a right-on manner. I mean
I'm scared shitless and I
just don't know what else I
can say. And the silence, my
silence, my double messages
lock them out and leave me
alone. So alone that perhaps
I'm really ready to die.

At last I agreed to go into
the hospital for tests. I had
resisted being admitted as an
inpatient and had done all
tests on an outpatient basis
because I was convinced that
if I was admitted to the hos-
pital that I would never get
out alive. I felt that as
long as I was at home I had
some control, that somehow I
could wage a better fight and
maybe win.

A few days before I was
admitted to the hospital an-
other woman I knew was admit-
ted to the same hospital with
symptoms which, although dif-
ferent than mine, seemed like
they might be related. I
mentioned this to my doctor
and he said he would check it
out. To make a long story
shorter, the other woman, who
is an open lesbian, was found
to have a brain tumor and
underwent surgery. When my
test results pointed to no
specific diagnosis, my doctor,
using the guilt-by-association
theory, assumed that lesbian-
ism was at the root of my
health problems and abruptly
referred me to a sex therap-
ist.

In 24 hours my diagnosis
was changed from being term-
inally ill to being a sexual
pervert. The whole situation

blew me away. I was so stun-
ned that I didn't know how to
react. I knew that my physical
symptoms were in no way re-
lated to sexuality. I believe
this doctor was dangerous to
my health and it concerns me
that doctors like him are
allowed to threaten people's
lives because of their own
prejudices and hang-ups.

So many women I have

talked with since have told
me other first-hand accounts
of what I would consider gross
malpractice.

My feminist friends' sup-
port was really helpful to me
at this point because they
helped me direct my anger in
a constructive direction
instead of directing it in-
ward. In a sense I guess my
friends helped me to take
control of my situation. A
woman that I hadn't seen in
a long time seemed to appear
out of the blue and was able
to convince me to seek help
from a doctor who had helped
her with an unusual health
problem. She shared her hor-
ror stories about the trad-
itional, male-dominated medi-
cal community. Unlike any
of my previous experiences
with the medical profession
this doctor had a holistic
approach to health and heal-
ing. My friend was leaving
the country in a few days and
made me promise her to see
this doctor. In a way, I
guess, her visit changed my
life. It was to be my first
step on the road to recovery.
As I understand it the
holistic approach to health
concentrates on promoting
health rather than just
diagnosing and treating ill-
ness.

Within a short time I
had undergone some tests,
been diagnosed and treatment
was begun. All treatment was
thoroughly explained and
alternative courses of action
were also discussed. This
doctor, instead of speaking
to me from a pedestal, talked
with me and readily admitted
