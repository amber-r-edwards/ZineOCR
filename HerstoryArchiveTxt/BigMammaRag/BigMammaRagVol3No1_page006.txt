Letter to Denver

Feminist Guide to Tucson

May 19, 1974  
Hello

all you Denver sisters! I’m from Tucson and am

finishing a long weekend stay in Denver, which has turned out to  
be one of the best times I have had in your city. This is the first  
time I have been here alone, so I decided to try to contact some  
Feminists and check out what’s going on here.

I was a little uneasy about calling up total strangers and

saying, “Hi. My name is Barbara,

I'm from Tucson and I want to

meet some Feminists here.” But after a couple of beers and a  
long-distance call to Tucson to gain energy from my sisters

there, I got up enough courage

to make my first call.

First, I called The Women’s Voice and got the number of the  
Women in Transition (WIT) House. From there on it was easy!  
The sisters at WIT House were warm, friendly and full of  
information about what was going on in Denver--complete with  
names and telephone numbers. But most of all, they made me  
feel like an accepted friend, not a stranger to be tested out.

There has not been enough time on this visit for me to connect  
with all the programs, activities, and sisters in Denver that I have

learned about. Fortunately, I am  
returning in June and will have  
more time to follow through with  
my “mission.” Everyone that I  

did meet, however, was very interested about what was going on  
in Tucson. So it seemed a good idea to try to give you a picture of  
the situation in my town and some contacts, in case you are

interested.  
Overview of the Community  
Setting

Tucson is roughly one-third  
the size of Denver. We suffer  
from over-population, urban  
sprawl, and an unfortunate  
tendency toward “Californi-  
zation.” The community is  
surrounded by mountains,  
which gives a feeling of  
strength and security and  
allows an easy “escape” from  
the city.

I would describe the general  
atmosphere of Tucson to be  
friendly, mellow, low-parano-  
ia. There seems to be an  
attitude of co-existence so  
that it is fairly easy to pursue  
a different life-style. Contrary  
to popular opinion, Tucson is  
not a community of mostly  
retired people. Young “freaks”  
are more visible than the old  
folks.

Given the political conser-  
vatism of Arizona and the  
smaller size of Tucson, it  
came as a surprise to me to  
realize that Tucson is devel-  
oping into something of a  
“hot-spot” of Feminist activity  
in the Southwest. There is, for  
example, a lot more going on  
in Tucson than in Phoenix.  
Here is a list of some of the  
organizations and activities  
currently in Tucson.

Tucson Women’s Center -  
912 E. Sixth St. 792-1929

Provides a place for wo-  
men’s groups for meetings  
and social events. Transient  
women can crash there for up  
to two nights while they get  
their feet on the ground and  
locate other lodging. Acts as a  
resource-information center.

Generally, the center has  
two-to-four full-time residents  
who help pay the rent. Other  
donations are solicited  
through individual monthly  
pledges from local Feminists.  
Persons using the center are  
urged to contribute 25 cents  
each time.

Alternatives for Women

40 E. 14th Street, #5 884-9776  
A Feminist counseling /  
consultation service, this is  
where I fit in. In December of  

last year, three women--two  
psychologists and a social  
worker (that’s me) formed a  
partnership to create an  
alternative mental health ser-  
vice for the women of Tucson.

For us, “Alternatives” is a  
place where we can utilize our  
skills and develop new skills  
in a way that is not  
exploitative of women who  
seek our services. We heartily  
reject the traditional “thera-  
pist” role since this puts the  
“other” in the role

of “patient.”  
The therapist/patient role  
model assumes a hierarchi-  
cal, one-up / one-down  
relationship, focusing on the  
“patient's” weaknesses. It  
also makes assumptions a-  
bout the strengths and super-  
ior skills of the “therapist”  
that make us uncomfortable.  
So we prefer to act as  
consultants and friends to the  
women we work with and  
focus on their strengths.

Right now we are doing  
mostly individual work, with  
some groups going and others  
planned. Ann has a con-  
sciousness-raising group go-  
ing, and will be starting  
another soon. I have a  
Bodywork for Women group  
on Wednesday nights that  
includes yoga, massage and  
belly dancing. It’s an open  
group, so that a woman can  
drop by any Wednesday she  
feels inclined; she doesn't  
have to sign up for a series.  
Dorothy is working on a  
Lesbian Identity group.

We are a low-profit organi-  
zation. The client sets her own  
fee based on her own assess-  
ment of what she can afford.  
We explain that we need an  
average of $8 per visit and that  
every dollar above that helps  
for those who must pay less.  
It works! Most weeks we  
average close to $8 per visit.  
But we would like to find  
sources of support so that we  
aren’t totally dependent on  
fees.

Minerva - Feminist Astrology  
Center 415 N. 4th Ave.  
792-3715

Located in the loft of  
Antigone Books, this is a  
brand new organization form-  
ed by one of the women of  
“Alternatives for Women,” a-  
long with two others. “Alter-  
natives” refers all those  
seeking astrological consul-  
tation to Minerva, since in  
order to practice astrology in  
Tucson, one must pay $300 to  
be licensed as a fortune-teller.

ley, Debbie Dobson, Dorothy  
Riddle.  
Women’s Self-Help and Gyn-  
ecological Clinic - 256 S.  
Scott 622-8821

A part of the Tucson Free  
Clinic, the Women's Clinic is  
open on Monday nights to  
offer free gynecological care.  
The clinic is staffed by  
volunteer Feminist-oriented  
patient advocates and nurses,  
with a local gynecologist  
standing by for consultation.  
Instruction in gynecological  

self-help (do your own pelvic  

exam, etc.) is offered but not  
pushed on women attending  
the clinic. The atmosphere is  
warm and relaxed. Contact:  
Coleen Elegante.  
Fifth Avenue House - 847 S.  
Fifth Ave. 792-1890

This is a collective formed  
by five beautiful women.  
Although a private home, it is  

a core of feminist activity in  
Tucson. It is through Fifth  
Ave. that we have established  
and maintained ties with  
women’s collectives and  
Feminist activities in Arkan-  
sas, New Mexico, Oregon and  
Washington. Contact: Ann,  
Colleen, Debbie, Leslie or  
Tina.

Men’s Consciousness Raising  
Group

Formed by several gay and  
straight men, we consider this  
group to be an important  
adjunct to the Feminist  
movement in Tucson. These  
are men who are committed to  
raising their own conscious-  
ness and breaking down  
sex-role stereotypes. We love  
them dearly and collaborate  
with them frequently. “Alter-  
natives for Women” is cur-  
rently exploring ways to work  
together, such as in providing  
some mixed women/men  
workshops for those who  
want to work on inter-sex  
relationships. Contact Jack  
Lathan 623-0994 or Perk Clark  
623-1072.

This pretty much exhausts  
my supply of information (and  
me). I'll probably learn what I  
left out when I get home. I  
hope this letter doesn’t come  
on like an underground  
Chamber of Commerce report.  
If it does, it's because I really  
love the place and most of the  
people.

Please feel free to contact  
any of the places or people I  
have mentioned--by phone,  
letter, or in person. We'd love  
to meet you!

We hope to see many of you  
at the Summer Solstice in  
New Mexico this June. In case  
you don’t know about this BIG  
EVENT, it’s a gathering of  

women from all over the west.

There will be booths, arts and  
crafts, displays, workshops,  
and all manner of goings on.  
All the Feminist businesses in  
Tucson will be closing down  
and forming a large caravan.  
See you there.

Sisterhood is not only  
powerful--it’s fun.
