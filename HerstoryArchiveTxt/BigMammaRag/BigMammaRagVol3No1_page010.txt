WOMAN ALIVE!:
Women Recorded

Elissa Meyer

WOMAN ALIVE! above all
else celebrates the diversity of
women. The program does not
pass judgment, nor offer an
evaluation of lifestyles or
struggles. Each segment offers
insight into the unique
circumstances of each woman's
life. The camera probes into the
interpersonal difficulties of Pat
and Charles Sackrey who are
“working hard on being together.”
And it records the concerns of
Iowan women encountering
disrespect and discrimination
on their jobs. The stereotype of
“women’s movement as white
middle class” is beautifully
denounced as black women of
the National Black Feminist
Organization discuss the
peculiarities of their dual
oppression, and finally as
Crystal Lee’s story of union
organizing unfolds for us.
Crystal Lee Jordan of Roanoke
Rapids, North Carolina does not
talk with her husband in the
same way that Pat Sackrey talks
with Charles. She goes each day
to picket lines and union rallies,
whereas Pat works long hours
at the Everywoman’s Center in
Massachusetts.

And like the women’s
movement itself, the program
sets off a melody singing
inside you; the refrain echoes
in your mind and you want to
hear more. I felt like I wanted
to put every woman in front of
a camera to tell her story, to
elaborate on her struggles.
Because I share the profound
belief that in respecting, and
indeed celebrating, the uniqueness
and strength of a woman’s
character, regardless of her
particular situation, women will
break the bondage of stereotype,
self-denigration and roles for
good. As Milissa Manchester
sings at the end of the
program, “Oh heaven how
you’ve changed for me now...
the miracle is in my soul....”

collaboration with Ms. magazine.

Comment

It was remarkably appropriate to have Maya Angelou follow WOMAN ALIVE! Maya says of the subject “I, a woman; I, a black; I, a human.” It is society which attaches labels and stereotypes to these facts because then society need not deal with the human element in all of us. She goes on to comment on the validity of struggles for liberation. Even though she differentiates between white women’s issues and black women’s issues she conveys a respect, more than that, a necessity, for each group to deal with its own oppression. Similarly, as to race relations, Ms. Angelou regards Watergate as the most important matter for white folks because it affords us the opportunity to confront our own morality and integrity, to clean up our own backyard.

One of her most moving statements was in answer to the question, “What would you try to teach a daughter, if you had one?” Maya answered that she would teach her to laugh...a lot; and to be serious. And she would tell the child that, “You might encounter many defeats, but you are never defeated.” Love life!

Maya Angelou, herself a tribute to life, courage and joy, left all of us, as viewers, with a similar message. We need not cross the boundaries of color, nationality, sex; we need not become each other. As Americans we will enrich ourselves so much more by accepting, and enjoying our differences, and not trying to change others. She says of America, “What's so great about being a melting pot? Look at the good it's produced.”

It was broadcast June 19 at 8:00 p.m. on Channel 6.
