voices from our lives

Circling The Star/ Pentagon Action

by Kady daughter of Ann  
(formerly Kay van Deurs)

I was one of 34 women sent in  
chains to the federal women's prison  
at Alderson, West Virginia--after the  
Women's Pentagon Action on November  
17th. 29 of us served 10 days. The  
other 5 (who had been arrested at  
the Pentagon in April) were sentenced  
to 30 days. The other 500 women  
there were serving months and years--  
3 to 12 years, 15 years to life, 30  
years to life. I talked with  
listened to--as many as I could.

I got sick while I was there--  
coughing, fever, chills--and I am  
still having chills. I am a bit  
strange in my mind. I can't seem to  
“cheer up." We got out, but the  
other 500 women we met there are  
still in that prison. Pam Osgood,  
who got 30 days, wrote to me when  
she got out: "I was very sad to  
leave, sad to leave my newfound  
friends before I got to know them  
better, sad to be leaving without  
them."

I was there because the criminally  
insane men who run the government,  
the Pentagon, the prisons, the world  
have already destroyed much of our  
earth, water, air and are about to  
kill all life on the planet. We  
have to stop them. I don't know how.  
Of course, making a circle around  
a star is not enough. I think we  
might have to do a planetary birth  
strike. It's cheap. It's fast.

It's very powerful. Monique Wittig  
wrote, "...those wild birds who  
refuse to hatch their eggs when they  
have been imprisoned. The women, she  
says, take an example from the wild birds  
who, even if they mate with the  
males to relieve their boredom, re-  
fuse to reproduce so long as they are  
not at liberty." If we are lucky,  
it is non-violent. If we are raped,  
we will abort. I am 53; they can't  
impregnate me anymore. I think  
that's why men hate old women. We  
grow wild.

Women said, the Pentagon is shaped  
like a five pointed star--a strong  
dangerous shape. Women said, a  
circle is stronger. We were making  
a circle around the star. I hadn't  
meant to get involved. The night  

before it happened I was listening  
to the radio in upstate New York.  
WBAT said that 2,000 women had  
gathered at the Pentagon that day--  

on the planet have been unpaid ser-  
vants for 5,000 years--I have not  
worked in coalitions with slave  
holders--men. So I haven't seen  
most straight pacifist women for a  
long time. Grace Paley looked at  
me and said, "Robert will be glad  

to hear that you were here." I saw  
Blue Lunden of DONT--Dykes Opposed  
to Nuclear Technology. She was on  
her way to block an entrance--to  
close the Pentagon. I have always  
wanted to spend a night in jail  
listening to Blue Lunden talk. Once  
in a Lesbian bar, she told me that  
education gets us ready for oppres-  
sion. So I handed my address book  
to Pagan and went to help block  

the doors of the Pentagon.

The doors and stairs were filled  
with black men wearing blue uniforms.  
I couldn't get to a door to block  
it, so I began to crawl between the  
legs of the men and they picked me  
up and carried me inside. 140  
women were arrested for blocking  
the doors. As soon as we were arres-  
ted, our hands were tied with color  
coded plastic tape. I did not get  
my hands back for 24 hours. I hated  
having my hands tied all day, all  
night.

We were taken to a cellar of the  
Pentagon. There we sat on a bench  
for hours, were photographed and  
fingerprinted. Then we were taken  
to a court in Alexandria where we  
were "tried," photographed, finger-  
printed, and stuffed into cages.  
More than 20 of us were stuffed into  
a cell about 8 by 9 feet. It was so  
crowded we could not sit down. I  
stood most of the day, most of the  
night. When I was let out, I fell  
on the floor and slept. (I experienced  
this same grave stuffing torture  
in a New York City jail, years ago.  
They must teach it in Crowd Control  
101. Are there ways we could sit and  
lie and hold each other to avoid  
total exhaustion?). Then they emptied  
our pockets--took everything--and  
shackled our hands and feet. They  
put tight metal handcuffs on my  
wrists. A chain ran through the  
handcuffs and around my waist.

There was another chain between my  
feet. I said, "You have got to be  
kidding!" Some women cried. Blue  
Lunden laughed. They locked us in a  
bus, held us there for hours, then  
drove us 7 hours to West Virginia.  
No food. No food all day and all  

Sunday. They needed 1200 women to  
circle the Pentagon the next day--  
Monday. I thought, "Monday! Most  
women have to go to work on Monday.  
They might not have enough." So  
Pagan and Abbe and I drove all night  
to help make the circle around  
the star.

We reached Washington at 5:30 in  
the morning, slept a couple of hours,  
took a subway to the Pentagon. I  
walked all around to see who was  
there. I saw Lesbians from farms,  
cities, towns all over the east  
coast. There was a strong Lesbian  
presence. During the 10 years of  
the anti-war movement, we Lesbians  
had to wear dresses to demonstrations  
so we wouldn't spoil the image  
of the peace movement. Now we are  
wearing our own clothes, being our  
selves. During the last 10 years--  
since I discovered that most women

night. On the bus, male and female  
guards ate and drank in front of us  
and gave us nothing. In West Virgin-  
ia, 24 hours after our arrest, I said  
in a loud voice, "If you don't give  
us something to eat I am going to  
fall on the floor and go into con-  
vulsions." We got something to eat.  
For the third time, we were photo-  
graphed and fingerprinted. We were  
also strip searched. That was the  
first day of my 10 day sentence.  
The thing that hit me hardest was  
that almost all the other prisoners  
were black. Obviously, white women  
were not punished as constantly as  
black women. We white women are  
more able to buy our way out of  
trouble. I am out because I got 10  
days and black women are still in  
because they got months, years. On  
some other equally true level, I am  
out because I am white and they are  

in because they are black. Almost  
all the prisoners are black.

She told me, "My name is Mrs.  
Mary Harris." She is black. She  
is serving 15 years to life. She  
is 61. She asked me to eat with  
her several times and I felt proud.  
I walked with her from the cafeteria  
to the building where she lives.  
She takes tiny steps very slowly.  
She says there's a clot on her brain  
from the stroke she had when she  
discovered "the man I worked for  
raped my baby boy." He gave the boy  
a jar of coins, took him into a  
men's bathroom, molested him sexual-  
ly. "The doctor said I would never  
walk or talk again, but I did not

rape the women and nothing is done  
about it. The women say that if a  
woman complains, they drug her and  
say she is crazy. Abortions and  
the pill are available. IUDs and  
diaphragms are not. Tranquilizers,  
drugs, behavior modification are  
used.

A prisoner told me that most of  
the women are mothers. She told me  
that she is a mother. I said, "My  
lover is a mother and she was  
married for 25 years and she never  
had an orgasm." A 25 year marriage  
--like a prison term--must drive  
women crazy. I guess you never get  
over a thing like that. The prisoner  
said, "I never had an orgasm."

The men who run the prison call  
everything by lying names. They  
keep saying, “It’s just like a college  
campus.”

They had taken all our  

things from us for five days.

give up." At the prison, a van  
driver threw her into a gutter and  
broke her hip. 4 months ago, the  
prison dentist broke her jaw while  
removing her teeth... Those men—  
those federal government employees--  
broke this old woman's hip and her  
jaw. I asked her about medical  
treatment at the prison. She said,  
"It ain't shit, honey." She said,  

"I’m not going to give up till God  
cuts my breath and if he cuts my  
breath then I’ll still work my fin-  
gers. I ain't going to die until  
my time comes." I hope things will  
be all right for Mrs. Mary Harris.  
And yet, how can they be?

The employees are dressed in blue.  
The ones on top are white males.  
The ones on the bottom are black  
females. They are all employees  
of the federal government and each  
find ways to torture the women--to  
make each day more awful.

Day after day, I kept asking the  
guards to put my name on the sick  
call list. They kept saying, "Yes,  
you are on the list. You will be  
called tomorrow between 8 and 12."  
But I was not on the list. I was  
never called.

The beds are sagging metal cots  
with thin, hard, lumpy mattresses.  
I learned to sleep on the edge, on  
the metal rail. A metal box is  
provided for clothes. No table.  

No chair.

The prison is red brick buildings,  
surrounded by lawns and oak trees,  
surrounded by a fence, surrounded  
by the Appalachian mountains. A  
prisoner said, "I wish you activists  
would do something about those  
hills. They are driving me crazy."

So there I was--a skinny, old,  
sick, white Lesbian feminist in a  
federal prison dormitory called  
"Wild Rose Cottage." The men who  
run the prison call everything by  
lying names. They keep saying,  
"It's just like a college campus."  
They had taken all of our things  
and they kept them from us for 5  
days. I wanted a cigarette. I  
didn't know anybody. Frenchie flipped  
me a whole pack of Marlboros  
though she had never seen me before.  
She looked at me and I guess I  
looked kind of raggedy to her. She  
gave me a good shirt.

We had to be silent and sit on our  
beds during the counts. There were  
lots of counts, day and night. The  
guards counted the prisoners.

Male guards. Female guards.

The women say that male guards

until I came here." (To the  
women's prison.) "It scared me so  
bad. I didn't know what it was."

Different women came up to me and  
we had the same conversation again  
and again.

“Are you a homosexual?"

I said, "I am a Lesbian."

"Are all the women in your group  
Lesbians?"

I said, "I don't know. I met them  
yesterday."

"This is my wife.”

I said, "How do you do?"

"The Bull Daggers meet on Friday  
nights at the Rec. It's a dance."

On Friday I was really sick, but  
I got up out of bed and went to  
the Rec. It's a big auditorium  
with pool table, soda machine, juke  
box. On Friday nights, there is a  
disc jockey. I climbed up on the  
stage and asked her if she could  
turn up the volume because I could  
hardly hear. She said it was bro-  
ken. The black women were all sit-  
ting and leaning on the stage. I  
was sitting on the floor with another  
white woman--Jan Clausen. I had  
never met her before and we fell  
into a conversation about the  
terrible review she got in Big Mama  
Rag. And then I said, "Would you  

like to dance?" The other women  
were beginning to dance.

We went up near the stage where  
we could hear the music. I closed  
my eyes and began to dance. I heard  
loud clapping. I opened my eyes.  
All the other women had stopped dan-  
cing. They were clapping and yelling  
at us: "PROTEST! PROTEST!  
PROTEST!" Jan Clausen said, "This  
is like a scene out of..." “and she  
named something I have never read.

I closed my eyes and went on danc-  
ing. When the music stopped, there  
was loud applause. For us. I  
walked out into the middle of the  
floor yelling, "WHAT'S THE MATTER  
WITH YOU BULL DAGGERS? DON'T YOU  
KNOW HOW TO DANCE? I HEARD THIS WAS  
A DANCE. LET ME SEE YOU MOVE IT!"  
A big black woman appeared in front  
of my nose. She ran her hands over  
my breasts. I ran my hands over her  
breasts. Then I reached out and  
hugged her because I was too sick,  
too tired to dance anymore.

Inez Blair is serving 3 to 12  
years. She'll be 34 this month.  
She has 5 children--17, 15, 12, 10,  
and the little one was 4 months  
when she was arrested. He's 27  

months now. She earns 34¢ an hour  
working in The Garment Factory.  
That's $13.60 for 40 hours. She  
applied for the BEG grant to go to  
college. There are 4 college  
courses at the prison and you have  
to take all 4 to get the grant. She  
got the grant--$81. Tuition is  
$131. She had to pay the $50 dif-  
ference. There are not enough  
books. She had to share a book  
with 3 other women who live in dif-  
ferent buildings. She could not  
get the book to read the assign-  
ments. She did not know what was  
going on. She dropped out. The  
colleges near Alderson classify the  
prisoners as "non-residents." That  
makes the tuition too high for  
prisoners.

Why is the grant only $81? The  
federal government gave me an $800  
grant and a thousand dollar loan  
when I was going to college, and I  
didn't have to pay tuition. That  
meant I could quit my job and go to  
school full time. It meant I could  
buy books. Why does Inez Blair have  
to work full time at 34¢ an hour  
and drop out of school for lack of  
a book? Why are there only 4 coll-  
ege courses available to the pris-  
oner women? Why can't they study  
feminism, ecology, Lesbian Litera-  
ture, healing--anything they want?

The women must work. Wiping  
tables and scrubbing in the dining  
room, a woman earns 17¢ an hour.  
She can work up to pots and pans  
for 23¢ an hour. A grade 3 cook  
makes 23¢ an hour--$35 a month.

The clerk in the chapel gets $15 a  
month. The federal government can  
afford to pay minimum wage. The  
man who drives around to see that  
the work gets done gets $10 an hour.  
The man who writes the menus gets  
30 thousand a year.

The library broke my heart. No-  
thing feminist. Nothing Lesbian.  
Just woman-hating religious tracts  
justifying male supremacy.

Do you know what they do to women

I had breakfast one morning with 2  
women from California. They had  
spent 18 months in Maximum Security  
because they escaped. Maximum  
Security is now closed, but there  
is a bad place called Davis Hall.  
One of our group spent two days in  
a cage there for refusing to tell  
her name. She gave her name and  
got "out" to the place where we  
were. Squeaky, the woman who tried  
to shoot a president, is at Davis  
Hall. One night in a room near  
ours, two women were discovered  
under the same blanket. They were  
sent to Davis. I was supposed to  
mop the 4 flights of stairs from  
the roof to the cellar, twice a  
day, for nothing. I did it once  
in 9 days. On the last night a  
guard rushed into our room and  
said, "If you don't scrub the  
stairs immediately, you will be  
sent to Davis." I wish I had told  
her to drop dead. I mopped the  
stairs. During orientation, staff  

told us that Davis Hall is for our  

protection because the other pris-  
oners are dangerous.

They did not put us all in the  
same room. They scattered us all  
over the prison--wherever there was  
room. I was assigned to a room  
with Pam Osgood and Blue Lunden.

We heard that the warden went to  
Washington and asked the judges not  
to send any more of us to Alderson.

We went to the high school gradu-  
ation at the prison. There were 36  
graduates. One told me that the  
prison gets $500 for each graduate.  
That's 18 thousand dollars. She  
said that the graduates used to get
