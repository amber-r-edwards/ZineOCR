Yes

There is a new question on  
the CETA (Comprehensive Em-  
ployment and Training Act)  
job application form. It asks,  
"Do you now, or have you with-  
in the past five years, pub-  
licly advocated the violent  
overthrow of the federal gov-  
ernment?" In January, Dori  
Blitz, a 36-year-old mother  
of two in Martinsville, Va.,  
applied to re-enter the CETA  
program she had left the pre-  
vious May due to pregnancy.  
Blitz, a public and vocal mem-  
ber of the Communist Workers  
Party, refused to answer this  
question and was denied en-  
trance. With the aid of the  
American Civil Liberties Union  
and the National Emergency  
Civil Liberties Committee,  
she has filed suit challenging  
the law under which she has  
been denied federal job train-  
ing.

Censorship Again

Retired Gen. William G. West-  
moreland, who commanded U.S.  
forces in Vietnam, says the  
next time America goes to war  
the news media will have to  
be gagged. "Without censor-  
ship," he explains, “things  
can get terribly confused in  
the public mind."

Abortion Update

Spanish feminists from Bil-  
bao, Spain scored a victory  
last week in a trial that be-  
gan over 10 years ago. The 10  
women were charged with hav-  
ing undergone illegal abor-  
tions.

An eleventh woman in the  
same test case was convicted  
of performing abortions, sen-  
tenced to 12 years and 10 months,  
and was recommended for a pardon.  
This reversal came after mas-  
sive demonstrations by women  
and men which frequently dis-  
rupted the trial; and also  
as several hundred women sta-  
ted publicly that they had  
abortions and hundreds of  
men declared they had helped  
women attain them.

Battering Tax

The state of Vermont has  
come up with a new way to  
raise money for battered wo-  
men's services. Their new $10  
tax on marriage licenses gen-  
erates about $50,000 a year  
for this service. The theory  
must be, if you can't solve  
it, tax it.

Front Page Farce

In the spirit of free speech  
the publisher of the New-  
Herald Newspapers, which puts  
out newspapers in 5 communi-  
ties in economically depressed  
MI, wrote in a memo to the  
editors, "From now on plant  
closings, business failures,  
and layoffs will not appear  
on the front page of any of  
our newspapers. It will be  
our policy to aggressively  
support, promote, and report  
business organizations within  
our circulation area and/or  
those business organizations  
who support us with their ad-  
vertising." How does that go  
again? Freedom of the press  
belongs to those who own the  
press?

Toxic Suit

A second trial blaming Proc-  
tor and Gamble's Rely tampons  
for toxic shock has opened in  
Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Michael  
Kehm charges that his wife  
Patricia died of toxic shock  
four days after she first us-  
ed Rely tampons.

Two researchers working in-  
dependently of each other have  
done experiments showing just  
why Rely tampons may be dang-  
erous. Both doctors' work pin-  
points carboxymethylcellulose,  
the synthetic absorbent used  
in Rely. The material breaks  
down into a sugar which encou-  
rages the rapid growth of va-  
ginal bacteria, and inhibits  
the action of white blood  
cells, the body's natural de-  
fense against infection. Though  
Proctor and Gamble reject the  
studies, other manufacturers  
have switched back to more  
traditional absorbent materials  
such as cotton and rayon.

Blaming The Victim

One of the conclusions of a  
conference sponsored by the  
Pennsylvania Department of  
Public Health was that the  
rise in the number of desti-  
tute street people is attri-  
buted to the increase in “men-  
tal illness" in the country,  
not as a symptom of a sick  
economy, and recommended that  
the admissions policy at Phil-  
adelphia State Hospital (By-  
berry) be changed "to allow  
the involuntary commitment of  
clearly endangered people."  
The hordes of homeless people  
were blamed on those who have  
campaigned over the last 10  
years to “reform” the mental  
health laws.

Locking The Sty

On April 5 at 10:15 pm the  
Anti-Swine Brigade padlocked  
the front door of Erik's, a  
pornographic night club in  
Washington, D.C. The door  
remained locked for an hour and a half  
until two cop cars arrived  
and the lock was removed.

A dozen men were seen approa-  
ching and leaving when they  
could not get in. The Brigade  
is a collective of feminist  
women and anti-sexist men.

Biting Solution

A woman in Albuquerque, N.M.  
saved herself when she bit  
off the lip of one of her attack-  
ers. Police apprehended the  
would-be rapist at a nearby  
hospital where he had gone to  
seek treatment for the gouge  
in his lower lip. His cronies  
were later picked up too.

Behind Our Backs

On the evening of March 8,  
while 12,000 women in Paris,  
France, celebrated Interna-  
tional Women's Day, the of-  
fice of des femmes hebdo, a  
feminist weekly, was vanda-  
lized, its equipment and com-  
munication facilities des-  
troyed. There has been almost  
total silence by the press  
about this outrage, breaking  
with all traditions of soli-  
darity among the media to in-  
form the people and to com-  
municate.

A New Reason

Coors has brought a $100,000  
suit against boycott organi-  
zers in CA. Named in the suit  
are Northern CA Coors Boycott  
Committee and its coordinator  
Howard Wallace, a gay trade  
union activist, the AFL-CIO  
director of the boycott in Los  
Angeles, David Sickler and  
Solidarity, a gay organization.  
In addition to punitive dama-  
ges, it seeks an injunction  
against the boycott and $150,000  
for its alleged actual losses.  
The boycott in CA has been es-  
pecially successful, knocking  
Coors out as the #1 beer there;  
yet, still, its billion dollar  
beer sales in 1981 made it the  
5th largest brewer in the U.S.
