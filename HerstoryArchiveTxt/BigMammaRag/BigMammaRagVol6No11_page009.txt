Positive Pressings | Changing Images  

Along with her good news reviews  
this month, Andrea Chesman included  
some news that is sad for us at  
BMR. She has taken a job in Penn-  
sylvania with a publishing house;  
and while we wish her the best of  
luck, we are sorry to say that she  
will no longer be writing for us on  
a regular basis. Her column will be  
missed - she has been a valuable  
contributor!

Good news from the feminist press!  

Two feminist publishers decided to  
do something to make information  
about feminist presses more avail-  
able. The result is The Passion-  
ate Perils of Publishing, a charm-  
ing book about everything that is  
wrong with the "literary-industrial  
complex" and everything that is  
right about the independent press,  
with much information and helpful  
hints for publishers; and Mother-  
root Journal, a new publication that  
contains reviews of books published  
by women from the feminist and in-  
dependent press, as well as articles  
and commentary about new authors.  

Valerie Wheat and Celeste West  
are two editors of Booklegger Press  
and the sporadically published  
BookLegger, a magazine about the  
independent press specifically aimed  
at librarians. In the Passionate  
Perils of Publishing (PPP), West  

and Wheat present both an overview  
of publishing and a tremendous  
amount of specific information to  
help feminist publishers get started.  

West attacks the "literary-indu-  
strial complex" in the first chapter  
with facts, figures, and a great deal  
of wit, concluding that "as New York  
publishing is taken over by a core of  
merchandisers who singly push 'units'  
from printer to shredder by the fast-  
est route possible - a need for some-  
thing else is created. It is called  
the small, alternative Independent  
Press. Its seeds really started blow-  
ing in the 60's just as the old houses  
began to fall in the merger swath. It  
is the slice of tomorrow."  

For neophyte (and experienced) pub-  
lishers - as well as writers, West  

(303) 861-1166  

has compiled a very useful list of  
books. The titles range from gen-  
eral how-to publish books, to books  

on design, graphic techniques and  
printing. There is a listing of books  
on the economics of publishing and  
some very helpful books on promotion -  
including a checklist of over thirty  
media and annual directories that ev-  
ery publisher should know about.  

All of the listings are annotated  
with pithy observations, pointing the  
strengths and weaknesses of each book.  
Ordering information is included for  
those books produced by hard-to-get-  
at independent publishers.  

Following the same format, Wheat has  
compiled a listing of independent  
press distributors, directories, in-  
dexes and review media. In a sep-  
arate chapter on "Feminists in Print,"  
there is more information on distri-  
butors, publishers, guides, direc-  
tories and indexes. Finally, Wheat  
provides listings for kids' presses and  
the library "free press."  

The diligence required to compile  
this guide is obvious, as obvious as  
the need for it. In this slim volume  
is as much information on publishing  
as most publishers would need to know.  

Motherroot Journal is a new review of  
small and feminist press books. In  
its premier issue this fall, there  
were in-depth book reviews, insightful  
commentary on women writers, and mis-  
cellaneous articles of interest to  
writers, including announcements of  
writing contests and awards.  

There is a lovely balance in Mother-  
root's first issue. Periodicals are  
reviewed as well as poetry books.  
There are reviews of history, biogra-  
phy, science fiction and short stories.  
Each review-essay is written in depth.  
The writing is interesting and clear,  

and there is evidence of considerable  

scholarship and time spent in each  
article.  

Motherroot Journal is interested  
in women's literature and culture.  
They are seeking reviews of film,  
theater, and personal and theoretical  
articles, as well as book reviews.  
The journal does restrict its re-  
views to books by women or about  
women. Some male-run presses may be  
included within this criteria, but  
only if they have a good reputation  
concerning women's issues.  

The Motherroot collective is also  
responsible for Motherroot Public-  
ations, a new press dedicated to ser-  
ious work by women, reflecting a wo-  
men's culture, and combining art  
and politics. Their other public-  
ations include Women and Honor: Some  
Notes on Lying by Adrienne Rich and  
Notes of a Daughter from the Old  
Country by Melanie Perish.

Children’s Books  

Fran Day  

In selecting the children's books  
at Woman to Woman Bookcenter, we  
have paid particular attention to  
the kind of self-image the books were  
likely to foster in girls. We have  
looked at what each book said, im-  
plicitly or explicitly, about being  
female. Our books show girls and  
women as active, interested and in-  
teresting people involved in ex-  
citing adventures and work. Our  
books tell the stories of females  
with positive personality character-  
istics - independence, intelligence,  
warmth, strength, bravery, compe-  
tence. This view is extremely im-  
portant in a culture where there is  
a tendency to describe females in  
one of two ways: as crafty, mani-  
pulating, vindictive persons or as  
naive, well-meaning but ineffectual  
beings. The books children read  
can begin to change such stereotypes.  

We invite you to stop in and look  
at the children's books at Woman to  
Woman. We encourage you to give at  
least one book to each child on your  
holiday list this year; we urge you  
to be sure that those books are non-  
sexist! Comments and suggestions  
are welcome - please direct these to  
Fran at the Bookcenter.

We will review several of our  
children's books in this column each  
month to give our readers some ideas  
about what non-sexist books are  
available.  

Island of the Blue Dolphins  
S. O'Dell  

Dell Publishing Company, 1960  
$1.25/paper, for ages 8-14  

This is a remarkable story of  
Karana, a young Indian woman who  
lived alone for eighteen years on  
an island off the coast of Calif-  
ornia. At first she looked for-  
ward to being rescued but gradually  
began to enjoy her new life. She  
spent her time making weapons, find-  
ing food and building shelters. She  
made friends with the birds, otters,  
foxes and wild dogs. This story is  
beautiful, revealing strength,  
courage, serenity and greatness of  
spirit. This book won the Newbery  
Award for the most distinguished  
contribution to American Literature  
for children in 1961.  

A Train for Jane  
Norma Klein  
illustrated by Miriam Schottland  
Feminist Press, 1974  
$3.50/paper, for ages 4-10  

Norma Klein started writing  
stories for children when she dis-  
covered how difficult it was to  
find books that portray young people  
the way they really are. The main  
character in all her books are live-  
ly, daring and mischievous girls.  
Exuberant Jane wants a train  
for Christmas. Her relatives re-  
peatedly try to persuade her to get  
a doll but Jane remains persistent.  
Children will especially enjoy the  
rhyming verse and lively illustra-  
tions.  

Feminist Writers Organize  

regionally focused (the San Francisco  
Bay Area group held a writer's re-  

Andrea Chesman  

The Feminist Writers Guild, a  
national organization for women  
writers, begins its second year of  
existence with a constitution  
which will be ratified or rejected  
by its 1000 plus members in January.  

Organized as a political body and  
a service organization, the Femin-  
ist Writers Guild (FWG) operates  
on both a national and a local level.  
At the national level, the FWG is  
dedicated to pressuring national  
publications to review books by fem-  
inist presses, to publicly protest  
the discrimination against women in  
the distribution of grant money,  
and to provide members with publish-  
ing information in such areas as  
contracts, royalties, and agents.  
There are also plans for the FWG to  
develop into the role of mediator  
for feminist publishers and writers  
who are in disagreement.  

Locally, the FWG encourages the  
development of grassroots writing  

communities for women. The local  
chapters are dedicated to building  

a strong network of communication  
among women writers, providing mu-  
tual support for individual writers.  
The local chapters, which are con-  
centrated on the two coasts, reflect  
the wide variety of interests with-  
in the guild. While some are at-  
tacking national problems (the New  
York City chapter is planning a speak-  
out against the bias against fem-  
inist writings that seems to be po-  
licy in many major review publica-  
tions), other chapters are more  

focused on local issues (the Sierra  
foothills). Most of the local chapters  
hold workshops and give readings. There  
are guild chapters, or at least contact  
people in 23 states so far.  

Any woman who takes her writing  
seriously is eligible for member-  
ship in the Feminist Writers Guild.  
Although individual members are  
encouraged to start their own local  
chapter, a writer can be an unaffil-  
iated member of the national organ-  
ization. Dues for membership are  
$10.00/year or $5.00 for the unem-  
ployed. The ratified constitution  
will determine what percentage of the  
dues will go to the local chapters.  
Members of the Guild receive all  
of the regular publications of the  
national organization. To date, this  
includes a tri-annual newsletter  
which includes information on fem-  
inist publications, presses, and  
chapter news.  

A Feminist Writers' Guild Anthology  
of women writers "Real Life Adven-  
ture Stories and their hard-won  
how-to information" is currently in  
process. Editor Celeste West pre-  
dicts that the book will be in a  
publisher's hand by the end of the  
year.  

The Feminist Writers' Guild can be  
contacted at P.O. Box 9396, Berkeley,  
California, 94709. Sandia is in-  
terested in organizing a local chap-  
ter. Interested writers should con-  
tact her at 1252 Elizabeth Street,  
Denver, Colorado, 80206, or call  
322-8438.
