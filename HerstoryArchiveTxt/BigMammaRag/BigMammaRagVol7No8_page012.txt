Energy for Change

Defining

The following was presented by  
Audre Lorde last November at a ses-  
sion on Feminist Perspectives on  
Pornography at the San Francisco  
conference sponsored by Women Ag-  
ainst Violence in Pornography and  
Media. The author has full copy-

Audre Lorde

There are many kinds of power,  
used and unused, acknowledged or  
otherwise. The erotic is a resource  
within each of us that lies in a  
deeply female and spiritual plane,  
firmly rooted in the power of our  
unexpressed or unrecognized feeling.  
In order to perpetuate itself, every  
oppression must corrupt or distort  
those various sources of power  
within the culture of the oppressed  
that can provide energy for change.  
For women, this has meant a suppres-  
sion of the erotic as a considered  
source of power and information  
within our lives.

We have been taught to suspect  
this resource, vilified, abused,  
and devalued within western society.  
On one hand the superficially erotic  
has been encouraged as a sign of  
female inferiority - on the other  
hand women have been made to suffer  
and to feel both contemptible and  
suspect by virtue of its existence.

It is a short step from there to  
the false belief that only by the  
suppression of the erotic within  
our lives and consciousness can wo-  
men be truly strong. But that stren-  
gth is illusory, for it is fashioned  
within the context of male models  
of power.

Non-Rational Knowledge

As women, we have come to distrust  
that power because of our  
deepest and non-rational knowledge.  
We have been warned against it all  
our lives by the male world, which  
values this depth of feeling enough  
to keep women around in order to  
exercise it in the service of men,  
but which fears this same depth too  
much to examine the possibilities  
of it within themselves. So women  
are maintained at a distant/inferior  
position to be psychically milked,  
much the same way ants maintain  
colonies of aphids to provide a  
life-giving substance for their  
masters.

But the erotic offers a well of  
replenishing and provocative force  
to the woman who does not fear its  
revelation, nor succumb to the be-  
lief that sensation is enough.

The erotic has often been misnamed  
by men and used against women. It  
has been made into the confused,  
the trivial, the psychotic, the  
plasticized sensation. For this  
reason, we have often turned away  
from the exploration and considera-  
tion of the erotic as a source of  
power and information, confusing it  
with its opposite, the pornograph-  
ic. But pornography is a direct  
denial of the power of the erotic,  
for it represents the suppression of  
true feeling. Pornography emphasizes  
sensation without feeling.

The erotic is a measure between  
the beginnings of our sense of  
self, and the chaos of our strongest  
feelings. It is an internal sense  
of satisfaction to which, once we  
have experienced it, we know we can  
aspire. For once having experienced  
the fullness of this depth of feeling  
and recognizing its power, in honor  
and self-respect we can require no  
less of ourselves.

Go Beyond

It is never easy to demand the most  
from ourselves, and from our lives,  
and from our work. To go beyond the  
encouraged mediocrity of our soc-  
iety is to encourage excellence.

But giving in to the fear of feeling  
and working to capacity is a  
luxury only the unintentional can  
afford, and the unintentional are  
those who do not wish to guide their  
own destinies.

This internal requirement toward  
excellence which we learn from the  
erotic must not be misconstrued as  
demanding the impossible from our-  
selves nor from others. Such a  
demand incapacitates everyone in the  
process, for the erotic is not a  
question only of what we do. It is  
a question of how acutely and fully  
we can feel in the doing. For once  
we know the extent to which we are  
capable of feeling that sense of  
satisfaction and fullness and com-  
pletion, we can then observe  
which of our various life endeavors  
bring us closest to that fullness.

The aim of each thing which we do  
is to make our lives and the lives  
of our children more possible and  
more rich. Within the celebration of  
the erotic in all our endeavors, my  
work becomes a conscious decision -  
a longed-for bed which I enter grate-  
fully and rise up empowered.

Of course, women so empowered are  
dangerous. So we are taught to sep-  
arate the erotic demand from most  
vital areas of our lives other than  
sex. And the lack of concern for  

the erotic root and satisfactions of  
our work is felt in our disaffection  
from so much of what we do. For ins-  
tance, how often do we truly love  
our work?

The principal horror of any sys-  
tem which defines the good in terms  
of profit rather than human need to  
the exclusion of the psychic and  
emotional components of that need -  
the principal horror of such a sys-  
tem reduces work to a travesty of  
necessities, a duty by which we earn  
bread or oblivion for ourselves and  
those we love. But this is tanta-  
mount to blinding a painter and then  
telling her to improve her work,  
and to enjoy the act of painting. It  
is not only next to impossible, it is  
also profoundly cruel.

Quality of Life

As women we need to examine the  
ways in which our world can be tru-  
ly different. I am speaking here of  
the necessity for reassessing the  
very quality of all the aspects of  
our lives and our work.

The very word ‘erotic’ comes from  
the Greek word eros, the personifi-  
cation of love in all its aspects -  
born of Chaos, and personifying cre-  
ative power and harmony. When I  
speak of the erotic, then, I speak  
of it as an assertion of the life-  
force of women; of that creative en-  
ergy empowered, the knowledge and  
use of which we are now reclaiming  
in our language, our history, our  
dancing, our loving, our work, and  
our lives.

There are frequent attempts to e-  
quate pornography and eroticism, two  
diametrically opposed uses of the  
sexual. Because of these attempts,  
it has become fashionable to separ-  
ate the spiritual (psychic and emo-  
tional) away from the political, to  
see them as contradictory or anti-  
thetical. "What do you mean, a poe-  

tic revolutionary, a meditating gun-  

runner?" In the same way, we have  
attempted to separate the spiritual  
and the erotic, reducing the spir-  
itual thereby to a world of flatten-  
ed affect - a world of the ascetic  
who aspires to feel nothing. But  
nothing is farther from the truth.  
For the ascetic position is one of  
the highest fear, the gravest immo-  
bility. The severe abstinence of the  
ascetic becomes the ruling obsession.

And it is one, not of self-discipline,  
but of self-abnegation.

The dichotomy between the spirit-  
ual and the political is also false,  
resulting from an incomplete atten-  
tion to our erotic knowledge. For  
the bridge which connects them is  
formed by the erotic - the sensual -  
those physical, emotional and psy-  
chic expressions of what is deepest  
and strongest and richest within us,  
being shared: the passions of love,  
in its deepest meanings.

The considered phrase, "It feels  
right to me," acknowledges the stren-  
gth of the erotic into a true know-  
ledge, for what it means and feels is  
that the first, and most powerful gui-  
ding light towards any understanding.  
Any understanding is a handmaiden  
which can only wait upon, or clarify,  
that knowledge, deeply born. The  

Our Own - the Erotic as Power

erotic is the nurturer or nursemaid  
of all our deepest knowledge.

The erotic functions for me in se-  
veral ways, and the first is in the  
power which comes of sharing deeply  
any pursuit with another person.

The sharing of joy, whether physic-  
al, emotional, psychic or intellect-  
ual, forms a bridge between the  
sharers which can be the basis for  
understanding much of what is not  
shared between them, and lessens  
the threat of that difference.

Another important way in which the  
erotic functions is the open and  
fearless underlining of my capacity  
for joy. In the way my body stretches  
to music and opens in response, hear-  
kening to its deepest rhythms, so  
every level upon which I sense also  
comes to the erotically satisfying  
experience, whether it is dancing,  
building a bookcase, writing a poem,  
examining an idea.

That self-connection shared is a  
measure of the joy which I know  
myself to be capable of feeling,  
a reminder of my capacity for feel-  
ing. And that deep and irreplaceable  
knowledge of my capacity for joy  
comes to demand from all of my life  
that it be lived with the knowledge  
that such satisfaction is possible,  
and does not have to be called mar-  
riage, nor god, nor an afterlife.

Relative Meaning

This is one reason why the erotic  
is so feared, and so often relegat-  
ed to the bedroom alone, when it  
is recognized at all. For once we  
begin to feel deeply in all the as-  
pects of our lives, we begin to  
demand from ourselves and from our  
lives' pursuits that they feel in  
accordance with the joy which we  
know ourselves to be capable of.

Our erotic knowledge empowers us,  
becomes a lens through which we scru-  
tinize all the aspects of our ex-  
istence, forcing ourselves to eval-  
uate those aspects honestly in terms  
of their relative meaning within  
each of us, not to settle for the  
convenient, the shoddy, the conven-  
tionally expected, nor the merely  
safe.

During World War II, we bought  
sealed plastic packets of white,  
uncolored margarine, with a tiny,  
intense pellet of yellow coloring  
perched like a topaz just inside the  
clear skin of the bag. We would leave  
the margarine out for a while to  
soften, and then we would pinch the  
little pellet to break it inside  
the bag, releasing the rich yellow-  
ness into the soft pale mass of  
margarine. Then taking it carefully  
between our fingers, we would knead  
it gently back and forth, over and  
over, until the color had spread  
throughout the whole pound bag of  
margarine, leaving it thoroughly  
colored.

I find the erotic such a kernel  
within myself. When released from  
its intense and constrained pellet,  
it flows through and colors my life  
with a kind of energy that heightens  
and sensitizes and strengthens all  
my experience.
