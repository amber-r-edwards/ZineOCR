The gene is discovered.

It is said that the progeny does not
inherit the habit of the parent.

(That the gene is isolated and impene-
trable by either will or design,

That the mutations which create new
species are spontaneous and cannot be
calculated, is admitted.)

Still, it is hoped that the theory
of mutation may make it possible to
discover the exact moment when men
became immortal.

"LIFE IS LARGELY:

And it is written that in the inferior world of
brutes and vegetables man was created to act as
the viceroy of the great God of heaven and earth,
and that he should then name the brutes and the
vegetables. For theirs is the power in words, it
is said, and it is put forward that by knowing the
names of natural things, man can control them,
that he who calls the creatures by their true
names has power over them.

(Thus it is decided that earth shall be called
land; trees, timber; animals to be called hunted,
to be called domesticated; her body to be named
hair, to be named skin, to be called breast, vulva,
clitoris, to be named womb.

MARIE CURIE, last =

Marie Curie, 1867-1934

In this mass of substances
she searches for the elementary, for what cannot be redu-
ced, Sifting through the residue of pitchblende, she re-
moves pine cones and rocks. Over days and weeks, over
years, she grinds this material, she dissolves it, she
filters it, precipitates it, collects it again, dissolves
it again, precipitates it again, crystalizes and recrys-
talizes. Thousands of gallons become teaspoonfuls.

Finally, she can call this
material pure. Yet, it does
not stay still. It gives off
heat. Its emanations fill the
air. It glows. Its rays pass
through paper, glass, rubber,
cloth, skin. A piece of metal
placed near the radium but
not touching it becomes rad-
ioactive. The pure radium
burns itself away.

Now this substance has en-
tered her hands. Her skin is
burned. There are open sores.
The lenses of her eyes become
opaque. She cannot see. She
is exhausted. She collapses.
She burns with fever.

Yet she will not allow
these symptoms to be spoken
of, and despite the com-
plaints of her body, returns
again and again to work on
this material.

But what the scientist
touches she becomes. At her
death, she declares, "I can't
express myself properly." She
says, "My head is turning.”
She tries to turn a spoon in
a glass as though it were a
rod in a beaker. She asks,
“Has it been made with ra-
dium or mesothorium?” Its
temperature becomes her tem-
perature. She shakes with its
coldness. "Thirty-eight de-
grees! I don't know if it’s
right. I'm trembling so.”

Its properties become her
own; her body the experiment.
"I'd like to set myself
straight, my head's turning."
At the end, she speaks for
herself. "What are you going
to do to me,” she says, "I
don't want it," and demands,
"I want to be left in peace."
