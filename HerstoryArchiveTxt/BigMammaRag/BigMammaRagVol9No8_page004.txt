Indian Center Loses Lease/Faces Budget Cutbacks

Liz Lewis

The Denver Indian Center
(Denver Native Americans Un-
ited, Inc.) has for the past
ten years been located at
1580 Gaylord St. This May,
the Center was notified that
the building had been sold,
and their month-by-month
lease would not continue past
August 1. That moving dead-
line has been pushed up to
Sept. 1 by Chuck Boes, the
new owner of the building,
who intends to restore its
auditorium and create rent-
al office space as a money-
making venture. Since May,
the Center has been search-
ing for a new space, one
large enough to accommodate
its many and varied service
programs.

Services that have been
provided by the Center in-
clude a day care center which
operates on a sliding scale
and accepts 50 children, and
an adult education program
that offers classes that help
adults prepare for high
school equivalency tests,

and also offers “life skills"
classes and individual coun-
seling for Indians making the
transition from reservation
living to city living. Other
services include a hot lunch
program for senior citizens,
and job placement and train-
ing.

The Indian Center is 90%
funded by the federal gov-
ernment, and since Reagan
has been in office, it has
been the target of many bud-
get cutbacks (as have all
Native American programs).
And, Center employees find
that it is even more diffi-
cult to be effective in meet-
ing Indian community needs,
because the diminishing gov-
ernment money comes through
in sums that are designated
for specific programs, allow-
ing little chance for them
to determine their own pri-
orities on spending the money.
None of the programs are se-
cure. For instance, while

To Serve And Protect?

One of the fears generated
and supported by sexual, ra-
cial and economic exploitation
is the fear of crime. There is
a constant threat to body and
property that adds a sharper
edge to the fears of one indi-
vidual of another, of one race
from another, of one sex from
another. In the United States
this has led to a “love of
guns" and a legal arming of
both sides, i.e., the “criminal"
and the police. This clouds
our ability to see the police
and the “criminal” in their
real roles.

The police are one of the
front lines of repression used
to justify the power of the
state...to control the working
class. Their actions range from
strikebreaking to repressing
working class culture and re-
creational activities. This
all sounds pretty rhetorical
until you look at some of the
actions that have been engaged
in by our city police here in

the big care program is
secure for two more years,

the hot lunch program funding
runs out in September.

In considering options for
how to continue operation of
the Indian Center, there is
an agreement among staff that
finding a large building that
can house all the Center's
projects together is a nec-
essity. The idea of splinter-
ing off into different ser-
vice units in different lo-
cations is very undesirable
because the different pro-
grams are very much intercon-
nected, and can function most
effectively within a central
structure. And, for reserv-
ation Indians, this is a more
familiar structure.

At a time when government
cutbacks have severely affect-
ed reservation life, there is
a continued influx of Native
Americans to the cities. But
then, says Terry Bad Hand,
director of the Adult Ed. pro-

Denver and then backed by our
local government in the form
of our mayor, Mr. McNichols.
Coming out of a long history
of abuse by the police in both

Denver's Chicano and Black Com-
munities, community reaction
was again heightened by the
June 28th teargassing by po-
lice of about 800 children and
adults gathered in La Raza Park
for a festival. The police at-
tack of a peaceful gathering
of predominantly Chicanos is
racism in action.

On July 7th a young black
teenager died in a struggle
with two policemen who were
trying to arrest him at his
home. Community members remain
unsatisfied over police expla-
nations of the death although
the case is “under investiga-
tion” by the D.A. However, no
disciplinary action by the po-
lice is contemplated.

A Commerce City woman is now
suing the City and County of
Denver and the two officers
involved in her case with ne-
gligence and outrageous con-
duct. After running out of gas
late one night, Linda Whitcomb
called 911, the police, for
assistance. The police arrived
but said they couldn't help
her as they didn't have a gas
can. Abandoned by the police,
Linda barely escaped murder
and rape in trying to get home
that night. She did suffer a
severe beating that has left
her with some permanent pro-
blems. Linda stated, "Most vio-
lent crimes are against women
and most of them take place at
night. The police should be
sensitive to that." Since fil-
ing her suit, Linda Whitcomb
has been harassed and threat-
ened by the police, and was
receiving hate mail. Her suit
is still in process.

The problem is that the po-
lice are only sensitive toward
the rights of the ruling class
es. To quote from a press re-
lease from the Paul Robeson
Club here in Denver, "We
must begin the process of go-
ing beyond such temporary so-
lutions (i.e., legal remedies)
and develop strategies that
would prevent such attacks
from occurring in the future."

As feminists, we must show
support for the Women's
Building in San Francisco which
refused meeting space to women
affiliated with the police.
The Feminist Movement must not
allow itself to be talked into
supporting our own oppression
by supporting the push for
women to join the police or
armed services.
