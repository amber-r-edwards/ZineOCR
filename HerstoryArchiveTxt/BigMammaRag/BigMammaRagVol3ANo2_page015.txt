Unclean, Unclean!  

The Right Rev. John M. Allin,  
Episcopal presiding bishop of  
Newark, has recently refused to  
accept money intended for  
feeding starving children  
because it was collected at an  
unauthorized service conducted  
by three women priests.  

Less Nosy  

The Federal Home Loan Bank  
Board has issued regulations,  
effective immediately,  
specifically prohibiting federally  
chartered savings and loans  
associations from dis-  
criminating against women in  
making home loans. The board  
now “disapproves” the practice  
of requiring information relating  
to birth control practices of  
married applicants. The new  
regulations prohibit lenders  
from requiring a single woman  
to obtain a cosigner for a home  
loan if it doesn’t require single  
men in the same income and  
credit situation to do so. Com-  
plaints of violations should go to  
the Bank Board (264-1447), or  
the Dept. Housing and Urban  
Development (264-1290). (New  
York)  

Sue HEW  

Five national citizen action  
groups filed suit recently in U.S.  
District Court, Washington, D.C.,  
charging that HEW and the Dept.  
of Labor have violated the anti-  
sex bias laws by releasing  
millions of dollars in federal  
funds to schools engaging in  
sex-discrimination. The plain-  
tiffs are Women’s Equity Action  
League, NOW, National  
Educational Assn., Federation of  
Professional Women, and  
American Women in Science.

compiled by Black Women’s Log

be included on the list should  
send name, contact person and

Black Women  
for Progress  

The Black Women for  
Progress is an organization  
designed by and for Black  
women. It includes all economic,  
social, political and cultural  
backgrounds — with the intent  
to respond to the needs of Black  
women on both the local and  
national level. “Recognizing that  
we live in a biased and sexist  
society, we feel the  
need to develop an organization  
which creates a humanistic  
vehicle for addressing ourselves  
to both of these conditions.” In-  
terested persons should write to  
Black Women for Progress, c/o  
Black Women’s Log.

National Defense Fund  

The Lesbian Mother's  
National Defense Fund is work-  
ing on a list of lawyers, law  
students, and paralegals in-  
terested in lesbian mother  
cases. This list is to be sent to  
legal people who have ex-  
pressed interest in contacting  
others involved in lesbian  
mother cases, and to lesbian  
mothers needing representa-  
tion.  

Also in preparation is a packet  
of material to be sent to women  
who may have to go through a  
court battle. It will include: the  
list of attorneys mentioned  
above, a list of possible expert  
witnesses, a section by women  
who have gone through court  
cases about what happens  
emotionally, legally, and in every  
other way, important briefs and  
decisions in pertinent cases, and  
a glossary of legal terms that  
might be encountered. If you  
have any experience that other  
lesbian mothers can profit by,  
the LMNDF would like to hear  
about it.

1975, the day preceding the an-  
nual (MORE) journalism review
