Sit-In For Mobility

A seven-hour sit-in on a  
Manhattan public bus brought  
to light discrimination a-  
gainst the large disabled  
community by the Metropoli-  
tan Transit Authority (MTA)  
and, winning a victory for  
the disabled.

Lift-equipped buses, sport-  
ing the wheelchair access  
symbol, have been on the  
streets for a number of weeks  
and the MTA set Sept. 30 as  
the date these buses would  
be fully operational on cer-  
tain routes for use by mobility  
impaired people. However,  
at the very last minute, the  
MTA “changed its mind."

When the MTA missed the  
deadline, it tried to lay the  
blame on the Transport Work-  
ers Union, which was justi-  
fiably asking for adequate  
training time on the lifts  
before putting them safely  
into use. On Sept. 30, people  
were told that the drivers  
were not yet trained and did  
not have the right keys. The  
next day, after all the media  
coverage on the sit-ins,  
trained drivers with keys mi-  
raculously appeared. The pro-  
testers say the subways may  
be their next target.

Africanization

Zimbabwe, Africa's newest  
independent state, is quiet-  
ly making progress in "Afri-  
canizing" its civil service,  
as well as in changing the  
attitudes of its white civil  
servants.

During white minority rule,  
all senior posts in the civil  
service were occupied by  
whites. The civil service is  
now 58% African.

Identity Cards

From now on, the Agricultural  
Dept. will require the  
person who picks up food  
stamps to carry a photo I.D.

The Dept. is also refusing  
to replace stolen food stamp  
coupons. In addition, if cou-  
pons are lost in the mail,  
the department will issue  
only two replacements in 6  
months.

This policy insults the  
poor by branding them as  
potential criminals. Does  
Reagan really think that the  
poor are eating too well?

Self Defense

A Chicago teenager who shot  
herself in the abdomen to  
terminate a six-month preg-  
nancy has been indicted under  
a state abortion law and  
could face 14 years in prison  
if convicted. The case may be  
the first in which the state  
law has been used to indict  
anyone on abortion charges.  
The woman resorted to this  
action because it was too  
late in her pregnancy to get  
a legal abortion.

Lord Forgive Us!

Spain has passed legislation  
finally granting the right to  
divorce, although in a restrict-  
ed context. Uncontested suits  
will be granted within two  
years of filing—contested  
divorces may take up to five.

Sheltered Sweatshop

A conference of former  
psychiatric inmates (spon-  
sored by On Our Own, a self-  
help group) has passed a  
motion calling for the pay-  
ment of minimum wage to em-  
ployees of sheltered work-  
shops.

The workshops, intended to  
provide a therapeutic work  
environment for ex-inmates,  
pay employees as little as  
30¢ an hour for packaging  
goods and other menial tasks.

The case of a woman who  
is suing the Salvation Army  
for backpay up to the mini-  
mum wage for the 18 months  
she worked in their shel-  
tered workshop has not yet  
been resolved by the Ontario  
Labor Relations Board, al-  
though a decision is expect-  
ed later this fall.

Porn Action

The Women's Liberation Act-  
ion Brigade destroyed two do-  
zen porn dispensers around  
San Francisco. They jammed  
the coin slots with permanent  
glue and wrote slogans:

WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF DEGRADA-  
TION!

WE WANT WOMEN'S LIBERATION

DEFEAT THE SYSTEM THAT LIVES  
ON EXPLOITATION

OF WOMEN AND THIRD WORLD  
NATIONS

FIGHT U.S. IMPERIALISM!

Pals Forever

The FBI has had 'palsy-  
walsy' relations with racist  
organizations for years.

The latest link revealed  
is that with Ku Klux Klan  
Imperial Wizard Bill Wilkin-  
son, who served as an FBI  
agent for seven years.

As an agent, Wilkinson kept  
the FBI informed of KKK act-  
ivities and apparently car-  
ried out FBI's biddings in  
the KKK. To the best of any-  
one's knowledge, despite re-  
peated lawless acts by the  
KKK, the FBI never moved  
to use its information to  
break up or destroy the ter-  
rorist organization.

The FBI is part of the ra-  
cist and overall anti-demo-  
cratic and anti-labor setup.  
It is notable that the more  
reactionary the Administra-  
tion, the more advantages  
are granted the FBI. The  
Reagan Administration is  
expanding the FBI's opera-  
tions by pushing bills to  
legalize black bag spying  
and similar illegal opera-  
tions.

“Impartiality”?

A 11-year-old Michigan  
girl who was raped by her  
mother's boyfriend is be-  
ing forced to carry the preg-  
nancy to term. The judge who  
made the decision not to al-  
low an abortion for the girl  
came out publicly support-  
ing a Mother's Day anti-ab-  
ortion ad. So much for im-  
partiality—the case went on  
the girl was past the 24-week  
legal abortion limit by the  
time the decision was reached.

Teacher Ties

A judge has ordered the  
Philadelphia teachers to re-  
turn to work by Oct. 12.

The union answered with a  
picket line of more than  
3,000 the day after the  
court order. The picket line  
which was formed by some two  
dozen unions which support  
the teachers' strike, shut  
down one high school. The  
teachers walked out in Sept.  
when the school board viol-  
ated their contract and laid  
off 3,500 school workers  
and stopped a scheduled 10%  
pay increase. Key to a vic-  
tory for the union which is  
70% white, is to actively  
build strong ties with the  
community, which is over-  
whelmingly Black.
