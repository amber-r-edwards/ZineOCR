Anti-Semitism Is Alive & Thriving In

Deb Luger

So it's 1984! The 1984th
year of recognition of Christ
and Christianity. And we
live under that Christian
calendar every day. So it's
1984 where there is a "sev-
eration of church and state"
and in Denver, Colorado USA,

you too can own a house and
a car and have a roof over
your head and food on the
table. Nothing fancy (though
some used the neighborhood
as a stepping stone to more
affluence and power), but
the security of food and
shelter—if you worked hard.
What more could one want?

Oppression

The ACLU once again brings
to court the battle to keep
the Nativity Scene off the
steps of the City and County
Building at "Christmas Time."
So in 1984 “community” news-
papers repeatedly publish
stories about Jews control-
ling the world. And in 1984
while the Left recognizes
Jews only as oppressors,
the out-and-out “hate"
literature (of the Right)
against Blacks,
Communists, Homosexuals and
JEWS still slipped under
doorways and into mailboxes
in the middle of the night
to protect and inform their
White Racial Comrades. And
in 1984, these Good White
Christian Americans are org-
anizing and practicing with
firearms in the mountains of
Colorado and the brush of
Kansas to “protect and de-
fend" themselves and their
families from all "impure"
races of this world.

I intended this article to
be an overview of the history
of anti-Semitism...a look at
the ancient hatred and ver-
secution of the Jewish peo-
ple. In the process of my
research, I became more and
more attuned to the anti-
Semitism of today! The ex-
changes that I had with
neighbors, co-workers, poli-
tical comrades and friends
became more and more disturb-
ing. The lack of information
in the Denver Public Library
and in Denver bookstores on
historical persecution of the
Jewish people told me that
tactics/conspiracy of silence
are still effectively used

to (mis)educate the public.

While I have never been
silent about my Judaism, it
became clearer that the more
vocal I became about who I
am, the more prominent became
the anti-Semitic comments.
(Or perhaps it was that I
became more aware of the
actions and comments which
have all along been made.)

I was born in 1953 and
raised in Queens, NY (a bo-
rough of NYC) in an orthodox
Jewish family/household. A
working-class white commun-
ity where first and second
generation "Americans" could
attain the golden dream.

Work conscientiously and di-
ligently and honestly and

I learned young that the
months and years by which we
lived in the house were dif-
ferent from that on the out-
side. (The Jewish months are
lunar, and the year is 5744).
I knew young that not only
was our Jewish calendar dif-
ferent from the Christian cal-
endar, but that the
Christian calendar was the
one accepted in the world.

I also knew that our foods
and customs were different
from those in the public

schools. I learned quite early
that I was marked for the
killing of Christ, as all Jews

are! (I was informed of this
by a neighborhood kid, as he
struck me with a flour sock
one Halloween). I knew in my
gut that something horrible
had happened to many Jews,
death by a government (al-
though I can't remember it
actually being talked about),
and that some of my neighbors

had accents (more so than mine)

and were very scarred (and
scared) people who had es-
caped with their lives only
to America. I learned early
that we were not rich and did
not have a lot of things, but
that we must appreciate for
clothing and food and shelter.
While I never felt the signi-
ficance of being of European
descent (for all the neigh-
borhood was such...Poland,
Russia, Italy, Germany, etc.),
I always knew of the differ-
ence of being Jewish (in this
Christian world) and of being
working class (where capital-
ism prospers and middle class
is the goal). My mom told me
stories of my grandfather who
was pro-labor..."a boss is
always a boss and a worker is
always a worker. You are a
worker, remember that and be
proud."

So I knew of oppression as
a Jew and as a worker too.

I was little aware at the time
of what it meant to be a girl
rather than a boy, in terms

of oppression that is. In any
case, I knew I was lucky to

be alive, and have food and
shelter.

So I grew every day—under
the Christian calendar and
under a White Christian gov-
ernment. My politics grew too!
I made many political connect-

ions about oppression...as a
Jew, as working class, as a
woman! And the connections

grew, recognizing a bond I
had with other oppressed peo-
ples. It became a part of my
life to support and understand
not only "my own" but all
oppressed peoples' revolutionary struggles. For I knew our
safety and freedom as working
class and poor, Jews, women,
Blacks, Puerto Ricans, Native
Americans, Chicano-Mexicanos
and all peoples of color were
all dependent on each other,

and that we must work together.

Moving to Denver, Colorado
in 1979 was only another evi-
dence in anti-Semitic and
racist chapters. Seeing the
Nativity Scene on the City
and County Building steps was
a slap in the face welcome.
Hearing the immediate racist
slurs against Chicano/Mexicano
peoples and Native Americans
told me a lot about racism and
anti-Semitism Colorado style.

I guess they (men and women)
just couldn't believe it for
I “didn't look it" and didn't
live up to their stereotypes.
No dark curly hair, hook nose
and pointed horns (like the
Devil) and I wasn't rich or
pushy or manipulative or
hypocritical or whatever else
went on in heads and out of
mouths to explain the stere-
otypic Jew.

(Seems common biggies on
stereotyping and bigotry of
Jews includes anti-Christian
accusations and control of
money. The stereotype of Jews
being rich and controlling of
money stems from some histor-
ic anti-Semitism itself. In
Medieval Europe when Christ-
ianity flourished, money, gold
etc. was looked at as evil
and devilish. Since the

Christians wanted to prosper
but didn't want to be associ-

ated with the devil, the
only people allowed into
these positions (of usury)
were Jews (and there was lit-
tle else open to the Jewish
people). Thus the reputation
of Jews and money. To this
day Jews are attacked for
this Christian act and the
myth grows. It has created
a great scapegoat too, for
those truly in power and con-
trol. To this day too, a
Jew is attacked for merely
being a Jew!)

So I knew from everyday life
that anti-Semitism continued.
