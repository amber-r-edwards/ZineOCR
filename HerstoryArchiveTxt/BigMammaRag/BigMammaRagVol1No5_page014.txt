If you're a woman and you have  
a degree in communications  
there are few opportunities  
open to you in a male-dominated  
broadcasting industry.  

What can you do to combat the  
inequities of the employment  
situation?  

One group of women in Denver  
have faced this problem by  
starting their own radio  
station. Begun by Yvonne  
Stith two months ago, the  

group ranges in age from 18  
to 65. Its chief goal is to  

offer employment to women who  

are in communications in the  
broadcasting field.  
The group plans on programming  

that includes a wide variety  

of music performed by women,  

consumer information and news  
that will  

include items of  

human interest.  
The station will  

also feature children’s  
programming.  

To avoid  
condescending approaches or  
many actually produced teen pro-  

grams

So far they have  
more encouragement than  
opposition from the men in  
the broadcasting field and  
to measure public support  
they are conducting a tele-  
phone survey of this area.  

To raise money they are or-  
ganizing a concert in the  
fall. They hope this will  
include many well-known fe-  
male artists from all over  

this project would be used  

to purchase a station. They  
need to raise enough for one  
year's operating expenses  

and a down payment on the  
station. They were officially  
incorporated on August 10,  

Meetings are held every Sun-  
day at St. Thomas Episcopal  
Church at 22nd Ave. and Dex-  
ter at 7:00 p.m.
