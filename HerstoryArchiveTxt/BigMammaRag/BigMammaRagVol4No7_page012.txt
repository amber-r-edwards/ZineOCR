Always A Lady

Rosalie Sorrels  
Philo Records

Kate Sharp

To anyone who knows and loves the  
music of Rosalie Sorrels, this album  
is certainly the best she has offer-  
ed us yet. It's a sampling of a  
great many of those songs so many of  
us go to her concerts expressly hop-  
ing to hear. "Mehitabel's Theme" is  
here. So is "Apple of My Eye" and  
"Did I Knock?".

But for the women who are not fa-  
miliar with Rosalie or her work, she  
needs a bit of an introduction. She  
forever jokes in concerts that she's  
tired of being billed "The Singing  
Grandmother From Utah." Whatever her  
age, she has acquired both a sober  
wisdom and wit about children, love,  
and life. All these things are  
Rosalie's themes on this album, and  
her philosophy is that women should  
enjoy and not be oppressed by any of  
them. She realizes this is not easy,  
and doles out some pretty sound ad-  
vice. Although in her political life  
Rosalie is a very active abortion ad-  
vocate, she seems to see great value  
in living with children while always  
keeping the experience in perspec-  
tive.

She knows what it's like when "...  
it's 5:30 in the morning. That kid  
has not quit howling now for six ho-  
urs. You're getting sort of desper-  
ate, breaking out in a cold sweat  
because you know all those other kids  
are going to get up in about another  
half hour and they're going to demand  
cereal and peanut butter sandwiches  
and milk. And you forgot to get milk  
...Things are getting awful bad and  
you have need of something...Every

Scoundrel Time, Lillian Hellman's la-  
test book of memoirs, is about her  
personal ordeal through the McCarthy  
era. Although it offers no political  
analysis, she shares some interesting  
reflections the feminist movement  
should consider.

She contends the seeds of Watergate  
lay in Nixon's cooperation with and  
exposure to McCarthy tactics. Nixon  
simply elevated the stakes of politi-  
cal opportunism to the granddaddy of  
them all, the White House.

Hellman maintains that nothing in  
the United States can last more than  
ten years, and the downfall of McCar-  
thy resulted from the public's bore-  
dom, not outrage. Nixon's subsequent  
election to the presidency resulted  
from the prevailing attitude that "it  
is considered unhealthy in America to  
remember mistakes, neurotic to think  
about them, and psychotic to dwell  
upon them."

Her personal history of the 50's is  
annotated through intertwining vig-  
nettes about the people and places of  
her life. Prominent among them is the  
influence of her lover of several de-  
cades, Dashiell Hammett, a self-avowed  
radical and probable member of the  
Communist Party. His appearance be-  
fore the House on Un-American Activi-  
ties Committee and subsequent jail  
sentence, IRS income attachments, and  
blacklisting provide a forum for Hell-  
man to ascertain her own ideology.

It boils down to the liberal vs. rad-  
ical conflict, with the added twist  
that she has to reject both. Disillu-  
sionment with liberals and intellec-  
tuals has left her in the painful (a  
direct quote) place of substituting

a non-political stance she calls de-  
cency, since she views radicalism as  
"too many people acting in strange

and aimless violence."

No political lightweight in her time  
she actively campaigned for the 1948  
Progressive Party presidential cam-  
paign of Henry Wallace, visited Rus-  
sia as an emissary in 1944, fraterni-  
zed with and attended Communist meet-  
ings in the 30's, and tackled polit-  
ical issues in her plays (fascism in

culture's got one, it's the hostile  
baby rocking song. You can't keep  
that stuff bottled-up inside, you  
gotta let it out somehow...So you ta-  
ke that baby and you rock it firmly,  
smile sweetly and you sing the hosti-  
le baby rocking song." Then Rosalie  
sings, "This is the day we give bab-  
ies away, with a half a pound of tea

But Rosalie's incredible love for  
her children continuously comes thro-  
ugh on this album. "Apple of My Eye"  
is the story of the age-old conflict  
of wanting to save children from ne-  
edless pain but knowing they cannot  
blossom if they're over-protected.  
She sings, "What can I say, but that  
it's not easy? I cannot lift the sto-

Watch on the Rhine).

It was no surprise that she would  
inevitably be called as a witness by  
the Un-American Activities Committee.  
But her appearance and legal strategy  
were to become a turning point in the  
heretofore unchecked vigilantism of  
the committee.

Hellman refused to bow to the para-  
noia of the times and would not plead  
the Fifth Amendment. She agreed to  
answer any questions about herself  
and her own activities, but refused to  
answer any questions about others--  
friends, colleagues or strangers. The  
intricacies of how she became a suc-  
cessful test case are exciting to any  
reader who fantasizes about "beating  
the system."

I usually dislike any formal book  
introduction of more than two pages  
written by anyone other than the  
author. Teasers, value judgments and  
untimely secrets usually spoil the  
freshness of the work itself. Scoun-  
drel Time's introduction is the ex-  
ception. Pertinent historical infor-  
mation by Garry Wills sets a neces-  
sary stage for Hellman's easily read-  
able, often humorous and almost folk-  
sy approach to a subject she readily  
admits she will never recover from.

Far from perfect, she never confronts  
her classism; she defines the  
loss of her middle-class security  
during her blacklisting days in terms  
of a $100,000 annual income. Nor  
does she relate even obtusely to any  
feminist connectors or issues.

But the inherent joys of reading  
the memoirs of a self-assertive woman  
still concerned by what she will wear  
in the courtroom in the midst of cha-  
llenging the tyranny of our political  
system, conveys a trust only felt for  
someone who actively struggles to  
keep herself honestly in perspective.

...and I can't cry  
your bitter tears for you. I would if  
I could - what can I say?"

One of Rosalie's favorite concert  
renditions, which also appears on  
this album, has long been "Mehita-  
bel's Theme". It's a song about "the  
subject of, you should pardon the ex-  
pression, marriage." Rosalie, as Me-  
hitabel, the cat, says, "It has been  
my experience that marriage just me-  
ans one damn jitter after another."  
But Mehitabel tries it because she  
will "try anything once." "Well I was  
wrong," she says, the upshot was that  
I rustled for grub for that low-life  
bum for about three months and when  
the kittens came, he left." But Mehit-  
abel ends up removing his left eye.

Women On Television: CAMEO  
Lisbeth Springer and Tea

Every Sunday a group of dykes get  
together for an informal softball ga-  
me in Cheesman Park. On July 4th, they  
were playing their usual game, when  
they noticed that people whom they did  
not know were taking movies of the ga-  
me. One of the more bold asked the  
group why they were taking these pic-  
tures of a simple dyke game. The an-  
swer was that a new television show,  
to be called "Cameo", was starting  
the next Sunday. It was to be a show  
about women in Denver and Colorado.  
And our game was going to be on TV.

They continued taking pictures of  
all the activities of the women pres-  
ent - including the women who were  
"making out" on a blanket.

That next Sunday there was no soft-  
ball game. One woman had a television  
set, so all the players were at her  
house, waiting to see themselves on  
the telly. And that is the story of  
how we came to watch "Cameo", a show  
that had no publicity and no advance  
warning.

"Cameo" is a monthly production of  
Channel 7 at 1:30 pm. The moderator of  
this first show, which was run in a  
talk-show format, was Cynthia Small.  
Each show is to be a spotlight on  
specific topics pertinent to women.  
Some shows are to be single-guest  
with a woman or man who is in a non-  
traditional job. Some shows, of cour-  
se, will have men on them, giving  
their views. This first show, fortun-  
ately, did not have any men in front  
of the camera.

The theme of this first show was  
"the changing role of women". Dotty

of history at CU, Boulder, presented

Big Mama Rag Vol. 4 No. 7

with her right claw and concludes that  
"trial marriage, or companionate marr-  
iage or plain old American variety  
seven days a week, three meals a day  
with no Thursdays off marriage..." is  
nothing but a "curse" and is something  
she certainly wants nothing more to do  
with.

Rosalie sings about the unfortunately  
common phenomenon of loving someone  
she knows it's better she should not  
love in "Did I Knock?". She sings,  

"If you opened the door, I might find  
myself coming in once more...Then I'd  
be bound...I'd never leave the ground  

...and I'd never find the way to fly!"

She sings about taking risks in life  
in order to make life worth living. Of  
The Moth she writes in her liner notes  
"This song is for the reckless ones  
who walk around on the edges, with par-  
ticular affection for those who have  
slipped and fallen." The song is about  
a moth who wants to see "the secret  
heart of a flame" and flies to its  
death to see it. The moth's philoso-  
phy is that, "We moths would rather  
know beauty once and then just cease  
to be, than never know beauty at all  
and live an eternity." Substitute free-  
dom for beauty if you like, the mess-  
age is the same.

Rosalie's philosophies, advice and  
perceptions are ones that should make  
any woman sit up, take account of her  
life, demand what she needs and wants  
from life, and begin taking all those  
risks that make life worth living.

historical background on the role  
of women pioneers in Colorado.  
Their information was interesting;  
particularly their comments on the  
success of women's suffrage in the  
west.

Moving into more recent times, the  
discussion was based mainly on gener-  
al impressions rather than facts. Un-  
fortunately, few of these impressions  
were anything more than a superficial  
examination of the issue. The discus-  
sion centered around women expanding  
into the traditional male workforce.  
One woman talked about being a lawyer  
in terms of how she could now have a  
career in addition to a family. She  
spoke only of the changes in her per-  
sonal life and did not seem to see  
women entering the legal profession  
as a political strategy.

This lack of analysis was evident  
throughout. There was very little  
depth to most comments. The general  
tone seemed to imply that all problems  
could be solved through legal reforms  
and women joining the workforce. We  
would like to have seen more analysis  
of why the present conditions exist  
and the different strategies women  
are using to change them.

The purpose of having more than one  
guest is to invite interaction among  
the members of a talk show panel. In  
this show, the guests answered Small's  
questions and really had nothing to  
say to each other. This lack of in-  
teraction made for a dull show.

Hopefully, "Cameo" can be a forum  
for feminist groups and issues of im-  
portance to the community. The pos-  
sibilities are wide open within the  
theme alone. There is a potential to  
make this program different and more  
responsive to the women's community.  
As a side note, there were no dykes  
playing softball on that television  
show, either.
