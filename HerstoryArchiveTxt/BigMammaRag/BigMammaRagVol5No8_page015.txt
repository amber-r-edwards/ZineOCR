directions of forming national alli-  
ances that will carry beyond Houston  
in November.  

Coalitions are being formed in vari-  
ous states to achieve goals similar to  
those of the CLFC. Communication with  
these groups prior to the convention  
is the secondary goal of the communi-  
cation task force.  

As in any group planning action at  
a future event, the CLFC has faced a  
great many problems, some of which  
still plague the coalition.  

Where initially women were meeting  
to discuss the possibilities of lobby-  
ing at the convention and what could  
be done to assist the delegates, the  
coalition became a forum for ideas that  
at times bordered on the overly imagin-  
ative. Members, while admitting that  
issues were clouded by such tangents,  
explained that they were only means by  
which to get more women into the con-  
vention.  

One idea was to present the com-  
mission choosing the official obser-  
vers with a fictional name, the ini-  
tials of which spelled CWAC, an ‘in'  
joke on the commission and anyone  
else who would fall for it. The CWAC  
group would send a letter to the  
commission asking for representatives  
to receive observer status. Rumor  
had it that special, straight, normal  
ladies groups might have a better  
chance of getting the status.  

At that point, it became obvious  
that there was a defined division of  
energy. Some of the women were con-  
cerned with how the group would be able  
to assist others in obtaining observer  
status by circumventing the establish-  
ed method and others wanted to get on  
with the business of deciding what the  
priorities of the group were and the  
setting up of coordination of transpor-  
tation and housing for women.  

From the perspective of those whose  
primary concern was transportation,  
the coalition required structure and  
defined goals, a feeling shared by  
the women who were looking ahead to the  
overwhelming possibilities of the con-  
vention.  

At the same time, there were  
further complications with the conven-  
tion based on the irregularity and  
confusion resulting from the informa-  
tion provided by the commission which  
is scant at best.  

With the lack of cooperation from  
the state committee, specifically the  
still unpublished state of the Colorado  
Plan of Action, the coalition was with-  
out a sense of true direction. Without  
that information and the lack of deci-  
siveness on the part of the national  
commission, the coalition could not be-  
gin to function with any real purpose.  
The confusion from the national commis-  
sion centered around the constant re-  
vision of rules, neglecting to dissem-  
inate information to be used by women  
not chosen as delegates, not informing  
women of what is actually to be gained  
from the convention in terms of recom-  
mendations, and the inclusion of MEN  
as not only representatives, but as  
VOTING DELEGATES with the right to make  
decisions regarding the rights of women  
at a WOMEN'S convention.  

Faced with such odds, it is not in-  
conceivable that a convention coalition  
should experience the confusion that  
occurred.  

Structurally, the coalition has re-  
cently made decisions regarding how the  
meetings would be run, the distribution  

NOW & the SWP  

the Colorado NOW delegation to Detroit  
would have voted for the anti-SWP reso-  
lution. They called it speculation. A  
member of the East Denver NOW chapter  
later said that six chapter members in  
that delegation would not have voted  
for the resolution, and in fact, later  
wrote a letter to the national board  
condemning it.  

This conflict within NOW marks the  
second time that the women's movement  
has had a major confrontation with its  
members who are also in the SWP. The  
first came in the early ‘70s when abor-  
tion rights supporters who were also in  
the SWP refused to support lesbian  
rights as part of our right to control  
our bodies. That conflict ended with  
a number of SWP women being driven out  
of the movement, and with the decision  
of others to leave the party. Since  
then, both the SWP and NOW have come  

of tasks, and who would be coordinating  
which energies.  

The coalition has two women who act  
as co-chairpersons, two women coordina-  
ting communications and the initial  
outreach for transportation. Other  
women are working on setting up work-  
shops and establishing communication at  
Seneca Falls, while still more are  
planning exactly what women will be  
able to do at the convention itself.  

The CLFC has defined the directions  
that energies must be channeled toward  
in order to accomplish anything of any  
worth. Where in the beginning there  
was no visible promise of effectiveness  
by organizing the thoughts and energies  
of the women who want to see something  
of value come from the convention, the  
CLFC appears to be conquering many of  
the problems that threatened the con-  
tinuance of the group and strengthens  
the likelihood that they will be effec-  
tive.  

In order for the coalition to work  
on an effective level, the women must  
have access to the information concern-  
ing the running of the convention and  
some prior knowledge of the ‘plans of  
action’ from not only Colorado, but the  
other states.  

In addition, the voices of women  
must be joined together in unity to  
demand accountability from not only  
the national commission but the state  
committees and the support coalitions  
that are being formed throughout the  
nation, gearing for a unification for  
making intelligent recommendations  
regarding the rights of all women.  

More women must have access to the in-  
formation that only a few privileged  
people possess.  

Coalitions are communicating with  
each other to help formulate a united  
front for Houston. Problems in or-  
ganizing such groups must be shared  
and groups made aware of the potential  
that the government had provided the  
movement with at taxpayer expense. —  
The government has set up a convention  
and an alternative that can be used  
as a forum for voicing the needs of  
women. What was intended to pacify  
those women who will be excluded from  
the convention can be utilized  
to plant the seeds of unifying the  
efforts of women who have been working  
independently of others. Sharing our  
information, experiences, resources,  
and skills for the betterment of women  
can be only one of the achievements  
we can accomplish through the unexpect-  

ed opportunity we have been handed.  

Turning the alternative into what  
should be an excellent opportunity has  
to be a priority.  

The CLFC and other groups must get  
down to the basics of using the poten-  
tial presented to us and turning it  
into a tool for future organizing.  
Such coalitions must raise the aware-  
ness of women and get the information  
available to them. Women must be  
aware of the issues and the ramifica-  
tions of the voting, the sympathies  
of the delegates, where the threat  
really is, what it is. Women must  
consolidate efforts and recommendations  
from the delegates.  

The importance of the convention  
can only be estimated at this point.  
What recommendations come from the  
work of women in Houston will not be  
certain until the final votes are in  
and it's too late to do anything more.

around to supporting lesbian rights,  
both as a right to control our bodies  
and within an analysis of heterosexism.  

This time the issue is different.  
On one level, there are political  
differences about ideas and strategy.  
And on another, there is the question  
of the independence of NOW.  

Many women on both sides of the  
strategy debate (i.e. electoral poli-  
tics "versus" demonstrations) see  
the influence of the SWP as a threat  
to NOW's independence from the agenda  
of another political party. The ques-  
tion can be asked from the other side  
as well: To what extent will reliance  
on electoral politics keep NOW free  
from the agendas of the Democrats and  
Republicans? If those issues can be  
resolved without red-baiting, perhaps  
feminist theory will move a few steps  
forward.

lic libraries; I would guess that the other two books could also be a help in  
selecting library books. Or as Marie Kuda suggests, "...if each would hound  
libraries and bookstores for copies of some of these books we have really made  
headway..."

SWP Analysis  

will the decisions made by NOW fit in  
with the other programs of the SWP?  
The agenda may not be hidden, but  

the process of making it is.  

And that rankles. The second wave  
of feminism grew much differently:  
through small groups of women meeting  
collectively for consciousness raising  
and actions based on their own needs,  
and working, when necessary, in prin-  
cipled coalitions with other groups.  
For many women who became feminists  
after experiencing the oppression of  
male-dominated, new/old left groups,  
this independence and collective ap-  
proach was (and is) the heart of  
feminism.  

In working with SWP women, it's  
easy to feel that something is not  
quite upfront. One example was the  
organizing around International Wom-  
en's Day. The platform of demands  
finally developed by the IWD coalition  
was strongly feminist-socialist in  
content: a platform any SWP member  
should have felt comfortable with.  
However, SWP women participating in  
some of the meetings wanted it toned  
down—with the idea that less political  
women would then be able to relate to  
the march, would turn out in greater  
numbers, etc. Fine idea, but whatever  
happened to organizing around your own  
convictions? (Speaking of upfrontness,  
everyone in the IWD coalition agreed  
not to "pack" the meeting where the  
final decisions were to be made:  
everyone abided by that except the SWP  
participants.)  

My feelings about the SWP in re-  
lation to NOW are mixed. I see the  
ideas of the SWP women as a progres-  
sive force in NOW—set against the  
priorities of the leadership and the  
women who are working their way up  
the corporate ladder. Yet, the ques-  
tion of process can't be dismissed.  

Another way to look at this is by  
asking how much longer NOW can hon-  
estly profess to be open to any woman  
of any political (party) persuasion.  
A woman who wants to focus her work  
on lobbying the major political par-  
ties for reforms is in fundamental  
disagreement with a woman who is a  
socialist, and who has formed her pol-  
itics out of the lessons of civil  
rights and anti-war actions. Both  
sides in NOW insist that “unity” is  
important, but the question remains,  
why on earth do they want to work to-  
gether in the same organization?  

Rape  

the houses of known rapists; following  
rapists around for days hassling them  
and announcing to all within earshot  
that this is a rapist; publishing  
"wanted" posters with a photo and des-  
cription of a rapist etc.  

Individual women can carry water pis-  
tols filled with dye to squirt at men  
or mace spray cans or whistles. Or we  
can learn self-defense and wear com-  
fortable clothes ready for action.  

These are just a few ways we can  
develop our strengths so that we no  
longer need to rely on our persecutors  
for our freedom of movement.

Welfare  

overwhelming majority of people on wel-  
fare want to work, but they want real  
jobs, with decent wages and benefits.  
The jobs they're talking about cre-  
ating have second class status.  

They won't be paid the prevailing  
wage, they won't have vacation leave,  
employment security or the right to  
unionize. They're not permanent jobs  
and there's no guarantee that if you  
worked at one of these jobs, for six  
months say, that you'd have priority  
for regular hiring. Every year  
you'll be required to go through an-  
other period on intensive search.

fident it will continue to grow and

the time, the festival is one oppor-
