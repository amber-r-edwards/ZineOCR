Local Woman  
Sues Robbins  
Company  

Carie Palmer, a Denver woman who  
blames a faulty I.U.D. for her near  
death and emergency hysterectomy, is  
suing the A.H. Robbins Co. Inc. for  
12.5 million dollars. In 1975 the  
same company paid a reported 1.5 million  
dollar out-of-court settlement in  
a similar case.  

Ms. Palmer contends that a Dalkon  
Shield IUD was responsible for a  
uterine infection which resulted in a  
septic abortion and her subsequent  
hysterectomy. As many as 200 cases  
of septic abortion have been attributed  
to the Dalkon Shield.  

The Dalkon Shield was first marketed  
in the early 70s. It was taken off  
the market for a short time in 1974  
as the device was suspected of causing  
septic abortions causing the deaths of  
at least 15 pregnant women.  

The current scientific theory is that  
a string attached to the shield acts  
as a wick transporting bacteria from  
its end in the vagina to the womb.  
Whereas most natural miscarriages  
begin with an infection within the  
placenta, in IUD-induced septic  
abortions the infection begins outside  
the placenta affecting wide areas  
before they actually invade the  
protective sac and destroy the fetus.  

Ms. Palmer also contends that she  
is suffering from vomiting and head-  
aches as a result of a hormone imbal-  
ance resulting from her hysterectomy.  
Her attorney stated that the A.H.  
Robbins Company has not published  
results of studies which show the  
Dalkon Shield to be dangerous when  
left in pregnant women. The attorney  
contends that doctors would have  
removed the device from any patient  
who became pregnant while using it if  
the results of these studies had been  
released.  

The trial is expected to continue  
until the end of July.

Rocky Flats  

Protestors Have  
Days In Court  

Most of the 299 defendants arrested  
for trespassing while protesting at  
Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant on  
April 29, 1979 have been to trial.  

Of the 238 cases heard by 4 different  
judges, all have been convicted. The  
courts have consistently refused to  
hear testimony of the direct dangers  
posed by Rocky Flats nuclear weapons  
plant and have restricted testimony  
to the trespassing charges, thus  
preventing protestors from defending  
themselves through arguments of Civil  
Disobedience.  

Of those convicted, two have re-  
ceived the maximum fine of $1000  
and/or 30 days in jail. One woman  
was fined $500. The jail terms have  
conveniently been arranged to prevent  
further organization by requiring the  
protestors to serve their sentences  
at different times during the summer  
months. The courts’ sentencing shows a  
shift in Federal and Department of  
Energy policies.  

Both the legal demonstrations and  
the civil disobedience actions were  
sponsored by the Rocky Flats Action  
Group. Since its formation in 1974,  
the Rocky Flats Action Group and asso-  
ciated groups have focused public and  
official concern on Rocky Flats both  
as an environmental hazard and as a  
threat to world peace. The Rocky Flats  
Action Group is a coalition of nine  
local organizations as well as citizens  
from the peace, environmental, health,  
religious, and scientific communities.  

Trials are expected to continue  
through the first week of July.

Boulder Lesbian Network  

To Celebrate First Anniversary  

Anna, Laurie, and Denise  
for the Boulder Lesbian Network  

This month marks the first birth-  
day of the Boulder Lesbian Network  
(BLN). The network continues to  
bring our ever-popular monthly  
coffeehouse, newsletter, speakers  
bureau, dances, spiritual celebrat-  
ions, and bi-monthly meetings.  
Originally, the group was known as  
the Boulder Lesbian Feminist Network,  
but in an effort to strengthen the  
organization, and embrace all women  
in the community without using pol-  
itical labels, the name was changed.  
The BLN is now a loosely knit group  
of women who strive to meet the  
social, political, and intellectual  
needs of our diverse membership.  

The BLN is sponsoring a holiday  
on July 21. With this celebration  
we hope to rejuvenate the solidarity  
and support in the community, wel-  
come new women, and determine our  
direction for the coming year. The  
festivities will begin at 9:30 a.m.  
at 1520 Euclid in Boulder. We will  
open with a short herstory of the  
lesbian activism in Boulder and pro-  
ceed to a workshop of community  
building involving everyone present.  

Bring food and drink, frisbees,  
etc. Barbecue grill on premises.  
Evening festivities will consist of  
dancing to two women’s bands and  
recorded disco in the Glen Miller  
Ballroom in University Memorial  
Center at 9 p.m.
