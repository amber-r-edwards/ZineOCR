Feminist Clinic: Working For Our Lives

(The Colorado Springs  
Women's Health Service Clinic  
collective wrote the following article on the areas of  
women's health they are currently concerned and  
working with).

The women's health movement  
is continually evolving with  
information from the past and  
present. Women's bodies are  
cyclical and affected by the  
cycles of the moon and ocean.

We have begun to return to  
our pasts and gather more  
knowledge from women who  
lived closer to earth. We've  
remembered how to be in touch  
with our menstrual cycles and  
fertile cycles, how the food  
we eat can keep us healthy  
and strong, how to prevent  
pregnancy with methods that  
aren't lethal to our health,  
how to keep a pregnancy from  
implanting in our uterus, how  
to plan the sex of our children,  
how to uncover the secrets of  
parthenogenesis. Our progress  
in women's health is keeping  
these paths open to our past  
mothers—sharing this  
information and keeping it  
alive in the future amid  
threats from those who would  
destroy us and our mother  
earth.

The Women's Health Service  
Clinic in Colorado Springs  
started as a consciousness  
raising group interested in  
learning more and more about  
our own bodies and how to  
share this with other women  
through self-health and self-  
examination. It evolved into  
a problem pregnancy counseling  
and referral agency and  
in 1975 opened as a health  
clinic serving the needs of  
lesbian and straight women.  
The clinic's philosophy helps  
women take responsibility for  
their own health care and  
sharing information through  
peer counseling. In the past  
six years, we have changed as  
we have rediscovered alternative  
approaches for ourselves  
as well as our clients.

Fertility awareness allows  
a woman to remember that her  
body is cyclical. Women are  
able to get in touch with  
their ovulation by listening  
to their bodies, checking  
cervical mucus, taking basal  

body temperature and charting  
monthly menstrual cycles. With  
this knowledge of the time of  
fertility, we are able to prevent  
pregnancy or to begin a  
pregnancy. Most women ovulate  
13-15 days before their menses  
start. The cervical mucus  
changes throughout the cycle,  
becoming thick—almost like  
egg white at the time of ovulation.  
The basal body temperature dips,  
then remains high for three  
consecutive times after ovulation  
occurs. A woman who knows when she is  
fertile can use this information  
as a form of birth control alone  
or as a backup method with barrier  
birth control. It is also very useful  
for women seeking artificial  
insemination to be able to pinpoint  
the time of ovulation.

Many vaginal discharges can  
be normal and oftentimes are  
just an imbalance in the ecosystem  
of our vagina which contains various  
bacteria and yeast. Our daily diet  
and environment can help promote  
these imbalances: sugar, alcohol,  
antibiotic therapy, nylon  
underwear, tight jeans, hot  
tub use, and sex with infected  
partners. Widening the self-  
health approach means trying  
to care for routine problems  
on our own, using herbs and  
ingredients found at home such  
as yogurt, garlic, and vinegar.  
Often when a woman calls for  
an appointment concerning a  
minor vaginal infection, she  
is advised to try an herbal  
treatment before coming in.

We usually offer herbal alternatives,  
acupressure, or suggest massage for  
many problems. Diet and stress  
reduction are also discussed because  
these factors are very important in  
keeping our bodies in their  
natural balance.

Fat consciousness—"Being  
Fat in a Body-Conscious  
(looksist) Society" is a support  
group being offered to discuss  
the oppression of fat women.  
Women who are 30 pounds or more  
than their "average" weight are  
labelled obese by straight medical  
professionals and are told they are  
out of control and need to limit  
eating and to go on a DIET.

The diet industry is killing  
fat women with false information  
and fad diets. Most women  
will lose 10-15 pounds and  
gain back 20-25. It is actually  
healthier to stay overweight,  
eat a well-balanced diet and  
get regular exercise than to  
go on fad diets and deprive  
oneself of food. The gaining  
and losing puts a tremendous  
strain on your heart. The  
diet industry in the US is  
a billion-dollar industry,  
largely supported by women,  
with a success rate of only  
1%. Only 1% are successful in  
losing weight and keeping it  
off.

The cervical cap has been  
used in this country and  
Europe for over 100 years.  
It is a barrier method that  
is an option for women and  
can be more convenient and  
less messy than a diaphragm.  
The cervical cap can be left  
in place for 24 hours and no  
additional spermicide is  
needed. However, the US gov-  
ernment, specifically the  
FDA, is trying to limit  
women's choices again by  
classifying the cervical cap  
for investigational use only  
in a category with the IUD and  
pacemaker. This means only  
clinics which are part of an  
approved FDA study can distribute  
the cervical cap.

The cervical cap appears to  
be the cheapest form of birth  
control, other than fertility  
awareness. We currently charge  
$35 for a fitting ($25 before  
the extra hassles of the FDA  
study requirements), and  
costs of spermicide are minimal.  
We believe that the FDA is  
cracking down on the cervical  
cap because it limits  
US industry and doctor profits.  
The cap is currently imported  
from England. When Barbara Seaman  
(author of Women and the Crisis in  
Sex Hormones) asked Ortho to  
manufacture the cap, they said  
it was too low a profit item  
and it would cut into spermicide  
sales. As with the diaphragm,  
the key to cap use  
is that the user is comfortable  
with her method and this  
takes a lot of a doctor's  
time (not like prescribing  
birth control pills) and the  
women might not need a yearly  
checkup. The doctor would  
then either charge an exorbitant  
fee or not fit them at  
all. We also feel many doctors  
aren't supportive of cervical  
caps because generally they are  
fit by paramedics and by feminist  
clinics.

In 1979, we started doing  
outpatient second trimester  
abortions (12-16 weeks from  
first day of last menstrual  
period). We feel that this  
is an important service for  
women to be able to have  
outpatient, second trimester  
abortions because they are  
easier and less traumatic for  
the women physically and  
emotionally than a saline or  
prostaglandin procedure in  
which the woman actually goes  
through labor and delivers a  
dead fetus. Like our first  
trimester procedures, a D & E,  
(dilation and evacuation)  
method is employed but the  
difference is that multiple  
laminaria (seaweed dilators)  
are used. We are the only  
facility offering second tri-  
mester outpatient procedures  
to Medicaid women. Colorado  
still accepts Medicaid for  
abortions; however, doctors  
and even clinics don't accept  
it because of the paperwork  
involved and because they  
don't get full reimbursement  
from Medicaid for procedures.

The women's health movement  
has made many advances but all  
of us must remain alert to  
the political factors which  
are attempting to limit our  
choices, whether gay or  
straight. The Human Life  
Amendment (and other bills) will  
not only threaten abortion  
but the use of some birth  
control methods and our ex-  
tended families. The Reagan  
administration will continue  
to cut services to poor,  
Medicaid, teenage, and military  
women in health care and  
other areas. We must remember  
and continue our struggles.
