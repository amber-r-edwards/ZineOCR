example of this last spring at a
mental health conference. A
male psychiatrist was describing
some research he had done on
the outcome of treatment in an
innovative, rather radical treat-
ment program. One of his
criteria for patient improvement
was the ability to “maintain a
satisfactory heterosexual
relationship.” NOW REALLY!
Don't some sex relationships
count in the measurement of a
person’s mental health? And
what does he mean by “satis-
factory” heterosexual relationship?
Can you just be friends or do you
have to fuck?

Masculinist definitions of
mental health happen on a per-

sonal level as well as among
professionals. How many of you
have had men accuse you of be-
ing sick and needing help
because you weirded out in the
middle of a four-hour intense
argument, or cried for two weeks
after your cat died? How many
women have been packed off to
shrinks because of “frigidity” or

failure to experience “vaginal”

orgasms?

The lesson to learn here is
this: never accept a man’s
assessment of your mental
health, not your brother, father,
lover, husband, therapist, or the
president of the American Psy-
chological Association. In fact,
you would probably be better off
if you didn't worry about it. If you
do decide to seek help for your
head, do it because you want
help, not because you or
someone else thinks you need it.
The concept of needing psy-
chiatric help implies that
“problem” lies within the person
— that something is “wrong”
with her intrapsychic func-
tioning. In reality, much of the
craziness that women experience is the direct result of
socio/cultural oppression. But
that’s another column in itself.

Ya Hi We

Susan Blake

Beneath those oil-slicked black eyes
observing ancient ceremony
lies a being
at once identifying
at once reminiscing
recalling to mind
a presence
A seer of knowledge
the old woman
the middle years
the young maiden
the girl
the she child
to return around the circle again
without order.
A changing woman relieves her heritage,
her fertile seasons
her pains of growing
her pains of receiving
her pains of bearing
And stands a multimirrored
persona in the morning sun.

FROM A HOPELESS ROMANTIC
Corrie

dissecting an emotion,
intellectualizing — rationalizing
classifying — objectifying a feeling
pinning down each gut reaction

in order to find

the whys and hows and where
will this lead us

a soon to become tradition of
feminist consciousness perhaps —

intense awareness of every infinite possibility,

attempting to erase old patterns
and proclaim that romance is dead —
are we losing the ability to

just

simply

feel?
