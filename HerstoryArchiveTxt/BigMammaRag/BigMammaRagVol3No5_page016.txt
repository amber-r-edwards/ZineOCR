Publishers, Lawmakers Finally
See Sexism in Textbooks

Nancy Heine

“Examples of stereotyping
to be avoided: scatterbrained
female, fragile flower, god-
dess on a pedestal, catty
gossip, hen-pecking shrew,
apron-wearing mother, frus-
trated spinster...”

Editors at the McGraw-Hill
Book Co. have sharpened
their pencils and begun
attacking sexist educational
texts they publish. And
they're not alone. Other
publishers have joined the
battle.

According to studies on sex-role stereotyping in text-
books, plenty of editing is in
order. Though 51% of the US
population is female, the
studies discovered men far
outnumbering women in texts
at all grade levels. Women
who were presented were
shown as servile, fearful,
passive and dependent.

In a study of 554 elementary
readers, researcher Diane
Graebner found a ratio of
three boys to every two girls.
She determined that 75% of
all stories were about boys
and that boys made up 67.5%
of all illustrations. She found
that girls were depicted as
shallow and “mothers” invari-
ably wore skirts--even while
camping or hiking down the
Grand Canyon.

When the Women on Words
and Images (WWI) went
through 134 readers from 14
publishers, they found boys
outnumbering girls five to two
as lead characters in stories.
Their study uncovered six
biographies of a female. In
mathematics books, WWI
found boys solving astronomy
and chemistry problems and
learning to buy stocks while
girls measured curtains and
bought flour.

An investigation of social
studies texts by Richard
O’Donnell revealed 83% of the
occupations described be-
longed to males and only 17%
to females. The occupations
for females included waitresses,
housewives, secretaries
and other service or home-ori-
ented jobs. Seventy-two
males had prestigious jobs
while only one female was
shown in a similar role.
O'Donnell never found a male
doing dishes, cleaning or
handling childcare duties.

Perhaps the most exhaust-
ive research on high school
civic texts was published in
the book “You Won’t Do”:
What Textbooks on US Gov-
ernment Teach High School
Girls. Dr. Jennifer Macleod,
research psychologist, and
Sandra Silver(wo)man, femin-
ist consultant, dissected eight
leading civics texts and found
little mention of women in the
US political process.

They discovered that illus-
trations vastly underrepre-
sented women. Whereas 51 to
73% of the pictures showed
only men, a scant 3 to 9%
showed only women. They
saw only two pictures of
women in nontraditional
roles -- Senator Margaret
Chase Smith holding a bou-
quet of roses and Rep. Patsy
Mink throwing snowballs.

The researchers noted that
all political leaders were
drawn as male stick figures in
charts. In one book's intro-
ductory unit, “Understanding
Democracy,” a six-sketch
montage shows: a man
running for office; a man
reading about a male candi-
date; three men discussing
politics; a man watching a
three-man TV debate; a man
cheering a male candidate,
and a man voting.

Macleod and Silver(wo)man
found the reading matter no
less stereotyping. They un-
covered statements like: “the
ideal presidential candidate
is...an energetic member of
the male sex...Some day
perhaps, a Negro, a Jew, even
a woman, may have some
prospect of being the party
(presidential) nominee.”

While researchers, psycho-
logists and educators comb
textbooks for further evidence
of sex-role stereotyping, fed-
eral and state governments
have taken some steps to
eliminate the school book
sexism. Two bills which may
have some effect have already
been passed by Congress and
another is pending.

One of these bills, Title IX
of the Educational Amend-
ments of 1972, says that no
person on the basis of sex
shall “be subjected to dis-
crimination under any educa-
tional program” receiving fed-
eral funds. Whether or not this
covers the subject of text-
books has been a matter of
debate.

The New York Times noted
that Title IX failed “to cover
discriminatory curriculum
materials, such as textbooks
that contain sex bias.” The
Department of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare (HEW) added
that any attempt to ban the
use of such materials “would
raise grave constitutional
questions under the First
Amendment.”

According to Wilma
Scott Heide, past president of
the National Organization for
Women (NOW), “selection of
sexist texts by state action
(via the public school boards)
is a denial of individual First
Amendment rights of freedom
of speech by excluding,
derogating, and/or stereotyp-
ing women.”

Dr. Anne Scott, NOW
Legislative Vice President has
observed that, as is, there is
nothing in Title IX “that makes
a school system accountable
to its required statement of
non-discrimination.”

Another bill dealing with
sexist texts, the Women’s
Educational Equity Act of
1973, was recently signed by
President Ford. The bill
authorizes $30 million per year
to “encourage the develop-
ment of new and improved
curriculums” and to imple-
ment community-oriented ed-
ucational programs on women
in American history.

Senator Charles Percy has
introduced another bill to
Congress that would ensure
even more funding to “help
women gain their place as
equal beneficiaries of socie-
ty.” Percy's bill, the Women’s
Equal Educational Opportuni-
ty Act, is still in committee.

But while the federal
government continues deci-
sion-making over the matter,
eight state governments have
already outlawed sexism in
education and texts. For
instance, in California sexist
textbooks must be phased out
by 1975.

And publishing houses
have begun ferreting out sexist
references in their books. J.B.
Lippincott, the D.C. Heath
Co. and Harper and Row all
have said they are carefully
examining their manuscripts
for offensive sex-role stereo-
typing.

McGraw-Hill, which has
recently published an 11-page
“Guidelines for Equal Treat-
ment of the Sexes” stated:
“We realize that the language
of literature cannot be pre-
scribed, but we want to
encourage a greater freedom
for all individuals to pursue
their interests and realize their
potentials.”
