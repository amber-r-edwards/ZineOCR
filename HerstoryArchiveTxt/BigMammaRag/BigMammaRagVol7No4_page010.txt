Scraps from Macia’s Table

To: Denver Contingent  
From: Blaze and Chocolate  

Driving uneventful so far ex  
cept for one broken windshield wiper.  
Women's communities vastly different  
in range: Pocatello Idaho-- We were  
two hours late arriving and were  
greeted warmly by a woman who immed-  
iately handed us our money in $20  
dollar bills and rolled change. All  
their publicity was done underground  
and by word of mouth. One woman stay-  
ed with a friend for two days in ord-  
er to let us have her house and some  
privacy. An outstanding pot-luck was  
held for us before the show. Approx-  
imately 40 women attended. Such a  
varied community--small but strong,  
cohesive feminists in the heart of  
Mormonism and John Birchism. They  
were Lesbian and straight, working  
class and professors. Good age span  
too. They were very receptive--  
couldn't do enough for us. In Poca-  
tello, you can be "out" about being  
a John Bircher but not about being  
a Lesbian. The women here hide their  
women's records in bottom drawers.  

Boise--Home of Idaho's only  
gay bar, Shuckey's. We played a bar  
for the first time. Chocolate was  
heckled by three pricks during her  
first set. They left, but we were  
unnerved and shaken a little; mostly  
mad at ourselves for not more activ-  
ely fighting back. We'll know better  
the next time. There were about 75  
people, maybe 10 of whom were boys.  
It was the first time ANY entertain-  
ment was ever brought in specifically  
for a Lesbian/Gay audience. They  
went nuts. They stomped, cheered and  
gave us a standing ovation. Wanted us  
to return even with the same mater-  
ial. And our performance was signed  
for a deaf woman by her lover!  

It was the most successful  
night the bar had had in a long time  
but it didn't prompt Ron, the man-  
ager, to buy our breakfast! Instead  
he gave us "helpful" hints on how we  
could better reach the men in places  
where the audience was “mixed.”  
AUGHHH! PATOOIE!

A FRIENDLY SMILE ON THE ROAD!!!  

Our rendition of the Sal-  
vation Army Song ("Throw a nickel in  
the drum, save another drunken bum")  
left them singing and cheering,  
while one of the Boise Seven dragged  
Chocolate from the stage at the end  
of the infamous "I Wanna Come" poem.  

The Boise Seven are the  
seven (count ‘em) women who were  
fired from the Boise Police Dept  
for "crimes against nature.” The  
women here are totally apolitical,  
with zero feminist consciousness.  
The main concern is to get along  
well with the gay boys, a feat they’re  
very proud of. They have an ann-  
ual awards night--such dubious honors  
as Best-Looking, Most Likely to Suc-  
ceed, Most Popular and Most Stereo-  
typed. Meanwhile, the Boise Seven  
are taking the 5th Amendment on the  
Lesbian issue, hoping to win through  
illegal wire-tapping and obstruction  
of due process; instead, the Big L  
is a felony here in Idaho.  

Seattle--The women’s commu-  
nity here is very factionalized.  
There's everything from the DORIAN  
group, which has fought for sexual  
preference bills here, complete with  
the we-eat-and-drink-and-pee-just-  
like-other-people attitude, to the  
Gorgons, radical dyke separatists.  
Some women picket Meg Christian con-  
certs because she's not singing  
enough hate songs. Other women picket  
Alix Dobkin because she's not singing  
enough love songs. Many women here  
are heavily into anti-smoking, drink-  
ing only unfiltered apple juice, and  
doing alcoholism counseling. Others  
are into raising their children col-  
lectively and having babies together.  
One woman we've heard of has changed  
her name to Cottage Cheese, another  
to Thorn Cowdyke.  
The audience we played for  

here consisted of about 50 women and  
was one of the most difficult to  
perform for. There were women in the  
front row who were probably direct  
descendants of Carry Nation, and who  
cheered only when we made jokes about  
not drinking alcohol. There were women  
who, according to Blaze, "might as well  
have been part of the wall." Although  
the atmosphere seemed tense here, with  
a kind of prove-it-to-us attitude, the  
response we received after the show  
was more enthusiastic than we had rec-  
eived during the performance. One  
woman told Blaze she was “too good to  
be in this place and ought to be on  
television."  

It really does rain all the  
time in Seattle, just like the rumors  
say. At the Pike's Place Market, where  
they sell large quantities of horse-  
meat, we discover Rita Dyke's Bookstore.  
“Is that dyke as in lesbian?"..."No,  
that's Dyke as in last name."  

There's a large anti-nuclear  
power movement in Seattle which includes  
a “Dump Dixie Lee" campaign. And they  
don't like out-of-state visitors-- we  
spotted a bumper sticker that says "BE  
RUDE TO A TOURIST TODAY." So Chocolate  
buys a sticker that says "CAUTION: I  
SPEED UP TO RUN OVER SMALL ANIMALS.”

From Our Lives...  

Barbara  

“Heaven had appointed to one sex  
the superior and to the other the  
subordinate station... It is there-  
fore as much for the dignity as it  
is for the interest of females, in  
all respects to conform to the dut-  
ies of this relation.” (Essay on  
Slavery Abolitionism with Reference  
to the Duty of American Fem-  
ales. Philadelphia: Henry Perkins,  
1837), p. 99.  

Women are passive, nurturing, warm  
having inert* echoes. Men are indepen-  
dent, aggressive, capable of intel-  
lectual abstraction. Women have shared  
in society's patriarchal definition  
of them to the point of making these  
false statements come true. We have  
acquiesced to being a class of human  
beings deprived of selfhood, self  
respect and confidence. The instit-  
ution of marriage has played a strong  
role in securing for us a child-like  
security which relieves us of res-  
ponsibilities (read power). Marriage  
has traditionally given women the  
knowledge that they are complete.  

The meaning of these thoughts has  
become intensely real to me within  
the past several months. I am attempt-  
ing to shed some of the heavy role  
expectations that have become an in-  
tegral part of my definition of my-  
self. I am wanting to liberate my-  
self from the notions that I must be  
totally nurturing, self-sacrificing,  
and never considering my own needs.  

I am attempting to liberate myself  
within the framework of marriage. My  
goal is to create a partnership  
within my marriage, and at the  
same time have an independent life  
which uses my energy and intel-  
ligence to the maximum.  

As I look back upon my adult life,  
I have been painfully slow in going  
in this direction. A new thrust be-  
gan when my husband, children and I  
moved to Colorado this summer and  
my husband, Jim, began traveling a  
great deal. His job was exciting and  
gave him a feeling of satisfaction.  

I worked as a substitute teacher,  
took care of the house and children  
and in essence kept the "home fires"  
burning.  

Several months after this pattern  
began, we began marriage counseling  
as I became very resentful of Jim's  
absence. The counselor asked me what  
I was going to do to take care of my-  
self. I was startled and confused.  
The problem wasn't with me but with  
Jim. He wasn't supportive of me. He  
didn't care what pressures I was hav-  
ing at home!  

Jim and our counselor encouraged  
me to look at my own needs. One day  
after emotionally speaking of my  
frustrations, they asked me why I  
didn't go out and do what I wanted to  
do. My gut reaction was to punch them  
both. I got in touch with an intense  
anger. The insidious factor with my  
oppression, and the oppression of  
other women, was its subtlety. It had  
begun when I was young and was ex-  
pected to be passive, polite, and  
nurturing others’ needs. The praise  
that I received reinforced these be-  
haviors. To see myself as capable,  
even justified, in seeking my own  
satisfaction out of my life, seemed  
almost heretical.  

In high school, making plans to go  
to college, I was given two options.  

I could either go into nursing or  
teaching. I would eventually become  

a wife and mother and only in case of  
the death of my husband would I need  
to "fall back" on a profession. I be-  
came a teacher. Eight years ago I got  
married and had children. The proph-  
ecy was fulfilled. I continued to  
rely on others' definitions of what I  
should be to determine if I was suc-  
cessful. I was a nurturing mother, a  
supportive wife, and, to complete the  
image, I worked as a full-time teach-  
er. If my husband, children and the  
students I taught were without com-  
plaint, I was successful.  

Suggesting that I needed to take  
care of myself was terrifying. It  
threatened every definition I had of  
myself. I became more conscious of  
how my personal growth had been ret-  
arded through my home and society's  
oppressive rules. I no longer wanted  
to be dependent on Jim to determine  
my happiness. The first major change  
was to insist upon Jim's sharing the  
household responsibilities. I needed  
to let go and share mothering and  
nurturing of the children with him. I  
began expressing my own needs to my  
family.  

The solution to depending on Jim's  
income was for me to get a well-pay-  
ing job so we could share equally in  
the financial obligations. I began to  
feverishly look for a job. After be-  
ing turned down many times, I accepted  
a preschool teaching job. This job  
offers me little challenge, low status  
and no financial independence.  

I'm not sure what all of this means.  
I know that I can't use this job to  
bring me identity or security. I know  
that right now I cannot equally share  
in financial responsibilities with Jim.  
I know after thirty-six years of bel-  
ieving that I need a man to make me  
whole, it is difficult to have confid-  
ence in myself.  

This is what is frustrating me to-  
day. Tomorrow may bring a multitude  
of new insights.
