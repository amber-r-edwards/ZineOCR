pressed, we are playing right  
into the hands of our oppressors.  

This concept came clear to  
us when, during a discussion,  
one of us asked whether the  
Jews of Europe could have a-  
voided the Holocaust if they  
had been more vigilant in  
their own behalf. Another one  
said that regardless, the  
Jews could never have been  
successful against the organ-  
ized military might of the  
Germans. This would seem very  
likely; but the whole point  
of discussing all oppressions  
together is that oppressed  
peoples are oppressed because  
they lack power. If the Jews  
of Europe could have allied  
with other oppressed groups,  
they might have been able to  
avoid much of the destruction.  
(Indeed, the fate of the Jews  
in the various different Eu-  
ropean countries varied di-  
rectly with the willingness  
of the local population  

to work to resist the German  
plans for genocide.) If all

American oppressed groups,  

out of their self-interest  
and common concerns, can ally  
to work against all oppres-  
sion (without spending energy  
on deciding which oppression  
rates or doesn't), all of us  
will be able to create change.  

The answer your letter sug-  
gests for dealing with anti-  
Semitism is that Jews should  
focus on fighting the oppres-  
sion of all other oppressed  
people to the exclusion of  
our own. We believe that it  
is essential to acknowledge  
that anti-Semitism exists—  
separate from any other form  
of racism. And if we negate  
the importance of anti-Semi-  
tism, we will never learn the  
skills of resistance neces-  
sary for our survival.  

A genuine appreciation of  
other people's oppressions  
can only come from a deep and  
full understanding of our own.  
A true coalition among oppres-  
sed people can only function  
when each member understands  
her own distinct oppression,  
and then the coalition can  
work for the survival of all  
of its members. Emotional

connection and self-interest  
are much more dependable than  
political theory.  

Anti-Semitism exists today  
and is definitely a form of  
racism. Out of the five of us,  
two of our fathers remember  
frequent beatings for being  
Jews; one of us is currently  
losing her job as a result of  
anti-Semitism; two of our  
families were denied housing  
in Detroit; one of our grand-  
fathers was the first Jew to  
walk in the front door of a  
prominent resort in the Poco-  
nos, looking for work as a  
baker, after encountering a  
sign which read, "No Dogs or  
Jews." And when we as chil-  
dren asked our grandparents  
why they came here to Ameri-  
ca, where they encountered so  
much pain, they told us about  
the massacres in Eastern Eu-  
rope, ("What do you think, we  
won a lottery??!") Perhaps  
today in San Francisco at  
whatever jobs you are lucky  
enough to have, you are not  
experiencing anti-Semitism.  
But move to Chile or Argenti-  
na, where Jews imprisoned for  
working in leftist struggles  
receive exceptionally cruel  
treatment because they are  
Jews, and then tell us that  
we are not oppressed and that  
we in the U.S. have nothing  
to fear.  

Further, many Jews are poor,  
and while many are not, the  
real money and power in this  
country is not Jewish. The  
myth of Jews having great  
wealth and power is one of  
the older anti-Semitic myths.  
In your letter it appears  
that you use this myth to in-  
validate our oppression.  

As regards questions of  
Zionism:—It was never the  
intent of the majority of the  
Jews in Palestine to push the  
Arabs out. When the U.N. in  
1947 proposed a state made up  

of mainly Jewish and Arab  
enclaves, it was Arabs who  
forced the issue by invading  
and upending the plan. While  
some of us (and many Israelis)  
do not agree with the poli-  
cies of the current adminis-  
tration in Israel, we do be-  
lieve in the right of the  
Jews to have a national home-  
land and to continue to live  
in the desert they have trans-  
formed to farmland. There are  
problems with the conduct of  
every government. These pro-  
blems should be dealt with  
(just as we as Americans need  
to object to the activities  
that the U.S. government en-  
gages in in our names.) But  
these problems are not a rea-  
son to destroy any nation.  
The demand that Israel act in  
a way no other nation is ex-  
pected to act is anti-Semitic  
in itself. The fact that the  
world community isolates  
Israel to the point that it  
is forced to turn to South  
Africa for support only de-  
monstrates how confused the  
expectations are. The whites  
came to South Africa for eco-  
nomic exploitation, taking  
over a rich land from its  
rightful owners. The Jews  
came to Israel, the land of  
their historic origins, be-  
cause they had no place else  
to go. Israel was a barren,  
resourceless area whose ap-  
peal was certainly not econo-  
mic. Many of the people in  
Israel came from Arab lands  
that they were forced out of.  

For these reasons alone it  
is intolerable to suggest  
that Zionism comes from rac-  
ist/imperialist intentions.  
The real issue here is not  
whether Zionism is racism but  
rather why do we still ques-  
tion whether or not anti-  
Semitism is racism?! The his-  
torical facts are that every  
generation for over 2,000  
YEARS, somewhere in the world,  
Jews have been killed because  
they were Jews. We are not  
just talking about the Hol-  
ocaust of the 1940s, we are  
not just talking about the  
pogroms of the 1920s, nor  
about Chile and Argentina of  
the 1980s. You owe it to  
yourselves to open your eyes  
to the oppression of your own  
people and find out about one  
of the earliest ghettos the  
world has ever known. The Jews  
of today should be thousands  
of years past this question.
