Big Mama Rag Born Out  
of Frustration, Success  

Elissa Meyer  

Big Mama Rag was born out  
of the need for expression,  
women’s expression. She began  
as an idea conceived at a  
women’s festival in Denver and  
was published for the first time  
nine months later, in October of  
1972.  

The women who worked on  
the paper and grew with Big  
Mama have learned the depth of  
meaning involved in expression  
and communication. The paper  
has become much more to some  
of us than a form of mass media.  
We have learned to share the  
frustrations and successes of  
creation, to start with nothing  
and replace the emptiness with a  
reality.  

In the beginning the  
excitement of actually seeing  
those finished and folded pieces  
of newsprint, the paper that told  
our stories and reflected our  
emotions, was sufficient to  

enhance the dedication of our  
group. Most of us had full-time  
jobs in institutions or with  
children. We met and worked on  
the paper in the evenings and on  
weekends, and although we  
encountered many difficulties in  
trying to create a newspaper  
given our time limitations, we  
managed to publish pretty  
consistently every two months  
for over a year.  

Recent Grant  

Being proud and encouraged  
by our accomplishment, we  
pursued alternative modes for  
continuing and supporting the  
publication of Big Mama. In  
January of 1974 the Aton  
Foundation granted us a small  
sum of money to back the paper  
for six months. This money  
provides for one full-time salary  
of $350 per month, which we  
now split three ways among the  
co-editors, and for office  
expenses and some promotional  
money.  

Receiving this grant really  
marks a transitional period for  
Big Mama Rag. She has evolved  
from a feeling to a full-fledged  
periodical. And now the women  
who make up the staff are  
tackling the task of making Big  
Mama a successful business. Not  
in the sense of making a profit,  
but we do want the paper to  
become a self-supporting  

venture.  

SKILLED Seamstresses  
and Embroiderers  

A great part of reaching this  
goal depends on how much the  
women’s community of Denver  
shares our enthusiasm for this  
means of expression and  
relationship with each other.  
The paper’s longevity depends  
largely on continued financial  
and volunteer support, in the  
form of subscriptions,  
contributions and work.  

We have continually kept ears,  
eyes and hearts open for ways to  
raise the necessary money. We're  
looking forward to having a  
booth at the People’s Fair on  
May 11, and we would ask any  
woman who would like to  
exhibit arts and crafts and share  
the proceeds with us to call  
Becky at 623-3423 and join us.  
We also welcome any other  
fund-raising suggestions as well  
as the energy to carry them  
through.  

Thanks for Existing  

As the paper has developed  
throughout the last two years,  
the lives of those of us on the  
staff have changed, matured and  
mingled with each other’s. And  
when we stress the continuation  
of Big Mama we emphasize this  
process. Each time we receive a  
letter that says, “Thank you for  

existing. I live in Aurora (or  
Lakewood, or Golden, or  
Kansas), and when I see Big  

Mama Rag I realize that  
Feminism is active and growing  
and even reaching out here. I am  
delighted and encouraged.”  

Every time BMRA elicits that  
kind of response, the staff's  
sense of responsibility deepens.  
We grow in our commitment to  
one another and to the larger  
women’s movement. The  
recognition that women need to  
relate, to express, to exchange  
our stories and experiences has  
added significance to Big Mama  
as a paper and to our lives as her  
creators.  

Because of this commitment,  
the paper’s reputation is growing  
nationally. Presently, Big Mama  
Rag is ranked among the most  
successful women’s papers in the  
country, along with Ain’t I a  
Woman, Off Our Backs,  
Women’s Press (to name some).  
We are grateful to our readership  
and to the many women who  
have helped with the paper’s  
production.  

With this same kind of  
support, we will stay around and  
will continue to touch the  
spaces where women are  
growing stronger, where we are  
beginning to realize our  
potential as individuals, where  
women are emerging in affection  
and unity as Feminists. Because  
wherever this is happening our  
potential for social change is  
limitless.

Working Girl Mystique  

Lynda Hartman  

Have you ever heard of the  
“working boy mystique”? Well,  
neither have I. In the business  
world, there is a very definite  
“working girl mystique” where  
women are treated as girls.  

The mystique can be  
recognized by several  
characteristics. Men in offices  
are always looking for “girls”  
who will nurture them. It is not  
uncommon to be asked where  
supplies are; “Get me a pencil!  
I’m helpless,” they say, “serve  
me.”  

Many men are also always  
looking for “girl’s” asses to pinch  
or trying to look at their legs  
and breasts. The shortest  
dresses, lowest cut tops (of  
course not too low) are  
excellent forms of dress. The  
men sometimes start competing  
amongst each other for the  
cutest “girl.” To call a female a  
woman often brings sexuality  
into full force. Men do  
not/cannot want to face up to  
the fact that the women in the  
office have their own sexual  
feelings, which go beyond being  
treated as “girls.”  

I have had sexual feelings  
towards the people I see eight  
hours a day. The difference for  
me is that I do not feel a need to  
compete with the other women  
for the men. I do not need to  
say how I have brushed up  
against a man’s penis or looked  
at another woman’s breasts. I  
have had fantasies about some  
of the men in my office, but I  
see them as only fantasies and  
nothing more. I can enjoy  
flirting with these men when  
both of us know all along that  
we are just playing a game, and  
we have no further intentions. I  
can also appreciate compliments  
on my appearance when it is  

done as an appreciation of my  
sexuality, and not as a pretty  
“girl” fulfilling someone  
else’s needs.  

Often the mystique role also  
comes out when one sees  
women carrying coffee to their  
male workers. How often do you  
see a man carrying two cups of  
coffee? “Girls” carry coffee as  
part of their job. They are  
considered indispensable. It is  
easy to find another coffee  
carrier! Also of course the  
female does all the kitchen work  
at home, so she can do it in the  
office. Many women today are  
calling kitchen work a job that  
should be shared by everyone  
who eats.  

It seems to me that if office  
people of both sexes cannot even  
share very simple tasks, that we  
have a long way to go before  
people will be on a more equal  

basis in offices. All office  
workers are basically  
interdependent upon one  
another. The tasks of all cannot  
be done without the other  
people in the office. We are all  
people who have to work to  
survive. Unfortunately, until  
women are treated as women,  
equality will not be seen in the  
business world.  

The “girl mystique” in the  
office must be changed.  
Nurturing, sex objects, poor  
pay, lack of privacy and  
respectability of work all lead to  
the “girl mystique.” Let's not  
forget or let people put us in  
another place; we're women!  

Work Not Important?  

The “girl mystique” comes  
into play in terms of physical  
set-up of office space. Women  
are not given offices; they don’t  

need privacy. “Girl’s” work is  
not considered important  
enough for them to have the  
respect of their own office. I am  
now sitting in an area that was a  
secretary area in the entrance  
way to several offices. I am  
asked questions about the  
whereabouts of the men in the  
area even though they are in  
different departments and I  
rarely work with them.  

Salaries are another “girl  
mystique.” “Girls” do not need  
to earn much money. They may  
be supporting children and are  
sole heads of a household, but  
they’re “girls.” Also the single  
woman feels the salary  
discrimination. The trend in  
business seems to be that single  
women do not need to earn  
money! For more on women  
and job positions see BMR (No. 6  
April, 1974).  

The “girl mystique” includes  
the fact that “girls” cannot  
make decisions on their own.  
They present the problems,  
bring up the solutions, and the  
male bosses make the decisions.  
This of course frees the “girls”  
from having the responsibility of  
making a wrong (bad) decision!  
Heaven forbid! Of course it also  
frees them from making a right  
decision. Part of the mystique is  
saying that “girls” cannot make  
decisions, so why worry their  
little heads!  

Personal defense classes are  
being held every Thursday night  
at 7:30 p.m. downstairs in the  
Unitarian Church at 14th and  
Lafayette. Classes will continue  
through June. The instructors  
both hold high degrees in  
Taekwon-Do but will teach a  
variety of martial arts with  
emphasis on personal defense.  
They teach other self-defense  
classes in Denver. There will be a  
minimal but not mandatory fee  
for the purchase of mats and  
pine boards. The boards will be  
used at a party at the end of the  
course. All people welcome. The  
exercise that the class stresses  
really gets or keeps the body in  
shape in addition to increasing  
physical self-confidence.
