New Zealand Mice

In New Zealand during a re-
cent Miss New Zealand show,
unidentified women threw mice
on the stage. A letter by Sue
Neal in Broadsheet implores
...my sisters of: mice throw-
ing persuasion to throw a
stuffed facsimile or perhaps
you could throw them very
g-e.n.t.l.y... as one of
the mice died.

Boom

Ft. McNair (Washington D.C.)
houses the Industrial College
of the Armed Forces & the
National War Colleges and was
the site of the annual NATO
conference this month. A bomb
went off on the steps of the
War College blowing out wind-
ows and damaging the building.

15 minutes before the ex-
plosion UPI and the Pentagon
were notified about the ex-
plosion and a man spoke of US
imperialism, American bases
and Guatemala. The Army Crim-
inal Investigating Agency,
Washington police and the FBI
are checking it out. Lots of
luck fellows!

Bang

Two men broke into a Denver
woman's home and when they
saw her, they grabbed her.
She began to scream and reached
for her purse, pulling out
a .22 revolver. Her husband
rushed in and the intruder
turned to run; she shot him
in the neck. One escaped; one
hit, one woman alive.

y: And Poverty

A new report from the US
Civil Rights Commission says
that female-headed families
now make up nearly one half
of all families living in
poverty.

The report "A Growing
Crisis: Disadvantaged Women
and Their Children" charges
that the feminization of
poverty has been a problem
for some time but that "It
has not come to the correct
attention of the general pub-
lic."

The report says that the
number of poor families head-
ed by women rose by 54% be-
tween the years 1960 and 1981.
During those same years, the
numbers of families in pov—
erty which were headed by
white men decreased by 48%.

Training Oppression

The School of the Americas,
located in Ft. Gulick, Panama
is scheduled to close next
year. A US base that has tra-
ined 41,000 officers and sold-
iers from all over Latin Amer-
ica in everything from intel-
ligence gathering to commando
operations. The school has
helped develop a network of
personal relationships among
US and Latin American military
leaders such as Col. Gustavo
Alvarez Martinez, head of the
US backed Honduran Army, Gen.
Humberto Romero, Salvadoran
dictator overthrown in 1979,
and 369 members of the late dic-
tator Anastasio Somoza's
dread national guard.

Alternative sites being lo-
oked at are in Florida and
Puerto Rico, but the Army is
hoping to negotiate and remain
in Panama.

Angry Women

ANGRY WOMEN, a British group
has gas-bombed porn shops and
cinemas in and around Leeds,
as well as setting fire to two
video shops. The group became
known during the search for
the Yorkshire Ripper, a man
who raped and killed 13 women.
ANGRY WOMEN have attacked more

-Ross/BMR

than ten porn outlets.

Police efforts to find ANGRY
WOMEN have resulted in harass-
ment of feminists. They have
entered and destructively
searched at least one woman's
home, questioned women about
their lives and taken their
papers. (See Page 15)

Fight Back-Yah!

A 4 year old Buffalo, NY
girl wielding a rolling pin
and her 6 year old sister
armed with a butcher knife
attacked a man in their liv-
ing room who was sexually
molesting their 12 year old
sister. The man had snuck in-
to their house. When the
younger girls heard their
sister's muffled cries they
went into the kitchen and
armed themselves.

The youngest girl smacked
the guy on the head and stun-
ned him; when he tried to get
up again, she smacked him
again. The 6 year old began
waving the butcher knife and
the guy ran.

Union Rights Fight

The struggle of workers at
Dannon Yogurt in New Jersey
and New York continues in a
long term strike for basic
union rights. Since the walk-
out by Teamsters Local 584 on
January 7 all the workers
have been fired and locked
out by Dannon at the Queens
plant. Workers at the New
Jersey plant are facing daily
violence from scab drivers,
many of them are armed ex-
cops and literally riding
shotgun in Dannon delivery
trucks. There have been over
100 incidents of scab violence
and repeated arrests of str-
ikers for defending themselves
against the scabs. But the
strike is hurting Dannon's
sales--six area supermarket
chains have pulled the yogurt
off their shelves.

Reclassifying
Terror

The Food and Drug Administr-
ation (FDA), under pressure
from the American Psychiatric
Association, is considering
reclassifying electroshock
machines from Class 3 (high
risk) to Class 2 (low risk).

The FDA makes the distinc-
tion that shock treatment is
safe for people labeled sev-
erely depressed or schizo-
phrenic and unsafe for others.
To tell the FDA what you think
of their intent to reclassify,
write: Dockets Management
Branch (HFA-305), FDA, RM 4-
62, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rock-
ville, MD 20857. Deadline is
June 6, but write even if
you've missed their deadline.

Racist Busting

Twin Pines Savings and Loan,
Berkeley, CA is one of the
few such institutions under a
union contract. It was recent-
ly sold to Richard Meyer,
Southern California financier.
His first act as new boss was
to fire nine of the 16 memb-
ers of Office of Professional
Employees Union Local 29.

The majority fired were Black
women. The union has a picket
line and is asking people to
withdraw their money. Twin
Pines is losing a lot of cust-
omers, many of whom banked
there because it was union.

Our Bodies - Their $$

The National Center for
Health Statistics estimates
that in 1976 more than 794,000
women had some form of hyster-
ectomy in the US and an add-
itional 378,000 had their
ovaries and fallopian tubes
removed. Hysterectomies are
performed in the US three
times more often than in Eng-
land, four times more than in
Sweden where medical care is
paid by the state.

The ob-gyns in the US are
faced with a 50% decline in
the birth rate and are filling
the gap with hysterectomies.
At $1,500 to $2,000 a throw,
they are called hip-pocket
surgery; the only benefit is
in the doctor's wallet.

The number of hysterectomies
performed for women with med-
ical insurance is double that
for those who are uninsured.
Surgery should be considered
only when all other medical
alternatives have been ex-
plored.
