The general membership of  
the Women's Center Coalition  
has been presented with a  
statement of purpose and a  
proposed governing structure  
by its temporary coordinating  
committee. According to the  
statement of purpose the  
Women’s Center Coalition has  
as its purpose “to nurture and  
centralize the women's com-  
munity, especially that of the  
Denver area; to seek out and  
serve the cultural, educational,  
social, business, health  
and communication needs of  
women; to create and sustain  
a facility known as the Denver  
Women’s Center where these  
functions will be centralized.”

The proposed governing  
body of the Women’s Center  
is the center council which  
would be composed of a  
representative from each  
member organization and wo-  
men who do not associate  
themselves with any specific  
group or organization. The  
center council is seen as  
being the most potentially  
responsive process to receive  
input from all Coalition  
members and to generate  
active involvement; to foster  
the diversified interests, acti-  
vities, and philosophies of  
Coalition members; to avoid  
the use and/or abuse of power  
by any individual or group  
within the Coalition; and to  
prevent the polarization (cul-  
turally, socially or politically)  
of organizations and individu-  
als within the Denver Wo-  
men’s Center Coalition.”

The Women's Festival  
raised $400.00 after expenses  
for the Women’s Center. For a  
period of “six months this  
money will be held in a high  
interest savings account so  
that the Coalition has the time  
to get by-laws firmly written,  
to have itself well organized  
and soundly structured, and  
to raise additional money for  
the Women’s Center.

Any woman who wants to  
can become a participant in  
the policy making decisions  
of the Women's Center Coalition.  
In order for the Women’s  
Center to become a reality,  
the work of the Coalition must  
be the shared experience of all  
women.
