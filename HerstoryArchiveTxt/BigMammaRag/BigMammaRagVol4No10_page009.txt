case against Susan was fundamentally
based on the testimony of two par-
ticipants in the robbery. Robert
Valeri, the state's chief witness,
placed Susan in the bank with him
at the time of the robbery. Michael
Fleischer also testified that Susan
had been in on the planning of the
robbery.

Nancy Gertner, Susan's defense attor-
ney, was able to throw Valeri's testi-
mony into doubt by exposing how much he
had to gain by incriminating Susan.

In exchange for turning state's wit-
ness, Valeri received a manslaughter
charge instead of first degree murder.
He will only have to serve a ten year
sentence. Gertner also pointed out
that Valeri had been given a sub-
stantial amount of money from the Dis-
trict Attorney's office in order to set
up a leather shop inside prison.

Gertner also shed doubt on the validity
of Fleischer's testimony. Fleischer
has gotten off very easy in exchange
for being a witness. Since 1971
he has had eight counts of accessory
after the fact pending; he has never
been formally indicted nor has he gone
to trial. Even though he admitted in
court to having helped load guns into
cars, received an equal share of the
money ($500), and fled with the others,
he said he hopes to “come out of this
without a criminal record."

After the prosecution rested its
case, the defense decided not to
bring any witnesses to the stand.

The defense trusted the jury to see
the weakness of the prosecution's
case, and that the defense had shown
there was a "reasonable doubt" as to
Susan's involvement.

Although the judge, in his charge to
the jury, did not discuss the concept
of "reasonable doubt" at length and
emphasized instead the felony murder
law, the jury failed to convict.

Five years of pretrial media
blitzing of Susan Saxe could very
easily have resulted in her convic-
tion. The outcome of the trial can
be seen as a “moral” victory in the
sense that the defense proved to at
least one juror, if not more,
Susan's innocence on all the char-
ges.

However, Susan still faces a sec-
ond trial on the same charges with
a new set of jurors. While 76% of
the people in Boston felt Susan was
guilty before her trial, and the
post-trial media's belief in her
guilt, it will be next to impossible
for her to ever receive a “fair”
trial in this country.

Cookie RiDolfi, a defense team
member, said during the trial, “I
think it's real clear, and I hope
the jurors are seeing this, that
the government is out for Susan's
blood."

Even though the government lacks
solid evidence in its case against
Saxe, the odds for future acquittal
are heavily stacked against her.

We can offer our active support and
hope the next set of jurors will
see that Susan Saxe is on trial for
her politics and is not the “crazed”
bank robber the government would
have all of us believe.

The following is an interview
with two members of the Susan Saxe
defense team, Linda Backiel and
Cookie RiDolfi. The interview was
conducted by Kate Sharp and Eileen
Bresnahan during the second week
of the trial.

BMR: Why is it important that wo-
men support Susan Saxe? How does
her case relate to all women?
Linda: The best way to begin an-
swering that question is to read
two paragraphs from the statement
Susan read in court when she pled
guilty in the context of the gov-
ernment's laws. On June 9, 1975
Susan said:

Over the course of the last five
years, four and a half which have
been lived underground in America,
I, like many other women who came to
politics through socialist, anti-
racist, and anti-imperialist causes,
have changed, have grown, have
emerged a feminist. Like these
thousands of other sisters, I am no
longer content to be just one strong
woman fighting for a revolution
which, though it is just and nec-
essary, does not speak to my own
highest aspirations, my own most
personal and immediate needs. Over
the past five years I have emerged
a feminist, a lesbian, a woman-
identified woman. This was not a
"conversion," but a development, a
natural process that followed my
previous commitment, as day follows
night.

I, like many other women,
have emerged a feminist.

There have been many women through-
out herstory who have taken great
risks, put great faith and energy
into movements that spoke to our
liberation as workers, as poor peo-
ple, as members of every oppressed
race and class, as everything but
women. And while many of these
struggles have moved our people for-
ward, have improved our real lives
in concrete ways, and therefore, by
definition been in the interest of
women, no struggle but our own, in-
dependent of others, and just and
necessary in its own right can ever
hope to meet all our needs. We
have a right to this struggle, a
right to self-determination and
self-definition as women, for women;
a right to a new world of our own
creation.

Cookie: I think Susan answers it
really well in those few paragraphs.
I connect very deeply with every
word she has said about the struggle
of women as a class. I feel a great
deal of strength identifying myself
with Susan and other women who feel
that commitment.

Linda: Susan has a very broad defin-
ition of what struggle is. It's not
a narrow, self-serving definition;
it serves the interest of all people
who are oppressed and all people
who are fighting for liberation.

It challenges us to think about the
ways in which all the liberation
struggles going on in the world re-
late to each other and support
each other. Susan is important to
women because she gives us strength,
insight, courage and energy.

Cookie: Susan has been highlighted
by the press, of course, but she is
not unique or alone in her position.
There are many people around who
have developed politically much in
the same way and have now come to a
place where we feel the positions of
the "male Left" are inadequate to
meet our needs as women. I feel
today that a narrow definition of
feminism can't do that either. It's
real inspiring to know there are
many women who are willing to put
those beliefs together and work
from that position.

BMR: How does the issue of col-
laboration relate to this case?

Cookie: Susan has been obvious all
along in her actions and decisions
that she will not collaborate with
the government, she will not give
them anything, she will not talk
against anyone or compromise her
politics for any favors. It's real
clear in this case because those who
have been cooperating with the gov-
ernment are getting very, very gen-
erous favors, and Susan will have
nothing to do with those favors.
It's real inspiring to work with
her because at every point a deci-
sion has to be made about her case,
she rationalizes how it will affect
the larger community, how it will
affect her own politics, and how
consistent she's been.

BMR: This is really different from
the ways Jane Alpert has acted in
the past. Would one of you like to
say something about the comparison?
Linda: I think Susan and Jane see
their own politics in very differ-
ent ways. Susan's statement when
she pled guilty in Philadelphia made
that very clear. She said, "My
feminism does not drive me into the
arms of the state but even further
from it," and for Susan, feminism
is a challenge to the state. Jane's
theory is that she was misled and
misguided when, in the late sixties
and early seventies, she was involv-
ed in actions against the state.
Jane's position now seems to be that
it's not any business of women what
the state is doing. These two dif-
ferent kinds of politics lead people
in very different directions. Jane's
actions now imply, if they don't
say explicitly, that in order to
be free, and be on the street, she
will betray her sisters and brothers
in struggle.

BMR: Aside from the security mea-
sures being taken at the courthouse,
do you feel this trial is being
treated like a political trial?
Cookie: We're treating it like a
political trial. However, the gov-
ernment wants to talk out of both
sides of its mouth by saying in the
courtroom that this is not a politi-
cal trial. This is just an ordinary
bank robbery/murder trial. If you
look at the ten most wanted list,
how many people who are wanted for
bank robbery are on the list? The
security measures are interesting.
The measures hit every newspaper
the week before the trial so that
all the jurors were sure to see it.
When we finally got to the court-
house, they were visually very im-
pressive, but I think it was really
more of a stage prop. They are
really into painting Susan as this
crazy person, who, if left out on the
street, will endanger every person
in Boston, every person in this
country. It is definitely a poli-
tical trial.

Linda: It's real significant that
the government's way of using
Susan's politics against her is
subliminal. They are afraid to al-
low it to come out in the courtroom.
Robert Valeri, who was recently on
the stand in the trial against
William Gilday, was asked questions
by this same prosecutor to bring
out the fact that the people who are
accused of being involved in the
robbery were very active politically
and considered themselves revolu-
tionaries. In 1976, he’s making
sure that none of this information
comes out in the court. Instead,
he is prejudicing the jurors ahead
of time and instilling in them a
fear of Susan, without giving them
the political rationale. He is
thwarting all our efforts to get
the jury to deal with the politics
inherent in the case.

He is thwarting all our
efforts to get the jury
to deal with the politics.

Cookie: This judge is the same one
who tried William Gilday and has been
on this case for six years. It's his
last major trial. I think he has a lot
invested in this case so it's more a
personal vendetta than a strict, objec-
tive bench position.

Linda: This judge is not dumb - he
knows how to keep most of his rulings
within legal boundaries, so that if
she's convicted, he's not going to give
us the kind of error that would entitle
Susan to have the conviction overturned.

He also knows how to make the jury feel
that he is a fair, nice, impartial,
sweet old man. That puts us at an enor-
mous disadvantage.

BMR: We understand the prosecution
made an attempt to ban Byrna Aronson,
a member of the defense team, from
the courtroom. Could you tell us
what was behind the attempt?
Linda: Byrna was barred from the
courtroom by a simple procedural
mechanism: the District Attorney
subpoenaed her as a witness in the
prosecution's case against Susan
Saxe. I think he had two things in
mind when he subpoenaed her. Know-
ing Byrna is Susan's lover, he tre-
mendously enjoyed the power he had
to put Byrna in the ludicrous posi-
tion of appearing as a witness
against Susan, or at least to make
it look like Byrna would be a wit-
ness. He also subpoenaed Byrna
because he knew that all the wit-
nesses were going to be kept out of
the courtroom and not allowed to
hear each other's testimony. He
used this device to hamper the legal
efforts on behalf of Susan and to
deprive her, and everyone, of a
really important source of moral
support during the course of the
trial. We had to file a whole
separate set of motions and argue
to lift the order keeping Byrna
out of the courtroom. The judge
allowed her back in, but refused
to agree that the subpoena was
purely harassment, so it is con-
ceivable that Byrna could be called
by the prosecution to testify
against Susan. Of course, she
wouldn't.

Susan’s treatment as a
prisoner is typical of that
of many prisoners.

BMR: Is there anything else you
would like to say about the way
Judge McLaughlin has been handling
this case?

Cookie: This judge is the same one
who tried William Gilday and has
been on this case for six years. It's
his last major trial. I think he
has a lot invested in this case so
it's more a personal vendetta than
a strict, objective bench position.
Linda: This judge is not dumb—he
knows how to keep most of his rulings
within legal boundaries, so that if
she's convicted, he’s not going to
give us the kind of error that would
entitle Susan to have the conviction
overturned. He also knows how to
make the jury feel that he is a fair,
nice, impartial, sweet old man.

That puts us at an enormous disad-
vantage.

BMR: How is Susan doing emotionally
and physically? When we've seen her
during the trial she's looked very
strong, very confident.

Cookie: I would say under the over-
whelming circumstances she's doing
very well. She's a very strong woman,
but physically I think it's taken
its toll on her; she hasn't seen the
sun in 4 months, so she’s sure had some
very hard days. It's difficult to
sit in court and hear someone you've
known and trusted talk against you;
doing what the government asks just
to save their skin. It's hard
because it attacks your own feel-
ings of hope; it goes directly
against everything Susan represents.
Linda: I also think it's real impor-
tant not to mystify Susan because
she is in jail. That's something
Susan says herself. When you ask how
she is holding up and what the jail-
ing conditions are like, it's impor-
tant to realize that there is just
one significant thing about being in
jail - you don't have your freedom
and freedom is a precondition for
people existing in a natural, good
and healthy way. Susan is suffering
from not having her freedom, and
she suffers in exactly the same ways
and all ways every other prisoner is
suffering. Susan has been moved from
prison to prison with no notice at
all. She's woken up with mice run-
ning across her face; she's been
deliberately deprived of sleep to
the point where it's a real form of
torture. These things are very dis-
orienting, horrible experiences. But
that's not because she's Susan Saxe;
it's because she's a person who has
been deprived of her freedom by the
state. Her treatment as a prisoner
is fairly typical of that of many
prisoners.

BMR: Susan seems to have a lot of
support both in Boston and Philadel-
phia, which has not always been the
case with other women in similar
trouble with the state. How has this
support come into being?

Linda: In Philadelphia, people came
together the day after Susan was
arrested wanting to know what could
be done to support her, because she
was arrested in Philadelphia. Some
of those reasons were very personal.
In Boston, people came together be-
cause of Susan's politics being
very dear to many people's hearts.
Susan has raised many of the impor-
tant issues of the last two decades
in very intense ways, and the support
around Susan has been very intense.
