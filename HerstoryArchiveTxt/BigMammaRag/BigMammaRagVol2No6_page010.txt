Virginia Neal Blue Resource  
Centers For Colorado Women

These centers were established  
by the Colorado Commission on  
the Status of Women. The  
administrative headquarters  
opened in February 1972 and  
since that time branches have  
been opened in Alamosa,  
Colorado Springs, Denver,  
Grand Junction and Pueblo.  
Each center serves women of all  

ages and all economic  
backgrounds from the local  
community, and the  

administrative headquarters  
coordinates the work of the  
branch centers to provide for an  
effective state-wide effort on  
behalf of the women of  
Colorado. The centers provide  
services free of charge and are  
non-profit, tax-exempt and  
funded by contributions from  
individuals and organizations  
who are interested in and  
concerned about the special  
needs of women. For more

Women in the Arts

Formed by Arlene Green and  
Janet McLaughlin of Women's  
Transition House, this group is  
open to women at all levels of  
serious artistic interest. The  
group’s immediate goal is to  
organize a spring show and a  
long-range goal is to rent space  
for a Women’s Art Center,  
which would function as a  
gallery and as a place to hold  
workshops in visual and  
performing arts. If you are  
interested in getting your work  
shown (and sold), interested in  
setting up a Women’s Art  
Center, or just interested in  
talking about what it means to  
be a woman and an artist, come  
to a meeting, Tuesday at 8 p.m.,  
1895 Lafayette. Or call Janet  
McLaughlin, 255-2435, or Kim

Woman in the World

This is an eight-week course (2  
credits) which is offered at Women's Radio  
Loretto Heights every spring.  
The course provides the  
opportunity for analyzing  
societal expectations of women,  
and for understanding the  
historical, psychological,  
sociological, and educational  
aspects of these expectations.  
The course content includes an  
investigation of the myths and  
realities of being a woman in the  
1970s and identifies the new  
behavioral patterns and lifestyles  
that are emerging. Guest  
speakers, films, readings,  
research reports, and discussion  
constitute the resources for the  
course.

exaggerated reputation for  
injuries and vicious play, Aspen  
women were at first cautious  
about joining the team. Teams  
from CU and CSU met the  
Aspen women at the Aspen  
Ruggerfest in October. Further

Womanpower, Inc.

This organization is set up  
as a non-profit corporation to  
help find jobs for women. Our  
office at 2475 Broadway, No. 12  
in Boulder is open from 12:00  
noon to 4:00 p.m. for interviews.  
We ask that our clients  
telephone for an appointment  
and we spend at least half an  
hour talking to each woman  
who comes in. We charge no fee  
and are funded by interested  
institutions and businesses. We  
may be reached at 442-5468.

We have made an attempt to  
contact as many women's  
organizations as possible, but of  
course we could not reach every  
group in Colorado. We especially  
want to hear from feminists all  
over the state, but we are willing  
to publicize any group whose  
function is beneficial to women.  
If your organization would like  
to be represented in next  
month’s issue please feel free to  
call or write the BMR  
office.
