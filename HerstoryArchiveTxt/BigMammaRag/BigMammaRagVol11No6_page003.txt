Priorities  
Dear BHR,

After the headline, "Know-  
ledge of the Right, of Fac-  
ism, Must Take Us into Poli-  
tical Activism", Lori's arti-  
cle came as something of a  
letdown to me. Since I'm al-  
ways looking for someone who  
has all the answers, I hoped  
this was going to be the wo-  
men's movement's new plan of  
action. Of course it isn't up  
to Lori or any other indivi-  
dual woman to resolve that  
question, but I feel such a  

need for the women's movement  
to be more committed to act—  

ing on the issues that affect  
our lives in a way that sees  
imperialism as our enemy and  
that allies us with all those  
who struggle to destroy it.  
In my own life, I am torn be-  
tween creating a protective  
woman-oriented shell in the  
midst of global chaos or tak-  
ing on the whole monster in  

a way that leaves me out  

of touch with the reality of  
my day-to-day struggles as a  
woman. I'm searching for more  
clarity and more commitment.

I do wish Lori's article  
had probed more deeply into  
the implications of her re-  
search. Given that the police  
play the role she describes,  
what does that mean for our  
work? Should we organize a-  
gainst police recruitment of  
women and expose their sham  
commitment to affirmative  
action? Should we act in so-  
lidarity with the Third  
World communities fighting  
back against the police mur-  
ders Lori listed? Do we need  
to develop clearer strategies  
in anti-rape and battering  
work that don't rely on the  
cops for protection and leg-  
itimacy? Can we break down  
some of our illusions and  
deepen our understanding that  
the enforcers of the state  
are our enemies who will only  
finally be defeated when  
the whole system is destroyed?  
The police are only one issue  
and the questions facing us  
are countless.

Lori is right that we can  

not turn away from what's go-  
ing on in the world as if it  

doesn't concern us. We need  
to make it our business to  
know and to act. Here in San  
Francisco, at an Internation-  
al Women's Day program hun-  
dreds of women cheered a  
speech calling for a women's  
movement in solidarity with  
the Palestinian people, but  

a few weeks later only doz-  
ens showed up for a women's  
demo supporting Palestine and  
condemning anti-Semitism. Un-  
fortunately, this isn't an  
isolated phenomenon. It's  
great that thousands of wo-  
men gather for women's music  
festivals, but where are the  
numbers and energy to fight  
CIA intervention in Nicara-  
gua, recruiting women into  
the KKK, the right's assaults  
on our bodies and sexuality?  
We do some of this work, but  
not nearly enough to meet the  
challenge. What makes us  
think we can afford not to  
build a fighting, active  
movement against an enemy  
that stretches from Indian  
villages in Guatemala to the  
front door of our local a-  
bortion clinic? Has the rel-  
ative comfort of life in  
America made the oppression  
Lori documents tolerable to  
us or are our priorities  
badly in need of change? I  
ask these questions of both  
myself and the women's move-  
ment. The example of women  
around the world shows we  

have a long way to go. Lori's  
article is just a step in  
developing politics that  

make sense out of the mess  
that imperialism and male  
supremacy surround us with  
and in internalizing our  
responsibilities to act now  
to change what we can.

Informants

Dear Mama,

This is an open letter to  
sisters everywhere, but espe-  
cially those at the Perryville  
Prison in Arizona.

On March 16, 1983 eight (8)  
women were placed in lock-up  
for being a "threat to the se-  
curity of the institution."  
They used an informant.

First off, do all of you  
realize what this means? It  
means that anyone can run up  
and tell the administration  
anything and get others slam-  
med. It means we are all sub-  
ject to have this happen to  
us. It means that some "sis-  
ters" have little or no res-  
pect for themselves or others.  
It means that these "sisters"  
are losing contact with the  
fact they are convicts, or  
supposed to be. We're all  
here together, and as sad as  
it is for me to have to say  
it, our brothers in prison  
live with more respect for  
themselves and each other than  

the women ever have.

The brothers don't snitch  
each other off on a daily ba-  
sis and soon those that do  
are self-conscious enough not  
to flaunt it. And they're usu-  
ally dealt with and placed in  
protective custody. Granted  
society has made women out to  
be weak, but does it have to  
be proven?

How many reading this let-  
ter are in institutions where  
protective custody inmates  
(or those you know should be)  
are allowed to be in popula-  
tion? Do you realize that this  
is a set-up by the Administra-  
tion? Touch one of them and  
you're slammed. It doesn't  
matter if they swing first!  
The administration has a duty  
to protect them, but they are  
also responsible for the wel-  
fare of the rest of the prison  
population. When they put the  
inmates on the yard they are  
obviously disregarding their  
responsibility to the popula-  
tion. They're subjecting us  
to prisoners who can...fight  
with us, taunt us, in essence  
do as they please to us, with  
the complete assurance that  
Admin. would never take action  
against them.

How many of you are in in-  
stitutions where "confiden-  
tial informants" are used re-  
gularly? These informants get  
you slammed faster than staff  
do. Which only means that  
both administration and these  
inmates have lost touch with  
who is employed and who is  
being forced to give up years  
out of their life to the sys-  
tem.

For those of you reading  
this who have turned on your  
sisters take a look at what  
you're doing. Don't lose con-  
tact with what the system has  
done to you. You may gain  
some advantages by doing it  
but in the long run the same  
people who have used you will  
turn you over to the very  
women whom you've hurt.

And for the women who re-  
main strong let the adminis-  
tration know that you're not  

blind to what they're doing.  
Have your families, friends,  
relatives, ask by writing or  
calling why they're subject-  
ing you to conditions which  
could adversely affect you.  
Why they are subjecting you  
to inmates who could hurt you  
and be protected for it. Why  
P.C. units aren't utilized  
for their protection and your  
welfare. We are prisoners in  
this system but that doesn't  
give our cagers the right to  
pit us against each other for  

their entertainment. We are  
human beings with feelings,  
emotions, and opinions which  
have already been suppressed  
by virtue of incarceration.  
Now it's time to make our-  
selves heard through those  
that care about us and our  
own voices.

A Sister in Struggle.

PSOE

Dear Sisters,

The Socialist Spanish Party,  
in political power since Octo-  
ber 28th last year, has appro-

+ Danger of the pregnant wo-  
man's life.
