Stop the World,  
We Want to Get On

Don’t be fooled by the clever ti-  
tle; it disguises a pitiful little  
book by two traditional, subur-  
ban homemakers. After sticking  
their heads partially out the  
kitchen door, by writing and  
publishing a cookbook, they dis-  
covered other homemakers  
wistfully looking for a broader  
horizon, too. This book is about  
women “doing something”; to  
give women confidence to seek  
out something to fill that last  
period of life. “We wish to have  
control over our own lives after  
our roles of wife and mother are  
fulfilled.” (The italics are mine)  
“We want to become people in  
our own right.”  

It's too easy to have contempt  
for them — these well-to-do,  
forty-year-old innocents. But  
these are our sisters, too, caught  
in the traditional web that socie-  
ty wove for them.  

Because of this book, the  
authors were forced to read  
about what had been going on in  
the world. “We were amazed  
that so much had been written  
on the subject of women and  
that we had been completely ig-  
norant of most of the material.”  
Because much of it wasn’t  
available in suburbia, they  
bought a shopping bag full of  
paperbacks in New York — and  
the bag broke on the commuting  
train. “We were absolutely mor-  
tified, and we both blushed crim-  
son.” One can imagine the  
humiliation of being associated  
with such obscenities as  
Sisterhood is Powerful, Sexual  
Politics, and A Natural Superiority  
of Women. (No, frankly, one  
really can't.)  

They were poorly equipped to  
write a one-chapter history of  
women, it's not surprising they  
did such a bad job of it. A state-  
ment like “Society has  
historically expected very little  
from women outside of their  
natural destiny as wife and  
mother” makes it look like they  
didn't study those books they  
bought.  

Programmed  

Maybe these are really the  
Stepford Wives, programmed to  
believe the myths of Marriage Is  
the Ultimate Career, the  
Woman's Place Is in the Home,  
and Family Comes First, bound  
by their marriage contracts in a  
land without death, depression  

or divorce (only one divorce was  
mentioned among all the “doing  
something” women inter-  
viewed). They had no economic  
need of a job, so there was never  
a real and total commitment to  
work — in fact, one woman  
backed off when her work  
threatened to turn into a full-  
time, successful business. So  
the work is usually of the dilettante  
type: designing  
needlepoint, making candies,  
writing a cookbook; part-time;  
and usually done at home, not at  
an office.  

Sometimes the “success  
story” means getting an impor-  
tant volunteer, no-pay job, like a  
three-year commitment to  
bookkeeper for a hospital aux-  
iliary shop. All of the women are  
great volunteers, because  
“community involvement fulfills  
her need to feel useful through  
serving others.”  

As if these women weren't  
already the best little-old ser-  
vants around! Family Comes  
First is repeated again and  
again; fear of “upsetting the  
delicate balance of family har-  
mony”; the pride in making “a  
superhuman effort not to disrupt  
anyone's routine and juggled all  
my commitments around the  
family’s needs.” Only one of The  
Stepford Wives mentioned that  
there was a slight rearrange-  
ment of home duties because  
she was a full-time student; the  
others do it all, both jobs, with no  

idea that it might, or could, or  
should, be otherwise since they  
are adding to the family income.  

This is probably because all of  
the women interviewed are so  
grateful that their husbands  
have permitted them to work.  
Well, not all of the husbands:  
one woman took a real estate  
course, passed the state board  
exam and had a job waiting for  
her, but “Unfortunately I wasn’t  
listening to his (Peter’s) need to  
be the sole provider... “Of  
course she didn't take the job.  
“Perhaps in a few years...  
another job will come along...”  
Another husband did not want  
his gifted artist wife to exhibit or  
sell her paintings. “I realized...  
that John wanted me all to  
himself.”  

“Those dabblings” -  

John, incidentally, called her  
paintings “those dabblings”; Bill  
was amazed there was a market  
for his wife's handiwork, “that  
stuff in the corner”; while Ed  
was “amused” that his wife  
could teach a cooking class.  

This may help explain the sad  
lack of self-confidence that is the  
dominant characteristic of all  
the women in the book. They  
don’t think they or their talents  

are worth anything, and the  
thought of being paid  
precipitates a crisis: the woman  
with the trained voice who sings  
solos for free is paralyzed with  
fright at the thought of singing  
for money; sheer dithering terror  
grips the woman who offers her  
handmade flowers for sale to a  
department store, though the  
charity bazaars have snapped  
them up. “Confidence is essen-  
tial to take the first step beyond  
the safety of home and family”,  
“It takes a good deal of self-  
confidence to register for that  
first class”, and Confidence is a  
fleeting thing nobody  
listens.  

Admittedly, these women in  
their domestic cocoons are “out  
of touch, out of training and out  
of demand” with the business  
world. Yet they lack confidence  
in the skills and abilities they do  
have. It’s hard to garner con-  
fidence when you get no respect  
from society, your family,  
yourself, for the job of  
“housewife.” So little do the  
authors regard themselves as  
real people apart from their role  
that the woman the book is  
written for and about is called  
“mother.”  

Stop the World, I Want to Get  
On is almost a case book of the  
traditional wife fulfilling her  
proper, predestined role. But  
she, too, feels the need for  
something more; she has started  
dabbling in the business world  
through things she can make in  
her kitchen or family room, so  
she doesn’t need to leave home.  

First Step  

Authors Reed and Pfaltz have  
taken the first step. They have  
taken a second step, too; they  
even attended an all-day NOW  
convocation — as mind-boggling  
an experience for them as this  
book is for most of us. Their con-  
sciousness was raised “one  
hundred fold” to women’s posi-  
tion in society. We can do no  
less: to try to understand, to  
help, to love women like this.  
Economically these women  
have everything, but they have  
no respect — from themselves or  
others. The authors end with a  
revealing anecdote, a “great  
compliment” they cherish from  
a publicity person at a store  
where they put on cooking  
demonstrations: “The women  
enjoy you two best... After all,  
you aren’t really anybody.”  

We know that each of us is an  
important, valuable person. It's  

important that we spread that  
message to all women; to all  
people.  

As a book, this doesn't deserve  
reviewing — in fact, I almost  
didn't finish it. Then I realized  
the book was important in help-  
ing us better understand “the  
other woman” — the housewife  
(which is what they call  
themselves).

Feminist contributions in  
terms of the novel have been  
relatively meager in comparison  
to the outpouring of poetry.  
Already there is a Plath or Rich  
or Grahn tradition in verse. Yet  
in terms of fiction some vision  
has been lacking — and that is  
really where the novel can offer  
us so much. It is when we as  
women see ourselves as more  
than stick figures, when we  
sense our role in the whole  
scheme of history that the novel  
will become a powerful force in  
the welding of our woman's vi-  
sion. It is this sense that comes  
through the pages of Riverfinger  
Woman.  

Inez Riverfinger, the central  
character, at first does not  
appear to be a character we can  
identify with. She is young and  
absurd, into the Bleeker Street  
drug scene of the late 60's, and  
seemingly not a feminist. As this  
teenage woman in boarding  
school awkwardly reaches out  
for her first lover, however, and  
relates her fantasies and  
dreams, her stature grows. She  
becomes part of the Family of  
Women.  

The Riverfinger lineage which  
includes Abby Riverfinger,  
Natasha Riverfinger, Eulalee  
Riverfinger, and Naomi River-  
finger serve as more than com-  
panion characters to Inez’s  
story. They give us verification, a  
common heritage and are part of  
that incredible dance of the self.  
For the women are exploring  
with their lives — yes, even their  
fingers — into the essence that  
is woman: in her flows, inside  
where the juices of our lives are  
journey, not mere probing as in  
male novels which see us as ob-  
jects or background to their own  
journeys. Pornography versus  
art.  

Elana Nachman has a keen  
sense of women “hammering”  
themselves into identifiable  
shapes. Inez says to herself at  
one point in the novel, typical for

its mixture of humor and irony:  

“I have been a secretary, folded  
lingerie in department stores, been a  
short order cook, dope peddler and  
thief, but I have never written a novel  
before: start where the tap is run-  
ning and proceed. Invent, imagine,  
saw apart the lady in the big pine  
box! You have the power, yours the  
keys, do away with dead wood, bring  
back your dreams, come on kid, we  
know you can. Endings, middles,  
finish lines, pass go, shuffle on along  
to Buffalo.”  

Nothing short of the need to  
reinvent ourselves.  

Inez, for all her youth, realizes  
the emotional depth that two  
women, however immature, are  
capable of sharing. In the blend  
of narrative and poetry are  
scattered letters to and from a  
Committee, the straight world  
investigating this outlaw, which  
perhaps senses in the vaguest  
way what she means when she  
explains that this suspect book  
she is writing is no less than “a  
creative act of will.” As the river  
has warned her earlier:  

“There are dangerous men on the  
other side, who will capture you and  
dress you in ridiculous skirts and  
charge a price for your dancing and  
make you eat flesh.”  

When Inez insists there must  
be other kinds of people, the  
River replies:  

“There is. There is another kind  
that walks, called women, but they  
are mostly afraid — afraid of each  
other and the men and of what the  
men tell them. Among them are  
some who aren't afraid, who are try-  
ing to know something different, but  
they are outlaws and in hiding...”  

The Committee, convinced of  
their own myth that queers are  
just disturbed, that what Inez is  
writing must be trash, and that,  
really, she is only going through  
post-adolescent fantasies,  
decide to forget the whole thing.  

Like the Committee, some  
women may be convinced that  
there are not more obvious signs  
of revolutionary consciousness.  
There are no overt radical  
feminist politics, no party line —  
yet to miss what is here is to bring  
to this novel old expectations  
about linear statement. Inez fully  
understands why it is important  
to know everything there is to  
know about women. Through  
her, Nachman shows the  

relationship between the small  
details of our private lives and  
the sense of ourselves as vital,  
active beings in history. This is  
art raised to the fullest level of  
consciousness. “It is about time  
for full women in the world.”
