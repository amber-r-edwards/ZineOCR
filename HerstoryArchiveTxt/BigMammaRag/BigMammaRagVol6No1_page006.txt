ERA Boycott Effective

A boycott of convention centers in  
states which have not ratified the ERA  
is beginning to result in millions of  
dollars of lost revenue to several U.S.  
cities.

Almost 50 organizations have decided  
not to hold conventions in the 15 non-  
ratifying states, and their number is  
growing. Earlier this month the Chicago  
Convention and Tourism Bureau announced  
that the refusal of the National Educa-  
tion Association, American Psychologi-  
cal Association and others to convene  
in Chicago represented “an economic im-  
pact of $15 million and $750,000 in  
state and local tax revenues." The  
bureau's board of directors, alarmed by  
the projected loss of income, adopted  
a resolution urging the Illinois state  
legislature to ratify the ERA.

Other major convention centers are  
reporting a similar squeeze. Miami  
Beach will lose $9 million, Atlanta  
$6 million and New Orleans $8.7 million  
in convention business.

Union Boards Exclude

There are no women on the top AFL-CIO  
Executive Council. This is a "private  
embarrassment" to George Meany accord-  
ing to the New York Times. Also the  
new president of the International  
Ladies Garment Workers Union is “em-  
barrassed" because there is only one  
woman on that union's executive board,  
although 80% of the 405,000 members are  
women.

The Fetus Business

While HEW (Health, Education and  
Welfare Department) is busy trying to  
cut off access to abortions for poor  
women in the U.S., another department  
of the government has plunged into the  
fetus import business in a big way.

So far the Pentagon has imported  
45,000 human fetuses from South Korea  
for the purpose of testing the effects  
of the neutron bomb on fresh human  
tissue.

A visiting executive of the South  
Korean Red Cross has confirmed the  
report of the fetuses but has cautioned  
that an investigation within Korean  
President Park Chung Hee's authorit-  
arian state would be "quite  
impossible".

Ruling Class v Bakke

Allan Bakke, the man who is alleging  
reverse discrimination in his applica-  
tion to a California medical school,  

was probably squeezed out of his potential  

spot not by minority group members,  
but by the sons of the rich.

At least five white applicants from  
influential families who ranked lower  
than Bakke were admitted. One of these  
preferred applicants had not even filed  
an admissions application; the Dean  
intervened and requested that he be  
admitted. This student was the son of  
an important California legislator.

Wealthy students are commonly given  
preference applying to medical school.  
For example, in 1973 the Chicago Med-  
ical School collected an average of  
$50,000 in contributions from relatives  
and friends of 77 of its 91 first year  
students.

This type of admission practice was  
a crucial reason the California Univ-  
ersity did not go into a strong argu-  
ment in opposition to Bakke's suit;  
they did not want to be embarrassed by  
their unequal treatment of applicants.

Chemical Food

A warning: the next time you buy a  
"cherry" pie or soda, remember that  
there are 13 different chemicals that  
go into the flavor "cherry".

In all, 1,500 different chemical  
compounds flavor nearly all our food.  
"Before long," warns Mother Jones mag-

“instead of chemicals being the addi-  
tives, they will be the food."

Lesbian Mother Fights

A San Francisco lesbian mother has  
lost custody of her two children.

After two exhausting court hearings, the  
brutal removal of her youngest child  
without warning, betrayal by her family  
and harsh courtroom probings into the  
most intimate details of her life,  
Jeanne Jullion awaits her third and  
final courtroom confrontation scheduled  
for late fall.

To the anger of the judge who presided  
over her case, she has moved from isol-  
ation to organizing with the help of  
her attorney and a defense committee.  
Their efforts at publicizing her plight  
have produced a broadly based support  
group that includes politicians, unions,  
churches and gay organizations. The  
judge has threatened to place her in  
contempt of court for going to the  
public, but Jeanne continues to make  
herself available to the media and  
gay rights organizations.

The case is solely based on Jeanne's  
lesbianism.  
Her costs are expected to exceed $15,000. Please send mo-  
ney to the Jeanne Jullion Defense Fund

A Natural Way

If Indian women in the northwest  
province of Rajasthan don't want to  
get pregnant, they take dried carrot  
seeds for several days after coitus.

Zoologists at the Rajasthan University  
tested an extract of the seeds on  
mice and found it to be a mice contra-  
ceptive. They believe a substance in  
the seeds prevents the fertilized egg  
from embedding itself in the mucous  
membrane of the uterus.

Judge Gets His

An Alabama Judge has been convicted  
of soliciting sex from women scheduled  
to be tried in his court.

Judge Thomas McDonald was convicted  
on bribery charges after a Huntsville,  
Alabama jury heard testimony from  
Myra Braidfoot. Braidfoot testified  
that the judge asked her for sexual  
favors and promised to “maybe take  
care" of the charges against her, if  
she would meet him in a nearby motel.  
Four other witnesses also told the  
court the judge had asked them for sex  
in exchange for more lenient treatment  
in court.

The Supreme Court let stand lower  

court rulings which upheld Judge Mc-  

Donald's three-year jail sentence for  

bribery.

More On Tampons

To those of you who have wondered  
about our Hot Brief about Tampons caus-  
ing cancer, we learned this information  
from Feminist Communications. You can  
write them at 4003 Wabash Ave, San  
Diego, California 92104. They published  
a short article on this in a summer  
issue of their paper.

Gay Tax Protest

The tax money of gay people has been  
used to subsidize heterosexist instit-  
utions which oppress us. Churches,  
synagogues and their property are all  
tax exempt and we pay for the govern-  
ment services they use for free.

There is a Gay Tax Protest in the  
style of the "Boston Tea Party" current-  
ly going on. Mail a tea bag to your  
representatives in Congress or to the  
IRS protesting discriminatory treatment  
of homosexual taxpayers. For further

Please, Doc!

More than 31% of the patients visi-  
ting doctors' offices in 1975 spent  
only 6-10 minutes with the doctor,  
says a study by the National Center  
for Health Statistics.

Also nearly 27% had face-to-face en-  
counters of only 11-15 minutes, while  
1.2% spent no time at all with the doc-  
tor.

ANOTHER DEDICATED DOCTOR

Whose Needs Count?

The practice of inducing delivery  
through drug injection or caesarian op-  
eration before natural labor occurs is  
on the rise in the U.S. But this prac-  
tice may be responsible for a high in-  
cidence of serious breathing difficul-  
ties, abnormal growth and development  
and later mental and physical deficien-  
cies in babies born prematurely.

Dr. Howard McQuarrie, author of a  
journal report of the AMA says that the  
incidence of caesarian operations has  
doubled in the U.S. in the last ten  
years. Early deliveries are sometimes  
requested by mothers, but more often  
are ordered for the doctor's conven-  
ience, medical rights activists charge,  
even when no medical reason exists for  
cutting short the delivery period.

Rights Stashed

Have you filed a sex discrimination  
complaint under Title IX of the 1972  
Education Act but gotten no response?  
If so, your letter was probably among  

the hundreds of complaints and inquiries  

found stashed away in an unused room at  
HEW headquarters (Health, Education and  
Welfare).

A survey conducted by NOW's Project  
on Equal Education Rights (PEER) which  
traced every case filed with the  
Office for Civil Rights from 1972-1976,  
shows that the federal government has  
widely ignored sex discrimination  
charges, delayed investigations and  
stopped short of enforcing penalties  
even when discrimination was confirmed.

Feminist Writers Unite

Women writers nationwide are found-  
ing the first union of feminist writ-  
ers. The organization called the  
Feminist Writers’ Guild is both a pol-  
itical and a service group dedicated  
to the growth of community among fem-  
inist writers.

The Guild plans to ensure that fem-  
inist books get fair coverage, unbias-  
ed reviews, and good distribution,  
whether published by independent or  
establishment presses. The Guild is  
also hoping to put grassroots feminist  
writers' groups into contact with each  
other and break down the isolation of  
women writers.

Dues are $10 per year ($5 for unem-  
ployed). The file of feminist editors,  
agents and presses also needs local  
contributions. Write Feminist Writers‘  
Guild, P.O. Box 9396, Berkeley, Ca.

Token Payment

In 1974 the Ohio legislature passed  
a law allowing damage suits by victims  
against rapists. The law has just been  
tested in a Cleveland court and a wo-  
man was awarded $22,000. The woman  
had sought $150,000 because she had  
been forced to close her dance school,

W. German Terrorism

On November 12, Ingrid Schubert be-  
came the fourth woman among the 94 West  
Germans imprisoned for alleged terror-  
ism to die under mysterious circum-  
stances while in jail. Prison offic-  
ials claimed that Schubert, who was  
serving a 13-year sentence for aiding  
fugitives, hanged herself in her cell.  
Her lawyer says that she was hanged  
as part of a massive retaliation ag-  
ainst alleged terrorism in Germany.

Two other women, Gudrun Ensslin and  
Ulrike Meinhof, also have allegedly  
committed suicide in their cells in  
separate incidents over the last two  
years. A third, Katherina Hammersmith  
died of cancer after prison authorities  
delayed acting on her requests for  
medical attention.

Meanwhile the West German government  
is investigating at least 550 people  
on suspicion of terrorism. One owner  
of a bookstore which sold some radical  
literature has been convicted of "aid-  
ing the spread of terrorism", while the  
real terrorists, the ex-Nazis, who run  
the government go free.

A women's group at Yale University  
has collected more than 12,000 signa-  
tures from students, faculty, and Yale  
staff members demanding that the Univer-  
sity do something about the sexual  
harassment of its women students.

The petitions ask that the university  
set up an adequate grievance procedure  
to investigate the alleged sexual har-  
assment and take appropriate action.

The signatures were collected in the  
wake of a suit filed by four women stu-  
dents at Yale. The women complained  
that they were subjected to repeated  
sexual advances and sexual bribery by  
male professors. The university has  
denied that harassment of women students  
in exchange for grades is a problem at  
Yale.
