Creating

Breeze

Once upon a time there was  
a woman, RJ, who had never  
had a "real" job, having been  
able to work only when her  
children were in school, not  
out of school because of  

organizing  

sickness, a teacher's confer-  
ence, Easter vacation, Chris-  
mas vacation, or, worst of  
all, summer vacation. But now  
the children were grown, and  
she was even divorced, so she  
could do whatever she wanted,  
whenever she wanted. And,  
even if she didn't need money  
(which she did), she wanted,  
more than anything in the  
whole world, to have a REAL  
job, one which would instant-  
ly provide identity, meaning  
and connections to other peo-  
ple who wanted the same thing.  

RJ had always known that,  
if she could do what she  
wanted, she would move to  
D.C. Back when she was a  
housewife in the north, (who  
wrote letters to Congress),  
D.C. had two major attrac-  
tions. One, it provided an  
escape from winter, and  
it was where things really  
happened, the center of poli-  
tical thought and action.  
Even though she was now some-  
what skeptical about govern-  
ment and politics, she still  
felt drawn to this seeming  
hub of activity. And, for a  
while after she moved there,  
there was a certain glamour  
in the surroundings, although  
not in the jobs she held.  
While working for a Quaker  
job placement organization  
she learned that male co-  
workers would not treat her  
as a respected peer, and she  
did not know how to demand  
that they did. Working with  
a women's lobbying group  
taught her that women were  
not automatically much dif-  
ferent from men, and, again  
her own self-image was an  
obstacle to her job aspira-  
tions. She knew if she could  
just get a job in an “alter-  
native" organization, things  
would be better.  

Suddenly, having simultan-  
eously fallen in love and  
discovered that D.C. was not  
as far from the “snow belt”  
as she had hoped, she moved  
to Newtown, Southstate. While  
it was scary to move without  
a promised job, she managed  
to find a three-month survey  

two,  

New Ways Of Working  

one, which gave her a chance  
to quickly become familiar  
with the community. One  
night, an acquaintance, who  
had just quit her job at the  
local women's health center,  
came to visit. She told stor-  
ies of a fledgling move to-  
ward collectivism, which was  
squelched by the previously  
remote Board of Directors.  
The black "troublemaker" was  

fired outright, other employ-  

ees were subjected to indiv-  
idual loyalty-screening in-  
terviews; the locks on the  
doors were changed, in a  
physical consolidation of  
power.  

RJ was appalled and disil-  
lusioned by all this. Still  
when a friend suggested that  
she apply at the health cen-  
ter for one of the now-open  
jobs, she decided that the  
clinic deserved her, that she  
could work there and influen-  

ce things in a more positive  
way. Besides, she did need a  
job, and almost anything  
looked more attractive than  
the night typing shift at the  
police department, which was  
all she'd been offered. So  
she dropped by one day to put  
in her application. She was  

surprised to find everyone  
so nice and friendly, unlike  
the atmosphere the stories  
had led her to expect. There  
was no formal application  
form; she merely listed her  
gynecological, birth control,  
and feminist-related exper-  
ience.  

Within days she had been  
hired to work in the office,  
joining two other women. Her  
euphoria at having not only  
a paycheck, but the opportun-  
ity to meet needs of women  
coming in and telephoning,  
was dimmed later, when it be-  
came obvious that, like  
everywhere else, the office  
workers were at the bottom  
of the no-hierarchy hierarchy.  
(Significantly, the two black  
women and over-40 RJ were  
the office staff). Office wo-  
men were constantly strug-  
gling not to be treated like  
secretaries, by staff and  
patients alike. The first  
staff meeting was no more  
than a series of announce-  
ments by the Board, which  
could have been more effici-  
ently mimeographed and dis-  
tributed. Still, everyone  
was nice most of the time.  
And working where you did  
not have to wear a bra or  
conceal your lesbian lifesty-

le, was an "alternative".  
Once, however, she was left  
in the office alone and there  
were too many demands for  
her inexperienced state, so  
she took both phone lines off  
the hook, to deal with the  
people standing in line. The  

New Women's Survival Handbook  

director happened by and  
told her she couldn't do that.  
The next week, one of the of-  
fice women, who acted as sup-  
ervisor, met with her and  
suggested this might not be the  
right job for her. Since  
she had asked the counseling  
coordinator to consider her  
for the counseling opening,  
without even receiving a re-  
sponse (and her still meager  
self-image prevented her  
from asking again) she was  
afraid she would lose her  
job. But, instead, the envir-  
onment gradually seemed to  
improve; the office workers  
even banded together and de-  
manded a lunch break. Still,  
unlike other clinic areas,  
the office women were unable  
to hold meetings, because  
they would still have to an-  
swer the phones. As in other  
workplaces, clerical work  
was in reality, less valued;  
workers less respected. How-  
ever, as the months went by,  
staff meetings became less  
formal, and the overall sit-  
uation seemed relatively pos-  
itive.  

The clinic income was sub-  

ject to seasonal fluctuation,  
and, in the lean months,  
hourly workers were faced  
with lower paychecks, while  
the salaried administrators  
continued without financial  
loss. Occasionally, an unen-  
lightened new woman expressed  
discomfort with the indirect,  
unspecified, role of the  
Board of Directors. She was  
soon quieted by the silence  
which greeted her obviously  
taboo questions. New women  
often had misconceptions a-  
bout how the clinic was run,  
expecting some sort of quasi-  
consensus. But they were al-  
ways reminded that, during  
the brief days of collectiv-  
ism, the toilet paper wasn't  
put into the bathrooms, the  
plants didn't get watered,  
and women who took less re-  
sponsibility got paid as much  
as the dedicated few!  

During the months previous  
to what became known as "the  
revolution", an atmosphere of  
uneasy tension prevailed.  
Worker expectations collided  
increasingly with Board prac-  
tices, especially regarding  
money matters. While salaries  
remained low, plans were made  
by the Board to siphon off  
money to start clinics in  
other towns. The climax was a  
Board meeting of questionable  
quorum in which the director  
was fired, funds were moved  
to another bank, clinic door  
locks again changed. Workers  
present at the meeting endur-  
ed this mutely for a few min-  
utes, then suddenly they  
mobilized, refusing to come  
to work, and sued the Board  
for an illegal meeting. An  
11th hour, out-of-court set-  
tlement gave the clinic, it-  
self, to the workers, while  
the Board won the only new  
project, a birth center.  
Although losing the alter-  
native birth center was a  
disappointment, clinic mem-  
bers were hopeful that hard  
work would result in creation  
of the kind of workplace many  
of them had long envisioned.  
Knowing more about what they  
didn't want than what they  
did, and having concluded  
that the old structure was  
inadequate for dealing with  
conflict, they held endless,  
idealistic meetings to try  
and devise a new structure.  
While it was recognized that  
some of the cost of creating  
might seem like a waste of  
money, it was equally true  
that they could not afford  

struggle  

Together ... Idealism Dies Hard  

not to work on the signifi-  
cant issues. Romantic ideal-  
ism concerning the automatic  
perfection of a worker-con-  
trolled structure, died hard.  
A business manager, an old-  
er woman with years of exper-  
ience, was hired to try and  
get some traditional tools  
for managing this non-tradi-  
tional place. Most women did  
not know exactly what they  
wanted the business manager  
to do, but they wanted her to  
do it well and yesterday. A  
counseling coordinator, with  
a Master's Degree, hired by  
the previous Board, seemed a  
symbol of the conflict between  
the old and the new. (The  
old Board had insisted on the  
expertise of a M.A.; the non-  
hierarchical nature of the  
workplace now seemed invalida-  
ting to her very expertise.)  
Many issues dichotomized  
neatly; salary became nurses  
vs. counselors. Friendship  
networks informally prompted  
other alignments (lesbian vs.  
straight, task vs. process--  
nurses more often viewed as  
"not wanting to waste time  
processing"). Once a major  
problem occurred when a woman  
approved for hiring by the  
staff, was unacceptable to the  
nursing coordinator, who  
threatened to quit. The office  
staff backed down and did not  
hire this woman, but the  
nursing coordinator quit anyway.  
After this, the counseling  
coordinator, who had opposed  
the nursing coordinator on this  
issue, and who already felt  
her M.A. type abilities were  
unappreciated, quit. The staff,  
in an attempt to learn something  
of value from all this,  
instituted a procedure where  
present employees, who have  
a concern about a potential  
employee, are part of the  
initial screening interview.  

Good things were happening.  
Job rotation had been insti-  
tuted, which broke down some  
area rigidities and retarded  
some burnout; RJ now worked  
half-time in the office,  
half-time counseling. (For  
a variety of personal and  
institutional reasons, rota-  
tion was usually limited to  
office/counseling, rather  
than nursing area.) Office  
worker meetings were now held  
away from the clinic while  
another staff member covered  
the office. The clinic seem-  
ed to stumble along, always  
managing, despite crucial  

unresolved issues, to keep  
going and deliver services  
to women in a good way. Al-  
though the committees which  
sprang up spontaneously, to  
study issues or work on pro-  

jects, were less validated  
than the more formal, stand-  
ing committees, the hoped  

for evolution to a workable  
structure seemed to be hap-  
pening. The director, who  
had encouraged a move toward  
committee/consensus decision  
making during the 18 month  
post-revolution period, de-  
cided she needed a break  

and resigned. (RJ realized  
that one of the unsolved pro-  
blems was that despite a  
commitment to worker-control  
she and others sat back and  
left the bottom-line respon-  
sibility to the director.)  
However, all were pleased  
with the choice of new direc-  
tor. A woman who had been a  
nurse, a counselor, and own-  
ed her own business, she was  
obviously someone who would  
be able to identify with each  
of the sometimes “warring”  
areas of the clinic.  

Unfortunately it seemed to  
RJ that it was the wrong time  
of the year for a new direc-  
tor to be initiated. The usual  
financial summer slump, not as  
bad as some had been, was  
viewed with understandable  
alarm by the new director, who  
felt responsible for all cli-  
nic affairs. A nearby building  
became available, and, despite  
cash-flow crunch, the business  
manager, her friend who had  
become the bookkeeper, and  
others feeling primarily res-  
ponsive to crowded conditions,  
recommended renting the addi-  
tional space. A special meet-  
ing was held during which  
people expressed feelings,  
talked about risks and practi-  
calities. Because the group  
was almost evenly divided, the  
building was not rented. Al-  
though, as often happened,  
complex attitudes were either  
labelled either "pro" or  
“anti" expansion, this process  
seemed healthy and “alterna-  
tive". Women, who complained  
that the nursing coordinator  
had "misused a proxy” seemed  
to misunderstand the point  
that, no matter what the  

exact "vote", such a lack of  
consensus automatically pre-  
cluded acting. It was too  

bad that the "expansion com-  
mittee" members, demoralized  
by this decision, chose to  
abandon the question alto-  

gether, and no one else took  
up the matter of other pos-  
sible solutions to the crowded  

conditions. As often happens,  

service-delivery responsibi-  
lities demanded all of most  
workers' time and energy. It  
was also unfortunate that an  
atmosphere of distrust be-  
tween the director and busi-  
ness manager could not be  
alleviated. Several long  
staff meetings were held to  
try and deal with this. (La-  

ter the director would charge  

that these meetings were al-  
ways diverted from issues to  
“processing communication  
difficulties.") It seemed to  
RJ that the director's be-  
ing new during the financial  
crunch magnified the effect  
of the business manager's  
defensiveness. The heritage  
of not knowing what ques-  
tions needed to be address-  
ed to solve the long-stand-  
ing lack of financial pre-  
dictability increased  

The business mana-  
ger, like the former counsel-  
ing coordinator, felt her  
expertise was not valued or  
used.  

The long, hot summer of  
trying to keep the creditors  
slightly appeased seemed to  
add to the raw nerves, and,  
without warning, the book-  
keeper resigned, giving six  
weeks notice. The business  
manager put off advertising  
for a replacement, resulting  
in last-minute attempts to  
fill the vacancy. The direc-  
tor, in what seemed an attem-  
pt to find someone who could  
take over with a minimum of  
training, encouraged another  
former bookkeeper (who had  
previously been eased out by  
the business manager) to ap-  

ply. When she was hired, this  

seemed to some a patently un-  

workable solution (these same  
two women had been unable to  
work together before.) Dis-  
approval took the form of  
saying the hiring policy had  
not been followed, (women  
with concerns were not in-  
formed ahead of time so they  
could be part of the screen-  
ing interview.) A bookkeep-  
ing assistant stated that the  
daysheets had recently been  
improperly done. The clinic  
ordered an audit, which the  
business manager believed  

was a waste of money.  

A notice was suddenly post-  
ed that the former bookkeeper  
wanted to return to meet with  
the staff. It was rumored  
that she would confess to  
not having done her job pro-  
perly. At the meeting she was  
confronted with an employee  
health insurance check which  
had been filed, never mailed.  
Workers had unknowingly been  
without health insurance for  
three months. The staff women  
were understandably angry and  
expressed that. The meeting,  
attended by some who never  
came to meetings, changed to  
a tone of verbal mob violence.  
Women on the finance commit-  
tee, who had helped the busi-  
ness manager explain why fi-  
gures were not available, now  
felt they had been betrayed.  
It seemed that anger had  
automatically shifted, for  
reasons beyond the tradition-  
al "chain-of-command" ones,  
from the woman who had made  
mistakes to the business man-  
ager. The director questioned  
the business manager's  
competence. RJ interjected
