Mexico City Conference

Why Are We Going?

Information

There has been much confu-
sion over plans for the Inter-
national Women’s Year, U.N.
conference in Mexico City, June
19-July 2. We have tried to sort
out some facts and evaluate
radical feminist, and especially
lesbian, participation in it.

First, there are two quite
separate conferences planned.
One is for official government
delegations and is very closed.
The Women’s Action Alliance is
seeking to pressure the govern-
ment to include radical issues
within that conference and
suggestions can be sent to them:
Women’s Action Alliance, 370
Lexington Ave., NY, NY 10017.
Most feminists going to Mexico
should know that security at the
government's conference will be
tight and efforts to get in are
probably useless.

The other conference planned
through the non-governmental
organization's (NGO) apparatus
of the US is an open event called
the Tribune. There will be two
large rooms that seat 2000
persons each with translation
facilities and mikes on the floor.
There will also be numerous
small rooms without translation
facilities. Women from the US
planning to go are urged to
register in advance as there may
be efforts to limit the US
presence and registration is your
best way to ensure attendance.
(Send registration to IWY
Tribune, Rm. 815, 345 East 46th
St, NY, NY 10017.)

As far as we can ascertain
there are no plans for “an
alternate conference.” The
translation and logistics to plan
such are overwhelming. It
therefore appears that
lesbian/feminists should work
through the second UN con-
ference — The Tribune. As we
understand the agenda to date,
there will be a week of
scheduled presentations,
followed by some days for open
mikes and workshops.

While organized for Inter-
national Women’s Year, the
conferences are not planned for
feminists and do not claim to be

“feminist events.” Nevertheless, we think that
some radical and
lesbian/feminist presence is
vital, while not making the
conference our movement's
priority. We have written to the
organizers of the Tribune re-
questing space for lesbians to
make a presentation and hold
workshops. Further, those
lesbian/feminists who go to
Mexico City should hold special
workshops and meet together
there. In order to do so most
effectively, we think feminists
should consider carefully what
the situation in Mexico City will
be.

Perspective
Most countries, except for the

US, Canada, and Mexico, will be
represented by relatively few
women either sent by their
governments or who can afford
the high cost of coming. We have
heard that even West European
feminists cannot afford to come
in large numbers. Therefore, the
presence of large numbers of
women from the US presents
serious problems. No matter
whether the individual is con-
servative to radical, she will be
part of an overwhelming US
presence and domination of the
conference which will be
resented by many. This is the
reality of American cultural and
economic imperialism.

Also since most women from
the Tribune will not attend the
government's conference, we
will not be speaking directly to
governmental representatives.
Rather we will be talking with
individuals who may or may not
be tied to policy-making in their
countries. There will be some
communication of what goes on
at the Tribune to the official
government's conference, but
no one should go assuming that
you will be directly confronting
those governments.

Therefore, we think that US
feminists should consider
seriously whether to go to Mex-
ico at all and what our presence
there means. Some thoughts
that we have are:

1. Groups from particular cities
or projects might send only one
woman to present your concerns
rather than having whoever can
afford to go.

2. Individuals going to Mexico
primarily for a vacation should
consider the impact and
problems caused by massive
numbers of Americans out-
numbering other women pre-
sent and re-consider where to
spend your vacation.

3. People considering taking
actions in Mexico should
remember that it is not primarily
us, U.S. women, but the Mex-
ican feminists who will suffer
any repercussions of what we do
there.

4. Most importantly those who
go (and some lesbian/feminist
presence is important) should
keep in mind that all Americans

go straight to
your face in the
form of one
enormous grin.
Because The
Nature Shoe is a carefully designed form for your
feet which takes into consideration the way your foot
is shaped and the way you were meant to walk in the
first place.
Your foot has an arch, so The Nature Shoe has
an arch.
Your foot has a heel, so The Nature Shoe makes
room for your heel! And the heel is slightly lower
than the toe because that’s how your weight is most
naturally distributed.
The Nature Shoe comes in lots of different
styles, and each one is made with the finest quality
materials and workmanship for optimum comfort
and wear.

Bring your feet in for a test grin. The”

are from an imperialist country
and our behavior, even as
feminists, often reflects that. For
example, English language
domination will be an issue at
the conference; priority should
go to sending women who speak
other languages. In setting up
our workshops, we should
provide translation and
remember that we are at an
advantage verbally, if all conver-
sations are conducted in
English. Even when others
speak English, it is their 2nd or
3rd language while it is our
native tongue.

Feminists should go to listen
as much as to show the world
what our idea of feminism is. We
should take the time and oppor-
tunity to listen closely to what
women of other countries tell us
about their lives — both their
oppressions and strengths.
Those strengths are often ones
that have been socialized out of
most white, middle-class
women and, therefore, we often
fail to recognize them in others.

If feminists attend the Tribune
with such a consciousness and if
the number of Americans is not
totally overwhelming, there
should be many chances to learn
and to share our politics, ex-
periences, and insights with
other women. Without this con-
sciousness, we play into the
hands of US imperialism and
confirm the stereotype of the
arrogant American. Men around
the world already use that
stereotype to denounce
“women's lib” and to keep “their
women” divided from us. We
must show the women
themselves that we are not
simply feminist American
chauvinists and then some real
learning and exchange can take
place.

Co-Ordination
The women of the National
Gay Task Force Board of Direc-
tors are sending Frances
Doughty to Mexico City to repre-
sent us and to help coordinate a
lesbian/feminist presence
there. She would like to know
who from around the country is
planning to go in order to co-or-
dinate a lesbian presence and
workshops that take seriously
this approach. Write her at:

Contract Bars
Sexist Exploitation

Cathy Travis

(Editor's note: The following is
an edited version of a story from
Majority Report, a bi-weekly
feminist newspaper published in
New York City).

The recording contract be-
tween the all-women’s music
group ‘The Deadly Night-
shade” and Phantom/RCA
specifically prohibits “sexist
exploitation” of the three
member band. “This applies to
our publishing as well as to our
recording contract,” emphasized
band member Anne Bowen.
“Final approval is with the
group.”

The members of the group
have the right to approve “the
overall approach and content of
advertising campaigns
promoting (their) recordings in
order to ensure them against
sexist exploitation.” Sexist ex-
ploitation is defined in the con-
tract as the use of terms about
women “which are slang or
demeaning to feminist sen-
sibilities.”

At one time the Deadly Night-
shade considered starting its
own production company to
avoid the kind of hassles their
present contract seems to
protect them from. But they say
that they signed with Phantom
/RCA because of the “incredible
number of skills” they could
learn and “the greater number
of people that could be reached.”

Three musicians are in the
group — Helen Hooke on electric
and acoustic guitar, fiddle,
piano, and synthesizer; Anne
Bowen on acoustic guitar, wash-
board, jug and percussion; and
Pamela Brandt on bass, as well
as on feet and acoustic cow,
according to liner notes to their
new album.

The group performs a variety
of material ranging from blue-
grass, country, and folk to rock.
Their repertoire includes songs
by Fats Waller, the Carter Fami-
ly, Judy Collins, Aretha Franklin,
the Grateful Dead and the Roll-
ing Stones — with sexist lyrics
changed.

Except for one oldie, “Keep on
the Sunny Side,” Deadly Night-
shade’s first album contains
only the group’s own feminist
compositions. Their song “Shuf-
fle” is about a woman who won't
“shuffle” for a man anymore:

“Now he says, ‘I miss you so,
why do you have to spend

So little time at home with me,
and so much with your friends?”

She says, ‘Baby it takes time; I
got some catching up to do;

Got to do right by myself,
before I do right by you.”

Shuffle one, shuffle two

Ain't nobody shuffle like I used
to do.

Shuffle three, shuffle four,
ain't gonna see me shuffle no
more.

Shuffle five, six, seven, eight,
nine;

I ain't gonna follow ten spaces
behind.

Shuffle ten, that’s the end;

I ain't gonna shuffle again.”

Deadly Nightshade performs
around the Northeast, and
appeared most recently in New
York City at an International
Women’s Day Rally in Union
Square. During their perfor-
mance at the Bottom Line night-
club in New York, they com-
mented in a vein not often heard
in a nightclub: “We were talking
to some of the waitresses here.
They really don’t get paid much.
So why not tip them? They
deserve it.”
