"A SAFE PLACE FOR RACISM"

Dear Editor,

At the Counseling Center in April, I
participated as the token black member
of an otherwise all-white panel on les-
bianism for trainees of the Women's

racism

Crisis Line. Carol Wollersheim, a white
participant in the training session,
greeted me, "Who let the nigger in?"

Two other white women, a co-panelist
and a trainee, were standing with Woll-
ersheim and me. One of them said in
response to Wollersheim's racist com-
ment, “That was unexpected." The other
said nothing.

When I told Wollersheim I didn't app-
reciate her comment, controlling my an-
ger, she was patronizing and condescend-
ing as she apologized and tried to em-
brace me twice. After I rebuffed her
apology, she walked away mumbling in-
dignantly.

Later, anger redirected, I recalled
the many times white women have ques-
tioned me and complained about the lack
of participation of black women in their
community's organizations and functions.

That the co-panelist misnamed Wollersheim's comment as "unexpected" rather
than calling it what it was; that the
trainee remained silent; and that nei-
ther of them reprimanded Wollersheim,
led me to think that the Counseling
Center is considered a safe environment
by those who make racist comments.

That there exist safe environments
for racism within the so-called women's
community is only one reason there are
not more than a handful of women of
color, tolerant but frustrated, in that
community.

The other reasons include: most white
women failing to acknowledge and ques-
tion their own racism and how it is
manifested when working with women of
color; placing the elimination of rac-
ism as a low priority within the femi-
nist ideology (if a priority at all);
and remaining fearful, silent and ignor-
ant when the prevalence of racism with-
in the women's community is discussed.

What woman of color would want to par-
ticipate in such a silently hostile and
defensive atmosphere?

So when a white woman of the women's
community asks me why there aren't more
women of color in the women's community,

maybe she will better understand when
told about the preceding. Maybe.

I submitted the preceding letter to
the acting editor of Common Ground, the
bi-monthly newsmagazine of the Women's
Coalition, for publication in the May/
June issue, "Lesbianism in the Women's
Movement" (the Coalition is an umbrella
organization for 14 Milwaukee women's
groups). The letter would be published,
she told me, provided there was room.

I have been Common Ground's layout
design and pasteup artist for almost a
year (and during that time the only
staff member of color). There was room
in this issue for my letter.

Once that was established, Common
Ground staff members criticized the
letter as being "divisive," "hostile,"
and "counterproductive." They then in-
formed me that they would publish the
letter, but now followed by their own
editorial comment.

Finally, without consulting me, the
same Common Ground staff members re-
jected the idea of publishing my letter
and the editorial comment. Instead,
they wrote and published a "whitewashed"
version of the Counseling Center inci-
dent in the form of an editorial state-
ment which follows:

EDITORIAL STATEMENT

The following incident has come to
our attention. Because the issue is
serious, we would like to acquaint you
with the facts.

A member of the Common Ground staff
participated recently in a lesbian
panel sponsored by the Women's Crisis
Line. At some point before the training
session began, a white participant
greeted the panelist with, "Who let the
nigger in?"

The panelist rebuked this woman for
her statement and was dealt with in a
condescending manner.

As shocking as this incident is, it
must be acknowledged. Regardless of the
intent of the person who spoke these
words, this can only be interpreted as
a blatantly racist statement. Similar
statements are frequent occurrences for
women of color.

Because of the importance of con-
fronting this issue directly, we are
charging the Women's Crisis Line with
the development of a training session
