Gay And Poor

The House voted 281 to 124  
on June 18 to restrict sharply  
the use of federal funds  
to provide legal assistance  
to poor people who are homo-  
sexuals.

The action would bar the  
Legal Services Corp., under  
siege from the Reagan admin-  
istration and congressional  
conservatives, from using  
tax dollars to "promote, de-  
fend or protect homosexuality."

Supporters of legal aid ar-  
gued that McDonald's amend-  
ment could deny basic, govern-  
ment-paid legal help for poor  
people who happen to be homo-  
sexuals, such as those who  
thought they were victims of  
housing or employment discri-  
mination.

McDonald replied that a  
homosexual still could get  
legal aid as long as the issue  
of homosexuality was not  
injected into the matter.

"If he keeps his conduct  
to himself, then he can walk  
into any Legal Services and  
get help."

Dunk Phyllis

"Women are like teabags:  
you don't know their strength  
until they get into hot wa-  
ter."

-Phyllis Schlafly  
March 22, 1979  
Can we dunk you, Phyllis?

In Chains

A former jail inmate is su-  
ing the Los Angeles County  
sheriff for $10 million,  
claiming she was chained to  
a hospital bed when she gave  
birth. Fern Dalton went  
through labor and delivery  
manacled and handcuffed to a  
bed because the deputy who  
had the key to the chains  
couldn't be found.

Ms. Dalton, a Navajo, said  
she had been considered a  
high-risk maternity patient  
because she had a predispo-  
sition to uterine cancer.  
Cancer has developed. She  
said her doctor had ordered  
her transferred to an opera-  
ting room for a Caesarean  
section. Because the deputy  
couldn't be found, Ms. Dalton  
had to undergo a painful vag-  
inal birth.

The suit alleges that Ms.  
Dalton was subjected to cruel  
and unusual punishment.

= Rights For Whites

The Homemakers' Equal Rights  
Association is holding a fund-  
raising auction to raise money  
for its "Countdown to Equalit-  
y," the final push for ratifi-  
cation of the ERA. ERA sup-  
porters can bid on a kruger-  
rand, the South African gold  
coin. R. Morene Archer, who  
donated the coin, stated that  
she wants the money to be used  
to “work in unratified states  
so that all American homemak-  
ers can share the dignity  
and justice we so rightly de-  
serve.”

What about dignity and jus-  
tice for the severely exploit-  
ed black workers who mine the  
gold that produces these con-  
troversial coins?

Congress Nonsense

House of Representative Mc-  
Donald (D-Ga.), long time  
member of the John Birch So-  
ciety, has again introduced  
an anti-gay resolution in  
the House. The Resolution  
would declare the "sense of  
Congress" that this nation  
will never afford gay men  
and lesbians the same civil  
rights which other citizens  
take for granted. Although  
there is no clear indication  
that the Resolution will ever  
be passed, Gary Jarmin, Chris-  
tian Voice lobbyist, indic-  
ates that his organization  
will press vigorously for  
co-sponsors of the Resolution.

Save Our Children

The National Education Ass-  
ociation, the largest teach-  
er's union in the nation, has  
charged that the KKK is re-  
cruiting young people, as  
young as 10, into the KKK.  
Children are brought to Klan  
rallies and cross burning  
and the NEA estimates that  
the Klan has tripled its  
membership in the last 10  
years to 11,500.

The June issue of the NEA  
Reporter estimated that 15%  
of Klan members or sympath-  
izers at most rallies are  
teenagers. The Klan, which  
uses the Nazi salute, is  
encouraging the children to  
wear T-shirts that promote  
"White Power."

Last year's NEA convention  
committed funds to "train, in-  
form and assist teachers” in  
connection with programs aim-  
ed at combatting intolerance.

Low Risk?

The American Psychiatric As-  
sociation (APA) has escalated  
its war against the 1978 rul-  
ing by the Food and Drug Ad-  
ministration that the use of  
shock therapy constitutes high  
risk.

The APA is planning to petition  
the FDA to have the high  
risk category reduced to low  
risk and is campaigning to  
promote the greater use of  
shock treatment through the  
media and pro-shock articles.

Lost Your Flock?

Television evangelists, in-  
cluding Jerry Falwell and Oral  
Roberts, are not nearly as  
popular as they claim, accord-  
ing to a new book based on  
viewer surveys.

The book, which is based on  
television viewer research by  
Arbitron, reports that the  
years between 1970 and 1975  
were a period of rapid growth  
for television preachers but  
that an overall decline in  
viewers from nearly 21 mill-  
ion to fewer than 20 million  
has occurred in the past three  
years.

Boycott Blue

Shield by the Office and Prof-  
essional Employees Internat-  
ional Union, Local 3 (of San  
Francisco) --comprised mostly  
of black and Filipino women--  
for cost-of-living increases  
and improved health standards  
and against the harassment of  
union members continues. Lo-  
cal 3 has asked other unions

Downward Mobility

Johns Hopkins, the first  
hospital to do sex-change sur-  
gery in this country, has  
stopped doing it. They say  
they've based this decision  
on a study that called into  
question the benefits of these  
drastic operations. In her  
book The Transsexual Empire,  
Dr. Janice Raymond says...  
"What transsexual surgery  
does is to short circuit the  
deeper social issues--trans-  
sexual surgery is just help-  
ing more people become more  
stereotyped and encouraging  
these people to live out rig-  
id roles."

The study found that those  
who changed from female to  
male all earned MORE after  
surgery, but most of the  
male-to-female transsexuals  
earned a LOWER income after  
their change.
