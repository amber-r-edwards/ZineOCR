Airborne Putdown

An $80,000 nationwide ad-
vertising campaign by Ansett
Airlines (Australia) is bas-
ed on a photograph of a woman
wearing just a scanty wrap
standing at the top of an
aircraft aisle with men seat-
ed to her side, and the cap-
tion reads "If the hostess
was out of uniform would you
know which airline you were
flying with?" The president
of the Australian Airline
Hostesses' Association, Ms.
Lyn Pike, said that hostesses
had complained in the past
to Ansett about an advertise-
ment in Playboy magazine,
which contained the words
"coming on hot and strong" be-
low a photograph of a host-
ess. She said the small
type on that advertisement
referred to coffee and other
services.

The People Speak

In May this year, feminists
in Queensland, Australia,
successfully lobbied an anti-
abortion bill out of the
Queensland parliament. The
proposed legislation denied
women the right to choose
abortion and defended the
rights of the unborn child.

During the protracted fight
to have the legislation
thrown out, a new set of sur-
vey results were printed in
the Australian Women's Week-
ly which showed that the
majority of Australian wo-
men favored a policy of
free abortion on demand.
On a national level, 88%
thought that abortion should
be freely available, 11%
felt that abortion should
be freely available only
if there was a health risk,
and only 1% registered a NO
to this question.

Disposable Workers

Disabled and mentally im-
paired people are being hired
at minimum wage to clean up
the poisonous chemicals in the
Love Canal area near Buffalo,
N.Y. Love Canal is where
Hooker Chemical dumped some
of the most toxic chemicals
known. The plant plans to
start the clean-up without
waiting for the Environmental
Protection Agency's report on
whether the area can be cleared
without hurting or killing
the workers.

Name That Cop

Women's groups in India are
protesting a new rape bill
which would punish anyone who
reveals the name of a rape
victim. The Bombay Lawyers’
Collective is reported by
Womenews as stating the mea-
sure appears to protect the
police rather than the women.
The measure comes on the heels
of an uproar by Indian women
over a case in which the po-
lice themselves had committed
the rapes.

Hard Day

In Brixton, London, angry
women occupied a local cafe
after a young woman was sex-
ually assaulted by the mana-
ger there. They slapped up
posters on the outside asking
people to boycott the cafe,
then walked in as a group,
trapping the staff inside and
giving the manager "one of the
worst days of his life - which
is only fair considering that
is what he gave her."

More Victims

The Los Angeles Times re-
ports that while the count-
ry's attention has been fo-
cused on the murders of child-
ren in Atlanta, that city has
also witnessed an alarming
number of unsolved murder
cases involving teenage girls
and women.

According to the Times, at
least 38 unsolved killings of
Atlanta-area females have oc-
curred since late 1978. Most
of the victims--who ranged in
age from 14 to 60-- died from
stabbing or strangulation.

"It is believed by some
observers that the number of
unsolved slayings of females
would exceed 38 if victims
whose bodies were found in
all suburbs and neighboring
counties also were counted.
That procedure is already
used in the widely publicized
case of black youths."

Fascist Fade-in

The Chinese custom of drown-
ing baby girls at birth is ap-
parently still going on.
Authorities outside China
had believed that the practice
had faded away after the Comm-
unists gained power in 1949.
However, an official family
planning document by the Chi-
nese government says other-
wise.

The document says that the
continuation of the custom
shows that many Chinese--ap-
parently mainly in rural areas
--still value male children
more than female offspring,
because of the lingering idea
that boys will be more useful
workers.

The paper published in the
latest issue of Population
Studies journal, gave no esti-
mate of how many female child-
ren are killed each year by
their parents.

Dry Up, Jack

A prominent Tampa opponent
of sex education has been
charged with sexual abuse of
two minors. Jack Gregorio
allegedly performed a lewd and
lascivious act on an 8-yr.-old
girl, along with sexual bat-
tery of a 17-yr.-old boy.

Gregorio has been leading
a campaign to remove sex ed-
ucation books from the child-
ren's section of the local pu-
blic library. He is president
of Taxpaying Parents Against
Kiddie Smut, which with any
luck will now expire due to a
sudden drying up of contri-
butions.

Mendez Support

Alfredo Mendez, one of the
eleven Puerto Rican Prisoners
of War, has been hidden by
the U.S. government. Alfred-
o and his 10 comrades have
been accused of membership in
the FALN, a clandestine org-
anization opposed to the U.S. government. The eleven are accused
of membership in FALN, a group which has
carried out armed actions in
the fight to achieve independ-
ence and socialism for Puerto
Rico. Mendez' family, lawyers
and supporters have not known
of his whereabouts within the
U.S. prison system for near-
ly two weeks, and fear that
his life may be in grave dan-
ger. Please send telegrams
and letters of support, and
hold the U.S. government
responsible for his safety to:

Judges Fantasy

A Washington, D.C. judge
decided that Gloria Whipple,
a 51-yr.-old artist who died
in 1979 after she was brutally
beaten, may have "fantasized"
that she had been raped, even
though shortly after the at-
tack she told a policeman who
found her that she had been.

"It would require an extreme-
ly naive human being to bel-
ieve that this was not a sit-
uation that would be subject
to great fantasies...I would
suspect that a lady in her po-
sition in the park at that
hour of the night gets grabbed
the first thing she thinks of
is the subject, and the sub-
ject and the object is me,
and the purpose is rape. She
may be surprised," Pratt con-
tinued, "that it's murder in-
stead, but she certainly
thinks it's rape first."
