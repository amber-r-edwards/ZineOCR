Eva Williams: Target For Punishment

United League of Holmes County

According to Eva Williams,  
this is what happened:

self-defense

Her husband would physically  
abuse her, leaving her  
bleeding from the nose and/or  
mouth; with scratches over  
her body, and with a badly  
sprained wrist at one time.  
Finally, after having left him  
several times (she was paying  
for their apartment) and often  
being forcibly brought back,  
Eva's husband started slap-  
ping her and accusing her of  
seeing other men. She asked  
him to leave but he refused  
and continued to slap her. Eva  
went to the kitchen and got a  
knife, telling him again to  
stop. He said, "You're my  
wife and you'll do what I want  
you to do" and grabbed her.  
She stabbed him. He died. Eva  
turned herself in. This was  
August, 1982.

Eva was taken to the Holmes  
County Jail in August, 1982,  
and indicted for murder. Her  
trial, which was supposed to  
be held in the October term  
of court, was not held, poss-  
ibly due to the 3-week trial  
of Eddie Carthan. Eva remain-  
ed in jail.

In September, her court-ap-  
pointed attorney filed a mo-  
tion to obtain a mental exam  
for Eva in preparation for  
her trial. The Court issued  
an order for a mental exam on  
Sept. 22, 1982. It was not  
done.

During the 2nd week in Jan-  
uary, around 11 a.m. or noon,  
Eva wanted to make a phone  
call. The jailer (a woman)  
brought her to the public  
phone and left her there. Eva  
says that one of the deputy  
sheriffs came into the book-  
ing room where she was using  
the phone and said, "Eva, I've  
been wanting you for a long  
time--and you don't act like  
you care anything for me."  
Eva responded, "That's your  
tough luck." He said, "It's  
going to be your tough luck  

in a minute." He then pro-  
ceeded to rape her right  
there. --but to no avail. He  
pinned her arms behind her and  
raped her for 5-10 minutes while  
Eva was calling for help. She  
could hear the woman in the  
next room typing, but the  
typing never stopped. Eva  
told the deputy that she was  
going to tell the sheriff,  
and he said, "You'd better not;  
I'll break your arm if you  
do... the Sheriff won't  
believe you anyway." The dep-  
uty went back to his office  
and Eva went back to her  

cell. She was alone there.  
(Her cellmate was working in  
the kitchen.) She sat on her  
bed and cried. She didn't  
tell anyone what had happened  
that day.

Eva told one of the trus-  
tees what had happened. She  
also told her mother and her  
brother and sister when they  
came to see her on the next  
visiting Sunday. The trustee  
told Eddie Carthan who went  
to her cell to talk with her.  
He told her to report it to  
the Sheriff. It appears Eva's  
mother wanted to talk to Eva  
about this, and was not al-  
lowed to see her the last  
time she came to do this.  
Finally, a meeting was held  
in which Eva, her mother,  
brother and sister, met with  
the Sheriff and the deputy  

in question. Her state-ap-  
pointed attorney was also  
called in to question her.  
She told him also that she  
had been raped. He asked her  
who put her up to this--did  
Eddie Carthan? She told him  
that both Eddie Carthan and  
the trustee had encouraged  
her to report what had hap-  
pened. The Sheriff, when  
questioned by one of the med-  
ia later, said that he did-  
n't have Eva examined because  
he didn't believe her!

On Jan. 31, 1983, Eddie  
Carthan called the United  
League of Holmes Office to  
report the alleged rape and  
request investigation from  
the outside. He stated in  
that telephone conversation,  
"You will have to move fast  
because they are moving fast  
to cover it up."

On Feb. 1, 1983, Eddie  
Carthan, along with the other  
state prisoners, were moved  
in a sudden, surprise move to  
the state penitentiary. None  
of their families were noti-  

fied, nor were the inmates.  
Eddie and 2 others were  
shackled, wrists to waist  
and ankles.

On Feb. 2, 1983, citizens  
from Holmes County went to  
the Holmes County jail to  
protest the sudden move of  
the prisoners to the state  
penitentiary, knowing that  
it was related to the report-  
ing of the rape; as well as  
to talk with the Sheriff  

about Eva Williams. Instead  
of discussing the matter, 9  
were arrested and jailed. Be-  

fore the women who were arrest-  

ed were put in a cell (togeth-  
er--because there is only 1  
cell for women), Eva was moved  
upstairs in a cell which was  
in the midst of an area where  
only male inmates were kept.  
On Feb. 3, 1983, Eva Will-  
iams, without warning, was  
moved from Holmes County Jail  
to the state mental hospital  
in Whitfield, MS. She was  
placed in a ward with patients  
who were very psychotic. Eva  
believes she was pregnant  
when she went in.

On March 29--almost 2 full  
months later, Eva Williams  
was taken from Whitfield  
State Hospital by one of the  
deputy sheriffs back to  
Holmes County jail. Contact  
had been made while Eva was  
at the state hospital to find  
out how much her bond was.  
The sheriff's office refused  
to say. Several days later,  
Eva's bond was set at $30,000.  
It wasn't until a couple of  
weeks later that we were in-  
formed by Eva's brother, that  
last fall they had been told  
that the bond was $10,000 and  
that it had been lowered to  
$7,500. He said he never heard  
$30,000 mentioned until this  
time.

Eva Williams remains in the  
Holmes County Jail, frighten-  
ed and wanting to get out as  
soon as possible. Eva Will-  
iams states that she is no  
longer pregnant. Eva Williams  
is a victim of the racism,  
classism, and sexism that  
pervades our society to the  
core.
