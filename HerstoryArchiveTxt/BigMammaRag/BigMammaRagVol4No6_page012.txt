Feminist Awareness Forum  
Community College  
of Denver, Auraria Campus  

The CCD Feminist Aware-  
ness Forum has been in  
existence since the Fall of  
1974. The group has been  
very active in work with  
women in prison, including  
setting up a library at the  
Denver County Jail, arranging  
for women prisoners to attend  
classes on Study Release, and  
providing women in jail with  
information on school oppor-  
tunities and educational fi-  
nancial aid.  

The group has also been  
fighting for establishment of a  
Women’s Center on the Au-  
raria Campus. After over a  
year of bureaucratic run-  
arounds, they have finally  
been granted tentative space.  
The space, in Building 28  
Room 157B, will temporarily  
be shared with Learning Re-  
source Center. The fight,  
however, is far from over.  

There are still numerous  
structural and control hassles  
to be worked out with the  
less-than-responsive College  
Administration. Hopefully,  
sometime in the near future  
the women of CCD will have a  
Women's Center that is really  
theirs.  

Abortion Referral &  
Counseling Service  
1400 Lafayette,  
Denver, CO  

9-4:30 weekdays  

The Abortion Referral and  
Counseling Service (ARCS) is  
a necessary and vital service  
to women in the Denver area.  
Headed by Lee Wilson,  
Dortha Howe, and Tori Ayers,  
the service provides a coun-  
seling and information system  
to women in need of abortions.  
They offer updated info on  
different techniques, doctors,  
hospitals and prices as well as  
information on birth control  
methods. They set up ap-  
pointments and provide trans-  
portation for women in need of  
help. The service desperately  
needs volunteers to answer  
the phone 4-8 hours a week  
during the day. In addition,  
calls can be transferred and  
they need women who can  
take calls at home weekends.  
Lee and Dortha are presently  
doing all the counseling, and  
Lee feels working with this  
service would be a tremen-  
dous place for women who  
want to help other women. To  
volunteer call the ARCS office  
at 832-2293 or Lee Wilson at  
377-7140.  

Homemakers for the ERA  
6950 W. 62nd Avenue  
Arvada, CO 80003  

The Homemakers for the  
ERA began when Candy Davis  
testified at Colorado State  
Legislature ERA hearings last  
fall. The group formed to try  
to reach out to women who are  
afraid of or not aware of the  
ERA as well as to let legis-  
lators know that homemakers  
do support it.  

Some basic beliefs of Home-  
makers for the ERA are “that  
a woman should be able to  
choose to work in her home or  
outside of it with no stigma  
attached to either choice...that  
the homemaker makes an  
important contribution to our  
society which must be recog-  
nized...that passage of the  
Equal Rights Amendment will  
both raise the homemaker's  
status and strengthen the  
family unit.”  

To accomplish these ends the  
group works out of a speakers  
bureau and contributes its  
help to the ERA Colorado  
Coalition. There are no regular  
meetings and people wishing  
to contribute time, money,  
and/or energy to this group  
can write to the  
address.  

Boulder Socialist/  
Feminist Union  
Boulder, CO  

The Boulder Socialist/  
Feminist Union is a recently  
formed study/action group.  
The Union now includes 16  
women who are mainly dedi-  
cating themselves at this time  
to “working on becoming a  
collective” i.e. understanding  
and implementing collective  
process. For this reason, the  
Boulder Socialist/Feminist  
Union is presently a closed  
collective.  

The group’s dual function  
includes reading and studying  
feminist works and carrying  
out actions that touch on  
issues of importance to  
women. These actions usually  
(though not always) take the  
form of guerrilla theatre. The  
group’s philosophy is that  
their actions and their theatre  
should grow directly out of  
their own lives. According to  
Union spokespersons, the  
group is not designed to  
organize “others” or “the  
masses” but to develop ac-  
tions around and understand  
those things that affect the  
lives of women in the group.  
Yet, the group feels their  
theatre pieces do touch the  
lives of many other women.  
Recently the group has been  
involved in doing impromptu  
guerrilla theatre actions in  
grocery stores. When asked  
where the group planned to do  
future actions, one member of  
the group responded, “Any-  
where we're not invited.”  
The Boulder Socialist/Fem-  
inist Union already has several  
short pieces in its repertoire.  
Topics that the group’s the-  
atre pieces touch on are,  
“housewives and the econ-  
omic buy-off”, socialization  
and sex roles, a “professional  
feminist” who buys into the  
capitalist system, a lesbian  
“coming out”, a woman con-  
fronting a labor union, and a  
woman seeking childcare.  
The Union has performed at  
several women’s functions.  
Among these: at Colorado  
University on International  
Women’s Day, at the Boulder  
Resource Center, and at the  
Woman to Woman/Big Mama  
Rag International Women’s  
Day Mini-Festival. For further  
information about the group,  
contact Debbie Taylor at  
443-6658.  

Woman’s Line  
Boulder, CO  
phone—492-8910  

The Women’s Line is a crisis  
intervention and short-term  
counseling service geared to  
the needs of the women in the  
Boulder-Denver area.  

It is important for a woman to  
have some place to turn to in  
difficult times, to talk to  
someone with whom she can  
feel comfortable discussing  
her private feelings. Because  
women feel the most at ease  
discussing their personal pro-  
blems with other women, the  
Women’s Line staff is com-  
posed entirely of female vol-  
unteers. We provide an  
alternative to crisis lines  
aimed at the general public.

Women’s Resource Center  
Denver, CO  
phone—355-9785  

The Denver Women’s  
Resource Center is officially  
closed, yet the kind of energy  
it generated has not  
dissipated. When City and  
County funds were cut off in  
mid-May (see May issue of Big  
Mama), a number of inter-  
ested women responded by  
trying to open a new, and  
hopefully expanded women’s  
center.  
Although this group of  
women is not presently in a  
position to be able to do  
counseling or referrals on any  
kind of formal or organized  
level, they do need input from  
women who want to plan a  
Denver women’s center. If you  
would like to work on the  
planning committee (called  
the Women’s Center Task  
Force), contact either Lou at  
674-6223 or Susan at 355-9785.  
Regular planning meetings  
have already started.  

Future  
The group is busy reviewing  
the Resource Center’s past (its  
successes, limitations and  
past structures) as a way to  
discuss how best to meet the  
needs of women in Denver in  
the future. It is also reviewing  
the kind of thrust and prior-  
ities the Resource Center had  
in the past. Basically, the  
main thrust of the Resource  
Center was in the area of  
employment and career coun-  
seling. Yet, it also provided  

workshops and discussions on  
a regular basis on topics of  
vital interest to the lives of  
women.  

Now, discussions are arising  
as to the need and advisability  
of expanding the scope of the  
defunct Resource Center. The  
group has written up a very  

complete list of important  

areas for referrals and couns-  

eling and hopes to soon get  

input on exactly where a  
woman can turn when she has  
a given problem, question or  
crisis. In other words, the list  
needs to be filled in with  
specifics.  

Some of the areas on the list  
include housing, food, cloth-  
ing, health care, dealing with  
physical assault, children's  
needs, legal aid, achieving  
career satisfaction, better  
personal functioning, comm-  
unication with other women,  
achieving independence in  
daily living, home manage-  
ment, being a parent, mar-  
riage, alternative lifestyles,  
women’s minds,  
bodies, and outreach.  
Questions around funding,  
structure, priorities, soliciting  
community support etc. are  
now beginning to surface and  
promise to continue needing  
answers from any women who  
feel willing and competent.  
At present, most input has  
been from past volunteers and  
clients of the Resource Center.  
Yet input from all interested  
women in the community is  
being solicited.

2760 29th St  
Boulder, CO  

Boulder County Planned  
Parenthood, a chapter of  
Rocky Mountain Planned Par-  
enthood, provides complete  
medical and counseling ser-  
vices for women on a sliding  
fee scale. Included in its  
services are treatment of  
vaginal infections and vener-  
eal disease; Pap smears;  
breast examinations; preg-  
nancy tests; counseling for  
teenagers, “problem preg-  
nancies”, vasectomies, and  
abortions; educational prog-  
rams for schools, community  
groups and other interested  
people, as well as birth control  
and family planning  
programs.  

Boulder Planned Parenthood  
was founded in 1964 and  
served approximately 200 pa-  
tients. It was housed in the  
Boulder City-County Health  
Department and was run by an  
all volunteer staff. In 1973  
continued growth necessitated  
a move to larger quarters so  
that year it relocated on the  
second floor of the Grasser  
Building at 2760 29th Street.  
That same year a satellite  
program was opened in Long-  
mont. During 1975 the staff  
and volunteers provided med-  
ical care to 3,139 women.  

Due to its continued growth  
and the high rental rates in  
Boulder, it was decided that  
Planned Parenthood should  
purchase a building. Prelim-  
inary investigation indicates  
that the purchase price for a  
building with approximately  
2,500 square feet of space,  
good visibility, parking and  
patient access will be $60,000  
to $90,000. The Boulder  
chapter has therefore just  
initiated its New Building  
Fund Campaign in order to  
raise the $40,000 necessary to  
meet the down payment and  
remodeling costs.  

If you would like to donate to  
the building fund or to the  
general operating fund please  
send a check to Rocky Moun-  
tain Planned Parenthood, 2760  
29th Street, Boulder, CO  
80301. Make checks payable  
to Rocky Mountain Planned  
Parenthood/Building fund or  
RMPP/General fund respec-  
tively. If you would like to  
volunteer or have any quest-  
ions please call 447-1040.
