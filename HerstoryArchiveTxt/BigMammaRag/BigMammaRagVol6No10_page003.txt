Help Out!

Gear Sisters,

By request, took 72 photographs
of the Northwest Women's Music Fest-
ival held July 7, 8, 9, in Portland,
Oregon to be used for the Scribe, an
alternative newspaper in Portland.
These negatives were stolen (or acci-
dentally taken) from a locked darkroom
in Portland the following week.

There is a cardinal rule among pro-
fessional photographers: Never allow
a roll of exposed film out of your
possession. I feel very responsible
to the women whom I photographed,
made agreements with, and in some
cases, arranged for trades. Women I
photograph trust me and I want to go
on earning that trust. All I can say
to them now is that I have learned a
hard, sad lesson. Never allow your
negatives to leave your hands.

And to the wo/man who took those 72
negatives, I strongly request that
all of my negatives be returned to me
as soon as possible. No questions
will be asked. Please protect them
from scratches by placing them in
protective sleeves or separating them
from each other with paper. And put
cardboard with them to protect them
in mailing. Please do not cut them
to less than three on a strip. Send
them first class to me: Ruth Mountain-
grove, Box 56, Wolf Creek, Oregon,
97497. If you are a sister or brother
who knows the person who has them,
please persuade them to return my
negatives to me at once.

Thank you,
Ruth

Sub Anyone?

Dear Big Mama Rag,

I would like to subscribe to your
magazine for one year. It's only one
year because hopefully by next Sept-
ember I'll be striding the halls of
academia doing graduate work in wo-
men's studies.

Right now I am successfully employ-
ed so I've decided to tithe my income
and send some to you and to Quest.

So if I'm not fired you'll be getting
a little extra money.

Anyway, best of luck with your mag-
azine, I hope my contribution helps.

Praise!

Dear BMR,

I wanted to let you know how much I
liked your last issue and in partic-
ular, the cover drawing by Constance
Perenyi. It was good to read her
accompanying article which spoke about
what the image means to her and how
it has changed through time. This is
a process too rarely shared.

I look forward to seeing more of her
work in upcoming issues.

Sincerely,
Pearl

Pent Up Player

Dear BMR,

I'm not sure you'll remember me,
but several months ago you did a
telephone interview with three "in-
mates” from C.W.C.I. in Canon City.
Well, I was the one who talked with
you initially...my name, Sherran
Reynolds.

Now I find myself in a persecuted
situation in Boulder County Justice
Center. I was temporarily released
from C.W.C.I. on July 31 to Empathy
House here in Boulder for an interim
period until I was to meet the Parole
Board in October.

On September 12 I was arrested for
violating community placement rules.
The charges were not presented to me
until today...13 days later. Not
even the staff here was aware of why
I was being held. The charges con-
sisted of: association with a known
felon -- I was purchasing a car from
Northglenn Dodge...the salesman (a
total stranger) happened to be on
parole; possession of alcoholic
beverages-- a female staff member
at Empathy House put a six-pack of
Coors in my room until she got off
work (she's a friend of mine); and
last, but by no means least, cashing
two advance checks from work without
depositing the monies into my Empathy
House account. Empathy House allows
residents but 20 dollars per week to
live off of. So for all these nasty
deeds, Van Whisman, Parole Agent, has
vowed to send me back to Canon City
to possibly finish out my sentence
of nine more years! I ask you, is
this how society rehabilitates we
nasty convicts?

To make a long story even longer,
were I a man, this would not have
happened. I can cite several compar-
isons where the dude doesn't get
busted for a more serious violation
than the chick who does get P.V. ‘ci.

This has been a true “sore spot"
with me for quite a few months now,
and I feel something should be done
about it. Now we come to why I have
contacted you.

Juliet Wittman, my drama coach and
all-round best friend, felt there
should be some publicity on this sub-
ject; therefore, recommending I
contact only the best! You've done
wonders for the "Pent-Up Players", and
now I'm wondering if you'd be willing
to help those "pent-up"?

If this strikes a theatrical note
in your body, it's because it's been
scripted repeatedly...with women,
anyway. I truly hope you're interest-
ed in assisting us in this venture,
for without outside help, we'll
never be able to ameliorate repeti-
tion of this injustice.

I am looking forward to hearing from
you soon, and want to thank you in
advance for any time and consideration
you can give.

Sincerely,
Sherran L. Reynolds
Boulder, Colorado

be contacted through Big Mama, who
will definitely be following up this
story.)

New Group

Dear Big Mama,

Since moving from Phoenix to Denver
three weeks ago I've been trying to
find a feminist sobriety group. After
many futile calls I found only a
vacuum. I talked to one of the org-
anizers of L.U.N.A. and she suggested
I start my own group.

So...that's what I'm doing. I've
written to Creative Health and to
N.O.W., but the results are not yet
in so I'm not yet sure of the support
I'll have. I'd like to submit an
article to you in the near future on
women and alcohol and establish the
fact that there is a need for a
women's alcohol group that centers
around the political and personal
problems of women. Our drinking is a
logical extension of our oppression.

I'd also like the opportunity to
use your paper to see if there are
enough other feminist alcoholics in
the area to get a support group going.

If this seems OK to you please
get in touch with me at 534-8055 and
I'll get busy on an article. I'd
also appreciate any comments, advice,
contacts and/or moral support you
can offer.

Sincerely,
Kay Marie McPherson
