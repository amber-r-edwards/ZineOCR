racism and anti-semitism

A Jewish Woman Defines Her

Linnie Jennings

one Saturday afternoon
Jana took a hard look at her
self, turned her back to the
political left and briskly

struggle

walked away. She was both
sad, disheartened and deter-
mined. It was a difficult
choice. For many years her
allegiance was definite: she
objected to capitalism, im-
perialism, war and class str-
ucture. Jana was extremely
involved in political issues
per se. The women's movement
attracted her and she was in
a continuous state of
activism. The left wing gave

her a position to work from,
people to share common ideals,
strategies, successes and
failures... However, during
this period Jana did not feel
as though she were a complete
person. It was mis-
sing from her on many prof-

ound levels (political, so-
cial and spiritual). Her
friends could not be empathe-
tic to her needs, and the

conclusion that the left was
not as all-encompassing as
she'd let herself believe
became eminent.

At thirteen Jana became
an activist when she chose
not to sing Christmas carols
at a public school. Teachers
ignored the insolence not
wishing to call attention to
an obvious incident of insu-
rrection and friends simply
did not understand. Jana was
Jewish and this identity was
deeply engrained in her. As
she became more conscious of
political quests and more ma-
ture within the women's mov-
ement, capitalism and imperi-
alism grew distasteful. On
the other hand, Israel seemed
to appear as an imperialist
child of the American dream.
Israeli inflation was 100%,
war was a way of life and ca-
pitalism dogmatic. Her dis-
dain for capitalism and her
allegiance to the left was
victorious. Any Zionist fee-
lings were ignored.

As years went by and the
women's movement, along with
the left, began to develop
clear-cut factions within its
ranks, Jana was hard pressed
to find a niche for herself.
Anarchists, socialists, com-
munists; blacks, whites, br-
owns; were creating their
special platforms. Rallying
cries were more diverse and
the eighties were bringing a
decade of dichotomies. Jana
and other Jewish women found
themselves agreeing with all
factions, running back and
forth to each group as though
they were roving activists
bucking for "liberal of the
year" award. For the left wing
Zionism was still associated
with racism and anti-semitism
was merely an unfortunate, but
distant possibility.

Jana and other women began
to be exceedingly conscious
of anti-Zionism among their
peers. It became reality
that Israel was not being
criticized economically, so-
cially or politically--it was
being written off as racist
with the P.L.O. being given
martyrdom. This became fright-
ening to Jana. She felt a-
ctive in articulating her own
identity and ignoring Zionist
feelings instead of making
them blend with left wing
activity. In a sense she un-
wittingly had been allowing
the assimilation, death and
lack of development for her
own people to occur within
her lifestyle and among fri-
ends.
She and other women were
afraid of being branded par-
anoid in recognizing and co-
mmenting on anti-semitic re-
marks. Everyone, even the
left wing recognized the
dangers of anti-semitism on
the political level, especi-
ally with a Jewish holocaust
during this century so pow-
erfully engraved in human
memory. Yet, other forms of
anti-semitism were ignored. For example,
institutional anti-semitism
is a negative and hurtful
experience for many Jews.
The Christians with their
Christ-killer syndrome, pro-
selytizing and general need
to assimilate Jews (and oth-
ers) into Christianity is
seen as a ridiculous example
of anti-semitism by the left.
It is argued Christianity is
only trying to increase its
ranks, to survive. However,
negativism directed toward a
particular group to enhance
the "teaching group" can be
judged as having a holier-
than-thou attitude, which is

an aspect of racist/anti-se-
mitic logic. It must be tre-
ated as such, denounced and
not ignored, otherwise it fl-
ourishes. The left is guilty
of day-to-day anti-semitism
by wanting Jewish followers
of the left wing to become
so conscious of paranoia
they ignore negativism toward
their culture. Ignoring re-
marks and situations that
hurt one's identity, or dis-
respecting one's conscious-
ness as a group is dangerous.

Tokenism is another form of
anti-semitism. Liberals un-
wittingly are guilty of this
to a far greater extent than
leftists. The cliché, "some
of my best friends are Jew-
ish" is the first warning of
this type of anti-semitism.
When brought to the attenti-
on of leftists it is often
dismissed as being innocent.
Here is the danger this type
of anti-semitism holds: li-
berals are "nice" people,
but when a political, social
or economic point is contro-
versial the liberal straddi-
es the proverbial fence. If
your group happens to be in
the limelight, or popular
for the moment a liberal
will back you up. However,
if your group is obscure,
controversial or unpopular
a liberal will not stand be-
hind you (in fact a liberal
may not have even heard of
you). This lack of involve-
ment, or activism when it
is convenient holds seeds
of anti-semitism and racism.
Jana began to point out
anti-semitic comments as
they occurred in her daily
life and became understan-
ding toward culprits in the
sense that they did not re-
alize what was anti-semitic
to a Jew or society. Jana
discovered the real prob-
lem with anti-semitism was
not the actual experience
caused by people being anti-
semitic, but with Jews
being afraid to recognize
it as such or ignore it.
Paranoia can be a route to
higher consciousness if one
is articulate enough to
teach others about this form
of racism without being
condescending or didactic.

A good approach Jana found
was saying "that is a re-
mark I find distasteful and
degrading as a Jew. Do you
realize the implications of
what you just said? Please
deal with your anti-semitism."
In other words a Jew
cannot eradicate anti-semi-
tism, they can only identi-
fy it, avoid martyrdom and
bring it to the surface al-
lowing the gentile to rec-
ognize her/his anti-semitism
and constructively realign
her/his prejudice.

It is legitimate to cri-
ticize the Israeli govern-
ment for 100% inflation,
constant state of war, pov-
erty and class systems. How
ever, it is anti-semitic to
scream Zionism and insist
upon the political and ulti-
mate social assimilation of
the Jewish state for the
sake of a peaceful solution
to the Palestinian problem.
A sovereign state for the
Jewish people is a necessity
for Jewish survival. Jewish
culture should be kept alive.
Tradition, ethical codes,

religion and lifestyle may

progress and change of its
own accord, but a culture
must not be allowed to as-
similate totally within a
society bent on its demise
for convenience whether that
society is conscious of this
negativism or not. For the
Jew, Zionism is symbolic of
survival, identity and free-
dom. Zionist actions and
perspectives are not racist.
Is it racist to strive for
the sovereignty and survival
of one's people? However,
viewpoints (particularly from
the left) equate Zionism with
their own standard of poli-
tical opposition: capitalism,
imperialism and so on. Zion-
ism is the establishment of
and maintenance of a Jewish
homeland, not the purposeful
preservation of capitalism
and the systematic demise of
another culture. Although
the product of Zionism, Is-
rael, is capitalistic, the
entire movement should not
be criticized. Those Jews
and gentiles who disapprove
of Israeli government must
criticize accordingly. Ig-
noring Zionism, Jewish iden-
tity and anti-semitism is not
the way to accentuate one's
identity of culture; offering
criticism exactly where it is
needed is. Labeling and ster-
eotyping can be convenient
but hold danger and when
used against a particular
group is very close to rac-
ism. The left wing is guilty
of labeling and stereotyping
when they refuse to analyze
the Israeli/Zionist situati-
on. Furthermore, Jews are
being less than insightful
when they allow this to hap-
pen.

In conclusion, let us hope
the left will not be divided
into further political/soci-
al groups, since strength
lies in unity when political
power has not been as pro-
found as one would hope. Let
the left deal with its own
prejudice effectively with
Jewish factions within the
movement, taking initiative
in calling attention to anti-
semitic/anti-Zionist impro-
prieties. With these as our
goals the left will not be
losing anymore activists such
as Jana.

Black Women: Bringing It All Back Home

This marvelous little (48
page) book by two Black wom-
en, from Jamaica and the West
Indies, also includes a short

book review

article by Wilmette Brown,
from Black Women for Wages
for Housework (US), an intro-
duction by Solveig Francis,
Housewives in Dialogue (Eng-
land) and resolutions passed
at the International Women's
Year-National Women's Conf-
erence in Houston, Texas in
1977. The book was published
in 1980, and it really flows.
The women in the book des-
cribe their immigration from
their countries to England
and the US. The connections
that are made in this book
are good and many—that work-
ing hard, if you are Black or
poor white, no matter what
country you come from or go
to, doesn't get you far, the
rich profit not you—women do
double time, in this case,
cleaning other women's homes,
cleaning their own—the Black
woman being viewed as MAMMY.
“And we can see that inter-
nationally: the Black mammy
figure has become a person-
ification of all the house-
work, the labour, that Black
women had to do in those days
of slavery and continued to
do after the abolition of
slavery."

Black women were and are
“Involved in reproducing every
one, not only her own child-
ren and family but looking
after and raising men, other
women, herself—making sure
"...everyone was fit for
the next day." The Black
woman, having been raped and
exploited in slave days,
raising the master’s children
and running the house for
the mistress but also using
the mammy role to have ac-
cess to some food, clothing
and books ‘so that people
could learn to read, and
organizing in a struggle to
fight against the system of
slavery.

Prescod-Roberts talks about
her village in Barbados, she
and her family were brought
to the US by her grandmoth-
er's wages before the 60's.
She says that women care-
fully chose the father of
their child, if they chose to
have an owner or overseer as
the father that meant they
had wages for themselves and
security for the child, money
for shoes, books, new clothes.
Many women picked fathers for
their children according to
color—color was a factor in
wages, sometimes a lighter
skinned child would have a
better chance to get wages.
These women were not fools.
When you're functioning in a
situation of scarcity and
you have to worry every day
about how your children are
going to eat, and how you
are going to eat, you think
about these things. And you
organize your life in such a
way as to make sure you get
the money you must have; to
make sure you get what you
and your children need to
survive.

When a woman immigrated
she usually couldn't take
her family with her—so the
grandmother, aunt, mother or
sister would take her child-
ren until they could be sent
for. Women working in Europe
or the US would send money
home, although her wages
were small, and what she
would send insured her fam-
ily of food, clothes and
continuing education. The
women knew if they immigrat-
ed that their families were
safe, they would bring the
children over, if a man im-
migrated he might find a new
woman and begin a new family.
Your best bet was to get a
woman to go because you know
that a woman was tied to
her housework, the housework
of reproducing her kids back
home or her mother or her
grandmother or somebody in
the family. Tied to that
housework and feeling ident-
ified with it and feeling re-
sponsible to the point that
she got up off of that $30
and sent it back.

The racism that the women
and their children experien-
ced, the lack of an extended
family, as well as the house-
work outside and the house-
work inside, of watching your
children grow up with dif-
ferent attitudes—torn between

-K. Hefner/Lvs

cultures, of trying to learn
new ways and hold on to the
old ways is something that
many immigrants have had to
deal with, but it must be
extremely painful, exhaust-
ing and confusing.

The book closes with the
resolution concerning women,
welfare and poverty that
women worked hard to get
acknowledged and passed in
Houston, 1977. We know that
the struggles go on and that
since the resolution was
passed our government has
taken a definite stand
against the concerns of the
poor, of women and children.
The work of so many women
who defined what was and is
necessary for living has been
again crushed by a government
who didn't give a damn.
