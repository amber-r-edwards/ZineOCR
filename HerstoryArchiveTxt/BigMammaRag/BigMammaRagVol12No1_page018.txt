We are concerned that women’s/lesbian publications have often failed  
to reflect the experiences and viewpoints of Third World, working-  
class, and older women. We want CONDITIONS to include work in a  
variety of styles by both published and unpublished writers of many  
different backgrounds. We welcome submissions from all women who  
feel a commitment to women is an integral part of their lives.
