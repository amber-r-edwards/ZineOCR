national  
West Coast Women's Music Festival  

Barbara Gagliardi  

‘As a white woman, and one  
actively involved in the  
anti-racist actions at this  
year's West Coast Women's  
Music Festival, I would like  

culture  

to express my feelings and  
impressions of that event. I  
feel we must continue to cri-  
ticize our own events and  
projects to ensure that they  
may someday become what we  
claim them to be. As femin-  
ists, many of us state an  
anti-racist priority. Yet  
our movement continually  
falls short of achieving  
this end. I believe the ev-  
ents at the WCWMF mirror the  
realities occurring in many  
communities throughout the  
U.S., a fundamental rip-off  
of Third World culture and  
Third World women's energies  

From the outset, this was  
illustrated by the assumed  
"legitimacy" gained by cal-  
ling this event a "cultural"  
festival, despite the token  
commitment to the real stru-  
ggles of the Third World. It  
was illustrated by the rip-  
off of Third World women's  
energies in work exchange,  
requiring 15 hours of work,  
no partial work exchange,  
and no provision for one-day  
or weekend attendance. This  
excluded many working-class  
women who could not afford  
to take off 2 days from  
their jobs.  

But the rip-off was most  
acutely evident in the sup-  
posed "solidarity day" with  
Latin America. Let me desc-  
ribe the setting. The stage  
on which the events of soli-  
darity day were scheduled  
was located right next to  
the lake. It was situated in  
the play area, beer sold to  
the left, craftspeople set  
up nearby. Women attempting  
to speak of the very real  
struggles of people in Nicar-  
agua, Chile, El Salvador and  
Argentina were drowned out  
by splashing, frisbee-throw-  
ing and yelling of playing  
women throughout the play  
area in front of the stage.  
Those of us attempting to  
learn something of the strug-  
gles of women in Latin Ameri-  
ca had to struggle to catch  
the words above the clamor  
and distraction.  

In addition to the irony of  

-Tea Schook/BMR  
hearing about people dying in  
struggle while white women  
played, we were listening to  
white women speak of the  
struggles of our Latina sis-  
ters. (Two of the three speak-  
ers were white.) When con-  
fronted on the whys of the  
decision to have white women  
speak, the reply was to pro-  
tect the emotional security  
of white women, for they  
would be more likely to lis-  
ten to other white women. The  
old "let's take care of  
whites," when the reality was  
most of them weren't listen-  
ing anyway. All of this was  
scheduled on a side stage,  
while the main stage remained  
unused.  

As soon as the Latina bands  
arrived, however, and began  
to play some music, all of a  
sudden, there was white int-  
erest everywhere. Latinas  
came and gave their all,  
their performances were won-  
derful, and white women dan-  
ced and sang and enjoyed.  
Listen to the reality of  
struggle and death in Latin  
America? NO, but when it came  
to the music, white women  
were there, for after all,  
this was a "solidarity day."  

I sat there so angry I  
could barely speak. White wo-  
men so willing to rip off the  
music, the fun, the rich cul-  
tural tradition of the Third  
World, to imitate in their  
movements their imagined por-  
trayal of African dancing,  
and so unable, or unwilling,  
to see their lack of commit-  
ment to Third World struggle,  
to deaths that were occurring  
while they danced. It was a  
sideshow for white women's  

amusement, for after all,  
they were "giving" Latin Ame-  

rica a solidarity day, were  
n't they? The well-worn  
pattern--Third World women  
give, white women benefit,  
and walk away "legitimizing"  
their experience, because  
it is supposedly "anti-rac-  
ist."  

A small group of Latinas  
and supporters wrote a short  
statement on the racism and  
classism occurring at the  
festival, announcing a meet-  
ing the following day for  
those concerned. When they  
attempted to gain access to  
the main stage that night,  
they were met with increased  
security and a refusal to  
have their statement read.  
One Latina was escorted from  
the land. Of their efforts,  
only a brief announcement of  
the following day's meeting  
was allowed. When asked the  
next day, the reason given--  
their statement was "inappr-  
opriate at that time."  

The next day many of us  
met. The group was very  
large--women of color, Jew-  
ish women and white women  
expressing our concerns. In  
that meeting many details of  
the racism and classism of  
the festival were shared--  

america held hostage  

differential treatment of  
white women and women of  
color who had lost their  
tickets, avoidance and de-  
layal of contracts for the  
kitchen and child care  
staffs, differential treat-  
ment of the various perform-  
ers of color, and more. The  
group decided to split, to  
write two statements, one  
from the women of color, the  
other from Jewish and white  
women, to be read on stage  
that night. Meetings occurred  
throughout the day, and the  
two statements were written.  
When we gathered together  
again, to share our state-  
ments, it emerged that both  
groups were voicing the same  
concerns. As Rosa Maria, a  
Puerto Rican woman said,  
truth was on our side, and  
we marched to the stage,  
with a sense of joy and con-  
nectedness.  

With some resistance, we  
were eventually able to gain  
access to the stage. Three  
women (Black, Latina and  
white) voiced our concerns  
to the audience. Their stat-  
ements were of pulling us

After further disabling the already ineffective Occupa-  
tional Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), Raygun set  

out to take workers another 40  

years back by lifting the  

ban on industrial work in the home. The ban, which was im-  
posed in the early 1940s and established minimum wage and  
hour standards, has been credited with ending slave-wage,  

home-labor exploitation of women and children. OSHA is the  

federal group workers can call  

to complain about unsafe  

working conditions. Can't quite imagine workers wanting to  
invite OSHA into their homes anyway. . . The 22 million  
Americans currently receiving food stamps can expect another  

federal visitor on their doorsteps:  

fraud investigators. The House  

gun-toting, food stamp  
created the posse and is  

sending them out to arrest anyone suspected of trying to  

rip-off the food stamp program.  

Raygun has given the CIA the  
go-ahead to “infiltrate and  
influence domestic dissident  
organizations" and has done  
nothing to stop the FBI's  
counter-intelligence pro-  
gram directed against “dis-  
sident" organizations,  
COINTELPRO. COINTELPRO,  
according to Amnesty Inter-  

national, has fabricated evidence  

and used other means to put the leaders  

of Black, Native American, Hispanic and other "anti-  
establishment" groups behind bars. But don't despair,  
Nan-See's shiny china wasn't even scorched in the fire  
at the Lennox China Factory - only a few firemen were  

damaged.
