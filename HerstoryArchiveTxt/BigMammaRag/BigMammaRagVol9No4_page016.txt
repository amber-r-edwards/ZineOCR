S&M — from page 2

playing. S&M is dominant-
submissive, active-passive,
psychodrama, conscious play.
Nothing can happen in an S&M
encounter that you don't
want to happen (unless one
or both partners have a fear
of their desires - fear
tends to mean a breakdown in
communication and without
communication you're unlikely
to get what you want in any
sexual experience.)

S&M is not rape as nothing
is happening against the will
of anyone involved. S&M is
not aggression as there is
no hate or contempt involved.

The difference between S&M
sex and Sexual Assault is a
matter of CONSENT, and con-
sent makes all the difference
in the world. Maybe I can
bring it all closer to home
by being more specific with
what constitutes S&M behavior.
I believe that most of us
have been involved in one
form of S&M experience or an-
other, though we wouldn't
want to label it as such. S&M
activity includes an incred-
ible range of expressions.
Everything from a simple
tickling or wrestling ses-
sion to whippings and water-
sports. How many of us haven't
enjoyed and been excited
by a bite on the neck, a
little bondage, "dirty" talk,
orders, some form of mock
force? So maybe it's all a
matter of definition or de-
gree. Ever play a game of
teacher-student with your
lover? How about some plain
old "rough" sex? What about
the joys of anal sex? The
fact is, that most Lesbian
sex consists of what we call
“taking turns". That means
that one person is active,
one passive and then the
roles reverse. Many of us
have a preference for either
an active (dominant) or a
passive (submissive) role,
which may change in the
course of a lifetime, or
from one relationship to the
next, or even within a sin-
gle sexual expression. It's
a myth that "Once an S, al-
ways an S" or "Once an M,
always an M".

Here's another myth: "S&M
People don't enjoy 'normal'
sex, tenderness, gen-
tleness, lovingness". The
reality is that we are all
capable of enjoying a wide
range of sexual-sensual ex-
pression, and people who
act out on their S&M fanta-
sies don't need or desire
them 100% of the time or
even a majority of the time.
Myth: "S&M dynamics are
carried out throughout all
levels of the person's life
and relationships." Not
true of people of high con-
sciousness. S&M Lesbian
Feminists tend to be quite
aware of power roles and
quite sensitive to issues
of equality in relationships
and thus have a great deal
of respect for an individual's
rights and freedoms.

Another myth: "Once a Les-
bian Feminist (or anyone)
gives in to her fantasies
she totally succumbs to and
perpetuates an overall life-
style of traditional patri-
archal roles". Not true.
Lesbian Feminists more than
anybody recognize a patri-
archal set-up when they see
one and will do their best to
resist and fight it. She is
not likely to perpetuate
actual male supremacy in her
relationships, work situa-
tion, or political activity.

ning throughout every pro-
sadomasochism article that:
is "try it, you'll like it".
That every woman who has
been involved in a lesbian
S&M relationship has become
sexually free, healthier
people, and every woman who
rejects S&M is sexually
repressed, and afraid of
their "dominant-submissive
fantasies", and when they
conquer those fears they'll
see the light and become
healthier, sexually free
people.

First thing I'd like to
say is I have been involved
in a lesbian S&M relation-
ship. I am also a woman who
has recognized my dominant-
submissive fantasies, I am
not the least bit afraid of
them, but I do not accept
S&M as a feminist lifestyle.

Feminism means fighting
oppression, not just by or-
ganizing conferences and pro-
tests, doing speaking engage-
ments and writing articles,
but also examining how we have
bought into our oppression in
the way we live, and changing
ourselves. For instance, as
feminists, we know that we

cannot fight this hierarchi-
cal (racist, sexist, class-
ist) system with another
hierarchical system, so we
work in collective

equal" in the collective
process, we work hard at chang-
ing, becoming more assertive,
less passive, listening.

Donna lists some "myths"
about S&M in her article:
S&M dynamics are carried out
throughout all levels of the
person's life and relation-
ships. Not true, she says,
of people of high conscious-
ness. Another is, Once a
lesbian (or anyone) gives in
to her fantasies, she total-
ly succumbs to and perpetu-
ates an overall lifestyle
of traditional patriarchal
roles. And in response to
that "myth" goes on to say,
She is not likely to perpe-
tuate actual male supremacy
in her relationships, work
situations, or political acti-
vity. And then, it's not
really Liberation we're
fighting for if we have to
change something as intimate
as our sexual expression to
do it.

All of us who have become
lesbians and/or feminists
have changed our sexual ex-
pression along the way in our
fight toward liberation. We
all have suffered such pain
from sexual oppression that
how can we stop examining
our relationships at the
moment we "come out".
A good example of the dan-
gers of putting relationships
off limits is a working
situation I was in
in a feminist project. Working on the
same project were two women
who were lovers and into
roles. We all said we were
committed to an anti-hierar-
chical process and were
committed to using criticism
to help us in that process.
When they were confronted on
how their role playing was
affecting the project they
said the same thing, their
relationship is not open for
criticism, even though it
affected the project to the
point where criticism and
trust had ceased and the
project was in danger of fal-
ling apart.

I know from experience that
I never in role playing
reached that “high conscious-
ness" so that role playing
didn't extend throughout
our relationship. These wo-
men, committed feminists
though they were, never

reached that "high conscious-
ness" either. And to say

it didn't affect our poli-
tics or activities just isn't
true. In no way can anybody
say what two people do in
bed, or behave toward each
other doesn't affect their
relationships with other
people, their work situation
or political activities.

So what do we do? I do not
believe there are "good"
fantasies and "bad" fanta-
sies, I'm not giving tips on
any of mine. What we cannot do —
is reinforce and create these
fantasies as something to
live by either. What has
helped me in dealing with
fantasies is to examine where
they are coming from:

My favorite fantasy is that
I meet some man in an eleva-
tor, we fall madly in love
at first sight, instantly
decide to run off together,
leave straight from the ele-
vator to someplace interest-
ing to live, raise kids,
live in heterosexual (read
acceptable) love and harmony
for the rest of our lives
and die at the same instant
so that we never have a mom-
ent of pain. I savor this
fantasy whenever I get sick
of the hatred there is for

Psychodrama in Lesbian sex
does not give men power over
women.

Images of violence and ac-
tual violence in our society
horrify me as well. I con-
demn and fight rape, humili-
ation, harassment, war,
brutality, sexism, hetero-
sexism, racism, classism,
ageism and the system that
oppresses all of us. I am
a woman committed to break-
ing the cycles of violence.
I know very well the diff-
erence between being raped
and being loved. And I can
tell you from personal ex-
perience that there are no
similarities between being
raped and acting out a rape
fantasy with a lover. The
most important issues in
S&M sex are Consciousness
(awareness and an acceptance
of self), Consent and Com-
munication. Some people go
to a lot of trouble plan-
ning an entire script for a
single sexual experience. Of
course if you are not com-
fortable with dominant-sub-
missive fantasies, you real-
ly have no business being
involved in it, at least
not until you get over your
fears and apprehensions. As
I've said before, it's the

fears that cause the prob-
lems and the breakdown in
communication, not the fan-
tasies themselves.

This need by some feminists
(and gay activists too) to
“clean up" our communities
and sexual expressions looks
very much like a right wing
moral majority approach.
We're buying into a puritan
image of sexuality within
the Lesbian world. We want
to make our community
"acceptable" in hopes of
gaining our long-awaited
rights and freedoms in main-
stream society. So, we hide,
deny or denounce those in
our community who don't mea-
sure up as “pure lovers in
the ancient Amazon woman-
spirit". So what about the
non-monogamists, the Lesbian
separatists, the prostitutes,
the transvestites, the trans-
sexuals, etc, etc.? Do we
not claim these "bastard"
members of our community? I
can tell you now that our
movement power would proba-
bly be cut in half if all of
these people were suddenly
ousted from our ranks. I'll
tell you something else sis-
ters, none of us are free
until all of us are free
and it's not really libera-

tion we're fighting for if
we have to change something
as intimate as our sexual
expression to do it. See my
point? Let's not settle for
token privilege for the few
when there are deeper prin-
ciples at stake.

You have the right to dis-
like my sexual expression (as
a straight person doesn't
need to like my lesbianism),
but you don't have the right
to deny me my right to my
sexual expression and you
won't be able to hide us for
long.

I suppose that Andrena Za-
winski would prefer we stifle
our desires or at least feel
ashamed of them "like a good
Feminist should". But, no
change or freedom ever came
from repression or shame.

Watch out Andrena. Some of
our most revolutionary,
creative and articulate leaders
in our movement enjoy a lit-
tle bondage and disciplining
at the end of a long hard
day of working for your free-
dom of choice and mine! Ac-
cording to Ian Young (Lavender
Culture, P.104): “Involvement
in S&M tends to take away a
person's need to op-
press and be oppressed,
manipulate and be manipulated

socially and politically -
another reason why political-
power-trippers tend to opp-
ose it strongly. S&M can be
part of an outright rebellion
against social, structural-
ized oppression, which again
is part of the reason anar-
chists and libertarians are
overrepresented among S&M
people.”

And by Lyn Rosen (also Lav-
ender Culture, P.106): “Based
on this feminist principle,

I believe that the person who
is not sexually free is a
danger politically. The person
who understands himself
or herself best will make
the person best suited to make
political decisions wisely.
Such a person may not always
agree with me politically;
however, I trust least the
person who neither knows nor
wishes to explore his or her
sexual self."

Just remember - Conscious-
ness, Consent and Communica-
tion are essential.

In conclusion - Yes Virginia,
you can be a politically
correct S or M!

my sexuality and my womanness
when I get bone tired of
fighting for my liberation
and of all responsibility
that entails. Acting out this
fantasy with anyone would not
take the bitterness out of
the reality of my life and
would certainly not encourage
me to examine the self-hatred
this fantasy, as pleasant as
I find it, really embodies.
That fantasy is a reaction

in me from the scars of liv-
ing in an oppressive society, in
reaction to the difficulty I
have in building relationships. 
We need to develop
means to get to the root of
our fantasies and decide from
those roots what we want for
our future, what changes we
want to create, and for me it
certainly is not acting out
that fantasy.

Setting ourselves up into
S&M and role playing rela-
tionships and then saying
that part of our life is
completely off limits to ex-
amination and criticism fits
closely a "person who neither
knows nor wishes to explore
his or her sexual self." A
structure for exploring our
sexual self is criticism,
not uncritical support. If
we are sincere in our endea-
vors to get to the root of
our feelings, women should be
exploring their feelings with
each other. "Submissives"
with "submissives" and “dom-
inants" with "dominants"
need to get with each other
not "S's" with "M's" who will
only reinforce each other in
the same old feelings, in-
stead of getting to the root
of those feelings.
Sadomasochism is not a fem-
inist lifestyle, it endangers
our ability to love and to
work together in an anti-
hierarchical process. As femin-
ists how can we not demand
of each other to be account-
able, how can we put any
part of our lives off limits
to examination? The fact
that we have been so oppres-
sed because of our sexuality
is exactly the reason we must
openly discuss our sexuality
to make sure we do not per-
petuate old habits and to
demand change of each other.
These demands are not made
out of any desire to fit in
or be accepted by any “main-
stream" society. As radical
feminists we have rejected
mainstream society as having
any answers or place for all
of us. We have the right to
demand change of each other

when our actions endanger
our abilities as feminists.
The obligations we have as
feminists are to openly ex-
amine and analyze our lives
and to make changes to
strengthen us, and this in-
cludes struggling through
and rejecting on all levels

our tendency, regardless of
how "consensual” it is, to
embrace any hierarchical
relationship, such as role
playing and sadomasochism.
