BMR as Required  
Reading  

Dear Sisters at BMR,

I am furious at Judge Sirica's  
decision that your paper is not  
“Educational.” I have decided to  
use it as required reading in my two  
sections of "Introduction to the  
Women's Movement" class to demon-  
strate just how educational it is.  
(The Sacto. Women's Center Bookstore  
will be sending you an order for 80  
copies of one of your issues soon.)

I want you to be able to use this  
information (that your paper is being  
used as a textbook in a college  
course) in any way that you can. I  
would also like to send a letter to  
Judge Sirica giving him this infor-  
mation, and will write to anyone  

else that you suggest.

Please write and send me names and  
addresses of people I should write to.  
Please stay afloat. We need you.  
Your paper has some of the best news  
and theory of any of the papers we  
have.

Love and Sisterhood,

Dr. Sally Wagner, Ph.D.

To Keep Fighting  

Dear BMR,

Enclosed is $9.00. $6.00 is for  
a subscription and $3.00 is a monthly  
pledge. It's really all I can afford  
at this point, but I will send you  
$3.00 a month for at least the next  
year.

I really appreciate the clarity  
and honesty of your work. Thank you  
for your tremendous efforts to give  
us our news and the information we  
need so much to keep on fighting.

Women in Prison  

Dear Sisters,

I am incarcerated in the Clinton  
Correctional Institution for women.  
I do not earn enough to subscribe to  
your paper, but I would appreciate it  
if you would send me any additional  
copies you may have.

Sincerely yours,  
Rae

COLLECTIVE  

BLN Celebration  

Dear BMR Staff,

This letter is in response to the  
article on the BLN Anniversary Cele-  
bration that you printed in the July  
issue of BMR. Many women in the BLN  
have expressed disappointment and con-  
cern over the treatment of the article  
we submitted. There was considerable  
discrepancy between the original arti-  
cle we sent in and the clumsily edited  
copy that appeared in the paper.

It was our understanding that there  
might be space limitations that would  
necessitate cutting the length of the  
original article. This is why we spe-  
cifically requested that the background  
information about the organization be  
dropped, rather than the schedule of  
events for the celebration. However,  
the careless and haphazard editing by  
the BMR staff rendered the final arti-  
cle not only incoherent, but also mis-  
leading. Many of the important activi-  
ties included in the day's events were  
not mentioned. Four workshops and an  
afternoon picnic with a variety of  
entertainment were obliterated. Also,  
no mention was made of several of the  
special services that were being pro-  
vided. We think these were serious  
omissions.

We understand the monumental task  
that faces the BMR staff each month in  
assembling each issue of the paper. In  
many ways we are impressed with the job  
you do. But we also noticed that in  
the July issue there was some backslap-  
ping and self-congratulation for the  
staff for having expanded the size of  
this issue. We think you should re-  
examine your priorities and be care-  
ful not to promote quantity at the sa-  
crifice of quality.

The BLN had anticipated printing pro-  
blems with the straight press, but we  
were counting on BMR to help us publi-  
cize an event of significance and im-  
portance to all lesbians on the front  
range. The fact that you placed such  
little interest on this same event is  
a disappointment to the BLN, and a dis-  
service to the lesbian community.

Sincerely,  
Anna Lee  
for the Boulder Lesbian Network  

Editor's Note: We felt that by run-  
ning the information about the BLN  
Celebration in our June and July  
calendars and on the front page of  
our July issue, we were giving the  
event adequate coverage.

Conference on Violence  

Against Women  

Dear Sisters,

There have been several murmurs of  
concern within the women's community  
regarding the National Conference on  
Violence Against Women. It is hoped  
that with this letter any questions  
or concerns will be cleared.

The Conference is being held in  
Denver, October 2-5 at the Executive  
Tower Inn. Safe House for Battered  
Women, Denver, and Metropolitan State  
College are the co-sponsors. Safe  
House could not have sponsored this  
conference by ourselves as it would  
have been a very expensive endeavor.

Metropolitan State College is covering  

the costs (printing brochures, mail-  
ings, room/board/transportation for  
keynote speakers, honorarium for  

workshop facilitators, reserving and  

arranging for the Executive Tower Inn)  

while Safe House is organizing the  
actual conference program.

In an attempt at being sensitive to  
the needs of the women's community, we  

are arranging scholarships, housing  
and child care.  
Scholarships--Penny Crews  
Child Care--Muriet Arvay  
Housing--Diann Shannon  

The fee for the Conference is high  
in order that we will at least break  
even. If we make money, then Safe  
House will receive this for shelter/  
outreach services for the coming year.

It is our belief that women and/or  
agencies which can afford to pay do  
so. Those who cannot afford to pay,  
should not; therefore, we have the  
scholarship committee.

The Housing Committee was set up  
for women from out-of-town who could  
not afford to stay at the Executive  
Tower. Conference rooms at the Tower  
are free if a certain number of rooms  
are used for the conference. Again,

Nationwide Readership  

Dear BMR,

I was happy to receive your July  
issue. I thought your coverage of  
International Children's Year was  
thoughtful and important. Unfortunately,  
as far as I've seen the IYC, unlike the IWY (International Women's  
Year) has been ignored in the femi-  
nist press. I would like to congrat-  
ulate your decision to expand your  
coverage and issue. I was a sub-  
scriber who allowed my sub to expire--  
quite frankly because there was not  
enough in your paper to interest me,  
a New Yorker. By expanding your cov-  
erage you will hopefully be able to  
attract more nationwide readership.

I for one am renewing my sub at the  
sustainer rate. I would also appre-  
ciate it if you would send me a copy  
of your June issue if you still have  

a copy hanging around. The article  
on "Dissolution in the Women's Move-  
ment" seems to be an important one.

I for one have been generally disen-  
chanted as a feminist for about a year  
and a half. I have not been involved  
in any group since I graduated from  
college and entered a small southern  
law school in a very small town. I  
could use some good analyses to help  
me figure out what the hell happened--  
and what the hell I can do to help it  
unhappen.
