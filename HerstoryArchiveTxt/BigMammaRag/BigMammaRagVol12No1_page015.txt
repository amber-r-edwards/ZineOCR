Punishment For Political Q: Child Loss

(This article was edited
from the Committee Against
the Kidnapping of Tina
Fishman's Daughter Newslet-
ter. Compiled by Joan

Pettijohn)

In August, 1981, Tina
Fishman's daughter was first
kidnapped from her by the
state and put in the custo-

court abuse

dy of her ex-husband, Ted,
on the grounds that her po-
litical activities consti-
tuted an “emergency situa-
tion." (see July, 1983 is-
sue BMR) At that time, al-
though the court admitted
that the child, Riva, was
"unquestionably well-cared-
for," it found Tina guilty
of "having interests other
than parenting." Tina Fish-
man is a supporter of the
Revolutionary Communist
Party and at that time
faced felony charges as a
Mao Tsetung defendant for a
demonstration that took
place in 1979 (these char-
ges were later dropped).

As Tina stated in a recent
letter, "the attack was not
only aimed at me...but was
also calculated to deliver
a vicious message to women
who dare to take responsi-
bility for the direction of
society and the world."

The judge decided that
Riva's “best interests"
would be served if she
lived with her father, who
works for Lockheed in pro-
duction of the Trident and
Cruise missiles. The judge
ruled for Ted because he
will provide "a stable,
safe, religious and orderly
environment in an attrac-
tive, comfortable community."
The court makes its point
clear: anyone who rejects
the American dream is ob-
viously an unfit parent.

On September 22, 1983,
Illinois judge Richard Jor-
zak ruled in his "final"
custody hearing. After a
four-day hearing during
which Ted Fishman was not
able to present any evid-
ence of a change of circum-
stances, which is required
for a change in custody,
and during which numerous
witnesses gave powerful tes-
timony as to why Riva should
be returned to her mother,
the judge ruled, with no
explanation, to extend tem-
porary custody to Ted Fish-
man until June, 1984.

After two months of open-
ly flaunting the highly

allowed, the politics of
the oppression of women and
of traditional American
family values were very
much at issue in this court-
room. The judge made his
political point clear: can
this woman be a fit mother
who deliberately works part-
time in order to devote ma-
jor energies to revolutionary
activity, who is not
the least bit god-fearing
or anchored to the home,
and who has raised her child
to be concerned about events
in society and the world?

At this time, the best
way to bring an appeal is
being investigated. It is
crucial that supporters
continue to be part of the
process, expanding exposure,

political nature of this
case, Judge Jorzak appar-
ently decided that the im-
age of the court as "unbi-
ased arbiter" had better be
cleaned up. Gone was the
freewheeling atmosphere of
a political witch hunt that
had made up most of the ear-
lier hearings, with every
aspect of Tina's political
activities and beliefs un-
der scrutiny. When Ted's
lawyer began grilling Tina
with questions like: "Do
you attend RCP meetings?
Are your friends RCP sup-
porters?" Jorzak quickly
ushered all attorneys into
his chambers to make it
clear that "politics" were
not the issue here, at
least in this blatant way.

The "politics" of this
hearing were to revolve a-
round "the best interests
of the child" and not to
"right any wrongs." The
judge focused the entire
hearing on a three-day vi-
sit between Tina and her
daughter, during which Riva
was upset, ran away, and was
put in a foster home. An
"expert" witness appointed
by the court said that Riva
now says that she hates her
mother, without reason, and
her repetition of this
phrase sounded like a lesson
learned by constant dril-
ling. Another witness, a
social worker, testified
that she was "disgusted" by
the sexual stereotypes ram-
pant in Ted's household and
recommended that Riva be
returned to her mother. Des-
pite this obvious manipula-
tion of Riva by her father,
and all of the testimony,
the judge sent her back to
live with Ted.

Although the judge insis-
ted that "no politics were

Well, it's now the big '84. And Big Bro is watching you,
now more than ever. We are told that the economy is on an
upswing & the unemployment rate is falling. But be wary,
an independent report from the Nat'l Planning Assoc.
(authored by an economic prof at Vanderbilt U) says that
things ain't really so rosy. Millions of workers will
face hard times throughout the decade--chronic unemploy-
ment or poverty wages. Which is what we have now for too
many workers.

RayGun's boy, Eddie Meese certainly re-
flects the rich's attitude toward unem-
ployed/low-paid workers when he said
people go to soup kitchens because
the food is free & that's easier
than paying for it. It came
as a surprise to him that
people in the GOLP (Good Ole
Land of Plenty) were starving.
So RayGun got out his trusty pencil
& appointed a commission to find out
if Americans are suffering from hunger
and why. Wait for results in January but don't hold your
breath to hear what the boys have to say.

Suddenly I don't
feel like dancing.

Set aside to help states & local agencies distribute
surplus gov't food to the people. It's sitting in ware-
houses all over the country, while a good portion of US
people are hungry.

People on food stamps, unemployment comp., health care
are being urged to register to vote by the gov't workers
who process their applications. The people would be signed
to vote at the time & place they go to get their “benefits." 
All sorts of groups from Planned Parenthood, AFL-CIO,
NAACP, American Orthopsychiatric Assn, Puerto Rican Legal
Defense & Educational Fund & others are endorsing social
service workers to be volunteer voter registrars. Will won-
ders never cease!! Gov't coercion aided by a mixed bag of
self-interest groups. Will the people be harassed in order
to get their due?

The gov't was thinking of getting the Census Bureau to
open its records of people to other agencies. Up to now,
supposedly, all census info has been confidential. The
boys claim that it can save us money by sharing info by
opening census files. The oh so White House dropped the
idea, census revolts in W. Germany & Holland, where people
feared misuse of computerized data forced both countries
to postpone planned census.

Our New Year's wish to the gov't: May you all get tied
up with red tape, may all your forms be in quadruplicate,
may all your Top Secrets be exposed, may you barricade all
gov't buildings & secure yourselves inside—forever.

Our New Year's wish to us: Power to the People, Yah! 11!!!
