that they should be forgiven
for that. And women are being
less forgiving, is what I'm
saying. In fact, in one town
where I had lived some time
before, there are forty wo-
men's soccer teams. Young
women play soccer to get
physically tough so they can
resist rape...

Kim: Alright!!

Andrea: ...and resist preg-
nancy, which is often a con-
sequence of rape. These wo-
men are also learning karate.
It's a unique phenomenon that
I didn't find happening any-
where else in the country,
but people in the other
towns are beginning to hear
about it. (laughter)

Kim: It's an idea that
might catch on, huh?

Andrea: Possibly. People
are saying a lot of these
women are lesbians, and
that's no big deal to them.

Kim: What about lesbianism
in Peru?

Andrea: I specifically
looking for lesbian as-
pects of the feminist move-
ment, but I noticed that in
most places the women who
call themselves feminist and
who are actively committed to
working among women in poli-
tical projects are usually
women with a number of child-
ren and who are married or
divorced or separated. The
lesbian women I knew tended
not to be calling themselves
feminist, and tended to be
younger and single women.

Kim: Was there any discus-
sion, while we're on the to-
pic of sexuality, within
either the more broad-based
working class movement, or
among the women who call
themselves feminists, about
things like orgasm, for
example?

Andrea: Yes, there's some
tension within the movement,
though, about whether to
place emphasis on those kinds
of questions. There are wo-
men who think that's not a
priority, and there are women
who feel very strongly that
it is. So you can't make a
generalization about that.

Kim: What about health is-
sues? You talked earlier a-
bout a frontal assault on
native medicine.

Andrea: Within the context
of the community education,
the group education that's
being done by feminists,

There hasn't been a great
deal of exploration of the
history of medicine and wo-
men's place in it, however.
Kim: Peru is a Goddess-
worshipping country, right?
Andrea: Yes, it is. There's
whole territories where the
Goddesses are still very
much alive, right alongside,
and within, the Catholic
Church. In one town where I
stayed quite a bit of the
time, a feminist woman was
looking into the ways the
Catholic Church and the pre-
Inca religion are combined,
and she finds that October
7th is the day of La Virgin
Chapitona, which means Mary
before she was married, not
before she was sexually ex-
perienced. It's a period in
Mary's life when she was a
free woman. This is a day
that women celebrate in ex-
actly that sense. (laughter)

Kim: Do you think there
hasn't been as much getting
back into learning about
traditional values of the
country because of racism,
because the feminist move-
ment is really not a native
women's movement?

Andrea: Well, the women
that were household workers
were the ones who talked to
me about the Goddesses. I
think they are a key link
between the countryside and
the city. And I think, if
their influence grows within
the feminist movement, that
would be an important con-
tribution.

Kim: How would you sum up
the kinds of tensions that
exist among women activists
in Peru? Is it a situation
pretty much like we have
here?

Andrea: Well, the same bar-
riers exist - strong barri-
ers. But there's more unity
in the sense that all of the

Kim: How do they feel about
feminists from other coun-
tries?

Andrea: Women in the pro-
vinces are so eager to talk
or get support from anyone,
from anyplace, that they
don't feel the same kind of
defensiveness with foreign
feminists that women in Lima
sometimes do. In fact, I
found that in most places
they didn't even know there
was a women's movement out-
side of Peru. Sometimes they
didn't think other women
needed it (laughter), especi-
ally not North American
women.

Kim: Oh, yeah, because
we're so liberated, right?

Andrea: I guess so. Their
only familiarity historically
with feminism outside of
their country is that they
have heard about Flora Tris-
tan in their history books,
because she was a Peruvian
woman who was a heroine of
