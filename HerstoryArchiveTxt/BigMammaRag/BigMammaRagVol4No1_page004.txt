Attempted Rape Thwarted  
Black Women Charged With Murder  

Two black women currently  
await the convening of a new  
Georgia grand jury which may  
reindict them. The two, Dessie X.  
Woods and Cheryl S. Todd, were  
charged this summer with  
armed robbery and murder after  
resisting rape by a white sales-  
man. In the struggle, the man  
was shot with his own gun.  

But in early September, a  
Georgia judge ruled in favor of a  
defense motion to quash the  
indictment because of the grand  
jury's illegal underrepresentation  
of blacks, women, and  
people between the ages of 18  
and 30.  

Woods, who is 30, and Todd,  
23, began their months-long  
ordeal on June 14 when they  
decided to go to the Georgia  
State Prison in Reidsville to visit  
Todd's brother. He had written  
his family that he had been  
injured and was being refused  
proper medical attention by  
prison officials.  

Neither woman owned a car  
and bus service to the prison  
was almost non-existent, so  
they decided to hitchhike, despite  
the advice of Todd's doctor,  
concerned about her low blood  
pressure.  

On the way to Reidsville, Todd  
became ill, and upon their arrival  
she fainted in front of the prison,  
which is directly across the road  
from the State Highway Patrol  
office. It wasn't long before the  
two women were noticed by  
highway troopers who decided  
they were drunk, beat them and  
arrested them for public  
drunkenness.  

It took Woods and Todd three  
days to get out of the jail, after  
being wired money from Atlanta.  
They then decided to leave the  
area as quickly as possible.  

About 9 in the evening on  
June 17, a white man named  
Ronnie Horne pulled up and  
offered Todd and Woods a ride.  

Horne told them he was a  
police detective, and his  
holstered gun and citizen's band  
radio seemed to support his  
claim. They were so grateful for  
the ride out of Reidsville and so  
relieved that they had met a law  
enforcement officer who  
seemed sympathetic, that the  
two women began to tell him  
what had happened to them in  
Reidsville and even asked for his  
help.  

Horne got on his car radio and  
began to describe the women’s  
situation to a man on the other  

Down On The Farm  

end, and it actually looked to  
Todd and Woods as though they  
might get some help. It was only  
after the two men met at an  
agreed upon restaurant nearby  
that the two women began to  
sense something was wrong.  
The man Horne met with was  
Royce Yawn, a business as-  
sociate of Horne’s, who later  

turned out to be an insurance  
salesman — not a policeman —  
from Rentz, a small Georgia  
Town. Almost immediately the two  
men began to argue as Yawn  
left the restaurant with him. Todd  
and Woods then left the  
restaurant with Horne, but  
discovered he was traveling  
in the wrong direction. They de-  
manded he let them out of the  
car, and walked back to the  
restaurant they had just left.  
But Horne wouldn't give up  
and followed the women back to  
the restaurant, threatening to  
arrest them if they did not leave  
with him immediately.  

As soon as they got into the  
car, Horne began to make sexual  
threats to the women. Todd cried  
and screamed, but Horne only  
became more abusive. He  
stopped the car and Todd jumped  
out. Horne reached for his  
holstered gun on the front seat  
and a struggle for the gun  
followed. In the end, two bullets  
from his own unlicensed gun  
lodged in Horne’s body, and he  
died.  
The police came and arrested  

Woods and Todd and took them  
to Laurens County where the  
two gave statements to the  
police and the Georgia Bureau of  
Investigation without benefit of  
counsel. They were then trans-  
ferred to the Wheeler County  
Jail.

Women meet with Director  
Prison Problems Listed  

Sherrie Brandenstein  

During December  
representatives of the Colorado  
Coalition on Women and the  
Criminal Justice System met  
with Gerry Agee, Director of  
Corrections for the State of  
Colorado, to express concerns  
about treatment of women. Also,  
Coalition members traveled to  
Canon City to talk with the  
Inmate Council at Colorado  
Women's Correctional  
Institution.  

The December 1 meeting with  
Agee and four Coalition  
members centered on several  
issues. The women cited the in-  
adequate vocational training  
available for women inmates.  
Mr. Agee acknowledged that,  
and indicated that vocational  
education provisions are being  
explored through Southern  
Colorado State University at  
Pueblo. The Department of  
Parole is presently revising its  
procedures for work and study  
release for all prisoners.  

Children  

Another concern presented by  
the Coalition is the problem in-  
carcerated women have in  
keeping track of where their  
children are, both while the  
women are in prison and upon  
their release. Mr. Agee referred  
the matter to the Parole Depart-  
ment, which has the new res-  
ponsibility of answering in-  
quiries about inmates’ families.  
The Coalition intends to follow  
up to make sure the questions  
about children are being  
handled satisfactorily.  

When asked about the future  
of the Colorado Women's Cor-  
rectional Institution, Mr. Agee  
stated that the institution  
probably will not close in the for-  
seeable future. He does think  
that it could become a co-ed  
facility at some later time.  

Mae Gillespie, the former  
administrator of CWCI, is on sick  
leave and will not be returning.  
In six months, a permanent  
administrator will be chosen  
from all applicants from the  

entire U.S.  

On December 6 several  
Coalition members went to the  
Colorado Women’s Correc-  
tional Institution to meet with in-  
mates. The mood there seemed  
much improved since Ms. Gilles-  
pie has left. The women seemed  
pleased with the administration  
of John Griffin, the temporary  
assistant warden.  

Privileges  
Most of the petty psy-  

chological harassment that  
hung over the inmates during  
Gillespie's administration has  
virtually disappeared. They have  
more relaxed visiting privileges  
with families and better rapport  
exists between inmates and  
matrons (we noticed that the  
matrons were not wearing uni-  
forms). Women are taking turns  
for shopping trips into Canon  
City, a practice which was not  
allowed formerly.  

These trips out of the  
institution are an example of the  
kinds of privileges women will  
gain under the new merit system  
Griffin will initiate this month.  

Inmates will “earn” increasing  

numbers of privileges (es-  
pecially unstructured time and  
late bedtime) as they steadily  
show ability to be responsible.  
Fellow inmates will primarily  
determine the readiness of a  
woman for advancement. This  
system is similar to the one used  
at the State Reformatory in  
Buena Vista, and the women  
seemed to feel that it is fair.  
Training  

They still have complaints  
about prison life. Number one on  
the list is the lack of adequate vo-  
cational training. CWCI offers  
little training besides clerical  
and domestic instruction. As one  
woman remarked, “By the time  
you’re old enough to get in here,  
you already know how to cook  

and clean and things like that.”  

Women would also like to be  
placed in community correc-  
tions units in larger numbers.  

Several women commented  
that indeterminate sentencing  
works against them, resulting in  
inmates serving far more time  
than is helpful for them. And  
after prisoners go before the  
Commute or Parole Board, they  
must wait weeks to receive a  
Board decision. That waiting  
period is excruciating for  
inmates, and seems like an un-  
necessary bureaucratic  
stipulation.  

Communication  

Finally, communication with  
friends and family is critical to  
women in prison. Presently, one  
pay telephone (with no booth for  
privacy) serves 85 women. The  
inmates told the Coalition that  
they would like a phone with a  
booth for each of the three  
residential wings.  

This report by the Colorado  
Coalition on Women and the  
Criminal Justice System is part

Midwestern Women’s Learning Center Offers Diverse Activities  

What would it mean to live  
clearly, purposefully? How can  
we escape the passivity which  
collects in phrases like “I have to  
be” and learn instead to say “I  
am”? What structures can we  
create to embody our values, our  
goals? How can we then expand  
those structures outward into  
society?  

These questions sparked a  
project to begin this summer on  
a farm in Wisconsin. It will not be  
a school, an institute, a camp, a  
retreat, or an encounter environ-  
ment, but, taking elements from  
each, it will combine intensive  
self-examination with intensive  
study of old and new myths  
about women. Given a feminist  
definition of each of these  
words, it will work toward  
becoming a Women's Learning  
Center.  

Beginnings  

The project began about a year  
ago when a group of Mid-  
western women started to meet  
with the idea of conceiving a  
place for women to come for  
summer study. In August of this  
year, they found a 120-acre farm  
southeast of Minneapolis,  
between Maiden Rock and Plum  
City, Wisconsin. Enclosed in  
rolling hills, the farm included an  
enormous barn, a four-bed-  
room farmhouse, and several  

rickety outbuildings. Given all  
the potential of all that, plus the  
surprise of finding a two-headed  
axe in the farmyard, it seemed  
the right place to begin.  

The first summer will neces-  
sarily be an experimental  
summer. In order to include  
women of various life-styles,  
there will be two sessions, one  
of two weeks, running from  
June 20th through July 3rd, and  
one of six weeks, running from  
July 11th through August 21st.  
Each session will enroll  
approximately forty women, and  
children will be welcome. Fees  
have not yet been established,  
but they will be kept at a  
minimum and, depending on  
funding, as many scholarships  
as possible will be given.  

Projections  

By limiting the enrollment to  
forty women, the hope is to  
establish the Women’s Learn-  
ing Center as a community in  
which each woman will be  
involved equally in all of the  
Center's activities: study groups,  
personal growth groups, life-  
support systems, and the further  
evolution of the Center, its  
philosophy and functions.  

The study groups will meet  
each morning, facilitated by Toni  
McNaron, head of Women’s  
Studies at the University of  
Minnesota, and Adalaide  
Morris, teacher at the University  
of Iowa. The readings, some set  
up beforehand and some  
evolving from the groups them-  
selves, will center on the idea of  
an examined life. Using novels,  
poems, journals, and auto-  
biographies, the effort will be to  
probe beneath the surfaces of  
life patterns to the myths which  
underlie them. To understand  
these myths, their hidden de-  
mands and undisclosed struc-  
tures, would be to clarify and  
thus to begin to control not only  
our relationship with ourselves  
but also our involvements with  
our families, our tribal groups,  
our culture and enclosing  
society.  

The study groups will be  
complemented by twice-weekly  
personal growth groups, groups  
of ten women each facilitated by  
Connie Wolfe and Jean Eckerly,  
members of the Minneapolis  
Gestalt Therapy Collective,  
Sagaris. Since no knowledge is  
sustained unless we attach our  
own energy to it, the purpose of  
these groups will be to persona-  
lize the ideas from the readings  
by helping each woman to estab-  
lish a clear sense of her own  
relationship to them. Building on  
each woman's basic recog-  
nition of the sources and  

rhythms of her energy, the aim  
will be to discover first what has  
been done to that energy and,  
second, the means and methods  
of freeing it, of taking  
responsibility for its intensity  
and direction. The question the  
groups will examine is essen-  
tially how to transform  
traditional passive, adjusting be-  
havior into active, self-directed  
and self-generated life shaping.  
Community  

There will be ample oppor-  
tunity for women in the com-  
munity to shape their lives on  
the farm. The conditions will be  
more or less primitive (cots,  
tents, simple meals, and basic  
facilities), and to keep expenses  
minimal each woman will need  
to contribute to the life-support  
systems. There will be the im-  
mediate tasks, such as garden-  
ing, cooking, childcare, and  
maintenance; there will also be  
the tasks involved with improv-  
ing the farm for future sessions.  
In one of these, Artemis, the  
Minneapolis Women's  
Construction Collective, has  
contracted to build a dormitory  
and women will be needed to  
help in exchange for learning  
construction skills; other on-  
going projects will evolve as the  
summer develops.  

The Women’s Learning  
Center will be, then, a commun-  
ity creation, and one project  
involving the whole community  
will be to plan for continuing that  
creation. It will be important to  
know during the summer exactly  
what is working and what is not,  
to evolve methods for improving  
the Center and plans for  
implementing those methods.  
For this purpose there will be  
frequent community meetings  
and a community journal of both  
criticisms and suggestions.  

A project like this will no doubt  
generate more questions than it  
can immediately answer, more  
problems than it can con-  
veniently solve, yet the hope is  
that if it can be, in the best sense,  
a Women’s Learning Center,  
this process itself will be the  
most important and most  
exciting result.
