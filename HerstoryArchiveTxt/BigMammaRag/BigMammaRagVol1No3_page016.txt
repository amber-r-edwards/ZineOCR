Motherhood continued here. The usual household tasks  

were now shared by five of us.  
‘How could I complain that David  

didn't read the childcare  
books? I remember pressuring  
him to read pages so and so,  
and he would, eventually.  
After all, he was working hard  
in school and I had none of  
those pressing commitments.  

(I was registered, but not a  
student in practice.)  

During Amanda's first four  
months I was involved with  
the Woman's Caucus of my  
graduate program. I had a  
dim realization that that con-  
tact was very important for my  
sanity. It was my only con-  
tact outside of my world of  
Amanda, David and the house.  
Winter quarter began and I  
took some classes. I clung to  
that identity and ego-tripped on  
the fact I technically never  
dropped out of school.  

I remember tripping on how  
atypical (read: superior) I  
was. A lot of my words to  
other people, especially women's  
liberation women, were partially  
to impress. I bragged about  
my negative fantasies of  
killing Amanda and didn't let  
myself feel many positive or  
"typical" ones. I dug acting  
cool and indifferent - being  
a liberated mother. I dug  
nursing Amanda so casually and  
successfully. At the time I  
wasn't conscious of bragging.  

I did have fantasies of escape  
from this drama, of feeling it  
was all a temporary game.  

After all, we hadn't established  
any mutual love relationship.  

I knew it didn’t matter to  
Amanda who was holding her, but  
she did prefer my lactating  
breasts to the bottle. As we  
got into a routine, David and I  
could talk and reflect, as op-  

posed to react, more. I  

resented doing more than my  
exact time allotted share of  
baby care and kept keen watch  
on the division of labor.  

When I wrote some papers for  
school and David seemed willing  
to do more than his share, I  
was amazed and guilty because  
I knew I wasn't willing to  

do the same for him. God, I  
thought I was selfish, but I  
kept my principles because I  
felt a vague, unspoken support  
from some women in my life.  

I was angry and jealous  
of David. He not only had  
the rewards of parenthood, he  
had work he could relate to.  
One reason I nursed as long as  
I did was to keep myself as  
Amanda's most special person.  
It was also difficult to  
share the one area of compe-  
tence I felt I had. Once  
Amanda fell off the bed while  
David was in the room with her.  
One of my gut reactions was it  
wouldn't have happened if I  
had been there. I rushed in  
when David called for me and  
silently felt, I can comfort  
her better than anyone.  

After all, if she prefers  
David, what else do I have?  

I felt very rigid about  
equalization of Amanda's respon-  
sibilities. Because I didn't  
have anything else satisfying  
of my own, and because of a  
guilt about what kind of mother  
I am, I'd slip into doing more  
than my share.  

David didn't feel as  
isolated or have the desperate  
desire to talk about everyday,  

issues of baby care. One  
reason he didn't was that being  
a father was another something  
he did, not something he "was."  
Being a mother was who I was.  
Somewhere in me I felt  
unrecognized, David was the  
focus of attention by being  
so nice and so responsible for  
his child. “Oh, Alice, he is  
amazing and you're so lucky  
because most men don't have  
that special feeling and intui-  
tion for babies," said my  
mother and her friends. He  
got the public accolades from  
me and my friends as well, for  
what was expected from me.  
Again I was being defined  
in terms of a man. People  
looked at us and said how  
lucky I was to have David around.  
It still makes me angry when  
I think about it because it's  
still going on.  

David realized that he re-  
lated to a lot of taking care  
of Amanda in terms of a burden.  
I felt the same way. David  
and I are in a world of child-  
less graduate students and I  
was jealous of them and  
embarrassed to say so because  
I would make public my help-  
lessness and sense of failure.  
I feel guilty even in writing  
this today because I am think-  
ing "what does this say about  
my getting into the joys of  
motherhood?" Those moments of  
joy were there, but they were  
never long lasting.  

Somewhere in me I feel  
Amanda is cheated - to have a  
mother who is so totally ambi-  
valent, who finds her boring  
in long stretches of hours,  
who resents her constant deman-  
ding dependence. When I  
viewed her as an object to be  
responsible for, my negative  
feelings and fantasies rushed  
in. When I'm taking care of  
her it’s either her trip or  
ours together. Perhaps I can  
read something light or listen  
to music, but there's no way  
I can be into anything or any-  
body else in a deep way.  

What about any positive  
feelings? Sometimes they come  
out of guilt, when I'm wishing  
I was away from her. It  
seemed like I was always schem-  
ing to get away from her. Then  
I realize she herself is really  
cute and innocent and it's  
not her fault she's on this  
earth. She's just a cute  
Amanda panda hangin’ in. Then  
there are the times that I  
really do want to be with her  
and I get into her babiness -  
her constant changing, explo-  
ration, joy, enthusiasm and  
honesty.  

I do dig her and my love  
grows as she does, but in this  
journal I want to stress the  
difficult aspect. Those  
positive moments for me - the  
energy for them is only freed  
up when I don't objectify  
her as a chore to be endured.  
And I don't have to do that  
when we're together out of  
choice. I imagine she knows  
those times I don’t dig being  
with her. And I do believe  
the liberation of children is  

intimately connected to the  
liberation of women to be our  
own selves.
