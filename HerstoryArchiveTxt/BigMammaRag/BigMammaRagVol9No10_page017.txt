together, to dialogue about
racism; that as women we
could make a difference.
Within seconds upon comple-
tion of our statements, how-
ever, Robin Tyler ran onto
the stage, charging us with
invalidating the work that
had been done, and with try-
ing to destroy the festival.
She denied charges of racism
simply by the fact of being
a Jew. Identifying herself
as a Jew over and over, she
defended herself from per-
sonal attack and defended
the profits made from the
festival, with promise of a

videotape of lesbian culture.

Her defense of profit, in
the context of identifying
herself as a Jew was especi-
ally painful. Her actions
warrant understanding, in
that they came from interna-
lized anti-Semitism and fear
but we must hold her accoun-
table for her racism, her
invalidation of others, and
her power-tripping.

Her statements threw the

“CONDITIONS is highly recommended for academic
libraries and is essential for all collections of lesbian/

audience into chaos. Some
white women yelled for us to
go home and stop "ruining their good time." Could they
really not see that we had
come there for a good time
also? That we would have
rathered there'd be no rac-
ism and classism, so that we
too could've enjoyed what we
came there to enjoy—true
womanspace, for all women?
Many women listened to all
that had been said, and were
terribly confused. Robin
Tyler, invalidating the uni-
ty we had accomplished as
women of color, Jewish women
and white women, caused tre-
mendous pain among all of us
who had marched. We left the
main concert area, meeting
again in a place remote from
the chaos. We spoke of our
pain of invalidation. Many
Jewish women spoke of their
fear of being identified
with Robin Tyler's state-
ments. We supported each
other and reaffirmed our so-
lidarity as Third World,

sang of being family, and
ended the night with a cul-
tural festival of our own, a
true cultural festival in
which differences were
shared, supported and cele-
brated.

Once again, the next day
we met. We wore red arm
bands to identify ourselves
as those who'd participated
in the action, in an attempt
to share information with
many of the women unaware of
the issues involved. But the
joy in solidarity we had
felt during our march was
deflated—feminists, once
again, succeeded in producing
an event which invalidated
women of color's and Jewish
women's concerns and per-
spectives.

the Bay Area are meeting,
discussing and strategizing
for next year's festival.
One of the demands that is
being brought to Robin Tyler
is that next year's festival
be planned by a collective,
with equal representation of

women of color and white

women. This, as opposed to
the hierarchical structure
of this year's festival,
with Robin Tyler on top.

-Credit Lost
If next year's festival —
cannot make significant strides
over this year's event, there
can and should be no festival.
A boycott is being considered
depending on the outcome of
negotiations. Meanwhile, each
and every one of us must com-
mit to bringing true anti-
racism into the feminist com-
munity, and must live up to
this commitment in our every-
day interactions and events.
