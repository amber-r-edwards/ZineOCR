injured some pieces of personal
property and seized others
- including important corres-
pondence from British educa-
tors and publishers concern-
ing a French journal edited
by Simone de Beauvoir.

When asked to justify their
presence in the home, the po-
lice implied that the women
might have been involved in
an attempted bombing of Leeds
Conservative Party headquar-
ters; a charge for which they
presented no evidence. The
"visit" lasted almost three
hours. While the police did
have a warrant, they did not
need to prove probable cause
to obtain it. This lack of
accountability has reportedly
allowed significant police
harassment of the black,
Irish and feminist communi-
ties in Britain. While vic-
tims of harassment can file
complaints, the women main-
tain that such complaints are
not followed up in a respon-
sible manner.

Ironically, we in the U.S.
may be in a better position
to stop this harassment in
West Yorkshire than local
residents. The greatest hope
of deterrence lies in public
outcry from an international
community concerned with hu-
man rights. A letter campaign
in support of the three women
is underway. Most helpful are
brief letters protesting the
invasion of privacy and in-
timidation to which they and
their children were subject,
and confirming a monitoring
of the situation by concerned
U.S. citizens. Copies should
be sent to: Superintendent
Walter Cowman, Millgarth
Police Station, Leeds 1, West
Yorkshire, England; Stan
Cohen, M.P., Houses of Parl-
iament, Westminster Bridge,
London, S.W. 1, England; and
Jalna Hanmer, 30 Brudenell
Avenue, Leeds 6, West York-
shire, England.

Please share this informa-
tion with friends in other
parts of the country so that
the response will be as wide-
spread as possible. Thank you
for your attention to this
important situation.

written down. It includes
(re)enforcing racism, the op-
pression of women, etc. Wit-
ness in this country Opera-
tion Jobs, where 5,000 work-
ing people were rounded up,
placed in detention centers
and then deported, plus
countless others who were
arrested at the same time for
having dark skin, not only
Chicanos but Iranians and
others. This was done to give
the si-
lent majority a "safe" (for
the U.S. government) place

to focus anger and hatred at
how their lives are going.

The same kind of arrests
go on every day of activists.
The police use racism, red-
baiting, homophobia, class-
ism (where people who live in
the same city stereotype and
write off people because of
their neighborhood) and secrecy
to get away with this. Our silence
(or quiet outrage) only gives
them license to arrest and
harass more people. Letters
do help.

Letters to the police, pri-
sons, local newspapers, in-
form them that we are watch-
ing and we don't support or
buy into what they're doing.
The police only back down
when we (the public) tell
them they've gone too far.
When Haydee Torres (an im-
prisoned member of the FALN,
the Puerto Rican Independence
Movement) needed medical at-
tention, the prison denied
it until people wrote pro-
testing her treatment. Writ-
ing this kind of letter or
postcard only takes a minute
and it does make a differ-
ence.

Political Prisoner

Dear Sisters,

In behalf of a rape victim:
my friend Vickie has been in
jail for four weeks. She's
facing first degree murder
charges in North Carolina
for defending herself against
her stepfather who was try-
ing to rape her. She is 22
years old now and when she
was 13 he did rape her. He had
attempted several times over
the years. Unfortunately the
family swept the incident un-
der the rug. He was a sergeant
in the US Army and on
probation and known to be in-
volved in pornography produc-
tion. She turned herself in
and has been told she may get
the death penalty. She has
to prove her self-defense
case. A prison sentence will

only harden an already
scarred girl.

We must not sit back and
read about yet another case
of unjustly trying the victim.
I'm writing women's organiza-
tions hoping to arouse caring
women who will write her and
show support. When her trial
comes I'd like to know that
sisters will unite if needed.
If you know of a group of
women who visit girls in jail
to offer emotional support,
please pass along Vickie's
address. Thank you.

Lesbian Mothers

Dear Women:

I am writing to you whom I
dearly love. Many of you who
read this letter will know
me and just as many, I hope,
will not. Please know that
this letter comes from one
who deeply honors southern
women and their communities,
especially their commitment
to and support of mothers,
children, and the women who
love and support both. While
southern women have much to
overcome and much room for
growth, counter to the image
that many women across this
nation have of us, we are
at once envisioning, recre-
ating, and owning our lives
in some of the most tangibly
hostile environments in this
nation. It is with knowing
and loving as well as respect
and honor that I write this
letter.

For all of you who are
reading, I would like to
share a dream coming true.
This dream is a volume of
writing entitled: And the
Thick Ones Are Comforters: A
Lesbian Mothers’ Anthology;
Piecing Together the Frag-
ments of our Lives~Finding
our Own Designs.

The birth of this work was
conceived in the hearts of
two women Jeanne Vaughn and
Robin Song, after attempting
a similar work without the
woman spirit of others need-
ed to complete it. They were
not deterred by this momen-
tary setback. Instead they
could realize a dream that
was borne out of the strug-
gles of lesbian mothers, co-

mothers, extended familial
units, and those who support
them.

These two women soon became
five adding myself, Andrea
Canaan (32) black-lesbian-
feminist-writer-mother of
Leslie Ebonne who is co-
mothered by Diana; Rosamaria
Zayas (40) Puerto Rican
lesbian mother of five-com-
munity worker and activist
beginning with the welfare
rights movement; Peggy Sulli-
van (46) lesbian mother of
one. Robin Song (37) is a
white working class lesbian
feminist-mother of two and
Jeanne Vaughn is a lesbian
welfare mother of immigrant
and working class background.

Together we named this
work, bonded ourselves to
each in the names of our
mothers and children, and
adopted the concept of La
Familia Meztiza- or family
of mixed bloods- as well as
related by spirituality, pol-
itics, and struggle. We have
committed the next two years
to allowing the voices of
lesbians who mother.

Our decision making is
done in a matrifocal family
way. Decisions are reached
through discussion, argu-
ment, and in the presenta-
tion of personal herstory to
support a position. Age and
experience are most respect-
ed with research and docu-
mentation following. In the
event of a disagreement the
two oldest members make a
final decision.

We are currently in the
organizational, fundraising,
and outreach phase of this
work. We are tending to the
details of setting our lives
to working together such as
child care, being real about:
money, legal, logistical,
conscious, constructive, and
womanly ways to relate to
each other, our children,
partners, those who submit
to this publication, and the
communities from which they
are borne.

I cannot tell you all in
a letter and so I would like
to call a communal gathering
in New Orleans for the fol-
lowing purposes:

To share our visions and
plans for this work.

To support women writers and
those who mother.

To support the agonizing pro-
cess of submission to this or
any publication.

To raise money to help this
work.

To gain from your experience
