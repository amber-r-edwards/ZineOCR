Stand Against The Grand Jury  

Taking A  

Eve Rosahn  

The U.S. government "anti-  
terrorists" campaign suffered  
a major setback with my re-  
lease from jail on Dec. 31,  
1981. I had been jailed for  
more than two months, and in  
isolation for almost all of  

struggle  

that time, on phony charges of  
“criminal facilitation" stem-  
ming from the attempted ex-  
propriation of a Brinks truck  
in Nyack, N.Y. on Oct. 20,  
1981 and for refusing to co-  
llaborate with the grand jury  
attacks on the Black liber-  
ation struggles and the anti-  
imperialist movement.  

I had been railroaded through  
contempt proceedings in a  
secret hearing and denied the  
right to a lawyer. The govern-  
ment was forced to release me  
on bail when we exposed the  
political nature of the grand  
jury.  

Repression is heightening in  
this period because the U.S.  
is facing growing and winning  
struggles for national liber-  
ation in every corner of the  
world. The attacks on me are  
aimed at intimidating prog-  
ressive and anti-imperialist  
people like myself away from  
doing political work in sup-  
port of Black liberation and  
particularly to frighten those  
who support the Black Liber-  
ation Army and the right of  
all oppressed peoples to wage  
armed struggle for liberation.  
That's the framework for the  
attacks on me.  

I have been an anti-imperi-  
alist activist for 13 years,  
part of the anti-war movement,  
the anti-imperialist women's  
movement and one of the Anti-  
Springbok 5 who fights in  
solidarity with the liberation  
of Azania (South Africa) and  
as a plaintiff in Clark et al.  
a $100 million lawsuit hold-  
ing Nixon, the FBI and others  
responsible for COINTELPRO,  
the secret counterinsurgency  
war program designed to de-  
stroy the Black liberation  
struggle and all progressive  
movements.  

In this period the govern-  
ment has turned to one of the  
most insidious weapons in its  
counterinsurgency arsenal,  
the grand jury. The grand  
jury has been used against  
the anti-war movement, the  
women's movement and the  

Native American, the Chicano  
Mexicano and the Puerto  
Rican independence movements  
and is now being wielded  
against the Black liberation  
struggles and white anti-  
imperialists who ally with  

There has been a sharp  
struggle for years in the  
women's movement about our re-  
lationship to the State.  
Years ago women like Jill Ray-  
mond, Terry Turgeon, Ellen  
Grusse and others offered  
models by taking a clear prin-  
cipled stand of non-collabor-  
ation with FBI and grand jury  
attacks. They were admired  
and defended by women at the  
same time as the U.S. govern-  
ment was projecting agents  
like Jane Alpert as legitim-  
ate "feminists".  

In 1982 those struggles are  
reemerging as the U.S. govern-  

ment attacks white anti-imper-  

ialist freedom fighters like  
Judy Clark and David Gilbert  
as well as public political  
activists like myself as  
"terrorists" while they are  
again projecting Alpert as a  
leader of the women's move-  
ment. At a time when women  
are confronting heightened  
violence and degradation in  
our lives, imperialism is of-  
fering white women the Family  
Protection Act, the opportun-  
ity to "strengthen the Amer-  
ican family" by uniting with  
our own oppressors and joining  
the Klan and the police. In  
its drive toward fascism, im-  
perialism is trying to unite  
white working-class women in-  
to the white supremacist of-  
fenses against Third World  
peoples. These are the very  
issues that have faced the  

No Asylum For Haitian  

Lori Bradford  

The lives of an estimated  
2700 imprisoned Haitian re-  
fugees who have entered the  
United States seeking polit-  
ical asylum have finally come  
into public focus. There  
is an ever-growing coalition  
demanding the release of  
all Haitian refugees from  
concentration camp conditions  
and continued captivity, both  
in the United States and  
Puerto Rico.  

In addition to the major-  
ity of the Haitian refugees  
held in barbed wire fence  

women's movement for 15 years.  

To ally with our enemy or to  
follow the leadership of the  
national liberation struggles  
who are overturning centuries  
of oppression and transform-  
ing the lives of women in the  
process,  

it is critical that all of  
those who are fighting for  
human rights and liberation  
fight against the government's  
attacks on me. My stand of  
non-collaboration and resis-  
tance is the stand against  
the attempt to "criminalize"  
an entire movement, to intim-  
idate people who support the  
right of oppressed people to  
wage wars for national liber-  

concentration camps, on  
October 31, 1981 sixty-nine  
Haitian women were sent  
from Miami to Alderson  
Federal Women's Prison in  
West Virginia. No one knows  
how long they will be there  
or why. Ranging in age from  
18 to 55, the women are  
being held in an "honor"  
cottage, being kept separate  
from the rest of the popula-  
tion. There are about ten  
women who may be pregnant.  
Extreme poverty and the  
Nazi-like policies of the  
Duvalier regime in Haiti has  
been the force behind this

Administration finds politic  
to support.  

The Reagan Administration  
cannot give political  
asylum to the Haitian  
refugees because that would  
be an admission that it was  
not safe for the Haitians to  
return to Haiti and that  
American support of the  
repressive Duvalier regime  
was a mistake. Many question,  
as the U.S. also supports
