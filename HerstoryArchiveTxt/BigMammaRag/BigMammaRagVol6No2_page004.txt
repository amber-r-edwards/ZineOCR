Filipina Nurses Win  

Maxine Smith  

Maxine Smith is a 48-year-old  
black woman from Springfield, Ill.  
She has been imprisoned at Dwight  
Correctional Center since 1972, fol-  
lowing her conviction for the shoot-  
ing of her boyfriend during a domestic  
quarrel. She is the mother of four  
children and the grandmother of ten.  

In 1973, a law class was started  
by a group of lawyers and law students  
from Chicago. Through her involve-  
ment in that class, Maxine began to  
acquire legal skills. When a law  
library was established in 1974 at  
Dwight, Maxine became a law librarian.  
Through this position, she was  
able to expand her knowledge of the  
law and become one of the best jail-  
house lawyers in the state.  

Officials at Dwight have consis-  
tently ignored attempts by prisoners  
to call attention to the lack of any  
decent medical care, the absence of  
vocational and educational programs,  
poor diet, and increased use of max-  
imum security.  

In 1975, 25 women filed a joint  
grievance addressing the situation.  
The grievance was denied. Instead,  
prison officials have disbanded an  
inmate advisory council, and termin-  
ated the law class. And they have  
channeled money and efforts into  
increased security.  

In early 1976, prisoners organized  
several demonstrations protesting  
poor nutrition and the barrage of  
petty rules. In July 1976, a peace-  
ful protest was responded to with  
the use of state troopers and tear  
gas. The participants were then  
placed in segregation and held for  
ten days without hearings, legal  
counsel, medical care and denied a  
change of clothes, showers, and  
exercise.  

In October 1976, Maxine Smith was  
charged with violating an institu-  
tional regulation by having a camera  
and microphone. (The State, however,  
has yet to produce any statute or  
rule that shows these items to be  
contraband):  

Nevertheless, Maxine was placed in  
solitary confinement (segregation),  
her classification changed from min-  
imum to maximum security and she was  
removed from her position as law  
librarian.  

Since then, Maxine has been offered  
release from segregation if she will  
accept an assignment in the laundry.  
Her steadfast refusal to do so is  
based on her conviction that she was  
wrongfully removed from the law library  
and that her position there is  
essential to her effective function-  
ing as a jailhouse lawyer. Above all  
she wants to work as a jailhouse  
lawyer. Her punishment for this is  
indefinite solitary confinement.  

The conditions of her life in se-  
gregation can best be described by  
Maxine herself:  

"My cage is on the first floor at  
the back of the building and was  
formerly used as a storage closet.  

It has one small window that does not  
shed enough light to read by. None  
of the other women are allowed to  
talk to me and if they do they are  
threatened with lock up.  

We are allowed two showers and one  
hour recreation per week. The build-  
ings are infested with rodents,  
roaches and numerous other insects  
that I have never seen before. The  
garbage that is passed off as food  
is always cold and not fit for human  
consumption. Most of the time, my  
diet consists of milk, crackers,  
cookies, fruit - when they have it -  
and sweet rolls.  

My mail is tampered with, wrappers  
torn off newspapers, privileged mail  
is opened and my typing paper confis-  
cated. During the day, there is a  
male and female guard on duty, no  
privacy whatsoever, because they look  
in through the peephole anytime they  
feel like it."  

Her friends on the outside have  
expressed concern about Maxine's  
health and note that she has lost  
at least 25 pounds. It is impossible  
for us to evaluate the toll - both  
physically and mentally - that living  
in this state of isolation is having  
on her. One would have to imagine  
spending 90% of each day in a closet  
with no social contact.  

Maxine has become an example of  
strength and resistance to other  
prisoners. Her sisters have pro-  
tested her confinement by refusing  
to replace her in the law library.  

On February 8, 1977, Maxine filed  
a civil rights suit on behalf of her-  
self and other prisoners at Dwight.  
The suit was filed as a class action  
and demands an end to the harassment  
of prisoners who pursue their rights.  
A long and difficult battle is anti-  
cipated.  

The situation at Dwight is sympto-  
matic of the increased repression  
taking place in prisons all over the  
United States. Prisoners throughout  
the country have been organizing to

New Trial  

LNS/Her Say  

Months after a Detroit jury convic-  
ted two Filipina nurses of poisoning  
patients, the judge who presided over  
the case has thrown out the verdict,  
citing the government's "persistent  
misconduct," and ordering a new trial.  
Leonora Perez and Filipina Narciso  
were convicted in July 1977 of poison-  
ing patients at the Ann Arbor, Michi-  
gan Veterans Administration Hospital.  
They were accused of injecting Pavulon,  
a powerful muscle relaxant, into  
the intravenous feeding tubes of some  
of the patients who later suffered  
breathing failures.  

The judge gave his order a full sev-  
en weeks after defense lawyers made  
appeal motions on November 7. All  
summer and autumn, support committees  
for the two nurses in 33 cities across  
the U.S., Canada and Guam waged cam-  
paigns to expose the racist nature of  
the trial and to call for overturning  
the verdict. “In the final analysis,“  
noted one New York City support com-  
mittee organizer, “the judge had to go  
along and confirm the issues raised by  
public pressure.”  

The defense lawyers are expected to  
request that the charges now be drop-  
ped. And the government may yet de-  
cide not to pursue a second trial --  
having already spent over one million  
dollars at the first trial, building  
what proved to be a very weak case.  
The judge's December order said that  
during the trial the nurses were never  
shown to have had the Pavulon (which  
was cited as the cause of poisoning  
and death of a number of patients) in  
their possession or to have injected  
anything into the victims.  

The judge concluded that the govern-  
ment's case against the two was “mer-  
ely circumstantial." In addition, the  
judge wrote, “overwhelming prejudice  
to the defendants arising from the  
government's persistent misconduct  
prevented the jurors from receiving  
the case free from taint."  

Ever since the two nurses were in-  
dicted in the summer of 1976 on counts  
of murder and poisoning, their sup-  
porters viewed the charges as an inci-  
dent of “anti-alien slander” put to-  
gether hastily by the government and  
FBI to "solve" the mysterious deaths  
of a number of patients. Their analy-  
sis gained broad support across the  
country and even during the trial a  
number of the charges were dropped as  
the contradictions in the government's  
case were exposed. All but one murder

charge was dropped and Filipina Nar-  
ciso was acquitted of that charge.  

The Michigan Nurses Association says  
it will continue to press for a Con-  
gressional Investigation of the cir-  
cumstances. The Michigan Nurses As-  
sociation (MNA) accused the prosecutor  
of basing its case purely on the cir-  
cumstantial evidence that the women  
were nurses and happened to be on the  
same floor at the time of the alleged  
poisonings. The MNA charged that as  
a result of the convictions, all nurses  
were in danger of being tried and con-  
victed haphazardly of the deaths of  
patients they worked with.  

Mary Tratner, a spokeswoman for the  
MNA charged that no studies were con-  
ducted by sources outside the Veterans  
Hospital to determine if the patients  
really died of Pavulon injections, or  
whether the drug might have been con-  
taminated when it was used on the pa-  
tients.  

The laboratory which made the drug  
Pavulon was closed down by the Food  
and Drug Administration several weeks  
after the FBI began investigating the  
poisonings. The FDA had reportedly  
found that drugs at the lab were be-  
ing handled improperly. Tratner says  
that the MNA has asked Congress to in-  
vestigate the FBI's handling of the  
case.  

A strategy meeting of the 33 support  
committees was held in Detroit January  
7-8 to discuss future plans in the  
event that a second trial is convened.  
Meanwhile, the racist fears stirred up  
by the case still linger. The Bay Area  
Committee for Narciso and Perez charges  
that some patients in the Bay Area  
hospitals are refusing treatment by  
Filipino medical personnel. There is  
also concern that the recruitment,  
hiring and promotion of other Asian  
medical personnel may be cut back.  

"One Filipino nurse in a Philadelphia  
Veterans Administration Hospital was  
asked by a patient, “Are you sure you  
know what you're doing?" Others have  
gotten mysterious phone calls asking
