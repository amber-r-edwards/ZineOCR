. Pink-eyed, blue-eyed,

(For Janice)

. I must have read it someplace;

that it's always the first time that hurts.

After the first divorce the rest are easy.

It's like childbirth — after the first one

the rest slide right out.

The article said you develop a sense of humor.

Your eyes are as pink
as the new bodysuit you bought yesterday.

Crying in the bedroom is one of the less lovely moments

that marriage has to offer.

I've been in there too,

hanging on to winter dresses like they were
an old collie dog.

Once two summers ago it just wouldn't stop —
I thought of the benevolent gynecologist

and standing half-dressed in his office

near the scale, crying and crying.

He rocked me back and forth above the linoleum floor
as if he really cared about the frightened girls
whose thighs knock together on his table.

I hung on to the washcloth bathrobe.

Nobody ever comes.

If you have to cry,

closets aren't bad

for doing it.

No one can hear,

No one can say

you're just like your mother.

You have always reminded me

of imported Swiss chocolate boxes
of Mother Goose pictures.

Mary quite contrary.

Paintbox girl

who brings ten perfect mushrooms
tied in saran wrap —

you are still shy in my kitchen.

We've known each other

for almost a year now

and are still awkward at hugging,
touching wrists,

laughing together for very long.

You're the one whose hair is still yellow;

the one who never fought with your sister.
The straight-line friend who gets things done.
Lately, you're the girl who can’t stay smooth.
I once subscribed to the idea

that rain was the angels crying

above the clouds,

I never thought of Lebanese seraphims —
they all looked a good deal like you

with enormous white wings.
Heaven seemed like a nice place to be.
The problem was coming up with

a credible reason for angels to sob.
The whole thing fell through

before very long.

My husband is a leviathan sleeping.

Yours is a dalmatian who's always ready:

The story is that there’s a woman

who screws with a huge smile on her face.
The story is that there's a woman

who screws under the dining room table,
who screws upside down

and comes ten times

all at once.

The story is that there are women

who have babies in rice fields

and get right up

and go right back to work.

The idea is this:

women could have a baby

on their morning

coffee break.

It must have been a Catholic education

that taught you to say thank you one hundred times.
Nuns are always very big
on courtesy.

In April I drove to Ohio:

the thought was that I'll show up
at your house one day.

In the image it was raining —

I'm older, thick through my middle,
crying in your living room

unable to tie my shoes.

Oh it’s lonely to split up with lovers and boyfriends,
hurts to split up the records: —

the worst story of all of them, though,
is the one about finding yourself
trying through the sleep
not to move over the line
down the middle

of the bed.

Jeanice Dagher

she stands in line,
another Saturday morning of
torn stockings
and lost food stamps
her eyes, their tarnished rage
reflecting azure
she is no
ivory soap princess
Campbell's soup sweetheart

but the realities stay
so every morning she stuffs
herself into the borrowed skirt
and toothless anger

the check that never came,
the woman that she is not

so she looks in the mirror
at the end of another
job searching day
ready to bloom,

to be lit

divorce plus thirty days: how come it hurts so much if I know
I made the right decision?

something about grief — and loneliness —
about flowers, and memories that turn over slowly.

something about pain, small repeat eruptions,
pinpricks that are like light, blinding
coming without warning.

something about all the years, about not being 20 anymore,
nor 24, nor even 27; about consciousness

lifted, finely honed, twirled on the knife blade

of words, faces passing, whirlpool of change,

in the middle, on the edge, growing and needing

to be free.

something about hunks of me, fatter now, wrinkled eyes,
not so young, no longer naive,

and you behind me, fine lines still connecting us,

in spite of all my choices.

something about it all, how I believed it would be to have you gone,

how I never understood what separation meant,
how I forgot how to live alone,

how I forgot how to travel solo,

how I forgot how to be just - one -

how the days lengthen

and I am deeply sad, and wonder how it came to this,
and know it never made any sense, with you.

and that I was just slow in returning to myself.

something about grief — and loneliness — the senses
no one can explain, the states money will
not change, nor fame bless, nor success alter.

paying dues, till the days return,

till the warm times come back again.

the figures in the newspaper come and go

and smiles slowly behind clenched teeth

the new lies somehow superimposing the old
in a cloudy montage of double-exposed photographs

the sulfur match waiting only

Big Mama Rag _ Vol. 3-A, No. 7

Breakfast Notes to Phyllis - No. 3

This first Christmas alone
isn't easy:

The memories of a voice,
gold-tinseled gifts
and gentle smiles
are sewn into your mind.

There is an excuse to

deny God.

There is a reason to

not hear

the green-leafed beauty

of life growing.

There is cause to seal

your eyes

from the diamonds of the universe.

Yet soon all this will cease
with the passing of years

and you will look back

at the shadow of your mother
standing behind you
and smile.

Next to my Parents’ Room

My scalp cooking, expanding, red

as meat, little bees of sweat

buzzing out of each pore.

My hair soaking in tangles as they soak
rope in salt water

to tie for torture.

My head-board of smooth vinyl.

My wall pocked with bachelors’ buttons,
strawflower, day lily, blue tickle.

And the wall, the plaster, porous as bone,
crumbling slowly inward, holding

no chocolate marrow at the center,

go on through, go on.

Their wallpaper of blowsy roses

hanging like cloud hearts on the wall,
open as mouths. The air of their room
grey with the dust of night roses

burned to ash, crumbled, sifted,

the bed white as an iceberg, Mama,

I can't see, there’s a mist, Daddy,

the noises, I'm scared, the noises. Never
I spoke to them.

I lay hearing

Satan's axe parting the sweet

flesh of the innocent virgin. Mother,
step out

of the lamb suit,

Father, unzip the hot lion,

I'm lying awake still in the next
room, I'm thirty-one, I'm lying.

Asleep to your real lives, the man

with his heart turned off, the plug pulled,
the cord chewed to fluff, the outlet

beaten out of shape. A laugh

of the teeth only, the liquor going to
where the heart had been and warming up
the cold hole. Knowing what.

you give the ladies is what for.

The little lady lying in terror

of taking the wheel. Innocent,

letting the car float over

the cliff, with the kids strapped inside,
unable to touch the wheel, touching
her soft heart beating like a kitty
there under her girl's nightie.

For me it was the shape of the world,
the driving force. His bright sword

of bad power the force that drove me
out of the garden of not being

in her egg of absolute good

absolutely without power.

They raged behind my wall like gods.

In silence. I lay and prayed to these two
bodies in space, in the odor of mahogany,
in the soaking eye of the mirror hung
on the wall back to back with my wall,
belly to belly with my heart plugged

in so far it's stuck,
with my hands
glued to the wheel.
