Continually In Danger From U.S. ‘Justice’

Support/Defense Network

On Sept. 20th the Court
of Appeals decided to up-
hold Rita's 150 year sent-

ence. In this Appeals hear-

up-date

ing Rita's attorney Doug
Parr entered the insanity
plea. Rita is terribly down
about this, as am I. Her
Oklahoma and New York att-
orneys had a phone confer-
ence to plan their next legal

move. I expect an update on
this soon.
On June 18, 1980, Rita

was found guilty of 1st de-
gree manslaughter for which
she received 100 years,

plus 50 years for shooting
with intent to kill. She
tried to protect herself and
her son from an attack from
a police officer. During

the struggle, his gun went
off, killing him. At first
she was charged with 1st
degree murder with no re-
quest for capital punish-
ment. Later, the D.A. upped
the charge to capital pun-
ishment, which by Oklahoma's
laws entitled her to a new
preliminary hearing. This
hearing was denied.

There were many serious
judicial errors in pretrial
conduct, evidence and in
the instructions from the
judge. The judge imperially
denied the defense's re-

quest for people of color
on the jury. The judge har-
assed and threatened sup-
porters of Rita Silk Nauni
and those openly opposed to
the death penalty. The
judge criticized and intim-
idated Native American Ind-
ians in the courtroom in
front of potential jurors,
making it clear which side
he was on. Rita was tried
by a thoroughly prejudiced,
all white jury. The judge
ordered deputies to exclude
all spectators from the
courtroom, even though the
Supreme Court ruled that
such action was in violat-
ion of a criminal defend-
ant's right to a public
trial. It is difficult for
me to understand why these
and other gross judicial
errors were not brought up
in the Appeals Hearing
rather than such insistence
on the insanity plea.

Thank you for your letters
to prison officials. Some of
the mistreatment of Rita
(Silk-Nauni) has been halted.
Your letters of support have
helped give Rita strength.
She has been able to see her
son for the first time in 3
years. As long as letters
keep coming in, prison
guards will think twice
about repeating their past
brutalities. Rita's lawyer
went to Oral Arguments to
find out if she can try to
appeal. It can take years to

Hunger Strike

Warden Sharon Johnson:

Be it known to you that
on the 16th day of Nov. ‘83
that Annette Stebbing and
myself will go on a Hunger

Strike (opposing the brutal
inhumane living conditions)
that we are forced to deal

with on a daily basis.

We will conduct ourselves
in a peaceful manner so as
not to bring about any type
of retaliation from the
guards or the administrat-
ion of this institution.

We have tried many times
to change things for the
better by sending many let-
ters to you of which we have
received no replies. We
feel that the conditions of
this place and the harass-

ment must have a halt put
to it. If a Hunger Strike
is the only way to bring
about some attention to
these horrid conditions so
be it.

PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE
STRIKE.

1. Delay of medication
and/or deprivation altogether.

2. Roach infected living
quarters.

3. The mental torture of
the emetic (tending to pro-
duce vomiting -ed.) odors
which we are forced to
breathe (emanating) from the
unclean living quarters of
Marion Reid Prison.

4. Harassment from
guards, this includes spur
of the minute tickets,
ideas thought up by the
guards who cannot produce
the rule in written form.

5. Denial of our Constit-
utional Rights, as ment-
ioned above, and further-

go through the appeal proc-
ess. Every day she is away
from her son she is missing
his development. She must be
freed from her 150 year im-
prisonment term she is char-
ged with for protecting her
son and self against racial
prejudiced police brutality.

Do not forget our sister
Rita, she still needs our
help.

more censorship of incoming
mail.

The allegations stated
by Mr. Bartlow that the
Constitution of the U.S. does
not supersede the rules of
this institution, is the
reason we are on strike.
The staff should be brought
up to date on the legal
matters concerning rules.

On Nov. 1, I was stripped
searched by three guards
after leaving a visit. I
refused to be searched so
the guards took it upon
themselves to force search.
The other inmates were not
searched. My life is in
danger. All rules and reg-
ulations must be written
out so the inmates and
guards alike will know what
is expected of them.

Annette and I are
forced to live within cram-
ped infested cells isolated
from the rest of the pop-
ulation. We have a right to
be recognized as human be-
ings. There are no smoke

detectors back here. No way
to call a guard except to
bang on the wall, sometimes
up to two hours before get-
ting a guard back here.

We ask that you join us
in the struggle to win some
legal rights. This is the
eighth day of our strike.
We ask that you send letters
opposing this treatment. We
need your love and concern.
We will not end the strike
until we have reached some
kind of agreement with the
officials here and I am sure
that will be a long time
coming.
