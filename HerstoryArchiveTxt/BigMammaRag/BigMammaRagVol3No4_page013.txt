Noon Moon Struggles

On this welcome night candlelit under stars  
sharing spontaneous ceremonial dinner,  

we eldest-of-siblings witches  

transform through tunes of our own Stories.  

By night new moon women communicating, carrying on knowledge;  

the media bodies and eyes,  

our eyes those of our foremothers in the forest  
by night secret seclusion;  

the swift spirit’s ether solution of  

stories under stars.  

Clouds shield us slightly, intermittently from the universe  

that listens to our natures...  

Noon moon struggles  
process/progress of yearning/learning  
wander-dreams and wonder-realities interwoven  
containment catapulting  

overture of oppression  

repairing or repression  

song of single-minded escape  
unfinished -understanding  

renewed reaching  

precocious peace  

somewhere sisters here where hear me.  

Sinking night moonless dreamless dark sleep but smiling  

in the warm waters womb waters  
we are all  

warm mothers warm lesbians  

we are all  

gathering our own harvest.

you pay your money in hopes of happiness and  

while you lie on the expensive couch you  

learn that the forests and pure bright sunshine aren't  
where it’s at  

washing dishes is health  
freedom is illness  

you're supposed to be a well-adjusted slave.......  
my answer to that is to take  

my bow and arrow ‘to the hills,  

to hunt a deer, to hear the mountain breathe.  
Crouching in the stillness, I will pray--  

“Artemis, Goddess of silver light,  

don’t make us choose between madness or slavery --  
help set your daughters free!”  

you thank the doctor you get up to leave  

to go home and make the supper  

you do not even see the sunset..........

It's Up To You  

=  

you are the one who decides if  
you are happy,  

you are the one who decides if  
you are sad.  

you are the one who decides if  
you are silly,  

you are the one who decides if  
you are mad.  

you are the one who decides  
to do things quickly,  
you are the one who decides  
to do things slow  
you are the one who decides if  
you are a success in life,  
you can be!  
I know.

Propagandized  

So here I am in my developed body,  
Resplendent in bosom and curve;  
Cultured by years of attention,  
Groomed by my constant fervor.  

You bribed me with leering approval:  
You blackmailed me with wandering stares.  

You convinced me with advertising;  
You conditioned me with discriminating airs.  

So here I am in this prison,  
Surrounded by my sex;  

Aware now that this love-flesh  
Has come to be my hex.  

You humiliated me with departure;  
You ridiculed me with laughter.  

Until you molded me with examples,  
Promising reward by coming after.  

So here I am in this form  

Which has fulfilled all expectations.  
And I am finally ready to receive  
Your praise and incantations.  

Now you shame me  

With Disapproval and Shock  

That I would flaunt my female  
As you would cuckold your cock!  

Shecat - Eileen Charles Hyatt  

The girl is slender and beautiful  

She sits next to me smiling  

the parts are in the right order  

order is not in the right parts  

loneliness rises to make a big nothing  
loneliness sits on our shoulders and cries  
we embrace in a slender kiss  

and our hearts rise, our hands rise,  

breast to breast, mouth to mouth  

the fragrance of our closeness  

could fill a thousand nights  

we wind our legs tightly together  

aroused and passionate  

we leave one another wrapped in desire  

to keep loneliness from our eyes in the dark  
to keep loneliness from sucking our bones  
to keep loneliness from killing our minds  
we do this out of loneliness  

but mostly because she sits there  

slender and beautiful, mostly  

because she sits there smiling at me,  
mostly because we are trying to make  
order out of beauty, mostly because we are trying  
to build a safe place in a hostile world,  
a safe place for eyes, for breasts, for mouths  

a safe place for touching

“Awakening”  

Woman-child conceived in agony and joy. :  
She screams her frustrations as she emerges from the loins  
of a mother who begets the heritage of Man against Man,  
But, word is seldom if ever forthcoming regarding  
“WOMANKIND!”  
Woman-child stumbling along a road.  
She finds that it is often marked  
ONE WAY ONLY.  
Woman-child growing, but there is no one to show her the way.  
The parents condition her the way things are  
and not the way they are supposed to be.  
Woman-child crying as she discovers certain parts of the world;  
remain closed. Doors that would never be opened because she is  
“FEMALE!”  
Woman-child making knowledge her tool not her crutch.  
Trying not to lash out at a world that is not ready  
for her youth and her idealism.  
Her age instead of opening up new horizons  
is thrown up as a barrier. : i  
It serves to reinforce the “Generation Gap!  
Mocking her grey hair and her wrinkles, praising  
the long hair and the model look instead of Experience.  
Woman-child born at last, but the labor process is  
far from over.  
Unfortunately, it’s only the  
“BEGINNING”!
