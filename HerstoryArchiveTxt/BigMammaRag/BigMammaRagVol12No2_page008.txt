Mercury Poisoning...

I met Diane Gibson eight
months ago, when she called
looking for help. She had
mercury poisoning, she said,

She had never received

compensation. She
was too sick to work. Her re-
quest prompted me to read

the literature

and I was sur-
prised to learn that mercury
poisoning in dental offices
is well-documented. Further-
more, Diane had all of the
symptoms which are commonly

associated with inorganic
mercury poisoning.

What seemed initially to
me to be a simple, straight-
forward case has become very
complex, a knotted pathway
full of false starts and
wrong turns. The interview
which follows is the story
of her struggles with ill-
ness, with the dental
medical professions, with
the compensation system,
with family and friends, and
with herself. It is a story
of pain and struggle, but a-
lso one of immense strength
and tenacity.

I worked as a dental assis-
tant from 1969 until 1978.

I did just about everything
from cleaning the office to
bookkeeping and assisting
with patients.

I was exposed to mercury
when I mixed the amalgam
(made of mercury and silver)
used for dental fillings.
It's mixed in a machine call-
ed an amalgamator. During
this process the two metals
are bound together. After the
mixing was completed, I would
squeeze out the excess mer-
cury by hand. On average, I
made about 100 batches per
day, although the amount va-
ried greatly. Nobody ever
told me it was dangerous. I
also used to clean up and
store the scrap amalgam and
so I was unknowingly breath-
ing in mercury dust.

Q: When did you first exper-
ience mercury-related symp-
toms?

A: In 1969. Although, of co-
urse, I didn't know then wh-
at was wrong with me. At fi-
rst my symptoms seemed vague.
The dentist I worked with sa-
id my personality had chang-
ed. I often had headaches

and my moods swung quickly up
and down. I developed chron-
ic lower back pain and bowel
dysfunction.

Q: How did the symptoms
change over time?

A: They got worse. This is
still difficult for me to
talk about.

I have chronic headaches.
From 1973-1978 they were at
their worst. It was blinding
pain, without any let up. No-
thing helped, not even Demer-
ol. I tried heat and cold
and complete darkness. Some-
times the pain got so bad
that I would hit my head a-
gainst a wall. Even my hair
falling onto my forehead was
enough to make me scream. I
was so consumed with the pa-
in that it was impossible to

think. I still have headach-
es, but they are less int-
ense and less frequent.

My face used to twitch very
noticeably, mostly on the
left side. My mouth and face
felt numb, so that when I
ate, food would sometimes
fall out of my mouth. I wou-
ld drool a lot, especially in
my sleep.

My memory and concentration
are impaired. When I was wo-
rking, I would often not re-
member where I had put an in-
strument. I was sure that I
knew where it was, but my
memory was often wrong. Al-
though this has improved ov-
er time, even now I some-
times can't remember where
things are around the house.

Several times a week when
I'm out shopping or whatev-
er, I blank out and can't
remember what I'm doing.
Then I get angry at myself
and usually just stomp home.

My perception was, and
still is at times, impaired.
I first noticed this when I
was still working as a den-
tal assistant and I would
reach for the wrong instru-
ment. I also used to walk
into door frames a lot.

When I was a dental assist-
ant, my eyes became very
sensitive to light. My vis-
ion was blurred. Optome-
trists couldn't find any-
thing wrong, but I felt a
lot of pressure, like my
eyeballs were going to pop
out. My perception was also
disturbed. For example, if
something was priced at
$27.95, I might see $2.79.
My vision has improved since
I left work, but my eyes are
still very sensitive to
light, and they ache a lot.

I felt pins and needles
and numbness in my limbs; at
other times my skin was so
sensitive that I couldn't
stand to be touched. This
has really improved; I don't
feel the pins and needles
as much, but my hands and
feet still feel cold a lot
of the time. As well, my
hands tremble. This was at

its worst just after I left
the dental office.

This was also a time when
my legs would just give out
on me and I would fall down
on my way home. I would wake
up at night shaking uncon-
trollably. It felt like a
thousand electric shocks
were shooting through me.

Shortly after I began to
work as a dental assistant,
my feet began to swell. La-
ter the joints in my hands
started to swell. Often, I
couldn't get into any of my
shoes, so I couldn't go any-
where. This started to sub-
side a few years after I
left work. I still have a
lot of joint pain, especial-
ly in my hips, legs, feet
and wrists. I've been tested
for arthritis, but the test
results are negative.

I had to have all of my
upper teeth removed. My gums
would swell and my teeth be-
came very mobile and very
sore. This was not ordinary
gingivitis. I know how to
floss my teeth. By this time,

I'd figured out that my prob-
lems were mercury-related

and I did not want any more
mercury fillings. The dent-
ist I was seeing didn't be-
lieve me. It became a real
trauma just to walk into his
office. He wouldn't put in
non-mercury fillings, and
did not believe that my teeth
hurt me the way they did.

In the end he did agree to
build me a complete upper
denture.

My speech and writing are
impaired. Sometimes I stam-
mer and reverse the order of
words. My handwriting is
sometimes scribbled and
shaky, and I often reverse
letters and numbers when I
write and read.

I have had insomnia quite
often since 1976. Partly,
my mind just wouldn't shut
down, and other times, if I
was woken by physical symp-
toms, I couldn't get back
to sleep. Now, I just can't
sleep a lot of the time.
Several times a week it's 3
or 4 a.m. before I fall as-
