U.S. Imperialism Fails from page 9

trials against revolutionaries
become a vehicle for the
consolidation of these fascist
measures. Our trial was such
an instance. Our response was
clear-cut. Led by Sekou Odinga,
who stated in his opening
statement:

Well, today there is another
revolution going on. I call it
the New Afrikan Revolution. I
am a New Afrikan. I do not
consider myself an American
citizen. I consider myself a
New Afrikan citizen. You may
have heard the term the Republic
of New Afrika mentioned by the
judge - or if you haven't, you
will. The Republic of New Afrika
is the name given our Nation by
a group of Black people who came
together in 1968 and who decided
to declare ourselves free and
independent of the United States.
Like the British colonializers,
the American colonializers, which
they are, because we are a people
whose total wealth is controlled.
When I say we, I'm talking about
Black, New Afrikan people in
America, all the wealth that we
produce is totally controlled by
the big businessmen that run and
control the United States of
America would have you believe
that I am a criminal, that we
are all criminals. That just
isn't so. I am a New Afrikan
soldier, and we have an absolute
right to fight for our freedom.
That is a human right. That is
not a right that your oppressor
gives you. That is not a right
that you have to ask or beg for.
Like all people who want to be
free, what is necessary to
exercise that right is to stand
up like men and women and
exercise it. If it calls for
fighting, then we fight.

Because I am involved in armed
struggle against the United
States for national liberation,
this makes me a political prisoner
of war, and as a prisoner of war,
this country has no right to try
me as a criminal.

The question here is, do Black
people, do New Afrikan people
have the right to struggle for
their freedom, for justice, for
self-determination by any means
including the use of armed
struggle? I say yes. The Republic
of New Afrika says yes. All
freedom-loving people throughout
the world say yes. All
international human law says yes.

What we're doing as I have said,
is nothing new. We're fighting
just like Afrikans are doing in
South Afrika, who are fighting
against their oppression, like
Puerto Ricans are doing in
Puerto Rico, fighting against
their oppression and for self-
determination, like the Irish
are doing in Ireland, fighting
against oppression and for their
self-determination. And as many
other oppressed people are doing.
We have an absolute right to do
it also, an absolute right, a
human right, a legal right and
every other kind of right you
want to name.

We rejected this characterization
on the part of U.S. Imperialism.
Sekou Odinga's stature as a
Prisoner of War underscores the
illegitimacy of the United States
government with respect to
colonized nations. The presence
of a New Afrikan Prisoner of War
in our trial underscored the
clash between two antagonistic
forces and ideologies.

In our efforts to defeat the
criminalization of the New Afrikan
Independence struggle, we had to
take certain internal contradictions
that emerged in our trial. Traitors,
drugs and prostitution, the result
of internal errors and ideological
and political weaknesses had to be
attacked. The root causes being an
incorrect position that saw the
priority of technical armed skill
instead of the political struggle
to develop revolutionary ideology
and to transform each one of us
to represent our highest aspirations
and goals in today's practice.

Conclusion

The outcome of the trial was a
vindication for New Afrikan
Independence Movement.

from Oxfam, and UNICEF now
recognizes the programme and
provides training kits. Arriving
in an area there would be a
public meeting to announce her
week's training course. This
itself would take place in a
church, government building,
private home or whatever space
was offered. Participation on
the course was voluntary, and
based on collective discussion
and exchange of ideas amongst
the women.

Increasingly however in the
north, Susanna's groups were
disrupted by border fighting.
These conflicts are 'artificial',
created on the border with
Honduras by U.S. backed counter
revolutionary forces and the
anti-imperialist movement. The
principles of the struggle were
upheld. Mistakes were uncovered,
debate fostered and a commitment
to future revolutionary struggle
affirmed. Not only did
criminalization not succeed, but
the whole movement was strengthened
in its determination from two years
of fighting repression. If the hope
of U.S. imperialism was to weaken
us - they have abysmally failed.
The cheers with which we greeted
the verdict communicated our joy
for the comrades who were free
and our collective defiance
against U.S. imperialism.

Because of the nationwide publicity
the trials received there is now
a more general awareness of the
struggle for New Afrika. This is
important because it forces people
to ask the question why are there
people fighting? What do they want?
The answers are part of our collective
history and part of the future
development of the struggle. Our
collective resistance to the
government's strategy was based on
certain principles that the movement
has fought for - non-collaboration
with the oppressor; upholding the
right of self-determination;
defending armed struggle; and the
fundamental right we have toward
revolution. Upholding these principles
allowed us to politicize the courtroom,
neutralize the government and to some
extent open the eyes of the jury.
Without these principles we would
never have won this hard-fought victory.
