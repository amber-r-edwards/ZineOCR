Summer Solstice

Women Celebrate  
Psychic Power

Sandia

We arrive at the campground  
Wednesday night and in last  
light put up some madly designed  
tent just before a downpour.  
The only rain. For the rest of the  
week there is warm sun for bare  
breasts and workshops and  

campfires.  
Several women from Santa  
Barbara arrive after being  

crowded in a car for the duration  
of the long trip. Their energy  
spills out into the central area,  
into guitars and music:  

We quit smokin’ cigarettes  
and wearin’ high heeled shoes  
We're buildin’ up our muscles  
and eatin’ natural foods  
We want to be healthy women -  
We want to be strong  
So we can fight against  
the man  
Who's kept us down so long.  

For the rest of us the workshops  
are a key focus: herbs, astrology,  
tarot, poetry, mime, plants.  
Several women have formed  
Womancraft, which is a com-  
bination of meditation and alpha  
for exploring the spaces behind  
the doors in our mind.  

The tarot workshop reveals an  
important aspect of what  
Solstice offers. Last year the gift  
of the cards was given to me.  
Over the course of the year I  
have evolved from literal un-  
derstanding to forging with  
other women a feminist  
perspective on the cards. At the  
workshop there were women  
learning for the first time what  
the Fool's journey is. Others  
were seeing the Queen of Rods  

as a woman who, like many of  

us — species  

And one glance around showed  
how much our names are  
deliberate reflections of our  
relationship to nature: Hayfield,  
Bear, Wood, Grenouille,  
Squirrel, Whale, Hawk. Some  
women are taking notes, others  
are just taking it all in. Feedback  
coming from every part of the  
country. Solstice is the signpost  
of our evolution — where our  
thinking and politics and rituals  
have progressed over the year.  

Another workshop on the  
nature of this Amazon Nation is  
large. First we have to deal with  
the question of energies — that  
is always there: accepting  
women at all stages of con-  
sciousness, separatism, dealing  
with men, children.  

It is the idea of land and self-  
sufficiency that dominates. And  
how to keep a two-way flow  
between the women who stay in  
the city and the ones fortunate  
enough to get out. Kuttu Riddle  
has set up a nourishing space in  
Arizona. Here is someone saying  
to women, COME. How many  
will? How many stay trapped by  
their minds?  

In the astrology workshop the  
idea that excites us is that our  
efforts are matching the journey  
of the stars and planets. Uranus  
has been on the cusp of Libra  
and Scorpio. An unsettled time.  
Once again distinguishing  
between the small personal and

the larger world. It has been a  
confusing, painful time all over,  
not just in the movement. Now  
Uranus is moving into Scorpio.  
That means the breakdown of  
established institutions. But  
Scorpio is also the power to be  
silent — a rather clear message  
for radical feminists. The time is  
ripe for change but we must  
know how to communicate in  
silence, how to find alternative  
ways of using silence in a  
deafening, clear message.  

I admit if some looked around then to see  
if there was an informer.  
But she will be first a woman.  
She will see women sharing  
strength and loving, caring,  
opening up as they never have.  
Not much fodder for the power  
structure, but it is indeed our  
power.  

The psychic workshop  
demystifies the nature of this  
power. The women who come  
feel the sense of disunity at the  
campground. Some have come  
just to celebrate being with other  
women by drinking cold beer,  
playing volleyball, singing rowdy  

But that is  
unity has been eaten into by  
having to keep watch at the  
gates, for the word is beginning  
to spread in the nearby macho  
towns that women are here,  
walking around barechested.  
Mal flora — bad flowers. We  
cannot in reality hope to be one  
enclave with only one focus. We  
must keep in mind the outside  
realities and protect ourselves;  
we must know that the inner  
reality is also split. Any group of  
radical women is fooling itself if  
security is not planned for as  
part of any gathering together.  
Some of us come to be more  
conscious of ourselves, to make  
this coming together a con-  
scious declaration of our iden-  
tities, our destinies. To know  
where we are going and how to  
get there. How to get in com-  
munities or free our energy, and  
to discover what the nature of  
that energy and our womanlives  
is.  

In the Sunday sun we share  
where we have been the last  
year, and the complex is wide  
ranging: herbs, astrology,  
massage (more and more  
emphasis on the body as a  
healing defense, a psychological  
and spiritual base for our efforts)  
astrology, philosophy, the kab-  
balah, steam baths, music. A  
dominant tone is that sadness  
about what we do when we  
return to the four corners we  
came from. Scattered and  

isolated once more, how do we  
keep the energy that we find  
here? Flow, energy. Water. The  
idea that we are like tributaries  
of one swelling stream, all of us  
connected and inter-connected  
by this flow, needing only to  
meditate on the flow that is here  
to bring it all back months from  
now. And we set up a night  
gathering, an enclave for heal-  
ing, experiencing our power, for  
remembrance.  

We gather by a fire close  
enough to the center so that  
others feel free to come. Our  
faces illuminated in a circle, we  
try to keep together to keep the  
energy intact. Holding hands,  
holding glances, chants that  
begin in serenity, like a breeze in  
the night to a moon just on the  
verge of its fullness. We place  
around the ring of fire something  
of ourselves to be blessed:  
healing bags, bracelets, rocks,  
strings... we ask that friends  
and lovers not here be included  
and the momentum increases  
and we dance and the excite-  
ment grows and we are a full  
tumultuous chant to Amazon  
Nation, to the earth, to sisters.  
Writing this nearly a month  
later, I see those faces, the  
moment when we integrated the  
light and the dark within us.  

Prison...  

From Page 3  

all women have either been  
ignored by the system or treated  
unfairly within it, and that the  
inequitable socio-economic  
system has at least heavily  

contributed to the incidence of  

crime committed by women  
Achieving The Goals  

The coalition will work through  
the legislative process, com-  
munity education, monitoring of  
programs, agencies, police,  
prosecutor and judicial behavior.  
It will function as a  
clearinghouse, handling  
referrals and inquiries. It will  
seek publicity for its causes and  
find resources to support them.  
It will seek human and financial  
resources for the pursuit of  
litigation. It will consistently  
pressure the appropriate group  
or agency on behalf of  
women. It will also provide  
technical assistance to female-  
controlled and community-  
oriented programs for women.  

Although the coalition is new,  
it is probably already the best  
chance real change has in the  
criminal justice system. There is  
no other group so all-  
encompassing and so free to  
become an effective power block  
for attaining and ensuring equal  
rights and protection for women,  
from the time of initial police  
contact through the end of parole or  
release.

women. Many women who are  
in the institution have been  
abused or used by men. I think  
there's a strong need for women  
who have been incarcerated to  
see themselves as strong, whole  
people that can return to their  
homes and own lives. They need  
to be in a facility that can best  
help them do that. For some of  
them, that means being in a coed  
facility where they can start  
working on what those problems  
with men have been about with  
men and with some sort of  
neutral, supportive help. In other  
instances, I think women need to  
be separate.  

But, you can still have a  

separate institution that sets up  
women to be dependent on men.  
BMR: Like the women’s prison?  
BM: Yes. I think what's impor-  
tant is the philosophy of the staff  
and Division being devoted to  
women gaining control of their  
lives. Neither a separate or a  
coed facility is a panacea.  
BMR: I noticed at the coalition  
meeting that all the women  
aren't strongly feminist in orien-  
tation. How do you go about  
dealing with different political  
perspectives?  
BM: The coalition is new. It's  
struggling for existence and  
trying to meet some common  
ground. Most of us want to do  
that because we know no one  
faction is going to bring about  
change or be able to do away  
with the women’s prison alone.  
My personal belief is that I don’t  
want to bolster the penal system  
by bringing in better programs.  
I'm not interested in what is  
called ‘penal reform.’  

I've watched the coalition through  

the course of several meetings  

and women in more traditional  
viewpoints begin to question  
things like prostitution. Why  
does the woman go to jail and  
not the man? Why is prostitution  
a crime anyway?  

There must be a power block  
that can come to agreement on  
some basic premises. The fact  
that we came to the agreement  
that this state doesn’t need a  

women’s penitentiary is one  
heavy-duty change. Each point  
we can touch base on is impor-  
tant. The person to be concerned  
about is the woman in prison,  
not this individual or that group.  
The woman who is locked up is  
important.  
BMR: How do you walk the line  
between your personal prin-  
ciples and working within the  
system?  
BM: I do a lot of agonizing. I have  
to ask myself even daily if I'm  
bolstering the system or working  
for change. The criminal justice  
system isn't going to change  
until there are people of integrity  
in it. I see that in people like Rudy  
San Phillippo. He's bucking  
tremendous odds in the com-  
munity, in the courts,  
everywhere. I also see a need for  
people outside the system to  
challenge, to question, to  
pressure and to push for change.  
Working inside is not an easy  
decision to make because I'm in  
a system that I personally feel is  
corrupt and de-humanizing and  
rotten. But we're going to have  
prisons for a long time and we  
need good people to work inside.  
BMR: Given the social and  
economic causes of female  
crime, would you agree that  
virtually all women prisoners are  
political prisoners?  
BM: No, I can’t say that all  
women prisoners are political  
prisoners. I do feel I can say the  
majority of women and men who  

are prisoners are imprisoned  
because of our economic  
system. I would say that  

probably the vast majority of  
women in mental hospitals and  
prisons are victims of the social-  
political-economic system of  
this country. In terms of being  
political prisoners, I'm not ready  
to say that. I may be ready to say  
that in a few months or a few  
years. I will say women have  

of the quality that I have been able to  
who are  

class system. A political  
prisoners? I don’t know. I haven't  
reached the point where I can  
put every crime in a political  
perspective. I will say I put more  
crimes there than I did two years  
ago. It’s not a closed attitude.

application of feminist principle. Feminist principle includes non-sexist  
role stereotyping, non-competition, non-aggression and non-warlike,  
non-judgmental in terms of personal actions.  

It is logical for established socialist groups to be anti-feminist.  
Feminism, in both theory and action, is a bigger threat to male inspired  
and implemented socialism than the most virile manifestation of  
capitalist imperialism could ever be. They have proven over and over  
again their unwillingness to talk with feminists and their willingness to  
disrupt feminist gatherings. It is time to ban the disruptors and get on  
with the work.  

We have seen only a glimpse of the strength of international  
feminism. We have seen strong women in the United States fight and  
change their situations and those of their sisters. Through strong and  
complete analysis and knowledge of the situations of women in other  
countries we cannot but help support and strengthen international  
feminism. It will not be an easy job and it is past time to begin.
