book review  

Juana Marie Paz  

Americans, more than many  
people, are severely addic-  
ted to some very dangerous  
myths. We live in a dis-  
posable society, a throwa-  
way culture. The homeless  
are our human refuse, rem-  
nants of a culture that as-  
signs a pathologically high  
value to independence and  
productivity. America is a  
land where you are what you  
consume and produce.  

Homelessness in America  
offers a methodical and com-  
passionate examination of  
a problem that some people  
don't want to admit—which  
is that while we sit around  
and talk about our oppres-  
sion and the hard times,  
that we often take for  
granted: heat, shelter, pri-  
vacy, running water, toilet,  
and a place to call our own,  
even if it's rented and a  
dump. An exceptional value  
at $5, postage included,  
with 70 photos, this is a  
well-written and highly  
readable full-size book.  

The book contains little  
in the way of rhetoric and  
moralizing, just informa-  
tion and an assessment bas-  
ed on direct experience.  

Both authors spent time on  
the streets, visiting shel-  
ters and eating at soup kit-  
chens to see what being  
without a home is really  
like. This seems to have  
been somewhat in response to  
government insistence that  
the homeless are out there  
by choice. The authors re-  
port a sense of isolation  
and loss of self-esteem  
which quickly encompassed  
their lives. They also found  
that in many cases the poor  
had made a wise choice by  
avoiding shelters that a-  
mount to nothing more than  
voluntary jails, with vio-  
lent guards, filthy or in-  
adequate bedding and endless  
indignities such as strip  
searches, theft of personal  
property and in one case,  
using ammonia fumes to wake  
people up in the morning.  
Most shelters are filled to  
capacity every night and  
many are miles away from the  
soup kitchens people must  
walk to for their only meal.  
The stereotype of those  
without shelter has tradi-  
tionally been a skid row  
alcoholic, an older or el-  
derly male, but the face of  
the homeless is changing.  
More families, more women  
and children and more young  
people are seeking emergency  
food and shelter. Unemploy-  
ment, the depopulation of  
mental hospitals and the de-  
crease in low-income housing  
as well as massive budget  
cuts during the Reagan ad-  
ministration are given as  
major sources of displace-  
ment. What is the official  
response?  

When confronted, govern-  
ment officials initially  
deny the existence of the  
homeless, and then point  
with pride to the services  
they have been forced to  
provide. Simultaneously,  
they look for new ways to  
avoid providing the ser-  
vices.  

The book has almost two  
dozen chapters, including  
a foreword by Daniel Berri-  
gan, S.J. So-called welfare  
and entitlement programs are  
explained step-by-step and  
I am glad to report that  
Homelessness in America is  
not ultimately a discourag-  
ing book. However, it is an  
emotionally stirring and  
unsettling book. As a wel-  
fare mother and former wel-  
fare rights advocate, I un-  
derstand the cycle of pov-  
erty and the stigma and

blame attached to being poor.  
Perhaps the hardest task for  
those of us who care but  
feel politically helpless  
and economically marginal,  
is simply not to give in  

to despair. It is easy to  
become emotionally over-  
whelmed by the information  
in this book. However, re-  
cent major achievements by  
the Community for Creative  
Non-Violence give cause  

for much hope. According to  
a January 1984 press re-  
lease, the anniversary of  
Dr. Martin Luther King,  
Jr.'s birthday marked the  
opening of a 1,000 bed shel-  
ter at the former Federal  
City College building in  
Washington, D.C. CCNV will  
operate the new shelter at  
no cost to the government  
for approximately $1.50  

per person per night. The  
agreement is for temporary  
use of the building through  
March 31, 1984 and is the  
result of a White House  
announcement last March  
that unused or under-  
utilized federal buildings  
could be put into service  
as emergency shelters  

where needed, requested and  
available. According to  
CCNV the agreement, reached  
on Dec. 23, 1983, “represents  
a long-overdue beginning  
of the fulfillment of  
that commitment."  

What is the relationship  
between feminism and pover-  
ty and what should the fem-  
inist response be? Are we  
really just a white middle-  
class movement that only  
cares about passage of the  
ERA and getting ahead pro-  
fessionally? Or, still in  
our infancy as a political  
force, is it too soon for  
our impact to be felt? Are  
our priorities wrong or in-  
sensitive to the poor? Do  
those of us who live in pov-  
erty or on welfare just  
grin and bear it without  
considering our existence  
a political act of resist-  
ance and survival? Do wom-  
en individually blame other  
women who are struggling  
economically? What can we  
do about it, anyway?  

While it is true that the  
women's movement has come  
a long way in a brief space  
of time, it is also true  
that racism and classism re-  
main continuing challenges  
and sources of division am-  
ong us. And solutions have  
been proposed, time and  
time again. The negative in-  
come tax, or guaranteed an-  
nual income could be run by  
an expanded IRS and bring  
everyone up to the current  
poverty level, regardless  
of category. If the only  
criteria was need and not  

family size or the absence  
of a man in the house the  
program could completely el-  
iminate poverty. Regarding  
world hunger, the work of  
Frances Moore Lappé in Diet  
For A Small Planet and Food  
First amply documents the  
fact that there is no real  
shortage. Resources are  
simply distributed unevenly.  
On the specific issue of  
homelessness, this book  
makes it clear that there  
simply are not enough jobs  
and low-income housing un-  
der our present capitalist  
structure and more community  
control is needed.  

While focusing on the  
specific issue of homeless-  
ness, this book provides an  
excellent overview of pover-  
ty in America in its many  
forms. The following statis-  
tics are offered with a  
warning that numbers alone  
do not tell the whole story:  

There are 2-3 million  
homeless people in America;  

- 30 million Americans  
live below the official pov-  
erty line;  

- Black and Hispanic women  
are the largest groups liv-  
ing in poverty;  

- Poverty among the elder-  
ly, who are mostly women,  
is increasing;  

- 25% of American families  
are classified as low-income  
—living between the pover-  
ty line and $18,000 per  
year.  

In addition, we learn  
that, "With startling sud-  
denness, women have appear-  
ed on the streets and their  
numbers are growing." (The  
number of women in prison  
has also been on the in-  
crease.) And, "Depending  
on the count, anywhere from  
one-third to two-thirds of  
the homeless population as  
a whole are thought to suf-  
fer from significant psy-  
chiatric problems." This  
statistic is quoted along  
with the observation that,  
"Most of what has been la-  
beled schizophrenia among  
the poor is dysfunction  
resulting from the trauma  
of environmental stress  
factors." What kind of  
mental health do we expect  
from those subject to  
chronic abuse, deprivation  
and indifference? The term  
classism seems inadequate  
to describe the pervading  
sense of contempt and hos-  
tility with which the poor  
are dismissed and blamed.  

Though I highly recommend  
this book and applaud the  
authors and the movement  
they represent, it has its  
limitations. For instance,
