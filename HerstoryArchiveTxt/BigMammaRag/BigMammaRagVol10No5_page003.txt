greetings of strength & soli-
darity to yazmin who now sits
in jail cuz of the madness of
the grand jury...to fulani &

eve who have been temporarily
sprung from that same madness
...to jerri gaines who awaits
the state's star chamber...to

Stand Together Wit

ing on one another. it means
that womyn, white feminists
in particular have found it
possible to obtain & maintain
leadership on yet another
level of revolutionary work.
no doubt these lessons were
learned from & with some
mighty strong 3rd world sis-
ters...& that is real growth

solidarity statement

those of you who are here to-
day...& especially to the
RATF. 4 years ago i was con-
victed of an expropriation
that was claimed by the Geo-
rge Jackson Brigade, a group
of freedom fighters active in
the Pacific Northwest. the
GJB grew out of the prison sup-
port movement & comprised of
cons & ex-cons, blacks & whi-
tes, men & women, dykes &
faggots.

i support the work & strug-
gle of the RATF and see it as
living proof of an extremely
important advance in the prac-
tice of progressive forces in
this country. it represents
the unity of black & white
freedom fighters in the very
necessary high security (read
that trust) job of expropria-
tion. such unity has been
practiced before but never
has it been so openly acknow-
ledged & talked about across
the land.

yes, just as freedom fight-
ers are necessary, expropria-
tions are necessary. just as
revolution will always be de-
clared illegal by the state,
it will also always be expen-
sive. this is the 20th cen-
tury in a patriarchal imperi-
alist world where everything
costs plenty. this is one
reality that needs to be re-
cognized!

the RATF represents a prac-
tical understanding of the
basic right of new afrikans
to a nationalist position as
determined by themselves. it
represents unity & growth to-
wards an international con-
cept of the power struggles
going on in this world. it
has taken many changes & much
struggle for the conception
of this RATF baby. it means
that it is possible to over-
come the amerikkkan racist
ideology that keeps black &
white from building such strong
unity. a unity that means en-
gaging in life & death con-
frontations together, depend-

««ethis is birth!!

now is a time when the right
wing is attempting to revive
the nuclear family with the
family protection act. this
legislation is blatantly ho-
mophobic, racist, & anti-
union. womyn are suddenly ap-
pearing in soldier of fortune
as competent shooters & mer-
cenaries in S. Africa. such
tactics are attempts to di-
vert us with confusion.

the strong will not allow
such confusion to silence
their demands or stop their
search for knowledge & wis-
dom. the strong will read &
discuss the BLA communique of
nov 5, '81 which explains
"a racist genocidal war be-
ing waged against black peo-
ple in amerika necessitated a

revolutionary response...".
the strong will listen to what

is said by the imprisoned
RATF members. strong amazons
& various other warriors will
continue to struggle through

whatever is necessary to-
wards building unity with
3rd world peoples on all
levels. the strong will be-
gin to understand the les-
sons of john brown. it is
in our own interest that we
do this & in the interest
of every living creature on
this planet.

we cannot again allow our
own interests to be served
while our 3rd world allies
are sold down the river. the
white womyn's movement has
to assume its responsibility
of truly understanding amer-
ikkkan genocide...of under-
standing who the real ter-
rorists are...who is making
war on womyn & children by
cutting food & education
programs? who systematically
encourages rape & child a-
buse? who allows police to
beat suspects or shoot them
in the back? & what color
are the majority of these
victims of state sanctioned
violence?

H Pride & Principles

now is the time to stand
together with pride & prin-
ciples to show our resist-
ance to the government's
grand juries, to cointelpro
programs, to the proposed
new criminal code which will
only create more & more re-
pression. there is a brink's
grand jury, a puerto rico
grand jury, there are police
kicking in poet's doors,
there are RATF sisters cag-
ed in a men's prison, there
are brothers who were beaten
so badly that they are slow-
ly dying from lack of medi-
cal attention, what you let
happen to these people &
their struggles could very
well happen to you when the
U.S. government gets tired
of your particular resist-
ance!

more will die or live poor
butchered half-lives if you
fail to act. Do what must
be done, discover your hu-
manity & your love in revo-
lution. pass on the torch,
join us, give up your life
for the people..." george
jackson

"...we must create shields
that protect us & spears
that penetrate our enemies..."
assata shakur

let me close by sending
love & struggle towards bet-
ter days filled with better
ways of more & stronger unity

day 461

It's been a month of malnutrition, money and military
might. His highness Haig holds meetings to appease Argentina
but makes it known that the U.S. will support Raygun's supply-
side ally from across the Atlantic. In her 3 years in office
Thatcher-Hatchet on the Thames, has supported bills banning
the right to strike and outlawing union shops. Other bills
have tied up union funds and put outrageous financial pen-
alties on unions supporting strikes—not to mention double-
digit inflation, private takeover of nationalized industry
and rampant racism.

Meanwhile, back in the U.S. of A Raygun's military budget
has once again been adjusted upwards, to meet rising costs
of military hardware—the B-1 bomber, which used to cost $2.1
billion now costs $4.8 billion each. The price of an MX mis-
sile has risen from $2 billion to $4.5 billion and the Trident
submarine, from $600 million to $3 billion. American indus-
try reports show that the profit rate for military contracts
is three times as great as it is for civilian contracts.
Chrysler showed a 78% profit on its contracts for army tanks.
Stock in firms which manufacture military hardware is up an
average of 30% while the majority of other industries have
experienced severe drops in the going price for their stock.
375,000 CETA and federal jobs have been axed
to pay for the arms build-up.

Raygun's recently released national
security objectives include "protecting
U.S. economic interests and citizens
abroad" and maintaining “access to
critical materials". To achieve this
goal, the talents of hundreds of
thousands of top scientists, technic- Suddenly I don't
ians and workers are being wasted in feel like dancing
an effort to develop "super weapons". sie

Child (and adult) malnutrition has reached
epidemic proportions among the poor and is spreading into
the homes of the working and middle classes. But the doctors
and technicians are working for the military—and so are
the social workers.

"...settle your quarrels,
come together, understand
the reality of our situation,
understand that fascism is
already here, that people
are already dying who could
be saved, that generations

america held hostage
