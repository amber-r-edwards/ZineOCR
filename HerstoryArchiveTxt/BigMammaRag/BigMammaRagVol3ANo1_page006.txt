UFW Demonstration

Guards Force Women
to Strip — Jeffco Sued

Three women who were
among many women arrested at
a United Farm Workers
demonstration in Wheatridge
last year have filed suit against
the Jefferson County Police
Department. One woman was
literally stripped while a male
guard held her arms; the other
two were forced to undress in
front of gawking guards.

The women were among a
group of United Farm Workers
(UFW) supporters who had been
picketing Applejack Liquors, one
of the largest liquor retailers in
the state. The liquor store has
refused to take Gallo wines off
their shelves in acknowledgment
of the UFW boycott of non-
union grapes used in Gallo
wines.

On the day of the arrests, sup-
porters picketed the store
despite a temporary restraining
order that allowed only two UFW
picketers in front of the outlet at
one time. When about seventeen
patrol cars began to gather
near the area, many people
“smelled trouble” and decided
to leave.

At about the same time the
police singled out two young
Chicanas (who weren't
picketers) as they tried to get into
their car and apprehended them
for no apparent reason. The
police also went after a Chicana
news reporter, mistaking her for
a picketer, according to a story in
the December issue of Voir Dire,
a publication of the National
Lawyers Guild.

“The rest of us moved over
towards them,” says Michelle
Hobart, one woman who is suing
the police. “If what the police did
was not blindly racist, then it
was clearly provocative.

“We had no warning. Most
people would have left if they
had been told to. But the cops
just started grabbing people.
They seemed to be after the UFW
staff.”

“They put plastic handcuffs on
me so tightly that I screamed for
them to take them off,” says
Margie Stuart, another of the
three women suing Jefferson
County. “They tried to take them
off but didn’t know how. My right
hand is still numb sometimes.
It's so obvious to me that when
people are arrested, their rights
are massively violated.”

When the women arrived at
the jail, they insisted on their
rights. All the women were
taken from the bus first and kept
together in a processing room.
They began to sing, were told to
shut up and refused.

They were told that if they
didn’t be quiet they would be put
in solitary confinement. The
threat of being stripped and put
in a dark cell was used as
punishment. The women refused
to be intimidated and wanted
to know what they were being
charged with.

“Then they grabbed Arlene
(Arlene Irlando who is the third
woman filing suit) to show that
they meant business,” Stuart
says. “When we protested, they
grabbed me. They put the three
of us in a small cell and ordered
us to strip. We refused because
the door was wide open and
because they were using it as a
punishment because we were
insisting on our rights. The male
guards were staring in at us.

“The matron said that we
committed a felony and that they
didn’t care what we thought. In
here (the jail) ‘we are the law.’
We told them that the same law
applies inside a jail as outside
one.”

The matron then brought in
three male guards. The women
started yelling to keep verbal
contact with the rest of the
women still in the processing
room. “We wanted them to
know exactly what was happen-
ing to us. We challenged their
right to inflict punishment on us.
We weren't frightened and we
were on the offensive insisting
on our rights. This is what scared
them.

“They simply couldn't accept
the view that a ‘prisoner’ has any
rights. We weren't allowed to
call a lawyer or make a phone
call and we weren't told our
rights.”

The women were separated by
the guards. Hobart and Irlando
were taken to another cell and
Stuart was held by a guard while
the matron took her clothes off.

“When they said they were
going to separate us,” continues
Hobart, “I didn’t want to go. I
held onto the bars. A guard hit
my hands. On the way out of the
cell I was bending over from the
pain; he thought I was resisting
and kicked me. I hit my head on
the cellblock and got blood all
over.

“They wanted to impress on
us that they could control
anything we did. So when
Arlene tried to walk out of the
cell, a guard stepped on her
shoelaces and said, ‘you're not
going anywhere, girlie.’”

The two women were then
forced to strip in full view of male
guards. They were told that
Stuart was not cooperating and
that when she did they would all
be allowed to have their rights.

The guards tried to turn the
other women who were
prisoners in the jail against the
women who were arrested at
the picketing.

The only prisoner who didn't
want the UFW women to sing
and be disruptive in the jail was
one woman who was sentenced
to six months and wanted to
keep her special privilege of
drinking iced tea in the lobby.

The women believe that their
experience in the jail that after-
noon was “nothing” compared
to the degradation, humiliation,
and violence that farmworkers
have to experience daily. They
know how “prisoners’ rights are
constantly violated. The men
who picketed were brutalized
while being arrested — the
women were mistreated while
they were in jail.

After being held until that
evening, the women were all
released on bond. They were
charged with civil contempt and
filed the suit against the police
department in December for
$50,000 in damages.

tinues.
