relax without men.”

THE THREE SISTERS

The Three Sisters is the oldest and
largest women's bar in Denver located
at 34th and Mariposa Sts. It is very
crowded on weekends, overflowing with
dancers and loud music. On weeknights
it is quiet and there is a Happy Hour
from 4 to 7 when drinks are 70¢, bot-
tled beer 50¢ and drafts 25¢.

The Three Sisters has been in Denver
for three and a half years. The mana-
gers see the bar as catering "to all
kinds of women, whether they be busi-
ness women holding leading positions
or women without jobs." Unlike many
gay bars, they do not want to over-
charge the "gay crowd" and so they
keep the prices of their drinks down.

The managers feel that the bar is a
place where women know they won't be
hassled by anyone as they would be in
a straight bar. Women can dance and be
close to each other. "Women feel a
sense of belonging here. It is a place
where they can relax and let go."

"A woman can find a friend here
because the vibes are good and the
people are friendly.” When asked about

cruising, a bartender said, "There is
not as much cruising here as in a
straight bar."

Over the years the bar has become
well known. Women come from all over
Colorado in order to be with other
women in a relaxed, social atmosphere.
It is like an oasis.

The Three Sisters has had countless
benefits for women's groups and for
individual women who are in the hospi-
tal without any medical insurance.

They have held benefits twice for BMR.
They see themselves as serving the
community at large also. Their most
recent benefit was for Muscular Distro-
phy.

They have done well financially. The
bar now supports two full-time employ-
ees as well as the owners who are wo-
men. Max, the cook, runs her business
separately.

Max's Kitchen serves double cheese-
burgers and B.L.T.'s, etc. Max would
like to start serving sit-down dinners
on weeknights when the bar is quiet.
This may begin in December.

The managers will take requests for
new records on the juke box. If you
want some different songs, write them
down and give them to the bartender
and she will send them to the juke box
company. It takes about 2-3 weeks to
get a new record on the juke box. The
only kind of music they will not accept
is cock rock.

On every Tuesday night there is a
pool tournament. Anyone can sign up on
the list ahead of time for $1.50. There
are three prizes: first is $15 and a
new pool stick; second is $10; third
is $5.

When the cigarette smoke gets to you,
you can request that the managers turn
on the fan. Unfortunately, it gets too
cold to leave it on long in the winter,
but you can ask.

Local women poets have read at the
Three Sisters, including Chocolate Wat-
ers and Woodwoman. Many women's bands
and musicians have performed there also
for example, Holly Near, Madilyn
Mendelsohn and Raw Honey.

Most recently, The Berkeley Women's
Music Collective played here on Novem-
ber 1. It was a Monday night, but the
bar was packed and women had to sit on

the floor. Excitement and high energy
filled the room as the group gave a
lively performance. Old and new friends
met, laughed and danced together. This
kind of event happens at the
Three Sisters because women have come
to love this bar. It is one of the social

and cultural centers of the women's
community. Denver
The Three Sisters is located

next to the Valley Highway or I-25.
Get off at Exit 107 and keep bear-
ing right to 3358 Mariposa. Their
phone number is 458-8926.

Feminism and bars

IT IS VERY RARE TO HAVE A POLITICAL
CONVERSATION IN A BAR, MANY WOMEN
DON'T HAVE MUCH POLITICAL CONSCIOUS-
NESS.

JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE WOMEN HERE
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S A SOCIAL GATHERING.
THEY'RE BARS, THAT'S ALL. GOOD BARS.

NOTICE: The next issue of Big
Rag will be mailed in late January,
1977. It will be a double, January-
February issue focusing on the
theme of Feminism and the Left.

Versus Velvet Hammer

I GO TO THE SISTERS TO MEET PEOPLE
AND DANCE. I BRING PEOPLE I ALREADY
KNOW TO THE HAMMER WHICH IS MORE
MELLOW.

COMEDY IN SIX UNNATURAL ACTS - a loving satire of the
stereotyped images of lesbians filmed in a style
which is also a spoof on different genres of Holly-
wood films (silent movies, chorus lines, etc.)

IN A LOUD BAR, YOU CAN'T HAVE A
DECENT CONVERSATION BECAUSE THE MUSIC
IS TOO LOUD. THERE ARE ALL THESE
SEXUAL INNUENDOS AND YOU CAN'T START
A CONVERSATION WITHOUT THE WOMAN
THINKING YOU ARE COMING ON TO HER.

HOME MOVIE - autobiographical film combining current
documentary footage of the lesbian community with
actual home movies of the filmmaker as a young
child and teenager.

I'M NOT ONE OF 'EM - a short about lesbianism and the
roller derby.

I LIKE TO COME TO THE SISTERS BECAUSE
THERE IS NO FAG-HAG ATMOSPHERE LIKE
AT THE BROADWAY.

THE SISTERS HAS A GREAT SOUND SYSTEM
FOR DANCING.

IT IS DIFFERENT ON WEEKENDS THAN ON
WEEKNIGHTS (AT THE SISTERS). THE POOL
TABLE CLOSES ON WEEKENDS.

PEOPLE ACT DIFFERENT AT DIFFERENT
BARS; FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE MUSIC IS
MORE FEMINIST IN LYRICS AND QUIETER
AND THERE IS CANDLELIGHT, WOMEN ARE
SOFTER TOWARD EACH OTHER THAN AT
RAUCOUS BARS.
