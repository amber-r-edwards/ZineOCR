BIG MAMA RAG
KICKING!

As reflected in current figures, Big Mama Rag is running consistently
in the red. This results in papers being delayed and significant energy
being diverted. BMR has not raised its subscription rates in many years
and would like to avoid doing so.

In order to help ensure the survival of BMR we have pledged monthly do-
nations and would like to ask other women to support this valuable part
of the women's movement in the same way.

If you can contribute even a few dollars a month please complete the form
below and return it with your check to BMR. Your contribution could make
the difference.
