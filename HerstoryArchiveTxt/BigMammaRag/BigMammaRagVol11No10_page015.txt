The Women's Eye Film Festi-
val Crew has already had one
fun-filled evening of lesbian
films and a dance and another
educational evening of read-
ers theatre and film before
the anti-electroshock therapy
demonstration, October 22. We
began our existence in June
when a small group of suppor-
ters of Big Mama Rag, femin-
ist newspaper, saw that BMR
was in serious financial dis-
tress. We all wanted to keep
seeing BMR in print so we
brainstormed ways to make
money for the project to con-
tinue.

Some of
and other

the group's members
supporters had a
yard sale that brought in
enough to pay for June's
mailing, rent and misc. other
expenses, and had a few dol-
lars left to help rent a
film.

We then had a benefit eve-
ning of films followed by a
dance. The proceeds from
this event went to BMR to
pay bills with and some of
the money was put aside for
future Women's Eye events.

The Women's Eye Liberation
Film Festival group's main
objectives are to bring un-
derexposed/unexposed politi-
cal activist films into the
Denver area, and raise money
and consciousness for the
growth and progress of our
movement.

After the June showing, the
Women Psychiatric Inmates
Liberation Front approached
us about doing a benefit for
them. On October 21, we show-
ed an anti-psychiatric film
entitled Hurry Tomorrow in
support of the anti-shock
demonstration the next day
as part of the North Ameri-
can Day of Demonstration
Against Electroshock. Because
of the popularity, widespread
use, and support of therapy of
all kinds in the femin-
ist, lesbian and leftist
communities and because of
the disproportionate numbers
of us locked up in psychia-
tric institutions, we, in
the Women's Eye, feel that
this issue, especially,
needs to be examined, debat-
ed and exposed. Sometime in
the near future we'll be show-
ing more films and videos
about psychiatry and therapy.
In December, the Women's
Eye will be featuring several
underpublicized political
films, including Mitsuye and
Nellie, A Wives Tale, and
Born In Flames. The proceeds
from this 3-week festival
will again go to BMR.

Mitsuye and Nellie is a
film of two women's poetry
dramatically expressing the
immigrant experience of Asian
American women in a society
contemptuous and suspicious
of "Orientals." This film is
about tenderness and anger
between mothers and daughters,
generational conflicts and
the breaking of stereotyped
images of Asian American wo-
men.

A Wives Tale is an award-
winning feature documentary
about the wives of striking
Canadian miners, and how
their participation in the
strike transformed their
lives.

Born In Flames is a poli-
tically provocative science-
fiction docu-drama posing
the questions of whether op-
pression against women will
be eliminated by any social
system, now or in the future.
Set in New York City ten
years after “the Social Dem-
ocratic War of Liberation,"
the film features an anar-
chist band of women, who
eventually take up arms
against the government,
which has failed to respond
to the economic needs of
the women.

Our schedule has Mitsuye
and Nellie being shown as
part of a double feature
(the other film yet to be
announced) on Saturday, Dec.
3 at Our Lady of Guadalupe
Hall, 3610 Lipan. 7 p.m. and 9 p.m.

A Wives Tale will be shown
at the Slightly Off Center
Stage, 2557 15th St. on Wed.,
December 14th at 7 p.m. and 9 p.m.

Born In Flames will be
shown on Saturday, December
17th at the Guadalupe Church
Hall, also at 7 p.m. & 9 p.m.
