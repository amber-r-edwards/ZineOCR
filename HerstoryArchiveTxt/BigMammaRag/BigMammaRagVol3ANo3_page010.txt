Alta:

Anybody Could Write This Poem

Susanne Juhasz

Alta: “I stand in my own pain / &
sing my own song”

Alta was a feminist poet way
back when (in the sixties!) there
was not so much company. In
1969 she founded and still
operates Shameless Hussy
Press, to publish “books I need.”
Her own books include No Visi-
ble Means of Support, Letters to
Women, Song of the Wife /
Song of the Mistress, True
Story, and, from Times Change
Press, Burn This And Memorize
Yourself and the recent Mom-
ma.

In its anger (and joy) Alta’s
poetry does not lie. It isn’t true
life, it is poetry, but the electric
connection between the two
kinds of truth is not severed. For
some, the poems are shocking,
because they are too honest:
“How can I do this? / How can I
write this need? / Have I no
shame?” she herself asks. But it
is necessary that the need be
written: “Because my song is my
life / & you can’t have just my
poems. / We're a package deal.”

Honest, these poems lack
“decorum,” that heretofore
primary criterion for women’s
language. They shock when they
speak to men (in this case, her
husband): “Take me to the woods
sometime instead of / your
girlfriend / see how you like it.”
They shock more profoundly
when they speak to women —
not through men, because of
men, about men, or for men —
but to women directly.

Where are you turning? We're
opening, we're opening, hold
my hand, my body's opening.

Alta’s lyrics distill experience
into a kind of purity; they also
engage experience at a level of
direct feeling that makes them
terse and powerful.

“Euch, are you having
your period?”

“Why didn't you tell me?”

“I shoulda fucked him
in the dark,”

Siby!-Child

New Women’s Quarterly Shows Promise

Angela Wilson

One of the major difficulties
I've had in reviewing Siby/-Child
(a new women’s quarterly from
Maryland), is the fact that the
first issue contains little to
recommend it.

Though all three of the prose
articles are of an analytic nature,
only one (ON THE EXCAVATION
OF MOVIE CULTURE: Olivia de
Havilland’s THE HEIRESS) com-
bines a fine writing style with a
thorough subject analysis. Hav-
ing never read Henry James's
short story, Washington
Square, nor seen the film adap-
tation which netted de Havilland
an Oscar in 1949, this writer had
no difficulty in understanding
comparisons of the two which
Pat Dowell made in her article.
Dowell’s clear style of writing
provides a welcome change
from the usual dry movie review,
as well as exploring the
characters, their interplay and
presentation with an alive eye.

Candyce H. Stapen’s article,
“WOMAN-PORTENT: Dis-
enchanting the Fairy Tale” ex-
amines stories from the Brothers
Grimm (because of their longevi-
ty, cross-cultural popularity, and
their combination of symbol and
fantasy ...”), but does so by mak-
ing excerpts from the tales the ar-
ticle instead of using them for il-
lumination. A clearer and less

“He coulda thought bloody
sheets. Look ma, a virgin.”

*

“You think weeping sounds bad,
you should hear me laugh.”

The compression in such poems
results in an accompanying ex-
pansion, which however takes
place in the mind of the
reader/listener. I am talking
about the impact from these
poems, an after-image or after-
taste, a reverberation that oc-
curs when the poem connects to
a place of feeling within me.

Alta’s poems come out of
private and politicized woman's
experience. She writes to and
about her lovers (female and
male), children, friends, and
enemies; she writes out of long-
ing, anger, pain, desire, frustra-
tion, joy, loneliness, bitterness
and pride. These intensely per-
sonal emotions are political,
because Alta knows that her
own suffering can speak to
others, too; that, ultimately, it
must speak to others if ever it is
to be overcome; “The wounded
recognize each other. / Our
wounds will heal us.”

Poetry is a way of speaking:
“Your tiny body warms my
breast”; “If you won’t make love
to me, at least / get out of my
dreams!” It is the poem itself
that serves as the agent of con-
nection between people. For the
poem to work the
reader/listener has to take part
(as herself/himself, as the per-
son to whom the poem is ad-
dressed, as the speaker of the
poem). To cause such response
this kind of poem usually does
not use the imaginative transfor-
mations of figurative language,
of metaphor and simile. Rather,
it calls on the impact of the literal
detail to fly directly like an arrow,
to touch feeling to feeling. There
is in such poetry an inherent dis-
trust of a language (a sexist
language) that has always
before been used to deceive, to

ambiguous analysis and conclu-
sion would stand this article in
good stead.

Though chock full of statistics
that pick up where Alice Em-
bree’s “Media Images: Madison
Avenue Brainwashing — the Facts
(which was printed in Sisterhood
is Powerful)” left off, Charlene
Ventura’s “Ad Liberation: The
Feminist Impact” does not pick up enough. The article should have
questioned the shys behind
advertisement’s blatant
pressure on women in greater
detail. Ventura seems satisfied
that Clairol has adopted the
slogan, “You're not getting
older, you're getting better” in
the place of, “If I have one life to
live, let me live it as a blonde.”
Unfortunately, no matter how
it's wrapped, it's still the same
package: Clairol’s no exception.
The information contained in the
article though, does make it well
worth the reading.

As for the poetry in the issue,
Patricia H. Gayet's pieces, “THE
TAXIDERMIST” and “Celtic
Grandmother” move extremely
well. The rest of the poetry in
Siby/-Child left a bad taste in my
mouth; too much of it seemed
random lines placed on paper
and nothing more. The rest was
lazy writing containing one or
two good gems.

“Distance, to separate: ‘My
history books lied to me. They
said I didn’t exist’; ‘Don’t tell
anyone about our affair. I intend
to run for city council.’ / -Bob.”

“How can I reach out
with poetry
when words are such
faulty fingers?”

To work, poetry must be
removed from the realm of “fan-
tasy”: “Come honest to the bone.
/ Peel away the lies / (I’m
afraid),” she writes in a poem
called “IT’S THE REAL THING AT
THE BACK OF YOUR MIND.” A
difficult thing to do: “It’s not that I
lie, it’s just / sometimes I like to
hide a little bit. / That’s a lie, I
don’t like / to have to hide at all.”
But this poem persists in reveal-
ing, baring its speaker as it, and
she, look at her hands, with nails
that aren't pretty, hands that
“are strong & can make music /
& fix a press”; at her titties that
are “funny” because “those
children loved my milk”; at her
scarred skin and high
cheekbones:

...I don’t

look like what you've
been taught to want.

My body looks like me,
like a strong woman

who has survived a lot
& come out =

dancing.

Here I am.

(I’m afraid)

Here I am...

It's my face & I stand behind it.
Here I am.

It is the poem that brings her to
make the final declaration
without, finally, the refrain of
fear. The poem works to make
language (and people) honest. It
works to bring about “recogni-
tion” — in this way, to heal.
“Could a poem be a cup / to
pour joy into?” she writes in a
poem whose title itself supplies
the answer: “ANYBODY
COULD WRITE THIS POEM. ALL
YOU HAVE TO SAY IS YES.”

Rebekah Hoffsommer’s
graphics are nice: one only
wishes there were more of
them. The artist uses space well,
and she also makes the tree
roots in one drawing appear to
be bursting with life. If the issue
had been mine I would have cut
it apart for that one page.

Siby/-Child can be a good
journal and I hope it will be. I feel
rather nasty reviewing the first
issue as so much changes about
a publication with time and
familiarity with the work. Siby/-
Child cannot help but change for
the better as so much of it looks
extremely promising.

Off to a Crawling Start

BMR Library Opens!!

Susan Hayes

The first feminist library in the
area is now operating. Oh, it’s
pretty small scale at this point,
but there are some good titles
available, such as Against Rape,
By A Woman Writ, Lesbian Na-
tion, Mothers and Amazons, and
Yesterday's Lessons. There is a
fairly good variety of material
also, from heavy to humorous,
anthologies of poetry, even a
sprinkling of bull shit.

Roberta Karsh of Footnote
Bookstore, bless her, started the
ball rolling with a donation of
several new titles. Books to be
donated to the library may be
purchased at cost at her Larimer
Square store. It surely wouldn't
hurt to patronize those who give
us their support either.

The library was started by a
committee of two non-
librarians, one of whom roams
libraries for hours hoping the
book she wants will jump out of

Vietnamese Orphans

Orphans, 700,000 of them,
are a concern to her. Our guilt-
ridden money sent to help them,
never gets there, filtered down
through the hands of corrupt of-
ficials. The children eat
American rice, watered down,
rationed out sparingly. Her
carrots and celery would be a
luxury to them. Thich Mandala is
the President of the Committee
for Aid to Orphans in Vietnam.
Groups wishing to help the great
numbers of these orphans
should contact Thich Mandala
herself at this address in order to
assure the money gets to those
for whom it is intended.

Venerable Thich Mandala

Committee for Aid to the

Orphans in Vietnam

19 rue Chaptal

Of women in Vietnam she
speaks very positively and
strongly, although she says that
all people who are dominated
must be liberated. Women have

the shelves at her. She is hoping
someone who knows about
decimal systems and cataloging
will miraculously appear before
the library grows too large.
Seriously, woman-power is
needed to solicit donations, light
fire under people, or just to dust
the darn things.

Right now, to borrow a book all
a person has to do is sign the
sheet and hopefully place a
small donation in the container
conspicuously labeled “Library
Fund.” Donations of either new
or used books are appreciated as
much as money; after all, that’s
what it’s going to be used for
anyway. Speaking about used
books, everybody's got a few
feminist books they've either
grown out of or never look at any
more. Why not give them to the
library instead of letting them
gather dust? There is bound to be
some woman who would ap-
preciate reading them.

‘

suffered most because of the
war, she says. They have held
families together, taught the
Vietnamese language and
traditions to the children, and
fought the war as well. The
women of Vietnam have been
forced into prostitution and
greatly oppressed by the many
“isms,” imperialism, fascism,
etc. Further, she states, there
are many of these “isms” within
every woman, and we must rid
ourselves of these first in a per-
sonal liberation. When this is ac-
complished, we must have
organization and direction to the
movement.

“I am very proud to be a
woman,” she beams radiantly.
“We each have our own
characteristics, our own abilities
to make life.” She is beautiful,
warm, poetic.

Before leaving we grasp
hands, strong, positive, power
within the frail body. A desire to
warn her of the perils of the lec-
ture circuit rises to the surface,
but remains unspoken.
