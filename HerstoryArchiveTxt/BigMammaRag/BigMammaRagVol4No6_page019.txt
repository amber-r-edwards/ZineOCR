with sexuality. If this is the  
case, the challenge against  
repressive sexual morality  
has, perhaps, turned into  
nothing more than another  
form of alienation and iso-  
lation by implying that deper-  
sonalized exploitation is  
healthy.  

Another popular idea is the  
“therapeutic view’’ which  
says that no consensual sexual  
behavior should be illegal,  
except incest and some in-  
stances of intercourse with  
minors. The idea behind this  
is that people who have  
‘perverted’ sexual needs  
should be allowed to indulge  
in them, thereby purging the  
repressed urges and fantasies.  
If nothing is taboo, then the  
old restraints will lose their  
strength and people will get  
bored and lose interest, the  
argument goes.  

Opponents of this view say  
that this attitude implies that  
degrading, depersonalized sex

is healthy and that there is  
nothing ‘‘higher’’ to aspire to  
in sexuality. They say that  
what is needed is sex edu-  
cation, not a higher quality of  
pornography that will result  
when everybody has ironed  
out the kinks in their egos.  
They also insist that this  
particular sexual practice ex-  
ploits people and is used as a  
means of alleviating anxiety  
and combating depression.  
Issues of Power  
and Dominance  

But what both sides miss on  
the issue of freedom in the  
bedroom is the issue of power  
and dominance, who has it  
and how it is used. Both sides  
derive their values, ideas,  
laws, actions from the dom-  
inant cultural, social ethic—an  
ethic which serves those in  
power, which was created by  
those in power and which  
works in the interest of those  
in power: men. This male  
ideology populates divergent  
opinions, religions, ideol-  
ogies. And in the pornography

It is almost irrelevant whe-

pornographic material and  
violent crime. The effect of  
pornography goes far beyond  
the ‘isolated’ violent act of a  
criminal individual. Pornography  
reflects an attitude
