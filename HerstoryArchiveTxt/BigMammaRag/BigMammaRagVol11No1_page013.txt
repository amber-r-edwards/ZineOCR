that occurs in families, and  
it is handed down from generation  
to generation through  

a web of physical and emo-  
tional deprivations, and in-  
volves mechanisms researchers  
are just only beginning to  
understand, particularly in  
the area of Fetal Alcohol  
Syndrome (FAS). Other social  
aberrations, such as incest  
and domestic violence, also  
involve behavior patterns  
which travel in families and  
ride piggy-back with alcohol-  
ism.

*On the Rosebud Sioux Reser-  
vation, South Dakota, the  
White Buffalo Calf Woman's  
Society concerns itself with  
the problems of the Indian  
family. It maintains a shel-  
ter for battered women and  
children at Mission, S.D.

The women believe that by  
learning and caring about  
oneself and others, and by  
following the ways of the  
pipe brought to the People  
by the White Buffalo Calf  
Woman, the quality of life  
will improve for their people.

*The Sacred Shawl Society,  
a group of traditional Indian  
women at Pine Ridge, S.D.,  
work in their community to  
counsel and support Indian  
women in crisis situations.  
Roberta Arkeketa, Director of  
their 24-hour Crisis center  
in Pine Ridge states, "In  
Indian society the women were  
considered equal just as the  
children were. In order for  

the tree of life to bloom you  
need all three and none is  
excluded from the sacred  
circle. We see things that  
have to be done within our  
nation to strengthen and nour-  
ish it so it will continue to  
grow instead of diminishing  
it, and each and every one of  
us play an important role in  
the future of our nation whe-  
ther you be man, woman or  
child."

*The Women's Dance birthing  
crew in Minneapolis, Minn.  
serves an urban Indian comm-  
unity with birthing alterna-  
tives and women's health care  
based on traditional Indian  
values. The women of the crew,  
of necessity, have focused  
much of their work on alcohol-  
ism, domestic violence and  
sexual abuse. The women have  
lunar calendars and station-  
ery available for sale which  
they produced themselves to  
support their work. They do  
consulting, counselling,  
workshops and a class series  
and they can be contacted at:

polis, Minn. 55404.

*Native Nevadans for Politi-  
cal Education and Action was  
founded primarily by Indian  
women in 1978 to provide a  
vehicle for political educa-  
tion and organizing of Indian  
communities in Nevada. They  
have been working to oppose  
the MX missile system in Nev-  
ada, and in educating their  
People on nuclear, chemical  
and other environmental is-  
sues. NNPEA represents an im-  

portant function of Native  
Women's movement.

*The Slim Buttes Community  
Council on Pine Ridge, S.D.  
is planting the seeds of a  
new kind of economic develop-  
ment for the traditional comm-  
unity. They have done exten-  
sive community organizing  
within the traditional fami-  
lies of the Oglalas and have  
plans to develop alternative  
housing, food supply and eco-  
nomies based on self-suffi-  
ciency. Loretta Afraid of  
Bear Cook of the Council,  
and her mother, Bea Weasel  
Bear, are lay midwives who  
attend to the needs of mo-  
thers and infants in their  
community. They are in des-  
perate need of donations of  
infants and children's cloth-  
ing, money and birthing sup-  
plies due to the severity of  
the economic depression. The  
unemployment rate at Pine  
Ridge is 87 percent. Contact:

These efforts, described  
in brief, on behalf of the  
cultural survival of native  
American communities by na-  
tive people, are the doors  
to our future. If we are to  
experience that future, we  
must be assured of the gen-  
erations to complete this  
circle in which we are  
travelling.

When western peoples were  
received into the Native  
American continent by gen-  
erous hosts, it was surely  

a case of survival of the  
unfittest. On the shores of  
the industrial world, Indian  
peoples have found debauchery  
of all that is sacred to us;  
of all that holds value for  
us.

When she was involved in  
her investigation into the  
sterilization abuse of Indian  
women, Dr. Connie Uri said,  
"Zero population growth may  
be all right for the white  
man, because he's crowding  
this continent. But for the  
Indian, it's genocidal. Let's  
control our own reproduction,  
instead of meeting the de-  
mands of the white economic-  
social values."

Book Review

tion. Remarkably, these happy  
transformations are rendered  
perfectly believable.

The Color Purple is a cele-  
bration of life, and I say  
this not only because it ends  
happily. Walker is an affirm-  
ative writer in the best  
sense, because of the love  
with which she creates these  
people, imbuing them with dis-  
tinctive personalities, vivid  
bodies and memorable voices.

Despite the book's weakness  
- Nettie's letters - the auth-  
or's generosity of spirit tou-  
ches everything with a kind of  
grace. In her earlier novels  
there was much compassion and  
growth, but in The Color Pur-  
ple there is more sheer, abun-  
dant joy. It's a book that ma-  
kes you want to cry - and sing.
