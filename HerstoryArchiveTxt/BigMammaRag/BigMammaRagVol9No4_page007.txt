‘More Than Ever, They Need Our Help  

Maria, Casa El Salvador  

as told to Debbie Farson  
(ed: the following article is  
reprinted from Union Wage,  
March-April, 1981)  

I have known about repres-  
sion in El Salvador since I  
was a little girl back in the  
40s, because my family was  

very large and very poor. I  
remember wishing to have lots  
of things, but our mother  
used to make bread every day,  
and when I was eight years  
old she used to send me into  
the street every afternoon to  
sell the bread so that we  
could have some extra money.  
My father was a tailor and he  
could make only one pair of  
slacks a day, because he  
couldn't sew at night when  
there was no light. He also  
pressed suits for rich people.  

I was going to school at  
the same time I was selling  
bread. But in a poor family  
with a large number of child-  
ren you can't afford to send  
them all to school. I only  
finished the sixth grade, be-  
cause we needed more money  
and I had to start working. At  
that time my aunt took me with  
her to the capitol, San Salva-  
dor, and sent me to learn how  
to sew. I worked with this  
lady who had a place making  
expensive dresses for rich  
people. I was there for five  
months and she never paid  
me anything. She used me for  
all that time.  

During this time my aunt was  
working as a clerical in the  
biggest drug store in the  

city, so she took me there to  
work. They put me to work  
wrapping the powders for medi-  
cines such as aspirin. When I  
started working there I wasn't  
quite 14 years old and they  
paid me about $16 a month. I  
lived in a home run by Cath-  
olic sisters, which was for  
young girls who didn't have  
much money. I paid $10 a  

month to have a place to stay  
and one meal a day, which con-  
sisted of rice, beans and a

cup of coffee. I stayed there  
four or five years and con-  
tinued working in the drug  
store. Then I knew this fami-  
ly that needed someone to  
come to the United States to  
help their daughter, who was  
living in Miami at the time.  
So I came to the United  
States to live in as a house-  
hold worker when I was 17  
years old.  

That was quite a few years  
ago, but women still have to  
do the same kinds of work in  
El Salvador today. The women  
who work on the farms suffer  
the most. These women have no  
control over having families,  
so that they have six, eight,  
or ten children, and live in  
very bad conditions. During  
the coffee season, October  
to February, these women take  
all of their children and  
leave home at five in the  
morning because they have a  
long way to walk to work. Then  
they have to work all day to  
make $2. Children five years  
or older have to help their  
mother work, and then maybe the  
family will make $3 for a 12-  
15 hour day.  

The farmworkers are now try-  
ing to organize unions. The  
government has never allowed  
women to be in unions. Men  
work on these coffee planta-  
tions as well, but they always  
get paid more, so one of the  
demands is for equal pay.  

Women also do factory work.  
There are sewing factories and  
assembly factories for elec-  
trical things. A lot of the  
clothes sold here in big  
stores have been made in El  
Salvador even though they  
have a label in them that says  
"made in the United States.”  
The women are paid very lit-  
tle, like $3 per day. They  
have to work six days a week  
from about seven in the morn-  
ing to five or six at night,  
without any overtime pay.  

The big companies don't want  
people to join the unions be-  
cause they think that the  
unions won't be good for their  
business. If they find out  
that you belong to the union,  
they either kill you or kick  
you out and make sure you  
can't find another job. But  
people are fighting for unions  
and are asking for better pay,  

because their families need  
to eat three times a day.  

Women work as housekeepers  
too, but that is very bad  
work. They live in with the  
families, never get a day off,  
and get paid only $8 a month.  
They often work from five in  
the morning until ten at night.  
Sometimes the women are treat-  
ed like slaves. They either  
have to eat the leftovers from  
the table or they are given  
10¢ to go to the store to buy  
one egg. These women have to  
do all of the washing, ironing  
it the same day, as well as  
all of the housework and cook-  
ing. They work very hard for  
$8 a month. Mostly these wom-  
en live very far away from  
their families, and if they  
have any children they have  
to leave back home with their  
families.  

Another very common thing  
is a house-daughter. Poor fam-  
ilies will bring their seven  
or eight year old daughters  
to the capitol because that  
is where the families live  
that can afford house-daught-  
ers. This girl then lives with  
the family and learns how to  
do the housework. They use  
this girl, and sometimes the  
father or son will go to bed  
with her. And then when the  
girls get pregnant they are  
kicked out. Sometimes the fam-  
ily will adopt the baby, but  
that doesn't happen all the  
time. Often when the girls  
find out they are pregnant,  
they go and do different  
things to try and have an abor-  
tion. But they don't do it  
right, or it doesn't work, and  
they get infections. Most of  
the time they just die. This  
happens all the time.  

Other women work in the open  
markets. These women buy all  
different kinds of fruits and  
vegetables, and they go from  
one street to another trying  
to make money to feed their  
family. They usually have  
their children with them all  
day long. When the children  
are hungry they just wander,  
begging for food.  

Some women have a little  
education. Like the ones who  
work in the offices. That is  
a different situation, but  
they don't get good pay ei-  
ther. If you want to get a  
good office job, you have to  
be pretty and have a good  
dress. The boss of the company  
then decides whether he likes  
a girl or not. If you are over  
25, even if you are smart and  
can do the job, they don't  
hire you. It goes to the bet-  
ter looking or youngest one.  

There are also women who  
work in stores. This is very  
bad pay too, especially at  
Christmas time when they have  
to work from 8 am until mid-  
night. These women don't have  
unions so they can't ask for  
better conditions or better  
pay.  

Women in El Salvador are  
fighting to be in unions and  
for the unions to be more  
open. They know if they win  
this war, they will get better  
working conditions and things  
like equal pay and equal  
rights. Women can do what men  
are doing and they want to be  
paid equally. Women always  
get paid less because they  
are women. The women are also  
asking for better conditions  
when they are pregnant and  
when they have children. They  
want to have nurseries so that  
they don't have to worry about  
their children while they are  
at work. They are also fight-  
ing for birth control and  
abortion information. Since  
the country is 80% Catholic  
this type of information has  
not been readily available to  
women in the past.  

We are trying to organize  
Salvadoran women here so that  
we can help the women there.  
Now more than ever, they need  
our support. We have to tell  
all these things about how wo-  
men in El Salvador live so  
that women in America will  
understand what we are fight-  
ing for. We want to call on  
all the women who work on  
all different levels here,  
in offices, in factories, to  
get together and do something  
for women over there.
