CONTINUING SURVIVAL....... wise Speak we see

YESTERDAY was a beginning that has begun every day since the first
thought occurred that I should see a psychiatrist. I'm not sure
of the complexity that processed the thought. Maybe having worked
in a mental ward, or having taken classes in psychology. Or maybe
it was having nowhere else to go. AND looking into the Yellow Pages
produced a number that answered. "Yes", I could have an appointment.
I THEN TOOK THE GIANT STEP AND FELL INTO HELL.

NOW hell is not burning. It is cold, uncomfortably chilled.

It is depressed, completely and thoroughly. Dried ice.

It is a chronic infectious disease, invading and contaminating.

It can be distant. Aloof,

It can be removed safely from all the wretched.

HESITANTLY my husband drove me to THE DOOR. Next the waiting room
and then a lifetime. He said he loved me and wanted the best for
me. TODAY he says I'M CRAZY. TOMORROW predicated LOCKED MADNESS.

"Who wants to be married to that?"

A MARRIAGE DISSOLVING. A DIVORCE.
A BEGINNING OF FREEDOM. MS.

AN ATTITUDE, PUBLIC DISGRACE.
POVERTY, WELFARE, THEN HUNGER.

INSULTS,

WELL-MEANING LAWYERS, MISGUIDED JUDGES, LEGAL INCOMPETENCY.
LOPSIDED JUSTICE.

“~—-A- BETRAYAL OF TRUST AND MORE BARS.

FORBEARANCE, ENDURANCE, AND THEN PERSEVERING

A WOMAN’S REFLECTIONS ON SEEING HER PAINTED
SISTERS HANGING ON A MUSEUM WALL!

women of a thousand years,
artist immortalized,

suspended in silence,
in a row, in a role.

Goya's stoic Spanish courtesan

Renoir's fleshy lovelies, in opera dress
Toulouse's poster prostitutes

Mona—what would she say if they let her speak

Objects of beauty,
objectified,
tear/thoughts
unseen,
unheard,
unheeded

Who is she?

that speechless media quieted by a man's brush
her hands tied
(a woman's hand is not made for the tools of trade)

Would they paint penises

if they had unbound hands that could hold brushes
or would they paint

the pain of a thousand years which their hands hold
so beautifully.

vehicle models
to tell a man's tale
posed in half truth
for half a soul

when will the men models sit silently
and the women paint the naked truth?

The mammoths are exterminated.

TO MAN

The sabre-toothed tigers are dead.
The buffaloes are gone.

There is no large, dangerous animal left
for you to attack.

The fierceness that you show to me
and every living thing is misplaced.
You are ridiculous.

Will you not see

that I am your counterpart?

If you will not learn gentleness,

if you will not be kind,

I cannot love you.

I will shun your touch.

You may control me through fear

for a time.

But secretly

I will wish for you to die.
