WOMEN HITCHHIKERS: Jo Freeman is  
thinking of doing a book on the ex-  
periences of women who have had exten-  
sive experience hitchhiking alone. But  
she knows few besides herself who have  
done so. If you've hitched at least  
several thousand miles by yourself she  
would appreciate if you would share  
your experiences. She's interested  
both in material for social analysis  
and ideas for concrete advice to other  
women contemplating single hitching.
