The furor created by The Body
Politic's "Men Loving Boys Loving
Men" posed hard political questions
for me. On the one hand, I deplore
repressive police action designed
not only to stifle any discussion
of the subject of sexual activity
across generations, but also to
intimidate anyone even so involved
with the paper as to be a sub-
scriber. On the other hand, I
understand the rage against sexual
exploitation by men not only of
children of both sexes but of women
and other men, the pleasures of
which The Body Politic can some-
times be accused of advertising. I
am convinced that censoring serious
discussion of unconventional sexual
relationships does nothing to protect
those who might be exploited. To
test, to contest, is the only way
to reach forward into understanding
areas of human experience vulgarized
by either taboo or glorification.

As a society we are so fearful
of sexual initiation we pretend
that by ignoring it, it will not
take place. What we really want is
not to know when or how it does.

We no longer frighten our children
with threats of insanity and death
as results of masturbation. It

is, instead, clumped with picking
one's nose, belching, farting—
something not to be done in public,
by implication not to be done by
nice people at all—but we give our
children enough privacy so that the
guilty pleasure can be discovered
and practiced not only alone but

in the company of other unsuper-
vised children. Children caught
may be shamed, the more sexually
aggressive children ostracized,

but it is not, as it used to be,

a cause for brutal retribution.

Our embarrassed liberality on this
matter does not extend to encounters
between children and adults. Though
anyone who spends any time with very
young children knows that they are
aggressively curious about bodies—
everyone's bodies—apt to stick a
finger not only in another's eye
or nose but to reach for a nipple
or penis, we pretend that these
assaults have nothing to do with
sex, are only part of the random and
"innocent" activity which can be
ignored or distracted. The adult
who actively participates in sexual
instruction of children—whether
the nurse who teaches a child mas-
turbation as a sedative or the adult
male who complies with a four-year-
old's demand, "Show me your penis"—
is simply criminal.

Sexual education in this culture,
when undertaken at all, is presented
impersonally in abstract diagrams,
unlike any other teaching of bodily
function or domestic habit. Once
the breast is unavailable for nour-
ishment and the lap outgrown, sex-
ual pleasure is presented as a far
off and nearly mystical reward for
years of asexual (or at least secret)
behavior. If defecating and eating
were left to the same secrecy and
chance we might face the same prob-
lems with basic sanitation and

nutrition that we do with sex. When

the relatively simple task of teach-
ing table manners takes so many
years, why do we assume that sexual
manners need not be taught at all?

on Teaching

Formal sexual initiations in other
cultures may serve as bad examples
of what we might teach if given
permission: the mutilation of
female genitals and the equating
of sexual satisfaction with the
kill in males. Both these puberty
rituals express attitudes toward
sexuality in our own culture, and
it is no wonder that we can there-
fore be alarmed at exposing children
to adult sexuality. If we viewed
sex as a basic appetite normally
satisfied and gradually cultivated,
we would not need to keep our child-
ren isolated and in ignorance for

so long, building in them what we
have ourselves experienced: in-
tense fear and desire which, so long
uninstructed, produce dangerous
stupidity. Of course we don't want
dangerously stupid adults initiat-
ing our children. Fear of that leaves
the children to themselves, not out
of our conviction that children are,
in this matter, the best teachers,
but by default. We have so little
trust in what we have to teach that
we label criminal any adult who
might attempt instruction.
There are adults who do sexually
exploit, damage and kill children.
It makes no more sense to deal with
the question by taking them as the
norm than it would be to take rapists
as the norm for heterosexual relation
ships between adults. To say that
any sexual activity between adults
and children is exploitive because of
the superior size and power of the
adult is really to acknowledge that,
overall, relationships between adults
and children are unequal. Why we
feel more concerned over children's
sexual dependence than over their

physical, emotional and intellectual
dependence says more about us as
sexual incompetents than as responsi-
ble adults.

Children are at our mercy. They
are at each other's mercy as well. It
makes about as much sense to leave
children's sexual nourishment to their
peers as it would to assume that the
mud pies they make for each other are
an adequate lunch. I use the term
"sexual" rather than "sensual" be-
cause it seems to me that both our
embarrassment about and focus on geni-
tals make us the inept sexual crea-
tures most of us are. A child's need
for physical contact is as sexual as
our own. It takes as little imagina-
tion to know that a child's sexual ap-
petite is different from an adult's
as it does to figure out that a new
born baby can't eat an apple or a
steak. We don't therefore refuse to
feed an infant.

If children's sexual independence
were as thoughtfully taught as their
ability to feed themselves, mastur-
bation would become the satisfying ac-
complishments that it should be. Be-
ing able to gratify oneself provides
an autonomy that is basic to self re-
spect and therefore respect for oth-
ers. Sexual play based on the under-
standing of pleasure can have associ-
ated with it as many small courtesies
as eating with other people, as much
ritual wonder as the most sacred of
games. Just as children gradually
learn greater autonomy and responsi-
bility in all other aspects of living
so their development in sexuality
should be gradual until they come to
the choices of commitment in relation-
ships, in parenting, not as sex-

starved barbarians willing to barter
anything for the experience so long
forbidden, not as infantile, glutton-
ous, guilty and dangerously stupid,
but as warm, sexually intelligent
human beings.

Until we have a responsible view
of our own sexuality, we will go on
shirking our responsibility to our
children. We live in so homophobic
a society that most adults are terri-
fied of expressing any affection with
children of their own sex, and even
discourage those friendships often
most meaningful among children.
Mothers can be jealous of, rather
than delighted in, their daughters'
sexuality, so ambivalent about them-
selves as women that they don't know
what sort of victimization to recom-
mend. Fathers compete with sons,
warning them off the lotus land of
sexual pleasure which will only de-
ter them from the conquest of what-
ever world has been chosen for them,
be it military service or medical
school. For every child traumatized
by overt and brutal sexual treatment
there are many, many more suffering
from the damage of ignorance and re-
pression which makes masochistic
women and sadistic men the norms of
our society.

The choice is not really between
child-rape and chastity into late
adolescence, nor is it between per-
version and orthodox heterosexuality.
We do have the further option of ac-
cepting our own sexuality and there-
fore that of our children as a com-
plex blessing which we and they must
learn neither to exploit nor deny
but to enjoy with sensitivity and
intelligence.

Such a change in attitudes
doesn't come quickly or easily. It
will not come at all unless we are
willing to address the question
seriously and openly. Police who
use violence and intimidation to
silence such discussion, who see in
every adult interested in the sexua-
lity of children a molester and
murderer, are themselves victims as
well as perpetuators of our sexual
sickness. If we discover through
reading "Men Loving Boys Loving Men"
that we question the motives of the
men involved, we must as certainly

question our own in allowing our
children to choose such experiments
while pretending not to. We must
also examine the motives of all in-
teraction between adults and chil-
dren—how much has ever been done
"for their own good", how much we
simply reinforce our own values—
before we are too purely suspicious
of anything but disinterested al-
truism in adults who relate to chil-
dren.

More important than judging the
quality of other people's experience
and relationships is the exercise of
our own memories. Certainly my own
initiation came along before I was
legally adult. Though a number of
males around my age offered to par-
ticipate, a woman ten years my se-
nior was "responsible", at my invi-
tation and encouragement. The only
fault I find with that part of my
sexual education was the limit her
guilt and fear put on our pleasure,
the heterosexual pressure even she
felt required to put on me. What
she did "for my own good" caused
both of us pain. If I were to im-
prove on that experience now, it
would not be to protect children
from adult seduction but to make a-
dults easier to seduce, less burden-
ed with fear or guilt, less defended
by hypocrisy.

If we accepted sexual behavior
between children and adults, we
would be far more able to protect
our children from abuse and exploi-
tation than we are now. They would
be free to tell us, as they can a-
bout all kinds of other experiences,
what is happening to them and to
have our sympathy and support in-
stead of our mute and mistrustful
terror. There are a thousand spe-
cific questions, all hard to answer,
but we can't begin dealing with
them until our basic attitude
changes.

Children are sexual, and it is up
to us to take responsibility for
their real education. They have
been exploited and betrayed long e-
nough by our silence.
