Snowfall  

No matter . . . she looks poetic  

like one who has just finished praying  

a private mother's song  
eyes downcast  

fast awakening some inner calm  

we enter for a time  
and dance to the tune  
of a Christmas rhyme  
on Earth with other  
Earth we know  
what you're  
worth  
re  
birth!

I called you  

I looked lonely  

Big Mama Rag Vol. 3, No. 6  

DOET  

because I became frightened  

& needed you to dance with me  
to press like flower petals the tiny bones of your back with my palms  

tonight  

I know you are sleeping with her  
& wonder if she could hold you as tightly against the hardness  

of still white stars  

as I  

who cannot be jealous  
but for the full moon & the long night  

I have to share  

Ellen Marie Bissert  

love was once wild  

love was once wild  
it was free  
it was cheap  
it ran like a brook in spring  
overflowing with  
the motion  
of melting snow  
and glimmering sunlight  
it was a product  
of mussed sheets  
an empty bottle of wine  
there were no limitations  
until someone said  
let me go with you  
I moved in and out  
of warm  
dark spaces  
I heard music  
of a most supernatural  
order  
day and night  
ran together as one  
and each new season  
colored love  
with its most  
gracious attire  
hours alone  
were hours  
being everyone  
feelings and thoughts  
were transmitted  
long distances  
a thought  
transformed itself  
into touch  
emotion grew to  
self-reflection  
and now as love  
takes on new  
terms  
new realizations  
nothing really changes  
just expands  
dimensions:  
as if that brook  
in spring  
ran into the ocean  
and now  
aching and longing  
for some peace  
of spirit  
some mellow  
togetherness  
turns me  
to reflect  
on love  
when it ran wild  
when it was free  
when it was cheap

Real Change  

Real change is some son of a  
bitch running a red light:  

or, all night I beat small warriors  
out of embroidered handkerchiefs,  

there still was no passion. It’s the  
colour we come here for, she told me,  

every year to watch their native dance.  
Flies examine all our sores, black-armed  

surgeons scraping straight stick hands  
together. Their eyes are every scary  

movie, huge and blind. Gnomes ship out  
in my blood, from heart round ways, bring  

stories’ half-lives, iceberg under  
saltwater, birthwater, death-water:  

we who love death cannot die,  
will hang in houses of self-love,  

the self-dance, inverse-native:  

aee aee-i,  
bury my heart where deer whisper  
small hooves across my eyes  

sang the Sioux  
if we saw nothing before, so we may  
finally see  

hi hi talyi-da-i  
these children are powerful  
fill our lives like continuous  
birth...  

The Eskimo: hurry, feed this child,  
the old one died this morning.

What You See Ain't What You Get (1974)  

I'm beginning to like  
this “cool” that you see —  
it hypnotizes &  
mesmerizes —  
you love it...  
It ain't me.  

— M. Trice  

Frustration  

Woman, tall and shining green eyes  
Just one touch, one kiss  

To show you how I care  

But too many eyes looking down,  

and fear is such a hard thing to handle  

Why can’t I just once, scream of love  
not only in private closed off rooms  
Frustration is a bitter return for  
love so deep inside.
