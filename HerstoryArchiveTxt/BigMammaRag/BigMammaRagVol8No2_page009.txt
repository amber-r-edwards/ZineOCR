New Trial Set For  
Sharon Crigler  

A second trial has been won for  
Sharon Crigler as a result of her  
April 17, 1979 appeal in Tacoma, WA.  
Sharon, a young black single mother,  
was charged with first degree man-  
slaughter for the self-defense shoot-  
ing of assailant Keith Rolland.  

— Sharon's story has an all too com-  
mon beginning. She was a battered  
woman. She had lived with Rolland  
several months during which time she  
suffered many beatings. Finally, after  
a severe battering she was able to make  
Rolland move out. Sharon instructed  
her apartment manager not to give  
Rolland a key nor allow him into the  
building under any circumstances.  

A week later, Rolland returned to  
Sharon's apartment to harass and  
threaten her. She called the police  
and notified them that he was armed.  
They arrived on the scene, arresting  
Rolland on a warrant for traffic vio-  
lations. The police also asked the  
apartment manager to not let Rolland  
into the building. Rolland was re-  
leased three hours later and returned  
promptly to Sharon's apartment with  
another man. Like many men who choose  
to disregard a woman's plea for help,  
the manager gave Rolland a master key.  

It is too often the case that women  
are forced to defend themselves be-  
cause of inadequate police protection.  
Sharon was denied such protection as  
are many women who are targets of  
"domestic violence.” The police, as  
well as the state, repeatedly defend  
the role of the male head of house-  
hold as the final authority, thus  
leaving women with no defenses and no  
where to go for help.  

Sharon was frightened by the day's  
events. She knew that Rolland was  
dangerous and that he would be enrag-  
ed because Sharon had called the cops  
on him. She feared for her own safety  
and that of her four-year-old son.  

When she heard the jingle of keys,  
Sharon began yelling through the door,  
"Who is it, is that you Keith?" There  
was no answer but more fumbling of  
keys as several ones were tried in  
the lock. She then got a gun and  
warned him, "Stand back, I have a gun.  
Stand back, I'm going to shoot."  
Intending only to scare Rolland, she  
fired the only bullet in the gun that  
struck Rolland, who was crouched down  
on the other side of the door.  

Sharon was given a court-appointed  
lawyer. On November 29, 1977 she was  
convicted by an all-white jury of  
first degree manslaughter with a  
deadly weapon. She was sentenced to  
the maximum penalty of ten years by  
Tacoma Judge James V. Ramsdell. He  
set bail at $5,000, and said that  
Crigler's "desire" to remain on wel-  
fare and her general attitude during  
the proceedings made it impossible to  
find any sympathy for her.  

After several months in Purdy Treat-  
ment Center for Women, she was releas-  
ed on bail. She then changed her  
lawyer to Mary Alice Theiler of  
Seattle, WA who assisted in the  
Yvonne Swan (Wanrow) case. Her know-  
ledge and reference to the Wanrow  
instructions during Sharon's appeal  
was significant in the decision to  
grant Sharon a new trial. The Washing-  
ton Court of Appeals decision to  
overturn Sharon's conviction was based  
on erroneous instruction that told  
the jury that “to justify a killing  
in self-defense, there must be some  
great bodily harm at or immediately  
before the killing.” This was impro-  
per, the Court of Appeals held, be-  
cause the dangers of harm for several  
months prior to the slaying must be  
also measured. There was also evidence  
to indicate that Sharon did not  
receive a fair trial. A racist state-  
ment made by one of the jurors was  

submitted to the Court. After the  
conviction, a juror was heard to say  
that he had just finished convicting  
some "nigger bitch" for killing her  
old man.

Bernadette Powell Is Convicted  

For Bernadette  
TO THE EDITOR:  

Bernadette Powell is going to prison.  
Black bandanna, finger gently pressed to  

lips  

to indicate she'll say no more,  
she marches down the jailhouse steps  
and doesn't weep, and says no more.  

Her guard is young and handsome, conscious  

The months of waiting,  
courtroom, jury, lawyers,  

the prosecutor with his own dark secrets,  

the publicity, the women and the men  
who rallied around her, raised money,  
wrote letters, articles, appeals  

while she sat hoping  

of the cameras and the coverage.  

What is he thinking?  

As Bernadette's supporters and friends  
reach to hug her for a final time,  
reach to kiss her with their tear-stained  

faces,  
what is he feeling,  

this man who holds the handcuff keys  
and will ride with her over two hundred  

miles  

to Westchester County, to prison?  

-Peg Averill/LNS-  

and her son grew older somewhere else.  

Bernadette Powell is going to prison  

in Bedford Hills, maximum security,  
fifteen years to life  
because she was beaten and was afraid,  

because she was beaten and finally said no,  
because her hand was on a gun  

again  

when it killed the man who had beaten her,  
when it killed the man who threatened her  

and threatened their son, her son.  

And the judge says there'll be no new trial,  
that battered wives should know enough  
to get away the first time.  

Bernadette is walking away now  

to live in prison and wait again,  
and still she does not speak.  

She knows we understand her silence,  
the dignity it conveys,  

the way it signals  

this is only another beginning.  

She is a woman and more than a woman:  
through her battle  

women everywhere are fighting  

and we will never concede defeat.

On Wednesday, January 16, 1980 Bernadette  
Powell was denied a new trial for the murder  
conviction in the slaying of her husband,  
in Ithaca, New York.  

County Court Judge Bruce G. Dean ruled,  
among other things, that the prosecution's  
questions of Bernadette about whether she  
enjoyed being beaten by her husband did not  
constitute prosecutorial misconduct. At most,  
Dean said, the use of the "alleged female  
myth was harmless error."  

Judge Dean, an alleged officer of justice  
for the state of New York, also alleged that  

other defenses “available to battered women  
are already provided under New York State  

Law."  

And Bernadette, what's in her mind?  
Her face calm, her eyes steady,  
she sadly smiles at the good-byes  

and turns to the waiting car.  

Does she think of the man they say she shot  
on purpose, the gun in her hand  

in that motel room  

while their little boy slept nearby?  
Or of the years she spent in fear  
of beatings, burnings, the man's hands  

full of fury and power  

aimed at her, the woman  

he'd married to care for,  
aimed at her, the woman  

who let her competence show,  
who kept forgiving, believed  

when he said he was so, so sorry, believed  

it couldn't happen again?  
She learned survival, learned  

to hide  

the bruises and the blood, learned shame  
for what her man would do to her,  
learned to watch him for the signs  

of the rage building again,  

learned to take the blows herself  
to protect their child, her child.  
And what's in Bernadette's mind?  

Poor women of color, like Sharon,  
find themselves in the worst position  
to receive just treatment. Lawyers  
fees are expensive and a vast majority  
of lawyers are white males.  

Through the pressure of a few con-  
cerned people, the state has agreed  
to appoint Mary Alice Theiler as  
Sharon's defense in the coming trial.  
This relieved a tremendous financial  
burden, but Sharon still needs  
support.  

The trial will be held March 31,  
1980 at Tacoma County City Building,  
Tacoma, WA. Your presence at her  
trial is critical. Numbers are impor-  
tant to demonstrate that Sharon is  
not alone.  

Donations are needed for the pre-  

parations of the upcoming trial. Send

Prejudice, hate, racism, sexism...  
how retarded, how ignorant and puni-  
tive. This “great" “superior” society  
claims to be so advanced but it has  
no more intelligence than a monkey.  

There was a time I used to think -  
there was something, many things wrong  
with me and because I was led to  
believe this I went through unneces-  
sary pain. I was a woman because I  
was good for nothing more. I was brown  
because I was dirty. I was a lesbian  
because I was unnatural. I believed  
these things and I lived them.  

Had I been all these things I would  
have never been able to see the light.  
I am not going to rehash the ignorant  
past but I will tell my present. I am  
brown like the color of mother earth  
and I vibrate with it, I am woman and  
I am strong, I am Rican and I am proud.  
I am a lesbian and I am warm. And if  
anyone can see anything wrong with  
these feelings then I pity them be-  
cause it only means that they have not  
yet begun to live, they haven't been  
able to see beyond themselves, they  
still live in a self-made prison and  
having the key, have not had the  
real understanding to set themselves  
free.  

When we are free, truly free, there  
is no color. Birthplace does not mat-  
ter, your sex is immaterial, we then  
are able to see each other as part of  
a whole.
