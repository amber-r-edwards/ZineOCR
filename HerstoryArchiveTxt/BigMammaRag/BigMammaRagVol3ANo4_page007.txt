LOCAL

Craftswomen Exhibit

The Artisans’ Center will be
showing the pottery of Nancy
Beckner and the jewelry of Beth
Daniel May 8 through June 4th.

Nancy Beckner works in both
stoneware and porcelain, but
her major interest is in creating
quiet functional pieces in
porcelain. She believes that
pottery should be accessible to
everyone; that pieces should be
as non-precious as the material
itself. Her showings include the
American Craftsmen Traveling
Exhibition and the Smithsonian
as well as many national and
regional shows.

Beth Daniel incorporates
representational images into her
pieces rather than fundamental
shapes. Each piece of jewelry
depicts and retains the quality of
her drawings. Beth has shown at
Rasputin Gallery and the
Colorado Designer Craftsmen
Show. She studied in Paris with
Francine Del Pierre and taught in
the Jefferson County school
system.

The opening reception will be
Thursday, May 8 from 7 - 9 p.m.

Women’s Studies Journal

Frontiers: A Journal of
Women Studies will begin
publication with the Summer
1975 issue. Edited and
published in association with
the University of Colorado
Women Studies Program,
Frontiers is soliciting a broad
range of work from community
and university people in an effort
to bridge the gap between
academic and ‘real world’
concerns.
We will publish scholarly
articles from any discipline
dealing with women, and essays
defining ‘real world’ problems
paired with academic analyses
by people working with similar
problems in their teaching and
academic research. We
particularly encourage
interdisciplinary work and
collaborative articles.

Frontiers will become a forum
for dialogue between women
about shared problems and
approaches viewed from
different perspectives. We
welcome informal articles and
short notes concerning personal
experiences and insights,
reviews of current research in
the field of women studies,
exceptional creative work, film
and book reviews and criticism.

Manuscripts and business
correspondence should be sent
to Frontiers, Women Studies
Program, Hillside Court 104,
University of Colorado, Boulder,
80302. Subscription rates are
$9 per volume (three issues) for
individuals and $15 per volume
for institutions. Single copies
are $3.25 each.

REGIONAL

Indian Sister Charges
U.S. Government with
Racism and Sexism

Ruby Cozad is the first Indian
sister to charge the federal
government with racism and
sexism in an all-out fight. She is
an Osage Indian woman, who,
against terrific odds, obtained an
M.A. degree in Public Health, yet
she works as a file clerk in the
Government Health Service.
She had applied for supervisory
positions and promotions in the
Indian Health Service several
times and each time a white
male was chosen for the job. She
maintains that white males have
complete or near complete
control of the service and are
often less qualified than the
women, and women, particularly
Indian women, are glossed over
and ignored. Therefore she is
filing a class action suit for
Indian women across this land to
prevent the U.S. Government
from filling employment
positions from their agencies on
a racist and sexist basis. Court
hearing begins in Oklahoma City
in early April.

Since Ruby Cozad has decided
to challenge the sexist and racist
practices of the H.E.W. (Health,
Education and Welfare Agency)
depriving many non-white
women of full employment, the
white males on her job who feel
threatened have started a
slander campaign against her.
She has been called an hysteric,
a nut and other
uncomplimentary names. She
has been threatened with
dismissal and reprisal. She is
being watched on the job and yet
her determination to fight for
justice has not been daunted.
Ruby Cozad is so tired of being
victimized that she says she will
fight on at all costs. She will
need the support of sisters.
Letters of support can be
addressed to her attorney: W.
Dave Pardue, 400 Investors
Capital Building, Oklahoma City,
OK.

Lesbian Mothers’
National Defense Fund

Lesbian Mothers needs
money to help our sisters who
are fighting legal battles locally
and nationally. We have had
many requests for financial help
and have been able to help, but
the need far exceeds our ability
to give. We want to let more
women know about what we are
trying to do. Hopefully they will
help us to help other women.

Woman Wins Suit
Against Rapist-Psychiatrist

In a precedent-setting
decision, a woman recently won
a malpractice suit against her
former psychiatrist who had
induced her to have sexual
intercourse with him as part of
her treatment. She was awarded
$350,000 in damages on March
19 after nine days of testimony.

The woman, Julie Roy, had
been engaged in psychotherapy
with Dr. Renatus Hartogs for a
period of 19 months, ending in
1970. She agreed to have sexual
relations with him after he had
convinced her that this would
help her to “relate better to
men” and would “erase her
guilty conscience” from a prev-
ious lesbian relationship.

A psychiatric consultant who
appeared on Roy's behalf
testified that as a result of her
experience as Hartogs’ patient,
Roy had to be hospitalized twice
in a mental institution in 1971.

While on the witness stand,
Hartogs attempted to discredit
Roy, describing her at different
times as “this lesbian,” “this
drunk," a “schizophrenic
paranoid type with catatonic
features" who “does not know
the difference between reality
and fantasy,” and “incurable.”
Hartogs further claimed that he
was unable to have sexual
intercourse in the period in
question due to a previous
injury.

However, the testimony of
another former patient, Corrine
Stern, did much to discredit
Hartogs’ testimony when she
revealed that she, too, had been
convinced to have intercourse
with the doctor over a period of
treatment lasting seven years,
from 1966 to 1972. Stern
instigated a malpractice suit
against Hartogs in 1973 which is
still pending.

Although Hartogs plans to
appeal the current decision, the
New York County Medical
Society's Board of Censors and
the State Education Department’s division of professional
conduct are planning a formal
investigation into Hartogs’
conduct which could result in
the revocation of his medical
license. Roy's suit was the first of its
kind in New York and one of the
few in the nation, setting a
precedent for women who have
experienced similar abuses from
their doctors.
