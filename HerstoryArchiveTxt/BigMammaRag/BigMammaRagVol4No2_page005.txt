Agribusinesses Manipulate Food Market  

Nicki Stoner  

We cannot buy reasonably  
priced nutritious food in this  
country. Not because farmers  
are getting rich or because of the  
Russian wheat deal, the drought  
in the Midwest, or because food  
cannot be grown without expen-  
sive fertilizers, hybrids,  
machinery and pesticides. The  
American consumer is being  
gouged by the 130 billion dollar  
a year food industry that is  
motivated by profit to sell junk  
foods at outrageous prices while  
paying the farmer little more for  
the product than fifty years ago.  

These large corporations are  
able to set prices practically at  
their own will for two reasons:  
they have all but eliminated  
competition, and they are so  
huge and have their fingers into  
so many pies that they are  
virtually immune to the forces of  
competition that supposedly  
control business in the capital-  
istic system.  

Feudalism  

Oligopolies (where only a few  
firms control the market) and  
monopolies control food produc-  
tion at every phase. The first  
phase of actual food production  
from the land is no longer  
controlled by the farm family.  
Seventy-five percent of all sales  
of agricultural products are  
made by the largest twenty  
percent of farms. Where large  
corporations have not actually  
taken over the land they have  
often transformed farm people  
into little more than hired hands,  
exploited hired hands.  

Farmers often have only one  
or a few outlets for their  
products. Six grain companies  
buy ninety percent of all the  
grain produced, and they may  
not all be represented in a given  
area. So the farmer, lacking the  
ability to shop around for a  
buyer, must take the price set by  
the giant grain corporations.  

An even more exploitative  
situation is the contractual  
agreements by which farmers  
sell their grain, fruit, vegetables  
and other products before they  
plow their fields in the spring.  
Even though these arrange-  
ments may provide the farmer  
with a hedge against the  
possibility of sudden price drops  
in the fall, they take away much  
of his control over managing his  
own farm. Corporations, such as  
Del Monte, tell a farmer what to  
grow, how much to grow and  
how to grow it, including, on  

occasion, minimum levels of  
pesticide residues.  

While the productivity of land  
has been increased enormously,  
the farmer has not benefitted.  
Farm families are losing or  
giving up their land to the extent  
that the independent farm family  
is a vanishing species. On the  
supply side they are squeezed by  
the high cost of machinery,  
fertilizer, seed and pesticides.  

What is Food?  

People in the food processing  
phase of the industry look upon  
the farmers’ products more and  
more as raw materials to be  
preserved, gassed, puffed,  
packaged, and processed into an  
ever expanding array of sub-  
stances that hardly resemble  
food any more.  

Wholesome natural foods are  
not profitable, at least not by the  
outrageous standards of the  
giant corporations. Why sell soy  
beans for fifty cents a pound  
when you can sell imitation  
bacon and sausage for prices  
competitive with pork instead of  
beans? These unwholesome and  
scandalously priced “foods” are  
force-fed to the consumer using  
prodigious amounts of adver-  
tising and other forms of  
propaganda.  

We are all bombarded by the  
propaganda, but the image of the  
modern American housewife,  
manufactured by the capital-  
istic system, is a consuming  
machine. We may try to fight it,  
but the ingrained sense of duty,  
learned in home economics  
classes and nightly hours in  
front of the boob-tube, gives us  
an overwhelming desire to  
provide our loved ones if not  
ourselves with the latest,  
newest, sensational taste treat  
of the century whatever it might  
be this week.  

Outlets  

The supermarkets with their  
surreal, amusement park at-  
mosphere are also, of course,  
controlled by oligopolies. While  
food prices went out of sight in  
1974, Safeway took their share.  
They increased their profits by  
fifty percent in the first three  
quarters of 1974 compared to  
the same time period of 1973.  

Like most of the other large  
corporations, Safeway is ver-  
tically integrated. It owns its own  
manufacturing and processing  
plants, produce packaging  
plants, bakeries, milk and ice  

cream plants, soft drink bottlers,  
meat processors, coffee roasting  
plants, soap, peanut butter and  
salad oil factory, tractor trailers  
and warehouses, not to mention  
a half interest in a chain of fried  
chicken restaurants. Vertical  
integration allows a corporation  
to control its own supplies.  
Horizontal integration,  
branching out into other in-  

dustries, further frees a corpora-  
tion from the controls of com-  
petition. Great Western United  
is a case in point. It is the parent  
conglomerate that owns Great  
Western Sugar, Shakey’s Pizza  
chain, new towns  

(Colorado City, California City,  
and one in New Mexico) and a  
ranch.  

In 1973 the parent con-  
glomerate was experiencing a  
crisis. California City was not  
prospering; Colorado City was  
suffering from a lack of water  
and resultant poor sales, and the  
Environmental Protection Agen-  
cy was pushing the sugar  
refineries to clean up their waste  
water. The parent company  
made a deal to sell Great  
Western Sugar to obtain some  
capital and then reneged when  
the price of sugar skyrocketed.  

Daniel Zwerdling, who  
reported this transaction in  
“The Food Monopolies” in The  

Progressive (issue of January  
1975) writes, “One can only  
speculate: did Great Western  
Sugar soak consumers to help  
pull its parent conglomerate out  
of desperate financial straits?”  

25% Food Price Drop  

L.T.T., Standard Oil, and  
Tenneco are some of the many  
international conglomerates in  
the food industry. A secret  
Federal Trade Commission  
report, according to Ralph  
Nader, shows that food prices  
would drop twenty-five percent  
if competition were reintroduced  
into the food industry.  

Furthermore, without their  
enormous advertising budgets  
and control over the government  
agencies that disseminate nutri-  
tion information, junk foods  
would no longer be so profitable.  

The outlook for change is not  
good. In fact it looks as though  
the conglomerates will complete  
their takeover of the food in-  
dustry. However, we can take  
some action. We can start by not  
buying junk food, which is not all  
that easy to do. In trying to  
avoid pesticides and artificially  
ripened tomatoes we may  
deliver ourselves to another  
group of rip-offs in the health  
food industry.  

It is my opinion, though, that  

Bare Tit: Poet Protests  

Woodwoman  

The Bare Tit coffeehouse, on  
17th Street, has been the scene  
of much angry activity during the  
past few months.  

Last October, a group of local  
women confronted the owners  
and demanded that they change  
the name of the coffeehouse  
(see November Big Mama). The  
owners declined to comply.  
Since then the women have  
resorted to leafletting. Clearly  
they were not the only ones  
offended, as the coffeehouse  
has also had its window smash-  
ed twice in protest.  

On Tuesday night, January  
20, Pat Wagner, a local feminist,  
read a poem at the coffeehouse.  
The poem was entitled ‘Why I  
Can No Longer Read At The Bare  
Tit’, and made clear that the  
name ‘The Bare Tit’ was offen-  
sive to her.  

When she had finished  
reading the poem, members of  
the audience, including men,  
began to talk about how they,  
too, were offended by the name.  
By the time she left the coffee-  
house patrons were involved in  
discussing the issue.  

One woman who is connected  
with the management has  
undertaken to have those who  
regularly patronize the  
establishment vote on whether  
or not to change the name.  

Rumor has it that women  
regulars are boycotting the Bare  
Tit until the name is changed.
