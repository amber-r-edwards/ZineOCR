Women In Peru from page 15

the French Revolution and she
was one of the first organi-
zers for women's emancipation.
They know that, and they know
of her as a feminist, and

that's where their use of
that term comes from. It's
also supported by Peru's
main leftist ideologue, José
Carlos Mariátegui, who died
in 1935 and who published
several essays supporting
feminism at that time. Be-
cause of that, although
Peruvian leftist men, and
men in general, ignore and
belittle and resist the fem-
inist movement as much as
they are able, they can't
use ideological weapons,
because Mariátegui is the
hero of everyone, of all the
Left. The women that I talked
with, though, didn't want
to give him credit for their
success. They really felt
that it was their own
success.

Kim: We're talking of suc-
cess. What do you think are
the biggest successes of the
women's movement in Peru?

Andrea: Well, I think one
is that they focus on con-
crete activities. If a woman
calls herself a feminist, she
has to be doing something
constantly, committing her-
self to that in a very ac-
tive way. Also, the women
tend to be very mature and
they bring a lot of political
experience with them into the
movement. There's hardly any

movement in the universities
yet. It's more a movement of
neighborhoods and of politi-
cal organizations and it has
a mature character somehow.

Kim: It's older women.

Andrea: Right. Almost all
of them have had children.
There's also been an eclip-
sing of the bourgeois femi-
nist movement, which just
barely began as a sort of
imitation of the North Amer-
ican movement in an earlier
period. There just isn't any
bourgeois feminist movement
in Peru at this point. It
has been totally replaced by
a specifically anti-capital-
ist, anti-imperialist, as
well as anti-patriarchal,
orientation. I think that
will be helpful to them, if
that continues to be the
case. And, too, the very
fact that the movement is
flourishing, in spite of the
communication problem in the
country, is an enormous suc-
cess. Most people don't have
telephones, and people don't
have books. There's only a-
bout two or three books that
have been published in Peru
about women so far, and yet
there is a flourishing of
little pamphlets, leaflets,
sometimes published on tiny
silkscreens that they have
in the villages.

Kim: Great!

Andrea: And they're doing

these, you know, in their
own words and they don't feel

Merle Woo Attacked from page 13

Williamson's attack on
lesbians and feminists is
very evident. He does re-
ally want the gay movement
to be a male movement. His
battle is certainly not our
battle, his allies are not
our allies. Again, white
men are telling women of
all colors, including white
women, that we have no
worth. We don't have to de-
fend Merle Woo, even if she
was not an acknowledged and
respected woman. She is a
woman with pride in herself,
her struggles and her race.

One of the letters we
got, from Janet Sutherland
to Midwest Times, expresses
our hopes for Williamson:
May your typesetters mis-
spell, your layouts warp,
your photos blur, your
circulation dwindle, your
ink smear and from us at

BMR, Jackie, your presses
break down, your paper curl
and your water gather scum.
We feel the last word is
your description.

they have to have the soph-
istication to write a book
or something before they can
have a movement.

Kim: That's wonderful. It

makes me wonder what would
have happened had we been

able to halt Ms and the co-
optation of our movement.

Andrea: The Peruvian gov-
ernment simply can't afford
to coopt this movement.

Kim: How do you mean, they
can't afford to?

Andrea: I mean, they don't
have the money, they're hav-
ing cutbacks in everything.
They just can't.

Kim: Well, they could al-
ways apply to the CIA: We
need to coopt this movement.

Andrea: They even did that
in an earlier stage, they
weren't able to continue.

Kim: What are some other
successes?

Andrea: Well, I think that
one of the main successes
that is just beginning to be
visible is the coming to-
gether of this vast base of
women who have been doing
political organizing in their
neighborhood, and who really
are working class women, if
not working women in terms
of salaries. They will give
a whole new character to
feminism, from which all of
us and the rest of the world
will be able to learn and
benefit. They understand the
need for power and they have
some kind of idea how to go

about getting it.

Kim: What can North American
feminists learn from the
women's movement in Peru?

Andrea: Well, I think for
one thing, we have a problem
of racism, and thinking that
the women's movement is sort
of our movement. A lot of
white women feel that way.
And sometimes that's rein-
forced by women who are ex-
periencing a certain amount
of resistance with national
movements here, and who have
trouble making a commitment
to feminism. I think that
the fact that there is a
flourishing women's movement
in a country like Peru can
help to break down, on both
sides, those kinds of suppos-
itions. Because these women
are closer to making an over-
all revolutionary change in
society, together with other
movements, there is a real
chance that a feminist move-
ment can become part of an
overall revolutionary move-
ment, in a strong way. They
will be able to actually
accomplish some of the goals
that are still a long way

off for us. They'll become a
kind of vanguard.

Kim: So we'll be looking
at them in the years ahead.

Andrea: And that will help
to bring us together, in new
ways, within our own borders,
women that are colonized and
white women.

come together to counter
these attempts, but that we
also had to organize to
struggle for our rights,
and to make the connection
between the struggle for
our rights as women and the
struggle for national lib-
eration.

Our organization is a na-
tional organization in the
sense that it has an impact
all over the country, but
it is not organized all

over the country; it is
organized primarily in Kin-
gston. Over the past four
years it has grown from a
core of just under 30 women
to about 60 or 70. These
are women who are able to
meet regularly every two
weeks. In between those
meetings there are subcom-
mittee meetings that plan
and organize our work on
the streets and in the com-
munities.

has been the doling out of
a theory and ideology that
has yet again SPECIFICALLY
excluded us black women. Our
bonding together as black
women and our collective
striving will be the basis
for the creation of
a theory for black women's
liberation.

The exposure and destroy-
al of the false dichotomy
between racism and sexism,
and racism and classism,

is the holistic and real-
istic launching point of black
feminism. The dynamics of
racism and sexism, and
racism and capitalism,
have thrust us into an al-
liance of solidarity with
black men. This alliance
does not preclude black fe-
minism. In my experience it
has been black men who have
been actively expelled for
the pejorative acts of sex-
ism and racism.

We have consistently for-
warded ideas and proposals
and blasted out action in
return for some token shows
of support and some valiant
initiations of change. Our
tasks as black feminists
are clear. I do not see al-
liances with white feminists
who remain racist and bore
me with their inability to
see their relation to capi-
talism and confront their
classism.
