Psychology of Women:  
A Study of Bio-Cultural  
Conflicts. .  

Judith M. Bardwick.  
Harper & Row, New  
York, NY: 1971.  

In Psychology of Women,  
Judith M. Bardwick, Ph.D.,  
has confirmed and acknowledged the experiences that  
Every Woman has had. No  
longer need we worry about  
“penis envy”: we have our  
own reproductive organs and  
our own perceptions and our  
own reasons for feeling and  
acting as we do, in spite of the  
male sex.  

Bardwick herself has a  
Ph.D. and three children. She  
thinks that maternity and  
taking care of the young are  
crucial experiences for the  
self-identity of women. She  
claims that little girls don’t  
grieve for the penises they never  
had. As anyone who has been  

around little children will  
attest: a little girl who sees a  
pregnant woman is very proud  
to hear that she too might one  
day have a big belly and a  
baby (if she wants to). In other  
words, girls have their own  
source of pride and identity,  
right there in their own  
bodies.  

The notorious “passivity” of  
women just might happen to  
be functional, a necessary  
coping technique during such  
crises as pregnancy. (A  
woman who answers the  
demands of small children  
can hardly be called passive!)  

Bardwick discusses at  
length the relationship of  
women to their bodies. As it  
turns out, our bodies are  
fascinating. The menstrual  
cycle is a finely orchestrated  
balance of hormones, some-  
times operating in high gear  
and sometimes in low gear.  
When our hormonal levels are  
high, there is some indication  
in the research that it might  

contribute to a positive,  
nurturant psychological state.  
Pregnancy is one time of high  
hormonal levels -- and preg-  
nancy is certainly a time when  
a positive, well-integrated  
personality is very important  
to the well-being of the future  
child.  

Bardwick also talks about  
possible causes of heightened  
sexual arousal during mens-  
truation. She also suggests  
some possible psychological  
effects of taking birth control  
pills.  

Bardwick also describes the  
cultural influences on young  
women experiencing mens-  
truation, their first inter-  
course, marriage, orgasm,  
childbirth, etc. Some of her  
theories are as yet unprova-  
ble, but it is nevertheless  
worthwhile to read a feminine  
rendition of all the life crises  
that men are so vocal about.  

Again and again the author  
describes the denigration of  
female achievements in a  

culture which values male-  
ness. This is the part that  
roused the old feminist anger  
in me. While girls are being  
told to succeed scholastically,  
on the one hand, and then  
told not to do too well, on the  
other hand (so that they don't  
alienate prospective hus-  
bands); while they're being  
told that having babies and  
taking care of a home and  
husband are the most crea-  
tive, most contributory things  
they could do; they are  
simultaneously being put  
down for being “just house-  
wives”. As Bardwick notes in  
her chapter entitled “The  
Motive to Achieve”, the  
highest accolades of this  
society go to men who are  
competitive and achievement-  
oriented. If women exhibit the  
same behaviors, they’re told  
that they’re being “unfemin-  
ine”. Damned if you do and  
damned if you don't.  
Bardwick’s theory of an  
“affiliative motive” in women

probably is the most contro-  
versial part of the book (or at  
least to a lot of women today  
who are trying to explore their  
achievement needs). She says  
that, given all the conditioning  
that we've had, and possibly  
also due to genetic givens, a  
young girl has a need to  
establish a relatedness to a  
man and to her children. She  
will supposedly feel anxious if  
she fails to fulfill the traditional  
female role for a while.  

At any rate, whatever your  
sex or your persuasion, I think  
that this book would be a  
pleasure to read--if only  
because an intelligent woman  
has devoted a lot of serious  
thinking and a lot of research  
to the biological and cultural  
realities of womanhood today.  

Magazines  
Womansports  

Elisa Laramore  
Athletics and sports are  

rapidly arising into their  
rightful positions in women’s  
daily lives. With this new  
awareness women are feeling  
health, strength, and a new  
purpose.  

It seems only natural that  
this fresh power should be  
shared with one another. One  
method of sharing ideas and  
experiences is through the  
media.  

Just recently introduced  
into the vast spectrum of  
journalistic media is Billie  
Jean King’s publication wo-  
men Sports. Born out of anger  
about almost non-existent  
media coverage of women’s  
sporting events, women-  
Sports is definitely a sight for  

Amazon Quarterly  

Sandy Belgrade  

This critique started out to  
be a magazine review, but  
something more than an  
issue-by-issue analysis  
seems needed. To dismiss  
Amazon Quarterly as just one  
more printed contribution is  
to miss the point for the  
magazine and for ourselves.  
What I really want to discuss  
are the promises and vision of  
a women’s culture and the  
way Amazon Quarterly fits  
into that perspective.  

In its short herstory, the  
Women’s Movement has  
reached a point of promise,  
one that reads: we are no  
longer concerned with re-  
formist issues, nor with one  
more periodical which just  
reports and records and does  
so in a timely way. We are, I  
believe, at the point which can  
be interpreted as follows:  
enough rhetoric. Enough con-  
fessions and personal odys-  
seys. While these fulfill me on  
one level in that they let me  

very sore eyes.  
The text is fascinating to  

me and I find myself drinking  

Indeed this magazine is long  
overdue. The regular features  
include “Kickers” - a potpourri  
of breakthroughs and unusual  
happenings; “In a Pig's Eye” -  
delightful satire; “Aces” -  
write-up on women who win it  
all; “Foremothers” - a new  
look at herstory; “Off the  
Wall” - funny stuff, but sad,  
and “Snapshot” - seeing is  
believing.  

The articles themselves are  
the real fruit and vegetables of  
this magazine. I delight in  
seeing everyone from the  
superstars to the novice  
athlete -- real people just like  
you and I. The women  
describe in detail their experi-  
ences which are deep and  
sensual. Informative articles  

know others feel as I do (i.e.  
have taken the shit as long as  
I have), they do not fill a much  
larger need. A need which  
recognizes our disaffection  
with the realities, our desire  
for theory and more concrete  
suggestions for positive ac-  
tion.  

What this quarterly promis-  
es is that it can incorporate all  
forms of writing and stimulate  
women to action through its  
sense of vision. This is a  
moment in time when power  
and vision are yearning to be  
reconciled, and it is in light  
of vision with the promise of  
action that this commentary  
on AQ is offered.  

Started by Gina and Laurel  

This quarterly, which will be  
two years old in October, was  
begun on the West Coast by  
two Lesbian Feminists, Gina  
and Laurel. Unlike that slick  
New York operation which  
claims to speak for MS, AQ  
does not speak for women on  
a “radical chic” level, nor do  
they see themselves as merely  
an art journal. In their first  
anniversary issue, Gina stated  

on ‘How to’ just about  
anything are plentiful.  

The Agony of Victory” written  
by a middle-aged marathon  
runner who finished last - but  
she finished. The very fact  
that this article was published  
shows some real understand-  
ing of what it’s like to be a  
woman athlete -- win or lose.  

I'm impressed with the  
women in these articles, I had  
no idea women were compet-  
ing in so many fields and so  
well. Inspired is putting it  
lightly.  

I must be honest however  
and point out what I feel to be  
some real drawbacks. First  
and foremost Billie’s shallow  
Feminism. Allowing such  
inane articles as “Why Women  
Lose” by Dr. Thomas Bos-  

that she wanted to see the  
paper evolve from being some  
static entity. That unlike  
society which as a whole  
emphasizes nouns and there-  
fore fixed identities, they  
wanted AQ to verb, to  
participate actively in the  
creation of a woman-  
centered culture. There are  
millions of women hungry for  
provocative articles which will  
force them to rethink lan-  
guage and give them the kind  
of insights that can result in  
definitive action. A look at one  
recent theoretical essay may  
illustrate how the best in  
writing can be words that are  
accurate maps of the world  
and our role therein to bring  
about true social change.  

In Vol. 2, Issue 2, Laurel  
powerfully dissects the male  
mirror, her symbol for the  
complete and pervasive way  
that the patriarchy emits and  
reflects its own image and  
values in the world. Patriarch-  
al influence is so widespread  
that even total separatism  
does not wipe out its  
corrosive effects. While many  

issue “The Thrill of Defeat,  

looper and Marcia Hays (July  
1974) is evidence on that  

hardly a tribute to the goals of  
the Feminist movement at  
large. I personally would like  
to see womenSports become  
more radical in that respect.  
Image building--a nice middle  
class publication that poses  
little threat to the male-dom-  
inated press is one irritation  
for me. However I suppose  
they must keep their adver-  
tisers happy. Possibly that’s  
why they ignore the blatant  
fact that many of our lovely  
heroines are Lesbians. Preen-  
ing and primping still lives as  
they purposely emphasize the  
beauty queen aspects of some  
of the superstars like horse  
racing's Mary Bacon, Miss  
San Bernardino of San Diego  
basketball fame, and lovely  

women writers have written in  
response to the negative,  
existential rays coming from  
that mirror, trying to form  
their own values in its  
reflection as it were, too few  
have surfaced to transcend it.  
The smashing of that mirror  
and the corresponding creation  
of a mirror that reflects  
the feminine principle is the  
beginning of woman vision--  
one that is in touch with the  
needs of the earth, one that  
speaks to the female process  
ethic.  

Communication Lifeline  

This is communication  
looked at as a lifeline and a  
network to establish a vision  
in which we can all partici-  
pate. It speaks to us from the  
depths of our hope, and it can  
be our source of strength if  
words really can be tangential  
to action. What AQ intends is  
no less than the complete  
demise of the phallocentric  
system that purged our  
herstory before and will again  
unless we act this time  
around.

It isn’t easy to tolerate  
mim m nal t  

unless she’s queer?” (Mary  
Bacon July 1974 pp. 33). Or  
negative inferences that gym  
teachers and/or athletic wo-  
men are gay, Billie Jean and  
company are bending over  
backwards to deny what every  
one knows. Even Newsweek  
will casually admit “There are  
a number of Lesbians among  
touring pro athletes...”  
(Newsweek, June 3, 1974, pp.  
52) womenSports seems to be  
suffering from a bad case of  
Closetitis.  

Harsh words aside - wo-  
menSports is informative, fun  
and necessary. I wish them all  
the success and good fortune  
they deserve and I hope to see  
many more issues.  

Amazon Quarterly holds the  
promise of being a forum for  
women to communicate what  
the feminine mirror can be and  
how each of us can contri-  
bute. It is true that several  
topics I would like discussed  
have not yet been dealt with  
(for example, I would like an  
in-depth essay on how the  
divisive aspects can be  
dispelled, especially those of  
class and race since for too  
many women the movement  
has a middle class aura).  
However, as Amazon Quarter-  
ly begins its third year we  
might heed their call for more  
contributions from women: to  
read it, to share it, to  
transform it is no less than a  
call to active participation in  
our lives and the end of being  
mute witnesses and readers.
