Genital Mutilation

African, Middle Eastern, or Muslim.  
Some South and Central American  
tribes—though this is rare—in Bra-  
zil, Peru, and Mexico also practice  
a form of excision, as do certain  
ethnic groups in Malaysia and Paki-  
stan and the Australian aborigines.  
On the whole, however, the majority  
of Muslims all over the world do  
not practice, and have never prac-  
ticed, ritual sexual mutilation of  
women.  

Marie Assad, assistant lecturer  
at Cairo's American University, told  
the delegates: "It's impossible to  
say whether it is an old African  
puberty rite which has spread into  
Egypt or whether it is a holdover  
from Pharaonic times."  

It has often been argued that the  
mummies found in tombs were excised  
and infibulated. But the truth is,  
their physical state does not per-  
mit making such a claim. Nonetheless  
there is no doubt that these prac-  
tices were very widely rooted in the  
Upper Nile Valley from the days of  
the Pharaohs. A Greek papyrus going  
back to 163 BC mentions it clearly,  
as does the Greek geographer Strabo.  
Neither Christianity nor Islam man-  
aged to change the practices. They  
were either ignored, as happened  
among the Egyptians and Ethiopian  
Copts, or became buttressed with rel-  
igious notions which did not conform  
to the texts, as was the case with  
Islam.  

The Koran contains not the least  
reference to either excision or in-  
fibulation. There is only a tra-  
dition (hadith) which says that the  
prophet one day told Um Attiya, a  
matron who was excising a young  
girl: "Reduce, but don't destroy."  
This permits Cairo's influential  
Islamic authorities today to encour-  
age the so-called "Sunna" form of  
female circumcision, which does not  
damage the woman and which is legal  
to this day in Egypt and Sudan.  

But many animist populations prac-  
tice excision and infibulation well  
outside Islam's influence. What ex-  
planations do the countries con-  
cerned give?  

The first reason, it would seem,  
would have to be sought in an ob-

the industry itself; small craft  
unions competitive amongst themselves.  
The relatively weak unions that re-  
sult are less capable of, or willing  
to wage major struggles for pay and  
working conditions.  

The workers, however, are not help-  
less in the face of this situation.  
One example of increasing awareness  
of health problems and activity to-  
wards improving conditions is a  
Toronto-based ad hoc committee. Their  
concern with health conditions in  
the garment industry has resulted in  
meetings with workers and a garment  
workers’ health and safety newsletter.  
The committee has drawn people from  
different trade unions, though it  
operates without formal union support.  

It is clear that much must be done  
to improve working conditions in the  
garment industry. It will be a dif-  
ficult struggle for the right to an  
industry that is free from dehuman-  
izing work practices and an unhealthy  
and unsafe work environment.

against midwives to send that infor-  
mation, or requests for assistance, to  
them at: Midwifery Support Network,  

PO Box 192, West Sommerville, MA  
02144.)  

By 2000, most pregnant women will  
probably not participate in child-  
bearing. The physician will “give  
birth" with his machines and knives.  
Thousands of renegade mothers, refus-  
ing to enter hospitals, will deliver  
their children at home, attended by  
midwives.  

Obstetricians will wage battle a-  
gainst the midwives. They will hold  
fast to a tenet in the faith of Medi-  
cine: every new technique represents  
progress. Doctors will continue to  
say that the operations they devise  
and the machines they invent (and  
sometimes hold patents on) perform  
socially laudable functions like sav-  
ing lives.  

Doctors will remain the same, but  
whether they will continue to enjoy  
the power they now hold depends in  

session with female virginity and  
chastity. Though excision is not  
mentioned in the Koran, Marie Assad  
says: "Chastity before marriage and  
virginity are clearly mentioned. A  
hymen ruptured before marriage is  
such a serious business—both among  
progressive Egyptians and among  
others—that it may lead some rural  
families to kill their own daugh-  
ters."  

Among the tribal people in Somalia  
and in the Arabian peninsula, infib-  
ulation was supposedly at first  
meant to protect young girl herders  
working alone in the desert from  
attempts to rape them. Yet, more  
intensive research uncovers another  
objective. It was to shield them  
from their own desires—for as one  
victim of the practice herself ad-  
mitted, "women have a hypersexual  
nature."  

The clitoris, as it was said at  
the Khartoum congress, is only the  
organ of sterile, even "shameful,"  
pleasure. "Bush bitches" is the  
name the Bororos give women who have  
not been excised. And there is no  
greater insult in Sudan, Djibouti,  
and Somalia than to be called “non-  
excised."  

Brought up in this atmosphere,  
young girls understandably ask to be  
excised, convinced that they would  
be "unmarriageable" if they remained  
intact. For men are supposed to ob-  
tain more pleasure having relations  
with excised or infibulated women.  
The last point is flatly disproved  
by Professor Shandall's investiga-  
tions among the husbands (all poly-  
gamous) of variously mutilated wo-  
men. Nearly all of them said they  
would prefer non-excised women.  

Some even admitted taking a second  
wife because of the first wife's  
sexual coldness.  

It is obvious that none of the  
explanations holds water. And yet  
all the governments of the count-  
ries concerned have certainly not  
made official statements lauding  
excision as Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya  
had done ("No Kikuyu worthy of the  
name wants to marry an uncircumcised  
girl, for this operation is indis-  
pensable for receiving complete

There will be a community meeting

more about why feminists are in this  
movement, about the workshops,  
effects of radiation, the “mnc” and  
their plans that will affect all our  
lives, come and ask questions.

part on how the populace regards  
them. That, in turn, depends on the  
information people receive about med-  
icine.  

Will reporters who provide that in-  
formation change in the next two de-  
cades and begin to demand evidence  
that these machines actually do what  
physicians say they do? Will they in-  
sist on examining reports of controlled  
studies that demonstrate a tech-  

nique's efficiency and safety, and if  

no studies exist will they report  
that fact? Or will they continue to  
write articles uncritically, glorify-  
ing technology and the miracles of  
modern medicine?  

If so, the media will help doctors  
medicalize birth and shape the think-  
ing of the populace.  

And when Susan Rogers's neighbors  
hear that police forcibly took her to  
a hospital to have her baby delivered  
by knife, they will think it quite  
right.

moral and religious education."  
But they have by no means taken, or  
attempted to take, the vigorous  
measures many Africans demand today  
against such practices.  

Up to now, the most determined  
have been the governments of Sudan,  
Egypt, and Somalia, where laws pro-  
hibit such mutilations. Yet pro-  
hibitions of this sort have largely  
proved to be useless. Excisions  
and infibulations continue to be  
widespread in all three countries,  
except in a few small urban areas.  

This led a good many delegates to  
recommend, not legal measures, but  
the organization of educational  
drives using the services of the  
traditional “village matrons," of  
teachers, and the radio. Others  
held that in any case it called for  
a strong condemnation as a matter of  
principle. The resolutions adopted  
in the end represented a compromise  
between the two positions.  

They called for:  

—The adoption of clearly defined  
national policies for the abolition  
of excision and infibulation.  

—The establishment of national  
and international committees to co-  
ordinate these policies.  

—General education of the public  
especially of traditional midwives.  
Certainly too little, but mark-  

ing a major change in the UN's  
traditional head-in-the-sand atti-  
tude where these practices are con-  

cerned. In 1959, answering a re-  
quest from a UN body to undertake  
a study of the subject, the 12th  
WHO assembly replied “that the  
ritual operations in question are  
the result of social and cultural  
conceptions whose study is not  
within the WHO competence."  

It is because of these very "soc-  
ial and cultural conceptions" that  
the discussion of sexual mutilation  
had long been blocked: in the West  
by a badly understood sense of  
guilt or through open contempt; and  
in the countries concerned, through  
a culturally defensive reaction  
that many Africans condemn today.  

Hopefully, the Khartoum initia-  
tive will help to change the reality  
reflected in the statement by an  
Eritrean guerrilla fighter and mid-  
wife: "Being born a woman in the  
Third World is additional bad luck."

Open Letter From Disabled Lesbians

and producers recognize the need for  
signers and provide them, the word  
spreads through the deaf lesbian  
community and more deaf lesbians  
attend. This has been apparent in  
recent concerts. We must never, ne-  

ver exclude any lesbian from our les-  

bian community. Disabled people are  
so often shut out of the rest of the  
world, that it is like being stabbed  
with a knife when our lesbian sis-  
ters do not understand our oppres-  
sion and perpetuate it.  

We feel it is imperative for able-  
bodied lesbians to form conscious-  
ness raising groups around their  
feelings about disabled lesbians.  

We want people to think about how  
important lesbian events are to them  
and what it might feel like to be  
shut out from Lesbian culture. We  
believe that our first priority as  
lesbians must be including each  
other and making sure none of us are  
ever left out ever again.  

The Disabled Lesbian Alliance is  
open to all lesbians, disabled and  
able-bodied. We focus on issues  
relevant to lesbians with physical,  
sensory, and hidden disabilities  
(heart, arthritis, epilepsy, etc.).  
We can be reached at Rm. 229, 5 Uni-  
versity Place, N.Y.C. 10003—Phone  
Number: (212) 475-0908. Call for  
meeting times and information on  
accessibility for every event. We  
will also provide speakers for any  
interested organization or group.  

There is a word for every type of  
oppression—heterosexism, sexism,  
racism, anti-semitism, classism,  
ageism, etc.—but there is still no  
word for the oppression of the disa-  
bled.

STATEMENT READ AT LESBIAN PRIDE  
CONCERT by Ramona M. Galindez  
Now I am telling you that I am a  

deaf lesbian. Recently I went to a  
concert at NYU, Meg Christian.  
Really, it was great and I enjoyed  
it because there was an interpreter  
there. I understood very clearly  
and felt enjoyment. But now I am  
disappointed because an interpreter  
is not here during Lesbian Pride  
Week. How can I understand and en-  
joy Lesbian Pride Week without an  
interpreter? I really want to encour-  
age all of you to offer interpreters  
for lesbian events.  

Really I would love to join the les-  
bian community and I need hearing peo-  
ple to do it! I don't want able-bo-  
died, hearing, and sighted people to  
be afraid of disabled people. Some-  
times able-bodied, hearing, and  
sighted people look at the disabled  
people like we are creeps! That  
hurts our feelings and makes us feel  

left out. Where can the disabled  
go to feel welcome? We need your su-  
pport!!
