Indian Women Sterilizations  
Seen as Genocide

Rewritten by Caroli Hille

Claremore, Oklahoma —  
Investigations have been

made concerning numerous

sterilizations of young native

women in the U.S. operated In- -

dian Health Service hospital.  
Native nurses and staff at the  
hospital have complained of  
these practices through IHS  
channels without result since  
last June. Nevertheless, IHS  
area director, John Davis, issued  
a directive to employees to  
refrain from speaking to the  
press and to use IHS channels  
for all complaints under penalty  
of dismissal.

Dr. Richard W. Stander, who  
has conducted studies on preg-  
nant poverty-status women in  
Indiana and Ohio under USPHS  
grants in the past, investigated  
for the Department of Health  
Education and Welfare the  
charges made at Claremore. He  
stated that the rate of  
sterilizations was not unusual,  
and that he found no support for  
allegations of genocide. “All  
sterilization procedures are per-  
formed only after extensive  
counseling by medical and social  
service personnel,” he said.

Legitimate Birth Control

Emery A. Johnson, Director of  
the Indian Health Service, told  
questioning congressmen that  
“IHS considered non-  
therapeutic sterilization a  
legitimate method of family  
planning. We would be concern-  
ed only if these procedures were  
performed under coercion, or if  
there was evidence that the  
operations were carried out  
without informed consent. We  
are not aware of any instance in  
which such services have been  
abused.” However, a report of  
the Senate subcommittee said  
that the hospital's sterilization  
program does not ‘set forth as  
clearly as possible that the  
procedures are irreversible.”

Information contrary to that  
given by IHS and HEW officials  
came from Dr. Connie Uri, Los  
Angeles physician and a native  
woman. She said that during the  
fiscal year 1973, 132 native  
women were sterilized, 100 of  
them for non-therapeutic  
reasons. “From the IHS records,  
19% of Indian women are of  
child-bearing age, or 45,000  

women. Claremore was still and  
is sterilizing one woman for  
every seven births that occur in  
the hospital. This is genocide to  
Indian people.”

Dr. Uri said further that the  
consent forms are written in  
grade 12 English and may not be  
understood by many of the  
women signing them. “Zero  
population growth may be all  
right for the white man, because  
he’s crowding this continent, but  
for the Indian, it’s genocidal.  
Let's control our own reproduc-  
tion, instead of meeting the  
demands of the white economic-  
social values.”

International Women’s Year

Mob Violence Breaks Up  
Women’s Year Demonstration

from combined reports from  
Majority Report correspondents from Paris and  
Lisbon

The following account is from  
a translation from Liberation, a  
Parisian daily, which appeared  
on February 4th — a full three  
weeks after the demonstration.  
A small Norwegian radical  
paper covered the event. How  
the news of this exceptional  
confrontation was bypassed by  
most of the major European and  
American newspapers is a scan-  
dal in itself.

At six p.m. on January 13, the  
Portuguese Women’s Liberation  
Movement marked the begin-  
ning of the International  
Women's Year with a well-  
planned and publicized  
demonstration in Lisbon. Plans  
centered around burning the  

symbols of female oppression:  
civil codes, pornography where  
women’s bodies were objects,  
brooms and cleaning rags, and  
baby clothes — symbolic of the  
myth of maternity.

The children of some of the  
feminists decided to burn toys  
because they determine from in-  
fancy society roles — guns and  
cars for boys, dolls for girls.

At six in the evening, 15  
feminists arrived at Edward Vil  
Park dressed as “vamps,”  
brides, pregnant women, and  
maids. Several days earlier, the  
press announced this part of the  
demonstration as if it were to be  
a “strip-tease.” To the great sur-  
prise of the women, thousands  
of people were waiting for them.  
For approximately three minutes  
nothing happened. The crowd  
opened up to let the  
demonstrators pass. But the mo-  
ment the women lit the fires, the  
crowd closed in. It was impossi-

Attacking the belief that a poor  
woman with several children is  
“better off” sterilized, Dr. Uri  
said, “She’s still going to be  
poor. She just won't be able to  
have more children.”

Puerto Rican Women

A recent survey by Vasquez  
Carsada at the University of  
Puerto Rico indicates that while  
in 1947 only 7% of the women of  
the island were sterilized, now  
only one-third of Puerto Rican  
women of child-bearing age will  
be able to have children again.  
The Puerto Rican government is  

considering development of a  
still wider network of steriliza-  
tion centers, preferring to limit  
population, rather than  
America-backed industrializa-  
tion on the space-limited island.

Dr. Helen Rodriguez, who  
trained and practiced medicine  
in Puerto Rico, tells how native  
women may be induced to  
accept sterilization by their  

“own consent.”  
Poor Women Victims

“By and large, it's the women  
with the least education who get  
sterilized,” she said. “Most of  
the women have had some  
failure in contraceptive use and  
do not have access to contracep-  
tives on an equal level with  
women who are not sterilized.”  
She charges that the Puerto  
Rican government is unhappy  
about a Supreme Court decision  
legalizing abortion, since fewer  
women will now resort to  
sterilization.

Dr. Rodriguez said that other,  
temporary, methods of birth con-  
trol are not fairly presented as  
alternatives to sterilization, and  
that many women are led to  
believe that the operation can be  
reversed, which it cannot.

“The pill,” widely used ex-  
perimentally in Puerto Rico in  
1952-60, with estrogen levels  
now considered unsafe, is now  
safe, and so expensive that most  
Puerto Rican women cannot buy  
it.

A study by the Public Citizen's  
Health Research Group reported  
that often physicians get women  
to sign consent forms while in  
labor. “In fact, medical staff  
pressures are often brought to  

bear upon the intern who balks  
at such procedures,” the report  
said.

Other studies indicate that the  

three factors contributing most  
to later regret over sterilization  
are 1. the women being very  
young (at Claremore, in their  
teens and twenties) 2. having  
decided under duress, and 3.  
sterilization suggested by the  
physician rather than the  
patient. As many as one in four  
women did not realize that  
sterilization is irreversible, and  
would have preferred to use  
other contraception.  
The research group also  
reported that complete hysterec-  
tomies are done rather than  
tubal ligations as part of the  
training of surgeons. Young sur-  
geons are encouraged to sell and  
perform more operations to get  
various professional  
qualifications.

Physicians taking an unasked-  
for hand in current population  
problems is another factor in the  
sterilization of native women.  
One doctor, in the Contemporary  
Ob/Gyn, a medical journal, writes,  
“People pollute, and too many  
people crowded too close together  
cause many of our social and  
economic problems. These in turn  
are aggravated by involuntary and  
irresponsible parenthood. As  
physicians, we have obligations  
to our individual patients, but we  
also have obligations to the  
society of which we are a part.  
The welfare mess, as it has been  
called, cries out for solutions,  
one of which is fertility control.”

BMR Staffer Wins Awards

Chocolate Waters, staff  
member of Big Mama Rag, has  
been awarded two certificates of  
achievement by the Colorado  
Press Women at their annual  
awards banquet March 8. She  
was awarded second place for a  
personal column in a special in-  
terest tabloid (B//A) as well as  
second place in the interview  
classification for a special in-  
terest tabloid.

began to shout: “It’s you, the  
men who are ridiculous.”

The children began to suffer  
from the lack of air and push of  
the crowd. Mothers tried to  
protect the children behind a  
nearby car. Then the men chas-  
ed after them, trying to turn over  
the car. The men pursued the  
women and children, yelling,  

“The less children of those  
whores the better.” As they  
were escaping, one of the  
women shouted back, “Are you  
trying to kill us and our  
children?” The men stopped  
short for a minute. The women  
finally found refuge in a building  
about 100 meters away. The car  
they had first used for shelter  
was demolished by the crowd.

The police did not interfere  
when all the violence was taking  
place because, in their words,  
“There were too many people.”

Lea Flanders, special section  
editor of the Longmont Daily  
Call and president of the  
Colorado Press Women, claimed  
the sweepstakes award for win-  
ning the most entries in the en-  
tire CPW Communications con-  
test.

There were 72 winners in all  
and the judges for the contest  
consisted of 11 local journalists,  
two of which were women.

The forces of the COPCON (a  
special Portuguese security  
elite) arrived near the end of the  
demonstration. A crowd had  
already spent some time throw-  
ing things at the women, trying  
to smash in the door of the  
building where a large group and  
their children had taken refuge.

The mob completely stripped a  
17-year-old girl who was an in-  
nocent passerby. A reporter  
covering the event had to fight  
off a gang of men to free her.

A group of men chased Maria  
Teresa Horta, well known in Por-  
tugal as one of the Three Marias,  
whom they threatened to lynch.  
She escaped but the mob later  
went en masse to her home.  
There they threw rocks and  
anything available, smashing all  
the windows and doing con-  
siderable damage.
