There is a possibility of losing  
the ERA in Colorado in the November  
2 election, if we are overconfident  
and don't bother to vote. In New  
York, which is a much more liberal  
state than Colorado, the ERA lost by  
400,000 votes in 1975.

The Stop ERA forces have gathered  
121,000 signatures to place this re-  
ferendum item on the ballot and they  
are distributing thousands of leaf-  
lets. For the past three years, the  
ERA has been voted down wherever it  
has been placed before a popular  
vote.

The Equal Rights Amendment to the  
Colorado constitution states: "Equ-  
ality of rights under the law shall  

“not be denied or abridged by the  
state of Colorado or any of its sub-  
divisions on account of sex." The

O A ass?  

try discriminates against women in  
its rates and coverage. The insur-  
ance industry is regulated only by  
state governments and not Washington,  

so they can easily apply direct pres-  

sure on state legislatures.

In life insurance, most of the pro-  
fits come from large policies sold to  
married men. As men are forced from  
the role of sole provider of the fam-  
ily, women will probably not take up  
the slack on coverage. In 1972, of  
$212.274 billion of life policies sold,  
83% were sold to men, 73% of  
whom were married. The average pol-  
icy taken by a woman head of house-  
hold is $8,010 versus $21,430 for a  
married man.

Besides losing profits, the insur-  
ance industry does not want to have  
to face discrimination charges if the  
ERA passes. In medical and disabil-  
ity insurance, women get fewer benef-  
its and are charged higher rates.  
Pregnancy and gynecological ailments  
are excluded from coverage, while  
male disorders like prostate condi-  
tions are provided for. Employed wo-  
men often cannot get as much cover-  
age as wives of male employees. Wai-  
tresses are classified as generally  
"unacceptable risks" for disability,  
while waiters are not. In the same  
occupational categories, the rates  
are 45% to 115% higher for women than  
for men. Housewives

The other anti-ERA forces are con-  
servative religious groups (Right-to-  
Lifers), right wing groups (John  
Birch Society), and frightened house-  
wives in organizations like Wake Up  
Colorado. Business supports all  
these groups covertly with contribu-  
tions, and most of these groups are  

The basic question of the ERA is: Is it  
valid for legal distinctions to be  
made on the basis of sex?

There are strong forces opposing  
the ERA. The most important is big  
business. The ERA was first proposed  
in 1923, and lay dormant until former  
Representative Martha Griffiths  
brought it out of the Judicial Com-  
mittee; it passed easily in the House  
of Representatives, 346-15. In 1970,  
business was in an expansive cycle  
and decided it could afford to hand  
out some goodies to the girls.

Opposition soon developed however,  
when business realized it could not  
afford such a change in the structure  
of the labor force. With an already  
decreasing flexibility in the hiring  
and firing of blacks, the ERA would  
make the labor force too inelastic.

The costs of equality would also  
be high for business in terms of el-  
iminating the discrepancies between  
male and female work patterns. For  
example, if in 1970, women who worked  
had earned the same amount per hour  
as men who worked, it would have cost  
employers an additional $96 billion  
in payroll. Also, if women had worked  
the same number of hours, the payroll  
costs would have been $303 billion  
higher. (Of course, in this case pro-  
duction would have increased as well)  
The ERA and the traditional role of  
women in our capitalist economy will  
be incompatible.

Most of the opposition by business  
and labor has been covert because  
equal rights for women is a popular  
issue. They say they support the ERA  
but in practice, do not give money or  
show they are serious. The insurance  
industry has been the most obvious in  
its opposition. Most of the vocal  

anti-ERA leaders in the State legis-  
latures have been insurance agents.  
This is because the insurance indus-  

well-organized and financed.  
Many conservative Fundamentalist  
churches have actively supported the  

anti-ERA campaign. In Colorado, the  
Church of the Latter Day Saints has  
been prominent in opposition. In New  
York, the Knights of Columbus leaf-  
letted outside Catholic Churches. The  
Right-to-Lifers have linked their  
campaign against abortion with the  
ERA, saying that the sacred family  

and role of Mother are being destr-  
oyed by the Federal government.

The John Birch Society and other  
right wing groups have openly cam-  
paigned against the ERA. The JBS  
spends $8 million a year to field 85  
full time organizers throughout the  
country. According to research by  
the L.A. chapter of N.O.W., the John  
Birch Society was reported to have  
recently spent one million on a con-  
tract to print anti-ERA literature.  
Joseph Coors contributes heavily to  
the John Birch Society. Coors also  
supports right wing politicians who  
are anti-ERA ($1000 to Ted Strick-  
land and $250 to Sam Zachem, both  
anti-ERA candidates for state legis-  
lature).

In Colorado, the women's organiza-  
tions which are leading the fight  
against the ERA are "Operation Wake  
Up Colorado" and the “League of Hous-  
wives." They are both members of the  
national organization, "Stop ERA"  
headed by Phyllis Schlafly, which has  
offices in forty-five states. Much  
of their material for the anti-ERA  
campaign comes from Stop ERA which  
gets its information from the right  
wing "Network of Patriotic Letter  
Writers." The NPLW literature is co-  
color-coded by issues: anti-ERA is  
pink, racist slurs yellow, and educ-  
ation (anti-busing and sex-education)  
white.

The League of Housewives calls it-  
self a “grassroots” group composed  
of housewives, but it is also finan-  
ced by right-wing money which is  
raised nationally. (They have not  
filed the financial statement requi-  
red by the Fair Campaign Practices  
Act.)

The image of women in Stop ERA is  
that of a woman at home, happy and  
supported by her husband. An ironic  
anecdote about the League of House-  
wives is that their name used to be  
“The Happiness of Womanhood." However,  
they had to change it after they got  
too many phone calls by men looking  
for prostitutes.

The League of Housewives says it  
has 700 active volunteers who are  
“swamped with speaking engagements”  
at places like C.U., D.U., clubs like  
the Optimists Club, elementary school  
auditoriums, and churches. The literature  
they put out is full of innuendos,  
distortions and lies, although very  
well-fashioned and slick. They say, for  
example, that the ERA will make homo-  
sexual marriages legal (!), make wo-  
men lose rights to support and ali-  
mony, require unisex toilets, inte-  
grate athletic teams, require social  
security for housewives for which  
husbands will have to pay, and combat  
duty if the draft is reinstituted.

It is arduous and time-consuming  
to respond to these lies, but it is  
important because they stimulate a  
lot of fear. In fact, the courts do  
not interfere with ongoing marriages;  
only when a couple breaks up will the  
court make a judgment about support.  
With the ERA, support obligations  
will be determined by each partner's  
ability to pay. This means that the  
husband is not automatically chosen  
to support the children and that the  
wife could be given that responsibil-  
ity if she had a high paying job.  
This legal situation is already true  
in Colorado with the Uniform Dissolu-  
tion of Marriage Act.

Homosexual marriages would not be-  
come legal with the ERA. Nothing in  
the ERA prohibits sex-segregated  
bathrooms and the Supreme Court has  
said that there is a constitutional  
right to privacy between the sexes.  
(Airplanes already use single sex  
bathrooms.) Athletic teams may be  
integrated, but this does not mean  
that girls will not be able to play  
because of stiff competition with  
boys. Girls will gradually change  
their attitudes and abilities, and  
compensation can be made meanwhile.  
Protecting girls from competition is  
inherently restrictive.

I came to Finbour  
WHAT MY AMERICAN DUTY

ERA Colorado has found that women  
aged 18-35 are the group of women  
most opposed to the ERA. This is  
when women are most involved in fin-  
ding a husband, raising children and  
running a family. Later, women have  
more time to become involved in other  
tasks and roles; for young wives, it  
is difficult to resolve the conflict  
of loyalties between the family and  
oneself. The family is the primary  
unit of experience rather than the  
individual.

Will the ERA pass in Colorado and  
what will this mean to the passing  
of the Federal ERA amendment? It  
will be close. One thing in favor  
is that voters tend to vote "No” more  
often on referendums than "Yes" out  
of a fear of change. Colorado has  
had the ERA for four years and noth-  

DEAR WE'VE NOTICED  
THAT  

-ERA Battle Continues  

ing drastic has changed. There have  
been only five test cases in court.

Colorado is a liberal state and many  
of its laws conformed to the ERA by  
forehand. Women could vote in Colo-  
rado in 1896. The big changes in  
laws won't come until after the Fed-  
eral ERA passes.

It is the Federal ERA which is im-  
portant; states can only change their  
own particular state laws. However,  
if the amendment loses in Colorado,  
the ratification efforts in the rest  
of the country will “virtually stop"  
according to Gail Villa, head of ERA  
Colorado. This is because Colorado  
is considered such a liberal state,  
has had the ERA for four years and  
passed it with a huge margin. So  
everyone in the nation will be watch-  
ing the Colorado elections.

Two states have rescinded their  
votes for the ERA and there are ef-  
forts afoot in 19 other states to re-  
scind. If the ERA loses in Colorado  
and Massachusetts this year, the mo-  
mentum behind Stop ERA will increase  
and the remaining state legislatures  
will not pass the ERA. Rescinding is  
not legal according to previous test  
cases, but it has psychological im-  
pact on the rest of the country.

ERA Colorado was formed by a  
coalition of establishment wom-  
en's groups. Gail Villa was hi-  
red to run ERA Colorado because  
of her varied experience doing  
Republican campaign work and be-  
cause she ran a successful cam-  
paign for Kathy Donahue for City  
Council last year. She believes  
in the system. When she talks  
about the ERA, she emphasizes  
that it will help men as well  
as women.

The way ERA Colorado is run-  
ning its campaign is very simi-  
lar to the way the same campaign  
was run in the state of New York.  
The emphasis is on legal rather  
than personal issues. Civil  
rights are stressed and the bro-  
ader political outlook ignored.  

The organizers of ERA Colorado  
are afraid of feminists damaging  
their image. They are gearing  
the campaign toward middle class  
well-educated voters. They have  
not put much effort into working  
with minorities, working class,  
unions or people in rural areas.  
They seem to be aiming their  
campaign toward people like  
themselves.

It has been hard to raise money for  
ERA Colorado. This was true in New  

So Don't Aware  

THE NERVE OF  

York which only raised 1/3 of its  
goal. Perhaps women do not realize  
their financial power and the cost  
of the campaign. Radical feminists  
have also not contributed to the ERA  
campaign. It has been dismissed as  
“reformist,” and only liberals are  
expected to fight for it.

The ERA can be helped to pass by  
voting on November 2nd. Unfortunately,  
the last day for registering to  
vote was September 31st. Women can  
go door to door talking with other  
women to help educate them about the  
issues. On election day, women  
can drive other women to the polls  
etc. Call 623-1898, if you would  
like to help.
