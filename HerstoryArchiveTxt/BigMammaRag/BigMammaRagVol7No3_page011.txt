Voices From Our Lives........  
Fighting Back  

Emergence  

Kris Klemann  

Upon returning home after a long  
trying day at school, I would reward  
myself with a glass of cheap wine or  
a bottle of cold beer. It relaxed me  
so I could face the remainder of the  
day with a positive outlook. I was  
comfortable with a glass in my hand,  
viewing my life as if it were a soap  
opera. The alcohol did magical  
things as it crowded the worries and  

fears out of my mind and into my heart.  

Of course, I never got drunk, at least  
when I was alone. If I did become a  
bit too relaxed I would simply take a  
short nap. Unfortunately, I would a-  
wake not with a headache, but with a  
pain of emptiness. Aspirin cannot  
ease that kind of pain but a drink  
can, temporarily.  

At dinner time, not having anyone to  
share my meal with, I would share it  
with my beer or wine, depending on the  
type of food and my mood. The many  
conversations between my glass and me  
were rather one-sided, but at least  
the glass never said anything to  
offend me. Having had such a warm and  
friendly conversation at dinner, I  
would invite the bottle to stay for  
the evening. With blurred bloodshot  
vision I would read a book or do some  
writing while letting the music fill  
my dazed mind. "I just close my eyes  
and drift away.“  

Was that a knock at the door? But  
I'm not expecting anyone. Quick! The  
bottle goes in the cupboard, the eye-  
drops are in the medical chest and  
the gum...where did I put it? Never  
mind that, answer the door. Whoever  
is there must be getting impatient.  

I feel like I just crawled out of the  
gutter but doesn't everyone enjoy a  
drink now and then?

Last fall, I started to get lazy.  
That is, I thought that was the prob-  
lem. It was a familiar route for me.  
It seems like whenever things get to  
be too much (responsibilities build  
up and I find I have little time for  
myself) I sleep more and more. I  
find my waking hours unproductive and  

soon am depressed about everything.  

That was how I felt last fall. I  
was working 40 hours a week for a  
corporation while trying to start a  
small business of my own. I was a  
member of the ever-too-small BMR col-  
lective and the mother of an active  
five-year-old.  

I began sleeping more and more, let  
my responsibilities slide, and became  
more and more depressed. I thought  
that I might be ill, but put it off  
as hypochondria. (I have been a  

self-diagnosed hypochondriac for  

years).  

After several months my friends  
started telling me that I looked  
tired and pale. I started blacking  
out. I just couldn't cope anymore,  
so I went to a DOCTOR.  

I apologized during my first visit  
to the doctor. I told him that I  
just wanted to be sure my health was  
ok before I started therapy--I knew  
that all my physical ills had to be  
psychologically induced.  

I learned that day that I was se-  
verely anemic. The doctor prescribed  
vitamins. Still I didn't recover.  

I grew weaker daily while faithfully  
going in for vitamin injections.  

Slowly, I opened the door, keeping  
the chain hooked. There stood a man,  
someone I had never seen before,  
knocking at my neighbor's door, not  
mine. Feeling like a complete fool,  
I shut my door quietly. Maybe no one  
saw me. Another drink and I would  
forget the embarrassment.  

With the support of women at the  
Women’s Studies College at U.B., I  
left these days behind, in the closet,  
and saved my life. Check your clo-  
sets, many of our sisters need our  
support to take better care of them-  
selves.

Not too long ago, I shared a table  
at school with a little man, a pro-  
fessor of something or other. As I  
looked over my notes pretending to  
concentrate, he glanced at my note-  
book, snoopy little man that he was  
and asked, “How does such an organized  
person, as I see you are with such  
organized notes, live in such a  
chaotic world?"  

Funny, because I was thinking along  
the same lines - wondering if I would  
ever get to be really healthy, and  
if I got healthy how could I possibly  
stay that way in such a crazy world.  

"I used to drink," I told him.  
Strange answer. Because, as I remem-  
ber correctly, drinking didn't help  
me deal with any chaotic world or  
make me healthier. In fact, drinking  
just allowed me to ignore everything  
going on around me. It made me numb.  
I felt no pain, no anger, no disgust,  
no rage. Nothing. I felt nothing. I  
did not care about the position of  
women. I did not care about child  
abuse, nuclear warfare, the murder of  
helpless animals, or the pollution  
of the earth. I didn't care about  
anything or anybody. And I didn't care  
about myself. I thought I was a vic-  
tim, a helpless little person, whose  
ideas meant nothing to anyone. I  
thought I didn't matter. I thought  
one person cannot possibly make a  
difference in this crazy world and  
besides if by some chance one per-  
son could make a difference, it would  
by no means be me.  

I started caring about myself not  
too long ago - stopping drinking was  
part of the process. When I was first  
getting sober, getting clear, feel-  
ings were hard to bear. They were  

such an unknown experience I thought  
many times that I was surely going to  
die. At first it was just enough to  
live through the experience. Just  

to make it through without a drink,  
to feel loss, pain, anger, joy and  
love. To feel. LUNA (Lesbians United  
To Nip Alcoholism) was the child  
of anger. Anger that there was no  
place for me to go for support that  
felt right, where I could be accepted  
as a lesbian and a feminist.  

I have discovered that women can  
gain tremendous strength from each  
other, that each one of us holds a  
great power within, which can be  
tapped to make our lives good and  
wholesome and meaningful. We have the  
power to do whatever we want to, if  
we believe in ourselves. If we accept  
our role as victim then that's ex-  
actly where we'll stay.  

Women who are drunk, stoned, trip-  
ping out, dazed and drugged don't do  
a damn thing. Not for the women's  
community, the feminist movement, or  
for themselves. Hurting ourselves  
is not feminist.  

If we are going to judge things  
as being "politically correct” or  
not, then let's really look at some  
important things. The drinking and  
drug problem in our community is a  
good place to begin. It is serious  
and it won't just go away. We live  
in a drinking, doped-up world, but  
is joining right in going to change  
anything? How can we have any impact  
at all on anything if we are numb?  
People who are aware and alert are  
dangerous, dangerous and threatening  
to the system in which we live. The  
more people there are yelling and  
screaming and needling and demand-  
ing their rights, the better things  
will be.  

The Vulnerability and Guilt of Illness  

After several weeks of becoming more  
and more anemic, the doctors sug-  
gested that the anemia might be  
psychologically induced or else a  
symptom of a larger problem. He  
scheduled me for testing.  

I spent the next two months work-  
ing, sleeping, and crying. I was  
tested for a long string of terminal  
illnesses. I looked at my child and  
cried. I looked at my lover and  
cried. I thought about my job--the  
first decent one I had ever had--and  
cried. I took a leave of absence  
from the BMR collective and cried and  
cried.  

Well, to make a long story shorter;  
after several months of daily inject-  
ions, tests, and medications that  
caused me to hallucinate or pass out,  
the big diagnosis came in: an infect-  
ion of the blood and bone marrow due  
to a rare soil bacteria. The bacter-  
ia emits a toxin that binds hemo-  
globin, thus causing the anemia.  

I didn't know how to react. Should  
I be pleased that I had a "real" phy-  
sical ill instead of a mental one?  
The doctor reassured me that it could  
be a combination of both.  

The road to recovery was (still is)  
tedious. I fall asleep at the drop  
of a hat. I have fallen asleep at  
parties, meetings, and even during  
phone conversations. I dropped a  
television set at work (I work as a  
TV technician) and frequently shocked  
and/or burned myself in the course of  
doing my job.  

The most difficult thing about be-  
ing sick (after the fear of terminal  
illness had passed) were the feelings  
of powerlessness and guilt. I spent  
most of my life working to become a  
strong woman, so it really is no sur-  
prise that I reacted so poorly to be-  
ing weak. I was not only physically  
weak, but also completely vulnerable  
at the hands of the doctors that  
treated me. They advised me to quit  
working, but who would pay their bill  
if I did? They advised me to get help  
in caring for my child, but did not  

suggest how I might get help.  

A few weeks ago I complained to a  
friend who works in a health care  
profession. "Be thankful,” she said.  
"Seventy per cent of all cases of  
your particular type of infection are  
diagnosed at autopsy.”  

So, maybe it wasn't so bad after  
all.
