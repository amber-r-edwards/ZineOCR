Prison Issue

Dear BMR,

I enjoyed reading your last issue
on Women in Prison. Especially right-
on was the article by Wendy Steele. I
was also very glad to see the reprint
by Assata Shakur, but the fact that
there was no biographical sketch ex-
plaining who Assata is and how she
happens to be in prison was a very
serious omission. Assata is one of
the very strong women freedom fighters
in the Black Liberation Army who has
been framed time and time again for
her political position against the
U.S. government. White feminists need
to know that. You also omitted a cre-
dit to the Black Scholar which origin-
ally printed that article.

There were also some facts left out
of the article that are very import-
ant to the overall prison situation.

The most obvious being the U.S. gov-
ernment statistic that over 90% of
women in U.S. prisons are black. This
one fact points out that prisons con-
stitute a very significant political
statement. The articles were all
about the individual situation and
immediate needs of some women in pri-
sons. Certainly this is very import-
ant information to get out, but it is
equally if not more important to try
to understand the role prisons play
to uphold the U.S. imperialist gov-
ernment. If 90% of women in prison
are black and 25% of all black men
will go to prison in their lifetime,
does that mean that black people are
inherently criminal? NO!! It does
not. The criminal (in)justice system
has historically been selectively
used to dissipate and destroy the
strength of black people as a whole.
The powers that profit from the
COLONIAL position of black people in
this country cannot afford for blacks
to rise from the circle of poverty
and prisons to gain self-determination. This is why Assata Shakur is

in prison.

Another disappointment in this is-
sue was the coverage of the Socialist
Feminist Conference. It is hard to
say whether the vagueness was the con-
ference itself or the reporting. "A
good deal of the conference was spent
processing women's and men's roles at
the conference and in the movement."
Now what the hell does that mean? I
would have particularly been inter-
ested in coverage of the “issues to
be discussed" around why the left and
women's movement have failed to take
up each other's issues. "The personal
is political" is an old discussion,
let's move forward and smash the
state!

Night March

Dear BMR,

I want to say how well I thought the
Women Against Violence Against Women
march and rally went.

I want to compliment all the sisters
who did such a good job of marshalling,
organizing and providing protection.
Well done!

Also thanks to the men who provided
childcare.

And to all the terrific women and
children and men who marched - it was
great to share that kind of power.

The march was a much needed solid-
arity-building action and it felt good
to be there.

In sisterhood,
Phyllis Crawford

Action Praised

Dear BMR:

Please send me a year's subscription. I'm
enclosing $6 for that. I hope you can
start with the August issue. Also,
I'd like to get a copy of the July
issue, and I'm enclosing $1 to cover
the cost of that.

I appreciated hearing about the
action against the Thornton disco. A
bar here in Amarillo has a similar
"ladies night" and it's good to hear
about an effective way to take action
to protest this kind of obscenity.

Boulder Radio
Show

Dear Women of BMR,

Hello. I am very interested in re-
cording anyone for the Lesbian-Gay
Media Project with KGNY in Boulder.
This project will have a two-hour
weekly radio program starting in Sep-
tember on Wednesday or Thursday night
9-11 p.m. Part of the show will dis-
cuss gay-lesbian issues, another part
will include features pertaining to
women's issues, and another part will
include a community billboard of
women's activities.

This is a good opportunity to ex-
press our ideas to the community and
I am anxious to involve as many wo-
men's groups as possible. If anyone is
interested or if you know of any oth-
er women or groups interested in re-
cording either in Denver or Boulder
please contact me.

Ineptitude
Pays Off!

Hello-

Thank you very much for carrying us
on your subscription list even though
our subscription officially ended in
February.

We are enclosing $4 in addition to
the $6 rate to help toward any “cause
that needs it the most.

We really enjoy the newspaper and
it really helps us to keep in touch
with what's happening to lesbians and
other women.

Once again thanks for your patience.

Responds

Dear BMR,

I thought it appropriate to wait
for the appearance of your editorial
(July-August 1978) before offering
my comments on your handling of my
article: "Just What Can Feminists
Afford? A belated Lesbian Separatist
Response to "Creating A Women's
World" and its broader political im-
plications--January 1978. (BMR April
and May).

I am very pleased that you chose
to facilitate the wider distribution
of my article to feminist readers.

It is no easy task to produce and dis-
tribute a movement paper; and I am
not unaware of the extra work (and
money) that goes into including a
lengthy article such as mine. Al-
though it is completely understandable
that a newspaper, such as BMR, would
want to restrict space allotted to
any one feminist writer to permit cre-
ation of a greater representation
of movement opinion, I feel that my
article was somewhat misrepresented--
and correspondingly diminished--by
your not printing it in its entirety;
neither the subtitle, nor the acknow-
ledgements appeared.

In sending you a copy to consider
for publication, my cover letter ex-
pressly requested that should you
decide to publish it, it would be pub-
lished in its unedited form. This pro-
vision, a safeguard to prevent any
possible distortion of an anticipated-
ly controversial writing, was agreed
to by you in spite of the fact that it
deviates from your said policy of
maintaining editorial control. (I am
not criticizing your policy; rather,
