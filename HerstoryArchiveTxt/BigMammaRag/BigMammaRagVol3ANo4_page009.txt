Cookin’ with Raw Honey: Mount View School  

Wh BeeSweet  

pure  

As one approached the  
grounds it was calm, serene,  
pleasant, clean, modern. Inside  
the chapel was Raw Honey  
already in progress with a rapt  
audience and some young  
women dancing. An old feeling  
reminiscent of boarding school  
sprang up, but it was Mount View  
School For Girls. There were no  
matrons, no overt signs of a  
correctional institute until one  
girl started out for fresh air and  
three women in their twenties  
leapt up to stop her. An attempt at  
normalcy was being made but  
there, nonetheless, existed an  
app-pervasive feeling of being  
watched.  

At first few were dancing then  
it picked up with a tempo that  
increased all throughout the

evening. With time the  
counselors, three women and  
one man, evened out and one in  
particular almost left her seat in  
pleasure when the girls began a  
group dance. At intermission the  
counselors were eager to answer  
questions with frankness and not  
with an over-zealousness for  
projecting a good image.  

There are 85 young women  
and 20 young men. It was former-  
ly all women but is now in the  
process of changing to a 50-50  
situation. They range in ages from  
13-18 and their offenses from  
running away to armed robbery  
to attempted murder. None are  
first offenders and for some this  
is their seventh or ninth offense.  
A great number of them are  
Children In Need of Supervision  

(CHINS) and this no doubt led to  
the development generally of an  
adjustment and preventive ap-  
proach on the counselors’ part  
rather than punitive.  

The youths are here for two  
years on a parole type release  
basis and come from all over the  
state as well as Denver. There is  
also an exchange program with  
Alaska. Visits of ten days and  
weekends can be gotten and  
some are in public schools and  
work outside the grounds on  
their own. On the recreational  
outings not one youth has fled  
since last summer even though  
every opportunity is there as it is  
even on the grounds — no  
fences, no guards. For those that  
remain in school on the grounds  
there is a teacher in every cot-  

tage.  

The counselors range in age  
from 22 on up to middle age and  
are about half female and half  
male. As would be expected  
there are a lot of them with  
psychology, sociology and  
counseling backgrounds. As for  
the counselor to youth ratio, it  
was put between 10:1 and 3:1 so  
probably lies somewhere in  
between.  

As for Raw Honey — excellent.  
They were spontaneous with the  
kids and the music reached them  
all and toward the end even the  
ones on the periphery began  
responding. As for the issue of  
their being an all-woman band, it  
was no issue. It was evident it  
was a delightful evening for  
everyone there.
