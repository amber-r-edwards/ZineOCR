Musicians Provide Political Evening

Deborah Taylor

Kristin Lens has recently produced
a new 45 record called
the One side is the title song,
about objectification of women's
bodies and the other is a gentle
lullaby on women's strength.

"Mammary Glands" is a spoof of the
emphasis placed by this society on
women’s breasts. The lyrics are
satirical; the chorus is “Mother
Nature's Dairy Delight, you can't
make cream or butter cause it's
just a human udder--a natural mam-
malian sight. Talking about wom-
en's breasts like this somehow seems
sacrilegious. Slide trombones and
the mooing of a cow at the end em-
phasize the satire.

“Women Walk More Determined,” the
other side of the record, is musi-
cally polished. A women's chorus
and bongos give this song a soothing
quality that matches the lyrics.

The chorus, “women walk more deter-
mined than they ever have. You have
another kind of woman who will ask
a lot and give a lot and live a whole
lot more," is inspiring.

These two songs are not as polit-
ically radical as other songs Kris
has written and performed in concert.
I look forward to a full length al-
bum when a wider expression of her
political and musical awareness can
be shared.

Recently Kris appeared in Denver,
singing in a concert with her
friend, Jeanne Mackey from Washing-
ton DC. It was an event to remem-
ber. Kris and Tim Vears, her accom-
panist (playing electric bass),

played the second set. They had the
audience on their feet and dancing
by the end of their set--a remark-
able feat since they were playing in
a church. The women whooped at her
irreverent sense of humor and sar-
castic renditions of old 50's songs
like "Teen Angel" and "What A Lady."

Women’s Films Show in Denver

Cheryl

As this issue goes to print, the
women's film series Women Picture
Women playing at the Ogden Theater
is three-fourths through its four
week run. The series, which plays
on Sundays at 12 noon at 935 Colfax
for one more Sunday (May 8)
was put together and distributed
by Insight Exchange, an alternative
feminist collective that distributes
non-sexist, non-racist movies.

The series emphasizes women as
survivors, and sometimes winners, in
society. Grouped into four cate-
gories: Artists, Health and Bodies,
Sex Roles, and Surviving, the series
relies heavily on documentaries but
also includes the Denver premiere
showing of a feature length Danish
film "Take It Like A Man, Madam.”

The first showing, Artists, includ-
ed "Womanhouse” which shows a house
created by feminist artists to explore
the "female" experience, and several
theater events that took place there.
The entire house, in and of itself, is
an artwork; eggs on the kitchen
ceiling, tampons in the bathroom,
exaggerated and blown up to stress
the complexities and contradictions
that women face in the home.

Also shown with that was “Me And
Stella," a film about an 83-year-old
Black domestic from the South,
Elizabeth Cotton, and her guitar
Stella. Ms. Cotton has written
songs and played the guitar since her
teens and many of her songs have
become well-known favorites and
extremely successful. Pete Seeger
recorded her song “Freight Train",
learned from her when she worked
for the Seeger family. However, Ms.
Cotton has never received any money
from her songs. While others have
recorded them, she has never been
paid any royalties. This film
touches on her hard work and strug-
gles to survive, physically and men-
tally in a world that has never given
her her due.

feminist painter and her fight to
free herself from old forms, and to
strike a delicate balance between
her emotional and technical mastery.

To top that showing was the Denver
premiere of “Imogene Cunningham:

Give Up for rightly, eighty-
year-old women gave her views on
art, people, society and talked

about her photography and the differ-
ent places it had taken her. The
indomitable Imogene also talked about
aging, although she did not appear

to be greatly slowed down by it
herself, but appeared to be merely
annoyed by it.

"Take It Like A Man, Madam" is a
feature length film produced exclu-
sively by a collective of Danish
women, ranging in age from their
20's to their 40's. The movie shows
a housewife's discontent with her
life and the hardships she experiences
when she decides to go back to work.

The middle part of the film is an
extremely well done fantasy section
where men are the housekeepers and
women are the executives. This
tricky section is pulled off with
nice touches like the men putting
false hair on their chests before
going out on a date. It is to be
hoped that this film will receive
wide distribution as it discusses
many subjects, such as menopause,
which many women never see dealt
with on the screen.

Insight Exchange, in bringing these
films to commercial movie houses, seeks
to show strong images of women to
much wider audiences and convince
movie-house owners that feminist
films can be commercially successful.
Linda Mayo and Karen Shertzer are
the two mainstays of Insight Exchange,
consider themselves propagandists.
They have successfully done film
series in San Francisco and Sacra-
mento, California, Eugene, Oregon, and Seattle,
Washington. This trip to Denver is

and political integrity. Her
stage presence and the merging of
her politics with her music was sim-
ilar to the quality of Holly Near.

Jeanne is a politically-confident
socialist-feminist,
versatile musician. Her songs var-
ied from “Private Property” to “Long
Time Friends," and she was excellent
on the guitar and piano.

Jeanne lives in Washington DC and
has been performing for women and
working in the movement for many
years. At present, she is touring
with her friends, Penny, Kristin,
and Tim.

She has recently made a wonderful
tape with Mary Trevor that can be
ordered by writing her at 1720 New-
ton St NW, Washington DC 20010,
or calling (202) 265-0188. Kris'
record can be ordered for $1.50 from
carolsdatten production, 908 W. Cal-
ifornia #2, Urbana, IL 61801.

Both record and tape are well worth
the effort it takes to acquire them.
