Sexual Politics - The Controversy Of Lesbian S&M  

Dear Sisters,  

Again, Connie Perenyi has  
said what we're thinking  
most apropos Sapphistry. To  
our shame, it had been ordered  
last spring from Naiad  
when we knew nothing about  
its contents. It sold out  
and we won't carry it again.  
But Connie has been the only  
reporter to point out the  
insidious connection current  
psychological beliefs have  
with S/M in Sapphistry. When  
I read the interview with  
Samois in Aug? Sept? issue  
of Plexus and saw the con-  
cluding statement that the  
Samois beliefs were the  
essence of feminism and I  
thought no, the essence of  
therapy and a reaction  
against politics. Thanks  
again for a good analysis.

This letter is really to  
all the women who have thus  
far or are contemplating  
writing a negative article a-  
bout lesbian S&M. Lesbian  
feminism and lesbian S&M  
can't be a total contradic-  

tion because both are lesbian.  

To pose the question, "can  
feminists be involved with  
S&M?" when some clearly al-  
ready are is to negate and  
invalidate these women. Let  
these women come tell their  
stories. Theoretical "femin-  
ism" now seems in the pages  
of BMR (as some in Plexus  
and OOB) engaged in denying  

cover:  

the feminism of some because  
of their sexuality. How can  
you, Andrena Zawinski, for  
example, deny that acting  
out fantasies can be cathar-  
tic? Can exorcise? Because  
you haven't experienced it?  
Because no one has told you?  
You write sentences which  
attempt to persuade in the  
style of a television com-  
mercial: "The cathartic the-  
ory has been challenged over  
and over again. Information  
points to..."  

If you care about the wo-  
men who "have grown to love  
their chains," you don't  
show it. You say you care,  
but it sounds like what you  
care about is exorcising a  
disturbance in your own mind.  
You react with horror and it  
sounds to me like saying you  
care is like saying "I'm  
hurting you because I love  
you."  

I really don't want the  
words "feminist" or "lesbian"  
used to repress any woman's  
sexuality, whether it looks  
"gay male" or "S&M", or  
"Hetero". I don't want to  
use these labels to batter  
down our sexual explorations.  
Sexuality is an exploration  
only she or they can inter-  
pret, for you, not the other  
way around.

Dear Sisters,  

I would like to respond to

(published in February 1981  
issue of BMR) entitled "Les-  
bian Feminism and Sadomaso-  
chism: Two Big Contradic-  
tions in Terms". Let me be-  
gin by establishing my iden-  
tity as a Lesbian Feminist.  
I have been an “out" Lesbian  
since the age of twelve and  
a Radical Feminist since the  
age of fifteen. I have been  
an activist in the Women's  
Liberation Movement and the  
Gay Liberation Movement in  
Denver for five years, organ-  
izing conferences, festivals  
and protests of many kinds,  
founding two organizations  
and being an active member  
of several others, writing,  
teaching, speaking in pub-  
lic, and just doing all  
sorts of the everyday dirty  
work in our efforts for  
Freedom of Choice. I am a  
strong believer in Freedom  
of Choice and a person's  
right to direct and control  
his or her own life in any  
way they see fit as long as  
they do not tread on anoth-  
er's rights.  

I am also a woman who has  
recognized my dominant-sub-  
missive fantasies and who  
has learned to accept them  
(not be afraid of them) and  
who enjoys acting out these  
fantasies with other women  
who enjoy them also.  

Andrena Zawinski condemns  
S&M sex, yet acknowledges  
that many of us have fanta-  
sies based on this passive-  
aggressive model. She does-  
n't make any proposals as to  
what a woman is to do with  
such desires. The underlying  
message in her writing is  
that we shouldn't have such  

inside BMR:  

fantasies or maybe that a  
"Good" Feminist would rep-  
ress these desires. Also,  
she never does identify what  
specific kinds of sexual ex-  
pression "should" or  
"shouldn't" be practiced.  

I'd like to begin by say-  
ing that all good sex is  
psychodrama anyway, whether  
you're acting out a pre-ar-  
ranged dominant-submissive  
script or acting equal.  
Andrena obviously has no  
experience in the S&M arena  
nor does she have much fac-  
tual information. She bases  
all of her arguments on  
myths and sensationalism.  
Let me say a few things  
about what S&M is and what  
it is not. S&M is role-
