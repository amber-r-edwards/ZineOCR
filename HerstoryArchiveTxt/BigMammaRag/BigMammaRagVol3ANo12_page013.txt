NOW Convention

Dykes Divided in Caucus

Theresa Schook Kathleen Kolar

The National Organization for
Women recently held a nation-
wide convention in Philadelphia.
The purpose of this gathering
was threefold: to elect new
officers, to determine financial
priorities for the coming year,
and to provide personal training
workshops for the delegates
from all over the country.
Representatives from the
Denver chapter of NOW have
returned from the conference.
One representative, Gingerlox,
who is also a coordinator of the
local Lesbian Task Force, gave
an overall summary of the
Philadelphia events.

She observed that the Les-
bian Caucus was not unified
during the entire conference.
The other factions of NOW
seemed to feel that the lesbians
“had it together,” however, and
tried to separate the various
groups within the caucus. At the
beginning of the convention,
Karen DeCrow, beginning her
second consecutive term as
NOW president, met with the
Caucus and apologized for the
past lack of official support for

the Caucus. She would provide a
more actualized, definitive
program, if they would support
her bid for re-election.

The major cause for division
within the ranks of the lesbian
caucus was the issue of suppor-
ting a NOW presidential can-
didate. One group, led by
members from the Colorado
delegation, felt that the caucus
should not support any one
candidate. Another group, led by
Barbara Love (co-author of
Sappho Was a Right-on
Woman), pledged the caucus to
interviewing the candidates for
NOW national committee of-
fices.

A great deal of the political
action of the lesbians originated
in a two-room suite named the
“Colorado Action Center.” The
Colorado delegation had a sten-
cil machine, so they were called
upon to print most of the pro-
paganda floating throughout the
hall as well as official
documents and lists. In an in-
direct attempt to reunite the
caucus, the Action Center was
used as a gathering place for les-
bians to talk informally.

The only issue which re-
united the members of the
caucus was the Lesbian Rights
resolution, which stemmed from
another proposal titled the
Martha Buck amendment. The
Colorado delegation was mainly
responsible for organizing the
caucus to rewrite the resolution
until it met with everybody’s ap-
proval. Of a total of 30
resolutions proposed, lesbian
rights was one of less than five
which passed. This makes les-
bian rights a NOW priority. In
NOW politics, priorities get
money; in this case, 1% of all
dues or about $5000 will go to
actively supporting lesbian
causes. This is the first time that
lesbians have been given a
priority.

The Colorado delegation
appeared to be the only group to
express opinions as a group.
During the convention, the
members of the delegation felt a
great deal of sisterhood and sup-
port for each other. It was
exciting for them to be as
politically active as they were.
They feel they have ac-
complished much in pushing for
lesbian rights.

sentences are stilted and awk-
ward. The characters are stiff
and one-dimensional. Dialogues
are lacking in spontaneity,
seeming more like monologues
rather than verbal exchanges.

“Your shape is lovely,”
Artemis declared.
“Yours is quite nice too,”
Alexis countered. “Your breasts
are the most beautiful I've ever
seen.”

There ensues a rather trite
paragraph describing sexual
preliminaries between the two
women. Then the dialogue
begins again.
“You feel good,” Artemis said
softly.
“You make me feel good,” she
replied, “and I’m glad,” Alexis
told her. “I'm very glad. It takes a
while to really be free with
someone, to be capable of total
abandonment, to trust deeply
enough to express every fantasy
and wish. But with one’s be-
loved the process should be
fun.”

“It sounds good to me,”
Artemis commented.

(Alexis and Artemis). The two
had just met that afternoon; and
they made rather stilted love in
the next paragraph, filled with
“the steady pulsations of her
happy cunt.”

Accountability

Quite often, the way some-
thing is said will affect what is
being said. This appears to be
the case with The Ripening Fig.
The writing style is so awkward
and trite, that the ideas
presented have been garbled.
Perhaps this is a direct result of
the authors doing their own
editing. However, the writers
should make a commitment to
some sort of accountability and
responsibility to the readers. The
time has passed when the move-
ment can accept any purported
feminist writing, regardless of
quality. There must be a greater
attempt toward good writing, to-
ward clarity, toward meaning.
Martha and Lucy say their
writing had flaws because of
their lack of patience in writing
and editing the stories. They
should remember the words of
Epictetus: “No great thing is
created suddenly...” They
assured their audience that their
next book, The Auraleans, will
be much better, and that they
will edit their own writing more.

Censorship
“It is with profound pride that
we admit to censoring,” the
editorial reads. “We see our-
selves as an alternative to all the
avenues open to any copy which
insults, oppresses, and in any
and every conceivable way re-
presses us, as lesbians and
women. In other words, cen-
SORship has always been

Let the Buyer Beware

It has come to Big Mama's
attention that the buyers of older
homes are urgently in need of a
law requiring the seller of the
home to warrant against
defects. California has such a
law in force to protect the
innocent buyer of either a new
home or an older home, but
other states do not.

Constant referrals to con-
sumer protection agencies in the
news media encourage the
buyer to believe that all areas of
consumer buying are protected.
However, after contacting these
agencies, the buyer soon learns
that all but purchases of older
homes are within their protec-
tion.

Buyers of older homes, who
discover structural defects that
are known to the seller, must
gamble their small incomes in
civil court where the great body
of law, “Caveat Emptor,” is
against them. These buyers can-
not expect to recover enough to
cover the cost of curing the
defects, even should they win in
court.

“Let the buyer beware.”

At present, the meager life
savings of women who are in-
experienced in the building
trades or unknowledgeable in
law, are being poured into unfit
dwellings. When major struc-
tural defects are discovered,
they are told by various agen-
cies that fraud is difficult, if not
impossible, to prove under cur-
rent laws of “let the buyer
beware.”

Widows and others who have
no credit rating must buy small
older homes when they cannot
afford to maintain their larger
homes, often because of high
taxes. Recipients of low in-
come, social security and pen-
sion benefits cannot afford
today’s high rent costs. The high
crime rate in low-rent housing
areas is driving some to seek
safety in small older homes in
suburban or farm communities.

Unscrupulous sellers, using
the Caveat Emptor doctrine for
their protection, are taking un-
fair advantage of unknowing
women by selling them homes
that are unsound and uninhabitable.

Women made scapegoats
Women are made the scape-
goat of this outmoded and unfair
doctrine, created for men
buying and selling among men,
which encourages fraudulent
selling to women by denying
them legal recourse. It places all
blame on women for their lack of
building education and buying
experience and faults them
because they have been prone to
trust in licensed agents.
Women are further placed at a
disadvantage by the “let the
buyer beware” laws that deny
legal recourse by pre-empting
other laws that might help them
(i.e., full disclosure or com-
parison of experience, etc.). At
the same time, these laws allow
the seller to hide behind the
facade of their doctrine when
the seller has full knowledge of
major defects.

Civil law has traditionally
limited legal recourse to women
because of their low incomes
and their inability to pay the high
costs of court and attorney's
fees. In fact, it is so commonly
said and taken as factual that
“the man with the most money
can hire the best lawyer, and the
best lawyer always wins,” that
this quote is used to intimidate
and discourage women from
seeking legal help.

The Consumer Credit Code
and Consumer Protection Agen-
cy has been formed to protect
the consumer in loans and pur-
chases of personal property.
New homeowners are protected
under new home warranties,
thus it seems only fair to ask that
consumer protection be extend-
ed to cover the buyers of older
homes.

Those most needing con-
sumer protection are the buyers
who lack the funds to cure un-
anticipated major defects and
are forced to remain in uninhabitable dwellings, or who
have had to lose their downpay-
ments to rescind the contract
that is held by the seller. Homes
within the city limits that are not
on city water and sewer usually
do not qualify for commercial
loans.

equal protection under the law

Feminist Films Showing

Libby Atkins

Moonforce Media, Inc. is a
non-profit feminist enterprise
formed as an alternative and
challenge to the power of the
“established media.” Moonforce
strives to create a strong, self-
sustaining feminist media by
making the products of media
workers available to ever-
widening audiences. It en-
courages women to support
media which reflect their own
analysis of society and desire for
change. Future plans include
film production, expanded dis-
tribution and promotion of
feminist media, as well as train-
ing women in all of these areas.

One project of Moonforce is
the national Women’s film cir-
cuit, a nationwide series of
showings of outstanding
feminist films. These films will
be shown in Denver, Saturday,
December 6th, at the University
of Colorado Denver Center,
Room 116, at 11:00 and 1:30
pm. Enter from Arapahoe
Street. Tickets are $2.00 at the
door. There will also be
showings in Boulder at the
University of Colorado Law
School on Friday, December 5th
and Sunday, December 7th at
6:30 and 9:00 p.m. All proceeds
from these showings will go to
the circuit, to train and educate
women in media.

The showing will consist of 6
films which were chosen by
audiences who viewed over 100
entries in the National Women’s
Film Contest held in
Washington, D.C., last summer.
They express a wide variety of
styles and subject matter,
presenting an honest and
refreshing view of women. This
event marks the first time that
women filmmakers have been
given a showing nationwide.
These films are truly unique for
representing women as they see
themselves and other women.
