The “Alive” Church

(coll. note: Last March,

BMR printed an article by
Tatyana Mamonova, a Russian
feminist. She referred to a
large faction of the feminist
movement there as being con-
nected spiritually and tac-
tically to the Russian Orth-

the church

odox church. This led us to
want to find out more about
how organized religions func-
tion differently in differ-
ent countries and cultures.

We began to recognize our
racism and cultural chauvin-
ism at work—white feminists
proceeding with our work,
working off of assumptions
that women of color and wo-
men in other countries have
defined their issues the
same way we have and have
chosen (or should choose)
the same strategies for or-
ganizing. The Catholic church
has historically oppressed
women through its enforce-
ment of the nuclear family
structure, and through the
stands it takes on issues
like birth control and ab-
ortion. And, BMR will cont-
inue to criticize all forms
of organized religion as
they play the role of dev-
eloper and enforcer of va-
lues and codes of ethics that
support the economic inter-
ests of the state over the
needs of the people.

But at the same time, the
faith of Catholicism and the
structure of the community
church exists all over the
world, and is not distinct
from the cultures it has
been a part of for so long.
Women all over the world are
fighting for the right to
control their lives and bo-
dies. And, these struggles
take many forms, including
organizing around survival
issues on a local grassroots
level, where the church has
become a very effective org-
anizing vehicle, providing
a communications network,
meeting space, and gather-
ings of large groups of peo-
ple.

So, for this theme issue,
Liz interviewed Agnes Schum,
a Sister of Loretto, who
works with the Denver Area
Justice and Peace, to find
out about the church in Cen-
tral America and its role
in social change.

Talk a bit about your work,
and your recent trip.

I went for a month to Cent-
ral America with a group of
twenty religious leaders from
the U.S. and Canada Justice
and Peace offices. We talked
with church leaders, govern-
ment leaders, women, peasant
groups, and workers in Mexico,
Nicaragua, and Cuba.

Primarily what we do at
Justice and Peace is education
about social justice issues.
Any issues that affect people.

Are ties between the Catho-
lic church in this country
and the church in, say, El
Salvador, very close?

Yes, well at
this point it's
very difficult

because so

many of the missionaries have
been murdered or exiled. Most
of the information we receive
from Latin America is from
missionaries—Catholics and
other church groups.

How does that work? In terms
of power structures, who's do-
ing what work, and who's pro-
viding what leadership? What
kind of hierarchy is there?

In Central America

I guess I see it as a whole
lot like the women's movement,
where there isn't really a
hierarchy. There's a whole lot
of horizontal sharing of in-
formation. For example, many
of the people we get informa-
tion from belong to our same
group, or are people that
we've been in touch with. Like
I know a lot of Mary Knoll sis-
ters around the world (a miss-
ionary order), so I know peo-
ple in, say, Nicaragua. So I
get personal letters. But
there are also networks of in-
formation that we get from
Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Mexico,
some limited out of Guatemala.
At this point, out of El Sal-
vador, primarily information
has to leak out to refugees

-L. Boyd/LNS
and then to the rest of us.
So, a lot of it is personal con-
tact, and then there are net-
works to get information out
broader. We also work with
the national offices out of
Washington, like there's a
Washington office on Latin Am-
erica. But not a hierarchical
structure at all.

What kind of role is the

Catholic church in El Salvador
playing in the revolution?
Does the church serve as a
mediary between government

and revolutionaries, as was
somewhat the case in Poland?
With the murders of Archbishop
Romero and several missionar-
ies recently, it doesn't seem
like there is much trust be-
tween church and government.

Well, yes and no. You have
to look at two churches—
the people's, popular, grass-
roots church, and then you
have the bishops, which would
be the hierarchy. On that
level there has still been
some communication with the
government. In El Salvador,
some of those bishops are in
solidarity with the people
but in some countries that's
not so true. In Nicaragua,
for example, the bishops are
much more with the U.S. pos-
ition than with the Nicarag-
uan position. That makes it
difficult. But primarily in
El Salvador, it is the pop-
ular church that is the "a-
live" church, if you will.

How are those two churches
connected? Is there any ac-
countability? Who provides
the leadership?

I don't know if you can
talk about accountability—
there is some connection, and
they're trying to be support-
ive of each other.

I think Archbishop Romero
was a leadership voice, and
in some ways, still is. His
successor has picked up a lot
of that, but is doing a lot
more mediating, rather than
saying this is right, this
is wrong. And I think Romero
only came to that because
he was seeing so many of the
priests being murdered. It
was a radical conversion
type thing. Whereas his suc-
cessor is trying to be more
of a leveling influence.

In terms of the leadership,
what's happened in the last
twenty years especially, is
a movement called "liberation
theology"—a small group com-
ing together to look at the
gospel message, and realizing
from that that they are worthy
of respect as human beings.
So, in a sense, building dig-
nity. At the same time, help-
ing to organize. For example,
at a village, people have
learned that they can organ-
