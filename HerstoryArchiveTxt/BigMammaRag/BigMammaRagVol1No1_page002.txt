The President is DEDICATED TO PEACE ... HE SAYS... My  
HIGH SCHOOL WAS DEDICATED TO EXCELLENCE ... IT SAID...  
Bank AMERICA IS DEDICATED TO THE PEOPLE... IT SAYS...  

TERMS BEING WHAT THEY ARE, IT WOULD SEEM MORE  
THAN INAPPROPRIATE FOR US TO LAY DOWN YET ANOTHER  
DEDICATION AND GIVE ONE MORE CAUSE FOR SKEPTICISM. OUR  
HOPE IS THAT THIS PAPER, WITH THE HELP OF ALL THE WOMEN  
WHO READ AND CONTRIBUTE TO IT, WILL DEDICATE ITSELF; THAT  
IT WILL DEDICATE US TO EACH OTHER AND TO OURSELVES; THAT  
IT WILL REPLACE THE OFTEN TIMES EMPTY RHETORIC OF  
“SISTERHOOD IS POWERFUL” WITH A VIABLE AND TANGIBLE  
REALITY. WE BELIEVE THAT UNITING AROUND PROBLEMS  
COMMON TO ALL WOMEN WILL ALSO GIVE US THE STRENGTH TO  
DESTROY A SYSTEM THAT EXPLOITS AND MANIPULATES NOT  
ONLY WOMEN, BUT ALL PEOPLE OF ALL COUNTRIES. AND  
THROUGH THIS WE WILL FIND THAT WE HAVE MUCH MORE TO SHARE  
AS SISTERS, AS WOMEN, AS FRIENDS, AS HUMAN BEINGS.  

OUR HOPE IS THAT THE FEELINGS EXPRESSED THROUGH  
The Mama RAG WILL RELATE TO THE FEELINGS OF ALL WOMEN,  
EVERYWHERE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR POSITION OR SITUATION —  
TO THOSE WHO ARE LOST IN THE SOLITUDE OF A PREFABRICATED  
WOMAN'S ROLE AND TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEGUN TO FEEL THE  
UNDERLYING STRENGTH IN BEING A WOMAN.  

OUR INTENTION IS TO SERVE AS AN EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION  
SYSTEM FOR SURROUNDING AREA GROUPS, ACTIONS AND EVENTS:  
BUT MORE THAN THAT, WE HOPE THAT AS YOU READ THE  
ARTICLES HERE, YOU WILL FEEL THAT WHAT YOU HAVE TO  
SAY IS IMPORTANT — TO YOURSELF AND OTHER PEOPLE. WHAT-  
EVER IT IS, IF IT ENTERED YOUR MIND IT HAS PROBABLY  
ENTERED THE MINDS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER WOMEN, AND  
SHARING AND EXCHANGING IS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM  
THAT IS NOT PARTICULAR BUT PERSONAL TO ALL WOMEN.  

IF THERE WERE TO BE A DEDICATION IT SHOULD BE TO THE  
MEMORY OF ALL THE WOMEN WHOSE LIVES HAVE PASSED WITH  
OUT THE SLIGHTEST UNDERSTANDING, AND TO THEIR SELF-  
EXPRESSION, THAT LAY SUFFOCATING SOMEWHERE BENEATH THE  
CAKED LAYERS OF SOFTIQUE AND JERGEN'S LOTION.  

DEDICATE?... TO OURSELVES?... TO ALL WOMEN?... WHY  
Not? How UNLIKE A WOMAN TO DEDICATE SOMETHING TO  
HERSELF!  

WE NEED EACH OTHER, IF NOT YET, THEN SOON — IN  
STRUGGLE WE CAN LEARN TO LOVE AND CARE AND RESPECT  
EACH OTHER.
