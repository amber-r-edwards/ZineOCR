I was arrested on Monday,  
November 16, 1981, during the  
Women's Pentagon Action, and  
charged with obstructing an  

entrance. I did not walk at  

provides reinforcement only  
by echoing past propaganda  

and does not offer new facts  
or fresh insights. The sur-  
est way for me to be original  

is to be personal -- for I am  
young and not well-read in ra  

women’s pentagon action  

all throughout the arrest pro-  
cess nor did I give my name  
and address. I was arraigned  
and sentenced as Jane Doe and  
was subsequently numbered  
Fourteen.  

When I appeared before the  
Federal Magistrate and plead-  
ed "no lo contendre" on the  
day of my arrest, I was unpre-  
pared to make a statement be-  
cause I had not known in ad-  
vance that I would be allowed  
to do so. I said I did not  
feel I had committed a crime,  
but I'm afraid I used too  
much jargon about "the war ma-  
chine” and "patriarchy" to  
have been at all original.  

Originality is very impor-  
tant. As a blind person, I  
do not have access to all  
that is in print and must be  
selective about what is read  
to me. I become restless,  
therefore, when what I hear  

america held  

medical feminist politics.  

I have never read a feminist  
newspaper. In jail, for the  
first time, women read me se-  
lections from a book of poems  
and essays compiled by third  
world feminists called THIS  
BRIDGE CALLED MY BACK. Until  
this year, I consistently mis-  
spelled the word lesbian as  
"lesbyan" because I had never  
seen it written. What radic-  
als I have read have all been  
men.  

But, you wanted to know why  
I sat down on the ramp at the  
south, loading dock entrance to  
the Pentagon. Actually, I was  
lying down when they arrested  
me. Before my sisters were  
dragged away, we sat with  
linked arms so that men either  
had to step over or break us  
apart -- which is symbolic of  
what men do to women every day  
of their lives. That is also  

hostage day 345  

406,000 ring in the New Year with reductions in food  
stamps, retirement benefits and welfare payments while  
another half-million found themselves in the unemploy-  
ment lines. To combat the high unemployment rates among  
minority youth, Reagan proposed "sub-minimum wage" levels-  
guaranteed to increase Ronald McDonald's (and other  
clowns) profits by several million dollars per year.  
Unemployment among Black youths exceeds 60%. There are  
currently 4 bills in the House and 2 in  
the Senate supporting the rights of  
Big Business to pay slave wages  

to minority youths, supposedly  

an effort to reduce their un-  
employment rate. The House and  
Senate have both passed bills  
forcing consumers to finance the  
Alaska pipeline--a venture so  
risky that no bankers or other in-  
vestors would back it.  

Meanwhile Libya has dramatically  
increased spending for housing, education, day care cent-  
ers and other social programs and has effectively fought  
new colonization. Reagan, having recognized their success-  
ful anti-Reaganomics policies, has called all Americans  
home and staged a media blitz against Libya that is "long  
on hysteria and short on hard facts"--tactics reminiscent  
of those that put the Shah in power in Iran 29 years ago.  

Back in the US, as winter sets in; tenant evictions,  
utilities shut-offs and food shortages are at an all time  
high for the poor.  

Suddenly I don’t

what the Pentagon is doing to  
the American people. The de-  
mand for more money, generated  
by its administration and their  
plans has lowered the economic  
standard in America and created  
schisms along the interacting  
lines of class, race, and sex.  
I lay down  

INDEIN  

for my country in the end--  
aware that men had lain down  
for it on foreign soil, never  
to rise again.  

I did not, however, lie down  
for the government of the Un-  
ited States. I do not believe  
in governments as they exist  
today or existed in the past--  
supported by lies and armies  
and fear. No matter whose  
side they are on, they offer  
their people just one choice--  
to play along in the game of  
East-West politics. This is  
not freedom.  

I lay down for the people  
living within the bounds of  

manifest destiny-- many  
brought here against their  
will--many lured here and mis-  
treated and then taught to  
mistreat those who came later--  
many who sought refuge from  
economic and social oppression  
spawned by the colonialists  
and imperialists of Europe and  
continued today by the U.S.  
and U.S.S.R. I lay down for  
the people of the world whose  
lives depend on the decisions  
of the nuclear powers. I lay  
down for women because war,  
like rape, is a man's game,  
because the Reagan administration  
says that women are not  
equal to men in this economy,  
and because women should op-  
pose power structures for it  
is power, in the hands of men,  
which oppresses us all.  

More personally, I protest  
because I sense a universal  
turbulence that I want  
stopped. I was eleven in 1973  
when peace in Vietnam was pro-  
claimed in Paris. My respect  
for presidents, diplomats, and  
laws was unshaken even by Wat-  
ergate. (Corruption is the

original sin of politicians,  
and I did not expect a polit-  
ician to be totally uncorrupt  
any more than I expect anyone  
to be totally good.) Never-  
theless, I knew that the world  
was not at peace. The news  
was full of the Middle East,  
the arms race, South America,  
Africa-- and always the U.S.  
was involved. The world is  
still not at peace.  

I was aware of racism and  
anti-Semitism in my town and  
in my home. The most vivid  
things I remember learning a-  
bout in school were the sup-  
posedly unmitigated dangers of  
hallucinogens and narcotics  
and the different forms of  
birth control. We debated the  
ERA. The girls wanted it; the  
boys did not.  

I was a blind  
woman competing in a sighted  
world, and competition makes  
equality irrelevant.  

I knew my parents disliked  
Anita Bryant because "She  
brought all the queers out of  
the closet." I had read some-  
where that those people could  
get psychological help. Being  
blind made me different, and  
I was taught to be normal or  
superwoman in all other ways.  
I was not queer. When I was  
fifteen, I fell in love with  
another woman, but I was not  
queer. I repeated to her what  
my parents said about Anita

16 Years Later... Scars That Don't Heal  

Masha  

One of the most damaging im-  
ages given to women by the pa-  
triarchal society is, "the  
helpless-in-the-world-naive-  
child.” Men often think we  
need their protection and in-  
struction to survive. In the  
1950s and 1960s, many women  
fell into the trap and gave  

away power; some are doing so  
even now. Any self-motivation  
including seeking higher edu-  
cation was seen as something  
to do until the man came as  
rescuer to take us away from  
all that. Convinced that the  
world is a frightening place;  
many women rushed into early  
marriage and pregnancies. Now  
we see through the false ima-  
ges and are reclaiming our  
power. I internalized the he-  
lpless child role which cau-  
sed me devastating effects  
when I actualized this belief  
system in the world by also  
rushing into marriage and pre-  
gnancy at an early age. I  
share my experience because  
it is an important political  
issue which contains another  
important issue, psychiatric  
assault.  

One of the most disastrous  
ways women give away power is  
to doctors. Many are men and  
carry out oppressive roles.  
The hardest lesson I ever got  
in my life was from a preg-  
nancy and childbirth which  
turned into severe depression.  
I trusted doctors totally at  
the time since I was then  
male-identified. Knowing bet-  

A New Image For Shock  

Lori Bradford  

Sometimes when writing as  
an ex-"mental patient" within  
the feminist movement I have  
a hard time believing that the  
issues of psychiatric assault  
(the sanctioned abuse--physi-  
cal, mental, and emotional--of  
those defined as "mentally  
ill" by the American Psychia-  
tric/Medical Association) have  
any reality, within that move-  
ment. I wonder how to explain  
that life at the hands of the  
psychiatric system has become  
“medically approved torture"  
for so many people, and that  
that is a political issue for  
the feminist movement.  

The Nov. 1981 issue of the  
Cosmopolitan carried a horri-  

ble article, the “Surprising  
Truths About Shock Treatment"  
by Susan Mauk. This article  
proposed to put to rest that  
“silly notion" that electro-  
shock "therapy" has suffered  
any deserved decline in use  
or respect--that shrinks con-  
sider it a safe, fast, cheap,  
and effective treatment that  
need not be viewed through a  
veil of fear, and that we (es-  
pecially us women) need not be  
“frightened by the mere thought  
of electrodes, jolting cur-  
rents, teeth-clenching seiz-  
ures.” Mauk's article presents  
an unreal picture of the uses  
and the administration of ECT  
and its side effects ("side  
effects" like permanent memory  
loss and brain damage).  

I woke up with a splitting head-  
ache not knowing where I was.  
They thought they knew, doc-  
tors, attendants... Did they  
also know that I have never  
recovered from my short and  
long term memory loss and  
mental confusion?  

Women, there is an import-  
ant political issue here,  
psychiatric assault! How ma-  
ny sisters are imprisoned in  
these shock wards? Women out-  
number men by far. Easy to  
stick a label on any woman,  
crazy, lock her up. And, la-  
ter...groggy from shock trea-  
tments...memory and life im-  
paired...leaving a scar that  
will never heal. It hurts me  
in my soul to know that this  
is taking place even as I wr-  
ite. I maintain women are as  
much political prisoners in  
these shock wards as in jails  
where people are held unfair-  
ly for fictitious crimes. The  

“Treatment”  

It seems that this was an  
especially vicious article to  
have appeared in a journal  
that caters to women, as women  
are the primary victims of ECT.  
Hailing ECT as the “treatment  
of choice" for pregnant women;  
despite a study that showed  
among 33 cases there were 2  
infant deaths and 2 infants  
with serious fetal damage.  

And yet again irresponsibility  
flares in Mauk's article as  
she commends ECT for older pa-  
tients. In the most extensive  
study of electro-shock fatali-  
ties, circa 1957, it was esti-  
mated that the mortality rate  
for ECT patients 60 years of  
age and older was five times  
higher than the rate for all  
age groups.

struggle of N.A.P.A. is the  
struggle of every woman! It  
is essential to not trust doc-  
tors with a naive eye. How  
many women are addicted to  
Valium, a substance harder to  
kick than heroin, given by  
doctors? What about the strong  
medication given to subdue  
people in psychiatric wards  
throughout the country because  
they become “easier to deal  
with" and are out of the way?  
Some of these are now given  
in injection and have long-  
acting potential, several days  
at a time. This is assault and  
denial of freedom.  

PSYCHIATRIC ASSAULT  
by Masha  

I bury my head in my lap.  
alone  
I cry.  
So depressed  
Why.... ?  
I don't know...  
I just had a baby.  
I should be happy..  
Shouldn't I?  

Waiting...  

For someone  

To help the pain.....  
He called the doctor..  

Now...  
I wake up  

In a cold grey world,  
My head hurts.  
Where am I..  
My brains feel crushed...  
Imprisoned in my body...  
What happened?  

“SHOCK TREATMENT,"  

A woman says,  

Peering behind steel grey  

eyes..  

I crouch in the corner  
Like a wounded animal.  

They tell me it's alright,  
My memory will return.  
But it's been 16 years.....
