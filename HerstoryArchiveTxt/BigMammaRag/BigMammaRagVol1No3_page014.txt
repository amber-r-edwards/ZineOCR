WHAT?

middle-class fad with more  
empty rhetoric than quiet  
strength? Will you be angry  
with me for saying that a  
Women's Lib paper or magazine  
is of the same breed as Male  
Chauvinist Pigs' Women's  
Magazines? Are you just a  
joiner or are you interested  
in a change?  

There is only one real  
change that can take place,  
and it is a change that takes  
place in each individual.  
There is a moral to be drawn  
here, even though morals have  
fallen from grace. It concerns  

the dignity of being a human  
being and how we should respect  
that dignity in others. It  

has been made a maxim in  

every great religion or  
philosophy that has ever lived.  
It begins,  

in the world. "Do  

unto others..."  

ACTUAL SPEECH OF WOMEN'S  

I am not a liberated woman.  
I do not know of one woman in  
this world who is liberated -  
being female we are all equally  
subject to the same inherent  
evils in our everyday living  
situations. To believe that  
the freedom of women focuses on  
individual solutions to “our  
problems" is just another rusty  
door which should've been  
kicked off its hinges by all  

of us years ago.  

When I walk down the street  
I am just as likely to be  
leered at, whistled at, or  
made the butt of some insensi-  
tive joke as my mother is, or  
my next-door neighbor, or the  
woman who works as a doctor  
or the one who performs  
janitorial services. When any  
woman applies for a job which  
has previously been held mainly  
by men, she is just as likely  
to be hassled about it whether  
she identifies with Margaret  
Mitchell or with Kate Millett.  
There are no individually free  
fish in an aquarium.  

No one today would think of  
telling a black person that her  
or his discrimination is an  
individual dilemma. "Pull  
yourself up by your bootstraps"  
has pretty much been buried  
under the pile of old books  

where it belonged in the first  

place. It is also generally  
acknowledged that racism is  

the direct result of someone's  
huge obnoxious thumb being  
pressed down upon someone  
else's vulnerable if unwilling  
head.  

Yet as women we still fall  
into the trap that we are our  
own thumb-pressers, that the  
snapping of the strings  
which bind us can be accompli-  
shed with thousands of personal-  
ly monogrammed scissors,  
that the problem is ultimately  
one of "human liberation" (and  
look who's already ahead by  
the very nature of the word).  

The liberation of women  
does not mean exchanging  
female stereotypes for male  
stereotypes. We should not  
wish to adopt either the  
feminine or the masculine roles  
as they are presently conceived -

Maybe I Can Answer  

Mariame Waters  

Walter Wall Street. Further-  
more, the liberation of women  
does not mean that our publi-  
cations are similar to the  
male-dominated women's  
Magazines - e.g. Family  
Runaround, Redneck Book,  
Cashmopolitan, Vague, Women's  
Daydreams, etc. Feminist  
publications do not seek to  
make "women's place" more  
comfortable and easy (e.g.  
how to scrub the floor in 5  
minutes instead of 25) but  
rather to question and explore  
the kinds of problems which  
affect all of us as women.  
Pointing the finger  
where it rightfully belongs is  
an extremely necessary first  
step for any second-class  
individual or group. The  
black person who was denied the  
bank presidency because of  
race is not individually  
responsible for that denial.  
The woman who was molested by  
her father as a child is not  
personally accountable for the  
confused way she may always  
view sexuality because of that  
molestation. The feminist who  
sees that she lives in a  
society so lop-sidedly in  
favor of the other sex that she  
is always looking up from the  
bottom of the see-saw must  
justifiably be angry with whom  
she sees sitting at the top.  
Nevertheless, this revela-  
tion is only a first step and  
we as women must constantly  
work together to carry over  

the realities of our politics,  
sexual, and economic (etc.)  

discoveries (and what are  
"human issues" composed of  
after all?) into our everyday  
living situations. Only  

then can we begin to make a  
revolution with our lives.  

But by continuing to believe  
that every woman is personally  
accountable for the less-than-  
someone role that's always  
been thrust upon us we may all  
end up in the playground -  
together but alone at the  
bottom of our respective see-  
saws. There is a moral to be  
drawn here and while it may not  
be quite so old and venerated  
as some it is certainly as  
worthy. It begins, "United  

we stand..."  

SUFFRAGE MEETING  
We will have what men have.  
It may not be much, but we mean to have  
it. If we cannot have it through our  
Organization, we will have it through our  

Combination, or without, if necessary. We  
refuse to be poked in the gallery any more,  
but insist on being placed on the floor of the  
House. That drunken loafer in the house  
says, “Down with the petticoats." I say  
"Up with the petticoats and down with the  
pants." Then things would be visible in their  
true light. We must get together; so who  
as long as women are split up as we are the men will  
always be on top.  

am I waiting for that moment?  
to “give" me  
you? me  

so why don't I?
