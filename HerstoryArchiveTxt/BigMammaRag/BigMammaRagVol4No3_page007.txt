Pushing Fear of Fatness Feeds Profiteers

Woodwoman

Several years ago the Ladies
Home Journal published a sur-
vey which showed that women
are more afraid of getting fat
than of all the pain, hatred and
killing in the world. This might
explain why fat people in this
culture are held in such con-
tempt. It certainly explains why
the weight loss business has
swelled to an $11 billion indus-
try.

Most people accept without
question the prevailing myth
that obesity is caused by over-
eating and laziness. It follows,
then, that fat is the sufferer’s
rightful punishment for indul-
gence in the deadly sins of sloth
and gluttony, and the societal
prejudice which deprives fat
people of civil rights, medical
care and human dignity is ra-
tionalized. All the fat person has
to do is to exercise a little self-
discipline and soon she'll be
down to a normal, healthy
weight and her troubles will be
over. If she stays fat, she has
only herself to blame.

The truth of the matter is that
the average fat person eats
about the same amount, or less,
than the average slim person.
What actually causes fatness
has not yet been ascertained,
but there is strong evidence that
it may be hereditary. Obesity
indicates a body type, not the
presence of a disease. (Often fat
people do end up eating com-
pulsively; however, fat activists
have pointed out that this is
hardly surprising. After a life-
time of being told that they eat
more than other people when
they know they don't, being
pressured to diet so that they
feel hungry all the time, it makes
sense that they would grow ob-
sessive around food.)

The kind of thinking that per-
ceives fat people as slim people
with something grossly wrong
comes from the same place as
that which sees blacks as de-
fective models of the (white)
ideal. Both concepts spring from
the inherently sexist notion of
“otherness”: that anyone not
conforming to the image of the
dominant race is, by definition,
inferior.

Fatness and Women

While all fat people are sub-
jected to daily discrimination
and outright ridicule, fat women
face the most frightening op-
pression. In a world where
women are valued primarily as
sex objects, attractiveness to
men and survival go hand in
hand. As a researcher noted in
the Journal of the American
Dietetic Association back in
1946, “young women are acute-
ly aware of the value of a slim,
well-shaped figure both as a
social and an economic asset.”

Not only is the fat woman not
attractive to men, she is assum-
ed to be indulging her own body
rather than offering it up for their
enjoyment. She is not giving
men what they want, and so for-
feits her rights in their world.

That women are much more
anxious to lose weight than are
men is evidenced in the incred-
ible volume of weight-loss ad-
vertising aimed at us. We are
bombarded constantly with
promises of social success — i.e.
acceptance by men — if only we
will “melt away excess pounds”
by using some pill, cream, diet or
exerciser. The message is clear
enough that millions of women
agonize over the least weight
gain, terrified that “if I don't lose
those extra pounds, I'll lose
HIM.” This is no small threat. Its
implications as a form of social
control are worth considering.

Indicators of women’s fear of
fat include the fact that 85% of
all amphetamines prescribed
are taken by women, and 83% of
all amphetamines prescribed
are for weight loss. Also, one
consequence of starvation diets
is the development of pulmon-
ary tuberculosis, and twice as
many women between the ages
of 15 and 24 die of TB as men.

Health and Obesity

The other major threat
levelled at fat people, and one
which, more than any other, is
used to rationalize societal pre-
judice, is that of ill health.
Hypertension, gallstones, vari-
cose veins, heart disease and
early death are all traditionally
associated with obesity. Psy-
chologically, it is said to cause
anything from depression to
severe psychosis. So doctors
tend to send their fat patients
away with printed diets, often
declining to treat them until
they've lost weight. Some doc-
tors even refuse to deliver fat
pregnant women, holding that
they are prone to toxemia and
difficult deliveries. All women
are warned against weight gain
during pregnancy.

In fact, it's been proved that
toxemia has nothing to do with
weight. It is a condition preval-
ent in women who have not had
adequate medical care during
pregnancy. The same can be
said for difficult deliveries. And it
is now recognized that insuffici-
ent weight gain during preg-
nancy can prove injurious to the
unborn child.

Prescribing a diet for obesity is
the height of irresponsibility. Re-
search has proven that over 95%
of all those who lose weight diet-
ing regain it within 5 years. The
practice of continually losing
and regaining weight puts a
great deal of strain on the heart.
The singer Cass Elliot died be-
cause the muscle around her
heart had atrophied after years
of such wear.

It is also known that serum
cholesterol levels increase dur-
ing weight gain, and there is no
evidence that they decrease
when weight is lost. In other
words, the person who diets will
almost certainly regain her lost
weight, and every time she does,
her cholesterol level goes up.

This is not the only explana-
tion for the relationship be-
tween obesity and hyperten-
sion. Equipment for testing
blood pressure is, like cinema
seats, turnstiles and public
transport, not designed to ac-
commodate fat people: often
the reading will be high be-
cause the cuff is too tight. And

black people have discovered a

relationship between hyperten-

sion and oppression.

“Remedies”

Diet pills, the kinds freely
available in drugstores as well
as those prescribed, contribute
to the strain on the cardiovas-
cular system. All the most com-
monly used ingredients — such
as amphetamine, phenylpro-
panolamine HCl, phenmetraz-
ine HCl and benzphetamine —
have side effects injurious to the
heart. In the case of ampheta-
mine, deaths have been report-
ed from cardiac collapse and
hemorrhages. Other side effects
include nervousness, irritabil-
ity, headaches, depression, con-
stipation, nausea and skin erup-
tions. Phenmetrazine HCl,
marketed as Preludin, is highly
addictive, and has been known
to provoke severe psychosis.
Methylcellulose, another popu-
lar diet pill ingredient, thickens
the blood, further straining the
pumping action of the heart;
also, some users have had to
undergo surgery for occlusion in
the throat, stomach and intes-
tine.

It is no wonder, then, that
most excess mortality among fat
people is due to cardiovascular
disease. As for gallstones, vari-
cose veins and early mortality,
there is no proven correlation
between these conditions and
obesity. In fact, markedly over-
weight women actually have a
lower mortality rate than under-
weight men.

Dieting, on the other hand,
has been credited with damag-
ing nerve and other protein
tissue, upsetting body chem-
istry and contributing to tuber-
culosis, pneumonia, typhoid
fever, colitis, diarrheal ail-
ments, anemia, and diseases of
the teeth, bones and nerves. Fre-
quent use of cathartics, which
force food through the system
too fast for calories — and
essential nutrients — to be pro-
perly absorbed, tends to irritate
the intestinal walls, which re-
spond by producing a coat of pro-
tective mucus; which in turn im-
pedes absorption even further.

Because a body which has
been starved utilizes calories
more efficiently than one which
hasn't, the fat person who diets
must eat very much less than the
average person in order to main-
tain weight loss. In fact, many fat
people are actually malnour-
ished. As one researcher states,
“weight reduction (in obese
study subjects) could be main-
tained only by means of chronic
under-nutrition.”

Intense Prejudice

Those psychological symp-
toms of depression and neu-
rosis not directly attributable to
drug side effects can feasibly be
traced to the effects of years of
self-hatred and despair. In a
study of obese girls at a typical
summer camp, it was noted that
they displayed characteristics
strikingly similar to the traits
sociologists have shown to be
typical of youngsters in op-
pressed minority groups who
were victims of intense preju-
dice... the lack of an ‘in group’
and particularly the lack of
family supports actually seemed
to expose the obese youngsters
to even greater tensions than ex-
perienced in minority groups.
Not surprisingly, some women
have been reported to have suf-
fered “emotional disturbances
of psychotic intensity” while
dieting.

A 1966 government publica-
tion on the subject of obesity and
health suggests that “social
pressures on the obese adoles-
cent girl cause such psychologi-
cal symptoms as obsessive con-
cern with body image, passivity,
withdrawal and expectation of
rejection.” Also, that “physi-
cians should keep in mind that
the patient's problem may be
one neither of psyche nor soma
but rather a conflict with the
standards of society.” Typically,
the report uses these insights to
illustrate the necessity for pre-
venting and “curing” obesity,
thus throwing responsibility for
the prejudice of the population
back onto the fat person.

That fat people can be happy
and healthy in a judgment-free
environment has been proven by
studies conducted in the 60s in
an Italian immigrant commun-
ity in Roseto, Pennsylvania. The
village's 1700 fat inhabitants eat
high calorie, high cholesterol
Italian food, yet deaths from
heart disease are 1/3, and the
incidence of diabetes 1/4 the na-
tional average. Researchers,
baffled, investigated this com-
munity three times before fin-
ally being forced to conclude that
“contentment” might have
something to do with their find-
ings. The inhabitants of Roseto
think that fat is far out, and there
are no feelings of shame or guilt
attached to obesity, nor any
pressure to reduce. When they
left the village to live in every-
day U.S.A., however, they fell
prey to the stress-related dis-
eases from which the average
fat American suffers.

But even in the mainstream of
this society, fat people who stay
fat stand a better chance of sur-
viving a coronary than slim
people or fat people who try to
lose weight, as a 1952 Mayo
Clinic study reveals.

Fat Profits

It is clear that a major reason
for the continued oppression
and mystification of fat people is
profit. It's a perfect setup: make
life intolerable for a certain
group of people; then identify
their distinctive characteristic as
a disease, and offer to cure it.
One researcher states un-
equivocally that “at present it is
incurable: but this doesn’t stop
the profit-mongers from prom-
ising high-priced miracles.

For a section of the popula-
tion made gullible by misery,
things haven't changed all that
much since the medicine show
quacks offered colored water as
a cure for all ills. Diuretics, and
dietary salts for example, con-
tinue to sell well, the rationale
being that part of the “problem”
of obesity is caused by an un-
natural accumulation of water.
Fat people don’t accumulate any
more water than anyone else,
however, and the only ones to
profit from the sales are the
manufacturers and the drug-
stores.

The doctors whose patients
come back time and time again
for the diets which will fail and,
later, for treatment of hyperten-
sion and drug-related illnesses;
the surgeons who cut sections
out of intestines (resulting in
severe damage to internal
organs and chronic malnutri-
tion); the dentists who wire jaws
shut; the psychiatrists who
“treat” chronic depression, neu-
rosis and even psychosis; the
diet food manufacturers; the
producers of weight loss pills,
diets and appliances; the pro-
prietors of “health” clubs and fat
farms; organizations like Weight
Watchers; all the entertainers,
columnists, cartoonists and
women’s magazines who manu-
facture jokes and advice at fat
people's expense — all these are
reaping the profits.

Fat Pride

Meanwhile, fat people aren't
getting any thinner. They are,
however, getting a lot angrier.
Fat liberation groups have been
in existence for several years.
Fat Power, by Llewellyn Louder-
back, was published as long ago
as 1970. The only existing group
to combine the principles of
feminism with those of fat activ-
ism, however, is the Fat Under-
ground, a Los Angeles organ-
ization. These women have
produced some excellent litera-
ture, exploring the peculiar op-
pression suffered by fat people,
and women in particular, out-
lining specific areas of concern
and refuting widely-held myths
about obesity. Of particular
interest to those who might
want to start their own groups, is
an account of the progress of a
fat problem-solving group,
whose members emerged from
the experience with radically al-
tered perceptions of them-
selves and society.

One prominent researcher in
the field of obesity has said that
inside every fat person, there is a
thin one frantically signaling to
get out. In the light of this so-
ciety's horror of fat, it might be
more accurate to say that inside
every slim person, there is a fat
one threatening to take over.
