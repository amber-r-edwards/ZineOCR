Menstrual Sponges

cycle, first cut or tear it into
smaller pieces. The size most effi-
cient and most comfortable depends
on your blood flow, but usually a
moist piece about the size of a
small egg is fine. Sponges expand
in size and are very soft when moist-
ened, so you can experiment with
larger pieces when your flow is
heavier and smaller ones when your
flow is lighter.

Next, clean the piece you're going
to use by rinsing it under clear,
warm water and removing anything
that may be on it like salt, bits of
rock, netting material, or any other
sea stuff. If you decide to boil it,
don't boil for longer than 5 minutes
since it will get tough and shrink
the longer you boil it.

Because it's so soft, you'll have
to rinse your sponge a little more
often on your heavier days than you
would have changed a tampon. Gently
reach inside yourself and pull the
sponge out. Contracting your sto-
mach muscles will help it to pop out
easier. If it starts to tear, relax,
get a firmer hold, and resume pulling.
Once it's out, rinse it with

Genital Mutilation

for some time, and an atmosphere of
mutual confidence and understanding
had been established, she would be-
gin to recount her childhood memor-
ies. A college student told me that
her brother used to caress her sexual
organs and she experienced acute
pleasure. After undergoing circum-
cision she no longer had the same
sensation. A married woman admitted
that during intercourse with her hus-
band she had never experienced the
slightest sexual enjoyment, and that
her last memories of any form of
pleasurable sensation went back 20
years, to the age of six, before she
had undergone circumcision. A young
girl told me that she had been ac-
customed to practice masturbation
but had given it up completely after
removal of the clitoris at the age
of ten.

Since circumcision in females aims
primarily at ensuring virginity be-
fore marriage and chastity through-
out, it is not to be expected that
its practice will disappear easily
from Egyptian society or within a
short period of time. A growing num-
ber of educated families are however
beginning to realize the harm that is
done to females by this custom, and
therefore seek to protect their dau-
ghters from being among its victims.
Parallel to these changes the oper-
ation itself is no longer performed
in the old primitive way, and the
more extreme forms of the operation
are dying out more rapidly...

For many years I tried in vain to
find studies that would throw some
light on the reasons for such a
brutal operation. However I did dis-
cover other practices related to
girls and female children which were
even more savage. One of them was
burying female children alive almost
immediately after they were born, or
even at a later stage. Other ex-
amples are the “chastity belt," or
closing the aperture of the external
genital organs with steel pins and
a special lock. This last procedure
is extremely primitive and is very
much akin to Sudanese circumcision,
where the clitoris, external lips
and internal lips are completely cut
away, and the orifice of the genital
organs closed with a flap of sheep's
intestines.

In the face of these complicated
procedures aimed at preventing sex-
ual intercourse in women except if
controlled by the husband, it is
natural that we should ask ourselves
why women in particular were subjec-
ted to such torture and cruel sup-
pression. There seems to be no
doubt that society, as represented
by its dominant classes and male
structure, realized at a very early
stage that sexual desire in the fe-
male is very powerful. The patri-

bathrooms you have several rinsing
options: you can raise consciousness
by doing the whole procedure public-
ly; you can carry several pieces with
you and rotate them; or you can pull
the sponge out, wring the blood into
the toilet, reinsert it, and then
wipe your hands off before leaving
the toilet stall. If you decide to
use this last method, be sure there's
a place to rinse your hands off
afterwards since this method is mess-
ier than the others.

Clean your sponge after your month-
ly cycle by rinsing it in clear wa-
ter. Don't use any kind of soap be-
cause it leaves a film and can offset
the natural pH inside your vagina.
Let the sponge air-dry and then store
it away until next month.

Don't be worried if your sponge
turns black during your cycle and
has a strong odor. These are natural
effects since the sponge hasn't been
treated with deodorizers, perfumes,
or other chemicals.

Unbleached sponges last for months
before deteriorating, so they'll
save you money as well as helping
save a few trees.

archal system, which imposed one
husband on a woman but left the man
free to have several wives, would
never have been possible or have
been maintained to this day without
the whole range of cruel and ingen-
ious devices that were used to keep
the woman's sexuality in check.
This is the reason for the implac-
able enmity shown by society towards
female sexuality. The slightest
leniency meant that woman would
break out of the prison bars to
which monogamous marriage had con-
fined her, which would inevitably
lead to confusion in descendancy and
inheritance. Confusion between the
children of the legitimate husband
and an outside lover would mean the
unavoidable collapse of the patri-
archal family built around the name
of the father alone.

History shows us clearly that the
father was keen to know who his real
children were only for the purpose
of handing down his landed property
to them. The patriarchal family
therefore came into existence mainly
for economic reasons. We can safely
say that female circumcision, the
chastity belt and other savage prac-
tices applied to women are basically
the result of the economic interests
that govern society. The continued
existence of such practices in our
own time shows that these economic
interests are still operative. The
thousands of local midwives, nurses,
paramedical staff and doctors that
make money out of female circum-
cision, naturally resist any change
in the values and practices which
are a source of gain to them.

Economic and political factors are
the basis upon which such customs as
female circumcision have grown up.
It has very often been proclaimed
that Islam is at the root of female
circumcision, and is also respon-
sible for the underprivileged and
backward situation of women in Egypt
and Arab countries. This is not
true. If we study Christianity it
is easy to see that this religion
is as rigid and orthodox where women
are concerned as Islam. Neverthe-
less many countries were able to
progress rapidly despite the pro-
ponderance of Christianity as a
religion. This progress was social,
economic, scientific, and also af-
fected the life and position of
women in society.

That is why I firmly believe that
the reason for the low status of women
in our societies, and the lack of
opportunities for progress afforded
to them, are not due to Islam, but
rather to certain economic and pol-
itical forces, namely those of for-
eign imperialism operating mainly
from the outside, and the reaction-
ary classes operating from the
inside.

Ridgeview

by Susan Legrand-Fisher. This course
was originally funded through a
contract between Ridgeview and the
Eagle River-Chugiak Community College.

Due to bureaucratic mismanagement-
or maybe willful choice-the money
was used elsewhere. Ms. Legrand-
Fisher, who turned down a position
elsewhere to teach at Ridgeview, con-
tinued her commitment to the women
in her class with no pay. She is
understandably resentful.

A tangible result of these classes
is the creation of The Inside Review,
a Ridgeview newspaper entirely prod-
uced by the women with the editorial
leadership of Jerry Jo Ludlow, who
says that if it weren't for the two
classes, the newspaper wouldn't have
been possible because the women
couldn't have worked together.

The women want classes funded, and
they want more classes, and they in-
sist that quality instruction will
consistently result when there is
paid staff. State-funded education-
al programs would also be an indic-
ation by Alaska that they see the
rehabilitation of incarcerated women
as worthwhile to society and they
recognize the value of education in
rehabilitation.

Included in the educational fund-
ing is a full-time “institutional
educational instructor" yet to be
hired. Ludlow is disillusioned
about this acquisition, however. He
or she is going to be saddled with
non-instructional duties according
to Bryce Pearson, Ridgeview Director.
The job description includes the
phrase, “other duties as assigned,"
which Pearson indicated would in-
clude transportation duties and
could include anything. Consequent-
ly, services intended to benefit the
women will benefit the administra-
tion. Once again, the women will
suffer neglect.

courses which they wish to pay for
themselves and have been denied per-
mission to do this. Why?

Some women see the non-funding of
Ridgeview programs as discrimination
against women. The possibility that
these missing funds might have been
used somewhere else in the Corrections
system would also indicate that
women's needs in Corrections are a
very low priority. A past example
of this discrimination is seen in
the incident when Ridgeview women
were not being paid their work comp-
ensation. Bob Green is reported to
have told them that no inmates were
being paid at Eagle River or Ridge-
view because of a “cash flow" prob-
lem. The reality of the situation
was that Eagle River inmates were
being paid and Ridgeview women were
not. This is not equal treatment.

Doreen Ransom, Director of Volunt-
eers in Corrections, pointed out that
the purpose of the volunteer program
was not to provide free instructors
to Ridgeview, but to serve as a com-
munications liaison between incarcer-
ated women and the community. This
liaison could provide the community
with the insight that incarcerated
women are human like everyone; and
that, with some community human sup-
port, Ridgeview women could stay out
and function in society.

Said Kalie Miles: "I was released
Last October. I was scared. I knew
no better than before how to cope out
there. Within the six weeks out, I
did everything possible to get back
in. I needed human relating skills
and some transition support from
people out there to make it. I came
back."

Sexist Suit Suit

Legal recourse may be available
soon to women who must wear revealing
and provocative clothing on the job. A
federal district court judge ruled on
June 6th, that Margaret Hasselman,
who suffered repeated and abusive
sexual harassment due to a uniform
requirement, could sue her employer
under Title VII of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act, which prohibits employ-
ment discrimination on the basis of
sex, race, etc. A similar case is
pending in the federal court in De-
troit, MI, where 30 waitresses at
the Metropolitan Airport objected to
their revealing uniforms.

Hasselman, who was employed as a
lobby attendant in a Manhattan office
building managed by Sage Realty Cor-
poration, informed her employers and
supervisors of sexual harassment by
the public, but was summarily fired
when she refused to wear the reveal-
ing poncho which was her uniform. The
National Employment Law Project and
the United States Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission filed suit in
1978 on Ms. Hasselman's behalf, charg-
ing the defendants with sex discrimi-
nation.

The Court found that no male person-
nel were ever required to wear reveal-
ing or provocative uniforms, and that
the uniform had an adverse discrimi-
natory impact on Hasselman's working
conditions. The court's ruling went
on to state that the employer does
not have "the unfettered discretion
under Title VII to require its em-
ployees to wear any type of uniform
the employer chooses, including uni-
forms which may be characterized as
revealing and sexually provocative."

A similar protest was launched two
years ago by 30 women who worked
together at Detroit's Metropolitan
Airport, where they were all requir-
ed to wear a short red dress with a
ruffled petticoat, nylon briefs and
red high-heeled shoes. The women
claimed the outfit subjected them to
sexual harassment. "I felt like a
non-person," recalled Judith Maren-
tette, a 38-year-old grandmother who
has been waiting tables since she
was 15.

For now the class-action suit is
being held up by a challenge from the
employing company, Michigan Host,
Inc. But if this fight, which began
through the union, is anything like
the uniform cases that went before
it, sooner or later it will end up
in the courtroom.

The court is not the only recourse
for working women who object to
their uniforms. In Dennis, MA, two
female employees who voluntarily
quit their jobs in an all-purpose
store rather than conform to a dress
code specifying miniskirts or short
shorts for women took their case to
the Massachusetts Commission Against
Discrimination, where it is pending.
But first they applied for unemploy-
ment compensation, arguing that they
were entitled to the money even
though they quit. Their claim was
first refused but later upheld by an
appeals board that found they had
"good reason" to leave the jobs and
that the reason was “attributable to
the employer."
