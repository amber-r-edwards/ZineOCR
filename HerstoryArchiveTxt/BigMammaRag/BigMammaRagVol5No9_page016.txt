PLEASE SEND money for the legal de-  
fense of the four people arrested in  
Golden, Colorado picketing outside of  
Coors brewery in support of the  
strike currently going on. Two women  
and two men were charged with harass-  
ment, resisting arrest, and trespassing.  
The charges were trumped up; all four  
have been acquitted in a recent trial  
in Golden.

Coors is trying any means it can to  
stop the strike; other people have also  
been arrested and will go on trial in  
December for incidents associated with  
picketing. The people who are arrested  
are the most active strikers and Coali-  
tion members supporting the strike.

Call 321-7467 or 355-8209 for infor-  
mation about when the other trials will  
be happening.

Please make out your check to the  
Legal Fund for the Golden Four and  
send it to the Golden Four c/o Tim  
Lange, 1015 Cook St., Denver, Colorado
