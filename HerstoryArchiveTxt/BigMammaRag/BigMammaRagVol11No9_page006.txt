the Rape-victim Assistance
Funding Team (R.A.F.T.).
R.A.F.T. provides financial
aid to rape victims for "med-

incurred as a result of the

assault." In other words, the
therapists involved with
R.A.F.T., E.V.E. and other

therapists who see rape vic-

themselves and continue
“treating” rape victims who
can't afford to pay them.

Earlier on the same day of
the Take Back the Night March,
a group of approximately 50
women met in City Park. They
met to talk about rape and
fighting back, in response to
a leaflet that had been past-
ed to bank buildings and of-
fices all over downtown, to
store fronts and utility
poles throughout central
Denver. The leaflet called
attention to the fact that a
friend of the leafletters had
been attacked and beaten by
three men, and we as women
needed to do something about
the violence in our lives
and how incredibly angry we
were/are. One of the reasons
for the meeting was to dis-
cuss what do we do, as femi-
nists, with all this anger?

During the meeting, many
women spoke up about their
experiences of being raped
or beaten and their experi-
ences with the cops and the
courts. We talked about our
anger and rage - at the men
who beat up our friend, at
the cops and the courts who
put us through such tremen-
dous harassment if we report
rape, at therapists who try
to diffuse our anger and
channel it into "appropriate"
directions. If we have "too
much" anger, we can be called
"dangerous to self or others,"

“sick slips" from therapists
in order to get time off of
work in order to recover from
a rape. Their own words alone
are not enough.)

When confronted with the
statement that RAAP is making
money off rape, this was em-
phatically denied. But "treat-
ment" after the fact will not
eliminate rape, nor will sin-
gle issue organizing. And as
long as rape exists, RAAP
will be in business. Rape
won't be eradicated until we
all refuse to collaborate in
any way with the exploitative,
oppressive imperialist system
under which we live. As men-
tioned earlier, there are
many ways to fight back -
including self-defense, grass
roots organizing, publicizing
and harassing known rapists,
taking up arms. Single issue
organizing is reformist, and

the universal phrase used to
justify institutionalization.
Alternatives to going
through the legal system
were discussed and explored.
Leafletting was looked on as

will never fundamentally
change anything. Unless and
until RAAP changes its hier-
archical, white, middle-class,
therapy-oriented structure,
it will function, not as a
feminist political project,
as it claims to be; but as a
capitalist business operating
under the guise of feminism.
Feminism is not women making
equal pay for equal work, it
is not being president of the
Women's Bank or the World Bank
or even of the U.S. It is not
becoming "feminist" therapists
or women joining the police
or the army. Feminism is
fighting for true equality
for all people - destroying
all hierarchies - whether of
gender, race, class, physical
attributes, culture, et al.

RAAP and the Take Back the

therapy and ‘the police, are
not isolated incidents. Take
Back the Night Marches have a
history of struggle around
racism and classism - mostly
white, middle-class women
walking down streets in Third
World and/or poor neighbor-
hoods, asking for more police
protection, cooperating with
the police and legal system
in going after men of color.

Women are not the dependent,
passive, weak creatures which
society would have us be. Wo-
men are fighting all over the
world - in El Salvador, Puerto
Rico, Namibia, Azania and
right here in the good old
U.S. of A. - for their liber-
ation from economic and male
violence.

Women are taking up arms,
learning self-defense, leaf-

where a group of women in
Texas went through police
files to compile a list of
rapists, which they then
published. This was a cele-
brated action at first, but
was then looked at in another
light. It goes back again to
which rapists the cops go
after, which is Third World
and/or poor men. So publish-
ing lists the cops have is
skewed in that direction -
therefore racist. We need to
publicize and expose rapists
we do know about, but not use
the police in any way.
Various retaliatory and
offensive actions were dis-
cussed - confrontation of
known rapists by a group of
women, carrying a knife or
gun, learning self-defense.
Out of the meeting two classes
are going to be set up - one
for women to learn how to use
a gun, another, for women to
learn how to use a knife. Call
Herizons Bookstore for infor-
mation on these classes,
which should be happening
toward the end of October.
This meeting was organized
totally outside of the "sys-
tem." A group of angry women
made up a leaflet, posted it
as widely as possible and
got 50 women together for a
meeting to talk about and
come up with alternatives
dealing within the system.
