Women's Health Packet

Sisters,

In your news briefs in the April
issue, you have some information about
the danger of tampons and credit the
information to The Women's Health
Packet.

Could you let me know where/how I
could get this packet? As distributors
of menstrual sponges, this type of in-
formation is often requested of us and
the more information we have, the more

complete our answers can be.
Thank you in advance.

In struggle,

Kath Quinn

Editors’ Note: The Women's Health Pac-
ket is available from the Women's
Health Center, 639 Massachusetts Ave,
Room 210, Cambridge, MA 02139. The
information concerning tampons was in
Health Packet #20.

Omission In Socialist Feminist Article

Dear Mama,

Thank you for printing our series of
articles on living your socialist fem-
inism. I am still cringing in horror
over the error in the most recent ar-
ticle, concerning sexuality and rela-
tionships. In the last paragraph, which
tries to examine some of the contradic-
tions or questions we felt it important
to raise about feminists relating to
men, a line was omitted. It should have
read:

We also have to look very care-
fully at what it means for a
woman to recognize that men op-
press her, yet to still be
attracted to them. Is she attra-
cted to qualities that are also
used to oppress her? To quali-
ties they possess simply by
virtue of their male privilege?
If so, what does this mean in
terms of her own identity and
self-image as a woman, and equal-
ly important, her respect and
regard for her sisters?

Omitting the part here in script, as

you did, drastically changes the mean-
ing. As it was written, it is a crucial
point. I feel Lesbianism is more than
just a personal choice or a civil
rights issue or even a source of our
pride and strength and support. It is
all those things. It is also related in
a very basic way to our understanding,
maybe on an unconscious level, of the
dynamics between men and women, an un-
derstanding that permeates every facet
of the way we live. My struggles with
my straight sisters in our collective
and elsewhere around this issue have
been invaluable to my own growth and
maybe to theirs. It's sometimes been a
sensitive issue -- in such situations
inadequate proofreading can wreak
havoc!

I'm (as always) a devoted reader and
am often amazed at the fine quality of
BMR; I realize you work under lots of
pressures and deadlines. Keep cranking
them out!

In sisterhood,
Louise Knapp

Status Of Boycott

Dear Big Mama Rag,

Some time last year I read something
in your paper about a boycott of Cele-
stial Seasonings because they were
using an herb from South Africa in
their Emperor's Choice tea.

I'm trying to find out what happened.
Was there a boycott of Celestial Sea-
sonings, is there one now, and do you
know if they are still getting the
herb from South Africa?

I'd appreciate any information you
have about this.

Sincerely,
Phyllis Rutherford

Editors' Note: The boycott is over.

The boycott existed for a short time
until Celestial Seasonings stated it
would go elsewhere for the particular
herb they were using from South Africa.

Blind Lesbians

Dear Women who run women's newspapers,
We have been reading aloud onto
tapes parts of your paper, but we are
just two old women in a cabin and we
need some help. Three blind lesbians
have written to me. They say that ra-
dical lesbian and radical feminist
books and newspapers and magazines are
not available to them. Women tell me,
when I try to tell them about the
blind women, that there is a GAY AND
LESBIAN BLIND LIBRARY in New York City.
Eileen and I went there. There are 3
lesbian members and some gay men. They
have three (3) books on tapes. They
have "Our Right To Love" and 2 other
books. They need books, readers, tapes,
money. That's G & L Blind, Suite 502,
110 East 23rd Street, NY 10010. Other
women say, get a lesbian librarian to
help you pressure the Library of Con-
gress to make lesbian and feminist
books available to blind women. Well,
I don't know a lesbian librarian and
besides, it's going to take more than
me to make this thing happen. We are
reading books, too, but we have run
out of tapes and money. We need some-
body to make free copies of the tapes.
They say, write to Bella Absug. Bella,
are you listening to me?
