Assata Shakur Escapes

On November 2, 1979 Assata Shakur  
(Joanne Chesimard), a Black Liberation  
Army member, escaped from a  
prison in Clinton, New York where  
she had been incarcerated for 6½  
years of her life plus a 65-year  
sentence.

Shakur was arrested in 1973 in a  
“shoot-out" attack by New Jersey State  
troopers. Zayd Shakur, another former  
member of the Black Panther Party  
was killed during this attack along  
with one of the state troopers. At  
the time of her arrest, Shakur was  
being sought as a fugitive under  
six indictments. Although government  
officials failed to obtain even  
one conviction on any of the six  
charges, Shakur was eventually sentenced  
to life imprisonment plus 65  
years for the shoot-out where she  
was arrested. It appears that she  
was sentenced for nothing more than  
being present at her own arrest and  
the gunfire that accompanied it  
even though medical evidence confirmed  
that she had been shot while  
holding her hands above her head.  
Another black activist, Sundiata  
Acoli, who was also arrested in  
the incident, also received a life  
sentence and remains in prison.

The African National Prison  
Organization (ANPO) and the National  
Committee to Defend Dessie Woods

The organizers of Lesbians, Colorado  
Our First Gathering released their  
post-conference report at a Thank-you  
party held on December 1 at the St.  
Francis Interfaith Center on the  
Auraria Campus. The organizing committee's  
purpose in organizing the conference  
was to find ways of identifying  
Colorado lesbians in order to  
learn "who we are, where we live, what  
we do, and what interests and needs we  
have in our community."

Of the women registered for the conference,  
61% live in Denver, 20% from  
northeastern Colorado (Greeley, Fort  
Collins, Longmont, Broomfield, Boulder,  
and outlying areas), 13% from  
mountain areas, and 6% from southeastern  
Colorado.

The registration fee for the conference  
was on a sliding scale as to how  
much each woman felt she could afford.  
Of those registering for the conference,  
7% paid the full $25, 43% paid  
$15, 42% paid $5, 4% were sponsored,  
and another 4% paid varying amounts  
for registration.

A total of 550 questionnaires were  
distributed at the conference that  
was attended by 619 women. Of these,  
251 were returned. Two of these were  
eliminated because they were incomplete  
and another 11 were eliminated because  
they were completed by women not living  
in Colorado. The majority of the women  
responding to the questionnaire were  
white, from the Denver metro area,  
between 22 and 29, and well-educated.

for women  
5% had been to a home for battered  
or abused women  

Seventy percent said that there were  
social activities that they would like  
to participate in but were not available.  
The most frequently mentioned  
were a coffee house/restaurant which  
would provide an alternative to the  
bar environment, various support  
groups, sports-outdoors-fitness  
groups, and the opportunity for  
more political and/or intellectual  
discussions and activities. (A more  
extensive analysis of the questionnaire  
is available through the office of  
Lesbians, Colorado, 1553 High Street  
#4, P.O. Box 18767, Denver, CO 80218.  
Their phone number is 355-3732.)

There were more than 55 workshops  
at the conference. Out of these  
workshops, the following ongoing  
groups were formed: Battered Lesbians  
Network, Colorado Women's Land Trust,  
Cultural Productions Network, Expressive  
Arts Therapy, Feminist Writer's Guild,  
Health/Ecology, Lavender and Old Lace  
(on aging and ageism), Lesbian  
Artists Network, Lesbian Media Action  
Network, Lesbian Mother's Support Group,  
Colorado Mountain Women, National  
Organizations, Playwrights,  

have stated their total support and  
solidarity with the recent liberation  
of Assata Shakur. ANPO calls on  
“all blacks and freedom-loving  
peoples to take an active stand in  
militant support of Assata and all  
political prisoners and prisoners  
of war." ANPO is initiating a  
"Hands Off Assata" campaign to  
“support Assata and demand that the  
U.S. government keep its hands off  
this courageous African freedom  
fighter."

Those in support of Assata Shakur  
are asked to escalate their militant  
support and put up signs saying  
"Assata Is Welcome Here,” as well  
as to continue to struggle against  
the “use of prisoners by the U.S.  
government as an instrument of  
colonial terror against black  
people, especially African freedom  
fighters.

The conference committee was able  
to raise over $14,000 through grants,  
donations, registration fees, and  
loans. It cost over $12,000  
for the conference. There are still  
outstanding bills to be paid, but  
the remainder of the money will be  
used as seed money for an activity  
or activities that are involved in  
outreach or networking functions.

Sexual Assault  
in Arvada

A 31-year-old Arvada, Colorado  
woman was kidnapped at gunpoint from  
the Arvada Public Library, West 57th  
Avenue and Dover Street, and driven  
to the Frisco area where she was sexually  
assaulted and then released.  
The suspect was described as a 25-30-  
year-old white male with blondish-  
brown, wavy, collar-length hair and  
a beard that is somewhat darker in  
color. The man seemed to be familiar  
with the Frisco area. He was last  
seen driving a late-model blue pickup  
truck with a white camper shell and  
out-of-state license plates with  
blue lettering on a white background.  
Anyone seeing the attacker or the  
truck is asked to call the Arvada  
police.

After the woman was sexually assaulted,  
her attacker left her outside Frisco  
where she had to walk some distance  
to find a telephone to call for  
help. The kidnapping occurred  
at 11:30 a.m. on a Thursday in late  
November. Authorities claim that the  
woman was “released unharmed."

We assert that ALL women who are  
sexually assaulted or raped have been  
“harmed."

Organizing

Against the Klan

Several area feminists are organizing  
as a response to the recent  
activities of the Ku Klux Klan which  
have included the killing of four  
blacks, nationwide organizing against  
blacks and other minorities, harassment  
of gays, and oppression of  
women.

The Klan was first organized as a  
secret society to oppress and harass  
blacks in the South after the Civil  
War in 1865. In recent years the  
Ku Klux Klan has also identified  
Jewish people, Chicanos, homosexuals  
and “pot smokers" as targets of their  
aggression.

It is felt that organizing a visible  
protest against the Ku Klux Klan  
is very important at this time. Any  
one interested in working to organize  
this protest is asked to call 831-  
4419, 377-5193, or 8-8678 for more  
information.

Any feminists interested in discussing  
the issue of class in the women's  
community are invited to a discussion  
on Wednesday, December 19th  
at 7:30 p.m. at 3904 E.  
at 377-5193 or Lori at 388-3678.
