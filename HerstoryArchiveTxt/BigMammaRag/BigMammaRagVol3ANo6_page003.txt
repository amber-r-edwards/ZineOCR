Letters Home To Mama

Robin Morgan

Dear BMR:

I'm writing to clarify a few
confusions which may have
arisen from your coverage of my
appearance in Colorado Springs
(BMR May 1975). First, I want to
express my gratitude to Shirl
Kasper, who wrote the article,
and to all of you on BMRA, for the
careful, responsible tone of the
coverage, and for printing it. My
quibbles are minor ones, which
are due mainly to a few
typographical errors, or maybe
to the understandable garble of a
tape of the speech, from which
Shirl probably drew her quotes,
or to scribbled notes taken
hurriedly during the talk itself.
Having worked on a women’s
newspaper myself I am, believe
me, well aware of the chronic
crises that one faces — so I hope
you'll understand these correc-
tions in the solely clarifying
manner in which I mean them.

1) I haven't called the Feminist
Movement “Women’s Lib” for a
good five or six years, since I
think the diminutive nickname
for our struggle to free and save
humanity is trivialized by such a
frivolous, humorous title.

2) In my talk, I referred to the
NBFO (National Black Feminist
Organization) and the Native
American Feminist Federation
as vitally important new groups
in the Women’s Movement.
These appeared as the ‘National
Black Women’s Organization”
and the ‘Native American
Federation’; in both cases, the
key word — Feminist — was
missing. And we all know how
special a word that is!

3) I believe I said that
heterosexual women (not
heterosexuals of any old gender)
were now beginning, out of
feminist consciousness, to de-
mand relationships with men on
their own (women’s) terms.
Heterosexuals in general, per se,
have obviously held cultural
power over people of any other
sexual persuasion, and
heterosexual men demanding
anything makes me want to
throw up. My point was that
women of all sexual persuasions
have begun to redefine
ourselves in terms of our own
desires and demands, and that
includes virgins, women who
choose to live and struggle with
men, temporary or permanent
celibate women, bisexual
women, and lesbian women
affirming self- and sister-love.

4) In talking about power, and
differentiating the way I see
power in a feminist context from
power in a patriarchal one, I said
that I did not mean power “that
has the invisible word ‘over’
attached to it” as it does under
patriarchy. “Over” was printed
as “overt” — an understandable
typo, but one which converted
the sentence into meaning
something else. I, for one, want
women to have “overt” power —
right out there where everyone
can see it. But I do think that our
feminist vision is concerned
with the power to effect change,
not with power over others, as
males have used it.

5) My last nit-pick, I swear: the
article quotes me as saying that
“women are equal bearers in
existential courage...” when I
actually was paraphrasing a
brilliant and moving statement
Mary Daly makes repeatedly in
her fine book Beyond God The
Father. I believe I said that
“women are at this point in
history uniquely the bearers of
existential courage — because
for the immensity and profundity
of our vision and our task
there are no models; we step
off into a space that has not
existed before.”

After all my carping, I want to
say how grateful I am for the 99%
accuracy of the reporting, and to
let you know how superb BMR in
general is. The paper just gets
better every issue, and I con-
gratulate each sister who makes
that a reality. I’m proud to be a
subscriber, and I “plug” the
paper everywhere I go. As only
one example out of many, the
courageous, truly responsible,
fact-filled, and objectively fair
coverage you have done on Jane
Alpert should set an example for
all women’s media. If there were
a Feminist Pulitzer Prize for
original investigative unpanicky
political reporting, Linda Fowler
would be my candidate any old
time.

Keep up the beautiful and vital
work; you’re the Mama of us all.

In sisterhood,
Robin Morgan

ED. NOTE: Mis-statements in
the article were, indeed, due to a
bad tape, from which much
information was taken. BMR
apologizes for any and all mis-
representations of Robin's
words. Thanks for letting us
know, Robin.

Open Letter To
Jane Alpert

Dear Jane,

I've been meaning to write to
you for some time and will put it
off no longer for I think you need
all the friends you can get now
and I want to be counted among
them. Though we've never met, I
feel very closely identified with
you and the position you are now
in. Without the same noise and
public attention but with some of
the anger and recriminations, I
also walked away, but I walked
away from the old left. I under-
stand the confusion and pain you
must feel under the present
attacks and for whatever it is
worth, I want you to know that I
admire your courage and I want
to tell you why.

To my way of thinking, the
anger directed at you has little to
do with the charge of “collabora-
tion,” for collaboration by left
leaders is an old, accepted,
often-used strategy, as, for ex-
ample, the Soviet-Nazi pact; and
we can be certain that Nixon did
not go to China to watch a ping-
pong game. And as for the
charge of “informer,” a quick
study of the statements at-
tacking you reveals a greater
attempt to protect a
revolutionary ideal than concern
for endangered fugitives. The
fact is that the left is so riddled
with informers that one can
scarcely identify them from the
real revolutionaries. The SLA,
for example, Timothy Leary,
Barry Stein, and it was, after all,
“Prince” George Demmerle,
informer and provocateur,
(whom no one seems to men-
tion), well integrated into your
group, who turned you in.

No, informing is not the issue,
but by leaving the left and stating
why you have struck a mortal
blow at its credibility: you have
had the audacity to claim that
women’s work is more signifi-
cant for meaningful change than
the empty cause and rhetoric to
which they are committed. One
can hardly blame them for their
outcries, for unless they turn
about face and join you, they are
forever committed to justify, as
you have said, “the dying left.”
Essentially the issue comes to
this: whether sexism is a side
effect of the evil capitalistic
system or whether the system is
the product of a more fundamen-
tal evil — sexism. If the latter is
true, and I think it is, then
women must deal specifically
with how they wish to change
their relationships with men and
each other, in and out of in-
stitutions, as a prime priority.
As feminist Leah Fritz said: “It
is clear that the most well
meaning male theorists have
been unable to see beyond their
own noses or, to put it bluntly,
