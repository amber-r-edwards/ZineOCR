“Oppose The Police, Don't Join Them!”:  

Women Against Police Terror  

"One thing you must under-  
stand: the reason the police  
force gives you a gun, the  
reason we give you mace, a  
baton, and a badge, is because  
you are going to have to use  
them!" These were the words  

resistance  

of San Francisco Police Chief  
Cornelius Murphy, addressing  
an orientation session for  
women interested in joining  
the San Francisco Police  
Department, part of the De-  
partment's drive to recruit  
400 more women onto the force.  
At that moment, a group of  
women rushed down to the  
speaker's podium, chanting,  
"Connie Murphy, you can't  
hide, we charge you with geno-  
cide!" and unfurling a 15-  
foot banner that read, "Women,  
don't join the police! We  
don't want equal rights to  
become killer cops!" While  
Police Chief Murphy stood there  
gaping, the Women's Committee  
Against Police Terror took  
over the orientation session,  
rapping with the assembled  
women about why not to join

the police, and distributing  
a leaflet to every woman.  

"Connie Murphy tells us  
that we can make $1700 a  
month if we join the police,  
and the police ads and bill-  
boards say that police work  
is an exciting and challenging  
profession. Some people say  
we can humanize the police  

by joining and make a con-  
tribution to ending the vio-  
lence that surrounds us every-  
where. But the reality is  
more like Murphy just said --  
they give you a gun because  
you're expected to use it! And  
who will we be called upon to  
turn our guns against?  

"Eula May Love, a Black  
mother, was shot nine times,  
murdered by the Los Angeles  
Police Department because she  
tried to prevent her gas from  
being turned off. And just  
yesterday, another unarmed  
Black man was killed in Oak-  
land, shot by a policeman  
with a .357 magnum because  
he had "something shiny" in  
his pocket. These are not iso-  
lated incidents! Over the last  
five years, police across the  
US have killed over 2000  
Third World people. The po-  
lice exist to keep the lid  

on Third World peoples’  
just struggles! Our libera-  
tion as women has nothing  
whatsoever to do with equal  
rights to participate in all  
this!"  

The spokeswoman continued:  

"Why would we want to join  

a police force that beat up  
Sue and Shirley and many other  
lesbians? Why would we want  

to protect a system that can't  
even bring itself to pass the  
ERA; that threatens us with

stepped-up surveillance  
and increased invasion of  
privacy of any who threaten  

the Reagan regime and all it suddenly I don’t  
stands for. And meanwhile back feel like Jancina,  
at the WHITE Ranch, Alexander Haig  

ruffled a few feathers as he unveiled his plans to take  
control - just another way of letting the world know  
what American democracy is all about anyway. Some stat-  
istics for the month: one third of the proposed  

$44 billion budget cuts come from only two areas:  
health and security, programs that are largely  
geared to meet the needs of the poor (women comprise 60%  
of the poor, and 70% of the elderly poor). And as Reagan  
throws out the Bilingual Education program, we learn that  
this will effectively shut out 3.5 million children whose  
basic language is not English. And if all this is too  
much to handle, we can always escape into space as two  
American astronauts did this month. The rest of us back  
on earth are well aware that the defense department is  
again eyeing the space program as a new means to an  
old end: universal imperialism. But then, we all know  
that this much suffering cannot be contained on one plan-  
et, don't we?

Its parent company SmithKline  
Inc., is based in Philadel-  
phia, Pennsylvania; other of-  
fices and plants are located  
in Canada, Europe, Latin Am-  
erica and the Far East. Smith  
Kline makes numerous medical  
and cosmetic products, inclu-  
ding many "mental health"  
products, including many  
heavy, brain-damaging psychia-  
tric drugs such as Thorazine,  
Stelazine, Compazine and other  
tranquilizers.  

SK has made a fortune sell-  
ing its prescription and over  
the counter drugs. In 1973  
its drug sales totaled $789  
million, or 70% of all sales.  
In 1979, drug sales skyrock-  
eted to roughly $993 million.  
And during the past five  
years drug sales more than  
doubled (about a 150% in-  
crease).  

Included in these figures  

Compazine are dangerous,  
brain damaging drugs which  
have many serious side-ef-  
fects. Despite the fact that  
SKF knew as far back as the  
early 1960s that Thorazine  
and other phenothiazines  
caused tardive dyskinesia, a  
serious and permanent disor-  
der of the central nervous  
system, they waited until  
1972 before informing Physi-  
cians about T.D. It's obvious  
that SmithKline is committed  
to profits not people, which  
mocks their pretense of being  
a “good corporate citizen.”  
And SKF knows, or should  
know, that its psychiatric  
"miracle drugs" are rou-  
tinely forced upon psychi-  
atric inmates against  
their will and without  
their informed consent.  
Furthermore, SK contri-

murder charges if we get an  
abortion; that imprisons us  
for defending ourselves from  
physical violence? Women who  
care about people and want to  
see this system change should  
be opposing the police, not  
joining them."  

One of the potential re-  
cruits yelled out: "If you  
don't like how the police act,  
then join the force and help  
to change it!" Sheila Parker  
from the Women's Committee  
replied, "In Los Angeles just  
recently, a woman sheriff  
killed a Latino father and  
wounded his three-year-old  
son. It's no comfort to his  
family that he was killed  
with a woman's touch!" After  
several more minutes of  
discussion, the protestors  
decided they had accomplished  
their purpose and marched out  
chanting.  

Similar efforts to militar-  
ize women are happening around  
the country, and are also  
running into opposition from  
women. In Los Angeles, follow-  
ing a court order that the  
police had to bring itself  
up to 20% women, the Los An-  
geles Police Department  
launched a major recruitment  
drive. The Evans Weinberg ad-  
vertising company volunteered  
to mount an extensive ad  
campaign, and soon Los Angeles  
residents were assaulted with  
a constant stream of radio  
commercials and billboards  
urging women to "Take Command  
of Your Future -- Join the  
LAPD." A coalition of women  
organized itself to oppose  
this blatant attempt to iden-  
tify women's struggle for  
liberation with a police de-  
partment that murders a  
Black or Latino person nearly  
every week. At a militant  
demonstration at the offices  
of Evans Weisberg, the women  
stated that "It is an outrage  
that the advertising industry,  
notorious for its objectifi-  
cation and degradation of wo-  
men, would now try to sell us  
on this distorted version of  
women's liberation. We will  
never find freedom by join-  
ing with a system that has  
a cowboy as president, where  
spies are heroes, and where  
Hustler and Playboy outsell  
Time and Newsweek. Under this  
imperialist system, violence  
against women is as American  
as apple pie.”  

The Women's Committee  

Against Police Terror sees  
the move to militarize women  
in the context of the increas-  
ingly aggressive US posture  
around the world. "As the US  
moves in a more and more  
reactionary direction, it  
can't tolerate a movement  
fighting for real power and  
liberation for women. So  

we see an escalation of viol-  
ence against women with nine  
major movies coming out  

this year like Dressed to  
Kill, that show strong inde-  
pendent women being mutilated  

and murdered. At the same time  
movies and TV shows like Pri-  
vate Benjamin come out with  
the message that women can  
escape our oppression by be-  
coming junior partners in  
this oppressive system. It's  
critical that we make it clear  
that women have something else  
in mind, that in fact we're  
fighting on the side of Third  
World people from El Salvador  
to Puerto Rico who are lead-  
ing in overturning this sys-  
tem! We're organizing in  
solidarity with the Black  

people of Miami, who rose up  
when police were acquitted of  
raping a 13-year-old girl and  
murdering Arthur McDuffie.  
We're in solidarity with the  
Black people of Atlanta, who  
are being arrested by the  
police for the 'crime' of run-  
ning armed community defense  
patrols.

In May 1977, Janice Paint-  
er, disabled mother of four,  
was convicted of first degree  
murder and sentenced to life  
imprisonment for the crime  
of self-defense. She served  
18 months in prison at Purdy  
before she was released on  
$25,000 bail, pending the  
appeal of her conviction.  

Janice Painter was convicted  

of the most serious crime in  
our society - premeditated  
murder - because she planned  
to defend herself and her  

the prosecutor will make the  
decision whether to file new  
charges, or allow her to go  
free.  

Claudia Thacker: A French-  
born service wife, she shot  
and killed her husband Ken-  
neth when he attacked her  
daughter in a drunken rage.  
In spite of a 20-year his-  
tory of battering, she was  
found guilty of murder in  
1977. Her conviction was re-  
versed by the Supreme Court;  
she was recharged and will  
go on trial in Port Orchard  
on April 1, 1981.  

Dorothy Savage: A battered  
wife for 17 years, she shot  
her husband when he attacked  
her in her home following a  
drinking bout. She was found  
guilty of murder in 1977.  

Her conviction was overturned  

in 1980, and she has been  
recharged. She will go on  
trial in Tacoma April 27, 1981.  

Sherry Allery: After 5 years  
of abuse, she filed for di-  
vorce and had two criminal  
restraining orders filed  
against her husband. In  
spite of this, she was charged  
with murder after she was  
forced to defend herself when  
he attacked her in her home.  
She will go on trial in Tacoma  
on May 4, 1981.  

Viola Dangerfield: A  
disabled Black woman, she  
was kidnapped from her home  
in Seattle at gunpoint by her  
former boyfriend. Forced to  
drive to Tacoma, she tried  
to get away from him, and  
he was killed. She has been  
charged with murder and will  
go on trial in Tacoma some-  
time in May - no trial date  
has been set at this writing.
