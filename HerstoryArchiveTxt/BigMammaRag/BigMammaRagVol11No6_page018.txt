process of being established
by a German/Italian women's
cooperative, La Cooperative
Sociale Casa Balena. Not only
a meeting place for women from
all countries both inside and
outside Europe, but also a
cultural center for Italian
women from the immediate area.
The basic principle of the
project is the combination of
intellectual and physical la-
bour, of thought and feeling,
of political activism and our
own sensual perceptions. The
international aspect of the
project is important to us,

forms of resistance. Summer
