Women’s Work Is Never Done.

Censtance Perenyi

When I first focused on the issue
of women and work, I surprised my-
self. My reaction has been really
emotional; I am suddenly aware of
the anger and frustration I've sat
on for years.

What I want to be when I grow up...
I sit, I am grown up...what did I
want to be?...the reality of it all
has faded the fantasies. What's a
nice bright girl like you doing in
a place like this? Nobody ever, ever
told me it would be like this...you
want, so you reach...simple, American
dream...we need more like you...
sweet, nice girl...I am a woman who
wants more than anything right now

to blow up a building...I always feel
this way when things move in slow
motion...

An all-consuming job in which I
could be truly effective as a radi-
cal feminist. It is vital that I
have as much time and energy as
possible to give a commitment like
Big Mama Rag - and so, I have opted
out of a more glamorous, respected
job market and stayed in what, on
the surface, seems to be a less de-
manding role.

There are no simple solutions...
sometimes, there are no solutions

at all. Women's work...interruption...
change the baby...answer the
phone...be polite, smile, be every-
body's mother and everybody's fa-
vorite, good, good daughter...reach...
pre-feminism 101: women have rights
to equal pay, for, for what? I for-
got...I've really forgotten what

it is I'm supposed to be paid equali-
ty for...my dreams they are as emp-
ty, as...funny how I type
when I'm typing for myself...did

and if I am good at what I do,

I will be invisible...

Growing up in white middle-class
America, I always assumed that what

I wanted was in reach. I never really
thought about what my life in the
real world would be like because no-
one ever talked about the real world
anyway. Nor did I have many role mod-
els for working women, except for

the teachers and secretaries at
school. Oh yes, and my aunt, who was
a highly rated secretary for the go-
vernment. I remember seeing a photo-
graph of her perched on a general's
desk, holding his hat, with a when-
the-cat's-away-the-mouse-does-play
expression mimeographed with des-
peration in her eyes. I remember feel-
ing sick to my stomach.

I also remember the summer job I had
after my first year in architecture
school. I worked as a secretary for
two architects who rarely let me in-
to the drafting room for the on-the-
job experience I had been promised.
My last day there, one of them crack-
ed, “Well, if you don't make it as
an architect, at least you'll make
someone a good secretary.” It con-
firmed my worst fear that I was still
expected to make myself into some-
thing for someone...if I wasn't
going to be somebody's good little
wife, at least I'd be their good
little secretary.

Secretary - the word is cold and
hissing like dry ice...secretary-
hair curlers, lavender eye shadow,
short skirts and fast fingers...I
wear cut-offs to work, prop my feet
on my desk, don't even type very
well...hence, I am not a secretary...
but I do take a hell of a message
and am sickeningly polite on the
phone...therefore, I am a secretary
we think, therefore I ain't... I
want to explode a fine bomb...
want to write a good analysis of
what it means to have grown up be-
lieving and then suddenly be doing...
everyone else's work, that is.

Somewhere along the way in my educ-
ation, I realized that what I was
learning had little to do with me;
but only now am I understanding the
extent of the rip-off. All the years
of education, and all the promises -
and then, I find that for some jobs
I am overqualified, while for others
I still have not had enough school-
ing. If I went back for another
degree, I would be even further away
from what I sense to be reality,
and certainly, from my own evolving
reality as a feminist. I have con-
sciously chosen jobs that do not
require "further qualifications” be-
cause 1) I do not want to invest the
resources in getting another piece
of paper, and 2) I can't conceive of

é mention loneliness? what?...I mean
hours alone, in the library, in the
bedroom, in the kitchen...in the
office...strangers on the phone...
alone with the phone and the type-
writer, instrument of torture...

I strive to correct typographical
errors...I die to make them, and I
could care less...and I care less,
each day...

The first time I looked at "trad-
itional women's work" I saw that we
were never allowed to focus on one
thing at a time. Whether we are mo-
thers doing a hundred things at once,
or waitresses balancing a tray and
a check at the same time, or secre-
taries holding the telephone to one
ear and a dictaphone to the other,
the fact is that there is never a
complete job description for the
jobs we do. In every interview I've
had, I've sold myself because I am
“flexible”, and oh, is that an ap-
pealing selling point. It means that
not only can I handle anything that
comes up, but that I can do it with-
out blinking and losing a moment of
efficiency. It means that I can smile
in the face of all adversity and op-
pression; and if I am good at what
I do, I will be invisible. I can,
in my unobtrusive manner, keep ev-
erything running smoothly, and no one
will ever have to know what it is
that I do. And I, for a reason
that I am only now beginning to
grasp, really don't know what it is
that other women in similar roles
do either.

The reason is, of course, that
women who do the same things, yet
such different things, are effectively
isolated from each other's exper-
ience, and are bound to have diffi-
culties in organizing around spec-
ific issues. Furthermore, many
offices have few secretaries and
clerical workers (yet many higher-
ups to whom they must answer);
consequently, there is not much of
a support system for women in these
positions. I had no idea of the
depth of my discontent until I start-
ed to talk with other women "support-
workers" - I really thought that I
was alone.

I used to wait for a report card...
you're doing fine kid, just fine...
Q+...0...0-...you’re failing life,
but you're doing fine here...now,
At? 5 "C please do this...” on "C
that needs to be done..." I'm gone
for a day, for two days, for a week,
forever, and the little notes pile
up on my desk like so many tugs

on my sleeve...sometimes it takes
as long to write one of those little
notes as it would to do the task
itself...and sometimes, it would
take my whole life to comply...

I know why it is so hard for women
to learn to respect ourselves, and
why for so long I've been uncom-
fortable about my jobs. In a typical
day, I never finish what I start...

I can't because I am, and here is
the golden adjective, again, flexi-
ble. If I take time to order my
priorities, I inevitably abandon the
list because someone has something
more important for me to do. I re-
sent the "We need to get this out”
when it means that I, and usually

I alone, am responsible for it.

I am not only unfocused, but un-
fulfilled because I never see the end
of what I am doing. I've spent a
lot of energy in self-hate for not
being able to order my life, my
time, and now, I realize that it is
not my fault.

The system has a stake in keeping
my work incomplete, my mind unclear,
my energies divided.

In my past life, I was a transpor-
tation clerk...and in the life be-
fore that I was a waitress...and it
always seems that I've been some
one's secretary...only this time it
was supposed to be different, more
integrated because I was doing some-
thing important...IM-POR-TANT...

Type letters, answer the phone...a
support worker in an important move-
ment...why if it's all so goddamned
important does it feel so fucking
insignificant?...the phone rings
sometimes when I'm in the bathroom,
and if nobody else answers it, I
can't get my pants buttoned fast
enough to stop its insistent ring-
ing...and I am angry because I
expected more, whatever that means...
or is it just because I'm still a
shitworker who, somehow has learned
to adjust? Fewer compromises, I say

to myself...and granted, the desk
procedure I amended a little
everyday, more to do, less to be paid
for...but I was hired to do this...
it needs to be done...someone has to
do it sometime...so why am I doing
it at all?

Last fall, after three lean but
satisfying months of unemployment
and art-making, I applied for a job

as, and I still grit my teeth when I
say it, a secretary - a support work-
er in an anti-nuclear project. I got
the job because I am, well, flexible-
and in many ways, I have proven my-
self to be invaluable. I lived
through the taxing months of prepar-
ation for a major rally and I've ad-
justed somewhat to working for three
women with wholly different needs.

I am out as a lesbian and an active
feminist, and in many ways have an
ideal, almost enviable job.

Only lately, it has not seemed so
ideal. I am angry that I can't seem
to say "no" when I can't, or don't
want to do something. I now feel a
different kind of responsibility to
both the movement and the women I
work for, and so I hatch my anger
inside like a rotten egg, and try to
do the work. Mostly, I am angry that
this job is in some ways no different
than any I've had before; and in o-
ther ways, it is even more taxing.

Sometimes when the phone interr-
upts me, or when I come back from
time-off and realize that no one has
kept up with what needs doing, I
see myself clearly as a woman who
needs more definition in her job. My
flexibility is repaid in part by
the flexibility in hours and envir-
onment - I don't have to punch a time
clock, and the office is casual. But
then, I never really finish anything
I start either. And I never know
what comes next, or what will be
waiting for me on my desk when I
come in on Monday morning.

I have many questions and few ans-
wers right now. Women need to be
affirmed for being in support posi-
tions, but knowing that, and in small
measure saying it to each other, is
not enough. Until there are major
changes in the system, that kind of
affirmation is merely a stop-gap
measure. We need to talk with each
other, share our feelings - and then
start making specific demands. That
is undoubtedly threatening to our
supervisors because, in large mea-
sure, it is our very flexibility
that keeps things going. Without us,
the system would fold...

And in that realization is the
first power that many of us have
known.

The prearranged signal

I have a vision
of all the women

who work in all of the offices

downtown

one day standing up

by some prearranged signal
all at the same time

with machine guns pulled out of their desk drawers
and blasting away right and left

aiming at every business suit

I have a vision of this
Running from room to room

with guns held tightly against bodies
fighting swiftly with no awkwardness
women's anger breaking loose

by prearranged signal

(these we have to learn)

I'm speaking to you about anger.

I have a knowledge

of all the women

who work in all the offices

downtown

going to work every day

with bowed minds

and the latest fashions

how could we have ever come to believe in that?
Past the porno shops selling bodies and hate
Past the men who stare and think that it's their right,
I have a knowledge of this

buildings full of women

all doing the same shit work -

for the MAN

coming together at lunch

but never really coming together

women's sadness being hidden

I'm speaking to you about grief/hate.
