Continental Editions is a mother-  
daughter team that formed when Ms.  
Ririhberg's translation of Edith  
Thomas' work was rejected by the  
straight publishers. So they formed  
their own company and printed the mother’s book.  

They have done an excellent job of  
it. The book is a very nice looking,  
very quiet package. Reviewers hesi-  
tate to use the word, but the book is  
tasteful. It's an impressive first  
attempt.  

The writing is well done, too.  
Edith Thomas is an award-winning  
French historian, according to the  
publisher's blurb, her main emphasis  
being women and the silences surroun-  
ding their contributions to events in  
the world. This particular book is a  
collection of stories about biblical  
women - Eve, Mary the Virgin, Mary  
Magdalene, the Adulterous Woman, and  
the Others.  

Some of the stories are very touch-  
ing in their humanizing of women in  
the stories and their portrayal of  
almost universal loneliness in their  
lives. Mary the Virgin is really a  
woman who left home to discover the  
truth and learn the world - unlike  
her peers, who all married. She comes  
home discouraged and disillusioned,  
knowing that there is no knowledge,  
there is no truth. Upon returning,  
she is an outcast and a loose woman.  

She takes residence in her dead  
parents' old home and gradually be-  
comes known as a healer, leading a  
lonely existence as crowds of people  
besiege her home. She begins wander-

Woman on the Edge of Time

Paula Wallace  

As a science fiction fan, I was  
surprised to find a selection by Mar-  
ge Piercy in a new sf anthology,  
Aurora: Beyond Equality (Fawcett Gold  
Medal, 1976). On reading the story,  
excerpted from Woman on the Edge of  
Time, I was captivated by the andro-  
gynous society she has created, so  
warm and humanistic and sensible and  
nature-conserving and people-fulfilling.  

Wanting more of the same, I began  
the novel itself and almost skipped  
the first fifty pages. I was looking  
for escape to a beautiful world, and  
Piercy was showing me the painful ex-  
istence of Consuelo (Connie) Ramos,  

a 37-year-old Chicana trying to sur-  
vive in a world determined to cage  
her for refusing to be passive and  
conforming.  

Connie, however, is not the kind of  
woman you can skip over:  

"At fifteen she stood in the kit-  
chen of her family's railroad flat  
on the near West Side of Chicago,  
braced against the sink in blue  
jeans and fluorescent pink sweater.  
She could remember herself at fif-  
teen and it did not feel different,  
only louder, more definite. 'I  
grow up like you, Mama: To suffer  

Rosa Luxemburg  

Strength That  

Theresa Ducato  

Rosa Luxemburg was born in Zamosc,  
Poland, close to the old Polish-  
Russian border on March 5, 1871. Fol-  

lowing a decade of reform (1856-1865),  

a small upper stratum of Jewish mer-  
chants and intellectuals succeeded in  
raising themselves from their phys-  
ical and spiritual misery. Her par-  
ents belonged to that class which  
strove to free itself from the narrow  
confines of Hebrew scholasticism,  
reaching out greedily for the seduc-  
tive fruit of Western culture, free-  
dom of thought, Darwinism and soc-  
ialism.  

As a young girl she was deeply  
imbued with political fervor and the  
cry for freedom that swept the coun-  
try following the insurrection of  
1863, which carried in its wake a  
considerable portion of the Jewish  
population. In that small town her  
parents' home was a cultural oasis  
that nurtured a political prodigy.  

Small and suffering from a wrongly  
diagnosed hip disease, Rosa was a  
precocious and outgoing child. When  
she was three years old, her parents  
moved to Warsaw hoping to secure a  
better education for their five  
children. Later in high school the  
repressive measures taken by the  
authorities to Russianize the Poles  
and the restrictive quota system for  
Jews created a political hotbed of  
conspiracy that sparked off her rev-  
olutionary ardor. Her profound em-  
pathy for those who were humiliated  
or exploited would always be the im-  
petus for her to take up their cause.  

At the age of 18 she came in con-  
tact with the underground literature  
of Marx and Engels, absorbing into  
her young and fertile mind their ec-  
onomic teachings and political phil-  
osophies. Inevitably, her revolution-  
ary activities with the newly-formed  
Polish Workers League led to almost  
certain arrest and, rather than face  
possible exile to Siberia, she was  
smuggled out of the country under  
straw in a peasant's cart.  

Her destination was Zurich. It was  
in the freest country in Europe, and  
attracted large numbers of Russian  
and Polish émigrés. In addition to  
enrolling at the University of Zurich  
she became involved in the Zurich  
working class movement and met, among  
others, some of the leading Marxists:  

and serve. Never to live my own  

life: I won't:'"  

After two years of college, two  
husbands, one abortion, one child -  
removed from her custody by the  
courts, one police conviction for  
pickpocketing and one lover killed by  
the state in an experimental medical  
program, Connie finds herself in the  
locked wards of New York's mental in-  
stitutions. Why? Because she saved  
her pregnant niece from the hands of  
an abortion butcher by attacking the  
niece's pimp. He then beat her and  
had her committed as dangerous and  
violent.  

She is not crazy, but she is de-  
prived of her rights as a person:  
guarded, drugged, scheduled, tampered  
with, secluded. She learns the ropes,  
how to get favors, how to escape, how  
to manage some kind of control in  
this controlled situation.  

Woman on the Edge of Time is  
Connie's story, but Piercy has also  
ingeniously injected a whole science  
fiction world into the book. Connie  
is contacted by Luciente, a person  
from the future who says that Connie  
and people like her can help Luc-  
iente's world:  

"...Those of your time who fought  
hard for change, often they had  
myths that a revolution was inevit-  
able. But nothing is! All things  
interlock. We are only one possible  
future. Do you grasp?' Luciente's  
hand became iron on her ribs. Her  

voice was piercing and serious.  
‘But you exist,’ she tried to  
laugh. 'So it all worked out.'  
‘Maybe. Yours is a crux-time. Al-  
ternative universes coexist. Pro-  
babilities clash and possibilities  
wink out forever.'"

Through their mental contact,  
Connie often escapes her dull and  
painful present for Luciente's vil-  
lage of Mattapoisett, Ma., in the  
year 2137. As she sees how this new  
society deals with birth, death,  
child-rearing, environment, personal  
relationships and physical needs,  
Connie reacts with questions, amaze-  
ment and remarks about her own wor-  
ld's way of doing things.  

We are given a graphic and force-  
ful picture of two contrasting soc-  
ieties - the USA we live in today and  
the future that might be if people  
get together to fight the system,  
eradicate sexism and racism, and learn  
how to work with each other and nat-  
ure instead of trying to control.  

Piercy is more complete in this  
sociological projection than many  
veteran sf writers, and the society  
she creates is so real and enticing  
that I didn't want to leave it. But  
the core of Marge Piercy's book is  
not this marvelous future world but  
the unending struggle of Connie Ramos  
to remain her own person in today's  
world. And that makes Woman on the  
Edge of Time a powerful book about a  
very strong woman.  

area of politics and therefore was to  
be resisted. They couldn't forgive her  
lack of modesty and the fact that she  
was highly original and freshly inno-  
vative in developing her own ideas.  

In 1904 she was sentenced to 3 mon-  
ths imprisonment for supposedly in-  
sulting Kaiser Wilhelm II; then sub-  
sequently released months before the  
first Russian Revolution of 1905.  
Lenin was active in St. Petersburg  
and the socialist movement was shif-  
ting from the realm of pure theory to  
the realm of action.  

These two leader personalities,  
Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg, had some  
basic differences inherent in their  
own particular views of the overall  
historical process of revolution.  
Lenin's decisive element was the par-  
ty; for Rosa, it was the mass. She  
would always be the more humane of  
the two and later was horrified by  
the Soviet terror. If she had acqui-  
red any real power, she would have  
trusted the people; Lenin could not.  

She had returned to Warsaw where  
she was arrested along with Leo Jog-  
iches. This time her situation was  
dangerous. Yet in spite of her poor  
health and the ever-present threat of  
clandestine execution, she loved dan-  
ger and her psychological and intel-  
lectual strengths transcended her  
personal suffering. Finally released,  
she was able to return to Berlin to  
take up the next phase of her life.  

In 1906 the DSP formed a party  
school and she taught a course on the  
introduction to the economic teaching  
of Marx. She was an outstanding tea-  
cher. Considering the difficulty of  
the basic text, Capital, she succeed-  
ed in transmitting her intellectual  
tensions, established popular rapport  
and encouraged each student to express  
his or her own ideas. She later wrote  
her famous book, The Accumulation of  
Capital, a treatise that reputedly  
dealt more effectively with the ec-  
onomic problem than the writings of  
Marx and his disciples.  

Less than a year after the outbreak  
of World War I she was again jailed,  
and as a potentially dangerous rev-  
olutionary she was detained, with  
a few interruptions, until she was  
released in 1918. By that time her
