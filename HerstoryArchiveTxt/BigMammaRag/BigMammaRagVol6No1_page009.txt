St. Joseph’s Hospital Incident  
Delivery Room Policy: Baby’s Life Comes  

By Bobbe  

In early December, Erik rushed  
Elizabeth into the emergency room at  
St. Joseph Hospital in Denver. Eliza-  
beth is a 30-year-old, non-Catholic  
Black woman who was 8 months pregnant.  

Erik, her husband, had taken her  
to that hospital on instructions from  
her doctor, as she was spotting and  
had been having problems during the  
pregnancy. They had gone to Dr. X  
because he was a doctor affiliated  
with their medical plan and St. Joseph  
is the only hospital he functions with.  

Erik was told by white-coated un-  
identified men that the hospital pol-  
icy was to save the child first and  
then the mother, (if they could) when  
there was a question as to whom they  
should save. The men did not identify  
themselves to Erik, but none of the  
men were Elizabeth's doctor. In the  
heat of an emergency Erik was concerned  
about Elizabeth and their child, not  
in finding out names of men he had  
never seen before.

Elizabeth was told the same policy  
when she was in a bed in the hospital.  
She had been told she might have to  
have a Caesarian birth. Frightened  
by the spotting she became even more  
frightened and upset when she heard  
the hospital policy; and she didn't  
feel that the hospital had a right  
to choose who should live—that de-  
cision should be her choice.  

Erik was upset and angry. He told  
Elizabeth that he wanted to give a  
written statement to the effect that  
he wanted to have his wife saved first  
because they could always get another  
child, but he could not replace  
Elizabeth.  

Elizabeth stayed overnight. The  
topic of hospital policy was not men-  
tioned again, and in the morning her  
condition had stabilized itself and  
she was released. The spotting had  
stopped and Elizabeth was eager to  
leave. She called four or five other  
doctors in the hope that she could go  
to one of them and to another hospital  
for delivery. They couldn't/wouldn't  
take her as a patient at such a late  
stage of pregnancy. (What if she had  
just moved into town and had no doc-  
tor?)  

C. Houston Alexander, MD, assistant  
administrator of OB-Gyn at St. Joseph  
was called by BMR.  

BMR: "I have heard that the stated  
hospital policy is that in a delivery,  
if there is a question of who to save  
—the mother or the child—St. Joseph's  
policy is to save the baby. Is that  
correct?  

Dr. A.: “Not at all; the mother  
is first choice."  

BMR: “A woman I know went into emer-  
gency and was told the above. Do you  
know who could have given her that  
information?”  

Dr. A.: “I don't know. Maybe it  
was her doctor's policy."  

Now we all know that doctors don't  
lie to women; they are, after all, a  
father-figure to us and they have our  
"best interests" at heart. They refuse  
to perform abortions if it is against  
their religious beliefs, particularly  
if it is a Medicaid mother, but they  
will sterilize her if the government  
pays for it. We know that Catholic  

hospitals are interested in saving  
fetus' lives, but they refuse to give  
abortions, even if a woman decides  

it is in her best interest to have  

one and even though the right to abor-  
tion is the law of the land.  

Hospitals received government funds  
for the care of indigent people through  
the Hill-Burton Act. And we all know  
that administrators of hospitals have  
their salaries paid by the institution  
and they don't buck the institution  
when they are that high up.  

We also know that women don't  
“imagine" what they are being told.  
Telling a woman in an emergency situa-  
tion that only her child is to be  

considered also tells her that she is  
not worth consideration and that she  
has no standing in the eyes of auth-  
ority to make any choice. How many  
times in how many ways do we have to  
hear that we are to be considered  
last, if at all? When will we be able  
to control our own bodies?  

We can make a start by going to  
doctors who will answer our questions.  
Ask your doctor or prospective doctor  
what his/her policy is on abortion;  
what choice will be made between moth-  
er and child in a survival situation;  
what delivery methods are used, what  
hospital policies are in effect.

A Clinic’s Collective Experience  

Consensus:  

*  
(Editor's Note: This column is part  
of a regular series by the Colorado  
Springs Women's Health Center collec-  
tive.)  

By Sharon E. Tolman and Susan Langdon  

It is a constant struggle. A new  
member of a collective has migraines  
before, during and after each meet-  
ing. Why?  

Frustration. Each decision is  
reached through long discussion—pro  
and con—of all the elements. To a  
person used to decisions being given  
her, a meeting of the collective seems  
almost like a waste of time: twelve  
people debating for an hour about  
anti-biotic pre-medication.  

"Why don't we just vote?" This  
question is often heard from new col-  
lective members. Answer—"We don't  
vote here."  

Things are decided by consensus.  
This, by definition, involves a lot  
of discussion. If even one collective  
member expresses strong disagreement  
on a subject agreed on by the others,  
her veto stands. Example: Most mem-  
bers felt that we should switch to  
cash-only payments for abortions due  
to the increased number of bounced  
checks. One member disagreed on the  
basis that it caused hardship for  
many women and was insulting to them.  
Over the next two months, six bad  
checks (over $700) changed her mind;  
the cash-only policy was adopted by  
the collective.  

The rationale for not voting is  
based on the premise that each mem-  
ber has valid points, feminist con-  
sciousness, and sincere interest in  
furthering the collective success.  

Each viewpoint is valued for its  

different perspective. The collec-  
tive concept assumes that all involved  
have equal power despite varying lev-  
els of expertise. Example: The nurse  
practitioner cannot institute changes  
in the existing procedures just by  
saying that she wants it done differ-  
ently. The requirements of a pap  
smear and gonorrhea culture prior to  
an abortion is one such instance. She  
must be able to justify these changes  
to the entire collective. Only then  
can they be instituted as part of the  

regular procedures.  

Another aspect of the collective  
process is the rotation of duties.  
Everyone ideally should be able to  
handle all jobs—health work, order-  
ing, office work, counseling, etc.  
This prevents one individual from be-  
coming indispensable and assuming too  
much power.

First  

state your demands and if the doctor  
won't agree, you are faced with a  
situation in which you must choose  
another or be a non-participant in  
your own health care. When you go to  

a doctor, have the questions written  
down and ask for a letter of verifica-  
tion of what he/she tells you or what  
you both have agreed. Ask what every  
medicine is for, and what the possible  
effects, long or short term, might be.  
It is difficult because doctors don't  
want to give us too much (or any) in-  
formation, but the more we know of our  
own body, the more we understand the  
tampering that is done to our bodies,  
and the more control we have.  

It's Worth the Time It Takes  

Our problem in this area resolved  
around business matters—billing, or-  
dering, insurance reimbursement, etc.  
Rotation of these particular tasks  
led to inconsistency. By the time  
one learned how to competently do the  
tasks, it was time for another to  
take over. Our collective has attemp-  
ted to solve this problem by hiring a  
person who is primarily responsible  
for mastering these tasks and help-  
ing other members to learn the most  
efficient ways of handling them.  

This is not meant to be a full de-  

scription of the collective process.  
We see it as an alternative to the  
hierarchical bureaucratic system. The  
experience of this collective as a  
political process will be covered at  
a later date. Others will be  
contributing their views in future  
articles.  

What Your Mother Never Told You...  

Some tampon manufacturers, in the  
great search for more and more pro-  
fits, use chemicals, wood fiber, plas-  
tic and even known cancer-producing  
materials—asbestos, for example—as  
ingredients in tampons.  

And many women find that the amount  
of chafing in repeated use of tampons  
over a week's time is extremely un-  
comfortable.  

An alternative that many women are  
using and advocating is the natural  
sponge. Natural sponges are grown in  
the Aegean Sea and are used in the US  
for ceramic purposes. The sponge  
should be a natural sponge, generally  
brownish in color, and chosen for a  
size that is comfortable, or cut to a  
good size, if necessary. Also, feel  
the sponge thoroughly to check for  
any abrasive pieces that may still re-  
main in the sponge.  

String, such as dental floss, can  
be attached to the sponge to make re-  
moval easier, but it isn't necessary.  
If you use string, it should be re-  
placed before the next month's flow.  
String can be tied tightly around one  
end, or put through a hole made in the  
sponge.  

The sponge should be rinsed tho-  

roughly and moistened before inserting.  

It should only need to be used as oft-  
en as tampons are replaced. Natural  
sponges are amazingly absorbent—  
nothing like artificial sponges. To  
replace, simply rinse, squeeze semi-  
dry and reinsert. It may take a while  

to figure out the right size for you  
and how to insert and remove it. Some  
women occasionally rinse the sponge  
out in chlorophyll (a natural odor-  
cleanser) between uses.  

Some women with a very heavy flow  
prefer to continue using "super" tam-  
pons during the heavy day, or to  
supplement the sponge with a slim pad,  
and then totally use the sponge for  
the remaining days of the period. For  
use in public restrooms, having a  
second sponge to insert and then  
later cleaning the first would be  
helpful.  

When you finish your period, wash  

the sponge thoroughly in a non-deter-  
gent mild soap, rinse thoroughly and  
store in a clean, dry, airy place  
such as a cloth bag. Allowing it to  
dry thoroughly discourages bacterial  
growth. Another alternative is to  
boil it, although this shrinks the  
sponge.  

Many women enjoy the way it feels;  
in fact, some are very enthusiastic  
about its comforts. The cost is en-  
joyable too: a smaller size will run  
40 to 60¢ and 80 to 95¢ for a larger  
one.
