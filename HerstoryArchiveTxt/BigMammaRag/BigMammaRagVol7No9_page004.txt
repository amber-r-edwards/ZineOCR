March on Washington

On Sunday, October 14, 1979
lesbians and gay people along with
their supporters will participate
in a march on Washington, D.C. This
will be the first national mass
demonstration for equal rights by
lesbians and gay people in history.

The official theme of the Nation-
al March on Washington for Lesbian
and Gay Rights is "End all social,
economic, judicial, and legislative
oppression of lesbians and gay peo-
ple." The political/social state-
ment intended by the march will be:
“Lesbian and gay people are present
in this nation, we are all races,
both sexes, all ages, physically
challenged, and all economic levels.
We are united and we demand our
human rights now."

At a nationwide grassroots con-
ference held in Houston on July 6,
delegates convened to organize, pre-
pare and promote the March (see
BMR, August 1979). Resolutions pre-
sented by the Women's Caucus and
Third World Women's Caucus and a-
dopted by the delegates were as
follows:

LESBIAN VISIBILITY

It shall be the policy of the
National March on Washington for
Lesbian and Gay Rights that there
be a minimum of 50% women and 20%
Third World represented in the lead-
ership, planning, paid staff posi-
tions, publications, delegations,
speakers, entertainers, and all pub-
lic presentations of the March. Fur-
ther, it shall be the policy that
there will be totally non-gender
specific language in publications,

Two Lesbians Bicycle To March

Billie Lindsey

In the middle of summer, Alana
Crary and Donna Irwin, Berkeley les-
bians, committed themselves as par-
ticipants in the March on Washington
for Lesbian and Gay Rights. Alana
and Donna did not call and make re-
servations on the Amtrak Freedom
Train bound to the March, nor re-
serve airline tickets. They instead
chose a much less conventional, much
more difficult, and infinitely more
exciting choice of transportation.
On July 21st, Alana and Donna, laden
with tent, sleeping bags, cooking
utensils and maps mounted their ten-
speed bicycles and headed cross
country from Berkeley, California to
Washington, D.C.

Arriving in Denver mid-week of
September 3, Alana and Donna had
traveled through Oregon, Idaho, Mon-
tana and Wyoming. Their experiences
along the way had not all been good
but the statement they made for all
lesbians can only be respected and
admired. Wherever they traveled,
the people knew they were lesbians
and that there was going to be a
national march on Washington October
14. Alana and Donna were always
clad in their March on Washington
t-shirts. They were definitely out
of the closet all the way across the
west.

In the following interview, Alana
and Donna tell why they are involved
in the March, how it speaks to them
as lesbians and feminists and some
of the experiences of their cycling
trip.

Alana: I am a burned out Berkeley
radical; I feel like making a strong
statement as a gay woman about my
right to exist as I am, and about
my self-worth. These are things I
didn't do when I was in the closet
and things that I have been enabled
to do by coming out. I want fright-
ened, closeted gay people to see
masses of people in the Capitol who
are proud to be gay. I want to
share with them the good news that
none of us needs to be imprisoned
inside ourselves.

Gay rights is a feminist issue.
The oppression of any group by a
male dominated world is a feminist
issue. The oppression of gay women
is just one more way that women are
told who and what they should be by
a society that molds women and all
press releases, and public March
statements. This policy is not on-
ly for the national organization
and offices but also for regional
and local organizing efforts. This
policy is intended to:
1. attract Lesbian participa-
tion in the March,
2. remedy the past history of
Lesbian invisibility, and
3. assure that the March accur-
ately responds to the dis-
tinct needs of Lesbians and
particularly Third World
women.

To ensure Lesbian participation,
it is essential that we establish
the following feminist policies:

1. provide quality childcare
for the March,

2. provide travel subsidies for
those who cannot afford to
come to Washington,

3. provide for separate women's
contingents, with one con-
tingent at the front of the
March led by Third World
women,

4. provide specific outreach to
and obtain support from Les-
bian feminists, feminists,
and Third World women's or-
ganizations,

5. provide secure and safe
housing for all March parti-
cipants, giving priority ac-
cess to Lesbian and gay male
parents with children, and

6. provide entertainment which
is not racist or sexist and
which does not offend or
ridicule women.

people to its needs rather than try-
ing to meet the needs of its peo-
ple.

Donna: I am a radical feminist;
not a separatist, I do not align
myself with groups whose politics
I cannot agree with. A major focus
of my life during the past year
has been coming out as a gay woman.
I deeply believe that the only way
to counter homophobia is to make
our presence and numbers known. . .

our presence and numbers known--to
our families, friends, co-workers,
to everyone we encounter in our
daily lives. I don't do this by
announcing my sexuality to everyone
but by feeling free to be myself.

It's important to me to feel
that I can have an impact in making
changes in our society. Participa-
ting in the March on Washington is
an outlet for my energy that makes
me feel more powerful. The March
will have an impact on this nation.
It will show that the gay community
is not just a bunch of weirdos in
San Francisco, but includes people
everywhere.

Bicycling to the March is a way
to make contact on a one-to-one
basis. We are wearing t-shirts
about the March; people for the
first time in their lives are know-
ingly seeing gay women. We've ex-
perienced a great deal of hostility
but have also had some interesting
and heartening discussions.

Alana: Cycling is a commitment of
time, energy and money. We have
been deprived of our home and
friends. Such a commitment makes
the statement all the more strong-
ly. It has become a successful
way to get in touch with my body,
something I have denied myself, and
which society encourages women to
forego.

The cycling has been good. Ex-
periences with people have been
both good and bad. We rarely find
gay women, but when we do, they
are always supportive and helpful.
We wear March on Washington t-
shirts which say "Celebrate Ten
Years of Gay Pride” in large let-
ters on the back. We are now pro-
bably used to reactions of curio-
sity, shock, dismay, horror and
righteous indignation; and have
even arrived at the point of find-
ing these reactions interesting and
humorous. We've been hassled,
called names, stared at, run off
the road, and propositioned by
men who love the challenge of add-
ing a dyke to their collection.
We've also had people be open and
friendly, express their fears and
misconceptions, and listen to our
responses. Those discussions have
been very rewarding.

After a short stay in Denver,
Alana and Donna resumed their
cycling to Washington. Let us
hope that they reach Washington
safely and not become martyrs in
the fight for rights that are
imperative to us all. After a
semi-truck crossed the dividing
line in Idaho and intentionally
ran them off the road, we must all
be cognizant of the fact that we
are fighting, not only for our
civil rights, but for our lives.
