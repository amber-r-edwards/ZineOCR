Toxic Jobs

General Electric has been  
the target of a California-  
wide protest over the closing  
of its plant in Ontario, CA  
where 1,200 employees were  
thrown out of their jobs in  
a city which already has 10%  
unemployment. Now it has been  
learned that GE knowingly ex-  
posed 300 employees at its  
Oakland, CA plant to the dan-  
gerous substance known as PCB  
between 1968 and 1975. The  
class action suit against  
the multinational corporation  
includes workers, their fam-  
ilies and the community at  
large.

Racism Thru Grace

Racist statements continue  
to be a favorite of the Rea-  
gan staff, this time coming  
from J. Peter Grace (Mr. Pro-  
ductivity) head of government  
spending watchdog committee.  
In a speech before the Ameri-  
can Feed and Grain Manu. Assn.  
Grace said 900,000 Puerto  
Ricans live in New York, and  
they're all on food stamps,  
so this food stamp program  
is basically a Puerto Rican  
program, also complaining  
about $904 million of the  
food stamp budget going to  
Puerto Rico.

Forced Democracy

The strongest reason for  
voting in the March 28 El  
Salvador elections was to  
get proof of having voted  
stamped on the identification  
card. The personal I.D. func-  
tions very much like the in-  
ternal passport used in South  
Africa against the Black pop-  
ulation. It must be presented  
upon demand of any police or  
military official. It is used  
in all transactions with the  
government, and after all  
past “elections" government  
officials issuing any sort of  
application, driver's license,  
business permit, or the like  
have had orders to look for  
the voting stamp. The I.D.  
card stamped "voted" is also  
used by public employees in  
picking up their paychecks.  
Wages are withheld from  
people who do not have the  
“voto" stamp on their I.D.  
and they are fired.

For many, if not most peo-  
ple, voting was not a matter  
of choosing a candidate, but  
of securing a measure of  
safety for one's family, of  
holding onto a job, and even  
of holding onto one's life.

Split Bussing

In Teheran, Iran religious  
leaders concerned about the  
possible moral temptations  
that might result from mixing  
men and women bus riders have  
decided to segregate the capi-  
tal city's double-decker bus-  
es—men on top, women on the  
bottom.

Psychiatry Kills

In Toronto, Canada an eight  
year old boy was diagnosed as  
a psychiatric patient despite  
distinct physiological comp-  
laints. He was forced to clean  
up his own vomit, and was tak-  
en off his intravenous unit—

Licensed Women Only

In Albuquerque, N.M. offi-  
cials have decided that bat-  
tered women will not be ac-  
cepted at state-run shelters  
unless they are married, and  
must show her marriage li-  
cense to prove it. In addition  
only married women beaten by  
their husbands would be eligi-  
ble.

MAO PEOPLE FROM SOCIETY,  
AT® PEOPLE

Taxing Poor In Peru

10,000 residents of the  
District of Comas, a vast  
shantytown to the north of  
Lima, Peru, marched to the  
Presidential Palace to demand  
water, sewage, health care  
and transportation for the  
area. 58% of the shantytown  
population does not have wat-  
er and sewage, so people pay  
high prices for contaminated  
water, sold in cisterns.

The event was one of the  
largest organized challenges  
to government policies since  
Belaunde's election in 1980.  
Lima's shantytowns are home  
to more than 24 million  
people. While the wealthy  
neighborhoods have basic ser-  
vices, garbage collection,  
parks, recreational facili-  
ties, schools and health care,  
the shantytowns lack all of  
these services but continue  
to pay taxes.

Susan Saxe Free!

Susan Saxe was free on May  
7 after a Superior Court  
judge ordered her released on  
personal recognizance at a  
hearing on tax evasion  
charges. Saxe was convicted  
in 1977 of manslaughter in  
shooting death of a Boston  
policeman during an extortion  
of $26,000 from a Boston bank.  
She was sentenced to 12-14  
years in prison and had com-  
pleted five years when she  
was released.

Judge Connolly set no bail  
at a hearing May 5th on a tax  
case which grew out of a raid  
Jan. 6 at the Massachusetts  
prison for women in Framing-  
ham, where Saxe was serving  
her sentence.

Adam And The Ants

Margaret McPhail of Armley,  
Leeds, England, has written  
to West Yorkshire Police, the  
Department of Public Prosecu-  
tions and the Yorkshire Post  
demanding the prosecution of  
Adam and the Ants, the chart-  
topping pop group. She dis-  
covered their concert program,  
which was sold to her 9 year  
old son, contained 6 pages of  
pornographic pictures of wo-  
men.

Apart from pictures of Adam,  
the only visual material in  
the program consists of line  
drawings of women in bondage  
gear torturing each other,  
and one full page picture of  
a woman's body. The woman's  
head and legs are missing  
from the photo, her breasts  
are crossed with chains, her  
body is bound with leather  
straps, her hands hold 2 whips.

Leeds Women Against Violence  
Against Women are backing  
Ms. McPhail.

Whose Needs?

Spencer Williams, a federal  
district judge in the Ninth  
Circuit Court in San Francis-  
co, has consolidated 165 cases  
against A.H. Robins Co. into  
a class action. A.H. Robins  
is the manufacturer of the  
ill-fated Dalkon Shield in-  
trauterine device. The maneu-  
ver is designed not to help  
women but to save A.H. Robins  
from bankruptcy. The company  
has paid out $75 million in  
claims on the Shield. How-  
ever, 80% of it has been cov-  
ered by Aetna Insurance. In  
1980 alone, A.H. Robins would  
only have had to cut ten per-  
cent from its advertising bud-  
get to cover losses from the  
Shield.
