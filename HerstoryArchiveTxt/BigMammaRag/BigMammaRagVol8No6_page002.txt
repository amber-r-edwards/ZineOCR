Repression At Colorado Women’s Prison -

Susan Goding

On June 18th, 1980, 60 women inmates  
at Colorado Women's Correctional In-  
stitute (CWCI) held a peaceful sit-  
down strike at breakfast to protest  
increased restrictions at the prison.  
Quickly thereafter, the superinten-  
dent of the prison, Mark McGoff, accom-  
panied by guards, came in. McGoff told  
the women to go to their cells or  
“face the consequences."

"Now I do hard time, before it was  
tolerable," said Bobbi LeBlanc, an  
inmate for the last four years at  
CWCI, in Canon City, in a telephone  
interview with BMR.

Bobbi is echoing the sentiments of  
most of the women at CWCI since Mark  
McGoff took over as superintendent.

McGoff has been superintendent  
since March, when John Griffin resign-  
ed.

Colorado Women's Correctional Insti-  
tute is the women's prison for Colo-  
rado although, sometimes women from  
other states are incarcerated there  
as well. Right now, 85 women are held  
there, compared with 76 last year and  
58 two years ago. It allegedly has  
a capacity for 90 inmates. There are  
29 people on the staff, down from 32  
last year.

Soon after taking over, McGoff ins-  
tituted stricter policies concerning  
furloughs and shopping trips. Women  
may now be furloughed (leave the pri-  
son for up to 50 hours) only to their  
immediate family members, and only  
if they've spent at least seven months  
at the prison and are within six  
months of parole eligibility. When  
John Griffin was there, women could  
furlough to friends as well as family,  
after a thorough investigation was  
made of the friend. Or if a woman had  
a child who was graduating or some-  
thing else special, he would sometimes  
let the woman go accompanied by an  
officer.

With McGoff as superintendent,

Bobbi said, it takes a month for a  
woman to find out about her case or  
time. Griffin was more accessible,  
they could talk to him, and he was  
aware of her case. McGoff won't talk  
to women very often, instead passing  
the buck around, so women have a hard  
time getting information. She said  
when a woman can get in to talk to  
him he just talks “bullshit.”

McGoff also has the attitude of  
“different strokes for different  
folks." One woman caught with marijuana  
was put in segregation, another caught  
in the same situation had her case  
“taken all the way to the Hill." This  
is not an isolated example, it goes  
on all the time with him.

Bobbi said most of the women there  
have little knowledge of the law.  
There is not a complete law library.  
Two months ago some inmates wrote to  
the American Civil Liberties Union  
and have received no reply.

Bobbi LeBlanc, inmate at CWCI

It's even harder to find out what  
the rules and regulations are at CWCI  
itself. She said that information is  
almost a "secret."

Since McGoff took over there have  
been two escapes and 13 assaults  
(mostly against informants) in the  
last two months. The number of dis-  
ciplinary hearings have tripled; only  
53 hearings were held through this  
time last year, compared with 141  
so far this year.

In response to the rise in assaults  
at the prison, on June 17th, McGoff  
instituted restrictions on the  
amount of free time and movement the  
inmates had.

CWCI is divided into three wings,  
north, east and south. The north  
wing has the strictest security and  
south wing is the honor wing. Bobbi  
told us that north wing had their  
free time hours restricted to be-  
tween 6:45 am and 6:30 pm except two  
nights a week. All the women work  
8 hour days. This barely gives women  
time to take a shower or get anything  
done before being locked up. Before,  
north wing had from 6 am to 10 pm.

With the new restriction on their  
movement, women must now stay in  
their wing. Before, they could go  
to visit in other wing day rooms.  
Their time outside the prison in the  
yard has also been reduced.

The day after McGoff started these  
restrictions the women held the sit-  
down strike.

Bobbi was in her cell at the time  
but put a mirror out to see what was  
going on. She said that although she  
had read in the establishment  
press that there were only 20 guards,  
(they got their information from  
McGoff), there were more like 100  
guards, wearing helmets, and carrying  
mace and clubs. She said that she  
and the other women thought, “if  
you're peaceful, nothing's going to  
happen." Instead, the guards shoved  
and punched the women with the clubs,  
several women were hit and one re-  
quired stitches for an injury to her  
knuckles.

That morning, all but 3 women re-  
fused to report to work. But, by  
that night, 15 women involved in the  
sit down demonstration were locked  
up in segregation for being "ring-  
leaders."

McGoff's response to the protest  
was that it "possibly was the result  
of new security policies, although  
I think they are reasonable for a  
correction facility and necessary  
corrective action to resolve the  
problem of increasing assaults. I  
have no intention of reducing the  
restrictions at this time."

Some things connected for me after

Although it is hard to serve  
talking to Bobbi and re-reading the  
information I had. All the restrict-  
ions are being placed to prevent  
the assaults, this is repeated over  
and over.

Bobbi said that McGoff had the atti-  
tude of "different strokes for differ-  
ent folks." I didn't think at that  
time to ask who are the different  
folks.

In a newspaper article it states  
that Alice Lovato, inmate council  
president, said inmates are angered be-  
cause all are being punished for the  
assaults by a few against informants.

She also said most of the assaults  
are by blacks against whites. Of the  
15 women locked in segregation, 2 are  
white, 11 black and 2 Chicano.

McGoff is clearly using white wom-  
en's racism by giving them a few  
crumbs of favors. They have bought  
into it.

The Rocky Mountain News articles,  
written from McGoff's viewpoint des-  
pite the quotes from the women, have  
put an emphasis on the overcrowding.  
An article said, "McGoff had no explai-  
nation for the increasing violence at  
the prison." This is a deliberate lie.

By throwing crumbs at the whites  
who inform, mostly against black and  
Chicano women, he has effectively divi-  
ded the prison. This is why there has  
been a rise in the number of disciplin-  
ary hearings. By instituting tight-  
er security measures, he is trying to  
keep the anger of the women under  
control. The crumbs he gives out are  
on an individual basis, putting a  
woman in segregation instead of "send-  
ing her to the Hill" and having her  
charged with a crime which could ex-  
tend her sentence.

McGoff said he will not reduce the  
restrictions. He means he cannot. His  
strategy in pitting race against race  
will not work under the looser system  
Griffin had. The restrictions are  
needed to protect his informants.

He has carefully planned this to  
keep the prison inmates unorganized  
and divided, to manipulate the inmates  
into giving any information he wants  
and to protect his informants.

Denver Lesbian Mom Wins Custody, Needs Money

Susan Goding

Sally Hopkins, a Denver lesbian mo-  
ther, regained custody of her daughter,  
Katy on Monday, June 30th.

Sally, who had permanent legal cus-  
tody of Katy, had been fighting her  
ex-husband Robert Sweeney to get Katy  
back.

A year ago, Sally had asked Sweeney  
to take Katy for one year while she  
finished school. Sally had been going  
to school full-time, working full-time  
and taking care of Katy full-time. She  
had no money left and was emotionally  
exhausted. Part of her problems arose  
because Sweeney refused to pay child  
support. Sally really needed help  
and Katy was interested in getting to  
know her father. A one year visitation  
agreement was written up which was to  
end June 15, 1980.

During the past year Sweeney has  
been trying to get permanent custody  
of Katy away from Sally. At one point,  
he told Sally, “I'm going to take that  
little girl away from you and watch  
you commit suicide." He has been tell-  
ing Katy that Sally doesn’t want her  
anymore. He tricked her into going to  
a psychologist, which upset her very  
much.

When Katy visited Sally at Easter,  
Katy told Sally what was going on.  
Sally then called Sweeney and told  
him she wasn't going to send Katy back.  
The next day Sweeney's sister called  
and pretending to be sympathetic,  
offered to take Katy out to lunch.  
When she got Katy she took her and  
put her on a plane to her father, in  
Minnesota.

Sweeney then filed a petition in the  
Minnesota courts asking for custody  
of Katy. His petition cited that  
lesbianism was in some way connected  
to potential child abuse and that she  
was not a fit mother because she has  
moved frequently. Since that time,  
Sally has had to fly back and forth  
to Minnesota.

Sally was successful in obtaining a  
change of venue for any custody hear-  
ings so that Sweeney will have to file  
a petition for custody in the CO court  
system.

In Colorado, Sally was able to get  
a decision that Sweeney had to stick  
to the original visitation agreement  
and return Katy on June 15th. This  
decision does not prevent Sweeney from  
filing for permanent custody.

On June 15th Sweeney refused to send  
Katy back. Sally then had to fly back  
to MN to ask the MN court to uphold  
the CO decision. The MN court reluct-  
antly agreed, only after the CO judge  
called and told them they had to.

The court ordered Sweeney to return  
Katy on June 30th or face prosecution.  
Sally's battle to get Katy back has  
cost her over $6,000 so far. She is  
still being threatened with another  
court battle to keep permanent custody  
of Katy.

Sally has had not only to fight her  
ex-husband but against society's be-  
lief that lesbians are unfit as moth-  
ers. She has had to fight the court  
in MN's reluctance to enforce an exist-  
ing court order ordering the return  
of Katy to her. Whenever one of us  
is threatened because we are lesbian,  
we all are being threatened. Sally  
needs our support.

A fund has been set up to receive  
money to help with the costs of Sal-  
ly's costs to fight this battle. How-  
ever, Sally says what she really needs  
is organizing to raise the money.  
Women interested in getting a benefit  
going should feel free. Nothing is be-  
ing done at this time. Sally has expen-  
ded her energy and resources fighting  
this far. Women interested in organi-  
zing to help her can contact her  
through BMR. If anyone can send money  
send it to:

GAY PARENTS' CUSTODY FUND

P.O. BOX 18767

Sally needs at least $6,000 to cover  
existing expenses.
