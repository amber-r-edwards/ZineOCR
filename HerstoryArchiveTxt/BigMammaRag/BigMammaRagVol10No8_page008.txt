Royal Treatment

The Department of the En-
vironment (London) passed a
circular to all public bodies,
requesting them to fly the
flag on the birth of the Prin-
cess of Wales' baby.

If the announcement of
the birth is made before 1
a.m. on any working day, flags
should be flown on the same
day.

If announced after 11 p.m.
Monday-Thursday and at any
time on Sunday, flags should
be flown on the following day.

If announced after 11 a.m.
Friday and before midnight on
Saturdays no flags should be
flown.

No Win

Last year an eleven-year
old girl from Kalamazoo, MI,
who was raped, was denied
her right to an abortion by
a "pro-life" judge. Now the
12-year-old mother is being
accused by juvenile court of-
ficials of the “emotional
neglect" of her 5-month-old
daughter.

The girl and her child have
been in separate foster homes.
Now, the Kalamazoo County
Dept. of Social Services is
deciding whether to charge
her with neglect, since she
has paid little attention
to the infant. If found neg-
ligent, she may be separated
permanently from her daugh-
ter.

Gay “Epidemic"

A recent “epidemic" finally
caused the Swedish State
Health Board to reverse its
long-standing classification
of homosexuality as an ill-
ness. A large group of gay
men and lesbians protested
the classification by call-
ing in "sick" with homosexual-
ity. The action also motivat-
ed the board to destroy all
records of individuals class-
ified as having the "disease."

Racist “Hunch"

In Los Angeles the Police
Chief, while discussing a
police tactic known as the
chokehold which has resulted
in the deaths of several sus-
pects, explained his "hunch"
as to why mostly blacks had
died from the hold: "We may
be finding that in some blacks
when the chokehold is applied,
the veins or arteries do not
open up as fast as they do
in ‘normal' people."

Unequal Opportunity

The Supreme Court has ruled
that a deaf girl need not
be provided with a sign-lan-
guage interpreter—this des-
pite the fact that she under-
stands only two-thirds of
what is said in the classroom
without an interpreter.

Justice Rehnquist said that
although school districts
must provide educational op-
portunity for disabled stu-
dents, they need not afford
students the opportunity to
reach their full potential.

See Red

The National Front (a Bri-
tish rightwing group) recent-
ly broke into See Red Women's
Poster Workshop. Equipment,
photographs and considerable
damage were caused by silkscreen
ink being poured over machin-
ery. The shop had previously
been threatened and stickered
by the local NF.

See Red is a non-profit
collective that designs and
prints women's posters. They
are not grant-aided, and the
repair bills are a threat to
the future of the collective.

Execs Held Hostage

Two US executives recently
got a firsthand demonstration
of Asian women's opinions of
their low-paying jobs.

About 100 South Korean women
held the executives hostage
for nine hours in a US-owned
computer parts plant in Seoul.
Anti-US feelings are strong,
out of the understanding that
workers are being exploited
by US multinationals that pay
wages far below living minim-
ums.

Arson Attack

A seven-alarm fire believed
to be the work of arsonists
swept through and destroyed
the Bromfield Street (Boston)
offices of Gay Community News,
Fag Rag, and the Glad Day
Bookshop (a gay and lesbian
bookstore), as well as sev-
eral artists' studios in the
same building, early on the
morning of July 7.

It is believed that the fire
was a result of arson either
for profit (by the owners of
the building) or for politi-
cal vengeance.

Glad Day, GCN, and Fag Rag
hope that community response
to the attack on their offic-
es will become part of a pu-
blic outcry against a climate
of increasing violence and
viciousness toward lesbians
and gay men.

Legal Punishment

While Marjorie Rowland was
a public school counselor,
she told school employees
she was a lesbian. The Dayton
OH School Board suspended,
transferred, and didn't renew
her. She sued on the basis
of her right to sexual pre-
ferences and won. The court
cited freedom of speech and
equal protection under the
law.

Rowland, now a lawyer, has
been charged with welfare
fraud. Rowland acknowledges
she received an unintention-
al overpayment of food stamps
several years ago but she
made repeated offers to repay
the program. Her offers were
ignored until she brought
the discrimination suit.

Conviction could lead to im-
prisonment and disbarment.

R2D2 Scabs

The large-scale introduction
of robots in the auto and
steel industry has irked
rank-and-filers who fear the
job-eliminating technology
will go hand in hand with
givebacks.

At Chrysler's Detroit area
plants, locals of the United
Auto Workers union have seen
a massive introduction of
welding robots since a give-
backs contract was signed
there nearly two years ago.

Watch Your Feet

In 1962 two US businessmen
began with $1000 selling a
Japanese running shoe. Today
it's known as Nike shoes, a
$500 million industry with
factories in S. Korea, Taiwan,
Japan, Malaysia, Thailand,
Philippines, and several in
China, and two in the US. So
while we're running in our ex-
pensive shoes, the profit is
put in US businessmen's pock-
ets at the expense of cheap-
er foreign non-union scale
labor.

Gay Health

A new alternative health
care clinic focusing on the
needs of gay men and lesbians
has opened in San Francisco.
The East West Healing Center
offers both diagnostic and
therapeutic services through
acupuncture and Chinese herb-
al medicine. The clinic will
concentrate much of its ef-
fort on treating STDs (sex-
ually transmitted diseases)
including herpes, amoebas,
hepatitis, and gynecological
disorders. Other conditions
which reportedly respond
well to treatment are drug
and alcohol addiction, ulcers,
arthritis, and hypertension.
