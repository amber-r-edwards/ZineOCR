Perhaps putting an article
in this paper seems like a

strange way to say goodbye
to two of the people you have
lived with for over a year.
In one sense it's the only
way I can share the unique

love I have for two people so
much younger than I, and yet

from a very selfish perspec-

tive, it's really the only way

I can share it with them. For

I am sure that when the real-

ity of their leaving has

packed the last suitcase in

the trunk, and the pillows

and blankets in the back seat
have arranged themselves around
the toys, and the busy work

is over and awkward hands fum-
ble for something to do--

when all the "drive safely's"

and "write soon's" have been
said 3 times... that when

it really comes time, a hug
that's a little too hard

and a kiss that's a little

too long, will have to suffice

for the words that suddenly
become nothing but tears.

To those of you who
question the effect of col-
lective living on children,

I ask you to instead

marvel at the possible effect
of children on a collective
of "grown-ups." To those

of you who imagine that all
radical collective conversa-
tions revolve around home-made
bém ingredients and lurid
sexual activity, I ask you

to consider the effect of
Tommy riding horsey on your
leg during a meeting, or
Rainey's request for the

house: to buy more bananas.

To those of you who be-
lieve that all young radicals
relate impersonally to a
Revolution that would destroy
all that you deem sacred, I
ask you to take into consi-

deration the sleepless nights

we have all spent measu-

ring the ways we unconscious-

ly manipulate children, and
the early-morning house

meetings that have talked

themselves far into the late
afternoon about still un-
answered questions. And they
are good questions to be
asked and I hope we keep on
asking and trying.

Tommy and Rainey-- I hope
you understand this pen-to-
paper cop out.

It'll be much easier for
me to have you read the good
things I feel for you, than
to look you in the eye and say
them, knowing that, given the
chance, I would probably
hurt you many times. And
once again I take the chance
of laying a trip on you.

Oh my

Maybe you'll think this is
all pretty silly and that

all I had to do was come and
tell you I really like you,
and maybe spend the afternoon
in the park. And you're
probably right--if that's
what you're thinking--but...

I guess I'd like you both
to know that the night we
spent reading the "Little
Prince," wrapped in a sleeping
bag on my balcony, or the
time in the middle of summer
we pretended a snowstorm had
hit and put on our winter
coats and went to the park
to battle the winds, and the
night we celebrated the
completion of my loft with
a “loft party," or even
the night we tried to fake
one of our singing, guitar,
harmonica parties with instant
hot chocolate and Tommy refu-
sed to drink it 'cause it tasted
like warm water--that those
times were as fun and impor-
tant to me as the good times
I had when I went out and
you couldn't, or when I
stayed up and you had to go
to bed.--And that having
chocolate marshmallow
cookie crumbs in my bed
was really not as frustrating
as I made it out to be.

Aside from all the times
we obviously enjoyed each
other, there were many mo-
ments when I silently
comforted myself in your
friendship. Thinking at
times that you two alone
allowed me the total free-
dom I needed to find and
enjoy the lost pleasures of
my being. I never told you
that of course, first be-
cause at the time it
seemed unnecessary to put it
into words, and secondly
because I guess it seemed
ridiculous for a 25-year-
old woman to tell two "kids"

7 and 9, that she appreciated
and needed them.

It seemed ridiculous then,
but through you two and the
times we've spent together

I’m beginning--just begin-
ning--to understand and
learn exactly what it means
to be a child in a society
where you are made into a
separate class of people.

A class where adults pro-
ject their myths and define
your childhood, where your
privileges are handed out
and taken away by those

who maintain control over
you (much like the Rich

vs. the Poor), where you are
told, perhaps often, that
being loved requires a
certain behaviour also dic-
tated to you by adults.

But amidst the confusion
I have seen your strength and
I envy and admire it. And so--
to you Rainey, whose earned
sarcasm and intelligence
will not allow me to project
my ego on the myth of your
childhood--I hope to devote
a good portion of my conscious-
ness to your ideas of libera-
tion.

And to you Tommy, whose
bluntness will never cease
to ring truth in my heart, I
lend an unbending ear to
the creative mechanics
that puts cardboard wheels
on beer cans and is capable
of fantastically complex
a.m. art work over a bowl of
Frankenberry cereal.

It's a new field of love
for me and it's sort of
frightening. If I get a little
lost in my exploration I'd
appreciate a helping hand.
And hopefully there will be
times when our understandings
will be so close that we may
just spend the whole after-
noon in each other's laps.
Thank you, Tommy and Rainey,
for not allowing me to con-
trol you and for giving me
a chance to love you--your
way. It's much freer than
anything I have to offer.
