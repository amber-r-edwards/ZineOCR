former manner. She told him,
"They're after me. They're
going to get me."

Also testifying at the trial
was psychiatrist David Rich-
man. He stated that in his
medical opinion, the death
was a result of electro-shock
and drug treatments. He pointed
out that the amount of
phenothiazines that Gladman
was giving her, at one point
in excess of 3,000 mg. of
Thorazine-equivalents, was
much more than the maximum
"safe" recommended dose of
800 mg. of Thorazine-equivalents. 
Richman testified that
according to the neuropathology
autopsy done, the extensive
brain damage that Lynette
showed was consistent
with studies showing electro-
shock and drug-induced brain
damage. Sudden death due to
cardiac arrest is a well-
known effect of phenothiazine
drugs. (According to a study
mentioned in a book by the
State Assembly Office of Re-
search, in an examination of
218 deaths of patients on
phenothiazines at Napa State
Hospital, there were sixteen
unexplained cardiac deaths.)
Richman also pointed out that
the machine used to give Lynette
the shock treatments,
the Reuben Reiter Modack II,
is the crudest model, and the
most difficult one with
which to regulate the amount
of electricity. Unlike other
machines, there is no auto-

Coming Out

The fact that it is printed
in Spanish and English makes
it accessible to countless
readers that mainstream Amer-
ica "forgot," proving, once
again, that the people with
the least resources invari-
ably take on the needs that
the more privileged among
us ignore.

With its seven sections
this book is eminently read-
able and can be finished in
one sitting. It is also
extremely reasonably priced,
at $3, in these days of $7
to $10 for small press paper-
backs.

I have tried to emphasize
quotes from the text in this
book review as opposed to my
own interpretations because
this book has received too
little attention from the
women's/alternative press
since its publication in 1980
and I think it is high time

matic shut-off device, des-
pite claims in the Reuben
Reiter brochure to the con-
trary, so the person admin-
istering the electricity
might assume that the current
had been cut off when in fact
it had not. In addition, it
is difficult for a human
being to apply the current
the fraction of a second
required in a manually-controlled
machine like the Reuben
Reiter (which is not to say
that even a fraction of a
second of electrical current
is beneficial to the human
brain). Another point stressed
by Richman was that at

no time during Lynette's in-
carceration was any kind of
adequate medical or neurolo-
gical testing done.

Alarmed by the changes in
Lynette's personality and
behavior after the shock and
drug treatments, her mother
kept looking for a doctor or
institution that would be able
to "bring her back." After
one or two more psychiatric
admissions, Lynette was sent
to Napa State Hospital against
Selena's strenuous objections.
After 72 hours, Lynette's fam-
ily was granted permission to
visit her at Napa. Here is how
Selena describes this visit.
"We went into a huge room.
I've never seen so many peo-
ple in one room in my life
except at a convention. I
didn't see Lyn. It's a policy
at Walnut Creek Hospital and

waiting a long, long time
for the world to listen,

"The liberation of color
women needs to be pushed
from all revolutionary
sectors because from those
experiencing the worst
oppression will the strongest
leaders emerge .. ."

"It is hard to recognize
the power each one of us
has to create a new life
for herself when we have
been victims all our lives;
we may be so far down there
is no place to look but
up."

tion movements. . ."

Gladman to deny food as pun-
ishment. She was 30 lbs. un-
derweight. When she was in the
hospital she was afraid to
speak. We asked for a writ of
habeas corpus to get Lyn out.
Dr. Rohr said he would bring
Lyn out to see us. She was
walking very slowly, wearing
the same clothes she wore
four days ago. Hair uncombed.
She started screaming 'Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy!" We all sat
down with her for two hours.
I said let's sing some songs.
She said OK - then can we go
home: I didn't say anything
since I didn't want to tell
her the truth. She couldn't
remember words to songs she
had sung all her life, like
‘Jingle Bells.' We left - she
tried to leave with us. Dr.
Rohr said he was going to
extend the 72-hour hold. Two
days later Dr. Rohr called
and said Lyn had had a car-
diac arrest. I got there in
30 minutes. We sat there
waiting for at least an hour.
The doctor said, ‘I'm sorry
Mrs. Miller. Lyn is dead.'
After I got through screaming
and crying, I said, 'You
killed her. You broke her
heart.'"

One thing that came through
clearly in all the testimony
about Lynette was her strong
spirit and will to resist in-
justice. Some observers felt
that it was this refusal to
submit that led to the ever-
increasing levels of "treat-
ment," and finally her death.

"White women are socialized
into believing they
are superior to women of
color . - but color women
also maintain the
hierarchy when we accept
our inferior status with-
out question."

"Our culture and the rev-
olution is constantly
evolving . . . women are
developing our powers at
fantastic speeds .. ."

"La Lucha continua/the
struggle continues."

first in a series of bi-

ships in differently devel-
oped societies.

After the mistrial was de-
clared, the attorneys for
Selena Miller, Deborah and
Paul Halvonik, indicated that
the case would not be dropped.
It is interesting to note
that after the default judg-
ment against them last Aug-
ust, Gladman Hospital called
a halt to the administering
of shock treatment. The psy-
chiatrist who administered
shock to Lynette, Dr. Martin
Rubenstein, is still prac-
ticing his trade at Herrick
Hospital in Berkeley, the
scene of several recent de-
monstrations against shock.

ruption and repression ex-
tended right down the ladder.
It was common for women to be
forced to provide sexual ser-
vices to get a job - the
‘Evening Palace', one of
Gairy's hotels, was notorious
as a thinly disguised brothel,
to which women would be trans-
ported by government vehicles
and ‘rewarded' with paid em-
ployment. Even the isolated
villages were terrorized by
the "Mongoose Gang', a squad
of the "roughest and toughest
roughnecks' (Gairy's words)
who raped and pillaged their
way around the island in the
name of law and order. The
memory of all this is still
fresh in most people's minds.
In 1973, MAP (Movement for
Assembly of Peoples) and
JEWEL (Joint Endeavour for
Welfare, Education and Liber-
ation) amalgamated into the
New Jewel Movement (NJM), led
by a young Marxist-Leninist
intelligentsia, but supported
by the mass of the peasantry
and plantation workers. The
NJM wanted a democratic sys-
tem which would ‘raise the
standard of housing, clothing,
education, health, food and
recreation of all the people.'

After trying to work within
the corrupt system for change,
people realized what a mock-
ery the system was and how
impossible it was to remove
the ruling party from power
by parliamentary means. Sup-
port for the NJM intensified
until on March 13, 1979 a re-
volution took place and the
NJM took power. Not a single
person moved to defend the
Gairy regime, the leaders
fled to the United States
where Gairy already was, and
that morning there was dan-
cing in the streets.
