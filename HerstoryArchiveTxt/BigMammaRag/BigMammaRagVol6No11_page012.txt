NOW IN PAPERBACK

The most beautiful and complete celebration of women's love for women ever published.

The Joy of Lesbian Sex is the most thorough, thoughtful, tender, caring book in existence on lesbian lifestyles and sexual expression. Widely acclaimed when published in hardcover at $12.95, it is now available — complete and uncut, with all of the original drawings and four-color paintings — in a fine quality paperback edition at just $7.95. Written by lesbians who know all the difficulties of a lesbian lifestyle, it is full of reassurance and advice on sexual, emotional, social and legal problems. But most of all, this book is joy — a repeated expression of the ecstasy that women can know together and the intense pride of a fulfilled life-style.
