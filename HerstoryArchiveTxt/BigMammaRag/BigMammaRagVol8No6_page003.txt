BMR Enlightening

Big Mama Rag,

Having moved to Denver just two  
months ago I'm pleased to have been  
introduced to your magazine. The  
women behind the booth at the Capitol  
Hill People's Fair offered me some  
back issues that proved to be very  
enlightening.

As a result my check for two years  
subscription is enclosed. All my en-  
couragement and support. Thanks again  
to the women at the fair.

Class Issue Issues

Dear Mama,

I'm writing in response to the June  
issue of BMR in which the collect-  
ive's class analysis is given. I con-  
gratulate the collective for sharing  
valuable personal insights with us  
and for having persevered in defining  
some of the barriers among women that  
have held back our common struggle.  
BMR is better than ever!

I think there are several tendenc-  
ies in the analysis that should be  
questioned however. One is a tendency  
to overlook the fact that only a hand-  
ful of women are members of the rul-  
ing classes, those who own the means  
of production and who govern state  
bureaucracies. As women, and especial-  
ly as mothers, all of us are victims  
of false consciousness if we do not  
understand the need for feminist rev-  
olution. We cannot simply be dismis-  
sed as “bourgeois women" or "petty  
bourgeois women" - although some of us  
can certainly be identified as oppor-  
tunists, and all of us need to strug-  
gle around issues of privilege, par-  
ticularly as citizens of the USA.

Unfortunately, even working class  
women, and especially those in skil-  
led jobs or in jobs where our rela-  
tions with bosses are more immediate  
and influential than our relations  
with fellow-workers, can be opportun-  
ists and/or victims of false con-  
sciousness.

It is possible to identify where  
the most revolutionary feminist de-  
mands will eventually come from (I  
would say from women who work in mass  
production or public service and are  
victims of the "double shift," when  
they become organized - in Denver,  
most likely telephone company, postal  
workers, health workers, bank and  
clerical workers). It is also poss-  
ible to identify particular groups  
who have shown most initiative in the  
present (lesbians and colonized  

COLLECTIVE

Lessons In Language

Dear Sisters,

Regarding the use of the word  
"men/tally" ill, isn't it weird to  
realize that in the society con/trol-  
led by men it is men who (men) tally  
who is "ill" and who is not according  
to their w/hims!

I think we will have to learn to  
say psychic/ally instead of men/tally.

Sorry I'm late but here is my check  
for one year subscription.

Best wishes,

women, in different ways and around  
different issues). We do not become  
a revolutionary vanguard simply by  
rushing to transform ourselves into  
certain "categories," however, but  
by engaging in dialectical struggle  
among women as well as between women  
and men. We must learn to support,  
understand, and identify with prole-  
tarian (working class) feminism to  
the extent that we are able to do so,  
while recognizing the validity of  
bourgeois reforms and of petty bour-  
geois cultural feminism.

There is an element of opportunism  
in struggle for reform which does not  
go beyond reformism, and in cultural  
feminism which does not grow to em-  
brace all races and nations, and all  
oppressed classes. There is also an  
element of opportunism in a version  
of proletarian feminism which assumes  
an arrogant stance in relation to  

women whose consciousness is still de-  
veloping and who are faced with daily  
challenges to feminist commitment.

The BMR collective is giving us  
courageous leadership by providing a  
forum for struggle. You have also  
shown sensitivity in reporting on  
events such as that of the visit of  
Lolita Lebrón, recognizing her con-  
tributions to revolution as well as  
the reasons for her reluctance to  

identify with feminist struggle (with-  
out condoning this). I hope you will  
continue to let debate flourish, and  
to learn from those who are not on  
the collective but who are engaging  
in practical work in neighborhoods,  
workplaces, and community organiza-  
tions.

There's Got To Be A Way  

Dear BMR,

I want to state my case, share it,  
and want advice.

One year ago I chose to leave my  
family and got a divorce. I lost cus-  
tody of my two daughters, five and  
three years. The reasons given - no  
house or job, and my "lifestyle,"  
I'm a lesbian but it was not stated  
in court. My visitation rights which  
were stated in the decree were denied  
by my ex-husband.

Here is my plight. I want regular  
established visitation times every  
year. I'm a lesbian living in Salt  
Lake City, Utah, formerly from Moab,  
Utah where the divorce occurred. I  
haven't been able, in Utah, to find  
a lawyer who respects rights of les-  
bians and is willing and able to  
pursue my case in court.

Any suggestions or people to call?  
I've checked with various lawyers,  

Summer Cycling?  

Dear BMR,

Enclosed you will find a check for  
the amount of $6.00 for a one year  
subscription to Big Mama Rag.

In addition I am requesting from  
you any information on bicycling  
trips for women in the Colorado area  
for late August or early September.  
I have just begun riding seriously  
and would probably be interested in  
a beginners to moderate group. Any  
information that you could share with  
me would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely in sisterhood,

ful.

I know there's hope and I want to  
see my kids. There's got to be a way  
to fight this patriarchal law system.  
Please help.
