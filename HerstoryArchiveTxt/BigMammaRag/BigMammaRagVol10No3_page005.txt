criticism/self-criticism

al system, psychiatric weapons
in fighting these systems.

Another reason I was hor-
rified is that this misrepre-
sentation will be so easily
seen for what it is. Janet
Frame is a well-known Austra-
lian writer, whose books are
available in many women's
bookstores. Any of your read-
ers who are familiar with her
work can probably deduce that
she was not at the demonstra-
tion. In addition, these
"shock quotes" have been
printed in a variety of other
feminist publications. (No
More Cages, Matrix, Sister)
with their correct sources.
Janet Frame's book, Faces In
The Water, was published in
1961 and Georgia Jones' state-
ment was originally printed
in a letter to Madness Net-
work News in 1975. Finally,
not crediting the source of
the quotes is ripping off
these publications.

My objections to your re-
writing of my article were not
limited to the above inac-
curacy. You also mistakenly
indicated that Sylvia Plath
wrote her letter from Mc-
Cleans hospital about her
fear of ECT shortly before
she committed suicide. In
reality, she was an inmate
of McCleans ten years before
she killed herself. Although
this was not apparently an
intentional misrepresentation,
it wouldn't have occurred if
you had followed any kind of
ordinary editorial courtesy
and checked with the author.
(I did write in my article
that Sylvia Plath had written
bitterly about ECT shortly
before killing herself, and
I did send you a number of
shock quotes including the
one by Plath. I did not in
any way imply that Plath was
in McCleans shortly before
she killed herself. The quote
was one of the many critical
things she wrote about shock
during her lifetime.)

As I read on in “my” article,
I saw that various things
had been tacked on at the end
as if I had written them. If
you as editors have addition-
al things to say on the sub-
ject of ECT, why not put an
editorial note? It's incredi-
ble to me that you apparently
have the policy of re-writing
people's articles without
consulting them or even noti-
fying them. I hope this poli-
cy will change. I was also
slightly amazed that you had
chosen to put a description
of Leonard Franks's experien-
ce with shock at the end of

the article without mention-
ing that he had been present
at the NAPA demonstration.
Why claim that two people had
been at the demonstration who
weren't there, and delete the
information that another per-
son was present?

I greatly admire Big Mama
Rag and am offering this re-
sponse in the hopes that you
will improve your accountabi-
lity to authors and readers.

Dear Sara, Marion,
Jenny and Readers

Juana,

We have received a lot of
criticisms about our head-
lines. We try to make head-
lines that grab the eye and
hopefully, encourage people
to read the article. Unfor-

tunately, Sara is right
about the "Racism in the
Abortion Rights Movement
(A.R.M.)" being sensational-
ist, unconstructive and name
calling. Part of the problem
was that, although we all
had read the article, we had
read it several weeks before
we decided on titles for the
cover and didn't have clear
memories about it. We should
have reread it then. In fact,
we did know, if we had
thought about it hard enough,
that A.R.M. had been defunct
for 2 years. We had printed
Marion Banzhaf's article
from Arm Action, about the
folding of A.R.M. only a

few months ago. As you can
see from Marion's letter the
headline on that article was
another we didn't think
through.

It's hard to receive criti-
cism anytime, but these criti-
cisms are absolutely correct.
We screwed up and we have no
reasons for them, we used bad
judgment, tried to be eye
catching or cute; in these
cases we ended up being sen-
sationalist and racist. We
also have to criticize our-
selves for not bringing out
these criticisms in the pap-
er before being confronted
by the authors, especially
about the headline on Sara's
article. Susanna Smith, a
BMR supporter, had given us
similar criticism at the
monthly critique about the
cover.

In the Feb. issue we put in
another bad headline. One of
the Hot Briefs was about a

“Third World Newsreel/Aegis

judge who sentenced a child
rapist to only 90 days’ work-
release and called the 5
year-old victim “sexually
promiscuous". We titled it
"Sick". Neither rapists, nor
judges, police, or social
workers who make the rapist
the victim are sick. "Sick,"
"mentally ill," and "crazy"
are all words used to deny
the political implications of
individual's actions. Rape
benefits all men by keeping
all women terrorized. A bet-
ter headline would have
been "Court Screws 5 Yr Old".
Our headline for Marion's
Article, "A Year And A Half
Of Armed Struggle," was not

only inappropriate, but has
other implications. We are
convinced that liberation
will only happen when we take
the streets through armed
struggle. Not only in this
headline did we do injustice
to movements engaged in arm-
ed struggle. Our coverage of
the attempted Brinks expro-
priation concentrated on how
it would affect the white
gay/lesbian/left communities
instead of dealing with

where the repression really
happens most--in the Black,
Latino, Puerto Rican, Haitian,
Indian, and all other commun-
ities of people of color.
Since many of our readers

are involved in the white
gay/lesbian/left communities,
it was important to print

the articles we did. These
reiterated that we must nev-
er talk to the F.B.I. and

we must stick together in
support of persons and groups
involved in all radical ac-
tivities and politics, espec-
ially those engaged in armed
struggle.

Along the same thought, in
talking about our racism,
Juana's letter really point-
ed out our insensitivity in
making our headlines. We
found the examples very use-
ful.

Jenny’s article about our
editing is another screw up.
One thing we have prided our-
selves on lately and really
made a point of is never
editing without talking to
the author. We have received
criticism on our editing
process in the past and had
made a resolution with our-
selves and readers to con-
tact authors before any
editing. Last month we lost
it all, and severely mis-
represented and changed Jen-
ny's original work. We
should have made an editor-
ial note to put in what we
had wanted.

We definitely screwed up,
and while we don't excuse
ourselves, we disagree with
the idea that, “once written,
words cannot be unwritten."
It is one of the greatest
difficulties of working on
this project, to see our er-
rors right out there. We can
never deny our mistakes. But
one of the benefits of this
project, too, is that we
don't just talk ourselves in
circles. Errors, bad ideas,
incomplete analysis are
quickly brought out. We strug-
gle for change and need crit-
icisms to help us.
