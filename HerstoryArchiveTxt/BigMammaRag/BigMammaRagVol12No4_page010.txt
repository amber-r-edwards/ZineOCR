Supporting National Liberation -- APSP

Committee in Solidarity with
African Independence

In November 1983, a flyer
was circulated by three
black women and published
by Big Mama Rag, making
slanderous allegations about

criticism

the leadership and organi-
zation of the African Peo-
ple's Socialist Party and
calling on people to unite
with them in "exposing anti-
woman practices in the Black
Liberation Movement." The
Committee in Solidarity with
African Independence, a
North American cadre organi-
zation, and growing mass
movement of anti-imperialist
solidarity which is under
the leadership of the Afri-
can People's Socialist Party
denounces this four-year
long slander campaign as
serving the State's interest
in attempting to discredit
the re-building of a mili-
tant social movement based
on the interests of the black
working class for Bread,
Peace and Black Power.

First we must state, based
on many years of work and
struggle under the leader-
ship of Chairman Omali and
the African People's Social-
ist Party (APSP), that we
believe the allegations are
entirely false. The history
of the internal struggle,
and analysis and refutation
of the slander spread by the
three women (who are in fact
ex-members of the Party)
can be found in a newly released
booklet "The Black Working
Class Vs. The U.S. Govern-
ment - Building the Offen-
sive Against Slander and FBI
Counter Intelligence." Second-
ly, the circulation of this
flyer today is in the con-
text of a re-emergence of
State surveillance and police
harassment of the work of
the APSP which is engaged in
building an active mass
based social movement. This
is a movement which addresses
the needs and conditions of
existence of African working

_class people - shelter, med-
ical care and food - in a
way which exposes the funda-
mental contradictions of col-
onialism such as property
relations and which empowers
the black communities to or-
ganize to resolve their pro-
blems politically and prac-
tically, becoming part of
the black revolutionary
movement. Examples are the
Joyce and Jeffrey Wheeler
Housing Program which is or-
ganizing in Oakland for an
African People's Mission
Center and African People's

Free Childcare Collectives.
This program is being car-
ried out by the Black Commun-
ity Control Committee which
was formed in defense of the
eviction struggle of the
Uhuru House and quickly took
the offensive by seizing and
fixing up an abandoned city-
owned house for a homeless
black mother and by seizing
Uhuru Park to build Tent City
for the Homeless. While these
actions got widespread sup-
port from the black and

North American communities,

(Fla.) City Council documents
current covert State sur-
veillance of the Black Comm-
unity Control Housing Cam-
paigns being done in Oakland
and St. Petersburg. The memo
states that public meetings
will be monitored and that
ongoing coordination between
Oakland and St. Petersburg
City Police Departments will
be set up, implying the role
of the FBI.

Here we want to raise the
political questions that the
progressive North American

Police Terror is response to organizing
“a little piece of power” at Uhuru Park

both of them forced the
black city government to
show their alliance with
white property owners and
corporate interests by using
force against the people.

In 1982 and '83, the APSP
sponsored and helped build
the International Tribunal
on Reparations for black
people and the African Na-
tional Reparations Organiza-
tion which has focused simi-
lar local organizing around
the U.S. to the demand for
Reparations for black peo-
ple. The International Tri-
bunals have brought people
involved in these struggles
in many cities together to
testify before an interna-
tional panel, gathering evi-
dence of U.S. violation of —
the UN Genocide Convention
and other international laws.

The State has moved in
response to the success of
this growing work. In the
past few months there have
been break-ins of Party mem-
bers' houses with nothing
stolen, agent provocateurs
disrupting the community or-
ganizing, arbitrary arrests,
harassment and brutality by
police. On a recent Phil
Donahue show, a caller, who
claimed to be an ex-CIA
agent, stated that Oakland
was the headquarters of the
most dangerous domestic or-
ganization.

and women's communities are
faced with in taking a posi-
tion in support of or against
the Black Liberation Move-
ment. It has historically,
and today, represented the
oppressed African workers
and community whose labor is
the underpinning of the cap-
italist/imperialist system.
This is why it has provided
the impetus for every pro-
gressive movement that has
happened in this country.

In the late 1960s, it was
the Black Power movement
which mobilized every black
community across the U.S. in
resistance to the constant
police and economic terror
of colonialism used to en-
force the brutal exploitation
of black people necessary

for the survival of U.S. and

worldwide imperialism. This

resistance came in the form

of armed self-defense against

the police as well as pro-
grams and institutions such
as free food and clothing,
schools and medical services
which built the independence
of their communities from
the structures of colonial-
ism. Developing from the
Civil Rights Movement, it
was black people who broke
open the attempt of the U.S.
government to impose a fas-
cistic "peace" during the
‘50s. It was the Black Power
Movement which provided the
political clarity and lead-
ership to the North American

the U.S. Government

"New Left." Through the pol-
itical analysis and articu-
lation black people were
raising about colonialism,
the North American women's
movement adopted the anti-
colonial analysis to apply
to North American women as
the political basis for
"radical feminism." It was
the Black Power movement
which brought militancy and
urgency to the white radi-
cals on campuses and raised
the demand to "Bring the War
Home." The Black Power move-
ment shook U.S. society
at its foundation. It had
the support of the majority
of black people across the
U.S. In fact, politically
and ideologically, it was a
successful revolution of
black workers. J. Edgar
Hoover declared the Black
Panther Party the "greatest
threat to the internal secur-
ity of the U.S." and launch-
ed a military campaign which
crushed it. "By the end of
1969, virtually all of (the
Black Panther Party) its
national leaders had been
killed, jailed or forced
into exile. Charles Garry,
the party's chief defense
lawyer, reported that in the
two years between December
1967 and December 1969, 28
Panthers had been killed by
the police and hundreds more
were arrested on charges
which were so blatantly
false that in 87 cases they
were dropped by the courts.
Garry reported that in over
30 years of law practice,

"I have never experienced
the type of persecution
forced on the Black Panth-
ers." This is only part of
the picture. Many hundreds of
unknown resisters were mur-
dered or incarcerated in men-
tal institutions or prisons
where they remain today.
While they didn't know it

at the time, this was a re-
sult of the covert program
called the Counter Intelli-
gence Program or COINTELPRO,
whose goals include:

"4. Prevent militant black
nationalist groups and lead-
ers from gaining respect-
ability, by discrediting them
to three separate segments
of the community. The goal
of discrediting black na-
tionalists must be handled
tactically in three ways.
You must discredit these
groups and individuals, to,
first, the respectable Negro
community. Second, they must
be discredited to the white
community, both the respon-
sible community and to 'lib-
erals' who have vestiges of
sympathy for militant black
