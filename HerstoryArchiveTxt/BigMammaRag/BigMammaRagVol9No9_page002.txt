Dialogue Needed

Dear Sisters:

I want to thank you for
publishing my article on
Middle Eastern women in your
July issue.

That article, and a
speaking tour I had on that
same subject, helped bring
about a great deal of dis-
cussion on the issue of
feminism and national liber-
ation movements among Third
World women, including
Israeli, Palestinian and
most particularly Iranians.

Feminism has often been
regarded by most Marxists
and others as a Western
phenomenon, a product of
Imperialism, a very limited
concept of emancipation
which actually hinders the
ultimate goal of changing
the whole of society.

In contrast, the term
Marxist-Feminism, as was
spelled out in that article,
has pointed to an emanci-
pation which, as Fadel M'
Rabet, the Algerian
feminist, so beautifully
wrote, "...is part of the
whole, and in turn con-
ditions that whole."

However, I have had a
different experience with
some American feminists who
seem to be more concerned
with the feminist movement
without realizing that in
our present-day society,
there is a limit to women's
emancipation and that to go
beyond the stage we have
already reached, we need a
total change in the struc-
ture of the society we live
in. The "Family Protection
Law," hand in hand with
Reagan's budget cuts and

cover:
collective:

tax reductions clearly is
an indication of the retro-
gressive situation we face.

In the discussions we have
had in News & Letters-
Women's Liberation commit-
tees, whether on Russian
feminists, the Polish
women's movement, Middle
Eastern women or the women's
movement in America, we
try to bring together both
groups—Third World women
and American feminists—and
help create a dialogue
which would bring about an
Internationalist Marxist-
Feminist perspective. And
believe me it isn't an easy
task! That is why I would
very much like to know how
you felt about the concept
of Marxist-Feminism that I
raised in that article. If
you feel as much as we do
the urgency of creating
such a dialogue with your
readers. And if you have had
any such responses, how do
we give the opportunity
for such a discussion to be
carried through in other
women's committees?

I would be most interested
in your ideas on these sub-
jects. Also, would you please
send me a few copies of your
July issue, so we could
keep it on our files.

In sisterhood,
Neda Azad

Feminist Arts

Dear Constance,

A lot of punk speaks to my
struggles. I'm glad you
mentioned Marianne Faithfull.
I have pictures of her on my
wall, next to Sara Bernhardt
and a woman from an Etruscan

tomb. When I heard her sing
a song about guilt on
Saturday Night Live last
year, I felt that I was
finally hearing someone open
up and get beyond the
"winner" facade. "I feel
guilt. I feel guilt, though
I know I did no wrong, I
feel guilt." I try all the
time to get women to talk
about all the guilt we

carry around. Guilt is some-
thing totally and completely
built into the day-in-day-
out brainwashing of this
culture. Women need to talk
about guilt instead of pre-
tending to have overcome it.
There is also a song on her
album called "The Ballad of
Lucy Jordan," which is about
a woman's madness. I am

in constant battle against
the power of psychiatry to
destroy us, torture us, and
teach us lies and power-
lessness. I am open to every
woman I meet about being an
ex-psychiatric inmate and
about the many health prob-
lems I have from the "treat-
ment" I got. The many, many
punk songs about alienation
and contempt for this
plastic, consumer-oriented,
and very dangerous society
we find ourselves in give
me a good feeling inside.
Songs like X's "We're
Desperate" and "Nausea" and
Lene Lovich's "Joan of Arc"
inspire me. I like the way
punk sounds. It feels like
the music of an age when

the superpowers threaten to
destroy the entire planet
and the music of an age

when patriarchal scientists
are busy developing ways to
turn us totally into mind-

controlled puppets.

I wrote an article in
April '80's Big Mama issue
on Incarcerated Women, and
about how women aren't
being real to each other
about their emotional strug-
gling and how women os-tra-
cize mental patient types
like me who can't or won't
act normal. Most of "women's
music" bores me because it
is so sweet and serene.

I'm not often very mellow.

I am an intense woman,
constantly talking about how
oppressive things are,
especially psychiatry. I
hear that some people

think I'm "pushy," but I
think a lot of other Jewish
women also get called pushy.

Besides, I resent the
power hierarchy in most of
the feminist arts, (Note
that I say most, not all of
the feminist arts.) I get a
very definite impression
that a lot of the feminist

musicians come from middle and

upper-class backgrounds. I
guess I never got over the
fact that my mom and dad
couldn't afford to get me

a piano or piano lessons,
although I wanted them
desperately. I do a lot of
writing and I think my
writing says something very
powerful, but most feminist
publications don't print

my stuff. There are ever so
many frustrated writers
around. In some place in
their hearts they must
resent, as I do, that the
few women's movement writers
that get read and quoted over
and over, all seem to be
