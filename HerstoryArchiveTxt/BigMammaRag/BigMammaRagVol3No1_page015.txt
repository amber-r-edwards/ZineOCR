Chicana Welfare Rights

From Page 1

the separation of children
from their families “especially
in the Chicano community.
They are reacting to their own
incompetence and using the
Chicana mother as their
scapegoat,” she continues.
Since the Chicana Welfare
Rights has been using space
temporarily in the Legal Aid
office at 820 Santa Fe, 55
cases have come to the
welfare rights group from
parents who want to institute
legal proceedings to have
their court-separated children
returned to their custody.
Chicano Culture Ignored
Patricia Estrada says that

much which has been written
about the child abuser is
misused, misinterpreted and
misdirected to the Chicana
mother. “No research has ever
been done on Chicano culture
in the areas of child abuse.
Black and Anglo women who
were known abusers were the
groups studied that furnished
profiles for Dr. Henry Kemp’s
book The Battered Child
Syndrome that is used by
hospitals to recognize a child
abuser.

“In the Chicano culture it is
normal for the young Chicana
to help raise her mother's
family. But this past experi-
ence of a Chicana mother who
takes her child to the hospital
for treatment cites her as a
potential child abuser accord-
ing to the prevailing accepted
studies,” she continues.

The separation of a child
from its family, especially if it
is prolonged or repeated
during the child’s first three
years, can have damaging
far-reaching effects according
to John Bowlby, an English
psychiatrist, in his book
Attachment and Loss, Vol. II,
Separation. The child's feeling
of detachment may last an
entire lifetime stunting “the
child's personality, outlook on
life, ability to trust, to love
and eventual independence.”

William Byler, executive
director of the Association on
American Indian Affairs, test-
ified that 25 to 35 percent of
all Indian children are placed
in foster or adoptive homes or
institutions. He said that
social workers who are ignor-
ant of Indian customs “fre-
quently discover neglect or
abandonment where none
exists.”

Estrada Lifestyle

Patricia Estrada came to
Colorado from California
where she worked for seven
years with the problems of
welfare and their effects on
people. She receives welfare,
has one daughter with her in
Denver and two other daugh-
ters and three grandchildren
in California. She is personal-
ly challenging being forced to
go into WIN since she is busy
working with Chicana Welfare
Rights. “I have a job. I’m just
not getting paid for it. I did this
same thing when I was on
welfare in California and was
considered a Case Aid and got
paid for it. I helped to get a
group off the ground to fight
WIN. Then I decided to come
to Colorado, principally to put
my daughter in Escuela
Tlatelolco. The public school
system is so bad. I am also
refusing to accept child care
provided by the Welfare
Department. I am the only one
who can provide child care to
my child because of our
culture. So I should be given
child care money for doing so
this summer.

“The foster homes that
Chicano children are placed in
when they are taken from their
parents do not provide Chica-
no culture. The Welfare
Department says ‘Well, get us
more Chicano foster mothers.’
Bullshit. We all know that we
can’t meet their qualifica-
tions.

“When we win a case in
court by having the child
returned to its home, what
do we really win? There is
always a Stipulation of so
many visits per month by the
visiting nurse and social
worker. That social worker,
their expert Spanish-speaking
Anglo, is the one who causes
the trouble in the first place by
imposing her middle-class
standards on the Chicana.
Having her return to the home
just makes the mother more
defensive.”

Chicana’s Babies Taken

In one case, Ms. Estrada
says, all but two children were
returned to the mother. The
two who were kept had the
lightest skin. “How can she be
a good mother for all of her
children except the two with
the fairest complexions?” She
feels that the prevalence of
birth control and abortion in
the country has caused a
shortage of adoptable child-
ren. “The gringo is no longer
producing the blue-eyed, light
skinned baby. So the Chica-
na’s babies are being taken
away from her.”

“Women who are on wel-
fare,” she continues, “are
forced to go to clinics where
the personnel try to convince
them to use birth control
methods to limit the size of
their families. This is simply
preparing the Chicana for
forced sterilization.

“Living on welfare is a
matter of survival. If there
were any other place to go
other than to welfare, we
would be there. With welfare
money you get only enough to
survive on - enough to exist.
You can't buy soap or toilet
paper with food stamps and
so when your kids are dirty
you are accused of neglecting
them. We need the support of
all women's groups to fight
the Talmadge Amendment. I
would like to see a woman
lawyer working with Chicana
Welfare Rights. We mothers
do this work because it has to
be done. We're doing it for the
agencies that don’t do the job
that they are supposed to be
doing.”

we are serious.” One thing
she said women would have to
try to do is hold their temper
because sometimes it seems
pretty hopeless. She pointed
out that Third World women
have the most trouble as they
can’t afford babysitters and,
as with the United Farm
Workers boycott, they had to
take their children with them
to the picket lines.

After the guest speakers,
we broke into the following
workshops: (1) Affirmative
Action, (2) Women's Partici-
pation in Their Unions, (3)
Legislative and Political Ac-
tion and (4) Organizing the
Unorganized. A consensus of
the workshops wasn’t given at
the conference but will be
mailed to the participants.

Area Caucuses Planned

Area caucuses were then
held with the largest number
of women being from the
Denver and Boulder area.
Denver voted to have their first
Denver chapter meeting on
Sunday, June 30th at 1 p.m. at
the Oil, Chemical and Atomic
Workers Union Hall on 1636
Champa. Any women inter-
ested should contact Debbie
Singer, PO Box 4274, Denver
80204 or Shirley Jackman,
8441 McDougal St., Denver
80229, for further information.

Although as a group CLUW
did not call themselves
feminists they can be a very
strong arm for the women’s
movement. I left feeling
strength that comes with
being able to experience
women working together.

THE WOMEN’S INSTITUTE AT
THE UNIVERSITY OF
COLORADO, BOULDER, IS
SPONSORING A SEMINAR ON
EDUCATION JULY 29 THRU
AUGUST 10. THEY ARE IN NEED
OF WOMEN PERFORMERS
WHO COULD DONATE THEIR
TIME AND TALENT. ANY
WOMEN INTERESTED SHOULD
CONTACT CHRIS, 843 17TH ST.,
BOULDER.

CU to Offer 2-week
Institute on Women

Who is the American woman?
What is her history? Where is
she now? The opportunity to
explore this new research, to
connect it with contemporary
experience and future possi-
bility, will be available this
summer at the University of
Colorado, Boulder, during a
two-week Institute, July 29
through August 9.

The Institute will make an
intensive examination of the
myths and realities of women
in society. Its basic approach
will be sharing: the sharing of
ideas and information among
academic disciplines and the
sharing of experiences and
insights among students and
teachers. Participants should
find this orientation both
scholarly and congenial. Day
care will be provided for those
participants who bring child-
ren. For further information
write: Bureau of Conferences
and Institutes, Academy 217,
970 Aurora Avenue, University
of Colorado, Boulder, Colora-
do 80302. Or call Carol
Pearson at 443-2211.
