their productions. Wendy, too, did
not stay with them forever, and Julie,
Juliet, and Dinah were forced to think
of better ways of contacting the
women they wanted. Since they thought
that running an ad was an
odd way of contacting women, they
decided to cast a play. They hoped
that this way of reaching women
would hopefully bring out women who
are serious about acting.

They have often discussed what
sort of women they want to work with
and, while they love highly politi-
cal, talented actresses, they are
also open to working with someone
with no acting experience; who
“sparks" and has good politics.

What they absolutely need from a
collective member is a commitment to
work with them for at least one
year.

The play they had in mind was “Day
After Day," a play about the entire
oppressive structure of our judicial
system and in particular about a
woman who is coming up for parole.
This play will be performed on Octo-
ber 15 in Boulder at Womanspace,
938 Pearl St., at 8:00 pm. There will
also be a panel discussion about
women in prison. The play will be
performed also on October 8, 9, and
10 at Theater Lab West, 738 Santa Fe,
Denver at 8:00 pm. "Calm Down Mother"
by the feminist playwright Megan
Terry will also be on the program.

Juliet and Dinah are aware of some
political problems in "Day After Day."
Except for one Asian woman, the cast
is all Anglo which is certainly not
typical of prison populations. They
also hope that no one will take um-
brage at the portrayal of lesbianism
in the play.

Working on this play has gotten
both women more interested in getting
together with other women who
are working in that area, perhaps to
help raise money for an individual
woman's bail, or for important leg-
islation in the area.

On a political level, both women
define their politics strongly as
individuals but are not into having
the collective represent any set po-
litical line. The political message
is important, but life and art don't
always follow a political line, they
both agree. Dinah considers herself
more of a radical feminist than any
other label, but she isn't into la-

More personal solutions,

table laws allowing for the economic
independence of the displaced home-
maker--to access to professional indi-
vidual, marriage, and family counsel-
ing regardless of socio-economic sta-
tus.

6. Political Advancement. The right
to political representation propor-
tionate to her number in the popula-
tion--to unionize for increased mater-
nity/paternity benefits, increased
rights of the household worker, and
overall improvement of working condi-
tions--to lobby for better living
standards--to organize for equal
rights under the law--to promote and
establish a free forum for her ideas.

7. Civil/Criminal Justice. The
right to equal protection under the
law for her life, limb, and property--
to increased preventive measures to
secure her protection from sexual a-
buse.

8. Cultural Participation. The
right to full and equal participation
and access to egalitarian subsidy in
the arts and in sports and recrea-
tional activities--to full partici-
pation in the ceremonies and hierar-
chy of organized religion--to the
promotion of customs, mores, and
lifestyles free of race, sex, age,
and marital status bias.

9. Quality Child Care. The right
to comprehensive, educational, par-
ent-involved convenient child care
facilities inclusive of program dev-
elopment for the recognition, treat-
ment, and prevention of child abuse.

10. Individual Freedom. The right
to privacy of health, educational,
employment, tax, credit, and other
consumer records--to freedom to ex-
press her sexuality in private with
any consenting adult of her choosing.

labeling herself. Juliet has been po-
litically active for the last seven
years, and has seen much conflict
within the movement. She hopes to
avoid those same patterns. She used
to define men as the enemy and no
longer sees that as the political
Both women
want to combine their politics and
art in a blend that will hurt nei-
ther.

We spent some time talking about
a feminist art form and what that
entails. Dinah made the point that
when the content is specifically fe-
male, it affects and molds the form
itself. They talked about the play
"Calm Down Mother." It is about a
sea monster, and mothers and daugh-
ters, and transformations of the
mother-daughter relationship, about
eggs and ovaries within a fluid type
of form. It is a play that no man
could have written.

Juliet and Dinah are exploring new
directions for themselves and the
theater group these days. They are
tentatively working on using Joanna
Russ' science fiction novel Female
Man as the base for a work of their
own. They don't know yet what form
that might take. Juliet also trips
out on trying to use the rhythm and
tempo of labor as a framework for a
play.

Besides all of this, Dinah, as part
of her thesis project, is hoping to
put out a booklet on feminist theater
in this country. Hopefully, this will
help other groups to start, so that
they will not find themselves in the
same void that Juliet and Dinah felt
when they started.

This summer Juliet and Dinah went
back to Philadelphia for a confer-
ence, Theater Womanspace. While
they were able to observe and talk
with women's theater groups from
around the country, they expressed
dismay over the hesitation of some
groups and the conference planners
to call themselves feminists. As
Dinah so bluntly put it: "You can't
split that. You've got to go with
feminism or just say that you are an
experimental theater group. Well,
if you're going to say that you are
a women's theater, then you've got to
appeal to women who are into fas-
cinating womanhood courses...and
we're certainly not and that's why
we came up with the name that says
what we are. No mistakes about
that."

The question arose as to whether a
paper should ever edit for style or
whether it should only edit for con-
tent. Most women seemed to feel
that style editing is unfair to
writers while others felt that read-
ers should be assured of well written
material and that the value of
a good editor should not be under-
rated. The need for constant and
honest communications between writ-
ers and editors was seen as para-
mount.

The other topic that aroused a
good deal of dialogue throughout the
week was the issue of the politics
of structure. One full morning of
workshops, in fact, was dedicated
to the subject. At the beginning
of the day each newspaper involved
took 15 minutes to describe its
structure. Following this the po-
litical implications of structure
were discussed.

Participants talked about ways of
avoiding hierarchies and staff burn-
out. Sharing skills so as to eli-
minate a power-by-knowledge hierar-
chy and the idea of structuring
“time off" were given as possible
solutions to these problems. Ways

favor a program even more refore-
oriented than the Communists. And
the Communists themselves are contin-
ually under attack by the "extra-
parliamentary" left (technically that
term is outdated since the June 20
election when the extreme left coal-
ition Democrazia Proletaria gained 6
seats in Parliament and the civil
rights oriented group Partito Radi-
cale, 4) for what are considered com-
promising tactics in dealing with the
Christian Democrats and the status
quo.

How many Americans have been swept away?
American moviegoers are not accus-
tomed to political situations--Ameri-
can, Italian or otherwise--being op-
enly discussed on the screen. Wert-
muller's style is sophisticated and
flashy; it dazzles. The color and
composition of her images overwhelm.
The pace leads you along at break-
neck speed. Side-tracked by the
force of such cinematic know-how,
viewers might see Mimi's Sicilian
machismo and cop-out on his co-worker's, or the class-sex war between
Gennarino and Raffaela as bold and
masterful synthesis of the political
and private.

But a closer look reveals the pol-
itics of these films to be shrewd ma-
nipulation of popular “in" notions
about how cinema could or should be
socially concerned, politically com-
mitted. Wertmuller makes an anti-
hero out of a proletarian underdog
and still manages to arrive at poli-
tically conservative conclusions.

Americans have considered Italy's
critical rejection of Wertmuller's
work either as an enormous oversight,
a bizarre case of cultural myopia or
as the result of some national inab-
ility to accept a negative image of
themselves.

But it's more likely the case that
America is suffering from a lack in
political perspective that makes it
easy to be taken in--from the left
as well as dead center--by the fril-
liance of a highly polished and well
packaged product.

Library of Congress recording distri-
buted by Rounder Records and the ot-

Songs and Stories of Aunt Molly
Jackson."

Her sole commercial recording was
“Kentucky Miner's Wife" ("Hungry

Agnes Sis Cunningham, one of the
original Almanac singers who knew
Aunt Molly, has included a song writ-
ten for Molly Jackson on a newly
released album, "Sundown." The song's
title, "But If I Ask Them," comes
from a letter she wrote just
before her death. The liner notes
in the album (Folkways FH5319) con-
tain the text of Aunt Molly's last
letter.
