On Myths, History and Tradition

Double Distortions Burden Black Women

Until quite recently, Afro-
American people had been
denied their history or even
worse, had/have been subject-
ed to history books and socio-
logical and anthropological trea-
tises filled with distortions and
lies either by commission or om-
ission. The past ten years, how-
ever, have witnessed a revolt on
the part of Afro-Americans
against this continuing racist in-
doctrination.

All across the nation, African
and Afro-American studies pro-
grams have blossomed. Much
good work has been done by his-
torians and other scholars in
bringing to light our legitimate
past, and providing numerous
examples of both individual and
collective struggles with which
we can proudly identify.

Unfortunately, in relation to
the black woman, the old myths
and distortions are all too often
still prevalent, even among black
scholars. While it is generally
agreed that the black woman
has played important roles and is
expected to continue to do so,
what is quite distressing is the
fact that whatever role we play,
it is assumed that it will be a role
secondary to the black male. The
backward ideas that are so pre-
valent among certain nation-
alist forces concerning the black
woman are extremely divisive to
the overall struggle for social
justice and economic equality in
this country. Many black women
are turned off by the blatant
male chauvinist attitudes exhib-
ited by their brothers, and be-
come totally frustrated and dis-
illusioned with so-called
revolutionary organizations.

ever been free in this country are

Black Woman’ Examines Feminism

Angela Wilson

As black women activists, it is
extremely necessary for us to
ally ourselves with a cause close
to our own, or in some way to
develop a new analysis of the
multi-layered nature of oppres-
sion in this society. In this article
I will attempt to examine the
relevance to us of two con-
temporary social movements,
black liberation and feminism, in
the hopes of determining which
one will actively move to change
our horrifying collective reality.

Though not necessarily repre-
sentative of all the groups
engaged in the black struggle,
the Black Panther Party will
serve as an example for many
reasons: its leaders and
members were highly visible to
the public eye, the ideology was
dedicated to change in the U.S.
(as compared to some groups
which agitated for a return to the
mainland Africa), and above all,
its programs and ideology were
the most developed of any
organization of the kind. Yet how
really revolutionary was the BPP
in its ideology and its views of
women?

In embracing a Maoist form of
Marxism, an analysis that was
tailored to fit the needs of main-
land China, the Black Panther
Party did not realize the inherent
differences in the stages of
technological advancement
alone between China and the
United States. China's popu-
lation has a greater homo-
geneity than that of the U.S., and
does not reflect a background of
slavery, land acquisition or
military aggression of this coun-
try, either. There has never been
a country whose development
parallels that of the United
States, nor any past revolution
from which a blueprint can be
drawn.

Another major drawback to
the utilization of a Maoist Marx-
ist philosophy for change in

white men and black women.”

“A matriarchal family struc-
ture exists in the black com-
munity.”

America is the assumption that a
nuclear family structure is the
cornerstone of society. Though
this was a great advancement
for post-liberation China (due to
the fact that the power of the
extended family patriarch was
taken away; he could no longer
sell the women of the family to

pay off debts or for profit, nor

could he pre-arrange the
marriage situations of those in
his power), the oppressive
nature of this structure can
easily be seen in our own
society, which has evolved in
ways so dissimilar to China’s.

In this way the

support to many inner-city
blacks; free food programs,

The feminist movement has
provided no workable economic
analysis. The importance of the
development of a feminist
analysis of the economic system
in America cannot be over-
emphasized. Until this analysis
is developed, the acceptance of
feminism as the basis of revolu-
tionary change cannot be a fully
viable solution to those in a
struggle for bare survival.

What to do during the interim?
First, we should develop a more
realistic understanding of the
differences that exist between
women. There are such things
as white skin privilege,
handicaps due to poor education
and class differences. These
cannot be hidden, glossed over
or taken lightly: they are a
reality. We must instead develop
an honesty about these matters,
and engage in the active, ongo-
ing process of examining our
part in them. We must learn to
share in every conceivable way
the knowledge which we have
gained from our separate life
experiences.

Secondly, we must realize that
we are about shaping a new
world. Anything else will not do.
The seriousness of our respon-
sibilities, to ourselves and to

babies for the revolution.”

These are but a few of the
common misconceptions and
distortions that continue to
plague the black woman and the
black struggle as a whole. Part of
the development which must be
seen for black people, therefore, is a better understanding of
the history of Afro-American
women and the role they have
played throughout our history in
this country.

Since her arrival on these
alien shores, the black woman
has been subjected to the worst
kinds of exploitation and op-
pression. As a black, she has had
to endure all the horrors of slav-
ery and living in a racist society;
as a worker, she has been the
object of continual exploitation,
occupying the lowest place on
the whole wage scale and re-
stricted to the most demeaning,
uncreative jobs; as a woman she
has seen her physical image de-
famed, and been the object of
the white master’s uncontroll-
able lust and subjected to the
ideal of white womanhood as a
model to which she should
aspire; as a mother, she has
seen her children torn from her
breast and sold into slavery, she
has seen them left at home with-
out attention while she attended
to the needs of the offspring
of the ruling class.

Today, the Afro-American
woman sees her children af-
flicted with dope addiction, and
the lack of a decent education;
subjected to attack by a racist so-
ciety complete with legal lynch-
ings; used as cannon fodder for
America’s imperialist wars;
populating prisons of the nation,
etc. In addition, besides suffer-
ing the common fate of all op-

others, is a fact we are only
beginning to realize. It is high
time we make good our commit-
ment to change and move in
every possible way to achieve
our goal.

pressed and exploited people,
the Afro-American woman con-
tinues to experience the age-old
oppression of woman by man. In
the home, she becomes “slave
of a slave.” By giving men a false
feeling of superiority in the
home or in relationships with
women, she alleviates certain
aspects of capitalist tension.
Men may be more cruelly ex-
ploited and subjected to all sorts
of dehumanizing tactics on the
part of the ruling class, but at
least they can take out their frus-
trations on someone else —
their women.

Two strains run through black
history that we might mention
here — accommodation and re-
sistance. While there have been
blacks who have tried to come to
terms with the capitalist system
and have struggled to enter that
system on an equal basis with
whites, the major thread that
runs through Afro-American
history has been the thread of
resistance. It is in this area that
the important role of the black
woman can be seen. The Civil
Rights movement, the black
rebellions in cities and the blos-
soming militant black organiza-
tions provided women with the
basic opportunity to continue to
struggle against injustices in
this country. Women of all na-
tionalities were inspired to take
a more militantly active part in
political struggles.

And this tradition continues
today. You will find black women
in the midst of all the ongoing
struggles against racism, re-
pression and exploitation in this
country.
