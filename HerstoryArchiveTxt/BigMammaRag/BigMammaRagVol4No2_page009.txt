This article is written by one
white feminist to explain to
some degree the connection be-
tween racism and sexism in our
culture and their manifesta-
tions in our country’s foreign
policy. The idea of power poli-
tics expressed in it are not meant
to be an exact analysis of his-
tory, but a general trend of the
patriarchy.

Scene: circa 1934. The south-
ern countryside. A small nine
year old black girl views a lynch-
ing. The Ku Klux Klan hangs a
very pregnant black woman and
rips the fetus from her body amid
laughter.

Scene: circa 1970. The south
Vietnamese countryside. A
small nine year old Vietnamese
girl witnesses the very same de-
struction of her mother and her
unborn sibling amid the laughter
of American G.I.s.

Scene: circa 1975. Denver. A
black BMR staff person is al-
most raped coming home from
work late one night, amid the
laughter of empty streets. Later
in the same day she cannot cash
her personal check at the local
drugstore while a white woman
has no trouble doing the same.

What are the origins of these
crimes? The common root of the
blatant sexist and racist atroci-
ties is the power politics of the
patriarchy. The political and psy-
chological underpinnings of
such events are the subject of
this exploration into the patri-
archy. Hopefully this will be a be-
ginning to a feminist solution of
such nightmares.

To search out the roots of
power relationships, we need
to move back into prehistoric
times and imagine the situation
of our forebears. Shulamith Fire-
stone in The Dialectic of Sex de-
picts a tribal society of primitive
men and women faced with the
basic biological dilemma — sur-
vival in a scarcity environment.
Women began bearing children
from the onset of puberty until
death, which was probably in
their early twenties. The result-
ing weakness and incapacita-
tion of our early mothers made it
biologically necessary for men to

This is a conversation be-
tween two friends, one black,
one white, that I recorded for this
issue of BUR.

My friend, who for her job’s
sake wants to be known here
just as V., is a black woman. She
came from a very poor family in a
city slum. With luck, persis-
tence, and intelligence, she
made it through college, and
now holds degrees in sociology,
teaching, and a high-status,
high-paying job that requires her
to be around mainly middle-
class white people most of the
time. We talked about that:

K: Do you feel pulled in two?

V: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. I
can deal with it better now, but
there was a time in college when
I went through a suicidal de-
pression. I was losing my own
culture, my identity, and didn’t
really belong to the other one.
College opened a lot of doors, but
also shut doors for me. Like
when I go back to the neighbor-
hood, I had to become super-
sensitive — afraid of hurting
black people's feelings because I
have a college degree. Anything
I say about them, any comment
I make — can be interpreted as a
putdown. It’s a dilemma. For 23
years of my life I was totally
black, then going to college,
learning to speak the main cul-
ture language — and coming out

protect and defend them. It must
have been quite early that these
men, in wonder and fear of the
unknown magical process of
woman's bodily rhythm, began
to devalue these unknown
spirits in a blind attempt to com-
pensate for their own interiority
and lack of creativity. While fer-
tility goddesses were wor-
shipped, men rapidly began to
develop a male cultural system
that valued hunting and the
male bonding need for that hunt.

The first subordination of
a group of people was the
encasement of women.

To be male and not physically
encumbered with young rapidly
became the norm for “human-
ity.” The resulting cultural and
political systems stem from this
basic devaluation of woman and
her situation. Woman soon
came to be defined as “other,”
the physically different one, “the
inferior,” “unknown” and “dan-
gerous” one. Man defined him-
self as having power, control and
ownership of ‘the different
one.” His projects in the world,
the hunt, male rituals and the
cultural expressions of his self-
appointed primacy became the

here to Denver — all these de-
mands . . . and then when I go
home I leave that language be-
hind. I get down with the folks.
It's difficult, it's damn difficult.
Sometimes I just feel like hiding

somewhere, cause I'm getting
this pressure, you know, from
both sides. Damned if you do and
damned if you don’t, That's what
it boils down to.

K: I am a white woman. I came
from a middle-class, liberal
family with a heavy emphasis on
intellectual stuff and integra-
tion. I inherited a fine case of
white liberal guilt, which is

Racism and the Patriarchy

roots of the patriarchy of today.

Though there were probably
groups of egalitarian nature and
periods of matriarchal history,
this was the dominant trend and
the most pervasive system of
politics, probably because of its
biological/psychological roots.

Thus, the first property, the
first subordination of a group of
people was the encasement of
woman. Because of their physi-
cal make-up, women are owned,
dehumanized and devalued, as
well as being pawns in ‘the
power plays of men. This first
taste of power over another
group of people is the psycho-
logical state necessary for all
forms of authoritarianism. The
particular political and cultural
expression of power politics vary
from culture to culture, but all
these variations are grounded in
the primordial enslavement of
women.

Men see woman as property,
an inferior “other.” If woman is
bad then man is automatically
good and thus relieved of his
sense of inferiority, his inability
to bear children. More import-
antly, he doesn’t have to make
an aesthetic place for himself in
the world through his own crea-
tive projects. He can be God if he

can control the She-Devil
Woman. A man is better propor-
tionally to the number of women
he can control. The ego-cen-
tered male increases his false
sense of grandeur by controlling
all the women of his tribe.
He becomes a chief. Here is the
start of political hierarchy. The
next step is to control other

tribes, who by definition consist
of lesser men — anyone differ-
ent than the ego-centered male.
Here begins the concept of
racism. If a man is powerful con-
trolling his wife as well as
women in his tribe, the sub-
jugation of other powerful men’s
women and their property be-
comes the ultimate in power and
glory. Hence the development of
war. There were, of course, ma-
terial reasons — lack of water,
violations of hunting grounds
that caused violence among
early men — but the patriarchal
psycho/political values both
justified and transcended the
physical necessity of violence.

Racism cannot be truly
eradicated until the sex-
ist notion of power over
another is analyzed and
programs developed to
eliminate all authoritar-
ian political structures.

The Sanskrit word for war
means “acquiring more cows.”
The intrusion of another man’s
domain was justified by de-
fining the other tribe as innately
evil. The other tribe's physical
differences, such as longer
noses, different hair color and
texture or possibly strangely dif-
ferent rituals became — like the
evil woman's breasts and re-
productive organs — accepted
signs of inferiority. Through

actual tests of strength (war),
entire races became subju-
gated. Cultural and racial myths,
backed by military, political and
economic power, make the pre-
sent genocidal war in Vietnam a
direct descendant of early man’s
need to “acquire more cows.”

The only authentic way to
be a woman or a person
of color is to revolt.

Each woman and any mem-
ber of a racial minority is sub-
jected to degrading incidents.
When a male state consciously
organizes its sexism and racism,
the result is genocide: the nine
million witches burned by the
Church, the six million Jews
killed by Nazis; the four million
Vietnamese killed by Ameri-
cans and their puppets. What is
the use of all this brutality? Who
directly benefits from this type of
insanity? At this point in history,
white ruling class men do. They
need the cheap labor of women
and racial minorities, as well as
the entire resources of the third
world to keep their power mania
well fed. The primary way all
white ruling class men keep
their property in line is by hori-
zontal hostility: the intense
hatred of the oppressed for each
other. Horizontal hostility is the
psychological weapon used to
keep the vast majority of the
world population under control.
This intense psychological war-
fare utilizes energy which could

be used in revolt if directed to-
wards the real oppressor. In
stead, the burned up energy
used in inter-group hostility
eliminates the need for vast
armies to put down revolts. To
the oppressor, horizontal hostil-
ity is cheap. Civil war is not.
The process of horizontal hos-
tility goes something like this:
Women hate each other in the
heated battle to marry a protec-
tor, a high status white male.
Racial minorities hate one
another and do violence to them-
selves (as with crime in the
ghetto), or blame each other for
their lack of power (the castrat-
ing bitch as the cause of the
black males’ lack of “man-
hood”). Notice the real source of
oppression is never identified
correctly. White ruling class
males need black and other
minority mates to fight each
other over scarce jobs, govern-
ment crumbs, money or over
women. According to the ruling
class script, black women should
hate white women for “having it
or chasing after their
black men, or a million other
supposed differences (such as
lesbianism) — anything to avoid
identifying the real oppressor.

The common root of sex-
ist and racist atrocities is
the power politics of the
patriarchy.

It is legitimate for black and
other minority women to see
their most immediate emer-
gency situation being that of
race. Racism is the most blatant
way of wiping out women of
color. Yet, as shown above, the
primary basis of all power rela-
tionships, the raison d'être of all
class, caste and racial oppres-
sion stems from the male's sub-
jugation of the female. Racism
cannot be truly eradicated until
the sexist notion of power over
another is analyzed and pro-
grams developed to eliminate all
authoritarian political struc-
tures, i.e., the destruction of the
patriarchy in all its facets.

When a male state con-
sciously organizes its
sexism and racism, the
result is genocide.

A sketch of a world without
power relationships would be
something like the following:

The creativity of each individual
would be encouraged: no defin-
ing one’s self off another's in-
feriority. Each person from birth
would be encouraged to be a
self-reflexive, thinking, feeling
human being. There would be
dignity because s/he exists. Nor
would there be sexual or gender
roles predicated on the power
relationship of male versus female.
Honors and achievements
would be earned by individual
effort; every child would have
the basic necessities from birth,
regardless of the status or race
of her biological parent(s). Egal-
itarian living arrangements be-
tween adults and children would
form the psycho/social basis in
political and economic spheres.
Class division and imperialistic
ventures would be unthinkable
due to the deep, solid grounding
in each individual psyche of
equal and free relationships
with others.

One way to progress toward
such a society would be to instill
in ourselves and our children
images of women and racial
minorities. Radical political or-
ganizations comprising women
and racial minorities have formed
in the last decade to demand
power and control of their own
lives from the patriarchy. Hope-
fully in this next decade equal at-
tention will be given to the in-
ternal politics of these groups, to
eliminate power plays and male
supremacist priorities and atti-
tudes from their program.

The rape (notice the apt sex-
ploitation metaphor) of the world
for the resources of her peoples
(as in Vietnam, Puerto Rico,
Africa and South America) are
the grossest manifestations of
the male power syndrome.
Some sectarian socialist groups
pit feminists against anti-imper-
ialist Third World groups. How-
ever, there is a natural and pro-
found alliance between women
and all peoples struggling for
their freedom. The only authen-
tic way to be a woman or a per-
son of color is to revolt.

We, as individual women,
should personally inform our-
selves of other racial groups'
histories; we should personally
confront racial slurs with as

Woman Discusses Cost of Success in Middle-Class Society

something I am still constantly
dealing with. I think a lot of white
women are very afraid of being
thought racist, and so they over-
compensate and be extra nice to
black people. Either way it’s not

taking people as individuals.
K: I guess I don’t have the prob-
lem you have, of feeling be-
tween two worlds, because the
culture I live, breathe, eat, sleep,
read and see on TV is the main
culture, as you call it, and al-
though there may be things that
attract me about black and other
cultures, I don’t have to adapt to
their ways, speak a language I
don't know, or alienate myself
from my own culture in order to
make a better life for myself. I
guess that’s what people are
talking about when they speak of
the “privilege” of being born
white and middle class.

V: The main culture sets defini-
tions for modes of conduct. And
they decide what they want to
accept from the subcultures, and
when they want to accept it.

K: Like now when you have the
old blues singers, Billie Hol-
iday, Bessie Smith, suddenly
fashionable again, and white
kids picking up and using the
ghetto terms that aren't hip any-
more in the ghetto, and white
people making a lot of money off
of films like “Shaft”?

V: Whereas poor and lower class
folks get main culture defini-
tions and values shoved down
their throats, whether they like it
or not, via TV and other media.

K: What are some examples of
cultural and language differ-
ences between blacks and
whites?

V: Let's say between poor folks
and middle-class. Poor folks
seek and receive immediate
gratification.

K: Isn't that true of main culture
too?

V: Okay, but I'm talking about in
how they relate. Look here. With
white folks, or main culture
people, you tell them something
and more often than not they
won't react to it. You can't tell
what they're feeling because
they're not honest about their
feelings. They'll take it home and
analyze it and dissect it and think
it over and confront you with it
later or keep a grudge. Now with
the people I grew up with, they
lay it on the line right then and
there. They just put the shit out
on the table and deal with it.
Whereas with main culture, it’s

a matter of thought processes
that can go on and on. Like when
I went home for Christmas, this
old dude tried to put the make on
me. First I said to him, "Would
you please leave me alone?” He
kept bothering me, and I said,
“Why the fuck don't you leave
me alone, motherfucker?” and
that put an end to it.

Another cultural difference is
the one you and I have hassled
with before. It has to do with
giving, and attitudes about
money. With my people, when
you've got it, you share what you
have. And you expect the same
from the person you're sharing it
with. You take care of your own.
And when you do have money,
hell, you don’t save it. You blow
it. But like with you, I buy you a
ticket to the movies and right
away you're going, “I can't af-
ford that. I've got to pay her back.
Where's the string attached?
What does she want from me?”
and all that shit. It seems like
with your culture, you weigh
everything. You keep account
down to the last cent of who
owes what to who.
K: That's really true. And it's
hard for me to change that all of
a sudden because that's what I
grew up with.

A lot of white women, espe-
cially feminists, are turning their
backs now on men, male cul-
ture and politics. They're trash-
ing the values and standards
which have been set by white
men. But you, and many black
women still identify strongly
with black men. Why is that?

V: I can't speak for all black
women. I don’t know. But for my
self, I feel that yes, you do have
to support black men. All this op-
pression from the outside and
here you come, threatening
them too. Because he has so
much hatred and fear directed at
him already.

K: Maybe white women see
their oppression coming from
the white men that hold power in
