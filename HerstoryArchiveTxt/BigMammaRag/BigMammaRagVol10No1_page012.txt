Shock

The Mental/Medical Health
System operates to hide its
mistakes in the name of profit.
Many now refer to a present
"renaissance" in the use
of ECT; and to cover a little
“bad press" we run into a me-
dia campaign like the one in-
dicated by this article. It
hits me sort of like when I
heard on the network news that
"men can suffer from Toxic
Shock Syndrome too" like it
erases the deaths of too many
women. All it takes is a few
new studies, a balanced sta-
tistic and the Health Systems
effectively dismiss its cr-
itics. The work of the Net-
work Against Psychiatric As-
sault (NAPA); which has been
working for patients' rights
since 1974, was just this eas-
ily dismissed in Mauk's art-
icle. Dismissal comes easy
when "science" confronts the
"questionable testimony of a
few ex-mental patients" whose
opinions differ from those of
the shrinks.

In viewing this article in
the pages of Cosmopolitan the
other thing that is striking,
not just that Mauk's article
was especially awful, but also
that it is in fact no depar-
ture from the ongoing image of
psychology/psychiatry presen-
ted on an ongoing basis in
the columns of "armchair
shrinks" like Dr. Appleton who
writes his monthly "Ann Ans-
wers" type column in Cosmopo-
litan. Appleton's new book
Fathers and Daughters unfolds
his belief that it takes a wo-
man three decades to come to
understand and come to terms
with the complexities of the
father-daughter attachment.

Further, “Surprising Truths
About Shock Treatment" is no
departure from the "Cosmopoli-

from page 7

tan woman" (traditionally
beautiful, seductive; success-
ful, sensual--you know Wonder
Woman) that is peddled on ev-
ery page of the journal. NAPA
quotes Dr. Peter Breggin, an
ECT critic saying, “More women
are given ECT because they are
judged to have less need of
their brains." The perfect
woman passive and mindless,
ECT to the rescue!?

This pro-shock media cam-
paign is not an isolated inci-
dent/accident. The psychiatric
system has been at work not
only improving the public re-
sponse towards ECT, but also
towards lobotomy/psychosurgery
and psychiatric drugging.
Since a study appearing in
1976, through the National
Commission for the Protection
of Human Subjects advocating
psychosurgery, there has been
an ongoing campaign to loosen
the restrictions on psychosur-
gery. The Commission stating
that psychosurgery should not
be "denied" to involuntary
mental patients, prisoners,
or even children. Psychosur-
geons, in essence, controlled
the results of this study by
hand-picking the cases to be
studied. Under a commission to
protect human rights the voi-
ces of current and ex-inmates,
and the questionable basis for
the commission's findings are
disregarded. And finally, with
the exception of one, the
commission members were high-
paid medical and legal pro-
fessionals who would $profit$
from any resumption of mass
psychosurgery.

The Dept. of Health and Hu-
man Services (HHS) rejected
the commission's contention
that psychosurgery on involun-
tary patients, prisoners and

children was permissible, and

yet, the proposed legislation
coming from HHS is even more
favorable to psychosurgery.
HHS proposed that Medicaid/
Medicare fund psychosurgery,
bringing it out of the realm
of the experimental--into the
routine. While verbally sup-
porting a set of “stringent
procedural safeguards", the
proposed system of "local peer
review” has already been pro-
ved ineffective. Psychosurgeon
Peter Lindstrom stated that
the review boards at his hospi-
tal “decided that there was
no reason for the lobotomy
committee to review my cases
because my treatment seemed so
safe" requiring only consensus
from another shrink. It gives
me nightmare visions of all
women, poor women, women of
color--forcibly sterilized/
no right to abortion--loboto-
mized to deal with the poverty
prejudice...all that burden
of oppression... that makes
"madness" out of daily strug-
gles to survive.

Issues of incarceration in
mental institutions and pri-
sons require an examination of
the forces of “social control"
in our society/in our world.
The mental institution serving
as a political prison is a
reality--a prison additionally
supported by the invisible
bars of ECT, lobotomy/psycho-
surgery and psychotropic
drugs. The psychiatric system
is a dangerous enemy to the
liberation of women and all
peoples. It is as connected to
the horrors of the prisons,
the continued patriarchal sup-
port of violence against women,
the colonization of third
world peoples, the continued
push of racism and classism
by a capitalist system as any
other institutionalized system

for all these have a system
of shared support, each needs
the other. The underlying as-
sumptions of the psychiatric
system, like all others which
deny the humanity of people
on the basis of race, class,
or religion, believe that some
people are better, more sane,
more worthy than others. Men-
talism occurs when people pre-
judge or devalue the opinions
or efforts of others based
solely on their status as cur-
rent or former psychiatric in-
mates. The “why bother, just
forget about it" attitude is
a mentalistic invalidation of
the genuine anger toward the
mental health system felt by
many psychiatric patients and
former patients. 

At the 1981 annual meeting
of the American Psychiatric
Association, Dr. R. Lamb warn-
ed his cohorts that the pa-
tients' rights movement may be
dangerous, urging that mea-
sures be taken to monitor and
set limits on the patients'
rights movement...in order to
protect our patients. Owner-
ship through analysis...the
Freudian family. Feminism
must be a part of the direct
response to this growing en-
dorsement of psychiatric tor-
ture. The patients' rights
movement must be dangerous,
dangerous and deadly to those
that carry the keys to our
freedom.
