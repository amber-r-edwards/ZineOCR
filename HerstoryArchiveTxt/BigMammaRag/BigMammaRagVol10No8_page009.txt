Prison Deaths

On July 1, inmate Scheryll  
Hocking died after suffering  
a massive heart attack at the  
California Institution for  
Women. Superintendent Sylvia  
Johnson received the phone  
message from the cottage  
where Scheryll was housed;  
she yelled at the head of  
the medical staff to respond,  
but he never did. Johnson  
had to order the nursing staff  
to start treatment because  
the medical staff was hyster-  
ical and the nurses had re-  
fused to enter the room. It  
was a while before an oxygen  
tank was located, and then it  
was empty. The first ambulance  
that arrived had neither an  
oxygen tank nor a paramedic.  
Another had to be called.

Inmates believe that inmate  
Hocking may have had a bet-  
ter chance at surviving the  
heart attack if the prison  
administration would have act-  
ed in a more competent way,  
and sooner, to complaints a-  
bout the poor medical facili-  
ties and treatment.

And More...

A demonstration at Purdy  
Women's Prison (WA) on June 13  
sponsored by Friends and Fam-  
ily of Prisoners at Purdy,  
called for an independent  
outside investigation into  
the deaths of Toni Holmes,  
and Phyllis Riches, inmates  
who have recently died. The  
demonstrators feel that the  
public has been misled and  
not given the facts concern-  
ing the alleged suicides.  
There are conflicting stories  
from the administration, press  
staff, and inmates; and evi-  
dence of a lack of medical  
care in the case of Holmes,  
who had been in pain and not  
eating for three days before  
her death.

Zip Zip Hooray!

When Talon Zipper shut down  
last winter, some of the work-  
ers started organizing a work-  
er-owned and operated busi-  
ness. They got their initial  
spark from visiting the Work-  
er Owned Sewing Co., and have  
been working with Twin  
Streams for the educational  
work, Legal Services for org-  
anizational help, and the  
Center for Community Self-  
Help for legal and financial  
guidance. The Woodland, N.C.  
business hopes to be operat-  
ing by October.

No Comment

A woman brought a private  
prosecution in the Scottish  
courts after the refusal of  
the Law Office to bring to  
trial three men accused of  
raping and mutilating her in  
1980. Supposedly the decision  
not to prosecute was taken on  
medical advice that the trial  
would be damaging to the wo-  
man's health.

The judge's statement said  
"If a woman voluntarily con-  
sumes alcohol to such an ex-  
tent as to be virtually in-  
sensible, it is not rape to  
have intercourse with such  
a woman, just as it is not  
rape to have intercourse with  
a sleeping woman."

Who Defines?

On Sept. 16 a San Mateo Co,  
California court will hold  
final proceedings in a child  
custody case stemming from the  
government-sanctioned kidnap-  
ping of Tina Fishman's 10-yr  
old daughter Riva. Tina is  
one of the Mao Tsetung Defend-  
ants and a proletarian inter-  
nationalist. The government  
has leveled a vicious politi-  
cal and ideological message  
at this growing movement, and  
this case further represents  
an attack against all women  
who dare to become politically  
active.

The judge admitted that he  
found no evidence of any “neg-  
lect as usually defined" and  
that Riva was "unquestionably  
well cared-for." BUT, Tina  
was found unfit to raise Riva  
because she has “interests  
other than parenting.”

Dyke Patrol?

Cagney & Lacey, a CBS-TV  
series about two New York Ci-  
ty Policewomen, is being  
revised because the two main  
characters were seen as "too  
harshly women's lib," accord-  
ing to CBS research. "These  
women seemed more intent on  
fighting the system than do-  
ing police work. We perceived  
them as dykes."

Fucker!

The head of Spokane, WA's  
Rape Squad received only a  
verbal reprimand from the ci-  
ty's Chief of Police after  
he wore a t-shirt which said  
"Lay Back & Enjoy It."

Southern Justice

Charlene Mitchell, executive  
secretary of the National Al-  
liance Against Racist and Pol-  
itical Repression, and her  
husband Mike Welch were found  
guilty of public drunkenness  
and obstructing an officer,  
in a 5-day trial by a jury of  
11 whites and 1 Black, in  
Gainesville, GA. The charges  
came out of an incident where  
Mitchell, Welch, and three  
other Alliance activists were  
returning from New Orleans  
to New York. Welch, who is  
white, was seriously injured  
and both he and Mitchell,  
who is Black, were jailed.

During the trial, over 100  
law enforcement officers sur-  
rounded the courthouse, including  
FBI, GBI (Georgia Bureau of  
Investigation), state troopers  
and city and county police.  
The case is on appeal.

Union W.A.G.E.

UNION W.A.G.E., an 11-year  
old working women's newspaper  
will not be printed anymore.  
Two of their projects, House-  
hold Workers Rights and Cler-  
ical Health and Safety will  
continue.

W.A.G.E., a non-profit or-  
ganization felt the squeeze  
of Reaganomics both through  
grants and the contributions  
of women workers who are  
feeling the pinch in the  
rising costs of living, and  
the lack of women supporting  
the paper.

Women are finding the most  
depressed economy since the  
30's with union busting a  
common practice and trying to  
organize unions a hazardous  
task. Plant closings, poor  
unemployment and welfare  
benefits threaten every work-  
er.

Community Defense

In England, 12 Black people  
(the Bradford 12) had been  
on trial for conspiracy  
to make explosive substances  
with intent to endanger life  
and property. The trial  
lasted 31 days, and the  
people proved that blatant  
racism and police abuse made  
it necessary for the commun-  
ity to arm itself.

AND THEY WON!!
