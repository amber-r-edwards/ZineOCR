‘These stories are about working
women whose daily lives are marked by
their encounters with evil. Ruth Geller's
people are so real, so “ordinary,” that
their heroism stuns me, and I am
grateful to her for the quiet compassion
with which she does the writer's job.”

P.O. BOX 93
BUFFALO, N.Y. 14213

A novel that reflects the women's
movement with honesty and passion.
There are no gimmicks to this book. The
process of “coming to terms” with
women's liberation for three main
characters is what the book is all about:
and this is what makes Seed of a
Woman more than a documented
history of women’s personal, and
ultimately political change. The women
in the book are all around us — and are
us — still discovering by trial and error
the right answers to many of our
questions. The visions and images of
these women are those of today. The
writing in Seed of a Woman is clear, the
dialogue realistic, and the story leaves
an impact that won't go away. Read this
book.”
