Hard Questions

Sisters,

I found your fundraising
letter while wading through
the piles of paper that have
accumulated on my desk and it
has given me the impetus to
make some delayed response to
BMR.

First is a small check (a
reflection on my economic si-
tuation) and a thank you for
the service I think BMR pro-
vides to the women's movement.
As an anti-imperialist woman,
I deeply appreciate the stru-
ggles that BMR opens up in
its pages. I may not agree
with everything you say (and
who does?) but I don't think
we can build a successful wo-
men's movement without asking
ourselves some hard questions
about how imperialism works
and how to destroy it. BMR
does try to do that and it
helps me feel that my strug-
gles as a woman are deeply co-
mnected to forces and upheav-
als that extend far beyond
"the women's community."

I have felt pretty critical
about the racism/anti-semit-
ism issues. I won't go into
all the ifs, ands or buts be-

cause I can see from your let-

ters, pages and editorials
that much of it has already
been said. I am deeply con-
cerned that the women's move-
ment is moving to equalize
anti-semitism and racism, not
because I think anti-semitism
doesn't exist (obviously it
does) but because it so ob-
viously doesn't play the same
role in keeping this system
going. I'm also disturbed at
the tendency to uncritically
accept Israel as legitimate
because the Jews deserve a
homeland. We must be critic-
al of a government that
stands side by side with So-
moza, Duarte, South Africa;
that exists on the suffering
and oppression of another na-
tion of people. There is no
justification for that. I
noticed you reprinted the ar-
ticle from Connexions about
immigrant women in Britain,
but I think it would be more
to the point to reprint "The
Land of Milk & Honey," from
the same issue. This article
is a chronology of how Israel
came to be, how it has been

a part of British & US Imp-
erialism throughout its his-
tory and what its existence
has meant to the Palestinian
people who were driven from

their land. These are facts
that cannot be ignored and

no amount of anti-semitism or
relating to our roots will
make them go away.

I was also critical of the
fact that in two issues about
racism, I don't think you ever
really got down to dealing
with the situation of Black
people in the U.S. The Brinks
Expropriation could have pro-
vided an opportunity but in-
stead, the issue focused on
how this will bring down rep-
ression on the women's commun-
ity. Repression is something
we have to deal with as a
movement, but face it--most
repression from Nyack will
center on Black liberation
forces and those who ally with
them in a serious way. I

Through the Looking Glass

think the real question for
the women's movement around
this is why were these people
doing this? Why have these
Black people seen their situ-
ation as so desperate it can
only be defined as war? If
they are right, what does
that mean that we should do
about it? I'm sending this
copy of a statement made by
Assata Shakur a year ago be-
cause it speaks so concretely
and clearly about what mot-
ivates the BLA to carry out
actions like Nyack, why they
say they are at war with A-
merica. You may well have
seen this already, but I wan-

ted to make sure. I think
reprinting all or part of it
would go a long way in clar-
ifying what the significance
and urgency of racism is in
the US today. I think that
at one point the New African
Women's Organization was ask-
ing people not to reprint it

without their permission,
(Assata sent it to them), but
their address is in the back
of the pamphlet and you can
check with them.

I guess I could go on and
on, but this was meant to be
a note, not a letter. I hope
the feedback helps. I feel
these are crossroad times for
many of us--certainly they
are for me. Times get tough-
er, contradictions get sharp-
er, we need to get rid of our
excess baggage and get right
to the material and spiritual
hearts of the matter. It
sure doesn't look easy.

Pissed Off

Dear Big Mama,

A few of the letters in
the December '81 issue really
pissed me off. To Mary from
Massachusetts: who cares that
a woman is on the Supreme
Court! She supports all the
positions of the men who rule
this empire. Being a woman
does not necessarily mean
caring about women's strug-
gles and needs. Look at Mayor
Dianne Feinstein. She's pat-
riarchal and upper class, and
I miss Mayor Moscone.

To Elyria of Ohio who re-
marked, "If there is so much
wrong with other women, why
be a feminist." No trashing.
No anger is more to the point.
Is that what you want? Do you
think that we should as a
movement politely ignore
racism, or ignore class dif-
ferences within the feminist
community, or ignore the lack
of interest in the torture of
"mental patients" and other
prisoners? Women have been
brainwashed over the years
into believing many patriarch-
al lies, which give support
to systems that totally op-
press people. If the word
"feminist" means anything, it
means a woman who works to
develop women's power and

Breakthrough

honesty and responsibility.
What is there to celebrate at
a festival of women if the
women of color who have been
unfairly treated do not get
the opportunity to speak to
those who have gathered about
their experience? Women are in
prison for being poor, for
having dark skin. When women
as a movement really start to
confront and change these pat-
riarcal values and confront
white Amerikan privileges
ourselves, that's when I'll
really celebrate...

You see, I'll not forget
what it was like living
through twenty shock treat-
ments. I work at raising wo-
men's consciousness about
psychiatric torture, but I
wonder how long I'll need to
wait for women to stop be-
lieving mental health pro-
fessionals. They call our pain
and madness a sickness, and
poison us with drugs and
shock, and condition us all to
behave in their established
idea of what is normal and
stable and healthy. Mental
health professionals, who have
taught us to close our eyes
and adapt to our oppression...

In struggle,
Rose
