Eleven Black Women/Why Did They Die?

~Aegis

(This is from a pamphlet by the Com-
bahee River Collective, a Boston Black
Feminist Organization.)

Recently 11 young Black women have
been murdered in Roxbury, Dorchester,
the South End, and the Back Bay of
Boston. The entire Black community
continues to mourn their cruel and
brutal deaths. In the face of police
indifference and media lies and des-
pite our grief and anger, we have be-
gun to organize ourselves in order
to figure out ways to protect our-
selves and our sisters, and to make
the streets safe for women.

We are writing this because as
Black feminist activists we think it
is essential to understand the social
and political causes behind these
sisters’ deaths. We also want to share
information about safety measures ev-
ery woman can take.

In the Black community, the murders
have often been talked about as sole-
ly racial or racist crimes. It's true
that the police and media response
has been typically racist. It's true
that the victims were all Black and
that Black people have always been
targets of racist violence in this
society, but they were also all
women. Our sisters died because they
were women just as surely as they died
because they were Black. If the mur-
ders were only racial, young teen-age
boys and older Black men might also
have been the unfortunate victims.
They might now be petrified to walk
the streets as women have always
been.

When we look at the statistics and
hard facts about daily, socially ac-
ceptable violence against women, it's
clear it's no “bizarre series of co-
incidences" that eleven victims were
female. In the USA, 1 out of 3 women
will be raped in their lifetimes or

1/3 of all women in this country; at

least one woman is beaten by her boy-
friend or husband every 18 seconds;

1 out of every 4 women experiences
some form of sexual abuse before she
reaches the age of 18 (child molest-
ing, rape, incest) 75% of the time
by someone they know and 38% of the
time by a family member; 9 out of 10
women in a recent survey had received
unwanted sexual advances and haras-
sment at their jobs.

Another way to think about these
figures is that while you have been
reading this, a woman somewhere in
this city, in this state, in this
country has been beaten, raped, and
even murdered. Just to show how true
this statement is, when this pamph-
let was originally written at the be-
ginning of April, six Black women had
been murdered. One month later the
number is eleven.

These statistics apply to all wo-
men: Black, white, Latina, Asian,
Native American, old, young, rich,
poor, and in between. During this
time, a white woman was also murder-
ed and her body found in Dorchester.
We've got to understand that violence
against us as women cuts across all
racial, ethnic, and class lines. This
doesn't mean that violence against
Third World women does not have a
racial as well as sexual cause. Both
our race and sex lead to violence
against us.

One reason that attacks on women
are so widespread is that to keep
us down, to keep us oppressed we
have to be made afraid. Violence
makes us feel powerless and also like
we're second best.

The society also constantly encour-
ages the violence through the media:
movies, pornography, Playboy, Play-
ers, Hustler, JET, record covers,
advertisements, and disco songs ("Put
Love's Chains Back On Me"). Boys and
men get the message every day that
it's all right, even fun, to hurt wo-
men. What has happened in Boston's
Black community is a thread in the
fabric of violence against women.

Another idea that has been put out
in this crisis is that women should
stay in the house until the murder-
ers are found. In other words, Black
women should be under house arrest
(Remember that three of the eleven
women were found in their own apart-
ments.) If and when they catch the
murderers we still won't be safe to
leave our houses, because it has
never been safe to be a woman alone
in the street. Staying in the house
punishes the innocent and protects
the guilty. It also doesn't take in-
to account real life, that we must
go to work, get food, pick up the
kids at school, do the wash, run
errands, and visit friends. Women
should be able to walk outside when-
ever they please, with whoever they
please and for whatever reason.

WE WILL ONLY HAVE THIS RIGHT WHEN
WOMEN JOIN TOGETHER TO DEMAND OUR
RIGHTS AS HUMAN BEINGS TO BE FREE OF
PHYSICAL ABUSE, TO BE FREE OF FEAR.
The last idea we want to respond
to is that it’s men's job to protect
women. At first glance this may seem
to make sense, but look at the as-
sumptions behind it. Needing to be
protected assumes we are weak, help-
less, and dependent, that we are
victims who need men to protect us
from other men. As women in this soc-
iety, we are definitely at risk as
far as violence is concerned, but WE
HAVE TO LEARN TO PROTECT OURSELVES.
There are many ways to do this:
learning and following common sense
safety measures, learning self-def-
ense, setting up phone chains and
neighborhood safehouses, joining and
working in groups that are organiz-
ing against violence against women
are all ways to do this.

The idea of men protecting us
isn't very realistic because many
of us don't have a man to depend up-
on for this—young girls, teenagers,
single women, separated and divorced
women, lesbians, widowed women, and
elderly women. And even if we do
have a man, he cannot be our shadow
24 hours a day.

What men can do to “protect” us
is to check out the ways in which
they put down and intimidate women
in the streets or at home, to stop
being verbally and physically abus-
ive to us, and to tell men they know
who mistreat women to stop it and
stop it quick. Men who are committed
to stopping violence against women
should start seriously discussing
this issue with other men and org-
anizing in supportive ways.

We decided to write this because
of our outrage at what has happened
to 11 Black women and to thousands and
thousands of women whose names we don't
even know. As Black women who are
feminists, we are struggling against
all racist, sexist, heterosexist,
and class oppression. We know that
we have no hopes of ending this par-
ticular crisis and violence against
women in our community until we
identify all its causes, including
sexual oppression.

Self-Protection

- Do not accept rides from strangers.

- Do not get into unlicensed cab
services or cabs with 2 people in
the driver's seat.

Lock your car doors at all times,
make sure all windows are locked.

Lock your house door at all times,
make sure all windows are locked.

Vary your route to and from home.
Stay on well-lighted main streets.
Avoid side streets and alleys.

Travel in pairs or groups.

Learn some simple self-defense like
how to get out of a hold or how to
use available objects as weapons:
comb, keys, hair brush, lighted
cigarette, edge of books, whistles,
salt, red/black pepper.

Wear shoes and clothes you can
easily run in.

Always have your keys ready in your
hand as you enter your house.

Let someone know where you are at
all times and your planned route.
Phone ahead to your destination.

Get to know your neighbors on your
street. Keep an eye out for each
other. Make an effort.

If you hear someone in distress,
don't ignore it. If you can't safe-
ly investigate, call 911.

If you feel like you are being fol-
lowed...check first—change direc-
tions, then react... Stay calm,
change your pace, cross the street,
walk next to the curb or in the middle of
traffic...DO NOT GO HOME, the at-
tacker will follow...run to the
nearest lighted place.

Yell FIRE if someone is attacking
you; people are more likely to
come to your aid than if you yell
"Help".

Encourage your friends to take
these precautions.
