Newspapers

BIG MAMA RAG
1724 Gaylord, Denver
322-2010, 320-5972

Big Mama has been published in
Denver for five years, and is distrib-
uted nationally and locally.

BMR covers local, regional and
national news, features on health, work
and culture, analysis of feminist
issues, and interviews of interest to
women struggling to change our society.

We are committed to contributing to
the development of a radical feminist
analysis, and we gear our paper to
women who have already developed some
level of feminist consciousness.

By "radical" we mean that we are
committed to the complete eradication
of the present social system, and the
institution of another which will
speak to the needs of all people and
which will not benefit any person or
class of people at the expense of any
other person or class of people.

We are a collective of five who
share all power and responsibility
involved in putting out the paper.

All of us are white women and lesbians.
However, we encourage any woman who
shares our political perspective to
work with us either on a collective
or task force level.

As part of our commitment to ac-
countability within the feminist
community, we hold somewhat irregular
community meetings. The next one is
scheduled for Monday, Sept. 12 at
7 pm at Woman to Woman Feminist Center,
2023 E. Colfax.
