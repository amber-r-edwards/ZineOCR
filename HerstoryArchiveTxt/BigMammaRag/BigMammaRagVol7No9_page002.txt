Rape Victims Subjected to Polygraph Tests

by her rapist for $60,000 in damages
on grounds of "malicious prosecution."
The original rape trial, held in

1976, was dismissed midway at the re-

Kathy Riley.

Women across the country--most re-
cently in Sweetwater County, Wyoming--
are fighting the power of police and
prosecutors to give lie tests to rape

victims before prosecuting their rapists.
Like many male-controlled "services"

to women, the use of the polygraph on
rape victims is defended by those who
use them as in our own interest.

But women active in anti-rape strug-

gles have seen it for what it is:
another way of protecting men's repu-
tations at the expense of women who
have been sexually assaulted.

As a recent article in Aegis: Maga-
zine on Ending Violence Against Women
explained it: "Seldom do other charges
require such rigorous screening of
complainants; and there are no other
crimes where the truthfulness of the
victims, as a group, is automatically
suspect."

In August, women from the Sweetwater

County Task Force on Sexual Assault
approached the American Civil Liberties
Union about a possible lawsuit to end
the use of lie tests on rape victims.

A suit is still a strong possibil-
ity, but right now the task force is
talking with the county prosecutor in
hopes of getting the practice changed
out of court.

Recent newspaper stories about
Sweetwater County noted that in half
(seven out of 14) of the rape charges
filed there this year, victims were
asked to take polygraph tests before
the charges were filed. At least
three of those cases were dismissed
because the victims did not show up
for the tests.

Sweetwater County Attorney Jere
Ryckman defended the use of the poly-
graph as a means to "strengthen the
case" against a rapist; that while
test results are inadmissible in
court, they can be used to pressure
a rapist into pleading guilty.

"In certain cases there is very
little other evidence, and it's simply
the word of one person against the
word of another. Once in a while, we
feel a victim is not telling the
truth," Ryckman told reporters.

In Colorado Springs, El Paso
County attorney Ron Rowan also de-
fended the use of lie tests there
as a means of “sparing” a woman a
court appearance. But he also told
the press that an "alarming" 25 to
50 percent of the rape reports made
by women in El Paso County are false,
based on the number of women who
flunk the test and other evidence.

Rowan did not question the effects
of the test on women, as feminists
would question them: that here at
last, men have found statistics to
back up what they've always wanted
to believe: that women like rape,
want rape and encourage rape.

But women are fighting back. A
class action suit, filed by the
Women's Justice Center in Detroit,
is pending in Michigan. It's on be-
half of three victims who were denied
warrants against their rapists be-
cause they "failed" lie tests.

In Portland, Oregon, women have
formed a support committee for Lori
K. Johnson, who is now being sued

quest of the prosecution--possibly
because of lie test results from
Johnson and the rapist.

(Johnson's support committee, which
has become the Oregon Coalition for
Change of Rape Laws, Tri-Met County
--or CORL-- can be reached at P.O.
Box 22525, Milwaukie, OR 97222).

In Yakima County, Washington,
Rape Relief Coordinator Cheryl Ficek,
along with a neighboring county
prosecutor, is challenging the
high lie test failure rate there
(60%). Already authorities have
filed charges against a woman for
giving false information to a po-
liceman on the basis of her poly-
graph results.

Ficek says that rape victims are
doubly traumatized when they learn
they've failed the test: “Most women
just crawl home after flunking,
they're so humiliated.“

Unquestioned by those in power is
the accuracy of the polygraph test;
the influence of the examiner; the
effect on a woman's decision to
report; the effect on a victim, who--
like all of us in this society--
has been conditioned to believe
that she is somehow at fault for
what happened to her.

"Every victim goes through this
kind of (guilt) process," said
Barbara Hodges, assistant director
of the Sweetwater County Task Force
on Sexual Assault. "It's almost as
if society set women up to be the
loser."

Another issue around the poly-
graph is its disproportionate use
compared to other kinds of crimes.
Police and prosecutors argue that
rape is more likely to come down to
the victim's word against that of
the rapist.

Steve Pevar, a lawyer with the
regional ACLU office in Denver,
said that discriminatory rationale
will be challenged if the Sweetwater
case goes to court.

"Most crimes are my word against
yours. You have one person saying
so-and-so did something. But even
if they (lie tests) were used equal-
ly in all other crimes, we're saying
they shouldn't be used in rape cases
anyway.

“Law enforcement officers have
the obligation to use techniques
which will encourage people to re-
port rape."

Pevar said that polygraphs have
not only been shown to discourage
rape reports, but are part of the
"age-old bias that women encourage
rape."

He also questioned the accuracy
of the lie test--particularly when
the examiner isn't trained.

For example, he said, if a woman
is asked ‘Did you do anything to
encourage this?’ a woman may have
difficulty interpreting this. What
is meant by the question--getting
into the car in the first place?

Given the guilt most of us have
to deal with and get rid of after
a rape, 69 percent flunk rates--
like that in Washington State are
not surprising.

Media publicity over the use of
lie tests have effectively stopped
them in some places. Although
prosecutors will have the power to
resume them--until a legal precedent
is set.

In Sweetwater County, Hodges said
that lie tests really haven't been

Battered Woman
Given Probation

Peggy Jean Robinson, a 30-year-old
Aurora woman, beaten black and blue
by her husband before she killed him
with an automatic pistol last Novem-
ber, was sentenced in Littleton Dis-
trict Court to five years probation
and was ordered to do 300 hours of
volunteer work for the state.

Judge Robert F. Kelley told Ms.
Robinson, a union truck driver, that
he based his decision on the opinions
of Lenore Walker, a leading specialist
on battered women.

In a letter to the court, Walker
told Kelley that Robinson should not
be held accountable for her actions
because she was suffering from what
is known as "the battered woman syn-
drome."

In that state, attorneys said, the
victim finds herself under such deep
psychological stress from abuse that
she will seek a permanent resolution
to the situation. They said she may

used there since May, when the
task force first complained to the
Wyoming attorney general. (That
office did nothing, however).
Nevertheless, Hodges said that the
task force will insist on a written
policy from the county prosecutor.
In Detroit, police stopped using
polygraph tests in rape cases after
the department was named in the
Women's Justice Center suit. As a
result, the police were dropped from
the suit, but are required to no-
tify complaining parties 90 days
in advance if they ever plan to re-
sume the practice. The prosecutor
there has also effectively stopped
using them, but retains the power
to do so.

Nine
Girls Molested

A former employee of Gemini House,
a Jefferson County home for runaway
and neglected youths was charged with
sexually molesting nine girls that
lived there.

Nick Lucero, 33, of 3485 Sheridan
Blvd., Wheat Ridge, was accused of
sexually assaulting girls ranging in
age from 12 to 17 who lived at Gemini
House. Gemini House is used by the
Jefferson County Department of Social
Services to counsel and house troubled
children and teenagers.

Lucero was employed at the facility
from mid-June to early August and
reportedly molested the girls while
working as a night supervisor there.

Lucero was fired and the police con-
tacted on August 2nd after a 15-year-
old girl reported to a counselor that
Lucero had molested her.

Susan MacQuiddy, current director
of Gemini House, said that several
new screening procedures for employee
applicants have been started as a
result of the incidents.

Local Feminists Confront Misogynist

Recently some Denver feminists
were advised of a plot of Jay C. Tay-
lor's to brutalize his wife. His ads
appeared in the Rocky Mountain Ouster,
a paper available in the Denver area
in liquor stores. His intention was
to get primarily lesbians, but would
consider men or couples, to a party
where he would drug his wife, subject
her to brutality while introducing
her to S/M, and allowing the lesbians
to show her off as their slave.

The wife was out of town and femin-
ists contacted her and told her of
the plan and she did not return to
Denver as she had planned. However,
Taylor flew out to where she was and
did, in fact, humiliate her in a pub-
lic place.

Taylor was interviewed under false
pretenses and the information for
a leaflet as well as a drawing of
Taylor were obtained. About 200

Denver Women’s Health Clinic Seminars

In conjunction with the Denver Free
University, the Denver Women's Health
Care Clinic will conduct a series of
Monday night seminars beginning Oct.
15th on Common Health Concerns of
Women throughout the Life Cycle.
Topics will include: Female Infections
and How to Live With Them, Birth Con-
trol Concerns, The Menstrual Cycle,
Women's Sports and Exercise, Skin
Thinking, To Mother or Not to Moth-
er, Women and Cancer, Heart Disease --
#1 Killer of Women, and Menopause
Myths and Realities.

Ongoing week night groups include
Natural Birth Control, Health Care
Consumerism, Mothers are People Too,
Nutrition and Meditation and Relaxa-
tion. Weekend seminars will include
Self Help, Stress Management, Female
Sexuality and Identifying Health Risk
Factors.

Women may attend one, all, or a com-
bination of sessions, which will be
listed in the Denver Free University
Fall Catalogue.

The Denver Women's Health Care
Clinic opened this spring, offering
health care by women for women of all

ages.

“We are interested in women knowing
about themselves and playing a part
in keeping healthy. We are interest-
ed in health, as opposed to illness,
and in alternative ways to take care
of oneself," stressed Alison Strunk,
clinic nurse.

Patients are encouraged to keep
personal body inventories of health
states in order to understand what's
usual or unusual for them. Patients
must sign health charts after exami-
ners explain them, indicating that
they understand what's in their
health record.

The clinic wants to reach out to
groups of women who normally do not
get good health care, such as teen-
agers, middle-aged and older women.

Patients may be accompanied by a
person of their choice during exams
and mothers will be provided with
childcare during visits.

The clinic is a non-profit corpor-
ation funded through private grants
and through fees rather than govern-
ment funding. Fees are reasonable
and on a sliding scale for women who
cannot pay them. The clinic's goal
is to be self-supporting and to pay
all volunteers.

Complete physical exams, gyneco-
logical services including pregnancy
diagnosis and contraception, abor-
tions, pre- and post-natal care, and
group and individual counseling are
offered.

Clinic hours are Monday 5:30 -
9:30 pm, Tuesday 1:30 - 9:30 pm,
Thursday and Friday 1:30 - 5:30 pm.
An abortion clinic is held two
Thursday evenings each month.

The clinic's 24-hour answering
service is 320-1020.

Leaflets with a drawing of Taylor
and a description of what he had done
were distributed in his apartment com-

plex and harassing calls were made to
him.

Women Organize

A group of four Boulder women are
organizing around the ideas for action
set forth by WAVAW (Women Against
Violence Against Women). At present
they are developing strategies for
public education and action, as well
as “teaching ourselves to be articul-
ate, and strong. We fight against
woman-hating, the violence upon which
our society is built.”
