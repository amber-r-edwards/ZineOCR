4th Denver International Film Festival:

The fourth Denver International Film Festival, set for May 1 - Cleo From 5 to 7

through May 14, 
or with women as the focus: 
Rag with notes on each of 

is offering 23 films either directed by women. 
The festival has provided Big Mama 
these films, which we are highlighting 

with the title of the film, the country in which it was 
made, a brief description, and the date and place of showing.

Women at BMR have seen only one of the films, 
The Life and Times of Rosie 
also received feminist praise; what we know about 
the films comes from the press releases. Many sound like an 

opportunity not to be missed. The films will be shown at the 

Ogden (935 E. Colfax), 
the Denver Center Cinema 
(1028 S. Gaylord), 
the Guild (1028 S. Gaylord), 
Pearl), 

and in Boulder at the Regency (1109 Walnut).

The Ballad of Orin 
Japan

Ballad of Orin, set in 1918, 
concerns the fate of a young 
woman, pledged since the age 
of four to the goze (a traveling band of singers), who 
is banished from the group 
and forced to travel alone 
after being raped. Orin faces 
a destiny common to women that 
is rooted in Japan's feudal 
past. (7:00, Sun, May 10, 
Ogden).

Lena Rais 
West Germany

A middle-aged Lena Rais 
attempts to leave her violent 
husband before it's too late. 
The more Lena rebels, the 
more violent her husband be- 
comes. The despair in Lena's 
attempts to find help and un- 
derstanding shows society's 
denial of the seriousness of 
wife abuse. (7:00, Wed, May 6, 
Ogden and 9:30, Wed, May 13, 
Vogue).

Anastasia Passed By 
Rumania

Anastasia Passed By is set 

in 1944 in a border town on 

the Danube where the German 
Wehrmacht troops come to 
town to press young men into 
service. Many escape, joining 
the partisans, but one is 
killed and dragged through 
the village to serve as a 
warning to the townspeople.

To bury the body is punish- 
able by execution. None dare 
but young school teacher An- 
astasia. (9:30, Wed, May 13, 
Ogden and 9:30, Thur, May 14, 
DCC).

Maybe This Time 
Australia

Maybe This Time is the story 
of Fran, who at the crucial 
"turning 30" stage, leaves 
her job as a teacher in a 
small country town for a job 
in the city and new involve- 
ments. It focuses on Fran's 
affairs with three distinctly 
different men, and how she 
decides to move on - leaving 
established but unfulfilling 
loves, as well as her country, 
behind her - in a new quest 
for discoveries. (7:00, Wed, 
May 13, Vogue and 9:30, Thur, 
May 14, Ogden).

France

Agnes Varda will appear in 
person for the showing of 
probably her best-known film, 
Cleo From 5 To 7. Unique in 
that the movie time is real 
time (there are no cuts), 

Cleo follows the odyssey of 

a young singer who is sudden- 
ly faced with the possibility 
of death. The film follows 
her for two hours, from her 
visit to a fortune teller to 
the hospital where she is to 
learn the results of medical 
tests. Cleo is recognized 

as not only a daring tech- 
nical feat, but as an extra- 
ordinarily beautiful film. 
Uncle Yanko, a short subject 
of Varda's, will also be shown 

at this tribute. (7:00, Fri, 
May 1, Ogden).

Agnes Varda will also be 
at the Ogden, 10:00 am, Sat, 

May 2 for a seminar on the ev- 
olution of French cinema, as 
well as appearing later that 
day at the Ogden for showings 
of two of her other films: 
Daguerrotypes at noon, and 
Lion's Love at 9:30.

Divine Ema 
Czechoslovakia

Divine Ema is a famous bo- 
hemian opera singer accused 
of espionage upon her return 
from a triumphant tour of the 
United States. Ema becomes a 
victim of wartime judgment, 
yet maintains her integrity, 
though it jeopardizes her 
future return to opera. (4:30, 
Sat, May 9, DCC).

The Thin Line 
Israel

Michal Bat-Adam, writer- 
director of Each Other and 
scriptwriter of Madame Rosa, 
offers another fascinating 
movie with The Thin Line. It 
is a finely etched portrait 
of a woman who tries to re- 
main in touch with her family 
as she struggles against de- 
pression. Pola, married and 
the mother of two daughters, 
finds herself slipping into 
the grip of a severe depres- 
sion her husband finds hard 
to comprehend. Much of the 
film is seen through the eyes 
of Pola's 10-year-old daughter 
who alone has insight into her 
mother's illness. (7:00, Thur, 
May 7, Ogden).

The Fiancee 
East Germany

The Fiancee is based on the 
true story The House With The 
Heavy Doors, by Eva Lippold, 
about the determination and 
loneliness of a woman imprison- 
ed in West Germany for 10 
years. The woman, played mov- 
ingly by Jutta Wachowiak, is 
a young, dedicated worker in 
the underground Communist 
movement in Germany. Although 
titled as a love story, The 
Fiancee is more about people 
who maintain their hope and 
humanity when all else is 
crumbling. (7:00, Sat, May 2, 
DCC and 9:30, Wed, May 6, 
Vogue).

Possum Living 
USA

The Willmar 8 
USA

Nancy Schreiber will be on 
hand to discuss her new film 
Possum Living. It tells the 
story of Dolly Freed and her 
father who live in a Phila- 
delphia suburb, and how they 
manage to live contentedly on 
less than $2000 a year. On 
the same bill is the new doc- 
umentary, The Willmar 8. It 
is a moving account of eight 
women who, previously "apol- 
itical," organize a union and 
wage the first bank strike in 
Minnesota history. The strike 
lasts 18 months, through two 
brutal winters, and the film 
documents the personal and 
group struggles of the women. 
Though the strike is lost, 
the women win a sense of self 
and purpose they never had 
before. (7:00, Fri, May 8, 
DCC and 9:30, Sun, May 10, 
Guild).

Aziza 
Tunisia/Algeria

Aziza is the story of a 
young woman who breaks with 
traditional expectations for 
Arab women. Set in contempor- 
ary Tunisia, Aziza loses her 
family in the revolution, and 
falls under the thumb of her 
uncle. Aziza decides to go to 
work in a textile factory, 
where she awakens to the ne- 
cessity of determining her 
own life as a working-class 
woman in a developing country. 
(2:00, Sun, May 7, DCC and 
9:30, Thur, May 14, Vogue).

A Look At Women In The Reel World

Simone Barbes, Or Virtue 
France

Simone-Barbes, a wry and 
compassionate, midnight-to- 
dawn tour through the Paris 
"underworld," represents 
author Marie-Claude Treilhou's 
directorial debut. The film 
unfolds in three distinct 
acts: on the job in a porno 
complex with a sister-usher, 
after work at the lesbian 
nightclub where her girlfriend 
works, and with a depressed 
middle-aged man who picks her 
up but makes no sexual advanc- 
es. The story and funny-sad 
mood of the film comes from 
Treilhou's own experiences as 
an usher in a porno film 
house. Ingrid Bourgoin, also 
a porn-house usher in real 
life, plays Simone. (7:00, 
Tues, May 5, Ogden and 9:30, 
Thur, May 7, DCC).

The Left-Handed Woman 
Germany

For no apparent reason a 
woman leaves her husband. For 
the next three months she 
withdraws into silence, roams 
the outskirts of Paris, con- 
fronting the objects of her 
world. For those who found an 
Unmarried Woman cute and fa- 
cile, The Left-Handed Woman 
offers an uncompromising and 
penetrating exploration of a 
woman's selfhood with no easy 
solutions. (9:30, Wed, May 6, 
Ogden).

Immacolata and Concetta 
Italy

Immacolata and Concetta: 
The Other Jealousy is set in 
a small southern Italian town. 
Immacolata, a butcher, and 
Concetta, a laborer, meet in 
jail where they are both doing 
time, one for leading a girl 
into prostitution, the other 
for shooting at her lover's 
angry husband. The women be- 
come involved with passion, 
jealousy and murder. The 
frankness of the lovemaking 
scenes between the two women 
has an honest eroticism; un- 
derplayed, excellent perform- 
ances that do not sentimental- 
ize the characters they play. 
(7:00, Mon, May 11, Vogue and 
9:30, Wed, May 13, Regency).

Tell Me A Riddle 
USA

A powerful film, Tell Me A 
Riddle marks the directorial 
debut of a feature-length 
film for Lee Grant. Staying 
true to, and illuminating 
the novella by Tillie Olsen, 
the film pulls us through 
marriage, aging and death via 
the experience of an immigrant 
couple, focusing on the dying 
Eva who revitalizes her once 
spirited hope and faith out 
of love for her modern, inde- 
pendent granddaughter. (7:00, 
Sun, May 3, DCC).

Model 
USA

The high-gloss allure of a 
New York model agency, its 
intricate workings, and the 
way in which sexual beauty is 
packaged by the media to sell 
products are all explored in 
this documentary by Frederick 
Wiseman. By the end of Model, 
the agency comes to represent 
the intersection of business 
and fantasy in a capitalist 
world. (7:00, Wed, May 6, DCC 
and 9:30, Sat, May 9, Guild).

The Life and Times 
of Rosie The Riveter 
USA

The Life And Times Of Rosie 
The Riveter is a documentary 
that mixes old newsreels and 
contemporary interviews. It 
focuses on four women who 
worked "non-traditional" jobs 
in World War II factories 
and then were forced out of 
work upon the return of Am- 
erican GIs. (9:30, Fri, May 
1, Vogue and 7:00, Sat, May 
2, Guild).

An Italian Woman 
Italy

An Italian Woman is about 
a woman in flight from her 
husband, lover and family. 
Marta spends a day in the 
Milan railway station, a met- 
ropolitan microcosm of all 
that she has been protected 
from. As Marta achieves a 
greater understanding of the 
society in which she lives, 
she also begins to gain a 
degree of painful self-know- 
ledge. (2:00, Thur, May 7, 
DCC and 7:00, Fri, May 8, 
Regency).

Hazal 

Turkey

Hazal is a young woman who 
is married off to a man who 
dies in the army. By custom, 
and under the rule of the 
feudal lord, Hazal, as prop- 
erty, is forced to then marry 
her 11-year-old brother-in- 
law. Hazal finds this marri- 
age intolerable and leaves 

it for a man of her own choos- 
ing. The film sets this story 
against another one of tech- 
nological progress involving 
the building of a road through 
feudal territory and captures 
the contrasts of a rigid vil- 
lage faced with the "modern" 
world. (9:30, Mon, May 4, 
Vogue).

The Singer and the Dancer 
Australia

The Singer And The Dancer, 
by Gillian Armstrong, direc- 
tor of My Brilliant Career, 
explores the relationship 
between two women from dif- 
ferent generations. Mrs. Bil- 
son is an old, eccentric 
woman who once a week escapes 
to the solitude of a secluded 
river bank. There she meets 
Charlie, a young woman from 
the city escaping urban so- 
ciety. A close relationship 
develops as they come to un- 
derstand each other and find 
a bond in their common ex- 
periences and problems. (7:00, 
Sun, May 3, Vogue and 9:30, 
Fri, May 8, Guild).

Close to 200 films will be shown in this year's festival. (A 
complete program is available in the most recent issue of
