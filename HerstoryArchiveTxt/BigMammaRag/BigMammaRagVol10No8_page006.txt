Feminist Programs Under Attack--"Too Political’

Karen Brodine

At the National Women's
Studies Association Confer-
ence at Humboldt State, CA,
June 16-20, the fact that
Women's Studies is under at-
tack nationwide became very
apparent. In reports from all

women’s studies

over the country, case after

case of women fired, of fem-
inist content eradicated, of
right wing attacks on femin-
ist programs, turned up.

Over 50 women attended a
meeting to discuss the fir-
ings. Merle Woo, lecturer in
Asian American/Ethnic Studies
at the University of Californ-
ia Berkeley, and keynote
speaker at UCB's Women's Stud-
ies graduation, described the

attacks on feminist programs and the impact on teaching people.

Big cat beneficiaries of Ray-Gun's supply-side strat-
egies stand to gain larger profits from arms sales to
Israel, propaganda commercials on PBS, racist Supreme
Court rulings & ever-increasing unemployment among work-

Ray-Gun met with his Israeli
counterpart, Menachem Begin,
to plan more killings in Leb-
anon. Money cut from school
& hospital budgets in this
country will now go to
Israel to bomb schools &

hospitals in Lebanon.
Ray-Gun's $400 million
increase in US aid to

Israel (which has already
gotten 1/3 of all US aid
during the last 10 years) was funded by Ray-Gun's $400
million cut in the food stamp budget. Israel, in turn
funnels these dollars back into the fat cats' pockets through
massive military machinery purchases.

Ray-Gun's plan to let big business fund the arts has
taken hold at PBS—our supposedly commercial-free, un-
biased television network is fast becoming the adminis-
tration's propaganda network.
Corp. will begin airing 30-second "commercials" on PBS
which explain high gasoline prices, pollution, why Ray-
Gunomics are good for you, etc.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has ruled that employ-
ees must prove that racial discrimination was "intent-
ional" to bring suit against employers. This is no
real surprise as big-time racist employers have been
welcomed into Ray-Gun's ring of cabinet advisors.
George Schultz, Haig's replacement as secretary of
state, was president of Bechtel Corp & remains on the
board. Both Bechtel & Sears have
been found guilty of discrimination against Black,
Latin & women employees. Pentagon boss Caspar Weinber-
ger was Schultz's main legal beagle in the government
suit against Bechtel Corp. Both men have impeccable

Meanwhile, unemployment rises, unions are threaten-
ed, & more & more stand in line at job sites, unemploy-

overall attacks on feminism
and free speech. "Women and
people of color, lesbians and
gays, unionists and radicals:
all those critical of the Ad-
ministration are the first to
go." Woo, a lesbian and a mem-
ber of Radical Women, believes
she was fired from Asian Amer-
ican Studies because of her
socialist feminist politics
and criticism of the depart-
ment.

Nancy Shaw, recently denied
tenure at UC Santa Cruz, was
told she was ‘unscholarly',
‘intellectually unqualified'
and 'too concerned with social
change’. Shaw has done exten-
sive research on women's
health care and is a community
activist. Her tenure was den-
ied by the Chancellor, going
against unanimous recommenda-
tions from students, community

hospitals in Lebanon.

and faculty.

Diane Kern, assistant prof-
essor at Cal State Hayward,
was told that her research in-
to prostitution isn't relevant
to course material for the
Criminal Justice Program. Af-
ter 3 years on tenure track,
Kern's program head fired her.
"He thought I would be sweet
and quiet when I was hired,
but I was critical of depart-
ment policy," she said.

Merline Williams, a lectur-
er at UC Davis, who teaches
feminist courses in American
Studies, is in danger of being
terminated. Students, commun-
ity and faculty supporters
are organizing to retain her
job. Her students performed a
play at the meeting, which
dramatized the issues of her
case.

Many of the attacks are
coming not simply out of a
conservative trend within the
university or cutbacks in edu-
cation overall, but from out-
side, organized right wing
pressure. Betty Brooks, at
Long Beach State, teaching
the class "Women and Their
Bodies", was told her class
would be reviewed. Right wing
fundamentalists had been spy-
ing on her class and put
pressure on the legislature
to investigate the Women's
Studies Program. When 58 wom-
en showed up to enroll in
Brooks's summer course, they
were told by the Administra-
tion that the class was can-
celled due to ‘lack of enroll-
ment’. The Administration has
now suspended the Women's
Studies Program, fired its
director, and assigned Brooks
to desk duties ‘pending the
outcome of an investigation'.
Brooks was accused by the
right wingers of teaching
‘pro-lesbian and immoral’ ma-
terial.

One woman told of 2 deans
fired at the University of
Arkansas in the last year for
supporting lesbian issues.

The attack was organized by
FLAG (Family Life and God).
Last year's National Wom-
en's Studies Association con-
ference included a Fired Les-
bians Caucus. Of the 10 or 12

women in that group, only 2

returned this year. One wom-
an, who had worked for 11
years as a part-time 'tempor-
ary' lecturer, discussed the
particular exploitation of
part-time workers—who are
mostly women and people of
color, who teach the most

and are the lowest paid,
with no benefits, and no
right to due process. Admin-
istrations, cutting back
their budgets, are trying to
insure that these low-paid
marginal workers are not al-
lowed to unionize.

The meeting participants
discussed strategies for
fighting back. People agreed
that public pressure, as

well as union grievance and

legal procedures, is cru-
cial. Woo stressed the im-
portance of building a multi-
issue defense, gathering
support of students, women,
people of color, lesbian and
gay, union and radical
groups. Shaw has organized a
joint university-community
group to develop publicity,
fund-raising and direct ac-
tion. The ACLU is consider-
ing taking on the Long

Beach Women's Studies case
as a landmark free speech
fight.

Women pointed out that
feminism is the cutting
edge these days, and women,
and particularly lesbians
and women of color, are
being scapegoated as a way
of getting at all of femin-
ist and ethnic studies. A
student said she is fighting
not only because feminism
is integral to her education,
but because she wants to be
a teacher in the future,
and that students must be
recognized as a militant
and integral part of the
struggle. Nellie Wong de-
scribed the Clara Fraser
Free Speech Case, as an ex-
ample of the way to organ-
ize against these attacks.
Fraser, fired as director
of Affirmative Action at
Seattle City Light, has
waged a militant, multi-
issue battle for 7 years,
charging sex and political
discrimination and gathering
nationwide support. Gloria
Desoule, who wrote "Rocking
the Boat: Academic Women
and the Academic Process,"
pointed out the importance
of fighting back. She said
her successful struggle 8
years ago to retain her job
at Skidmore has made a
real difference for other
women faculty there.

$450 was collected at
the meeting for the Fund
to Defend Fired Teachers.
