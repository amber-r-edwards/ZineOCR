Madison Women Win  

Sexist Judge Recalled  

Deb Taylor  

In September, feminists in Madison  
Wisconsin organized a recall election  
against sexist Judge Archie Simonson  
and won:  

Simonson had become infamous in  
Madison this summer because he pardoned  
the actions of high school boys who  
gang raped a 16-year-old girl in a  
high school stairwell. He said in the  
courtroom, "Whether we like it or not,  
women are sex objects...This community  
is well known to be sexually permissive...  
Are we supposed to punish an  
impressionable person 15 or 16 years  
of age because they react to it normally?"  

Feminists and Madison voters responded  
with mass outrage and demanded a  
retraction from the Judge. He refused  
and so 36,000 voters signed petitions  
for a recall election. In the election,  
Moria Krueger, a woman specialist  
in family and juvenile law and the  
only woman in a field of six candidates,  
was supported by feminists and  
liberals.  

Moria is a liberal feminist, supportive  
of gay rights and willing to put  
in extra hours to hold weekend and  
evening court so that people won't  
have to sit in jail from Friday night  
until Monday morning. She received  
35% of the votes cast and won the  
election.  

This election focused a lot of attention  
on how our legal system treats  
rapists and was an important educational  
tool. It brought people a more  
humane judge in one city and symbolized  
what people might do to improve  
their legal system when it is obviously  
barbaric.  

Gives People Peanuts  

What gratifying condescension was shown by  
Judge Thesiger for a man aged 68 who  
pleaded guilty to rape at Leeds Crown  
Court in England on March 23, 1977.  
"With your state of health, high blood  
pressure, you ought not to indulge in  
conduct of this kind, because you  
might overtax your own power and die  
in very unfortunate circumstances."  
London Times, 3/29/77  

Women's Report  

Although some judges may be elected,  
laws may change and the police may  
even establish special rape squads,  
reforms alone will not prevent rape  
whilst women still accept the special  
burden of caution to avoid being  
raped.  

We must not depend on men to protect  
us from other men. We can use our own  
strengths and resources. Women have  
taken such action as: compiling lists  
of known rapists and publishing them  
in newspapers and leaflets; organizing  
pickets outside courts and police stations  
where women have not been treated  
with respect; painting slogans on

Iran has been in the news recently  
as being one of the most repressive  

political prisoners has become famous  
as the Shah has attempted to increase  
government control and stamp out any  
opposition. Of course he was put on  
the throne by the CIA.

jails.  

Vida Hadjebi Tabrizi is a former  
sociologist and researcher at the  
University of Tehran. 42 years old,

as she was driving home. The  
actual charges against her have never  
been made public.  

According to Dagen Nyheter, a prestigious  
Stockholm daily, Ms. Tabrizi  
was investigating the “living conditions  
of Iran's peasant population"  
before her arrest. She was then  
imprisoned in the notorious Evin prison  
and was subjected to such harsh  
torture that she "lost any sense of  
feeling in her hands and feet, has  
developed a bad heart, bad blood circulation,  
meningitis, and no longer  
menstruates at all." (Dagen Nyheter,  
8/31/73).  

In Iran, 80% of all women are illiterate.  
Most women live in rural areas,  
behind thick veils, with no culture,  
education or medical aid. Only 4% of  
all women work.  

As women have become more involved  
in social life, they have been imprisoned  
because of their political views.  

Carter Hurts Poor People  

SIRE,  

Welfare  

LNS  

The long-heralded welfare reform  
program unveiled by Carter in early  
August will actually reduce aid for  
vast numbers of welfare recipients.  

As reported in the Wall Street  
Journal, "Administration officials  
aren't eager to disclose that their proposal  
decreases benefits for substantial  
numbers of current welfare recipients,  
affecting about 3 million people  
or 10%. Most of these are on the Aid  
to Families with Dependent Children  
(AFDC) and food stamp programs."  

Both AFDC and the food stamp program  
would be scrapped under Carter's plan  
and replaced by a combined agreement of  
cash assistance and jobs, with a  
strict work requirement for all "able-bodied"  
recipients. Since proposed  
benefits would actually be lower than  
those currently offered in 39 states,  
it is expected that many states will  
decide to supplement the benefits to  
bring them up to the current levels.  

Under the Administration plan, all  
recipients who are not aged, blind or  
disabled and who are not single parents  
of children younger than 7 are  
classified as "expected to work", and  
are required to undergo an intensive  
job search during which time they  
receive a lower level of benefits.  

A single parent with a child between  
the ages of 6-14 will be expected to  
work part-time if child-care is not  
available, and full-time if it is.  
Single parents with children 14 and  
over will be expected to work regardless  
of whether after-school care is  
available.  

PROMISES YOU MADE  

If the “employable person" cannot  
find a job after a five-week job  
search and then a three-week search  
by government agencies, s/he will then  
be eligible for one of the 1.4 million  
public service job slots the government  
says it will create. These jobs  

would pay the minimum wage of $2.30  
an hour- 40% less than the present  
average wage for federally-created  
public service jobs. However, there is  
already considerable doubt that the  
government will be able to create  
these jobs.  

If placement in one of these temporary  
job slots is not possible, the  
recipient is automatically placed in  

a higher benefit level, where, for  
example, a family of four would receive  
$4,200 a year- 66% of the  
1976 poverty level. If for any  
reason someone refuses a job placement,  
she or he would remain at the  
lower benefit level, ($2,300 for a  
family of four a year! Only 36% of  
the poverty level.)  

Theresa Fumicella of the Welfare  
Advocacy Center in New York City  
says, "My feeling is it's an attempt  
to establish an entire subculture of  
people who will be a cheap source of  
labor and who will have no union  
rights. It leaves people with no  
choice of what job to take or where  
to put your child in day-care. You  
take the job that's given you, or  
else you survive at the lower level.  
The minute you quit-- no matter what  
the condition-- you'd immediately go  
down to the lower level.  

“our experience is that the over-

Adoption  

LNS  

The meaning of Jimmy Carter's pro-family  
campaign rhetoric has finally  
become clear. The Carter Administration  
is supporting pro-childbirth  
legislation proposing federal adoption  
subsidies that would pay adoptive  
families four times the amount paid  
to a natural mother on welfare to  
care for a minority, ethnic or otherwise  
“hard-to-place" child.  

And, some sources say that the  
Administration will complete the package  
in the near future by sponsoring  
legislation to pay maternity costs  
for poor women who agree to put their  
babies up for adoption.  

This government Administration support  
of adoption subsidies comes hard on  
the heels of recent Supreme Court  
rulings against funding abortions.  
Frederick S. Jaffe, president of the  
Alan Guttmacher Institute of Planned  
Parenthood calls the adoption subsidy  
plan a way of "bribing an unfortunate  
class of women to be breeders for the  
more fortunate".  

Already states give more money to  
almost anyone- to foster parents,  
orphanages, children's homes, jails-  
than they are willing to give for  
AFDC. For example, current support  
payments for a child in foster care in  
New York State are $7,164 a year;  
while the welfare grant in New York  
for both mother and child is only  
$3,516. Miller says that H.R. 7200 is  
a “cruel and bizarre bill to salve the  
conscience of a society that would  
force poor women to breed children  
they cannot afford".

4000 Women In The Shah's Jails  

Women Tortured In Iran  

Virtual elimination of freedom of  
press and speech makes it impossible  
to obtain complete information about  
all women political prisoners.  

But we know that wives have been  
raped under the eyes of their husbands  
to make them talk. And one 4-year-old  
child was whipped and cut with scissors  
in the neck region in front of his  
mother to make her talk.

Native American Sues  

Sterilization  

LNS  

More than four years after Norma  
Jean Serena filed suit charging that  
her children had been taken from her  
and she had been sterilized against  
her will, her case will finally come  
to trial September 6 in Pittsburgh,  
Pa.  

Serena is a 40-year-old Native American,  
mother of three children.  
While she was still exhausted and  
under sedation from delivering her  
youngest child in August 1970, Serena  
was sterilized. Only afterwards  
was she informed that the operation  
was irreversible and could have serious  
side effects.  

At the same time, her three children,  
including the newly born baby,  
were placed in foster homes. It  
took three years of legal battles to  
get them back. Official estimates  
state that as many as 25 to 35 percent  
of all Native American children  
are taken away from their families.  

In her suit, Serena charges that  
she was the victim of a systematic  
conspiracy among health and welfare  
officials in Armstrong County, Penn-  
sylvania to steal her children from  
her and to sterilize her without  
her consent or knowledge.  

If Serena wins her suit it will  
be the first time that forced sterilization  
has been defined as a violation of  
civil rights. And it could provide  
an important legal precedent for a  
number of other sterilization abuse  
cases involving poor and minority women.

the next issue of BMR.
