Boy’s Club

The Burning Tree Country Club, one  
of the nation's most prestigious  
all-male clubs, can legally continue  
to bar women from its membership  
even though it receives special tax  
breaks from the state of Maryland.

Maryland's Attorney General ruled  
last week that the club, which has  
had the patronage of former President  
Gerald Ford, former Attorney General  
John Mitchell, and some of the  
nation's biggest corporate leaders,  
receives tax breaks in the form of  
reduced property tax assessments.  
The tax breaks are being withdrawn  
by the state from clubs that are  
found to discriminate against Blacks  
and other minorities.

According to the Attorney General,  
however, the clubhouse would incur  
considerable expense in trying to  
build accommodations to serve both  
sexes. The Attorney General added  
that the Burning Tree Club, unlike  
other clubs, "does not play host to  
women at any other time or any other  
place." The Attorney General said  
that the club's pro shop, separate  
from the clubhouse, allows entry to  
members' wives only by appointment  
on specific December days prior to  
Christmas.

Burning Tree, according to its own  
history of operation, has deleted the  
"male" membership requirement from  
its constitution "to register its  
freedom from bias toward the dears."

The bastion of the all-male club  
was breached only once about 23  
years ago when a small airplane  
traveling over the Montgomery County  
countryside developed trouble and  
was forced to land on the golf  
course. The historian said when a  
woman stepped out of the plane, she  
was dealt with "gallantly" until a  
taxi could be called to take her  
away.

Dirty Mops

Scrubwomen in Doncaster, England, have  
been told by the town council that they  
must continue to wash floors on their  
knees, if they want to keep their jobs.

The women had petitioned through their  
union to be allowed to use more modern  
methods of cleaning floors, saying that  
washing floors on their knees is “un-  
dignified and unnecessary."

The town council disagreed, however,  
and rejected their request. The council  
said it had been given "professional  
advice that the old way is the most  
hygienic and achieves the highest stand-  
ard of cleanliness."

Courtroom Joggers

A district court judge has aroused  
outrage among Honolulu women after  
he dismissed a charge of rape against  
a marine who reportedly hit a jog-  
ging woman with a car, threatened  
her with a bottle, and then dragged  
her to his car where he raped and  
sodomized her.

The marine reportedly told the  
woman, "If you don't do what I tell  
you, you're going to end up dead."  
The marine got charged with rape and  
sodomy.

After questioning the woman for  
20 minutes in open court, District  
Judge Robert Richardson ruled,  
however, that there was no force  
used, because the woman did not  
fight back or try to run away.

The Judge stated that the incident  
therefore did not meet the legal  
criterion for rape, and promptly  
dismissed the charge.

The marine still faces trial for  
sodomy.

A spokesperson for Honolulu's  
“Women Against Rape" told that judges  
in Hawaii are appointed, and there-  
fore, cannot be recalled by a new  
election. Judge Richardson, said the  
spokesperson, was appointed to office  
by the state's Chief Justice, William  
Richardson, who happens to be the  
district court judge's brother.

On Sunday, March 5th, Women Against  
Rape staged a public demonstration  
to protest Judge Richardson's decision.  
The protest took place in Honolulu.

The women's organization is calling  
for a special Supreme Court hearing  
to remove Judge Richardson from the  
bench.

A spokesperson for Women Against  
Rape is warning that if the rape  
charges are not reinstated, nearly  
600 women who run marathons in  
Hawaii will do their jogging in  
Judge Richardson's courtroom.

Nuns Sue Nestlé

The Bristol-Myers Corporation has  
reached an out-of-court settlement  
with an order of nuns which sued the  
corporation for “irresponsibly” marketing  
infant formula in South America.

The Sisters of the Precious Blood  
claimed in the suit that the corpora-  
tion was using high-powered advertis-  
ing to persuade women to abandon  
breast-feeding and use its product  
instead. The nuns claimed Bristol-  
Myers knew that poor women had neither  
the money to afford the formula nor  
the facilities to properly sterilize  
it.

Filed in U.S. District Court in 1977,  
the suit charged the company with mak-  
ing false statements to its stockhold-  
ers about the true nature of its mar-  
keting methods abroad.

Before that suit could come to trial,  
however, Bristol-Myers agreed, in an  
out-of-court settlement, to mail all  
its stockholders a report on the comp-  
any's foreign marketing practices.  
That statement will reportedly include  
both the nuns' allegations and the  
company's response to the charges.

The Nestlé Company, meanwhile, in  
response to a seven-month-long boy-  
cott of its products in America, has  
announced it is sending a company  
representative on a tour of the U.S.  
to explain that corporation's policies  
for marketing its baby formula in the  
third world.

Nestlé has reportedly been selling  
its baby milk formulas by sending out  
employees dressed as nurses, who per-  
suade third world mothers of newborn  
children to use Nestlé's formulas in-  
stead of breast milk to feed their  
children. In some countries, such as  
India, the cost of that formula amounts  
to more than half the weekly income of  
an entire family.

In a related matter, a plant partly  
operated by Nestlé in Medellin,  
Colombia, and a Nestlé plant at Ton-  
gala, in Australia, were reportedly  
recently found by health authorities  
in those countries to be marketing  
milk which was contaminated with bac-  
teria before it even left the plant.

Buying Breeders

The Carter Administration is sup-  
porting legislation proposing fed-  
eral adoptive subsidies that would  
pay adoptive families four times the  
amount paid to a natural mother on  
welfare to care for a minority, eth-  
nic or otherwise “hard-to-place“  
child. Some sources say that the  
Administration will complete the  
package in the near future by spon-  
soring legislation to pay maternity  
costs for poor women who agree to  
put their babies up for adoption. A  
spokesperson for Planned Parenthood  
calls the adoption subsidy plan a  
way of “bribing an unfortunate class  
of women to be breeders for the more  
fortunate." Current support payments  
for a child in foster care in NY  
State are $7,164 while the welfare  
grant in NY for both the mother and  
child is only $3,516.

Most Admired Woman

The role of protector of America's  
morals has not been easy for Anita  
Bryant. Although she was recently  
named America's Most Admired Woman  
by the readers of Good Housekeeping  
magazine, Bryant has lost hundreds  
of dollars in income, and been for-  
ced, according to one source, to  
"turn her home into an electronically  
guarded fortress."

Bryant's mail is now X-rayed before  
any of it reaches the singing "star."  
She recently cut short a New York  
City trip because of alleged death  
threats and planned demonstrations  
against her. Bryant now carries a  
special electronic device to alert  
special policemen in case of danger.

Bob Green, who is Bryant's husband  
and agent, estimates that her earn-  
ings have fallen to little more than  
a quarter of what they were before  
she began her anti-gay crusade. She  
was dropped as hostess for a planned  
television family show, and she is  
no longer asked to entertain for  
business groups and conventions.

But throughout all this, Bryant re-  
mains undaunted. "I don't hate  
homosexuals," she says, "I love them,  
I love them enough to tell them the  
truth about God and how he can save  
them."

Bryant has canceled her planned  
trip to Seattle, originally sched-  
uled for April 16. The singer was  
to perform at the Seattle Center  
Arena for King's Garden, a local  
“fundamentalist” group.

Head and Master

A Louisiana law which gave husbands  
unrestricted control over property  
owned with their wives has been  
declared unconstitutional by a civil  
district court judge in New Orleans.

The law had declared the husband  
“head and master" of jointly owned  
property, giving him the right to  
administer the property, borrow money  
on it and manage its income without  
the wife's consent.

The ruling by Judge Gerald Fedoroff  
came in the wake of a suit filed by  
a credit union against a woman and  
her husband to collect a second mort-  
gage due on their house.

The woman had unsuccessfully pro-  
tested the suit, having refused to  
sign the application for the second  
mortgage, because her husband was  
unemployed, and as sole support of  
the family, she believed the mortgage  
could not be paid.

Judge Fedoroff ruled that the woman  
was free of debt in the case and  
ordered her husband to pay the $6,000  
mortgage plus interest that he had  
signed for against his wife's will.

The "head and master" law had been  
left over from the Napoleonic Code  
and governed civil proceedings con-  
cerning community property in Louis-  
iana, the only state in the union  
yet still uses the archaic French  
law.

Red Zora

Police in Cologne, Germany, are  
on the lookout for "Red Zora," a  
woman who claims to be the female  
equivalent of “Zorro.”

It seems that someone has been  
robbing sex shops, and has, so far,  
made off with $50,000 worth of  
goods. The thief leaves leaflets  
signed "Red Zora" and claims to  
be the “avenger of the oppressed."

Says Red Zora, in one of her leaf-  
lets, “What is described as love  
today is nothing more than the dom-  
ination of women by men...the porn-  
ographers want to use our bodies to  
make their profits."

Sex shop owners, as a result of  
Zora's raids, have banded together  
to offer a $1,500 reward for her  
capture.
