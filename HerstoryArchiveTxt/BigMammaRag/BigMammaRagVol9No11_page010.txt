Arrest of Radicals Holds Implications for Nationalist Organizations, Women, Gays

"If I am silent when they
come for the Republic of New
Africa, who can be rightfully
expected to speak up when
they come for me? ...It is
the question which should
bind us together and which
should help us to focus on
our common task."

-from an address by the Rev.
Dr. William Howard, President,
National Council of Churches
of Christ, White Rock Baptist
Church, Philadelphia, PA,
October 30, 1981.

The October 20, attempted
robbery of $1.6 million from
a Brinks truck in Nyack, New
York, in which one Brinks'
guard and two police were

killed, has set off a yet
unfinished string of events
with striking implications
for progressive people in
this country.

The government story is
that the hold-up attempt was
part of a series of similar
actions recently carried out
in the New York City area by
a "gang," which allegedly
includes members of the Weather
Underground and the
Black Liberation Army. Police
immediately tried to link
the activity with other lib-
eration causes and organiza-
tions including the Republic
of New Africa, the Black Pan-
ther Party and Puerto Rican
pro-independence activists,
as well as with left-wing or
revolutionary organizations

or regimes overseas.

Arrested in connection with
the attempted robbery shortly
afterward were Katherine
Boudin, Judith Clark (both
with long feminist histories)
and David Gilbert, all with
a history in the Weather
Underground. Also arrested
was Samuel Brown, who has no
known political connections.
Eve Rosahn, a member of the
May 19 Communist Organization,
was arrested later and char-
ged with providing one of
the "getaway" cars.

These initial arrests led
to other arrests, a killing
and numerous raids, involving
harassment of both indivi-
duals and organizations. It
was three days after the
event that Samuel Smith, a

Black man, was shot to death
by police after a high-speed
chase, and Nat Burns, identi-
fied as a former Black Pan-
ther, was arrested in suppo-
sed connection with the
Brinks job. Burns was later
sent to the hospital with
cigarette burns on his arms
and internal disorders pro-
bably caused by beating in
police hands. Relatedly,
when Judith Clark and David
Gilbert were arraigned they
had blackened eyes not vis-
ible in pictures the day
before, and defense attorney
Susan Tipograph made refer-
ence in court to Samuel Brown
being beaten in custody and
needing medical attention.
The Tuesday following the
bust about 85 armed police,

Haydee Torres — POW — is Transferred

Haydee Torres is one of
eleven Puerto Rican prisoners
of war captured on April 4,
1980. The 11, 5 women and 6
men, are suspected of being
members of the FALN (Fuerzas
Armadas de Liberación Nacion-
al, the Armed Front of Nation-
al Liberation), an armed
clandestine organization
fighting for the independence
of Puerto Rico. They have
been convicted on numerous
counts, including seditious
conspiracy to overthrow the
U.S. government by force of
arms, and have received sen-
tences ranging from 55 years
to life.

Haydee Torres, as did each
of the 11, refused to parti-
cipate in her trial. She de-
clared herself a prisoner of
war and as such not under
U.S. jurisdiction. She ex-
plained to her supporters
that she is a freedom fighter,
and that the country which
illegally holds her nation as
a colony can never judge
those who have taken up arms
to liberate Puerto Rico. As
anti-colonial freedom fight-
ers, Haydee and her 10 com-
rades have demanded status as
Prisoners of War - a right
accorded them by the United
Nations and the Geneva Con-
vention.

On September 24, Haydee was
transferred without warning
and against her will to the

Metropolitan Correctional Cen-
ter in San Diego. Prison off-
icials said the transfer was
due to "reclassification,"
but the real effect is to
isolate Haydee from the sup-
port that has developed for
her in Pleasanton and in the
Bay Area. 30 Pleasanton women
responded by staging a one-
day hunger strike in solidar-
ity with Haydee the day after
she was transferred.

For the past month, Haydee
has been having serious
health problems. The prison
has pumped her with antibio-
tics and offers of tranquili-
zers to deal with the con-
stant pain. She has been told
her condition is chronic and
could develop into cancer. An
outside specialist must be
allowed to examine and treat
Haydee. We cannot forget that
Puerto Rican Nationalist,
Andres Figueroa Cordero died
of cancer contracted while
in prison, and which was left
untreated by prison doctors.
Please send a letter to de-
mand that Haydee be allowed
to see a doctor of her choice
as often as necessary to:

The 5 women POW's, Dylcia
Pagan, Carmen Valentin,
Alicia Rodriguez, Lucy Rod-
riguez and Haydee Torres come

from a long history of Puerto
Rican women in the struggle
for independence. Alejandrina
Torres of the National Comm-
ittee to Free Puerto Rican
POW's described some of that
history. "Mariana Bracetti
not only sewed the flag of
Lares (the town where the
first republic of Puerto Rico
was declared in 1868), but
she was an active member of
the secret society. She tra-
veled through Puerto Rico
before 1868, organizing cells
and carrying messages between
the revolutionary centers.
Luisa Capatillo was one of
the founders of the Puerto
Rican labor movement during
the first decade of the pre-
sent century. Together with
Juana Colon, she led militant
demonstrations for the rights
of Puerto Rican workers and
defined the role of women in
the struggle as absolute
equality. . . .Blanca Carnales
led the armed column which
took Jayuya in 1950, the only
town to be liberated and the
last to fall to the enemy.
Isabel Rosado, a heroic com-
batant in the 1950 insurrec-
tion, was, at the age of 77,
one of the Vieques 21 arrested
for protesting the U.S. Navy
occupation in Vieques, Puerto
Rico.
Maria Cueto and Raisa Neme-
kin preferred prison rather
than collaborate with a fed-
eral grand jury investigating

the Puerto Rican national
liberation movement. Lolita
Lebron led the March 1, 1954
attack on the U.S. Congress
to focus world attention on
the colonial status of Puerto
Rico.

These women are an example
of how to fight the dual op-
pressions of patriarchy and
imperialism. As fighters for
their own and our liberation,
we must give them our active
support.

A helicopter and armored
trucks converged on a rural
Copiah County, Mississippi,
farmhouse arresting Fulani
Sunni-Ali (Cynthia Boston)
on charges of conspiracy in
the Brinks hold-up. The
arrest was apparently an
attempt to implicate the
Republic of New Afrika, a
Black nationalist organiza-
tion of which Sunni-Ali is
a member. No evidence, be-
sides an apparently mistaken
eyewitness account, was found
to link her to the New York
incident, and a mechanic in
New Orleans confirmed that
she was at his garage in that
city at the time of the inci-
dent. Nevertheless, the spec-
ter of the RNA as a violent
group was projected as the
military sweep of north Miss-
issippi made national head-
lines and small children in
the house were led away in
handcuffs.

Sunni-Ali has since been
released but has been sub-
poenaed to appear before a
New York grand jury in this
case. She has stated that
she intends to sue the fed-
eral government over the
manner of the arrest. "I
charge that the U.S. govern-
ment is guilty of terrorism,"
she said at a press confer-
ence. "My arrest was clearly
an opportunistic move and a
conspiracy . . . to use mil-
itary force, supported by
its legal system, to subdue
revolutionary organizations,
black and white."

The events in New York and
Mississippi raise several
political and civil liberties
issues. The FBI, already no-
torious for its disregard
for constitutional rights,
has invoked federal racke-
teering statutes to broaden
its legal latitude in making

arrests, search and seizure
and surveillance. The Racke-
teering Influenced and Cor-
rupt Organizations Act of
1970 states that if an organ-
ization commits any of 32
different crimes within a

ten-year period the organiza-
tion can be considered a
"criminal conspiracy" and all
its members are subject to
prison terms of up to 20
years even if they indivi-
dually have done nothing.

Although the government has
invoked the organized crime
dragnet procedures, it has not
as yet engaged in as sweeping
arrests and harassment as it
might. Clearly this is an in-
dication of a test of their
procedures - and the unity of
the progressive movements.

The government has further,
through its media, vaguely
alleged ties between domestic
dissidents and foreign govern-
ments and liberation movements
in order to promote its con-
spiracy theory of internation-
al "terrorism." Mentioned so
far are connections between
the Weather Underground and
Cuba, the Irish Republican
Army, and others implied but
not named.

The basis of these allega-
tions are suspect to say the
least. The WUO - Cuba connec-
tion is supposed to derive
from the statements of a for-
mer FBI informant, Larry
Garthwohl, that when he in-
filtrated the Weather Under-
ground it was possible, by
giving a code name to an in-
telligence officer at the
Cuban embassies in Canada or
Mexico, to contact other WUO
members. But Garthwohl, who
wrote an entire book (Bringing
Down America, 1976) on his
underground experiences, has
never before mentioned this
juicy bit of information.

Finally, the government is
also alleging a conspiracy
between the Brinks defendants
and other progressive groups
in this country. Thus far
Third World groups are being
primarily targeted in this
“conspiracy" and for such
groups this intimidation is
nothing new. For instance,
the so-called shoot-out be-
tween the RNA and police in
Jackson, Miss., in 1971 is
again being described as gov-
ernment self-defense against
terrorists, but Freedom of
Information probes since then

have forced the release of
FBI memos discounting any RNA
conspiracy and thus supporting
the RNA contention that the
event was in fact a planned
military assault on RNA head-
quarters. The history of vio-
lent repression of Third
World peoples goes on and on -
from the assassination of
Black Panther Fred Hampton

as he slept in his bed in
Chicago, to the second terror
of Wounded Knee and Pine
Ridge, to the fanatically
overproduced arrest of Fulani
Sunni-Ali.

This repression has been,
and continues to be primarily
aimed at people of color,
partially because white sup-
remacism condones it, but
more importantly because the
conditions of Third World
people force them to resort
to armed struggle for self-
defense and to achieve their
liberation.

It is also clear that this
repression is aimed at those
white people who identify with
the struggle of Third World
people, and especially against
those who support armed strug-
gle in its present state in
the U.S.: developmental and
sporadic.

It is no accident that the
busts are being used by the
police in this manner. This
has been a time when huge
portions of the women's move-
ments, the gay and lesbian
movements, and the left gen-
erally have been seriously
looking at the effects and
the history of racism on
their movements. The measures
taken by the police around
this incident, therefore, pro-
vide an extraordinarily cru-
cial test for the left and
progressive people generally
in this country. The robbery
and the strategy implied in
it are bound to - and should -
spark widespread political
debate.

In such a discussion, three
issues are crucial to address.
One is the issue of the right
of Third World people to de-
fend themselves by any means
necessary. While individual
tactical issues are always
open to question, the history
of government repression
proves the inevitability of
armed resistance on the part
of Black, Native, Chicano/
