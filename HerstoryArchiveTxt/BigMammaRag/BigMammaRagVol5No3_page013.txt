speech to Juniata College 2/20/69

To be so oppressed that you don't  
see your oppression. "I have every-  
thing I need, I don't feel oppressed,"  
said one member of the cast of  
"Women," after the performance March  
13th at Colorado Women's College.

To have spent from thirteen to six-  
teen years immersed in study of pat-  
riarchal history, value systems, cul-  
ture, mores, myths and heroes.

To not yet have realized first hand  
and head on the daily discrepancies  
between self expectations and societal  
expectations.

Perspective.

The theatre event, "Women," per-  
formed ten evenings during the first  
two weeks of March gives the audience  
perspective into the realms of tradi-  
tional white middle-class college wo-  
men. It also requires perspective on  
the part of the audience, as the play  
is not political in its perception of  
women. The feminist in the audience  
can appreciate the deep personal in-  
sights shared by the cast, but is  
bound to leave after the last scene  
wishing for more political reality.

Are not all experiences relating to  
becoming and being a woman inherently  
political?

The play itself is based on a new  
play “Three Women" by Cynthia Baker  
Johnston, Sandy Lipton, Roberta Maguire  
and Cecil O'Neal, but the CWC actres-  

MOTHER TONGUE

It is possible, even with the close  
network of feminist communications  
across the country, for a woman to  
publish two books and still be rela-  
tively unknown. To be poetry editor  
of Womanspirit and still fade into  
the rim of a canyon in Taos. It is  
like having a powerful voice sudden-  
ly mute--and this is a voice that  
speaks of Mother tongue. As Barbara  
Mor's first book, Bitter Root Rituals  
also indicates, there is a sharpness  
to this voice, a cutting edge to this  
mother, but the venom is well-direct-  
ed, for it is the sound of a woman  
acutely witnessing, then lashing out  
in a final burst against the ravish-  
ing male energy.

This book was put together by three  
women all separated by time and space  
Barbara in New Mexico, Helen McKenna  
(who wrote The Toilet Book) and Kris  
Macdonald on the West Coast. They  
triangled their energies to put this  
book together, finally, for it was  
written six years ago when Barbara  
was in another space in her head and  
needed airing soon.

This long poem, combined with pic-  
tures and photos, begins with a bir-  
thing in the primal waters, the  
“pure anatomies of dreams" without  
the presence of men. And always the  
question: "Tell me what I am, this  
energy in the blood." The first  
part of the process is one in which  
woman defines who she is in terms of  
men or in conflict with them. His-  
tory is the story of the conquest of  
men to know what this woman is; epics  
are stories of their lust. In this  
context, woman is portrayed as mute,  
passive loser. The men suck power  
from the anonymity of women. But  
this poem is about a woman ready to  
turn in the nexus, waiting for "the  
silent key of my mind."

The poem shifts for this same wom-  
an, who senses her stature is one  
with the archetypes--like the great  
cow Audumla who has the milk of the  

Culture

ses have used the script as a frame-  
work around which to express their own  
experiences as women. The eleven cast  
members alternated appearances on dif-  
ferent nights, five one night and six  
the next, which actually made the play  
into two versions. Each woman tried  
to write and act her own particular  
woman identity into her part. Thus,  
"Women" is a series of short interac-  
tions and monologues--performed in the  
round without props and with everyday  
attire.

As a whole the play works well.  
Its common theme, the personal exper-  
iences of womanhood, unifies it flu-  
idly. There is no obvious order to  
the scenes, no stilted or over-impos-  
ed organization. The moods range re-  
freshingly and the tone modulates  
from intensity to intentional aban-  
don.

The most convincing scenes are  
those which are closest to the actual  
lives of the actresses. A brainscan,  
devised by the cast, expresses the  
agonies of filling one's life into  
a questionnaire. Using only voice  
inflections and arm movements the  
cast conveys the frustrations of  
bending a real life to fit a compu-  
ter, the powerlessness at being at  
the mercy of doctors, the pressure to  
conform to society's 'yes' or 'no'  
categories. A six-way simultaneous  
telephone call home to Mother from  
college--the long-distance attempt  
at communication. A pet show/beauty  
show which finishes with the superb  
line, "Why are these women competing?"

Those scenes which are least be-  
lievable are those most removed from  
the real experiences of the college  
age cast. A monologue in which a  
mother explains her despair at her  
son's leaving home, and another by a  
welfare mother are immediate illus-  

human race flowing from her--remem-  
bers the solitary woman within her  
who suffers daily from abuses. Men  
from age seven grabbing at her  
breasts, her crotch. Who one awful  
night ran from a carload of them,  

her cunt and life shivering with her  
destiny. Outwaiting them, this crea-  
ture who knows how to wait. How many  
indignities can the woman who has  
made the world out of her body take?  
The second half of the poem is the  
beginning of an answer she never fin-  
ishes articulating, but it is a be-  
ginning. The poem is the ultimate  
return blow job.

For me, it is really the last time  
I want to hear poetry moan against  
such defilement. Mor's words and  
images come strong in this Amerika  
where the male texture to words is a  
rape of the senses, where a woman  
says, “Am I your jagslot juice machine/  
plug in that slug and shake me down/  
O when I dream/ when I cream/ bring  
down that boom." Woman as object.  
Woman as stage in someone else's bed  
scenario, spreading her legs, thighs  
slightly bruised.

The poem ends with an incantation,  
a recitative between the strident  
human voices and the sounds of nature  
for the "slamming bone hand can shut  
her up no more." She says a new song  
is growing, "the time has come/ to  
make a noise/ as loud and strong/ as  
silence was."

This poem should be an epitaph  
poem, where a woman puts to rest once  
and for all--and with such powerful  
eloquence--"the dreadful that has  
already happened." The devastating  
goodbye to cleft tongue, hello  
mother tongue. Next time, may all  
this power, may the source of this  
incredible imagery be directed to-  
ward creating that woman's world  
from the depth of your being; fare-  
well to the poetry of rape. Life is  
energy and love turning the body for  
yourself. Be your own poem, friend.

trations. The acting is sincere yet  
in both the spark of authenticity  
never quite catches. Also the wel-  
fare mother monologue suffers from  
its poor South dialect...

The numerous interactions dealing  
with childhood and adolescence are  
successful in that women in the au-  
dience can easily and immediately re-  
late to them--the "Oh, I remember  
that," experience. There are occa-  
sional unnecessary flavors of Edith  
Ann/Lily Tomlin cuteness, but the  
scenes are fun. In one scene, when a  
woman is explaining her emotional  
depression after her first sexual re-

lationship with a man, the acting is  

moving and convincing. The last line  
however, belittles the entire mood  
which the scene has built. A throw-  
away, Mary Hartman line, a line for a  
laugh that if someone said in every-  
day conversation, no matter how naive  
she would immediately regret.  
Following performance the cast in-  
vited the audience to remain for a  
discussion of reactions, comments,  
and criticisms. The ensuing state-  
ments, questions, and petty arguments  
proved only too well Ti-Grace's

Production Group

In February, a new feminist collec-  
tive was formed to bring women's cul-  
ture to Denver. Based on the success  
of the Meg Christian concert, earlier  
in the month, a group of women decided  
to organize Virago Productions, to  
produce more forms of entertainment  
for the women of Denver.

According to Ronnie Ewoldt, as a re-  
sult of the Meg Christian concert, an  
unexpectedly substantial amount of  
money was generated by the women's  
community. While discussing this with  
friends, it became apparent that this  
money should be turned back to the  
community and any decisions should be  
made by a group of women, not one in-  
dividual.

Along with Ewoldt, Kathy Barriga,  
Sue (Sprout) Haymes, Connie Hoes,  
Gayle Novak, Kathy Pantzer, and Cheryl  
Peake formed the Virago Productions  
collective. (Virago originally meant  
a woman of exceptional strength, but  
was later changed to a woman of bad  
temper and unusual size and strength).

The priorities of the collective  
are two-fold: to bring women's culture  
to Denver and to the women incarcer-  
ated at the Women's Correctional In-  
stitution in Canyon City.

Virago policy, regarding production  
of concerts, is to secure an agreement  
by the performer to put on an all-  
women's concert. If the performer  
wishes, the collective would try,  
also, to obtain a booking at another  
location, open to the general public,  
in addition to an all-women's concert.

At present, the collective is in  
contact with Teresa Trull (of Olivia  
Records) and the Wallflower Dance Or-  
der, hoping to arrange appearances  
sometime this summer.

One project which has generated a  
great deal of enthusiasm within the  
collective is the prospect of holding  
an event similar to the Sisterhood  
Revival. This would be in the form  
of outdoor festivities including food,  
tarot readings, singing, dancing, and  
a re-enactment of the usual religious  
revivals with testimonials of feminist  
consciousness, coming out, etc.

the less, the women of the play ad-  
mitted seriously that they wanted to  
understand the roles of older women;  
they seemed eager for constructive  
input for additions to the play. "Did  
it shock you to have someone declare  
her lesbianism?" One woman replied  
that it sounded angry as though it  
were a challenge. But it felt real.  
It was from the heart. The glimmer-  
ings of awareness of the injustice  
were sparkling.

It has been said that the first  
six months a woman spends beyond col-  
lege are more educational than all  
the years preceding. If this is  
true, the 11 women of the CWC drama  
department who have opened themselves  
to "Women," to their audiences, and  
to their own emotions, will be well  
prepared for the changes and adjust-  
ments of life beyond college. It is  
heartening that Betsy Lowenne Reagan  
stated in the program of "Women,"  

"It has been frustrating; there is so  
much more to women than is shown in  
our play. As always, I remind myself  
that we can't show every aspect of  
women at once."

The $3.00 admission to "Women" is  
indeed more wisely and enjoyably  
spent than the $3.00 admission price  
of most current films. It is refresh-  
ing to share in these women's ex-  
periences and although the play may  
be criticized for not going far or  
deep enough politically--in perspec-  
tive--not pretending or trying to be  
feminist theatre, it is well worth  
the investment of time and money.

The cast hopes to continue changing  
and enlarging the play and would like  
to tour with it to better share their  
own investments and to better learn  
from their diverse audiences.

Gathers Viragos

In the future, Virago looks forward  
to bringing to the Denver area various  
forms of entertainment; music, art,  
dance, and theater.

The second priority, though no less  
in importance, is to provide an alter-  
native culture for the women in Canyon  
City. The Collective hopes to bring  
strong women's music to the prison to  
counter the role models presented by  
the institutional process. If Virago  
is unsuccessful at getting inside the  
walls, members hope to be able to
