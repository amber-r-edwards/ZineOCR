children happen in the home."
It is therefore perfectly
clear that the "State has not
provided adequate protection
and prevention. Part of
protection and prevention is
the law of the land, yet
according to the law (in
Britain and in most states
in the USA), sexual inter-
course within marriage is a
man's conjugal prerogative,
and a woman's conjugal duty.
That is, rape in marriage is
a husband's right. Therefore,
where rape in marriage is
concerned, the law not only
fails to protect the woman.
It actively takes the side
of the rapist." (The book
gives a summary of inter-
national victories where we
have fought and won the case
for the criminalization of
marital rape: in Denmark,
Norway, Sweden; in Poland,
Czechoslovakia, the USSR; in
the USA the states of Dela-
ware, Iowa, Nebraska, New

Jersey, Oregon, Massachusetts,
Florida, California, Conn.,
New Hampshire, Minnesota)

to use my history as an
Asian American woman worker
to build upon our leadership
as militant feminists toward
a socialist feminist revolu-
tion. And when one has the
vision, program, commitment
and energy -- and the desire
to ensure equality for all
women and oppressed groups

then working in political
organizations such as Radical
Women and the Freedom Social-
ist Party will help to create
the kind of society that we
want and will have.

The building of women's
leadership is crucial to our
survival in the movements
for social change. Clara
Fraser, in a Radical Women
document, "Woman As Leader:
Double Jeopardy on Account
of Sex," uses the term 'lead-
ership’ in the political,
rather than professional or
business-tycoon sense. Lead-
ership, Fraser says, connotes
a relationship between a
movement or group or bloc,
and its vanguard. The van-
guard is composed of a
cadre that is voluntary and
is democratically selected.
The boss or general who
hires or who drafts a staff

rapist, where does this
leave the children? This
document leaves us in no
doubt: "When women are

in a position vulnerable to
rape, so are their children.
If a woman does not have the
money to leave a situation
where she is in danger, she
does not have the money to
take her children away if the
threat is against them
either."

At this juncture in the
movement against battering
and rape, the question of
financial protection and
government's responsibility
is pivotal. We are faced, on
the one hand, with the know-
ledge of a "high correlation
between economic self-suffi-
ciency" and a woman's ability
to leave a violent relation-
ship" (Western States Shelter
Network ‘Spring Newsletter,
1982), and, on the other
hand, with the reality of the
entrapment of women and chil-
dren in "situations where
they are vulnerable to rape
because they are financially
dependent on the man who is

raping them." (From a letter
by WR to Home Secretary
William Whitelaw, Minister in
charge of “law and order")
This evidence by WAR clari-
fies our legitimate claim, as
citizens, to financial pro-
tection and resources from
the State.

The Rapist Who Pays the
Rent is a sound formulation
which effectively challenges
the legal establishment and
provides recommendations for
action that address directly
the issue of racism. (The
Criminal Law Revision Com-
mittee has agreed to meet
with WAR this Spring.)

is not a ‘leader,' nor is an
expert in some field who
does not create a movement.
A leader leads others,
expresses and influences

the ideas and feelings of
others, and acts in concert
with others to change the
social and cultural climate.

My life is crowded, full,
rewarding, yet tiring. But
with revolutionary optimism
and with revolutionary goals
of a just society, the pos-
sibilities for freedom from
our triple oppression of
race, sex, and class are
endless. Now with Reagan-
omics, the Moral Majority,
the Human Life Amendment,
the Family Protection Act,
the threat of global nuclear
war, the harassment
of immigrants; the bilin-
gual ballot probe, and other
forms of oppression, we have
the opportunity as radicals
and militant feminists to
fully use our brains and our
hearts to fight back and
win.

We, as women of color, as
lesbians, and as workers,
can and must lead the way.
Without us, nothing's going
to change. With us, changes
will be made. And a social-
ist democracy is the only

logical avenue where those
changes will take place.
To close I'd like to read

an excerpt from a piece

of prose that I wrote titled

"Broad Shoulders:"

Her sisters would always
be around her: the blood
sisters but especially her
revolutionary sisters,
the ones who spoke out
protesting racist stereo-
types in a play, the ones
who unflinchingly and elo-
quently spoke about the
strength and leadership
of women workers, lesbians,
women of all colors, wo-
men of all ages, women of
all nations. These revolu-
tionary sisters, her com-
rades, with the broadest,
most beautiful shoulders
of all. She learned from
them because her eyes were
wide open now. Somehow her
eyes had decided to come
out from hiding and nudged
her tofu shoulders, firm
and yet tender, and as she
looked out into the night,
she saw the women, walking
shoulder to shoulder, she
saw the dark violets
blooming around them as
they rose and lifted the
world from her red, red
heart.
