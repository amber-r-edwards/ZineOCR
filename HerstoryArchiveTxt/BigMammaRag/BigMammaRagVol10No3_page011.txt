Woman-- That Two-Faced

Marilyn Coffey

Woman as She-Devil, who  
doesn't know her, that cold  
bitch, her face half human  
and half blank. Feelingless  
One look can turn you to  
stone. Oh, she's a hard-  
hearted mama, make no mis-  
take. A real man-hating ball  
chopper, watch out for her,  
if you don't want to be cut  
down to size. Yah, hen-  
pecking her poor mate--  
what a harpy she is! She'll  
clip your wings with her  
sharp tongue, cut your hair,  
knock the wind out of your  
sails, swallow your semen,  
suck your blood dry, the  
vampire. The vamp.

For she's sly, Woman.  
Sneaky. Can't trust her.  
She's not one for stepping  
out into the open and con-  
fronting you, oh, no. She  
hides behind domesticity,  
sitting there by the cradle,  
spinning away. But don't try  
to reason with her. She's  
all Eros, she'll suck you  
right into her whirlpool of  
emotions, she'll drive you  
crazy, she'll drive you  
insane. Gotta watch her, or  
she'll dress you in women's  
clothes and hand you a  
spindle. Scheming. Always  
scheming. Got cheating on her  
mind, and that's not all.  
She's a real spider lady.  
Black widow. Out for blood.  
Oh, looks innocent enough,  
but make no mistake. The  
praying mantis is only biding  
her time. Lying in wait. A  
ravisher at heart, weaving  
her net to snag poor sailors  
and drag them to the bottom  
of the sea sea sea.

There's no satisfying her.  
She's insatiable. Perfect  
isn't good enough for her,  
she's got a voracious  
appetite, an ogress who can  
gobble up whole villages,

An endless cavern, bottom-  
less pit, her strange body  
swelling up periodically

and spewing forth babies and  
blood -- who knows what else  
she eats? Her vagina, a  
veritable cauldron of  
iniquity. Stick your prick in,  
and it'll come out covered  
with sores -- if it comes  
out at all. A real dog, Woman.  
She'd as soon crack a man's  
bone as swallow it. Suckles  
her boys at her breasts,

then turns them loose for  
cannon fodder.

Oh, she's a fiend, Woman.

Hiding behind bushes, in  
coves, ravishing the young,  
the innocent. There's more  
than sympathy in her tea.  
She'll lure you to bed, only  
to devour you. Poisons her  
husbands, one, two, three.  
She'd as soon trample a man  
to death as look at him,  
sporting skulls around her  
neck like trophies. Drinking  
blood out of skull cups.  
Eating her own children.  
Killing her son and riding  
a mule out of town, her  
son's flayed skin for a  
saddle.

that the Sun-God Ra feared  
for the human race -- but he  
was powerless to stop Sekhmet.  
She would have killed them  
all, if Ra hadn't tricked her  
into drunkenness.

It's as old as Chicomecoatl,  
the pre-Aztec Corn Mother  
with seven snakes, who bore  
death's head, demanded human  
hearts, drank blood. It's  
as old as India's Kali, the  
Black One, garlanded with  
corpses and human skulls,  
overpowering a thousand  
giants and celebrating her  
bloody victory with a dance.

It's as simple as hate.  
But hate isn't really that  
simple.

“Any woman who does any-  
thing is automatically a

witch, be she queen, crone  
or step-mother," writes Rascha  
Levinson in a book review in

It were only that  
easy. But it is not. For woman  
as She-Devil is only half of

a very two-sided coin, and

the other half is Angel.  
Princess. Snow-White.  
Cinderella. Venus. Guinevere.  
Earth Mother. Vestal Virgin.

Fiend, hag, ogress, witch,  
old and wrinkled and gray,  
riding out of Hades on a  
goat, surrounded by a retinue  
of hounds. Turning men into  
beasts. Into pigs. Beware  
her evil eye. Yah.

Who wouldn't hate such a  
bitch? Fuck her in the ass  
that'll learn her. For such  
a vision of Woman is the  
ultimate justification for  
misogyny. Ask Henry Miller,  
he knows. For that matter,  
ask Norman Mailer. ¥

It's a view that's as  
ancient as legend and myth.  
It's as old as Egypt's  
Sekhmet, lioness goddess of  
war, who hurled herself  
against men with such fervor

so wild it shook the earth.  
As old as Palden Lamo, pro-  
tectoress of Tibet's Dalai  
Lama, who killed her son and  
used his flayed skin as her  
mule blanket. As old as  
Cybele, whose frenzied  
followers mutilated them-  
selves, as old as the  
valkyries, who choose which  
warriors would die in battle,  
as old as Hel, sovereign of  
the Teutonic underworld,  
whose face is half human,  
half blank. As the Fates,  
who spin out our destiny.

As Ran, the ravisher, net-  
ting sailors. As old as the  
Furies, the Harpies, Pandora.  
As Chimaera. As the Sirens.  
As Medusa.

Madonna. Miss America. There  
was a little girl and she  
had a little curl, right down  
the middle of her forehead.

Woman, from this perspec-  
tive; is decidedly two-faced.  
Two-bodied, in fact. As shown  
by the "Frau Welt" statue  
that decorates the Cathedral  
of Worms in Germany, a  
gracious woman in front and  
eaten by maggots and crawling  
with toads behind. As shown  
by the Sirens, beautiful  
water nymphs on top, and sea  
monsters below, singing their  
exquisite songs and gobbling  
up the seduced.

That's Aphrodite, Goddess  
of Love, for mercy's sake,  
over there eating her

lovers. That's Lamia, beloved  
of Zeus, huddled in that cave  
devouring babies. Even Kali's  
breasts are swollen with  
milk...

There she stood, a vision  
of loveliness, slim and  
lithe, blonde hair drifting  
down into the wind, hands  
open, yet not demanding, and  
as he drew closer, he could  
smell the delicate perfumes  
of her body mingling with...  
something else. Something  
unnameable. Something he's  
smelled before, his small  
boy nose buried in his  
mother's menstrual lap. He  
approached. She turned. Her  
naked back -- he should  
have known! -- was festering  
with sores. Toads, lizards,  
snails, edged up and down  
her slimy skin, the odor of  
putrefaction overpowering  
and yet, there she was, the  
rose-like quality of her  
perfumes still tangible,  
her face -- as she turned  
once more -- the color of  
warm cream, her lips like  
ripe young cherries, her  
voice, so melodious, it  
made him swoon, her mouth,  
opening, the gentle notes  
wafting out like bird's  
trilling, yet languid, loving  
++:He dropped to his knees  
before her, how could he but  
worship a creature of such  
grace! such beauty! when,  
without warning, she lifted  
her skirts to reveal: a  
veritable Medusa's head,

a tangle of snakes, and  
pubic hair, and blood, and  
awful putrefaction. He  
fainted.

He woke: it was Mona Lisa,  
fading into: Mata Hari:  
turning into Guinevere:  
who slipped into Malekula  
the spider woman: into Venus:  
into Charybdis, the whirl-  
pool: into Helen of Troy:  
into the Styx. It is the  
Virgin Mary fading into  
Kali.

Perpetuated by mythology.  
Perpetuated by Christianity.  
And perpetuated by writers,  
down to the modern day. But  
with changes. The stuff of  
mythology has become the  
stuff of everyday reality.  
We have reduced our Gods  
to ourselves, and are busy  
projecting them on one  
another.

Eugene O'Neill focused on  
the effect the beatific  
vision has on man in the  
climactic speech at the end

of The Iceman Cometh, where  
salesman Hickey explains  
why he killed his wife,  
Evelyn, who was a model of  
love and forgiveness. Hickey  
says:

It kept piling up, like  
I've said. I got so I thought  
of it all the time. I hated  
myself more and more, think-  
ing of all the wrong I'd done  
to the sweetest woman in the  
world who loved me so much.

I got so I'd curse myself for  
a lousy bastard every time I  
saw myself in the mirror.

I felt such pity for her it  
drove me crazy. You wouldn't  
believe a guy like me, that's  
knocked around so much, could  
feel such pity. It got so  
every night I'd wind up  
hiding my face in her lap,  
bawling and begging her for-  
giveness. And, of course,  
she'd always comfort me and  
say, "Never mind, Teddy, I  
know you won't ever again.  
Christ, I loved her so, but I  
began to hate that pipe  
dream! I began to be afraid I  
was going bughouse, because  
sometimes I couldn't forgive  
her for forgiving me. I even  
caught myself hating her for  
making me hate myself so  
much. There's a limit to the  
guilt you can feel and the  
forgiveness and the pity you  
can take! You have to begin  
blaming someone else, too.

I got so sometimes when she'd  
kiss me it was like she did  
it on purpose to humiliate  
me, as if she'd spit in my  
face! But all the time I saw  
how crazy and rotten of me  
that was, and it made me

hate myself all the more.  
You'd never believe I could  
hate so much, a good-natured,  
happy-go-lucky slob like  
me...

So Hickey killed her. He  
picked up a gun and shot her  
through the head head head.  
Then, standing over her bed,  
looking down at her body, he  
reflected:

And then I saw I'd always  
known that was the only  
possible way to give her  
peace and free her from the  
misery of loving me.

I saw it meant peace for me,  
too, knowing she was at  
peace. I felt as though a  
ton of guilt was lifted off  
my mind. I remember I stood  
by the bed and suddenly I  
had to laugh. I couldn't  
help it, and I knew Evelyn  
would forgive me. I remember

"a cancer.

I heard myself speaking to  
her, as if it was something  
I'd always wanted to say:  
"Well, you know what you can  
do with your pipe dream now  
you damned bitch!"...No! I  
never--!...No! That's a lie!  
I never said! Good God, I  
couldn't have said that! If I  
did, I'd gone insane! ...Why,  
Evelyn was the only thing on  
God's earth I ever loved! I'd  
have killed myself before I'd  
ever have hurt her!

The Virgin Mary makes an  
intolerable wife, it seems.  
D. H. Lawrence couldn't  
agree more. He perpetuates  
the virgin/witch concept of  
Woman in his Studies in  
Classical American Literature.

Woman is a strange and  
rather terrible phenomenon,  
to man. When subconscious  
soul of woman recoils from  
its creative union with man,  
it becomes a destructive  
force. It exerts, willy-nilly  
an invisible destructive in-  
fluence. The woman herself  
may be as nice as milk, to  
all appearance.... But she  
is sending out waves of  
silent destruction of the  
faltering spirit in men, all  
the same. She doesn't know  
it, She can't even help it.  
But she does it. The devil  
is in her....

The very women who are  
most busy saving the bodies  
of men, and saving the  
children: these women-doctors,  
these nurses, these education-  
alists, these public-spirited  
women, these female saviours:  
they are all, from the inside,  
sending out waves of destruc-  
tive malevolence which eat out  
the inner life of a man, like  
It is so, it will  
be so, till men realize it  
and react to save themselves.

God won't save us. The  
women are so devilish godly.  
Men must save themselves in  
this strait, and by no sugary  
means either.

A woman can use her sex in  
sheer malevolence and poison,  
while she is behaving as  
meek and good as gold. Dear  
darling, she is really snow-  
white in her blamelessness.  
And all the while she is  
using her sex as a she-devil,  
for the endless hurt of her  
man. And if you give her a  
slap in the face for her  
fiendishness, she will rush  
to the first magistrate, in  
indignation. She is so

absolutely blameless, the  
She-devil, the dear, dutiful  
creature.

Give her the great slap,  
just the same, just when she  
is being most angelic. Just  
when she is bearing her cross  
most meekly.

Oh, woman out of bounds is  
devil.

Henry Miller, Norman Mailer  
et al, simply continue the  
tradition. But in the so-  
called war between the sexes,  
misogyny, is really a cover-  
up. It is the battle of self  
with self that is being waged  
in the name of the battle of  
the sexes. All the more  
strange, coming from a man  
like Lawrence, who was so  
cognizant of the mysticism  
that lies at the base of  
sexual union. And still. . .

It is Carl Jung who picked  
up on the numinous quality of  
our Projections. "Archetypes  
have, when they appear," he  
said, "a distinctly numinous  
character which can only be  
described as ‘spiritual’  
if ‘magical’ is too strong a  
word." Anima and animus. A  
deep aspect of the psyche,  
Projected out into the world,  
in order to be dealt with.  
“The effect of anima and  
animus," writes Jung,  
extremely difficult to  
eliminate because, in the  
first place, it is uncommonly  
strong and immediately fills  
the ego-personality with an  
unshakable feeling of right-  
ness and righteousness. In  
the second place, the cause  
of the effect is projected,  
and appears to lie in objects  
and objective situations.

For a man, the anima. The  
Woman. She. For a Woman, the  
animus. Men. They. We are so  
much in their grip, we can't  
even see them. Which is to  
be expected, of projections.  
Says Jung, of the anima:

Every mother and every  
beloved is forced to become  
the carrier and embodiment  
of this omnipresent and age-  
less image, which corresponds  
to the deepest reality in a  
man. It belongs to him,  
this perilous image of Woman;  
she stands for the loyalty  
which in the interests of  
life he must forgo; she is  
the much needed compensation  
for all the risks, struggles,  
sacrifices that all end in  
disappointment; she is the
