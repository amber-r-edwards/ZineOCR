THE POOR WOMAN'S GUIDE TO COLLEGE by Eileen Gray.

For possibly the first time, a guide of this nature has turned the
spotlight on poor women. Based on a survey of women at seven San
Francisco Bay Area colleges, it highlights not only the problems en-
countered by returning women students, but the joys and satisfactions
as well. While older women will find the ideas very helpful, this book is
intended for the reentry woman of any age.

CA 94110, Unit price: 65¢.

Polywog

Opens

The Denver-Boulder area has
a new professional children’s
theater.

Polywog Productions, located
at 600 Arapahoe Ave. #4,
Boulder, was founded earlier
this fall by Producer/Director
Judith Aplon to establish a
“season of live theater for
children of all ages” in the
Boulder-Denver area.

Ms. Aplon, former owner of
the Orangutan Toy Store in
Boulder, was trained at the
Goodman Theater in Chicago,
has taught courses in theater at
Community College of Denver,
has served as artist-in-
residence at Baker University in
Kansas, and is well-known to
Boulder audiences for her work
with both the University Theater
and Nomad Players for such
roles as Caitlin in “Dylan” and
Vinnie in “Come Slowly Eden.”

She has directed many
children’s productions, in-
cluding “The Clown Who Ran
Away” for Nomad Theatre.

Joining Ms. Aplon in creating
Polywog Productions are Denis
Williams, associate producer;
Lloydine Mecklenberg,
choreography; Michael Chetter-
bock, costumes; and Nona Kayn,
publicity. All have worked or
been involved extensively in
theatre in the Denver/Boulder
area.

The theatre’s first offering,
“Androcles and the Lion,” is a
musical adaptation by Aurand
Harris of the familiar children’s
story, and is written in the style
of an Italian Commedia Dell'arte.

Performance dates for “An-
drocles and the Lion” will be
December 19, 21, and 22 at the
Wesley Foundation in Boulder.

If you are interested in work-
ing with Polywog Productions,
