erty are different from men's.

These are but a few of the
most popular catchphrases
of an analysis termed the
“feminization of poverty".

The heart of the “femin-
ization of poverty" perspect-
ive is the proposition that
women are bearing the brunt
of economic hardship in the
Reagan era and now make up
the "new American underclass."
Specifically, it argues
that all or almost all of
today's poor are women and
that all or almost all wo-
men are in imminent danger
of becoming poor.

Two trends are used to

back up this assertion: 1st;
the disintegration of two-
parent families which leaves

women to bear the responsi-

bility and expense for
child-rearing alone; and 2nd
the low-wage status of women
and their reliance on ever
scarcer social services in
order to survive.

“Feminization of poverty"
is not only an analysis of
women's declining status.
Its promoters also see it
as the basis for an organiz-
ing strategy with the po-
tential to mobilize millions
of women and revive the wo-
men's movement in the 1980s.
This vision is shared by
liberals, radicals and soc-
ialists alike. According to
the May 1983 issue of the
Democratic Socialists of
America's (DSA) Bay Area
newsletter, "A focus on the
feminization of poverty is
important for the women's
movement...it offers a new
bond which cuts across class,
age, race and sexual prefer-
ence because women are in
fact just a husband away
from poverty." Vulnerability
to impoverishment is seen
as the common condition of
all women, and thus, the
issue to organize them into
united political action.
Although it is riddled
with distortions about who
indeed has borne the brunt
of poverty in this country,
the "feminization of poverty"
analysis has rapidly gained
widespread popularity as an

accurate depiction of wo-
men's current condition.
That the liberal feminists
have advanced such an anal-
ysis is no particular sur-
prise. They have never got-
ten high marks for remembering
the widely divergent
class realities faced by
different strata of women.
But the fact that the left,
too, has swallowed this an-
alysis hook, line and sink-
er is highly problematic.
It indicates the superficial
understanding of the relat-
ionship between women's
oppression, class exploita-
tion and racism that pre-
vails among left forces,
including those within the
women's movement. The
"feminization of poverty"
analysis deserves to be
carefully critiqued rather
than embraced without
question. This discussion
paper is written in order
to initiate that process.

Diana Pearce, a professor
at the University of the
District of Columbia, and
the one who coined the phrase
"feminization of poverty",
writes that her analysis is
concerned with "those women
who are poor because they
are women...for a woman,
race is a relatively unim-
portant consideration in
determining economic status."
The socialist feminist
proponents of the "feminiza-
tion of poverty" have in-
corporated the same essential
vantage point into their
analyses. They submerge the
class and race differences
that exist among women and
then focus on the fate of
one particular sector. In an
article for Ms. magazine en-
titled "The Nouveau Poor",
Barbara Ehrenreich and Karin
Stallard tell the story of
"Avis... one of the ‘nouveau
poor': middle class by birth
and marriage, she is now

raising her three youngest
children on a tenuous combin-

of women, it redefines pov-
erty, its causes as well as
its historic and current vic-
tims, it gives rise to a
political strategy that
speaks to the problems faced
by a certain sector of white
middle class women, but which
is incapable of representing
the interests of those poor
women who suffer not only
from sex discrimination but
also from class and race
oppression.

Virtually all women are
vulnerable—a divorce or wid-
owhood is all it takes to
throw many middle class women
into poverty. (from Poverty
in the American Dream/Women
and Children First, by Karin
Stallard, Barbara Ehrenreich
and Holly Sklar).

This "feminization of po-
verty" line is wrong—empiri-
cally and theoretically—in
its starting assumption that
all women are in relatively
equal and imminent danger of

The "feminization of pov-
erty" view does, in fact,
point to certain economic
realities affecting many wo-
men in the US. There is no
question that Reaganism in-
cludes a ruthless sexist
attack on women's rights,
and living standards. How-
ever, the fatal flaw of the
"feminization of poverty"
analysis is that it treats
all women as members of an
oppressed class. On the one
hand, it minimizes the dif-
ferences in condition and
consciousness among women.
On the other hand, it mini-
mizes the commonality in
condition and consciousness
between women and men of the
same class or racial group.

Liberal advocates of the
"feminization of poverty"
perspective are quite direct
about the fact that any
class or racial differences
that might exist among wo-
men are distinctly secondary
or even irrelevant to their
analysis. Diana Pearce, Dir-
ector of Research for the
Center of National Policy

ation of welfare, child sup-
port, and her native Yankee
ingenuity...with her hand-
some New England features
and hearty outgoing manner...
not the kind of person you
would expect to catch paying
for her groceries with food
stamps, she is in some ways
typical of the new female
poor."

The focus on the “human
interest" dimension of this
story has a vocal objective:
to bridge the gap between
two different sets of women.
First and foremost, white
middle class women, the
actual or potential "new poor”
are supposed to identify with
Avis' "native Yankee ingenu-
ity" and "New England feat-
ures." Second, the “old poor"
women for whom poverty is a
chronic condition, are sup-
posed to empathize with Avis'
plight as a newcomer to the
welfare rolls.

This attempt to bring wo-
men together by minimizing
the class and race differ-
ences between them leads to
distortions on three fronts.
It paints a false picture

becoming poor. Women are far
from a homogeneous group.
Some women are indeed poor
and getting poorer, but many
others are rich and getting
richer.

It is popular among radical
sectors of the feminist move-
ment to cast the ruling
class as a bunch of greedy
white men who oppress every
other social group. But this
description conveniently—

drops out the fact that wo-
men of the ruling elite
enjoy the prerogatives of
the rest of their class and
stand in an exploitative re-
lation to men and women of
the working class. These wo-
men own and control much of
the wealth of the ruling
class and are not about to
slip into poverty, regard-
less of their marital status.
The only thing they have in
common with working class wo-
men is their biology.

While women of the petit
bourgeoisie have a long way
to go to overcome sex dis-
crimination within their
class, most are not “just a
husband away from poverty."
