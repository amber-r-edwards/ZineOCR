**Can A Feminist Get Sober**  
**In Alcoholics Anonymous?**  

**Chocolate Waters**  

Alcoholics Anonymous, the  
oldest organization in America  
for alcoholics, is celebrating its  
fortieth anniversary over the  
fourth of July weekend here in  
Denver. At least 14,000 people  
are expected to attend. The  
following is an interview with  
two local alcoholic women who  
got sober in AA.  

Anna S. is a 38-year-old  
woman who comes from a  
family where ten of the 13  
members are alcoholics. She got  
drunk the first time she drank  
when she was 13, started drink-  
ing heavily at 20, and by the time  
she was 25 she was drinking a  
liter of cognac in her hotel room  
each morning and spending 6-7  
hours a day in the bars. At 27  
Anna dutifully went to a psy-  
chiatrist four times a week and  
continued to go for four years  
before he had her committed to a  
mental institution.  

“I thought I was crazy,” she  
said. “I told the shrink exactly  
how much I drink, which he  
faithfully wrote down in his pad,  
while I sat there with a black eye  
— all scarred down the right side  
of my body from sleeping in the  
gutter the night before. When I  
told him I thought I was alcoholic  
and wanted to try AA, he  
informed me that the organiza-  
tion was like a Baptist meeting  
where you go and give testimony  
and said I was ‘much too  
sophisticated for that.’ It was  
also at this time that I thought  
alcoholism was a character  
weakness, but the alcoholic can  
no sooner stop being alcoholic  
than she can stop having heart  
disease or cancer or any other  
fatal disease.”  

In the institution Anna was  
diagnosed “schizophrenic” and  
given mood-changing pills. “It  
was the first time I ever wanted  
to commit suicide and I tried at  
least four times then.”  

After being thrown out of the  
institution, Anna tried to  
“straighten herself out,” and got  
a job which allowed her $7 a  
week to spend on herself. “I  
wouldn't drink all week, but on  
Friday night I'd take the $7 and  
buy a quart of gin. By Saturday  
morning it was gone and I'd  
spend the rest of the week going  
through withdrawal.”  

Her last three months as a  
drinking alcoholic were spent  
“living with junkies and trying to  
get a drink.” On the advice of a  
brother, Anna went to an AA  
meeting and “from the very first  
meeting I haven't had a drink  
and from the very first week I  
haven't had a mood-changing  
pill.” Anna has been sober for  
over 7½ years.  

Rita C. is a 22-year-old Les-  
bian feminist who started drink-  
ing when she was 18 because  
“it was the thing to do.” The first  
time she drank she got sick for  
two weeks, but she liked drink-  
ing so much that this didn’t deter  
her from drinking again.  

Rita, who claimed she was  
“incredibly naive in those days,”  
had to take care of her alcoholic  
lover and her alcoholic father.  
“They were both bloody  
drunks,” she said. “I knew I had  
to pick my dad up off the floor a  
lot, but I just didn't know that  
was alcoholism and not just the  
way everyone drank. I finally had  
to institutionalize my lover  
because she was destroying  
herself.” Rita goes on to say that,  
“Pretty soon, however, I started  
solving my own problems with  
alcohol, but I just couldn't see  
then that I was an alcoholic.”  

Like many women, Rita had a  
stereotyped picture of an  
alcoholic as someone who  
needs a drink first thing in the  
morning, who's in the streets,  
and who can't hold a job. “None  
of those things applied to me,”  
she said.  

Her life, however, had become  
increasingly unmanageable.  
When she relocated from DC to  
Denver, she thought the  
geographic move would  
“straighten her out,” but she  
was hospitalized shortly  
thereafter as a result of speed  
and alcohol.  

Rita’s first attempt to join AA  
was not a happy beginning. She  
talked with a well-meaning  
woman who wanted to bring  
over the AA literature and a  
“nice young man” too. “When I  
told her I was a Lesbian, she was  
shocked.” Attempts to find a  
Lesbian AA group were at first  
unsuccessful, but with the help  
of a friend Rita found such a  
group in Denver (see listings at  
end of article). She is now  
working the AA program and has  
been sober for 22 days as of this  
writing.  

Anna and Rita, who are both  
radical women, had different  
reactions to women joining and  
belonging to AA. “When I first  
heard the men talk about  
‘broads’ and ‘chicks,’ I was really  
repulsed and didn't think I was  
going to be able to handle it,”  
said Rita. “But if a woman  
doesn’t want to get into AA  
because it isn't a feminist  
organization then I don’t think  
she really wants to get sober.  
Getting sober has to take  
precedence over everything else  
in your life — even if you have to  
listen to prejudiced sexist pigs  
sometimes.”  

“Every dollar bill says ‘In God  
We Trust,’” said Anna, “but no-  
one gives a damn about that  
because you don't have to  
believe in God to buy what you  
want with that dollar. It's the  
same with AA. You never look at  
who's speaking; you listen to  
what the person says because  
you want to stay sober. If he’s  
the worst redneck in the world,  
but he knows one trick about  
being sober then it’s not hard to  
listen. Dealing with men and  
listening to pig statements is a  
small price to pay for your life.”  

One of the bylaws of AA states  
that the organization has no  
opinions on anything. Last  
month an alcoholic woman in  
Los Angeles told her story at an  
open AA meeting. She had come  
from a family of 21 and referred  
to her mother as the “warden.”  
“When I ran away at 14,” she  
said, “I wasn't even missed for a  
week.” Of Mexican-Oriental  
lineage, this woman claimed she  
didn't want to be as poor as her  
family. Consequently she turned  
to pushing drugs to make up for  
the skills she didn’t have for a  
high-paying job, and became an  
addict as well as an alcoholic.  

What chance did she have  
coming from a disadvantaged  
background and living in an  
unhealthy society that is es-  
pecially oppressive to un-  
educated, poverty-level, non-  
white women?  

“Alcoholics Anonymous,” ex-  
plained Anna, “does not have a  
political perspective because we  
don’t deal in causes. What we  
deal with is people who have a  
drinking problem and want to  
stop. Other women in the society  
who come from similar back-  
grounds have chosen non-  
drinking ways to handle their  
lives. There used to be an  
organization in the U.S. that was  
like AA, but they got politically  
involved and forgot that their  
primary purpose was to teach  
people how to get sober.”  

Dealing with men and  
listening to pig statements is a  
small price to pay for your life.  

Anna, who claims that each  
organization in every city is  
representative of that city’s  
community, notes that there are  
a lot of working-class women,  
professional women, and  
women from 14 to 60 and up in  
the Denver branch. “There are  
also a lot of dykes,” she says. “I  
think within a year — especially  
with our dyke group — we're  
going to have some very proud  
Lesbians walking around AA.”  

You once said that AA made  
you a Lesbian, Anna. Could you  
elaborate on that?  

“AA has given me a strong  
identity, an identity that I must  
keep exploring. If I don’t keep  
meeting the responsibilities of  
my own needs I get drunk. My  
needs right now.”  

AA doesn’t promise to  
take away emotional  
pain or to change the  
U.S. government; it  
does promise to teach  
you how to stop drink-  
ing.  

“Alcoholics Anonymous will  
teach you how to stop drinking if  
you want to stop,” added Anna.  
“When you have an emotional  
awakening to yourself after  
working the 12 steps in the  
program, you will have to face  
the responsibility of being a  
human being — of being a  
woman. For the first time in your  
life you have to face the effects  
of all your own actions. AA  
doesn't promise to take away  
emotional pain or to change the  
U.S. government; it just  
promises that you can learn to  
live in the same world sober that  
you lived in drunk before.”

**Are You An Alcoholic?**  

In order to determine whether  
or not a person has drifted from

If you have answered YES to  
any one of the Test Questions,  
there is a definite warning that  
you may be an alcoholic.  

If you have answered YES to  
any two of the Test Questions,  
the chances are that you are an  
alcoholic.  

If you answered YES to three  
or more of the Test Questions,  
you are definitely an alcoholic.  

NOTE: The test questions are  
not A.A. questions but are the  
guide used by Johns Hopkins  
University Hospital in deciding  
whether a patient is alcoholic or  
not.  

No one in A.A. will attempt to  
tell whether another person is  
an alcoholic. This you must  
decide for yourself, and by  
yourself.
