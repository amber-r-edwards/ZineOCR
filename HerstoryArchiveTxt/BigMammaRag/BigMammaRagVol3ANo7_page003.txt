Letters Home To Mama

Saxe Questioned  
Dear Mama,

Loved your July issue... you  
just keep getting better and  
better.

How about some more  
emphasis on health and  
strength for women? If we're  
going to survive the wretched  
fuckup men have made of our  
mother the earth, we're gonna  
have to get ourselves together  
physically. Didn't you have some  
coverage awhile ago of the  
Adventure Trails Survival  
School? I'd dig to see more of  
that kind of thing, women’s self-  
defense etc. How about a feature  
on where and how to get healthy  
foods in Denver?

Where does Susan Saxe think  
she’s coming from, putting down  
Jane Alpert the way she did in  
her statement? I respect her for  
being a strong dyke and Amazon,  
but she should put a little more  
thought into what she says  
when she knows thousands of  
women will be reading it. Looks  
like she just jumped on the band-  
wagon with TiGrace, Florence  
Kennedy and all of them in  
writing Jane off as a collaborator  
without knowing the true facts.  
Thank you for keeping on  
presenting a just perspective.

That's all for now. Keep it  
coming.

Dear Sisters of BMA,  
Thank you for your  
wonderful words of love and  
support. The review in BMR (of  
Meg Christian's “I Know You  
Know”, June issue - ed.) was  
one of the best (i.e. most percep-  
tive) that’s been written and it  
really meant a lot to us. We love  
you for it and for the other fine  
work that you do. (I love it when  
collectives can be in love with  
each other.)  
Hasta Luego and much love.

Can't Find Mama

Dear Big Mama Rag,

I live in south Denver and it’s  
very hard to find a copy of the  
paper here. I have a subscrip-  
tion, but when my friends ask me  
where they can get their own  
copy I have to tell them they have  
to go all the way to Capitol Hill.  
Also I have talked with women  
who never heard of Big Mama  
Rag, even though they have  
been living in Denver for years.

I have been trying to support  
your advertisers, and every time  
I go into a store that advertises  
with you I tell them I’m buying  
from them because they adver-  
tise in Big Mama Rag. Usually it  
makes them very happy and  
once or twice I even got a  
discount on what I was buying.

for doing that. I feel like that’s  
one way I can help the paper,  
even though I work and go to  
school so I can't do anything  
else.

If you can think of any way to  
let women out there know that  
you're around, you should do it  
because you have a very fine  
paper and I wish a whole lot  
more women could have the  
opportunity to read it.

Love,

A Name by Any Other Name

If life is boring, drab and blue,  
Here's the hippest thing to do —  
If everyone all sounds the same,  

Well don’t be sad just change your name.

Choose a flower, choose a tree.  
See how creative you can be.

“An Indian name, a woman martyr,  
Call yourself the Sauce of Tartar.

Be a Deer, a Bear, a Hawk.  
Change your given name to Squawk.

Go ahead, have some fun.  
You can be the Flying Nun.

If Vickie’s got you in a box,  
Then change your name to Goldilocks.  
Or Morning Waters makes you hiss,  
You can always change it to First Piss.

You might be bored with Caroline,  
It's easy switched to Creeping Vine.

Now if you want to keep your name from mama,  
Then stay away from that rag, Big Mama.

Better yet don’t take your daughter,  
She may be greeted by an Otter!

Once inside please know the facts,  
Woodwoman's known to wield an axe.

But really there’s no cause for worry —  
The one called Snake is off with Squirrelly!

Now who am I to make a joke?  
You can change your name to Croak.  
How dare I poke fun at Deers and Otters  
With such a name as Chocolate Waters?  
(This poem may not win your favor,  
But I'll still be my favorite flavor).

Chocolate Waters

Or if you want a name more lively —  
Why not try out Poison Ivy?

If you're a pair here’s just the trick.  
She'll be Chigger, you'll be Tick.

I know a pair who takes the cake —  
One is Snow, the other Flake.

Perhaps you want a name laconic,  
Why not try out Babs Bubonic?

If a mountain range makes you feel free,  
Write your first name as Sandia  
(Ahd call your best friend Karmann Ghia).
