The Women’s Movement, be-
sides working to obtain equal
rights for women, is also trying
to educate people to the cause
in the hopes of eventually
abolishing chauvinistic views to-
ward women. In attempting to
achieve this goal, one important
group has been continually for-
gotten. No strong effort has
been made to reach high school
students. As a high school
student myself, I am naturally
more aware of this often forgot-
ten group. So during the first

week of February, I conducted a

survey at three Denver area high
schools (Aurora Central, George
Washington, and Cherry Creek),
and interviewed 127 high school
students about their views to-
ward women and the feminist
movement.

Only 23% Agree

The majority (83%) of the
students interviewed were aware
of the movement and its basic
goals. But when asked if they
agreed with these goals, only
22% said yes. Fifty-three per-
cent said they agreed with some
(generally equal pay for equal
work), and a whole 25% gave a
flat no. These statistics and
many comments such as, “Basi-
cally their goals are very sound,
yet some of these women tend
to be overzealous in reaching
these goals and so have a habit
of making asses of themselves,”
and “...I get pretty scared
sometimes not knowing what
they are going to do next!”,
demonstrate that many students
have the idea that ‘women’s
libbers’ are loud, aggressive,
wild women. A good number of
them think feminists are trying
to become superior to men.

High School Women

The women were asked if
they planned on becoming a
housewife or having a career.
Fifty percent said they wanted a
career, 32% said they wanted
both, and only 9% said they
wanted to be a housewife. Yet
when asked if they felt the
movement had affected them,
only 31% said yes.

This discrepancy was also true
with the men. When asked if
they would object to their wife
working when they marry, fully
80% answered no. But only 23%
said the movement had affected
their views toward women.

Not Aware

An explanation of this might
possibly be that high school
students ranging in age from
14-18 years old have grown up
with the movement and thus
have not been fully aware of its
effects on them. “The Feminine
Mystique” was published in 1963
and the National Organization
for Women was formed in ‘66;
the public generally became
aware of the movement by
about ‘68 or ‘69. So we were
growing up while all of these
ideas were being discussed and
debated. During our impression-
able years, women have been
vocalizing and we absorbed at
least some of what they were
saying without realizing it. If the
students interviewed had been in
high school in the fifties or even
early sixties, their answers in all
probability would have been
very different. Most of the
women would have wanted to
be a housewife and most of the
men would have objected to
their wife’s working. So there is
little doubt that the movement
has affected them.

Feminism -

High school students need to
be reached. Lately many non-
sexist children’s books have
been written, and women are
fighting school districts to get
textbooks revised. This is all
extremely necessary, but these
books are not going to affect the
current group of high school
students. They'll do wonders for
children ten to fifteen years
younger than we. But it’s
difficult to find feminists who
are trying to reach high school
people. So far the only informa-
tion high school students have
about the movement has been
supplied by the media. Of
course, a few had gone beyond
this and discovered what it’s
really all about, but the majority
have not. Thus they hold a very
distorted view of feminism and
the movement. Is the feminist
movement willing to just sit
back and watch another genera-
tion grow up with the same
chauvinistic attitudes toward
women as the last?

It’s a disturbing face when
25% of the students interviewed
still believe the male sex is
superior. It’s frustrating to hear
a woman say a feminist is
“someone who wants to be a
man but can’t ‘cause they don’t
look like one.” These views do
not have to exist. If women
involved in the struggle could
only spend a little time working
to erase such attitudes, then
possibly a few years from now if
another survey is taken, more
students when asked how they
would depict a feminist would
simply reply as one woman did,
“a woman who wants to be a
person.”

Farah Women Fight and Win

Women compose 80% of the
employees at the Farah Manu-
facturing Co. in El Paso, Texas,
mostly Mexican American wo-
men. On May 3, 1972, 3,000 of
these workers walked off their
jobs in protest of the arbitrary
firing of six organizers for the
Amalgamated Clothing Workers
of America.

As far back as 1970, the
Amalgamated Clothing Workers
of America won an election in
the cutting room of the Farah
Co. In 1972 the union was
recognized as the official bar-
gaining agent by the National
Labor Relations Board. Not
only did the company refuse to
bargain with the union, but they
proceeded to fire the people
who were legally organizing for
the union in other areas of the
company. This action precipitat-
ed the walk-out which has lasted
close to two years.

On Monday, January 28,
1974, another decision was hand-
ed down by Walter Maloney, a
NLRB judge. In this sweeping
decision in favor of the workers,
Maloney accuses the Farah Co.
of wholesale lawlessness and he
“grants virtually all the relief
sought by the workers and the
union.” (Denver Post, Jan. 29,
1974)

The company was ordered to
rehire the six workers and
restore all back pay since the
time of their firing.

Recently the company
agreed to a card check among the
employees. There was support
for the union by 67 percent of
those voting. Consequently, Far-
ah has recognized the Amalga-
mated Clothing Workers of
America as the official bargaining
agent for the workers. The
official announcement was issued
on Sunday, February 24. The
company and the union will
negotiate a contract, and all
striking workers will be back on
their jobs in the near future. To
celebrate the success of the
strike, the Denver local of the
Amalgamated Clothing Workers
of America will be holding a
Farah Strikers Victory Rally on
Tuesday, March 19, at 7:30 p.m.
at the Laborers’ Hall, 875 Elati.
Come and join in the festivities.
