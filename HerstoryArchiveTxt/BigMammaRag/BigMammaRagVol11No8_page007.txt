100 angry demonstrators marched outside the house of Rich-
mond, CA Police Chief Garfield, May 22. The John Brown Anti-
Klan Committee demonstration held Garfield responsible for
the murders of 5 Black people in Richmond in the last year.

They say Garfield sanctions the "Cowboys,"

a KKK-type group

within the Richmond Police Department.

Cops Found Guilty

A federal jury in San Fran-
cisco found Richmond, CA po-
lice officers Clinton Mitchell
and Samvel Dudkiewicz directly
responsible for the shooting
deaths of two Black men. The
court awarded $3 million to
the families of Johnny Roman,
25, and Michael Guillory, 22,
who were shot in their own
homes by the Richmond police.
Several other police brutality
cases against the city are
currently pending in a U.S.
District Court.

Or Maybe Just Live

The Daily Texan, student
newspaper of the University
of Texas at Austin, quoting
State Representative Bill Ce-
verha, sponsor of a bill that
would outlaw homosexual con-
duct: "The diseases homosex-
uals carry pose a public
health risk because homosex-
uals want to handle food,
teach in schools, and perform
other public functions..."

Rapist Beaten

A rapist in Baltimore, MD
was successfully defeated
when the 16-year-old woman he
raped, stabbed him in the
chest and arm. Then a 57-year-
old neighbor, summoned by a
child with whom the rape vic-
tim had been baby-sitting, re-
peatedly struck the rapist on
the head with a baseball bat.

peal on behalf of three Peru-
vian women, aged 16 to 18.

Guillen Quintanilla and Gra-

Pesticide Tests

The Swiss-based chemical
corporation Ciba-Geigy is de-
fending its decision to spray
several Egyptian children
working in a cotton field with
the pesticide Galeron as part
of a "field trial."

Ciba-Geigy, which recently
spent over $5 million upgrad-
ing safeguards at its factory
to keep its Swiss employees
from coming into contact with
the chemical, stated that the
spraying of unsuspecting in-
dividuals is "rare" but still
happens after animal tests
have been done, to "double-
check" that the "product will
be safe under normal condi-
tions."

Locks Hold

On the morning of April 27,
women from Greenham Common
Peace Camp (England) partici-
pated in a coordinated ac-
tion - the locking of 13
gates to the American base
with Kryptonite bike locks.
All vehicles and people were
locked out from the base. The
Americans tried, unsuccess-
fully, to saw through the
locks with a hacksaw, then
with clippers and wire-cutters
(over three feet long). In
desperation, they went at the
locks with chainsaws. The
gates collapsed. (Greenham
Common is one of the intended
sites for 96 Cruise missiles
which will be placed by Dec-
ember 1983.)

Boycott Campbells

Campbell's soup and all the
other products turned out by
Campbell's and its subsidia-
ries are being boycotted by
supporters of the Farm Labor
Organizing Committee (FLOC).
To dramatize their grievances
and to promote the boycott,
hundreds of farmworkers are
walking from Toledo, Ohio to
Campbell headquarters in Cam-
den, NJ. The 560-mile trek
will call attention to a 5-
year strike for such rudiment-
ary demands as minimum wages,
sanitation facilities and
union recognition. A partial
boycott list of Campbell's
and Libby's products includes:
Pepperidge Farm, V-8 Juice,
Mrs. Paul’s, Prego, Vlasic,
Bounty, Franco-American,
Swanson, Hanover Trail.

English Only

The mayor of Elizabeth, NJ,
where one in four residents
is Hispanic, has ordered muni-
cipal employees to speak only
English, even in private con-
versations, unless they have
to use another language to
conduct business with the pub-
lic. He said it's rude to have
a conversation other people
can't understand. Mayor Thomas
Dunn said, "Suppose you had
two Chinese girls jabbering
away in Chinese all day in
front of the other girls.
It's not polite."

Partial Success

The Wake Street Journal, re-
porting on the failure of two
(out of two) operational
flight tests of the cruise
missile: "The Air Force does-
n't call the tests 'failures,'
preferring to call them 'par-
tial successes' because the
missiles worked 'flawlessly'
until they went off course."

Chicken Shit

Chicken shit droppings by
the garbage bag full have been
dumped onto pornographic mag-
azines at three city centre
Victoria (Canada) newsstands.
At least five other businesses
have received warnings from a
group calling itself Angry
Wimmin Rising. Ian Lynch, man-
ager of Market Square newsstand,
said that the group had paint-
ed its name on the store front
and a number of women had come
in asking him to stop selling
pornography. "They said if I
didn't they could not be res-
ponsible for what might hap-
pen. We just sell things like
Playboy, Penthouse, Hustler,
nothing unusual," said Lynch.
