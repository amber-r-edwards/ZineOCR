Why She Opposes Votes for Men — 1. Because a man’s place is in the  
Army. 2. Because no really manly man wants to settle any question  
other than by fighting about it. 3. Because if men should adopt peace-  
able methods, women will no longer look up to them. 4. Because men  
will lose their charm if they step out of their natural sphere and interest  
themselves in other matters than feats of arms, uniforms, and drums. 5.  
Because men are too emotional to vote. Their conduct at baseball  
games and political conventions shows this, while their innate  
tendency to appeal to force renders them particularly unfit for the task  
of government. (Alice Duer Miller, 1915. From A Feminist, Aug. 3,  
1975)  

Not Especially My Idea of “Liberation” — Caroline Svendsen, a  
woman who has been employed as a cocktail waitress and construction  
worker has become the first woman ever granted a license to box in the  
state of Nevada. (Free For All, Aug. '75)  

Every Plague But Two — Edith Russell, a survivor of the Titanic who  
died at the age of 98 in April, also lived through car crashes, fires,  
tornadoes, and floods. Said Ms. Russell, “I’ve had every disaster but  
bubonic plague and a husband.”  

Demure Desperadoes — There were many women in the  
Revolutionary War of 1776 who performed acts of bravery which  
history has almost completely ignored. Two of these women were  
Grace and Rachel Martin, married to brothers serving in the Colonial  
Army. One night the women learned that a secret courier with a body  
guard of two would be passing by their house. They put on their  
husbands’ spare uniforms, stopped the procession, and took the secret  
message which they then passed on to American headquarters. A few  
hours later the same Britishers stopped at the Martin residence and  
demanded to be fed. Little did they realize that the two demure young  
women who served them breakfast were the same desperadoes who  
had ambushed them the night before. (“Women of the Revolution,”  
Arlene Fanale in New Women’s Times, Aug.-Sept. ‘75)  

Now That's An Eyeball, Full — And did you know that the eyeball of an  
ostrich weighs more than its brain? (Well folks, news is short this  
month.)  

P.S.— The name of this column bores me to death. Can anybody come  
up with a better title? Last month I wanted to make a contest out of it and  
tried to offer the winner her choice of the Big Mama Rag collective. The  
collective, however, thought otherwise and neatly edited out my  
suggestion. Well, who can blame them? No telling who reads this paper  
anyhow! How about if this month we offer a free BMA sub to the person  
who comes up with a new title for this column. Ah c'mon, collective —  
whad’ya say to that idea?

A Federal judge in Newark,  
New Jersey, ruled last month  
that the Food and Drug  
Administration overstepped its  
authority in seizing Ova II, a  
pregnancy test kit which the  
FDA claimed was unreliable. The  
judge said the agency's  
authority extends only to the  
regulation of drugs intended to  
cure diseases, and that  
pregnancy is not a disease, but a  
“normal physiological function  
of all mammals.” The FDA is  
considering appealing the case.

The League of Women Voters  
has asked the American  
Broadcasting Company to justify  
its refusal to approve a pitch for  
the Equal Rights Amendment  
during the Democratic telethon.  
The party's national committee  
said ABC had stricken Alan  
Alda’s pro-ERA comments from  
the advance script: Alda was  
finally permitted to voice his  
opinions, but party chairman  
Robert Strauss later told viewers  
that Alda represented only one  
point of view, and that if there  
were enough contributions the  
other side of the issue would be  
presented. The committee  
maintained that Strauss’s  
remarks were made “to avoid  
any possibility of being cut off  
the air” and to comply with the  
Fairness Doctrine.

How charitable can you get? —  
Billy Graham favors “reformed”  
homosexuals being permitted to  
become ministers if they turn  
away from their sins and receive  
Christ. He added that he was  
“not prepared to take a stand  
one way or the other” on  
admitting women. Even if they  
reformed?

Typewriter is “subversive” —  
McAlester, Okla. All  
typewriters at the Oklahoma  
State Penitentiary in McAlester,  
Oklahoma, were seized during  
June because, as the prison  

warden told the Daily  
Oklahoman, “they can be  
instruments to encourage  

subversive influence.”  

“They have been turned into a  
dangerous mechanical device,”  
said Warden Richard Crisp, who  
was appointed warden last  
November after a long military  
career.  

Crisp claims that no prisoner  
mail is censored, in accordance  
with recent Federal court orders,  

however, he explains that he  

decided to confiscate the  
typewriters after intercepting  
letters from prisoners to  
“communistic and other  
subversive groups.” Crisp would  
not identify the groups, but said  
some were as far away as New  
York, Chicago, and Los Angeles,  
and were “Marxist-oriented.”  
“It's unconstitutional,” one  
prisoner protested to the  
Oklahoman. “They're stripping  
us of everything that rightfully  
belongs to us.”

Dog catcher harassment is a  
commonplace occurrence  
among Denver women. After  
several bouts with the dog  
catcher, one local feminist took  
off running with her dog in an  
attempt to foil his evil intentions.  
When he couldn't catch the dog,  
he resorted to grabbing the  
woman, who kneed his crotch in  
an effort to get away. A witness  
said that the dog catcher looked  
as if he would have beaten her  
with his chain if she hadn't acted  
in self-defense. She was  
arrested for interference with  
the duties of a dog catcher and  
was held on a $100.00 bond.  
The judge ordered another  
$150.00 bond for contempt of  
court after she was 10 minutes  
late for her hearing. She is  
considering legal action against  
the dog catcher.
