Where Is Everybody? Sisters: my environment here won't affect my thinking. Perhaps there is a challenge. I really wasn’t aware that women were still having to deal with these kinds of situations anymore. Unreal. Suggestions, anyone? Support???

Dear Big Mama: We want to thank Clare for the marvelous reporting job she did at our crowded, quick meeting at ICI in Oakland. A lot of figures were mentioned by us as well as the other women’s presses there that afternoon. We did not mean to give the impression that we had sold 10,000 copies of our first eight titles. At that time, we had sold 81 thousand copies — which of course seems like 10,000 apiece. But Rubyfruit’s 45,000 was included in the total. We would accept the exaggeration but the truth is certainly good enough (the male press novels average 800 per title). And besides we wouldn't want our authors coming after us for unpaid royalties.

With love; Parke Bowman

The women here are doing almost nothing to help themselves, and seem content in traditional occupations. The Virginia Neal Blue Center is here, but almost none of the women are aware of it. Anti-abortion, feminist, and ERA forces abound and not the Center nor the NOW is able to check them. The John Birch Society certainly does more with over 200 courses listed than the politically-active, beautiful women who can change the situation for women in this town. Where are they hiding?

Let's see how really open-minded you are. Now what do you think of the ad?

In sisterhood,
