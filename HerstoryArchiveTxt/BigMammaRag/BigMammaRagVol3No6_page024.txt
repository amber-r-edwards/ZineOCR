Against Rape — it's about a  
war that’s going on and if you  
understand that point this small  
but power-packed book may very  
well change your life. The war to  
which we refer is no prissy “battle  
of the sexes;” it is a full scale  
attack and the name of the battle  
is rape.  

The authors of Against Rape  
make it perfectly clear at the out-  
set that rape is not simply a sex-  
ual crime committed by a slavering  
lunatic on a woman walking  
home at night, but that rape is  
“all the hatred, contempt, and  
oppression of women in this  
society concentrated in a single  
act.” Elucidating this point,  
Medea and Thompson show that  
the rapist is often just the man  
next door, the man who has  
learned that not only a woman's  
time but her body as well are  
property rights which belong to  
him.  

One of the best features of the  
book is that it rationally and  
logically explains how the act of  
rape is the culmination of  
woman's non-beingness in the  
world. Contempt for and the  
devaluation of women as people  
make rape a crime which is not  
even considered a crime; it is  
considered a matter of course.  
Rarely does the rapist feel guilty  
for taking what he has been  
taught to believe is rightfully his.  

He is simply proving his  
manhood and his “normalcy” as  
well. Consequently, it is the  
woman who is made to feel guilty  
and the rapist is hardly ever  
punished by law. In fact, rape is  
about the last criminal offense a  
man will ever be convicted of.  

The co-authors go on to  
demonstrate that women are  
trained “from our pink booties  
on” to be rape victims. Passive  
acquiescence and an inability to  
demand the right to our own  
time make our bodies easy  
targets for the rapist. These are  
not individual characteristics or  
failings of certain particular  
women; they are the facts of life  
about living in a society which  
rewards aggressive male  
behavior and denies every  
woman's attempts to be a com-  
plete person.  

The book is not only an ex-  
cellent and understandable  
analysis of rape, it is also a sur-  
vival manual for all of us.  
Chapters on self-defense and on  
demanding the right to our own  
lives teach and encourage us  
about what we should do to cope  
with the realities of rape.  

One chapter in particular is  
devoted to methods of self-  
defense and is illustrated with  
common sense ways to protect  
ourselves. Fundamental  
procedures such as punches,  
kicks, how to stand, balance, and  
breaking and deflecting blows  
are all included in this chapter  
along with explanations of ac-  
tual encounters.  

Also incorporated in Against  
Rape are suggestions about  
what to do if you should be  
raped, what to expect at the  
hospital, and whether the rape  
should be reported to the police.  

Against Rape: Every woman  
should not only read it, she  
should understand its implications  
and most of all — learn to fight  
back.

Rosalie Sorrels is a folksinger,  
songwriter from California  
whose songs reveal a depth of  
feeling and a commitment to  
life's struggles at once both sure  
and hesitant. The book is a  

collection of several of her songs  
(lyrics and music), as well as a  
broad spectrum of other  
women’s songs and poems from  
traditional to modern.  

“It took at least thirty-three  
years of my life for me to begin to  
try to find out who I am or what  
I am about. The awakening oc-  
curred through desperation —  
out of being alone, I have learned  
to like being alone with me. I like  
the condition of being a woman —  
the boundaries fade — the  
possibilities are infinite.

emotion, reflecting time and  
place in their melodies. And  
although each piece in this  
collection is personal and uni-  
que, together they reveal a story  
we all can share.”  

How appropriate at a time  
when women are moving from  
the initial point of anger to a  
place of joy and celebration of  
womanhood that we be given a  
book of our songs — a reminder  
that women singing are as  
necessary as women fighting.  

The book is superbly il-  
lustrated by Liz Schoeberlein, a  
local artist and teacher at  
Colorado Women’s College. The  
illustrations are both whimsical  
and thought provoking —  
thoroughly successful in adding  
visual dimension and  
cohesiveness.

Denver Folklore Center,

TR OC THE CRT  

Rocky Mountain Women in the Arts  

Kate Sharp  

Rocky Mountain Women In  
The Arts (RMWA) has had a long  
and rather turbulent history. It  
began as a loosely defined “ex-  
periment” listed in the Denver  
Free University catalog of fall  
1973.  

The original group was small  
but dedicated and as time went  
on the group fortunately became  
less and less loosely defined.  
After floundering around for  
several months discussing what  
our needs and hopes were as a  
group, and getting to know each  
other as friends, we decided on  
two ongoing projects. One was  
to continually view each others’  
work. The other was to do  
periodical RMWA art showings.  
We plunged into both.  

These were ecstatic days for  
the group. Each time we met we  
were exposed to the work (visual  
and otherwise) of a few group  
members and this experience  
was elating. A little spin-off  
group of writers was meeting a  
few times a week in addition to  
regular meetings. And then  
there was our first showing to be  
held at Soup’s On, which was  
getting closer and closer.  

About this time we started an  
“advertising campaign” which  
consisted of a little blurb about  
ourselves aired over the radio  
and appearing in newspapers  
and posters about town. The  
response was overwhelming.  

Meetings were being attended  
by about 50 women and were  
sheer bedlam. New women  
would appear each week and  
each week we'd have to re-hash  
the history and already defined  
aspirations of the group.  

Soup‘s On  

Then we had our showing, it  
was a well attended but chaotic  
affair. Yet many women who ex-  
hibited their work did not put  
much work into the mechanics of the  
show and disappeared from  
RMWA’s midst afterwards. Had  
they wanted us to be solely the  
impetus for putting together  
showings? The chaos brought  
about by the size of our meetings  
caused many women to drop out  
in discouragement. Things were  
stagnating. Meeting attendance  
was dwindling. Morale was low.  
Talk of a Women’s Arts Center  
was brewing but there was not  

sufficient energy, sufficient  
numbers of women, nor suf-  
ficient money.  

Eventually, a tiny group of  
dauntless determined women  
decided again to define itself and  
to make plans. We decided to  
facilitate some “happenings” for  
the Denver women artists com-  
munity, such as films, readings  
and demonstrations. We felt that  
they would help the women’s ar-  
tists community and would  
eliminate the long, boring  
meetings that RMWA had evolv-  
ed itself into.  

So far we've had a local pai-  
nter speak and show her work, a  
jeweler spoke to the group and a  
showing of the Gertrude Stein  
biographical film ‘When This  
You See Remember Me’. We've  
also had a dance workshop, a  
potter and a showing of theatre  
memorabilia by an actress in the  
Third Eye Theatre.  

Energy Wanes  

All of our happenings were  
quite well attended and  
response was always  
enthusiastic. However, the  
diligently working core of  
RMWA became smaller and  
smaller. People seemed to want  
to take advantage of the events  
but didn’t want to contribute  
energy or ideas — both of which  
were sorely needed.  

We needed help to put the  
newsletter together, with  
scheduling events, arranging  
meetings, and especially with  
ideas for future events and  
goals. Interest waned and the  
few of us that were left didn’t  
have the energy to do it all.  

But the dead can be  
resurrected, if women in the  
area feel the need for a group for  
women artists. (And the word ar-  
tist, hopefully, does not imply a  
limitation to those working sole-  
ly in the visual arts.)

that you would like to use toward  
re-organizing Rocky Mountain  
Women In The Arts please drop a

a phone message with the Big  
Mama office, 322-2010. I'll be

There's no need for a good idea  
to be dormant.
