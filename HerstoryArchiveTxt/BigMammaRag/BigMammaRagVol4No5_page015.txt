concerned sectors of the estab-
lishment.

She said she thought this
had already happened with
rape, which is being taken
over by the law enforcement
establishment and de-femin-
ized; thus we have lost the
control we were trying to gain
and the rape victim is being
dealt with by traditionally
trained therapists rather than
by feminists.

Feminist Therapy

Although her approach was
different from Brown’s, Bart
too spoke on what seemed to
be becoming the undeclared
theme of the conference, that
power is health. She analyzed
the corrupting effects of men-
tal and physical powerlessness
and devoted much of her
speech to the problem of
depression in women, which
she described as a direct
manifestation of female alien-
ation in a society which
defines itself and women from
a male perspective.

According to Bart, depres-
sion and alienation in women

I need to arrange something by then.

has been reinforced by the
traditional therapist who
treats being not-male as if it
were a disease. She sees the
feminist therapist as one who
enables another woman to
locate the disease in the social
structure and change it, thus
gaining autonomy for herself
and helping other women
escape powerlessness.

Bart used as an example of
liberation through action the
abortion collective in Chicago
called “Jane” or “The Serv-
ice” which safely performed
11,000 illegal abortions in the
years preceding the Supreme
Court ruling. The women in
the collective learned how to
use technology to help others
and to manipulate the world to
their advantage, bringing to-
gether two of the themes of
feminism — nurturance and
competence.

Later on Friday, Barbara
Ehrenreich reviewed the his-
tory of women’s subversive-
ness, especially as lay healers
and midwives. She said that it
was the fear of women’s tradi-
tional power over life and
death that had led to the
present conspiracy of the
white male medical establish-

ment to eliminate the compe-
tition of female healers by
defining femaleness itself as
“sick.”

Struggle Ahead

Ehrenreich predicted that
the next 5-10 years will see
increased resistance to wom-
en’s struggle for self-
determination in the repres-
sion of activist women healers,
the cutting back of abortion
rights, and forced steriliza-
tion. She thinks it is essential
that women be united enough
to mobilize national forces
quickly when such events
occur.

She urged women to avoid
divisions that can prevent
effective national struggle.
She pointed out some of the
weaknesses currently in the
women’s movement and in-
sisted that women must be
constantly aware that the sub-
versive position is theirs alone;
no one else is going to do
anything about women’s
health problems.

At the final program of the
conference Phyllis Chesler
spoke on “Money, Power, and
the Changing System.” Ches-
ler agreed with the other
speakers that the time has

come when women must unite
and learn to use all the tools
available to them in the battle
against an insanely male
world. She was pessimistic,
however, because the tools
themselves are the products of
a destructive male view of
reality.

The theme of the conference
was “Women Sharing Health-
ful Caring”; a more accurate
description of its message
would be a combination of two
more familiar sayings: “If you
can’t lick 'em join ’em and
beat them at their own game.”
