Becoming Independently Healthy Women

Reading on the subject of exercise can also be quite valuable. But most important—enjoy what you're doing and do it regularly. 

Distressing Stress

Certainly we are all familiar with stress. Stress is, after all, nothing more than any disruptive or disquieting influence on our lives. Stress situations disturb our normal emotional and physiological balance, and if allowed to continue unchecked for any sizeable amount of time, can produce a number of serious consequences. Some disorders that can be the result of unmanaged stress are migraine headaches, back problems, digestive disorders, insomnia, asthma, non-specific aches and pains, ulcers, depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, stroke, and heart attacks. A well-nourished body that is physically fit cannot necessarily fight off the constant wear and tear brought on by unmanaged stress. The trick to de-stressing is to avoid stressful situations whenever possible, and when not possible (for example, moving and changing jobs are stress situations even when they are changes for the better) to minimize the effect of stress upon our inner balance.

Stress-producing situations are many. However, if we are attempting an attitude of kindness towards ourselves, we can often foresee that a given situation (existing or contemplated) may not be in our own self-interest. We must develop the ability to say no to changes that will reduce stress, to communicate honestly with ourselves at all times, to be self-assertive and honest with others, and to develop the ability to assess situations realistically. All of this is difficult, takes practice, and sometimes fails us, despite our best intentions. Unlike the principles of nutrition and exercise, which are basically of a physiological nature, the principles of stress-management are often highly philosophical in nature, and thus their application will vary greatly from individual to individual. What all this boils down to is that perhaps the most useful thing we each can do to manage stress is to develop an attitude about ourselves that is consistent with the way we really are.

Like a dictator whose every command is heeded by the governed, the sweet tooth is sovereign over the American palate. Scarcely a single ice cream parlor or an aromatic bakery can be encountered these days without the sweet tooth making sly, but powerful, commands to drop in and sample two scoops piled high on a cone, or some warm jelly donuts, or a thick, flaky napoleon. In the land known as the breadbasket, refined sugar is king.

American food manufacturers have taken full advantage of this national craving. Why should white sugar be in desserts alone? is the industry thinking. Why shouldn't it be in, say, hot dogs, or bleu cheese dressing, or even salt for that matter?

While naturally occurring sugars make up only 6% of the calories in our diet, the percentage of calories from added sugar is three times that amount. Annually, we consume close to 95 pounds of table sugar. Adding up all the sugars the average American eats, we consume about 135 pounds of sugar per year. The table below lists those unsuspected and not so unexpected places where food consumers are getting sugared to death. (Chart and information from "Nutrition Action.")

Once we have begun to assess and in some cases, avoid situations for their stress potential, we will want to begin to cope with life's inevitable stresses. The best way to do this is by setting aside some time every day for de-stressing, for clearing the mind. A myriad of de-stressing techniques may exist. Certainly bio-feedback, transcendental meditation, and yoga relaxation techniques receive the majority of publicity these days, but such potentially expensive and instruction-needing techniques are not the only ones that can help, nor are they necessarily the best ones. De-stressing techniques can be varied and individualized as anything else in this realm. 

Certainly, I'm not saying if someone is bleeding heavily and in shock they should be left to their own resources (although recovery can be quickened by certain megavitamin treatments), I am saying though, that for most ailments, there exists a treatment that may be less dangerous and/or physiologically unbalancing and definitely less expensive than one the friendly doctor would recommend. In short, take daily care of your body, and should it fail you on occasion, be sensible about treating ailments as well. Wellness demands a great deal of personal responsibility but it is, after all, one of our most precious rights. Become independently healthy!
