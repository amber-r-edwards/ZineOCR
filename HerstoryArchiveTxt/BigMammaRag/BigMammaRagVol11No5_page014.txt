On January 17, 1983, the
trial of Helga Roos, an acti-
vist in the West German anti-
imperialist movement, began at
the Stammheim prison in Stutt-
gart. Helga has been in prison
since October 1982. Her pri-
son conditions have been like
those of the other political
prisoners in West Germany:
solitary confinement with no
visitors (except her sister),
restricted and censored mail
and literature. While in pri-
son, she has been tortured
several times, a practice com-
mon with political prisoners
and which has resulted in the
death of several of them. The
state also initiated a plan
last year to ship Helga off to
a mental hospital without
even a trial (see January Big
Mama Rag), but this plan was
cancelled after massive pro-
test arose in West Germany and
internationally. In spite of
the state's systematic attempt
to break Helga's spirit, she,
like all political prisoners
from the RAF (Red Army Fact-
ion), anti-imperialist, anti-
nuclear, squatters, and other
movements, continues her
struggle in prison.

It is no accident that this
trial, along with other des-
perate attempts by the state
to repress the growing resis-
tance in West Germany, happens
in the year that Reagan plans
to station large numbers of
cruise missiles and Pershing
IIs all over West Germany.

Since 1980, the movement
against NATO, Startbahn West*,
the squatters, anti-imperial-
ists, and anti-nuclear move-
ments have been growing in
numbers and militancy and have
been moving in a common dir-
ection—identifying U.S. and
West German imperialism as
their common enemy. The West
German government, threatened
by this growing militancy and
unity in the movement, is
trying the old tactics of
divide and conquer as well as
isolation of arbitrary activ-

ists like Helga Roos as tar-
gets for long, tedious trial
proceedings and prison sen-
tences. In Helga's case, the

state has absolutely no evid-
ence. She is charged with
buying the tent which was used
by the RAF during their assas-
sination attempt on General
Kroesen, the commanding offi-
cer of U.S. troops in Europe;
it has already been proven
that the tent used in the act-
ion was bought not by Helga
Roos, but by two men.

Clearly, the West German
state, in collaboration with
the U.S., is using Helga Roos
as "an example" to try to
squash the growing resistance
to imperialist war in Europe
and in the Third World. But
their plan has backfired—the
state's escalation in attacks
on the movement has been
matched by the people's grow-
ing spirit and determination.
Supporters have been showing
up by the hundreds at the
trial, waiting in two-hour
lines and being subjected to
partial or total strip search-
es to get into the courtroom
to express solidarity with
Helga and their common strug-
gle. The intimidating atmo-
sphere and gruesome conditions
of the courtroom have not in

the least dampened the spirit
and determination of the sup-
porters. As one woman stated
after the first day of the
trial, "It was somehow incred-
ible; you drive down to the
trial at Stammheim, where the
pigs feel so powerful, demon-
strating their force, and in
spite of that there was such
an incredible strength from us,
Helga, and all the political
prisoners."

The Helga Roos trial is be-
coming an important rallying
point in the West German re-
sistance, bringing together
a broad and growing base of
support. The state has called
upon its mightiest forces of
repression, but the movement
grows stronger and more unif-
ied every day.

*Startbahn West is a proposed
runway at the Frankfurt Air-
port which will be used to
launch U.S. military operat-
ions in the Middle East and to
supply the U.S. troops in
Europe. Since the discovery of
the U.S./NATO plans, there has
been massive organizing and
resistance against it.

“Fit To Be Untied”: Rights Of “Mental Patients”

FIT TO BE UNTIED, a film by
Silvano Agosti, Marco Bellocc-
hio, Sandro Petraglia, and
Stefano Rulli.

Jenny Miller

No one or everyone/ All or no-
thing at all/ You can't save
yourself by yourself/ No one
or everyone.

The film opens with these
stirring words from Brecht and
never falters in its adherence

film review

to them throughout the follow-
ing two hours. With incredible
directness, the filmmakers in-
terview people who have been
victimized by the psychiatric
system, and their subjects re-
spond with equal openness. The
location of the film is Parma,
Italy, which has a long history
of social struggle and resis-
tance to fascism. Under the
present socialist government,
the Mental Health Department
is being run by Mario Tommas-
ini, a former gas worker. Work
ing with others in the Italian

Democratic Psychiatry movement,
Tommasini succeeded in clos-
ing many of the worst institu-
tions in his province. (In 1978
a law was passed which mandat-
ed the closing of all the large
psychiatric institutions in
Italy.)

The first part of the film
dwells on three young former
inmates who have spent much of
their childhood immured in psy-
chiatric prisons. Nonetheless,
little 12-year-old Paolo rad-
iates a rebellious wit and
charm. When asked if there are
any social workers he likes,
he says, "No—only Tommasini"
(who's a councilman, not a soc-
ial worker). Why not the oth-
ers? "They're all disagreeable."
What would make Paolo happy?
"To be left alone.” Later in
the film he describes with glee
how he locked his psychologist
in her office and threw the
key out the window. Paolo
ably defends himself against
the patronizing remarks of his
"normal" schoolmates, who are
also interviewed in the film.

By talking with the families

of the former inmates, all of
whom live in conditions of de-

sperate poverty, the filmmakers

show very clearly the connec-
tions between class oppres-
sion and psychiatric oppres-
sion. Also shown is the col-
laboration of the Catholic
Church in this modern-day
Inquisition. Clelia, now a
beautiful and articulate wo-
man, describes how when she
was an orphaned 6-year-old,
the nuns called her an animal
because she wouldn't make the
sign of the cross. She bitter-
ly says of them, "When you
live with the wolves you
learn to howl." She demon-
strates for us the punishment
used by the nuns on patients,
like herself, who rebelled
against being tied up: the
patients' heads were wrapped
tightly in urine-soaked
sheets until all air was cut
off. She describes seeing
many of her friends on the
ward dying around her. (Oddly
enough, among the many prizes
won by Fit to be Untied in
Europe, it was awarded Best
Film of the Year by the Cath-
olic Film Office.)
