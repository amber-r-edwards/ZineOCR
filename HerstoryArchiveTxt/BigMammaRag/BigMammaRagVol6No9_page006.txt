Welfare Women

Confront DPW

by Robin Winter

What happens when a group of
twenty women of diverse back-
grounds, with nothing in common
but poverty and desperation, sud-
denly find themselves living to-
gether?

Plenty. Especially if they are
the “guests” of the Department of
Public Welfare.

During the hot month of July,
the steaming situation at the
Temporary Home for Women and
Children finally boiled over. The
residents of the Home, fed up with
their shabby environment and with
the seeming lack of concern by the
Welfare Department, forced a con-
frontation with DPW representa-
tives to demand improvements.
The officials were taken aback by
the clearly expressed anger of the
women.

They didn’t realize the pot had
been simmering for a long time.

Boston’s Temporary Home for

Women and Children is an old red
brick building on New Chardon
Street near Government Center. Its
title is carved in grey stone over the
entrance. And at the entrance
stands an armed guard.
The guard is there to protect
Home residents from the various
dangers of the inner city. But his
presence helps set the tone of the
place: This is a State Institution,
and the Institution, not the resi-
dent, has control.

It was lack of control that
brought most of the women to the
Temporary Home in the first place.
Women who had been evicted; very
young women with babies and no
place to go; women who grabbed
their kids and maybe a shopping
bag of clothing in flight from
abusive husbands; poor women
from the country, and even from
other countries, looking for a new
start in Boston: These are the
residents of the Temporary Home.

The Home provides food and
shelter to any woman who isn’t an
alcoholic or drug addict, doesn’t
have a severe physical handicap,
has no male children over the age
of twelve, and has no emotional or
behavioral problems that would
disturb the other residents.

who attend to the round-the-clock
functioning of the household.
During business hours, there are
two social workers who are supposed
to coordinate Welfare services
to the residents so that they can be
placed in public housing, given
financial support, helped to find a
job; in short, regain control of their
lives.

But the journey from helpless-
ness to control is long and difficult.
And while the intentions of the
Temporary Home are good, it’s still
a rough place to start the trek.

There are two general areas of
tension at the Temporary Home.
One involves the interrelation-
ships of the residents. The other is
the obvious lack of state money to
support the program.

Women arrive at the Temporary
Home at the height of their
personal crisis. This affects their
behavior towards each other. Some
may be very distrustful, some too
aggressive, others withdrawn. Cul-
tural differences within the group
also make the adjustment period
difficult. Residents find themselves
divided over issues like household
cleanliness and child care. For
women coming from their own
homes where they had control in
those areas, it’s very hard to
tolerate other people’s living stan-
dards. Additional tension arises out
of the lack of privacy and quiet.
And there are inevitably incidents
of theft.

The interrelationship tension
may be subtle or obvious, but the
state’s laxity toward the Home is
blatant. Any institutional building
is subject to regular wear and tear.
It should also be subject to regular
maintenance. But when a resident
spots damage, the best she can do
is report it to the matron, who
reports it to City Maintenance.
Then they wait. They may wait
weeks.

The furnishings too are neglect-
ed. A broken high chair stays
broken. Lost mops and diaper pails
are rarely replaced. Residents are
supplied with only the bare-bones
basics. The little niceties that make
life bearable, like tablecloths for
the dining room, are often bought
by matrons out of their own money.

But the low budget allotted the
Home is most obvious in its severe
understaffing. This summer the

resident population was higher
than usual, and the normal short-
age of matrons and social workers
became a crisis. Matrons carry the
brunt of the load at the Home. They
are on duty twenty-four hours a
day, and they wear many hats:
housekeeper, referee, personal
counselor, emergency intake
worker, policewoman, and cook.
The residents are generally very
supportive of the matrons and the
hard job they do.

During the day, the social
workers have a hard job too, but
they receive more anger than
support from residents. Residents
must work through one of the two
Home social workers when trying
to get welfare benefits. If a social
worker gets around to an individual
that day, fine. If not, the woman
simply has to wait. That there are
only two professionals for the
entire Home population outrages
even the most cynical resident.

When a group is oppressed, its
members often turn their anger
and frustration on each other,
rather than dealing with the source
of their problems. This would be
easy to do at the Temporary Home.
But a group of ten residents were
perceptive enough and brave
enough — and angry enough — to
take stock of the situation and take
action. They submitted a list of
specific complaints and demands
for improving life at the Home.
They weren’t only fighting for
physical improvements. They were
fighting for their psychological
welfare, too.

At the meeting that resulted,
the women learned that a special
Task Force exists to deal with the
problems of the Home, and that
there are people within the Welfare
administration sincerely concerned
with conditions there. Task Force
efforts contributed in part to the
allocation of more money for the
hiring of additional staff and for
some physical improvements.

What the Task Force represen-
tatives didn’t point out is that the
new money is part of a larger
Welfare budget approved by the
state legislature as a result of
recent child abuse publicity. Future
improvements at the Home will
probably be due more to the
legislature’s concern for children
than for women.

In spite of the problems that
plague the residents of the Home,
there’s a great deal of strength
apparent in this group of women.
Staffers readily agree that with
good professional supervision, the
women could change their situation
from chaos and confusion to one of
mutual support. Even as it stands
now, and considering the tensions,
it is to the credit of residents and
staff alike that life goes on as well
as it does at 41 New Chardon Street.

House Passes ERA Extension

by Ayleen Allen and
Rosemary Trowbridge

Everyone said it couldn’t be done.
When the ERA Extension passed
the House sub-committee by a 4-3
vote, the skeptics said, “Well, you
don’t really think it’s going to pass
the full judiciary committee, do
you?” When it passed the full
judiciary committee, killing rescis-
sion by 8 votes and passing
extension by 19-15, again the
response was, “Well you don’t
really think that it will pass the full
House, do you?”

Well, on August 15th, the ERA
Extension passed the House by a
whopping 44 votes, and rescission
was defeated by 32 votes.

The day of the vote in the full
House was a real cliffhanger.
Proponents hoped to defeat the
rescission amendment by one or
two votes. The Speaker of the
House, Thomas P. O’Neill, Jr. was
prepared to exercise the prerogative
of his office to break a tie.

Pro-ERA Representatives
appeared on the floor, some com-
ing directly from the hospital,
one from his wife’s deathbed.
Each pro vote was critical. The
women Representatives “worked
the doors” of the House Chamber
and the Speaker “worked the
cloakroom,” lobbying the uncom-
