Passing On A Tradition Of Oppression

Dee dee NiHera

In a movement so concerned
with language, with re-defi-
ning and re-visioning, the
vague and value-ridden terms
sane, insane and sick appear
regularly in feminist texts.
While activists in the
psychiatric inmates libera-
tion movement speak out and
publish pieces protesting
labels of psychopathology,
feminists casually toss out

culture

the metaphors schizo, psycho,
nuts, bats; crazy, etc.,
whenever something or some-
one distasteful crosses their
path. Lesbian feminists, while
protesting inclusion in these
categories, find no contradiction
placing others in them. Rather
than deeply questioning social
institutions allowing for the
reduction of human beings into
such devastating concepts, these
feminist language economists
actually perpetuate psychiatric
violence and encourage our
imprisonment.

The work On Lies Secrets,
and Silences contains a sec-
tion clearly illustrating
some problems with feminist
thought on the madness issue.
Writes Adrienne Rich:

Women have been driven
mad, "gaslighted," for cent-
uries by the refutation of
our experience and our in-
sights in a culture which
validates only male experi-
ence. The truth of our bod-
ies and our minds has been
mystified to us. We there-
fore have a primary obliga-
tion to each other: not to
undermine each others’ sense
of reality for the sake of
expediency; not to gaslight
each other.

Women have often felt in-
sane when cleaving to the
truth of our experience.
Our future depends on the
sanity of each of us, and
we have a profound stake,
beyond the personal, in the
project of describing our
reality as candidly and
fully as we can to each
other.

If “women have been driven

mad...by the refutation of
our experience and our in-
sights in a culture which
validated only male experi-
ence," why do my brothers
suffer in psychiatric pris-
ons around the world for
some vague concept called
illness? If their behavior
and experience find valida-
tion, it certainly comes
from outside the feminist
community and the dominant
social system. Men of color
and "poor white trash" also
live marginally in this cul-
ture. I do not deny the
harmful effects of a sexist,
misogynist philosophy on
women's lives, but believe
feminists will never under-
stand the inmate experience
without broadening the pict-
ure.

Adrienne Rich and other
feminists, by their failure
to define or redefine labels
of psychopathology, invali-
date and mystify the body/
mind experiences of incarc-
erated people. Rich writes
of women's obligation "not
to undermine each others'
sense of reality," yet holds
definite ideas that sanity
equals good ("our future de-
pends on the sanity of each
of us"), while equating mad-
ness with negativity (we are
driven mad due to invali-
dated experiences). She
states a need for candid and
full descriptions of reality
yet uses value-loaded terms
discouraging this practice -
particularly for former
psychiatric inmates who know
about punishment for hones-
ty. I see little evidence
that feminists believe any
differently from the reality
police on who deserves ban-
ishment from the community.

Rich confuses me further
with the statement, "Women
have often felt insane
cleaving to the truth of our
experience." What does this
sentence mean? Is Rich in-
sinuating that women are not
really insane but only feel
that way? Is she denying
women's feelings as real?
Are only some women really
insane while others often
just feel that way? Does
Rich undermine any women's
"sense of reality for the
sake of expediency" by not
clearly defining or re-look-
ing at old terms? If a wom-

an newly discharged from a
state institution read this
statement, how safe would
she feel in a feminist
setting? How safe would she
really be?

After initiating a $1,750,000,000,000 Pentagon budget
and making speeches where he said such things as "limited
nuclear war" may be necessary, Raygun said, "I'm with
you" to the anti-nuclear movement in a radio broadcast.

In another double-tongued dilemma, Raygun quickly announ-
ced that the Feds would not bail out bankrupted school
systems and social welfare programs in hard hit cities
like Detroit and at the same time offered tax cuts for
those who can afford to put their children in private
schools. Supply side savings closer to home.

The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), demon-
strating Raygun's right arm tactics, has been busily
rounding up undocumented Black and Latin workers in
Gestapo-like raids at job sites in 9 U.S. cities. Their
effort at mass intimidation of undocumented workers has
not left INS officials without time to incarcerate
Haitian refugees--many of whom have
served as guinea pigs for drug
research. While many Haitian
refugees are on a hunger
strike for freedom, others
may suffer permanent
health problems or
death as a result of in-
humane living conditions
and pharmaceutical experi-
mentation.

Meanwhile, back in middle
amerikkka, unemployment rises to
a 40 year high, unemployment pro-
grams run out of funds, private food
assistance programs run out of food and the Feds stock-
pile $2 billion worth of food--paying millions of dollars
a day just to warehouse the "surplus" food. Meanwhile,
the food supplement program is dropped, and school lunch-
es chopped. But British troops in Argentina are assured
of food and ammunition from the U.S. should the "conflict"
there become a war.
