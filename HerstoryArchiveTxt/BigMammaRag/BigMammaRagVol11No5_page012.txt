All In The Name Of Healing-- Injury,

Jenny Miller

Excerpts from Science for the
People

Every year millions of peo-
ple in the US are incarcerated
in psychiatric institutions
and given brain-damaging
psychiatric "treatments,"
usually without their consent.
About one percent of the

population will be inmates on
psychiatry

a psychiatric ward in any
given year, and about ten
percent will be psychiatric
inmates ("mental patients")
at some time in their lives.
This does not include the
additional millions of in-
mates of nursing homes, chil-
dren's detention centers,
prisons, as well as out-
patients who are forcibly
treated with psychiatric
drugs. Primarily affected are
poor people, women, the el-
derly, Third World people,
the differently-abled, les-
bians and gay men, and other
groups who lack power in this
society. Most psychiatrists
are white men with high in-
comes who are trained to
perceive people's feelings
of rage, rebellion, despair,
and apathy as symptoms of
psychiatric pathology, rather
than seeing them as natural
and valid responses to an
extremely oppressive politi-
cal-economic system.

Psychiatric inmates have
historically been denigrated,
experimented on, injured,
and even exterminated
in the name of healing. In
this context it is important
to examine the legal rights
of psychiatric inmates today,
and the most prevalent tech-
niques used to control them:
psychosurgery, electroshock,
and neuroleptic drugs.

Legal rights of “mental
patients" are almost non-
existent. Even in California,
which is considered to have
some of the most progressive
laws in the country, people
may be locked up for an ini-
tial 72-hour period, before
and during which time they do
not have the right to a hear-
ing. The police and certain
designated mental health
professionals have the power
to commit individuals for
this period if they think

that such persons might be a
danger to themselves or
others or are unable to pro-
vide for their own needs. In
practice, possible reasons
for detention are: not having
a place to live; fighting
with or threatening a family
member; talking about or at-
tempting suicide; dressing,
eating, or living in a way
that a visiting social worker
finds unacceptable. Children
and teenagers are often com-
mitted for running away from
home or experimenting with
street drugs. Women trapped
in the role of "housewife"
have been committed for losing
interest in housework.

and shelter, they may be in-
voluntarily incarcerated for
an additional 14 days. After
that the detained persons

may be placed on an addition-
al hold, or subject to con-
servatorship proceedings, un-
der which they may be repeat-
edly committed for one year
at a time. Almost all of the
"rights" officially listed
for psychiatric inmates—such
as the right to wear their
own clothes, the right to
make and receive phone calls,
the right to receive visitors
—can be denied for "good
cause" by the doctor in
charge or the doctor's de-
signee. During their deten-

During the initial 72-hour
hold, persons so detained are
almost always forcibly
drugged with powerful "tran-
quilizers" which make it
difficult to talk, concen-
trate, or read. If the hospi-
tal still wishes to hold them
after three days, they have
a right to a court hearing,
but only on request. These
hearings usually take place
on the grounds of a psychi-
atric institution. The de-
tained persons are frequently
too drugged to read or under-
stand their legal rights and
often are inadequately repre-
sented by an overworked pub-
lic defender. If the judge
decides they are still a pos-
sible danger to themselves
or others, or are unable to
provide for food, clothing,

inmates frequently have
their hands and feet tied to
a bed in leather restraints
and may be confined to an
isolation cell as punishment.

Even the right to refuse
electroshock is not absolute.
If individuals are judged by
a court to be incapable of
giving consent, they can be
given shock against their
will. Involuntary inmates
(those on holds or conserva-
torship) do not have the
right to refuse drugs. While
inmates who have voluntarily
admitted themselves to an
institution technically have
the right to sign themselves
out and to refuse drugs, they
can be quickly converted to
involuntary status if the
doctor does not agree with
their decision.

The eugenics movement,
which advocated the purifi-
cation of the human race
through sterilization of peo-
ple considered to be inferior
was founded by English psy-
chologist Francis Galton in
the late 1800s. Backed by
a number of industrialists,
the eugenics movement gained
strong support in the US, and
by 1928 the study of eugenics
was standard in most US col-
leges. Interracial marriage
was banned in 30 states,
most states passed legisla-
tion for the sterilization
of "misfits," and immigra-
tion from Eastern Europe and
Mediterranean countries was
limited. Between 1909 and
1934 over 15,000 psychiatric
inmates were sterilized in
California alone. The Amer-
ican Neurological Association
formed a committee in 1934
which, operating on a grant
from the Carnegie Institute,
concluded that the US should
follow the example of Ger-
many which had passed the
“Law for the Prevention of
Offspring with Hereditary
Diseases," setting up over
200 eugenics courts to de-
termine who would be ster-
ilized. Approximately
400,000 people considered
to be insane, feeble-minded,
or epileptic were sterilized
in Germany between 1933 and
1938. (Lenny Lapon, "Psych-
iatry: Tool of Fascism"; Sam
Samuel Chavkin, The Mind
Stealers; Shutts, Lobotomy)

The eugenicists in Germany
did not stop with steriliza-
tion. In 1920 psychiatrist
Alfred Hoche co-authored
The Destruction of Life De-
void of Value, advocating
the "mercy killing" (or
euthanasia) of people la-
beled mentally ill. The mass
extermination of German men-
tal patients began in the
summer of 1939. Leading
psychiatrists such as Max
de Crinis, professor of
psychiatry at the University
of Berlin, and Werner Heyde,
professor of psychiatry at
the University of Würzburg,
administered the extermina-
tion programs. At least
270,000 mental patients were
killed according to the
Czech War Crimes Commission.
The psychiatrists invented
techniques for mass killing,
and later introduced them to

Denigration, And Even Extermination

into the concentration camps
set up to destroy other
kinds of "undesirables":
Jews, gypsies, homosexuals,
political prisoners, etc. A
number of psychiatrists in-
volved in the mass murder

of mental patients continued
with their medical prac-
tices after the war. (Lenny
Lapon, "Psychiatry's Final
Solution"; Peter Breggin,
"The Killing of Mental Pa-
tients")

Support for the elimina-
tion of "useless eaters" was
expressed by leading physi-
cians in the US as well. Dr.
Alexis Carrel, a French-
American Nobel Prize winner
at the Rockefeller Institute,
published his book Man the
Unknown in 1935, in which he
recommended that so-called
criminals and mentally ill
be "humanely and economical-
ly disposed of in small
euthanasia institutions
supplied with proper gases."
And in 1941, Foster Kennedy,
chief of neurology at Belle-
vue Hospital and President

of the American Neurological
Association, advocated the
killing of “unfit and feeble
minded children of at least
five years of age" whom he
described as "useless and
foolish and entirely unde-
sirable." This position was
first presented at the an-
nual meeting of the American
Psychiatric Association, and
later published in the
Journal of the American
Psychiatric Association in
July 1942. The Journal
printed an editorial guard-
edly endorsing Kennedy's
views by pointing out that
the only objection to his
idea is the "fondness"
(quotation marks theirs) of
the parents for these chil-
dren, and suggesting that
perhaps the parents' atti-
tudes could be overcome with
exposure to the principles
of mental hygiene. (Bernard

The organized ex-inmates'
movement in North America
began with the founding of
the Insane Liberation Front
in Portland, Oregon, in 1970.
Soon after that groups sprang
up in New York, Boston, San

organizing

Francisco, and Vancouver. The
first International Confer-
ence on Human Rights and Psy-
chiatric Oppression was held
in Detroit in 1973, and has
been held annually every
year since then, organized by
ex-psychiatric inmates in
different parts of the US and
Canada. In 1972 a group of
mental health professionals
and former inmates came to-
gether to publish Madness
Network News, an anti-
psychiatry journal which has
become the main source of com-
munication for the movement in
the US. (The editorial staff
is now composed almost en-
tirely of former inmates.)
Among the more active
groups are the Network A-
gainst Psychiatric Assault,

which for eight years has
held demonstrations and
worked against electroshock
treatment in the San Fran-
cisco area; the Alliance for the
Liberation of Mental Patients,
which successfully organized
demonstrations and court
cases around the issue of
access for advocates to state
psychiatric institutions in
the Philadelphia area; the
Alternatives to Psychiatry
Association in Lake Worth,
Florida, which is running a
refuge house as an alterna-
tive to institutionalization;
and the Mental Patients Alli-
ance in upstate New York
which holds madness festivals,
educational forums on psy-
chiatric drugs, and demon-
strations. In Boston, the
Mental Patients Liberation
Front instigated the first
class action suit against
forced drugging (Mills v.
Rogers); in Pontiac, Michigan,
the Oakland Patients Environ-
mental Nexus provides legal
advocacy to inmates; the
Vermont Liberation Organiza-
tion has taken over manage-
ment of a rooming house to
provide housing and meeting

space; in Toronto, ex-inmates
run a drop-in center, a sec-
ond-hand store, and publish
an anti-psychiatry journal
called Phoenix Rising. There
are currently about 70 such
groups in North America,
Europe, and Australia.

Each year, during the Inter-
national Conference, the anti-
psychiatry movement holds
a demonstration at an appro-
priate location. One that
was felt to be particularly
appropriate was the demon-
stration held in 1978 at
Smith, Kline, and French
headquarters in Philadelphia
to protest the vast profits
made from forcing dangerous
chemicals such as Thorazine
and Stelazine on unwilling
inmates. Also at that Confer-
ence, a national boycott was
organized of all Smith Kline
products. At the 1977 Confer-
ence held in Los Angeles, the
movement voted to hold a na-
tional day of protest against
psychosurgery. Later that
year, demonstrations were
held in eight cities. In
1980 the focus was a protest
against the American Psychi-
atric Association conference

which was being held simul-
taneously with the ex-
inmate conference in the S.F.
area. Two hundred demonstra-
tors gathered outside of
Brooks Hall, where the APA
was meeting, while a smaller
contingent formed a human
chain to block the entrance-
way. Some demonstrators man-
aged to gain entrance to the
APA conference and engaged
in spontaneous disruptions of
workshops. In 1982, partici-
pants of the 10th Interna-
tional Conference, held in
Toronto, protested the annual
meeting of the APA with a
silent vigil in the lobby
of the Sheraton Hotel. Six-
teen demonstrators were
arrested.

One of the most dramatic
events in the history of the
movement was the month-long
sit-in organized by the Net-
work Against Psychiatric
Assault and Women Against
Psychiatric Assault in Gov.
Brown's office in 1976 to
protest forced labor without
pay and forced treatment and
incarceration in psychiatric
institutions. During the sit-
