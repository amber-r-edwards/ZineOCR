Hong Kong Women’s Council
A new organization, the Hong
Kong Women's Council, is spon-
soring a conference in October
on the theme ‘The Hong Kong
Woman 1975 — Where is She
Now?” The conference will
examine the changing values of
love and marriage, the expan-
ding amount of birth control
advice and services available,
and the changes in family struc-
ture resulting from Western
influence. The conference is a
first for Hong Kong women.

Divorce Laws
A Reality In Somalia

A socialist revolution has been
taking place in Somalia. One
result is that the old Moslem
divorce custom is no longer in
existence. A man can no longer
cast off his wife by simply
saying, “I divorce you” three
times. Now divorce is granted for
incompatibility, desertion, and
cruelty, and either may contest
or agree to the divorce.

Aldactone, a drug used to treat
swollen ankles (common in
domestic and office workers),
has been linked with breast
cancer.

Oregon Trinal Gathering

200 women came together for
a trinal gathering in the Oregon
Siskiyou National Forest July 18
- 23. Workshops covered
spirituality, health, therapy, arts
and more. Women camped and
ate in “families or clans.”
Minimal confrontation with pig
males was easily handled, and
much high woman energy
generated. The gathering was
organized by Oregon's Woman-
Spirit magazine.

Plastic Linked to Cancer

Polyvinyl chloride, a plastic
material commonly used for food
packaging, has a high cancer-
producing rate. Foods especially
absorbent of the carcinogen
include vegetable oils, luncheon
meats, and alcohol, also mouth-
washes.

Deodorants Linked
to Lung Cancer

Arrid, Right Guard, Secret, and
Soft ‘n Dri aerosol deodorants
now contain zirconium, believed
to cause lung cancer when
regularly inhaled. (Remember
that the use of aerosol spray
cans is contributing to the
destruction of the earth’s ozone
layer, too. So you get skin cancer
thrown in with the deal.)

Only Women Are Prostitutes

A Massachusetts court has
ruled that only women can be
arrested as prostitutes. A district
court in Brockton acquitted a 31-
year-old married man on charges
of accepting money for sex. The
court ruled that prostitution laws
pertain only to females.

Self-Help
The Oakland Feminist

College
Sexism

The following article was sent in
by the women involved in the
AURARIA TRANSCRIPT conflict.
They have informed us that they
wish to remain anonymous.

On the afternoon of Friday,
July 11, I came into the
Metropolitan State College
newspaper office in order to
complain to both author and
editor about a very sexist movie
review appearing on page 9 of
the June 18 Auraria Transcript.
The review began as follows:
“Eastwood Screws Again. A film
for both sexes: Men can imagine
they're screwing the chicks Clint
Eastwood is screwing and
women can imagine they're the
chicks being screwed by
Eastwood.”

I approached Leigh Hanlon,
the author, and began discuss-
ing the article with him. When it
became clear that he was in-
capable of defending himself
against my barrage of complaints,
Pappas, the editor, gallantly
demanded that I address these
comments to him. I explained
that the sexist attitudes implied
by that piece of questionable
journalism were oppressive to
women, that calling women
chicks was equivalent to calling
blacks niggers and that it very
offensively described women as
sex objects and men as fucking
machines. Pappas responded
that not everyone was prudish
and then continued, “Everybody
fucks, don’t they?”

It was obvious at this point
that Pappas lacked even the
most rudimentary feminist con-
sciousness and that my rational
verbal complaint had gone right
over his head. He had, in a
typically chauvinistic fashion,
confused my attack on sexist
article.

The discussion regressed into
heated argument and namecall-
ing from both sides. I said that I
was embarrassed to be going to
Metro with that kind of garbage
being printed in the student
newspaper - and this kind of
trashy pointing at Pappas, doing
the editing. I then struck him
with a flimsy, rolled-up, 8-page
newspaper. He flew from his
desk and approached within an
inch of me. I prepared myself for
verbal assault.

Instead, I was slammed across
an empty desk while three
newspaper staffers sat idly by.
When I got to my feet it was clear
that Pappas had snapped, that
he had become violently
irrational and that I was dealing
with a subhuman equivalent of a
mad, wounded boar and I
attempted to defend myself. I
was thrown to the ground,
wrestled, punched, and finally
my shirt was pulled over my
head. At this point one of the
three men in the room decided to
come to my rescue. “Hey,” he
mumbled from behind a desk but
Pappas chose to ignore his
chivalrous effort and threw me
over some debris and out the
door. I returned to my feet and
re-entered the office to recover
my knapsack and other
belongings. I was once again
confronted by Pappas, “This is
my office. Don’t you ever come in
here again.” Me: “This is a
campus office and I’ll come in
here whenever I fucking please,
you pig.” Needless to say I was
once again thrown over the
garbage in the doorway and out
into the hall. College Center
Special Programs Director Dick
Ricketts witnessed both of my
“forceful escorts to the door”
although he saw nothing of what
happened inside the office.

The rest of this article has
been written collectively by all of
the women involved.

The following week a number
of friends of the woman involved
in the original incident became
enraged when the woman
related her encounter and they
saw the cuts and bruises she
had received from Pappas.
Criminal assault charges against
Pappas were contemplated but
as the only witnesses to the
incident were Pappas’s cronies.
We considered asking for Pap-
pas’ removal from his post as
editor but felt that this was not
realistic as he was the only
applicant for the position and
feared that an administrative
remedy would be no more than
slapping his hands. We all
agreed that a personal confron-
tation with Pappas demanding
an apology was necessary. In
light of what had happened to
the original woman, we were
forced to consider the possibility
of a physical fight with Pappas.
There was much concern over
whether this was a legitimate
way of dealing with the situ-
ation. Although we agreed that
violence is an ugly way of
handling things, we also realized
that we must be prepared to
confront these violent attacks
upon ourselves and our sisters.
If we refuse to fight sexism on all
levels, we automatically sur-
render those levels on which we
refuse to fight.

On Friday, July 18, five
women (although Pappas seem-
ed to think there were 8 of us)
entered the Transcript office
intending to demand an apology.
Our spokesperson began to
explain why we were there
when Pappas grabbed a Pepsi
bottle in one hand and a stapler
in the other. Fearing that he
might strike the spokesperson,
several women grabbed his
arms. A struggle ensued.
Several men from nearby offices
heard the commotion and
entered the room. We left quick-
ly. One woman sustained a gash
on her hand from Pappas’ Pepsi
bottle.

The following issue (Aug. 13,
page 5) of the Auraria Transcript
contained the most hideous,
appalling, insulting, contempti-
ble, sexist piece of journalism
we had ever read. This is the
“Kampus Komedee” ostensibly
written by Pappas. Copies are
available on campus. In light of
all this we make the following
statement.

If Metropolitan State College
desires to become a respectable
educational institution, they are
going to have to do some
housecleaning and apologizing.
This kind of blatant sexism from
the EDITOR of the student
operated, university supported
newspaper cannot be tolerated.

Peter Pappas, as editor of the
Auraria Transcript, occupies a
very sensitive and influential
position in the college. He is a
representative of the student
body and should conduct himself
as such, and yet he has shown
only the most wanton disrespect
and contempt for women. We
are conducting a petition drive
demanding Pappas’ removal and
ask that all qualified persons
submit applications for the posi-
tion of editor.
