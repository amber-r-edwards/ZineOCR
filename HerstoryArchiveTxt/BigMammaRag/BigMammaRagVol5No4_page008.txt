Pilgrim’s Progress  
High Priestess Z Budapest is calling  
on women to travel with her to the  
“ancient seat of matriarchies in  
Anatolia" (Turkey) as a “symbolic re-  
claiming of wimmin's religion lost  
and slandered by patriarchy."

Still fighting her 1975 fortune-  
telling conviction in Los Angeles,  
Z is the founder of the Sisterhood of  
the Wicca, the first “feminist re-  
ligion” incorporated in California.

Her plans for the tour include an  
attempt to raise from the swamps an  
ancient temple of Diana. It was sunk  
by the goddess herself, Z says, in  
order to save it until the priestesses  
return. For more information, call  
Womontours, 5314 N. Figueroa St., Los  
Angeles, CA 90042.

CULTURAL  
VALUES

Music Festival

Despite early trouble in renting  
university space, organizers of the  
4th annual National Women's Music  
Festival have set it up for the week  
of June 28-July 3 in Champaign, IL.

Space problems resulted from con-  
troversy last year over the admission  
of men. Some participants barred men  
from some of the events, and early  
closure of the festival was threatened  
by the University of Illinois over  
Title IX violations.

This year the festival collective  
has placed a priority on open admission  
based on a goal of bringing feminist  
values into the public as a whole.

For more info and registration details,  
write P.O. Box 2721 Sta. A, Champaign,  
IL 61820.

High School Feminism

It had always been that way at Holy  
Family High School in Denver: The  
“head boy" was the equivalent of stu-  
dent council president, and “head girl”  
was vice president. Head boys had al-  
ways been boys, and head girls, girls.  
Until Mary Pughes came along.

Pughes, a student rights advocate,  
managed to tie for the post of head  
boy in this spring's elections. But  
she lost without a runoff after male  
students backed by the administration  
took her name off the ballot.

"I don't think this publicity will  
be good for Mary. I think in the future  
she'll understand why," Sister Frances  
told the Denver press.

Ah, but she already does.

Hospital Protest

Four feminist health workers were  
jailed briefly in Tallahassee, Florida  
following an inspection of maternity  
procedures at Tallahassee Memorial  
Hospital. The charge was trespassing.

The inspection was conducted by 30  
women from health projects throughout  
the country during a March conference  
of WATCH (Women Acting Together  
to Combat Harassment). The protest  
was aimed at the increasing deperson-  
alization and increasing use of harm-  
ful technology in hospital maternity  
care.

Arrested were Ginny Cassidy, found-  
er of Womancare, the first feminist  
controlled home birth program in the  
US; Janice Cohen, Linda Curtis and  
Carol Downer. Downer was arrested in  
1971 for practicing medicine without  
a license when she recommended yogurt  
as a treatment for yeast infections.

Lesbian Mothers

Interviews with lesbian mothers and  
their children are still sought for a  
study which may produce information  
useful to lesbians facing child custody  
cases. The study is funded by the  
National Institute of Mental Health.

Privacy is guaranteed, and children  
will not be asked any questions about  
their parent's sexuality or sex in  
general. For more information, write  
to Mary Hotvedt, c/o Long Island Re-  
search Institute, P.O. Box Q, Central  
Islip, New York, NY 11722, or call  
Jane Mandel in the Chicago area at  
312-475-4773.

More Grand Jury Abuse

Until recently, Maria Cueto and  
Raisa Nemikin were officers of the  
National Commission on Hispanic Af-  
fairs of the Episcopal Church. Now  
they are prisoners. They were jailed  
for refusing to cooperate with a grand  
jury investigating a series of bombings  
attributed to FALN, a Puerto Rican  
liberation force.

Cueto and Nemikin deny knowledge of  
the bombings, but also refuse to coop-  
erate with a government fishing exped-  
ition to “harass, frighten and in-  
timidate" churches. The commission had  
supported Puerto Rican independence.

Letters of support should go to  
both women c/o Metropolitan Correction-  
al Center, 150 Park Row, New York, NY

Choked Words

Twisted Logic Quote of the Month,  
or It Takes More Than Just Having a  
Woman in the Statehouse:

"In fact a nuclear power plant is  
infinitely safer than eating, because  
300 people choke to death on food every  
year." --Dixy Lee Ray, governor of  
Washington and former head of the  
Atomic Energy Commission.

Don’t Speak Up

A new sociology study suggests  
that the best way to deal with men  
who dominate conversations is to  
freeze them out -- rather than learn-  
ing to “speak up."

Pamela Fishman of the University  
of California studied the conversa-  
tions of three middle-class couples,  
and found that the women raised  
nearly twice as many topics of con-  
versation as did the men. The problem  
was that the women's topics failed  
to elicit any response.

The men in the study didn't have  
the same trouble, since the women  
generally responded enthusiastically  
when their husbands spoke.

Boycott Del Monte

Within South Africa, Del Monte  
Corporation owns a large food process-  
ing plant which --along with many  
other US financial and industrial in-  
volvements--helps sustain apartheid.  
The corporation also has a contract  
with a South African fishing firm to  
export sardines caught off the coast  
of Namibia. The extremely low wages  
paid to African workers ($37 per month)  
keep the profits coming in for Del  
Monte, which operates in 17 states and  
21 foreign countries.

Del Monte has a special relationship  
to women. Its annual budget of $15  
million for advertising is aimed pri-  
marily at women. Women are also the  
majority of the 70,000 workers who  
find jobs in the California canneries;  
70% earn less than poverty level wages.

Airborne Estrogen

Workers at a birth control plant in  
Puerto Rico have suffered serious side  
effects from exposure to hormones in  
the air. According to a recent study  
released by the Center for Disease  
Control, 12 women workers at the Ortho  
Pharmaceutical plant experienced un-  
usual vaginal bleeding after they came  
in contact with estrogen, the major  
component of the Pill. Several men de-  
veloped enlarged breasts.

Federal health authorities have  
known about the dangers of exposure to  
estrogen for some time, but the study  
at the Ortho plant was the first doc-  
umentation of its effects on workers.

Prison Victory

In the first suit to be filed in  
the US in behalf of female prisoners’  
rights, a superior court judge in Los  
Angeles ruled recently that women  
jailed without trial at the Sybil  
Brand Institute have been denied  
their constitutional rights. The  
judge said that the women--detained  
for lack of bail and still legally  
presumed innocent--are often treated  
worse than women sentenced to do time.

He ordered improvements on unrea-  
sonable restrictions on visiting ar-  
rangements, movement within the jail,  
telephone calls, library use and re-  
ceipt of magazines. The suit was  
filed four years ago.

Fight Anita

A Denver area group is organizing  
support for the gay rights bill in  
Dade County, Florida, which is facing  
a strong repeal effort by Anita  
Bryant and other right-wing groups.

The local group is named for the  
date of the Dade County gay rights  
bill referendum. The June Seventh  
Committee will do fund-raising--in-  
cluding an Anita Bryant look-alike  
contest. For more info write P.O.  
Box 1402, Boulder, CO 80306 or call  
492-8567.

Pill Hazard

Until recently, liver tumors were rare.  
But now they have been linked to  
mestranol, a synthetic estrogen found  
in birth control pills. If you've been  
taking the pill for five or more years,  
you should have a liver palpitation  
as part of your physical exam.

--Feminist Communications

The all-male Houston City Council  
voted recently to abolish the post of  
advocate for women's rights. But an  
all-night protest rally in support of  
the controversial advocate, Nikki Van  
Hightower, helped to force Mayor  
Hofheinz to rehire her the next day as  
an “affirmative action specialist."

Van Hightower had come under attack  
by groups opposing the ERA and abor-  
tion rights for her participation in  
a March 5 International Women's  
Rally. Van Hightower says that while  
she has no power, most of her work has  
been aimed at organizing and mobiliz-  
ing women.

Pregnant Workers’ Rights

Strong support is behind recently  
introduced legislation to protect  
the rights of pregnant workers on the  
job. Introduced in both houses of  
Congress, the bills would amend the  
1964 Civil Rights Act to include a  
ban against discrimination because  
of pregnancy.

The legislation is the result of  
an extensive campaign by feminist,  
labor and civil liberties groups.

--The Spokeswoman

Segregation

Pressure from feminist and lesbian  
groups has eased conditions for les-  
bians at the Los Angeles County Jail  
for women. The “Daddy Tank" where les-  
bians had been kept under maximum sec-  
urity conditions has been phased into  
a medium security "Daddy Dorm". In the  
new quarters women sleep in a dorm in-  
stead of in cells and have access to  
an open day room. They are also eli-  
gible for occupational classes and  
recreation programs. Before the change  
all lesbians confined to the tank were  
restricted to a single shift in the  
prison laundry for earning extra cred-  
its. The L.A. County jail is the only  
one in the country which segregates  
lesbians from straight women.
