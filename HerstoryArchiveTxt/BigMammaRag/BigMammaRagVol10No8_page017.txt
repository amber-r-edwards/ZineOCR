In Response

Dear Kathleen,

Thanks for taking the time
to write your compliments and
criticisms to BMR. Our "Where
We're At" column is important
to us and our process.

BMR did question whether or
not Jenny Miller's review of
the documentary film, “Hurry
Tomorrow," made on a male
ward at Metropolitan State Hos-
pital in L.A., CA by a male
filmmaker belonged in the
pages of BMR. The film review
appeared in BMR because we
think it is an important film,
an important document from
the Mental Patients Libera-
tion Movement. Access to
filming any other parts of the
inmate population, including
women, was denied by the ins-
titution. Apparently the
ward filmed was seen as the
"best" in that institution.

This film carefully docu-
ments the real interests of
psychiatry and society in a
glimpse of who gets locked up
and why, especially in rela-
tion to race and class. The
psychiatrists' dismissal of
the young man's anger at being
hungry, at being locked up,
as a “hair grandiose," is only
one example of the psychia-
tric double-talk (racism and
classism in practice) captur-
ed on this film.

The issue you raised of
“males demand lifetime access"
is real, but moreover this
film and the review emphasizes
the question of whether the
“crime"/trespassing warrants
the "punishment"/"treatment"
of forced drugging with mind-
damaging drugs and spread ea-
gle restraints.

As a feminist I feel repre-
sented by this film. The pain
and gruesome reality of life
on a "mental ward" in "Hurry
Tomorrow" always leaves me
pacing in the back of the
theatre. I also found a harsh
note on reality in the anec-
dote relayed by Richard Cohen
about the student psych techs.
They did have a tendency to
surround patients on the ward
asking inane questions, and
just as nervous and frightened
as they could be. We did the
best we could to capitalize
on their fears, spending days
making up "mental patient"
stories to tell to the stu-
dents.

We hope that our readers
and writers will help us con-
nect with...or write for BMR,

madness such as the film:

"The Road I Took To You: Sto-
ries of Women And Craziness"
listed in this month's resour-
ces. Help get these works out.

In Struggle,

NACLA In Need!

Dear Friends,

The North American Congress
On Latin America's publication
NACLA: Report on the Americas
needs some economic support
to keep printing. The Inter-
nal Revenue Service is trying
to take away their non-profit
tax status. Interestingly,
one of the reasons they have
given in writing for consider-
ing this step is that some of
their publications refer disre-
spectfully to the Rockefeller
family! NACLA has long been
committed to the struggle to
fight the Reagan propaganda
machine with accurate infor-
mation about the Central Am-
erican crisis, past and pre-
sent.

The Reagan Administration
and its allies in Latin Amer-
ica have embarked on a drama-
tic offensive against a popu-
lar rebellion in Central Am-
erica and progressive opinion
here in the U.S. In El Salva-
dor, the D'Aubuisson terror-
ists and their allies in the
army have begun to acceler-
ate their "anti-subversive"
campaign and it can now only
get worse.

In Guatemala, large-scale
rebellion and savage repres-
sion continue under the "new
regime of a born-again gener-
al. In Honduras, over a hun-
dred U.S. "advisors" teach
counter-insurgency techniques
to an army that may plunge
its people into a regional
war. In Nicaragua a long-suf-
fering people struggles to
introduce social justice and
rebuild a war-shattered eco-
nomy in the face of border
raids, economic sabotage, and
a credit blockade--all part
of a covert CIA destabiliza-
tion program. Working together
we can still defeat the Reagan
offensive.

In Solidarity,

Barb and Joan
(For the Iowa City Women's
Press Collective)

This is a letter about in-
visibility--the invisibility
of lesbian/feminist-owned
printshops and the women who
work there. It is about how
they will survive these econ-
omic and political times--or
not survive. In particular,
this is a letter about the
Iowa City Women's Press and
the struggles for survival
that we are going through
today.

By way of background: the
Iowa City Women's Press was
formed in 1972 by a collec-
tive of eight women. Our main
reasons for forming the press
were (1) to help women gain
more control over their
printed words and (2) to help
women gain more control over
their lives through access
to skills. We hoped to accom-
plish this second aim by
learning and teaching print-
ing skills and by publishing
skills manuals. The first
goal came directly out of the
Iowa City experiences of
Ain't I A Woman? newspaper
(published between 1970 and
1974), in which the male
printers refused to print an
issue that contained medical
self-help photographs, saying
that they would not print
"pornography."

We started as a small,
volunteer-run printshop in a
converted garage, and we have
grown into a business that
employs 4-5 women full-time,
with associated bindery and
typesetting businesses em-
ploying another 3-4 women.
For the past two years, we
have chosen to concentrate
more and more on printing
books for lesbian/feminist
publishers and self-publishing
women, and on printing
periodicals such as Common
Lives/Lesbian Lives and
Sinister Wisdom. We continue
to produce our two skills
manuals, Greasy Thumb and
Against the Grain, which are
now in their fifth printing.
Over the next year, we plan
to reorganize the publishing
arm of the Press and hope to
bring out several new titles.

Two of the problems we
have faced continually in
the years of our existence
are (1) trying to compete as
an undercapitalized business
in a highly capitalized in-
dustry and (2) credibility.
Because we do not have the
money to acquire the highly
technologized printing equip-
ment that is now the standard
in the printing industry
(particularly in the book
printing industry, where 140
