Dear Friends and Colleagues,

I have been invited by a Peruvian
women's organization, Mujeres in
Lucha (Women in Struggle), to visit
Peru during the summer of 1981. I
will be meeting with women's politi-
cal groups throughout the country. As
you may know, I lived in Peru for
several years, from 1973-1976, teach-
ing at the Universidad Nacional del
Centro, in Huancayo, working with
farm women through the Confederacion
Campesina del Peru, and participating
in popular urban movement in the
“pueblos jóvenes” (new towns) of
Lima. Since then I have been in close
touch with continuing struggles there.

In order to finance my way to Peru
next summer, and in order to share
knowledge about Peruvian economic and
political life, I would like to give
presentations in the homes of friends.
I have pictures, music and poetry,
as well as a great deal of informa-
tion to share. The meetings could be
informal potlucks or gatherings of
people who might be willing to contri-
bute something toward my trip or to-
ward popular struggles in Peru.

Please let me know if you would
like to sponsor such an event. My
home phone number is 777-6562.

Sincerely yours,
Andrea Gabriel

“A novel that reflects the women's movement with
humor and passion. There are no gimmicks to this
book. The process of “coming to terms with women's
liberation for three main characters is what the book is
all about: and this is what makes Seed of a Woman
more than a documented history of women’s personal
and ultimately political change. The women in the
book are all around us - and we are all discovering
by trial and error the right answers to many of our
questions. The voice and images of these women are
timely for today. The writing in Seed of a Woman is
clear, the dialogue realistic, and the story leaves an
impact that won't fade. Read this book.”

Stories by the author of
Seed of a Woman

These stories are about working women whose
daily lives are marked by their encounters with
evil. Ruth Geller’s people are so real, so
ordinary, that their heroism stuns me, and I
am grateful to her for the quiet compassion with
which she does the writer's job.
