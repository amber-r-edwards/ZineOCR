**Lesbians - Colorado Conference Controversy Continues**

Dear Women,

I would like to offer support for  
the obviously unpopular stand BMR  
took regarding the Community Meeting  
preceding the Lesbians Colorado Con-  
ference. Although I do not agree  
with all that was said in the article,  
i.e. the inappropriate use of the  
word fascist and the statement that  
conference planners knew what "thrust  
the workshops would have, I must a-  
gree with the basic tone of the arti-  
cle. There was, undeniably, incredi-  
ble tension at that meeting. And, I  
feel, the tension was due to one ba-  
sic problem—that conference planners  
were bending over backward to keep  
from offending every conceivable type  
of lesbian except lesbians who iden-  
tified themselves as revolutionary  
feminists. During the course of the  
meeting questions and criticisms were  
raised about outreach to revolution-  
ary feminists and Third-World les-  
bians, the racism and anti-feminism  
inherent in the original policy on  
male children, the potentially work-  
ing class exclusionary location of  
the conference, the exclusion of the  
word feminists from publicity and  
policy statements, and what attempts  
were being made to recruit facilita-  
tors for certain workshops. The ne-  
cessity for some of these questions  
to be asked at all led some women to  
feel that feminism might well be for-  
ced into the closet at this confer-  
ence. Conference planners assured  
us that yes, they were feminists, but  
that to come out and say so in print  
might offend certain potential parti-  
cipants. But what about offending  
revolutionary feminists? For les-  
bians to gather together simply on  
the basis of their sexual preference  
promises as much potential change in  
our lives and in the system as would  
spending the day at Elitch's. The  
conference will certainly be for some  
a good time, a high time, even an  
energizing time but will it help to  
topple the system that keeps us down  
unless the destruction of capitalism/  
patriarchy is given priority? For  
those of us that cannot abide the  
system, the mere coming together on  
the basis of sexual preference seems  
essentially an ineffectual, and even  
potentially reactionary reason for a  
conference. And, if revolutionary  
feminist ideology were to be the  
actual priority of the conference  
planners (a situation alluded to at  
the meeting) while publicity made no  
such claims, could not a case be made  
for the conference planners having a  
hidden agenda? Hidden agendas are  
unethical at best and usually make  
potential coalitions between differ-  
ing groups at a gathering absolutely  
impossible because of the level of  
suspicion aroused. Perhaps the im-  
plication that the conference would  
be feminist was made to placate the  
revolutionary feminists present. Or  
were there simply different meanings  
of the word feminist in use at the  
meeting? Frankly, I don't know. I  
do know, however, that concern over  

the existence of revolutionary femi-  
nist concerns at the conference was  
justified at this meeting. To blith-  
ely assume that we are all out there  
fighting "the system" is foolish and  
dangerous. I commend BMR for its  
courage in recognizing this fact.

Respectfully,  
Kate Sharp

Dear Big Mama Rag,

I have just moved here from San  
Francisco. I came looking for the  
unity of a smaller community. From  
what I have been able to see through  
what Big Mama Rag is printing, there  
is the same petty arguing going on  
between “special interest" groups.  
Maybe I am still unfamiliar with the  
politics here, but frankly sisters,  
from the size of this community I  
don’t think we can afford to fight  
amongst ourselves. If we keep bick-  
ering we remain easy prey for the  
patriarchy. They want us to keep  
fighting amongst ourselves because  
then we stay out of their territory.  
In order to take the step towards  
equality and freedom we must stay  
together, and from what I've seen  
Denver has a long way to go on both  
counts. Think about it; there is  
something that can be done—TOGETHER!

In sisterhood,  
Gretchen Bryant

Dear Women,  
In the August/September issue of  
1966 our backs an interview concerning  
the Southeast Lesbian Network appeared.  
The network is one year old, and they  
state, "Some of the needs to talk about  
and work on, as Southern Lesbians are:  
---to deal with racism  
---to be aware of our diversities  
...to discuss our political identi-  
fication/ideology  
---to share fears/anticipated pro-  
blems of planning the full gath-  
ering and organizing the Network.  

Priorities of the Network are dealing  
with racism and children's concerns."

We as radical feminists think it is  
important to admit to ourselves, and to  

others in the women's community and move  
ment, that there are large political dif-  

ferences among us. By radical we mean  
not to reform the system to include us,  
but to begin to develop a revolutionary  

ideology which would benefit all peoples  

equally.

We came to the community meeting  
about the Lesbian Conference with a  
sense of commitment to struggle around  

the issue of male children at the confer-  

ence. It was something we did not want  
to do, but had to do.

To pretend that these differences do  
not exist is to doom our movement. We  
cannot pretend to ourselves that be-  
cause we want to change the system that  

oppresses us that we can agree with each  

other on what kind of changes are to be  
made.  

Our politics are as personal and im-  
portant to us as just about any other  
emotional, physical and intellectual  
commitments we can think of. Criticism  

made by radical lesbian feminists of the  

liberal politics of the Lesbian Confer-  
ence planning committee are not made  
lightly. Criticism was made out of a  

commitment to struggle, political growth  

and unification of the Lesbian-Radical  
Feminist Movement. If criticism—self  
criticism and a space to struggle over  

political differences were not a part of  

the reasons for holding community meet-  
ings, the conference could have easily  
proceeded without them.

We can only trust those women whom  
we perceive as having goals similar to  
ours, whose process we understand,  
whose willingness to struggle is para-  
mount.

We have to admit that sexual pre-  
ference does not automatically grant  
us affinity.

A conference on lesbianism is not  
enough because gay rights are not e-  
nough. In-system politics will not  
be our salvation. If the gay rights  
march held recently in Washington,  
D.C., were to have miraculously passed  
gay rights legislation, perhaps some  
of our Black sisters could tell us  
how little legislation matters in the  
application of those laws. Gay legis-  
lation cannot be enough until minor-  
ity, poor, and aged lesbian sisters  
are free from the effects of racism,  
classism, and ageism. And it is not  
enough if only lesbians are free, for  
we have mothers, fathers, sisters,  
brothers, sons and daughters. There  
are some men and some non-lesbian  
women with whom unity is more real a  
possibility than with some of the  
lesbian community.

We have to admit that in the white  
women's movement there is racism,  
class division, liberalism, fascism,  

We cannot pretend that our “oppress-  

sion affects us all the same way.

tending the entertainment as a false  
issue, seized on by feminist women at  
the community meeting to hassle the  
planning committee members. Not to  
see the issue of male children at a  
conference, at a festival (the Michi-  
gan Women's Music Festival most re-  
cently), and in our lives is to ig-  
nore one of the truly large issues we  
have yet to resolve in our movement.  
Many of us have male children of all  
ages. The age of the male child pre-  
sents different problems to the moth-  
er, but all of us need support. The  
main support has to come from women  
in the movement, not only because  
many of us know each other personally  
(and that is not enough), but primar-  
ily because of a political ideology.  
What is the purpose of backing les-  
bian mothers’ custody cases if not  

to show support? Do all the cases  
deal with only girl children? Do we  
support the lesbian mother in her  
court fight, only to turn our backs  
on her in our own communities? How  
in our own community do we show sup-  
port, how do teenage sons fit into  
their lesbian mothers' lives, what  

is the place for older sons in our  
life, how do we respond to younger  
sons? We ask these questions as one  
of us is a lesbian mother with 21  

and 24 year old sons, and one of us  
lives with a lover who has a 6 year  
old son who lives with them.

A conference to call lesbians to-  
gether can be a good thing, if it is  
built on solid workshops that speak  
to the issues that are vital to our  
existence. We don't feel that the  
recent conference in Denver was built  
on those types of workshops. The  
omission of the word "feminist"  
can't merely be brushed aside, it is  
too important a political part of  
our lives to put back in the closet.

At the August community meeting  
we heard that "the workshop commit-  
tee, a separate group from the plan-  
ning committee, was still in the pro-  
cess of formulating workshops and  
looking for facilitators." (quote  
from BMR "Letters", Kathy Bougher).  
We don't understand the wording of  
the quote, how can the workshop com-  
mittee be separate from the organ-  
izing committee? If organized well  
the workshops must reflect the poli-  
tics of the organizing committee and  
complement the goals of the confer-  
ence. Did the workshop committee  
act in a vacuum? The politics as  
we understood them, was to omit the  
word feminist, to have the confer-  
ence in a suburban hotel, to have  
one workshop on racism, no workshops  
on class division, and to focus on  
how to feel good about being a dyke  
over and above dealing with the  
sources of lesbian oppression.

How do we want to change the  
system and to what are the overrid-  
ing questions? Do we hide feminism  
as if it should be in the closet?  

Do we struggle with class privilege  
or do we simply ignore the fact that  
many women are dirt poor? Do we  
deal with the racism that exists  
within ourselves? Do we in the move-  
ment consider our own racism and  
class difference as major items  

that we have to deal with not only  
in our personal lives, but also in  
the life of our movement? Any white  

women's movement has to be willing  
to deal with many basic political  

issues before Black, Puerto Rican,  

Asian and Native American women will  
consider it worth their time to work  
with us.

To what aim is unity desired, and  
on what basis? Trust is built sLow-  
ly and carefully. Who can we trust?  
Who is the enemy? We are the enemy,  
each one of us who discounts the im-  
portance of going to meetings, who  
think that political ideas, politi-  
cal women, and political struggle  
are a waste of time. Unity cannot  
be forged without a lot of words,  
struggle, action and energy. We are  
not trying to keep a movement alive  
to keep ourselves busy. Unless  
there is a firm political basis for  
unity, that unity will be destroyed  
when the first challenge comes along.  
Leaving behind women who are disap-  
pointed, bewildered and angry...not  
at the challenge, but at the women  
who would not stand by each other.

Politics and the world we exist in  
go hand in hand for all of us.  

radicalism, lesbianism, feminism...  
the whole ball of wax.

It is foolhardy of the radical les-  
bian feminist movement not to believe  
that there are lesbians who are a-  
gainst the radical political community.  
Then working in the male gay movement  
there was much talk about the exist-  
ence of gay nazi groups. We cannot  
assume any less a broad political  
spectrum just because we are lesbians.  
Political unity based on sexual pre-  
ference alone seems to us a dangerous  
and uninformed stance for the radical  
lesbian movement to take. Homosexuals  
who are racist, sexist, and classist  
work against themselves and thereby  
act to support their own oppression.  
Just as we never wanted to be respon-  
sible for breast-feeding feminism to  
gay and political men, minority les-  
bians should not be responsible for  
educating white women about our ra-  
cism.

In Carol Lease's letter we felt  
she was saying that women were jump-  
ing on the issue of male children at-

**-Carol Arber**

Dear Big Mama,

I feel that it is important to re-  
spond to the letter written by Lori  
Bradford and Bobbe Ross in which they  
discuss the politics of Lesbians-Colo-  
rado, the first state-wide lesbian  
conference held in late September.  
Readers, especially those who did not  
attend the conference, should be pro-  
vided with more than one perception  
of events, individuals and political  
issues.

For a more comprehensive look at  
the conference, an after conference  
report will be mailed to all confer-  
ence participants and anyone else  
who requests it by the end of Novem-  
ber. Write Lesbians-Colorado, P.O.  
Box 18767, Denver, Colorado 80218.

We still have our office at 1553 High  
St. #4 where women can find informa-  
tion regarding networks (over 20 at  
this time) that formed at or through  
the conference.

I want to make my response to the  
letter brief. Important issues were  
raised in the letter that should be  
addressed and discussed where dia-  
logue can occur, not solely slung in  
print at the perceived political be-  
liefs or stance of any individual or  
group. This method of hit and run  
criticism does no one involved jus-  
tice. It does not help develop radi-  
cal lesbian-feminist action because  
there is no commitment to communicate  
and struggle, only blindly criticize  
and pound down lesbian-feminists who  
are acting, not perfectly but acting  
and assisting in the creation of a  
diverse, visible, cohesive political  
presence of lesbians in this city  
and state. If you had bothered to  
ask us our political motivations I  
don't think you would have made some  
of the more self-righteous statements  
that you did in your letter.

Why set oneself up as the guard-  
ians of radical lesbian-feminist  
politics when our theory is still  
being developed and cannot be done  
in a political vacuum? We cannot  
strengthen this revolution until we  
are no longer afraid of diversity in  
political action of lesbian-feminists  
who don't fill any one “politically  
correct" mold.

It seems to me that there are many  
ways to accomplish the same goal. I  
think that it is a mistake to label  
one "purer", one "dangerous"; there-  
by weakening our unity, alienating  
ourselves from each other and, in  
your words, “leaving behind women  
who are disappointed, bewildered and  
angry...not at the challenge, but  
at the women who would not stand by  
each other". Haven't we all learned  
this through association with vari-  
ous women's and lesbian-feminist  
groups?

One of the great myths of our  
second wave of feminism is that ma-  
king a revolution has to be boring,  
depressing, alienating and full of  
martyrs. Because some of us don't  
fit the stereotype of the committed  
visionary (the male stereotype) is  
irrelevant. We still are. We are  
not disillusioned about what lies  
ahead or politically naive or dupes  
of the system because we are not in  
total agreement with you or your  
politics. And we're certainly not  
unable to trust anyone other than  
(in your words) “those women who  
we perceive as having goals similar  
to ours, whose process we under-  
stand...".
