reprinted in a newsletter sent to

~~ the wives of interns and residents
in Denver. It's just another ex-
ample of the subtle mystification
of social roles.

The thing that makes a physi-
cian a very special person is his
decision to dedicate himself to
the practice of medicine. Except
for this universal dedication
every doctor is different, just
as every man is different. It is
your adjustment to the individual
doctor who is your husband and
the life you must lead because of
his dedication that will determine
what kind of a doctor's wife you
will be.

A former president of the AMA
has said: "Nothing is as impor-
tant in shaping a doctor's career
as is his wife and home. The doc-
tor's wife must share his ideal-
ism, appreciate a standard of
values held by no other group and
give him an understanding re-
quired by few. Being a doctor's
wife is both a career and an art."

In any career or art there are
techniques to be mastered. So it
is with the career of being a doc-
tor's wife. Of the necessary
techniques or qualities, I would
first list unselfishness. You
must learn to be unselfish with

your husband because whether you
like it or not, he belongs first
to his profession. In your in-
nocence when you married him you
probably thought the phrase in
the ceremony "In sickness and in
health" meant just you two. You
were wrong for with a physician
it really means the sickness and
health of the whole community.
You must unselfishly share him
with his patients, with medical
meetings and all the other things
that are required of him if he is
to be a good doctor. The very
nature of his profession makes him
public property.

You will understand the need
for patience with your children.
They will not have the insight a-
bout their Dad's preoccupation
with his profession. Your atti-
tude can be most important in
teaching your children to respect
their father's dedication. Your
teaching can make your children
know that their dad does "good"
for others and because of this he
cannot always be there when his
children want him.

A third quality is self-reli-
ance. You must learn to make de-
cisions yourself--decisions that
other women call upon their hus-
bands to make. You will have to
make decisions about your home,
your children, your attitude to-
ward life; you must lead the home-
front.

These then are some of the
qualifications of a good doctor's
wife--she is unselfish, patient,
self-reliant. A good marriage to
a doctor is partnership. It is
something that both of you will
have to work at to attain. It
doesn't just happen. The wife
has more than an equal share of
the responsibility to see that
the partnership is a good one. I
am reminded of a passage from
Kahlil Gibran's book, "The
Prophet" from the part in which
he speaks of marriage. He says:

You shall be together, But

let there be spaces in

your togetherness.

Love one another, but make

not a bond of love;

Fill each other's cup, but

drink not from one cup.

Give one another of your

bread, but eat not from

the same loaf;

Sing and dance together

and be joyous, but let

each of you be alone.

Though they quiver with
the same music, the
strings of the lute are
alone.

And stand together yet not
too near, For the pillars
of the temple stand apart

And the oak and the cy-
press grow not in each
other's shadow. . ."

Mrs. B.L. Robertson

He might have had the doctor
and his wife in mind when he wrote
those beautiful lines. As a
doctor's wife your first responsi-
bility is to your husband, your

family, your home. You may some-
times rebel against making so
many decisions on your own, a-
gainst so much disciplining of
your emotions but the reward will
be great. What more could you
ask than a contented husband and
happy children?
