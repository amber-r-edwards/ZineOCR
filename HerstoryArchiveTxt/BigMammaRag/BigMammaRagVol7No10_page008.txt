**Pornography Protest**

**7000 Women Converge on Times Square**

On October 20, 7000 people participated in the Women Against Pornography March in New York's Times Square. This demonstration was part of WAP's nine-month-old effort to mobilize women and men against the $4 billion pornography industry in the United States. Other U.S. cities have held similar marches; New York has one of the country's largest and most concentrated pornography districts.

Representatives from the entire spectrum of the women's movement participated in the march and rally; however, most of the participants were white and middle class. Gray Panthers, the National Lawyers Guild, women teachers and students from colleges in New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Jersey were among the marchers. Women's groups from Pittsburgh and Rhode Island marched beside actresses from the Actors and Directors Laboratory and the Screen Actors Guild.

The Amalgamated Clothing Workers Local 69 and the United Hebrew Trades ACWA were also present. Nurses held up a large sign reading, "Nurses want the hard-core porn out of the Big Apple." Lesbians Against Pornography formed a large contingent.

During the early stages of the march, the onlookers appeared interested and even friendly. But as the march drew into Times Square, the climate changed. The marchers’ chanting took on an angry edge and spectators began to heckle demonstrators. Outside burlesque houses and porn movie theaters, the march halted for several minutes of concentrated booing and shouting.

Speakers at the Bryant Park Rally, which followed the march, discussed the censorship issue, women's rights, and WAP's position on pornography. Care was taken by march organizers to include speakers who presented a lesbian perspective on the issue, in part because a lesbian group from New York had objected to the march on the grounds that it might lead to further attacks on lesbians.

Speakers included Charlotte Bunch, a member of the National Gay Task Force and an editor of the quarterly magazine Quest, Teresa Hommel, a lesbian feminist lawyer, Robin Morgan, writer and poet, Gloria Steinem, editor of Ms. Magazine and former congresswoman, Bella Abzug.

Abzug said pornography is a "powerful industry—an industry which callously exploits images and ideas harmful to both women and men." Abzug and Black civil rights worker Amina Abdur-Rahman drew clear parallels between the antipornography movement and other progressive movements. They noted that the WAP march was a part of a larger struggle for political and economic freedom.

**Sex Tours**

Women Against Pornography, a New York-based radical feminist organization, is offering guided tours of New York City's “commercial sex" district to educate people about the nature and effects of pornography. The tour begins with a slide presentation in the group's storefront office near 42nd Street. The slides show how women are depicted in a pornographic manner in books and magazines and on record album covers and posters. The tour includes two "sex supermarkets," with their peepshows and "live sex shows," bookstores, and a topless bar. Participants in the tour are also told information ranging from a history of the neighborhood to the wages and working conditions of the women employed there.

Not only do manufacturers hope to sell women on the idea of being sex objects, they’re now targeting their packaging for consciousness raising among men around the issue of pornography and violence to women. Lynn Campbell, a founder of WAP, encouraged women to press for a new presidential commission to study the issue of pornography. The last such commission concluded in 1970 that pornography was socially harmless.

Future WAP strategy is still under consideration. "What we really want to do is hit the pornography industry," Delores Alexander, WAP spokesperson stated. "But that's hard because we're women and we don't buy it.”

WAP may mount a special campaign against Playboy, the most "respectable" of the pornographic magazines. Playboy has been making strenuous efforts to buy off opposition from the women's movement by offering grants to women's organizations and causes.

**Fighting Back**

In a landmark decision, an Ontario Human Rights Commission board of inquiry has awarded a Toronto woman $3000 in damages and $500 in lost wages after she filed a complaint of sexual harassment on the job. Nineteen-year-old Maria Ballesta filed the complaint against a meat-packing firm and a male employee after a male co-worker made sexual advances. He physically assaulted her in front of a company supervisor who failed to take any action; when she complained, she was accused of lying and told to leave the company. The case was the first of its kind to reach the tribunal stage and has brought to the public attention that sexual harassment of employees is a serious human rights problem.
