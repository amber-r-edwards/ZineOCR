Let Down Your  
Censorship  

The feminist film, "Rapunzel, Let  
Down Your Hair", is not allowed to be  
shown to anyone under 14 because of  
the rating by the British Board of Film  
Censors. A spokesman for the Board said  
that examiners who viewed the film felt  
that the sequence which showed women's  
interviews with gynecologists were par-  
ticularly unsuitable and irrelevant to  
those under 14. He also objected to  
adolescents being informed of "the his-  
tory of witches, their association with  
women's sexuality, the womb and men-  
struation" and a scene in which con-  
traceptives are discussed. The makers of  
"Rapunzel" intended to raise these sub-  
jects with young women who are in the  
greatest need of such information.

Gay Girl Discovered  

Women in Milton Keynes, England  
recently set up a health group which  
held discussions for women in the city  
on such topics as menopause and preg-  
nancy testing, and hoped later to run  
a once-a-week advice session.  

Their plans came to the notice of a  
reporter with the local newspaper who  
"discovered" that the session on sex  
counseling and sexuality was being  
run by Veronica Pickles, who got a lot  
of publicity three years earlier when  
she started a CHE (Campaign for Homo-  
sexual Equality) group in the town.  
The front page story was headlined,  
"Gay Girl Runs Sex Clinic." As the  
newspaper intended, their handling of  
the story has damaged the group's  
chances of reaching women whose hus-  
bands have refused to let their wives  
attend.

Sign of the Times  

On the eve of International Women's  
Day, hundreds of stop signs in Olympia,  
Washington were changed to read "stop  
rape." The local chapter of Women War-  
riors took credit for this action in  
a well-distributed statement. No one  
was apprehended, but the local paper  
reported that the police spent the  
wee hours of the morning removing  
"rape" stickers. (However, they didn't  
get them all.)

Are You Fuming?  

Xerox machines can be dangerous to  
working women. They can, and often do,  
produce ozone fumes as a byproduct.  
Ozone can cause throat and eye irrita-  
tion, coughs, headaches and chest pain.  
A government survey of the ozone in an  
office in Philadelphia showed that  
five out of six machines had potential-  
ly dangerous levels of ozone at the  
machine's delivery trays when they were  
operating continuously. Duplicators  
and electrostencil machines also give  
off hazardous fumes. It is important  
to take health symptoms seriously:  
headaches, sore throats and eye strain  
are often regarded as “personal pro-  
blems" rather than seen as work-related.

Pregnancy or Paralysis  

A group of British women have formed  
the Pill Victim Action Group to sue  
powerful American drug companies for  
damages running into millions of dol-  
lars due to harmful birth control  
pills. The women have 300 cases of  
pill damages in their files, including  
brain hemorrhage and paralysis, as  
well as pill-related deaths.  

The Pill Victim Action Group says  
that American drug companies selling  
the birth control pills in Britain do  
not give the same warnings that risks  
of blood clotting, strokes, heart at-  
tacks and other side effects may re-  
sult from use of the pill, that they  
are required to give women in the  
States.  

The Family Planning Association in  
England, meanwhile, is urging British  
women who are on the pill to keep tak-  
ing it, claiming that the risks con-  
nected with pregnancy are greater than  
those related to the pill.

The Equal Rights Amendment suffered  
another defeat late in May when Flor-  
ida's state Senate voted down the  
amendment, leaving it still three  
states short of being ratified. Sup-  
porters tried tacking the ERA onto  
another piece of legislation in hopes  
it would be approved. The Senate voted  
21-19 against ratification, the same  
margin by which it was defeated two  
years ago, making it the fourth time  
the ERA has been killed by the men  
in Florida's Senate.  

Kiss and Tell  

Florida's Coyote organization, the  
prostitutes’ union, is asking prosti-  
tutes in that state to name anti-ERA  
legislators who are their customers in  
a campaign to get the ERA passed.  
Coyote spokeswoman Darlene Lashman  
said it's now time to let lawmakers  
know “the ERA affects all women, not  
just ‘good' women." Lashman said the  
names of high-stepping businessmen and  
lawmakers will be turned over to  
Florida's feminist groups for use in  
the 1980 elections.

But, what if the wife dies first, while  
her children are still young?  

The husband is faced with more than the  
hastiness and burial expenses. He  
will have to hire a housekeeper, a  
cleaning woman, and others to perform  
the many duties previously taken care  
of by mother.  

Ask your co-op insurance representative  
how you can create an immediate cash  
fund for such an emergency. Tell him  
you are interested in wife insurance.  
Or, maybe we should call it "mother"  
insurance.

What’s a Daddy?  

According to a Gallup poll conducted  
for the publication "Woman's Own", one  
in six husbands has never looked after  
his child on his own; one fourth have  
never put their children to bed; and  
one in three have never read to their  
children.

Blightful Lifers  

Most so-called "pro-life" legisla-  
tors do not support legislation that  
seeks to improve the quality of life.  
This is the conclusion of a study  
which analyzes anti-abortion Congress  
people's votes on five key human wel-  
fare issues in 1978: health, educa-  
tion and welfare programs, jobs; the  
ERA; and consumer protection. Half  
of the group of the 142 studied, includ-  
ing anti-abortion leaders Robert Dor-  
nan, Henry Hyde and Bob Bauman,  
scored a zero, supporting none of the  
human welfare issues studied.

Battering Bills  

Despite the latest findings which  
cite wifebeating to be the most pre-  
valent crime between individuals, the  
96th Congress has failed to pass leg-  
islation on domestic violence. There  
were three bills proposed which would  
have made available millions of dol-  
lars for programs and services designed  
to assist victims of family vio-  
lence, but each of them died in com-  
mittee.

Dilly-dallying with Daly  

Boston College has stated they will  
take any steps necessary to ensure that  
Mary Daly's fall classes will be open  
to all students. The college claims  
that Daly, a prominent lesbian feminist  
theoretician, discriminates against  
men after it took a complaint from a  
man who visited her Feminist Ethics  
class in January. The college has fin-  
ally indicated it is not considering  
firing Daly, who has taught in the  
Theology Department for over ten years.  
The past decade she has been regularly  
harassed by college officials as her  
writings have become increasingly rad-  
ical and "post-Christian".
