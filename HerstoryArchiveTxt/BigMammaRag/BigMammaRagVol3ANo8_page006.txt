North Carolina Correctional Center

Prison Atrocities Revealed

Jackie St. Joan

During the week of June 15,  
200 inmates at the North  
Carolina Correctional Center for  
Women in Raleigh, where Joan  

Little had been held until  
February, participated in  
peaceful demonstrations for  

better health care and humane  
working conditions. The  
demonstrators, who  
represented almost half of the  
inmate population at the state’s  
only prison facility for women,  
refused to participate in prison  
routines, and remained on the  
prison grounds outside the  
buildings for four days. With  
support from a local group,  
Action for Forgotten Women, the  
inmates voiced their grievances  
and entered into negotiations  
with the administration in good  
faith.

However, on June 19 prison  
guards, National Guard and  
police officers, numbering over  
200, ended the sit-in by violence  
and by brutalizing the inmates.  
The guards, in attempting to  
force the women into the gym,  
engaged in beatings, arm  
twisting, shoving and generally  
physically assaulting the inmates.  
A pregnant woman was  
pushed down and assaulted.  
One of the women had a seizure,  
and “when I tried to help her, the  

guards jumped on me,” an  
inmate said.  
The prison officials  

whitewashed the police action  
by convincing the media that the  
inmates themselves had rioted  
and attacked the police. One  
woman told us, “The only  
weapons we had were our  
minds.”

Ralph Edwards, head of the  
state's Dept. of Corrections,  
made a dramatic showing to the  
press to make it appear that the  
women had been armed. When  
the press was allowed in,  
Edwards went into a locked  
building and brought out bats,  
croquet mallets, broomsticks,  
pitchforks, and lined them up on  
the lawn to show to the press.

One woman said, “We yelled  
to the press that these were not  
our weapons. We also cleaned  
the grounds every night during  
the sit-in and kept the area neat.  
Then before the TV cameras  
came, we saw them (the prison  
officials) throw trash all over the  
place and put out the picks for  
the TV.”

The Aftermath

After the police had quelled  
the “riot,” the women were  
herded into buses, 40-50 per  
bus, where they were kept from  
11 p.m. until noon of the next  
day. The buses did not move nor  
were the women allowed off to  
use the bathroom or to eat. It  
was very hot and some women  
were sick; they were not allowed  
to leave the bus, even to vomit.  
The next day, the inmates  
were confined to the dorms. One  
woman said she was forced to  
undress in front of a male guard  
who threatened her, “If I ever  
see you again, I'll have  
something for you.” In  
particular, a man named Captain  
Barbour (“a bounty-hunter,”  
according to several inmates) is  
the focus of much of the  
women’s anger. “Hey, bitch, you  
come with me,” he is quoted as  
saying. The women said he  
indiscriminately picked who  
were the “leaders” and who  
would be sent where. The  
“troublemakers” were taken to  
Morganton Prison; the rest were  
confined to “lock-up” at WCC.  
Behavior Modification Torture  
We were unable to visit the 33  
“ring leaders” sent to Morgan-  
ton under the classification of  
“indefinite nonpunitive  
segregation.” Morganton is  

infamous as a Behavior  
Modification unit. The most  
rebellious and strongest  

prisoners are placed on the 16th  
floor, the top. There the prison  
officials try to break the  
prisoners’ unity and strength to  
resist by solitary confinement  
and drugs. As the prison ad-  
ministration forces prisoners to  
accept so-called “rehabilitation,”  
prisoners are moved down to the  
lower floors, one by one, a  
definite torture in itself.

The inmates in lock-up at WCC  
told us that the prison officials  
have attempted to cause dissen-  
sion among the women. They  
have punished women who  
have had nothing to do with the  
demonstration by putting them  
in lock-up. They have threatened  
others with repercussions if they  
associate with the disrupters.  
They are also threatening to take  
the women to court for any lack  
of cooperation of any kind.

Unwritten rules are being  
enforced only on those women  
who are in lock-up. “The rules  
are changed so many times that  
nobody knows what they are,”  
one woman told us. Many  
women have had their personal  
things taken from them and not  
returned; the guards say  
they were stolen. Visiting hours  
are cut to 30 minutes per week  
and only two people at a time  
may visit. This means that many  
women cannot see their  
children and get no visitors at all,  
since visitors are limited to  
members of their immediate  
family.

Cell C: Lock-up

Most of the women were in  
lock-up in Cell C when we visited  
them on July 31; others still  
remained in Morganton. The  
air was hot and stuffy inside,  
peeling institutional green paint  
on the walls, concrete floors,  
bars everywhere, ceiling to floor.  
There were four corridors of  
cells, each with about 8 very  
small, unlighted cells; each cell  
had four women in it. The  
inmates in Cell C are let out  
twice a week for 30 minutes.  
Most of these inmates received  
from 30 to 90 days in lock-up for  
“participating in a riot.” One  
inmate said that “the sisters  
have to go before the Central  
Classification Board in order to  
get out of lock-up. If they are  
willing to say they are sorry and  
sign a statement that they will  
not cause any more trouble, they  
may be let out, or they may not  
be. If they stand up for their  
rights in protesting the prison  
conditions, they not only do not  
get out of lock-up, they may get  
more time in it.” Another woman  

added, “When you go before the  
Board, they bring out everything  
that you or anyone in your family  
has ever done. All your past  
history and all past legal records.  
One woman was told, ‘Whatever  
it takes to get you in line, we will  
do; if we have to beat it in your  
head, we will!’ As one inmate  
put it, “The Board expects you to  
act like ass-kissers. Capt. Bar-  
bour in particular is giving us  
every bit of his ass to kiss.”  
Spirits Still High

The inmates still feel that their  
actions were justified. One  
woman told us, “I’m glad it  
happened, but not for the  
punishment we've been getting  
because of it. We were  
demonstrating for decent work-  
ing conditions and health care. It  
is pathetic the way things are  
around here. We need these  
things, and now people on the  
outside will find out about how it  
is in here.”

Another inmate said that the  
prison officials discourage them  

from talking among themselves  
about the demonstration. “Just  
yesterday,” one woman said,  
“the demonstration came up in  
conversation, and the matron  
said we'd better not talk about it  
—that it’s over now. They ask if  
we're corresponding with the  
women from Morganton. They  
don’t want us to, but they can't  
stop it.”  
Close the Laundry!

The main issues of the  
demonstrations had been the  
hazardous and back-breaking  
conditions in the prison laundry  
and the inadequate health care.  
The women not only washed the  
prison laundry, but their work  
load was quadrupled by dirty  
laundry from other institutions,  
particularly local hospitals. Con-  
taminated clothing had to be  
handled without gloves or other  
health-protective equipment.  
Conditions of extreme heat from  
the boilers (reaching over 130  
degrees), slippery floors, harsh  
detergents, and other health and  

safety hazards that in private  
industry would be regulated by  
labor laws, were allowed in this  
prison. Several women handling  
heavy carts (up to 175 lbs) on  
slippery floors had had their toes  
crushed and amputated, while  
detergent rashes were common  
and went untreated. One 72-  
year-old woman was forced to  
work there.

The other issue of the  
demonstration was the abusive  
health care. There is no doctor  
assigned to the women’s prison  
(over 425 inmates), and one  
woman told me that a  
veterinarian prescribed codeine  
for her. The prison administra-  
tion has redecorated the hospital  
(new curtains) since the sit-in,  
but the health care delivery  
remains the same. We were told  
by an inmate, “One woman here  
in lock-up has a great deal of  
trouble with her bowels, and has  
been able to have only three  
bowel movements in the past  
four weeks. She is supposed to  

be receiving enemas and oral  
medication regularly. Usually  
she does not get it. Sometimes  
she gets enemas in the hospital;  
often she gets nothing. She has  
asked to see a doctor, but her  
request has been ignored. She's  
in a lot of pain.”  
“They Tricked Her”

In addition, we were told that  
women who do not need it are  
given psychiatric drugs to calm  
them down. The women told us:  
“Often these are the most vocal  
women. One of the resistant  
women was taken to Dorothy Dix  
Mental Hospital without any  
prior notice to her. They tricked  
her into going. They took her out  
of lock-up with the idea that she  
was going somewhere on the  
prison grounds, and then they  
took her away.”

The inmates also want Morris  
Kea retired as prison  
superintendent, “because he  
was a human being and tried to  
help make it better at the  
prison.” Lewis Powell has been  

hired by the Dept. of Corrections  
as superintendent to replace  
Kea. The women spoke bitterly  
about Powell. “He does not treat  
us like women; he treats us like  
animals. He is not a man of  
justice . . . He might talk to us,  
then says he will be back, but he  
doesn't keep his word. . . Powell  
can’t swing his power around  
here like he did at the men’s  
prison. The women won't stand  
for it. For example, the guards at  
the men’s prison beat up and  
torture many of the younger  
boys, always hitting them with  
their sticks and fists. The women  
here won't put up with it. The  
guards here seem especially to  
pick on the women who have  
mental problems, twisting their  
arms, hitting them with their  
fists. It's a shame, but they know  
better than to hit on us.”  
“Like a Member of  
Your Family Gone”

Powell is also responsible for  
sending the “troublemakers” to  
Morganton. “We were close  
with them, could relate to  
them,” an inmate told me. “They  
were beautiful people, and that’s  
why they took them away. We  
miss them the most. It’s like a  
member of your family gone.”  
Another woman feels she is  
safer in lock-up because some of  
the inmates on the grounds are  
informers. “Now you have to be  
careful of what you say. It used  
to be you could have honest  
disagreements with people  
around here. Since Powell has  
been put in charge, you don't  
have the right to your own mind  
with other inmates or with the  
staff. The staff tells your friends  
you're a bad influence: it builds  
tension among the inmates and  
breaks up friendships.” She  
continued, “Powell's attitude is  
one of threats and reprimands.  
It's getting worse instead of  
better. He never encourages us,  
or gives us any kind of hope.  

I think he’s just a puppet  
anyway.”  
The women told us their  

spirits are high, even though the  
officials are trying to break them.  
“They will try anything to break  
us up. The guards show partiality  
to some of the white prisoners  
to split us up, but we still have  
our unity. (The prison population  
is 61% black.) We will struggle  
together until we have what we  
want. We don’t want the world  
on a silver platter. We want to be  
treated like grown women and  
human beings. It will take a long  
time, but we believe that we will  
win!”

written to Big Mama Rag in  
response to Linda Fowler's and  
Carol Lease’s interviews carried  
on in the prisons of North  
Carolina (see accompanying  
articles this issue).

What It Does to  
a Woman's Soul

Greetings,

Let me introduce myself. I am  
Thomasina Carter. Serving 3-5  
years here at CCCW. I have been  
here for two years. When I went  
to jail I was placed in Wake  
County Jail here in Raleigh. I  
spent many long days and hours  
there. It is the lowest jail I’ve  
heard of. Ten minute visits once  
a week. Some certain prisoners  
are deprived of phone calls. One  
square cinnamon roll for  
breakfast and one bologna  
sandwich for supper. Inmates  
wait five, seven and ten weeks  
for a trial because they can't  
make bail for it being so high.  
Their walls are grey, and all of its  
occupants grieve in some way. It  
made me wonder if what they  
(officials) say is really true of  
what it does to a woman's soul.
