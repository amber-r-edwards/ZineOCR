At A Turning Point In Our

This article is merely in-
tended to introduce the topic
of racism within the Women's
Movement to Kinesis readers.
We who call ourselves Third
World Women do so because
we are developing an analysis
of our oppression both as
women and as non-white women
in white society. We are
only beginning to speak...

lation to our feminist anal-
ysis. This is exemplified

by the way the women's move-
ment has turned inwards poli-
tically, an experience that
every women's liberation group
has had recently in this
country.

The issues I have mentioned
have been fundamental to our
lives and they still are.
However, we have omitted seem-
ingly broader issues such as
racism and class oppression
because they are not within
the experience of the major-
ity.

The North American women's
liberation movement as we
know it today evolved from a
myriad of political forces.
It stems from the women's
suffrage movement at the turn
of the century through the
sexual revolution of the mid-
sixties to the civil rights
movement and anti-war protes-
tations through conscious-
ness-raising groups of the
late sixties and early seven-
ties.

It has been more than ten
years since, and the face of
the women's liberation move-
ment has changed profoundly.

We have understood the need
to organize our struggle a-
round such issues as:

Our right to control our
own bodies, and our freedom
of choice on abortion.

Our right to meet and dis-
cuss strategies as autono-
mous groups apart from men.

Our right to union protec-
tion and equality in the
workplace.

Our right to free commun-
ity controlled child-care
facilities.

Our right to love whom we
choose.

Through these political
actions we have debated and
continue to debate such top-
ics as: 1) sexual politics;
2) reformist politics vs.
revolutionary politics; 3)
personal politics and 4) les-
bian separatism.

However, we have found
that within the last few
years, there has been some
political stagnation in re-
lation to our visibility.

We have to begin to recog-
nize the limitations we have
set up for ourselves both in
terms of analysis and in terms
of actions. We have drawn un-
necessary distinctions be-
tween groups who are organi-
zing around other issues and
the issues themselves. As a
result we are reticent to
take up those issues as our
own.

Our political action must
reflect the knowledge of our
political theory—and vice
versa. If we are to take up
the issues of racism and
class oppression, we must un-
derstand the links between
sex, race and class. We must
understand that the oppressor
is the same beast.

It is imperative to recog-
nize the fact that the women's
liberation movement as it ex-
ists today is limited by its
white, middle-class perspect-
ive.

My mother and father are
Chinese immigrants. My sister
and I spent our childhoods as
daughters of a Chinese laun-
dryman. We were ashamed of
that, we were ashamed of the
color of our skin, our fea-
tures, our culture and our
parents. We were ashamed of
our lives.

We felt the constant pain of
our visibility. Our only
chance to survive was by as-
similating, to become as white
as possible inside, in other
words, to make ourselves as
invisible as possible. Be-
cause I had this need to be
white, my politics were frag-
mented. Where did white, fem-
inist politics end and where
did the politics developed in
isolation begin?

I have finally broken from
that total isolation. I have

found other angry women who
have felt the pain of their
own histories as non-white
women in this society, and
are willing to channel their
energy toward political
change.

We understand through
women's groups that minority
voice is not necessarily an
articulation of personal prob-
lems. Similarly we must un-
derstand that non-white fem-
inists, or Third World women,
who choose to struggle in the
women's movement are not to be
treated as tokens on the
one hand, and heard only when
addressing the needs of the
white majority on the other.

We, who are non-white fem-
inists, have been unable to
put forward a perspective that
speaks from our own experien-
ces because of our "need" to
fit the white stereotypes.
Now is the time for Third
World women to demand recog-
nition for our lives and ad-
dress the politics of the
women's movement from our
separate Third World consc-
iousness.

For just as women came to
understand their personal
power and ability to change
their lives through the con-
sciousness-raising groups of
the sixties, we will find sim-
ilar though enhanced under-
standing both as women and as
Third World people.

We, non-white feminists,
have understood the lack of
privilege in our histories
and in our lives, and we are
powerful in our commitment to
overturn the gross imbalance
that exists.

For us as Third World women
here, it is absolutely es-
sential that we address class
as well as race, because most
of our predecessors who came
to live in developed count-
ries such as Canada, arrived
due to imperialism.

Our families left their in-
digenous countries to suit
the demands of colonial cap-
ital. They left their own
countries because of poverty
and famine, in order to sur-
vive.

Not only is it important for
non-white feminists to begin
to understand their double
oppression and define their
politics in light of their own
history, it is in the inter-
ests of white feminists to
confront their own racism.
The racism that continues to

Herstory

be embodied in the structure,
attitudes and politics of the
women’s movement as a whole.

White women must learn to
listen to the concerns of
Third World women, be aware of
their own attitudes against
Third World people, pursue the
knowledge of Third World cult-
ures and histories in order
to expand their own knowledge.
White people too often have
the psyche of the imperializ-
er, unable to give recogni-
tion to differences that are
valid and equal. White
privilege affects the whole
fabric of this society, and
this includes the women's
movement.

We are at a turning point
in the herstory of the
women's liberation movement.
We must move forward and not
be afraid to dialogue as
equals. If we can do this,
we will most certainly move
toward a women's liberation
movement that is truly rep-
resentative of all oppressed
women.

I love sincerity
love sincerity

Racists are most sincere

I hate their sincerity
it is ignorant sincerity
it is selfish sincerity

Racists show their sincerity
in many clear and obvious ways

Make no mistake about this

Cracked up on a
sidelong glance

Riding low, to
escape a high blow

Frenzied heart
Creeping noise

Racists, no integration
a face for each category
they are never sorry

They're riding high today, and
riding high tomorrow.
