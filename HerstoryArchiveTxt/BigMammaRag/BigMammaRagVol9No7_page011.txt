Working In New Ways

that competence, like "pro-
fessional", is not a term pre-
cise enough to be useful. She
also said that it looked like
women were jumping angrily
to the conclusion that all
complex questions could have
been answered if the book-
keeper had been doing her ‘job.
That the difficulty of trying
to adjust traditional tools
to a non-traditional work-
place, and the months of fru-
stration with the business
manager's personality were
ignited by the bookkeeper's
admission of errors. Most
women at this point turned on
RJ, saying she had invalida-
ted their feelings (her feel-
ings implicitly illegitimate;
one wonders what to do with
feelings in conflict in the
feminist community). Finally,
the business manager said,
"I'll resign, if that's what
you want." No one said a
word. 

After she left the room,
women became angry that she
was gone, insisted that she
return, that it had been "pas-
sive-aggressive" for her to
leave. When she did return,
verbal assaults continued. RJ
wondered later, as long as

it was obvious there was to
be no attempt to work things
out, what purpose was served
by demanding the continued
presence of the business man-
ager. RJ remembered having
read that, if we can't work
with someone, we should comm-
unicate that as lovingly as
possible. The meeting faded
away at last, ten minutes be-
fore an abortion clinic was
scheduled to begin. Many of
the meeting principals work-
ed together in a superficial
cheeriness for nine hours,
having stuffed their inten-
se feelings inside. It was-

n't until after RJ got home
that night that all the
violence she had absorbed
so many hours earlier was
released, as her body shook
with sobs.

The next week more details
of more failed bookkeeping
surfaced. RJ, who was still
frightened by the spectacle
of seeing someone over 40
lose her income, without
even the use of clinic grie-
vance procedures (no evalua-
tion criteria even existed
for this new job), mounted
an unpopular campaign for
severance pay. She was re-
minded that the business
manager had, after all,
signed, rather than been
fired. People also said that
she did not "deserve" sev-
erance pay. (There was con-
tinual blurring of the sep-
arate identities of the bus-
iness manager and bookkeeper,
so that complaints alleged
against one were used as an
excuse to punish the other).
Others said, "the 'Pig' pays
severance." RJ wondered how
such caring women could be
so punitive, no matter what
the circumstances. (The bookkeeper, who had al-
legedly made the mistakes,
had given notice and herself
suffered no such unpredicted
income loss.) Some stated
that RJ had been "manipulated"
into "rescuing" the business
manager. Women loudly ascribed
all financial frustrations
to what they believed was the
intentional subversion of the
clinic by the former business
manager. Those few, who, by
their silence, appeared to
disagree, were pressured into
explaining their silence. The
atmosphere seemed intolerant of

dissent. Some privately told
RJ that they wanted to vote
for severance pay, but were
afraid to do so.

RJ, trying to sort the mass
of confusion threads into
some kind of coherence, felt
weary. She remembered the
dishonest silence following
the business manager's offer
of resignation. She also re-
alized that, to those who had
repressed questions, and ev-
entually rage, because of
the business manager's poten-
tially explosive manner, the
violence of the severance
scene must have seemed "just"
on some emotional level. It
was tempting simply to dust
off her resume, and see if
she could still get a job
"with the state."

Pessimists will say this is,
indeed, the end of the story.
At last it has been proved
that women cannot work to-
gether, cannot overcome our
socialization. And that "al-
ternative" structures must
be confined to small, pre-
ferably, non-income-produc-
ing groups.

The pain comes, as one wo-
man put it, that we, who
agree so totally on so many
things, cannot agree on what
happened, much less, on what
to do about it. In this

story everyone is right; the
kernel of truth exists every-
where.

The mosaic, which is the
feminist community in a small
town, may contribute to the
confusion and intensity. Some
speculate that relationships
between some of the princi-
pals, before they ever became
associated with the clinic,
adversely influenced the sit-
uation. However, the counsel-

from page 15

ling coordinator, who, like
the business manager, seemed
a lightning rod for conflict
had come from another state;
entered the situation a total
stranger.

At this point it seems
that optimists are left with
trying to answer questions:
Are issue-dichotomizing and
scapegoating inevitable
group dynamics? What do we
mean by "trust" in the
feminist community, and is
it earned, or assumed until
proved otherwise? Does the
use of consensus, and our
need for trust, prompt an
intolerance of dissent? In
addition, do these values
unwittingly prompt us to gra-
vitate toward working with
people defined as "like us",
so that we may be as confor-
mist in our hiring policies
as I.B.M.? What is the role
of personal style and friend-
ship in group dynamics, and,
if we want to minimize its
importance, how can we do
that?

It seems important for all
of us to tell these stories,
as accurately as possible.
Perhaps women elsewhere, not
as personally connected to
the details, can see lessons
that we are too involved to
see. Perhaps we can all
learn from one another's
experiences.

We, who are trying to sim-
ultaneously operate a
health center and create
new ways of working together,
certainly have our work cut
out for us! And those of us
who can't seem to find a
way to even get a "vacation"
from, much less avoid alto-
gether, these struggles,
may find it heroic to mere-
ly "keep on keeping on!"

MS. from page 11

--M.S. Magazine is filled
with advertisements about
tampons, safe pads, condoms.
One ad says, "There are a
great many women buying con-
doms--like our Conceptrol
Shields--and often it's be-
cause their doctors advised
them to switch to this meth-

ody

--It makes me sick.

Because it's paid for, via ad-
vertising, by the very compa-
nies which exploit women to
the fullest, the companies
which reinforce the dangerous
myths which act against women
i.e. by referring to bleeding
as moisture loss, increased
wetness, by selling unsafe
menstruation aids, which ne-

ver refer to blood, but talk
of "possible stains", and
those “heavy days"!

--because it goes under the
guise of women's liberation,
when in effect it only serves
to increase and bolster wo-
men's subjugation to a capi-
talist system which rapes and
exploits women daily.

--I won't buy it again. But
how do I explain my decision
to a woman who is only just
learning about the liberation
of herself and other women,
and who thinks M.S. Magazine
is the best thing she's come
across, since she went on the
pill?

RIFT from page 23

We are left with the feel-
ing that these women's lives
have been radically changed
through their experience.
Their fantasies (of becoming
a rock star, talk show host,
jet setter) may not come
true, but they will be more
willing to stand up for
themselves and each other,
knowing that the "system" is
certainly not going to help
them out, or even try to
accommodate them.
