Through A Class

Darkly

Sandia

The core of all that has been
theoretized about class comes
down to this: the standard in
America revolves around what
is male and young and white
and middle - upper-class. Any
deviation from that ingrained,
mediated standard is sus-
pect. Any judging on that
basis is classist. Any pun-
ishment (mental, physical,
sexual, spiritual) is caste. Any
counter action to that norm--
any word, gesture, thought,
institutional change -- is
freedom. The one most
powerful counter is to change
the very ways we PERCEIVE
that norm: MEDIA.

With no apologies to
McLuhan, I would like to carry
his theories one step further
than he took them. Media are
extensions of our bodies
according to him (i.e. the car
is an extension of our feet, the
telephone an extension of our
mouth and ears, the computer
our brain). More important,
media are not just extensions
of reality, they have become
reality itself.

Since the moon flights,
simulation (models of reality)
has become a familiar con-
cept. We watched a simula-
tion of the moon walks and
landings on TV -- reality
twice removed. Football re-
plays are simulations of a sort
and many people prefer
watching the game on TV to
the in-person event. At a
Three Dog Night concert,
people seated way the hell out
from the stage watched the
performance on TV sets.
Once, at Yellowstone National
Park, I watched a man taking
pictures of Old Faithful. He
never looked at the geyser
through the lens of his own
eyes. When the spouting had
died away, he turned to his
family with his Polaroid shots
saying, “Here it is.” The
pictures were for him more an
actual reality than the natural
phenomenon itself. In a
cartoon I read many years
ago, two children are in a car
that has a flat tire. It is
raining, and they are ques-
tioning their father who is
frantically trying to change
the tire. His response, the
caption, reads: “But I can’t
change the channel. This is
reality.” Indeed, reality de-
pends on what channel we are
on.

Does all this seem a bit

removed from the issue of
class? Rethink the looking
glass. TV and Hollywood,
papers and records, books,
and radio, etc. have become
the glasses through which we
look to ascertain reality. Yet
all of them can project an
image that is seemingly real
and false in the truest sense.

Ads are what people usually
focus their criticism on
because they are more obvi-
ous culprits, fostering an
unreal sense of wants and
needs and idealizations. We
know we don’t all fit the
beautiful people in the ads.
Ads for sure are classist in
that they define who is in and
who is out. But ads are part of
content. I am talking about
the very style of media for it is
the nature of their structure
that has become the pseudo
reality. TV exists even if you
never watch it. If you stop
here and argue over content,
and many analyses of media
do, you will end up at the
usual battlefront where the
war against class cannot be
won. You will demand that
women have more power and
prominence in media: You
will demand more Barbara
Walters, more Gloria Stein-
ems. More shows for women,
more women--or minorities--
in ads (remember how a few
years ago a Black in an ad was
obvious tokenism and now it’s
so commonplace that Blacks
themselves are putting out
their own ads of middle-class
Blacks). Cooptation. IBM
knows where it's at. An ad of
theirs reads: IBM, NOT JUST
DATA: REALITY.

Plato’s parable about the
Empyrean cave reads very
much like a multi-media light
show. Humans are chained in
the cave, legs and necks
fettered. They remain in the
same spot, able to look
forward only. A fire burns
behind them, casting sha-
dows on the wall of the cave in
front of them. All they can see
of reality is its reflection. Very
much like this, TV is a
reflection of images--all me-
dia are. Only now we can’t tell
the front from the back,
Nature from the simulation,
butter from margarine (it’s not
nice to fool Mother Nature),
man from mediaized man. It is
clear who is chained, but
most of us are still arguing
that the projectionist be

We didn’t have trouble defining a woman's culture
You had trouble understanding it.

A Woman’s Culture. A Woman's civilization.

A world where women can walk the streets without fear of being raped
because they are hated for being women.
A world where war doesn’t rip the earth apart in 100 different places
every year because the men are busy playing with their army trucks.
A world without obscene telephone callers.
A world where people don’t go to prison because they're poor and
their name isn’t Richard Nixon.

A whole world.

changed or liable to equal
opportunity employment.

We have confused our
benchmarks for reality. Hu-
mankind should be the mea-
sure of all things, as indeed
the Renaissance claimed. But
we are measured by our
shadows; our extensions are
our reflections (car, home,
job, TV, etc.).

Trying to see only in the
reflection is where class
enters. For when reality is a
by-product of perception, then
she who controls the looking
glass and appraises the
extension has power--and
class. We are talking about
equivalents of human beings
in the sense of property and
solely on a material level.
What we need changed is an
essential equation. Mankind
is actually an extension
of himself. We are the Godhead
manifested, God realized in
object form. But we, the
physical equivalents of spir-
it -- rather than remerging --
move right as it were
objectifying ourselves even
further:

manifested
GOD = Man = MEDIA
MANifested

Reality encompasses all parts
of this metaphysical, organic
process. We have somehow
evolved to a point where
perception of reality is more
mechanical and dependent on
media rather than taking in the
whole process.

In such a mediaized object
society, it is easy to see how
women have become one
more object or extension of
men. We have developed a
right-sided perception that
moves from man to exten-
sions of man, rather than a
total vision which sees hu-
mans in an equation with the
one, the Ultimate. Women
because they have the innate
capacity to duplicate them-
selves, don’t have to objectify
themselves. Men, because
they cannot, mirror them-
selves in these extensions. They do it rationally, not
bodily, moving more and more
external, away from an inner,
subjective realization of him-
self and reality.

Moving left through that
equation means crawling out
of the cave, not just changing
the projectionist. The cave
metaphor has become like a

A real world that could be run on the values of women in touch with
ourselves and our power as women.
But power scares you because you only know one way to use it

and that’s your Way.
So you're afraid
of us together.

Afraid that you will be shot in the back.
Afraid that you will be ridiculed daily.

Afraid that you will have to scramble for someone's supper.

Afraid that you will be murdered with a broomhandle.
And yes right now we are unreasonable.

We are so unreasonable.
We are so perfectly

WIT House

Kim Branscombe

“There is no women’s movement in Denver.” She spoke
bitterly, as one does who has paid her dues and is weary of
promises made but unkept, issues debated but never resolved.

“But what about N.O.W.?,” I said, “What about YWCA?
There’s Big Mama Rag and C.R. groups and the Rape Coalition
and....”

“Intellectualizing. Words and Ideas, consciousness-raising
is done by and for middle-class white Feminists. What is there in
Denver for working women? For someone like me--a divorced,
working mother of four? What help--real, concrete help--is there?
None,” she said firmly. I pulled my trump card.

“What about,” I cried triumphantly, “Women in Transition
House?”

“Oh, that place. I bet about half of the women that stay
there have other places to go. They don’t really need to be there.”

“Well, listen. I've spent some time at that house. I’ve seen
that they do refer women to doctors or lawyers or whoever can
help them. And I’m moving in there because I believe that they are

helping women and that’s what I want to do.”

That is the general gist of a
conversation I had three
months ago with the mother
of a friend of mine. Since
then, I have moved into WIT
House and staffed it, some-
times with other women,
sometimes alone. I have seen
five staffers burn out and
leave, and seen about 150
transient women and children
come and go this summer. I've
learned a lot about women,
politics, myself, and the
welfare department-- and I've
found that the situation for
Denver women, though far
from ideal, is still not quite as
bleak as my friend's mother
said it was.

There is limited help availa-

ble for working women, and

divorced mothers. Emergency
food can be obtained through
the Food Stamp Department,
Salvation Army, and a few
churches and community ac-
tion centers. With alimony or
custody hassles, they may be
able to get free or cheap legal
help. Legal Aid will not handle
the actual divorce. The NOW
office, Big Mama Rag, WIT
House and the YWCA re-
source center have lists of
women and men lawyers that
sometimes take cases with
little or no fee.

If these women need
counseling and moral sup-
port, WIT House, Gilpin

House, Creative Divorce and
many individual therapists
counsel women or refer them
to someone who can give
them competent, sympathetic
help.

Warren Village, an apart-
ment complex, provides day
care for its resident single-
parent families.

If she is gay, there are
Lesbian counselors and
groups in Denver. A national
Lesbian Mothers Defense
Fund is forming.

If she is Chicana and on
welfare, there is a community-
based help organization for
her (See July issue of Big
Mama Rag.)

Denver General Hospital
and Children's Hospital pro-
vide free health care for
low-income mothers and
children.

If she has been raped, and
needs legal advice, moral
support, etc., she can contact
any of the groups listed in the
August “Rape” issue of Big
Mama Rag.

So on the positive side
there are individuals and
organizations that give time
and energy to help women.
Most of them are understaffed
and underfunded, or require a
lot of form-filling and hassling
with red tape, but they are
there if needed.

However, if a divorced
working mother is being

discriminated against in her
job, needs a bank loan or is
having trouble getting credit--
then she'd better get used to
her situation because, as my
friend’s mother said, there is
nothing. She can go to the
Civil Rights Commission. She
can hire a lawyer if she can
afford one or go to Legal Aid
and hope they take her case.
She can go to the American
Civil Liberties Union; and if
they are going to get a lot of
publicity and are pretty sure
they'll win the case, they may
help her. The last I heard of
Esther Goodyear, she is still
trying to get money together
for a lawyer in her three-year-
old anti-discrimination suit
against Gates Rubber Com-
pany.

This important area is
where Denver women’s
groups are weakest. There is
no powerful, united women’s
group to help with class
action suits. If I am wrong,
please call at WIT House and
tell me, because we get three
or four calls a day from
frustrated, angry women who
are being discriminated a-
gainst.

And if this hypothetical
mother of four is crazy, she
and everyone around her had
better get used to that, too.
There is counseling and
day-care therapy available for
women who are still function-
ing in the community. But the
halfway houses and hospitals
are either expensive or have a
long waiting list. When she
attempts suicide or seriously
hurts someone, then she may
be hospitalized. She may also
have a hard time getting out if
she gets well. Denver's care
for mental patients of any sex
is hideously inadequate.

So much for the traditional
resources that Denver women
have. Enter Women In Transi-
tion House. Yes, good old
much-maligned, crisis-ridden,
understaffed and underfunded
WIT House. For those who
have never heard of it, the
house offers temporary shel-
ter and food for women and
children who are going
through a transition. This may
mean a change of lifestyle,
mental or physical changes.
The staff women make refer-
rals for counseling, food help,
legal help, etc., and do some
non-professional counseling
on their own. The house is
defined as a “safe place” so
women make a contract when
they come in ‘not to harm
themselves or anyone else.
When they break this con-
tract, they are asked to leave.
