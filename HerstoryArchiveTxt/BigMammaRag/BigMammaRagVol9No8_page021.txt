2nd Wave Feminist Meets New Wave Music

"I don’t give a damn about
my reputation..."

/ Joan Jett,
"Bad Reputation"

And furthermore, I am sick
to death of analyzing, justi-
fying, and being frozen into
reconciling all the contra-
dictions. So I might as well
accept the fact that to a
lot of women I am a heretic,
or am uninteresting; and so
I'll get on with it:

In a recent story in Gay
Community News, a woman named
Aubergine Green Field "con-
fessed" her involvement in
and preference for punk and
new wave music. I was reliev-
ed to read her honest affirm-
ation of the music, culture,
and politics that for the
past two years have become
an integral part of my life.
She put into words what I had
not yet been able to articu-
late.

Like Green Field, I have
been a closet punk, afraid to
share my developing tastes
with the women I once attend-
ed Chris Williamson and Meg
Christian concerts with. My
first women-only event was,
in many ways, the highlight
of coming out. The atmosphere
in the hall was intense, ex-
hilarating; and I went home
resolved to purge my record
collection of all male influ-
ence, and to buy every "fem-
inist" album available. I
look back at that period of
my life as very necessary,
as an important experience
with separatism and a time to
define myself outside of het-
erosexist society.

But, I wasn't very politic-
al at that point. In fact, I
went to great lengths to a-
void politics and instead in-
volved myself with myself -

I "worked on" a relationship,
got into feminist therapy,
studied women's art, and list-
ened to women's music. Work
seemed a kind of necessary
nuisance, and I was miles a-
way from a working class con-
sciousness. Somewhere, I con-
vinced myself that I could
live outside oppression -
after all, I saw women loving
women (or seeming to at any
rate); I saw women creating
their own businesses and
their own culture, and then
bringing these together (con-

sider the "liberating alter-
natives" of recording compan-
ies like Olivia and Redwood,
presses like Daughters and
Diana, etc., etc.)

When I first got involved
with BMR, I was a belligerent
babe in the woods. Still
seeing a therapist who en-
couraged me to demand re-
wards, I had a lot of unreal-
istic and politically rotten
expectations - and I resist-
ed the implications of those
expectations for almost a
year. But at the same time,
I began to perceive clouds
on the horizon of ideal
women's culture. For one
thing, I was beginning to
struggle at work - women's
music didn't answer my ques-
tions, and I began to real-
ize that I could not escape
into the idyllic world of
independent small business.
I also realized that I did
not even like the women I
held as role models - those
who had made it in both the
man's - and the woman's -
world. I knew I did not have
much in common with them,
but I was still not sure why.

But most devastating at
this time was that most as-
pects of women's culture
were beginning to fail me.

I was no longer getting

high from hearing the same
sweet voices, reading varia-
tions on the same plots, and
seeing the same basic images.
I stopped going to concerts,
stopped reading publications
like Chrysalis, and stopped
searching for real feminist
art. And for the first time
since getting into therapy,

I got angry again - I had
not grown out of my “angry
stage" like I was supposed to
have. At once, I began to
accept my identity as a work-
ing class woman - and I be-
gan the long process of
fighting back.

It was about this time that
I became aware of new wave
music. At first, I, along
with my lover, approached
this unfamiliar culture
gingerly, almost guiltily,
like we were somehow betray-
ing our roots. I remember
buying the Marianne Faith-
full album "Broken English"-
we listened to two tracks,
were horrified as well as
fascinated, and ended up

Singer Joan Jett.

not listening to the rest
for weeks. Later, we'd

stand in a record store de-
bating an album, and often
buying it sound unheard (new
wave and punk music has ne-
ver gotten much airplay in
the U.S., especially in
backwards Denver, so most
every purchase is a calcula-
ted risk). But as our collec-
tion and our knowledge in-
creased, we got hooked. Our
new wave section greatly
outnumbers our women's re-
cords, something I would
never have expected five
years ago.

In many ways, it is eas-
ier to say what I like about
this music than it is for
me to describe the ways it
is shaping my life and my
art. Women musicians in our
collection range from Faith-
full, to Chrissie Hynde of
The Pretenders, to Wendy O.
Williams of The Plasmatics,
to Siouxsie Sioux of Sioux-
sie and the Banshees, to
the Raincoats - all of them
very different, but also
very similar. The words and
the voices of these women
are angry and strong and
raw; I hear a vitality in
them that I never heard in
any of our cultural stars.

I doubt if any of these
musicians would call herself
a feminist, but that does

not seem as important to me
as it used to because much
of this music is feminist
in the truest sense of the
word.

It is also working class-
and for me that is the most
significant difference. I
am more affirmed as I lis-
ten to Marianne Faithfull's
version of "Working Class
Hero" than I am as I hear
Holly Near sing about a
working class bar - the
two don't even connect for
me. Faithfull has been
called a "survivor", a label
she dislikes; but her voice
is scarred, powerful, exper-
ienced. She is a hell of
a lot more convincing than
Near, who seems pale, pro-
tected, even privileged in
comparison. Faithfull, along
with women like Hynde, Sioux
and Williams, have defined
themselves within and in
spite of society, the so-
ciety that so many of us in
the women's movement have
tried to redefine for our
own uses.

As important as women in
new wave are to me, I have
to admit that so are many
of the men. I am not talk-
ing about college educated
basement bands for whom punk
has proven a handy escape
from boredom; but I am re-
