FEMINIST CALENDAR

The Woman to Woman Feminist School will be back in action this fall. Input  
and suggestions are welcome. In the meantime, there will be a special summer  
school in July and August. Childcare will be provided and the fee for the  
classes and workshops will be on a sliding scale. Registration will take  

place the last two weeks of June at Woman to Woman.  

If the class is not filled  

the last week in June, you can register the first week in July.  

SELF-DEFENSE: This class will be taught by Carolyn Augosta and will include  
basic techniques and street fighting as well as the psychology of self-defense.  
Carolyn has been teaching self-defense classes throughout the city for over  

two years.  

BASIC CAR REPAIR: Car repair will be taught by Debbie Squires, who is currently  
an automechanic for the Denver Public Schools. If you have a car, bring it  
to the class to get it running in top shape. If you don't own your own car,  
Kathy Barriga was nice enough to offer her car for the class to work on.  
RUGBY: JoAnn Grosswieler, who will be heading up the class, started an informal  
rugby team earlier this year. Rugby is an English form of football, but  

you won't really know what it's all about until you try it.  

CONSCIOUSNESS RAISING: Basic consciousness raising is one of the factors which  
got the second wave of feminism on the move. CR provides an informal setting  
for women to get together to talk about their experiences as women in our  
society-- growing up female, marriage, education, self-hate and self-respect,  
mothers and/or daughters, lesbianism-- all the things that affect our lives.  
REVOLUTIONARY FEMINISM: Woman to Woman is trying to reach Janet Sergi to ask  
her to teach this class this summer since she did such a great job with it  
last year. Janet, if you're reading this, get in touch with the center.  
SOCIALISM AND FEMINISM: This class will be taught by Andrea Gabriel, a socialist/feminist  
author, who has been politically active in Denver.  

NON-SEXIST FOLK DANCING and SELF-HELP HEALTH will be among the various workshops  
that will also be offered this summer.
