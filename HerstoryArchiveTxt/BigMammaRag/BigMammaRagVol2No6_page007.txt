Some people think of Denver  
as a place to stop in between the  
West Coast and Chicago. But for  
most of us, Denver is our home,  
our work, and our interest.  
Consequently, and in keeping  
with the theme of this month’s  
issue, “The Women’s Movement  
in Colorado,” Big Mama Rag  
decided to seek out the ideas  
and feelings of local feminists.  
Exploring the personal and theo-  
retical issues of Feminism is a  
priority for the present Women’s  
Movement, and BMR hopes to  
provide a forum for a continuing  
exploration. We realize that the  
following opinions do not ex-  
press a true cross-section of the  
Feminist consciousness in Colo-  
rado, but offer it as a beginning,  
and plan to print articles similar  
to this one again in the future.  
The women interviewed in the  
following article have all been  
active in the Women’s Move-  
ment for several years, and  
identify themselves as Feminists.  
To simplify the process of  
reporting, we asked everyone  
the same three questions: 1)  
Explain who you are and what  
led to your involvement in the  
Women’s Movement; 2) Present-  
ly, how do your Feminist views  

and philosophy affect your life?  

(Job, school, ambitions, rela-  
tionships); and 3) What do you  
feel are the most significant  
future priorities for Feminists?

My first intellectual awareness  
of some of the issues of the  
Women’s Movement came in  
1963, when I read The Feminine  
Mystique. I considered it my  
Bible for several years, but had  
no one with whom to share it. I  
filed it away in my personality  
under “Anger.”  

In the Fall of 1969 a friend of  
mine, traveling from Boston to  
Washington, D.C., visited me for  
a weekend, and brought with  
her the Feminist writings of the  
Bread and Roses women’s group  
in Boston. These writings  
contained the beginnings of a  
real Feminist consciousness for  
me — concepts of sisterhood,  
and a woman’s culture, and  
relationships that were not  
power-structured. I was a public  
school teacher at the time, and,  
within a month, organized a CR  
group with the librarian at our  
school. For me, this was the real  
beginning. I had sisters.  

Being in New York, I had the  
opportunity to trail behind  
some radical groups, attending  
conferences, seminars, etc.,  
attentively, but at a safe  
non-threatening distance. After  
all, I had a family. Those women  
were free.  

I lived in Berkeley the  
following year, and spent a lot  
of time at the women’s center  
there. Again, I found warm,  
independent women. I was  
attracted by their strength, by  
their sense of beauty of  
themselves. One Friday night I  
was attending a meeting about  
Angela Davis at the women’s  
center. I was nine months  
pregnant at the time, and still  
believe the woman-force in that  
room awoke my sleepy baby.  

My labor began there, and my  
daughter was born the next day.  

In 1971 I moved to Denver  
and sought out a women’s group  
at once. I was welcomed into a  
CR group as if they'd all been  
waiting for me. We celebrated  
the joys of sisterhood. We  
taught each other what we  
knew. We drew, we painted, we  
sculpted, we photographed each  
other. We danced, we hugged,  
we sang. We believed we could  
do anything. We loved what  
made us different from men. We  
discovered the power of being  
women — of being women  
together. I am still in touch with  
most of these women, who now  
look back on that group  
experience as having been a  
“once-in-a-lifetime”  
life-changing event.  

Presently, my Feminist  
philosophy affects my life as  
follows: 1) I appreciate being a  
mother. I think it is my greatest  
life experience. 2) I am in  
process. I am still giving birth to  
myself. I have a lot to learn. 3) I  

can’t do everything. I had to  
join the forces of women  
asserting that I could do  
everything in order to do  
anything. Reality sets in  
quickly. I know I can’t do  
everything. Right now I want to  
study law and am pursuing that.  
I still can’t fix my car, I don’t  
know karate. I hate plumbing.  
But I don’t have to do any or all  
of those things at once. I can  
choose. I think women do a  
disservice to themselves and  
each other by claiming (for very  
long) that they can do  
everything. Assess situations  
realistically. Know what you can  
do and do it: Never lie to  
yourself. 4) I’ll fight for what I  
want. I'll protect myself and  
those I love. As Flo Kennedy  
says: “The time has come for  
kickin’ ass and takin’ names.”  

The most significant future  
priorities for Feminists? I’m not  
sure. What I see around me are  
women struggling for  
recognition, for personal  
satisfaction, for some real work.  
Men have called these issues  
“human” problems. I see them as  
women’s mandate. What can we  
really do collectively if we are  
half-baked individuals? Women  
must attend to themselves, but  
not only to themselves. The  
Women’s Movement can be, and  
I fear, will be co-opted (bought  
off). The flagrant injustices are  
likely to be ameliorated by the  
system's reforming itself. It is  
the responsibility of Feminists  
to see to it that Feminist  
Consciousness imposes itself on  
the world, as a Mother would  
impose her values on her family.  
Women in positions of  
leadership have a special  
responsibility in this regard —  
reform must not lull us to sleep.  
We must keep the country aware  
that we are not talking about  
reform as it has been defined  
before, or mere self-interest. We  
are talking about  
evolutionary-revolutionary  
changes in human consciousness  

— about sweeping political  
change, about values, about  
reversing priorities, about  

matriarchy. Obviously, there is  
little moral leadership in this  
country. Doing what one can  
and maintaining one’s integrity  
is no more essential than  
creating changes in  
consciousness, and being there  
when the times are right.  
Wherever you are.  

But, like when you're  
baking bread, there are things  
that can be done while you're  
waiting for the yeast to grow.  
For me, these priorities are: not  
backing down, keeping in touch  
with other women around the  
country and with what they're  

thinking, building solid  
relationships with many kinds of  
women, learning women's  
culture, and loving  
children.  

BONITA TRUMBLE  

I first became involved with  
the Women’s Movement in 1969  
when I attended the Second  
Annual Congress to Unite  
Women in New York City. I was  
already politically active in  
Philadelphia, but this new (to  
me) movement was obviously an  
answer to a lack in my life. The  
two women with whom I had  
attended the conference and I  
rushed back to Philadelphia. We  
called all of our women friends  
together to turn them on to  
what we had learned, and a CR  
group was born.  

Shortly thereafter, I learned  
of WITCH (Women’s  
International Terrorist  
Conspiracy from Hell), and this  
women’s group with its flair for  
theater and art, its positive  
emphasis on women’s values,  
and its unique sense of humor  
was clearly the way for me to  
express myself. Through the  

help of Robin Morgan, I  
organized a chapter of WITCH  
in Philadelphia. These two  

activities culminated in the first  
Women’s Conference held in the  
Philadelphia area. It was held in  
March of 1970 and was attended  
by over 300 women.  

I came to Denver in the Fall  
of 1971, and during 1972 I was  
the Associate Producer of  
“Anatomy of Woman” at  
KRMA-TV. This ten-week series  
took a look at today’s woman,  
her life, and the issues  
confronting her.  

I am currently the director of  
Sebastian House, an alternative  
school for young people aged  
0-18. I feel that working with  
young people is a viable way of  
effecting change in society.  

Obviously, a first priority is  
the passage of the Equal Rights  
Amendment. It is absurd in this  
day and age, in this country (or  
any country) that equal rights  
should be denied to anyone.  
Second, women must begin to  
make paths into all kinds of  
previously male-dominated areas  
- medicine, law, politics, the  
arts, science, government, etc. It  
is especially important for those  
of us working with youth to  
urge bright young females as  
well as males into these areas.  
Third, and maybe most  
important, Feminists must begin  
to take their role as women  
seriously. For a long time we  
have felt that we must gain the  

Big Mama Rag Vol. 2 No. 6  

male concept of power in order  
to succeed. We won't change  
things by becoming the  
aggressors - by perpetuating the  
power trip of one group of  
people over another. Now is the  
time for the true nature of  
woman, the real basis of the  
strength women have always had  
to come forth. A first step is to  
ask ourselves What is  
essentially woman? Is it  
patience? Understanding?  
Love? Armed with answers to  
this basic question, we will  
understand ourselves better, and  
this understanding will enable us  
to make better use of our  
strengths. The Women's  
Movement has already had a  
tremendous impact on this  
country and we’ve only just  
begun!  

I am employed by the State  
of Colorado as Supervisor of  
Case Handling and Investigations  
for the Colorado Civil Rights  
Commission. The commission  
enforces laws which prohibit  
discrimination in employment,  
housing and places of public  
accommodation based on race,  
creed, color, sex, national origin  
and ancestry and, in the case of  
housing, marital status and  
religion. I have been with the  
commission almost nine years,  
and have seen its development  
from no involvement with sex  
discrimination cases to one of  
such cases presently constituting  
one-third of its case load.  

I am a Charter Member of the  
Denver branch of the National  
Organization for Women and  
have attended two of its  
national conferences. I have  
been Employment Task Force  
Chairperson and have made  
many public appearances, either  
for NOW or for the Civil Rights  
Commission, speaking on  
Women and Employment.  

I have been concerned with  
all forms of discrimination most  
of my life. I was an active  
member of American  
Association of University  
Women in California and in  
Boulder for many years. Just  
prior to joining the Civil Rights  
Commission, I took graduate  
work in social psychology at  
CU, where I conducted research  
relating women’s roles to  
personal values and child-rearing  
attitudes. This work led me to  
some in-depth investigation of  
women’s roles, problems, and  
developmental stages - thinking  
that was a forerunner of the  
present Women’s Movement.  

Fortunately my views are  
most relevant to my job. I find  

that I was brainwashed  
concerning behavior towards  
supervisors, but my Feminist  

philosophies are helping that  
problem. I have always insisted  
that I had rights - hence I went
