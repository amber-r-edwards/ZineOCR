Sisters Reach Out

$6 for a tee-shirt than to
pay $2 to read the words of
sisters in prison. So we need
to update our mailing list
and ask anyone who wrote and
didn't receive it, please wo-
uld you write us again so we
can know the current address-
es. We've set up an office in
our apartment, we've had to
move 4 times in the past year
due to slum lords and legal
battles, but we are getting
it together and hope to do
another smaller booklet this
year, hopefully on a more re-
gular basis. Also, we want to
have an Ex-Prisoner's and
Poor People's Conference, we'-
re aiming for the fall, and
ask that sisters share with
us their ideas for what we
can be dealing with at that
conference...workshop ideas,
strategy for our survival in-
side and outside the walls.
That is what we will organize
the conference around. Moving

attempted to organize their own
group, Hui O' Wahine, in an
effort to secure equal access
to recreation facilities and
prison worklines (they were
told to see a lawyer).

At this time, with a rep-
ressive and brutal new pris-
on administration in control,
and the public mood lodged
comfortably in the "get tough"
solution to crime, it is es-
pecially important for femin-
ists to rediscover their si-
sterhood with these women.
The most direct victims of
institutional sexism, these
women have taken the brunt
of the economic hard times.
Here in Hawaii, the number of
incarcerated women is grow-
ing, and last Christmas, a
woman hung herself in the po-
lice cell block after having
been arrested for stealing
food. The link between the
suffering of these women and
the situation of their sist-
ers must not be forgotten for
the oppression of the most vi-
ctimized and least powerful
segment of the women's com-
munity is ultimately an oppre-
ssion of all. There is, in
short, much truth to the old
feminist rallying cry, Free
Our Sisters, Free Ourselves--
and women forget this at their
peril.

like for her being home one
year and the new directions
in her life, but right now
she has a serious illness due
to the bad treatment she got
in prison and is in the hos-
pital. Letters of support to
her can be sent to our add-
ress. Last year she also pub-
lished an 86-page book of her
writings and poetry while in
prison, which can be ordered
for $9.95. The biggest victory
came in the success of
her lawsuit against the pri-
son administration. As with
all the strong sisters inside,
the prison set out to break
her and when they couldn't,
tried to frame her. She was
writing articles about the
reality of prison that were
being published outside, so
she was framed for "inciting
to riot" and put in the hole
for 2 months, set up and har-
assed in every way possible.
She filed a suit on them in
79 and finally last year late
81 a summary judgment came
down in her favor, finding
that the prison had violated
her first amendment rights.
Even though they vowed never
to put out a cent in damages,
when they saw her determinat-
ion even after being free, the
state settled out of court.

to talk about the upcoming is-
sue more (since we are by then
worn out on the last one).
Still these meetings don't
seem to be very functional.
So, we have decided to do a-
way with a monthly structured
critique, and instead use the
community meetings (once every
six months) as critiques.
We'll have political discus-
sions about relevant topics,
talk about the direction of
the paper, etc. Hopefully,
this will be more functional
for everyone. We do though,
want immediate feedback when-
ever anyone has anything to
say, either in the form of a
letter, a phone call, or you
can show up to one of our
meetings (Monday evenings,
7:00). Try to call ahead so
we know to expect you. Please
call the BMR number, 322-2010
and leave a message rather
than calling us at home.

Have a good month!

But,

This is a precedent for the
sisters of Muncy and we re-
joice in each and every vict-
ory! We're hoping some women
will join with us this year
so we can get even more accom-
plished. We've heard from some
women who will be released
this year who want to join
with us, and a few women have
signed our sheets at worksh-
ops. Then we can answer let-
ters more regularly and keep on
the move! Anyone from outside
who wants to write to us, ple-
ase send a stamp if you can
for a reply, we really have a
hard time affording postage.
Any women who are doing this
kind of activity or want to
set up networks with us who
are in other parts of the co-
untry, please let us hear
from you. Sisters inside...we
love you and send our total
solidarity and commitment to
our fight! Please tell us wh-
at you think of our ideas,
share with us your ideas, let
us know what's happening. We
will do our best to respond
as soon as we can. We are sl-
ow, but we are here in full
force!

We appreciate any info about
what we're doing that you can
get out. Also you can use art-
icles and artwork from the

Calendar from page 20

booklet if you want, sisters
tell us to get the message
out any way we can. This ain't
really an article, but I wa-
nted to get these thoughts
down to you in some form, yo-
u'll be hearing more from us
as Moving Cloud gets stronger
and healed and we get some
things off the ground again.
I feel real good about the
copy we received that had the
BLA communique, I'm very hap-
py to know about you women
and a paper by women that's
not afraid to take a stand.
Reading the paper is gonna
help me get over, the times
I start to feel a little down
and isolated. The sisters of
No More Cages have given us
so much love and support, we
love them a lot. Knowing abo-
ut strong loving fighting
sisters is stone inspiration.
Our greetings to you and love
to all the sisters behind the
walls, the brothers who have
communicated support and com-
mitment to the sisters, and
all freedom fighters every-
where.
Love and struggle,
