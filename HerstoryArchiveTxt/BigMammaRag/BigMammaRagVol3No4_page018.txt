WIT House...

From Page 17

Each woman is expected and  
encouraged to clean up her  
messes and her children’s,  
and to take steps to solve her  
own problems.

But the house is definitely  
not just a haven for white  
middle-class feminists. One  
night in mid-August I took  
inventory of the women  
staying there:

One German - Kentuckian  
with three daughters

One Psychotic Jesus Freak  
in her 20's

An exotic dancer, 19 and  
one German shepherd

An ex-jailbird with two  
huge dogs

An alcoholic Sioux woman,

One 60-year-old derelict

A former alcoholic and  
mental patient

A radical lesbian with a  
sheepdog

A divorcee with a baby

A divorced woman with  
two children, hiding from her  
drunk husband

A former junkie and apart-  
ment manager

One newly-divorced 40-  
year-old waitress

A gay couple with one  
four-year-old child and two  
cats

One middle-class white  
feminist with a cat

That's a total of fifteen  
women, seven children, four  
dogs and three cats. Seven  
were on welfare or trying to  
be. Two were in physical  
danger. Eight had nowhere  
else to stay. Typically, 50% of  
the transients are hassling  
with the welfare department;  
20% are fleeing from brutal  
husbands or boyfriends; 20%  
are in non-crisis situations.  
This is defined as that they are  
crashing in town, or having  
some other place to stay but  
needing to be among a  
supportive group of women  
for a few days to straighten  
out their heads.

And, finally, there is the  
energy-draining 10% of wo-  
men who are alcoholics, drug  
addicts, rip-offs, or mentally  
disturbed. They are the main  
reason for high burn-out and  
rapid staff turnover.

Big Mama Rag Vol. 3 No. 4

The women on welfare are, I  
think genuinely helped by  
their stay at WIT. They at least  
get support and good advice  
and a roof over their heads  
while they hassle with the  
bureaucrats. The women run-  
ning from dangerous men  
have a frustrating way of  
sometimes returning to the  
same unchanged situation.  
Most of the time, however,  
they manage to leave town,  
get counseling, get a divorce,  
a restraining order, or whatev-  
er is necessary for safety.  
Maria came here, for example,  
with her two children. Her  
husband had been beating her  
up for most of the year. She  
was exhausted and fright-  
ened. She left her kids at her  
mother-in-law’s one day and  
her husband kidnapped them  
and took them to Texas. After  
a long time, spending $300 on  
a lawyer, and many disap-  
pointments she got them  
back. Then her husband was  
put on a restraining order and  
the house was locked up for  
three days. A place out of town  
was found for her and she  
finally was able to get money  
to fly herself and her children  
to a new city.

The women who come to  
get their heads together away  
from husband, family, etc. are  
also sometimes able to figure  
out alternatives to the roles,  
games, or lifestyle they are  
having trouble with. Again,  
this depends on the individual  
woman. The remaining 10%, I  
am sorry to say, are not likely  
to be helped much by WIT or  
any other agency. Often, they  
have been bounced around  
from agency to institution like  
a human tennis ball for most  
of their life, and all of the  
social workers, social psychi-  
atrists, counselors, rehabili-  
tation centers, reform  
schools, hospitals, and jails  
have only worsened the  
frustration, self-hatred, and  
despair that many of these  
women feel. Lucy had gone  
from institution to institution  
all of her life. She came here  
directly from jail, where she  
had been held on suspicion of  
robbery and released without  
charges. Her boyfriend was  
still in jail, her car was in  
hock, and her dogs were in the  
kennel at a charge of $12 a  
day. She was angry, hopeless  
and uptight about being here.  
She distrusted any attempts  

Through A Class Darkly

From Page 17

box that has restricted our  
vision on one inhibiting level  
of reality--a level that sees  
people as objects and not  
process.

Media in and of itself is  
classless; it is only a tool.  
Humans define the use of  
tools, and since that human  
has mostly been male, it has  
often meant that perceptions  
of women in history have not  
been her story. History, which  
is print media in its most  
ancient guise, has been a  
mirror in which women have  
either been missing or dis-  
torted. Yet history is western  
civilization’s basis for truth.  
Lesbians, in particular, have  
been seen through the glass  
darkly. Religious articles are  
still being written showing  
lesbians as pawns of the  
devil, though ironically the  
Biblical quotations are often  
attributed to Paul, as bitter a  
misogynist as ever lived.  
Writers from the Denver Post,  

in their role as present day  
historians, just recently took a  
wide angle lens at close range  
cleverly making four beautiful  
women seem like depraved  
outcasts. But if print media is  
our history, electronic media is  
our future. This fact is  
relevant to women of all  
classes. We all watch TV; we  
all go to the movies. But  
unless we are aware of the  
way media filters reality and  
fosters notions of class, we  
cannot begin to counteract it.

Both class and media  
overpower any attempts wo-  
men may make at self-defini-  
tion. If they begin to see class  
as one dehumanizing aspect  
of media, one more extension  
of male society, then class  
can be put in its proper  
perspective. When we keep  
seeing ourselves as objects, it  
becomes easier to align  
people into material levels of  
value. This is what has  

happened in a society which  
pays more attention to its  
objects and extensions rather  
than to its emotional and  
spiritual ties to life processes.  
Media used to view the world  
in such a distorted way are  
inferior products of an inferior  
process.

Women, then, must stop  
copying this male model. That  
means setting up a system of  
communications which de-  
fines people, and especially  
women, in terms of her  
spiritual being. Women need  
to kill the onus of class with a  
reflection of vision back to the  

One, for woman is the  
feminine principle made  
manifest, not media made  
manifest.

Separatism is a word used  
to scare us. But as it is  
obvious that women need to  
separate themselves from a  
system of economics where  
money becomes the definition  
of worth, it should be obvious  
that we also need to separate  
ourselves from the whole way  
our society has of looking at  

reality, especially when we  
sense we are restricted on one  
level of reality, and that, badly  
distorted in someone else’s  
image. Creating for ourselves  
an alternate media means  
insisting on reordering our  
levels of perception both as  
senders and receivers. We  
must devise verbs and pic-  
tures, newspapers and TV  
programs, philosophical es-  
says, radio--all media--that  
will speak for us in terms of  
our original relationship to  
matter. That creation is a  
return to that level of reality  
where class hierarchy is not  
possible, for it is a return to a  
person-to-person perspective  
that is not a function of media  
but of woman soul.

Sandia

mediaized = propagandized,  
mind-controlled, conditioned by media.

This idea is forcefully  
developed by Ti-Grace Atkin-  
son in her book Amazon  
Odyssey (New York, 1973)

to help her. Finally, she  
attacked and hurt two women.  
It became obvious at the end  
that she was mentally unbal-  
anced. When she hurt two  
women in an all-out psychotic  
“attack”, we tried to get her  
hospitalized. Denver General  
Hospital promised to take her,  
but then turned her out on the  
street. There was no other  
place for her to go and the last  
I heard, she was crashing with  
a man who periodically traded  
sex for shelter.

I have learned a lot from  
WIT House. I learned how  
responsibility can weigh like  
concrete on the shoulders.  
I've learned to shrug off that  
responsibility when it threat-  
ens to crush me to the  
ground. I’ve learned the  
limitations of the social  
service agencies. I have some  
inkling of what an awesome  
task it is going to be to topple  
this stifling, patriarchal bu-  
reaucracy. I can do a lot of  
household maintenance when  
I need to now. I can  
sometimes cool down a fight.  
I feel much more comfortable  
with my identity as a woman, a  
sexual, political, feeling,  
thinking, doing being. It still  
hurts to see the self-destruct-  
ive trips my sisters get into,  
but I also see them getting  
stronger, and so I can’t  
despair yet.

So I can say now, looking  
back on that conversation  
with my friend's mother, that  
she was too cynical and I was  
too naive. The women’s  
movement is far from being a  
powerful, cohesive force for  
change in Denver. We cannot  
yet throw down the bureau-  
cracies and crush the institu-  
tions that degrade and brutal-  
ize women and children. What  
we can do is provide alterna-  
tives to these institutions.  
Women are changing, in their  
roles, self-images, expecta-  
tions, and perceptions of  
society. WIT House, with all  
of its crises is still a good  
place to go through changes.
