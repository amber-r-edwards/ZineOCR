Recognizing The Real Terrorists Or

Reprinted from the Gay Community News, a Boston newspaper.

Susan Saxe

I am writing this article
in the wake of the recent
highly publicized Brinks robbery
involving people identified with
the Weather Underground and the
Black Liberation Army. I am
writing because I am alarmed at
the direction of the media
publicity and the implications
that a wide-ranging investigation
of dissident groups and
communities might have for
Lesbians and gay men in Boston.

When I was arrested, in 1975,
after 44 years as a fugitive,
investigations into my
whereabouts were used as an
excuse for harassment and
spying in Lesbian communities
in several cities. It was a
difficult and sometimes painful
time, and people were
unnecessarily hurt in ways that
could have been avoided if
the community had been better
prepared. Now is the time for
the Lesbian and gay community
in this area to be asking
ourselves how recent developments
might affect us, and what we
can be doing to protect ourselves.

In general, we know that the
political climate in the United
States has taken a turn for the
worse. Hostility and official
violence toward poor people,
women, people of color and
gays is on the rise. Cutbacks
in social programs spell untold
suffering for the disadvantaged.
Reaganomics will literally kill
people through starvation,
freezing and lack of medical
care. Meanwhile a rising tide of
right-wing terrorism threatens
us as well. The Klan and the
Nazis are on the march, burning,
bombing and murdering with little
fear of consequences. Street
violence and domestic violence
against gays and women has
increased explosively, and the
powers that be, as always, wink
and turn the other way.

DEFINING THE TERMS

We as persecuted people need
to be careful, as we follow
this case in the press, to
look behind the hype and the
government propaganda and ask
who the "terrorists" really are.
Why are the well-manicured men
who sit behind desks and ship
arms to foreign dictators not
labelled "terrorists"? Is the
"terrorist" the one who would
callously starve children, or
the one who would steal money
to feed them? (I think we can
safely assume that the money
from the Brinks robbery was
destined for something having to
do with relief, resistance or
both, and that it was a direct
reaction to the ongoing violence
of the system.) Reactive
violence aimed at the power
elite and their foot-soldiers
has to be viewed against the
backdrop of large scale,
officially sanctioned violence.
Before accepting the official
definitions and interpretations,
ask yourself who is defining
the terms, who is setting the
values, and whose interests are
being served.

One of the side effects of
the current media hype will
be to help the government
justify and carry out sweeping
witch hunts of the kind made
infamous in the 1950's. Events
like this robbery will be the
excuse, but the right has had
these plans waiting in the wings
for many years, and had been
busily readying them for
implementation since Reagan's
election last year. The real
motive of this or any witch
hunt will be to fragment,
disrupt, isolate and punish
anyone who the defenders of
the status quo and the right-wing
social planners see as social
undesirables or obstacles to
their political program for the
'80s and beyond. This is where
the events of the past weeks
may touch your life.

HARMLESS INFORMATION

As events unfold in the press,
a real possibility is emerging
that the Lesbian and gay
community could become a focal
point of FBI and police
undercover operations, or that
a grand jury could be called
that would subject members of
the community to witch trial
tactics. Jane Alpert, a former
radical and fugitive, who

What To Do When The F.B.I. Comes Calling

The FBI has a variety of come-ons:
sometimes friendly, sometimes
tough (as has been done a lot
in gay communities), they pretend
to be identified with voter
registration, the census or
credit bureau, or the long-lost
high school friend of a friend
of yours. Often they come in
pairs so if you do talk to them
one can corroborate in court the
other's story of what you said.
They sometimes use physical
disguises and dress in ways
intended to get you to drop
your guard. Or they use
interrogation tricks, such as
"We have information which tends
to implicate you in your
neighborhood bank robbery. If
you could answer a few questions,
I'm sure we can straighten things
out." This can easily lead to
you describing your activities,
whereabouts, and companions on
a certain date. Don't lose your
cool.

DON'T TALK TO THE FBI

A look at reasons people have
given for talking with FBI agents
and the repercussions of their
cooperation shows that the safest,
most defensible thing we can do
is to state immediately that we
do not wish to speak with FBI
agents and to close the door,
if open, in their faces.

PITFALL I: I'll talk now so they'll
leave me alone.

So far the opposite has been true.
The likelihood of continued
harassment greatly increases when
someone demonstrates a willingness
to talk to the FBI.

PITFALL II: I don't know anything
important anyway.

Keep in mind that the FBI is
engaged in massive information
gathering. Seemingly innocent
information--who was working at
a certain place at a certain time,
for example, or who a certain
person's friends are--helps
establish a data bank which,
serving as a guide for police
surveillance and infiltration,
can lead to further harassment
of individuals and questions.

PITFALL III: I won't tell them
anything they don't already know.
They may well lead you to think
they know more than they actually
do. In fact, they may be merely
guessing or testing unreliable
information or seeking to "legally"
substantiate information they have
gathered by illegal means.

PITFALL IV: I've got nothing to hide--
why not answer them?

Our innocence is to be assumed--
we don't have to prove it to anyone.
Those who have tried this approach
have found their answers severely
distorted, taken out of context,
and used against them.

PITFALL V: Why not try to find out
what they're after?

Getting information from a highly
trained agent requires considerable
skill. Don't try to outwit them
at their own game. Tell them to
leave immediately. They are trained
in interrogation techniques,
psychological trickery, all sorts
of ways to get you to talk.

PITFALL VI: I'll mix them up with
a bunch of lies.

Again you are risking having to
testify in court--and penalties
for perjury are worse than for
non-collaboration. There is no
law requiring us to talk to an
FBI agent--but it is a federal
crime to lie to them.

Learn from the mistakes of others--
the only safe response is a
refusal to talk to agents.

Guess Who's Knocking At Your Door

turned herself in in 1974,
has recently written a book
telling all about her sojourn
in the "underground." According
to press reports and interviews
she has given, the book identifies
Kathy Boudin and other fugitives
as having lived in Boston, and
states that Boudin had a woman
lover and was involved in feminist
politics.

The FBI has also announced
that it is intensifying its
search for Kathy Power, my
former lover and co-defendant
in a 1970 political bank robbery.
Past investigations into Kathy's
and my whereabouts have been the
excuse for literal invasions of
lesbian/feminist communities in
several cities. Hundreds of people
were questioned, and the search
turned into a fishing expedition
in which the FBI tried to find
out all it could about a community
that is ordinarily a mystery to
them. Even when it became apparent
that the search was only turning
up people who had no valuable
information about Kathy or me,
and whose only "crime" had been
their unknowing association with
us, the harassment went on.

Jane Alpert's vindictive,
irresponsible pronouncements have
subjected others in the past to
danger and persecution. Some of us
have been accusing her of being
an informer for years. Her defenders
insist that she has given only
harmless information about her
personal experiences. Unfortunately,
we are about to learn again that
there is no such thing as harmless
information. The government does
not need a whole lot of hard facts
to decide to embark on a fishing
expedition, and has never shown
particular concern for the "little
fish" who get scooped up in the
net.

You may know absolutely nothing
about radicals or fugitives, you
may be totally uninvolved with
leftist politics, you may have
barely opened your closet door,
but you may have once unknowingly
crossed paths with someone who
knew someone who knew someone who...
Lesbians and gay men in other
cities have been subpoenaed to
appear before investigative grand
juries based on their unknowing
association with the targets of
the investigation. They were
subjected to harassment,
intimidation and jailing when
they refused to answer questions
such as, "What is every meeting
you attended in the past two
years, and who else was there?"
or "Do you know so-and-so, and
what is her sexual orientation?"

When a widespread witch hunt
strikes a community that is
already a target for political
repression (and as the right wing
tightens its hold, that is more
and more the case for Lesbians
and gay men) everyone's danger
increases, just as everyone is
endangered by the rising tide of
unofficial violence (queer-bashing,
rape, etc.) aimed at us in
general. However, just as there
are things we can do to protect
ourselves from the physical
violence, there are things we
can do to shelter each other
from politically motivated
harassment.

KNOW YOUR RIGHTS

Other things we can do to protect
ourselves include being alert and
sharing information about missing
ID's, address books or other
papers that might be of interest
to the FBI (mailing lists, rosters,
etc.), questioning suspicious
events such as break-ins, noises
on the phone, people parked in
cars or taking pictures near
meeting or gathering spots, and
any other signs of spying or
intimidation. Share information
about suspicious events, even if
you think it is mere paranoia.
At the same time, watch out for
strangers hanging around the
community asking questions, and
avoid gossip or speculation that
could compromise other members
of the community.

An investigation in the Lesbian
and gay community is inevitable.
Communities that have hung together
and shut the door on government
intrusion have fared better in
the past than communities that
have caved in to the pressure.
If nobody talks it is harder to
single out and isolate individuals,
and improves the chance of nobody
being forced to talk or go to jail.
Plans for other grand jury
investigations have been successfully
stopped by a solid wall of resistance.
We can protect each other.

First of all, know your rights.
You do not have to talk to the
FBI. You do not even have to
open your door to them, and doing
so has in some cases been construed
as a consent to search. Keep in
mind that it is illegal to lie to
a federal agent, and it is a very
bad idea to try and outwit them.
They are trained interrogators,
and have many dirty tricks. FBI
agents have posed as reporters
and used other ploys to get people
to talk. Also, keep in mind that
the FBI now employs many women
agents. Agents may try to threaten
you or convince you that you have
nothing to fear if you have nothing
to hide. People who have fallen
for this line have later had their
answers taken out of context,
severely distorted and used against
them. You don't have to prove your
innocence to anyone. Also, experience
has shown that talking to agents
only increases the chance that they
will keep coming back for more.

Grand Jury Used Against Texas Groups

Edited from an article from Quash,
newspaper of the National Grand Jury
Project.

As a result of a clear-cut
violation of grand jury secrecy,
five Texas Chicanos were jailed
in August on charges of food
stamp fraud. Many charged that
the jailings were the result of
a classical use of the grand jury
for repressing political activities
and stifling grassroots organization.
The attack was leveled at two
Chicano community groups in
Muleshoe, Texas.

On June 22, the leaders of the
two groups, located in Bailey
County, were subpoenaed by the
state of Texas and ordered to
bring the groups' bank records
for the years 1979 and 1980.
The groups, Defensa and Chicanos
Unidos-Campesinos, Inc., had no
forewarning of the impending
subpoenas and pinpointed them
as a form of political harassment.
"The only changes that have been
made in this community on behalf
of poor people have been made by
Chicanos Unidos or by Defensa,"
says Juan Chavez, President of
Defensa and one of the two people
originally subpoenaed.

Defensa was organized in 1975
to aid seasonally-employed
agricultural workers and the
rural poor. The group has been
involved in setting up a rest
stop with cooking, bathing and
auto repair facilities for farm-
workers, in attempting to get
emergency broadcast notifications
aired in Spanish as well as
English, in sponsoring a summer
food service program for children
and in increasing the number of
eligible children in the school
lunch program.

Chicanos Unidos, whose president
is Alberto Daniel, began in 1970
as a response to the almost total
lack of basic community services
for the poor in and around
Muleshoe. It has established
food buying centers which sell
essential commodities to the
farmworking poor, conducted
bilingual seminars in six
counties to familiarize people
with the qualification guidelines
for food stamp eligibility and
set up a self-help mutual home
building project, among other
activities.

After the issuance of the subpoenas,
it was learned that the government
was looking for welfare fraud and
that it had, illegally, turned
the groups' records over to the
Texas Department of Human Resources.
The secrecy rules governing grand
jury investigations prohibit
subpoenaed material from being
