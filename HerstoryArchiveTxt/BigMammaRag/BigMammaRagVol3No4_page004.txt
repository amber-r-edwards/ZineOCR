Working Woman’s Account...

Poverty. I was literally driven
by my fears to achieve as high
a goal as I could set for
myself, and I knew from the
beginning that I would have to
do it alone. There would never
be money in our family for
college, yet it was my parents’
burning hope that each of us
would go.

In my head, if I did not go to
college, it would mean that I
would never have friends,
never make a decent living,
and there was a very real fear
of starving to death in
loneliness and disgrace. (The
thing about friends was really
interesting. I thought for
many years that the only way
I would ever have friends was if
somehow I could get money
to buy nice clothes and live in
a nice house. I thought having
friends meant that you had to
have money, because that was
the message I was getting
loud and clear. This associa-
tion got me into a lot of
trouble with myself and
others, because at those rare
times when I did have a little
money, I often used it to try to
“buy” friends, and it wasn’t
until I saw that I was getting
ripped off and used that I
knew it wasn’t just the money
that was power; it was
everything that came with
money, and again I knew I was
still on the losing end of it.)

Because no one had ever
helped me before, with money
or making friends, I simply
assumed that no one ever
would. I made self-reliance a
supreme virtue, and some-
where in that process I went
through a “sour grapes” trip. I
decided that the virtues of
achievement were better than
the virtues of money (which
was actually correct thinking
but for all the wrong reasons
then), and I determined that I
would “be somebody” so
great that everyone would
have to respect me whether I
had money or not. I would
become famous (just as soon
as I worked out all the details).

All my hopes lay in the
future, and I worked very hard
to get there. I still struggled
for acceptance and friends,
but mostly to survive. I grew
up strong by myself, dream-
ing dreams of myself the way
I wanted to become, not once
thinking of failure. There was
no question in my mind that I
would make it: I had to. The
only alternative was death in

one form or another, and
since I was already living
through a very real social

“death,” no alternatives but
success were acceptable to
me. There was only one way
out, and I would get there no
matter what. The worse things
got, the harder I worked. At
the age of 11 I went to work for
real.

With my first job, at 11
years of age, came a growing
awareness of another nasty
little thing the world can
throw a person: the concept
of the inferiority of woman-
kind. I was surprised I hadn't
noticed it before, but there it
was, bigger than life.

I worked in the fields,
hoeing weeds out of bean
fields, shoveling manure, and
tending livestock. There were
a lot of things I wasn’t allowed
to do because I was a girl, and
that really made me mad. I
was taller, stronger, and
faster than any boy in my
class, and since the argument
used against “heavy” work
was that I might hurt myself,
it didn’t make any sense at all.

I set out to really prove
myself, and before long I was
working on a pony farm, doing
everything no one else wanted
to do. I threw bales, cleaned
tack (bridles, saddles, har-
ness, etc.), groomed horses
and trimmed hooves, mixed
grain, all kinds of things.
Most of the work was fun
because I felt I was helping
the animals to have a better
life, and that made me feel
good. But a lot of it was dirty
and hard, and I wondered if
“proving myself” had been
such a good idea; I was being
used in the worst way. I made
about 25 cents an hour and I
never saw a penny of it. It
went to put food on our family
table. (The most I ever made
until I was out of high school
was 85 cents an hour, and that
was working 12 to 16 hours a
day in the fields, doing
backbreaking work with only
one break, which lasted as
long as it took to eat whatever
lunch I had.)

And I did get hurt some at
my first job; a stack of bales
fell on me once, I got kicked
frequently, and several times I
was jumped on by ponies or
trampled. I never complained
to anybody, though, because
if I did I would lose my job,
and we needed the money;
also, I was learning a lot, and
that was very valuable to me. I
was only 13 then.

Since the day I first started
working, I haven't stopped.
After a while, I got to keep
some of the money, which
was great except that I used it
all wrong. At first I didn’t
realize that it was mine
because I had earned it. I
thought it was like a present
or something, and I spent it all
right away, or gave it to
someone who said they
needed it, or bought things for
other people. My parents
encouraged me to save, but it
was always such a pitiful
amount that it never seemed
to grow fast enough and there
was always something I
needed. It seemed impossible
that I would ever have
anything really big from what
I had earned, so I used it for my
own material comforts or
shims of the moment. That
seemed perfectly logical to
me, but my parents criticized
me sharply for wasting money
on things that weren’t abso-
lutely necessary. A lot of
times I listened to them, but
more often I felt that I
deserved to spend my money
any way I wanted since I'd
worked so hard to earn it.
Sometimes I felt terribly
selfish, though, for spending
money just for myself when
the rest of my family was just
as bad off as I was, and I felt
very guilty because I didn’t
share as much as I thought I
should. The fact that there
wasn’t much to share didn’t
make any difference; I was
used to that by then.

When I finally got into high
school, I discovered several
unique ways to achieve a
small amount of popularity.
The other kids were starting to
think about college then, and
since I got good grades, I
began to be “useful” at last by
helping other kids with their
school work. I was totally
aware that I was being used,
and why, but I was so glad for
some social contacts that I
didn’t care too much. Then in
our state, girls’ athletics were
very popular, and since I was
pretty good at sports, I made
varsity on all the teams and

made some friends that way.
But I was seldom asked out on
dates or to parties, and I still
felt very keenly the ostracism
of my classmates. I just
wasn’t “in,” and it was the
same story all over again. I
had no close friends, no one I
could really talk to or who
even seemed to care very
much whether I existed or not.
I worked harder than ever and
dreamed my dreams of col-
lege and future success.

The time finally came and I
was accepted to the college of
my choice, a medium-sized
state school with a good
reputation and low tuition,
and I nervously awaited to
hear about scholarships. The
college didn’t help me, but my
high school teachers did, and
I was so pleased and
embarrassed at the time I
thought I'd faint. It was only
$100, but that was a fortune to
me. I applied for work and a
government loan for the rest,
and that came through, too,
which seemed like a miracle
to me. I didn’t think I deserved
such good luck.

There I was at a major
turning point in my life -- with
the tool of college within my
reach, I was ready to build a
secure future and bury my
past forever. But I hadn't
counted on a lot of unexpect-
ed problems. Like sororities
and the incredible elitism bred
of the assumed superiority of
the middle and upper classes.
Like the fact that all the things
I thought to free myself from
confronted me more power-
fully than ever, with pressures
to conform to values I only
knew from the wrong side of
the tracks.

The things that still counted
with my classmates in college
were things I still did not
have: money, social standing,
good communication skills,
popularity. Time and again I
came across the power that
money has, when all my
friends would go out to eat, or
go shopping, or plan trips.
That was all totally impossible
for me. With stars in my eyes,
I made a bad mistake right
away. I went out for rush,
hoping to find sisterhood and
friendship with other women
in a close-knit group. The
entire process sickened me.
At rush parties I was greeted
with politeness and that was
all. My clothes were in
impossibly “poor taste”
(which was not at all
humorous to me), my man-
ners were not like anyone
else’s, and I was obviously an
“outsider” by my appearance
alone. I could not help that,
but I think then that that was
my last stand against being
judged on someone else’s
terms alone.

Others could talk about the
big money projects they were
involved in, or the car they
were going to get when they
graduated, or the house they
were going to buy, or the
clothes. All I could talk about
was if I had enough money to
eat for the rest of the week,
because that was on my mind
a lot. A lot of times I was
broke by Thursdays, and I
really tried to stretch my
money out, too. The differ-
ence between me and the
other people I knew was that
when my money was gone,
there was no more, period.
Being broke for me meant flat
broke, which, I discovered,
did not mean the same thing

has to happen is for every
woman to reexamine her
entire value system, its
origins and present validity,
especially in terms of how she
relates to other women.

Another problem is that, in
the beginning of any dialogue
in relation to class, all these
angers start pouring out from
women at all levels, and in
trying to deal with the anger,
which is also valid, we get
personally defensive & side—
tracked from getting to the
real reason for everyone's
anger and tension. I really feel
that until we deal with the
reasons, we will never be able
to deal with our class
problems as sisters and begin
to relate to one another in a
freeing, supportive way. I
want us to get beyond the
issues that divide us, and in
order to do that, I think we
have to cut through all our
defenses and conditioning
and get down to gut level,
where there is pain. It would
be good to explore the pain we
share and the causes of it.
This must be done in honesty
with ourselves, and it must
begin there.

Just the fact that there ARE
angers should indicate that
the issue has not been
resolved. As a rule, when
there is anger, it means either
that someone has not lis-
tened, or that someone has
not said what they really feel.
It is time to hear what women
are angry about in terms of
class -- it’s time to get it out in
the open so that we can deal
with it and get beyond it.

I believe in women; I
believe in our strength and our
power of understanding, and I
trust in the truth of our pain.
What women need to do more
and more is to seek their roots
and to find in those roots
validity and dignity. No one
need be ashamed of the way
they were brought up; where
there is need for shame is
when we use our experiences
(or privileges) against one
another. Solving the problems
of class and caste is a giant
step toward sisterhood. That
step must be taken now, and
we must all take it together.

Part 2

The primary factors that
determine a person’s class
identity are:

1. THE WORK SHE DOES:

The bulk of work working
class women do is service,
factory, or office work, most
often low-paying and with
little hope for advancement. If
she has a family, she must
work two jobs: one in her
home and one in the labor
force. Work is a necessity for
her, not an option. The bulk of
work middle class women do
is managerial, professional,
or volunteer. For middle class
women, their work is not a
material necessity but an
attempt to achieve fulfillment
or escape boredom under the
illusion that somehow their
jobs are beneficial to the
world.

2. HER BACKGROUND:

The working class back-
ground: A woman growing up
in a working class family
knows what it is like to have
material needs. Her labor
power is important from the
time she is small, and often
she begins supporting herself
while still in her teens.
Schools and parents try to

Page 3

channel her into learning
practical skills for survival
such as home-ec and secre-
tarial skills, rather than
college-prep courses. If she
rebels against this, she learns
no skills and must work at the
lowest-paying, non-skilled
jobs or resort to prostitution.
If she aspires and goes on to
college, she finds it a
constant struggle. Because
she lacks the right contacts,
she has great difficulty
learning about loans and
scholarships and receives
little help finding employment
after graduation.

The middle class back-
ground: A woman growing up
in a middle class family learns
the skills necessary to “make
it” in the system. She learns
the proper ways of speaking
and relating to people. She
develops self-confidence
through the security of her
social environment. She is
assured of a college educa-
tion, learns what is expected
of her, and is promised a
social position. She has the
luxury of sampling the latest
fads, experimenting with dif-
ferent lifestyles, or doing
things just for the experience,
because she knows that she
can always get money from
her parents if she needs it.
When she takes a low-paying
job, it is temporary because
she has the skills, contacts
and education to either find
another job or to align herself
with a middle class man.

3. HER RELATIONSHIP WITH
MEN:

This is the most important
determinant of class identity.
The economic class system is
a hierarchy of power among
men. A woman's class identi-
ty is determined by her
relationship to men: first by
her father, later by her
husband. The higher up her
man is in the class hierarchy
the more she benefits from
the system. The wife of a
middle class man need not
work for her survival outside
of her home because she is
provided for by her husband.
She is economically depend-
ent on him. The wife of a
working class man is forced to
be economically dependent
upon herself. The family
cannot make ends meet on the
husband’s income alone.

The single woman is obvi-
ously working class (ignoring
a few token exceptions)
because women are the
lowest paid workers. Any
woman who is economically
self-dependent rather than
male-dependent lives in the
material reality of the working
class regardless of her back-
ground.

To conclude, the most
general definition of a working
class woman is one who is
economically self-dependent.

Part 3

At the Big Mama Rag
meetings on class-consciousness very little progress
was made in developing cre-
ative theory and action pro-
grams. Every time a working-
class woman began to relate
her pain about her class
oppression, such as the
printed personal account in
this issue, a middle-class
woman would reply that she
was not responsible. She was
not an oppressor, she was not
