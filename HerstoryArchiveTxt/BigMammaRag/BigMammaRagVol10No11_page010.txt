Declaration Of Principles From The Tenth Annual

Tenth Annual
Conference on Human Rights

International
and Psychiatric

Conference,
held in Toronto, Canada on
14-18, 1982 adopted the following
principles:
1. We oppose involuntary psychiatric

intervention including civil commitment
and the administration of psychiatric

treatment and those who have or
are likely to have it imposed on them.
15. We oppose the psychiatric system
because it is frighteningly similar to
the Inquisition, chattel slavery and
the Nazi concentration camps.

16. We oppose the medical model of
mental illness because it justifies
involuntary psychiatric intervention

procedures (treatments) by force or
coercion or without informed consent.
2. We oppose involuntary psychiatric
intervention because it is an unethical
and unconstitutional denial of freedom,
due process and the right to be left
alone.

3. We oppose involuntary psychiatric

intervention because it is a violation
of the individual's right to control
his or her own soul, mind, and body.

4. We oppose forced psychiatric proce-
dures such as drugging, electroshock,
psychosurgery, restraints, solitary
confinement, and aversive behaviour
modification.
5. We oppose
procedures because
they humiliate, debilitate,
incapacitate and kill

people.

6. We oppose forced psychiatric proce-
dures because they are at best quackery
and at worst tortures, which can and do
cause severe and permanent harm to the
total being of people subjected to them.
7. We oppose the psychiatric system
because it is inherently tyrannical.

8. We oppose the psychiatric system
because it is an extra-legal parallel
police force which suppresses cultural
and political dissent.

9. We oppose the psychiatric system
because it punishes individuals who
have had or claim to have had spiritual
experiences and invalidates those ex-
periences by defining them as symptoms
of mental illness.

10. We oppose the psychiatric system
because it uses the trappings of med-
icine and science to mask the social-
control function it serves.

11. We oppose the psychiatric system
because it invalidates the real needs of
poor people by offering social welfare
under the guise of psychiatric care

and treatment.

12. We oppose the psychiatric system
because it feeds on the poor and power-
less, the elderly, women, children,
sexual minorities, people of colour and
ethnic groups.

13. We oppose the psychiatric system
because it creates a stigmatized class
of society which is easily oppressed and
controlled.

14. We oppose the psychiatric system
because its growing influence in educ-
ation, the prisons, the military, gov-
ernment, industry and medicine threat-
ens to turn society into a psychiatric
state made up of two classes: those who

forced psychiatric proce-
dures including forced drugging.

17. We oppose the medical model of
mental illness because it dupes the
public into seeking or accepting volun-
tary treatment by fostering the notion
that fundamental human problems, wheth-
er personal or social, can be solved

by psychiatric/medical means.
18. We oppose the use of psychiatric

terms because they substitute jargon for
plain English and are fundamentally
stigmatizing, demeaning, unscientific,

mystifying and superstitious. Examples:

Plain English Psychiatric Jargon

Psych. inmate.......Mental patient

Psych. institution..Mental hospital/

ter

Psych. system......-Mental health sys-

tem

19. We believe that people should have
the right to live in any manner or
lifestyle they choose.

20. We believe that suicidal thoughts
and/or attempts should not be dealt
with as a psychiatric or legal issue.
21. We believe that alleged dangerous-
ness, whether to oneself or others,
should not be considered grounds for
denying personal liberty, and that
only proven criminal acts should be
the basis for such denial.

22. We believe that persons charged with crimes should be tried for their
alleged criminal acts with due process
of law, and that psychiatric profess-
ionals should not be given expert-wit-
ness status in criminal proceedings or
court of law.

23. We believe that there should be no
involuntary psychiatric interventions
in prisons and that the prison system
should be reformed and humanized.

24. We believe that so long as one
individual's freedom is unjustly re-
stricted no one is truly free.
25. We believe that the psychiatric
system is, in fact, a pacification
program controlled by psychiatrists
and supported by other mental health
professionals, whose chief function is
to persuade, threaten or force people

to conform to established norms.

26. We believe that the psychiatric
system cannot be reformed but must be
abolished.

27. We believe that voluntary networks —
of community alternatives to the psych-
iatric system should be widely encour-
aged and supported. Alternatives such as
self-help or mutual support groups,
advocacy/rights groups, co-op houses,
crisis centers and drop-ins should be
controlled by the users themselves to
serve their needs, while ensuring their
freedom, dignity and self-respect.

28. We demand an end to involuntary
psychiatric intervention.

29. We demand individual liberty and
social justice for everyone.

30. We intend to make these words real
and will not rest until we do.
