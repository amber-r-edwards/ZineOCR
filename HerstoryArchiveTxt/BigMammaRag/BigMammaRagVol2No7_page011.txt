Women and  
the Arts  

The apathy of the Denver  
public, galleries, and museums is  
stifling potential creativity; and  
offering, virtually, a dead-end  
road to women.  

In cities responsive to art,  
women have been able to  
successfully fight the  
mainstream and have built a  
creative and competitive force.  

Womanspace, a Los Angeles  
art center for women, was  
originated by L.A. women in  
January, 1972. According to the  
Women’s Survival Catalogue,  
this is the first comprehensive  
West Coast exhibition space for  
women.  

Womanspace has members  
from all over the states, and  

offers unprecedented services  
and nurturance to Feminist  
artists. For twelve dollars a year,  
Womanspace members are  
offered: a slide registry,  
exhibition and voting  

privileges; and a subscription to  
Womanspace Journal.  

Other benefits available to  
L.A. women include lectures,  
workshops, and exhibitions in  
all of the fine arts. Sometime in  
the future Womanspace may  
also put on traveling exhibitions.  

Another organization outside  
of Denver which is beneficial is  
the Slide Registry. A woman  
may send up to four slides of  
her work to the registry along  
with information regarding her  
work and herself. This  
information then becomes  
available to participating artists,  
galleries, and curators. The  
W.E.B. (West-East Bag) area  
representative maintains the  
registry. Our area rep is the art  
department at the University of  
Colorado.  

Women’s art centers,  
collective and non-collective in  
membership, have sprung up in  

many cities, including: the  
Chicago Women's Graphic  
Collective, Powerhouse in  

Montreal, Women’s Art Center  
in St. Louis, A.I.R. in New  
York, and centers in  
Connecticut, Ohio,  
Pennsylvania, California, and  
Massachusetts.  

The centers  
charge a twenty to thirty per  
cent commission on works sold.  
(The average is 40 per cent.)  

Along with the art centers a  
good number of film, video, and  
theatre collectives have  
blossomed. All of these help  
bring women’s art into the  
community where it belongs.  

Denver is far behind these  
towns but some constructive  
effort is being made.  

The Thread Co., a group of  
five Denver women who pooled  
their resources and minds,  
consists of Nancy Campbell,  
Susan Cole, Nancy Deveraux,  
Pauline Olsen, and Karen White.  
These women have taken all  
kinds of fibers and turned away  
from conventional crafts to fiber  
sculpture.  

A Denver collective is now  
also being organized. They meet  
weekly at 1895 Lafayette St.  
Call Kim at 355-8950 or Ghigui  
at 756-4377 for detailed  
information.  

Although it is hard for any  
kind of serious fine art to  
blossom in Denver, it is good to  
know that a few women are  
accepting the challenge and are  
getting down to work instead of  
complaining.

“I'll Be a  
Banker”  

In working-class Irish  
Catholic Boston, even today a  
Feminist is a woman who  
asks her husband to dry the  

dishes sometimes. Few of  

the daughters in that white  
ghetto where I grew up es-  
caped; when I am in Boston  
visiting friends and relatives I  
find my childhood friends all  

living just blocks from their  

parents and sending their  
children to the same  
parochial schools they went  
to.  

To most of them, I am a  
Radical Feminist. They are a  
long way, both geograph-  
ically and emotionally, from  
my woman friends here in  
Denver who are exploring the  
possibilities of self-recognition.  
The one question I have  
been asked by both groups of  
women is why I have chosen  
to try to break into finance.  
The answer doesn’t come  
easily.  

Painful Choice  

In a few months I will  
graduate from the University  
with a degree in finance and  
have put out the first feelers  
toward a position as an of-  
ficer in a local bank. It was a  
painful decision at best to  
make that choice and I can  
only trace its making back a  
year to another night in April  
when I listened to a strong  
and courageous Feminist talk  
about power.  

I went to interview  
Florynce Kennedy with other  
BMR staffers there and in-  
stead of an interview got an  

amazing dose of realism. I  
had spent my few years as a  
Feminist listening to people  
talk about collective vs.  
hierarchies and group  
strength vs. individual  
power, but in Kennedy, I was  
confronted with a woman  
talking about personal power  
being used to open doors and  
about the foolishness of  
denying one’s strengths to  
help each other.  

For the first time I un-  
derstood why I felt cheated in  
classes where the professor  
had opted out of a leadership  
position in the classroom.  
Because, (let's face it), they  
still gave out the grades all  
the while they were denying  
they had anything to teach.  

One of the basic truths of  
life may be that the strength  
to help other people is direct-  
ly proportional to the  
strength you have to help  
yourself. It may seem like a  
very simple truth but its  
application changed my style  
of life.  

Soc-Fem.-Maoist?  

I have found it threaten-  
ing to have someone ask  
what my politics are. The  
people who ask this question  
all seem to expect simple  
definitive answers which I  
don't have. I have long wish-  
ed I had a ready answer like,  
“I, my friend, am a Socialist-  
Feminist with Maoist  
leanings.” (I heard someone  
describe herself like that  
once and couldn't decide  
whether I was impressed or  
scared).  

It's not a problem  
anymore. I am a woman who  
believes in the power and  
strength of women, who  
would like to see America as  
a female culture. I see no  
dichotomy between that and  
my wish to work toward that  
end by opening doors for  
others with my own personal  
money-achieved powers. To  
those who have asked me  
what I will do, “after the  
revolution,” I answer again,  
“I'll be a banker.”  
Revolutions, contrary to a  
widely-held daydream, do  
not turn countries into  
agrarian paradises. CPAs,  
bankers, pilots, mothers, file-  
clerks, and grocery checkers  
need apply.  

Dropping out is not the answer;  
fucking up is. Most women are  
already dropped out; they were  
never in. Dropping out gives  
control to those few who don’t  
drop out; dropping out is  
exactly what the establishment  
leaders want; it plays into the  
hands of the enemy; it  
strengthens the system instead  
of undermining it, since it is based  
entirely on the nonparticipation,  
passivity, apathy, and  
non-involvement of the mass of  
women. Dropping out, however,  
is an excellent policy for men,  
and SCUM will enthusiastically  
encourage it. — Valerie Solanas,  
Scum Manifesto.
