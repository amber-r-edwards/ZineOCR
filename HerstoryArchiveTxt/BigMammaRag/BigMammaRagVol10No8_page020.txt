BLACK SPOTS: These
are areas of land occupied by
Africans that are surrounded
by white-owned territory, or are 'poorly sited,' that is, too close
to white farms or towns. To
clear the 'black spots' mas-
sive uprootings of settled
populations and communities
have taken place.

INFLUX CONTROL: A mass of
regulations and legislation
has been evolved for the
purpose of restricting the
‘number of Africans entering,
residing or working in urban
areas. Influx control is car-
ried out by the labour agen-
cies, by police, magistrates'
courts and the Bantu Affairs
Department. It is achieved by
means of the Pass Laws.

PASS, REFERENCE BOOK: The
pass laws which restrict the
freedom of movement and
choice of occupation of the
African people have their
roots in the beginnings of
white occupation. Every

single African male and fe-
male over the age of 16 years
must carry a pass at all times
and produce it on demand. On
average nearly 2,000 people
every day are prosecuted for
infringements of the pass
laws. In 1952 the various laws
controlling movement were con-
solidated into one Act, en-
abling the authorities to
issue reference books to
Africans in lieu of the vari-
ous passes they were formerly
required to carry. The book
contains the holder's identity
card as well as particulars
of residence, employment con-
tract, tax receipts, etc. In
addition it contains endorse-
ments regarding the eligibi-
lity of the holder to live
in, work in or seek work in
prescribed areas. "Passes"
and "reference books" are
therefore interchangeable
terms.

SECTION 10: This is the sec-
tion of the law (the Bantu
Urban Areas Act as amended)
which lays down that no Afri-
can may remain in prescribed
(that is, 'white') areas un-
less he produces proof that:
(a) he or she has lived there
continuously since birth;
or

(b) he or she has worked
there continuously for
one employer for at least
10 years, or has lived
there lawfully and con-
tinuously for fifteen
years, and has not been
convicted of a serious
offence and has not been

(c) other means,

(d) employed outside the
area;
he or she is the wife,
unmarried son or daugh-
ter under the age of 18
of someone in the above
categories; or
he or she has been grant-
ed special permission to
be in the area.
People with these residenti-
al rights may be ordered out
if deemed to be idle or unde-
sirable. Up to 1964, wives
were allowed to live in urb-
an African townships if their
husbands qualified, but since
then there has been an effec-
tive embargo on the entry of
women to the urban areas
other than on a visitor's per-
mit for a specific period.
The wording of the régula-
tions suggests that excep-
tions may be made, but
couples who apply for the wife
to join her husband find that
in practice permission is not
granted. By removals and
the number who

Did she have the right to re-
fuse treatment? Was she
under the legal guardianship
of her family who could decide
what kind of medication she
should have?

7. Why didn’t the crown pursue
the possibility of death
through suicide when acciden-
tal overdose by nursing staff
was just as strong a possibi-
lity?

8. Why weren't the side effects
of the drugs she was taking
on a regular basis discussed
in the courtroom, especially
when one of fluphenazine's
serious side effects is "si-
lent pneumonia"?

9. The psychiatrist who pre-
scribed the drugs for Eller-
ton was in Saudi Arabia at
the time of the inquest and
was not able to testify. Why
did three psychiatrists and
doctors associated with the
Ellerton case (Dr. Durost is
presently working at the
Clarke; Dr. Lippert is work-
ing at St. Michael's Hospital)
leave Queen Street before the
inquest into the Ellerton
death?

ENDORSED OUT: An endorse-
ment in the reference book
means that the owner of the
book must leave a prescribed
area (that is, one consider-
ed to be white, but where a
large number of Africans live
and work).

BORDER AREA, BORDER INDUSTRY:
Where it is possible, white
industrialists have been en-
couraged to build factories
in regions adjacent to a Ban-
tustan. This policy has a
twofold purpose: to use the
black labour of the reserves
while keeping the workers es-
sentially based in the re-
serves; and to decentralise
industry from the four main
industrial areas of the coun-
try. The idea is that black
workers will live within the
reserves in 'towns' sited a-
long the borders, cross over
to the 'white' area to work
during the day, and return
again at night. In fact many
Africans employed in border
industries must travel to and
live in the vicinity of such
industries, and are there-
fore still migrant workers,
although the burden of pro-
viding them with accommoda-
tion is shifted to the Ban-
tustans.

POPULATION OF SOUTH AFRICA:
