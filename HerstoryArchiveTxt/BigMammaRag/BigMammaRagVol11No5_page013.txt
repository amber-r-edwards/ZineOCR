women in cages

"The path of progress in
psychiatry is circular, per-
iodically returning to its
starting point."

Thomas Szasz, M.D., The Man-
ufacture of Madness.

Here we are, ready

to plunge into this institution
by the river where everything
is the same and yet

so different. Another

state, an unknown set of rules,
and this new thing she's done,
this direct statement:

I do not want to live.

We are afraid and we do not

know what it is we can or

can't do, but we agree on this:
no shock treatments, never again,
and home as soon as possible,
maybe today, if we talk loud

and fast enough

and do not listen to the

roaring in our heads.

(Professor Ugo Cerletti, in-
ventor of electric shock the-
rapy, recalling the first time
he used the treatment on a
human being, "When I saw the
patient's reaction, I thought
to myself, 'This ought to be
abolished!'")

A mockingbird sings

from a low branch; we open
our mouths and gulp a last
lungful of free air. We are
three humans, related by love
and blood, vulnerable

flesh against stone.

When we push through the door
to the lobby, we are immersed
in a deep channel of water.
Lost creatures slide by us.
We are almost to the front desk
before someone calls out,
smelling fear and pity
pouring off us like sweat.

We feel something inside
ourselves turn on its back,
belly to the ceiling.

We sign our individual names
and relationships, but we know
we are family

and we do not agree

to this place.

We walk past offices, empty,
unlit treatment rooms, incomprehensible
machines. We wonder where

the torture takes place

and know it is deliberately
kept from us.

Down By the River

By Christina V. Pacosz

We surprise ourselves.

How is it each of us has decided
not to play Judas?

When we kiss her this time,

we will be shouting welcome:

hello to the lost, the lonely,

these heretics and modern-day witches,

the oppressed: our mother, our wife.

(1851, Illinois commitment
statute enacted. "Married
women...may be entered or
detained in the hospital at
the request of the husband
of the woman...without evi-
dence of insanity required
in other cases.")

We are certain
if we turn away from her,
we turn away from ourselves.

We are on the ward;

there she is:

a skinny old woman,

locked away and muttering

to herself. When she sees us,
her eyes flame.

She comes to us drugged,
rigid, begging to go home.

We sit with her, a temporary island,
taking conversation, trying

to ignore the swell and ripple
around us.

A man visits his wife.

The woman is too loud,

she says damn

and FUCK and smokes

cigarette after cigarette.

He is gawky,

not enough chin

and too much Adam's apple.

Her jeans hang on her body.

He is dressed in chinos

and a thin cotton shirt.

He hands her a package.

She rips the wrapping off:

a picture of Jesus in the
Garden of Olives. She waves

his offering and shouts:
JESUS CHRIST from K-Mart,
for 67¢. The figure in the print
is kneeling, robed in purple
and alone.

From the bricked-in garden
just off the ward,

a black man gestures to us.
He smiles. He is wearing
pajamas, a robe and slippers,
though it is well past noon
and lunch has been served.

He walks toward us,

a living piece of flotsam

cast up by the river.

He is polite and tells us

his name: Richard.

This is our first clue

we have entered another landscape
where nothing is accidental.

We introduce him to the Richard
in our family. The black Richard
grins at the white Richard,
leans over and asks my mother,
will she free him, too?

She clenches her fists

and hisses, "Yes!"

("1955. Egas Moniz is awarded
the Nobel Prize for Physiology
or Medicine for the treatment
of schizophrenia by prefrontal
lobotomy.")

I am caught by the drowned snags
of the river at last.

I walk to the nurses' station,
the territory marking the border
between the visitor's lobby and the ward.
I glance up

stare across a sudden expanse

of barbed wire,

into a woman's face.

She is walnut-skinned

and her eyes come at me

like deer.

Someone tells me,

this is our Christine.

I nod... I know her.

My head hums. I ask her

where she lives

but I cannot understand

her dialect, her black rural
southern speech.

I wrap my arms

around her

with my eyes.

I want to throw my arms around
them all and shout:

we are locked in here
whether we are inside

these walls or not,

when can we be free?

I want to sing out:

let us go down

to the river

each and every one,

where we can walk

and run and move

our limbs in the ripe sun

and wait for the thunder, down
by the river flowing

out of the high green hills

to where the mockingbird sings.

We will listen

for the thunder
and pray the walls
crumble.
