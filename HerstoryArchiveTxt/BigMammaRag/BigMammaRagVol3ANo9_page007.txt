News Service/ Union Aim  
for National Feminism  

Linda Fowler  

The National Radical Feminist  
Conference, held August 24 to  
August 29 in York, Pennsylvania,  
set as one of its goals the  
establishment of a national  
communications network. This  
network, in the form of the  
Feminist News Service, got off  
the ground at the conference  
along with a co-organization  
called the Feminist Media  
Union. Though both groups have  
a long way to go to become a  

functioning reality, a good  
working paper was drafted  
during the week-long  
conference.  

The dual purpose organization  
was pulled together by several  
representatives of women’s  
media groups. The groups  
represented, with the exception  
of BMR, are from the eastern  
part of the country. Over the next  
few months these original  
members will be working to  
expand the membership of the  
organization with the aim of  
making it a nationwide concern.  
Contributing members of this  
original group included Hera  
(Philadelphia), Lavendar Woman  
(Chicago), Big Mama Rag  
(Denver), KNOW, Inc. (Penn.),  
and The Maine Freewoman’s  
Herald (Brunswick, Maine).  
While these first members are  
all involved with print media, the  
network is intended to be  
multi-media, eventually involving  
video, television, and radio.  

Membership in the News  
Service-Union is open to  
independent feminists who  
work with establishment media  
as well as to feminist media  
groups. Since coverage of the  
Movement in the establishment  
media is both slight and often  
misrepresentative, the  
organization hopes to move to  

correct this situation by  
involving women from the  
group.  

From the beginning of the  
women’s movement and the  
establishment of feminist media,  
one primary difficulty has been  
the rapid exchange of news.  
Establishment media is  
unreliable and feminist media,  
when reliable, usually brings us  
the news at least a month  
(usually more) late. The Feminist  
News Service will function to  
more rapidly facilitate the  
exchange of news by reducing  
the time span involved in the  
exchange. Member groups or  

individuals will send stories to  
the central office of the service  
where they will be compiled,  
duplicated, and mailed out in  
packet form to all members.  

Current thinking is to use print  
media due to low costs and ease  
of use. The service could evolve  
in the future into an exchange of  
radio and video tapes, as well.  

Publication in the beginning  
will be on a bi-weekly basis, with  
the aim of becoming a weekly  
service at a later time.  

Tentative plans call for the  
central office to be established in  
Denver, with regional offices in  
other areas of the country. These  
regional offices will have the  
task of maintaining contact with  
women’s events and projects in  
their area and facilitating  
communication between the  
service and the groups and  
projects.  

While the governing structure  
is not yet firm, plans are to divide  
the country into regions with  
representatives from each  
region comprising a national  
board. Also on the board will be  
the staff members of the  
national office. This board will  
meet on a regular basis and will  
determine policy for the news  
service and the media union.  

The purpose of the union will  
be to take direct actions via  
media of such a type as to help  
bring focus and unity to the  
movement on a national level.  
This would involve determining  
specific actions that the feminist  
media as a whole might take  
during a given time span, such  
as focusing attention and  
discussion on certain problems  
within the movement, offering  
analysis of these issues and  
suggesting some possible  
means of dealing with these  
problems or ways to facilitate  
discussion and solutions. It will  
also be a means whereby we can  
develop our politics, our culture,  
and our organization.  

A specific target date has not  
been set for operations to begin.  
It is hoped that the first packet of  
news items can be mailed out  
within six months.  

Groups or individuals who are  
interested in joining the  
organization or who wish more  
information should contact any  
member groups or write to

A National Radical Feminist  
Conference took place in York  
Hayen, Pennsylvania, between  
August 25th and 29th. The site  
was a YMCA campsite, a  
pleasant and spacious place  
complete with cabins, meeting  
hall, pool, and tennis courts.  
Around 200 women showed up  
to discuss the dual themes of  
women’s community and a  
national communications  
network. The conference  
committee met each attendee  
with an information sheet,  
anticipating and answering  
questions, and an advised  
program and schedule. Space  
was apportioned for workshops,  
theatre, general meetings,  
music, and film. Women were  
asked to sign up for kitchen duty  
and childcare. It was  
immediately apparent that the  
conference had been set up with  
a great deal of care and  

forethought, but with maximum  
space allowed for the  
participants to define their own  
priorities and to design their own  
program around these. Physical  
realities such as food, childcare,  
sound systems for entertainers,  
and such, were excellent.  
Politically it was clear that the  
organizing committee, who  
identified themselves  
throughout the conference by  
wearing bright head or  
armbands, were astute and  
open, careful to anticipate  
possible conflicts while never  
imposing their own solutions or  
withholding information.  

Structure  

Every morning a schedule of  
workshops was put up in the  
dining hall. At first these were  
based on the advised program,  
which had been drawn up  
beforehand on the basis of  
arrangements already made  
with workshop facilitators. Later  
on, as women became more  
involved, more workshops  
would be linked into the daily  
schedule and the days became  
progressively more jammed.  
Themes had been tentatively  
assigned to each day: Tuesday,  
for instance, was to be Self Day,  
with workshops such as  
Lifestyles and Living  
Arrangements and Children’s  
Position in the Community  
scheduled. But as more and  
more workshops were planned,  
schedules had to be juggled and  
the theme idea disintegrated.  

On Monday, women met in  
small groups to discuss the  
concept of community. Tuesday  
morning a large meeting was  
held to bring together the fruits  
of the small group meetings and  
to give women who had  
experience of women's  
communities an opportunity to  
share their ideas and  
conclusions. We heard from a  
community which had failed and  
one which is still in planning  
stages — none yet in actual  
functioning existence. Many  
women liked the idea of  
maintaining a space in the  
country and one in the city, with  
the community moving freely  
between the two. The ideal,  
then, would be to use the city  
space to serve the needs of its  
community and to generate  
money, and to concentrate in the  
country on simplifying survival  
needs.  

Workshops  

Other workshops included  

one on the Politics of Health, in  

Big Mama Rag  

Emily Medvec’s workshop on  

Community Economic  
Relationships fell into this  
category by virtue of the fact that  
she gave the participants  
exercises to perform, so that  
every woman there felt herself  
involved in a learning process  

and responsible for her  
participation.  
In the evenings, general  

meetings were planned to bring  
together the day's activities. In  
fact, only two such meetings  
ever came about, and they were  
poorly attended and generally  
disorganized. For the rest,  
evenings were given over to  
music, mime, readings, and  
theatre, some of which was  
excellent. Tampa Feminist  
Guerilla Theatre were at their  
best in music and dance. The  
Rhode Island Feminist Theatre  
(RIFT) presented plays and  
dramatic exercises; jugglers and  

the immediate context of  
individual workshops. All that  
energy, all that discussion,  
where has it gone?  

It can hardly be the  
responsibility of the conference  
facilitators to ensure that  
something concrete comes out  
of it. They made it very clear from  
the beginning that they saw  
themselves as functioning to  
provide a space and a smoothly-  
run environment for whatever  
women wanted to make of it, and  
this they did very well indeed.  
Their hope was that the  
conference participants  
themselves would define their  
direction and expectations at the  
very first meeting, so that the  
time available could be  
structured accordingly. The  
facilitators acted with great  
responsibility to order the  
conference around those  
priorities. What, then, was the  

problem?  
Analysis  

First of all, it seemed to me  
that a great many women came  
to the conference to see what  
would happen; prepared to take  
a stand for or against whatever  
did, but not prepared to  
participate in creating it. If, right  
at the outset, participants had  
committed themselves to follow  
through after the conference  
was over, task forces could have  
been established during the  
course of the conference to  
ensure that all that energy  
would go somewhere, would  
have some effect. If this kind of  
commitment does not  
automatically emerge at our  
conferences, then we had better  
start thinking about applying  
more structure to the time we  
spend together.  

As the conference wore on,  
more and more women were to  
be found at the pool and fewer  
and fewer in workshops. A few  
whom I talked with spoke of their  

frustration, the futility of  
attending workshop after  
workshop and seeing it  
degenerate into small talk,  

bickering, or self-congratulatory  
fantasizing. Real problems,  
problems feminists need to  
confront and which become  
unavoidable when we talk about  
actually living together, were  
either not confronted, or else  
became vehicles for an  
underlying hostility, which  
seemed to be present from the  
very first day of the conference.  
Bitter quarrelling erupted daily  
in and out of workshops, and it  

never discussed per se. With our  
varying perspectives never  
clear, there was no sound base  
for political accord.  

Hostility emerged very early  
on, at the opening meeting. A  
committee member announced  
that some women had arrived  
with no money, because their  
car had had to be repaired on the  
way, and thus they were unable  
to pay their registration fees. The  
committee felt that it was no  
longer within their province to  
make such a decision, and asked  
the conference to direct them.  
There was a resentful response  
from some women who felt that  
if they'd had to sweat and slave  
to earn the money to come to the  
conference, then, goddammit,  
so should everyone else. These  
women were insistent that some  
kind of task be assigned to the  
moneyless ones, over and above  
the shared tasks which were to  
be performed by all conference  
participants. Other responses  
were milder, most women didn’t  
really seem to care, some were  
concerned that too liberal an  
attitude might foster a politically  
draining trend toward  
conference freeloading. At any  
rate, an element of paranoid  
defensiveness had made itself  
felt, and it gathered momentum  
throughout the conference  
without ever being confronted.  

Eruptions  

At a workshop on the Politics  
of Health, one woman became  
enraged at the other participants  
for being shit food eaters — this  
an assumption she was making  
— and began screaming at them.  

The Sagaris workshop  
degenerated into quarreling  
between supporters and critics  
of the Sagaris collective. Their  
critics had questions about the  
collective’s politics around class  
and race, and about the whole  
concept of an institute for the  
study of political theory. Their  
supporters pointed to the  
change Sagaris had made in  
their own lives as proof that the  
institute had truly had some  
meaningful impact. Each side  
seemed to be missing the other's  
points, and meanwhile the  
acrimony level mounted.  
Through it all the members of  
the Sagaris collective, notably  
Joan Peters and Blance Boyd,  
fielded criticisms with admirable  
calm and openness; all the  
same, they somehow never fully  
addressed them.  

At a workshop on the Position  
of Children in the Community,  

discussion almost immediately  
got down to a heated argument  
about male children, whether  
they should be tolerated at all, or  
treated as fully equal with  
female children. Toward the end  
of the conference, the mother of  
two boys aged 12 and 13 was  
asked to remove them from a  
meeting. The meeting in  
question was a regional  
gathering for women of the  
northeastern states, to discuss  
the specifics of creating a  
community in their area. What  
happened was a perfect example  
of the inability of conference  
participants to deal with real  
issues in any productive way.  
The mother, her lover, the boys  
and their sister immediately left  
the conference, angry and upset.  
That evening a committee  
member announced the incident  
in the meeting hall. The  
discussion that followed was  
intense and bitter, again with  
one side arguing the specific  
way in which the incident had  
been handled and the situation  
of the people involved, and the  
other side defending the politics  
of separatism in their application  
to young men.  

A theatre production included  
a rock-n-roll spoof which  
somewhat viciously put down  
women who relate to macho  
men rather than attacking the  
men themselves, or exploring  
the reasons why such women  
might internalize their  
oppression to such an extreme.

Conference Reluctant to  
Deal with Issue of Class  

Samn Stockwell  

The tendency to gloss over the  
serious issues underlying the  
concept of a feminist  
community, or to even seriously  
consider its structure, were  
increased by the summer camp  
setting of the National Radical  
Feminist Conference. The basic  
thrust of the conference was a  
back-to-the-land orientation,  
with media and communications  
concerns taking up most of the  
other scheduled space. There  
was one workshop to discuss the  
implications of a heterogeneous  
movement, called "Our  
Differences."  

The workshop on class, linked  
into the schedule by concerned  
citizens, reflected the difficulties  
of the conference as a whole.  
There was a reluctance to define  
the issue, and an inability to  
focus on any particular aspect of  
it for longer than three minutes.  
Specifically, what happens at  
most conferences is wool-  
gathering. Everyone volunteers  
their feelings about subjects  
related to the workshop topic or  
part thereof; there is no praise,  
no blame, and less  
consideration. It is perhaps  
unfair to expect those who  
cannot think to accept  
responsibility for their decisions,  
although they might be quicker  
to understand the logic of cause  
and effect if forced to live out the  
consequences of their  
immediate reactions.  

What I expect from people  
who define themselves as  
political entities is an acquired  
disciplined thought process  
which examines the  
implications of their actions, a  
conscious attempt to  
understand the interrelatedness  
of our systems and institutions.  

The NRFC is an example of a  
feminist institution — by  
examining who and what it  
benefits, its goals become  
apparent. I had hoped that the  
class workshop would make it  
clear, at least, how the NRFC  
functioned as a middle-class  
institution.  

At the class workshop’s  
outset, Linda Fowler and I spoke  
briefly about why we decided to  
have the workshop, and our  
concerns. The conversation then  
quickly proceeded to the issue  
of middle-class guilt, and why  
those people did or did not still  
feel it. Most women seemed to  
feel class was over as an issue,  
and they had made peace with  

their privileges. Some felt class  
was not an issue at all. One  
woman, in fact, said that neither  
class nor lesbianism were  
issues, but that getting money  
from women who had it was.  
She went on to add that then  
we'd be able to go on to create  
our revolution.  

Then there was the discussion  
of roles as a working-class  
phenomenon; a few almost  
relevant remarks about the bar  
community and the split  
between lesbians and lesbian-  
feminists as a class division  
quickly got side-tracked. It is  
amazing that a woman of any  
intelligence, in the midst of a  
movement which falters at every  
divergence of opinion, could say  
that there are no real  
differences, or could believe that  
a revolution arising out of the  
movement as it stands today  
would be at all egalitarian.  

It is as though a total  
revolution is expected, soon, and  
it will have to change everyone  
but ourselves. Those outside it  
will have to give up everything  
while we, the middle-class  
feminists who will run it, will still  
have our summer homes, our  
new cars, and quiet restful  
conferences in the country. To  
have everything and give up  
nothing is the attitude one  
expects from young male college  
radicals, not from radical  
feminists.  

There was a more liberal  
attitude from women who saw  
class and race as real  
differences — and their attitude  
was a recognition of privileges  
and a desire that everyone have  
access to them. But more  
accurately, it was a feeling that  
we should homogenize our  
differences. To paraphrase the  
Sagaris collective, our work  
should not reflect class or race  
(or sex?) backgrounds. If we are  
all to become homogenized, in a  
society that bases itself on  
middle-class values, it means we  
should all become middle-class.  

If a revolutionary movement  
does not expand the parameters  
of its experience to include its  
own potential constituency, it is  
as empty as its rhetoric. If we  
lose our sense of the differences  
in our beginnings, if we lose  
sense of our
