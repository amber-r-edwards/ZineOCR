Bonfil’s “Emily”

Carol Lease

Emily Dickinson died in mid-
May, 1886, leaving the identity
of her lost lover who was the
inspiration for her poetic genius,
hidden in her obscure, elo-
quent, voluminous poetry. The
mystery of her life and motiva-
tion to compose some of the
most beautiful poetry ever writ-
ten has been the subject of more
than one book and many plays
for nearly ninety years. The
latest attempt to unravel the
fabric of the poet's life occurred
on the stage of the Bonfils
Theatre in Denver in the play
Emily. This idea, which was
presented by the former hus-
band of a Dickinson biographer,
contends that the love of Emily’s
life was her brother Austin Dick-
inson, and that their incestuous
relationship was the primary in-
fluence for Dickinson's poetry.

Dickinson wanted the truth
about her life revealed after her
death through her poetry. She
carefully hid it in her poems
while she lived because she
realized that her position in the
world was weak and powerless.
She fought the world by with-
drawing and challenging the
conventions of her society. She
never married, mysteriously
started wearing white when she
was thirty, visited with friends
only by talking unseen to them
from a darkened, adjoining
room. She lived the life of a re-
cluse in her upstairs bedroom
and became a legend in her own
lifetime. But her breakdown
didn't occur until she was about
thirty years old and by this time
her brother had been married at
least six years. It is unlikely that
her breakdown was a result of
the break-up of her incestuous
love affair.

No Apologies by Polly Joan is
the first book published by
Women Writing Press, which
also puts out Women Writing, an
attractive, very useful news-
letter of women’s publications,
support groups, conferences,
etc. (available from Polly Joan at
$3 for 6 issues).

She begins her book with “no
more apologies” for being “feel-
ing muscle,” “a typical
woman” and ends on a moun-
tain, feeling

Power w/no hate
no tyranny

Just Power.

In between she includes poems
that stick in my head — about
her mother and doctor deciding
together whether to inject foam
into her small, 14-year-old
breasts; about what is per-
ceived as madness in famous
(dead female) writers, Salem
witches, and personal friends;
about her comparing muscles
with another woman, trying an
“open marriage,” and finding
herself no longer

plucking her own breast
feather by feather

creating wings
for children

now
tracking her blood
to the top of a mountain...

Although neither a narrative
nor a simple poetic chronicle, No
Apologies presents — through
direct, sometimes sharply in-
cisive language — Polly Joan's
growth and humor and strength.
Its own poetic impact (like that of
Shelley's book) seems rein-
forced by its publication by a
women’s press.

It is interesting to note that the
author of the play Emily, Thomas
Patterson, is the former hus-
band of Rebecca Patterson who,
in 1951, wrote the Riddle of
Emily Dickinson, in which she
presents and substantiates her
thesis that the unknown lover of
Dickinson was a woman, Kate
Scott Anthon.

Mr. Patterson says that it was
his former wife’s interest in
Dickinson that initiated his own
interest in the poet, and agrees
that Kate Anthon was a lover of
Emily's. But he insists that Dick-
inson, herself, tells us that there
were two important “events” in
her life — leaving room for both
theories of forbidden love: a
woman and a brother.

Rebecca Patterson uses Dick-
inson’s poetry, letters, diaries of
friends and historical facts to
show that some of the poet's
work was altered after her
death in order to obscure the
identity of her lover. After Dick-
inson died, hundreds of poems
were found in her room where
she had sequestered herself for
the last fifteen years of her life.
According to Patterson, anxious
relatives who read them must
have realized who the lover was
who abandoned the poet and
about whom Dickinson wrote
much of her symbolic poetry.
Pronouns were subsequently
changed, entire lines of poetry
were left out of published ver-
sions of poems, fictitious love
affairs with any man Emily
happened to correspond with
were fabricated to ensure that
the public identity of her lover
was male. And the idea that it
was her lost love for a man that
caused her self-imposed seclu-
sion as a young woman of thirty
until her death at 56 was widely
publicized by relatives who read
the poems.

Thomas Patterson says his
experience as a professional
cryptanalyst during World War II
gives him an advantage over
other Dickinson interpreters and
has enabled him to break the
code of her obscure symbolism
and hidden meanings. It is
interesting to note, however,
that Patterson uses almost the
same poems to show that Dick-
inson’s lover was her brother
that his former wife used to
support her theory that Dickin-
son's lover was Kate Anthon.

Mr. Patterson's play lacked
the depth that one would expect
to be present in dialogue to
support his idea. The dialogue
was overly preoccupied with
phallic symbolism and little else.
The characters were shallow
and simplistic. The point of the
play seemed to have Emily and
Austin in bed together, rather
than any focus on the love that
they allegedly felt for each other.
This tended to reveal a provoca-
tive and sensationalistic pur-
pose for Emily rather than a
genuine statement about the
poet's life. Scenes and dialogue
were pure invention and por-
trayed Dickinson as a tart, a
“vixen,” the spoiler of her
brother. Restructuring a poet's
life and motivations ninety
years after her death is tricky,
difficult and often unfair.

I would like to see a play-
wright with a feminist con-
sciousness write a play about
Emily Dickinson, the lover of a
woman, and the poet who has
been called the greatest woman
poet since Sappho.

and lots of other good things.
There is much less of a story-line
in this book than in her previous
work, Les Guerilleres. The plot
seems to be describing a colony
of women on an island. Actual-
ly, the story is about two women,
lovers, who alternately destroy
and rebuild each other. One of
the lovers does the talking, writ-
ing a letter to her lover.

The customs of the island
women are described only as
they directly affect the two lov-
ers. The tradition of partaking of
the menstrual flow of the
women who begin on the 28th
day is mentioned only because
the woman speaking is not
chosen to drink of her lover's
menses. The whole feeling and
symbolism of this moment is ob-
scured in her jealous disap-
pointment. The culture of the is-
land is violent, the women living
in a day-to-day manner, free
from behavioral restrictions.
Much of this violence is ex-
pressed through the ways in

which the lovers ravage each
other.

The language of the book is
thickly poetic and filled with
earthy images of bodily destruc-
tion, perhaps carnage is a better
word. “The women lead to your
scattered fragments, there is an
arm, there is a foot, the neck and
head are together, your eyelids
are closed, your detached ears
are somewhere, your eyeballs
have rolled in the mud.” An-
other woman has torn her lover
to pieces. Her vision blurs at the
sight, yet she pulls herself to-
gether and reassembles her
fragmented lover. “I hurriedly

Woman's Evolution:

Big Mama Rag Vol. 4, No. 3

From Matriarchal Clan to Patriarchal Family

In this exciting and scholarly
book, Evelyn Reed examines the
largely ignored history of early
humankind and establishes that
the first form of human organ-
ization was forged, founded and
led by women. This matriarchal
society lasted for over one mill-
ion years. How and why women
created the beginnings of
human society, and how they
came to lose their place in that
society are carefully and lucidly
documented in this immensely
readable book.

Conditioned as we have been
to the notion of male superiority
providing the impetus to human
progress, it is difficult (espec-
ially as a woman) to get through
this book without mounting feel-
ings of anger, amazement and
pride. Reading this book was for
me, as it will be for other women,
a recovery and an affirmation of
women’s achievements in the
history of human evolution. That
this knowledge has been denied
us is easy to understand; the
sexist orientation of anthro-
pologists in the past has simply
blinded them to the facts. These
facts, as documented by Evelyn
Reed, seem so obvious it is diffi-
cult not to shout out aloud, while
reading this book, ‘Of course!’—
or words to that effect.

Woman's Evolution is such a
thorough and intense work it is
difficult to summarize without
doing the author a disservice.
Briefly however, the main points
elaborated by Reed begin with
the assertion that women were
obviously suited — not in spite of
their childbearing qualities but

to introduce to human society the
cooperative behaviour essen-
tial to the development of the
human race. In order to protect
their young and preserve each
other, restrictions had to be
placed on the most readily avail-
able food supply: the living group
members. This restriction on
killing and eating each other be-
came a fundamental law.
Coupled with the violent drive
for food was the equally violent
drive for sex. These two main
animal drives had to be con-
tained and became intertwined
as a central taboo. This taboo
(which ultimately translated into
a modern day incest taboo,
hitherto an unexplained mys-
tery) was introduced by women
as a necessary means of pro-
tecting their young and ‘human-
izing’ society.

This cooperative ability in wo-
men enabled them to discover
and invent the first sources of
civilization. Women developed
agriculture, farming, home-
crafts, pottery and medicine.
They built the first shelters, and
were the first to learn the con-
trolled use of fire.

Of course Reed does not
merely assert these claims. Each
new fact, each exciting discov-
ery is backed up with all avail-
able evidence, not only of her
own thorough research but the
research of all noted anthro-
pologists in the field. Reed does
not simply refute or ignore the
current material in anthropol-
ogy, she reexamines it bit by bit,

back to her specific experience
as subject. The ‘I’ who writes is
alien to her own writing at every
word because this ‘I’ uses a lan-
guage alien to her.”

In French, her pronoun is Je;
in English, it becomes an itali-
cized I and splits my to symbolize
the “cutting in two which
throughout literature is the exer-
cise of a language which does
not constitute me as subject.”

In spite of this ambitious be-
ginning, Wittig really does not
hit the language factor quite so
hard, or perhaps so obviously, as
she did in Les Guerilleres. Per-
haps she is tiring of the theme.
At any rate, I felt this latest ven-
ture to be not as well-planned as
the last. Granted, she does re-
write several French myths,
giving them female rather than
male leads (Osiris as a woman),
but Renee Vivien did that in the
twenties.

The book was disappointing to
me, particularly after having en-
joyed Les Guerilleres so much.
Perhaps the book loses some-
thing in the translation. The
same person did the translating
of both books, however there is
a difference in the books that may
have made it more difficult for a
man to do well in this effort. In
the first book, a society of
women overthrows the male
culture and accepts the young
men into their circle. The second
book, however, is totally female,
totally women-loving-women;
how can a man truly feel and un-
derstand a lesbian culture?
