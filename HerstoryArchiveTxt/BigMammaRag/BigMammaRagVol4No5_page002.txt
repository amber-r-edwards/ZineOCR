FEN Again

Dissension Thrives Among

Julie Robinson, Woodwoman

A brief scuffle which broke
out in the Feminist Women's
City Club building in Detroit
early last month brought to
light several questions of
serious concern to the feminist
economic community.

The fracas occurred as the
Club’s official weekend grand
opening ceremonies drew to a
close. Police were called in to
quell the disturbance. Mailing
lists, files and important pa-
pers were reportedly stolen.

Members of the Detroit
Feminist Federal Credit Union
(DFFCU) are reported to have
been punched, pushed and
poked by Club employees who
insisted that the building was
about to close. The DFFCU
members, who were present
for a meeting, claimed 24-hour
access to their office space,
rented in the Club building.

The building was bought a
year ago by eight members of
the Feminist Economic Net-
work (FEN), who made loans
totaling $256,000 from the
DFFCU in order to finance the
purchase. It is now operated
by the Feminist Economic
Network Association (FENA),
a non-profit organization set
up by FEN to manage the
building.

The impressive Women’s
City Club building, built in
1924, houses numerous retail
shops and services including
plant, clothing, gift and print-
ing shops owned by FEN and
leased to women managers.
Office space is leased by
various professional women as
well as by the DFFCU and the
Downtown Detroit Feminist
Women’s Health Center.

Meeting and convention fac-
ilities include two floors of
hotel rooms, meeting rooms, a
ballroom, dining room, cock-
tail lounge and Olympic size
pool. These accommodations
are also available on a private
club basis with annual dues of
$75 and an entrance fee of
$25.

Hand in Hand

FEN is currently composed of
three members: DFFCU, Di-
ana Press and the Oakland
Women’s Feminist Health
Center. Its stated purpose is
“to provide a basis for econ-
omic development for women
through the continued devel-
opment of feminist institutions
and enterprises in connection
with one another and in
conjunction with feminist val-
ue structures.”

According to an article about
the Club in the Detroit Free
Press, FEN’s purchase of the
building is proof that “fem-
inism and capitalism can go
comfortably hand in hand.” 
Asked to comment on this,
Joanne Parrent, board mem-
ber of both DFFCU and FEN,
said that women are utilizing
certain tools in order to gain
power and to enjoy and control
their own lives. “The only
thing that goes hand in hand
with feminism is feminism,”
she said.

Following the scuffle, the
DFFCU’s supervisory
committee called in a federal
examiner to investigate the
loans which financed the
purchase of the Club building.

After completing his exam-
ination, the official turned his
findings over to the National
Credit Union Administration
(NCUA) in Washington, DC.

According to Joanne Parrent,
all loans conformed to “the
letter of the law,” but the
examiner was concerned ab-
out certain “procedural mis-
takes” regarding proof of
collateral and unrecorded in-
formation within committee
minutes. She refused to
identify the loans in question,
asserting the right of confi-
dentiality for credit union
members.

Parrent expressed confi-
dence in the Credit Union's
ability to proceed with “busi-
ness as usual,” once it has
implemented self-correcting
measures to comply with the
examiner's findings. Parrent
expects official NCUA clear-
ance early in May. “The
government has a lot at stake
in the success of the feminist
federal credit unions,” she
said.

Expansion Opposed

Dissension surfaced within
the Detroit feminist communi-
ty in January, when the
DFFCU voted to expand its
charter to include 13 midwest-
ern states. An expansion of
this nature would conform to
FEN's stated aim of providing
an economic power base for
the feminist movement.

Approval of such a charter
would have meant, in effect,
that any feminist federal cred-
it union within the specified
states would have to be
a branch of the DFFCU.
Questions of power, collectiv-
ity and community control
prompted dissidents within
the DFFCU to oppose the
proposed expansion.

A membership meeting of
the DFFCU was held on April
24th to discuss political and
philosophical discrepancies.
Following a highly structured
format, representatives of
FEN and the DFFCU’s board
and advisory committee field-
ed questions from approxi-
mately 50 DFFCU members in
attendance. The federal ex-
aminer, who was also present,
disallowed questions which he
deemed “too pointed” (prob-
ably queries about specific
loans).

A proposal issued by the
membership meeting recom-
mended that the DFFCU
dissolve its membership in
FEN; that no more credit be
extended to “the FEN assoc-
iation, corporation or insti-
tution”; that the DFFCU
restrict its activities to the
state of Michigan; and that a
procedure be evolved to en-
sure more membership input
within the organization.

The proposal, which called
for “respect, cooperation and
information sharing” within
the DFFCU, will be consi-
dered by the board at its next
meeting, scheduled to take
place as Big Mama goes to
press.

Asked about FEN's account-
ability to the feminist com-
munity, Laura Brown, a dir-
ector, stressed that FEN is
accountable only to feminists,
and expressed concern that
the straight media was being
used as a tool to further
alienate the women's move-
ment. Her personal analysis
supports FEN's pursuit of
“practical solutions to practi-
cal problems,” i.e. concrete
means of attaining power,
growth and expansion, as
illustrated by the Women’s
City Club project.

Intrinsic to the structure of
each federal credit union is the
function of the supervisory
committee to ensure the ac-

NOW Western Regional Conference Convenes

V.P. McConnell

The Western Regional Con-
ference of NOW was held
April 9-11 at Stouffer's Inn in
Denver. In her keynote
address, National President
Karen DeCrow highlighted
major concerns for NOW on a
national level: action to
support the ERA and abortion
rights. She also reemphasized
a position on issues which she
has taken since her election in
October, that many of the
questions NOW addresses will
not make the organization
publicly popular. But fem-
inist issues are seldom easy to
analyze or solve, and Ms.
DeCrow seems committed that
as representative for national
NOW, she will not back away
from working on controversial
women’s concerns. Perhaps
lesbianism is the issue over
which NOW has received the
greatest response. Both with-
in and from without the
organization, opinion has been
to either ignore lesbianism or
sideline its importance within
any program. In 1976, NOW
had done neither, adopting
instead at the national con-
ference in Philadelphia a
priority resolution with bud-
geted funding for work on the
Bella Abzug gay rights bill.
Other significant points
made by DeCrow dealt with
unity: (1) that as women,
whatever our other labels or
proclivities, we all share the
discrimination of various kinds
of stereotyping; (2) that while
the feminist movement has
singular concerns which need
our focus and energy, the
cause of ending discrimination
and inequality tends to inter-
relate movements at work
within the country today; and
(3) that while dissent is
healthy, we must pay atten-
tion to our method and avoid
trashing sisters, i.e., attack
the issue, not a woman on one
side or another of the issue.
This last point served to draw
attention to the conference
theme: “Lean on me, I am
Your Sister.”

Dottie Lamm, Rep. Pat Sch-
roeder and Denver NOW
chapter President Frances
Lively also offered welcoming
remarks to those attending the
conference. Primary achieve-
ments of the conference in-
cluded election of officers and
adoption of resolutions. Ser-

Synopsis of Resolutions

1. Support for the L.A.
Coalition of Women Truck
Drivers

This resolution pledges
Western Region support
(and aid in disseminating
information) for an L.A.
coalition which is interested
in organizing a country-wide
union for women in the
truck-driving industry.
Specific goals of the coali-

tion include job referral,
helping women obtain Class
1 licensing, collecting and
analyzing the experience of
women truck drivers to
aggressively initiate action
on all levels to end dis-
criminatory practices.

2. Action to Support the
Equal Rights Amendment
Outlining specific directives
which will help those
working in states where the
ERA is not ratified, this
resolution suggests:

a. fund-raising ideas
b. joining “Freedom
Writers campaign

c. designing chapter ban-
ners to send to Illinois for
their Mobilization March
d. making a constant effort
to educate the public and
raise consciousness on
ERA, both the state amend-
ment and the national.

3. Household Violence/
Battered Wives
Recommended in this reso-
lution: that Western
Regional chapters commit
themselves to the study
of the connections between
pornography, sexual vio-
lence, censorship, obscenity
and the increasing backlash
against women and child-
ren in our society. When
this study is complete, this
issue should come before
the next full convention
of NOW as a topic for
serious discussion, with
future-action orientation.

A fourth resolution adopted
was an endorsement of sup-
port from NOW for Mary Jo
Risher, who is presently fight-
ing a lesbian mother child
custody case in Dallas. Ms.
Risher appeared at the
Lesbian Caucus Friday night,
in several Lesbianism-Sexual-
ity workshops, and addressed
the Sunday general session.
Her story is yet another
example of the “injustice of
justice.” Mary Jo was told
point blank by the jury hearing
her case that she was found to
be a fit mother, but that any
home without both a male and
female model for a child is just
not adequate. It would seem
that Mary Jo’s lesbianism was
actually on trial and the jury’s
verdict also invalidates the
possibility of whole parenting
by any single parent, lesbian
or not.

Although the ERA and les-
bianism were at the forefront
of Western Regional issue
concentration, workshops of-
fered throughout the 3 days
varied enough to answer many
areas of need: Women in
Prison, Consciousness-Rais-
ing, Ageism, Displaced
Homemakers, Race and Class,
Oral Communications and
Public Speaking, Implications
of Feminism on the American
Economic System, Chapter
Organizing in Rural Areas,
etc. In the Self Defense
workshop, a male reporter was
asked if he would like to help
demonstrate the crotch kick
technique. He hastily declin-
ed.

Perhaps most indicative of
the conference theme in action
came Saturday night, when
members were “womanized”
(rather than merely entertain-
ed) by the performances of Ivy
Bottini and the Denver
women’s band, B.S. Sugar.
Ivy, who started her career in
developing a new sense of
women’s humor two years
ago at the age of 47, presented
several comedic bits and then
finished her show with
“EVERYWOMAN” (cycled of
a woman from birth to death).
Her humor deals with experi-
ences women share but are
often unable to vocalize to one
another. And her sketches
also touch on topics not so
funny: rape, menstruation,
birth control methods.
“Everywoman” focuses on a
tragedy seen so often in
women’s lives: they give up a
dream to fulfill a “proper
female role.” I believe the
give and take between Ivy and
the audience was indeed a
“leaning process,” exchang-
ed by sisters. We of the
audience were able to lean
into her comedy and be
brought closer together in
sharing those unspoken trau-
mas of womanhood we all live
through. And Ivy leans into
feminist women for whom she
performs: “You give me the
strength to go on.”

The women-music of B.S.
Sugar managed to revive
many from “conference
slump.” Women boogied
down to their stocking feet
until 2 A.M., closing Saturday
night with a circle dance of
women, mellowed by
friendship and full of the
tiredness of accomplishment.
