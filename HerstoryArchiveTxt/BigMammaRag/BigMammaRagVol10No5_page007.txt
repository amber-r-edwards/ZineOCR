A Call To Resist - Fight The Repression

Solidarity Organization

Inserted in this issue of  
BMR is a Call to a National  
Anti-Repression Conference  
to be held in Denver May  
28-30.

The San Patricio Corps Sol-  
idarity Organization (a group  
of white supporters of El  

conference

Comité Contra La Represión  

& the Movimiento de Libera-  
ción Nacional) would like to  
extend a special invitation  
to the women's movement of  
Denver to participate in this  
conference.

There has been a lot of  
discussion not only recently,  
but for many years in the  
women's movement around the  
question of racism. About  
how to build a movement that  
is responsive to and support-  
ive of the needs of all wo-  
men (excluding those of Nan-  
cy Reagan's class), not only  
in the U.S., but internation-  
ally. Many of us began to  
deal with racism by coming  
to grips on the personal le-  
vel: our fears, the myths we  
have been taught, guilt,  
feelings of superiority, etc.  
We feel the time has come,  
and is in fact overdue, to  
carry this process to a pol-  
itical level.

Many radical feminists have  
concluded that “our" econo-  
mic system (capitalism/  
imperialism) & the govern-  
ment that serves its needs  
prevents the possibility of  
any complete & lasting lib-  
eration for women. This fact  
is even more evident to the  
millions of Third World  
people whose nations are  
colonized through U.S. in-  
vestments & political & mil-  
itary intervention. Today,  
many Third World people within  
the U.S. view their histories  
& current situations as very  
much like those experienced  
by their sisters and broth-  
ers in the rest of the world.  
Their very existence as  
peoples is threatened in  
ways which white people have  
not experienced. For example,  
police terror is a part of  
daily life. 2,000 Third  
World people have been mur-  
dered by police in the past  
5 years. In Denver, a  
Chicano/Mexicano celebration  
at La Raza Park was attacked  
& tear-gassed by police last  
year. This would never hap-  
pen at Cheeseman. (A city  
park in Denver's oldest weal-  
thy neighborhood) Massive cut-  
backs in social services are  
mainly affecting Third World  
people. Sterilization of Black  
women is over 20%, and for  
Puerto Rican women almost 40%.  
Jails are filled with Black  
youth who face an unemployment  
rate of nearly 50%. The inner cit-

ies are being “reclaimed"  
by the corporations & middle  
class whites in a process very  
similar to the relocation of  
millions of South Africans to  
Bantustans (designated areas  
of the country, similar to the  
reservations Native Americans  
are forced onto). Only here  
there is no plan for what is to  
become of Third World people,  
like those in our own "Capitol  
Hill". (A gentrified neighbor-  
hood in Denver)

There has been much concern  
expressed in the women's move-  
ment that it has remained in  
vast majority a white movement.  
Many attempts have been made to  
“reach out" and bring Third  
World Women into the movement.  
But we feel it is just as, if  
not more important, to develop  
principled relationships to  
those women who will continue  
to work within their own sep-  
arate movements for national  
liberation, to support  
these movements both materially  
and politically.

What's in it for us? It's not  
"wrong" to ask that question.

Very few of us are moved to  
give our time and energies to  
this risky business of changing  
the world without feeling a  
“personal" connection, or feel-  
ing it will "work". We believe  
if we come to an understanding  
of imperialism as the vehicle  
that allows the patriarchy to  
continue, then we can begin to  
see the importance of Third World  
movements that are currently  
leading the fight against that  
system, many on the level of  
armed actions and people's war.  
And who are also fighting for  
an alternative: socialism.

It is very true that attempts  
to create socialist societies  
have suffered setbacks & de-  

feats (such as the Soviet Union).

But while imperialism still  
dominates the economy of the  
world, that shouldn't surprise  
us so much. We shouldn't be  

so quick to see things in  
terms of people's bad motiva-  

tions, power trips, “low”  
consciousness, etc. We feel  
that asking for guarantees  
only leads us ultimately to  
passivity & cynicism. Parti-  
cipation is the key to a suc-  
cessful outcome, but we must  
be aware that the goals, &  
priorities of Third World Women  
will often be different than  
ours.

Those of us who participa-  
ted in the "mixed" movement  
of the sixties have spent a  
lot of time analyzing how  
that movement failed women.  
We have spent a good deal  
less time analyzing how white  
people failed Third World strug-  
gles. The intense repression  
those movements experienced  
was very different than  
what we experienced. Many of  
us also (think back on your  
friends) dropped out of the  
movement entirely, or had  
the option of going back to  
school or getting a ful-  
filling job, etc. Those dif-  
ferences continue today.  
Predominantly white movements  
(such as the women's & anti-  
nuclear movement) simply  
aren't experiencing the same  
types of repression, al-  
though the growing trend to-  
ward fascism could reverse  
the picture.

Finally, this conference  
represents the alliance de-  
veloping among national lib-  
eration movements inside the  
U.S. This alliance is based  
on a common goal--the destruc-  
tion of U.S. imperialism,  
and the right of Third World  
people to establish their  
own independent and socialist  
nations on the lands stolen  
& colonized by the U.S. It  
is also based on a common  
strategy to achieve this goal:  
people's war.

We hope white people will  
participate in this conferen-  
ce not as outsiders supporting  
someone else's needs, but as  
allies with a common vision  
of change & strategy to  
achieve it.
