A Better Job: Just what  
does that mean? For most  
women, it means a healthier  
paycheck, better benefits,  
some responsibility at work,  
some job respect. In return  
for their contribution to the  
labor market, women are held  
in dead-end jobs, concentrated  
in the lowest-paying job  
categories, passed over for  
promotion, and denied many  
of the benefits men obtain.  
Many of the clues to the lower  
earning power of women come  
from the occupations they  
hold.  

Better Jobs for Women  

THE YWCA OF METROPOLITAN DENVER  
US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR  

Funded by the U.S. Dept. of  
Labor, Better Jobs for Women  
is an outreach program de-  
signed to recruit, counsel, and  
place women into apprenticeships  
and other on-the-job training  
programs in the skilled trades  
and blue collar occupations.  
Placement is concentrated in  
four general trade categories:  
building and construction,  
industrial, mechanical/tech-  
nical, and moving vehicle  
operation. Carpentry, truck  
driving, meat cutting, welding,  
warehousing, machine shop work,  
and operating heavy equipment  
are illustrative occupations of  
placement.  

If you are a woman living in  
the Denver metropolitan area  
who wants to switch from an  
unskilled, low paying, menial  
job to learning a skilled trade,  
you should contact the Better  
Jobs for Women office to  
explore options which might  
be open to you. Your first  
step will be to attend an  
orientation session which will  
provide you with information  
on different skilled trade jobs,  
work conditions, entry re-  
quirements, and attitudinal  
challenges. If you remain  
interested after attending or-  
ientation, an interview with a  
counselor will be arranged to  
select a trade direction based  
upon your interests and quali-  
fications. A work station is  
available to provide interested  
women with a work sampling  
involving physical require-  
ments, building materials,  
and tool use common to trade  
work. Tutoring is provided to  
assist applicants to pass trade  
entrance examinations and  
aptitude tests as necessary.  
No fees are charged. Due to  
having a small staff, we work  
by appointment only.  

May 1976 marks the comple-  
tion of five years of operation  
for Better Jobs for Women,  
during which 350 women have  
been placed in nearly 50  
different trade occupations.  
Approximately 60% of the  
placements have been minor-  
ity women; some 40% have  
been heads of families. The  
average starting salary for  
trainees during the current  
fiscal period is $4.92/hour  
with potential earnings to  
$6.00-$10.00/hour.  

Better Jobs for Women oper-  
ates from the perspective that  
the itch to switch careers on  
the part of many women  
cannot be considered a phen-  
omenon. Economic equality  
and employment opportunity  
for women are clearly matters  
of survival. BJW’s special  
focus is increasing job options  
for women in the skilled trades  
on an equal work, equal pay  
basis.  

In this respect,  

Woman to Woman Feminist  
Bookcenter  

2023 E. Colfax Ave.,  

ph. 320-5972  

It is really misleading to call  
Woman to Woman a Book-  
center—not that it isn't a  
bookstore, but that it’s much  
more. Besides offering a wide  
selection of feminist literature  
(Many of the center’s books  
are available nowhere else in  
Colorado), posters, and mis-  
cellany; it also features wom-  
en's art items, serves as a  
meeting place for many  
groups, sponsors events, and  
just generally serves as a  
women's center for the Den-  
ver Community.  

Some events and workshops  
which have happened recently  
or will be happening in the  
near future include: work-  
shops on self-health, rape and  
self-defense, organizing, and  
feminist propaganda. There  
have also been special work-  
shops with Meg and Ginny of  
Olna Records on Politics and  
Women's Music, and with  
Saita Russ on Feminist  
Science Fiction Writing.  
Some recent events have been  
a Pay or Play Night, a Great  
Women Out of Herstory Cos-  
tume Party, and a Women's  
Culture Night featuring local  
woman performers.  

Groups which meet in the  
center's space include some of  
the classes of Woman to  
Woman school, a lesbian  
mother’s rap group, and a  
lesbian Alcoholics Anonymous  
group.  

The center is without doubt  
the best place in town for a  
new woman to go to find out  
what's happening in the com-  
munity, to track down groups  
with which she might wish to  
work, or to just meet other  
feminists. And while she's  
here she just might find a  
book that she’s been looking  
for.  

The center is open Tuesday  
through Saturday from 10AM  
until 8PM.

Denver, CO 80204  

Dotty Jacobus at 355-0413  

***Women in Colorado: Hidden  
Faces*** is a project funded  
through the YWCA of Metro  
Denver. The two staff people  
and a network of volunteers  
are now doing research which  
will result in a touring graphic  
exhibit on the social history of  
Colorado women. Through  
the exhibit, a brochure, and,  
in some communities, public  
discussions, the hidden con-  
tributions of women in our  
state’s history will be high-  
lighted.  

There are plans for a fund-  
raising event this summer and  
help with it would be appre-  
ciated, as well as the contri-  
bution of photo collections and  
help with research. Statewide  
participation is being sought  
so if you want to help out write  
to them at the above address.

Woman to Woman School  

2023 East Colfax, 320-5972  
(basement of the Woman to  
Woman Bookstore)  

The Woman to Woman School  
was created in the fall of 1975  
to provide a feminist learning  
space for the women of  
Denver. Teachers are viewed  
as resource persons who are  
willing to share their skills in  
small, woman-centered  
groups. Students with an  
interest or need to learn these  
skills are given a participatory  
learning environment condu-  
cive to their doing. Now in its  
third quarter of operation,  
weekly courses or weekend  
workshops cover a variety of  
subjects: backpacking for city  
folk, women in music, small  
press publishing, creative  
dance, massage, photo-  
graphy, political theory/fem-  
inist revolution, woodworking,  
lesbian literature, softball,  
feminist science fiction. Tui-  
tion is sliding scale based on  
personal income with a mini-  
mum, $0.50 charge to a maxi-  
mum of $20.50 (workshops  
half price). The school is  
staffed by a volunteer collec-  
tive of three (Sue Haymes,  
Kathy Barriga, and Ginny  
Reilly); tuition fees cover cost  
of rent, utilities, publicity, and  
printing.

Clara Brown Chapter  
ph. 421-4589 or 423-4255  

NATIONAL  

The Denver area has two  
NOW chapters, the Denver  
chapter with offices in the  
central city and the Clara  
Brown chapter in a western  
suburb, Arvada.  

Denver NOW has between  
450 and 500 members, 95% of  
whom are women. Its main  
priorities are “working on the  
passage of the ERA and  
increasing the membership of  
the chapter.” However, the  
women of Denver NOW are  
also active in many other  
areas, with task forces wor-  
king in such areas as ageism,  
consciousness raising, Legis-  
lative lobbying, and women in  
prison.  

Like national NOW, the  
Denver chapter defines itself  
as reformist in nature. NOW,  
in the words of a Denver  
chapter member, “believes in  
the American system."  

Clara Brown NOW is an off-  
shoot of the Denver chapter of  
NOW. Begun because  
“women were tired of driving  

Big Mama Rag

Denver, CO 80206  

Since you presently have a  
copy of Big Mama Rag in your  
hands, you probably know  
something about it as a local  
women’s resource. But just to  
remind you of what your  

monthly issue of BMR will  
generally include, we cover  
local, regional, national and  

international news. We fea-  
ture monthly columns (includ-  
ing Struggle and Chocolate  
Water’s purportedly humor-  
ous column), reviews and  
articles on women’s culture,  
(sometimes) poetry, inter-  
views, in-depth feature stories  
(including a regular series on  
Politics of Health), editorial  
comment, help services lis-  
tings, free classifieds (and  
cheap ones to businesses),  
short news capsules called Hot  
Briefs and a monthly feminist  
calendar of events.  

Aside from our newspaper  
functions, we offer the com-  
munity a number of other  
services. We hold monthly  
cultural programs which serve  
as benefits for Big Mama Rag.  
We help sponsor, and some  
BMR collective members work  

for an hour and a half to get to  
meetings, the Clara Brown  
chapter presently numbers  
between 70 and 100 members.  
Task forces exist on such  
things as prostitution and the  
media.  

Regular membership in  
NOW currently costs $15 per  
year of which $10 goes to the  
national organization and $5 to  
the local chapter. Member-  
ship is available to students,  
those on welfare, and retired  
persons for $8 per year ($5 to  
national and $3 to local), or, if  
a woman is short of money,  
she can join just the local for  
$3.

green/black, or blue/black  
Big Mama Rag t-shirts.  

A few reminders. Copy

12th of every month and  
critique meetings are every

is again open. (See BMR:  
Where We're At, this issue).
