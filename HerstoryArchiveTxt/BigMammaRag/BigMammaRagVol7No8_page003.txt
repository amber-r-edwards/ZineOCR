Exploring Feminist  
Cultural Politics  

Dear Sisters of BMR,

Hi, I am a feminist poet and  
journalist from New York City, and  
I'm writing to tell you how much I  
enjoyed your June issue. I felt you  
were dealing with important economic  
issues. I found Janet Sergi's "The  
Exciting Eighties" very helpful in  
clarifying economic conflicts we  
are all experiencing. I admired your  
guts in sharing your own economic/  
job/system conflicts in “BMR Talks  
About Money, etc." and "We're Hold-  
ing our Own, Preparing". Anyway, all  
these articles were really riveting.

But, in the long run, I feel that  
BMR's unique contribution to the  
movement has come through your ex-  
plorations of feminist cultural poli-  
tics. Connie Perenyi's article,  
"Compromised Colorado Women in the  
Arts Month", for instance, certainly  
describes eloquently a process which  
has occurred nationally in the femin-  
ist arts/cultural movement; this co-  
optation has seldom been discussed in  
public. I also really appreciated  
your decision to make public your de-  
bate over whether to print an ad for  
The Joy of Lesbian Sex. I learned a  
lot (about the way commercial publish-  
ers push stereotypes, among other  
things) from the points you made.  
It's really important, I feel, that  
these contradictions/compromises be-  
tween financial need and politics get  
discussed/debated in print--despite  
cries that it's unsisterly--this  
bringing out is crucial to the sur-  
vival of a now heavily co-opted femi-  
nist artists' movement, and I'm  
really glad that you exist to do some  
of this bringing out.

The subject of co-optation brings  
me, inevitably, to the question of  
Marina Franchild's article. I feel  
very strongly that BMR did the right  
thing in publishing "What Can Femin-  
ists Afford?", and that the debate  
it stimulated raised crucial ques-  
tions about elitism in the movement.  
I agree with Ann Leffler's letter a-  
bout the censoring mechanism which  
can get set up in collectives around  
controversial articles; I also feel  
that you should continue to print as  
many articles questioning the status  
quo in the movement as you possibly  
can. While I do think that Marina's  
tone in her article was very  
righteous, I still believe that the  
questioning of elitism she was doing  
was vital. (One might wish for it  
to be more emotionally distanced, but  
(personal note) since I know Marina  
slightly, and know that righteousness  
is a part of her, I doubt she would  
have been able to write or rewrite  
that article any other way.) In any

Alix Dobkin Makes  
Changes  

Dear Women,

After more than five years in the  
record distribution business I have  
decided that it is time to make a  
change and move on to other projects.  
Although I have gotten much pleasure  
and satisfaction from being in control  
of my own distribution, at this point  
in my life I would prefer to play  
more guitar, bass, write more songs,  
be freer to travel and to develop  
other interests more fully. And I  
have started thinking about making  
another album although I have no  
money for it, hate to think about  
raising it, and haven't yet finished  
off debts from my last one.

So, as of July 15, 1979, my record  
distribution will be conducted by  
LADYSLIPPER MUSIC, an excellent, re-  
liable women's business with whom I  
have been dealing for many years. I  
love and trust the women of LADYSLIP-  
PER and feel good about having them  
perform the distribution task which  
I have been doing since 1974.

LAVENDER JANE LOVES WOMEN has been  
recognized as a landmark in women's  
music; the first of its kind, and a  
significant resource for Lesbians  
and non-Lesbian women alike. It has  
been available only in women's and  
gay outlets: a policy which I feel  
has been appropriate until now. Due  
to economic pressures and changing  
times and feelings on my part, I be-  
lieve that this album should now be  
made available to any store which  
carries women's music. It is time  
for me to reach out to a wider audi-  
ence of women, especially in areas  
where there are no women's bookstores.  
I feel that six years is a respect-  
able length of time for exclusive  
distribution.

I am equally proud of LIVING WITH  
LESBIANS although the title with the  
shocking word in it has, I know, dis-  
couraged some women from buying it.  
Because of this unique word, I do  
not expect it to sell as quickly as  
LAVENDER JANE. When it was first  
released it carried a sticker saying:  
"This music is for Lesbians. It  
should be sold to women only and is  
not for public broadcast". Since  
then I have changed my mind about  
public broadcast and am happy to have  
any or all of it played on the air.

I feel less protective of it, less  
vulnerable about the content, and  
feel all right about its being sold  
in alternative and straight book-  
stores. There is always the chance  
that some woman will buy it and have  
her life affected positively by it,  
and so I am willing to reverse my  
position on this off-chance.

Festival.  

Dear Friends,

Come to Colorado Springs this year  
for the Women's Festival.

This is a personal invitation to  
all women in Denver and outlying areas  
to help us celebrate the Second Annual  

Pikes Peak Women's Festival on Sept. 3  

We would love to have artists and per-  
formers from outside the Pikes Peak  
Region for our day of food, fun, en-  
tertainment, and information.

We have several special events  
scheduled, including a dance per-  
formance by the Joy of Movement  
Institute.

The festival is on the University  
of Colorado, Colorado Springs, campus  
(1-25 to Nevada exit, south to Mount-  
view, east to Meadow and up the hill  
to UCCS.) We'll be there from 10 a.m.  
to 4 p.m. For more information, call  
Linda Harford at 635-0067.

Consider joining us--we'll make it  
worth the trip:

Sincerely,  
Linda Harford  

Income Tax Deductions  

Dear Women of BMR,

Hello. I have been aware of your  
bad financial situation for quite  
some time, although it has only been  
recently that I am able to support  
BMR.

I'm enclosing a check for the pa-  
per's support and I would like to do  
this on a regular basis. However, I  
need to know if I can write off this  

contribution on my taxes. Please let  
me know as soon as possible.

In sisterhood,  

Michele Guimarin  

Washington, DC  

Editor's Note: Women who are inter-  

ested in deducting their contribution  
from their income tax, should con-  
tact BMR by letter or by telephone.  

Esquire Chauvinists  

Dear Big Mama Rag,

Somehow, my name was listed on a  
mailing list purchased by the chau-  
vinists at Esquire, who attempted to  
"solicit" me with the enclosed flier.  
(This flier features a story entitled  
"The Year of the Lusty Woman: It's  
All Right to be a Sex Object Again".)

By the way, although I am incar-  
cerated, I enjoy reading BMR. Keep  
up the fine work.

Boulder Lesbian  
Network Dance  

An open letter to those who attended  
the recent BLN dance:

On July 21 the Boulder Lesbian  
Network held a first year anniver-  
sary celebration with workshops,  
picnic, and a dance in the evening.  
The dance turned out to be an unfor-  
tunate event in many ways, and one  
which I and the rest of the planning  
committee regret. But, one of the  
ways we grow is by learning from  
our mistakes.

Watering Down Issues  

Dear Big Mama Rag,

Please stop "watering down" the  
issues. You're supposed to be a  
woman's newspaper. In response to  
"A Dog's Life" (August issue, page 4)  
Males get better treatment than fe-  
males--whether they are dogs, children,  
mice, etc. If you need to fill in  
space in your paper, how about cover-  
ing women's groups, centers, indivi-  
duals who are working for women?

I have a lot to say about that  
issue and how institutionalized males  
are treated--dogs, children,  
adults, whatever but don't have time  
to write.

What I'm trying to say is leave the  
"humanitarian issues" to the straight  
groups and humanitarian groups and  
work for us--women. Stop splitting  
up females into working for others,  
"children", "dogs", "ethnic", "reli-  
gious". Female beings in any classifi-  
cation are oppressed.

Elis  

Editor's note: The above refers to  
a hot brief run in last month's issue  
that reported the findings of a  
private commission study of the spe-  
cial problems of children separated  
from their parents. One fact releas-  
ed showed that in certain states,  
the weekly government allotment for  
children in foster care is less than  
that for animals in kennels.

Big Mama Rag believes that the op-  
pression of women is linked to the  
oppression of others, and that re-  
porting pertinent information is not  
divisive, but promotes a more com-  
prehensive understanding of shared  
struggles.
