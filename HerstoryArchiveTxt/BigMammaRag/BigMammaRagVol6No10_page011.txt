Festival Committee

FROM PAGE 1

ment for the entertainment; checking
out the electricity hookups for
booths and the stage; getting the
necessary tables and chairs and keys,
etc. and so forth - a lot of major
and minor details that we had to be
working on constantly.

After a few months of meetings,
when the membership of the festival
committee had pretty much stabilized
we approached the subject of how we
would apportion the profits, if any,
from this year's festival. We knew
that we had given up two possibly
lucrative ventures, the beer conces-
sion and the dance, to other groups
and the only way we could generate
money would be through booth rentals

and t-shirt sales. With this money
we needed first to repay the ‘78
Festival Fund, considered an expense.
Then, with the profits, we needed
first to make this year's additional
contribution to the ’79 Festival Fund
and then we could divide the rest
between the members of the festival
committee. We decided to apportion
the profits as follows: 50% to the
’79 Festival Fund, $25 to AWS, and
then splitting the remainder into
thirds, one third each to Diana's
Grove, Virago and the other women on
the festival committee. You can see
the breakdown in actual figures on
the chart. Please note that the
NLFO dance was a separate production.
The NLFO did contribute $30 to the
'79 Festival Fund which appears on
the chart.

After over 3 months of weekly
meetings and lots of work, the day
for the festival finally came. Set-
ting up began at 8am and the work
continued all day till clean-up and
break-down of the booths and equip-
ment was completed, about 8pm. Our
thanks to the scores of women who

helped us during that day. We'd

also like to thank the performers
who did one more gig for free.
Thanks also to all the women and
groups who rented booth space this
year and to AWS for their support.

who turned out to celebrate with us.

So on to next year - There will be
a need next year for some other fem-
inist groups and individual women to
help organize the 6th Annual Color-
ado Women's Festival. The accumu-
lated festival files are being
stored at Woman to Woman and the ’79
festival account is being held at
the Colorado Feminist Federal Credit
Union until next April when new en-
ergy will be sought.

If anyone has any questions about
this or next year's festival, feel
free to write to me or the ’78 fes-
tival committee at P.O. Box 3024,

get two years in prison (five for or-
ganizing). Any physical obstruction
of federal government functions
(picketing the White House?) brings
a prison sentence. Further, you can-
not refuse to obey a court order to
testify or produce objects or docu-
ments, and even writing against grand
juries is illegal (see you in prison).
This bill is the beginning of the end
of our freedom to speak out against
oppression. In 1942, a German student
named Sophie Scholl was imprisoned and
later executed by the Gestapo for
printing and leafletting against Hit-
ler's cruelty toward Jews. She urged
the German people to use passive re-
sistance against the Nazi war machine.
Though her efforts did not stir a
student revolt or shorten Hitler's
rule by even one day, today she is
not forgotten at the University of
Munich. Can we afford to be silent
until we are forcefully silenced?
While the government sets up "riot"
squads and builds detention camps for
"terrorists," Nazi and rightwing
groups are springing up all over the
world. And you say to yourself it
could never happen again, or at least
not here. Then, just this morning, I
rode the streetcar down 17th to
Astro Street and there on the wall
painted in red was “Jews for Jesus"
beneath a swastika. There is no single
issue to be fought for anymore. Our
very survival depends on our ability
to overcome racism, classism, and the
male supremacy that imprisons all
peoples. As one Black woman quoted to
an audience of lesbians, "If I let
them take you tonight, surely they
will come for me in the morning." The
question we must ask, if it isn't
already too late, is do we have the
time to ask that people vote us our
rights, or do we flood the streets
together and claim them as our own.

Violence Against Women in Art

"...and they like that idea because
it makes them feel superior -

pictures really wanted.”

fetish, manipulated to be power-
less and non-threatening; and per-
haps the worst aspect is that male
artists have used our sexuality

to please themselves and other
male consumers. Men have taught

us to accept ourselves in var-
ious states of mutilation and sub-
jugation, and that is a lesson not
easily unlearned.

I have been disturbed by dealing
with all this again, and am frust-
rated that my own involvement with
women has not made these horrors,
or my own fury, vanish. But as
disquieting as it is, awareness
is the first step in changing
conditions that we have accepted
for too many centuries and glor-
ified through too many stylistic
periods.

UNLEARNING HISTORY

As a woman artist, I want to be
free of this staggering amount of
misinformation about myself and
other women; but I realize that
the only way to cleanse myself
of it is to identify the messages
that have saturated me. In looking
at traditional art, I am aware of
how we have been violated. Women
have been rearranged to fit a
