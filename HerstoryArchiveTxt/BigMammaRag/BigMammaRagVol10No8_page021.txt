RTD Lies: Union Strikes from page 3

and 4. Bus drivers in Denver
rank 16th in the nation, so
it's not that their wages
are so outlandish.

The media has also coincidentally omitted any inform-
ation on actual working conditions. Dona has spoken re-
peatedly about the stress of
being a city bus driver. Bus
drivers work very rough,
irregular schedules (set up
by the Company), all hours of
the day & night, rotating
shifts, etc. They often have
to pick up their buses at
one bus stop or terminal and

drop them off at another
that's in a totally different
area of the city...leaving
the bus driver with the mys-
tery of how to get back to
their original point, (where
they've probably left their
car to get home, or have to
wait around for up to an hour
for another bus to take them
back). There is also much
harassment of bus drivers es-
pecially on night runs. Often
Dona & other bus drivers are
verbally & physically abused.
Many bus drivers have been
attacked. Women bus drivers
have been raped. And yet, the
Company policy does not allow
for the driver's use of self-
defense, i.e.: use of mace or
weapons of any kind.

So the Union/Management
battle continues. At present
the Union has voted down RTD's
last proposal, despite RTD's/
Kimball's threats to hire
new workers (scabs). But the
Union's still going strong &
the workers are sticking to-
gether. SEN]

* So where do women fit into
all of this? All over the
place! Women comprise about
20-30% of the bus drivers,
40-50% of the bus washers, the

majority of the clericals &
7 out of 200 mechanics.
The Company repeatedly sup-

ports & encourages sexism. The
positions at RTD that are held
primarily by women (clericals)

have wages of 4 the amount of

the traditional male positions
(bus drivers & mechanics). And

in this present contract pro-

posal, while company suggested

wage increases are unreason-
able for all workers, the in-
creases for clericals & bus
washers are ¼ of those for

other (mostly male) positions.
RTD is also trying to split up

Labor Unity/LNS

categories of clericals, so
they can pay even lower wages
(& benefits) to clerical help-
ers (for example) as opposed
to clerks.

While all this striking is
going on, women who have been
active in the Union on many
levels, are subjected to har-
assment by the public. At Com-
pany sites where there have
been only women picketing,
passers-by have both verbally
& physically harassed the wo-
men. It has become necessary
for men & women to picket to-
gether in order to stop the
assaults. But unfortunately,
during those times, women
picketers have often felt ali-
enated from & ignored by their
male co-workers.

There are many contradictions
for women involved in
this struggle. Of course, man-
agement blatantly is against
the women workers & shows it
in monetary & other policy
ways. But women get mixed mes-
sages from their fellow work-
ers.

Debbie Squires, who has been
Lieutenant during these strike
proceedings, has many stories
to tell about the contradict-
ions. As a Union member she

Page 26 ~ Bik Mama Rag, August 1982

started taking on a lot of res-
ponsibility before & then (of
course) during the strike.

She was appointed Lieutenant
thus her (male) co-workers are
acknowledging her work. The
men's respect for her & her
organizing skill are defin-
itely apparent. And yet once
again, the story goes....
“here I am at this meeting &
I'm typing & I thought to my-
self--as the guys are out,
having a beer & joking around
& they go..got those lists
done yet?--it's 1960 again!"

The Union also shows sup-
port for women by actively
supporting the clerical work-
ers. Larry Narey (president
of Local 1001) gave a very
long & supportive speech at
a Union meeting, clearly
pointing out RTD's strategy
to put down women through
lower wages & lower raises.
He was very encouraging of
the entire Union sticking up
for the increases for the
clericals, the Union would
not allow the Company to get
away with it!! Lots of posi-
tive responses!

And on the job daily, Deb-
bie gets lots of support &
respect for her work... after
4 years of working hard &
sometimes ignoring the men &

other times "proving" her-

self. She speaks of many of
her co-workers (mostly male)
coming to her for advice
mechanically & in terms of
Union matters, grievances,
etc. When she responds (at
times) with--don't ask me,
I'm not a Union steward--they
respond with--you will be!
But then conversations go on
in front of her face (& be-
hind her back) about how a
woman would do well as a
steward, yeah! hey! this
woman could do as good a job
as a man who's a steward &
on & on. But Debbie wants to
hear that she personally
would be a good steward &
not have to (still) hear
that the issue of a woman is
still an issue.

So there's support & then
there's no support...as Deb-
bie winds up in the middle
of a confrontation with a
fellow Union worker, during
the strike. He comes over to
the rest of the strikers &
starts screaming about secur-
ity this & that & when Debbie
approaches him to "keep it
down" ‘cause management is
right next door & the last
thing we want them to hear
is commotion among ourselves

and he's pissed that a
"girl" (sic) is telling him
what to do & why doesn't she
get back to the picket line

& she says that's what she's
doing...& he threatens her
physically (about to throw

a punch, which she blocks/
Karate) & he says no she's
not picketing & they're not
picketing, "no, they're all
standing around you & your
skinny little ass"! And once
again all the men ignore the
incident or laugh at the com-
ment...And Debbie is left
with "doing all this Union
work & suddenly I'm reduced
to a cunt".

So there are definite mo-
ments of support for women &
surely moments of sexism.

And women are always deciding
how to struggle around it.

But the major fight right
now is against the Company.
The energy goes into support-
ing & fighting for the Union.
The benefits which the RTD
workers have now are only be-
cause of the existence of the
Union. And while there are
mostly non-union jobs in the
workforce, all unions help
all workers...by making de-
mands to management & setting
decent wages, benefits & gen-
eral working conditions.
