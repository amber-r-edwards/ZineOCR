Letters Home To Mama

FWHC and FEN  
Dear Sisters,

Your coverage of the events at  
the Feminist Economic Net-  
work's conference was appre-  
ciated. It is regrettable, how-  
ever, that you chose to include  
references, and a graphic refer-  
ring to, alleged past actions of  
the Feminist Women’s Health  
Centers contained in a past Off  
Our Backs article. Our response  
to this article is enclosed, please  
print it. It is important to rectify  
the damage to our reputation  
you have so carelessly inflicted.  
Similarly, we hope you will  
clarify the working relation-  
ships of the FWHC’s, and cease  
to defame all of us for the actions  
of a few.

The Federation of FWHC’s are  
FWHC’s (Los Angeles, Orange  
County, and Tallahassee) which  
at this time, are able to work to-  
gether with shared goals and  
accountability. We have res-  
pectful relationships with the  
Detroit and Chico FWHC’s. We  
do NOT agree with the policies or  
behavior recently exhibited by  
the Oakland FWHC. It has be-  
come obvious to us that we have  
an obligation to other women’s  
groups to deal publicly with the  
actions of the Oakland FWHC  
and the Detroit FFCU, the prime  
movers of FEN, and to clarify our  
relationships with these groups.

For the past two years, the  
Detroit FWHC has had a friendly  
relationship with the Detroit  
FFCU and the Oakland FWHC,  
while taking a neutral stand in  
the ever-deepening schism be-  
tween the Federation and the  
Oakland FWHC. Recently, the

Oakland FWHC, through FEN,  
began helping to establish the  
“Downtown Women's Feminist  
Health Center”, to be housed in  

the new FEN women’s building.  
Simultaneously, Oakland FWHC  

has withdrawn all support from  
the Detroit FWHC. This is not  
only a betrayal, but an obvious  
tip-off of the Detroit FWHC’s  
name, reputation, and sweat.

Meanwhile, the Detroit  
Feminist Federal Credit Union is  
trying to extend their charter to  
include 13 midwestern states. It  
is important that the women in  
these states understand that  
this would mean that any new  
FFCU in any of these 13 states  
who want to include Self-Help  
Clinics within their field of mem-  
bership would have to be a  
branch of the Detroit FFCU.

IT IS NOT FEMINIST to try to  
control the financial resources  
of the grassroots movement in  
13 states.

IT IS NOT FEMINIST to try to  
create a clinic, with an almost  
identical name, in direct com-  
petition to an already existing  
Feminist clinic.

It is our sad duty to deplore  
these tactics of the Detroit FFCU  
and the Oakland FWHC. But,  
when we see a group of women  
being destroyed, and others’ re-  
sources potentially under the  
control of these groups, we must  
speak out to condemn these  
anti-Feminist actions.

We do sincerely hope that the  
groups responsible for the  
actions above will think ser-  
iously about them, and change.

Therapists Conference  
Dear BMR,

It is much easier to criticize a  
building, a painting or a confer-  
ence than it is to build, paint or  
organize!

I am really saddened that  
women cannot support women.  
That women cannot trust  
women. Judge each other and  
stay divided seems to be the goal  
of women today. BMR must get a  
great feeling of power from at-  
tacking other women. How  
much better it could be if ALL  
women could feel powerful be-  
cause they read BMR. I am really  
embarrassed that you chose to  
isolate yourselves from other  
women rather than raising your  
voice to congratulate any ac-  
complishment in the name of  
feminism!

As a former reporter for Time-  
Life, I need to correct a number  
of glaring inaccuracies in your  
stories about the WIAP Confer-  
ence. As a Third World Radical  
Feminist Therapist, I support all  
women no matter what their  
politics or who their bed partner  
may be. I presented a workshop  
(on Assertive Training) and  
worked my ass off because I  
couldn't afford the $40 fee. The  
first woman who volunteered to  
assist with the audio-visual  
work also received a registration  
waiver and the privilege of  
staying up most of each night  
preparing tape recorders. The  
man in charge of the Audio-Visu-  
al preparations was a volunteer  
who received no money of any  
kind and was too busy to partici-  
pate in the conference. He  
worked hard for two weeks.

There was one man who was  
paid to run his own video equip-  
ment. He was selected to do this  
work because he charged the  
smallest fee and would charge  
nothing for his equipment. The  

woman who came forward the  
day before the conference to do  
videotaping was simply too late.  
I know for a fact that every pos-  
sible means was used to save  
money on a tremendously ex-  
pensive item. Neither man in-  
volved in recording the confer-  
ence were married to  
participants.

The babysitting job for a re-  
duced fee was the only job LEFT  
a week before the conference.  
The other jobs were taken by  
people who attended the OPEN  
planning meetings and volun-  
teered their services. The job  
openings for reduced fees were  
listed to the entire membership  
in the Newsletter.

The women who were ex-  
cluded from the conference  
chose to be. Somehow rumors  
were spread that only women  
with “degrees” could attend. I  
attended with a non-degreed  
CLIENT. Neither Anne Schaef  
nor I have “credentials”. I was  
really saddened to discover that  
a friend who organizes con-  
sciousness raising groups ex-  
cluded herself because of the  
ugly and inaccurate rumors  
which she didn’t check out about  
credentials, professionalism and  
degrees.

I could write several more  
pages of rebuttal, but feel really  
weary right now. I will continue  
to support you as I am able, but  
I am disappointed that you chose  
a smaller and smaller point of  
view in your editorial stance. All  
women need a newspaper to  
read and your paper offends me  
often. I wish that I could be proud  
of BMR for its breadth and width  
intellectually and editorially.

I love each one of you anyhow.

Credit Unions  
Dear Sisters:

I have neglected to write and  
tell you what an excellent piece  
on F.E.N. (Feminist Economic  
Network) the Big Mama Rag had.  
We have tried to spread it around  
(sell copies). I feel it describes  
and analyzes the weekend and  
context better than any of us had  
been doing to date.

I, along with four others, re-  
signed from the (F.E.N.) Board in  
December. The personal an-  
tagonisms constantly were not  
worth it. However, there is a  
somewhat sizable opposition  
grouping within F.F.C.U. (Fem-  
inist Federal Credit Union of De-  
troit) “watching” with concern.  
The effort to expand F.F.C.U. on a  
regional basis has not gone  
through C.U.N.A. yet. Many of us  
expressed opposition, and a  
resolution at the annual meeting  
was closely voted on regarding  
expansion regionally.

F.E.N. has purchased the old  
Women’s City Club in a dead part  
of downtown Detroit, for “en-  
terprises” and the credit union  
offices. It’s a huge gamble — it  
may fool everyone and succeed.  
It is not accessible to hardly any  
areas of feminist support in the  
Detroit area. The Health Center  
will not go with them (last I  
heard). Should prove to be in-  
teresting.

Keep in touch.
