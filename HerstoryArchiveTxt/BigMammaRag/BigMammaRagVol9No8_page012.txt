Women who join the police
to make it less racist and
sexist are caught in a sim-
ilar contradiction. A wo-
man's touch can't sensitize
an occupying army; it only
provides the police with a
better image without destroy-
ing their repressive role.
Would anyone consider it a
victory for women to join
the Gestapo or Savak? Well,
it's not much different.

The police will never stop
rape. These brutal male sup-
remacists have no invest-
ment in the liberation of
women. Their job is to be
occupying armies in Third
World communities, and rape
has always been a weapon in
the arsenal of imperialist
troops. The rape of colon-
ized women has long been a
means of terrorizing their
whole people into submission
as the rape of African sla-
ves and the rape of Viet-
namese women during the war
will testify. When coloniz-
ed women like Joanne Little,
Dessie Woods, or Yvonne
Wanrow Swan resist this
colonial violence, they are
punished instead of their
attackers. Rape is on the in-
crease and will continue to
be as long as the US has an
interest in perpetuating male
supremacy and as long as it
needs rape and the torture of
women to contain national lib-
eration. The systematic ter-
ror of rape is designed to
keep us fearful, powerless,
anxious, and at home (where we
will still be raped).

To defeat rape, we must al-
ly ourselves with those sec-
tors of the women's movement
who are struggling to break
through this fear, and not
reinforce it by relying on
men in uniforms. We do not
think that women who call the
police if someone is breaking
in their window in the mid-
dle of the night are col-
laborators. We know there are
not always realistic alter-
natives, but we are making a
struggle about the overall
direction and strategy for
the anti-rape movement.

We must ally ourselves with
women who are struggling to
build an anti-rape movement
that allies itself with the
black liberation movement in
opposing the racist use of
the rape charge, and which
understands how the rape of
colonized women by white men

Page 14 - Big Mama Rag, August,

functions as an attack on
their entire people. We must
learn to fight back and pro-
tect each other, while sim-
ultaneously building a strong
militant anti-rape movement
that clearly sees male sup-
remacy and US imperialism as
its enemy, and that refuses
to collaborate with killer
cops.

THE CHALLENGE OF NATIONAL
LIBERATION

If we understand that a to-
tal transformation of oppres-
sive roles in this society will
never be possible under the
current system, we need to
look at what's successfully
challenging the US already.

If we understand clearly who
our enemy is, we can also
understand who our allies are.
We think that national liber-
ation struggles are leading in
the destruction of imperialism
because these nations bear the
brunt of its plunder and gen-
ocidal conditions; because they
know that the only way to de-
feat a system that is upheld
by military might is to destroy
it through a strategy of peo-
ple's war, because they have
used that strategy and won,
time after time.

In the words of Puerto
Rican P.O.W. Haydee Torres:
"There's no way you can fight
an enemy like the US if it's
not protracted People's War.
Because all you have to do is
look around the world, and
you'll be able to see that
when people rise up and people
fight, that there is no stop-
ping them."

Because Puerto Rico is in
the early stages of develop-
ing people's war, we have been
pushed to see how this strat-
egy leads to both a political
and a military victory. The
armed clandestine groups of
Puerto Rico are taking the
struggle out of legal channels
and exposing the vulnerability
of US imperialism to the Puer-
to Rican people. For a nation
that is militarily intervened
and under the economic and
cultural control of the US,
the destruction of nine US
bombers worth $45 million dol-
lars by the MACHETEROS is
graphic proof that the empire
is not invincible. The stance
of the captured P.O.W.s has
revealed the reality that the
colonization of Puerto Rico
isn't an act of God, but the
result of a war declared by

1981

the US, a war that the Puerto
Rican people can fight and win.
On the other hand, by accept-
ing the empire's terms, legal
and electoral strategies re-
inforce the very legitimacy of
the colonizer that people's
war directly challenges.
People's war means mobiliz-
ing old and young, men, women

"When People Rise Up And People Fight,

and children to understand the
enemy's vulnerability, to
learn how to collectively as-
sume the tasks of waging war,
to begin organizing a new soc-
iety that meets people's needs.
People's war cannot be won
without the full participation
of women, a fact that has tran-
sformed the lives of millions
of women around the world who
have defined their struggle
for liberation as part of
their nation's struggle
against imperialism. They
understand that there can be
no women's liberation while
their children die of malnut-
rition, their natural resour-
ces are stolen, their people
are imprisoned and tortured.
Male supremacy is challenged
when these women break out of
traditional and colonial forms
of male supremacy by fighting
side by side to defeat a com-
mon enemy, by taking on new
responsibilities as health
workers, teachers, and farmers
to ensure their people's surv-
ival, by struggling to become
political leaders and cadre.
The participation of women
changes the basis for the long
struggle for women's liber-
ation. Women begin to be seen
not as subservient and depen-
dent, but as crucial and pow-
erful comrades in the struggle
of their people. While
people's war was still being
fought in Zimbabwe, a Zimbab-

Credit Lost
see, in the liberated areas,
are already taking leading
roles; they are the ones po-
liticizing people in the co-
mmunities. A long time ago it
was unheard of to have a girl
stand outside and protect a
family, but right now these
girls are protecting the
liberated areas. When the
enemy comes there, they are
the ones who go out and fight
and so the people in the com-
munities are learning to de-
pend on women and look up to
women for protection and
leadership."

People's wars that have
been successful and those
that are being waged now are
not fighting to create a new
capitalist system. They are
fighting for socialism: a
society collectively organiz-
ed around people's needs. We
do not pretend that socialism
will be an immediate answer
to women's liberation or the
end of "patriarchy" as we
know it. Socialism is not an
impossible utopian dream
where life is perfect, but
rather, it is a possible re-
ality that we can build, one
that will contain imperfec-
tions and require on-going
struggle. Revolutionary soc-
ieties will have to struggle
continuously to truly trans-
form human relationships. Nor
do we think that women's lib-
eration should wait until

movement

There Is No Stopping

the revolution is complete.
The struggle for women to
participate fully in the re-
volutionary process, and
against all forms of male
domination within the revol-
utionary movements, will lead
to a future society that will
continue to struggle for wo-
men's liberation.

JUST WHO ARE OUR SISTERS?

The women's movement has
made important gains in the
last 15 years, many of which
are being rolled back with
the increasing move to the
right. Can we afford to con-
tinually view our liberation
as a separate issue from op-
pressed peoples, and is it
right to do that? If we look
at South Africa and imagine
for a minute what it would
mean for white South African
women to fight exclusively
for their rights as women
while ignoring (at best) or
supporting (at worst) the
fascist white settler regime
that has created apartheid;
we can clearly see that such
a movement would be reaction-
ary and ineffective. It isn't
really very different here in
the US, where white people
are directly and indirectly
reaping the benefits of im-
perialism's control over
Third World people. We need
to put our struggle as women
into the larger perspective
of what the majority of the
women in the world are fight-
ing for.

The earlier stage of the
women's movement used the ex-
pression, "Sisterhood is pow-
erful." But do we want to be
sisters to white women like
Jeanne Kilpatrick, Phyllis
Schlafly, and Nancy Reagan,
who support genocide against
colonized people? Do we want
to be sisters to women mayors
like Jane Byrne and Diane
Feinstein, who encourage po-
lice brutality against Third
World peoples? Or do we want
to be sisters to the revol-
utionary women throughout the
world who are fighting for
their lives, their nations'
lives, and the lives of their
children? Do we want to build
a women's movement that is
content to let things stay
the way they are with the ex-
ception of a better job or a
little more freedom for a few
white women? Or do we want to
build a women's movement that
participates in the worldwide
struggle against imperialism?

Most women reading this
article can easily respond:
"Of course I identify more
with Assata Shakur than Nancy
Reagan." But we need to be
sure that what we actually do
is consistent with what we
say. Take the example of the
recent anti-rape week in San
Francisco sponsored by Mayor
Diane Feinstein. Many women
here in San Francisco under-
stand Feinstein as a leading
force behind killer cops who
attack Third World and gay
people, and yet many of these
same women helped publicize
the events and then joined
her on the platform when she
spoke, talking about how
honored they were to have
Feinstein there speaking
against rape. Why are we
hanging on to the idea that
we need women like Feinstein
to legitimize our struggles?
They can't help us to defeat
what they've sworn to defend.

This system which is based
on the colonization of Third
World people and relies on
the oppression of women to
uphold it can and must be
destroyed. We can build a
strong, anti-imperialist
women's movement that under-
stands who the enemy is, and
aligns itself with those
struggles that are deliver-
ing the sharpest blows to
that system. We can educate
ourselves about imperialism,
and about the developing
people's wars against it. We
can fight against the legal
lynching of black men at the
same time as we fight
against rape. When fighting
for abortion rights, we can
also fight against the ster-
ilization of Third World
women as a form of genocide
against their people. We can
oppose the state's efforts
to recruit women into the
police and the military, and
we can refuse to collaborate
with the police or the
legal system in our efforts
to liberate women. We can
take on actively supporting
the Puerto Rican Independence
Movement, the Black Liberat-
ion Movement, and all the
struggles inside and outside
of the US for national lib-
eration and socialism.

Above all, we can commit
ourselves to total change,
not just fighting for a big-
ger slice of the pie. We can
follow the revolutionary ex-
ample of women fighters like

them.”

Haydee Torres and Assata
Shakur, who have dedicated
their lives to the fight for
liberation, and who are abso-
lutely committed to winning
that fight. Puerto Rican
Prisoner of War, Haydee Tor-
res says: "It's a reality
that our struggle is a ser-
ious struggle...It's about
committing yourself. It's not
about saying, 'I'm going half-
way'...It's about going all
the way. Because if you don't
go all the way there's no

way that we're going to be
able to win.”

Revolution in the US is pos-
sible. The process is begin-
ning in our lifetime. Our
militant participation in

building revolutionary strug-
gles will hasten the end of
imperialism and the destruc-
tion and death it causes to
the earth and to millions of
people throughout the world.
We can begin to lay the basis
for a society where the
continuing struggle for true
women's liberation can and
will take place.

Open Letter To Feminists

Judy Bussie
Janine Bertram

We are writing this arti-
cle to challenge the reac-
tionary politics of the Bay
Area women's newspaper,
Plexus. This paper presuma-
bly sees itself as a "pro-
gressive" pre-women's liber-
ation paper. But it has ex-
isted for eight years focus-
ing on such issues as sado-
masochism and "lookism,"
fundamentally ignoring the
deeper concerns and basis
for the oppression and liber-
ation of women. Plexus cur-
rently prints pro-police
articles, including police
recruitment advertisements,
as well as a steady stream
of anti-Cuban, anti-com-
munist articles, all the while
rejecting the criticisms of
many Bay Area women to print
material by and about women
in revolutionary struggle.

Never was their position
clearer than this month when
Plexus refused to print an
urgent article by Haydee
Torres, one of the 12 Puerto
Rican Prisoners of War, who
is presently incarcerated in
Federal Prison here at Plea-
santon. This article dis-
cussed the hunger strike
that she and her compañeros
initiated in response to the
government's kidnapping of
one of the compañeros,
Alfredo Mendez. The article
also presented part of the
statement of Alfredo's fami-
ly calling for and explain-
ing the need to end the
strike. In place of the arti-
cle submitted by Haydee,

Plexus printed a small blurb
concerning the hunger strike.
They lifted their informa-
tion from a press release and,
without consulting her, from P.O.W. Torres' article.
They then credited the brief
news blurb to "press re-
lease" and "Pleasanton In-
mates!" The article was not
submitted by Pleasanton in-
mates; it was submitted by
Puerto Rican independence
fighter Haydee Torres. Sub-
stituting their blurb for
Haydee's article was a frank
example of racist tokenism,
and a self-serving attempt
to maintain an appearance of
relevance.

But in fact, Plexus's re-
fusal to print this article
destroys whatever credibility
may have remained that they
were (in the words of re-
views editor Chris Orr)
“struggling for social
change and our survival."
They do, undoubtedly, strug-
gle for their own "survival"
—but not on the basis of
challenging and destroying
the system that causes op-

pression; it would appear
to be more about securing a
piece of the white (middle)
class pie.

Haydee's article had, in
fact, been solicited by Ple-
xus in the general sense that
Plexus had stated repeatedly
in print and in correspon-
dence that they wished to
open their pages to women
in prison. In response to
this offer, some of us at
Pleasanton had written sev-
