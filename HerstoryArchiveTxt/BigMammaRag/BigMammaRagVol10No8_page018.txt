books per minute can be  
printed and bound on equip-  
ment that costs into the mil-  
lions of dollars), we must  
rely on old and inefficient  
equipment. The credibility  
problem occurs when women are  
unable to recognize the dil-  
emma we are in; when they  
see our mistakes as the re-  
sult of carelessness, in-  
stead of the material prob-  
lem they are; when they see  
our higher book prices as  
the result of mismanagement  
instead of the struggle to  
be an economically viable  
shop.  

It has been our experience  
that, given the opportunity,  
women strive for excellence;  
and we feel the quality of  
work we have produced is a  
testimonial to this fact.

In spite of these dil-  
emmas, we continue to re-  
ceive support from women who  
understand the importance of  
the continuing survival of  
women-owned printshops. As  
economic times get harder,  
the support is even more  
needed and, at the same time,  
more difficult to get. These  
goals and problems are com-  
mon to all lesbian-owned  
printshops. We feel it is  
time for women to consider  
seriously the ramifications  
of not supporting these  
shops. In recent times,  
lesbians and feminists who  
want to produce books, per-  
iodicals, or pamphlets,  
have easily found cheap male  
printers to do it. Do we  
really think that in five or  
ten years this will be so?  
We have found it hard to get  
women publishers to under-  
stand that the labor of  
producing a book goes hand  
in hand with the labor of  
writing and publishing a  
book. Lesbian/feminist pub-  
lishers would find it incon-  
ceivable to publish a book  
written by a man; yet vir-  
tually all choose to have  
their books produced by men.

What does this boil down  
to: What do we hope to get  
out of making these problems  
public?

We are not asking women  
to pay twice as much to have  
their books printed by us.  
Nor can we produce the Mad-  
ison Avenue four-color slick  
covers that seem necessary  
to sell books these days.  
What we hope is that women  
will put their political  
concern for freedom of the  
press before considerations  
of ease and small economic  
gains. We're not talking  
about getting rich from  
printing; nor are we talk-  
ing about publishers not  
making a living from their  
efforts. What we are saying  
is that there should be  
enough to go around for  
everybody, and that how we  
use it is of real political  
significance.  

What we are specifically  
asking is: This is a critical time  
1. If you are a publish-  
er of books or periodicals,  
consider having women-owned  
printshops do your printing.  
It is beyond our capabilities  
at this point to efficiently  
produce large runs of 300-  
page books. Where we can be  
competitive is in the area  
of smaller books and period-  
icals, such as 100-200 pages  
and 2000-5000 copies.  
2. If you are involved  
in any women's organizations,  
ask where the letterhead,  
flyers, brochures, or post-  
ers are being printed. If  
there isn't a woman printer  
in your area who is capable  
of doing what you need, con-  
tact us for names of other  
women printers nearby.  
3. When you go into a  
women's bookstore, be aware  
of what books and periodicals  
are printed by women (look  
for this information on the  
copyright page); and know  
that the money you pay for  
that book goes directly  
back to women, all the way  
down the line. We are also  
asking women to think about  
and give us feedback on the  
following:  
1. Would you consider  
paying $.50 more for a book  
produced by women? This is a  
way for all of us to capital-  
ize our own institutions.  
2. As a bookseller,  
would you consider display-  
ing women-produced books on  
separately and explain and  
educate customers about the  
differences in prices?  

When you were together  
with, what was her name,  
Lillian, did you have other  
gay friends?

Gay Friends? Everybody I  
knew was gay. I didn't go  
around with none that  
wasn't gay. You call it  
gay, but we loved women. I  
had a good time.

Where did you live?

Where did I live? I lived  
in New York, Jersey City  
and Brooklyn and around.  
But I always was with the  
women. I wasn't with no  
man. I was with the women.  
And the woman that I hook-  
ed up with, she and I both  
happened to be both virgin  
women and therefore we had  
no contact with men what-  
ever. Why should I run  
around when I just didn't  
like men. That's one thing.  
Did you ever have trouble  
finding housing or finding  
work because you were a  
lesbian?

No. I always got away with  
murder with everything. I  
had no trouble. I got  
apartments. I didn't have  
no rooms, I didn't care  
for rooms because you can't  
do nothing in a room with  
somebody else next door  
can hear you.

How did your neighbors  
where you live react to  
you and your lover?

Nobody paid me any attent-  
ion. I treated everybody  
nicely--you know what I  
mean. They had nothing to  
do with (inaudible) on the  
same level as myself. So  
didn't have to worry about  
things.

What type of work do you  
do?

Well, I did a little bit  
of everything. I did  
housework and--I did fac-  
tory work. After I stopped  
dancing--I stopped dancing  
because you cannot dance  
and eat. See. I gave up  
the stage because unless  
you go with the men you  
don't eat. And I love to  
eat. So, therefore I went  
and took care of the kids  
and this, that and the  
other. I went on the vac-  
ation. And I always had  
money.  

Any more questions?

How old were you when you  
came out?

Well, I must have come out  
when I was eight years old.  
To tell the truth I never  
was in so I must have been  
out. Thank you very much.
