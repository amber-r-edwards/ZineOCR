the man-lover, Una the fem-
inine body clinging to the male
year that has brought her to
life.” 
This quote serves also to
underscore another point, that
of Lovat’s academic sensa-
tionalism. He tells in the first
chapter of being compelled
from beyond the grave to write
the story of the two. Having
lavished the stage with his
dedication and respect for
Troubridge and Hall, he then
speculates, in the next 216
pages, how they “did it.” He
masticates over their “lesbian
passion,” eyes protruding
over references to going to
bed early. At one point,
speaking about the constant
ill health they suffered, he
says, “...it is clear that the
sexual practices of lesbianism
induced some gynecological
woes of an unhappy kind for
which the medical treatment
can be protracted and
painful.” He finds ways to
mention “the unnatural prac-
tices of Lesbos’ inmates” time
and again.

Crossing the DMZ

The most recent publication
of the Women’s Press Collec-
tive is Martha Shelley’s book
of poems (and 3 short essays),
Crossing the DMZ. It forms a
long response to the question
raised in its first poem’s title:
“On Being Asked ‘What Do
You Do?’”

A lesbian activist who has
appeared frequently on radio
and TV, Shelley knows that
the expected answer should
smack of “mysterious and
wicked practices.” But in-
stead she reflects on how
“everyday” it all is.
Her poems deal with those

The author does have his
moments of pure literary
inspiration. In speaking about
the American painter,
Romaine Brooks, he has oc-
casion to mention her mother,
Ella Goddard. Lovat, how-
ever, refers to Ella as “Mrs.
Brooks,” ignoring the fact
that Brooks was Romaine’s
married name. In another
chapter, he constructs a case
for lesbianism as the cause of
World War I. Poor blighter
Admiral Troubridge. His
“presence of mind” was so
shattered by his wife’s rela-
tionship with another woman
that his assessment of crucial
moments was affected ad-
versely, causing him to make a
strategic blunder.

Una Troubridge entrusted
this man with writing her life
story. She wanted someone
who was trustworthy,
“honest,” someone who
would not defile their love.
Troubridge trusted a man to
write intelligently about les-
bians; she also believed in
spirits. No doubt she has
learned her lesson in the
everyday experiences—as
welfare worker, lover, hitch-
hiker, friend of a woman in
Hanoi, reader of “the poetry
of man.”

I like best the breadth of her
response to the book’s initial
question. In a powerful poem
called “The Tree of Begats,”
Shelley writes of attending a
nephew’s bris, her “track
shoes/ visible beneath a velvet
pants suit” as relatives ask
when she'll take her “turn” at
motherhood. Their well-
meaning questions underscore
the gap between her and her
“kid sister”:

Our eyes meet over a
barricade of sanctified penises
and I ask myself why
it sometimes feels like a wine
glass
crushed in my fist.

Summer Solstice Arriving June 21st

Linda Fowler

For the fourth consecutive
year, women will celebrate
summer solstice, the longest
day of the year, in New
Mexico.

The summer solstice, June
21st, was a significant date
during the time of the matri-
archies as well as in many
“pagan” (read goddess) reli-
gions. The arrangement of
the druids’ Stonehenge marks
both the summer and winter
solstice. The summer solstice
is the longest day of the sun's,
or the male symbols, domin-
ance for the year. From the
21st of June until December
21st the days become shorter
and feminine influence of the
moon increases.

As in past years, Paliza
campground in New Mexico
has been reserved for the
celebration. (See accompa-
nying map for directions.)
This year the campground
will be ours from June 18th
until June 22nd.

There will be no prearranged
workshops, but the Solstice
Committee encourages women
to bring their own materials
for whatever workshops they
may want to have. In previous
years, these have included
health, politics, music,
theatre, media, poetry, witch-
craft, and reproduction, to
name a few.

Remember to bring all food
and provisions with you, as
these will not be available in
the surrounding small towns.

Elizabeth Blackwell Broke Male Barriers As First Woman Doctor

Theresa Ducato

The entire male student body
of Geneva Medical College in
upstate New York capriciously
and unanimously voted one
day in October, 1847 to
admit a woman to study
medicine. The woman was
Elizabeth Blackwell.

Was it a joke? What kind of a
woman was she, they wond-
ered. Then they sat back and
waited with unsuppressed
curiosity and glee to see if she
would accept the challenge.
Accept it she did and went on
to do, by example, more than
any other woman to break
down the barriers against
women entering the medical
profession.

Because of financial re-
verses, Samuel Blackwell had
emigrated from England to
America in 1832 and settled in
Cincinnati when Elizabeth was
11 years old. A Dissenter by
religious conviction and an
unusual man by any stan-
dards, he insisted upon an
equal education for his sons
and daughters. The North, at
that time, was alive with the
anti-slavery issue and growing
up in this controversial cli-
mate, Elizabeth and her fam-
ily absorbed a new and
heightened sense of social
awareness.

Financial Burden
Life was hard but tolerable
for the Blackwells, a har-
monious and closely knit
family. Then suddenly
Samuel died. They mourned
this kind and highly innovative
man but no less devastating
were the financial chaos and
debts he left behind. Although
Elizabeth was not the
oldest, a good portion of the
burden fell to her.

Her two older sisters, who
had been away, returned
home on their father’s death.
Together with Elizabeth and
her mother they opened a
school in a rather
helter-skelter fashion. This
was not an uncommon thing
for families to do as a source of
income, but it proved less than
rewarding. The financial
hardships that plagued Eliz-
abeth’s early years would
never be entirely absent from
her life.

It was 1844. Marriage laws
forbade a wife to hold property
in her own right and her
earnings belonged exclusively
to her husband. And what
was the lot of the single
woman? Exploitation, smaller
earnings than men and miser-
able working conditions in
factories. She could make
clothing, go into domestic
service or be a teacher, the
latter often being a humil-
iating, dead-end vocation.
Not a pretty picture either!

Intelligent, sensitive and well
educated, Elizabeth was
keenly aware of the obstacles
in the way of a single woman
attempting to achieve a higher
goal in life. The loss of
freedom if she married was
repugnant to her; there were
few eligible men as
liberal-minded as her father.
But it was, in part, his legacy
to her as well as her family’s
support that helped her in her
struggle to become America's
first woman doctor.

Horizons Open

Her reception at Geneva
Medical College was mixed.
With the exception of some
incidents regarding her atten-
dance at anatomy classes and
humiliating snubs from the
community, she gained the
respect of her fellow students
and received her degree in
1849. But it was characteristic
of her to feel that after two
years of study, there was
much she needed to learn.
She had never performed an
operation and her knowledge
was mostly theoretical. After
a short stay in New York
where she dissected and at-
tended lectures of eminent
doctors, friends advised her to
go to Paris where there were
more opportunities.

Soon after she arrived there,
she must have questioned
their optimism. One by one
doors were slammed in her
face. From an interview with
a famous French doctor came
the dubious suggestion that
she apply for admission to La
Maternité for more hospital
experience. At first she
balked. After all, midwifery
was not her specialty; she
wanted to be a surgeon. But
when more avenues were
closed to her, she followed his
advice.

This old institution, a lying-in
hospital for poor and often
destitute women, was to give
her all the practical experience
she wanted. She found her
niche in spite of the language
barrier, the nun-like accom-
modations and daily clam-
orous routine. Not to mention
her horror at the sight of
doctors operating in blood-
stained coats on which they
hurriedly wiped their instru-
ments.

Then something happened
that was to prevent her from
achieving her ultimate ambi-
tion. While making the
rounds in the hospital, she
contracted a highly infectious
disease, purulent ophthalmia,
in the left eye. In spite of the
instant and competent care
she received, blindness re-
sulted and her eye was
removed seven months later.
More Study

After her convalescence, an
invitation to attend St.
Bartholomew’s Hospital in
London was to be the single
thread on which she hung her
hopes for further knowledge.
She studied there for a year
(1850-51) and received an
elegant letter of recommen-
dation from the good doctor
Paget. But her sense of
satisfaction must have been
short-lived when she later
learned that St. Bartholomew
swiftly closed its gates to any
possible female onslaught and
was not to admit a woman for
another hundred years.

From lack of money, the old
bugaboo, she returned to
America. Immediately upon
her arrival she sought admis-
sion to hospitals to practice
her profession. Again, the
ranks closed. Her fellow
physicians were too busy
scrambling for patients and
they were not going to provide
her with the stick to hit them
over the head. Rebuffed, she
turned her efforts to raising
money and succeeded in foun-
ding the New York Infirmary
for Women and Children.

No account of Ms. Blackwell's
life would be complete without
mentioning her contribution
toward better medical care for
the Northern soldiers during
the Civil War. In a war fought
on a scale unknown in pre-
vious American history, the
Army had no concept of
disease prevention or health
maintenance. She, along with
others, was instrumental in
establishing the American
Sanitary Commission, the em-
bryo of the future American
Red Cross and the U.S. Dept.
of Public Health.

Activism

Although she died in Eng-
land in 1910, throughout her
later years she was active on
both sides of the Atlantic in
helping women gain admit-
tance to medical schools. It
isn't necessary to evaluate her
skills as a doctor at a time
when medicine was at best
crude and unsophisticated,
but it took the medical profes-
sion 50 years to implement her
reforms on sanitation and the
importance of fresh air, diet,
and exercise for the main-
tenance of good health.

She chose a hard and often
lonely road. She was not
interested in fame or reward,
but simply wanted to be a
doctor in spite of being a
woman. Her choice of a
profession indirectly dictated
a single life wherein her
emotional needs must surely
have been sacrificed. She did
not reject marriage or mother-
hood. Being single was
simply a price she had to pay
in order to pursue a worthy
vocation.

Today, the penalties are not
as great but too often women
who choose a career and
marriage are inevitably faced
with a conflict between their
professional and private lives.
That it is possible today for a
woman to become a doctor is
no small tribute to that
courageous and humane
woman, Elizabeth Blackwell.
