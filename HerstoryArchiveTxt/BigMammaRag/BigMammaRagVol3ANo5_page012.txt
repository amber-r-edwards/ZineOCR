to gather around and begin to
work.

The small groups and
plenaries will deal with issues
like goals: what women want
from their community and why;
ways and means; what comes
out of the workshops; what
comes out of each day's
business.

Conference Site

The conference will happen at
a YWCA campsite in Penn-
sylvania, somewhere between
York and Harrisburg, and will
run from Monday, August 25
through Friday, 29th. The camp-
site sleeps 140 - 150 in cots —
sleeping bags will be necessary,
and possibly tents, too, if the
numbers swell. Food will be
vegetarian, so that all can be
accommodated cheaply. There
are separate facilities for
children. The physical realities
of keeping a large group of
women going for five days will
be shared by all: cooking, clean-
ing, organizing, childcare. And
then, so that everyone doesn’t
burn out and disintegrate,
there'll be music, dancing,
movies, sports. Here, too, events
will depend on input from the
participants themselves.
Lifesaving cards, for instance,
will be needed if the campsite
pool is to be any use.

Fantasies

The women in Miami, Florida,
have been doing a lot of talking
about where and what a
women’s community could be.
Surely, they say, our
foremothers must have lived
together, elsewhere than only in
convents. Surely there must be
something in our women's
memories of forms and systems
that have worked for us before.
Questions that will need to be
dealt with include where and
how men will fit in, and what
happens when boys, the sons of
women, become men; what kind
of economic systems would
work best within the community
itself, and between the com-
munity and its neighbors;
where the community should be
built. In wilderness or farming
country everything would have
to be developed from the roots
up; a small town would already
have houses, schools and sup-
port systems set up, and ap-
parently there are small towns
for sale in this country. Within
the community, money may not

even be necessary: hopefully it
should be possible to find other
ways of exchanging goods and
services. Economic survival of
the community as a whole would
operate just as it operates in any
small town: whatever was feasi-
ble and healthy would be
developed so that the money
that the rest of the world
demands could be generated.
There are already a great many
feminists who support
themselves through their skills
and interests. In the community,
these women could expand their
activities through collectivity,
and thus help to support all who
would live there.

Good public relations with
neighboring communities would
be essential. Probably it would
be necessary to establish a
committee whose job it would be
to present the community
favorably to the rest of the world,
and to set up trade and other
mutual support systems.

Without a doubt, the entire
project would have to be con-
ceived and realized by women. It
would be crucial that there be a
profound commitment to that
undertaking.

How would it be to live with
women every day of one’s life?
To wake up every morning to
woman world as reality? The joy
of working and living and loving
together is a strength the
vastness and depth of which we
still have little way of knowing,
except in instances which are
isolated in every sense. Ugly
patterns learned and internalized
for survival in the man’s world
will have to be left behind — a
commitment to living with
women is a commitment to lov-
ing them, is a commitment to
working together for new ways
of being. Women living in their
own community will see their
own strength reflected in the
women all around them, women
who, all by themselves, will be
holding together a real growing
community. With that sense of
strength reaffirmed in every
area of our lives, there’s no
telling how far we can go.

groups on the Denver rape
scene. Hopefully, this has changed.
BMR and the Media

Newspapers and television
stations were notified of the
protest so that more than a
handful of women could know
what happened at the meeting.
Some members resented the
presence of media and said that
there had been an agreement
made at the first meeting about
the press. BMR has had a
representative at every SAIE
meeting and this “rule” was

never discussed openly or
publicly as a policy of the ex-
change.

The popular media has a
history of distorting and malign-
ing any news coverage that is
not in their interest. See the
accounts of the meeting in the
Rocky Mountain (Spotted) News
and the Denver Post, (May 14).
Although it was a distasteful
thing to ask the media to be there
(with possibly the exception of
one T.V. station that gave good,
unbiased coverage), it was done.

Pity the Rapist
The issue has been further
distorted by the fact that the

tent quality child care within
their union. Their strategy
centers externally around
workplace organizing. They
want to do a crankie (portable
street “movie”) and publish a
union newsletter. Coalition work
is also part of their strategy.

A problem they have found is
that many feminists turn off on
the word “socialist” because of

being burned in the past by the
male left. Their strategy, as they
now see it, is to get it together
around practice... do a project
and then recruit women into an
already functioning and directed
group.

Seattle Radical Women says
they are the “oldest socialist
organization in the country.”
Their practice has been that they
were involved in the first strike
of minority and women workers
when male left groups wanted
nothing to do with it. 1400

rehabilitation program, has
graduated with a degree in
psychology last month, has
spoken to many rape groups
before and is the image of the
“reformed” rapist that rape
reform groups desperately
believe in. He proves their theory
of the “clean rape” which says
that rape is a “personal”
problem which happens when
some men weaken or are
paranoid or disturbed or reacting
to bad experiences and can be
cured by “treatment.”
Rape “Reform”

It is essential to have a
political analysis of rape and its
implications in this society to
really act on the woman-hatred
that is omnipresent. The extent
of the action taken against rape
in this city has always been of a
reformist nature. Reform actions
in themselves are not bad if they
are part of an entire action. But
this has never been the case.
The isolated things that groups
do is all that they do. There is no
analysis of why men rape that
would probably lead to the dis-
covery of some ideas and
realizations that may be too hot
for many women and men to
handle and so they choose to
ignore any analysis at all, and
criticize others who wish to do
so. Again the personal is
political, and the separation of
the two blurs the issues and
distorts the “enemy.” Con-
sciousness raising has been an

workers who walked out now
have a union. After eight years of
practice, they have a core group
now of 40.
Service Projects

Chicago Women’s Union drew
up a list of three strategic criteria
for evaluating service projects
and reforms: How does or does
not the project materially im-
prove women's lives? give
women a sense of their own
power? affect existing relations
of power? The Santa Cruz
Women’s Union is aware of the
drawbacks inherent in service
projects: they burn women out,
drain their energy, and leave
institutions basically untouched.

Service working women have
to keep fighting not to be con-
trolled by those in power, as
service projects are easily co-
opted by bureaucracies, govern-
ment funding, etc. Oftentimes
the strains of work and interper-
sonal problems make women
lose their political perspective.
As a rule of thumb, the stronger
and more effective you become,
the more hassles you get from
liberals and those in power who

may not agree with your
methods. In spite of these
obstacles, the Santa Cruz
women continue to do rape
counseling, women’s center
work, and work on a health
collective because: 1) service
projects reach women who
would not otherwise be reached,
and 2) it is difficult to integrate
service and education, but when
you can pull it off, women are
radicalized. Their criteria for
evaluating their projects are: 1)
Does the project keep long-range
socialist feminist perspective? 2)
Does the project educate politically?
3) Does the project materially improve women’s lives?
4) Does the project have broad-based
support? Is it strong enough to
deal with bureaucrats without
getting co-opted? 5) Does it cut
across lines of age, race, and
class?

When Seattle Radical Women
gave their presentation, they
passed a leaflet out saying they

close cooperation with other
alternative stores in the area
such as Sundiata Books, La
Raza, La Luz. They plan to
incorporate the needs of women

students through women's
studies programs, go to
churches, high schools and

women's bars to let women
know that they exist. Suitcases
full of books will bring the

bookstore into places all over
the city and surrounding areas.

So far most of the money to
start the store has been raised by
getting personal loans and com-
mitting personal savings to the
idea. Part of the money was
given by a Seattle feminist who
wants her loan to be recycled
back into the women’s com-
munity when the bookstore is on
its own feet.

The store will have a paid staff
that will rotate positions so that
all women will have the oppor-
tunity to be supported by the
women's community while they
work in it. Women who are on
welfare will be able to buy the
books at a 20% discount. Other
women will be asked to pay the
full price and thereby help
support a place for women to be.

The bookstore still needs a
name, money, furniture, lumber
for shelves, white paint, chairs,
spools. Send ideas, money and
love to the (tentative name)

electoral politics and told about a
black woman in Louisiana who
narrowly missed election to her
state Congress. “The next time
she'll make it.” She told the
audience to “get up off your
apathy,” and make coalitions
with all groups, not just
women's groups.

Feminism and Racism

Kennedy does not think that
black women and white women
can be sisters. “Bear in mind,
those of you who think of
yourselves as feminists, that
black people don’t have white
children. So a black woman
would not have a white woman
as a sister.” She feels that
racism is a greater oppression
than sexism, that black men can
understand feminism much
better and faster than white men
(unless there is a direct confron-
tation over a job, and then it’s
‘sibling rivalry’), that confusion
of the personal and the political
is dangerous (“they're not the
same at all. But it is hard to
define the difference and you'll
just have to have your own
dialogue to find it out.”).

Black women shouldn’t be
recruited for feminism on the
sexism of black men, she main-
tains, because white men are
just as sexist. Kennedy says that
black men and women are too
much the same and are
genetically brother and sister
“whether she’s pissed at him or
not.” The way to get black
women involved in the women’s
movement is to talk about the
racism of white women, she
concluded.

The tireless speaker main-
tained that there would probably
be no feminism in this country
today if the civil rights move-
ment had not rebelled against
racism. She feels that the es-
tablishment is playing women
off against black people and says
“you're going to get your ass
kicked if you try to get ahead of
black people.”

She urged the women pre-
sent to use their three powers,
their money, their vote, their
bodies to fight the powers that
be. And warned her audience
that “if you use them in ig-
norance of the rights of other
people that are being violated
you will prevail only temporarily.

“Bear in mind that it is not
rape if there is consent. If you
don’t consent to rape it is still not
rape because you must struggle
in addition to withdrawing con-
sent. Without struggle it is not
rape, it is just a very bad screw.”

Florence Kennedy identifies
herself as a black feminist.
