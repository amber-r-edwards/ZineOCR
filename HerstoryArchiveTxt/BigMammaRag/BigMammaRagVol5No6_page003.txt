Inexcusable

Dear Big Mama Rag:

Having spent months in evasion of
the multi-media nightmare of Farrah
Fawcett-Majors publicity, I was
horrified by your June masthead.

Your reference is doubly inexcusable:
first, Big Mama Rag is supposed to be
a feminist publication, one intended
to serve such needs of women as an a)-
ternative to the sexist popular press.
Most disturbing however is your appar-
ent lack of sensitivity to the meanings
of this ubiquitous visage. Even as a
joke, the inclusion of such cheap
exploitation in "A Women's Journal"
is a blow to the feminists who need no
further reminder of the destructive
powers of Hollywood stereotyping.

This time, you did it to yourselves!

Clippings

BMR--

Your coverage of Martha Shelley's
FEN article, Olivia's response, and
your own editorial were very useful.

We have chopped up your last few
issues for news clips--could we have
some additional copies?

Really enjoy your paper--could you
send us 2 copies each month, so we
can clip one for news, and read the
other and file it? Will send you
two oob’s if you ask.

Divisive

An open letter in response to
Barbara Bryant, Ann Daniel, and Alex
Dobkin in support of BUR:

First I would like to make clear
that the opinions I have to express
are independent of those of BMR and
my affiliation with BMR past or pre-
sent.

It is my opinion that stating that
BMR has left the ranks of the inde-
pendent women's movement by publish-
ing a discussion around socialist
feminism is not only false, but de-
visive and reactionary. It is very
distressing to me that so many women
are so fearful of a take-over by the
supposed “male left" that any dis-
cussion or incorporation of socialist
theory into feminism is greeted by a
blind reaction that these women have
in some way lessened their feminism,
lesbianism or militancy.

The fact is that BMR is still and
continues to be as independent as it
ever was. If it means anything to
you in the way of credibility, the
collective is still comprised 100%
of lesbians. The content of the
paper, if you will take the time to
look, still focuses on news features
and analysis of primary importance to
women.

BMR's politics have in fact grown
and solidified a great deal this
past year which is evidenced by the
increased number of articles such
as those on forced sterilization,
the struggles of women in other coun-
tries, and the struggles of working
class women, that recognize a larger

base of women who need "liberation"
than white middle class American
lesbians.

It is a fact that many women have
grown disillusioned by the indepen-
dent women's movement and have begun
to concentrate their energies in
other struggles. Although at this
time in history I see this trend as
unfortunate for the women's movement,
I certainly wouldn't condemn those
women or their interests. I tend to
identify with their disillusionment.

It is obvious that the lack of and
in fact, fear of socialist economic
theory (or a radical economic
theory of any kind) in the women's
movement has given rise to some very
dangerous trends, e.g. FEN and the
whole mass acceptance of the concept
of feminist businesses and profit
orientation.

We are much closer to cooptation
by the enemy (capitalist and patri-
archal system) than we are to coop-
tation by our potential allies, the
progressive socialist movement that
recognizes the need for an indepen-
dent feminist movement. The fact is
that there will not be a feminist
revolution because the lives of most
women are affected by much more than
sexism, and feminism has not ad-
dressed in a materialist and serious
way those other issues. When the
feminist movement comes to do this as
it is beginning to do: it will have
to recognize points of unity with
socialist theory.

Lesbian feminists like myself who
are trying to learn about Marxism and
socialism in general are not neces-
sarily rejecting the independent wo-
men's movement or choosing to put our
primary energies into men.

It is imperative that the community
not try to ostracize us or red bait
socialist women. This is a divisive
move which breaks down the unity
of the community and increases our
vulnerability to capitalist and
reform cooptation.

My vision of the revolution is
that women, made strong by the
independent women's movement, will
join in leadership with other
oppressed peoples against capitalism
and patriarchy. It is imperative
that women study to understand the
powers of capitalism just as they try
to share their understanding of the all
pervasive powers of patriarchy if
anybody's revolutionary visions are
to be realized. I would appreciate
responses and further discussion in
future issues of BUR.

In Struggle,
Clare Strawn

Double Issue

Our next issue will be a double
issue for August/September, dealing
with local women’s resources. It
won't be out until late August,
giving all of us here a chance to
relax, take vacations, attend the
Champagne Women's Music Festival and
generally re-charge our energies.

Big Mama Rag Vol. 5 No. 6

FEN’s Books

Dear Big Mama Rag,

For the record, I think readers of
Martha Shelley's article on FEN
should know that I do not think
Joanne Parrent "fixed" the books of
the Oakland Feminist Women's Health
Center.

She did exactly what I would have
done if I had continued bookkeeping
there. To wit, get rid of the com-
puter system which did not have
sufficient information for an audit
trail and reconstruct the books from
the original entries through the
General Ledger.

Sincerely,
Dan Marie Du Bois,
alias "Felicia Bond"

Surprised

Dear Big Mama,

I must say I was surprised but
really pleased to see a man in your
May article about the musician
Kristin Lems.

It's really a relief to me to hear
about a man doing feminist music, and
I think it politically crucial to
draw attention to men like Tim Vears
and commend them, as an example for
other men to follow; I'd like to see
more of this. Keep up the good work.

--Linda Rechter

Eureka

FLASH: Donna Levy, who has been
fighting to gain custody of her dead
lover's child for almost a year, was
awarded permanent custody of Betty
Friday, June 24 in Denver.

Donna and her ex-lover jointly
raised Betty from birth. When Betty's
mother died a year ago, Donna assumed
she would be able to keep Betty.
Betty's aunt and uncle, however,
decided that they also wanted custody.

Judge Weeks ruled that after all the
testimony, she thought that Donna was
the best guardian.

To my knowledge this is the first
time a court has awarded a minor to
a known lesbian who was not the child's
biological mother.

Watch for a complete story next issue.
