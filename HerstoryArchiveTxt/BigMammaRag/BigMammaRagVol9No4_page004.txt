Denver's Safe House Again In Turmoil:

Denver's Safe House for
Battered Women remains in a
state of turmoil. The program
was forced to close its doors
to residents in December 1980
because funds were running
out. The staff of ten women
persuaded the Board of Direc-
tors, the governing body for
the program, to keep them on
through January 1981 as fund
raisers, and the Board a-
greed. The staff and their
supporters, through a pheno-
menal collective effort,
raised the $100,000 needed
to keep the shelter going for
another six months.

Toward the end of January
problems started cropping up.
Safe House's landlord sold
the house it was renting,
but a new house was quickly
located. It was also during
this time that the Board de-
cided to restructure the
program. The staff was laid
off on January 31 for two
weeks while the house was
being renovated. The under-
standing was that they would

come back to work on February
16 to finish preparing the
house for occupancy and that
the program would re-open
about March 1.

The staff came back to work
on February 16 and on Feb-
ruary 24 the Board announced
to the staff their plans for
restructuring the program
and the job descriptions.

The new program eliminated
the crisis phone line and the
community education component
of the program. The new job
descriptions were much more
rigid and hierarchical than
before, resulting in less
comprehensive services and
the elimination of the
staff's ability to model
equal relationships among
adults. On this date the
staff was told they would

be laid off again on March
13. They were encouraged to
apply for the new positions
although there was no guaran-
tee that the present staff
would be re-hired or even
given priority in filling the

new jobs. The Board was still
saying they wanted to re-open
sometime in March although
the date was soon changed to
May 1.

With the apparent lack of
interest in retaining the
current staff one might won-
der if the Board was dissat-
isfied if not threatened by
the relatively egalitarian
and feminist manner in which
the staff operated and the
fact that this group of wo-
men had raised enough money
to re-open the badly needed
shelter when the Board had
failed to do so.

In the wake of conflicts
among the Board, the staff
and the administration, the
Executive Director, Carolyn
Agosta, resigned on March 4.
This seemed to justify the
Board's decision to delay the
re-opening until May 1. All
this time, from December
until May, battered women
are without a desperately
needed resource, despite the
fact that the Board has the
$100,000 needed to re-open,
had the new house renovated
and has the option to retain
the highly skilled staff.

At this point the Board is
planning to hire an Executive
Director who will hire the
staff and hopefully re-open
by May 1.

It is important for femi-
nists to recognize that pro-
grams such as Safe House can
be eliminated or significant-
ly weakened by a Board made
up, not of "New Rightists"
or the (im)Moral Majority,
but moderate, middle of the
road “community leaders" and
business people, such as
those who make up the Safe
House Board. The long term

future of Safe House will
probably be determined by
those people in the next

couple of months.

Analysis

Liz Lewis

What is happening now with
Denver's Safe House is simi-
lar to what has been happen-
ing within shelters all across
the country. It seems part-
icularly important, then, to
put some energy into figuring
out what has provoked this
shift away from a structure
which incorporates the ideas
of feminism.

The shelter movement, which
originally started as a grass-
roots feminist project, has
in recent years, been leaning
more and more heavily in the

direction of looking to gov-

ernment, business, and found-
ations for funding out of a
desire to provide more exten-
sive and more "professional"
services to battered women
and their kids. And, presum-
ably, to try to create a larg-
er and more stable financial
base. But these types of
funds rarely come without
strings (of one sort or anoth-
er) attached.

If an organization is depend-
ent on specific sources for
major funding, it becomes ac-
countable to those sources
to some degree. And, when
the interests of the funding
groups (the government, busi-
ness, and the wealthy) are
different from those of the
women the project is intend-
ing to support, then it is
not surprising that the sit-
uation will eventually break.
