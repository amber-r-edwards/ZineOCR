Alcoholism Program  
For Women  

The Alcoholism Program for  
Women in Los Angeles was  
recently founded as a service of  
the Gay Community Service  
Center, through funding by the  
National Institute of Alcohol  
Abuse and Alcoholism. The  
organization will have an open  
house celebration on April 26,  
1975, 12:00 noon to 5:00 p.m.  

The new program is the most  
comprehensive ever set up by  
and for women. The Program's  
services are available to all  
women, but the special  
emphasis and concern is for the  
lesbian alcoholic.  

Programs, services,  
counseling, activities and  
workshops are available in  
several areas: Information and  
Education, Self-Development,  
Vocational Rehabilitation and  
Job Placement, as well as Intake  
Counseling and a 24-hour  
alcoholism hotline service and a  
staffed recovery home.  

The Alcoholism Program for  
Women is located at 1147 So.  
Alvarado Street, Los Angeles,  
CA 90006. (213) 381-7805.  

Lesbian Conference  

The Atlanta Lesbian Feminist  
Alliance wants to initiate and  
coordinate “The Great  
Southeast Lesbian  
Conference,” but we don't want  
to control and plan the entire  
conference.  

The conference could be held  
in Atlanta and aimed at mainly  
lesbians in the South. In these  

early planning stages, the  

suggested theme is, “Building a  
Community.”  

We need your ideas, con-  
tributions, and support. If you  
have any ideas about what you  
want to do please do not hesitate  
to send us a note. Who do you  
want for a speaker? Do you want  
workshops, debates, sports,  
films, food? ... Let us know...  
DO YOU WANT A  
CONFERENCE?

Feminist Alliance, P.O. Box

Amazon Poetry  

We are inviting submissions of  
poems to Amazon Poetry: An  
Anthology, a collection of  
writing by living lesbian poets, to  
be published in the fall of 1975.  
Although we know that lesbian  
poets are writing in all parts of  
the country, we have not yet  
heard of most of these women.  
Excellent poems are going  
unread, in large part for lack of  
publishing outlets and limited  
space in those that do exist. We  
want both to open more space  

for these writers and to make  
their poetry visible to those  
presently unaware of the ex-  
istence of a vital lesbian  
literature.  

Please send poems (typed, on  
8½ x 11 paper) to Amazon  
Poetry, 496 3rd Street, Brooklyn,  
New York 11215. Include your  
name and address on each page  
of poetry you submit. If a poem  
has been published previously,  
please indicate this clearly on  
the same page as the poem  
itself, so that we can request  
permission to reprint (however,  
no special preference will be  
given to previously published  
poems). Only poems  
accompanied by a stamped, self-  
addressed envelope will be  

returned. Deadline: July 15,  
1975.  

New Alexandria Library  
Pledge Drive  

For a long time the New  
Alexandria Library for  
Lesbian women has been  
operating on a shoe-string  

budget — $20/mo. assured. It is  
nowhere near adequate for  
building and maintaining a good  
collection with vital services that  

meet needs. Please — keep  
reading and see what's  
happening...  

Library services are continually  
growing and being used ... for  
example:  

170 books have circulated. 40  
of these alone went out in less  
than two weeks during  
February and March. Book loss  
has been small; since opening  

one was not returned.  

About six books to lend when we  
opened in July last year. Today  
more than 300 books are  
available for borrowing.  

Research questions come  
from Chicago and other parts of  
the U.S...  

A woman is looking for books  
and reviews of films with lesbian  
themes. Another is looking for  
lesbian bibliographies and  
reading lists. A woman is trying to  
locate bibliographies on  
Amazons and Matriarchy.  
Another wants leads on  
researching lesbian social hist-  
ory in U.S. A woman needs  
materials on female separatism.  
Another is looking for books on  
the Lesbian Queen Christina. A  
woman who is moving needs  
contacts in Oklahoma.  

These are only examples of  
information requested.  

Can a library being used that  
much afford to operate on just  
$20 a month? Can it operate  
effectively? Can it meet needs?  
It's obvious it can't.  

The Library needs at least $50  
assured income every month in  
order to expand its holdings and  
facilities and provide better  
services. We hope you will join  
our first 6-month pledge drive.  
Pledge money will be used for:  
books and materials, corresp-  
ondence and outreach, setting  
up a comfortable and quiet  
reading area, buying badly  
needed file cabinets, helping  
with Center rent and hopefully  
saving toward helping the  
Center move to larger storefront  
so the library will have the space  
it needs and deserves. We want  
to build this library for Chicago  
but we need the money to do it  
with, 3523 No. Halsted, Chicago,  
IL 60657.  

Children’s Bibliography  

Children Are People, an  
annotated bibliography, written,  
illustrated, and printed by  
women, is available from P.O.  
Box 2428, Stanford, CA 94305.  

United Sisters Plans  
Continuance of Other  
Projects  

“Lack of sufficient funds has  
held up the publication of United  
Sisters Magazine,” says  
publisher-editor, Ginger Daire  
Reber of Tampa, Florida.  

Although the magazine itself  
is folding, United Sisters, Inc. is  
not. “Actually,” Ginger says,  
“I'm hopeful that United Sisters  
will turn this economic defeat  
into a publishing victory. United  
Sisters has some advantages  
that really need to be exploited  
on behalf of women writers. We  
have access to typesetting and  
printing equipment... our costs  
are probably lower than other  
small publications’ operations.  
Hopefully, via other kinds of  
publication ventures and the  
establishment of commercial  
typesetting and printing, we  
might be able to generate  
enough money to pay staff.”  

Plans for United Sisters, Inc.  
include publishing complete  
poetry, play and prose  
manuscripts written by women.  
“In fact,” Ginger says, “we've  
already published Natalie  
Petesch’s fine novel, The  
Odyssey of Katinou Kalokovich,  
which is in its second printing  
now, and we've also published  
the official journal of the N.O.W.  
Women in Writing Conference  
held in Bridgeport, Connecticut  
in 1974. Both books are selling  
well, and we hope others will  
send their manuscripts to United  
Sisters for possible publication  
consideration.”  

All correspondence  
addressed to P.O. Box 5984,  

Tampa, Florida 33675, and  
regrets that only correspondence  
accompanied by a S.A.S.E. can be acknowledged.  

National Women’s Music  
Festival  

The next National Women’s  
Music Festival will be held June  
10 - June 15, 1975, on the  
campus of the University of  
Illinois, Champaign-Urbana,  
Illinois.  

If you are interested in  
performing and the National  
Women’s Music Festival  
Collective has not heard you in  
one form or another in the past,  
please send a demo tape  
cassette. Concert spaces will be  
available for new people.  

Workshops will be devised  
from resources offered by all  
contributors. If you are  
interested in giving a musical  

performance or leading a  
workshop, please write,  
specifying: Name; Address;  

What workshop(s) can you lead?;  
What is your experience in that  
field?; How would you  
characterize your music?; What  
instruments do you play?; Are  
you a group?; How many?; What  
kind of musical instruments?;  
Briefly state your musical ex-  
perience.  

Being a performer does not  
guarantee financial aid, since  
some women have more  
pressing financial need and  
others less. No performers or  
workshop leaders will be paid for  
their services. The National  
Women's Music Festival has  
applied for non-profit corp-  
oration status, and is still $1,000  
in debt from last year’s festival.  
They suggest sponsoring local  
benefits to defray the expenses  
of traveling to the festival.  

The National Women’s Music  
Festival is offering the second  
festival because they believe it to  
be important, even though they  
still need major financial help.  
They are offering an hour tape of  
last year’s musical highlights for  
$5.50, available in cassette or  
reel-to-reel form (please
