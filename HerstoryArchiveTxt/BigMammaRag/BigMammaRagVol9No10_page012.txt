Through The Women’s Movement In

hand, and articulate and co-
herent about what she was
saying. With women like this
beginning to be conscious of
themselves as women, some
real fundamental changes in
the Left's view of women are
going to have to happen.

Kim: How does the Left
view women?

Andrea: Well, without ex-
ception all of the political
parties are male-directed.

Kim: Directed?

Andrea: Their central com-
mittees are all men. One of
the things that was discus-
sed at length at this meet-
ing, one of the things that
women agreed upon, was that
they wanted the directiva
of the coalition to be based
on representation from the
working committees, rather
than on the basis of elec-
tion.

Kim: Oh? Women are very
active in the working com-
mittees?

Andrea: Yes. Women are
doing a whole lot of work!
(Laughter) So with committee
representation, women would
automatically win a number
of places in the central
committee. How that idea's
going to be received, I have
no idea.

Kim: When is the next big
meeting?

Andrea: Next April there
will be a national meeting.

But the women have a lot to
do in the parties before
then. What the women are
doing, really, is putting
their feminism above their
loyalty to their parties, at
this point. They're demand-
ing space in the Left's coa-
lition newspaper, too. There
is still distrust, however,
between the women who have
left the parties earlier,
who have decided that it’s
impossible to work in party
structures, and women who
want to make these kinds of
demands. Whether these
groups of women are going to
move further apart, or whe-
ther they're going to come
closer together, I guess
depends on how the male
party members respond to
these demands.

Kim: I wonder what happens
in movements when women's
criticism of sexism is ac-
cepted and not resisted?
Maybe we'll never know.

Andrea: Probably not!

Kim: So right now, how is
the independent women's move-
ment organized?

Andrea: There is a coordi-
nating body, a Coordinadora,
for all the feminist organiza-
tions in Lima only. The Coor-
dinadora is composed of femi-
nist organizations that are
not directly connected with
political parties. Groups that
have official links with par-
ties are excluded. However,
people can be members of the
groups belonging to the Coor-
dinadora and be members of
political parties as individ-
uals.

Kim: In some ways, that's
like the situation here, where
you have an independent wo-
men's movement where a lot of
the women in it have divided
loyalties. But the struggle
is much more advanced there.

Andrea: Yes, in Peru the
left parties are so much more
broadly based in the popula-
tion that it's much more dif-
ficult to ignore them.

Kim: Can you talk about the
kind of class structure that
is in Peru? What is the situ-
ation of most women around
having money and time and
choices?

Andrea: Well, the official
statistics say that 20% of the
"economically active popula-
tion" are women. This means
working for salaries or for
pay. But everybody admits wo-
men are working more than men,
whether they get paid or not.
Some are teachers or nurses.
Others work in the fishing in-
dustry or in factories, cler-
ical or service jobs. A whole
lot are selling in the streets
doing piecework at home, or
farming, besides doing all of
their domestic work and the
childrearing, and having the
children—reproducing the
labor force. As I said, women
are becoming the major farmers.

Kim: Is farming still the
major industry?

Andrea: Yes. The coastal
farms produce for export, and
this is paid work. Women some-
times get contracted jobs do-
ing harvesting or things like
that on big farms run by the
state, but they rarely are
managers—men are. The food
that Peruvians themselves are
eating is being raised mostly
by women who are in the inter-
ior where there are not these
big mechanized farms and where
there is little paid labor.

Women are simply raising the
food and marketing it them-
selves. And this is often
their only source of some
cash, to buy shoes and things,
mostly for their children. The
communal projects they do in
the indigenous communities
don't bring them any cash
either. In the cities, lots of
women take in laundry to get
a little cash. None of these
women are counted in the
“economically active" pop-
ulation.

Kim: Are domestic workers
counted as part of the labor
force?

Andrea: Yes, they are. They
are one fourth of the women's
paid labor force, and I would
say prostitutes might be ano-
ther one fourth.

Kim: What?

Andrea: Prostitution is
legal in Peru, and the gov-
ernment has even rented out
prostitutes in remote areas
where oil pipelines are being
built.

Kim: Prostitution is legal
but abortion isn't?

Andrea: Exactly. And 90%
of the prostitutes are single
mothers. A high percentage
became pregnant for the first
time working as domestics, as
household workers. They were
fired when they became preg-
nant, and there really wasn't
very much choice for them but
to become prostitutes. Unem-
ployment now is up to 50%.
Well, this is called under-
employment, not unemployment,
because everybody is hustling
one way or another. There is
no unemployment insurance or
welfare of that sort.

Kim: How was the house-
workers movement organized?

Andrea: The particular
group that I had been working
with in Lima has become the
Comunidad Feminina de Micaela
Bastidas. Micaela Bastidas
was a heroine of the war of
independence. She organized
women to fight against the
Spanish. This group in Lima,
named after her, has now
joined a regional movement
calling for the rebirth of
the Andean Nation, which
would include Bolivia, Ecua-
dor, and Peru. They're calling
for the rebirth of the allyu
genous community struc-
ture as the basis for the
whole economy. They are part
of the Native American move-
ment which exists all across
both continents.

Kim: Are most of the dom-
estic servants Indian—native
people?

Andrea: Almost 100%. And
they have found it difficult
to work with mestizos, with
the feminist organizations,
the churches, the political
parties, and even the unions.

Kim: How is that?

Andrea: They've found that
when they organize demonstra-
tions or programs, nobody
comes but themselves, and
that they just lose their
jobs. There's only five per-
cent of them unionized, so
they've found it's a very
ineffective way. Even among
many left people—those who
have "servants," you know—
they don't hire out of the
unions.

Kim: So this is a quarter
of the paid work force of
women in Peru who has little
or no support from feminists
or from the Left?

Andrea: Well, they have
verbal support, but they're
bitter. At least in cases I'm
familiar with, they've found
that they feel more comfort-
able in the native movement,
which is very much aware of
the racism in the country
which other groups don't ful-
ly recognize. The household
workers have come to feminist
meetings and complained. They
feel enough solidarity or
whatever to do that.

Kim: Are they members of
the Coordinadora?

Andrea: There aren't any
organizations of household
workers as such that belong
to the Coordinadora. There
are individual women who do.
There is a connection, but
it's not an easygoing rela-
tionship.

Kim: What about cultural
differences?

Andrea: Because these are
native women, they're also
concerned about preserving
their culture, and not suc-
cumbing to the assault from
the alienating culture of
the cities, which is also
colonial culture, North
American culture. Every Sat-
urday night they have a
dance group, where they in-
vite their friends and learn
dances from all over the
country. By now they have
become so good at dancing
that they're able to go out

international

and entertain different
groups and bring money into
their community. This is
their main source of money
because household workers
receive practically nothing
in wages. So it's been a way
to preserve their cultural
pride as well as to provide
support for their group.
Most of the women are by now
single mothers, and they're
just in the process of form-
ing some sort of collective
way of bringing up their
children. So far they're
still taking their babies
with them to work, or leav-
ing them with somebody out-
side—individual solution.
But they're in the process
of trying to organize that
internally. And they're also
trying to encourage other
household workers to form
households, women's communi-
ties of the same sort they
have.

Kim: Can you list an order
of problems that women have
in Peru—I'm talking about
most women, who don't have
much money?

Andrea: Well, the biggest
problems that everybody in
Peru faces now are inflation,
unemployment, and repression,
and women share all of those
problems. It's very diffi-
cult to draw a line between
their protests against the
rising prices, the closing
down of factories, for in-
stance, or the arrest of a
union activist. It's hard
to draw a line between those
kinds of issues and a speci-
ficially feminist issue. In
a way, you know, it's no
even necessary to make those
kinds of distinctions, since
the whole feminist movement
in Peru is a left movement
anyway.

Kim: But those are their
biggest problems, survival
problems?

Andrea: Well, part of
survival is the enormous
problem of having children
and maintaining them and the
right to have control over
that whole process. We've
already talked about
abortions and contraception.
Lack of communication
between husbands and wives
is also something that
bothers women a lot. And
connected with family issues
is the fact that there are
relief agencies working in
all of the poor areas.

These relief agencies seek
to involve women and control
them. Women in poor neigh-
borhoods receive food from
the United States. Feminists
often work within Mother's
Clubs organized for relief
distribution. If you sign up
to be in a Mother's Club,
you have to sign up for so
many hours of social
services and activities
for the church, to get your
sack of groceries. And the
priests and administrators
of these agencies are very
open about playing favorites
so they pit women against
each other for a little bit
more, a little bit less, of
these things. There's a lot
of rivalry and bitterness
and competition among women
over this. Feminists and
others have worked within
those organizations, for
instance, so that women
would combine their allot-
ments of food and have a
common kitchen and feed all
their children, and the
children of the unemployed,
or whatever. And then,
they're punished. The food
is withheld and the women
can't any longer be members
of the clubs. So based on
those kinds of situations,
in some cases, you have a
break-up of the group
itself, and a new organiza-
tion forming, but you also
have a lot of disillusion-
ment and problems in continu-
ing to work politically.
When I was there this summer
women were beginning to dis-
cover that their own problems
around this were not unique.
In every single town I ran
into the same situation.

One of the meetings of the
Women's Commission I spoke
of earlier was devoted just
to this problem. There
were experiences exchanged
by women who had overcome
the problems, for instance,
by organizing a childcare
center, where women could
leave their kids a couple of
hours a day, and thereby
have a little time to do
piece work or other kinds
of work which would enable
them to buy more groceries.
The most important thing is
to make space for women to be
able to afford to rebel
against manipulation, to real-
ize they have other forms of
organization they can use to
bring themselves more bene-
fits than these relief agen-
cies.

Kim: That's really good. So
are survival including, not to be
sent to prison, or die, from
having an abortion, to be
able to feed your family,
things like this, is what
mainly concerns feminists?

Andrea: I'd say so. There's
also a concern about neigh-
borhood rape, and rape within
the family. The women don't
get assaulted on the street
in the sort of sadistic type
of backlash environment that
we have, but they do have a
big problem with rape, har-
assment at work, and wife
abuse.

Kim: Is there a lot of porn-
ography there?

Andrea: There has been porn-
ography there for a long time,
yes, but it has more to do
with the image of white wo-
men. It's connected with the
beauty queen business and
consumerism, and so on. It
really doesn't seem to con-
cern feminists as directly as
the more Spanish-type machis-
mo—machismo is the word
Peruvian women use to des-
cribe the double standard and
"masculine prerogative." Sad-
ism hasn't come into the cul-
ture via pornography in the
same way that we have that
here. What there is is an ex-
pectation men have that wo-
men expect to be teased and
raped in certain situations.
Men feel they have a right to
force themselves on women and
