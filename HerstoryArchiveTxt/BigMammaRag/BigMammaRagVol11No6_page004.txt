Low pay, long hours and un-  

safe working conditions. No  
health benefits, no child  

organizing  

care programs, not even the  
right to collective bargain-  
ing.  

Discrimination hits the  
working woman hard, but for  
the farmworker women who fol-  
low the tomato harvest across  
the Midwest, it is a kick to  
the downtrodden.  

Two farmworker women,  
Susannah Rodriguez and Berna  
Romero, were in Madison (Wisc)  
April 13 representing the  
Farm Labor Organizing Commi-  
tee, FLOC.  

Rodriguez and Romero are  
on a tour of the Midwest to  
spread the word about FLOC's  
goals, but they took time in  
a Feminist @Connection inter-  
view to talk specifically  
about problems facing farm-  
worker women.  

In a sense, the farmworker  
women are treated as equals  
to their male counterparts.  
They work side by side in the  
fields, performing the same  
backbreaking tasks. But until  
all farmworkers are given the  
dignity they deserve, it can-  
not be said there is no dis-  
crimination in the tomato  
fields.  

"In a lot of ways the farm-  
worker women are still ex-  
pected to wait on their hus-  
bands. They all work in the  
fields from maybe 5 a.m. to  
7 p.m. and then she still has  
to do her housework and cook  
the meals," said Romero, who  
is FLOC's field operations  
director.  

"The women have no time to  
rest. The time slips away  
from them," Romero said sadly  
as she noted the average life  
expectancy of a farmworker is  
49 years. Romero, herself 45,  
went on to tell the story of  
a 42-year-old woman, Paulito  
Mareno, who died last month  
of hepatitis:  

"She left nine children be-  
hind. She just never had time  
to rest and recover. We know  
she picked up the sickness  
from the drinking water in  
either a Florida or Ohio  
camp, but we haven't been

able to trace where."  

Health problems are a major  
issue for the farmworkers,  
especially for the women.  
Rodriguez and Romero both  
point out the high infant  
mortality rate and the high  
rate of miscarriages among  
the workers.  

They believe pesticides  
used on the vegetables are  
primarily to blame. Protec-  
tion for the workers in the  
fields is nonexistent and  
runoff in camp drinking water  
is common.  

Romero said the women are  
frightened about the effects  
of the pesticides on the  
young children in the fields.  
She also believes pesticide  
use is an important consumer  
issue needing more emphasis.  

"We're putting the food on  
your table," Romero said.  

"So we know what people don't  
realize about what the chem-  
icals can do."  

She tells how pesticides  
are sometimes sprayed at  
workers on picket lines.  

Once ingested, the chemicals  
cause recurring seizures.  
Paulito Mareno's husband is  
the victim of a pesticide  
spraying. Romero says he nev-  
er knows when a seizure will  
strike and that he once went  
unconscious during a demon-  
stration.  

"One of these times he's  
just not going to come around  
after the attack," Romero said  
quietly.  

She tells the story of an-  
other woman, a young mother  
of two. The woman died of  
stomach cancer in January,  
caused by pesticides in camp  
drinking water. Romero adds  
that these people are just a  
few of hundreds with similar  
stories.  

Romero said attitudes to-  
ward the farmworker woman,  
the "campesina," are begin-  
ning to change, in part be-  
cause many of the women are  
leaders of the movement for  
farmworkers' rights.  

"We're beginning to be lis-  
tened to," Romero said. “And  
men and women are working to-  
gether in this struggle just  
as we have worked together  
in the fields." However she  
cautions that what has already  
taken place is just a start.  

"The average campesina  
makes $1.96 an hour," Romero  
explained. "She works with her  
family and they are given one  
check in the husband's name."  

In the six to seven months  
growing season, the family  
must earn enough income for  
the whole year.  

Romero said the root of the  
problem is that farmworkers  
are not covered by the Nation-  
al Labor Relations Act. The  
1930's legislation guarantees  
minimum wages, gives workers  
safety protection and lays  

down child labor laws. Be-  
cause agriculture lobbies have  
been too strong, the farm-  
workers continue to be ex-  
cluded, according to Romero.  
"They need their slave labor  
to continue their big fat  
profits," she said with bit-  
terness in her voice.  

Child labor laws are not  
enforced because there are no  
day care opportunities for  
the campesina. "Mothers  
bring their infants to the  
fields simply to take care of  
them," Romero said. “By the  
time they're three or four,  
they're trying to work with  
the rest of the family.”  

Rodriguez and Romero took  
part in a picket at the new  
Capitol Center grocery store  
while they were in Madison  
(WI) to remind consumers  
that the nationwide boycott  
of Campbell's and Libby's  
products started by FLOC in  
August, 1978, is still on.  
Two thousand farmworkers  
walked out of the tomato  
fields that summer, causing  
a 30 to 40% crop loss.  
Romero estimates there are  
now 3,500 men and women organ-  
ized behind the strike and  
boycott.  

The workers are asking for  
a three-way contract with  
the processing companies and  
the farmers who hire them.  
Currently the companies set  
the prices with the farmers  
before each growing season.  
Therefore the farmers are  
limited to the lock-in prices  
and can't afford to pay the  
workers higher wages.  

"The independent farmers  
become tools of the corpora-  
tions," Romero said. "If they  
don't agree with the terms  
offered, they simply don't  
get a contract." Romero said  
many farmworkers and farmers  
are now supporting each oth-  
er. “We have to," she states,  
“because we are the two weak-  
er groups against the corpor-  
ations."  

The Campbell's company  
started exploratory talks  
with the workers and farmers  
in early 1982, but efforts  
broke down and pickets were  
renewed. Romero said FLOC  
chose to center the fight a-  
gainst Campbell's because  
the company dominates the  
Midwestern tomato industry.  
"We had 18 different brand  
names, all owned by Camp-  
bell's."  

FLOC's boycott includes  
efforts to stop Campbell's  
"labels for education" prog-  
rams. Students collect Camp-  
bell's labels which are ex-  
changed for school equipment.  
“Campbell pretends to be in-  
terested in education by ex-  
changing labels collected by  
school children for equip-  
ment," reads a FLOC leaflet.  
"However, Campbell ignores  
the education of migrant  
farmworker children who work
