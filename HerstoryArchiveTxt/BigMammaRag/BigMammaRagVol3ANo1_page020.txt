Feminists and Children  
Dear Sisters,

I am writing this letter  
because I am angry. I am angry  
at myself because I allowed my  
children and myself to get fucked  
over, and I am angry at women  
who, with total insensitivity, ig-  
nore the needs of their sisters  
who have children, and their  
sisters’ children.

Last Wednesday night, with a  
great deal of excitement, my  
children and my friends and I  
planned to go to a women’s con-  
cert. My children love music,  
but, since I am aware that after a  
given period of time they might  
become restless, I carefully  
packed a “survival kit” for them  
consisting of paper, crayons and  
little cars. When we arrived at  
the church where the concert  
was being held, my children ex-  
pressed disappointment at the  
seating arrangement. People  
were sitting in rows of chairs,  
and, being small, my children  
realized that they probably  
wouldn't be able to see much. I  
was disappointed too, for I feel  
that people are more loose and  
in touch with each other when  
they're sitting together on the  
floor. The concert started, and,  
after a while my children and the  
children of one of my friends  
began to play and draw quietly  
on the floor. My older child was  
listening raptly to Margie Adam  
because he had heard her at a  
women’s music festival in  
Champaign, and was enchanted  
with her music, particularly the  
“unicorn song.” Suddenly, two  
women descended upon us and  
“suggested” that the children be  
taken out, as they were “disturb-  
ing everyone.” My friend and I  
were stunned and intimidated  
enough to hustle the children  
out immediately. The children  
were incredibly bewildered, as  
they hadn't been making as  
much noise as some of the  
adults whispering around them.

Once out of the concert, we  
were sanctimoniously told that  
this was, after all, a concert, and  
that it was not fair to the adults  
to be disturbed by our children.

We were led to a dim, freezing  
vestibule in the rear of the  
church, and told that our  
children could play there. I asked  
if there weren't other rooms  
somewhere in the church, and  
was emphatically told that there  
were not. I later discovered that  
there were several large, lighted  
rooms downstairs that would  
have been much more comfor-  
table. The children played on the  
floor, and, after a while, a large  
number of women drifted out to  
the vestibule to smoke and talk.  
One woman asked my son why  
he was playing there and he said,  
“They made us leave because  
they said we were making too  
much noise.” The woman looked  
around incredulously and said,  
“Listen to these women out  
here; they're being noisy.  
Someone should tell them to be  
quiet!” I went back inside, and it  
was true, they could all be heard  
from inside the concert.  
Strangely enough, the two  
women who had felt perfectly  
free to banish my children were  
standing where I was, and hear-  
ing the same noise, and yet,  
neither of them had the ovaries  
to castigate adults! What an in-  
teresting message to my  
children: it is all right to come  
down on children, but not on  
adults. It is, therefore, all a  
matter of power. I had been so  
carefully trying to teach my  
children how wrong it is to seize  
power by virtue of strength. And  
I had so strongly believed myself  
that we, as feminists, were going  
to tear down all those old male  
power numbers that seem to  
keep people neatly separated by  
age, class, and race. I had ex-  
pected some support from my  
sisters in putting forth new  
values and ideas for my children.

From the time they were  
babies, I have taken my children  
with me to concerts, meetings  
and demonstrations. Sometimes  
I brought them along because I  
couldn't find or afford childcare,  
but much of the time I brought  
them because I wanted them to  
be involved in my culture and  
community. Children are con-  
stantly being bombarded with  
traditional pig values, and I feel  
that it takes a tremendous  
amount of energy on my part to  
counter all this input. I rejoice  
that my children see women  
working, fighting, changing,  
sharing, marching, singing, lov-  
ing and creating together. All I  
ask of women who consider  
themselves feminists is this: if  
you do not choose to invest  
energy into my children or the  
children of my sisters, at least  
allow us to share our lives and  
our culture with them, and  
celebrate with us as they grow to  
be strong, tender, caring  
feminists.  
Sincerely,

Fired for a Button  
Dear BMR,

To be fired from my job for in-  
equitable reasons compels me to  
write an open letter to the public,  
plus my anger.

My occupation has been a  
waitress for the last four years.  
My last place of business, and  
where I was fired, was the Pic-  
cadilly, in Denver. I started work-  
ing there in October of '74, where  
I complied to their rules which is  
you have to wear a short uniform  
with matching underwear and  
full makeup.

I was fired on January 14, not  
because of my ability but  
because I had my left nostril  
pierced and wore a small gold  
button-shaped ornament, as in  
the Indian women. I had this done  
by a doctor on Thursday,  
January 9, had worked Friday,  
the lunch and dinner shift and  
worked the following Monday  
lunch. In the course of these  
days I had not gotten one com-  
plaint from any customer and  
had received a compliment on it.  
In all this time the maitre d',  
David, had not said one word to  
me. On Tuesday, January 14, I  
came in and asked the maitre d’s  
assistant what station I had. She  
informed me that the maitre d'  
wanted her to convey the  
message that I was to take out  
the ornament or I was to be fired.  
I was fired.

The maitre d' never came to  
discuss my reasons. There are  
my own reasons and rights. My  
own individual right and the fact  
that I've been practicing an  
Eastern religion which has an  
influence on my decision. If I had  
been an Indian woman nothing  
would have been said. I see  
nothing different between my  
Indian sisters and myself. Nor do  
I see how a small ornament on  
my left nostril would hinder my  
service as a waitress.

Reactions to Survival  
Dear Big Mama!

I read that article in BMA on  
the Adventure Trails Survival  
School and that is exactly the  
sort of thing that needs to be in  
your paper. If we can give a voice  
to as many different women’s  
organizations as possible it  
means that more different types  
of women will take notice of  
BMR. This means more publicity  
throughout more different areas  
of society. Growth!

Sincerely,  
Kate Rothery,

BMR Sisters!

Opening your Dec. double  
issue was a real Christmas pre-  
sent. Most especially your article  
on the Adventure Trails Survival  
School! It was indeed exciting to  
read of women experiencing Nir-  
vana. Most people are trying to  
sell you their trip and here are  
people trying to sell us our  
Brains — sounds very good.  
Hope to hear more. Enclosed is  
$5.00 for my first year’s sub-  
scription to Big Mama Rag.

Dear BMR Women:

Thrills and excitement. Finally  
it seems some women are on the  
right track to knowing  
themselves. I’m referring to the  
letter from Filly, “Letters from  
the Mountain.” My curiosity is  
up and I can hardly wait for the  
next column. PLEASE more info  
about Adventure Trails Survival  
School.

Textile Workers  
Dear Sisters,

Just a note to let you know  
that I have asked the Textile  
Workers Union of America to  
send you their press releases as  
the feminist media are usually  
overlooked in sending out infor-  
mation. Developments in the  
textile labor field should be of  
great interest to feminists and  
may be an area in which further  
action can be taken.

There are about one million  
textile workers in the United  
States; about 80% of them are  
women. They are the largest  
group of women in factory/in-  
dustrial jobs and also the lowest  
paid industrial operatives in the  
country. Only about ten percent  
of all textile workers are organiz-  
ed as the three major companies  
(Burlington, Stevens, Deering-  
Milliken) have repeatedly  
sabotaged labor organizing ef-  
forts. Traditionally male-  
dominated as are most labor un-  
ions, the Textile Workers Union  
is experiencing a wave of rank-  
and-file feminism with more and  
more women taking leadership  
positions in their locals. The  
TWUA will not be able to win the  
battle for women textile workers  
by itself, but it seems to be mak-  
ing a serious effort.

For these reasons, I hope you  
will be able to use their releases  
in reporting news of women  
workers and that your coverage  
will generate an active response  
in the community of working  
women.

In sisterhood,

On Class

Dear Friends,

Your article, “A Working Class  
Perspective . . .” was good and  
useful. I recognized the writer's  
situation immediately, it being  
very similar to my own.

Classism is a real difficulty in  
the Women's Movement, and  
one that hasn't been faced by  
feminists often, since they have  
been understandably, and  
perhaps rightly, anxious to  
emphasize the oppressions that  
all women do share; but which  
they share in contests of class.

Your writer of the personal ac-  
count seems to think of herself  
as a “working class woman,”  
which, of course, she is not. She  
belongs to a rather large group of  
us who are D.P.s in the  
American race for upward  
mobility. I may be wrong, but I  
would guess that if she is out of  
place with the true middle-class,  
she is now equally out of place in  
a real working-class environ-  
ment, and may always have  
been, given her strong upwardly  
mobile orientation.

The chances are that you will  
never hear a real personal story  
of a real working class woman.  
The author claims that she work-  
ed hard for status and economic  
security, but that she never  
learned “communication skills.”  
What she must mean is that she  
never learned that particular set  
of socialized noises made by any  
cohesive social group, by which  
they identify each other and un-  
derstand each other (quite  
perfectly) on the basis of that  
group's particular values. No  
genuine working class woman is  
going to write for you a  
reasonably articulate article on  
her life. You may get her story as  
told to a middle-class social  
worker/sociologist/slummer,  
but you will never hear from her.  
Upward mobility to her is still try-  
ing to get all the things the mid-  
die class has had the very great  
privilege of getting sick of. I know  
you've heard that last often, but  
it’s still true. The Women's  
Movement is almost  
meaningless to her. When she  
reaches the point where she is  
able to raise her sights as high as  
liberty and equality, there is a  
strong possibility that she may  
not be interested in them.  
America is full of women and  
men who have been offered  
these luxuries and want no part  
of them. Makes them nervous.

The roots of classism and its  
mechanisms are not much  
different from those of sexism.  
The upper and middle class  
NOW member's reaction to an  
“equal” approach from a work-  
ing class woman (or from one of  
us D.P.s) is the same instant,  
gut rejection that a man has  
when so approached by a  
woman. There is the same flare  
of anger at the presumption, and  
the same disorientation at being  
confronted with an anomalous  
social situation.

Classism, I believe, was the  
factor on which the “first wave”  
of the Women’s Movement final-  
ly floundered, and may well be  
the sinking of this one, too.

Sincerely,  
Carol Hille

Thanks  
Dear Big Mama —

The “extra” dollars by way of  
contribution. If I ever get a job  
one of my best joys will be sub-  
sidizing feminist presses. Es-  
pecially I loved the articles on  
Antonia Brico and Jill Johnston.  
The latter also may help my  
mother understand my Lesbian  
sexuality and what it really  
means. Yours is truly a paper  
that is of use to the whole coun-  
try, and who knows — I may  
move to Denver sometime? At  
any rate, the letter from the un-  
mentionable creature at the  
Denver Post was enough to spur  
this subscription!

In love and gay pride —  
& Merry Christmas!

Dear Women,

Thank you very much for the  
column you gave (in January  
1975 issue) to the library. It was  
certainly a fine surprise to pick  
up Big Mama and find us there.  
We hope a lot of other women  
find us there also. Since the last  
info went out on the library a lot  
has changed — our lending  
library has more than doubled in  
size; the reference section has  
grown a great deal. Also would  
you be able to print the following  
info in your next issue: The  
library does not have tax-exempt  
status and anyone wishing  
to make a financial contribution  
must make her check out to the  
Lesbian Feminist Center, 3523  
N. Halsted in Chicago, and add to  
memo “Library Fund.” Also the 2  
publications (the reading list &  
reprint collection) have been  
temporarily delayed but are  
nearing a conclusion. Anyone  
requesting them please be  
patient.

And good luck with your  
attempts to establish a women’s  
library in Denver.
