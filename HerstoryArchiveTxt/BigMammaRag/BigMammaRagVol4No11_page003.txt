Computer Losses  
Dear Big Mama Hag -

Our backs have had a lot of  
trouble with its computer service  
since July when we stopped doing it  
ourselves. To top it off, for the  
November issue the computer people  
lost the list of our new subscribers,  
renewals, and changes of address.

We would like other feminist pub-  
lications to tell their audience of  
our/their plight since it is rather  
useless for us to tell our patiently  
waiting subscribers that they are  
not getting cobs. So, could you  
ask all women who have changed ad-  
dress, renewed, or subscribed since  
Aug. 1 to write in if they do not get  
their Nov. issue, sending an old  
label or complete address informa-  
tion including when their sub started  
and if it is a renewal or change of  
address; also include old zip!

Our computer people said, "We're  
like a nursery, if a tree turns out  
stunted, you wouldn't expect a nur-  
sery to dig it out and give you  
another one." So we're trying to  
nurture our withering mailing list -  
hope yours is prospering. Thanks  
for the help.

Our Mistake  
Dear Sisters:

I think your coverage of the Women  
in Print Conference is very inform-  
ative and very good. I have one  
complaint, though. The article  
"Women in Print Convene" was an  
exercise in discovering how impor-  
tant it is to spell words correctly  
and print things that read easily.  
So many words were misspelled, which  
I'm sure had something to do with  
the way it was typed, or else a  

male printer was sabotaging the  
article. I started out reading it,  
trying to be tolerant, but felt  
angry at the end, because my eyes  
hurt and it had taken a long time to  
read it.

I feel sure the mistakes were due  
to a lack of time or some irregular  
problem, but I advise you not to  
print anything that messed up - it  
hurts!

In love and sisterhood,  
Malorie

Editor's note: We would like to  
take this opportunity to again  
apologize to all our readers for  
the condition of our October issue.  
We wish it were as easy as blaming  
it on male sabotage, but the respon-  
sibility lies with us. We will make  
every effort to see that all future  
issues are proofed before they are  
printed.

Shortchanged  
Dear BUR,

Regarding two reviews which ap-  
peared in the November issue. Glad  
to see a review of Bertha Harris'  
book, Lover, However, in my opinion,  
the outlandish statement that "there  
are no politics in the book; only  
imaginary persons," has no basis in  
fact, even if the reviewer (The  
Snowdance, Queer) had read only the  
evolving intros to the "episodes" in  
the novel itself. Speaking of  
imaginary persons, by the way, I think it  
is the height of intellectual self-  
indulgence and/or cowardice for a  
reviewer to use a pen name in comment-  
ing on someone else's work.

The other review, "Lawyers Explore  
Feminism," seemed to be misplaced on  
the news page. At the risk of sound-

Editor's note:  

Being defensive, as I was involved in  
both the planning and the execution  
of the feminism and the law conference, I must ask--whatever happened  
to the good old news story that  
would inform a reader of who said  
what, of what issues were discussed,  
and of what came out of the confer-  
ence? Presenting the story of what  
(and by implication, who) was respon-  
sible for what shortcomings the con-  
ference may have had, and printing  
one person's opinion as some kind of  
"analysis" or news is sort of like re-  
viewing a book by simply dismissing  
the contents with "too bad the author  
can't write."

Since your readers were short-  
changed last month, I'll give you a  
news story on the conference.

Rare Chance  
Dear Big Mama,

I really appreciated your reports  
on the Omaha Women in Print Confer-  
ence. I'm very disappointed that I  
wasn't there, nor was any other mem-  
ber of our Pointblank Times collective. As one of your stories noted,  
it was a rare opportunity for women  
in the middle of the country to  
gather in a relatively accessible  
place, so I'm doubly disappointed  
we missed it.

In the article on newspapers, you  
noted that a "concrete system of  
nationwide contacts" had been set up.  
Is there a way that Pointblank Times  
could participate in that? Our con-  
tacts with our sister papers, as val-  
uable as they are, have been pretty  
haphazard up to this point. I'd  
appreciate any information you could  
transmit on this network. And, of  
course, keep up the fine work on  
Big Mama.

The system of contacts to which we referred, while  
concrete for those of us who attended  
the conference, differs from for-  

Lallo Case  

To the Editors:

In the past, your newspaper has  
published articles regarding the  
Lallo jaywalking disturbance case.  
Some people working on raising  
funds to cover court costs (lawyers'  
time, as well as defense team time,  
was donated) are scheduling a ben-  
efit. A leaflet advertising the  
benefit stated, in part, as follows:  
"Gerald Garash and Ruth Buechler,  
the attorneys for Ms. Lallo, are  
willing to be put in contempt of  
court November 3rd if Judge Close  
rules again against using homosex-  
uality as the basis of their case."  
My office telephone number was given  
as one of two numbers to phone "for  
further information." I had no role  
whatsoever in the writing, publica-  
tion, or distribution of this leaf-  
let. I have never authorized the  
use of my name with such a statement  
or the use of my telephone number  
with respect to the leaflet and ben-  
efit. I anticipated defending Ms.  
Lallo with fullest vigor and to  
argue against any matter which would  
prejudice or weaken the defense, but  
always within the bounds of the law.
