Mutation from page 19

her head up to this pro-
cession of terrible women
and find grace in the eyes
of the males of this coun-
try.”

These excerpts were chosen
to tempt you to get this
book, to read it and share
it with your friends. Sitt
Marie Rose is full of in-
sights into the war in the
Middle East and illustrates
why many of us Jewish sis-
ters are choosing to no long-
er call ourselves Zionists,
for we believe in self-deter-
mination for both Palestin-
ians and Jews in the Middle
East, and that is not what
Zionism has traditionally
been about. Zionism has
been about coercion and it's
time we started admitting it,
and stop languishing in the
"Beautiful" Lie.

It seems to me the height
of bad taste to hold a Holo-
caust memorial and an Is-
raeli Awareness week with
little or no mention of the
genocidal suffering of the
Palestinian and Lebanese peo-
ple, Semitic people like our-
selves. Shmata, a Berkeley
Jewish magazine, devotes is-
sue after issue to the Holo-
caust, yet never is there
mention of the Palestinian
people unless putting them
down. Jewish freedom fighters
of the Warsaw Ghetto are
glorified, but Palestinian
freedom fighters are viewed
as the enemy. Yet recently
the PLO representative in
Poland publicly expressed
the solidarity the PLO feels
for the Warsaw Jews who
fought the Nazis 40 years
ago, as well as those Jews

Carol Haddad, in a speech
titled Anti-Arabism pre-
sented to the National Wom-
en's Studies Association in
1982 stated the problem
most clearly—

"It is one of the greatest
ironies of our time that
survivors of the Holocaust
themselves participated in
the attempted annihilation
of the Palestinian... (and
Lebanese) people."

Semitic people have got to
stop killing each other.
Ashkenazi Jews have got to
realize that the light skin
privilege they have now in
the U.S. and Israel is an
illusion, and was bitterly
acquired through the rape
of Jewish women and the
genocide of Jewish people
in our thousands of years
living with Europeans. Now
is the time to discover our
unity with other Jews and
accept the existence of
Semitic people who happen
not to be Jewish. For the
path of Jewish exclusivism
as practiced through Zion-
ism will clearly never work,
and is leading us on the
road to disaster.

Criticism from page 4

to long standing anti-semi-
tism and persecution of the
Jewish people, but there have
been many other Jewish poli-
tical movements developed
which are more aligned with
progressive, anti-imperialist
politics.

All this will tie in with
the next section on U.S. im-
perialism, differences betw-
een racism and anti-semitism,
and resistance. We believe
we must look at the imperial-
ist, white supremacist, patr-
iarchal world power of the
U.S. and their involvement
and influence in "the Middle
East." How has the U.S. and
other imperialist powers man-
ipulated and escalated the
land/life struggle of Pales-
tine and Israel?

Seeing the U.S. so strong
in its racist genocidal pol-
icies, and looking at our
collective's racist practice
we felt it necessary to look
at the connections and diff-
erences between racism and
anti-semitism. And need to

show more of the history of

racism and resistance.

Being feminists, we also
know that patriarchy is
involved in this conflict.
Where does patriarchy fit into
all of this? When we talk of
self-determination of a peo-
ple, does the definition,
once again, really define
people as only men?

So we're working towards
an analysis that will take
all this research into con-
sideration. We expect to be
challenged on our perspective
and possibly on our informa-
tion, but realize now that
this is the only way to grow
politically. We do not be-
lieve we can cover everything
with the limited time that
we have to do research, and
also need help in sorting
through the biased information
already written. Please
start writing us once again
on these issues, with inform-
ation and analysis as this
will have to be an ongoing
endeavor, and our silence is
no more.
