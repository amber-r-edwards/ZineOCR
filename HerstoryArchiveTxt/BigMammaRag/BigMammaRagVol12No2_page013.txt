voices from our lives

Out Felt Uncontrollable— And So Am I

why it is allowed to contin-

ue. This would not be "crazy"

it would be survival. Be-
cause I feel so helpless to
do anything about starvation

--And the only way that I
can be brought back from my
"craziness" about this, I
speak of the professionals
"help", is for them to re-
teach me that starvation is
not my fault. To eliminate
my guilt of eating 2 des-
serts. I stand on the mount-
aintop, naked, and scream to
you now, that if every per-
son sitting incarcerated in
prisons and psychiatric hos-
pitals who saw the evil of
starvation were instead en-
couraged to feel their anger

and march out into the
street and stop the true
craziness of the world, we
could end starvation, I

hear you--loud and clear--
saying that is not “real-
istic". (Whatever I might be
now if out walking, I would
approach the first one to
walk by and start screaming
at them how stupid, that's a
stupid hat. You have snakes
coming out of your head. I
would start babbling about
the alphabet.) So you think
it's not realistic. It's not,
because they tell you it's
not. Things are the way they
are, because they are that
way. The powers that be are
heavily invested in starva-
tion. For us to eliminate

it we would have to take
their 9000 desserts and
spread it around. They en-
joy their privilege, they're
not going to give it up.
In fact they still want more
of the damned pie. They want
first and foremost to pro-
tect their best interests,
which is themselves and
their privilege. So what has
happened? We have police who
protect the interests of the
ruling class. We have
schools to send our children
to. It's not coincidence

that teachers must be "cer-
tified" or that you must,

by law, send your children
to their schools. They only
become certifiable when

they pass all the right re-
quirements. History is dis-
torted and what is taught

in the schools is the infor-
mation you are allowed to
have. When we catch them,
they appease us, convince

us they have changed. I re-
fer to women protesting the
lack of women shown in his-
tory.--OK- fine, sorry, it's
only a little sexist pro-
blem. Here is some "her-
story" to make you happy.
They quickly grant your
wishes, before you make the

connections and ask why
history books are full of
sexism/racism/classism/anti-
Semitism/mentalism/ageism/
and it all is still
manipulated and within
their control. Someday the
recent bombing at the Capi-
tal in Washington will be
in the history books. The
truth is not going to ever
appear though, because it
never made it as far as the
morning paper. What happen-
ed in Grenada is so fright-
ening. Government not only
manipulated the media,

they outright banned them.
And the government is so secure
in its power, their control,
that they dare to even pub-
licly (finally) come right
out and admit it. What fur-
ther proof do you need to
show how this country has
taken one giant step into
fascism/imperialism?

So the schools, the
church, get our children.
Police are there for back-
up, and psychiatry is every-
where.

I'm too depressed now to
go on here. I know I'm mid-
sentence somewhere long ago.
Aren't you impressed--I
think I've even been in your
world for awhile. Sounding
coherent, making sense (or
have I been? I have no real
judgment left).

I feel tired. I feel de-
pressed. I can barely move.
My cells, which were so ac-
tive a minute ago (or was
it an hour or 3 yrs ago?)
my cells are now dead weight.
My muscles ache, I am so
very tired, I hurt all over.
I could cry but don't have
the energy. I am exhausted
but not sleepy. I feel so
very, very lonely. I want
nothing more than to be
held. I cannot move. My dog
needs to go outside. She
will mess on the floor if I
don't go open the door. I
don't have the energy, I
don't care. What difference
does it possibly make when
I'm trying to offer solu-
tions and no one will lis-
ten. I must fight hard
against this depression. I'd
not be able to do anything
if it continues. I couldn't
write, go to work, go out,
talk to people, eat, sleep,
nothing. After awhile I
wouldn't even want to still
be held. I'd wanna be left
alone. If my depression con-
tinued and they caught me,
I'd be hospitalized. I'd be
given drugs and if that
didn't snap me out of "it",
I'd be given electroshock
therapy. All because I have
something to say and solu-

tions to offer and no one
will listen.

The heat just turned on.
That's so funny. The heat
turned on and I was cold. I
laugh. I laugh at the heat-
er. I now feel the need to
know everything there is to
know about the furnace. I
am "compulsed." I think
about going to the library.
I don't care that it's 2am.
If I broke in, I'd be caught.
The police could help me
find all the right books. I
will tell them how I need
to know about the furnace.
They'll understand. I will
be laughing "hysterically"
when I tell them I was cold
and the heat came on. I
would get quickly locked up
and feel so much confusion
trying to figure out what
their problem was. I wasn't
hurting nobody, I needed
info, why don't they see
that? I would be asked ques-
tions, what's my name, where
do I live, what year is
this? At the moment, sir, I
don't know. It doesn't mat-
ter...I need to know about

the furnace. We'd have no
problems. It's so simple...
I was cold and the heat
came on. The furnace knew
how to meet my needs,
therefore society's needs.
In my desperation I lose
track of what the questions
even were, but the solution
lies within the furnace.

I spaced on for awhile.
When I came back I see the
"N" on the page. I remember
something vague about the
alphabet that used to be
important. I had been
thinking of going to bed.
Now I want to fill up all
these pages until I reach
"Z", before I can sleep. I
see everything in the ex-
treme. I will exaggerate
everything I know. If I saw
you fixing dinner, I'd now
tell you precisely how to
set the table. I could sit
down and start writing
numbers to see how far it
all went. I'm aware there
already exists an answer to
that but it makes no sense.
I remember it, 1,2,3,4,
it'd be my contribution to
the world. I could also
mimic people. I'd be trying
to figure out what they
were doing. But it all be-
gan with the "N". I know
there's tremendous signifi-
cance about it, but I can't
remember what. I'm so
scared. I know--without
asking--that no one can
tell me about the "N". And
I know I'll get in trouble
if I talk about it, but
don't know why.

Now I'm confused. I can't
think of where I am. Some
things look familiar, some
things I swear I've never
seen before. How did that
get here? Where am I?
There's a door. I could go
through that door, and get out.
But where will I be? I bet-
ter blockade it instead. Am
I locking me in or them
out? I don't know, does it
matter? There was something
I wanted to say to you, to
write on this paper. Maybe
it doesn't matter anyway.
It had something to do with
evil. But that sounds so
religious and I think
that's funny. I know it
didn't have a religious
bone in its evil little
body. That sentence makes
no sense and isn't what I
was trying to say. Not at
all. But I'm confused and
everything seems funny. I
can't even think anymore.

I only watch the pen make
marks on this paper. If
that's what these things
have as their names. There

is nothing on this thing
and then I watch when I put
the pointed part down and
there's suddenly words
there.

I feel a driving desire
to go peek out the window.
If it looks safe I'm gonna
wander around this building
and figure out where I am.

Talk to ya later.
