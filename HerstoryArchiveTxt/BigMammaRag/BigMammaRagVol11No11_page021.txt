Women In Arms

This film focuses on the involvement of women in the
Nicaraguan revolution — from the time of the fight to over-
throw a dictatorship to the hard task of building a new
social order. The voices in Women in Arms echo with the
stories of participation in social strife the Salvadorena,
Guatemalteca, and other LatinoAmericana women have
to tell.
