The Phoenix: Evolution of an Image

Constance Perenyi

And when you call my name, oh the  
flame burns higher and higher  
And I am not the same. Oh the bird  

is risin' out of the fire.

Chris Williamson

The phoenix is a mythical bird of  
the Egyptians, also mentioned by  
Greek and Latin writers. Several ver-  
sions of its death were current. The  
wonder bird came to Egypt every 500  
or 1,461 years, built its nest, and  
died in it; a new phoenix rose from  
its dead body. The most familiar ver-  
sion is that the bird was consumed  
by fire in its nest and rose reju-  
venated from the ashes.

I am writing about the phoenix to  
soothe myself because lately I feel  
like a strong woman, I get through  
things; but I am a weak bird because  
I can not seem to fly away. For now,  
I am existing in a corner of my own  
life, scarcely illuminated - except  
for the flames of a burning past.  
Over and over, I have drawn and sti-  
tched the phoenix; and each time she  
has looked somewhat like me. And each  
time her winged body changes, growing  
more worn and scarred than the figure  
before.

The expression in the face of your  
drawing absorbs me and draws me  

into the darkness.

The blackness, the brooding, the curl  
of the lips are recessive,  

The small spots of color are scar,  
shock, neck.

Conversations with the Tooth Fairy:  
When I was five she stood at the  
foot of my bed in a dream, wearing  
an airy, blue, nylon-net gown and  
glittering rhinestone jewelry, with  
a little rhinestone coronet on her  

I recognize the point of sorrow which  
we know, and which opens to our  
return,  

I stare into the face of all that has  
not worked out in my life.

This is not fatalism, but oppression.

I am an angry Lesbian.

I am angry that I have given my blood  
to women who do not commit them-  
selves to me and women.

I am angry that this was so because  
I did not commit myself to myself,  
my self-hatred buried under the  
comfort of settled relationships,  
eschewing pain.

Now the pain is all over me, in my  

body, in the atmosphere, everywhere.

Arlene Raven, in a  
letter to artist Lili Lakich

My first phoenix was beautiful,  
carefully worked on a small grid,  
with proud breasts, angry eyes, and  
flowing hair. She was the child of  
an awakening feminist consciousness,  
an expression of my first excited  
flutters of lesbian creativity. At  
that point, everything seemed clear  
to me: the feminist, like the phoen-  
ix was capable of rising from the  
pyre of oppression. Before I de-  
fined the problem, I identified the  
solution as the simplistic need for  
a new vocabulary.

I finished the piece, but I never  
hung it.

I talk feminism  
I would give my life  
for other women's space  
and I'm a good woman  
doing what I know best:  

putting everyone else's woman needs  
before mine,  

and that makes me good,  
and that makes me lonely and  
and this makes me angry  

from my journal,  
October, 1977

My next phoenix was evolutionary.  
I drew her many times, and she be-  
came a soft sculpture in the round,  
flames feeding feathers, encircling  
a scarred body of pieced skin. As I  
was learning, you don't burn and  
emerge whole; and you don't talk  
about other women's pain and avoid  
your own. Once inflamed, my mind be-  
gan to crackle with awareness. All of  
those women I wrote about, all of the  
oppression and hurt - it was mine.

After all she said  

What difference does it make  
That's the reason I never unite  
hardly speak of what is me  

I begin to answer glibly stop  
Held myself in identical fear  
My own touch tentative  
almost an excuse-  
Like making love to someone  
for the first time  
on the third (which is always harder)  
once you begin to know experience  
another:  
the tension of your hair brown  
streaked with gray  
the lines of  
your face like wires rushing  

through  

Death brings us close to it  
Death itself =  
forgetting  

And we the living  

wanting to remember  

not wishing to be forgotten  
Separated  

from what we hold most near.  

I hold you for a moment lose you  

watch you disappear.....

from Susan Sherman,  
“Definitions”

When I first called myself a  
woman, I used the word as often as I  
could, Woman - the sound, the touch,  
the image inebriated me with the  
power of my own womanness. But, like  
the phoenix, that too has changed. I  
am no longer a dream child of desire;  
the fire is not so sweet, and I am  
unsure that I will ever be licked  
clean by its flames. But I am sure  
of one thing - the focal point of my  
feminism is myself, my own feelings.  
My anger and hurt, my dreams are my  
own. And so is the strength that  
comes from knowing that.

I am writing again after a period  
of wordful silence that has been awk-  
ward and inarticulate. And although  
it has been a long time between  
phoenixes, I am surprised how smoothly  
the shapes flow from my pen. The  
bird-woman is coming into her own,  
and I am more willing to admit that  
she is what she is: an image of me,  
a self-portrait.

A fine fire raging here on the ground  

It is burning over the peace I have  
found,  

My wings are ready to take me on high  

The heat of the flames will raise me  
to the sky.

head. Her magic wand was star-topped  
and she looked just like a Tooth  
Fairy should.

She was going to give me three  
wishes.

But I woke up.

And much later:

Last night she came again and sat  
down on the end of my bed, looking  
very benevolent, spreading out her  
blue nylon-net skirts and recalling  

to me (even though I was asleep)  
where I had seen her before - she  
was somebody I saw in a live stage  
show when I was four and I'd swear it  
was the Ice Follies because I re-  
member her in ice skates.

The Tooth Fairy: Good evening, dear  
child. I am here to help you.

Me: Look here, I'm almost forty.  
This is ridiculous.

The Fairy: Never mind. To me you  
will always be a child. Tell me what  

you want and I shall get it for you.

Me: Thanks but no thanks ha ha.  

(My standards of wit are pretty low-  
sy in dreams.)

The Fairy: Shall I restore you to  
your lost heterosexuality so that you  
may once again on the Late Late  
Show have strange and brilliant ad-  
ventures with handsome actors such  
as Buster Crabbe, Dirk Bogarde, James
