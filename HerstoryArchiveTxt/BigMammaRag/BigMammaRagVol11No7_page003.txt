letters home to mama

Support:

Dear Big Mama Rag Women,

There have been so many
times when I have thought I
should write a supportive
letter to you, in response
to a particular article, or
just to encourage you in your
ability/willingness to keep
going.

There have been other times
when I have wanted to let my
subscription lapse, because
I find my white, middle-
classness challenged. When
I don't want to look at all
the horrible things going on,
which on some level I "know"
anyway.

I appreciate the few times
you are able to include stor-
ies of women WINNING, like in
May's Hot Briefs, “Disarming
Woman." That story makes me
want to stand up and cheer.

But what it is that finally
gets me from my passive in-
ertia to the typewriter, is
your ability in the May issue
to be both supportive of pri-
soner rights AND to analyze
the situational components of
child abuse. In addition, your
analyses and attacks on the
mental health system are val-
uable contributions.

So, keep up the good work/
the wonderful work; I don't
know how you DO it!

“Womyn in Cages’
Big Mama Rag,

I would like to respond to
the label, "womyn in cages."

I've been in a cage most of
my life. There is simply no
other word to use, but cage.
I don't feel this is a dero-
gatory term, I feel this is
a sad reality.

I'd really like to hear
someone who's done thirteen
years in prisons, tell me
that they aren't caged or in
a cage.

Really, when you stop to
think for a moment, womyn as
a whole, have been in a cage
for centuries. We have been
caged by the male supremacist
culture. This doesn't imply
that we are not struggling to
free ourselves/our sisters
from the cage - why play word
games with each other when
the meaning is quite clear?
Cage, cell, incarcerated...
blipity blam...the point
being, we are trying to create

a higher level of awareness
amongst our people...I'm not
going to tell you that I'm
sitting in a room or a cell -
sister, I'm in a cage - and
I want you to be able to vi-
sualize that, understand
that...to know that I have
had to live and have seen
others forced to live like
"an animal in a cage..."
How this negates the fact
that womyn are fighting back
from within these cages, is
beyond me...Many a lion has
attacked its trainer during
rehearsal for opening night...
I've been incarcerated for
13 - no - 14 years now - and
believe me - I am a womon
that is definitely in a CAGE.
I am also a lion and I don't
go for rehearsals or trainers.

In strength/pride,

Mykki Balduff

P.S. Thank you for consis-
tently sending me your news-
letter and also - for cover-
ing areas in reference to
womyn who are in cages.

Self-Defense

Dear Friends,

Vickie Stowers Burnette is
a 22-year-old woman who is
charged with second-degree
murder in the self-defense
killing of her stepfather,
a sergeant based at Ft. Bragg,
North Carolina. Vickie's
stepfather had raped her when
she was 14 and over the years
had attempted to rape her
several other times. Vickie
lived in horror of this man

for years and no one (includ-

ing her family who had swept
the rape incident under the
rug), would come to her aid.
Roger K. Shannon, Vickie's
stepfather, was on probation
in Fayetteville, N.C. for
making harassing and threat-
ening phone calls to women in
the area and he was known to
be involved in pornography
production. Vickie's close
friend Eleanor Predmore tells
us, "Vickie and I have been
friends for 3 years, I've met
all her family and she mine.
She is from Andalusia, Ala.,
where her grandmother, sister
and father live. I stayed
with the Shannons and Vickie
for 3 months last summer. She
was living there to save mon-
ey for college. I am a human-
ist. This man told me he
loved war. He knew men who
"get off on" gutting out
enemy pregnant women. How

and why are minds like that
being manufactured???"

Back in February Roger K.
Shannon came at Vickie in a
rage, planning to rape her
then kill her. So Vickie
fought back and after being
badly beaten she pulled her
knife and proceeded to stab
him. When she left he was
still conscious and was yell-
ing obscenities at her.

Because this happened in a
small and close-knit Maine
town and because Vickie was
viewed as a non-conformist,
she was charged with murder,
though anyone can see this
as a clear case of self-
defense!!

Vickie's friend Eleanor
also wrote, "I'm so thankful
she was able to protect her-
self. She easily could have
been another woman to end up
with a cruel fate. She sur-
vived all that but will she
survive our judicial system?
A prison sentence will only
harden an already scarred
girl. She needs the support
that caring individuals can
give."

At this time Vickie is in
a psychiatric institution
for a court-ordered evalua-
tion. It seems that to the
He-Man Maine mentality a wo-
man who fights off a brutal
attack of a rapist is off in
her head.

Please! Dear people, help
Vickie in her time of great
need. It is very important
that all stand by Vickie and
carry out our determination
that we will not let such
cruelty go unanswered! Write
to Vickie today and help sup-
port her through this ordeal:

Response

Dear BMR:

After reading BMR's res-
ponse, authored by Lori, to
Lisa Vogel's latest attempt
to reply to what happened at
the Michigan Music Festival

'83 - all I wanted to do was
sit down and cry. What was
the purpose of so much re-
vealed anger? What do you
want to accomplish? I hope
that Lisa and her group are
made of stronger stuff than
me, because if I'd received
such a blast of pure hatred
and contempt for attempting
to explain myself, I know
I'd run away screaming. I'd
run so far that the "move-
ment" would never hear from
me again.

There's a lot more to say,
but I can't bring myself to
say it. No essays now. Just
want you to know how sad,
sick, and scared Lori's let-
ter left me. Where is the
will to communicate?

Sincerely,
Vivian Mayer

Looking For...

Dear Sisters,

I am writing to let you
know that two more feminists
have arrived in Colorado. My
friend Alyson and I have just
moved into a house in the
Rockies for the summer. I
promptly bought a Big Mama
at a stand by a Safeway - I
was delighted to see it there.
We are interested in getting
to the Candlelight Vigil but
have no transportation. Do
any of you have any knowledge
of people living around Cen-
tral City, Blackhawk or
Idaho Springs who could give
us a lift? We have gas money.
Even if there isn't anyone
driving down we'd love to
hear from somebody - this
town looks so homophobic that
lynching doesn't look unlike-
ly. Contact with womyn looks
to be nil here.

Please, Big Mama, drop us
a line if only to say hi.

In sisterhood,

Shanna Green
