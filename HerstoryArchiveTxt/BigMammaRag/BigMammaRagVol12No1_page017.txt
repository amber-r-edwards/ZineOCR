Reconstructing Feminism from page 14

consensus that the struggle a-  
gainst women's oppression  
had to be united with a  
struggle against imperialism,  
and that the latter re-  
quired an international  
movement. Many of us believ-  
ed that solidarity exists  
between women working again-  
st the same global structure  
of oppression and speaking  
out for women's rights with-  
in those struggles, albeit  
in different ways and con-  
texts. The organizers’ com-  
ments came as a shock. As a  
white North American woman  

I definitely came away with  
the impression that to  
choose single issues to sup-  
port Third World countries  
denied the integrity of the  
struggles of those women and  
tended to remove issues from  
context. The highly abstract  
remarks of the organizers  
served to diffuse the energy  
for concrete revolutionary  
action and confused many  
participants.

Perhaps a part of the  
reason for such disparate  
conclusions lay in differing  
views of the role of academ-  
ics. Russo and Mohanty des-  
cribed their role as "faci-  
litators of action". Many of  
us disagreed, claiming a  
necessity for academics to  
be doers as well as theorists  
or run the risk of becom-  
ing too far removed from the  
struggle to be insightful  
or effective. This "removed"  
aspect of American academia  
permeated the entire conf-  
erence. The structure of pre-  
senting papers on specific  
aspects of women's struggles  
precluded dialogue on the  
implications for organizing.  
We had no time for meetings  
to define ways of integrat-  
ing our new knowledge with  
local action, either formal-  
ly or informally. There was  
something disconcerting a-  
bout 800 women discussing  
revolution on a serene col-  
lege campus as frats played  

pranks in the courtyard. It  

made me realize how limited  

the women's liberation move-  

ment in the US is, within  
bounds that are not consid-  

ered threatening to the stat-  
us quo. The Conference ex-  
changed valuable information  

failing to deal with the ac-  
tive implications of women's  
struggles and especially in  
the US. Perhaps that is sim-  
ply a reflection of how far  
North American women have to  
go until we have the basis  
to create a really potent  
movement. Nonetheless, the  
Conference should have pro-  
vided more time for network-  
ing and developing some con-  
crete projects, or at least  
the seeds.

Paz Buttedahl expressed  
similar fears when she caut-  
ioned against "cultural voy-  

eurism" within the Conference.  

This she described as a com-  
mon malady among US academics  
examining numerous case stu-  
dies of revolution and strug-  
gles from the world over  
without ever considering the  
implications for needed ac-  

tion here in the US. Another  
participant called it typi-  

cal of "American exception-  
alism" - the idea that revo-  
lution is a good idea for  
some but could never happen  
here.

I have often wished that  
I had transcripts or tapes,  
the means of conveying the  
power and emotion in the  
words of presenters. At  
times my heart soared with  
hope and awe at the strength  
of women who had already en-  
dured pain beyond imagining  
and who still worked with  
strong hearts and wills,  

truly convinced that a day  

of victory would come for  
themselves and their people.  
This I found inspirational,  
compared to the white US  
feminist movement for whom  
victory and even real revo-  

lutionary struggle seems  

very far off. Humor in the  

face of brutality, joy and  
creativity among people in  
devising ways to save their  
lives and their children's,  

faith when massive structures  

loomed in their paths, all  

but the format took a lot of the this reduced the obstacles  
the guts out of the subject by that we perceive in our own  

work here. We cannot trivia-  
lize difference or assume  
that our visions are ident-  
ical, but we can find in  
each other strength and sup-  
port in continuing the part-  
icular struggle that has  
evolved from our particular  
context. Our responsibility  
as members of the most opp-  

ressive nation operating in  
the Third World today is  
mammoth. We cannot afford to  
ignore the struggles of wo-  
men in the Third World, we  
have so much to learn from  
all of our experiences. More  
importantly each day we put  
off attacking the imperialist  
system here we add a day to  
the suffering of millions  
throughout the world and at  
home. Time and time again,  
when a North American woman  
asked what she could do to  
support Third World struggle  
the answer was "stop the  
intervention of your country  
abroad. All we ask is to de-  
fine our own destinies".
