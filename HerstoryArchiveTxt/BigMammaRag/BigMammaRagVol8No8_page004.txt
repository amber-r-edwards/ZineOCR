**Porno Demo Acquittal**  

Three members of Womyn Against  
Violence and Pornography, a group  
prosecuted for a protest involving  
the pouring of human blood on porno-  
graphic books, films and displays at  
the Bare Facts lingerie shop in Hart-  
ford, Connecticut last February,  
were acquitted on July 22nd by a  
jury of four women and two men.  

Linda Hand, Jane Quinn, and Shell  
Wildwomoon faced charges of criminal  
mischief (a felony which carries a  
possible five year, $5,000 fine), in-  
terfering with an officer and crimi-  
nal trespass for their action on Feb-  

**IN**  

ruary 7th. Early in the trial, the  
felony charge was dropped because the  
prosecution was unable to prove that  
the women had done $1,500 damage to  
the Bare Facts store.  

The strategy of the women's defense  
was to establish two things; first,  
that pornographic materials contri-  
bute concretely to instances of rape  
and violence and second, that sellers  
of such materials have an obligation  
to take responsibility for the behav-  
ior to which their merchandise con-  
tributes. The three women represen-  
ted themselves, utilizing some backup  
assistance from attorneys at the Uni-  
versity of Connecticut Law School  
Clinic. Wildwomoon, Hand and Quinn  
testified in their own behalf as well  
as calling other witnesses to testify  
about the relationship between porno-  
graphy and violence against women.  

Among the defense's witnesses were  
Liz Denny, a 19 year old woman from  
Northampton, Mass. who testified  
about her experience of being repeat-  
edly tied up and raped by her father  
(a respected middle-class profession-  
al) during which he used bondage mag-  
azines as a guide. Also witnessing  
for the defense was Andrea Dworkin  
whose book *Woman Hating* documents  
historical instances of socially ac-  
ceptable violence against women.  
Dworkin testified that the distrib-  
ution of pornographic materials cor-  
relates directly to the incidence of  
violence against women. She used as  

**Dessie Woods**  

This November, Dessie Woods will  
be eligible for parole release. The  
National Committee to Defend Dessie  
Woods (NCDDW) is urging all support-  
ers to intensify the efforts to help  
free Dessie Woods now.  

Dessie Woods, a 34 year old black  
activist has served five years of a  
22 year sentence for defending her-  
self and her friend from an armed  
white man who was trying to rape  
them.  

To escalate the attempt to free  
Dessie Woods and to increase her  
chances of parole, the NCDDW is ini-  
tiating a “Week for Dessie Woods"  
campaign for the first week in Sep-  
tember. During this week, the week  
of her 35th birthday, the National  
Committee is calling on supporters  
in Europe and the US to flood the  
parole board with letters, phone  
calls and petitions. Supporters will  
also be holding rallies, demonstra-  
tions, programs and actions of all  
kinds to educate people about Des-  
sie Woods' case, to raise money and  
to put pressure on the parole board  
to release her.  

The NCDDW is cautioning supporters  
not to put “too much hope in the  
appearance of Dessie Woods before the  
parole board, reminding people that  
Woods has been promised parole in the  
past. “This could simply be an at-  
tempt to make us let up on the pres-  
sure," stated Weusi Chimurenga of the  
NCDDW. “Therefore, we must do just  
the opposite. We must escalate the  
efforts to free Dessie Woods on all  
levels." Chimurenga also spoke of  
the unpredictability of Woods’ sit-  
uation because of her involvement in  
the fight for rights of black women  
in prison and her resistance against  
attacks on herself.  

Supporters are urged to write and  
call the parole board:

**Get Gov’t Where It Hurts**  

One woman's complaint of sexual  
harassment on the job could mean a  
loss of two million dollars in revenue  
sharing funds to Henrico County, Vir-  
ginia. Margaret James, a county em-  
ployee whose job assignment was both  
abruptly and adversely changed after  
she refused the sexual advances of a  
supervisor, made her complaint to the  
Office of Revenue Sharing's Civil  
Rights Division. The ORS, after in-  
vestigating the matter thoroughly,  
required that the county comply with  
certain "remedies" in the case or  
suffer the two million dollar loss.  

In order to avoid the cutoff of  
federal revenue sharing funds, Henrico  
County has been directed to "purge"  
James' personnel file of any material  
related to the harassment which might  
be prejudicial to her future employ-  
ment, and to advise all county person-  
nel that sexual harassment is a pro-  
hibited personnel practice which will  
be subject to disciplinary action.  
The county must supply ORS with docu-  
mentation of its efforts to comply  
with both remedies, and ORS has au-  
thority to reject any efforts which  
are not in full compliance with civil  
rights mandates. In addition, the  
county is required to report all  
allegations of sex discrimination it  
receives in the next year to ORS to  
ensure that the county deals with such  
complaints in strict compliance with  
the law.  

The ORS civil rights provisions may  
be one of the most important tools  
available for fighting discrimination  
in state, county or municipal govern-  
ment. Under those provisions, any  
government agency which receives re-  
venue sharing funds (most county and  
municipal governments do) is prohib-  
ited from discriminating in employ-  
ment, as well as allocation of funds,  
on the basis of race, sex, national  
origin, religion, age or handicapped  
status. If ORS receives a charge of  
discrimination against a recipient  
agency or government, it is mandated  
by Congress to conduct an on-site in-  
vestigation of the charges, to make a  

**bp**  

determination of whether the discrim-  
ination did take place or is occur-  
ring, to propose remedial action if  
discrimination was found, and to se-  
cure compliance or to suspend fund-  
ing—all within relatively short time-  
tables.  

The procedure for making a civil  
rights compliance complaint is infor-  
mal: a letter detailing the nature  
of the discrimination is sufficient  
to initiate an ORS investigation.  

The letter need not be written in le-  
gal terminology, nor is it necessary  
for an attorney to file the complaint.  
However, it is advisable to con-  
sult with an attorney or civil rights  
advocacy group.
