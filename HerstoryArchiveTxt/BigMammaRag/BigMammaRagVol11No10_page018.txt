NATIONAL THIRD WORLD PEOPLE
OF COLOR CONFERENCE POST-
PONED. Having made a ser-
ious commitment to have a
significant visible pre-
sence and involvement of
Native Americans, Asians
and Latins, the National
Third World/People of Color
Conference has been post-
poned until June 21st thru
22nd of 1984 Lesbian/Gay
Pride Week. Planning Commit-
tee members felt that as the
conference was evolving too
much of a Black focus was
emerging and more time was
needed to devote to outreach
in communities and organiza-
tions of Asians, Native Am-
ericans, and Latins. All oth-
er developments for the
National Third World/People
of Color Conference are
firm. Theme of the TW/PC
Conference was inspired from
Cliff's book, Claiming An
Identity They Taught Me To
Despise. Workshops, Caucuses,
speakers and cultural events
will be highlighted at this
national conference which

is expected to attract up
to 600 participants from
throughout the U.S. as well
as Latin America, Canada,
and the Caribbean. Pre-reg-
istration is required and should
be made payable to TW/PC
Conf. Donations needed. Send
to 584 Castro St., Suite 227
San Francisco, CA 94114.

Another Argument Against Le-
thal Injections, by Evan Ru-
bin is available in a xerox
preview edition. This paper
contains historical infor-
mation about lethal injec-
tions, especially their use
by the Nazis during Hit-
ler's regime. The paper
shows that lethal injections
are obviously a “cruel and
unusual punishment", and

are therefore unconstitu-
tional in the U.S., in spite
of their recent adoption.
