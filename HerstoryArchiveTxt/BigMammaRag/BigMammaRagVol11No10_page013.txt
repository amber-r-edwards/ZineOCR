No Woman Is Safe

Judi Chamberlin

(The following are remarks
made by Judi for MPLF at a
rally against rape--Boston
Common--July 13, 1983)

My name is Judi Chamberlin
and I am speaking as a mem-
ber of Mental Patients’ Lib-
eration Front.

MPLF is concerned about
rape because women with psy-
chiatric labels are espec-
ially vulnerable to rape. In

rape

institutions, we are raped
by doctors, by attendants,
and by other patients. When
we protest, we're ignored,
or we're told that we're
having delusions. After dis-
charge, our psychiatric his-
tories are used against us
if we are victims of rape---
we're not believed at all,
or we're discredited as
"crazy."

We challenge the use of
psychiatric labels for rap-
ists and rape victims. Rape
is trivialized when women
who have been raped are la-
belled as suffering from
"rape trauma syndrome." As
women who have been raped,
we need a supportive atmos-
phere in which to express
our pain and outrage; we do
not need "treatment" for our
"sickness." Similarly, rap-

"Living Where Insides Are Locked In Fear"

I am very insecure about relating to people.
ists should be punished for
their acts, not "treated"
for their so-called "ill-
ness." (It is important to
note that psychiatrists have
acknowledged they can detect
no differences between ra-
pists and "normal" men.)

I sense the power trips we've all been taught.

And no matter how many times I reaffirm my creativity,

my conscious heart and mind,
my belief in myself,
I just can't handle the core cruelty subtle put-downs

That people are taught as the basic survival skills -

At the Tenth International
Conference on Human Rights
and Psychiatric Oppression
in Toronto last year, the
women's caucus produced a
paper called "Mental Health
and Violence Against Women:
A Feminist Ex-Inmate Analy-
sis," in which we challenged
the growing professionaliza-
tion of rape crisis centers,
battered women's shelters,
and the like, and the in-
creasing use of psychiatric
labels to isolate victimized
women who are reacting in
"unapproved" ways. We believe
that all women who have been
victimized deserve support
through mutual self-help,
and are angry that some wo- I am divine.
men have been turned away
from shelters and forced in-
to the psychiatric system.
Please get in touch with
MPLF if you would like a co-
py of this paper.

of living in this American imperialist monster.

Locked by fear into power trips.

I find a few people here and there

Who I can more or less relate to,

Mostly other ex-psychiatric inmates and
other people who never could fit in.

We no longer want to fit in to normal.

But when I lose my thought in the middle of a sentence,
because electro-convulsive shock "therapy" made
war on my brain cells,

And I have to battle off the whole one-up vibe...

Hey, I say to myself, I am the Goddess.

I have a beautiful, powerful mind.
Feeling too much has made me vulnerable,
But it's important to feel
In order to stay alive

Inside.
We must all work together
to protest the rape of any
woman, no matter how discre-
dited. If it is all right to
rape mental patients, then
no woman is safe.

I say to myself; over and over again.

In sisterhood and struggle,

RESPONSE From Page 14:

BMR does understand the
meaning of "genocide"--we
try not to use the word
carelessly. The Fascist po-
litics of WWII demanded
genocidal action against
Jews, homosexuals, the "phy-
sically disabled" and "men-
tally ill." We do believe
that there are serious and
responsible leaders of coun-
tries involved in the cur-
rent struggle for power in
the Middle East (the US,
Britain, Soviet Union) who
are acting from a base of
building imperialist/fascist
politics that work towards
global white supremacy and
the genocide of: peoples who
live in the South Pacific
Islands where nuclear test-
ing has been carried out;
without a care for the peo-
ple; the people of Puerto Rico where the US would like
to build an industrial/cor-
porate island, the Native
American peoples here in the
United States and all abor-
iginal peoples fighting for
their lives in Australia and
New Zealand and all the pla-
ces we don't know enough a-
bout to name, Semitic peo-
ples in the Middle East--
Palestinians, Jews, the peo-

ple in South Africa fight-
ing to end apartheid, the
peoples in Central and South
America fighting against
colonialism, Chicano/Mexi-
can peoples fighting in

the US and Mexico for their
liberation, Black people

in the US fighting to end

their colonialist relationship
to the US government, all
people in this country and

all over the world who are
struggling to end the op-
pression in their lives.
