Benefit For BMR

Dear Big Mama Rag,

I want to announce a read-
ing by ex-psychiatric in-
mates, which we are doing
as a benefit for Big Mama
Rag. It's called “Living
Our Madness." Six women and
one man will read their poe-
try and verse. For those BMR
readers in the San Francis-

co Bay area, come hear us

read. It will be April 25
on a Wednesday, at Modern
Times Bookstore, 968 Valen-
cia Street, San Francisco,
at 7:30 p.m. $3 donation, no
one turned away for lack of
funds.

In Feb.'84 Big Mama, a wo-
man wrote in about how much
criticism BMR is getting.
She mentioned criticism of
your self-criticism, which
was my letter. What I want
to say is that I didn't in-
tend it as criticism. Maybe
I took too long, until the
last paragraph, to get to
what I needed to say: that
BMR is an invaluable forum
for political change and
that it is our responsibil-
ity as readers to write you
articles on racism, anti-sem-
itism and all the issues BMR
struggles with. I only wrote
that letter because it hurt
me that you've been getting
so much criticism. I know
criticism is good for growth
and all, but all the work
you do, so much criticism
can really load you down. If
I wasn't clear in my letter,
at the risk of sounding cor-
ny, I love you, Big Mama Rag.
You give me hope and inspir-
ation, lift my spirits when
I start feeling overwhelmed
by the inhumanity of US im-
perialism. I feel grateful
for the time, energy, and
thought that all the staff
and supporters contribute.
I'd better not say any more
about it, or I'll be embar-
rassed by going on and on,
like some kind of love let-
ter.

In sisterhood and struggle,

Rose

Courageous Sharing
Dear BMR Collective:

First, let me send good
energy to you, who somehow
manage to do whatever you
must to earn a living, strug-
gle with each other and with
so many complex issues, and
manage to get the banner out too.
A monthly miracle!

In the February issue, I
appreciated the courageous
sharing by the woman who spent
all night in struggle and
wrote about it. It helped me
to see that what's bothering

her, bothers me/all of us. I
felt close to her, and moved
by her willingness to work
so hard, and let us see what
she had written.

I also learned from the
article on mercury poisoning.
I honor Lissa Donner's will-
ingness to re-live some of
that pain and isolation, in
order that we may be infor-
med, and some be spared.

Again, I appreciate all
that you DO and ARE. May you
have the stamina to keep up
the good work!

Sincerely,

Nancy Breeze

Reader To Reader

Mama,

Thanks for all the effort
& struggle that comes forth
from publication. It's helped
me during these years of iso-
lation.

I'd like to address myself
to one of your readers in the
hope that she gets this issue.

Singing Moon,

After reading your letter
in the February edition of
BMR, I was able to track you
as far as the Olive Branch
Mission. They said you'd
been gone 6 weeks & I left
my phone # & address to be
passed on to you. My phone
has been disconnected & I
wasn't sure you got my mess-
age. If you're still in need
of housing, I'd like to offer
1) a temporary place for
your body & mind to be
safe and 2) more long-term
arrangements if we all get on
together.

The housing is not up to
"regular" standards but
the 3 kids & myself sur-
pass, by far, those
kinds of standards.
We'll find a way of gett-

ing food help for you; if

you don't have a way. This is
the one area that I'm not
equipped for.

If you no longer need a
place, I hope you'll drop
me a post card to let me
know that.

In good faith,
Diane

Prison Activist

BMR-

I have learned to appreci-
ate the sigh of the breeze
which rustles through the
trees...the smell of nature
with the promise of spring. I
have learned to appreciate
the loneliness which softly
tenders my heart and the tears, spilled
during moments lost in
memories. I exist upon memories
and thankfully so,
memories are the forerunners
of my future. A future be-
yond the frustration and
deprivation of this prison
world. So tonight, as I sit
writing to you, I ask you
to come home for a moment--
just one moment...from Is-
rael, Mexico, Africa...I
have learned to appreciate
even a moment's glance thrown
my way.

She is a lesbian, a mother,
a writer, and a woman I love.
This you must know. She is
an artist, intelligent, ho-
nest, Chicana and considered
a threat to the institution,
for all of the above traits
I have listed. This is a
very serious letter as she
is completing 2 months in
an isolation cell though
she has not been charged or in-
fracted for any violation
whatsoever. The administra-
tion is planning on placing
her on "Intensive Management."
This means she shall live
in a cell and be allowed 6
month “reviews.” She is al-
lowed out for a shower each
day and for 1 hour each day.
She is placed in a room no
bigger than her cell and is
allowed to smoke during
this hour. She is given her
food through a slot in the
cell door. Her food is cold
and comes in a brown paper
bag. There is a toilet and
sink in her cell and she
must eat her meals next to
her toilet and sink. The
plumbing is screwed up in
the whole building and each
person receives another per-
son's waste material (fe-
ces, urine, etc.) in their
toilet each time the toilet
is flushed. She has been
stripped of all personal ef-
fects, including clothes,
and wears pajamas. She is
not allowed to speak with
anyone on her way to the
shower or to her hour out.
She passes by me each day
and neither she (nor I) can
signal or mouth words to
each other because we will
be issued Major Infractions
for communicating. We cannot
afford to give the institu-
tion any reasons for keep-
ing her back there. She is
shook down (groped on)
by guards each time she
takes a shower. We are in
the Maximum Security Bldg.
the Administrative Segregation wing,
the hole. The administra-
tion has placed her back
there due to “homicidal
thoughts which might
endanger an inmate." She has done
three years here with
absolutely no time of violence.
She was placed in Maximum
Security several months ago
because a package was confis-
cated en route to the insti-
tution which had a small a-
mount of weed and pills. Al-
though the institution never
received the package--she
was charged with smuggling
in drugs, found guilty and
placed in Maximum Security.
Several weeks later, they
placed her in the hole be-
cause they believed she had
"homicidal thoughts." Perhaps
you have published her be-
fore? Her name is VerLyn.
Not only is this a ridicu-
lous reason for placing her
in the hole, but it does not
even fall under a violation.
Therefore, she is arbitrarily
being held with no charge
and no charges pending. She
is being held for her alleged
thoughts!! I am sending you
an example of what she has
done during her time here:
One was a program she set up
which involved an outreach
program with the Special
Needs Program (SNU). This is
a locked unit which houses
women with mental/emotional
problems. This program
still exists. The other art-
icle is an annual program
she would set up and direct
which involved the arts...
