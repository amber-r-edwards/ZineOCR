Lesbians Zap City Council

DYKETACTICS! is “a collec-
tive of lesbian-feminists com-
mitted to actions which will raise
public consciousness and
electrify the imaginations of the
gay and women’s com-
munities.” Early in December,
DYKETACTICS! and other mem-
bers of the Philadelphia gay
community demonstrated at the
City Council chambers to protest
the Council's failure to move
ahead on Bill 1275, which would
provide equal housing, public
accommodation and job rights
for gays. Tactics included raising
of fists, demonstrations of af-
fection, and banners, one of
which read “You will never have
the comfort of our silence
again.”

City Council chamber guards
and the Civil Disobedience
squad moved in and threw
women to the floor, beat and
kicked them.

The attacks were repeated

later the same day outside the
City Council President's office.
Six members of the group re-
quired medical attention.

Members are filing suit
against members of the Civil
Disobedience squad for physical
and psychological damages
incurred. DYKETACTICS! is also
filing a suit for declaratory and
injunctive relief against City Hall
to prevent further abridgement
of their civil rights.

Financial and sisterly support
should be sent to
DYKETACTICS!, c/o Free
Women’s School, Penn
Women’s Center, 112 Logan
Hall, Philadelphia, Pa. 19174.

Chrome and Cancer

Two recent European studies
show that workers exposed to
“excessive amounts” of chrome
pigment dust face a strong risk of
getting lung cancer. America’s
largest producers of chrome pig-
ments are Cyanamid, DuPont,
Borden and Hercules. They have
announced (surprise, surprise)
that they are funding their own
studies.

Ex-addict Tells of Sex Abuses

A former patient of the Ray-
brook Center, a state drug re-
habilitation center in Essex
County, New York, has testified
that male staffers of the facility
routinely expected sex with pa-
tients in return for favors and
privileges. “They didn't say
much," she testified, “they just
unzipped their pants.”

The testimony was part of an
investigation of four state resi-
dential drug treatment centers
by the State Commission of
Investigation. The other three
are: The Otisville Rehabilitation
Center in Orange County, the
Masten Park Center in Buffalo
and the Iroquois Center in
Orleans County. All four have
been charged with providing in-
adequate medical care, permit-
ting the peddling of contraband
drugs and sexual relations be-
tween patients and staff.

Natural Pig

President Ono Yoshiro of the
Japan Broadcasting Corpora-
tion says that to change the sex
stereotyping the company uses
in its TV dramas would be “un-
natural.” Responding to a group
of women protesting sexism in
the state-run corporation's
shows, Yoshiro said that “it is
perfectly natural that newscas-
ters be men, considering the
mental and physical strength re-
quired to deal with the be-
wildering array of news stories
that come in.”

The women plan to launch
demonstrations and a TV tax non-
payment campaign.

Housewives Protest Massage
Parlors

A group of housewives in
Fremont, California, have
launched a campaign to embar-
rass men who frequent massage
parlors. CAMP (Citizens Against
Massage Parlors) began
picketing each of the town’s six-
teen parlors after a member's
young children were hassled by
a man who was hanging around
outside one of them. Nearly 200
women are active in the group,
which has begun writing up
on a board license numbers
of cars which cross their pic-
ket lines. “A lot of wives have
started driving by to see if their
husband's car is on the list,” a
CAMP spokeswoman said.

More Gay Repression

The Pennsylvania State Legis-
lature recently passed Senate
Bill 196, prohibiting people who
engage in ‘deviate sexual inter-
course” from working with juve-
niles, the mentally ill and re-
tarded; and in reform, penal,
correctional and law enforce-
ment institutions. Although it
applies to unmarried hetero-
sexuals who practice oral and
anal sex as well as to homo-
sexuals, the bill is seen to affect
open gays most severely.

Governor Shapp, in vetoing
the bill, called it one of the most
“atrocious” pieces of legis-
lation he had ever seen. The
Legislature, which passed the
bill by an overwhelming
majority, could override the veto.

Organizations working to
oppose the bill include the New
American Movement, Pitts-
burgh Gay Political Caucus,
National Organization for
Women and Pennsylvania
Social Services Union, Local
668, all working out of Pitts-
burgh.

Male Justice Only, Please

San Francisco Municipal
Court Judge Ollie Marie-Vic-
toire has been barred from hear-
ing any more prostitution cases
after having dismissed charges
against 37 prostitutes. She
claimed that the police had used
an “intentional, purposeful,
selective enforcement policy”
when they arrested the women
but allowed their male cus-
tomers to go free. The judge
added that most of the cus-
tomers were “white, married,
middle-class affluent males.”
Judge Marie-Victoire plans to
appeal the higher court's ban.

Struggle

a continuing forum

Feminist separatists are those women who choose, as a political
action, to separate themselves from men politically, socially and
sexually. As a political strategy, separatism has been an issue of con-
troversy in the women’s movement for several years. This controversy
has been exploited and distorted by the media in an effort to discredit
separatism — most notably by playing on straight women’s homo-
phobic fears and implying that it is “for lesbians only.”

It is true that since lesbians’ primary relationships are with women,
we find it easier to avoid entanglements with men and therefore find it
easier to maintain a separatist position. It is also true that there are
some lesbians in the separatist movement who will work only with
other lesbians (lesbian separatists). What many women don’t know,
however, is that the separatist movement was started by heterosexual
women, the concept behind it being very similar to a general strike —
“We won't work with men politically or relate to them sexually until we
get a better deal.”

Separatism is not a new phenomenon, nor is it exclusive to feminism.
In ancient Greece, Lysistrata and her cohorts locked men out of their city
and refused sexual services until the men stopped their wars. Separa-
tism in the current women’s movement was strongly influenced by the
black separatist movement of the sixties.

For women, separatism is even more important than for other groups
that have used this strategy. For example, black separatists already had
geographical and cultural communities on which to build a sense of
group identity. Most women, on the other hand, have been isolated from
each other in individual homes with their sense of identity defined by
the men in their lives.

Even in work and social situations that have traditionally been all
women (the office, bowling leagues, coffee klatches), women have been
defined as supplemental for so long that we will see ourselves and our
needs as secondary. Although there is a seed of potential power in such
all-women situations, the male ethic will not be threatened
when women get together so long as we keep supplying cooking, mothering
and sexual services.

The development of a separate women’s politics and culture has led
us to recognize skills that we as women have always had, but that have
been suppressed or distorted in the dominant male society. The “self-
sacrificing mother” stereotype is becoming transformed as we recog-
nize the positive values of nurturance when the nurturance is shared by
all the women in the community. Women’s heightened sensitivity to
personal interactions and awareness of the needs of others was orig-
inally a survival skill we developed to manipulate the particular men
who dominated and controlled our lives. When it is used non-
manipulatively in a women’s community, it provides a basis for a
cooperative group ethic.

Within a separate women’s culture, women are also forced to learn
skills which have not only been denied us, but which we previously
relied upon men to perform for us. The sense of confidence that is
emerging from this is vital to the growing group identity of the women's
movement.

Although a society may be aware of a conflict between itself and a
particular group in its culture, separatism alerts the dominant culture of
the extent of the conflict (i.e. “Lysistrata”). Separatism further allows
the sub-group the political space to get a better perspective of itself and
its relationship to the dominant culture. The conscious decision to
separate from men is, in fact, a declaration of independence not only
from individual men but from the patriarchal structure that defines
women as secondary. The fact that our decision is our choice and is not
created out of rejection by the male society means that, for the first
time, we can view our relationships with other women as a primary
commitment.
