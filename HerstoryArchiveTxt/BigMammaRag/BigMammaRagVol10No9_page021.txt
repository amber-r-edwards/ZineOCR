needs money!

Everyone is having hard times. And, unfortunately, a frequent result of this
is that more and more political projects are being forced to fold for lack of
funds. But, now in the midst of the crunch it is more important than ever to
keep on organizing for change, keep on sharing information that is totally om-
itted or distorted in the straight press.

We know that BMR is serving an important function for women. Subscription num-
bers are up, our mailbox overflows each day, and more and more articles and let-
ters are submitted for publication. We want BMR to persevere through these hard
times without compromise.

This is an ongoing concern. And we know it's not going to get any better with-
out ongoing support from those of you who can afford it. We are committed to
keeping the sub price low, so that the paper is accessible to all women. But we
encourage you to pay more for your sub if you can. And, we ask that, if you can,
please make BMR a part of your budget by sending a regular monthly contribution.
We need to feel that our bills will get covered, and for a long time that hasn't
happened. We are three months behind on rent. For the last several issues, we
have resorted to making phone calls around the local community to raise donations
to be able to mail (the August issue was mailed two weeks late because we couldn't
pay the post office).

Please respond—it's up to all of us to keep up the struggle.
