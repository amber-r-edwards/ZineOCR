When She Was Good She Was Very Good,

Ruth Cole interviewed by  
Bobbe Ross  
My mother's family was from  
a small mining town in West  
Virginia. Her father was a  
mailman all his life and rode  
a bicycle in that hilly coun-  
try. Her mother was a school  
teacher; she started teaching  
when she was 15 and continued  

again until they got a divorce.  
I was about 12 and she start-  
ed working at the county hos-  
pital, which was a pretty sleazy  
place to work but she  
wouldn't work at any of the  
good hospitals because she  
didn't want to run into my  
father. So she went to the  
county hospital which was out  

personal  

herstory  

until she was 60. They were  
poor, compared to what my moth-  
er became afterwards. My moth-  
er became a nurse. I don't  
know how they got the money  
but she went to Duke Univer-  
sity. The war (WW2) was just  
getting ready to start. As  
soon as she could, when she got  
to be a nurse, she joined the  
war because she wanted to go  
overseas, to France. She was  
in the hospital of France the  
whole war and she loved it.  
She talks about that as the  
best time of her life; she was  
a very good nurse and liked  
the excitement of all the dif-  
ferent people and the excite-  
ment of war.  

She came back to Duke and  
met my father who was going  
to medical school. He came  
from a very different back-  
ground. He was from Sarasota,  
Fla.; his parents were from  
Sarasota; they went back to  
the founding of the town as  
lawyers and ministers. My  
mother's mother paid for his  
schooling. My father's family  
had no money; they lost it all.  
My father's father had specu-  
lated on a great land boom in  
Florida and he lost everything  
and killed himself. My father  
still had the good name to go  
by, but he got everything from  
my mother's family and robbed  
them blind.  

They settled in Sarasota  
and she worked for him for a  
while as a nurse-receptionist  
and she stopped that because  
they were having troubles and  
so she ended up staying home  
and becoming a socialite.  
When she got to Sarasota she  
was expected to be the wife  
of my father, which was a big  
deal, a doctor's wife. They  
belonged to the country club  
and she was a pink lady. She  
helped out at the hospital  
but she didn't have any pro-  
fessional duties anymore. When  
I was about 5, my mother start-  
ed drinking.  

I don't remember her working

in the boonies and it was for  
people that were in jail and  
people that had no money at all  
and who were just sort of  
scraped up off the streets.  

So it was hard on her; all her  
working jobs as a nurse were  
not at all posh because my fa-  
ther was in the posh places  
and so was everybody that she  
had known as my father's wife.  
She had definitely come down  
in life. She had gone up in  

life when she married him but  
then she got a reputation, as  
doctor's wives did, as a bas-  
ket case. She had three friends  
who all were doctor's wives  
and they have all killed  
themselves. It was very odd;  
if you were a doctor's wife  
in Sarasota it was a sure  
thing you were going to be  

a basket case.  

Her jobs were depressing. I  
remember once her telling me  
about a man at the county  
hospital, a patient; she spent  
like every day for a week  
picking maggots out of his  
tumor growing out of his chin.  
She loved nursing; she liked  
taking care of people and I  
think she mostly liked taking  
care of men. My mother always  
reminded me of Snow White  
and the seven dwarfs: Her  
patients always think she's  

wonderful and her heart goes  
out to them and when they  
stop being patients they come  
back and see her and lots of  
times she sleeps with them  
and goes on binges with them  
and loses her job because of  
them.  

I remember her working the  
most, downtown, in the differ-  
ent clinics that they had, and  
the doctors that they had  
were pretty poor. A lot of  
them came from Cuba and my  
mother had no respect for a  
doctor that came from Cuba.  
But it wasn't only Cuban doc-  
tors that she thought were  
inadequate; mostly she thought  
doctors were inadequate but  
she respected them for their  
social position. That was a  
lot of her downfall I think  
because it was such a split  
within her. She really  
thought they were gods but  

she hated them; she thought  
they were bastards and she  
wanted to murder them and  
wouldn't admit that to her-  
self except when she was  
drunk, which was frequently.  
And when I say drunk, I don't  
mean just drunk; she had an-  
other personality. She was  
very good when she was  
straight; when she was good  
she was very, very good; when  
she was drunk she was just  
somebody else she wouldn't  
admit to any other time.  
When my parents got the di-  
vorce I was young; my whole  
world fell apart. I was al-  
ways between two homes. My  
mother always lived in ap-  
artments and I was always  
rooting for her to be happy  
enough to go on. It  
was always her and me because  
my sisters were just not in-  

volved. I wasn't enough to  
keep my mother happy. I was  
always finding bottles and I  
would pour them down the toi-  
let. She was a typical alco-  
holic and she would hide them  
and she would be acting funny;  
her eyes rolled around a lot and  
I would think, "you've been  
drinking." I wouldn't say that  
because I wouldn't confront  
her, but I would look for the  
bottles and I would throw them  
away. I would find pills and  
I would flush them down the  
toilet and she would be fur-  
ious. And she would pass out;  
that's why she drank and took  
pills; she wanted to pass out  
for the whole weekend, be-  
cause she would go to work  
and it would be awful. It was  
awful. She worked at the  
child health clinic where  
they see children screaming  
meemies every day and poor  
and with all sorts of diseas-  
es and overwork, and she was  
also a visiting nurse. She  
would bring her homework home  
because she had all these  
files on her patients and  
working for the state she had  
a million forms to fill out  
and she was conscientious but  
when Friday afternoon came,  
she just wanted to be uncon-  
scious until Monday morning  
and frequently she was. A lot  
of times, she managed to  

just snap back on Monday morn-  
ing and get back to work,  

but frequently also she didn't.  
And she would stretch out all  
week long and the more she  

was drugged out the more de-  
pressed she would get. In the  
past 25 years, she must have  
tried to kill herself at least  
15 times, slashing her wrists;  
she was a great one for  
blades and blood. This one  
apartment I remember our liv-  
ing in when I was in Jr. High  
school; it was a 1-bedroom  
apartment; it was pretty posh.  
We couldn't afford it with all  
the expenses she had but we  
lived there. She got child  
support and alimony too but  
she wanted lots of money and  
she always drove a big car  
and had fancy clothes and  
fancy taste in food, and she  
refused to admit she was poor  
or that she had to watch her  
budget. This apartment we liv-  
ed in, the main memory I have  
of it is frequently coming  
home from school with the  
chain lock on the door and  

she would be passed out and
