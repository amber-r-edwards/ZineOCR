Dear Sisters:

The first two issues of  
“Big Mama Rag" are fantastic!  
All of us “women" are in  
desperate need of our own  
paper if for no other reason  
than to know that I am not  
the only one like me...and may-  
be I'm not “sick” after all...  
and hey, this is what I think  
or feel! Also the idea of  
"women" defining and spelling  
our own name and on OUR OWN  
terms is really important!  
There was an article in the  
last issue which I would like  
to comment on..."Books for Kids?  
Careful Now..." My only  
objection was in the terminology  
"Kids" are People! Just like  
you and me, the only difference  
MAYBE is that they are a  
little shorter. They  
have been provided for,  
oppressed, controlled, shielded,  
protected too..."Watch what  
you say in front of the ‘'children'!"  
They, like us, have not  
been allowed to BE, to THINK,  
to FEEL, to take their  
OWN LIVES INTO THEIR OWN HANDS!  
Just as I do not like, in  
fact REVOLT against being  
referred to in one of the many  
condescending terms used for  
woman (e.g. "Chick," "broad,"  
"baby," "honey") I in turn  
will NOT use condescending terms  
towards my younger sisters and  
people.  

We have to learn to respect  
each other as PEOPLE, no  
matter what age, race, sex.  
All oppressed persons MUST work  
together to change this system  
which tyrannizes us all!

In struggle,

Carolyn Agosta

to read Dialectic of Sex  
by Shulamith Firestone — she  
puts it all together!

LETTERS HOME TO  

MAMA  

I find the writing,  
printing, and graphics of the  
BMR all above average. Com-  
mendable. On the other hand  
I find your editorial somewhat  
unworthy of you. "A woman  
(or a man) who is thinking for  
and about herself" often  
develops into a selfish, small  
creature. I believe the level  
of vocabulary, attention to  
grammar, cubistic artwork,  
layout and printing of the Rag  
demonstrate the above average  
skills and education of your  
staff. If so, might you not  
ask yourselves why this out-  
pouring of effort in print,  
which you might well spend else-  
where in individual advancement?  
A labor of love? Pure altruism  
in favor of less privileged  
females? I doubt it.

More favored than the  
average U.S. woman, you  
nevertheless feel inadequate  
either to attempt high attain-  
ment in the admittedly unsatis-  
factory and male-dominated goal  
reward systems of American  
society, or to strike out on  
your own courses, securely  
tied to your egos as you  
cleave between the Scylla of  
irrelevance and the Charybdis  
of blank failure.

Are you not trying mainly  
to build up your own idea of  
your self-worth? May I suggest  
that this is a valid goal, and  
that the B.M.R. adopt an  
unwritten editorial policy of  
building the ego of many  
women up to the point equal to  
their abilities, a policy of  
encouraging women to reach  
their full potential in the  
intellectual and financial and  
artistic terms dictated by our  
society? Wouldn't this be a  
more positive approach than the  
somewhat narcissistic policies  
you advocate? (After all just  
how many women or men feel  
obliged "to write about their  
feelings, ideas?")

Such a policy as I suggest  
though would require discipline.  
You could not go spouting off  
about Pat Schroeder. Your  
interviewers would have to  
strive to ask her questions  
which bring out her sterling  
qualities, to draw out her  
motivations so other women  
might identify similar forces  

in themselves.  

BMR:  

Thanks for the copy of  
"Big Mama Rag." I really  
appreciated it and best of  
luck to you and the paper.  

Pat Schroeder  

We were happy to see Den-  
ver's first television series  
produced specifically for and  
about women, Anatomy of Woman  
(KRNA Ch. 6) has stirred up a  
lot of feeling and opinion,  
both positive and negative.  
Most important is the fact that  
many women have cared deeply  
about this program and wanted  
it to speak for them.

We would like to hear your  
opinions and your suggestions  
for an upcoming article. It is  
our understanding that the show  
may be expanded into a nation-  
wide series, a prospect we look  
forward to with enthusiasm. If  
this should happen, additional  
funding would hopefully open the  
door for implementing any con-  
structive criticism we could  
generate.

So please think about it,  
and let us hear from you.

PRIME TIME is an independent feminist  
monthly for the liberation of women  
in the prime of life. We believe  
that every period of a woman's life  
should be a prime time--a time of  
growth and fulfillment--whether she  
is in her 30s, 40s, 60s or 90s.
