Women Say No to Registration

Facing A New

Author's Note:

Over the past month, it has been
an act of discipline to read the
newspaper, to remain informed about
the state of the world. As a collec-
tive, we have begun to struggle with
how to deal with issues that are not
directly related to our work as fem-
inists. But, with the announcement
of the revitalization of the selec-
tive service, and with the possibility
of women being drafted, we as
feminists must be aware of the
changing world situation. We oppose
the draft for all peoples, and are
committed to developing a feminist
perspective around the issues facing

us as we enter the 1980s. We also see
Big Mama Rag, as well as all other
feminist publications as a means of
keeping women informed about the op-
tions we have in resisting conscrip-
tion and fighting back for the rights
of all people.

For the past several months, the
world situation has been changing,
creating increasingly complex inter-
national scenarios. And while appear-
ances indicate that the United States
has kept a surprisingly low profile,
and even exhibited restraint, it was
not surprising that in his State of
the Union message on January 23, Pres-
ident Carter announced, "We will
fight." Behind the low profile, Am-
erican officials have been whipping
up an intense and terrifying nation-
alism to prepare the country for war.

With Iran, we have witnessed an
upsurgence of blatant racism as
evidenced in college demonstrations,
persecution and unconstitutional
deportation of Iranian students in
the United States. And now, with the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the
Cold War has once again ignited, and
with it the beginnings of red-baiting
and American paranoia. The media has
resisted making the connections be-
tween Western imperialism and Soviet
aggression; and it does not seem to
matter to many that just ten years
ago, the U.S. was the aggressor in
Viet Nam - instead, we hear about
the threat to international order,
to world security, and most of all
to "our" oil fields.

It was with audacity, and typical
capitalist arrogance that Carter
committed America to a new war pos-
ture. His statement, carefully in-
jected after these months of pre-
paration, was: further manipulation
of public opinion; and no matter
how we choose to deal with this fact,
it is clear that our lives will
change as American foreign involve-
ment changes. No one, except per-
haps the rich and the politically en-
trenched, will remain unaffected.

And it is in this light that we as
feminists should approach the future.

1. With the probable revitaliza-
tion of "peacetime registration",
we can assume that the draft will
follow close on the heels of selec-
tion. Although the President can
order registration on his own, es-
pecially in the case of national
emergency, the issue will probably
go to the House and Senate for
debate and passage first. Last year,
when compulsory military service
was tacked on to Military Appropri-
ations bills, it was soundly de-
feated; but with the shifting "mood
of the nation", and despite the
fact that at least one United States
Senator has promised to block the
bill, the likelihood is that regis-
tration will be reinstated.

If women are indeed required to
register, a decision Carter will
make by February 9, major revisions
of the Selective Service will be
made. From there, records for re-
gistration will come from social
security numbers, high-school
transcripts, and any other available
documents. The purpose will be to
locate every young person in the
country between the ages of 18 and
26 for future military service. The
means of doing this represent an-
other encroachment on personal rights
and a total invasion of privacy.

Following registration, there is
a selection process, which has tra-
ditionally favored white, privileged
young men, and which many represent-
atives frankly admit "has not worked
equitably in the past." Those select-
ed receive a number, and when that
number is called, they are inducted
into military service.

2. If we are talking about in-
duction, we are almost certainly
talking about war. And if we are
talking about war in the 1980s,
we are talking about a new kind of
conflict, radically different than
either World War, different even
than Viet Nam.

The implications of an interna-
tional war in this decade are incon-
ceivable. First, there is the threat
of nuclear war, a threat that has
increased geometrically as more
nations gain nuclear capacity. (At
this time, we are uncertain of the
number of countries who have such
capacity. We do know however that
Pakistan, a nation likely to be-
come involved in a Middle Eastern
skirmish, has untested nuclear
bombs.) Furthermore, the United
States now has the neutron bomb
which is designed to kill people
without destroying land/buildings,
and could be used against oil-rich
areas to preserve those resources.
And it is unlikely that only one bomb
would explode, that only one nation
would be destroyed, that anyone
could or would survive.

Certainly, this is the most dras-
tic implication. But even without
nuclear capacity, the face of war
has altered dramatically in the
last decade. The Middle East, the
area of the world most likely to be-
come an international battleground,
is already heavily armed with so-
phisticated and lethal weaponry. To
even consider a war at this time,
in this area is tantamount to na-
tional and global suicide.

So, when Carter talks about rein-
stating the draft, about sending
young men, and possibly young women
to war, he is literally asking them
to die because the chances of sur-
vival of such a conflict are so low.
Ironically, just minutes after his
call for registration in the State
of the Union address, he talked about
creating educational opportunities
for youth, especially for minority
people, by saying, "A mind is a terri-
ble thing to waste." Apparently, to
him a human life, millions of human
lives are not so terrible to waste,
especially in the interest of Ameri-
can oil holdings abroad. The irony
of this remains that many people
will be asked to die for a system
that has never supported them in
the first place.

3. Another implication of war is
one that is already being felt with
the rising military budget. With in-
creased military spending, there is
less and less money for human needs,
which means major cuts in welfare,
health and hospital services, day-
care and public education, just to
name a few. And of course, the une-
mployment rate will continue to
rise, and fewer people will be able
to find jobs.

The people who feel this the most
keenly are those who have already
had to bear the brunt of the system.

"Affirmative Action" practices will
be among the first to lose their
jobs so that men can support their
families. Minority peoples will be
cut out of the economy even further
so that whites can survive. Rather
than starve, many people will choose
military service, a fact well known
to recruiters. Furthermore, even if
it means having to go to war, mil-
lions will be drafted rather than
having to face the legal and economic
implications of resistance.

And in this vicious sequence, we
can expect a backlash of American
paranoia. In trying to survive,
people often look for scapegoats on
which to pin their problems. This
has already begun as evidenced in
the response to the Iranian situation

and in the beginnings of the McCarthy

like revival of red-baiting. The
right has been on the rise for sever-
al years now, and this fact, combined
with growing nationalist sentiment,
is going to make life difficult for
anyone who is seen as "Un-American."
Again, the people who have always
been oppressed will be doubly vic-
timized. And this includes all
peoples of color; Jews, and others
of non-Christian creed; women, es-
pecially political feminists; les-
bians and gay men.

4. And this points to the most
important connection of all. Even
though the United States Government
may not yet have initiated military
intervention in the Middle East, the

There will be a community meeting to discuss a feminist response to the
possibility of military registration and the draft for both women and
men. We want to discuss plans for a demonstration in Denver on March 8.

Threat Of War

U.S. is at war now, and has been

for over two centuries. Sometimes
blatant, often times subtle, this
war has maintained capitalism at

the expense of oppressed peoples at
home as well as abroad. And the peo-
ple who suffer most in a military
war are those who have already been
suffering.

Carter called the oil-rich Persian
Gulf an area "of vital interest to
this nation." Of vital interest also
have been the people who lived in
this area, who have survived under
oppressive governments and inhuman
conditions so that the United States
could maintain profitable relations
with their rulers. And so, when these
relations are threatened, Carter
turns the threat around, making it
seem that oil, land, and people
exist to serve the American system
(connecting big business and govern-
ment, which in turn serve to support
and protect each other), in much
the same possessive way that small
nations are seen to belong to large
nations, laborers belong to bosses,
and women belong to men.

One of the most frightening pros-
pects grows out of the possible
registration of women in the mili-
tary service. As women, we have al-
ways lived in a war zone, but the
dangers of being so close to men
in an intensified, violent situa-
tion are magnified. This is especi-
ally complicated by the macho-mili-
tary egos of many men in the service
who will no doubt be threatened by
the presence of women in their ranks.
And how will women taken as prisoners
of war be treated? All we have to do
is consider the inhuman treatment
of political women in Chile arrested
for political crimes to understand
the dire implications of this.

And so, women's involvement with
war has new implications. If the
Carter Administration does decide to
register and then draft women, we do
have options. We can resist by
refusing to register; or if we do
register and are selected, we can

refuse induction. Another option

is to register with a pacifist

group to be listed as Conscientious
Objectors. This is a method that

has been used by many war resisters
for decades, and it exempts them
from active military service on the
basis of religious and personal
beliefs about war. To get C.O. status
a person should be registered before
she or he is forced to register
with the Selective Service. Since
last year, many organizations have
actively sought counter-recruitments
for C.O., and most cities should have
peace groups with information about
local counter recruiters. For more
information about this, contact

the Central Committee for Conscien-
tious Objectors, 2208 South Street,
Philadelphia, PA 19146, telephone
(215) 545-4626.

The most important thing is to
become informed about the draft pro-
cess and to be aware of what is going
on in the world. Even if women are
not forced to register, or if we
are selected only for behind-the-
scenes military service, we must
oppose the draft for all peoples.
It is vital that we educate others,
both women and men, about the rea-
sons for and the effects of war.

The time to organize is now - if
there is massive resistance on all
levels, we might find that there
is safety in numbers. And we will
have a better chance of gaining at
least some control over our own
lives in these frightening and
threatening times.
