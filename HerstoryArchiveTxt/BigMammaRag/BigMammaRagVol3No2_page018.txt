LEGISLATION

From Page 7

A defendant has the constitutional
right to try to impeach a witness on
specific statements. But the rights of
the defendant would not be affected,
according to Wood. Although Iowa
anticipates a constitutional challenge
on its in-chambers hearings provision
in rape cases, Wood believes that
there is no denial of a defendant's
rights since a judge can move certain
proceedings into chambers anyway.

- Marriage No Excuse -

The third proposal is to redefine the
term “spouse” as it is used in
Colorado’s rape and sexual assault
statutes. The current law denies a
woman the equal protection of rape
and sexual assault laws if the
perpetrator happens to be her husband
and even though she may be living
apart from him.

There have been two suggested
alternative proposals to change this
law. One would simply delete the
words “not his spouse” wherever they
appear in the statutes. This would
make a rape or sexual assault a proper
charge in any case. The other
alternative would define the word
“spouse” in such a way as to exclude
from the definitory a person living
separate and apart from the perpetra-
tor.

“There is no reason that if someone
marries, they should lose the protec-
tion of the law,” says Wood.

The fourth proposal would allow
evidence into a rape or sexual assault
case that would show a common plan,
scheme, design, motive as with the
rapist who consistently leaves identi-
cal evidence such as fingerprints or
exhibits a common behavior with each
victim. Wood says that by case law in
Colorado it appears to be the general
rule that prosecutors, in present-

P s s n any criminal
proceedings except rape or sexual
assault, may seek to introduce
evidence linking the defendant to the

“case by establishing that, on other
occasions, the defendant acted within
a pattern.

Such evidence may be prejudicial
but it is difficult to understand why it
would be any more prejudicial in rape
cases than in robberies and homicides.
Again, continues Wood, there is no
reason for special treatment for rape
defendants.

Victim Compensation

The fifth proposal provides for
compensation for rape victims. The
state would finance the costs of
emergency and follow-up treatment
for victims of such violent crimes as
rape, assault, homicide and robbery.
Allowable costs would include abor-
tion, pregnancy, childbirth, and
psychiatric treatment. Burial costs for
homicide victims would be covered.

This proposal may be the most
controversial, admits Wood, and will
probably undergo major change in the
legislature. To help reduce the
possibility of fraud, state financial
assistance would be contingent upon
the victim’s cooperation with the
evidence of the bona fides of the
charge. Originally this proposal read
that the victim had to cooperate in the
apprehension and prosecution, if any,
of the alleged offender or offenders. It
was changed due to a suggestion
made by Pam Gleason, a member of
the Colorado Democratic Women’s
Caucus, that women should not be
forced to subject themselves to the
cross-examination tactics currently
being used by defense counsel in
court in order to receive the medical
and psychiatric care that they may
need.

Some discussion of this proposal
both at the District Attorney's office
where the proposals were initially
made public and at a recent meeting of
the Denver Coalition on Sexual Assault
centered around making the convicted
offender work while being held in
prison receiving a decent wage to
reimburse the victim (or the State) for
the expenses resulting from his crime,
and his family while he is in prison
that must often receive welfare while
he is being held.

Ms. Gleason also proposed that the
word “rape” be abolished since rape is
defined by penetration of a penis into
a vagina it is a crime that applies only
to women as victims and is a sexist
term. Rape is not a sex crime, she
continues, but a hostility crime.
Non-penile penetration is still rape
although it is categorized as deviant
sexual intercourse and is considered a
class 4 felony with a shorter sentence
than rape which is a class 3 felony.
Ms. Gleason feels that any kind of
forced genital contact on either side
constitutes a sexual assault.

The D.A.’s office will support
changing and deleting the word “rape”
from statutes and replacing it with
“sexual assault” with various degrees.
Although it would only be calling a
rose by another name, it would still be
a better name, says Pam Gleason. The
humiliation and trauma connected to
the word rape and aimed at the victim
of the crime would hopefully be
lessened.

This legislation is not in final form,
says Wood. Draft copies of it are being
circulated for recommendations from
anyone who is interested.

duce foreign objects into the uterus
because of the increased possibility of
infection, a doctor prefers to have the
woman wait 42 days to determine if
she is pregnant at which time she
could terminate the pregnancy.

The Legislative Task Force is
working on legislation proposed by
the Denver District Attorney’s office
dealing with the reform or abolition of
particular rape laws. Members of the
coalition are being encouraged to
register as lobbyists with the
Secretary of State either as a member
of the coalition or as a private citizen
to help get the legislation passed in
the next session of the state
legislature.

A purpose of the coalition has been
stated by Dr. Saltzman: “We're not
going to change people and we're not
going to change attitudes. We may get
some minor behavioral changes and
get the support of people in there
without too much resentment.”

ANTI-CRIME COMMISSION -

The Denver Anti-Crime Commission
has funded (through the Law
Enforcement Assistance Administra-
tion - LEAA) the Southeast Denver -
Neighborhood Services Bureau, the
Violence Research Unit at Denver
General and the District Attorney’s
Priority Prosecution Program which
gives that office “added manpower to
do a more thorough investigation of
major crimes including rape and put
more emphasis on rape investigation
than on conviction,” according to
Dave Shepard of the Anti-Crime
Commission.

In-service training for the Denver
Police Department has been funded
but the specific program has not been
completely developed. The purpose of
the training, which will include
community input, will be to (hopeful-
ly) increase the sensitivity of the line
officers to the rape victim and to his
own prejudices about the victims.

The Eastside Action Center and the
Westside Action Center have been
funded for education, know your
neighbor programs and counseling
programs. The emphasis at the
Westside Action Center will be on
victim counseling, according to Sandy
Johnson a staff member at the Center
located at 1312 Santa Fe Drive.

There is a tentative victim support
program to expand the services of the
Visiting Nurse Service at Denver
General Hospital that has yet to be
funded.

WOMEN AGAINST RAPE

WAR (Women Against Rape) has
been formed as a result of the
self-protection classes for women
offered through the Aurora Police
Department. The present goal of the
group, according to Jackie Mitchell, a
graduate of the class, is to present a
petition concerning legislation on the
treatment for convicted rapists to
state legislators.

The petition demands that rape
statutes be changed from a criminal
status to a mental disorder status.
First offenders, according to Ms.
Mitchell, would be treated until cured.
Offenders who have been convicted
more than once would have to remain
in the facility and receive treatment
commensurate with the offense.

Ms. Mitchell cites the study done by
Menachem Amir published in his book
Patterns in Forcible Rape which
concludes that rape is a common form
of learned behavior and is also a
“mental thing.” So instead of being
put into a prison where the offender
receives practically no treatment
whatsoever and usually comes out
hating women even more than before
he should be treated. Ms. Mitchell
would also like to see the government
stop wasting money on projects
studying the perspiration of the
Aborigine and start spending money
on mental health at places like the
State hospital which is understaffed
and underpaid.

She would like to see the federal
government establish one institution
in the U.S. to handle all rapists in the
country and find out what is causing
rape and cure it.

WAR intends to contact NOW for
their support of the petition and will
be working with the Denver Coalition
on Sexual Assault. WAR will be
gathering signatures for the petition
from August 15 thru August 31st at all
major shopping areas and will then
send the signatures and petitions to
every state representative in Colorado.

AURORA POLICE

The next class of Self Protection for

Big Mama Rag Vol. 3, No. 2

Monday nights from 7 to 9.

The class is limited to 100 women
and continues seven weeks. A woman
may enter at any time. Guest speakers
from the Denver District Attorney's
office, mental health agencies, ex-
perts on home security, a rape victim,

lives from groups con-

_ representatives
cerned with the problem of rape will

speak. No males are allowed in the
class - not even husbands.

To secure a place in the class a
woman should call 366-1511 and ask
for Mary Perrott.

SOUTHEAST DENVER

The only victimization program in
Denver is at the Southeast Denver
Neighborhood Services Bureau
(SEDNSB). The bureau is funded
through the Denver Anti-Crime Coun-
cil’s High Impact Program.

The SEDNSB bureau deals primarily
with youthful offenders and youth-
oriented planning for the southeast
area along with offering support and
counseling programs for victims as
well as to provide general public
education and organization for the
prevention of victimization. The
efforts of public education are
directed primarily towards Capitol Hill
since it has the highest crime rate in
the city.

Dr. Katherine Saltzman is the
Victimization Coordinator who has
been instrumental in the formation of
the 24-hour crisis line. “The victim has
been ignored while the offender has
gotten all the attention and funded
programs as a rule up to now.”

According to Mary Stage, also of
SEDNSB, the hotline has a trained
volunteer or a staff counselor
constantly available. “We provide
referrals and have professional psy-
chiatric people available to those who
need help.”

Part of the victimization program
also deals with assaults on senior
citizens. If an elderly woman is
attacked it can literally result in her
death. Broken bones, inability to get
to the store and medical expenses can
drastically change and even ruin a
woman's life.

Anyone who would like to volunteer
to work at the bureau should call
321-8192.
