4 A

Artemis  

As our consciousness is being collectively raised by one  
another; as we fill a womanspace fuller of our needs in areas like  
midwifery, herbery, music, art; as we come closer each day to  
what it truly is to be women, it strikes me funny that we are  
ignoring a basic part of that journey -- total health.  

I'm speaking about going beyond self-examinations,  
home-deliveries and herbal medicine. To Being exactly what the  
Great Mother Goddess made us to be in every way. I won't  
elaborate on that idea as a whole now, however I do want to deal  
with one specific.  

Smoking, no matter how you look at it, is destructive, not  
only to the individual doing it but all who are in her vicinity.  

I would like to take issue with the politics behind cigarette  
smoking. First and foremost it’s the Man's vice, designed to be an  
eternal profit maker for such war mongers as American Tobacco  
Company. One of the many legal vices that the people empty their  
pocketbooks over the privilege of consuming. Second, it’s a  
pacifier, one of the many offered to us from birth, rubber  
pacifiers, suckers -- to keep us in our place, keep us from  
speaking up, giving us a false sense of security. Third, it keeps  
hands busy, more often than not, too busy to be doing more  
constructive things. Many manage to smoke and perform a myriad  
of tasks at the same time, little realizing what a psychic drain it is  
to be doing two or more things at a time.  

Cigarettes have the curious property of being a stimulant  
and a depressant at the same time. Although not a stimulant in  
the purest sense, many use cigarettes either consciously or  
unconsciously to stay awake or to wake up. How many late night  
meetings, parties or rap sessions would survive without nicotine?  
How many people could go on spending money in America's bars  
without falling asleep were it not for the shock treatment received  
each time a cigarette is smoked? Although not a depressant in the  
purest sense, bear in mind the numerous people who ward off  
hunger and weight gain by lighting up. During times of stress and  
nervousness the air is clouded with a continuous stream of smoke  
that dulls the senses out of awareness. Awareness of a stressful  
situation is essential in learning how to deal with it and feeling  
that stress often motivates people to avoid making a mistake a  
second time.  

Some very primary senses are dulled also, like that of smell.  
Deadened olfactory nerves will not serve a person when needed  
to experience the full pleasure of an apple blossom. The olfactory nerve’s  
partner in delight, the taste bud, combine to give pleasure in  
culinary indulgence. This pleasure is far from what it could be for  
the smoker. I'm not sure how much credence you would lend to  
my belief that even the clarity of hearing and sight are impaired,  
but all would agree that there is little to compare with a heavy dose  
of fresh mountain air and clean lungs enhance this delight a  
hundredfold.  

I figure by now anyone who is at all concerned with their  
health and the health of their loved ones is still reading. I’m not  
communicating with you to proselytize or be self-righteous. I  
know full well that people stop hurting themselves only when they  
are ready to and all of the information or scare tactics in the world  
isn't going to change that. In some ways I can understand where  
smokers are at, I smoked for 10 years and I will not climb my  
soapbox about inconsiderate smokers.  

The purpose of this essay is to point out how we as women  
are being robbed of a more total life by indulging as individuals in  
a counter-productive vice. Imagine if you will as I do a world where  
people gained the self-love and control to stop putting these  
tubular objects in our mouths, applying flame and then inhaling  
dignity out of our lives.

One of the classics of  
American social history,  
Women’s Life and Work in the  
Southern Colonies, first pub-  
lished in 1938, was finally  
reissued in 1972, when the  
tides of history caught up with  
the book.  

$3.45 paperback  

Julia Cherry Spruill delves  
into the minutiae that makes  
the past come alive: colonial  
women's leisures and pas-  
times, their wardrobes and  
accessories - where, how and  
from what they were made.  
She tells of the rituals of  
courtship and marriage, of  
southern women’s education  
and the contents of a typical  
lady’s library.  

Women’s Life deals, in  
addition, with the lesser-  
known aspects of the female  
situation in the colonial era. In  
detail she tells of the women  
who participated in public life.  
There was Mistress Margaret  
Brent, a plantation owner in  
Maryland so powerful as to  
demand a seat in the  
Assembly at a time when  
women weren't even allowed  
to speak in church! There  
were female ferry-keepers,  
jailers, printers, and many  
other “non-feminine” occupa-  

tions in which the feminine  
were actively engaged. Wo-  
men of all classes were  
shopkeepers, artisans, tavern  
hostesses and planters. Spru-  
ill details many of these  
women; some are quite  
fascinating, such as Eliza  
Lucas. At age 17, she took  
over the management of her  
father's plantation. In addition  
to tending to the business,  
she spent much time engaged  
in agricultural experiments. It  
was she who introduced the  
cultivation and processing of  
indigo to South Carolina; it  
became a major export of the  
colonies.  

Crimes colonial women  
committed, and the punish-  
ments which followed, are  
another aspect of our social  
history one can read about in  
few other places besides  
Women’s Life. Julia Cherry  

Spruill also deals with the  
manner in which the laws and  
courts regarded women in that  
era (not very favorably) by  
quoting from numerous court  
records and newspapers.  

Women’s Life and Work in  
the Southern Colonies is a  
fascinating and thorough ac-  
count of women of the  
colonial period. It is factual,  
objective history, but by no  
means dull or dry. Quotations  
from the original sources are  
liberally scattered throughout  
the book. Women’s Life has a  
huge bibliography of primary  
sources and a complete index.  
Its publication in paperback  
makes it a welcome volume to  
anyone seriously interested in  
the history of the American  
woman.

FDA Nears Decision  
on Dalkon Shield Ban  

Nancy Heine  

No one has ever known  
exactly how the intrauterine  
(IUD) works to prevent preg-  
nancy. But the serious side-  
effects of one of  
these devices--the Dalkon Shield--  
are now a matter of public  
record: it has been responsi-  
ble for 209 septic spontane-  
ous abortions and 11 reported  
deaths.  

On June 27 of this year, the  
United States Food and Drug  
Administration (FDA) called a  
halt to the sale and distribu-  
tion of the Dalkon Shield until  
it could investigate the matter  
further. Studies were con-  
ducted and hearings held in  
August for that purpose. The  
facts are now in, according to  
Mary Carol Kelly of the FDA  
Press Office, and a statement  
on FDA findings and conclu-  
sions will come late in  
September.  

The story goes that over  
2000 years ago, camel drivers  
inserted stones in the uteri of  
their female camels to prevent  
conception and birth over long  
journeys. Not until 1970,  
though, did the IUD come into  
wide use among women.  
Alarmed by Senate hearings  
on the dangers of oral  
contraceptives but still desir-  
ing birth control, large num-  
bers of women in the United  
States gave the device a try.  

During this time the Dalkon  
Shield gained popularity a-  
mong women who had never  
been pregnant. Touted as the  
“IUD that’s changing current  
thinking about contraception,”  
the Shield claimed to  
have a lower rejection rate  
than did other IUDs for these  
women.  

The first Dalkon Shield ad,  
which appeared in medical  
journals, based its claims on a  
single study done by Hugh  
Davis, Shield co-inventor and  
medical consultant to A.H.  
Robins Co., manufacturer of  
the device. The ad claimed a  
pregnancy rate of 1.1%, an  
expulsion rate of 2.3% and a  
one year continuation rate--  
that is, the number of women  
who continue to wear the  
Shield for one year--of 94%.  

But the study was not  
conducted on women who had  
the device in place for one  
year. It was conducted on 640  
women for 3,549 “woman-  
months of use.”  

Dividing woman-months by  
the number of women in-  
volved, the average insertion  
time was only 5.5 months.  

In a later ad the A.H. Robins  
Co. recommended that a  
patient use another form of  
contraception along with the  
Shield for the first three  
months of use. An irate  
physician, testifying before  
the House Hearings on  
Medical Devices noted that  
this ad made claims based on  
a guarantee covering little  
more than two months of time  
during which the Shield is the  
only form of contraception  
recommended.  

While these ads were being  
published, A.H. Robins had in  
its files at least 10 independ-  
ently conducted studies  
showing the pregnancy rate as  
high as 4.3% and continua-  
tion rates as low as 41%.  

David Links, Director of the  
FDA Office of Medical Devic-  
es, wrote at this time that  
besides “mild puffery” the ads  
for the device seemed “rea-  
sonable and accurate.”  

Meanwhile reports of heavy  
bleeding, painful insertion,  
uterine perforation, higher  
than expected pregnancy rates  
and pregnancy complications  
began coming in from women  
using the Dalkon Shield as  
well as other IUDs. A  
physician's survey by the US  
Center for Disease Control  
revealed that IUD use led to  
more than 3,500 hospitaliza-  
tions during the first six  
months of 1973.  

Then, in May 1974 A.H.  
Robins sent out letters to  
120,000 physicians advising  
them that six deaths and 36  
septic abortions appeared to  
have been caused by the  
Shield. By June reports of  
more deaths and abortions  
forced the FDA into action.  
Sale and distribution of the  
Dalkon Shield were halted.  

In July the Department of  
Health, Education and Wel-  
fare (HEW) told its 3,000  
federally funded family plan-  
ning clinics to stop inserting  
the Dalkon IUD. But it had  
already been phasing them  
out for the past two years  
because information from  
their abortion clinics indicat-  
ed that the Shield had a higher  
pregnancy rate than had been  
advertised.  

On August 21st, the FDA  
opened a two-day public  
hearing to gather facts and  
professional opinions about  
the Shield. Physicians testi-  
fied that 1 out of every 25 IUD  
pregnancies occur outside of  
the uterus and must be  
aborted. They added that 209  
women had suffered septic (or  
infected) spontaneous abor-  
tions during Dalkon Shield  
pregnancies and that eleven  
had died of the resulting  
blood poisoning.  

Over the Labor Day holiday,  
members of the FDA Special  
Advisory Sub-Committee met  
to assess information gath-  
ered at the hearing. But the  
final verdict will not be out  
until the end of September.  

Because the FDA regards  
the IUD as a “device” rather  
than a drug, it hasn't the  
authority to require pre-mar-  
ket testing of the contracep-  
tive. Neither can it require the  
reporting of adverse reactions  
associated with the device,  
the registration of IUD manu-  
facturers nor the attachment  
of warning labels to each IUD  
package.  

Once marketed, however,  
the agency can assume a  
regulatory function if it is  
capable of proving in court  
that the product is dangerous  
to health when used as  
directed or is improperly  
labeled. But the FDA only  
takes action when it’s sure it  
can win in court.  

In the past twenty years the  
FDA has taken action against  
only one IUD. After two slow  
years of investigation, the  
action was taken just five days  
before the House Hearings on  
Medical Devices threatened to  
expose the Majzlin Spring as a  
dangerous device.  

In California the Coalition  
of Medical Rights for Women  
is not waiting for the FDA  
decision. They've filed a  
petition with the California  
Department of Health calling  
for a ban on all further sales  
and distribution of IUDs until  
they can be further tested for  
safety and the adoption of a  
regulation that would require  
manufacturers to take all  
steps necessary to inform  
women of the potential  
dangers.  

Patty Fulcher, chairperson  
of the Coalition said, “Women  
are tired of being used as  
guinea pigs for untested  
medical devices sold at  
enormous profits by large  
drug companies.”  

Spruill also deals with the  
manner in which the laws and  
courts regarded women in that  
era (not very favorably) by  
quoting from numerous court  
records and newspapers.  

Women’s Life and Work in  
the Southern Colonies is a  
fascinating and thorough ac-  
count of women of the  
colonial period. It is factual,  
objective history, but by no

woman.
