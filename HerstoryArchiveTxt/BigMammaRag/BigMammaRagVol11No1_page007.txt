Australian Black Women Protest Fascism

Excerpts from an Aboriginal
Broadsheet, reprinted from

Nov/Dec - 1982

The Commonwealth Games is
not just a sporting event,
since only those countries
with allegiance to Britain
can participate. To all in-

short Cultural Genocide.

The Federal Government has
the right to intervene in
Queensland. The Commonwealth
also has obligations under
international conventions
which it has ratified, but
which are still being
breached in Queensland. Fraser
boasts abroad as "the champ-

land rights struggle

indigenous people throughout
the world who have been dom-
inated by British Rule, it
is a "political extravaganza”
commemorating the illegal

seizure of their land. It is
an assertion of British
imperialist power. These
"Games" will be held on the
illegally seized land without
the consent of
Aboriginal people.

It is no accident that
they are being staged in
Queensland, a state controlled
by an overtly racist
dictatorship which reigns
terror with only 27% of the
vote. Queensland is the only
state in Australia which re-
tains a separate Act of Par-
liament for the control of
indigenous people. This
"Aboriginal Act" is adminis-
tered by the State Department
of Aboriginal and Islander
Advancement (or rather
"Department of Aggression,
Inhumanity and Apartheid"),
a forerunner to South Africa's
Apartheid Laws. It gives com-
plete control over Abori-
gines on reserves to all-
white managers and the white
churches. It totally denies
Aboriginal people's right to
self-determination and land.
Aboriginal reserves are set
up in areas regarded as "use-
less wasteland". Today, just
about every mining corporation
operating in Australia has
mining leases over these re-
serve lands or is trying to
buy its way in. These multi-
nationals, motivated by greed,
sit poised waiting for gov-
ernment permission to move
in and plunder Aborigines of
the last vestiges of their
land, culture, and dignity.
Aboriginal people are forced
to cope with a strange, hes-
tile and insensitive environ-
ment, geared towards European
bosses and workers. They are
left with no control. The
effects are devastating; in

rights", while blatantly ig-
noring the oppression in his
backyard.

Meanwhile, the 1982
Queensland Commonwealth Games

Bill, supposedly aimed at
countering "terrorist activi-
ties", was passed unchallenged.
Yet another fascist step to
crush Aboriginal People's
attempts at
national attention on their
struggle. Worse still--it
provides police and "concerned
citizens" with a legal
means of imprisoning, maiming and
killing Aboriginal protestors
and their supporters. (For de-
tails on the Bill, see Girls’
Own No. 8 page 22). The Bill
places no restrictions on the
"degree of force” used in the
arrest of "offenders". Under
section 16 "offenders" are
persons holding placards,
wearing badges, handing out
leaflets or other “prohibited
items" in a "notified area".
The Bill fails to state what
either “prohibited items" or
“notified areas" are. Under
the Bill any Games site and
all routes used by VIPs, as
well as surrounds of up to
16 kms, can be declared a
"security area". Thus the Bill
literally allows all of
Queensland to be placed under
"a state of emergency". Sec-
tion 42 of the Bill gives
"police officers and others"
complete immunity against
liability for any action they
take "in good faith and pur-
porting to be done for the
purposes of the Bill". It
also indemnifies the Crown
and the Police Minister
against any subsequent action.
When Aboriginals killed
whites in the defence of
their land and their rights,
it was called “murder". When
whites killed Aborigines it
was called "unavoidably
killed in consequence of their
not having surrendered."

Before the white man all of
the continent of Australia was
held by the Aboriginal people.
Australia was divided into 500
tribal areas or states, and
each tribe or state exercised
full sovereign powers with-
in its clearly defined do-
main. Although language and
dialect varied from tribe to
tribe, there was a universal
code of communication, so
enabling all tribes to com-
municate and trade the length
and breadth of the contin-
ent. Each tribe was so or-
ganised that there was no
family holding any heredi-
tary rights over the rest of
the population. The boundar-

itive parties and concen-
tration camps, Sunday after-
noon manhunts, of sexual
mutilation, of cutting
flesh off living bodies and
feeding it to dogs, of bury-
ing babies up to their necks
in sand and kicking their
heads off in front of their
mothers, and tying the sev-
ered head of a husband
around the neck of a raped
spouse."

Annihilation was turned
into "assimilation". British
governor Macquarie invited
"the natives to relinquish
their wandering, idle and
predatory habits of life and
to become industrious and

ies encompassing each tribal
area, had been established
from the beginning of time
for all time and there
could be no wars of conquest
or taking of another tribe's
domain. Since dispossession
began in 1770 with British
explorer, James Cook, the
colonial settler-state
claimed sovereignty which
has never been ceded by the
Aboriginal people.

Whole tribes were wiped
out by manhunts, rape, and
killer diseases like sy-
philis, and what historian
Rhys Jones describes as
“psychopathic sadism of pun-

useful members of our com-
munity where they will find
protection and encourage-
ment." In real terms, this
meant Aboriginal children
forcibly taken away from
their tribes and flogged for
speaking their own languages.
Aboriginal people were hung
and murdered until the 1930s
or flogged until today in
Queensland, for practising
and teaching children their
culture. Assimilation--
cultural genocide--is still
now the order of the day.
Aboriginal people always
resisted the white invaders:
"Why work for them to own

international

-- White Women connect

what's yours in the first
place?" The state of war will
continue until such time as
the immigrant settler popula-
tion and descendants recog-
nise that sovereignty over
Australia rests with the
indigenous Aboriginal people.
This war against the British
Empire/Commonwealth built

on lands seized through acts
of aggression, is waged

by indigenous people around
the globe.

20,000 to 30,000 Aborig-
inal people will be taking part
in protest actions at and
during the Commonwealth Games
to assert their rights and
land claims. The sheer number
of Aboriginal protestors and
their non-Aboriginal sup-
porters cannot be easily dis-
missed by the world and even
the government in this coun-
try. Any action taken by
indigenous people will be in
defence of their rights. If
violence erupts, it will be
the violence of the racist

settler state in a further
offensive against the indig-
enous Aboriginal people.

Give your physical support
to Aboriginal demands by
attending rallies and marches
and by boycotting and black-
banning the Games in any way
possible.

The last reported Aboriginal
shoot was 1944 when 20 Aborig-
inals were massacred by police
at Kulumburu. But the massacres
have not ended. People forced
from their land and homes will
die. The mining, pastoral for-
estry and tourism bodies are
doing this to Aboriginals con-
tinuously: In Fraser's own
vast and rich electorate, Ab-
originals now only own 600
acres of thousands of square
miles held by Australia's
richest graziers. Many are
just surviving below the pov-
erty line and dying by the age
of 35. Life expectancy for
Aboriginals is, nationally, 20
years less than for whites.

The Women Support Land
Rights Group is aware that
for some women the land ri-
ghts issue is seen as irrel-
evant to the feminist strug-

white culture, we have to
see that as white women we
have gained from the oppres-
sion of black women. TO NOT
SUPPORT THE LAND RIGHTS ISSUE
IS TO CONDONE OUR PRIVILEGES
AS WHITES.

We as feminists have al-
ways seen the self-determina-
tion of our own struggle, (i.e.:
the autonomy of the wom-
en's movement) as being cru-

solidarity

statement

gle. We as a group of femin-
ists, have been exploring
the connections between fem-
inist politics, racism and
the land rights struggle.

Our analysis of oppression
as women gives us the tools
to analyse the oppression of
others. It is this analysis
which allows us to see the
benefits the State gains from
divisions amongst oppressed
groups, e.g.: women, blacks,
lesbians and homosexuals. We
all understand how sexism
works to maintain our oppres-
sion. What many of us don't
acknowledge is how racism
works to oppress blacks and
“how we as white women help
to maintain that oppression.
No matter how much we may
wish to disassociate ourselves
from the patriarchs of

social; surely we can see that
our black sisters should be
able to determine what is
their political struggle?
Most politically active black
women have determined that
the black struggle around
meaningful land rights is the
most important struggle for
them at this time.

If as white feminists we
say “But supporting land
rights means working for
black men" we are in danger
of:

+ defining feminism as being
for white women only and land
rights as only for black men.

+ denying our black sisters’
struggle against sexism in
the black movement.

+ ignoring that black cul-
ture and values have been
colonised by white society.

We do not know how black so-
cieties have functioned in
the past. We are being racist
if we assume that Aboriginal
culture is totally defined in
terms of patriarchal culture
and values.

+ denying racism within the
women's movement, indeed
within ourselves.

- denying our black sisters
our support for their chosen
struggle--are we to support
black women only if they come
to us on our terms?

As feminists, we cannot
accept the racism of the pat-
riarchy which sees land rights
solely as a property issue. Land
rights is not solely to do
with possessing the land in
the white man's sense. Some
feminists have identified a
basic need to have a spirit-
ual base on the land.

Feminist writers have long
written on this need; some
feminists are making land av-
ailable for women in recog-
nition of this. Black activ-
ists have shown that land
rights is a much deeper issue.
As well as being a struggle
for economic and political
power, it is also to do with
the spiritual and physical
health of a people. The Abor-
iginal culture is intrinsically
tied to the land in a
way that the patriarchy can

never understand, except to
find the whole concept very
threatening. Just how threat-
ening can be gauged by the
kind of repressive legislation
that exists specifically to
oppress black women and men.
The patriarchy does under-
stand that at some deep level
the spiritual component of
Land Rights gives Land Rights
Claims a power they can only
react to by severe oppression.

However, blacks are not
just fighting for spiritual
recognition. They are waging
a material battle for the
land with the State and multi-
nationals for political and
economic control, as manifest-
ed in the current uranium
struggle, or over token pay-
ments.

Black women have chosen to
first regain their black cul-
ture from the white patriarchs
and to thereby give themselves
a cultural base from which to
fight against the white influ-
ence on black men, whose sex-
ist language and culture are
a reflection of this influ-
ence. This is not to imply
that aspects of traditional
culture are not also oppres-
sive to women. Patriarchs are
patriarchs. Our black sisters
are competent to combat this
themselves. But white femin-
