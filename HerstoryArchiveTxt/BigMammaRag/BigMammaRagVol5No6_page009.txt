Malvina Talks Art and Politics

In early June singer-songwriter  
Malvina Reynolds came to Denver to  
give two concerts. We spent a morn-  
ing with her, a morning filled with  
talk, song, munchies, and lots of  
people coming and going to get in-  
terviews, to invite her to sing, to  
talk, and to invite her to confer-  
ences. Despite the comings and go-  
ings, the interview, and the morning  
went smoothly and enjoyably.

It was an easy interview in the  
sense that Malvina, having the gift  
of talk, provided the real flow. We  
listened, talked, agreed, disagreed,  
and laughed. Here's a part of what  
happened.

BMR: Malvina, could you tell us some-  
thing biographical about how you grew  
up, and about how you became a song-  
writer?

Malvina: I was born in 1900, one child  
out of three, a child of poor parents.  
Immigrant tailors. They were social-  
ists in their outlook. That is how I  
began to understand politics very soon,  
when I was about 2 or 3 years old. So,  
my environment in San Francisco where I  
was born was in the trade union and  
socialist movements, and it's natural  
for me to think that way, however I  
find the knowledge I acquired then works  
very well, and has all these years.

It makes sense, and I have continued in  
that point of view.

My parents were very anxious for us  
to get an education. So, they worked  
hard and put us through college and  
gave us some musical education. I love  
to tell stories. I used to tell stor-  
ies to the neighborhood kids, make ‘em  
up in my head and they liked them. I  
had planned on being a teacher since I  
liked being in front of a class and  
working. I've had some very good  
teachers. I admired them and their re-  
lationship to the students, and so I  
wanted to be a teacher and a writer.  
So, over the years I got a PhD, but all  
the time the blacklist was dogging my  
steps, not openly, but every place I  
turned I would find I was being hamp-  
ered. So, that when I finally did get  
my degree, I couldn't get a teaching  
job. And I knocked around and worked  
at a number of things. I got married  
and had a daughter. She's a storyteller  
by trade, a children's librarian.

Everything that interests me. And I  
write fun songs, and children's songs  
and love songs, and I also write about  
what's happening in the world: to the  
ecology, to the developments in the  

black movement, in the women's movement,  

the anti-war movement. I think that  
people who don't write such things  
either don't know what's going on, or  
else they're blinding themselves to a  
whole area of the world and life.

As a singer, at first I was very shy  
about coming out in public although I  
had a hunch I could be a good perform-  
er, even though my voice isn't the  
greatest, but that doesn't matter. But  
I was very shy and I was never much en-  
couraged. I could tell a story about  
one of the early folksong clubs where  
the chairman would call on us, and I  
would sit on the edge of my chair hop-  
ing to be called, and sometimes the  
whole thing would go through and I  
wouldn't get a chance to sing. And  
there was one man who has since become  
a very popular songwriter - when I did  
get up to sing he would leave the room  
every time. There may have been some  
jealousy there, who knows? Anyway he's  
on the skids now and I'm going strong.  
As time went on, some other good well-  
known singers were beginning to pick up  
my songs - people like Harry Belafonte,  
Joan Baez, and the Seegers. Diana Ross  
just recorded Turn Around. Anyway,

My husband was a trade union organiz-  
er. Very effective man without a lot  
of education, but he was very well read.  
Militant, but not grim. He had a great  
sense of fun. We were married for 40  
years - always active in progressive  
politics and many causes. He died a-  
bout 5 years ago of a stroke. And  
since then I've managed pretty well,  
though I miss him. I've learned to  
live as a woman alone, fulfilling my-  
self through my work, though when he  
was alive he was very supportive.

I got into songwriting in my late  
40's, during the period of the blos-  
soming of the folksong movement. I’m  
not a folksinger. Folksingers sing tra-  
ditional songs, I write my own ones.  
I'm a writer of popular songs who has  
been very much influenced by American  
and foreign folk music. I write about  

that was very good.  
It gave us a liv-  
ing.  
My husband had this attack and  

Then, I finally got a contract with  

Columbia. That was when I was 60 years  
old. When you're 60 and you get a con-  
tract with Columbia Records, you won't  
look at the contract too closely. That  
proved to be a bad thing for me because  
in the 6 year contract I had with them  
they issued 1 album and kept promising  
me more. I had 2 albums in the can -  
traveling across country at my own ex-  
pense to record my songs, and no album  
ever came out after that first one  
which wasn't given much publicity. It  
was issued without my checking on the  
order of songs, the selection of songs,  
or the cover picture. I had to go to  
the store and buy my own album. It got  
some very good reviews, but you know it  
didn't burn up the water because it was  
political and because there were ele-  
ments in the Columbia industry that  
weren't anxious to push me. So, I had  
a hard time breaking loose of that con-  
tract. You see, I couldn't record  
these songs for anyone else but Colum-  
bia, and yet they weren't issuing them.  
Finally I had to go present my case to  
the top man in the Columbia hierarchy,  
that I was being choked off from the  
public. Finally I was freed of this  
thing. I had other experiences with o-  
ther companies and finally I'm record-  
ing my own things now.

Meantime I started singing for bene-  
fits, for parties, and found out that I  
can get on very well with an audience.  
I can present an idea the moment I  
write it practically, because the next  
day I have a show coming up, so I'll  
sing a brand new song. There's not  
many creative artists that have that  
kind of situation. The audience may  
not be in the thousands at first, but I  
have a live interested intelligent aud-  
ience to bring my stuff to.

BMR: Were there any specific incidents  
that prompted such songs as Rosie Jane,  
or were they just written out of how  
you felt about the particular issue?

Any man who is present may listen,  
Any protest, any public official, any  
physician.  
But it gives him no license to touch  
us.  
We make the decision,  
Me & Ludia & Rosie & Eve,  
We handle these things ourselves,  
You'd better believe,  
And you'd better leave.  
Chorus  
Rosie Jane,  
Are you pregnant again?  
Rosie Jane,  
You can hardly take care of the four  
You had before.  
What in heaven's name  
Were you thinking of,  
Rosie Jane, was it love?

I had an extra shot  
On top of what I'd got,  
In a word, I was drunk.  
So was Bill.  
At least I think it was Bill.  
And I forgot to take my pill.  
I guess it was God's will.  

Chorus

When that baby is a child  
It will suffer from neglect,  
Be picked upon and pecked  
And its head  
And its head  
If it's inside her it must remain  
intact  
And it cannot be murdered till it's  
born,

Malvina: Well,  
What usually happens is that some incident will  
start a song going, but into it will  
pour a number of pertinent things. I  
was driving down Skyline Blvd., south  
of San Francisco. There was some con-  
struction going on there with all the  
houses alike as far as your eye could  
see. So I scribbled a little song.

I asked my husband to take the wheel  
and I wrote this little song:  

Little boxes on the hillside  
Little boxes made of ticky-tacky  
Little boxes, little boxes,  
Little boxes all the same.  
There's a pink one and a blue one and  
a green one and a yellow one  
And they're all made out of tacky-  
tacky and they all look just the  
same.  

(From "Little Boxes")  
We were headed for an American  
Friends Service Committee conference,  
and I sang the song right off these  
scraps of paper. But you see it wasn't  
just the little houses, but into it  
poured the lifestyle of the middle-  
class. The conformity that’s been  
pressed on us all because of the mass  
production of goods and ideas and all  
kinds of things. And the song was  
picked up in South America by Victor  

Hara, one of the great beautiful song-  
writer singers, dramatists, actors,  
everything, who was killed by the Junta  
when they destroyed the democracy in  
Chile. And he wrote a song in Spanish  
called Las Casitas del Barrio Alto, and  
it was not simply a discussion of con-  
formity and the middle-class lifestyle  
but it was an indictment of the middle-  
class in a stress situation where they  
had turned their backs on their pro-  
testations of democracy, because their  
privilege was being threatened, and they  
became adjuncts of the worst repression  
that the world has ever seen, under the  
Junta in Chile. And all this is put  
into this little song.

I had been invited to a music festi-  
val in Santiago, but it was just at the  
time when the attack on the Allende  
government was taking place, and so the  
music conference never happened.

BMR: As far as I know, you're one of  
the earliest writers of feminist songs.  
The song No Hole In My Head is a fay-  
orite of Seeger and was written  
sometime in the fifties, making it  
very early for a feminist song. Could  

you tell us a little bit about what was  
going on with you when you wrote it?  

In My Head

Everybody thinks my head's full of  
nothing,  
wants to put a  
special thing in,  
Keep out sex and  
drugs,  
There's no  
revolution.  
Too bad.

I know my head's full  
of this and the other,  
on a string,  
I have my own special thing,  
There's no hole in my head.

I have lived since early childhood  
Figuring out what's going on, I,  
I know what hurts, I know what's easy,  
When to stand and when to run  
And there's no hole
