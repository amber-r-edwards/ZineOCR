Strong, Militant Fighters Have Refused

(Candace is a member of W.O.W.,  
Women Organizing Women. An anti-  
imperialist, anti-racist or-  
ganization trying to rebuild a  
strong and militant women's  
movement, W.O.W. is currently  
involved in anti-war work, re-  
productive rights work, and  
work around the RICO grand jury  
currently sitting in Manhattan,  
New York.)

The grand jury was originally  
invented to "protect" the peo-  
ple against the "tendency" of  
governments to use the "criminal  
justice system" to punish their  
critics; only to emerge during  
the McCarthy era as a tool of  
repression. However, because she  
disagrees with the political  
system in this country, (emphasis  
added) set herself above the  
government in determining the  
manner in which she will or will  
not operate within this country.  
..However, she is making an  
attack upon the government and  
the government is responding,  
and my position as a judicial  
officer of this government, I  
feel I have no other alternative  
except to find her in contempt...  
and place her in jail..."  
When individuals are called  
before a grand jury she or he  
has basically only two choices,  
talk to the grand jury or go  
to jail. Since 1970 hundreds  
of political activists and  
principled people have been  
jailed for refusing to cooper-  
ate with federal grand juries  
aimed at destroying political  
resistance.

It was not until the late 1960's  
that the Internal Security Di-  
vision of the Justice Department  
pioneered and perfected its  
extensive use against the left,  
Black political activists, and  
the women's movement. It has  
become one of the most powerful  
instruments of political repres-  
sion.

The federal grand jury now  
sitting in Manhattan is doubly  
repressive because it is inves-  
tigating under the Racketeer  
Influence and Corrupt Organi-  
zations (RICO) Act. The  
RICO Act became law in 1970,  
designed to keep "organized  
crime" from taking over labor  
unions. You can be found guilty  
as part of a RICO conspiracy  
merely because of past associa-  
tions or friendships with a  
group; some of whose members  
could have been, but were not  
necessarily charged with a  
crime. You can be subject to  
twenty years in jail and/or a  
$20,000 fine.

U.S. Attorney John Martin,  
spearheading the RICO grand  
jury, is investigating organiza-  
tions who want "to put an end  
to the U.S. government as we  
know it" and "who have a com-  
mon belief in socialism." Grand  
juries are purely political.  
Federal District Court Judge  
G. Goettel has clearly indica-  
ted that political beliefs are  
enough to cause an individual  
to be jailed. He said, "with  
respect to the witness’ political  
principle. A witness cannot  
cooperate "just a little"  
because he or she gives up  
the right to challenge the po-  
litical nature of the subpoena  
and the grand jury investiga-  
tion--with the first question  
answered.

A recent Grand Jury Project  
editorial by Daniel Brogin in  
the March/April 1982 edition  
of Quash listed eight of the  
most fundamental arguments for  
non-collaboration.

Collaboration:  
1) with grand juries and other  
investigative bodies such as  
the Senate Subcommittee on  
Terrorism not only enables the  
government to accomplish its  
political goals, but also in-  
creases and reinforces its  
power. 2) can increase the pow-  
er of intelligence agencies  
and bodies by widening the  
sources of information avail-  
able to them. 3) can increase  
the ability of intelligence  
agencies and bodies to coor-  
dinate their activities. 4) only  
splits what unity does exist.  
5) can endanger far more people  
in ways that you have no way  
of foreseeing. 6) can endanger  
yourself. 7) can undermine or  
destroy your integrity and cre-  
dibility within the community  
in which you work and organize.

Seven people are currently  
jailed in New York for non-  
collaboration. As Bernadine  
Dohrn's contempt hearing  
statement that she is not being  
jailed for anything she did; I  
would have to differ with that  
completely. She has,  

Roshan, an anti-imperialist  
activist, was subpoenaed, held  
in contempt for refusing to  
testify and jailed. On Dec. 30  
she was temporarily released  
after an appeals court ruled  
her contempt hearing violated  
due process. She was resubpoe-  
naed and once again jailed on  
Feb. 5, 1982. On Nov. 25, '81,  
Jerry Gaines, a community worker  
from Mississippi was sub-  
poenaed, and on March 1, '82,  
was jailed for non-collabora-  
tion. On Dec. 2, a paralegal  
worker with Bronx Legal Services  
and a member of the National  
Task Force for COINTELPRO  
Litigation and Research for the  
last five years, was jailed for  
refusing to collaborate. On  
Jan. 27, '82 she was granted  
bail pending an appeal concerning  
her contempt citation, but jailed  
again on March 9, 1981.  
(COINTELPRO is a now discredited  
and illegal program that was  
instituted in the late 60's by  
the FBI. Its purpose was to  
disrupt and destroy left  
organizations and National  
Liberation Movements. Its  
primary target was the Black  
Liberation Movement.) On April  
21, '82 Asha Thornton was  
arrested as a material witness,  
held for three weeks and then  
subpoenaed before the grand jury,  
held in contempt and jailed.  
On May 14, '82 Shaheem Jabbar  
was subpoenaed, and then jailed  
for contempt on June 3, '82.  
Asha and Shaheem are both  
associated with the Black  
Acupuncture Advisory Association  
of North America (BAAANA).  
BAAANA was raided March 26, '82  
by over 100 federal/NYPD agents  
who refused to show their search  
warrants until the search was  
over and refused lawyers ac-  
cess to their clients. Finally  
our blank subpoenas were filled  
out at the time of the raid...  
they were illegal and later  
withdrawn. BAAANA is a  
revolutionary health care cen-  
ter and school in the Black  
community. On May 19, '82  
Bernadine Dohrn, a former leader  
of Students for a Democratic So-  
ciety (SDS) and the Weather  
Underground Organization (WUO)  
was jailed for non-collabora-  
tion. On May 24, '82 Dr. Alan  
Berkman, a physician who  
has treated political prison-  
ers and prisoners of war, re-  
fused to testify and was jailed.  
Berkman interceded on behalf of  
Solomon Brown (Nyack Freedom  
Fighter) after his neck was  
broken by Rockland County  
Sheriffs.

None of these people have  
been charged with any crime,  
all refuse to be terrorized  
by the government, taking a  
firm stand of non-collabora-  
tion.

(An eighth: grand jury resis-  
tor, Norberto Cintron, a mem-  
ber of the Liga Socialista  
Puertorriquena (Puerto Rican  
Socialist League), returned  
to Puerto Rico after having  
served 17 months for refusing  
to collaborate with the federal  
grand jury investigating the  
attack on a Navy bus in  
Sebana Seca, Puerto Rico. Then  
just three days later he was  
sent back to jail for refusing  
to cooperate with the same grand  
jury.)

At present the people who  
have been called before the  
grand jury are either directly  
involved in Black Liberation  
or are those who see that  
movement as the key issue in  
the struggle for the liberation  
of all oppressed and working  
people. Historically movements  
by Third World People have  
undergone more severe repression  
than other progressive movements.  
Repression is not new to  
progressive movements; as can  
be seen by remembering the  
Alien and Sedition Acts, the  
Fugitive Slave Act, the  
hanging of the Haymarket  
martyrs, the Palmer Raids,  
attacks on the Communist Party  
and the CIO (union) in the  
1930's, the McCarthy era and  
attacks on Civil Rights  
Workers. For Blacks this his-  
tory of repression includes  
slavery and the plantation  
system, lynching and murder to  
a degree not seen by the rest  
of us. The mainly white left  
organizations can point to  
their involvement in or sup-  
port of the Black Liberation  
Struggle which has caused them  
to be singled out. It is their  
specific political positions  
which are being imprisoned.  

Black Panthers, Black  
Nationalists, Black activists  
and other Third World groups  
and individuals can point to  
assassinations (Martin Luther  
King, Malcolm X), police  
killings (Fred Hampton, Mark  
Clark, Anna Mae Aquash, and  
citizens throughout Black and  
Third World communities),  
excessively long prison terms  
(Puerto Rican Nationalists from  
the early 1950's, the FALN,  
Assata Shakur, Leonard Peltier,  
the RNA (Republic of New Afrika)  
and prison murders (Angel  
Rodriguez, George Jackson and  
many more). It is clear the  
government is threatened by the  
people who have been subpoenaed  
by the RICO grand jury. It is

MY NAME IS FULANI-ALI.

I am a  
Black woman  
New Afrikan woman  
Muslim woman  
revolutionary woman  
and mother  

part of you!

Throughout most of my life,  
I have loved my people, have  
prayed for my people, I have  
cried for my people, I have  
worked for my people.

On October 27, 1981, I was  
unjustly arrested in Byra-  
town, Mississippi, with two  
adults and twelve children.  
They were all handcuffed and  
taken to jail with me, in-  
cluding the children (9 months  
to 13 years old). I was framed  
and it was proven. So I was  
released after nine days (7  
of them spent in the hole).  
Yet I was subpoenaed on the  
day of my release to appear  
before A.R.I.C. grand jury  
investigating the Brink's in-  
cident in Nyack, N.Y. They  
asked for my fingerprints,  
(taken 10 times already) my  
handwriting (I have signed  
prison forms), my hair and all  
my knowledge of everyone and  
anyone they choose to demand  
information about. Twice I  
stood in the federal court  
and asked them to show cause  
for railroading me. They  
refused.

It is necessary to confront  
the state in this racist at-  
tack.

It is also no coincidence  
that the government prefers to  
subpoena women in general and  
especially women with young  
children. Four of the five  
men now jailed are mothers of  
young children. When Jerry  
Gaines was jailed March 1,  
she was chastised by the judge  
for jeopardizing her eight  
children. She responded, "I  
want you to know that I do  
practice being a good mother,  
and I raise my children to be-  
lieve in God. I teach them not  
to lie, cheat, steal, and I  
practice that...I feel if I  
give testimony and I say a  
name, I fear that maybe some  
innocent people, you know  
another family with children,  
they could go to their homes,  
just like they did mine, and  
do a whole upset with the fa-  
mily." The assistant U.S. At-  
torney, in a cynical argument  
against bail pending appeal of  
the contempt sentence stated  
"...in addition to the  
effect of a possible 18 months  
incarceration, you would also  
like to think that Ms. Gaines’  
motherly love, her sentiment  
and concern with her children  
would have an additional coer-  
cive effect."

Bernadine Dohrn in a state-  
ment to the press on May 17,  
'82 noted, "U.S. Attorney  
John Martin has singled out  
women, mainly Black women and  
mothers to imprison in this  
medieval fashion. Apparently  
he thinks we are weak. He is  
using this grand jury illegal-  
ly to gather information on  
the most vigorous opponents  
of wars against the Third  
World, racist attacks on the  
Black community, and the as-  
sault against women and the  
poor." March 10, Yaasmyn Fula  
made a statement to the grand  
jury before she was jailed a  
second time: "For my son, who  
has never been separated from  
me during his four years, this  
ordeal has affected him great-  
ly...It is not easy explaining  
to a four year old why I am  
in jail, that I go to jail to-  
day so that he may be free  
from the threat of incarcera-  
tion tomorrow...You have gi-  
ven me a choice. Either I  
violate the codes of conduct  
I believe I must uphold and  
violate my personal integrity,  
or I go to jail. I choose to  
go to jail." (In raising the  
issue of "motherhood" it is  
easy to illustrate how the  
government's sexist view of  
women is being used.)

they'll come for you in the  
afternoon. If we allow Black  
people to be dealt with  
individually today, then the  
United States will feel free  
to deal with us in such a  
manner until there are none  
of us left to struggle. Wake  
up! Get up! Stand up!

To all of my family, my  
comrades, my people, I love  
you and I will continue to  
work for our liberation  
wherever I go.

The struggle for land con-  
tinues.

of the National Task Force

gram Research & Litigation,  
and Asha Sundiata, a worker  
for the National Committee to  
Defend New Afrikan Freedom  
Fighters, are both incarcer-  
ated for refusing to talk to  
the grand jury. They are both  
serving terms of 18 months  
and they too have children  
who need our financial and  
moral support.
