Because of a recent call for  
the boycott of King Soopers  
Discount Chain Stores, Den-  
ver Metro and Clara Brown  
Chapters of the National Or-  
ganization for Women wish to  
clarify their reasons for taking  
this action. N.O.W. has  
become distressed at what we  
see as a change in King  
Soopers policy regarding peti-  
tioning. We have understood  
this policy to mean in the past  
that petitioning be allowed by  
King Soopers so long as there  
was no coercion or harassment  
of shoppers.  

Because of recent activities  
of Wake-up Colorado, a group  
opposed to the Equal Rights  
Amendment, and numerous  
reports of harassment, coer-  
cion, and misrepresentation of  
the petition from persons  
unaffiliated with either N.O.W.  
or Wake-up Colorado, N.O.W.  
understands this to mean that  

King Soopers has changed its  
policy. Since a decision was  
not made by King Soopers  
officials to take action con-  
cerning the harassment, the  
call for the boycott was made.  
The policy of the National  
Organization for Women has  
always been to encourage free  
and open debate of any and all  
issues, including those sur-  
rounding the Equal Rights  
Amendment, and because of  
this, there is no opposition to  
King Soopers policy that pro-  
vides a place for this kind of  
exchange. But since King  
Soopers has chosen not to stop  
the harassment going on in  
their parking lots and stores,  
N.O.W. feels it has no choice  
but to boycott the stores.  
King Soopers, a subsidiary of  

Dillon Corporation, and N.O.W.  
representatives will be meet-  
ing again.

Yoshimura Fights Guilt by Association  

Nancy Holland  

“The Vietnam War (probably  
because of my experiences of  
being a Japanese American)  
and the woman's struggle  
were the main issues that  
helped me shape my subjec-  
tive, gut-level feelings of the  
struggle to the more objective  
political one.”  

Wendy Yoshimura, Nov, 1975.  

Wendy Yoshimura will soon  

go on trial for charges filed  
four years ago that she  
possessed bombs. Pre-trial  
hearings for the thirty-two  
year old Japanese American  
local artist and activist are  
drawing to a close in Oakland.  
Yoshimura was indicted in  
1972 on four counts involving  
possession of explosives,  
knowingly, unlawfully and  
with intent to use them to  
destroy and injure although  
evidence shows only indirect  
association.  

Police discovery of explosives  
in a Berkeley garage in late  
March, 1972 led to the arrest  
of three men who entered the  
garage. The three and  
Yoshimura were indicted by  
an Alameda grand jury. All  
counts involve possession of  
illegal items found in the  
garage. The three men made  
a deal to plead guilty to one  
count and the others were  
dropped. Yoshimura pleaded  
not guilty to all charges.  

Guilt by Association  

Another charge, that of being  
a fugitive, was dropped at her  
arraignment on the day of her  
arrest. The F.B.I. arrested  
Patty Hearst and Yoshimura  
in a S.F. apartment on Sept-  
ember 18, 1975. Yoshimura  
went underground in April  
1972 following police arrest of  
several of her acquaintances.  
Defense Gains  

Since Yoshimura’s arrest in  
September, defense attorneys  
have been meticulously chal-  
lenging the charges. The  
defense successfully argued  
for reduction of bail, dismissal  
of one of the vague charges  
and suppression of evidence  

stated that the police officer  
“had no right to enter the  
apartment” and that the “im-  
proper entry was exploited.”  
Although Japanese Ameri-  
can supporters were relieved  
that the court ordered Yoshi-  
mura’s release, a statement  
by the Fair Trial Committee  
stressed that “bail in this case  
is severe, punitive, and exces-  
sive.” One of the committee’s  
primary goals was release  
because “Ms. Yoshimura can  
not receive a fair trial without  
the freedom to aid her attor-  
neys in the preparation of her  
case.”

Wendy Yoshimura met the press at the gate of Santa Rita jail  
after her release on $25,000 bail. She is accompanied by Mary  
Ann Takagi, the member of the Fair Trial Committee to whom  
the court granted custody of Yoshimura during the trial, and  

Although no evidence dir-  
ectly connects Yoshimura to  
the illegal items, she faces  
trial because of her association  

with the three men, her  
activism and her access to the  
garage. Several boxes of  
clothes, magazines and paints  
belonging to Yoshimura were  
stored in the garage but she  
herself had not entered the  
garage for several months  
prior to the discovery of  
explosives.  

Prosecuting attorney Horner  
contends responsibility for the  
items in the garage is “shared  
equally by all” who had access  
to it. In addition, Horner  
charges Yoshimura with guilt  
by her subsequent association  
with members of the S.L.A.  
This charge has no legal  
bearing on the 1972 charges  
which are the only ones against  
Yoshimura. Horner loudly  
announced to the court that  
“she associated herself with  
the most wanted fugitives in  
the U.S.” He further stated,  
without evidence and contrary  
to her right to due process,  
that she committed “grave  
crimes” and was linked to  
“terrorist activities.”  

Yoshimura faces trial only on  
the 1972 grand jury charges.  

from an illegal apartment  
search.  

The charge was dismissed in  
early December on the basis  
that it was not sufficiently  
specific. It concerned posses-  
sion of “substances and mat-  
erials with the intent to make  
destructive devices and explo-  
sives.”  

Bail was reduced from  
$250,000 to $25,000. When  
Horner strenuously objected  
to release of the former  
fugitive, the defense remin-  
ded the court that Yoshimura,  
who was born in an American  
concentration camp, had rea-  
son to distrust the govern-  
ment’s legal system. Judge  
Wilson agreed with the de-  
fense that widespread Japan-  
ese American support insured  
Yoshimura’s appearance in  
court.  

In March, Judge Pulich ruled  
that information obtained  
from a 1972 search of an  
apartment, allegedly that of  
Yoshimura, could not be in-  
troduced as evidence. Pulich

Love  

Just after Yoshimura’s re-  
lease from jail on December  
19, she, supporters and attor-  
neys held a press conference  
at the gates of Santa Rita,  
Alameda County Jail. Wendy  
expressed her gratitude to  
supporters. She sent greetings  
to her cell mates and her love  
to all people above ground  
and underground who believe  
in human justice.”  

The defense continues to  
challenge the state’s evidence  
in hearings, which are being  
held weekly in Judge Pulich’s  
court, Department Four of the  
Alameda County Courthouse,  
1225 Fallon.

Denver WRC Women Protest End of Funds  

Kate Sharp  

For the past 2½ years the  
Denver Women's Resource  
Center, 25 E. . Ave., has  
successfully operated as part  
of Denver City and County’s  
Manpower Project, function-  
ing as a branch of the Virginia  
Neal Blue Centers. Now, the  
City and County is ending all  
funding of the Resource Cen-  
ter.  

Volunteers at the center  
(calling themselves the Volun-  
teer Committee) are angered  
at this move and have written  
and are presently circulating a  
statement attesting to their  
success and protesting the  
government's move. The  
statement reads in part: “The  
staff at the [Resource] center  
have . . . dedicated them-  
selves to identifying and re-  
sponding to the needs of  
women in the Denver Metro  
area. Their services, which  
have included in-depth em-  

ployment counseling and  
career development, as well as  
information, referrals, special  
programs and workshops,  
have been provided free of  
charge to all women regard-  
less of economic level, age,  
cultural background, and re-  
ligious or political affiliation.  
A study of client income (July  
through October 1975) indi-  
cates that 67.2% of women  
counseled at the Denver  
Branch had incomes between  
$0 and $4,799 per year. ... in  
1975, the center staff coun-  
seled 1,784 clients. These  
clients were counseled at a  
cost of $32.72 per client to the  
City and County of Denver.  
This cost is incredibly low,  
compared with that of other  
agencies offering comparable  
services.” The statement goes  
on to mention 26 workshops on  
“employment-related concerns  
of women” which were  

held in 1975. The statement  
concludes in a tone of protest:  

“Disposition of the Volun-  
teer Committee—  

1) It is unacceptable that a  
public service agency with this  
record of accomplishment is  
not being refunded.  

2) It is further unacceptable  

that the only agency especially  

instituted for the women of  
Denver and for their concerns,  
must close its doors.  

Objectives of the Volunteer  
Committee—  

1) Having witnessed the  
dedication and competence  
with which the Center is run,  
as evidenced by hard data, as  
well as by our own observa-  
tion, we protest its closing.  

2) We wish to inform the  
community of the facts and  
thereby stimulate interest and  
concern, hoping that this type
