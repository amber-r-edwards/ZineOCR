Surviving in Style: Three Greats

Constance Perenyi

I feel as if I’ve reached a crisis
point - I write those words, and
the images evoked seem too drastic,
but my body, my mind reflect them
like a mirror. I stare into the
glass and see myself about to get
sick - tired, pale, encircled and
circled, I have talked about taking
care of myself; I'm learning, too,
but am not doing as well as I would
like to think. Tonight, I am hurting,
feeling so drained that I can actual-
ly see how I have given other people
power and control over my energy.
I think I am close to letting go of
that though - it just takes too much
to hold on, to be dragged behind
the machinery of other people's ex-
pectations. My eyes stare back dark-
ly, warning me, encouraging me to
think of myself first. The lesson
of many therapies...

Tonight, I have made time for my-
self to write about women artists
and aging. Having put off this task
as often as the collective has de-
layed the production of this issue,
I feel tremendous pressure to make
use of my art historical knowledge.
Instead, I escape into my journal.

And I see that I am dealing with
the theme.

When I began learning about women
artists, my primer was a book by
Elizabeth Baker and Thomas Hess en-
titled Art and Sexual Politics. As
my own politics had just begun to
hatch, I bought into the book's
premise that there have been no
great women artists. In many ways,
that is true, but only when we
accept the limited patriarchal de-
finition of greatness.

But now, having passed through var-
ious stages of fury and resolution,
I am angered by the very question
"Why have there been no great women
artists?" Even asking it seems pre-
feminist to me. It is important to
examine our oppression throughout

Dealing with Youth, Age

Fran Day

Children's books often present one

old person who represents a general-

ized picture of all old people. Few

books describe the complexities in-

volved; diversity is rarely recog-

nized. Even though older people vary

as much as young ones, children's

books present a simplified view; be-
havior is stereotyped, problems are

either minimized or magnified.

The old people that are included
are usually grandparents. This pro-
motes the myth that all people have
children. These grandparents are of-
ten presented as grandparents only,
not as whole people. Their identity
is often recognized only through their
interactions with their grandchildren
and children.

Have you examined the ways in which
aging and older people are presented
in books for children? How many are
grandparents? How many are presented
as whole, interesting people with
a life of their own? What do books
tell our young people about what it

means to grow older?

I grew up pretty much as everyone
else grows up and one day seven years
ago found myself saying to myself:

I can't live where I want to - I can't
go where I want to - I can't do what
I want to - I can't even say what I
want to. School and things that
painters have taught me even keep
me from painting as I want to. I
decided I was a very stupid fool
not to at least paint as I wanted to
and say what I wanted to when I
painted as that seemed to be the only
thing I could do that didn't concern
anybody else but myself - that was
nobody's business but my own.
Georgia O'Keeffe

from an exhibition catalogue, 1923

If you have something to say, you
develop a means, a structure by which
to unfold. If the creativity is there
the impulse to do your work or art
naturally finds its own unique order
and is stamped by the particular
artist and that is art.

Louise Nevelson
"Do Your Work" from Art and Sexual
Politics

a woman perhaps who's endured many
insults, and who forgives everybody
and nobody. a woman who doesn't be-
lieve in influence unless you are
following your own track. a woman it
seems to me absolutely fearless of
saying what she thinks. after all
she doesn't depend on people. the
work is what counts and the work
is so fine and the people like the
work so much that they pay her to
live without any people.

Jill Johnston
"Agnes Martin: Surrender and Solitude"
from Gullible's Travels

Well, it made you take time to look
at what I saw and when you took
time to really notice my flower you
hung all your own associations with
flowers on my flower and you write
about my flower as if I think and
see what you think and see of the
flower - and I don't.

Georgia O'Keeffe
from Georgia O'Keeffe, Viking Press

The whole slant of this article
is a personal interpretation of the
nature of art and the so-called na-
ture of women. And to comment fur-
ther in depth would mean a line-by-
line analysis, and that of course
would interrupt my art.

Louise Nevelson
"Do Your Work"

do we have to give honor in person
to our sages standing outside the
gates of the world, or bother them
with ideas of themselves that they
don't have themselves and be bothered
ourselves by ideas of ourselves they
may have that we don't or bother at
all. I don't know.
Jill Johnston
"Agnes Martin..."

I have not had enough time to make
my art lately, and that makes me un-
happy. Having learned that not making
art means not taking care of myself,
I know what I have to do. I have to
reclaim time for myself and risk being
called apolitical. How does a feminist
artist fit into this movement? What
will happen to me if I don't claim
my own space? What kind of old woman
will I be if I don't learn to take
care of myself now?

Like Jill Johnston, I don't know...

I had no intention of mentioning the
despairing word feminism, Agnes was
born in 1912 and it doesn't take much
imagination to see that she's better off
in the desert throwing mud at her
adobe and polishing her green truck
than I am going around meeting hundreds
of strange women who might have nothing
more in common than electricians and
philosophers but who in the name of
feminism take issue with your four
syllable words so we can all be the
same that is to say feminists...
Jill Johnston

We have the work.

I know that I am feeling this re-
sistance because I am tired of try-
ing to fit everything into the small
amounts of time I can save for myself.
But I also know that my world is
significantly different than those
of O'Keeffe, Nevelson, and Martin.
Much of my strength comes from my
woman identification. And somewhere
between total isolation and self-
sacrificing commitment there lies
an ideal world for me and other con-
temporary women artists. I only hope
that I survive as grandly as my
predecessors. And that all women will
learn how rich our heritage is.

A young potter came to the Ranch
and as I watched him work with the
clay I saw that he could make it
speak. The pots that he made were
beautiful shapes - very smooth - near to
sculpture. I hadn't thought much a-
bout pottery but now I thought that
maybe I could make a pot too - maybe
a beautiful pot - it could become still
another language for me.

I knotted the clay and coiled it -
knotted it and cooked it. I tried to
smooth it and I made very bad pots.
He said to me, "Keep on, keep on - you
have to work at it - the clay has a mind
of its own." He helped me with this
and that and I finally have several
pots that are not too bad, but I can-
not yet make the clay speak - so
must keep on.

Georgia O'Keeffe, age 92

The whole world has thought up to
now in fragments. Now I think
the door has opened. The level of a-
wareness has increased in women so
naturally she will have to, by her
very nature, hit heights of crea-
tivity that have been closed to her
before.

Louise Nevelson, age 80

the vague shapes she places on the known
rather than the seen suggests innate
ideas which she sometimes calls a
memory of perfection. Agnes Martin:
a study in the memories of per-
fection. "the ocean is deathless / the
islands rise and die / quietly come,
quietly go / a silent swaying breath /
I wish the idea of time would drain /
out of my cells and leave me / quiet
even on this shore.”
Jill Johnston on Agnes Martin, age 68
