Rigoberta Menchú - "I Can Only Struggle"

(Collective note: The follow-
ing article is reprinted from
Connexions, an international
women's quarterly, Fall, 1982.

from Unomasuno, a Mexican daily,

The following report is by
Rigoberta Menchú, a Quiché
Indian from Guatemala. The
Guatemalan people, 70% of
whom are Indians, descendants
of the Mayans, have been rob-

guatemala

bed of their land for 400
years. The patrones own near-
ly all of the fertile land,
and have become rich through
the exploitation of the peo-
ple. Much of the inexpensive
coffee and cotton we of the
West are able to enjoy has
been grown on the land stolen
from indigenous peoples such
as the Quiché.

Rigoberta Menchú has re-
cently been bringing her
story (which is, as she says,
the story not only of her own
pain, but of the pain of all
of her people) to the people
of the U.S., to groups in
solidarity with Central Amer-
ica, to lawyers, to members
of Congress. This is a cour-
ageous action. She has seen
most of her family murdered,
and certainly she will be
in danger upon her return to
Guatemala. Yet, as she ex-
plains, struggle is the only
alternative for her, as it is
for her people.

My name is Rigoberta Men-
chú. I was born in the region
of Quiché and learned to
speak Spanish 13 years ago.

I have neither a mother nor a
father, and I will explain
why.

First I must tell you that
we Indians in Guatemala have
no childhood. We have always
suffered from repression and
exploitation. I began earning
my living at the age of 8. I
worked on the south coast of
the Pacific on the estates of
the patrones. I decided to
start working because I could
no longer stand seeing my ex-
hausted mother's pained face
--always picking either cof-
fee or cotton with a new-
born baby on her back and my
hungry brothers and sisters
surrounding her.

We left the mountains
where we lived to work on the
estates because my father on-
ly had a small piece of land
that yielded just enough corn
and beans to feed us for 4 or
5 months. The rest of the
year we were forced to work
on the plantations. Then we
would go back to our place

in the mountains. That was
our life; that is why I say

I had no childhood.

My mother and father were
responsible for our community.
When people had difficulties
or were sick, they came to
my parents. My parents had
started the village along
with other people whom my
father called together. All
of them had devoted them-

selves to clearing and sow-
ing the land. But the earth
barely yielded anything at
first. They had to wait years
for the first harvest. And
when the village finally had
a cornfield and some beans,
the patron came and said

that the land belonged to
him. Then my father, the on-
ly one who spoke some Spanish,
was chosen to settle things
with the authorities.

He traveled around seeking
support to get the patrones
to leave us in peace. But his
complaints went unheeded. They
sent him from place to place;
they demanded that he get a
lawyer. Almost all of his
time was given to the commun-
ity and that meant that he
didn't have time to work
enough. We, his children,
worked in his place.

As a child I never went
into town. Our customs don't

allow a girl to go alone--at
least two people must go to-
gether. Our life is communal;
in our village there is a
community house where we
gather and where we cele-
brate. When we were very
young, our parents taught us
that we must remain true to
our ancestors, our culture,
and our traditions. For ex-
ample, before sowing seeds,
we ask the earth permission
to inflict wounds. For us,
the earth is holy; only for
our livelihood do we have
the right to hurt her. When
we chop down a tree to build
a house, we beg for nature's

forgiveness. It is not our
right even to pick flowers.
In 1973, when I was 15,
my father was arrested for
the first time. He was ac-
cused of creating a disturb-
ance and of threatening
Guatemala's sovereignty. My
mother went in search of a
lawyer; she had to leave us
alone. While my father was
in prison, the rich patrones
came, and since none of us
spoke Spanish, they intimid-
ated us. They said the land
belonged to them, and they
threatened us with guns.
They went into our houses and
broke all our things, even
our pots which were made of
clay; they broke everything.
At that time, we still be-
lieved that our only enemy
was the big landowner. It
was not yet clear to us that
all the rich people exploit
and persecute us, the peas-

ants.

We began to organize our-
selves, and this resulted in
even greater repression.
Then my father was released
from prison. He had gotten
to know a Ladino (people of
Spanish descent or cultural
values) there who was a po-
litical prisoner, and who
had explained to him that
the enemy is not just the
patron who wanted to rob us
of our land. My father re-
alized that our struggle
could no longer be fought
as it had been in the past,
and he chose to work with
the underground. So he was
no longer at home. We never
knew where he went because
he knew that our lives would
be in danger if we were in
contact with him.

My 14-year-old brother
was only the secretary of
a cooperative in town, but
the army abducted him. They
held him for 16 days. They
tortured him--tore out his
fingernails, cut out his
tongue, cut up the soles of
his feet, burned his skin.
I saw him afterwards with
my own eyes, and I'll never
forget it. The army had
brought us together, four
or five hundred peasants,
saying they would show us
how they had tortured the
"guerrillas," and telling
us, "If you get involved
with this Communism, this
is what we'll do to you."
And I saw my brother there.
In the end, they poured
gasoline over him and the
other prisoners and set
them on fire. We all saw
this. So you can imagine
how much rage we have. Fin-
ally the soldiers left,
shouting, “Long live the
army! Long live President
Lucas! Death to the guer-

rillas!"

After that, my father went
away, saying there was a
great deal he had to do for
his people, that he must go
from town to town telling what
had happened. That was the
last we saw of him. A little
later, my mother decided to
travel around and talk with
people about what she had wit-
nessed. She said, "As a woman,
I have an obligation to make
my experiences known in order
to prevent other mothers from
suffering as I have." She took
along my youngest sister. My
