Attacks On Home Births In Illinois

ed. note: The attacks on Homebirth Organizations and midwives and the increase in Caesarean sections as a "routine method of birthing...as defensive medicine” are an indication of the constant attempt of the medical profession to keep women's health and money controlled by men. As in all the issues that make up the demand to CONTROL OUR OWN BODIES: i.e. childcare, healthcare, sex education, parenting, abortion, safe environment, prostitution, rape, contraception and sexual expression, there are no safe places for us to be. The home is no woman's castle.

- Association For Home International

Tonya Brooks

After winning a substantial decision in the Appellate Court, on July 30, 1980, the Illinois Attorney General appealed the case against the Association for Childbirth at Home, International to the Illinois Supreme Court. In the lengthy decision by the Illinois District 4 Appellate Court, Judges Green, Mills, and Lewis found:

1) That based on the 1958 Supreme Court ruling of Alabama vs. NAACP, the State could not require the Association For Childbirth At Home, International (ACHI) to submit the names of its membership or names of physicians and midwives doing home births;

2) That ACHI's right to teach medical information was covered by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution;

3) That the list of items subpoenaed from ACHI by the Illinois Attorney General's office had no bearing on ACHI's right to certify childbirth educators whether certification constituted consumer fraud;

4) That an organization engaged in education was not covered by the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act.

Judge Green stated, "We share defendants' concern with the scope of investigative power given by the Act (to the Attorney General)...We are convinced that the complaint shows on its face that the defendants are engaged involving an exercise of rights protected by the First Amendment...We conclude that ordering discovery which could be directed against such conduct (certifying childbirth educators and teaching parents home birth classes) would be violative of defendants' constitutional rights."

A brief History: In June of 1978 two members of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists (ACOG), Drs. Skagg and Fraed, complained to an assistant Attorney General's office because ACHI Certified Childbirth educator, Catherine Feral, took a young woman with toxemia and an eighth-grade education personally to an OB/GYN specialist and explained the young woman had requested a home birth but was not a good candidate. She asked him to see to it she got a good hospital birth experience. The OB did not lodge a formal complaint. Had he done so ACHI would have received a copy. On innuendo, a call from the Illinois Attorney General's office, "Consumer Fraud" division sent the California Department of Organized Crime and the Buena Park Police Department to the ACHI International office. The ACHI office, composed of mothers and various babies, gave them ACHI pamphlets and a newsletter. In the meantime, a call to every department of the Attorney General's office assured ACHI there was NO investigation in progress. It was a lie. In five days 71 items were subpoenaed from ACHI and we were given 20 days to comply and denied an extension. Among these items were:

- Names, addresses, work and home phones of all parents who have taken ACHI's Childbirth Classes in Illinois, the USA and the World

- Details of births by ACHI grads in Illinois and the rest of the USA

- A detailed list of all ACHI classes which have been or will be held in Illinois, the USA, and the World

- Names and addresses of all doctors, nurse-midwives, midwives, and other sources of help for people interested in homebirth

- Info about any ACHI teacher who has been present in any capacity at a home delivery in detail

- Statistical data collected by ACHI pertaining to home birth

- Does ACHI provide correspondence courses by mail to prospective parents and teachers? Explain

- What research was done to prepare the lesson material used by ACHI

- What is the highest academic year completed by Tonya Brooks and what are her qualifications to teach childbirth at home

- Has C.C.E. performed any medical or surgical procedure during childbirth at home

- Has C.C.E.'s been compensated for assisting at the delivery of a baby. List who, when and where

- What medical facilities does ACHI "require" at home deliveries

- List all instances where ACHI teachers have had electrical facilities available in the home at the time of birth that could monitor fetal heartbeat. List name of teacher, dates, and names of mothers

- Approximately how many babies had complications at birth: a) requiring a doctor's attention, b) resulting in death: 1) the baby, 2) the mother

- Is silver nitrate provided for newborn babies by ACHI? List each time it was used and name and address of the mother

The subpoena's demands suggested that members of the medical profession who have a vested interest in preserving the prevalence of births in hospitals are behind this case. The subpoena was filed under the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act because that act contains a section which states vaguely that under its jurisdiction the Attorney General can demand any information he wants from anyone.

When ACHI refused to turn over the items, Illinois took us to court for alleged consumer fraud. Several extremely important issues are pending: 1) A lay group's right to teach medical data to the public; 2) A childbirth education organization's right to train and certify its own teachers; 3) The right of ACHI to protect its membership list and professional referral list; 4) The right of ACHI's parents to privacy. ACHI has won every round and still the Attorney General's office has persisted in the harassment. In fact, Susan DeWitt, Chief of the Department of Consumer Affairs Attorney General's office stated to the press that she could not understand why charges had been brought against ACHI in the first place because there were no consumer complaints against ACHI and we had broken no laws. Shortly after Ms. DeWitt's statement to the press, a gag order was placed on the Attorney General's staff and ACHI was taken back to court.

1) A lay person cannot even get into, much less use, a medical library without medical credentials;

2) Medical information is released to the press from physicians and researchers in the form of press releases, not medical studies;

3) The flow of information to the public is edited by the medical establishment before the press gets it.

Therefore the medical establishment completely controls the flow of medical information and research to the public. The shining exception is childbirth which is in most cases controlled by individual consumer-oriented organizations who do not have a vested interest in the justification of protection of American obstetrical practices.

ACHI has never been afraid to proclaim that we do independent research tied neither to the medical profession or drug companies. And ACHI does teach medical information to the public. ACHI has found time and again parents are not too stupid to understand highly technical medical language once they know the language.

Only ACOG affiliated childbirth educators would assure that parents knew only what the doctors wanted them to know; i.e. drugs are safe, hospital procedures are safe, doctors know best, etc. And that is frightening indeed. The sobering fact is that the government and medical establishment don't have to beat you to win. They have unlimited funds, and we have to struggle for every penny. Preventative programs are never popular with the medical establishment and the economic structure that supports it.

ACHI must win this case or clearly a legal precedent which could jeopardize every other childbirth education organization's right to teach parents classes independent of the medical establishment. This would, of course, seriously limit parents' right to knowledge of obstetrical alternatives and jeopardize maternity care by the consumer in favor of a vested group.

Obstetrics and Gynecologists (NACOG) has announced plans to train and certify its own childbirth educators. If that doesn't seem alarming to you, consider this:

1) Medical books in general are not carried by public libraries or general bookstores, so medical information is hard to obtain by the public.

PROTECT PARENTS' RIGHT TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT OBSTETRICAL PROCEDURES, TO HAVE CHOICES, TO CONTROL THEIR BIRTHS. TAX DEDUCTIBLE DONATIONS ARE URGENTLY NEEDED NOW TO WIN!

They Say Stick It/ We Say Sponge It

The headline read FDA WARNS WOMEN TO STOP USING RELY BRAND TAMPONS, Thurs. 25, 1980. Sales were suspended because of their close association with the sometimes fatal disease, Toxic Shock Syndrome. TSS is caused by a bacterial infection with Staphylococcus aureus, not by the tampons themselves. However, the disease begins as an organism in the vagina and builds up around or inside the tampon. The organism multiplies and produces a toxin that enters the bloodstream causing shock - a rapid fall in blood pressure.

The symptoms of TSS are sudden onset of high fever, vomiting, diarrhea, a rapid drop in blood pressure often resulting in shock and a sunburn-like rash followed by skin-peeling. Consumers are returning boxes of Rely for a refund. Studies show a much closer correlation between the disease and use of Rely than of other tampons in general.

OB/GYNs advise that women who continue to use tampons should leave them inserted for no longer than three hours. Meanwhile, women are supposed to feel safe - as Toxic Shock Syndrome will statistically strike only three women in 100,000 of menstrual age. Since January 299 cases of TSS have been reported to the Center for Disease Control, with 95% occurring in women during their menstrual period. There have been 25 deaths since 1975, the majority occurring since January.

The recent recall of Rely brand tampons is not the first time a product has been made for the use of women in relation to contraception and control of menstruation that has turned out to be actually or potentially dangerous to the health of women. Asbestos, shown to cause lung cancer, is also used to make tampons. Some tampons are treated with heparin, a chemical used as an anti-clotting agent. Some women are allergic to the cardboard tampon insert. As if there weren't enough chemicals in their tampons they add deodorant so our crotches can be odor-free.

1976 GROSS PROFIT FOR TAMPAX, INC. WAS $82,656,250. OVER 55 BILLION TAMPAX TAMPONS HAVE BEEN USED BY WOMEN IN MORE THAN 100 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD DURING THE PAST 40 YEARS. MEN HAVE BEEN MAKING MONEY OFF OUR BLOOD FOR LONG ENOUGH!

Menstrual Sponges

During the past few years, the idea of women using natural sponges instead of tampons during menstruation has been spreading around the country. It's not a new idea - women have been using sponges throughout history until the advent of the sanitary tampon during the convenience era of the 50's. If more women know about using menstrual sponges and how to use them, they will use sponges to reclaim their blood cycles in much the same way that we have been reclaiming other parts of our lives. Using sponges instead of paper "sanitary supplies" is one more way of withdrawing support from the patriarchy and taking back control of our bodies.

WHY USE SPONGES?

Using sponges instead of tampons makes sense for so many reasons. Not only are sponges comfortable and free of chemicals and bleach (buy the brown ones, not the bright white or yellow ones that have been put through a strong bleaching process several times) they are also less expensive to use than disposable paper products. Instead of buying several boxes of tampons each month, women can now use one sponge that will last for months. You don't throw out the sponge when it becomes saturated with blood, you just rinse it out with water and reinsert it in your vagina.
