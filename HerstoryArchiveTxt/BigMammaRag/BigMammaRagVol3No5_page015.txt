Lesbian Task Force Projects

Among the many projects
under way, the Lesbian Task
Force of NOW has begun two
consciousness-raising
groups. One group is for

women who are just coming
out (or women who are
beginning to define them-
selves as Lesbians). This
group meets Thursday nights
at 7:30 p.m. at 1545 Vine #7.
The other group is for all
women of any sexual orienta-
tion and will explore what it
means to be a woman and to
be sexual. This group meets
on Monday nights at 7:30
p.m. at 1545 Vine #7. All
women are welcome to attend
either group.

Another activity sponsored
by the Lesbian Task Force is a
women’s coffeehouse, held
the 4th Friday of every month
at Denver Free University (17th
& Park) at 9:00 p.m. Upcoming
events at the coffeehouse
include bingo night, Tarot and
palm reading, feminist music,
poetry, dancing, refreshments,
and possibly complete, homestyle meals. Fem-
inist and Lesbian materials
are also on sale at the
coffeehouse, and all women
are welcome.

Because large amounts of
time and money are needed
for educational and informa-
tional materials in the massive
gay effort to introduce and
pass gay antidiscrimination
bills in the 1975 Colorado
State Legislature, the Lesbian
Task Force has several fund-
raising events coming up. We
are sponsoring a dance at the
Oxford Hotel Saturday De-
cember 7th from 9 p.m. to 2
a.m. (band to be announced).
Also, we are raffling a 12”
portable TV for $1.00 donation
per ticket. Ticket donations
may be made to any Lesbian
Task Force member, at the
NOW office, and at Gay
Coalition. The drawing will be
held at 8:00 p.m. at the NOW
general meeting December
16th at Park Hill Congrega-
tional Church (26th & Leyden).
Your support of these events
will help ensure the dignity of
equal rights for gays in
Colorado.

Lesbian Task Force meet-
ings are held the 2nd and 4th
Wednesdays of every month
at 1538 Adams at 7:30 p.m.
All women are invited to
attend and participate. For
further information, call

DES-Morning After Pill
PP, HEW Use Women

NEW HAVEN, Conn. (LNS)
--The Planned Parenthood
League of Connecticut in
conjunction with the Yale
Medical School has conduct-
ed experiments on 600 women
from across the state, to test
the “morning-after pill.” The
money used for the experi-
ment comes from a $132,000
grant from the Department of
Health, Education, and Wel-
fare.

Known to cause cancer in
laboratory animals and in the
children of women who have
taken it, the drug - diethylstil-
bestrol (DES) - contains a
massive dose of synthetic
estrogen, equivalent to a
four-year supply of birth
control pills.

Women in the experiment
are given a series of ten pills
containing 250 milligrams of
DES, which are taken during a
five-day period 24 to 72 hours
following intercourse.

DES has long been opposed
by women’s groups, health
and consumer organizations.
Evidence shows that it caused
cancer of the vagina and
cervix in at least 200 daugh-
ters whose mothers took it
during pregnancy to prevent
miscarriages. Twenty-four of
the young women are known
to have died as of July 1974.

The drug also causes
serious side effects in the
women who take the pills.
Besides the usual nausea,
vomiting, sweating and va-
ginal bleeding, a woman may
experience other side effects
linked to estrogens. Blood
clots, hypertension, migraine,
development of breast cysts,
loss of hair, hyperthyroid
conditions, diabetic reac-
tions, changes in eye pres-
sure, depression, and person-
ality changes have been
reported.

Even after DES was banned
from cattle feed in 1972 (the
ban was overturned in Jan-
uary 1974 on a technicality) it
was approved for “emergency
use” as a morning-after
contraceptive drug. The Food
and Drug Administration
(FDA) recommends its use

only in extreme emergency
cases, such as rape, warning
that “it shouldn’t be consid-
ered as a method for birth
control with continuous and
frequently repeated therapy.”

However, testimony before
the Senate Subcommittee on
Health in 1973 reveals that the
unauthorized use of DES as a
contraceptive is widespread.
While doctors are supposed to
prescribe the drug only for
“emergency use,” there are no
limits on the doctors’ judge-
ment of exactly what consti-
tutes an emergency.

In addition, DES is ap-
proved for use in treating
diseases, including endome-
triosis - an abnormality of
the uterus - and, ironically,
cancer in the lining of the
uterus.

Eli Lilly of Indianapolis - the
largest single marketer of DES
for human use - correctly
predicted, after the FDA
ruling on emergency use:
“We don't expect this will

Self Exam

for Breast Cancer

1. Sit or stand in front of your mirror, arms re-
laxed at your sides and look for any
changes in size, shape, contour. Also look
for puckering or dimpling of the skin and
changes in the surface of the nipples. Gently
press each nipple to see if any discharge
occurs.

2. Raise both arms over your head and look
for exactly the same things. Note differ-
ences since you last examined your breasts.

3. From there on you will be trying to find a
lump or thickening. Lie down on your bed,
put a pillow or bath towel under your left
shoulder and your left hand under your
head. With the fingers of your right hand
held flat, press gently against the breast
with small circular motions to feel the in-
ner, upper portion of your left breast,
starting at your breastbone and going out-
ward toward the nipple line. Also feel the
area around the nipple.

5. Use the same gentle pressure to feel the
upper, outer portion of your left breast from
the nipple line to where your arm is resting.

6. Now bring your left arm down to your side.
Still using the flat part of the fingers of your
right hand, feel under your left armpit.

7. Repeat the entire procedure, as described,
on the right breast using the left hand for
the examination.

8. And finally, feel the lower outer portion of
your breast, going from the outer part to
the nipple.

If you find a lump or thickening, leave it
alone until you see your doctor. Don't be
frightened. Most breast lumps or changes
are not cancer, but only a doctor can tell.
