Letters Home to Mama

9/6/74  
Dear Big Mama:

I am writing to protest the  
outrageous management of  
the 1st Annual Women’s  
Festival at East High August  
25th. Many active women took  
time and energies from other  
pressing duties to see that  
this event was successful,  
especially in terms of funds  
being raised to make a  
women’s center a reality in  
Denver. These same women  
are pretty disappointed to find  
that this effort failed, largely  
through the irresponsible be-  
havior of a few.

First of all, commitments  
were made to individuals and  
groups without the knowledge  
or approval of the festival  
committee. Such as: (1) It had  
been clearly understood prior  
to the festival that all  
concessions would be operated  
solely by the festival  
committee, but two concession  
booths were admitted against  
any knowledge of the  
majority of women. This was a  
tragic blunder, as these  
booths competed directly with  
the main concessions stand  
whose intake after expenses  
went 100% to the Women’s  

Center Coalition. (2) Public  
statements were made to the  
effect that any group which  
had a booth at the festival  
would automatically become  
members of the Women’s  
Center Coalition. These  
statements were made irre-  
sponsibly in that they did not  
have the approval of the  
festival committee, and in  
fact, most members opposed  
such an idea as it did not  
allow each group to even  
CHOOSE whether they wanted  
to be part of the Coalition!  
These and other statements of  
a similar nature went a long  
way to undermine the good  
faith of the women who  
participated. (3) The admit-  
tance of such groups as  
Together Books, RIP Book-  
store, and even the “surprise”  
concessions, which under no  
circumstances could be called  
“women's organizations”,  
made it totally impractical if  
not impossible for REAL  
women's organizations to sell  
books and other materials at  
their booths and thereby  
possibly raise funds for  
themselves and for the festival  
(i.e., Women's Center).

In the planning of this  
festival, there has been a  

consistent disregard (by the  
“leadership”) for our clearly  
articulated demands for total  
accountability of everyone  
involved in the decision-mak-  
ing process. Decisions were  
consistently made by the few  
without the knowledge or  
approval of the many.  
Attempts at organization  
and communication were re-  
peatedly made by BMR, the  
Lesbian Task Force of  
N.O.W., and some other  
individuals, in the hopes of  
preventing the types of idiocy  
mentioned above. That these  
attempts only partially suc-  
ceeded is a damning fact.  
However, I am less con-  
cerned about who did what,  
than I am with the process of  
this festival. That it even came  
off at all is a thing to be proud  
of, and I do not intend to  
minimize ANYONE’S part.  
What I object to so much is  
the lack of trust between us,  
which dictates that when one  
woman makes a mistake, she  
feels afraid to admit it openly  
and share that learning  
process with others. She  
starts dealing with other  
women in the ways that she  
deals with men, excusing  

Features

Much was also made of Ms.  
Waters' statement that she  

WORKS with men because  
they expect that from women.  
But BETWEEN women it is  
dishonest and dangerous.  
Any woman who needs to fall  
back on old patterns and  
processes is denying herself  
the most important experi-  
ences she may ever have --  
sharing and learning on a gut  
level with other women,  
helping and BEING helped.  
So: to the extent that we were  
not using female processes,  
we were managing the  
festival.

This is an oppressive thing  
that we do to ourselves and to  
each other all the time. WE  
ALL HAVE TO BE MORE  
OPEN TO CRITICISM FROM  
EACH OTHER SO THAT WE  
CAN HELP EACH OTHER  
GROW, EVEN IF THAT  
GROWTH IS PAINFUL BE-  
CAUSE OF OUR MISTAKES. I  
am more willing to learn if I  
know there is love, and that is  
what we have to start trusting  
if we are to build a strong and  
vital women’s community in  
Denver. The lessons from this  
festival have been hard; we  
cannot afford to ignore them.  
We all have to do some  
serious thinking about unifi-  
cation and goals in the  
coming months; in the  
process, let’s not repeat  
ourselves. In the process, let’s  
see that our learning is open,  
so that we can all share.

In love and struggle,  
Shecat

To The Denver Post:

This letter is being written  
in objection to your article on  
Big Mama Rag on page 3 of  
Sunday, September 8, 1974,  
Denver Post. The article was  
obviously biased, prejudiced  
and sexist in content, reflect-  
ing Mr. Goldman's personal  
fears. I hardly considered the  
article as objective reporting,  
and was surprised and dis-  
mayed that the Denver Post  
would even print it.

Mr. Goldman seemed to  
feel that since BMR was by  
women for women that it was  
“out to get” men. I have a  
close male friend who reads  
every issue which comes out.  
He does not feel that the  
paper is “out to get” him and  
even finds it enlightening.  
Besides, there are several  
dozens of exclusively men's  
magazines on the newsstands  
today, men are highly involved  
in many of the more tradition-  
al women’s magazines, and  
for hundreds of years men  
controlled who could read and  
write. So why is Mr. Goldman  
so fearful of one struggling  
women's newspaper?

He was “indifferent” to men as if  
her indifference was both  
criminal and reflective of the  
attitude of BMR. Man's  
history shows he has been  
“indifferent” to women for  
thousands of years if not  
unjust, cruel, hateful and  
inhuman. And if BMR, or its  

staff, are “out to get” men,  
how can they also be  
“indifferent”? It seems incon-  
sistency is a male trait, too.

Last spring, a friend of mine  
became involved with BMR on  
a volunteer basis and then  
became one of the paid staff  
members, so I have been  
informed of the basic changes  
and objectives of BMR. Big  
Mama Rag was originally  
structured in a traditional  
manner and eventually many  
of the women involved felt a  
need for restructuring along  
less traditional lines. Through  
a desire to represent all  

women, the many women  
involved with BMR cooperated  
in love and understanding to  
create the present structure.  
My friend is now a Coordina-  
tor, which precisely describes  
her activities and all women  
who wish to, may help decide  
which articles are printed in  
BMR. The paper is not  
controlled by a minority few  
as Mr. Goldman stated.

Finally, Mr. Goldman re-  
sorted to Lesbian baiting by  
reporting that BMR was  
controlled by Lesbians  
preaching separatism. Over  
the past several months, I  
have met and known many of  
these women and I find them  
intelligent, creative and with a  
high, positive energy level.  
When I am with them, I  
experience a warm love that  
accepts me and all those  
around them for who we are.  
Never during my acquaintance  
with these women have any of  
them approached me and  
preached separatism.

Since one of the more basic  
endeavors of the Women’s  
Movement is for women to  
define herself, it is my belief  
that Lesbian women may be  
best able to do this. The  
Lesbian woman is totally  
involved with and dedicated to  
women and is woman defining  
woman.

No, I am not a Lesbian, but I  
am a budding Feminist who  
cares about and loves my  
sisters. When Mr. Goldman  
attempted to discredit Big  
Mama Rag and those con-  
nected with it, he also  
attempted to discredit all  
women. This has gone on far  
too long and men had best  
realize it before he destroys  
himself.

Sincerely yours,  
Barbara A. Main
