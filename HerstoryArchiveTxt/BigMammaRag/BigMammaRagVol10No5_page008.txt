Who Is The Criminal?

Marianne Stewart

Crime is an action or omis-
sion which someone says is
"wrong," "incorrect," "improp-
er," etc. Crime is what people
in power want it to be--legis-
latures, bureaucracies, local

men in America make 59¢ (or
less) for every dollar a man
makes; that child-support laws
are not enforced; and that
when rapes and murders of wo-
men occur repeatedly, women
are told to stay inside after
dark--rather than having a

criminal injustice system

organizations, et al. Most im-
portantly, crime has to do not
with behavior, but with the
definition of where behavior
is appropriate.

Crime is the violation of
any of a set of legal limita-
tions--perhaps a million mak-
ing up the set (when we take
into consideration local,
state and federal criminal
and often civil laws, rules
and regulations--to say noth-
ing of international laws.)

Criminal law is closely re-
lated to the ideology of the
political system one lives
under. Burning your house is
not against the law (provided
you live in an out of the way
place, have notified the fire
department, will not try to
collect insurance, etc.) under
a capitalistic form of gover-
nment. Burning your house is
against the law (because not
enough people have houses) un-
der bona fide communism.

It is still nearly impossi-
ble to define "Criminal" be-
cause we all commit crimes.
Those who have never been
caught speeding, running traf-
fic lights, driving while in-
toxicated, picking up a ring
someone left behind, ignor-
ing honest debts, having some-
one else take a medical exam
for them, taking office sup-
plies or shoplifting from a
store--all these people are
technically "criminals;" so
are those who have been detec-
ted. Next, we have to deter-
mine when these "criminals"
have "reformed."

Also, we must take into ac-
count crimes against humanity
(often with a racial, class
and sex bias); these "crimi-
nals" would be, for example:
Boards of Supervisors and ci-
ty council-persons who refuse
to construct low-income hous-
ing (even though there is a
great need and money is avail-
able); the Reagan administra-
tion sending Haitian refugees
to a concentration camp in up-
state New York in the dead of
winter; and the fact that wo-

curfew for men. It would seem
that a woman who must work the
graveyard shift because she
is the sole support of her
children, doesn't have much
more of a chance than the Hai-
tian refugees--especially if
she has to travel quite far
by bus because there is no ad-
equate housing available near
her place of employment.
Included, moreover, in cri-
mes against humanity are: 1)
that Black children in parts
of Mississippi, Texas, etc.,
have hardly enough welfare to
keep them alive (and just e-
nough so that malnutrition,
physical and mental retarda-
tion, and disease will take
their toll);

2) that Native

by

Americans live in the most
dire poverty in their own land
and the perpetrator of this
crime, the U.S. government,
has decided to "help" them by
sending them down into uran-
ium mines; and 3) that the
U.S. government conducts such
experiments in chemical war-
fare as giving LSD to unin-
formed Americans in the arm-
ed services, scattering chem-
icals and bacteria over San
Francisco Bay and in New York
subways "to see how far they
'11 go;" and using prisoners,
both male and female, for
drug experiments--without
their consent or knowledge.
And not long ago, the Space

Agency added itself to the
pinnacle of immoral crimes by
using children in a radiation
experiment--without the know-
ledge or consent of the par-
ents.

Another example of crimes
of a racist, classist and sex-
ist nature is slumlandlording
and all it implies: the graft
of city officials and judges,
the millions to be made, and
the gambling with human life
--as when the heat is not
working in winter, or when
rodents attack babies because
the exterminators only show-
ed up "on paper."

Because prostitution is le-
gal in most of Nevada, women
on welfare are sometimes urg-
ed to become prostitutes by
their "welfare" workers. Be-
cause prostitution is legal
in Nevada, does this make it
right? Because it is illegal
in most other places does
this make it wrong? The only
"Crime" would seem to be the
urging, by an agent of the
government (through the use
of brow-beating, intimidation,
guilt, coercion, etc.) of wo-

men caught up in poverty and
hopelessness, to abandon any
feelings of self-worth and
self-respect--and to jeopar-
dize their very lives and
those of their children.

America's plutocratic gov-
ernment ignores all these
things, and defines "crime" as
homicide, assault, burglary,
grand theft, arson, robbery,
etc. These are mainly crimes
against property or capitalist-
major-interest crimes.
Moreover, in the U.S., the
"individualistic ethic" means
everyone takes care of them-
selves; blind men can walk off
cliffs and no one has to stop
them. (With few exceptions.)

Who Pays?

What all this means is that
the relationship between law
and morality is dubious. And
if one is following the laws
of the land, it could very
well be that one is acting
immorally; just as it may be
of a higher morality to "break"
(ignore) unjust laws. (There
is, actually, no such thing as
a "broken" law; laws stand
stronger than steel--it is the
poor who will be broken under
them.) In other countries, one
has an obligation to one's
countrymen/women. But not in
our "civilized" nation where
America's Legal Ethics are "You
don't interfere...unless you
can make something on this
deal."

I would like to say something
here about definitions, and
the linguistic traps we are
often caught in. The next time
you hear a word which angers
or intimidates you (or seems
to invalidate your political
beliefs), go to the dictionary
and find the precise meaning
of that word. Do you fit? Does
the speaker who angered you
fit? Is this a definition the

-Val Vaughan/BMR
power structure/mass media en-
shroud us in (or enshrine
themselves in)?

We DO NOT have to accept oth-
ers' concepts of us. And
when we stop accepting them,
we will be MUCH STRONGER!

To speak of equality in the
law is to imagine that the
laws, at some point in histo-
ry, have been equal for every-
one. Anatole France said, "The
law, in its majestic equality,
forbids the rich as well as
the poor to beg in the streets,
to sleep under bridges, and to
steal bread." (A concise exam-
ple of how many affluent peo-
ple go to prison.) Speaking of
