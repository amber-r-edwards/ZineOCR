DIALECTIC OF SEX, by  
Shulamith Firestone  

Shulamith Firestone was born  
in Ottawa, Canada. She attended  
several universities in  
the U.S. and earned a Bachelor  
of Fine Arts in Painting.  

She is presently editor of  
"Notes," a journal of radical  
feminism.  

In Dialectic of Sex, Ms.  
Firestone presents a clear  
idea of the women's movement.  
She replaces the myths and  
fears surrounding feminism with  
reasoning and understanding.  
She brings an awareness of the  
way in which each of us is  
being destroyed by our society.  
Further, she explains how  
women and men can only  
develop half of themselves at  
the expense of the other half.  
The myth has always been that  
the two sexes complement each  
other's abilities and personality.  
But women and men are  
whole complete beings within  
themselves. So what part of  
our roles is a result of  
socializing and what part is  
biological? Or is any of it  
biological? Or is all of it  
socializing?  

The love-myth is destroyed  
in Ms. Firestone's explanation  
of the selfishness involved in  
a relationship...possessiveness,  
envy, jealousy, the obvious  
importance of physical beauty  
(make-up, clothes, hair.) The  
games we play; she bolstering  
his ego, he "protecting" and  
"defending" her, way up there  
on her pedestal; she being  
"delicate" and "feminine;" he  
being "strong" and a "real  
man."  

In relating feminism and  
Freud, Ms. Firestone points  
out Freud's greatest  
failing, that of questioning  
the individual, rather than  
society as a whole as the cause  
for so-called "maladjustment."  
Feminism and Freudianism  
arose at about the same period  
of time; but Freud was  
accepted as the "lesser of two  
evils," even though his  
theory is full of contradictions.  

Shulamith Firestone  
discusses and breaks down the  
entire theory of the family  
structure: father as breadwinner,  
mother as nursemaid  
and somewhat dependent upon  
the father, and "children,"  
hopelessly dependent upon  
mother and father.  

This book is recommended to  
anyone feeling and seeing the  
oppression of our society,  
whether woman, man, black,  
red, yellow, white.  

Next hearing date in ESTHER GOOD-  
YEAR vs. GATES RUBBER is March 28 at  
8:30 a.m. in Judge Finesilver's  

court on 2nd floor of courthouse at  
19th and Stout. Supportive women  
please attend.  

(CPS) At the end of 1972, suppor-  
ters of the Equal Rights Amendment  
(ERA) felt certain of imminent vic-  
tory. Now, three months later,  
massive anti-Equal Rights Amendment  
forces (Stop the ERA) have organized  
in an effort which puts easy and  
immediate ratification of the 26th  
Amendment in serious doubt.  

Early last year, Congress passed  
the Equal Rights Amendment, which  
would outlaw all forms of sex dis-  
crimination that are based on law  
or governmental action. It is nec-  
essary for 38 state legislatures to  
ratify the amendment. To date, 28  
states have ratified the ERA, 11  
have defeated it, leaving 11 states  
undecided. Ten of those 11 states  
must ratify the ERA for it to pass  
this year.  

Opponents of the Equal Rights  
Amendment make two main objections  
to its ratification. They claim  
that passage of the ERA would make  
women eligible for the draft, and  
that it would release men from their  
obligations to support a family.  

Jacqueline G. Gutwillig, chair-  
woman of the Citizen's Advisory  
Council on the Status of Women,  
labelled opponents' arguments irrele-  
vant. She commented that if a  
draft is reactivated, "It would  
only be in a serious national emer-  
gency that would undoubtedly expose  
women to dangers as great as combat--  
and most women would want to defend  
their country in such circumstances."  

As for the opponents' second ar-  
gument, releasing men from financial  
responsibility of their family,  
Gutwillig explained that a court  
never intervenes in a stable family  
situation. Therefore, families  
would continue to make individual  
and personal decisions affecting the  
their lives. In cases of separation  
or divorce, according to Gutwillig,  
the court would take into considera-  
tion the economic situations of both  
husband and wife before granting any  
financial settlements.  

As organized opposition grows  
stronger, supporters of the ERA ner-  
vously turn to a grassroots cam-  
paign in the remaining states in  
order to ensure a ratification, al-  
though undoubtedly a very narrow  
one, of the amendment which will fi-  

nally give women equal rights under  
law.  

Women in Colorado, which has al-  
ready ratified the ERA, who are in-  
terested in supporting its ratifica-  
tion in other states should send do-  
nations to: NOW Emergency Fund,  

P.O. Box 4514, Church Street Station,  
New York, New York 10249.  

Women’s Rights  

Colorado Cases  

JANET BONNEMA vs.  
STATE HIGHWAY DEPT.  

Charge: A job appointment  
was revoked when sex of appli-  
cant was learned, even though  
she was the most qualified appli-  
cant. State Court settlement  
reinstated her at job at  
Straight Creek Tunnel with back  
pay. Federal Court settlement  
awarded her attorney fees,  
$6750 cash settlement, and per-  
mission to do job-related  
duties formerly denied because  
of sex. Sandra Rothenberg was  
attorney for this case, con-  
sidered a landmark in the U.S.  
for breaking down ancient pre-  
judice against women in mines  
or tunnels.  

MARIANNE TAYLOR vs.  
MOUNTAIN ELECTRIC COMPANY  

Charge: Discharge and re-  
placement by a man, even though  
work was satisfactory. Ms.  
Taylor lost case, largely be-  
cause it was a fairly old case  
and witnesses were difficult to  
produce.  

PATTY HODGINS vs.  
BOULDER DAILY CAMERA  

Charges: Job discrimination  
on basis of sex, particularly  
in work assignment. Hearing  
Examiner did find that the  
Camera had committed sex dis-  
crimination, but not against  
Ms. Hodgins.  

MAUREEN TESLER vs.  
COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT 12  

Charges: Discharge due to  
pregnancy, and discrimination  
based on religious creed.  
Hearing Examiner found in her  
favor. Commissioners haven't  
rendered a decision.  

JUNE FIELD vs.  
MONTROSE SCHOOL BOARD  

Charges: Employment as busi-  
ness teacher denied because her  
husband was already employed by  
the district and because dis-  

trict wanted business teacher to  
be part-time coach. Case in  
progress.  

VALERY McALLISTER vs.  
DEPT. OF JUVENILE PAROLE  

Charge: Discharge on basis  
of sex. Discrimination in job  
assignment on basis of sex.  
State District Court found in  
her favor, but Parole has  
attempted to reverse decision.
