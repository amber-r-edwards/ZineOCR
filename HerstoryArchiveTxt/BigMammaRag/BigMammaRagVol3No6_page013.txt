“* *’Tis the season to feel Black Velvet.”

These enticing words blare from the latest Black Velvet billboard, the
third in a long-running series appearing around the Greater Denver
area. The first, visible last summer, invited one to “Come home to Black
Velvet.” The second, pictured above, speaks for itself. All three boards
feature similar blond lovelies and are in equally poor taste. These
billboards are in our town, ladies, so let Heublein, Inc., Menlo Park,
California, know what you think of them.

Advertising for the joyous Christmas holiday, buying season started
back before the frost was on the pumpkin. In a depressed economy and a
market flooded with look-alike goods, the competition for the Christmas
dollar is fierce. But while the ads have started earlier, they haven't
gotten any better. The same old cultural prejudices or trends can be
observed in many holiday season ads:

Women, in their classic subservient role, are directly encouraged to
purchase all manner of unnecessary products which will help them be
the perfect holiday hostess. How can you possibly hold your head up if
your turkey doesn't brown-in-the-bag at least as well as your next door
neighbor's?

Toys for children and teens of all ages are still touted along sex-typed
lines. Indeed, most products intended for adult gift giving are advertised
in this manner. For instance, advertising would have us believe that a
power saw is not an appropriate gift for a woman, a cookbook not ap-
propriate for a man. Not only are these companies perpetuating sexual
stereotypes, but they are, of course, limiting their own potential market.

You can observe these and many other cultural prejudices for
yourself as you shop along your merry way this year. The advertising
“Christmas Message” is clear. Are we listening?

As if Continental Airlines’ “We really move our tail for you.” cam-
paign wasn't bad enough, National Airlines (“Hi, I'm Cheryl. Fly me.”)
has just disclosed its newest ad theme. “I’m gonna fly you like you've
never been flown before.” is bound to stir up more controversy. It
should also stir up some thoughts about the actresses and/or models
who will participate in these ads. Wouldn't it be great if not one single
woman would agree to deliver those lines? Unrealistic? Perhaps. Im-
possible? No.

Challenged

Sherilyn Brandenstein

Several years ago, a Colorado
Springs woman who didn't have
any money for an abortion ex-
plained her problem to a woman
acquaintance, lamenting that
there was really nowhere for her
to turn for resources in this
situation. Her friend's response
was quick and unexpected. “I
have $600 in the bank. You take
as much of it as you need to go
get a legal abortion, then pay me
back when you can. I had my il-
legal abortion back east a couple
of years ago. It was done while I
laid on top of a Maytag washer,
and was one of the most
frightening experiences I’ve had
in my life. More than once I have
driven other women to New York
to get legal abortions. I will be
glad to loan money for a legal
abortion. No woman should
have to go through what I did.”

Even when a woman

lives in an area where
no legal barriers keep
her from receiving an
abortion, she may en-
counter doctors or

hospitals that have

regulations to inhibit or
totally prevent
attempts to have the
procedure performed.

For most women who are in-
formed, the above incident
represents a reminder of the
past, but not a present reality. In
January 1973 the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled that states could no
longer have laws forbidding
abortion, and stated that a
woman’s decision to obtain an
abortion would be completely
between herself and her doctor
up to the third trimester of her
pregnancy. The Court indicated
that laws which infringe on the
right to abortion are un-
constitutional because they
hinder a woman's right to decide
when and if she will bear a child.
This ruling came as a welcome
surprise to numerous women
across the country. In Colorado
and other states, doctors and
clinics responded within the
year by making the suction abor-
tion (the most common method
in the early stages of pregnancy)
available with minimal trauma
and moderate cost.

States Defy Ruling

Despite such a change, it is
still difficult for women to
obtain abortions when they need
them. Some states decided to ig-
nore the Supreme Court ruling,
so they continued to illegally en-
force existing laws or created
new laws severely restricting
abortion. Women are taking
court action to challenge such
laws in several states. Even
when a woman lives in an area
where no legal barriers keep her
from receiving an abortion, she
may encounter doctors or
hospitals that have regulations
to inhibit or totally prevent
attempts to have the procedure
performed. Finally, many per-
sons have never been informed
that abortion is legal or that it is
available nearby. This applies to
urban as well as rural areas.

When the 1973 Supreme
Court decision was announced,
those opposed to it immediately
began to initiate legislation to
counteract the Court decision.

Led by the Right to Life organiza-
tion, anti-abortion proponents
(they refer to their position as
“pro-life”) instigated a variety of
legislative maneuvers to limit or
prohibit the performance of
abortions in the United States.
These efforts have continued to
the present. The intent of this ar-
ticle is to summarize the most
recent developments on the
Congressional front concerning
abortion.
Constitutional Amendment

In both houses of Congress,

a politician’s con-
cern for the environ-
ment almost always in-
dicates a strong pro-
abortion stance.

there is a total of 87 bills in

process relating to abortion.
Some, such as the bill to
regulate research on human

fetuses, cover a rather narrow
scope. Several other bills or
amendments could have a
significant impact on the status
of abortion. Senator Buckley of
New York has sponsored a
resolution for a constitutional
amendment that would prohibit
abortion except to save the
mother’s life or for some other
medical emergency. In the
House of Representatives, Con-
gressman Helms proposed a
constitutional amendment that
would outlaw abortion for any
reason. At this writing, both
resolutions are in the Con-
stitutional Amendment Sub-
committee of the Judiciary Com-
mittee in the Senate. The sub-
committee has the task of con-
solidating the two into one joint
resolution. Each month since
March it has held hearings to
allow testimony from anyone
concerned about the issue, and

the final hearing is expected in

tion . . . while I laid on

through what I did.

Big Mama Rag Vol. 3, No. 6

Court Decision
on Abortion

December. The work on this
legislation is proceeding at such
a slow pace that it is not ex-
pected to pass before the end of
this session. However, there is
no question that the same
legislation will be introduced
anew when the 1975 Congress
convenes.

The National Right to Life
Committee has recently drawn
up a resolution of its own for a
constitutional amendment that
would redefine the meaning of
the word “person” in the Con-
stitution to include “unborn
offspring,” and would guarantee
life for the unborn. They have not
announced what legislator plans
to sponsor this resolution.

HEW Abortion Amendment

As 1974 comes to an end, a
large appropriations bill for the
Health, Education and Welfare
Department (H.R. 15580) awaits
a final vote. First introduced in
the House, the bill made no men-
tion of abortion (this omission
can be credited primarily to the
work of Rep. Bella Abzug of New
York). But while the bill was in
the Senate, Amendment 86 was
added to it. That amendment

stated that no funds in the bill
could be used to perform or to
encourage performance of abor-
tion, except to save the life of the
mother. It could have stopped
public hospitals from using
federal money to perform abor-
tions on low-income women,
prohibited Medicaid recipients
from using Medicaid for their
abortions, and prevented
medical schools from using
HEW funds to teach abortion
techniques. Significantly, HEW
director Casper Weinberger
released a statement this year
saying that he would be “op-
posed to any congressional ef-
forts to prohibit the use of tax
dollars under federal programs
to pay for abortions.” He also in-
dicated that any national health
