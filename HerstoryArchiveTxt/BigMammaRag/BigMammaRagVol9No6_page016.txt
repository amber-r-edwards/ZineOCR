Psychiatric Violence from page 2

The psychiatric system "be nice". We
will never succeed in this
goal, neither will we make
the government (capitalism)
be nice, or the police be
nice."

You also state in the
demands of a radical femi-
nist psychiatric movement
(I would eliminate the word
psychiatric - why use their
words?) must include...
an end to the control of al-
ternative programs by profes-
sionals, or rather consumer
controlled alternatives. Does
this not say that not only
can't the system "be nice"
just because feminist shrinks
are a part of the army,
along with the idea of con-
sumers helping each other
out. So where in this model do
professional feminist therap-

ists fit in? I get the idea
from your two closing para-
graphs that they fit in some-
place. Those two paragraphs
are a little unclear to me. I
get the feeling you would like
to see struggles unite, women
unite (by the way, socialist
countries also use forced
treatment, drugs, and invol-
untary commitment) for change.
(I once held hope for this
also.) There is another ques-
tion here. Feminist therapy

is a business, a way to sur-
vive in a money economy. Not
only are clients using this
institution to help them sur-
vive but the therapists them-
selves need the bread. Also
in consumer controlled alter-
natives I've found big prob-
lems over issues of power and
control. Like "we had seized

Lesbian Chauvinism Exposed

Dear Kim,

I just received my April
1981 BMR with your article
"Nothing to Lose: But Our Illu-
sions: The Politics of Femin-
Bisexuality", and though I
have never been (and probably
will never be) either hetero-
sexual or bisexual, I agree
very much with your article. I
think it's past time the "les-
bian community” and lesbian
chauvinism be exposed for the
rottenness they are. While I
am glad you are saying what
you're saying, I'm also sad--
because I haven't written it
clearly for all to see. I have
had no sexual relationship for
6 years, and not by choice.
It's mostly because the lesbian
community is a horror show, I
cannot and will not enter it,
and I have been driven into
voluntary exile. Part of this
may be my introverted person-

ality, but most of it is poli-

tical--nobody wants their fem-
inist. When I challenge les-
bians on their lesbian chau-
vinism, etc., and urge people
to look at the sexism, high
school atmosphere, and des-
tructiveness (for some reason
bringing up racism and "clas-
sism" is OK, but not sexism
--not that racism and class
differences and bourgeois
hegemony aren't problems),
lesbians don't want to hear
it, or anything negative
about the precious ghetto--
and that's all it is! As an
aside, I do not share your
view of the “richness” of
Matriarchal, separatist cul-
ture, unless shit can be
considered rich.

Repression is so severe
among lesbians that speak-
ing up about it in meetings
(which I did only yesterday,
probably not well--I wish I'd
known about your article then)
is one of the scarier and more
painful things I've done--but
it's easier being an outsider:
I occasionally run into les-
bians who agree but don't
dare open their mouths in pu-
blic. It, like most things
closest to our lives and
hearts, has become something
we murmur about behind our
hands only to trusted friends
or people we know will agree.
The notion that the lesbian

community at least supports

lesbians is a fearful lie.
Those of us who don't fit in
are ignored, trashed, treated
with virulent contempt. (And
I can't be the only one!)

I know there are other rea-
sons for this lesbian chauvi-
nism against heterosexual
and bisexual women besides
what you've mentioned: 1) It's
a misdirected attack against
heterosexual society, which is
contemptible and hates us be-
sides (but hates us more as
feminists, I think). 2) Les-
bians are afraid to write or
say anything negative about
anything with a "lesbian" la-
bel because we fear it may
pass into the wrong hands and
be used against us. I under-
stand this fear very well--I
used to work with, though I
was never a member of, Red-
stockings (post-1973 variety).
But stifling criticism or
necessary attack instead has
just about killed women's lib-

eration and will destroy any
chance for our freedom.

3) Dyke separatist or lesbian
feminist rhetoric that baits
heterosexual women invariably
harks back to an atmosphere
of heterosexual chauvinism in
the WLM which was rampant in
the early 1970s, but, except
for outposts like some of the
women's movement's Names in
New York (including Redstock-
ings), no longer exists among
the WLM's rank and file (out-
side of occasional incidents).
It doesn't exist because of
the fight we put up earlier
on. 4) Many heterosexual wo-
men do fink out: leave the
movement for their boyfriends
(and cut you dead), go the
Ms. route, join the "women's
movement" and sell out. What
somehow doesn't get mentioned
is that lesbians do, too--but,
differently. They occasionally go
the Ms. route, more often
abandon the movement for their
lovers or the lesbian social
scene or the women's communi-
ty, but their biggest fink
out is lesbian chauvinism!
And both heterosexual and
lesbian women let men off the
hook (in their analyses as
well as in their personal po-
litics) by giving them the
benefit of the doubt or by
ignoring their existence ex-

cept for perhaps a rhetorical
flourish now and then.

In a way, it's good that
the lesbian community is so
bad--otherwise some of us,
very definitely including
yours truly, wouldn't have
managed to tear ourselves
from lesbian chauvinism very
easily if we hadn't been
kicked in the teeth. One me-
thod which may help us divest
ourselves of lesbian chauvi-
nism is to stop confusing
lesbianism with feminism, in-
cluding differentiating our
responses as lesbians (i.e.
distrust for bisexuality)
from our responses as femin-
ists.

What your article brought
up is very important; we must
have a real critique of les-
bian culture, and attack many
aspects of it, and thoroughly
discuss not only the real
differences and problems
among lesbian, heterosexual
and bisexual women, but our
real similarities, which will
be the basis for feminism.

Enough of this rambling. I
began by wanting to express
my support! You will proba-
bly be attacked, so keep

your courage up.

PS.

Just one more thought
here - maybe more the word
"therapy" leans on the med-
ical model as does the word
“psychiatry”.

The word "anti-psychiatry"
is a term coined by profes-
sionals (let us not forget
there are feminist psychia-
trists) "anti" connotates
negative or against - though
I'm against the institution
of psychiatry I don't care
for the term. It's like
calling feminists “anti-
patriarchs" (using their
name to say you're against
them) also I'd like a more
positive name. I feel

“stuck” with "mental patients
liberation movement” which
bothers me on several counts.

1. I don't like the word
patient (again the medical
model trip).

2. It's a bigger move-
ment than just psychiatric
inmates (current & former).

3. People who haven't
been incarcerated might
think by the name it has
nothing to do with them.

4. What I do think is
the positive "liberation"
is more inviting than “anti”.

Also, I see no possible
alliance with the feminist
therapists and myself
(though not everyone in the
ex-inmates movement feels
the same). I don't want
them except as perhaps
students. The goddess of

Madness in the women's
community (Chesler) said
in a recent interview, "I
can only be an ally of peo-
ple who have been in mental
hospitals; I cannot lead
them. They can ask me to
align myself, or use my cre-
dentials or my body to pro-
tect something they've de-
cided they want. But I
don't think I'm needed any-
more--nor was I ever--to
give them a sense of great
outrage or distrust."
