We Asked Them To Call Us Crafts Women

Kady

One of us is dead. She was a
leather woman. I met her at the
Indiana festival last year. I
think her name was Charlotte.

Michigan

A West Virginia banjo player
woman named Karen told me the
other day in Indiana that
Charlotte was in a head-on col-
lision on Halloween and she is
dead. Karen wrote a song about
her and sang it to us crafts-
women. We cried.

My little red digital clock
that a friend stole for me --
my little red digital clock
made by women working in a fac-
tory for 17¢ an hour and living
20 in a room in a company-owned
dormitory and going blind at
23 to be replaced by younger
women who can see -- my little
red digital clock tells me it
is 11:26. So it's Tues-
day, I think. Last Thursday, I
got into my 300 dollar car and
put my foot down. It was 4
o'clock in the morning. I took
42 South to Port Jervis, 209
to Stroudsburg, 80 to Youngs-
town, 76 to Akron, 71 to Colum-
bus, 70 to Indianapolis, 465
to Route 37, 37 to Bloomington,
Indiana. Sunday afternoon, I
did it again, backwards. I
drove 1670 miles, alone. I
just woke up and walked through
my garden. Raccoon has eaten
the cucumber plants.

Now that we are in the year
9983 -- now that it is 9 thou-
sand 9 hundred and 83 years
since the invention of agricul-
ture by women/womyn/wimmin, we
wimmin will soon be celebrating
a 10 thousand year anniversary.
I hope it will also be a cele-
bration of the overthrow of
patriarchy.

I was sitting on a table in
Indiana, guarding some stuff
for a calligrapher who was mak-
ing some signs for us because
the festival women had put us
craftswomen around a corner
and out of sight, as usual.

How tired of that I am! Phila-
delphia national NOW conferen-
ce was great. We were in the
lobby and all the women walked
through us to get to the
speeches, and we could hear
the speeches through the wall.
But that was years ago and
since then it's been all down
hill. Washington national NOW
put us out of sight in the
basement of the Hilton Hotel.

National Women's Studies at
Storrs put us out of sight in
an ROTC hangar. Michigan, last
year, put us at least one mile,
maybe two miles down a dusty
road. When I saw that I knew

I would never live through the
winter. There was no way I
would make enough to buy 4
cords of firewood. And then to
my great joy and astonishment
the craftswomen stood up to-
gether and lifted up those gi-
ant tents and carried them
down that dusty road to the
place where the other women
were. How tired we were! How
tired I am! I have grown so
used to being hidden out of
sight that I was filled with
joy and astonishment when New
York State Women's Studies

said: "Kady, you can have a
scholarship because you are

poor. You can sell in the
evening at the big event. You
can sell any time, any place
you want. You can sleep at my
house." I went to every work-
shop!

So I was sitting on a table
in Indiana, guarding some
stuff for a calligrapher who
was making some signs for us
when a woman smiled at me and
I said, “What's your name?"
She said, "Cristy."

I said, "Not Cristy Vogel of
the Michigan festival?"

She said, "Yes. Will you be
coming this year?"

I said, "I have promised my
self I will never go again."

I told her what it's like to
be a craftswoman at Michigan.
I told her everything I have
ever thought about her and her
festival.

Finally, she said, “Now you
listen to me! You don't know
me!"

I said, “But I know Michi-
gan! I have seen that military
chain of command. I have seen
that pyramid of power with you
at the top and me at the bot-
tom. I didn't get any food,
but I have seen the food on
the table behind the stage. I
am ashamed of you."

At Michigan, last year she/
they punished us for moving
our tents. They took our park-
ing. I had hoped to sleep in my
car because I don't have a
tent. The year before I slept
on the ground in the “Merchants
Tent." (They gave me the place
where the tent leaked.) But
last year, she/they made a
mistake and assigned two of us
to the same space in the tent.
The other woman wanted to be

near her friend. So I went out—
side. I had no place to sleep.
I couldn't possibly walk to my

car. It was too far. I was too
tired. I am 56 years old and
frail. (I have not regained

the weight and strength I lost
in prison after the Wimmins
Pentagon Action.) I had just
driven 875 miles, gone to a

-Cate Gilles/BMR

meeting, moved the crafts vil-
lage, set up, sold 12 hours
and there was nothing to eat
and no place to sleep. That's
what it is like to be a crafts-
woman at Michigan.

Seven years ago we asked
them to call us crafts women
because we make the stuff we
sell. But they just went on
forcing us to buy a "Merch-
ants Permit." They did that
for 7 years.

Then I said, "Cristy, I have
changed not only the content
but also the form of litera-
ture, so I am a writer. Over
the years I have given you one
thousand dollars. And once I
came 10 days early and dug
trenches around the tents."
That year, every evening the
festival women told us: "Don't
think we are going to feed you
if you just work 4 hours a
day." So we worked 12 hours a
day, and we finished 3 days
early, and she/they closed the

worker's kitchen. They put a
rope around the food with a
sign on it. The sign said:
"COORDINATORS ONLY." I said,
"We are hungry and there is
nothing to eat." She/they
said, “Well, you can come in,
Kady." I said, “But what a-
bout all the other women out
here?" The woman said, "I
don't see anybody." Together
we managed to make a bucket of
soup. A woman said, "That's a
lead paint can!" and she dump-
ed the soup on the ground.
What do I want? I want every-
thing. I want food and a soft
safe dry warm place to sleep.
I want to go to every work-
shop. I want to hear the music.
I want to hear anti-patriar-
chal revolutionary music. I
want to celebrate the end of
patriarchy -- the end of rape
-- the end of oppression, dom-
ination, mutilation, killing.
I was really distressed to
hear Barbara Grier say, in OFF
OUR BACKS, that Naiad Press
no longer uses Iowa City Wom-
en's Press -- that Naiad Press
has switched to a cheaper man's
press. A couple of years ago,
Barbara Grier told me proudly:
"All of our books are printed
by Iowa City Women's Press."
I went home and thought about
that. I had been using a cheap
man's press because I am poor.
I decided: we are in the mid-
dle of a revolution and we
need women's presses. I dialed
319-338-7022 -- Iowa City Wo-
men's Press. I said, “My name
is Kady. I want you to print
my book." Iowa City Women's
Press is run by 4 women who
take turns doing everything.
One day I got a telegram from
one of them, asking me to tele-
phone. (I don't have a tele-
phone because I figured out in
1976 that over a period of 20
or 30 years the telephone com-
pany would lose 60 thousand
dollars if I disconnected my
telephone. So I had it discon-
nected.) I drove to town and
called from the laundromat pay
phone. She said, "I am not
supposed to be reading your
book. I am just running the
press. Once you get The Big
Press running, it's like
driving on the interstate. I
was reading as the press ran
and I noticed there is some-
thing wrong in the middle of
the letter to Holly Near."
Some words are missing. I
said, "Put in a period and
keep on printing." She said,
