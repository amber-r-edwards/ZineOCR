WOMEN in transition

I had a dream last month  
that I'd like to share with you.  
I dreamed I had finally left  
my husband; I passed through  
the door of his house and stood  
outside, where the sun shone on  
the green hills and valleys  
of the world. As I was looking  
around, wondering which house  
I would live in next, I slowly  
formed a question that had  
never been asked before.

"Why do I always have to live  
in some man's house?" Be-  
cause it suddenly occurred to  
me that women, too, could  
build houses: all they had to  
do was to realize that they  
could.

It wasn't too many years  
ago that women had to depend  
on men for all the necessi-  
ties of life. A woman, single  
or married, generally lived  
with her father, husband, son  
or some other male relative  
or employer. This isn't  
true anymore, of course, women  
can earn their own bread and  
live alone if they please,  
although we are slow to realize  
that this can be a serious  
lifetime choice.

But few people want to live  
alone, and here's where we are  
almost as dependent as ever.  
Women are still forced into the  
feminine role, not by number  
but by loneliness. For the  
one officially sanctioned source  
of closeness for women is  
marriage. Yet marriage (and  
most other couple relation-  
ships) separate us. In exchange  
for intimacy with one man, we  
separate ourselves from every  
one else--by centering our  
lives within single-family  
houses, by taking sole respon-  
sibility for our children,  
by treating other women as  
threats to this one intimacy.  
Men join force with each  
other every day, but for women  
--well, "divide and conquer"  
really works.

My dream was firmly  
rooted in my waking life,  
because I did leave my  
husband last fall, and I have  
indeed been trying to move  
out of my man-centered  
thinking and find my  
own way of living in the  
world. I've been in a  
good place for changing and  
growing, because I've been  
living in a community (Insti-  
tute Mountain West) which  
is not male dominated, and  
which provides much of the  
closeness I need without  
requiring the emotional  
tradeoffs that usually ac-  
company couple relationships.  
As a result, I now take  
communal living very seriously  
as a base for people learning  
to exercise their own  
strength. And particularly  
for women, who have been  
separated for so long and  
are now finding their  
strength through solidarity  
with each other.

For me, the difficulties  
in building a house for my-  
self have been psychic; fears  
(would our families and  
friends reject me?), uncer-  
tainties (could I really  
take care of myself?), guilt  
trips (what would this do  
to the children?). For many  
women, there are also practi-  
cal difficulties--full-time  
child care, no place to live,  
no money, no job skills.  
These problems can be para-  
lyzing for a woman alone.  
They can be overcome by women  
together.

So: a proposal. I would  
like to see a communal house  
in Denver for women only, a  
house whose main purpose is  
giving support to women who  
are trying to restructure their  
lives. Practical support;  

a place to live cheaply by  
sharing space and possessions,  
maybe temporarily free by  
sharing income. The opportu-  
nity to cooperate with sisters  
in child care. Maybe job  
sharing, or a job coop for  
part-time work. And psychic  
support; living with sisters in  
a community that encourages  
openness. Sharing our strug-  
gles, one to one or in groups,  
with other people who know  
what we're talking about.

Knowing that we aren't alone.

I see this house as a base from  
which women would have the  
chance to explore new living  
possibilities, and to feel their  
strength as women and  
with women. It would seem  
natural for this house to have  
shared child care for the resi-  
dents; it might also serve as  

a permanent home for a coop  
nursery school. Perhaps  

space for a women's center, a  
library or clinic?

There is some money avai-  
lable for this project; it  
should be possible to make a  
down payment on a building  
and, instead of pouring rent  
into a capitalistic landlord's  
pocket; liberate it in the form  
of a land trust permanently  
owned by the women who occupy  
it.

A lot of people have ex-  
pressed interest and support  
for this idea. What is needed  
right now is a few women who  
share my commitment to com-  
munal living, who would con-  
sider actually living in the  
house for several months and  
putting at least part-time  
time and energy into it. If  
that sounds like you, I'd like  
to hear from you. I can be  
reached at the Institute, 2096  
Emerson Street, or phone  
573-6394.

I see the article in Women,  
Vol. 2, No. 4, on the Philadel-  
phia Women's Transition House  
for a more detailed discussion  
of this idea.
