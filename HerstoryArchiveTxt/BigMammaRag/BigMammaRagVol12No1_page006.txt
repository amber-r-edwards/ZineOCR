Headquarters Bombed

On Dec. 13, armed units of  
the United Freedom Front  
continued their attacks on  
the U.S. military machine  
with the bombing of the New  
York District Navy recruit-  

ing headquarters, in East  
Meadow, Long Island, New  
York. They state: "We take  

this action in solidarity  
with the People of Central  

America, especially Nicar-  
agua and El Salvador, who  
continue to resist U.S. im-  
perialism's escalating acts  
of war.

Suicide Pills

A Congresbury,  
meeting has voted that  

England  
town  
suicide pills should be  

made available to residents  

in the event of a nuclear  

attack.

Residents voted 62-16 to  
back Dr. Richard Lawson's  
plans to hand out lethal  
doses of morphine to people  

who don't want to endure a  
slow death from radiation  
poisoning.

Strong Protests

In Brazil, with inflation  
running at 200%,  
employment and starvation  
widespread, masses of people  
are demanding a cancellation  
of the huge International  
Monetary Fund debt, going  
on strike and rioting over  
food. On Oct. 28, Sao Paolo  
subway riders burned two  
train stations in a protest  
against a totally defective  
transport system. The halls  
of Congress resounded with  
anger when the one Indian  
representative, elected by  
workers, Blacks, Indians  
and feminists from Sao Paolo,  
told a horrified room full  
of politicians; "To me,  
every minister is a thief."

“The Latest Fiction’

In England, a computer  
training program called Ex-  
ercise Regenerate has been  
prepared which divides the  
post-World War 3 country  
into eight regions, each to  
be run by an unidentified  
"controller." One of the  
controller's first tasks  
will be to divide the pop-  
ulation into six groups:  
ill, sick, dying, dead,  
cooperative healthy and  
criminally healthy. Priority  
is also given to the produc-  
tion of food, clothing,  
shelter, commerce and comm-  
unications. Bruce Kent, of  
the Campaign for Nuclear  
Disarmament, has called it  
"the latest fiction," while  
pointing out its references  
to forced labor and omission  
of the role of the military.

Human Rights?

President Reagan killed  
legislation recently which  
would have required him to  
file semiannual reports to  
Congress on the human rights  
record of the U.S.-backed  
government in El Salvador.  
White House  
spokesman Larry Speakes said  
the administration was  
"firmly committed to the  
protection of human rights,  
economic and political re-  
forms, the holding of elec-  
tions and progress in pro-  
secuting the cases of mur-  
dered American citizens in  
El Salvador."

Even so,

Chemical War

The South African govern-  
ment has turned neighboring  
Namibia into a testing  
ground for new lethal types  
of weapons designed for use  
on civilians. The report  
from a Johannesburg news-  
paper said the carrying out  
of such experiments has been  
made possible by the contin-  
uing military aid which Pre-  
toria receives from the U.S.  
and other western countries.  
Intensive development of  
new, more sophisticated  
types of chemical and bio-  
logical weapons, under the  
guidance of U.S. and Israeli  
specialists, is taking place  
in secret laboratories at  
the Institute for Medical  
Research of the South Afri-  
can Armed Forces. They are  
also working on a so-called  
ethnic biological weapon  
which is fatal only to  
Black Africans.

Records Purged

In a highly unusual legal  
move, all criminal records  
involving two former top  

FBI officials convicted of  
authorizing illegal break-  
ins have been purged from  
federal court files. Mark  
Felt and Edward Miller can  
now claim they have never  
even been indicted in conn-  
ection with a crime. They  
were convicted in 1980 on  
federal charges of violating  
the civil rights of people  
whose homes were illegally  
searched during the hunt for  

members of the Weather Under-  

ground in the early 1970's.

Defoliant Kills

At least 17 people died  
in a remote Amazon region  
after contractors working  
for a government utility  
used a defoliant similar to  
Agent Orange.

An official of the Para  
State Agriculture Department  
(Brazil) said a state team  
has confirmed 17 Tordon-155  
poisoning deaths and sus-  
pects the defoliant in 25  
other cases. Tordon-155 was  
allegedly used by government  
employed contractors who  
slashed a jungle corridor  
for power line construction  
in 1980.

The federal utility that  
employed the contractors  
said, “Frankly, we can't  
imagine where they are get-  
ting this incorrect informa-  
tion. Our studies show that  
the deaths attributed to  
Tordon-155 were actually the  
result of natural causes."

Revenge

In New Delhi, 200 women  
from various women's groups  
burst into the home of Su-  
preme Court lawyer Rajan  
Saluja, stripped him naked  
and beat him to protest the  
alleged "dowry death" of his  
wife, Chandramohini. They  
then marched him to a police  
station and demanded his  
arrest. An investigation was  
ordered, but no charges were  
filed. In India, dismissals  
of charges in "dowry deaths"  
(when parents cannot meet  
dowry demands) are common;  
convictions of bride killers  
are rare.

Anti-Establishment?

Australian actress Judy  
Davis, known for her por-  
trayals of an assertive, ac-  
tive, progressive woman in  
both My Brilliant Career and  
Heatwave, is now playing a  
"terrorist" leader in the  
movie The Final Option. The  
film depicts a British anti-  
nuclear group as communist-  
backed terrorists who take  
over a U.S. embassy. The film  
reportedly garnered rave  
reviews from Reagan and  
other White House officials  
after a special screening  
at Camp David. Evan Lloyd,  
producer of the film, says  
he wants “...to counteract  
movies like The China Syn-  
drome, Missing and Gandhi."  
Explains Lloyd: "I've been  
irritated by a strong pre-  
sence within the film colony  
of films with an anti-esta-  
blishment message."
