Filipino Women

were coming and going, hold-
ing meetings, making plans...
The wall of one room was
lined with shelves filled
with books on feminism and
the women's movement around
the world. There were a few
books on women in the Phil-
ippines. "We don't have much
on women in our country yet,”
says Luz, who works full-
time at the center. “We are
trying to produce some mat-
erials on Filipino women in
English, Tagalog and the
other languages of the Phil-
ippines," she added as she
showed me some filing cabin-
ets with articles and inter-
views with Filipino women
workers, peasants, students,
prostitutes in the growing
sex-tourism industry. "We
are just beginning. We are
also producing slide shows
— three so far — and a series
of comics." Luz pointed out
the handicrafts along the
other wall — woven cloth and
straw baskets and mats — all
traditionally women's arts
and crafts. In the next room
a blackboard listed themes
for discussion for the next
month: women's psychology,
peasant women's role in
agricultural production,
sexuality, labour organizing
— "We are trying to produce
both practical materials and
good sharp theoretical dis-
cussion binding the experien-
ces of women in dealing with
daily issues and struggles."
Feminism is a word that is
not used very much in the
Philippines. It has so many
negative connotations due
to the way that the mass
media has distorted the
feminist movement and por-
trayed feminists in other
parts of the world as a
lunatic fringe of bra-
burning fanatics. But if
feminism means looking at
the sexist roots of the opp-
ression of women and at how
these are intertwined with
economic ones, then there
appears to be a growing
women's movement with a fem-
inist perspective in the
Philippines now.

"We want to build a move-
ment rooted in our own real-
ity in the Philippines. We
want to build links with wo-
men in other countries; to share
experiences, but not to
imitate the women's movement
elsewhere. That was our
mistake in the early 1970s,"
explains Ruth, a filmmaker
and writer and member of a
women's media group. "I was
a founding member of a femi-
nist organization at the
time. We were mainly students
and young professionals.
There was some truth in the
accusation that we were
western and ‘bourgeois’ at
the time. We were mainly
imitating the US feminists.
We had several protests
against using women as sex
objects and picketed a
couple of beauty contests.
Unfortunately, the movement
never developed beyond that
because in 1972 Marcos
declared Martial Law and
disbanded all organizations."
"After Martial Law, many
women went underground and
joined the resistance. Some
people even joined the
guerrillas of the New People's
Army (NPA) in the mountains
and rural areas. Since then
many women have also joined
the legal or semi-legal
opposition movement to
discuss how women could be
productive amidst the turb-
ulence of the times. Imagine
all the women producing
soap and foodstuffs while
there is a war going on.
Imagine these women
organizing the production
work while there is a
drought, no credit and
no protection from the daily
violence — bombings and
shootings. While we were
discussing Evelyn Reed's
Women's Evolution, nearby
agencies were being raided
by the military, but the wo-
men seemed unruffled and they
counselled us to continue
discussing the history of
Marcos," added Luz. “We
never know when some org-
anization is going to be
declared 'subversive' and
outlawed."

"Because we are living
under a repressive US-backed
regime, the national ques-
tion has been given priority
over the women's question,
both in the underground and
in the legal opposition.
Times are changing now. The
resistance and opposition
to Marcos is so strong, that
women are also starting to
organize themselves as
women. There's no question
of a separatist, anti-male
movement. Men and women are
fighting together in the
general struggle to change
society. But women are no
longer sitting back and
letting women's issues be
considered secondary ones
in the movement."

In Manila I heard many
stories of the exceptional
courage of the women in the
countryside where militariza-
tion and repression is more
brutal and evident than in
the big cities, and where
the resistance is also
stronger and more open. One
woman who had just come back
from Mindanao, a large
island in the south, told
me: "The women were inspir-
ing because they were clear

production. They even com-
posed a song about women's
historic accomplishments
in the humanization of our
species!"

I had the opportunity to
see the courageousness of
the rural women in person
when I visited the island of
Samar. Circling it in the
plane, it seemed a tropical
paradise of palm trees and
sandy beaches, rice fields
and bright tropical flowers,
a real Garden of Eden. As
rich as it is in natural
resources, Samar is one of
the most depressed and im-
poverished islands of the
Philippines - and one of the
most heavily militarized.
Samar is in many ways
similar to El Salvador and
Guatemala, with massacres,
arrests and tortures by
the military in the villages
along the coast. Most of the
mountainous interior is
controlled by the New
People's Army who, together
with the peasants, have
instituted a program of land
reform. The wrath of the
displaced landlords and the
military is unfortunately
being vented on the farmers
and fishers of the coasts.

In one of these coastal
villages I met with groups
of peasant women who are
organized in community-
based primary health care
programs. The doctor who
had trained them was dead,
assassinated last May in-
side his clinic - 15 bullets
in his body. "Why was he
killed?" I asked, "by whom?"
"We don't know," they said.
"All we know is that Dr.
Bobby de la Paz and his wife
Sylvia were helping the poor
people for free. They never
asked for money. They were
teaching us how to help our-
selves and each other." One
old woman spoke up: “It was
peaceful here until the
military came."

"Malnutrition, tuberculo-
sis, and dysentery in
children are our biggest
health problems. We are
malnourished because we are
poor, and we are poor be-
cause of the landlords. Most
families can only eat one
full meal a day. In the
months between the time when
the rice runs out and the
next harvest, all we have
to eat are root crops —
camote and cassava," the
woman explained.

"The doctor and his wife
taught us preventative
medicine, how to vaccinate,
how to test for tuberculosis
without X-rays, cleanliness,
how to use herbal medicines,
what vegetables are used for
malnutrition. We have our
own herbal gardens so we
don't have to depend on
outside medicine and we grow
vegetables so our children
will have the right vitamins.
The idea of land reform has
reached here but we are not
organized here yet. We help
each other in our garden
plots."

“What do you do now that
the doctor is gone?" I asked.
They answered, "We still go
on. A woman paramedic helps
us now and we train each
other. We take turns as
volunteers in our health
clinic in the village. We
are not afraid.”

In the New People's Army
(NPA) women are fighting in
most of the 34 guerrilla
fronts. The NPA is composed
of 10,000 full-time soldiers
and 40,000 armed militia
and is active in 52 of the
71 provinces of the Philip-
pines, mostly in the rural
areas, where they have the
support of some 6 million
peasants. The NPA is the
military arm of the Communist
Party of the Philippines
(CPP) and is part of the
National Democratic Front
(NDF), a united clandestine
opposition front of various
forces. I was told many
stories of the bravery of
the women NPA and how they
had distinguished themselves
in battle. Most of the
women, however, are engaged
