Dallas Prostitutes Fight

by Ruth Rinehart

"If prostitution's such a sin, then
why aren't they arresting men?"
"Don't tell me what to do with my
body." “My ass is mine."

These were a few of the signs car-
ried when an estimated 3,000 Dallas-
ites turned out for a “loiter-in" on
August 21. The demonstration was or-
ganized in support of the streetwalk-
ers being harassed by a citywide
crackdown on prostitution.

Long-stemmed roses were distributed
to the streetwalkers, thousands of
leaflets were handed out, many women
arrived "dressed prepared to walk the
streets," and nearly 800 people wore
cards challenging "Am I one?”

People started gathering at 10 p.m.
in the Cedar Springs area, the
streets worked by the prostitutes.
After two hours of marching, loiter-
ing, chanting, etc., the organizing
point was converted to a rallying
site.

Two of the women who organized the
loiter-in spoke from the top of a
pickup truck to a responsive crowd.
They spoke to keep the consciousness
of the crowd on a political level
rather than turning to a party at-
mosphere.

In a short talk, the women went
over the reasons for the rally, wo-
men's right to control their bodies,
the oppression of gays and male pros-
titutes as well as female prosti-
tutes, and the senselessness of try-
ing to ease sexuality.

The rally ended "when the coyote
howls" with hundreds of throats
opened wide and baying at the mid-
night sky.

A "known prostitute” (a woman with
a prostitution conviction within the
previous year) can be arrested if
she "...beckons to, stops or attempts
to stop motor vehicle operators by
hailing, waving of arms, or other
bodily gesture."

A woman is given one chance to ex-
plain conduct before being arrested.
The local police have been quoted as
saying "waving to a friend is no ex-
cuse.”

Any woman can be detained and taken
to police headquarters while her ar-
rest record is being checked.

The ordinance discriminates against
women in that it deals only with the
prostitute and not with her customer.
In a class action suit filed against
the Oakland Police Department, Judge
Avakian ordered that agents, ser-
vants, and employees be restricted
from “using any methods which sys-
tematically result in a greater
likelihood of arrests of women as a
class than of men, or subjecting
women to full custodial arrest on
the basis of criteria which are not
applied equally to men in relation
to the same type of offense."

The issue has elicited much sup-
port from the Dallas citizenry. Two
organizations have resulted from all
the commotion. A group of prosti-
tutes calling themselves "Ladies Of
The Evening" (LOTE) met with Dallas
City Attorney Lee Holt to discuss
alternatives to the ordinance. No
feasible solution was reached.

Important to mention here is the
fact that the organizer and most
vocal member of LOTE was arrested
soon after. The charge was burglary
and a $5,000 bond was posted.

The second bunch was a group of
area feminists called the Prostitute
Support System of Dallas (PSS), who
organized to do just that - "sup-
port their street sisters." It was
this group that organized the loiter.

Alabama Women Push for ERA

by Mary B. Weidler

Alabama Citizens for ERA (ACERA)
is a coalition of women's groups
which has been working for three
long years to get the ERA ratified
by the legislature. It was formed
in 1973 out of the initiative of an
energetic 22-year-old named Marilyn
Williams.

It was a fact that there was no
chance for victory. Alabama's pro-
blems with the ERA are in many ways
peculiar to the Southern region. In
the South, only Texas and the border
states of Kentucky and Tennessee
have ratified (Tennessee has since
rescinded). As of 1960, only 33% of
the Southern population had graduated
from high school. It is estimated
that there are 800,000 illiterates
in Alabama out of a population
of 3.5 million. The per capita in-
come is among the lowest in the na-
tion. Until 1960, migration out of
the state was greater than that com-
ing in. This trend is now reversed
with many businesses, like IBM, mov-
ing to Alabama because of the low
wages and taxes.

The South is characterized by an
absence of a strong middle class, a
persistence of agrarian values, a
rigid social structure and a confor-
mity of thought and behavior. The
major religious groups, Baptist and
Methodist, are very patriarchal and
anti-intellectual. The traditional
role for women has been strongly en-
forced.

Attitudes in Alabama are beginning
to change, however. State troopers
and local police, for example, are
under federal court order to hire
women. Women are changing the ways
in which they think about themselves.
For example, now women can call of-
ficers chairpersons as opposed to
chairmen.

Another problem for the ERA is
that members of nationally pro-ERA
organizations do not support the Am-
endment. For example, most members
of the League of Women Voters do not
strongly support the ERA. Alabama
did not pass the 19th Amendment un-
til 1951.

The board members of ACERA come
from organizations like the League
of Women Voters, American Associa-
tion of University Women, Business
and Professional Women, NOW, etc.
Any group wanting to join could do
so for a mere $15 a year. At the
first board meeting, much time was
spent deliberating individual member-
ships--how much, who and what voting
power they should have. Although
few individuals were ever recruited
or tried to join, the more feminist
of the board members kept hoping
younger enthusiasts, especially
students, would miraculously appear
and help win the fight.

In 1974, the apportionment for the
first time split counties and gave
cities a fair representation (Birm-
ingham was 42% Black but had never
had Black representation since Re-
construction). Alabama's population
is distributed about 50-50 between
rural and urban. Now appears what
seems a golden opportunity for women
and pro-ERA candidates to ensure, if
not a majority, a strong pro-ERA
caucus in Alabama's new legislature.
It never happened. Of the 20 women
who ran for the House (105 seats)
and Senate (35 seats), only one, of
questionable views, was elected.

There was a split in ACERA between
the traditional women's groups and
the younger, more radical women who
were members of NOW and the Alabama
Women's Political Caucus. This lat-
ter faction took initiative in work-
ing for the campaigns of pro-ERA
candidates.

In 1975, ACERA voted not to bring
up the ERA in the Legislature be-
cause the conservative members of
the group wanted to wait until the
issue had more support. Approxim-
ately one-third of the House and 10
votes in the Senate were certain.
With good lobbying and many letters
it was felt there was a good chance.
The polls showed 55%-73% of voters
in favor of the ERA, however the
conservatives won: without ACERA's
support in terms of people and money
there was little point in bringing
it up that year.

The ERA was introduced into the
Legislature this year on June 15th
with a lobbying day and a reception
for the legislators, to which over
300 supporters came. In terms of
numbers, it was a huge success.

On July 21, 1976, the Alabama
House Judiciary Committee turned
down the ERA in an 8-6 vote. There
are serious doubts about a state ERA
passing until well into the next
decade. Women of Alabama need the
national ratification of ERA.

Some of the more common mistakes
that were made with the ERA were that
1) no case was made by using concrete
examples from Alabama law, 2) there
was not good organization in the ru-
ral areas, 3) no pro-ERA legislators
with power and respect of the body
existed, 4) middle-class voters were
not made aware of the issues, 5) lo-
cal pro-ERA groups, like the AFL-CIO
were not taken advantage of, 6) the
media image of “women's libbers" as
pro-ERA leaders was not overcome, and
7) there was not enough door-to-door
educating done.

As Bessie O'Brien Hundley said in
1915 after the defeat of the 19th
Amendment in Alabama, "It would take
more than an adverse committee re-
port or the men who we had cause to
believe were our friends to discourage
the women of this or any other
state who are working for women's
suffrage. The very fact that we have

Big Mama Rag Vol. 4 No. 9

Referendum
Issues:

Pros & Cons

Colorado voters will be voting on
ten referendum items on the ballot
on November 2nd. The following ones
are the most controversial and im-
portant. (Much of the material for
this article comes from the League
of Women Voters Ballot Issues 1976.)

#3 Nuclear Power--

This amendment would make approval
by two-thirds of each house of the
Colorado State Legislature necessary
for construction or modification of
any future nuclear power plant in
the state. It would also require
the legislature to conduct statewide
public hearings before taking any
votes. It would waive federally im-
posed limits on the liability for
damages resulting from the operation
of a nuclear plant.

Reasons for voting Yes: 1. Nuclear
power decisions should not be left
entirely to scientists, because
these decisions affect many people,
2. A major accident in a nuclear po-
wer plant releases radioactive ma-
terials which endanger all forms of
life, 3. The owners should be requi-
red to pay full compensation, rather
than leaving the burden on the vic-
tims as is now the case.

Reasons for voting NO: Unlimited
liability is unreasonable, since
most insurance programs have a maxi-
mum limit for liability.

#6 Repeal of State Equal Rights
Amendment--

This amendment would repeal the
state ERA which provides for equal
rights for women under the Colorado
law.

Reasons for voting Yes: very few
female athletes will choose to par-
ticipate in sex-integrated competi-
tion.

Reasons for voting NO: 1. Legal
rights should be guaranteed all per-
sons regardless of sex, 2. The ERA
is limited to governmental action
and does not extend into the private
sector such as family roles, right
to privacy, or church policy, 3. The
ERA does not result in any loss of
protections or responsibilities, but
applies them equally to men and wom-
en.

#7 Food Tax Repeal--

This amendment would end the sales
tax on food except for food in res-
taurants. Local governments could
still levy a sales tax on food for
revenue. The 1977 Colorado legisla-
ture will enact a tax on minerals,
oil shale and gas and increase the
tax on corporations with net profits
in excess of $50,000 to replace the
lost revenue from ending this tax.
Reasons for voting Yes: 1. A sales
tax on food is regressive and hurts
low and fixed income people much
more than rich people, 2. People
should be able to eat cheaply, 3.
Lost tax revenue will be replaced by
taxing business rather than hurting
individuals, 4. Business is under-
taxed and these taxes will not cost
jobs or force companies to relocate.
Reasons for voting NO: People will
just have to pay higher prices on
other products to make up for the
higher taxes on business.

#8 Beverage Container Deposit--

This amendment requires a refund-
able deposit on each beer and soft
drink container sold in Colorado.
The minimum deposit would be five
cents.

Reasons for voting Yes: 1. A depo-
sit would encourage widespread recy-
cling of containers, reducing ugly
and non-biodegradable litter, 2. pos-
sible price increases caused by in-
creased handling of reusable contain-
ers could be offset by reduced con-
tainer costs, 3. New jobs could be
created at the retail level to sort
returned containers, also no jobs
should be lost in the container in-
dustries, 4. A deposit refunding sys-
tem has worked well in Vermont and
Oregon.

Reasons for voting NO: There will
be a shift from cans to bottles for
beverage containers, hurting employ-
ment in the can industry.
