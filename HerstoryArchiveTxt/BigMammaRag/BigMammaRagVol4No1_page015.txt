Racism and the Grand Jury
On September 2, when the
two women were scheduled to
come to trial, the defense filed
several motions. One moved to
quash the indictment because
the grand jury was illegally un-
representative of the commun-
ity. Questioning of the jury com-
missioners revealed openly
racist attitudes towards black
people.
After this and other testi-
mony, the judge granted the
motion to quash the indictment
and sent the case to a new grand
jury. But he refused to rule on a
motion for a change of venue to
another area of the state, calling
the motion premature.
Woods and Todd are now free
on bond while awaiting the con-
vening of this new grand jury.
The family of the dead man has
hired a special prosecutor to
assist the state in bringing the
women to trial.

The Dessie X. Woods and
Cheryl S. Todd Defense Com-
mittee is in desperate need of
funds. Among their efforts is an
attempt to verify the need for a

change of venue through a sur- Denver, Colorado 80202.

of our continuing policy of pub-
lic education regarding women
charged and sentenced to
prison. The Coalition is also
planning to monitor various
Colorado corrections programs
to assess their responsiveness
to females.

We would like to develop a
referral service for female ex-of-
fenders in the larger Front
Range cities, but a volunteer is
needed to spend at least 16
hours per week for several
months to initiate the program.
Call 433-2179 for further infor-
mation about the Coalition, or
write Colorado Coalition on
Women and the Criminal Justice
System, 1545 Tremont Place.

Letters...
From Page 2

their distorted and incomplete
report of the history of Sagaris
(as evidenced in their full state-
ment) and their divisive tactics
can only divert us from the
serious political issues at stake.
I, too, have many criticisms of
Sagaris and of the collective, but
rather than direct them toward
destroying Sagaris, I would hope
that committed feminists with as
much energy to expend as the
Survival Community apparently
has, would either start a differ-
ent school, or put that energy
into working out ways of making
Sagaris a relevant, accountable
and valuable resource for the
Women's Movement.

Ed. note: There was no implica-
tion, intentional or otherwise,
that Judy Cohen supports the
analysis of the August 7th Sur-
vival statement. It is the view of
BMR that the basis of and
reasons for a split are
delineated in her letter but not that
the split should have been mani-
fested such as it was.

Morey — the material you send us is
much appreciated and, as you see,
used. We don’t have your address,
though. Please send it to us. Thanks
for your energy, it helps. Keep it
coming, Big Mama.

Big Mama is planning a Women and
Money issue for March. Please send
us your ideas, articles, suggestions,
names of books or other literature
you think should be reviewed,
whatever.

Our Politics of Health series is
picking up momentum as we realize
the scope and complexity of the sub-
ject. We need your ideas and input.
Call Wood at the office, 322-2010.

Every woman who thinks about her
experience is a political theorist.
Write it down and submit it for con-
sideration for our Struggle column.

Deadline date is now the 12th of
every month. Please be sure to get
your material in promptly; it really
is important.

Big Mama needs information on all
current boycotts. Call or write Wood
at the office.

Our next issue will be on racism. All
input welcomed (don't forget dead-
line is the 12th).

Big Mama needs regional reporters
all over the country and beyond, who
will cover local events, and who will
be prepared to respond to requests to
investigate stories in their areas.
You don’t need to be able to write
articles; what we want is
information. Write to Wood.
