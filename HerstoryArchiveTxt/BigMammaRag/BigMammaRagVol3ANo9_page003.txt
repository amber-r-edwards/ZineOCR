An Open Letter to
the Lesbian Community
Sisters,

I am now in the process of
writing a novel about us, the
Lesbian subculture in America.
Could some of you write to me
about the events and incidents
that have been or are striking or
important in your lives?

These could include specific
events, such as the beauty and
trauma of “coming out,”
incidents and impressions of
traveling around the United
States; the anger and frustration
of being hassled, jailed, raped, or
otherwise oppressed; and
relationships with special
people and/or special groups of
people. These could also include
your views of these events and
incidents, such as how you feel
about yourselves (your physical,
spiritual, intellectual, and
emotional development); how
you see your relationships with
each other; how you relate to the
lesbian community (or lack
thereof) where you live; and your
experiences with aloneness,
love, and pain.

Even a short paragraph from
some of you would be most
helpful. All of your letters will be
held strictly confidential. There
are relatively few good novels
about us — most of them have
been, in my experience, either

truly represent the textures of
our lives as we live them today. I
want to write our lives as we see
them, with our pain, our ecstasy,
our sense of humor, and our
endurance.

Solidarity

Dear Sisters,

We feel very concerned about
what happened to your office a
few weeks ago, as valuable
equipment was destroyed. Even
if we don’t know who it was, we
know that there are plenty of
those bastards who try to defeat
and destroy the struggle of
people everywhere. Things like
this happen to the Farmworkers
all the time throughout the
country. Just recently, one of our
cars got ripped off and Jesus Val-
derrama’s house broken into. In
California, homes of UFW
members get burned down.
Farmworkers lose their jobs
because they believe in justice.

We have to keep on fighting in
solidarity against fascism, and
we all shall overcome since we
believe in the truth of our goals
and in the struggle for oppressed
people.

Big Mama Rag Collective,

The Journal women want to
express our anger, pain, outrage
and support to you over the Big
Mama Rag office vandalization.
Political sabotage will not stop
the creation and growth of our
women's culture! Because
we're in a financial crisis ourselves, we can only offer a small
contribution to help your news-
paper recover. Nonetheless, our
sister-love is with you.

Be Strong,
Women: A Journal of
Liberation Collective

Dear Sister in Distress,

I am shocked to learn of the
attack on your Collective and
with the hate and viciousness of
the Establishment. Watergate is
still with us.

I am enclosing my check from
CSC to help repair the damages
and express our solidarity and
love for all of the Collective.

On with the struggle!

In love and liberation,
Valeda
Dear Sisters,

Your paper is excellent and it
looks good too.

This is just a note to let you
know that other women in the
feminist newspaper world really
appreciate your hard work.

Dear Sisters,

I just got back from vacation
and found your press release
waiting for me. I can't believe
such things are still happening
in 1975 in this country. You are
doing important and much
needed work and you have our
full support for it. I am passing
your press release on to Jane
Williamson, the managing editor
of the Women’s Studies News-
letter, and suggesting to her that
she do something about it in the
next issue. If we had any money
we'd send it. If you can think of
anything else we can do, please
let us know.

In sisterhood,
Brett Harvey

Dear Big Mama women,

I finally have the money to pay
for a subscription. I usually buy it
at Brillig Works but this way you
get all the money instead of
them. I think your paper is the
best women’s journal being
published right now. We get
most of the national women’s
papers in the Women's
Liberation Coalition and BMR is
the only one I read thoroughly.

Colorado Coalition on
Women and the Criminal
Justice System

Dear Big Mama Rag,

We appreciate your coverage,
in the August issue, of the Co/o-
rado Coalition on Women and
the Criminal Justice System
meeting. As your article
indicated, the Coalition has the
potential to affect some
permanent changes in the
criminal justice system's
relation to women. We are
working on some of these
changes now.

It is very important to us that
our official public statements as
a coalition be distinguished from
informal remarks of individual or
organizational members. In that
regard, we are distressed about
one implication contained in the
article.

During the July 8th meeting,
Phyllis Muczynski of the NOW
Prison Task Force did call for the
dismissal of May Gillespie as
warden of the Colorado
Women's Correctional
Institution. She urged that
letters to that effect be sent to
Rudy Sanfilippo, Director of the
Colorado Division of
Corrections. Support for that
action was expressed by a
number of individual members
of the Coalition. However, there
are persons or organizations
belonging to the Coalition (some
of these were specifically named
in your article as Coalition
members) who have taken no
public stand on the issue of Ms.
Gillespie’s dismissal and do not
wish to be reported as doing so.
The way the letter-writing cam-
paign was included in the same
article leaves the reader with the
impression that the total
Coalition supported the
campaign and this is incorrect.
Despite this contextual
problem, we appreciate your
continued coverage of our
activities and any others which
concern women victim-
offenders. Women in prison
continue to need community
support, as well as community
pressure for change.
Sincerely,
The Coalition

Susan Saxe
Debate Continued
Dear Women,

Regarding the comments on
Susan Saxe in the letters section
of the August issue of Big Mama
Rag:

Susan Saxe is not “writing
off” Jane Alpert, but rather is
explaining the dangers of
individual solutions within mass
political movements. Susan
Saxe will be spending the next
twelve years of her life in prison.
She made this choice as a
lesbian feminist on the basis of
the need for unity within the
revolutionary struggle.

Jane Alpert, on the other
hand, was able on turning
herself in to declare that it was
the happiest day of her life. She
could do this because she sees
the women’s movement as
separate from the movements of
other oppressed people. In so
doing, she has separated herself
from women in these other
movements, i.e., Third World
women and her ex-comrades in
the Weather Underground. We
support and understand her
right to change her activities, but
we cannot support her betrayal
of our movement. She is acting
like a little girl who has a fight
with her brother and then runs
home to her father.

It may be true that Jane Alpert
told the Feds only about her life
underground and did not give
direct information on others.
How anyone could spend four
years underground and not
know the dangers of talking to
the F.B.I. about anything is
beyond us. This individualistic
attitude, if tolerated, will do
nothing but damage to the
movement. Susan Saxe, who
was arrested because someone
answered an “innocent” ques-
tion knows this all too well. The
question asked in her case was
whether Saxe used cash or
checks to pay for things. Other
“innocent” questions are being
asked in many communities. We
must realize that telling the F.B.I.
the sky is blue can be a
dangerous statement.

Saxe sees herself as part of an
overall struggle including all
oppressed people. Her solution
is not the short range, individual
one. It is designed to protect and
strengthen her sisters and our
movement, at the sacrifice of her
own personal comfort. As she
says in her statement, (which
was printed in the July issue of
BMR):

“When we place the blame for
repression squarely on the
enemy, not on his targets, when
we unite to oppose him, he can
be driven away. But when we
run to the Man for shelter, when
we betray ourselves to appease
him, we only expose others to
his tactics and increase the
danger to us all.”

North Carolina Prisoner
Greetings,

I am one of the women that
was shipped out of Raleigh, N.C.
following the trouble at
Women’s Prison June 15-19,
1975 and I am one of the seventeen women that still remains at
W.C.C. in Morgantown, N.C. We
are in maximum security and
have no privileges to speak of
except smoking and canteen
twice a week. However, they
insist we are not on punish-
ment.

The pigs try to push us into a
corner but we are hip to their
game and just avoid them. I have
heard that your paper is free to
inmates. I would like to start
receiving it for it is one way in
which we can keep up with the
outside world. Keep up the good
work,

In struggle,
Gail Steele
