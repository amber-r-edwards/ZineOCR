Firings

Five of the eight staff members
of the Denver office of the United
Farmworkers were fired recently amid
a major reorganization of the union.

Yet while the official reasons
for the firings varied, the “real”
reason is believed to be tied to
the union's new bonds with the
Democratic Party.

Here's the story as we heard it
from a sixth staff member who quit
in protest: After the defeat of
Proposition 14 in California last
fall, the union began to reassess
its boycott strategy and place more
emphasis on field organizing.

Denver staffers were called in
for interviews to determine where
and if they would fit in with the
new scheme of things. They didn't.

One was fired for his previous
membership in a Maoist organization;
another for her criticism of the
way Proposition 14 was handled, and
the remaining three were given
reasons ranging from an alleged
"drinking problem" to “local
problems."

The union has recently become
more involved with the Democrats,
who had endorsed Proposition 14.

Do It Right

The National Abortion Rights Action

League encourages you to observe

Mother's Day May 8 with a local demon-
stration in defense of abortion rights.

There will be one in Washington D.C.,
and it will mobilize opposition to
another Hyde Amendment (Congress'
attempt to ban Medicaid abortions)
which may be attached to the new HEW
appropriations bill this spring. The

Washington demonstration will also de-
mand disability benefits for all preg-

nant workers.

Vietnam Legacy

Hundreds of thousands of cases
of VD are part of the US legacy to
Vietnam, but not the penicillin to
cure it. When US troops left, so
went all medical supplies. The Viet-
namese Women's Union is asking US
women to support a penicillin drive:
$2 buys two shots--enough to cure
the “average” case of VD. Send don-
ations to Penicillin for Vietnam,

Abortion Struggle

The Colorado Senate defeated in
a close 17 to 14 vote a bill which
would have required that all fe-
tuses born alive during an abortion
receive premature baby care. The
vote came after the Senate's two
women members termed the bill a
thinly veiled attack on the US
Supreme Court decision.

Meanwhile, abortion opponents
are trying to get 34 states to call
for a constitutional convention
which would ban abortions. They've
got five states so far, including
New Jersey where Right to Lifers
chanted and prayed in the state
house and left red roses on the
desks of the 80 assembly members.

Yoshimura Appeal

An appeal of Wendy Yoshimura's
Jan. 20 conviction is getting support
from the Oakland-based Fair Trial Com-
mittee. Basis for the appeal is preju-
dicial jury instructions and evidence
that one juror was coerced into chang-
ing her vote.

Yoshimura was sentenced to 1 to 15
years in prison last month on charges
of possessing illegal weapons and ex-
plosives found in a garage she rented
in 1972. She denied knowledge of the
contents of the garage, but her testi-
mony was stricken after she refused
to testify about her association with
Patricia Hearst and SLA members Bill
and Emily Harris.

Kills Germs Fast

Researchers at the University of
Pittsburgh recently confirmed what

feminist health workers and others have

known for a long time: contraceptive

barriers against VD. 97% of the 132
women who began using such after seek-
ing treatment for gonorrhea were free
of gonorrhea after six months. A
fourth of the women in the control

group had been reinfected.

Sticky Issue

The New York legislature is buz-
zing with controversy over which
creature should become the state in-
sect. One assemblyman thought he
had a shoo-in with his nomination of
the praying mantis; but at the last
minute, it was revealed that female
mantises eat their mates. Some femin-
ists argue that if it were the other
way around (male mantises eating fe-
males), the bill would have had no
problems since legislators would
have had no difficulty identifying
with the insect.
