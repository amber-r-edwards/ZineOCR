“A reform is any proposed
change that alters the condi-
tions of life in a particular area.

. . It reforms or forms anew the
way things are. It can alter them
in a way that is helpful or de-
structive. A reform, simply put, is
a change or a program for
change.”

Charlotte Bunch,
“The Reform Tool Kit”
(Quest, Vol. 1, No. 1)

It is, as Charlotte Bunch points
out, neither the style of a pro-
gram nor its surface content that
counts in assessing its value to
feminists. Any particular pro-
gram may seem stodgy or reck-
less, may involve lobbying or
shooting. What counts is what
Bunch calls the “substantive
content (how the activity affects
different classes of women and
what happens to the women
working on it).” A change now
happening in Minneapolis pro-
vides a perfect example of an ac-
tivity, a reforming, that matters.

The ($64,000) Question

The center of feminist activi-
ties in Minneapolis is a large,
warm, wood-paneled brick
mansion built near the turn of
the century by John Crosby (a
founder of General Mills) and his
sister Caroline. It has three
stories and twenty-three rooms.
The top two floors house Chry-
salis and the Lesbian Resource
Center (LRC); the first-floor
library and living room provide
space for feminist groups to
present workshops, classes,
conferences, lectures, meet-
ings, theater events, and
dances; the ample kitchen and
dining room offer accommoda-
tion for the projected Full Cycle
Restaurant. Rented from the
Minneapolis Society of Fine
Arts, the house has developed
over the past thirteen months a
long and varied record of
women’s use. And in Septem-
ber of this year, the house went
on the open market with an
asking price of $64,000.

The problems this presented
were both practical and theor-
etical. To lose the house was to
forfeit not only space but also
networks forged by working
under the same roof and tradi-
tions formed by time. On the
other hand, to muster the $20,000
necessary for a down pay-
ment, to say nothing of the con-
tinuing funds necessary for
mortgage commitments, is a
labor threatening to both re-
formers and radicals.

A radical analysis rejects
patriarchy, capitalism, and white
supremacy, everything repre-
sented by a $64,000 grain-
dealer’s mansion and the white
middle-class society that owns
it. We are rightly wary of any
change that appears to entangle
us in the existing social,
economic, and political order.
Yet, as Bunch argues, it is
crippling to confuse reform with
reformism; working within the
system need not imply endorse-
ment of the system. In a col-
lective meeting on September 8th,
a Coalition of Minneapolis
women’s groups came to their
decision: they will attempt to buy
the house.

This decision seems inevit-
able when seen in the context of
the history of Chrysalis, the
developing politics of the Les-
bian Resource Center, and the
increasing impact the house has
had on the Twin Cities com-
munity. Illustrating the way in
which a program of reform may
contribute to a revolutionary
process, the backgrounds of the
decision are worth examining.

Chrysalis

Even the name implies tran-
sitions, metamorphoses, pro-
cesses of change. A chrysalis is
the organism between caterpil-
ler and butterfly, the cocooned
and evolving being. It is an apt
metaphor for the process Chry-
salis furthers.

Chrysalis was founded three
years ago as a women’s re-
source center working out of the
Minneapolis YWCA. After some
trouble with the Y's conserva-
tism, they left in August 1974,
initiating a space search with
Sagaris, a local women's
therapy collective. In October
1974, they moved into the
Minneapolis Women's House,
renting the top floor to the LRC
and office and meeting space to
others of the over two hundred
local women’s and feminist
groups.

Since 1972, requests for ser-
vices from Chrysalis have more
than doubled. So far there are
three units involved in these ser-
vices: Advocacy, Counseling,
and a developing Resource-
Educational unit. In a typical
month (July 1975), the Ad-
vocacy Unit of Chrysalis re-
ceived 260 calls and the Coun-
seling program met with 572
women. Through Chrysalis, as
one local client emphasized, “a
woman can discover for herself
what she wants to do with her
life.” Another client adds, “as
long as Chrysalis is maintained,
I see no reason why any woman
need be alone unless she
chooses to be.”

The Advocacy Unit involves
both referral and direct service.
Referrals occur to feminist
organizations, like the Elizabeth
Blackwell Women’s Health
Center, The Battered Women’s
Consortium, and the St. Paul
Women’s Advocates, and to es-
tablished local and federal agen-
cies like the Welfare Depart-
ment, the Legal Aid Society, and
the Hennepin County Court Ser-
vices. In the first case, Chrysalis
has become a nexus for infor-
mation about local feminist poli-
tics and powers. In the second,
Chrysalis can personally guide
the seeker through the laby-
rinths of bureaucracy to that
which she seeks. To aid in this,
there are women trained in wel-
fare, paralegal, childcare, hous-
ing, vocational, and emergency
work. If you are mystified by your
gynecologist, hassled by your
landlord, swindled by your wel-
fare worker, or beaten by your
husband, Chrysalis’s Advocacy
Unit is the place to call.

The Counseling Unit offers
both individual and group coun-
seling. In July, Chrysalis held
151 individual interviews, aver-
aging 90 minutes each, and ran
support groups, AA groups,
Chemical Dependency sessions,
and divorce groups involving
another 472 women. Through
talking with women at Chry-
salis, taking part in women’s
support groups, and eventually
leading them herself, one
woman noted that she “began to
reclaim the me that existed yet
never knew.” This experience
seems typical of the metamor-
phoses Chrysalis facilitates, the
evolution it promotes.

The Resource-Education Unit
is a natural outgrowth of the first
two branches of Chrysalis. Its
goals will be to know what's
happening in the feminist and
metropolitan communities, to
coordinate programs in order to
prevent duplication, and to plan
action in areas now neglected,
areas like corporate discrimina-
tion practices and class advo-
cacy suits.

Fully funded by government,
state, and local foundations,
Chrysalis is a non-profit, tax-
exempt corporation which does
not charge for the services it
offers. It is staffed by thirty
women, ten of whom are sal-
aried, and it operates efficiently
and conscientiously as a col-
lective.

“Collectives aren't holy to us,”
staff person Karen Starr notes;
“it's just the way we work.” The
full collective of thirty women
meets once a month to make as a
body all policy and financial
decisions. Smaller energy units,
task forces for such areas as per-
sonnel, outreach, community
funding, and planning account-
ability, meet more often. The
staff itself meets weekly to
thrash out any personal or inter-
personal difficulties. This
method of organization, con-
sonant with feminist goals, has
been visibly, even radiantly, suc-
cessful.

By the time of the September
meeting, then, Chrysalis was a
large, smoothly-running, estab-
lished group, fully used to work-
ing with state and local hier-
archies, foundations, and
agencies: the largely male-
dominated machinery of the
larger society. This was not the
case with the Lesbian Resource
Center.

The LRC

The Lesbian Resource Center
was founded as an alternative to
the bar scene. Unlike Chrysalis,
which sought from the begin-
ning to form both financial and
informational links with the out-
side world, the LRC, like so many
lesbian groups, sought to form
its own world. This it has, very
energetically and beautifully,
done.

The LRC is a bright, welcom-
ing cluster of meeting rooms,
offices, and lounges just up the
stairs from Chrysalis. Like a bar,
it is a place to meet and a place to
party. But it offers much more.

There's a phone-in service, a
newsletter, a library. There are
both individual and group coun-
seling services run by lesbian
therapists. Se’s Your Old Lady,
Minneapolis’s fine lesbian-
feminist journal, works out of
the center, as does the Laven-
der Cellar Theater program.
Sports teams, classes, and
readings are organized there.
The Center maintains, as well, a
bureau of trained speakers who
provide information, facilitate
discussions, and conduct work-
shops in the community. All
women are invited to attend and
participate in the Center's com-
munity meetings. It is a highly
developed, well-coordinated
alternative world, founded in a
radical lesbian-feminist analy-
sis and, at least until August, re-
maining largely aloof from
reform processes and re-
formers' thinking.

This stance changed partly
because of the thinking of two
LRC women, Karen Brown and
Karen Clark, who were at Sag-
aris this summer. Karen
Brown's intensely thoughtful
letter to the LRC, included in the
October newsletter, urges a
turning outward. The Center,
she argues, has valued “purity
without compromises” and
therefore has “shied away from
pushing reforms because that
would entail thinking and work-
ing in terms of power.” Mentioning Bunch’s article, she goes
on to analyze the ways in which
reform need not clash with revo-
lution: “We're going to have to
figure out how to win,” and this,
she adds, “will mean strate-
gizing to move beyond just pro-
viding services and meeting
needs.”

When the house went up for
sale, the women of the LRC
faced the very problem Bunch’s
essay addresses: whether to
channel revolutionary energies
and radical analyses into sup-
port for a reform task. It would
mean abandoning lesbian
separatism to work with straight
women in the larger community
and with male power-hier-
archies in the metropolitan area;
it would mean connections with
patriarchy and capitalism; it
would certainly compromise the
purity of an alternative position.

In assessing the problem,
Karen Clark mentioned that she
had applied Charlotte Bunch’s
five criteria for judging a valid
reform. The use of the house has
materially improved the lives of
women; it has built individual
women’s self-respect and confi-
dence; it has given women a
sense of power and imagination
as a group; it has educated
women politically; and, if ex-
tended, it would weaken, by its
concentration of women’s ener-
gies, the patriarchal control of
society and its institutions. The
LRC was then ready to join with
Chrysalis in the effort to main-
tain the Crosby mansion as a
Women’s House.

The Union

The meeting of September 8th
resolved to attempt to buy the
house through Chrysalis, with
the agreement that Chrysalis
would keep it as a women’s
space, available to all feminist
groups within the community. A
house committee was then
established to work towards the
purchase.

As the committee was puzzi-
ng over sources for the $20,000
immediately necessary, Karen
Clark noticed that $15 million
federal revenue-sharing money
had just been granted to the
Twin Cities, 3.5 million dollars of
