No Compromise

An open letter to the feminist media  
from Daughters, Inc.:

Several women have asked either us  
or Rita Mae Brown if we did not con-  
sider the sale of Rubyfruit Jungle to  
Bantam a “selling out." By the very  
way this question is phrased, we think  
there is a prejudgment of both author  
and publisher. We would like to set  
the facts straight.

First, we want to make clear that  
we did not "sell Rubyfruit Jungle."  
Our arrangement with Bantam is that  
they bought a license to publish a  
mass-market edition of this book for  
ten years (including foreign rights),  
with Daughters having approval of the  
jacket. Rita Mae retains her copy-  
right and Daughters retains all other  
rights and permissions. We will keep  
our edition in print.

A basic question for feminist pub-  
lishers is how to expand and in what  
directions. We now understand that  
unless we can reach a wide and div-  
ersified market and give a woman as  
many chances as possible to realize  
money from her work (besides the money  
earned through Daughters), we would  
still be asking that women "sacri-  
fice" something to publish with us.

*(See interviews by Jan Clausen, Sin-  
Aster Wisdom, I, 2.) With the lic-  
ensing of the mass-market rights of  
Rubyfruit Jungle, we believe we have  
demonstrated to women writers that  
they can publish with women - leaving  
the basic control over their work out  
of the hands of multinational cor-  
porations - and still reach a mass ~  
audience and make money in proportion  
to the saleability of their work.

We do not own an author's work as  
an object and do not dictate to any  
woman. We will not refuse the lic-  
ense of any rights, if the author  
wants it, that will give her wider  
distribution and individual compensa-  
tion for her work; nor will we lic-  
ense any rights against the author's  
wishes. We will continue, however,  
to seek out all possible choices for  
her.

Rita Mae is the only "famous" femin-  
ist who has consistently and exclu-  
sively published with the feminist  
presses. Because she published  
Rubyfruit Jungle with Daughters we  
were able to publish a total of nine-  
teen books of which only some pay  
their own way within our limited fem-  
inist markets. Rita Mae "sold in"  
to the feminist presses in 1972. All  
our presses would be much stronger  
today if other "famous" feminists  
had taken the same risk. The question  
is, it seems to us, why the other  
best-selling feminist authors who  
continue to publish exclusively with  
the multinational boys have not chosen  
to engage in mutual self-help with  
the feminist presses - and why, in  
interviews with them printed in femin-  
ist and alternate media, they are  
never asked questions about their  
"feminist ethics?"

We believe that by this example of  
a mutually-agreed license of mass-  
market rights, both author and pub-  
lisher have proved to women that the  
feminist presses offer at least every  
advantage the boys can. We believe  
that there has not only been no “com-  
promise" on either our or Rita Mae's  
part but that on the contrary we have  
seized another level in the control  
of our own words.

Like The Season

Dear BMR,  
In response to your review of the  
BMR benefit, which appeared in the  
Oct. issue, I enjoyed doing the  
sound for the occasion, which I  
thought was a great success. I would  
also be happy to work with the women’s  
community in any upcoming events,  
benefits, or otherwise, but please -  
my name is spelled SUMMERS, like the  
month and season.

Subsistence

This Letter is a Response  

to our summary of a study done in  
Connecticut after the Connecticut Fem-  
inist Credit Union closed. Our summary  
said that the study "tends to support  
the fear that the feminist CU's will  
not be in a position to lend money to  
the women who need it most.

Big Mama Rag Vol. 5 No. 9

The Loans most likely to go de-  
linquent were from women living at sub-  
sistence levels.”

Dear BMR,

One thing I think you missed in your  
analysis which was otherwise pretty  
good - I don't think you distinguish  
subsistence loans from women living  
at subsistence level, and there is a  
huge difference. Example: (real one!)  
Woman earns $1200 a month, has ex-  
tremely high rent ($550) which she  
wants to borrow money to pay - that  
is a subsistence loan. Example: (real  
one!) - woman lives on welfare and in  
public (subsidized) housing - subsis-  
tence level. She wants to buy money  
for a washing machine. First loan is  
a dead certain delinquent. Second is  
a good loan if she has no other in-  
stallment payments. Conclusion: to  
say that subsistence loans are risk;  
is not the same as saying they are  
from women living at subsistence level.

Our experience at CFFCU (Connecticut)  
was that welfare women were extremely  
knowledgeable about money handling and  
were good risks. Poorest risks were  
women at $6-8,000 annual income levels  
who had to make many installment pay-  
ments and often had new cars. They  
are in the biggest bind of all - it  
doesn't sound poor but it still spends  
poor.
