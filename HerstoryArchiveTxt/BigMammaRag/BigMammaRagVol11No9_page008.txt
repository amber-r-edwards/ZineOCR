Home Eugenics

With all the transnational
companies getting into recom-
binant gene (gene splicing)
research it is only a matter
of time before we are “offered"
home eugenics test kits.
The first kit marketed for
home brewed babies, not sur-
prising selects out Y sperm.
Gametrics, Ltd markets the
kit for $65 for boy selection
in 42 countries including
the U.S. They hope to market
a kit that selects for girls
within 2 years. First we fem-
inists heralded amniocentesis
a procedure which sole use is
eugenic (the "improvement" of
the race) and now at BMR we
have seen gender selection
heralded the same way. The
only improvement in the "race"
that will benefit all of us
will be cultural and economic
change, not through genetic
manipulation.

U.S. Land Grab

The 10th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals ruled recently that
the Uncompahgre Indian Reser-
vation in Utah no longer ex-
ists and that much of the Uintah
Reservation is no longer
"Indian country". The court's
action came in a dispute be-
tween the Ute Tribe and the
state of Utah. The 2 reserva-
tions originally contained 4
million acres, the Uncompahgre
Reservation, created in
1882 contained 3,000 square
miles. The Uintah contained
3,186 square miles was creat-
ed when the government was
forcing the Utes of CO and
NM to settle on reservations.
The court claimed that Cong-
ress had withdrawn sections of
the Uintah and that the
Uncompahgre Reservation had
been disestablished by Con-
gress in 1895 and had been a
figment of everyone's imagin-
ation since.

Navy Attacked

On August 17, the Armed Re-
sistance Union attacked the
computer operations complex
at the Washington Navy Yard.
The computer complex is used
to train high-ranking offi-
cers at the Naval War College.
They simulate massive naval
battles, practicing how to
sacrifice the lives of mil-
lions--perhaps hundreds of
millions--for the interest
of the ruling class.

Reagan Regrets

The Reagan Administration's
"regret" over Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet's murderous
repression this month has not
prevented the two governments
from carrying out joint mili-
tary maneuvers off the Chilean
coast. Some 26 people, inclu-
ding three children, were kil-
led during the last national
day of protest against the U.S.
backed dictatorship, and more
than 100 people wounded and
more than 1,000 people jailed.

Big Business

"You're probably looking at
$2 billion a year for the next
20 years," said Matthew Fox
about the latest boom industry.
Fox and his partner, Bruce
Ream, a veteran prison archi-
tect and chairman-elect of
the American Institute of Ar-
chitects committee on correc-
tional architecture, think
they've got the product to
meet this staggering need:
low-cost, modular prisons con-
structed by their newly form-
ed firm Correctional Housing
Corp. Since mandatory senten-
cing and other legislative
changes began swelling the
prison populations in the late
1970s, at least 10 private
firms have entered the jail
and prison construction busi-
ness.

15 Years

In a blow to second trimes-
ter abortions an El Paso, TX
doctor was convicted of "mur-
dering" a fetus during a 1979
abortion. Dr. Raymond Showery
was convicted on the testimony
of 5 former Family Hospital
of El Paso employees for not
trying to save a 5 to 7 month
old fetus from an unidentified
woman. Showery claims that no
such abortion took place, and
in fact he was convicted even
though there was no corpse
(supposedly the corpse was
lost) and even though there
are no records of the abortion
having taken place. He was
sentenced to 15 years in pri-
son.

Anger Not Allowed

When nearly 1,000 angry peo-
ple turned out for a Congres-
sional hearing on police bru-
tality, New York mayor Ed Koch
and police officials cancelled
the meeting after only 20 min-
utes. But the people went on
to hold their own hearing any-
way, moving outside to a plaza
where person after person re-
ported their direct experien-
ces with racist abuse and in-
timidation.

"We've waited too long to
tell the Congressman this bru-
tality and terrorizing the
Black community has got to
stop," said one woman who was
to have testified but couldn't
get inside.

Cheese Rots

Between 12 and 24 tons of
government surplus cheese was
destroyed in September that
was to have been distributed
to families in southeastern
TX. The cheese, being held
by the relief agency, Programs
for Human Services, rotted in
an unrefrigerated warehouse.

Big Store Burned

In the early hours of July
29, an arsonist set fire to
the Toronto Women's Bookstore,
in an apparent attempt to des-
troy an abortion clinic loca-
ted above the store. Most of
the stock and fixtures in the
Bookstore were damaged by fire
and water. The Bookstore faces
the job of rebuilding. Money
can be sent to: Toronto Wo-
men's Bookstore, 296 Brunswick
Ave Suite 201, Toronto
M5S 2M7 Canada.

Cruel And Unusual

Washington State Prison has
devised a new punishment for
prisoners in segregation,
bread and water. A prisoner
can be placed on "nutrition
loaf" for any of 6 reasons,
which means any or no reason
without a hearing and at the
whim of segregation guards.
For the first “offense" a pri-
soner gets 5 days on the diet,
2nd "offense", 10 days, 3rd
"offense", 15 days but no long-
er than 15 days without 48
hours elapsing between each
time put on nutrient loaf. The
loaf has been described as
next to impossible to eat and
tasting like canned dog food
smells.

Women Jailed

In Alaska, if a battered
woman brings a charge of as-
sault against her husband and
later decides not to testify
against him she faces con-
tempt of court charges and
risks being thrown in jail
regardless of her reasons
for dropping the charge. On
CBS radio, an Alaska official
rationalized throwing women
in jail even when they decide
not to testify "for very good
reasons,” but said of the men
"We don't want to send these
guys to jail, we want to re-
habilitate them." At least
one Alaska woman has spent
the night in jail for this
charge.
