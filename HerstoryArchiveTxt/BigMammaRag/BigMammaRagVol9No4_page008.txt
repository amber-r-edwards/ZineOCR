Fighting Superstition And Exploitation

"Your union will split!
Your union will split!"

A woman, suddenly possessed,
screams out in the middle of
a crowded conference. The

women in India

goddess has spoken! For a mo-
ment there is a pause, but
then, the gathered partici-
pants recapture their mood of
anger and enthusiasm. As wo-
man after woman comes forward
to speak one central theme
emerges:

"We must stop giving girls
to Yelamma!"

The conference is one of
the Devadasis (literally,
"slaves of god"), women who
have been dedicated from the
time they were small girls
or babies to the service of
the goddess Yelamma. There-
after such women end up ser-
ving as divinely sanctioned
prostitutes.

The meeting is being held
in the small town of Nipani
on the Maharashtra-Karnataka
border. It is the biggest cen-
ter of tobacco production in
India and a central town in
the rural region from which
impoverished and superstition-
ridden low-caste families vow
their daughters to Yelamma.
They do so in the belief that
the goddess will protect the
family from disaster, insure
the birth of a son and stave
off illness.

The wrath of the goddess is
falling on the "union" because
it represents the newly organ-
ized workers of Nipani. The
members are almost all women,
who have played a major role
in organizing this conference,
itself part of a growing move-
ment to stop the Devadasi cus-
tom. These women, including
some 2400 workers employed in
making bidis (native cigar-
ettes) and another 5,000 in
the tobacco processing factor-
ies, are the main work force
of Nipani.

The town has a population of
about 45,000 and is a center
for growing tobacco that is
used for almost all the bidis
made in India. The organizing
efforts of these workers have
involved struggles against so-

cial as well as economic op-
pression from the beginning.

To walk through Nipani, into
the small huts where the bidis
are rolled or through factor-
ies choking with the fumes of
the pressed and sorted tobacco
leaves, is to realize how much
the tobacco profits are built
on women's labor. In the fac-
tories especially, the condi-
tions seem those of early in-
dustrialization: women working
from 9 am to midnight or later
with only minimal breaks,
forced to return home often to
villages three or four miles
away at 2 am only to cook,
sleep and rise again at 6 or
7 am the following morning.

There are no face masks to
protect these women from the
deadening tobacco particles
in the air, no way to enforce
the meager legal protection

that exists, no recourse from
the petty tyranny and sexual
harassment of the bosses.

These were the conditions,
at any rate, before they be-
gan to unionize. The bidi wor-
kers have had a union for
about four years, but it was
only in March 1980 that they
went on strike spontaneously
when women in one factory were
turned away after coming back
a few minutes late from their
lunch break.

All the workers walked out,
then late at night met women
coming home after the night
shift. On the second day 80
factories in Nipani were
closed and some 7000 women
were out on the streets.

A contract stipulating an
8-hour work day at five rupees
(65¢, about what they had been
earning before for 12-16
hours), no victimization and
three days strike pay was
quickly won. But, though the
workers returned jubilantly to
work, they found their prob-
lems were far from solved.

First, the constantly rising
prices began to wipe out their
wage gains, with the result

for the owner to come back
and close his factory," rela-
ted Subhash Joshi, a union
organizer. "He stayed away
until Nov. 13 and then came
with a hundred police. The
women accosted him as he came
out of the factory, and the
police charged and beat them.
"As the women fell," the ac-
tivist continued, "the police
simply grabbed the owner and
put him in their jeep. But
the women were so furious that
they chased the jeep all the
way to the police station
and there they were teargassed. They dispersed, but
while they were trying to wash
the gas out of their eyes the
police charged again."

The result was that several
women were hospitalized, the

union activists and several
workers were arrested and

there were three days of riot-
ing, stone-throwing and bus-
burning in Nipani before a
"peace committee" finally
brought things under control.
Even today, three months la-
ter, the workers are still in
a state of anger: "The police
take the owners' side. We org-

anize - they charge us. The
goondas beat us up - the pol-
ice leave the goondas alone!"

Little has changed in the
working conditions and there
have not even been many wage
gains. The workers, however,
have become aware of the
strength of the union and the
fact that it has nearly put
an end to sexual harassment -
the hitherto accepted right
of the bosses to demand "fa-
vors" from women. This is one
of their major achievements.

Another part of the strug-
gle against sexual exploita-
tion has been the fight against
the Devadasi custom. The
whole area of northern Karna-
taka and southern Maharashtra
is filled with impoverished
low-caste rural families who
dedicate their daughters.

The girls so promised are
considered sacred to the god-
dess; they are forbidden to
cut or comb their hair which
grows into a long, thick and
dirty mat; and they are sup-
posed to be sexually avail-
able to any man who asks.

Not all such women become
prostitutes; most try to lead
relatively normal lives and
often fall into prostitution
for the same reason as any
woman: economic hardship. Nev-
ertheless the sociologist
S.D. Punekar estimated that
there were 12-13,000 women
from north Karnataka alone
working as prostitutes in Bom-
bay.

Devadasis are not only to
be seen constantly on the
streets of Nipani; many are
working in the tobacco fac-
tories as well. It was thus
in a way natural for the union
to become concerned with this
issue. More important, the
union itself grew out of
social struggles. In 1973 a
group of Balit Panthers,
the militant organization of
ex-untouchables, was formed
in Nipani and these and many
socialist allies began to
work in nearby villages in
the "one-village-one-well"
campaign which was directed
at giving low castes the
right to use the village well.

It was young activists from
this movement who turned to
organizing the tobacco indus-
try. Some then became invol-
ved in the first attempt
in recent times to organize
