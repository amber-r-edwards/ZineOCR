Defense Funds Running Out

Joan Little Goes to Trial

Linda Fowler

The murder trial of Joan Little

began July 14 in Wake County.

Superior Court, Raleigh, North
Carolina. The 21-year-old black
woman faces a mandatory death
sentence if convicted of the
murder of Clarence Alligood, a
white farmer, age 62, who
worked as night jailer in the
Beaufort County Jail at
Washington, N.C.

Ms. Little, who was being held
in the jail pending appeal of a
breaking and entering conviction,
says Alligood tried to rape
her in her cell on August 27,
1974. She says she killed him in
self-defense, then fled.

Since her surrender eight
days later, her case has become
one of concern for civil rights,
women’s, and prison reform
groups. One issue of the case is
the situation of women
prisoners in the Beaufort County
Jail. Female inmates there,
where there are no women
jailers, are subject to 24-hour
scrutiny via closed circuit televi-
sion, focused on them even
when they are using the toilet.

Damage Suit Filed

In connection with this, a $1
million dollar class action civil
suit has been filed by Little’s
lawyer, Jerry Paul, and the
Southern Poverty Law Center of
Montgomery, Alabama, which is
aiding in Little's defense. The
suit is on behalf of the women
prisoners in the Beaufort County
Jail. The suit charges women
inmates “are confined in such a
manner that male trustees,
jailers, and other male persons
given free run of the jail expose
their genitalia . . . and make
vulgar and obscene remarks and
gestures against the will and
beyond the control of the female
inmates.” It also contends that
bail bondsmen are allowed into
the women’s cells to conduct
business and, at times, make

“lewd and vulgar sexual
propositions” to the women
prisoners. The suit names

Alligood’s estate and Beaufort
County Sheriff Jack Harris as
respondents. —

White-Washing the Jury

From the start of the jury
selection process, prosecution
attorneys have made their
positions evident by using

peremptory challenges to
systematically exclude blacks,
an action which has angered
Paul and other defense lawyers.
It caused the first clash between
Paul and prosecution attorney
Lester Chalmers, who once
represented the Ku Klux Klan
before a congressional in-
vestigating committee. When
Paul asked that the record show
the state was attempting to
exclude blacks from the jury,
Chalmers objected. Paul shot
back, “I would expect the Klan to
object to that statement.”

Paul has also charged Judge
Hamilton H. Hobgood with seek-
ing to limit defense questioning
of prospective jurors because,
Paul says, Hobgood favors the
state. Paul told the judge, “I think
you should excuse yourself. I
don't think you are capable of
giving Joan Little a fair trial.”

Judge Hobgood, with 26 years
on the bench, was appointed to
the case by N.C. Supreme Court
Chief Justice Susan Sharp. He
has a reputation for being fair, as
stated by both prosecution and
defense, but was not the judge
the defense wanted.

As the trial opens in Court-
room No. 1, observers will be
subject to scanning by metal
detection devices before enter-
ing. Guards are posted at each
door and Joan Little has retained
her own bodyguard for the
duration of the trial.

Proving the Case

The prosecution, led by
William C. Griffin, Jr., district
attorney, is expected to attempt
to prove the killing was part of a
jail-break plot; that Ms. Little

lured Alligood into her cell, then

killed him with an ice pick she
had taken from the desk drawer
of the jail earlier in the evening
when she had been let out of her
cell to make a phone call.

In connection with this, a 16
year old trustee of the Beaufort
County jail, Terry Bell, said
earlier that, after the killing, he
had helped Little to rearrange
the cell to look like self-defense.

Bell, however, failed two
polygraph (lie-detector) tests
administered by the State

Bureau of Investigation and later
recanted his story.

Coalition

The recently formed Colorado
Coalition of Women and the
Criminal Justice System met
July 8th to clarify its goals.
Composed of women from the
Minorities Women’s Task Force,
the N.O.W. Prison Task Force,
The National Center for State
Courts, Employ-Ex, and the
Justice Office West of the Un-
itarian Universalist Service
Committee among others, the
coalition brings together a diver-
sity of women who are all in
some way concerned with the
plight of women in the criminal
justice system.

Outstanding among the goals
of the coalition is the eventual
abolition of women’s jails and
the women’s prison. These
would be replaced by community
based programs which would
serve the psychological, social
and economic needs of women
offenders. The coalition opposes
taking action which seeks to
improve the women’s prison by
bringing rehabilitative programs
into it, since this would
strengthen the reasons or ex-
cuses for keeping it open. Im-
provement or initiation of
programs will be limited to those
whose primary effect is to em-
power prisoners to participate in
the struggle to return to their
own communities. Access to a
law library is an example of that
type of improvement.

Community facilities which
can deal with women prisoners
do exist, but there is a need for
more. Until the Colorado
Legislature is pressured to ap-
propriate funds, little can be
done to enlarge community
facilities (a new federal law
states that all federal prisoners
must spend the last two months
of incarceration in community
treatment centers).

Some Basic Assumptions

The coalition contends that
women have consistently been
denied equal protection of the
law, due process, right to self-
determination and personal
privacy, i.e., mail confiscation.
They cite the report from The
Colorado Advisory Committee to
the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights, September 1974, which
declared, “Women inmates,
both state and federal, are
deprived of meaningful
rehabilitation programs.” Accor-
ding to the coalition, “Until
January of this year, women
were categorically excluded

Prosecution attorney Griffin
said he did not know whether
the state would call Bell as a
witness, but Paul feels the state
will be forced to, as Bell was
apparently the only witness who
could prove Little was let out of
the cell to make a phone call.
Paul said parts of Bell’s state-
ment could only indicate he was
watching the incident.

There is some speculation the
prosecution may move to have
the charge reduced to second
degree murder or even
manslaughter, either of which
would be easier to prove as
neither charge carries the death
sentence.

Defense Strategy

In an early move during the
jury selection process the
defense has sought to have
special prosecutor John Wilkin-
son removed from the case.
Wilkinson, who has been retained
by the Alligood estate, has
previously represented Little in
two shoplifting cases in which
she was acquitted. She had

asked him to represent her in the

breaking and entering case. He
declined, but only after she had
talked with him in detail
about the case. The defense
claims a conflict of interest
in the case.

The defense is expected to use
as evidence the polygraph tests
administered to Little, which she
passed, and the testimony of
other female prisoners in the jail
who say they have been
molested or raped while being
held in Beaufort County.

Defense attorneys have only
recently been granted access to
the physical evidence in the
case, the ice pick and Alligood’s
clothing. This, and other
evidence, has been ill cared for
by the state and kept from Little’s
attorneys.

Demonstrations in Support

Little, who has been free on
$115,000 bond since February
26, has received much support
locally in the form of prayer
vigils, demonstrations outside
the courthouse, and marches in
Raleigh and other cities. A judge
has ordered there be no
demonstrating or leafleting dur-

ing the trial, but this ruling is
being appealed.

The defense fund currently
has less than $1,000 remaining
in its coffers. Contributions are
desperately needed to continue
research and defense efforts.

Joan Little Defense Fund, Inc.,

In an unrelated event regard-
ing prison conditions for
women in North Carolina, in-
mates at the Women’s Prison
demonstrated against
dangerous medical conditions
and practices prevalent at the
prison. The protest was a “spon-
taneous” response that grew
out of conditions that prison
officials were aware of, accord-
ing to Anne Willette, a woman
the state identifies as the
“ringleader” of the riot.

Willette and other women
inmates testified before the
North Carolina Grievance Com-
mission on the causes of the
disturbance and conditions at
the prison. Testimony included
the assigning of women who
have seizures to kitchen work
with sharp instruments where
they may harm themselves; the
burning of a woman’s face when
the nurse administered the
wrong medicine; allowing an
inmate who was assigned to the
prison’s infirmary for a short
time to administer pelvic exams
even though she had never had
any medical training. A woman
suffered from internal bleeding
following one of the “ex-
aminations” but was told by the
nurse to lift her legs to stop the
bleeding.

The women who were the
“leaders” of the disruption have
been removed from the general
prison population to another
state prison facility.

Denver Support of Joanne
Little was expressed by a fun-
draising rally held Saturday, July
12th and a picket at the Federal
Center on the 14th.

Groups sponsoring the event
included Big Mama Rag, N.O.W.
Prison Task Force, Students
Against Racism, National
Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People, High
Street Community Center, and
several members of the state
house of representatives.

Approximately 100 members
of the Black, Chicano, women’s,
and gay communities donated
over $150.00 to the Joanne
Little defense fund.

only shackled in transport to the
hospital, but they were shackled
to their beds as well. Men, on the
other hand, have not been
shackled to their beds, except in
cases where a dangerous
prisoner made such action
necessary. The order to shackle
women to their beds was made
by May Gillespie, Warden of the
Women’s Prison. A writing cam-
paign to ask for the immediate
dismissal of May Gillespie is in
progress (see address below).

Differences

At the last coalition meeting, a
member said, “We don't want to
come on radical.” She added,
“Words like sexism and racism
create a negative reaction and
alienate other groups.”

Another member replied to
her remark by saying, “Those
words are why I'm here.”

Do members of the coalition
agree that crimes committed by
women generally have
economic causes? This is an
important question because
disagreement implies very
different political perspectives.
From the opinions that were
expressed at the meeting, it
appears the coalition agrees that
