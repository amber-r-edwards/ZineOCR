Battle With Courts Enters Seventh Year

Yvonne Wanrow Faces Retrial

Vicki Piotter

"It's a mockery, what they are
doing to me is a mockery. From the
very beginning I have said I am not
guilty of a crime and I still say
it today. Every one of us is open to
this sort of prosecution. If it
doesn't happen to you, it could hap-
pen to your sister, your child, or
someone close to you, and I don't
want to see that happen. I resist.”

-Yvonne Wanrow, Feb 1979

The issue of whether a woman has
the right to defend herself against
violent attack will again be in the
court, as Spokane, Washington prose-
cutors Donald Brockett and Fred
Caruso announced their plans to
force Yvonne Wanrow to stand trial
a second time this spring on charges
of first degree assault and felony
murder.

On August 12, 1972 Yvonne Wanrow,
a Colville Indian and single mother,
shot and killed William Wesler, and
wounded his companion, David Kelly,
in an attempt to protect herself and
her children from physical assault.
The six and a half years that have
followed that morning she was forced
to defend herself against violence,
Wanrow has been fighting a legal
assault headed by prosecutors Caruso
and Brockett, which could lead to
her imprisonment for a possible 25
years.

According to Wanrow, "The violence
began long before I defended myself
and my children with a gun early
that morning on August 12, 1972. It
began when my babysitter's seven
year old daughter, Mildred, was
raped and given VD by William Wes-
ler." On Friday, the day before the
shooting incident, Wesler, a 62 year
old white neighbor, had threatened
Wanrow's nine year old son and Shir-
ley Hooper's young daughter. Mildred
Hooper identified Wesler as the man
who had molested her months earlier.

After Wesler came to her house on
August 11, Shirley Hooper requested
protection from the police and asked
for Wesler’s arrest, who had a previ-
ous record of child molesting. The
Spokane police responded with, "we
can't do anything until Monday."

Wanrow and Hooper, still fearing
Wesler's threats on the children,
stayed together that night and did
not go to sleep. At 5 am, the morn-
ing of August 12, Wesler barged through
Hooper's door and went towards Wan-
row's 3 year old nephew and then
turned on her. “In fear, I pulled
the trigger." In the panicked situa-
tion, Wanrow also shot David Kelly
who had entered the house with
Wesler.

Yvonne Wanrow immediately called
the police and told them what had
happened. Without her knowledge, the
police recorded the conversation.

Wanrow was arrested and Spokane
Prosecutor Donald Brockett charged
her with felony murder and first
degree assault, although he had the
option not to press charges or to
press lesser charges.

She was brought to trial in Spo-
kane in 1973 and on Mother's Day of
that year was convicted as charged
by an all-white jury. Later, Wanrow
was sentenced to two twenty year
terms, plus a mandatory five year
sentence for the use of a deadly
weapon, a gun.

to have sexual intercourse." The
“flimsy dress of the victim" and her
actions toward the defendant prior to
the rape were “a good indication"
that the act was performed “with her
consent," he stated.

Salt Lake County Deputy Attorney
Patricia Marlow, who prosecuted the
case, said she was “personally offended
by the remarks of the judge in the
courtroom. As a woman, it was an
affront to me.”

"The judge said 'no woman could
further tempt a man to rape her than
the victim’ and I find that inexcus-
able," Ms. Marlow said.

In referring to the victim, Judge
Croft said, "she's no virgin and
she's no teenager."

Salt Lake County Attorney R. Paul
Van Dam called Croft's ruling "inex-
cusable" and said a recall action to
remove him would be “appropriate.”
He said, “I think Judge Croft has
substituted his personal opinion of
fact and his personal standards of
morality and woman's place in the
scheme of things for the judgment of
the jury. In my opinion, that is an
excessive and improper act by a
judge."

Referring to the use of the statute
enabling Judge Croft to arrest the
jury's verdict, Mr. Van Dam said he
has witnessed the use of the statute
“three times in 12 years as a pro-
secutor."

At the time of the incident, Myers
was on parole from Utah State Prison
on a conviction of forgery in 1972.
He is currently incarcerated at the
prison where he awaits a parole vio-
lation hearing.

The tape recording of Wanrow's
initial call to the police was used
as evidence in her trial and played
a major role in her conviction; the
jury apparently believed the prose-
cution's argument that Wanrow did
not sound “hysterical” enough on
the tape to be innocent.

"When I was in jail I would wonder
what are people out there doing for
me, can't somebody help me. It's the
same way now. Even though I'm not in
prison, it’s like I'm chained to the
court system and I have to be avail-
able whenever they dictate to me. I
am not free and I know that's the
way it is for everybody else. Each
and every one of us are imprisoned
because of the cruelty they hand
down to us."

Yvonne Wanrow told me she was not
surprised by her conviction. Her
trial was held in an area known for
its persecution of its Native Ameri-
can population; the fact that she
was a woman with a gun directly
challenged society's tolerance for
male violence against women and its
lack of support for women who have
faced assault, particularly third
world women; in addition, her trial
was in process when the government
launched its attack on the Wounded
Knee reservation in South Dakota,
increasing the racial tensions in
the courtroom.

Lawyers for Yvonne Wanrow appealed
her conviction to the Spokane Court
of Appeals. The Court of Appeals
ruled in her favor saying that the
trial court judge had tried her un-
fairly for allowing the prosecution
to use the police tape as evidence
against her, in violation of a Wash-
ington State statute prohibiting
such use.

The prosecution, showing its in-
tent to keep Wanrow behind bars,
appealed that decision to the Wash-
ington State Supreme Court. On Jan-
uary 7, 1977 the Washington State
Supreme Court said that Yvonne Wan-
row had, indeed, been tried unfair-
ly, not only because the tape record-
ing had been admitted illegally, but
that the judge's instructions to the
jury were improper—the judge failed
to instruct the jury to consider
Wanrow's actions from her perspec-
tive as a woman under attack from a
man.

The Court opinion in what has since
come to be known as a landmark ruling
in the struggle for women's rights.

Conviction of Rape

Representatives of several Utah
women's groups have joined together
to protest Judge Croft's decision.
Spokesperson Eileen Hansen denounced
his behavior as “obviously sexist
and racist as well." "To think that
a judge, anywhere, could turn his
back on our system of justice and
throw out a jury's carefully con-
ceived verdict, substituting his own
version of morality, is inexcusable
and presumptuous." "In the judge's
words, ‘She sits in a bar with a
Black man in that flimsy dress, tak-
ing his affection, eating his food,
drinking his drinks. There is a whole
lot to be said here about mutual con-
sent.'" "Mutual consent for what? For
eating and drinking, not for rape,"
stated Ms. Hansen. "The judge is
saying white women ought to expect
black men to rape them and that they
wear ‘flimsy’ dresses so they can be
raped."

Ms. Hansen also stated, "This woman
was a victim of the kind of violence
perpetrated on women all over the
world. She was the victim, but Judge
Croft has made her into the instiga-
tor and the rapist the victim. A
judge in Madison, Wisconsin tried
this same outrageous trick, and he
lost his judgeship for it, when women
all over the country rose up and
cried 'foul.' We women in Utah do not
intend any less of an outcry over
this judge and this case."

There is no recall provision in the
state of Utah, but a coalition of
women's groups is meeting to strate-
gize further action.
