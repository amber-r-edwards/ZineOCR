**Woman To Woman Celebrates Bravery and Horror In the**

**Successful First Year**

On August 14, Woman to Woman Feminist Center celebrated her first birthday with an open house attended by 150 women. Over the past year, Woman to Woman has provided the Denver community with the most complete stock of feminist books, newspapers, and records in the city. Classes (through the Woman to Woman School) and special events have focused on everything from karate to feminist science fiction, from union organizing to auto-repairing. The telephone line has answered questions for over 2,000 women in its first year of operation.

The center library is currently being renovated so that books may be checked out and more and more women's groups are using the center for meeting space. Several political actions (remember the "Bare Tit" coffee house and International Women's Day?) have already been spawned in the recesses of the center basement.

Over 100 women have been active in the Center since it opened. Like projects in other cities that are open to a broad range of women with a variety of goals, the Center has had its problems establishing an "identity." What constitutes a “feminist" Center? Is it for all women?

Is it for beginning feminists? Is it a "dyke" center? Is it a political, educational, or cultural center?

The mechanics of organizing a center also present problems: How can we structure the center so that it will allow each woman to work in the area she wants? How can we ensure broad community input? How many meetings can any feminist activist stand?

For the past six months the Center has been holding Sunday night community meetings (usually around 5 pm) to define the common goals of the center and develop a structure which will work toward achieving those goals.

The tentative points of unity for projects and individuals working in the Center are:

1. We see the center as a woman's space, maintained by and for women. We see women as the priority.

2. We recognize that women's oppression cuts across all class, race, and cultural lines. The center must reach out to women coming from all different backgrounds and situations. It is imperative for women who work in the center to actively struggle with our own classism, racism, and sexism, using the tool of criticism/self-criticism in this struggle. We realize that we are all still in the process of conquering our own prejudices—we commit ourselves to that struggle.

3. We recognize that women are oppressed as a group and that freedom for women can only be won if all women fight together, as well as individually, to end our oppression. Only through collective effort can revolution be achieved.

4. Actively promoting male-identified religion, politics, psychology, etc. is in conflict with the center's goals.

5. We do not view the center, itself, as a “solution" but as a place where we can develop the kind of political activism necessary to fight sexism.

6. The center has an obligation to avoid isolation and to maintain contact and relations with other feminist projects.

7. We view the center as a political project not as a business, and will not sacrifice our basic principles for profit.

For further clarification of these goals or more information on the next community meeting, call the Center at 320-5972.

**Health Clinic Coalition Forms In Order to Fight Harassment**

Linda Rechter

Women throughout the country have been taking their health into their own hands by operating self-help and abortion clinics independent of the patriarchal medical establishment but not without harassment.

A new and vital organization called WATCH (Women Acting Together To Combat Harassment) was formed on April 4, 1976, at the Southeastern Women's Health Conference in Gainesville, Florida. Its goals are to fight harassment of any kind, be it a medical monopoly trying to shut down a clinic, clinic licensing agencies withholding licenses because a clinic is woman-controlled, or a local surgical supply company refusing to sell women speculums.

With the start of a $1,000 donation, the new organization urges women to share their clinic's profits as well as harassment experiences with WATCH, which could then finance and advise troubled clinics. With a stronghold of tactics backed by financial support, WATCH would strive to be in touch with health clinics throughout the nation and ultimately the world.

The problems particular clinics have run into have ranged from malpractice suits to a zoning hassle of endless duration. The most recent and outrageous example of the injustice being done to women’s clinics is that of the Feminist Women's Health Center in Tallahassee, Florida.

The local newspaper there published an article showing that the abortion fees of the FWHC were lower than those of the private physicians. This instigated discussion of the FWHC by local Ob/Gyns in a closed meeting. At this time, two FWHC physicians quit. In trying to replace them, the Tallahassee women appealed to the Board of Medical Examiners, who would not let them attend their meetings or obtain meeting notes. They then approached the Capital Medical Society, only to be told by the Executive Secretary, "I doubt seriously that the Medical Society would be interested in your problems."

A few resident doctors finally agreed to work for the FWHC one day per week and several back-up physicians were also secured. The FWHC then received a letter from the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the local hospital stating that the hospital did not approve of the residents working in the clinic because, according to them, there were not back-up doctors. The Executive Director of the State Board of Medical Examiners, George Palmer, also advised one of the doctors that, "You shouldn't work for that group in Tallahassee - they're just a bunch of little girls."

The residents quit the next day. The FWHC of Tallahassee has filed a federal anti-trust suit against the Ob/Gyns and George Palmer, who claimed their actions sprung from a complaint that illegal abortions were being performed at the FWHC clinic.

The FWHC has continually stressed that it is not practicing medicine without a license, but is a health education agency that does preventative work. "We do not do treatment per se," they confirm, "When we do find a dysfunction, then that is dealt with under medical supervision."

The FWHC has made the charge of attempting to restrain trade and monopolize women's health care in Tallahassee. They are seeking $100,000 in damages. As it stands now, the trial is being delayed 3 months, much to the inconvenience of the FWHC.

Other clinics have run into similar situations tinged with anti-woman bias. Clinic licensing and regulations have been used to price woman-controlled, non-profit clinics right out of business. Clinics are denied tax-exempt status because they are self-help oriented.

The unification of women's clinics through WATCH would cer

**Lives of Indian Women**

Theresa Schook

News of the American Indian Movement grows more alarming with each press release. Every month, there is a new instance of governmental atrocity performed against the Indian nations. Mostly, the stories involve the men who are active and "leaders" in the radical Indian movement. However, the real bravery and horror comes from the lives of the Native American women who fight for their rights.

KaMook Banks, a 21-year-old Oglala Lakota from the infamous Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota, has been arrested several times in connection with the alleged activities of her husband, Dennis Banks. In September 1975, a car in which she and several others were traveling through Kansas inexplicably exploded, severely burning many. At that time, she was arrested by Wichita police and charged with possession of firearms and explosives.

KaMook was six months pregnant at that time. She put up a $7,500 bond and was released. Her attorney neglected to tell her about some important facts of her case; for example, that under the terms of her bail, she could not leave the Kansas-Nebraska area. She has since dismissed this attorney, who seems to have had close connections with federal authorities in the area. Her new attorney is a woman, Margie Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Law in New York.

Two months after the September incident, KaMook was again arrested, this time in Oregon. Three other American Indian Movement (AIM) members were also arrested. The charge was once again possession of firearms and explosives. The four were driving in a trailer that was stopped by police who had been given a "tip" from FBI locals that the trailer was hiding Dennis Banks and Leonard Peltier, AIM founders. Now 8 months pregnant, KaMook and Anna Mae Aquash ran and hid in the dark together as state trooper bullets spun over their heads.

One week later, both women were extradited from Oregon—KaMook to South Dakota, Anna Mae to Kansas. KaMook's $7,500 bail was revoked and she spent much time in the Wichita jails. While in jail, she gave birth by cesarean section to a girl, named Ta Tiopa Maza Win, Lakota for “Iron Door Woman." Jails are hardly the best places in which to give birth. Banks' stitches became infected and little was done about it.

She was threatened with the loss of her child to the courts, but her sister came and took the child back to its Indian family. Her bail in Wichita was set after the birth of the child at $20,000. The money was finally raised after AIM fundraising efforts and she was released only to face arraignment in Oregon. In May, Judge Robert Belloni of the U.S. District Court dismissed all charges against KaMook Banks and her co-defendants "with prejudice," which means that they cannot be brought to court on the same charges for the same incident again.

KaMook Banks now awaits charges in Kansas. Her Defense Fund still needs money. To send them contributions, write to KaMook Banks—Offense/Defense Committee, 3435 SW Hood, Portland, OR 97207.

Anna Mae Aquash was not so lucky in her dealings with the government. On February 24, 1976, her body was found, beaten and badly decomposed in South Dakota. She was buried by federal authorities, who announced that she had died of exposure. Aquash's family had the body exhumed and examined by an independent pathologist who discovered that she had died from a bullet in her brain that had entered from the back of her head.

So far, there has been no investigation of her murder and no charges have been brought against anyone. Aquash was National Secretary of AIM.

Other women who have been murdered inexplicably are Delphine Crow Dog and Jancita Eagle Deer. Crow Dog was a resident of the Pine Ridge reservation when she was found in December of 1972. She had been beaten by Bureau of Indian Affairs thugs and left to die on the prairie. She froze to death.

Eagle Deer had been raped by now Attorney General of South Dakota, William Janklow, when she was fifteen. Seven years later, in April 1975, she was killed by a hit-and-run driver. Autopsy showed that she had been hit over the head and had multiple fractures in her neck and skull. Once again, there was no investigation beyond the ascertainment of her death. These women are but a few of some 250 Native American men and women who have died in unexplained "accidents."

Eight women box makers have been on strike against Rice Paper Box Company, 530 Acoma Street, since the middle of June. As of this writing, the strike is entering its 11th week. The women decided to walk off after the company refused to negotiate on their request for a pension plan and an increase to their wage of $3.04 per hour. Rice Paper told the women the only way they could come back to work would be through preferential rehiring. The company is currently employing scab labor. The women feel lack of support from their union, the Paper Products and Paper Specialties Union, which let their contract expire with Rice before starting renegotiations. The strikers are expecting something to break within the next two weeks. RMR will bring a detailed account of the strike next month, in the wake of expected changes.
