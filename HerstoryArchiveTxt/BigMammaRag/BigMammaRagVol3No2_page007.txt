VICTIM

From Page 1

officer in charge was “well, for every
victim who thinks that I don’t treat
her well, there are 5 who think that I
do.”

The next day when I went downtown
to do a composite drawing of the
rapist, the man who I worked with on
the drawing said, after a few minutes
of work, “You're not so bad.” It seems
that the rumor had been circulated
that a real man-hater (me) was coming
down that day. When I was describing
the man, they kept trying to talk me
into describing him as being a
Chicano. They practically told me that
it was a Chicano because the area I
lived in is near a Chicano neighbor-
hood.

The men at work didn't know how to
approach the fact that I had been
raped. Typical comments were: “did
you enjoy it?” “could you get off on
it?” There weren’t any visible signs of
what happened to me because I wasn't
beaten up. It was very shattering in a
middle-class way. This great tragedy
had happened inside me and some
people were so intolerant of what was
happening to me. Their attitude was
“sure you should be angry but get a
hold of yourself.”

My mom was so upset but she tried
not to show it. First she cried all the
time. She didn’t tell any of her friends.
She didn’t talk to me for two weeks.
She thought of me as a soiled,
shameful thing. Then one night I
called her and told her that I was not
guilty, that the rape had nothing to do
with sex. It is violence. I am not
promiscuous, mother. It’s a good
thing that I had a good sense of my
own sexuality. The attack reinforced
things for me. It made my feminism

) in’ at to ‘say sitter but,
he didn’t ask questions. He was just
there. He was my friend. Very
supportive. He boarded up the
basement window that the rapist
broke in through. The guy would never
have gotten on the first floor of the
house if the latch to the basement
door had been hooked. A friend had
been moving stuff into the basement
that day and had forgotten to latch it.

Friends got on me as to why I wasn’t
going out with men. The police felt
that the attack made me hate men. I
don’t hate men. I hate the male
system.

I see that rape is not a sexual crime.
It is a violent, aggressive, intimidating
crime. Sex is the way it is expressed.

Rapist Returns

About two weeks after the attack I
got home late with a friend. We went
in the house through the back door
and discovered that someone was
trying to get in through the front door.
It was the rapist. He had come back.
He ran down the street. We called the
police and five rookies showed up.
There were footprints in the snow and
fingerprints on the door, but they
didn’t take any of them. They didn’t
even fingerprint the first time he broke

a woman reported that a guy by the
same description had attempted to
attack her in a parking lot. She
scared him off and saw him disappear
into an alley. A car emerged with him in
it. She told police but I don’t know if
anything was done about attempting
to locate the car.

Then one rainy day I was driving
down Colfax when I saw him walking
on the street. I recognized him
immediately. I followed him and
reached up to clear my windshield of
fog when I accidentally hit the horn.
He saw me and ran into a house. I
called police and was criticized for not
having called earlier. But I didn't think
that they would get there on time and
he would have been gone. The car that
the other woman reported seeing him
in was parked in front of the house. He
lived within two blocks of me.

The police came to my house with
pictures of him which I identified. He
was arrested. I didn’t hear anything for
weeks. Then I was subpoenaed to be a
witness. I didn’t know why I was being
called since there was no explanation
of what I was appearing for.

The guy had attacked 15 women in a
6 block radius in 18 months. It
seems, he had been abused as a child.
Strapped to a bed when he was 5. A
loner - he had indecently exposed
himself 60 or 70 times. He had normal
sexual relations with other women. He
was a normal guy, just quiet and
withdrawn.

Two days before the preliminary
hearing I got a call from the District
Attorney’s office. They came with a
paralegal to get my story.

I wanted to know exactly what might
happen in the trial and what the
alternatives were for the defendant. A
woman lawyer kindly gave me an hour
of her time and explained what
penalties he might face if he was
found guilty. If he were found
innocent he would be free. If he were
found guilty he could be sent to Buena
Vista or to Canon City for 5 to 40
years, and could be paroled in as little
as a year. If he were sentenced under
the Sex Offenders Act, which was
established for the mentally or
criminally ill, he could be sentenced
for 1 day to life.

The Trial

His attorney was an older man and
the defendant put on the innocent
routine. He was charged with rape
seven times, breaking and entering
and deviant sexual intercourse. He
was such a scrawny little kid in the
courtroom. He seemed so big and
brutal that night.

He pleaded not guilty by reason of
insanity and was sent to the State
Hospital at Pueblo for examination.
He admitted that he went around the
neighborhood early in the evening to
look in windows and see who would
be home alone. Most rapes are
planned and this guy is no exception.
He would rape a woman at 6:30 in the
evening and then another at 8:00 the
next morning.

There are two definitions of insanity
- Criminal and mental. The criminally
insane don’t know the difference
between right and wrong or are driven
by a force that they can’t control. The
rapist wasn’t found criminally insane.
He was found sane and the D.A. office
plea bargained - they figured, or so I
was told, that if he pleaded guilty he
could have been sentenced to Buena
Vista (since he was 18) and been

released in 24 months, which is what
often happens up there. So they
plea-bargained with him by agreeing
to drop some charges so he would
plead guilty to the rest and be
sentenced under the Sexual Offenders
Act which put him in Pueblo for a
while. It is possible that he would be
released in 6 months but not probable.
If he got out that soon the D.A. would
challenge the release but it’s not done.

is nothing preventative in this state.
It’s all after the fact. He should have

he’s put away for a while.

Kicking

To Block A Kick Or Punch
There is only one thing to remember in
doing a block, your third essential
technique. Sweep. The sweep ensures
that you will catch the blow (with your
arm instead of your body) no matter
what stage it’s in. In other words,
striking directly out at an incoming
fist will most likely result in a miss for
you and contact for him. But if you
sweep over the general area he’s
aiming for, you'll deflect the blow.
And if you do it firmly enough, you'll
hurt his arm as well as surprise him.

Heel of Palm Blow — flex your wrist,
stretch fingers back, tuck thumb in
(always do this; so that you don’t
accidentally catch your thumb on
something). Striking surface is that
nice strong bone called the heel of the
palm. Hit him under the chin, hard, or
on the end of his nose, a blow which
can be fatal if delivered with enough
force.
