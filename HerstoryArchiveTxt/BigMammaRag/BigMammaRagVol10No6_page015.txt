Disguise Reality At All Costs -- Create Confusion

I read your paper today and
wanted to write you an arti-
cle knowing I couldn't.

For years in prison, con-
sidered a radical, being a
lesbian, & having escaped,

I would write articles out

letter

of rage. Rage from prison
injustice - rage of solitary
confinement & harassment -
page after page - that never
reached you - never reached
anyone. 
Now I sit in my cell, my
lover of 4 yrs sitting in
her cell in another security
unit, separated out of cruel-
ty, and I cannot write pages
of my outrage - I can only
sit vaguely aware my face is
wet, my teeth are clenched
and my words are gone.

I've filed writs & civil
suits that disappear. We've
both filed writs & civil
suits that disappeared -
letters that never leave,
poems that are thrown away.

We've puked inside prison
walls, mental wards, indecent
isolation cells, jails, juve-
nile halls and still cannot
digest the reasoning behind
each's facade of treatment,
rehabilitation & punishment.

All I can tell you now is
we will always fight as we
always have - but no one can
do it alone - all women, all
prisoners must join together
- educate each other and
puke - puke all their embed-
ded injustices & ideals out!

When She Was Good

from page 19

she couldn't hack it, she
didn't know to do it and she
failed so everyone thought
she should get out of Sara-
sota. She started working as
a psychiatric nurse and she
had a hard time getting a
job. She had to have a lot

of strings pulled for her
because the reason she lost
her job at the county health
department was because

she had stolen some drugs.
It was typical how she got
ratted on because she had a
boyfriend from the VA hos-
pital. She had been in the
Army, so she could go to the
VA hospital for free, so
that's where she started go-
ing when she couldn't afford
her hospital bills anymore.
She would go there for lit-
tle bits of time even when
she was holding her job and
she would meet men who were
pretty skid row and she had
a lot of skid row boyfriends.
and they were pretty mean.
Once she had a fight with
one of them and he destroyed
all her clothes --and she
had tons and tons of clothes.
She was one of these women
who had 20 pairs of shoes
with handbags to match, and
he had destroyed them all
when she was away and he
called the health department
and said she had stolen

those drugs. And he even
called my father and said

"Your wife is a sleaze,
youngest daughter is a
sleaze", he told him I was

a lesbian and I was living
in a hellhole where even

the roaches wouldn't eat

off the table. It wasn't
nothing my father didn't
know but somehow he black-
mailed my father and this
was the last straw with my
father, this was just a few
years ago. I was just so
upset, my father had even
taped the conversation and
the man said he wanted money
cause he knew all about his
wife. My mother was still
suing him for scads of money
and the house he lived in
and my father needed evid-
ence he needed. My father
paid him off for that.

So she got the job as a
psychiatric nurse, which she
loved the most, which is
pretty usual, a lot of nurses
and lots of psychiatrists
too have real psychiatric
problems. She also has been
in AA for years which hasn't
helped much, she used to
go to church but it didn't
help too much, either. She
lost the job as a psychiat-
ric nurse, moving away
didn't help. She was too
lonely and so she got com-
mitted again by a judge who
said she either had to go
to jail or be committed,
so she has been committed

A poem pierces my mind tonight
for you, for us, for the love we share

“in the belly of the beast", for Jack Henry Abbott
whom we never met but lived with

in the confinement of injustice & puke

I've been told I had a voice - I guess ~ style

There has never been comment on the words or meaning
the truths or realities of broken children

of ironic violent poems of a system

that devours minds, souls & beauty

Yes - it is true they no longer use a rubber hose
Attacks now are what society terms civilized

Tear down the psyche - play on the emotions

Disguise reality at all costs -

use inconsistency & always create confusion

Never define words in true context

Two days ago I watched the pigs
walk an inmate out who beat them

to the toilet with her contraband

2 hours later I watched them carry her back
unmoving, cuffed behind her back

I heard the Lt say "Tell them she OD'd"
After a night in the hospital -

they put her in a paper dress and

a room painted pink - pink they say

calms a troubled mind

I sat in my window with wet cheeks &
unblinking eyes

Yes we have seen the reality and lines
and we have watched others pass both
They say you & I are crazy - paranoid
they don't do those things anymore.
Well, maybe to men - but never to the women.

tion being subjected to
watching heterosexual "lov-
ing?"

7) Straight women are seen
as more valid.

8) Lesbian women are inval-
idated just by owning who
they are, and from that point
on, the only issue that is
"valid" for them to work on
is how not to be a lesbian.

I am grateful for the chance
to express myself--each time
I put pen to parchment now, I
save it, watch my growth and
learnings--whether it is lit-
erary or not I am rejoicing
that my mother or others are
not here to burn it and me.
We are all survivors in our
