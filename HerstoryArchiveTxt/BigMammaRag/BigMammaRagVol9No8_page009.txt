Massachusetts -  
Sexual Harassment

(collective note: the follo-  
wing is reprinted from the  
Guardian)

Over 200 outraged union mem-  
bers and supporters rallied  
June 24 to demand action  
against two plant managers  
who sexually abused a secre-  
tary at the General Electric  
(GE) facility in this city  
just outside Boston.

The protest outside the  
plant gates was organized by  
the International Union of  
Electrical Workers Local 201.  
The local, which represents  
8000 workers at the River-  
works plant in Lynn and in  
three smaller GE shops, called  
for the firing of the two ma-  
nagers.

After the demonstration, a  
cavalcade of cars, buses and  
motorcycles proceeded to the  
home of Fran Thorn, head of  
GE Lynn's Relations Operation  
and the man responsible for  
ineffectively disciplining the  
two employees. According to  
Local Vice President Ronald  
Malloy, the protestors “went  
to his door to present him  
with petitions that had al-  
most 1000 signatures," deman-  
ding the managers' firing.  
Instead, GE has moved only to  
downgrade the employees one or  
two management levels and to  
place them in different buil-  
dings.

The incident in question oc-  
curred on National Secretaries  
Day, when the two bosses asked  
their secretary to lunch. In  
the course of the lunch and  
the return trip to work, the  
two abused the 21-year-old  
woman verbally and half-un-  
dressed and assaulted her,  
according to a union spokes-  
person.

"I was yelling and hitting  
them as hard as I could, try-  
ing to dig my fingernails in-  
to them," the secretary said  
in her affidavit to her union  
steward. "I was terrified and  
helpless." The two allegedly  
threatened her with firing if  
she reported the assault.

Despite this intimidation,  
the secretary and her union  
steward reported the incident  
to GE the following workday,  
but received no response. An-  
gered by the attack and by  
company indifference, 150 ma-  
chinists in the woman's build-  
ing walked off the job April  
28. That forced GE to move  
the managers into neighboring  
buildings and to give them  
the token demotions.

At the same time, GE took  
disciplinary action against  
22 of those involved in the  
walkout. One was suspended  
without pay for a week, and  
21 others suspended for a day  
without pay. According to Mal-  
loy, GE also filed charges  
against Local 201 with the  
National Labor Relations Board  
for unfair labor practices,  
saying "who tells the company  
who to hire and who to fire?"

After soundly lambasting  
the actions of the company,  
speakers at the June 24 rally  
also called for new procedures  
to deal with sexual harassment.

Malloy said that the local  
plans a course set up to aid  
union personnel in handling  
such cases on the job. Because  
of the publicity garnered by  
the secretary's case, other  
women have already filed re-  
ports that one of the unit ma-  
nagers in question has haras-  
sed and abused them as well.

Kentucky -  
Hospital Workers

Two hundred and eighty mem-  
bers of the National Hospital  
Union in Prestonburg, Kentuc-  
ky, report that they continue  
to meet with daily threats of  
violence, shootings and beat-  
ings in a three-month-old  
strike against the Highlands  
Regional Medical Center.

The strikers--230 of them--  
are asking for higher pay,  
health insurance benefits,  
seniority rights and improved  
patient care standards. Most  
of the strikers earn the  
$3.35 an hour minimum wage.

Union members charge that,  
since the strike began on  
March 25th, their members  
have met with telephone  
threats saying they would be  
killed or crippled unless  
they end their strike; sabo-  
taged cars; and windows shat-  
tered by gunfire. In March,  
one member, Judy Hall, was  
hospitalized after she was  
struck by a speeding car  
which crashed into the picket  
line. In April, the union  
members charge, two nurses'  
aides were assaulted on the  
picket line by hospital secu-  
rity guards, and two other  
strikers were hit by speeding  
cars. In May, five other  
union members were reportedly  
assaulted by the hospital se-  
curity guards.

The hospital is reportedly  
guarded by 46 guards from a  
security firm called Nuckles  
(pronounced "knuckles"),  
which the strikers charge is  
"one of the most openly vio-  
lent strike-breaking compan-  
ies in the South."

The National Hospital Union  
represents 120,000 health  
care workers in 16 states.

Supreme Court -  
Comparable Worth

In what may be the first  
victory in the courts toward  
winning equal pay for jobs  
of comparable worth, the Su-  
preme Court ruled June 8  
that the Civil Rights Act of  
1964, which prohibits employ-  
ment discrimination on the  
basis of sex and race, is  
not limited to claims of  
equal pay for equal work.

Last year the Supreme  

Court refused to hear a case  
that had much broader impli-  
cations for comparable worth.  
(Some of the criteria for  
deciding if jobs are of  
comparable worth are the  
amount of education or skill  
workers must have.) It did  
say that if intentional dis-  
crimination in wage can be  
proven, a worker can sue  
their employer even if the  
jobs are not identical.  
While most employers will  
probably never be sued be-  
cause of the cost of fighting  
in the courts, this ruling  
can give union leverage in  
negotiating in bargaining  
for equal wages. And it may  
give women some leverage in  
forcing their unions to look  
at this issue and fight for  
us at the bargaining table.

And What The Court  
Giveth... Raygun -

While the Supreme Court  
was deciding to expand the  
interpretation of discrimi-  
nation in employment, the  
Reagan Administration has  
indicated it will narrow the  
interpretation of Title IX  
of the Civil Rights Act to  
exclude sex discrimination  
in employment.
