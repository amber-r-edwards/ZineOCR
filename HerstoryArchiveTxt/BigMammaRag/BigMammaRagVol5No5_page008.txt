FEMININE WILES

Are women more persuasive than  
men? The Journal of Social Psycho-  
logy reports that they probably are.  
A current article says that research-  
ers in a number of experiments,  
placed a woman in a group of three  
men to see if the woman would main-  
tain her position as strongly as a  
lone male would in a group of three  
women.

The researchers then had the —  
groups discuss controversial subjects.  
The Journal says that the women,  
in almost all the group discussions  
with a single man, were able to  
convince the single man to change  
his opinion. The researchers say  
the women did this by establishing  
a rapport with each other, and then  
by conveying an accepting attitude  
toward the opinion of the single man,  
when it differed from theirs.

The researchers report, however,  
that when three men were placed in  
a group with a single woman, they  
tended to be competitive and attempted  
to push their ideas on the single  
woman, causing her to be defensive.

The Journal says that in most of  
the latter groups, the men were not  
able to compromise enough to influ-  
ence the woman to change her mind.

NEW HOPE

A special post-conviction hearing  
is being held to determine whether  
the Wilmington 10 defendants, who  
were convicted in 1972 and sentenced  
to long jail terms, should be granted  
a new trial. Key prosecution witness-  
es have recanted their 1972 testi-  
mony, saying that they were pressur-  
ed and coached by the prosecution.  
Other irregularities are also being  
examined. The state of North Caro-  
lina has announced that if a new  
trial is ordered by the court, they  
will not conduct one.

POP OFF

Three schoolgirls put silver nitrate  
from the school laboratory in their  
headmaster's tea because they "were  
sick of him getting on at them".

And in Leeds, another schoolgirl and  
her elder sister set their home ablaze  
in an attempt to get rid of their  
father because "they hated his guts".

Father-figures had better watch out—  
they don't seem too popular these days.

Representatives from more than  
fifteen Third World countries have  
submitted affidavits testifying to  
the nutritional and health risks  
involved in using artificial infant  
formula products in poor countries.  
The affidavits were collected by the  
Sisters of the Precious Blood for use  
in a lawsuit the order has filed  
against Bristol Myers Co. *

At issue is the promotion and sale  
of artificial baby milk in Third  
World countries by U.S.-based,  
multi-national corporations.

Promoting the formulas through a  
variety of dubious marketing tech-  
niques, they imply that the use of  
artificial milk is nutritionally pre-  
ferable and more "modern" than  
breastfeeding.

Bristol Myers says that the issue  
of abuse in infant formula marketing  
cannot be decided by the courts and  
that in any case the issue is an  
improper one.

BATTERED WIVES SUE

A lawsuit has been filed in the  
Manhattan Supreme Court by 12 battered  
wives, charging the Police and  
Family Court with unlawful failure  
to protect them from their violent  
husbands.

More than 350 pages of sworn af-  
fidavits from women who were beaten  
by their husbands and then refused  
help by the Police and the Family  
Court detail the experiences of more  
than 70 battered wives living in  
New York City. When the women have  
turned to the police and courts for  
protection, they have been told  
"there is nothing wrong with a hus-  
band hitting his wife if he doesn't  
use a weapon" or "you don't seem like  
you need help", or as one police  
officer commented, "maybe if I beat  
my wife she'd act right too."

The lawsuit was originally filed  
in December by 12 married women suing  
on behalf of all battered wives who  
have been denied police and court  
aid. They are represented by a co-  
alition of four New York-based legal  
organizations.

The Matrimonial Unit of South  
Brooklyn Legal Services, a federally  
funded legal services program for  
persons of lower income, has been  
doing extensive research on the  
problem of wife battering during  
pregnancy. Due to the nature of  
the program, most of the respondents  
have been from lower income families.  
In order to improve the sample of  
respondents, the program is in need  
of information from women from middle  
and upper income homes.

DOUBLE STANDARD

A Spanish publication called New  
Force is out with another rationaliza-  
tion for treating women more harshly  
than men who are convicted of commit-  
ting adultery.

The magazine explains that the  
reason that Spanish law punishes an  
adulteress, while granting unfaithful  
husbands immunity in such cases, is  
that men cannot get pregnant.

In the words of New Force (quote)  
"Infidelity cannot be equal before the  
law for a man who returns home from a  
dalliance certain that he cannot become  
pregnant, and for a woman, to whom the  
opposite might happen." Since it's the  
woman who faces the risk of pregnancy,  
the publication argues, she is the one  
who should be punished severely.

Feminists in Spain are currently  
campaigning to overturn the Spanish law  
which imprisons women convicted of  
adultery for up to six years, while  
men convicted on the identical charge  
remain scot-free.

PREGNANCY ROULETTE

86,000 women using Koro-Flex  
diaphragms bearing the serial numbers  
F6, G6, H6, or 16, are playing  
Russian Roulette with pregnancy.  
Defective manufacturing has resulted  
in pinprick size holes along the rims  
of diaphragms from those four batches  
rendering those devices totally use-  
less.

Holland-Rantos of Trenton, N.J.,  
has voluntarily recalled all four  
batches with or without holes. A  
spokesman for the firm told Majority  
Report that women should check if the  
diaphragm they are using is Koro-Flex  
(Koro-Mex devices are not included  
in the recall), and whether it con-  
tains one of the four serial numbers  
on the rim (the firm has no reason  
to believe there is anything wrong  
with diaphragms bearing other serial  
numbers). If your diaphragm is one  
of the 86,000 the manufacturer wants  
back, bring it to the doctor or  
clinic where you got it for a replace-  
ment or refund. If you can't take it  
back to the clinic of origin for  
some reason, bring it to any Planned  
Parenthood clinic. Only about 1% of  
the F6, G6, H6, and 16 diaphragms  
are actually defective, but the firm  
decided to recall all of them anyway.

LOST GROUND

Women in Wyoming have lost ground  
in state government decision-making  
positions since 1974, Secretary of  
State Thyra Thomson said in a recent  
speech to a women's convention.

Mrs. Thomson said women in state  
government:

--head no departments despite a 63%  
increase in the number of agencies  
since 1974.

--head only 4% of the state govern-  
mental divisions.

--draw below average salaries in  
nine out of 10 instances.

--are on fewer state boards, except  
for the Commission on the Status of  
Women and the Committee on Aging.  
During the last three years, the  
number of persons on boards increased  
63%.

Further instances of inequitable  
treatment included a Wyoming bank  
that charged more for a loan to a  
woman than a man for the same type  
of loan, and a working woman who  
could not get a credit card until  
her father's name appeared on the  
application, even though she was his  
sole support and he had no income.

BETTER ORGASMS?

A New York doctor says he has been  
performing simple local operations that  
he contends can “increase the quality"  
of the female orgasm.

Dr. Leo Wollman of Brooklyn, says he  
has been performing what he calls "fe-  
male circumcision” operations on women  
patients. Such operations, according  
to the doctor, may help in situations  
where the hood-like foreskin which  
covers a woman's clitoris somehow pre-  
vents her from getting enough sexual  
stimulus to reach orgasm.

Wollman reported that 92 of the 100  
women who underwent the surgical proce-  
dure improved "somewhat" their ability  
to achieve orgasm after the operation.

He warned that only those who have  
what he describes as "a physical hin-  
drance to contact with the clitoris"  
should consider such surgery.
