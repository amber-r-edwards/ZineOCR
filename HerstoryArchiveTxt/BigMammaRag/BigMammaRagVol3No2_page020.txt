Caldwell Speaks Out on Rape

The opinions expressed here are those
of Ann Caldwell, not those of the
Minority Hotline or the Coalition on
Sexual Assault, both of which Ms.
Caldwell is a member.

Minority women don't get such a
good shake from the police. There is a
cavalier attitude toward a rape report
from a minority, which is part of the
mass mental block that minority
people are promiscuous.

There is no privacy in reporting a
rape downtown. Snide comments are
made. The attitude of a detective on
the Sex Assault Detail is that it’s
always the woman’s fault.

There was a string of rapes reported
in my neighborhood. The rapist had
the same habit in every assault. The
police didn’t put any special patrol
cars or anything to try to catch this
guy, so the husbands in the area had to
take off work and form a vigilante
committee to catch him. Well - that’s
what it took for the police to do
something. They finally caught a 17
year-old boy in the act. But he was a
juvenile, so who knows what happened
to him? He’s probably out on the
streets again.

If a woman is a prostitute, that is still
her own body. It’s hard to get that
through to the police. The hotline at
High Street gets calls from women
who really need to talk to someone.
Often their husbands cause such
problems for them that I don’t see how
they can stand it. A husband often

so she can't leave the house. The
woman is blamed for the rape. The
husband’s attitude is that you must
have done something to cause it. But
this is bullshit. Old women get raped,
young children get raped. In the whole
structure of this society, women are
put down, treated like sex objects. The
rapist degrades a woman to such a
point that he may murder her.

Minority women have unique
problems that women who are in NOW
(National Organization for Women)
don't have. But there are at least some
minority women represented in rape
action groups.

Some people see the rape problem
in terms of supply and demand. They
say that there would be no rape
problem if there were a red light
district for prostitutes. But the rapist
doesn’t pay a woman he assaults. He
wouldn’t go within a thousand miles
of a prostitute. He gets a kick out of
raping.

I hope I haven't stepped on
anybody’s toes, and if I have, to hell
with it. I stay up at night mad when
everyone else is sleeping.

Rape Research

Dr. Carolyn Hursch is a co-director
of a research project at the Violence
Research Unit, a division of Psychiatric
Services at Denver General
Hospital. The project is gathering
interviews of women who have been
raped and of women who have
successfully resisted sexual assault.

The interview is completely confi-
dential. A woman may use an
assumed name or just an initial. The
experience of any woman, no matter
how long ago it was that she was
attacked, is needed for the research.
The assault “isn’t something that a
woman forgets. Sometimes it’s easier
to talk as time passes,” says Dr.
Hursch.

A woman need not have reported her
rape to take part in an interview. The
research, when completed, will
hopefully provide a means toward
victim support, offender evaluation
and treatment. It may reveal more
successful means of resisting a rape
and show approaches of rapists.

Dr. Hursch is critical of the Denver
Police Department: “there is not as
comprehensive a preventive approach
as other cities have with rape.
Policewomen are not used as decoys.
The Police Department is not going
out after the problem.”

Any woman who would like to take
part in the research can call 623-8252.
