"Mental Illness Needs To Be Re-examined

in nursing homes has led to
"high rates of error, unnec-
essary sedation, adverse

reactions and addiction."
One pharmacist, commenting

on the effect of institution-
alization on the aging, said
"We know that the elderly
person when institutionaliz-
ed in a long-term facility
may be confused and agitated
++-may require phenothiazine
therapy, or more frequently
in males, anti-depressant
therapy.”

This implies that institu-
tionalization makes people
"crazy", and that people un-
happy in these settings
should be given powerful
mood changing drugs rather
than change the environment
to one more humane.

But symptoms that masquer-
ade as senility are often by
products of other treatable
conditions. They can be pro-
duced by malnutrition, infec-
tion, reaction to supposedly
harmless medicines, deterio-
ration of various parts of
the body, and, perhaps most
commonly, by deep depression
over the loss of a spouse,
banishment to a nursing home
or crushing loneliness.

The fourth most common ill-
ness for which drugs are pre-
scribed for seniors is men-
tal and nervous disorders.
Disagreement about the preva-
lence of seniors' mental dis-
orders ranges from claims
that they have more "mental
illness" than other groups

to ones that they have fewer
mental problems. Most texts
name depression as the most
common "mental illness" of
seniors while commenting

that depression is very hard
to diagnose and recognize.

There is a distinct split
in opinion as to whether in
discussing depression, one
should consider the poverty
and loneliness and loss that
seniors endure.

Senility is the major dis-
ease of the aged, divided in-
to a benign form with minor
memory loss, and senile de-
mentia, with about 80% of
cases caused by Alzheimer's
Disease, which produces a
gradual untreatable slide in-
to mental oblivion and death.

“Ironically, common "side
effects" of the drugs used
in institutions include con-
fusion, hallucinations, and
other symptoms which could
seem to nursing home staff
to be a form of senility.
The concept of "senility", 
like that of "mental illness"
--needs to be re-examined
since it may be a handy catch-
all for the effect of drugs
and institutional living.

Treating the aged is just
not profitable enough, says

Dr. David Grayton, director
of geriatrics at the Royal
Victoria Hospital in Montre-
al. "The nursing homes don't
want heavy care patients.
They prefer to have someone
who doesn't need as many nur-
sing services."

When depressed seniors do
not respond to drugs, often
ECT (electroconvulsive thera-
py) is tried. With some doc-
tors, it's the first choice
or preferred treatment.

Dr. M.R. Eastwood, Chief of
Geriatrics at the Clarke Ins-
titute of Psychiatry and
past president of the Ontar-
io Psychogeriatric Assoc.,
is among those preferring
ECT to drugs for seniors, as
he believes it is more effec-
tive and safer than anti-de-
pressant drugs, which may
have a toxic effect on the
heart and may produce heart
attacks. "ECT is very safe
and you have a trained anes-
thesiologist there who is
controlling everything. So
it's interesting that more
ECT is given to older pa-
tients, because their particu-
lar depressions are respon-
sive to ECT and they may well
be undergoing a safer proce-
dure." Some professionals,
however, are critical of the
use of ECT on the aged. Nei-
ther the American nor the
Canadian Psychiatric Assoc.
has examined the issue in
its most recent position pa-
per on ECT.

Over 35 years ago (about
8 years after shock was first
introduced in North America)
psychiatrist Alexander Grai-
nick reported in a research
article--a survey of 276 ECT
cases in one New York Hosp.-
ital that 4 people had died
shortly after receiving shock
treatments. In this 1946 ar-
ticle (published in the Amer-
ican Journal of Psychiatry),
he warned: “Advanced age
and pre-existing organic
brain disease are the most
common findings in those
(shock related deaths) so
far reported."

Eleven years later, in
1957, psychiatrist David J.
Impastato--a strong supporter
of shock treatment--reported
alarming findings of his de-
tailed analysis of 254 shock-
related deaths in Diseases Of
The Nervous System. A key
finding was that the death
rate from shock for older
people was "approximately one
in 200 patients or 0.5% in
patients over 50 years of age."
In sharp contrast, the aver-
age overall death rate for
shock victims of all ages is
roughly one in 1,000 patients.
In other words, a person 50
years of age or older is at

Because its simple metabolism is not readily
impaired with advancing age, and
accumulation is not likely to present a
problem, Ativan is a good choice for older
patients. Those who have trouble swallowing
solid medication appreciate the small Ativan
tablet, which is tasteless and disintegrates
within seconds in water or fruit juice.

O the times, they are a-changing! Not really, just more
up front and exposed. We have Eddie Meese around again.
Only now he is going to be US Attorney General. You remem-
ber Eddie—he's the boy that said people in soup lines were
moochers, they really had money for food. Because of his
comments RayGun put up a phony commission that looked at
hunger in the GOLP (Good Ole Land of Plenty).

Surprise, Surprise—we are all well fed, hunger is not
rampant & Black youths may be the best nourished group
around. Dr. George Graham, on the commission, advocated "a
series of cultural changes" (for Black people) including
"avoiding sex during pregnancy". Say What!!

The other week, in Detroit, where unemployment is ob-
scene, the Feds had to dump thousands of tons of spoiled
stored food, seems the state and federal gov't couldn't
agree on how to package it for distribution, so it was
spoiled, dumped and the people didn't get their due.

The new anti-Civil Rights Commission is busy, busy,
busy. They are going to “appraise the civil rights laws &
leave social policy to other organizations...they (hold on
to your seats) are going to investigate the possibility

place. Poor Babies!!

An FBI advisory board is considering expanding the
Nat'l Crime Info Center, a national computerized file, to
contain info on people who are "suspicious" non-suspects—
people who aren't wanted for crimes but are "suspicious"
because they may know someone connected with crime, terror-
ism or narcotics. They figure this would be
a "logical progression" of their efforts
(spying). Howdy, Geo. O!!

The Pentagon has been pushing nerve
gas, which allotment failed to pass
in the Congressional defense
budget. But if at first you
don't succeed...& they will
try again. Their favorite is
the binary weapons: two-
chambered bombs or shells in which
two relatively harmless materials
would be kept separately & then
mixed into a dangerous combination when the bomb is drop-
ped or the shell is fired. They wanted $114.6 million for
developing and manufacturing their killer gas.

Did you know that the feds have a computer workforce
