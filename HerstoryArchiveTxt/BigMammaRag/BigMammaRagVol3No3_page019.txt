Someone gave BMR $5 at the Wine, Women and Song #1 Benefit for a subscription. In all the commotion, we've lost the address and name of the person. We think it may be for Janet Pierce, but we don’t have your address. Please call the office if it’s yours.  

The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America have called for a boycott of Van Heusen shirts. By super exploitation of workers in Taiwan and Hong Kong, Van Heusen reaps large profits while paying wages of 25 cents an hour. Stores selling Van Heusen shirts are also being picketed because of numerous unfair labor practices. People who are interested in doing picket work in support of this boycott should contact Leslie Nader, 511 16th St. (#326) in Denver or call her at 825-8559.

On Thursday night before the Women's Festival, the Denver Women’s Center Coalition (DWCC) met to finalize plans for the Colorado Women's Festival and to make organizational decisions.  

It was decided that any funds from the Women’s Festival would be temporarily held until more definite plans could be made about the Denver Women’s Center. A temporary Women’s Center Council was chosen, made up of nine members--one from each of the six groups which were active organizing the festival, and three members to meet to make recommendations to the larger coalition on the following subjects: bylaws (or how decisions are made and by whom); statements of purpose (or what will the Women’s Center be and for whom); financial statements, incorporation, and criteria regarding who will be future members of the Women’s Center.  

An open meeting has been called for September 12, by which time the Council will present its reports to the coalition members, for discussion. The September 12 meeting will be held at 7:30 at the First Southern Baptist Church at 16th and Pearl.  

The groups which will be represented on a temporary council are: Rocky Mountain Women in the Arts, Herstory Theatre Group, Lesbian Task Force, Women in Transition, Big Mama Rag, and the Coalition Against Sexual Assault.  

A group for pre-orgasmic women is being formed beginning the third week of September. Call Jean Fortier at 831-7731, the Gestalt Institute for more information.
