WIND Ends Business

demand for books by, for and/or about  
women. Their usual suppliers (trade  
publishers and distributors) did not  
have much to offer in this area, so  
they were eager to find sources. Many  
of them came to Women in Distribution.

Since then, the large publishers  
have recognized the market that exists  
for ‘women's books’ and have published  
many books to sell to that market.  
Some of these books, covering every-  
thing from lesbian sexuality to women  
in corporations, have been good and  
some have been terrible. The important  
point is that in the eyes of most  
buyers for ‘straight’ bookstores, the  
area of ‘women's books’ and alternative  
lifestyle books' is now being covered  
by trade publishers. It is also true  
that less and less shelf space is be-  
ing given to small press books in  
women's bookstores. This is true for  
two reasons: many good books are  
coming from the trade and the women's  
bookstores want to give their customers  
a good selection of books; and in  
order to remain in business the women's  
bookstores must be competitive with  
the regular bookstores.

“We feel this phenomenon is disas-  
trous, not only in the short run, for  
the growth of WIND and other alterna-  
tive distributors and publishers but  
in the long run, for freedom of speech  
and expression.

From page 3

"When the trade publishers feel ‘the  
fad' of women's liberation has died  
down, it will be very easy for them  
to stop publishing ‘women's books.' We  
have seen the 'fads' within the frame-  
work of ‘women's books' that have been  
used. We have all heard the stories of  
different New York publishers who are  
looking for good 'incest' books one  
year or ‘self-defense’ books another  
year or whatever will sell. This year  
gay books are coming out in (relatively

large numbers from the trade publishers.  
But will they continue to publish books  
on lesbian mothers' custody fights? We  
have all heard about ‘concentration’ in  
the book industry. Publishing companies  
are merging with and being bought out  
by conglomerates such as ITT, Gulf and  
Western, and CBS. It is alarming to  
think of these corporations having  
complete control of what we can find

at our local bookstore/library.

"We do not like to be doomsday pre-  
dictors, but it seems to us that the  
situation is very serious.

"We are writing this in a semi-state  
of shock...However...we wanted to tell  
those of you who have supported us  
what our thinking was in this painful  
decision.
