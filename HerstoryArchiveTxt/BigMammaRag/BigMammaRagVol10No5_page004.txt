women in cages

The Marginal Status Of Psychiatric

Author's note: I read in your
"Where We're At" section last
month that you're planning
a May issue on Prisons and
Psychiatric institutions.
This article I'm submitting
doesn't seem to fit your

struggle

analysis but hope you'll
consider it anyway.

I'm of course very inter-
ested in the issue of incar-
ceration in the U.S. This
includes not only prisons
and psychiatric cages but
also juvenile detention cen-
ters, old age prisons—called
"homes" of all things, the
past and present incarcera-
tion of refugees, of the
Japanese Americans during
WW II, B.I.A. schools, the
incarceration of physically
disabled (or differently
abled), of those labeled
"retarded", of everyone con-
sidered cage material. Per-
haps in a future issue—if
there is a future, you could
explore the issue of women
in cages—the history of
cages in this country, how
justification of who belongs
in them changes from decade
to decade, along with ideas
for their demise in concrete
language. These are just
thoughts of mine. Getting
copy is another problem.)

Remembering what I thought
ended my three year career
as a prisoner of psychiatry
turned out to be just ano-
ther spot on a long conveyor
belt of oppression. With the
ward door locked behind me I
headed for the nearest high-
way, stuck out that magic
thumb, and was carried 1,000
miles to Boston. After land-
ing a job which I had to lie
to get, and finding a rat
trap to inhabit in this city
famous for universities and
baked beans, I visited the
local Women's Center.

Being new in town and
friendless, I decided to
take advantage of their free
peer counseling operation,
perhaps become a part of it.
At this time, I was oblivi-
ous to the fact that former
inmates face a powerful stig-
ma upon release, with fear
of the victims of psychiatry
being as common as racism.

My first meeting with Ms.
Peer excited me. I openly
shared my recent experiences
in the institution. She said
she'd read Women and Madness
and knew about it. I assumed
a connection with this woman
but our following meeting
proved me wrong. Ms. Peer
informed me that her highly
educated supervisor believed
I needed professional "help"
(She meant therapy.) There-
fore, she could not see me
again. I cried feeding her
fantasy of who I was, but
did not get angry or ques-
tion her politics. Feelings
of worthlessness temporarily
returned. The message was
clear. I didn't belong at
this Center for Normals.

A professional at this
Normals Center found a col-
league of hers working at
the local women's health
clinic willing to deal with

Dr. Feminist Health
shortly suggested the drug
lithium which would help me
look okay on the outside,
while destroying my insides.
Between cigarette puffs she
stated she'd commit me if I
exhibited obvious self-des-
tructive behavior. She fur-
ther added that I wouldn't
have stayed in a cage three
years if I hadn't chosen
that course of action. In
one way, her analysis was
correct. Three years earlier
I did freely choose to seek
out the services of a liber-
al school shrink who invol-
untarily incarcerated me.
This choice of dealing with
problems in living got me
locked in, drugged up, and
stripped of all decision
making power.

Slow learner that I am, my
past did teach a few lessons
on how authority works. I de-
cided not to tempt Dr. Fem-
inist into abusing her power
and class privilege. I termin-
ated the relationship.

Luckily I found other former
psychiatric inmates for sup-
port and learned my experien-
ces with shrinks and feminists
were not unique. I became ac-
tive in the mental patient
(psychiatric inmate) libera-
tion movement and rapidly de-
veloped an ex-inmate political
consciousness. Keeping company
with others struggling to stay
out of cages helped me develop
strength and a sense of pride.
We shared our nightmares,

frustrations and anger. We
worked through our feelings of
inferiority developing an an-
alysis of psychiatric oppres-
sion which moved beyond the
narrow professional feminist
theories.

Please note, I do not call
this movement the anti-psychi-
atry movement anymore than
feminists call their trip the
anti-patriarchy movement. Li-
beration feels more positive
than the term "anti". I per-
ceive the anti-psychiatry
group as composed mainly of
liberal shrinks who, like the
feminist movement, do nothing
to question the therapeutiza-
tion of this culture. The
liberal's idea of fighting
psychiatric violence is to
put money in their own pock-
ets by offering their brand
of shrinkery as an alterna-
tive rather than a variation
of the patient/therapist
model.

I wonder why the word "pa-
tient" changed to "client"
but the term therapist re-
mained intact along with the
medicalization of behavior,
drugs, and cages? Why are so
many feminists seeing thera-
pists? Why, despite the glut
of feminists into the pro-
fessional therapy con game
are electroshock, drugging
and incarceration on the rise
for women? How does psychia-
try mirror the entire medical
octopus? What are true alter-
natives as opposed to varia-
tions of this medical indus-
trial complex? Can one hon-
estly make an in-depth analy-
sis of forced psychiatric
"treatment" without question-
ing voluntary procedures? How
does one move from voluntary
to involuntary status? If we
think the medical show is the
only one playing in town, how
does this limit our choices?
These are just some of the
questions I've attempted to
address over the past decade.
Others include why is the
voice of the psychiatric in-
mate movement silenced by the
feminist press? Why is the
women's community not a "safe
home" for former psychiatric
inmates?

Observation and experience
dictate that ex/inmates and
others critical of the narrow
feminist therapy perspective
find little support in the
women's movement. So often
our voices, letters, reviews
and articles meet white-
washers or censors in the
feminist media—Big Mama Rag
being a rare exception. In
contrast, feminist therapists'
words find no lack of space
or readership and fill the
majority of most classified
sections. I interpret this
wide press coverage as serv-
ing to cover up psychiatric
violence—calling it abuse,
to muzzle former and current
psychiatric inmates, and to
stifle non-professional wo-
men in their efforts to help
each other through mild and

severe life crises. Further-
more, it perpetuates the lie
that ex/inmates have no an-
alysis of our situation,
that only professionals can
speak for us, that only some
kind of psychological ser-
vices can help us live our
lives.

Though some movement peo-
ple do seek out therapy in-
dividually, most feminists
can't understand why we
count the shrinks out when
it comes to conferences,
editorial work or speaking
engagements. One reason is
that our words are constant-
ly re-written or used by the
professionals to further
their careers with new theo-
ries of madness. We haven't
forgotten times past when
we naively believed it pos-
sible to work with these
people politically. Femin-
ist therapists consistently
assumed leadership roles
and while talking down to
us, chose topics of discus-
sion important to them
leaving us silenced and
frustrated. As Tanya Temkin
stated a few years back,

As in any liberation move-
ment, the primary impetus
for change in an oppressive
system will come from those
who have been its victims—in
this case, inmates and
ex-inmates. It will not come
certainly, from self-styled
"radical" or feminist thera-

pists who confuse themselves
and others into thinking
that their priorities are
the same as those of ex-pa-
tients thus defusing the
latter group's radical
potential.

Therapy isn't the only
issue which concerns me. I'm
angered that feminist educa-
tors call on Women Against
Psychiatric Assault or WAPA
members to speak on rare
occasions and while having
no problem paying the pro-
fessionals they ask in,
assume our experience and
research should be delivered
for free since we lack "pro-
per" credentials. How inter-
esting that college degrees
magically transform just
folks into the credible
class giving them not a
monopoly on knowledge but on
power.

I further question why our
area of interest is immedi-
ately relegated to a health
issue by feminists while
lesbianism, poetry, spiritu-
ality or the prison system
aren't so easily slotted?
Why do feminists join the
dominant society by using
the metaphors sick, insane,
bats, nuts, crazy, schizo,
etc., whenever someone or
something distasteful cross-
es their path? Perhaps in
the future they will realize
how thoughtless and harmful
these words are to those of
us who have been and are now
being tortured because of the
hatred and misunderstanding
these concepts carry.

I think of Seamoon House's
words, "yet I have been call-
ed 'looney' in a ridiculing
tone of voice by two women
defining themselves as fem-
inist and living in a space
defined as a women's space,"
or Lori Bradford's, "Once at
a dance a woman who had heard
of me told me she was afraid
to sit next to me, wasn't
sure what I would do." I re-

member Rose speaking about
her electroshock torture and
being interrupted by another
feminist with, “why do you
work at alienating people?"
Events like the above happen
each day in the lives of ex-
inmate feminists. The margin-
al status of ex/inmates in
the women's movement forced
many of us to question fem-
inist politics. Some, like
myself, chose to withdraw
our energy from such an op-
pressive community. Others
decided to try to numb them-
selves and look for possible
alliances between the two
movements. I think both paths
are important and necessary
at this time.

In looking to the past (I'm
frequently reminded how
things have improved for us
"sickies" in an attempt to
invalidate my protests), I
picture the poster proudly
displayed in the women's
history library in Cambridge.
From the first wave of fem-
inism it reads, "CONVICTS

AND LUNATICS HAVE NO VOTE
—Should all women be clas-
sed with these?” Most femin-
ists still scream "No!" in
unison. The stereotypes are
incorporated into the poli-
tics.

In imagining the future,
perhaps the prison movement
and ex-inmates from psychia-
tric and other institutions
of incarceration, can unite
into an independent living
movement while recognizing
our similarities and res-
pecting our differences. Per-
haps, someday, feminist
publications will think
about the policy of the pri-
son newspaper, No More Cages.
"We do not publish material
that is racist, anti-gay, an-
ti-semitic, or sexist. Neither
do we publish material that
might create divisions between
women inside, that subscribes
to the system's notions of
who is ‘criminal’, or that
reflects society's bigotry
against victims of psychia-
tric oppression.”
