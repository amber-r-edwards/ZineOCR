Pope  
Joan  

Amidst the controversy over the  
ordination of women to the priesthood  
the question of whether there ever  
was a woman Pope is surfacing  
again.  

Legend has it that there was indeed  
a Pope: Joan who held the papal throne  
around 855 A.D.  

Pope Joan was reportedly born in  
Germany of English parents and fell  
in love there with a Benedictine  
monk. In order to keep their relat-  
ionship a secret, Joan is said to  
have disguised herself as a man and  
to have fled to Athens with her  
lover. Once in Greece, she report-  
edly took up the study of religion  
and philosophy and entered the  
priesthood.  

After her lover died, the fable  
says that Joan went to Rome where  
she became known and respected as  
a distinguished religious scholar  
and subsequently became a Cardinal.  

According to the legend, Joan was  
then elected to be Pope. She re-  
mained on the throne of Saint Peter  
for a very short time, however. Her  
sex became known somehow, and she is  
said to have been stoned to death  
by an angry mob.  

Pope Joan's statue was reportedly  
among the Papal statues in the  
Siena Cathedral in Rome until it  
was ordered removed in the 16th  
century by Pope Clement VIII.  

The Pope Joan story is considered  
purely mythical by Vatican historians  
today.

Hypnotic Research  

Documents released by the Central  
Intelligence Agency reveal that most  
of the Agency's experiments in mind  
control were carried out on “young,”  
"very suggestible," and "very photo-  
genic" women employees.  

Inquiry magazine reports that the  
latest documents are part of the  
CIA's mind-control programs of the  
1950s and 1960s.  

According to the documents, the CIA  
used in the experiments mostly 19-  
year-old agency secretaries who vol-  
unteered for after-hours duty.  

Inquiry says these "girls," as the  
documents call them, were apparently  
hypnotized to respond to code words,  
and that when those words were spoken  
the women would fall into a deep  
trance. The magazine says the women  
would be secretly filmed by agents  
under the guise of research.  

Inquiry says that the stilted lan-  
guage of the official reports reveals  
that "a great deal of the research  
seemed to involve the hiding of  
documents in bodices, young women  

One  
Gay Bob  

The American toy industry is  
witnessing a new low--dolls that do  
everything which is humanly possible  
including war games, have been pre-  
empted by sexuality. Yes --the new  
doll, GAY BOB.  

Gay Bob is the creation of an  
advertising executive from New York,  
Harvey Rosenberg. Rosenberg spent  
ten thousand dollars on his creation  
and markets it largely through mail  
order. The doll itself comes with  
a flannel cowboy shirt, denim jeans  
and cowboy boots, and of course,  
wears one earring. By the way,  

Bob comes complete with a closet.  

Rosenberg says, "men have to  
liberate themselves from traditional  
sex roles,...everyone from business  
executives to construction workers  
need to come out of the closet."  

Whatever the reason for this  
invention the doll seems to be  
selling. Rosenberg attributes this  
to the fact that people are fascin-  
ated by homosexuality. Rosenberg is  
pleased with Gay Bob and has devel-  
oped a whole plastic entourage of sex-  
ual stereotypes--Straight Steve and  
Liberated Libby.

Sue the State  

A California state court of appeals  
has ruled that the state may be sued  
for wrongful death in the case of a  
San Diego State University student  
who was raped and murdered.  

The woman was assaulted in her  
dormitory room. The three justices  
of the 4th District Court of Appeals  
ruled that university officials were  
aware of numerous rapes on the campus  
area and should have taken steps  
to protect student residents.  

The appellate court's decision re-  
versed a San Diego state superior  
court judge's dismissal of a wrongful  
death suit filed by Yvonne Duarte.  
Duarte's 18-year-old daughter Tanya  
Gardini was raped and killed in  
her dormitory room in December of  
1974.

lying down on sofas to go into  
trances, and peepholes and two-way  
mirrors through which the proceedings  
were observed."  

What the magazine calls "the slight-  
ly leering tone" of the research  
reports is illustrated, for example,  
by an account of two women placed in  
a deep sleep in an operations room  
and then photographed by another  
volunteer.  

The report describes "one picture  
with one woman reclining on the sofa  
and a second with her sitting up-  
right." Other pictures also taken  
of the secretaries depicted them  
apparently engaging in sexual acts  
together.  

The CIA researchers concluded from  
these experiments, Inquiry says,  
that a person under deep hypnosis  
could be placed in a very compromis-  
ing position and could be photo-  
graphed probably without any know-  
ledge of this taking place.

Another  
Gay Bob  

New York Controller Robert "Bob"  
Yuill says he plans to start a class  
action against the US makers of an  
"anatomically correct" homosexual  
doll called "Gay Bob."  

Yuill said he wants all Canadians  
named Bob to get in touch with him  
and together they will start the  
action against what he says is the  
misuse of a respectable name.  

If he is successful, the case would  
likely have to be heard at The Hague.  

When asked how many "Bobs" had  
replied to his call, he refused to  
reveal the number.  

Yuill claims that he has been the  
butt of many homosexual jibes since  
the existence of the doll was made  
public. “I'm proud of my name," he  
said, and does not want the dolls  
sold in Canada.  

"I've nothing against the gay move-  
ment if it's done quietly among  
adults," he said, “but I don't want  
to see it promoted among children."  

Yuill is felt to be partly respon-  
sible for North York Mayor Mel Last-  
man's attempt to award Anita Bryant  
a medal for her stand against “homo-  
sexual activists."  

Any "Bobs" interested in contact-  
ing Controller Yuill should call him  
at (416) 224-6151.

Femininity &  
Self-Image  

Ken Neagle, the new warden at the  
Federal Prison for Women in Alderson,  
West Virginia says he will use his  
authority over 515 female inmates to  
make them more aware of their femin-  
inity.  

Says Neagle, "I'd like to help  
women improve their self-image. I'd  
like to make them more aware of their  
womanness. I'd like to see more  
emphasis on the arts, more time de-  
voted to music, painting and pottery-  
making and less time to softball and  
shooting pool."  

Currently, there are no women ward-  
ens working in the federal prison  
system.

Fascism  

University of California at Santa  
Cruz researchers have found that on  
top of sexism, women also have to  
contend with what they call “fascism."  

Researchers Dane Archeh, Deborah  
Kimes and Michael Barria report  
they conducted a study in which men  
and women were asked to make draw-  
ings of both sexes.  

According to the researchers,  
almost all of the men and women drew  
men with stick bodies and very de-  
tailed faces. On the other hand,  
both sexes also drew women with vague  
and virtually featureless faces, but  
with shapely and intricately detailed  
bodies.  

The researchers say the drawings  
reveal that the unique qualities of  
men are more frequently associated  
with the faces and heads, and near-  
ness to the brain, while the qualities  
of women are more often associ-  
ated with the physical body.
