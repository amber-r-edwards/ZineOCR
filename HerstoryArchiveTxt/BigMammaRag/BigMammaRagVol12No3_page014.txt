"... I Lived On A ‘Tip-Toe’ Stance’

Sharron Wallace

(collective note: Sharron is
at present a prisoner of the
state at Kansas Correctional
Institute, Lansing, Kansas.)

In 1980, somewhere in the
month of July or August, I
was placed in the institu-
tion's segregation unit for
four non-violent disciplin-

ary reports. These alleged
violations were petty in
nature and the nightmare
that followed was not de-
served. I was the victim of
constant, vicious harassment
by the officers and staff
members. I was provoked

day in and day out in such
a way that I lived on a
"tip-toe" stance not know-
ing what horrors would be
thought of and executed
next. The segregation unit of
which I am speaking measures
approximately 35 square
feet in total living space.
The cell is approx. 6ft.
by 7ft. My "keepers" creat-
ed the tension that existed
and still exists today. I
was punished for everything
that I felt, whether it was
love or hate. These people
thought fit to play with

my life!
On or about October 19,
1980, while serving break-

Leap Year gives us one more day of lying poly(ester)ti-
cians. Treasury Sect'y Donnie Regan told congress to
trash Marty Feldstein's economic report. Feldstein is
chairman of Ronnie RayGun's Council of Economic Advisors.
Feldstein wants RayGun to have $925.5 billion to play
with in '85. And RayGun really wants that too. Think of
all the killer toys he could buy, swap, send to other
dictators for their fun and games!

In the meantime, we are lied to & told that jobs
are on the increase, that people are homeless by choice
and people are eating well. The reality is that people
are harassed and lied to when they apply for food stamps,
federal & state aid, medical benefits, & nutritional
programs. Food is stored & rots, Social Security cost of
living raises is attacked & older people and differently

abled are fighting to exist. Acid rain is falling on us,
secret underground nuke testing continues & nuke plants
are getting more dangerous daily. The pigs are put-
ting more notches on their guns...look around & see who
is suffering, we all are.

Workers Alert! RayGun is again trying to tax health in-
surance that you get at your workplace. Hardest hit
would be workers whose unions have got big comprehensive
insurance plans. People without insurance can try cli-
nics but that can be risky to your health.

And thanks to the US Supreme (Give me a break!) Court,
Unions have become an endangered species. Co's can now
cancel union contracts by filing a Chapter 11, even if
the co's survival is not at stake. All
they have to do is show that the labor
contract is burdensome and that the
best interests of the business, its
creditors & employees favor
cancelling the contract.

The Office of Juvenile
(IN) Justice & Delinquency
Prevention wants to spend
$800,000 to evaluate the bio-
logical, hormonal & neurological
responses on kids as they read
smut rags like Playboy, Hustler etc.
& watch porn flicks. The kids would watch murder, mutila-
tion, individual & gang rapes, incest, child abuse &
much more. Why? you may wonder, well these quacks figure
all that material might cause juvenile delinquency, run-
aways, teenage pregnancy, incest, rape etc. etc. etc.
This bright idea cancels out another bright idea that
would have cost $500,000. That study was to pinpoint
“future criminals" by examining 9-12 year olds for signs
of left-handedness, odd shaped toes & earlobes & failure
to sweat when given electric shocks.

Alabama says its legal-12(known) KKKers are registering
voters-one in full uniform- hoping to recruit whites at
the same time in their slimy group.

And Howie Baker, Jr. (Repub.-Tenn) is going to bring up
a constitutional amendment to permit public school prayer!

my feelings and the ultimate

fast, the officer, a ser-
geant, threw hot coffee in
my face. I have possession
of the transcript in rela-
tion to the hot coffee
throwing incident. However,
the testimony of the offi-
cer involved is not com-
pletely factual. Following
an investigation the officer
was found guilty and de-
moted. This officer's vic-
iousness and brutality is
known among other inmates
and his co-workers. The
officer is still allowed to
practice his zealous, selec-
tive, law-enforcement tac-
tics. It is a well-known
fact that inmates would be
severely punished if they
were to resort to the same
kind of violence that this
officer uses. A mere demo-
tion was not appropriate in
this case.

On November 30, 1980, at
approximately 6:10 p.m.,
three officers (one female
lieutenant and two male
correctional officers) en-
tered the segregation unit,
opened the cell where I was
held captive and started to
physically harass me. I was
pushed against the wall. At
this point I heard one of
the male officers yell,
“This is it! This is it!" A
few seconds later, the fe-
male lieutenant, who
weighed approx. 175 lbs.,
sprayed mace in my face and
then she forced me to the
floor on my knees where she
then pulled my undergar-
ments down, fumbling as if
she was in search of some-
thing. I partially opened
my eyes and observed one
of the male officers looking
at me. The other officer
backed up and said, "Shar-
ron I didn't have anything
to do with it." I was then
placed in handcuffs for
approx. an hour and a half.
I had done nothing to pro-
voke the mace/handcuffs in-
cident. It was a conspira-
cy and malicious attack
upon my person. The hand-
cuffs left scars on my
wrists, which I still have
and the mace left scalp
burns.

I do not have specific
dates and times for each
incident that occurred while
I was in the segregation
unit. For quite some time I
was only allowed to take
showers twice a week and in
handcuffs. Because of the
restriction of movement I
could not properly clean my
body. I was not allowed ex-
ercise for a period of six
months. Because of the lack
of exercise I experienced
dizziness and because of
improper ventilation I could
not breathe. During the
winter I was denied the use
of a bed and a blanket. I
was forced to lay on the
hard, cold concrete floor
with only a stiff mat. One
night I got extremely cold
so I asked two correctional
officers on duty for a
blanket to cover up with.
They informed me that the
Director said for me to
cover up with the stiff can-
vas mat. I could not pur-
chase personal hygiene it-
ems from the inmate commi-
ssary, as I was denied can-
teen privileges. These
items were not furnished
by the institution either.
On December 1, 1980, at
3:40 p.m. five officials
(I can't recall their rank)
entered the segregation
unit, unlocked the cell I
was in and proceeded to
search my cell for an alleg-
ed cigarette lighter. They
knew I did not have a
lighter because they took
it from me. I was later in-
formed by the officer that
another officer had placed
a lighter in my cell. In
this search I was subjected
to a pelvic and rectal
search by the staff nurse.
On one occasion I was
transferred to Larned
State Hospital where I was
subjected to brutality be-
cause I could not sleep. I
was escorted to a room
that was cold and only had
a stiff mat on the floor.
Approx. 15 minutes later I
knocked on the door and re-
quested some water. I was
refused the water. I was
dragged to another room by
several aides and strapped
to a bed where one of the
nurse's aides tried to slap
me in the face. One of the
male aides climbed on top
of the bed and placed his
knee at the base of my
throat where he then press-
ed the weight of his body
down and caused me to start
choking. Another aide stop-
ped him from choking me. I
was then given a shot of
medication which left me
physically immobile for
four days. I had to have
assistance from other
"patients" in order to take
a shower and use the toilet.
On August 5, 1981, during
my captivity in the segre-
gation unit I initiated an
all-out effort to free my-
self from the torment of
the cell. That effort was a
hunger strike. An institu-
tion counselor came to talk
to me about the strike. He
asked me if the strike was
being initiated out of
