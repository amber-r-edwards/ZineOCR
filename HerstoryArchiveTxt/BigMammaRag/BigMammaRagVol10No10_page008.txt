This excellent book talks of
many experiences of white and
Black women in the defense in-
dustry in the 1940s and all

the contradictions that faced
them.

Women were told they should
take defense jobs to bring the
men home sooner, that being
absent from work—even if your
child(ren) needed you—was a
bad reason, putting aside dre-
sses and nylons for coveralls
did not make a woman less
“feminine” and that all women

“were in this (the war effort)
together. Except that all the
ads, posters, billboards and
propaganda featured white,
middle-class women.

Some women working in plants
had child care centers, some
joined unions that welcomed
them, some belonged to unions
that ignored them, one thing
happened to most—they had
good pay and were fired when
the war ended.

Many things were common for
both Black and white women
workers: long hours on the job,
tension at home if they had
husbands because of their new
found independence, long hours
waiting in lines to buy scarce
clothes and food with ration
cards, long hours working in
their own homes doing women's
work, concern over what was
happening between their kids
and themselves—long hours
that good pay couldn't quite
make up for, but for most wo-
men of both races it was the
first time they had skilled
jobs, good pay and pride in
their work.

Black women and men fought
hard to get into the defense
industry, even before the war
started the country was gear-
ing up for more heavy industry.
Companies didn't want them,
unions didn't help and the

government was indifferent. It

wasn't until mid 1941 when the
Brotherhood of Sleeping Car

Porters (an all Black union)

threatened Washington D.C. with
a march of 100,000 militant
Blacks did Roosevelt issue an
Executive Order that helped
establish the Fair Employment
Practice Commission that was

to outlaw discrimination in the
defense industry (only) because
of race, creed, color or nat-
ional origin. But like all
government agencies, laws and
enforcement—it did somethings,
somewhere, sometimes.

Black people were very mil-
itant about getting jobs and
getting into unions. Once get-

ting a job, they had to put up
with the usual racist bullshit
through company practices (se-
parate bathrooms and eating

areas) and once in unions,
through union practices (aux-
iliary groups rather than be-
ing in the main body of the
union, paying higher union dues
than whites). They picketed,
they held wildcat strikes (un-
authorized by the unions) and

Wildcat strikes also happened
over poor working conditions
or when companies refused to
promote Black workers to higher
job levels.

Safety conditions were very
bad in most plants for both
races. It wasn't until the 60s

and 70s that many workers
from the 40s were turning up
with white lung; cancer brought
on by the exposure of the
lungs to asbestos, as well as
other illnesses. The war cas-
ualty figures were high but
the industrial casualties and
deaths were even higher. The
main adjustments that indust-
ry made for women were those
that would allow them to do
the work: better lighting,
machine heights were lowered
and arm reach required of
workers reduced.

The idea was sold to women
that operating machinery was
just as easy and just as safe
as running your vacuum cleaner.

As Margaret Wright, munitions
worker said, "Jobs were not
safe. Women were 'too delic-
ate' to go to war or do dan-
gerous things, but they would
let us be blown up sifting gun
powder. Every last one of us
who worked in that department
was a woman, and it was very,
very dangerous. The horror of
bad working conditions is that
it existed before the war, du-
ring the war and still

The chapter on propaganda On
The Homefront was real inter-
esting to me. I was 17 when
the war ended, in high school
but I do remember a lot of
the propaganda. The movies
gave the impression that all
white Americans in the armed
forces were buddies, regard-
less of race, creed, religion
or national origin and that
most of our boys were good
boys: wild, naive, smart,
dull, city slicker, country
bumpkin (all the stereotypes)
but they were good boys.

And we women were to work and
wait for them and bring them
home with our prayers. Our
enemies were horrible, they
bombed children, women and old
folks...our bombers were al-
ways shown making a direct hit
on a distant target. The cam-
eras never focused in on close
ups, so obviously we just hit
buildings, bridges, ships,
etc. that were empty of
people.

But the propaganda aimed at
women at the end of the war
was horrendous and it was
believed. Women were told to
give up their jobs gladly, go
back to the home, have babies,
be the total woman and stand
by your man. Women were told
that when they gave up their
