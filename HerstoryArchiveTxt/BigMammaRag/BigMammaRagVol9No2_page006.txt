Uncommon Law  

The California Supreme Court, in  
an unprecedented decision, has ruled  
that a father has no automatic right  
to give his child his last name. The  
ruling overturns hundreds of years  
of common law going back to King Hen-  
ry the Eighth of England. The five-  
to-two decision reversed a trial  
court ruling that Patricia C. Herd-  
man had no right to give her child  
her maiden name after she was  
divorced.  

Son Investments  

Do male children prevent divorce?  
That's what some researchers are  
claiming. Paul Glick from the US Cen-  
sus Bureau says, "If a woman has at  
least some boys, the marriage is more  
likely to stay together. The biggest  
plus seems to be two boys; the big-  
gest minus, two girls." Glick bases  
his plus and minuses on national sta-  
tistics gathered between 1975 and  
1978. His ideas are supported by Mav-  
jis Heatherington, a researcher who  
chairs the psychology department at  
the University of Virginia. Heather-  
ington theorizes that fathers have  
“greater emotional investments in  
their sons than in their daughters,  
and are more reluctant to leave their  
male offspring." She says, however,  
"We really don't have hard evidence"  
to support such a theory.  

Protection Racket  

Paul Laxalt (R-Nevada) introduced  
the Family Protection Bill $1808 to  
the Senate. This bill would, among  
other things, prohibit the use of  
federal funds, by schools, for the  
purchase of textbooks that would  
"diminish or deny the differences  
between the sexes as it has been  
historically understood in the US."  
In other words, books that challenge  
sex-role stereotypes. The Senate  
Finance Committee now has charge of  
the bill.  

Ready And Able  

In an unusual break with government  
quotas, the City of Seattle has de-  
cided one of every four construction  
workers on its new West Seattle  
Bridge would be women. The federal  
government, for its part, has set  
goals for the employment of women in  
construction at only 6.9%. Emily Dun-  
can, of Seattle's Office of Women's  
Rights, says, however, that in the  
Pacific Northwest there are more than  
enough women who are ready and able  
to work in construction.

Held Accountable  

New York's highest court ruled  
January that the state's Division  
of Human Rights (DHR) can order an  
employer to apologize for an offen-  
sive remark made to a worker. The  
division can even fine the boss for  
doing it. The ruling upheld DHR's  
order to a Brooklyn restaurant owner  
to apologize in writing, offer to  
reinstate with back pay and award  
$500 in damages to a waitress he had  
referred to in obscene terms as a  
"Jewish broad" who thought she was  
entitled to special treatment. The  
4-3 majority held that the award to  
the woman, Eleanor Rose, was reason-  
able because of her boss' "humiliat-  
ing" denunciation of her.  

Sexist Logic I  

A Sexual Offenses Bill on rape,  
proposed recently by Senator Gemma  
Hussey, has been thrown out by the  
Irish Parliament. Part of Hussey's  
bill would have required at least  
four women to serve on rape juries.  
Recently a circuit judge dismissed  
the women jurors in a rape case on  
the grounds that they would be bias-  

ed. An all male jury was sworn in and  

the accused was found not guilty of  
rape.  

Sexist Logic II  

An Illinois court has ruled a man  
who is serving a 60 year prison sen-  
tence for the murder of his wife is  

not an unfit father and may seek cus-  

tody of his son by the woman he mur-  
dered. Ironically, this same court  

ruled a divorced woman unfit to raise  

her children because she lived with  
her boyfriend.  

Doctor Cramped  

A woman recently wrote in to the  
Rocky Mountain News thanking them  
for printing an article in which a  
number of male physicians explained  
to a symposium that prostaglandin  
inhibitors relieve menstrual pain.  
But, she adds, "No mention was made  
of Dr. Penny Wise Budoff, the New  
York gynecologist/family practition-  
er who pioneered this research, and  
a woman. Neither was there any men-  
tion that she got no backing from  
the drug companies or her fellow  
doctors-- they didn't think it was  
an important problem. Some of them  
didn't and don't even think it's a  
real problem. Now that she's estab-  
lished the concept and pioneered the  
treatment, the drug companies smell  
money, the male doctors smell glory,  
and the largely male press doesn't  
mention Dr. Budoff."

Fuzz ’n Fluff  

Donald Pomerleau, a recent appoint-  
ee to President Ronald Reagan's "Ad-  
ministration of Justice” task force,  
thinks that all women are "little  
balls of fluff." Pomerleau, police  
commissioner for the City of Balti-  
more, testified in a sex discrimina-  
tion suit brought against the Balti-  
more City Police Department by four  
women police officers. The suit con-  
tended that men with lower test  
scores were promoted to sergeants  
ahead of the women who were more  
qualified. Pomerleau, who has been  
police commissioner since 1966, may  
explain why there is a grievance: he  
told the court that he thinks "all  
women are little balls of fluff in  
the eyes of the Creator. It's an en-  
dearing term I would use to describe  
my wife."  

Outside Looking In  

Women demonstrators in Port Mores-  
by, Papua New Guinea recently pro-  
tested the presence of only one  
woman delegate out of 200 at the  
South Pacific Commission Conference.  
The conference's topic was "Women's  
Role in Development of Pacific Re-  
gions."  

Money For Moms?  

California's Supreme Court has a-  
greed to hear a complaint that moth-  
ers who leave outside work to take  
care of children should get unemi-  
ployment benefits. If the court  
agrees with Betty Anne Boren, who  
sought the hearing, 100,000 Californ-  
ia women could pick up more than  
$70 million in back unemployment  
benefits.  

Pimp led  

"I have never touched a woman in  
my life...Perhaps Josette once or  
twice but no more. Anyway that hap-  
pens in the best households,“ claim-  
ed a pimp accused of exploiting and  
torturing prostitutes. Five prosti-  
tutes in the French town of Grenoble  
brought charges against seven pimps,  
giving evidence against the men in  
court, despite receiving death  
threats. All the pimps were found  
guilty and the women were awarded  
20,000 pounds in damages.  

Wifely Do Do’s  

Spare Rib, Britain's feminist  
magazine, quotes from the book Mar-~  
riages Are Made on what the new wife  
must learn: "A woman's role in mar-  
riage is usually a curious blend of  
mistress, friend and mother-- mother  

not only to her children but some-  

times, too, to her strong, masculine  
husband on those occasions when he  
isn't feeling very strong and super-  
ior. Maternal love, and friendly  
love are generally built-in emotions  
in a normal woman. Sexual love is  
sometimes another matter. It is  
largely accepted that it is just as  
instinctive for a woman to resist  
physical union as it is for a man to  
seek it. Before marriage this is a  
good instinct because society agrees  
that the tragedy of promiscuity--  
illegitimate babies-- is best avoid-  
ed. Once married, however, a woman  
must learn to reciprocate her hus-  
band's advances."  

Suicidal Rules  

A woman in the northeastern Braz-  
ilian city of Fortaleza killed her-  
self apparently because she couldn't  
meet her husband's demands set forth  
in a set of "commandments," the Ce-  
ara State Public Security Dept. said  
January. Maria Celizete Ribeiro Mor-  
eira died January 4, a month after  
setting herself on fire. The woman's  
family is suing the husband on  
grounds that he drove the victim to  

suicide by forcing her to sign a con  

tract strictly controlling her life.  
According to the department, the  
"commandments" included (among oth-  
ers): never offend Mr. Moreira with  
harsh words; in Mr. Moreira's ab-  
sence from home, do not leave the  
house for any reason, for example,  
to go to the beach, the movies or  
parties; hand over to Mr. Moreira,  
upon (her) becoming involved in any  
income-producing activity, wages re-  
ceived; do not complain about what  
time Mr. Moreira goes out or comes  
home, which in any case will not be  
made known.

Believe It Or Not  

The North Shore Women's Centre of  
Vancouver wishes to draw attention  
to the dangerous precedent which has  
been set in Canada by the R. vs. Pap-  
pajohn rape case. Although the Sup-  
reme Court upheld the conviction of  
Pappajohn, a decision was taken  
which is nothing short of incredible,  
and which poses a grave danger to  
all Canadian women. The Supreme Court  
judges agreed that if an accused rap-  
ist claims he honestly believed the  
woman consented to sex, then he need  
not provide any "reasonable grounds"  
for his belief. In other words, the  
would-be rapist can feel free to ig-  
nore his victim's begging for mercy,  
screams or kicks. All he need say is  
that, in spite of all the woman's  
protests, he honestly believed it  
was OK-- and he need not provide any  
grounds outlining why he believed it  
was OK.  

Not Hysterical Enough  

Being cool and together when cal-  
ling the police for help may not get  
the best results. A 13-year-old Miami  
girl found this out when she called  
the police complaint officer to re-  
port that there was a "kid" outside  
who was trying to break in her house  
where she was babysitting. Officer  
Glen Metzler who reportedly took the  
call says "She was so matter-of-fact  
and businesslike," that he routinely  
classified the call as a "34," a  
catch-all number for disturbances in  
which no one's life is in imminent  
danger. As a result, the police did  
not arrive until 40 minutes later,  
after the girl's mother called to re-  
port her daughter had been raped and  
stabbed to death. Officer Metzler has  
been relieved from duty pending an  
investigation.  

Weasel  

California state legislator Alan  
Robbins has hired private investiga-  
tors to look into the past of one of  
the teenagers who has accused him of  
seducing her. The California Demo-  
crat was indicted on multiple counts  
of unlawful sexual intercourse with  
a minor. Ironically, he is the auth-  
or of a state bill which forbids in-  
quiry into the sexual history of a  
rape victim.
