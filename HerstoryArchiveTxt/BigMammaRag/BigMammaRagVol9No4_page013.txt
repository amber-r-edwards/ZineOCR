Maquila Workers: Trapped By Sexist

Two aunts, Kica and Julia, are
production workers at cloth-
ing maquiladoras, as is Ros-
ario. They work to support
themselves and their chil-
dren while Rosario works in
the hope of moving to a bet-
ter home and affording her
brother a better education

than the one she was able to
get herself. They all now
live in a drab, two-room

adobe house in Juarez, Mexico,
in sight of the shimmering
skyline of El Paso, Texas.
Rosario must always consider
her family's situation.
When I see my mother and
aunts laugh and chat, I wish
we were always happy. But
the truth is that we have
many problems. Both Kica
and Julia were living here
when I ran away with Carlos.
He was my last hope! I
wanted to get married because
I thought my situation could
only improve. Carlos was a
student of architecture then.
The first time we went out

he took me to "Café d'Europa"
and ordered strawberries
with cream. I had two ser-
vings, just like an elegant
lady in a romantic novel.
At sixteen I became pregnant
and Carlos married me short-
ly afterwards. Then things
changed. Even before the
death of my baby, Carlos

had started to drink. He
dropped out of school and
could not support me. When
he finally left me there was
nothing to do but look for
factory work. I was fortun-
ate to land a job at RCA.
They were expanding produc-
tion and hiring people; all
women.

Many could not be placed
because they didn't have
enough education. But I
went to school for nine years
and have some knowledge of
typing and shorthand. For
a time I thought management
would find me a position as
a receptionist or secretary,
but you need to speak Eng-

The Women's Movement In

Lagunilla, Mexico, seems an

incongruous place for a wo-
men's group to exist. It is
a squatter community that
sits on a hilltop a few miles
outside of Cuernavaca, acces-
sible only by a rutted dirt
road built by the people of
this community with picks and
shovels and a few rented ma-
chines.

The women, some of them il-
literate and all of them poor,
discuss the projects their
group is currently working
on - most importantly, a fund-
raising drive for the comm-
unity center. They also con-
front their deep-seated no-
tions about their roles as
women, and challenge those
held by their husbands and
other men in the community.

A particularly heated discus-
sion breaks out over one wo-
man's report that she was de-
rided by several men for par-
ticipating in the women's
effort to build the community
center.

Lagunilla is not unique.
There are other examples of
grassroots women's groups in
Latin America attempting to
merge feminist concerns with
the broader issues that face
poor and working-class women.
Such groups are one component

of the region.

Today, what can loosely be
called the women's movement
consists of a diversity of
individuals and small groups
whose political orientations
span the spectrum from bour-
geois to Marxist feminist.

Here we will focus on those
groups which set as their
goal not just legal equality
for women, but women's true
liberation. By this we mean
the full participation of
women in all areas of social,
economic and political life,
implying a fundamental change
in the sex-based division of
labor, an end to women's sub-
ordination in the family, and
a change toward an egalitar-
ian culture and ideology.

In Latin America, status
for women is attached over-
whelmingly to the home and
family. This is reinforced
directly by the Catholic
Church and more subtly by
other institutions. Those who
would break with the stereo-
type face enormous economic
hardships; the job market,
dismal at best, is geared to
take advantage of and perpé-
tuate the conception of women
as supplementary income earn-

lish to be even considered
for that, so I guess I'll
have to keep on doing assem-
bly work.

My shift runs from 6:30 in
the morning to 3:30 in the
afternoon from Monday to Fri-
day. On Saturdays I work
from 6:30 to 11:30 a.m.--
forty-eight hours total in
every week. On Fridays I
get paid 1,001 pesos (slight-
ly less than $43). I give
my mother half my weekly
wage. Transportation, meals
at the factory and personal
expenses take care of the
rest. I am buying a stereo
system. At least I can pur-
chase that for myself. As
long as I work, I don't
think I will get married
again.

In Mexico, as a whole, less
than 1% of the women who work
in the industrial sector get
jobs as direct production op-
erators. In Ciudad Juarez,

by contrast, almost half of
the total workforce is com-
posed of women who work as
maquila operators.

Maquila Mythologies

Women workers are trapped
both by traditional suspicions
about their participation in
the world outside of home and
family, and by corporate pro-
grams designed to reinforce
the "submissive feminine" be-
havior that they have been
taught all their lives. Ac-
cording to one common opinion,
for example, the maquiladoras
program has effected a kind
of “emancipation" by afford-
ing women the opportunity to
earn their own income.
It is argued, can now spend
money on clothes, jewelry,

and entertainment. This has
led to the proliferation of
clothing stores, discotheques
and bars, an avalanche of con-
sumer advertising in local
newspapers, and a swarm of

ers, not as economically in-
dependent individuals. The
majority of women have had
little to do with the public
sphere of politics.

The Women's Movement

Although responding to the
very real oppression of wo-
men in their societies, the
Latin Americans who began to
organize around women's is-
sues in the 1970s took in-
spiration from the feminist
movement of the United States.
In Mexico, for example, where
the women's movement got a
relatively early start in
1971, consciousness-raising
groups were one of the early
forms of organization.

Today there are collectives
which publish newspapers
dealing with women's issues;
groups and individuals re-
searching the reality of wo-
men in the region; organiza-
tions sponsoring demonstra-
tions, producing educational
materials and running women's
centers; and activists organ-
izing women in poor and work-
ing-class communities.

There is a move to cohere
these diverse groups into
more effective coordinating
bodies, or at least to share
their experiences in order to

evolve toward a clearer un-
derstanding of women's op-
pression and a strategy for
addressing it. In Peru, a
Coordinator of Feminist Or-
ganizations was formed, com-
prising five different groups
with a common program on
women's rights, including
abortion and birth control.

Within the Catholic Church,
a group of activist women
from different Latin American
countries have joined forces
to combat sexism and promote
progressive positions within
the Church.

Issues that were once taboo
such as abortion and rape,
are now occasionally dis-
cussed in the media, and go-
vernments from Brazil to
Colombia to Mexico have been
forced to pay lip service
and make some legal conces-
sions to the goal of women's
equality.

Women's Issues, Class Base
The core of activists in
most Latin American women's
groups, as in the United
States, is composed primarily
of middle-class women. In the
United States, in the early
years at least, the mass base
was similarly middle-class.
This resulted in part from

seductive opportunists wait-
ing at the plant gates on

Critics of maquilas claim
that a role reversal takes
place which undermines tradi-
tional patterns of male auth-
ority and the overall cohe-
sion (staying together) of
the family. This is seen to
have harmful effects on the
“house husband's" sense of
manhood, but it is also de-
plored for the alleged nega-
tive effect it has on the wel-
fare of the children. Ac-
cording to this view, as wo-
men gain economic power,
daughters begin to challenge
the authority of parents,
wives refuse to comply with
the demands of their husbands
and, in general, disrespect
for “traditional values" be-
comes rampant. This is exten-
ded to accusations of growing
promiscuity and moral loose-
ness among maquila workers.

The Poor And Working Class

the size of the middle class,
and the fact that these women
were being drawn into an ex-
panding job market at unpre-
cedented rates. Thus the
movement focused on the iss-
ues particular to that real-
ity, making little conscious
effort, until recently, to
relate to the concerns of
poor and working-class women.

The Movement for the Liber-
ation of Women (MLM), which
has developed an educational
theater piece on abortion,
reported a very negative res-
ponse when they performed in
a middle-class neighborhood.
In contrast, the response in
one working-class barrio was
so positive that word of
mouth resulted in invitations
from several other neighbor-
hoods.

Latin American leadership,
on the contrary, has been
preoccupied from the begin-
ning with organizing the
working class, based on the
inextricable links between
the class oppression of this
vast majority of women and
their specific oppression as
women. Extreme poverty makes
life a daily battle for sur-
vival for the majority of
women in the region. Working
class women in the United

with worry, "There are those
who treat you differently as
soon as they know you have a
job at a maquiladora. Maybe
they think that if you have

to work, there is also a
chance you're a whore.

Public relations managers
for the maquiladoras have
countered these accusations
by pointing to specific poli-
cies implemented to reaffirm
the value of femininity and a
stable family life. Some co-
mpanies offer courses on hu-
man sexuality, birth control
and home economics to their
workers. Annual beauty con-
tests are held, and in many
plants, operators receive red
carnations on St. Valentine's
Day. As is clear by these
maneuvers, corporate-style
“liberation” and more tradi-
tional expressions of women's
oppression are reinforced.

In fact, the employment of
women in these transnational
assembly plants has not inevi-
tably led to gains in indepen-

States have often voiced mis-
trust of middle-class femi-
nists, but in Latin America
class conflict is much more
open and intense.

The cross-class women's
issues so closely linked with
the movement in the United
States and Europe - those
concerning women's control
over their bodies, such as
birth control, abortion,
rape and wife abuse - meet
with a very different social
context in Latin America.

First, the government-spon-
sored birth control and for-
ced sterilization programs
have left a legacy of hostil-
ity and distrust that now
surrounds the issue of wo-
men's right to control their
maternity. Second, there are
powerful social and religious
taboos against subjects re-
lated to sexuality. While 20
years ago in the United
States such restraint was
also pervasive, it has been
much harder to overturn in
Latin America. Millions of
women undergo illegal and
dangerous abortions every
year, yet it is still not
being frankly and openly
confronted.

Poor and working-class wo-
men's near-total lack of op-

dence. In the vast majority
of cases, single daughters
live with their parents and
siblings, fathers still being
the source of authority.
Mothers take care of daily
domestic expenses and do all
the housework. It is not
uncommon for a maquila wor-
ker to turn her wages over

to her mother, then receive
a small allowance. More than
100 married workers were in-
terviewed, out of which only
one woman lived in a situa-
tion where her male compan-
ion had taken full charge of
housework and childcare while
she acted as the sole provi-
der.

Women still too often see
their own position in the
workforce as temporary, a-
waiting marriage and mother-
hood, and their retirement
from the workforce. To be
confused for a prostitute
is cause for serious pro-
blems, as the limited econo-
mic options of working-class

women is the reality in which
they must come to terms with
their sexual identity.

Sexual harassment on the
job is the "norm." Women com-
plain that middle management
and supervisory personnel ask
for "sexual favors" in ex-
change for job security. Some women see their sexuality as their only visible
means to gain employment, and
offer themselves to men in
power. Loyalties won by the
employer through sexual entan-
glements are used to their
advantage to ensure efficiency
and docility from women on
the job. Thus it moves from
a moral issue to one with
vivid practical consequences.
Maggie, a maquila worker, sums
up the predicament that she
and her sisters confront on
a daily basis:

No matter how you look at it,
we are in a bind. Either as
husbands, lovers or managers,

men have power over us.

tions outside the family
makes them particularly un-
responsive to certain “fem-
inist issues." For example,
while willing to discuss

wife abuse, many women have
accepted it as a part of

life: Their reluctance to
sharply confront their hus-
bands and risk losing them
cannot be understood outside
this general economic de-
pendency.
