letters home to mama

And Sometimes We Do Good attempts to change and restructure

Dear Big Mama Rag,

This is a long overdue letter to let
you know I support the ways in which
you've been challenging the "work-
shirted, blue-jeaned, gotta-be-a-real-
Dyke" form of isolation that traps so many
of us in the Women's Movement are
comfortable in. I appreciate your
keeping up on all the legislative stuff
affecting women's lives and like
your coverage of economic issues and
your coverage of women's struggles in
other countries. There is more to life
than learning how to shoot a game of
pool.

I particularly liked your coverage
of the Feminist Economic Network, the
interview and story on forced sterilization
in Puerto Rico, and your update
last month on the Colorado Feminist
Credit Union was very helpful in understanding
the limitations of feminist
alternatives.

I think you are steadily growing in
becoming a solid, all-round feminist
newspaper. Keep up the good work.

Now for some suggestions.

In addition to matter-of-fact news,
I would like to see more articles
with analysis built into the story. I
would also like to see more articles
exploring different issues, rather
than playing it "safe" by reporting
on issues that already have pat answers.
One more suggestion would be
to have more casual stories like the
one last month with women talking
about how they deal with their fathers
and vice-versa—on how we are dealing
with everyday things in our

society.

One last minor thing is that BMR
always seems so cramped and squeezed
in with stories that it sometimes
makes it difficult to read. A little
looser perhaps?

Again, keep up the good work and
don't get discouraged by women coming
down on you for taking important
stands. Some women appreciate it.

In struggle,
Sandra Clark

Lest We Forget

Dear Editor,

This is in regard to the benefit
dance for Lesbian Custody Cases at the
Oxford Hotel, on August 2, 1977.

It is really offensive to have benefits,
and other events that are supposed
to be feminist, in places I can't go
because I am under 21. I think it
shows a real lack of consciousness on
the part of the women who organized
the benefit.

No one told me before that you have to
be 21 to be political.

Dear Big Mama,

A few weeks ago a woman casually
handed me a copy of BMR and suggested
I browse through it. I didn't,

Big Mama Rag Vol. 5 No. 7

I devoured it! It's newspapers like
yours that keep us in the hinter-
lands sane. What terrifies me is
that I've been in the movement four
years and just read BMR for the
first time. How many others are
there out there who have never seen
it and need so badly, as did I, to
read this type of radical-political-
news reporting?

Anyhow, after reading that first
fateful issue, I was able to deal
with some heavy issues, where I was moving, both literally,
politically, and personally. BMR would like to apologize for an
oversight that happened last issue.
In our spaced-out final hours of production, we neglected to add the names
of Bev and Jan to the Contributors box.
We blew it, but we just want them to
know that we still love ‘em.

Sincerely,
Sherry Kliegman
