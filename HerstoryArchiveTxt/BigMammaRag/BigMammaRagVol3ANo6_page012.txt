Don’t Nurture  
The Rapist

Ann Daniel

On June 11th The Denver  
Women's Resource Center, a  
Virginia Neal Blue Center, spon-  
sored a workshop entitled “Sex-  
ual Assault.” The speakers were  
Dr. Hannah Evans, a psychologist  
at Denver General Hospital,  
Richard Wood of the Denver  
District Attorney's office, and  
Ruth Campbell from the Sex  
Offense Unit of the Denver  
Police Department.

Dr. Evans pointed out that the  
attitude in the hospital has  
improved toward the victim due  
to the presence of a volunteer  
that waits with the victim until  
she is seen by a physician.  
Unfortunately, the waiting time  
has not lessened due to lack of  
emergency facilities.

Richard Wood spoke on the  
legal process of rape cases after  
they had been presented to his  
office. An attempt is made to  
keep the victim from testifying  
until a trial in order to keep the  
number of statements on record  
at a minimum. In a period of one  
to eight months, depending on  
when the case reaches the trial  
stage, insignificant details may  
be obscured in one’s memory  
but this nonetheless, is a TOOL  
OF THE DEFENSE TO BRING  
DOUBT ON THE CREDIBILITY OF  
THE VICTIM.

Plea bargaining may result in  
the defendant pleading to a  
lesser charge if the DA's Office  
considers this a one-time “un-  
usual event.” The victim may  
consent if hospital and psy-  
chiatric treatment are to be  
administered to the offender.  
However, at this point even if the  
victim wants to continue to press  
for full charges it is out of her  
hands. The lesser plea con-  
sideration is based on lack of  
evidence and the overriding  
concern is whether it's  
possible to prosecute him or not.

The two major categories that  
rape cases fall into are consent  
and identification. Consent is  
the one in which the defendant  
alleges that the victim con-  
sented. This type case is one in  
which the victim's past history is  
brought out. Legislation has  
recently passed both Houses on  
procedures to lessen victim  
repression. Cross-examination  
of the type that attempts to not  
only attack her credibility  
through her past, but even  
further, to discredit her, would  
be forbidden.

In the new legislation the term  
“rape” is replaced with “sexual  
assault” in the first, second and  
third degrees and child offense.  
The terms were changed to  
lessen the shame that often  
occurs by being referred to as a  
“rape victim.” To call the act  
assault stresses the violent  
aspect of the crime rather than  
the sexual.

Sexual assault has increased  
in the past year generally, but  
those on men and children are at  
record numbers. The age range  
is from 3 months to 95 years.  
One cannot help but wonder and  
be saddened by the implication  
here that legislation is being  
brought about that protects the  
victim since now a man and his  
children could very easily be  
victims.

As is too often true with  
Denver rape groups, the  
emphasis was primarily put on  
prevention via caution on the  
part of women and not a  
thorough look at the cause of  
rape. However, considering that  
the questions asked by the  
audience reflected a less than  
basic knowledge of rape, the  
presentation was excellent. For  
a refreshing change the  
emphasis was put on concern  
for the victim and the victim's  
family. The aspect that rape is  
not a sexual but rather a crime of  
violence was the basic premise  
of both Dr. Evans and Mr.  
Wood's talks. Dr. Evans ex-  
pressed that the offender  
derives gratification from hostili-  
ty and not sexual satisfaction.  
This situation meets the needs  
that he does not get in any other  
situation. She spoke of her own  
personal outrage at the crime  
but further of her outrage for her  
sisters in general. The most  
important preventive measure is  
to eradicate the image of women  
as nurturing, trusting creatures.  
Do not let a man with a heart-  
breaking story ever enter your  
heart and therefore, your home.  
Her message was: women, we  
do not have to sustain men but  
ourselves.

This was a very valuable  
workshop for the community.  
Hopefully, we'll see more of  
them.

Seventeen-year-old Debra  
Sue Lacy was tried last month in  
Sarasota, Florida, for the killing  
of her stepfather, Emmett  
Armstrong, in January this year.  
Although sixteen at the time of  
the shooting, she was tried as an  
adult, for first degree murder. If  
convicted, she would have been  
subject to a sentence of death, or  
imprisonment for life. Sarasota  
N.O.W. and the local Rape  
Prevention and Crisis Center  
publicized the case and raised  
funds for the defense.

Armstrong was a habitual  
drunkard, who had first raped  
Debra when she was eleven  
years old, while her mother was  
dying of cancer. He frequently  
beat Debra’s mother, Jesse Cox,  
her children and his own.  
Sometimes Jesse would gather  
the children and they would all  
sleep outside in an orange grove,  
to escape his abuses. When she  
died in 1971, juvenile  
authorities removed all the  
children except Debra from his  
custody for neglect, abuse and  
failure to support. Alone with  
him, Debra was beaten, raped  
and subjected to brutal sexual  
fantasies.

At the trial, two of  
Armstrong's daughters testified  
that, while they had lived with  
him, he had beaten them and  
made sexual advances to them.  
After Armstrong had first  
raped her, Debra tried to kill  
herself. On subsequent oc-  
casions she ran away from home  
but was always found and  
returned, sometimes by juvenile  
authorities and police, despite  
the obvious evidence that she  
had been severely maltreated.  
One psychiatrist, testifying at  
the trial, was moved to suggest  
that Debra’s action constituted  
“a plea for help.” Shortly before  
his death, Armstrong forced  
Debra to act out a particularly  
bizarre fantasy and, for the first  
time while sober, also threaten-  
ed to kill her.

Debra’s half-brother, Thomas  
Watson, shot Armstrong a few  
years ago when he found him  
beating his mother. Authorities  
brought no charges against  
Watson, asserting that the  
shooting had been in self  
defense.

On June 5 a seven-woman,  
five-man jury acquitted Debra on  
grounds of temporary insanity.  
Psychiatrists testified that she  
had never developed a moral  
conscience, normally derived  
from contact with parents,  
school, and social institutions  
such as the police and other  
governmental agencies. Her  
experience with Armstrong had  
taught her that “violence is an  
acceptable way to get what you  
want.” As a result, they conclud-  
ed, she had not known right from  
wrong at the time of the  
shooting.

Although she was tried as an  
adult, Debra has been declared a  
dependent child and placed in  
the custody of Sarasota juvenile  
authorities. She will remain in  
their charge until “suitable  
plans are made regarding  
whatever treatment is indicated  
for her.”

The anti-abortion group, Right  
to Life, has employed a full-time  
professional lobbyist in  
Washington, to add fuel to their  
strong Congressional campaign  
to make abortion illegal again.  
According to Bella Abzug, “Their  
lobby had a visible impact. . .  
Congress is caving in on this  
issue because it has not been  
hearing from supporters of legal  
abortion, especially women.”  
The Right-to-Lifers, well-  
funded, well-organized and sup-  
ported by major religious in-  
stitutions, have been conducting  
a letter campaign too. In some  
Congressional offices, mail is  
running 40-1 to criminalize abor-  
tion.

The National Abortion Rights  
Action League, the only national  
organization whose sole con-  
cern is to keep abortion legal,  
asks that you write your  
Representative in Congress and  
two Senators expressing your  
support for the Supreme Court  
decision which legalized abor-  
tion, and asking that they sup-  
port no legislation to overturn it  
or limit the rights of women to  
obtain abortions. Colorado  
Senators are Floyd K. Haskell  
and Gary Hart, and letters to  
them can be addressed to the  
United States Senate.

court. Mildred Hooper, the 7-  
year-old child who was raped by  
Wesler and the doctor who had  
treated Darren Wanrow were  
not permitted as witnesses.

On August 9, 1973 Wanrow  
was sentenced to two 25-year  
prison terms, to run concurrent-  
ly, and one mandatory 5-year  
sentence for use of a deadly  
weapon. Her case is now before  
the Washington State Appellate  
Court and the defense has asked  
that she be given a new trial. The  
decision is pending and should  
be announced in June. If the  
Appellate Court rules against a  
new trial, the defense intends to  
appeal to the Washington State  
Supreme Court. Wanrow is  
currently out on bond pending  
the appeal.

Yvonne Wanrow’s defense  
committee needs donations in  
order to have any chance of  
making a successful appeal.
