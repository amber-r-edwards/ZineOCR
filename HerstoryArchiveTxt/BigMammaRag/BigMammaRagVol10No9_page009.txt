What has happened. August
'82 in the 7th Michigan Fest-
ival should never happen to
any woman again. Women in Am-

erica have a terrific amount
of power and the rest of the
women in the world are watch-
ing you. You are leading and

you must be aware of it.
I came to you, all the wom-

en in Michigan - organizers,
artists and singers to sing
with you, to dance with you,
to give you my joy because
you make it all with all this
wonder of colors. I came to
you, all the women in the

States, to feel this incred-
ible energy you have created
on this part of the planet. I
came to feel myself tight in-
side your circle. You give me
life. I want to give you my
sound. I want to hear yours.
We, all the women in the
world, want to hear a new re-
sonance. We will get it.

I love you. I love you. My
name is Carmen.

Saturday night 14th August:
Ending the concert. Apotheo-
tic climax with the Latin
rhythm of CHEVERE, they in-
vite women to dance. I'm a
Latin myself. I feel trans-
ported with their Brazilian
rhythms, I feel my whole body
flowing, I have to express my
joy. I feel like dancing,
dancing.

Suddenly I feel the arms of
6 or 7 women holding my body
with their physical strength
and raping my joy energy with
obscure forces inside them.
They are choking me. I go
crazy. I begin to shout. Then
I realize that I have to calm
down. They are more excited
than I am. I say that to them
and they agree. I ask why they
did that to me. They answer
that I was too near the stage.
They let me go. Later I sleep
but I feel evil, death nearby.
Sunday 15th August: I wake up
sad, have coffee with a friend.
She is going to the Womb to
receive a chiropractic treat-
ment on her back. She feels
excited about being healed. I
accompany her and she wants my
company. I see a woman in the
Womb healing women's bones. I
feel that I might have a vert-
ebra displaced in my neck. I
know it has been oppressing my
throat chakra all my life.

I receive treatment. I feel
released, relaxed. I cry,
silently. Other women tell me
to lie down. They take my hand.

I think they want to help me.
I let them approach me. They
say I need help. I answer that
I'm OK. They insist. No, thank
you. We are going to take you
to the hospital. They surround
me. Now, I recognize the guar-
dians of the night stage who
have just arrived to "help" me.

I shout, "Not out of this
land, to a men's hospital."
They take me against my will.
They put me in a van. I ask
help from women watching the
scene. No one moves. They take
me to a hospital in Hart. They
talk to the doctors. They make
me be examined. The hospital
decides I'm OK and they let me
go. Women decide I'm not OK.
They don't allow me back on
the land.

They let me alone outside
Oceana Hospital, promising me
they will send my friends and
my things. Five hours later no
one has come. I send a written
message through two women from
the land I have met at the
restaurant near the hospital.

A message to all the women in
the festival. No answer. It's
getting dark. I'm cold. I be-
gin to walk. A family from
Vietnam takes me back to the
land.

What is this mess: I had never
in my life been taken to a
hospital for psychiatric
treatment for the simple fact
of letting my emotions out. I
never said that before. I was
not being dangerous to anyone.
I was not hurting myself. I
was just feeling in me the
healing energy of 9000 women.
What is happening? What is all
this mess inside women's en-
ergy? How can women take other
women to men and against their
wills? It seems it's become a
custom in the United States to
turn to mental hospitals out
of fear of energy and passion.

Women in the States pretend
they are open to other cult-
ures, and imitate them. But
when they really have inside
their circle someone from a
different culture, they put
these people into mental hos-
pitals because they act dif-
ferently from their norms. So,
they are repeating the same
patterns as the dominant cult-
ure organized by the patri-
archy. No victory over the
evil forces of this men's
world is possible without wo-
men's spiritual purification.
No peace on this earth until
the women's spirit brightens
again.

How are we going to achieve
purification? Going to the
center of ourselves. And a
main thing to get to know our
real self is purification of
the mind. Purification of our
minds takes us to our spirit,
the source, the origin of all
our energy. At the same time
we must purify the rest of
our chakras. We must cleanse
our emotions. Women are
afraid of the water. Women
are stuck on emotions. Women
are afraid of living them.
They think them dangerous. We
are still living the inherit-
ance that men have given us:
emotions are dangerous and
power is not for us.

We don't need all that from
them in ourselves. We must
stop now the political games.
Let's let the divinity flow
freely through our beings.
Women's energy is divine. It
is a round energy. It is love.
It is peace. Let us uncover
ourselves. This earth needs
us. Let us go to the source.
Let us dissolve our egos. Let
us begin a new era. Our time
has come. Wake up!

About our emotionality: what
do we do with "it"? Sure, we

have to live them out. Our e-
motions don't have to keep us
blocked in our flowing. We

let them take us to our sup-
erior energy. Never losing

touch with our center. We are
safe. If we are stuck on ma-

terial possessions, or in our
emotions or in sexuality, the
whole system is unbalanced.

We have constant tension in
ourselves. If we live right,
we live from our center, from
our spirit and all our energy
will flow in harmony, in abun-
dance, in joy.

More of the story of Michigan:
Five days after these events
took place, the festival fin-
ished. I am still on the land.
I am preparing to leave with
friends. We want to travel to-
gether. We are trying to rent
a car. I went swimming with
other women. I come back to
the land only to find out that
my tent and possessions are
gone. I go to the women and
ask them. Liza Vogel answers
me saying that my things are
safe. She takes me to my lug-
gage with other women around
her. There is a van waiting
for me. I have to leave the
land alone. I try to rent a
car. There is no possibility
of it for me alone. I need a
credit card and I am a for-
eigner. I am taken to the air-
port and eventually left in a
Rescue Mission in Muskegon un-
til the next morning my flight
takes me out of Michigan.

A last word: I want to say
this. Thank you every woman
that supported me with your
energy. Thank you to every hug
I received. I keep all of

Not Everyone Was

those in my heart. Thank you
to all the women who organized
meetings in the festival, cir-
cles, wrote articles in order
to make things change.

We are all responsible for
what has happened. Some for
doing. Others for letting
things happen. We should con-
tinue to work in this direc-
tion. We need to make a re-
ality of the Healing Tent Pro-
posal and this proposal must
be carried out by the women
who have elaborated it at the
festival. Not by others who
are mere executors and who
don't understand at all the
spirit of the proposal.

We need also to work on a
new stage proposal. How can
there be such a separation be-
tween music, public singers,
workers, women? Why do we
need guardians on a stage in
a women's land? Why do we
allow men inside the land?

Connie Panzarino

Lisa and Kristie Vogel:

The lives and needs and
hopes and dreams of a thousand
women are in your hands. Why?

What once was a four-day
City of Women built by love
and creativity is now a space
divided by power -

where purple privilege vies

with paying, slavery,

where women hear of the
national debts, of the

festival being in the "red,"

where there is not one work-

ing extension cord for a

respirator but there are

hundreds of working cords
for the stage.

When these things are true,
music becomes the monster for
which we must sacrifice just
as Reagan sacrifices aid to
the disabled for nuclear arms.
When these things are true,
the health and joy of women
are being robbed for the bene-
fit of the masses of women
who come to party and get high
on the music.

Is it really the music which
is so costly?

Lisa and Kristie Vogel: who
are you "dedicated" women
raising money for a land fund,
a land which will support Co-
ca-Cola, Budweiser, racism
and ableism?

Why do you both remind me
so much of Jerry Lewis!

Why do I mistrust your ded-
ication?

Why were there women to un-
load trucks of soda and beer,
and no one to empty the dif-

ferently-abled toilets?

Why do we absolutely need e-
lectricity?

Singers: Let's find our own
sound. We don't need any e-
lectricity because the natur-
al resonance of thousands and
thousands of women in harmony
with music is the purest and
strongest. Let's use again
our natural resources, our
natural treasures.

Women: The purest and most
perfect resonance for sound
does not lie on any instru-
ment or high speakers. It
lies in the human body. The
whole human body is a per-
fect resonating instrument.
In the same way that the
mind can hear the thinking
of another mind without
speaking, when we hear a

voice singing, we are hear-
ing the purity of her mind.
The main resonance of the

body is on the bones of the
face and in the skull. The

air coming up from the belly
to the head strikes these
bones and produces the beauty
of the sound. The feeling
supports and gives life to
melody. What gives life to
melody, what makes a sound
clear and beautiful is the
purity of our resonance. and
it's not only the emitting
voice. All the women receiv-
ing the sound enlarge the
beauty.

Can you imagine achieving
that feeling of unity and to-
tality that makes thousands
of women vibrate together in
one sound? Is this not final-
ly what we are looking for?
Let us put our own energy
into creation.

Why was I asked at the gate,
as I sat in my wheelchair in
my special van, if I could
walk! My answers to such in-
sulting questions must have
gotten passing grades, for I
was deemed eligible to camp
in the isolated, "special,"
segregated area for disabled
women.

Why did I risk my life to
be in a place where women not
only could not meet my needs,
but where the power structure
at the top invalidated them
over and over again?

Holly Near, who "looks to
us in courage," did not stop
her performance when cameras
were flashing - causing epil-
eptic women to have seizures.
Why did the coordinators for
the disabled have to get
clearance from the Vogel sis-
ters before an announcement
could be made to stop the
flashing?

Women who do not delegate
responsibility and authority
are heavily invested in main-
taining their own power.

You ask women to donate to
buy you land. Thousands of
women have invested in it
for seven years. Yet we
have nothing to say on how
our money is spent. I will
not give my money, time and
energy to a place which
echoes the women-hating op-
pressions of the world as it
is.

I will put my strength to-
ward women in my own commun-
ities. We will sing to one
another around small bon-
fires. We will read our
poems in living rooms. And
we are healing each other
of the abuses of the Michi-
gan Womyns' Music Festival.

I, as a disabled woman,
cannot survive without a
working ambulance.

I will not be asked to
perform superhuman feats
such as bouncing over mis-
laid snow fencing, breathing
air that is causing able wo-
men to gag, or climbing a
mountain to get to the cen-
ter of what is supposed to
be a differently-abled sup-
port group, but which is
really a place designed to
dissolve our anger and ap-
pease us with making us feel
like we are a part of some-
thing we can't even get to.
One woman said, "The coordin-
ators just don't know our
needs and if we would only
tell them, it would be bet-
ter next year." I have writ-
ten lists and have been a

free telephone consultant
for four years and I know
other women who have done so
for seven.

Ability counts at Michigan.
That is why the deaf women
now have interpreters. The
interpreters are able, and
have fought for the deaf
and their own jobs. Atten-
dants are beginning to fight
for women in wheelchairs. No
one is fighting for the
blind, whose mobility needs
are as equal to those of
women in wheelchairs. When
an epileptic woman was hav-
ing difficulty with her en-
vironment, the solution, she
was told, was for her to
camp with the other epilep-
tics!

Women are being divided,
invalidated, and their anger
is being turned against one
another. Differently-abled
women are in a position now
of risking their lives to
continue to attend, or of
giving in to the ableism of
8,000 women.

The festival is not acces-
sible.

Why isn't the festival ac-
cessible? Since 20% of the
general population is dis-
abled, 20% of the festival-
goers should be disabled.
This festival cannot even
handle less than 1% differ-
ently-abled women.

I want my money back. I
want reimbursement for my
travel and the motel bills
I had to incur to save my
life.

And I want Kristie and
Lisa Vogel to be strapped in
a wheelchair and walked over
the land by two "helpful,
untrained attendants." Then
I would like them to be
blindfolded and sent off to
find an empty toilet. By
the time they are ready to
break down and go to the
hospital, I sincerely hope
there is an ambulance avail-
