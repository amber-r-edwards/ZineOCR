Open Letter

We have been urged, by  
Chocolate, to keep in view  
issues of censorship. It is  
true that Woman to Woman has  
a responsibility to provide  
literature without images  
that are harmful to women.  
Political decisions con-  
cerning the nature of our  
inventory are made daily.

We include or exclude lit-  
erature based on its charac-  
ter relative to racism,  
anti-semitism, classism,  
ageism, homophobia, etc. This  
we do not see as censorship,  
but as an expression of our  
commitment to provide al-  
ternatives. For this en-  
deavor, except to the ex-  
tent that we fail in our  
scrutiny, or misrepresent  
due to omission, we are gen-  
erally not criticized.

It is important to note  
that we have decided to re-  
move Sapphistry and Choco-  
late's cards from our  
shelves, on a tentative  
basis, out of response from  
the community. These de-  
cisions were not generated  
solely from within. Origi-  
nally, Sapphistry was order-  
ed and placed on the shelves,  
with the intent of providing  
it to the community. Choco-  
late's cards were placed on  
our shelves, by Chocolate,  
where they remained. Short-  
ly after appearing on our  
shelves, debate ensued, both  
within the collective and the  
community. A number of women  
came to us requesting that  
these items be removed from  
the store. We responded to  
these requests, with removal

Dear Big Mama Rag,

Enclosed is the very first  
issue of CONNEXIONS! It's  
been months since you announ-  
ced its arrival in BMR. It  
took a long time to get to  
stage one, but here it is  
and we are all very excited.

Please look CONNEXIONS  
over. We'd be interested in  
hearing what you think. This  
is our special introductory  
issue; issue #1 will be pub-  
lished June 21.

We have a favor to ask of  
you. We would like as many  
people as possible to see  
CONNEXIONS. We've been ac-  
tively promoting it in the  
San Francisco Bay Area, tak-  
ing it to bookstores, forums,

cover:

festivals and other events.  
Unfortunately, we're geogra-  
phically restricted, so  
we're asking people across  
the country to help us out.

By the way, I read that  
you haven't received any re-  
sponse re: your new layout.  
I think it's a vast improve-  
ment! Now I can read it in  
bed without going through  
contortions. It's easier to  
hold and visually more pleas-  
ing and certainly much eas-  
ier to layout.

From Woman To Woman

pending further discussion,  
in an attempt to reach con-  
sensus. Many of us are deep-  
ly concerned with the issue  
of censorship. Many of us  
feel that these items are  
appropriate for our store.  
Others feel a commitment to  
provide individual response  
to community requests. Some  
are concerned with the pro-  
pornography and pro-sado-mas-  
ochism stance within Sapphis-  
try, and the negativity with-  
in Chocolate's card, which  
they feel are anti-feminist.  
We are attempting, during  
this interim, to use our proc-  
ess, so as not to be arbit-  
rary in our decisions. When  
some say "carry it" and others  
say "don't", we are in  
a difficult position. We  
cannot half-carry a book or  
ecard. The strength of col-  
lective process is consensus;  
the strength of individual  
women often makes consensus  
difficult to reach.

These items may be returned  
to our shelves. We are cur-  
rently working toward a sol-  
ution. As always, we welcome  
input from the community.  
Call the store to share your  
information about ordering  
Sapphistry directly from  
Naiad Press.

Woman to Woman Collective

Editors' Note: "Providing  
'feminist' literature" has  
been stated as a goal of  
Woman to Woman and that goal  
is not a contradiction to  
the idea of "providing lit-  
erature which is not harmful  
to women."

our various political groups  
structures, we are constant-  
ly having to redefine and re-  
articulate our conception of  
feminism, fill in the details  
of issues previously neglec-  
ted. In all the decisions

we make concerning our lives  
and our work, we are expres-  
sing our position.

This whole issue boils  
down to the question, what  
are we as a political pro-  
ject trying to accomplish?

We need to clearly define  
our goals, define the unify-  
ing political points that we  
in our various projects are  
assuming to be basic to our  
work together.

These goals provide the  
boundaries for our defini-  
tion of our "community". We  
make daily decisions based  
on how we feel our goals  
can best be achieved, and  
are accountable to our com-  
munity for those decisions.

The process of reaching  
consensus with collective  
structure is definitely a  
problem we can relate to,  
it is difficult, and we sup-  
port you in your struggle  
toward working it out.
