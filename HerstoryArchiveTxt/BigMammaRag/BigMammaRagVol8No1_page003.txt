We Would Like To Hear From You

—=_-

Dear Sisters,

Thank you for stating in your news-
paper that the subscription is free
to women in prison! I am a member of
a defense committee for a lesbian
serving 7 years at Bedford Hills Cor-
rectional Institute for defending
herself from the attack of a violent
man. Unfortunately for her the man
died and the courts found her guilty
of manslaughter.

I've read your paper many times and
know that she will like it. At the
present time we do not have a news
release ready but as soon as it is
done you will be among the first
recipients.

Again--thank you for making your
paper available to our sisters in
prison.

In sisterhood,

Kt. Vermenlen

ing your press release.

Dear Mama Rag,

I'm in the O.R.W. in Maryville, OH.
Unfortunately this is my second time
around but I'm happy to say I've had
a chance to read a few of your pub-
lications in which I've found to be
very newsworthy, enlightening and
very interesting. Congratulations
for doing such a good job. I'm def-
initely going to check it on the
streets.

A woman in my cottage receives your
publications but she'll be leaving
soon. I'm unable to pay for your
copies as yet so could you place me on
your mailing list? I also have a good
friend up here who is very interested
in your publications and would also
like to be placed on your mailing list.
Your newspaper was just what she was
looking for to tell the women her
story. It would make a nice X-mas
present for her for she is doing a lot
of time. Thank you very much, and
keep up the good work.

Sincerely,
Pamela Smith

Ed. Note: You and your friend's names
have been added to the subscription
list. The April issue of Big Mama Rag
is going to be featuring women in
institutions. We would welcome articles
about your struggles and problems

with health, child custody, race and
nationality issues, vocational pro-
grams, all concerns of women in prison.

Discussion Stirred
About Therapy

Dear Women,

The last issue was most interest-
ing--particularly the articles by
Constance Perenyi on alcoholism and
on therapy. The latter stirred much
discussion here, and much agreement.
We would state the case even more
strongly. We believe therapy and
feminism to be mutually exclusive in
conception--focusing on the personal
makes one politically useless. We
agree with Mary Daly that crisis cen-
ters and crisis counseling is valu-
able--such as for rape, divorce, etc.
Otherwise we need self-help networks
to help our changing, growing, evolv-
ing selves. As Constance pointed
out so well, any therapy situation
implies someone with answers. We
need to know there are no answers to
the shit men have made here. Our
only weapons for survival are our
anger and our feminism. No solut-
ions, a lot of pain. We must make
our own strength and stop looking
for our hidden flaws in ourselves.

We look forward to more of Perenyi's
articles.

Anti-Christmas
Carol Correction

Dear BMR,

Just a reminder--Callie said she
asked you all to print a correction
about the anti-Christmas carols.
"The First Hard Sell" and "Jingle
Coins" were written by the Family
Circus Theatre Collective of Portland,
Oregon. The rest were by us.

Also, Callie says she has a sub-
scription to BMR, but we haven't
gotten the January issue yet...?

In love and struggle,

Ed. note: We did not publish a Jan-
uary issue of BMR as was announced in
our December issue. We spent the month
of December restructuring our process,
working on our politics, cleaning our
office, and buying some new drafting
tables.

The Trouble With
Bars...Anywhere

Dear Chocolate,

I, and I'm sure many others have
been seething since your article
appeared in BMR. The space, the bold
type and the emphasis on your name
certainly suggested that BMR agreed
with your uninformed, irresponsible,
politically un-astute and totally
lacking in sisterhood article.

I have run women's bars in St. Louis
for almost 10 years; therefore, I
must certainly know from whence I
speak.

My first bone of contention is with
your reference to logistics. Women's
bars, owned by gay women, in my exper-
ience, (and I've been everywhere, in-
cluding Denver) are always owned by
women who can't afford to be in the
bar business. I've heard hundreds of
women over my many years, women with
money, talk about opening a bar. They
never do it, they just talk about it.
Only caring or financially naive wo-
men open women's bars! Bars don't
grow on quiet cozy corners. To open
a bar, isolated from the Pepsi Colas,
the Joes Electric Shops of the world,
would cost a fortune. After you hear
my story I wonder if you will be-
lieve that were someone to have the
money would the cost be justified?

To be able to afford opening a bar
that has not already had the plumbing,
the electricity, etc., set up in some
way could be a financial disaster.

And then there are licensing laws

that certainly affect how and where
you can open a bar. Let me speak to

A seal,

the realities.

My first endeavor was above a faggot
owned bar. I went there first because
it was financially expedient. The
"Top of the Bull" a cozy attractive
bar in East St. Louis might still be
open had I been willing to frequently
kiss a faggot's ass. I wasn't--it
isn't. I was then offered a place by
the straight male owner of a gay club.
The "Bottom of the Pot" was in the
"rathskellar" or basement of the
Potpourri. Politically this place
seemed expedient. It was in an area
considered the "gay Amerika" of St.
Louis. Parking was impossible, and
the male customers of the Potpourri
upstairs hated it that women had
taken part of what they considered
theirs. The fights were constant
between myself and the fellows who
ran the upstairs. Women didn't know
about this. This place was popular,
but certainly not without many prob-
lems. At last, I was able to grad-
uate to a place I felt would be all
ours. For women only! There were
no faggots close, in fact no bars
or businesses close. No Pepsi Colas
or Joes. But it was in a predomin-
antly Black neighborhood. Many
women would not come in at all be-
cause this was true, and many of
these women were Black. To be able
to survive the financial risk of
this place I had to live in the base-
ment, and I mean a basement basement,
of this place for 5 months. A fact
which aided in ending the only long
term relationship I sustained in all
the years I was in the bar business.
Living in this basement also caused
the initial infection that eventually
killed what was most precious to me,
my dog. I say most precious because
I certainly suffered more at her
passing than from the passing of
anyone else. I was on a financial
shoestring but I cared--cared that
there be someplace for women to get
