From Reverence to Rape

“Most women have no  
characters at all,” wrote Alex-  
ander Pope, indulging in one of  
the more spiteful pleasures men  
derive from their dictation of  
what women shall be: despising  
them for what they become. In  
“From Reverence to Rape,”  
Molly Haskell traces what  
women have become over the  

decades of motion picture  
development:  
From the woman-  

oriented “progressive”  
twenties, from the sexual  
confidence and equality of  
the thirties, to the suspicion  
and sense of betrayal of the  
forties (and a consequent  
portrayal of women as  
predators), films move,  
forward and backward, to  
the repressed and distorted  
sexuality of the fifties, and  
finally to the “liberated”  
sixties and seventies and  
the current nadir in the  
presentation and represen-  
tation of women in films.  
Haskell notes that there are  
fashions in women as there are  
fashions in clothes. Looks and  
character can change radically  
and quickly to conform to new  
social/male expectations, a  
process intensified, accelerated  
and reflected by films. Men’s  
demands have forced women  
through endless variations on  
masculine “ideals” and terrors,  
but the final phase is a vanishing  
point where real women cease  
to conform and men try to  
imagine them out of existence.  
According to Haskell, the  
present degraded image of  
women in films — where there  
are any women at all — is the  
result of men’s resentment of  
and resistance to women's in-  
creasing power in reality. She  
notes that the surface feminiza-  
tion of contemporary men, large-  
ly political in origin, seems to  
have had the effect of rendering  
women not more acceptable, but  
unnecessary. In the  
violence/buddy films of the last  
few years the men provide the  
female elements themselves  
and women are often nowhere:  
objects of violence and contempt  
when they do appear.  
Essentially a feminist, Haskell  
is also a film enthusiast, so  
much so that she forgives or  
interprets favorably more than  
other feminists might. For exam-  
ple, her view of the earlier (and  
from a woman's standpoint,  
better) films is like taking a  

BMR Apology

Big Mama Rag owes an  
apology to Nancy Hutchinson.  
Nancy performed at the In-  
stallers Benefit last month, but  
all mention of her was cut from  
our review. This was tacky of us,  
particularly since Nancy not only  
performed, but MC’d the affair.  
She also was instrumental in the  
initial organization of the enter-  
tainment and served in the  
capacity of sound technician for  
Asterik, the band which played.  
When a woman gives of her  
energy and talents to help her  
sisters, she deserves at least to  
be recognized. We do that now.  
Thank you, Nancy.

determinedly bright view of bad  
luck — it could have been so  
much worse. Of the actresses  
and their roles of the thirties that  
she admires, she says that we  
remember the executives and  
politicians they played, not the  
mandatory defeat (the marriage)  
at the end of the film.

It might possibly be said, too,  
that Haskell (and maybe other  
feminists) underestimates the  
force of men’s control over both  
what women must be and how  
they must be portrayed. She  
believes, for instance, that the  
strong women's roles in the  
films of the thirties existed  
because there were many  
women involved in films at that  
time, especially in writing.  
However, she mentions that, like  
most successful women today,  
these writers were mostly non-  
political with regard to feminism  
— and men found strong women  
more or less allowable in the  
thirties. The times were grim  
and men needed women’s help.  
A clinging vine was a liability.  
The films of the fifties reflect not  
only the “repressed and dis-  
torted” sexuality that Haskell  
noted, but an increasing  
prosperity. Men no longer cared  
to share their glories — such as  
they were — and women were  
squeezed back into a near-  
Victorian position, role-bound  
and indeed repressed. Male-  
permitted “liberation” dis-  
appears with depressing rapidity  
when the permission is  
withdrawn.

In a side trip away from her  
chronological tracing of women  
in films, Haskell takes a chapter  
to treat the usually ignored and  
despised “women’s films.” She  
points out, among other things,  
that when such films are made  
about men they are called “psy-  
chological drama” and con-  
sidered important. The reader  
can take a certain melancholy  
pleasure in seeing women’s  

films, with the sad fantasies they  
offered women, seriously and  
sympathetically analyzed:  
revenge for neglect and con-  
tempt, deeply buried fantasies of  
rejecting unwanted children, of  
the love of unthreatening men,  
even of respect and esteem for  
themselves.  

Haskell ends with a challenge.  
Can anything be done about all  
this? She has made a start  
herself, pinpointing and analyz-  
ing with considerable insight.  
“From Reverence to Rape” may  
become one of the basics of  
feminist literature.

Woman To Woman

The Bookstore

Ann Daniel

Are you tired of not being able  
to get feminist literature and  
recordings at local outlets?  
Your frustrations are over. On  
the fifteenth of August, Woman  
to Woman, a women’s book  
center and switchboard will be  
open for business. Among the  
items available will be Meg  
Christian's album, the women’s  
Bible, lesbian literature, and  
news of what's happening  
around the country through  
women's periodicals. Also  
available will be non-sexist  
children’s books and an array of  
non-racist and non-classist  
literature. If they don’t carry a  
specific title, then point it out.  
Suggestions are welcome on  
books that are not stocked.

More than a bookstore,  
Woman to Woman will house a  
switchboard that will act as a  
referral service. Any  
organizations that have as yet  
not been approached that would  
like to be on the referral list,  
contact the switchboard at 320-  
5972.

In addition, the book center  
will have a bulletin board with  
listings for housing, jobs, rides,  
services, events, animals, etc. It  
is hoped that a crash list can be  
created for women coming to  
town and needing a place to  
stay. If you want an opportunity  
to meet women from  
everywhere, let it be known by  
calling the switchboard.

On top of that, the book center  
will incorporate artists’ work on  
consignment to add to the  
overall comfort and diversity of  
the place. If you have anything to  
display, here is the place for you.

Discounts

Most important, if you have  
little coins, Woman to Woman  
offers a 20% discount on books  
(but not recordings, unfor-  
tunately) for women on Welfare  
and Food Stamp recipients. And  
if you have no coins at all, the  
center is open to women who  
want to come in and read and  
listen to albums at leisure. After  
all, the point is to provide a place  
for women to meet, learn, relax,  
exchange. So come on in and

have a cup of coffee and spend  
time with your sisters.  
Help Needed

A further hope for the book  
center is to develop by fall  
basement space that is available  
for use as a coffee shop and/or a  
space to hold classes and show  
films. If you're interested in  
holding a class or workshop, call  
320-5972 and express your in-  
terest.

As is too often the case,  
however, resources are hard to  
come by and a lot of support is  
needed to keep going. This is not  
a profit project for Peg and Vicki,  
the initiators. In fact, they are  
sinking their own bucks into an  
effort that is not even going to  
pay them a wage. The purpose,  
rather, of the center is to provide  
an information exchange, a  
forum for meeting women, both  
local and from other places, and  
a social gathering place. Women  
are desperately needed to staff  
the store and switchboard.  
Carpenters are needed to help  
with bookshelves and the  
development of the basement. If  
you have a few hours give them

to the center and thereby to  
yourselves. If we can spend  
money in restaurants and  
theatres that are often alien to  
women then why can’t we  
support our own efforts?

In response to this call, the  
Colorado Women’s Festival  
Committee has pledged 50% of  
their profits outright from this  
summer's festival. The remain-  
ing 50% will be on loan to the  
center for their use until next  
summer when it will be returned  
to help next year’s festival  
happen. Let's all reinforce this  
support in any way we can. If you  
have time and a skill or time and  

energy, let's do it.

The location is 2023 East  
Colfax and the hours are Tues-  
day through Saturday, from 10  
to 8. Although the center is  
opening the 15th of August, look  
for a grand opening celebration  
event in September.

Special thanks for painting  
and bringing the center this far  
go to: Laura, Kim, Clare, Karyn,  
Ann, Wood, Lydia, Angela, Jude,  
Edna, Peggy, Vicki, Casey, and
