‘Ellen R. Craig

On January 19, 1981, Sena-
tor Jesse Helms (R-NC) and
Representative Henry Hyde
(D-IL) introduced bills to
the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives, respectively,

which have as their stated

intent "To provide that hu-
man life shall be deemed to
exist from conception.”

S. 158 and H.R. 900 are
worded exactly the same, and
read as follows:

"Be it enacted by the Sen-

ate and House of Representa-
tives of the United States of

America in Congress assembled,
that title 42 of the United
States Code shall be amended
at the end thereof by adding
the following chapter:
Chapter 101

"Section 1. That Congress
finds that present-day scien-
tific evidence indicates a
significant likelihood that
actual human life exists from
conception.

"The Congress further finds
that the fourteenth amendment
to the Constitution of the
United States was intended
to protect all human beings.
"Upon the basis of these
findings, and in the exercise
of the powers of Congress,
including its powers under
section 5 of the fourteenth
amendment to the Constitution
of the United States, the
Congress hereby declares that
for the purpose of enforcing

the obligation of the States
under the fourteenth amend-
ment not to deprive persons
of life without due process
of law, human life shall be
deemed to exist from concep-
tion, without regard to race,
sex, age, health, defect, or
condition of dependency; and
for this purpose ‘person’ —
shall include all human life
as defined herein.
"Section 2. Notwithstanding
any other provision of law,
no inferior Federal court or-
dained and established by Con-
gress under Article III of
the Constitution of the United
States of America shall have
jurisdiction to issue any re-

straining order, temporary

or permanent injunction, or

declaratory judgment in any
case involving or arising

from any State law or munici-
pal ordinance that (1) protects
the rights of human persons
between conception and birth,
or (2) prohibits, limits, or
regulates (a) the performance
of abortions, or (b) the pro-
vision at public expense of
funds, facilities, personnel,
or other assistance for the
performance of abortions.

"Section 3. If any provision
of this Act or the application
thereof to any person or cir-
cumstance is judicially deter-
mined to be invalid, the val-
idity of the remainder of the
Act and the application of
such provision to other per-
sons and circumstances shall
not be affected by such deter-
mination.”

S. 158 and H.R. 900 were
referred to the judiciary
committees of the Senate and
House, chaired respectively
by Strom Thurmond (R-SC) and
Peter Rodino (D-NJ). On April
23, 1981, S. 158 is scheduled
to come before the full Sen-
ate.

These bills, if enacted,
would allow the States to pass
and enforce laws that would;
by deeming life to begin at
the moment of conception, de-
clare abortions to be a form
of homicide and any woman
who permitted or any doctor
who committed an abortion
could be prosecuted to "the
fullest extent of the law."
Furthermore, certain birth
control devices, such as the
IUD and several types of pills
could be rendered illegal, if
the interpretation of "human
life be deemed from concep-
tion" is taken to mean life
begins the moment an egg is
fertilized by the sperm, ra-
ther than when the fertilized
egg is implanted in the womb.

Clearly these bills seek
to destroy any control a woman
might now have over her body,
and her own life. Under the
guise of protecting the un-
born, the bills if enacted,
would strip from all women
the matter of choice in child-
bearing: if a woman is terri-
fied that her baby might be
born with some type of deform-
ity because of her own expos-
ure to disease or other harm-
ful elements, she could not
legally obtain an abortion
since "defect" is disregarded
as a basis for depriving an
unborn child of life. Also
completely disregarded is the

New Human Life Bills Threaten Women

deprivation of life that might
result from a woman's being
compelled to carry a preg-
nancy to term when doing so
could possibly even kill her.
Section 2 of the bills is
conveniently designed to deny
to the Federal Courts any
jurisdiction over legal chal-
lenges to these bills should
they become law. Any such
challenges would then have to

come only through state courts

and the steps involved in ta-
king such challenges through
these courts and eventually
to the Supreme Court are in-
credibly costly and time con-
suming.

It is ironic that now, when
the clamor against government
intervention into the lives
of citizens is at a peak, and
the pressure is on to cut
back Federal assistance and
aid to the poor, the very
old, the very young, and
other "disadvantaged dispen-
sables" in our society, there
is also great clamor to let
the Congress decide in the
question of abortion. There
is much ado over the rights
of the unborn; there is much
silence over the right of a
child who, once born, cannot
be properly fed, clothed, or
cared for because the Govern-
ment can no longer afford

who cannot work because the
economy is so burdened by in-
flation, and on and on. These
bills defend the right of
the unborn, but say nothing
about the right of the born
to be sustained -- and to
those who are responsible
for the sustenance of the
life they bear, the Govern-
ment states -- that is your
problem. No matter that you
are only 13 years old, or 33
and a victim of rape, or 53
and not healthy enough to
survive giving birth. You
have no rights, no protection,
and if these bills are enacted
into law, you have no choice
but to go back to the era of
the coathanger and the friend-
ly neighborhood butcher.
Should such a thing happen,
we shall have Senator Helms
and Representative Hyde to
thank, and whoever gives
enough support to get these
bills legislated. But we do
have time, yet, to offer
something other than our
“thanks" -- and that is to
offer our protest. We owe
that much -- to ourselves
and to every woman and every
child who has ever suffered
because concern is so easily
given to the quantity rather
than the quality of human ex-
istence.
