Politics Of Feminist Bisexuality from page uw  

What I left out about bi's: |  
In this article I have fo-  

cused mainly on bisexual wo-  
men who decide to relate to  
men after being lesbians. I  
haven't talked much about the  
many women who feel bisexual  
but are only with women. The  
reasons for their choice  
(male sexism and fear of re-  
jection from lesbians) I have  
covered. There may be other  
reasons: I also haven't  
talked about how hard it is  
to stay out of sex roles with  
a man. I spent so much time  
talking about the contradic-  
tions between the women's  
community and women who re-  
late to men because it is  
such a sensitive issue and  
needs to be openly explored.  
Sometimes I'm not sure if bi-  
sexuals are getting "the best  
of both worlds," or the worst.  
I have got more support  
from lesbian-feminists than  
I ever expected, even with  
the “ignorant comments" and  
gossip that came down. This  
to me shows that we are ready  
to deal in a concrete, speci-  
fic way with the lesbian/  
straight split in the women's  
movement.  
IF: Lesbians who talk about  
"reaching out" to straight  
women, will “reach in" in-  
stead, to see that their  
unconscious attitudes of dyke  
superiority block any possi-  

bility of unity. When a dyke  
thinks of men as boys and  
pricks, she thinks of a wo-  
man who is with a boy/prick  
as a FOOL. Women are percep-  
tive enough to know when they  
are thought of as fools - we  
get it all the time from men.  
IF: Lesbians can realize that  
heterosexual women also have  
courage, in trying to strug-  
gle with their men, in trying  
to form equal relationships.  
Lesbians should be, and are  
grateful, that these women  
are doing the intimate, day-  
to-day “dirty work."  

IF: Straight women realize  
what a fantasy their male  
privilege is, and how homo-  
phobia holds back their pol-  
itical and personal growth.  
If they can see that the les-  
bian "strike" against men  
gives their demands for  
change that much more credi-  
bility. "Shape up, jack - I  
can always ship out.”  

IF: This article made you an-  
gry or made you think, it  
created energy for the wo-  
men's movement, and didn't  
rob you of anything.  

I don't trust lesbian fem-  
inists not to be smug. Les-  
bian feminists don't trust  
bisexuals not to desert the  
movement. We have little  
reason to trust each other  
except on the basis of fem-  
inism. Bisexual and straight  

Boulder Action from page 5  

in the action later said  
that she had been a little  
afraid that passers-by might  
try to stop them from attack-  
ing "private property". She  
said she was surprised and  
heartened when she finally ~  
looked up and saw that a  
crowd had gathered, and they  
were all cheering and giving  
them support.  

More support was given for  
the action when later another  
group formed and called for  
a sit-in at the display to  
demand its removal. During  
the sit-in, the police were  
called who came and threaten-  
ed and harassed the group to  

leave. When they refused, one  
man who was participating was  
arrested, when a cop tripped  
on him deliberately. This  
effectively broke up the sit-  
in, and the group left to re-  
organize.  

After they left, the campus  
stationed three armed guards  
at the display, beside and at  
the top and bottom of the  
stairs leading to it.  

Since further arrests seemed  
likely, the group changed  
its strategy and a leaflet  
was written and passed out  
around the clock for the rest  
of the week, when the display  
was scheduled to be removed.

five. Lora is the mother of  
a three-year-old child. Both  
women have lived in Mexico  
and are prepared to work as  
midwives there in the future  
if the practice of midwifery  
in the United States becomes  
too difficult.

feminists are not going to  
desert feminism, because we  
need an outlet for our anger  
and frustration. We've gone  
through too much, coming  
awake, to want to fall a-  
sleep again, even if we  
could. I lost my male lover  
to patriarchy - he couldn't  
or wouldn't let go of it.  
But I'll be DAMNED if I'll  
let fake male privilege  
split me off from what will  
ALWAYS be more important to  
me than ANY lover: the poss-  
ibility of a revolution  
against capitalism and patri-  
archy. Feminism is at the  
center of my dreams. When  

we realize that all rela-  
tionships between people are  
unequal unless we confront  
and struggle with that in-  
equality, we realize that  
feminism makes the differ-  
ence. It's hard, but we have  
a lot to gain - and nothing  
to lose but our illusions.

other women and men who by  
their inspired insights and  
ignorant comments helped me  
shape these ideas.  

about the  
cover artist  

Born in 1876 in Dresden,  
Germany, Paula Modersohn-  
Becker expressed an early  
interest in art, and at the  
age of 20, studied at the  
Berlin School of Art for  
Women. After her first  
trip to Paris to visit art-  
ists' studios, she married;  
but soon returned to Paris.  
An independent woman in  
both her lifestyle and her  
art, she left her family  
behind to develop her  

strong imagery - largely,  
rustic paintings of village  
and working women, women  
in various stages of preg-  

nancy, and women with  
children. In 1906, she be-  
came pregnant herself, and  
soon returned to Germany.  
Three weeks after giving  
birth to a daughter, Moder-  
sohn-Becker died of a heart  
attack. She left behind a  
large body of work, inclu-  
ding many self-portraits,  
that were not recognized  

as "art" until long after  
her death.  

Women In India from page 9  

Devadasis when a conference  
was held in nearby Kolhapur  
district in 1975 during the  
emergency rule declared by  
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.  
Many social workers were in  
jail then and the conference  
met with only limited re-  
sponse. It did succeed in  
bringing the issue into the  
public eye, but it had almost  
no impact on the custom it-  
self except to drive it more  
"underground." Girls are now  
dedicated at the priests'  
houses rather than publicly at  
the temple. (In fact the dedi-  
cation of girls itself has  
been illegal since the Deva-  
dasi Prevention Act of 1934,  
but this has become only a-  
nother unimplemented Indian  
law.)  

Then on June 15, 1980, after  
the first wave of tobacco  
workers' struggles had taken  
place, a second conference was  
held at Nipani itself. This  
time not only did the Deva-  
dasi factory workers them-  
selves come out, but other  
women also took the initia-  
tive in calling the Devadasis  
they knew from their own vil-  
lages. Over 600 women were  

present at the conference,  

40 times the size of the  
first one. Not even the ful-  
minations of the "goddess"  
against the union could damp-  
en their enthusiasm.  

Just as the workers are only  
beginning their struggle, so  
the fight against the goddess  
has a long way to go. The  
custom is deeply rooted in  
the poverty and religious  
traditions of the people, and  
most continue to believe that  
dedicating a girl to the god-  
dess is not even a matter of  
individual choice.  

But there is widespread ag-  
reement now that whatever the  
case, small girls should not  
be dedicated. There are two  
new organizations working  
among the Devadasis and young  
volunteers from nearby cities  
are planning to go to the  
pilgrimage site Feb. 20 to  
propagandize against the cus-  
tom.  

And perhaps just as signifi-  
cant, according to a union  
leader, "Two women have cut  
their hair. And they say  
‘look, nothing has happened  
to us.'" The small victories  
against superstition are be-  
ginning.
