Women in Chile Brutally Tortured ~

Carol Lease

The legally-elected govern-
ment of Salvador Allende was
overthrown in September of
1973 in one of the bloodiest
coups in the history of Latin
America. Over 15,000 people
have been executed and over
10,000 have been imprisoned,
tortured and subjected to in-
humane treatment. Civil and
constitutional rights have been
suspended and the country
remains in the hands of the
military. And the fact that
women are among the most
viciously treated prisoners has
been largely ignored by the
press.

In July of 1974 the Inter-
American Commission on
Human Rights of the Organiza-
tion of American States went to
Chile on a fact-finding mission.
A request was made by the Un-
ited States Committee for
Justice for Latin American
Political Prisoners that a woman
physician be included in the
team since at the time the
Chilean authorities did not allow
men into women’s prisons. The
request was denied by the Com-
mission, the all-male team left,
and the report it published after
their return didn't even have the
word “woman” in it.

However, Amnesty Inter-
national, an apolitical world
organization dedicated to
protecting “prisoners of con-
science” and human rights of
people all over the world,
receives reports almost daily of
illegal imprisonment, kidnap-
ping, torture, summary ex-
ecutions, government harass-
ment and intimidation of women
throughout Chile.

The wife of an Argentine lec-
turer was held in Estadio Chile, a
sports arena turned detention
center in Santiago, stripped,
abused, and searched for “dynamite
in her vagina” while she was
forced to listen to the cries of her
husband being tortured in the
next room.

Women, Children Tortured

The purposes of the torture
seem to be to “induce conformi-
ty by terror, dehumanization,
and the destruction of the will by
prolonged pain,” according to
Rose Styron, a board member of
Amnesty International — USA in
an article on Amnesty's findings
in the New York Review of Books
of May 30, 1974. Styron also
writes that at the women’s
prison, Casa de Mujeres el Buen
Pastor, “electricity is applied to
the gums of women, to the
uterus of a pregnant woman
producing brain lesions and
abortions. Young girls are sent
here pregnant from other torture
camps with their hair pulled out
and their nipples and genitals
badly burned.”

Amnesty also has extensive
reports of children being tor-
tured and terrorized in order to
intimidate their families. The
group was informed in March
that a nine-year-old girl and a
four-year-old boy were tortured
to death in front of their parents.
Amnesty has also compiled
dozens of documented cases of
kidnappings, particularly in the
poorer districts of the country,
and threats of kidnapping made
to families whose children were
at school. The Junta is using this
method of threatening children
in attempts to control women in
Chile. There are also many
documented cases of children
being taken from schools during
the day and from the working
class neighborhoods at night.

When a woman has no
children or when they cannot be
used effectively against her, she
is held without charges, con-
demned to death, executed, or if
she is lucky, is just intimidated
by the para-military intelligence
group called the DINA which is
controlled by the Junta and is
apparently modeled after the
death squad in Brazil, where
some of its leaders are known to
have been trained.

Nurses, doctors and medical
assistants have been arrested as
potential threats to the junta ap-
parently because they were not
against Allende and because
they were respected in the work-
ing class communities and
therefore seen as dangerous.
Many have been refused the
right to practice medicine.

Silvia Morris, head nurse at a
children’s hospital, was con-
demned and tortured for no
greater offense than suggesting
that her patients needed more
nourishment and medical atten-
tion. Dr. Elena Galvez, after be-
ing removed from the hospital
Sotero del Rio, was abused in
the stadium for refusing to take
reprisals against hospital
workers; she has since been
released from jail.

Legal Rights Denied

Last May, a Mexican daily
newspaper, ‘Excelsior,’
published a detailed account of
torture by military authorities. It
documents a six-month period,
the first part of which was
characterized by “rapid and
massive repression directed
against persons of importance
and aimed at destroying the
whole political structure,
organization and social base of
Allende’s supporters.”

In the Correctional House for
Women in Santiago, “almost
half of the women held have
been tortured during in-
terrogations. Among the most
frequent tortures are threats
against children, beatings, elec-
tric shocks, interrogations while
nude, and various forms of sex-
ual abuse. Two women there are
pregnant from being raped and
several others are awaiting
medical exams to determine if
they are pregnant.” Women are
forced to go to hospitals deter-
mined by the military where the
care is substandard.

The article also states that the
principal health problems of the
women are of a psychiatric
nature. “Various women who
have been freed from the Cor-
rectional House have had to un-
dergo psychiatric treatment, one
of them showing such evident
disturbance that it is feared the
condition is irreversible.”
Women who are taken prisoner
while pregnant have shown
“pathologies in their pregnan-
cies” as a result of the torture
they received.

The story then talks about the
obstruction and almost total
obliteration of the legal process
in Chile. “Lawyers meet sur-
passable difficulties in carrying
out adequate defenses - access
to the defendant is almost im-
possible.” In practice a lawyer
“could not present evidence nor
contradict the material
presented by the prosecutor.”
There is no possibility of appeal
or of questioning the com-
petence of a judge. The
prosecutor almost always deter-
mines the sentence and “basic
judicial principles have been
completely forgotten and the
sentences have been, on the
average, extremely high.

Feminists Protest Junta

The International Feminist
Task Force of the Washington,
D.C. chapter of NOW has in-
itiated several programs in sup-
port of women political prisoners
in Chile. Among the efforts are a
letter-bracelet campaign that is
similar to the POW bracelet idea
in which a woman would wear a
bracelet with the name of a
woman held prisoner and
hopefully correspond with her.
The correspondence would have
to be carefully worded so that
the Chilean woman's position
would not be jeopardized.

Judith Malina, director of the
Living Theatre, who was once
imprisoned and sexually tortured
in Brazil, stresses the impor-
tance of international pressure
against the Chilean junta and in-
dicated that such pressure forc-
ed former president Medici of
Brazil to release her theatre
troupe imprisoned there. It is
possible that a well-organized
campaign showing massive sup-
port for women imprisoned in
Chile would succeed in attaining
their release.

The Task Force also suggests
that women write the Embassy of
Chile in Washington requesting
the names of women who are
processed through or held
prisoner in the “Tejas Verdes”
military camp. The names could
then be shared with other
Feminist groups as could all in-
formation women got concern-
ing the location of the camp,
the charges and sentences and
allegations of torture.

Foreign Aid Bill Cuts Chile

The 1973 Foreign Aid Bill was
passed by the Senate with an
amendment by Senator
Kennedy (D-Mass.) that com-
pletely cuts off military aid to
Chile. The amendment was ap-
proved 47-41. However, due to
strong lobbying by the White
House and the State Depart-
ment, the bill was sent back to

the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. When the Congress
reconvened in November, the
Foreign Relations Committee

The full House has not con-
sidered the 1975 Foreign Aid
Bill. Work on the bill in the House
Foreign Affairs Committee has
been completed and the bill will
probably be sent to the full
House when Congress has been
sent to the full House. The bill as
approved by the House Foreign
Affairs Committee includes an

MA

ene riding ig ae ached

amended version of an amend-
ment to completely cut off
military aid to the junta. The final
version that was approved in
committee and will be sent to the
full House says that the junta
will get $800,000 in military
grants, and that if the President
finds later that Chile is making
substantial progress toward
restoring democracy and ending
the repression, he can request
that Congress restore $10
million in military aid.

Women Kill Rapists
Garcia Sentenced - Little Imprisoned

Inez Garcia has been sentenc-
ed to five years to life imprison-
ment for killing the man who
held her down while another
man raped her. Her lawyer has
filed for appeal and since her
sentence includes a four-month
observation period there is a
chance that she could receive a

lesser sentence after that
period.
In North Carolina, another

woman, JoAnne Little, has been
charged with first-degree
murder for defending herself
against rape. Little had been
kept in the Beaufort County jail
for three months pending an
appeal of a conviction for break-
ing and entering. She was the
only female prisoner; there were
no women matrons. She should
have been sent to the North
Carolina Women’s Detention
Center but there was no room
there for her.

On August 27th, a 62-year-old
guard, Charles Alligood, was
found dead in her cell. She had
fled, but turned herself in eight
days later.

Little stated that the guard’s
death was a matter of self-
defense; he had made sexual
advances towards her once before
and on the night of the 27th he
had tried to rape her. After hav-
ing turned off the TV monitor to
her cell, making sure that the in-
mate who usually had free
access to the entire jail was lock-
ed in his cell, and leaving his
shoes in the hall, Alligood took to
her cell an ice-pick that he
usually kept in his drawer. He
obviously anticipated
resistance.

Little said she got the ice pick
away from him, as he was un-
dressing, stabbed him several
times and ran. Alligood was later
found dead, naked from the
waist down.

She is now in solitary confine-
ment at the Women's Detention
Center. During the bond hearing
she was kept tightly shackled in
the courtroom so that she could
not even rise to greet her sup-
porters as they came in. Bond is
set at $100,000.

Her chances of receiving
anything resembling a fair trial
are negligible due to racist at-
titudes prevalent in that part of
North Carolina. Little is black
and the guard is white. A
Beaufort County Superior Court
Judge has denied a defense re-
quest that the trial be held in the
central part of the state. He has
also denied the use of state
funds for her defense, even
though she is indigent, and has
denied a request from her
lawyers for money to hire a
sociologist to help in her
defense. He has also denied
