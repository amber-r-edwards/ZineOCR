A Year And A Half Of ARMed Struggle

Marion Banzhof

Feminists can no longer
afford to be defensive about
abortion. Being pro-abortion
means going on the offen-
sive to answer the attack
on abortion rights. Being
pro-abortion means the wo-

abortion

man is more important than
the potential life -- the
fetus.

It is really quite sim-
ple. The pro-abortion move-
ment puts the woman first.
The anti-abortion movement
puts the fetus first. The
pro-choice groups put the
ability to choose first.

We have learned the hard
way that we cannot dodge
the anti-abortionists' ar-
guments about life. Every-
one knows that potential
life does exist and is des-
troyed when a woman has an
abortion.

The pro-choice answer is
that everyone should have
the right to choose for
themselves whether they
want to take that step. That
is correct; everyone must
have that right. But it
doesn't address the ques-
tion about life, nor does it
remove the guilt and shame
that society has put on
abortion. The pro-abortion
belief does not deny or
sidestep the fact that life
exists -- it puts the living,
functioning, already-born
woman in complete power.

The woman's right to deter-
mine how she will live her
life is greater than the
"right" to be born of the
fetus.

Pro-abortionists envision
control of reproduction to-
tally in the hands of women.
Women would receive whatever
support is needed to have
as few or as many children
as we want. This support
would include changing the
economic barriers to bearing
and raising children, provi-
ding good pre-natal care,
developing quality child-
care centers, and more.

In contrast, pro-choice
groups often hedge on the
issues of control -- they
recognize the power doctors
and laws have over women's
decisions as legitimate. Many
believe that there should
be restrictions on the num-

ber of children any one wo-
man, or any class of women,
bears. Some think that only
those people who can afford
to raise children at a cer-
tain standard of living
should have children.

Some socialist groups have
also taken up the issue of
reproductive rights and abor-
tion. The difference between
taking a reproductive rights
approach and a pro-abortion
approach is one of strategy
and political perspective.
ARM as a pro-abortion organ-
ization also has as its pur-
pose fighting sterilization
abuse, population control,
fighting experimentation,
dangerous birth control and
childbirth practices. ARM
works to expose and fight
against those violations of
women's reproductive free-
doms. But we must recognize
that abortion is under attack
right now and fight to re-
move all shame and taboo
from abortion. We must fight
for abortion as a simple
fact of life and a right for
all women, and as a funda-
mental basis for the libera-
tion of women.

The Abortion Rights Move-
ment of Women's Liberation
was founded to promote the
pro-abortion philosophy and
to make abortion more avail-
able to women.

A year and a half later,
it is time to evaluate the
successes and failures of
the pro-abortion strategy.
ARM was founded as a forum
for the women's health move-
ment to take the leadership
it deserves in the abortion
movement.

Has it worked to thwart
anti-abortionists' plans?
Has it clarified issues and
forces within the abortion
movement? Have radical femi-
nists moved into leadership
positions?

The Federation of Feminist
Women's Health Centers
(FWHCs) saw the need for a
radical feminist organiza-
tion to voice a pro-abortion,
pro-woman, and pro-self-help
perspective. They launched
ARM, donating many resources
to give ARM its initial
push. Staff came from the
FWHCs and worked to draw
others from the women's
health movement into ARM.

The response was mixed.
Other women-controlled cli-
nics were more receptive to,
and in the most agreement
with, ARM's call for an or-
ganization which would put
a health provider's exper-
ience into a political con-
text. Groups like Emma
Goldman Clinic for Women in
Iowa City, Women's Health Ser-
vices in Santa Fe, New Mex-
ico, New Hampshire Feminist
Health Center, and the
Gainesville (Florida) Wo-
men's Health Center became
sister organizations, ex-
pressing their agreement
with ARM's political stance.
Other groups were not so
receptive. For example, the
National Women's Health Net-
work would have preferred
that the Federation of FWHCs
donate the money it put into
ARM into a “Reproductive
Rights Committee" of the

Network. Actually what was
really necessary was a "Fem-
inist Caucus" of National
Abortion Rights Action
League (NARAL), since it is
the largest pro-choice or-
ganization.

Self-helpers around the
country joined ARM. So did
feminists who were tired of
the pro-choice apologies.
Women who appreciated ARM's
unequivocal support for a
women's right to abortion
also joined. But the total
membership never climbed
over 200 and the women in
the FWHCs were the ones to
form ARM chapters in their
own communities and shoulder
the responsibility of sup-
porting and promoting the
national organization.

ARM was not founded as a
project of the Federation
of FWHCs. Rather, it was
founded to promote a radical
politic, to confront the

abortion establishment, and

to fight to be sure that
women got the abortions they
wanted. Women who had ex-
perience with self-help and
confrontation politics ac-
tively worked to support
these goals.

However, no sister organ-
ization could take on major
responsibility for national
work. Some were too involved
in other projects, and in
maintaining their own cli-
nics. Some groups felt that
identifying themselves as
part of ARM prevented them
from working effectively in
coalitions since they felt
ARM's strategy of making
political distinctions clear
was alienating. Some groups
expressed appreciation for
the fact that someone else
was taking a pro-abortion
position, recognizing that
it did improve their own
pro-choice stance. But these
groups felt that to be open-
ly pro-abortion in their own
conservative community was
too risky, too radical.

So, in short, the time was
not right for the women's
health movement to create its
own national, radical, fem-
inist front which would fight
for abortion on demand, con-
front the medical and popu-
lation control establish-
ments, and prod liberal or-
ganizations into taking more
aggressive positions.

A contributing factor to
this lack of acceptance was
that ARM's structure, as it
was first envisioned, was
never put into practice. The
innovative idea of having the
national office staffed by
members of local women's
health groups who would ro-
tate to Washington for a
short period of time has yet
to be tried. That structure
would have allowed for con-
stant grassroots involve-
ment in the work of the na-
tional organization. It
would have set up the mecha-
nism for people in different
women's health projects to
work with each other in a
way that has not happened
in any other organization.
Meaningful grassroots parti-
cipation, instead of token
participation, would have
been developed as feminists
came to Washington and be-
came exposed to the politics
of the other segments of the
movement.
