Court Takes Political Mother's Child

(Edited from a press release
from the Committee Against
the Kidnapping of Tina Fish-
man's Daughter)

"Women, stay in thy place -
or the price you pay will be
heavy indeed!" This is the
message behind the ongoing

custody

court battle involving Tina
Fishman and the government-
sponsored kidnapping of her
eleven-year-old daughter. In
December, Judge Gerald Ragan
of the California Superior
Court reinforced and extended
this widely-protested kid-
napping, which threatens to
set a reactionary political
and legal precedent in the
1980s.

The Ragan decision followed
a five-day hearing in which
Tina contested that the whole
custody case was concocted to
launch a political attack,
targeting her for politics

and values which the govern-
ment finds intolerable. Her
daughter was first removed
from her custody in August
1981 by Commissioner James L.
Browning, on the grounds that
Tina's political activities
constituted an "emergency
situation." Although the
court admitted that the child
was "unquestionably well-
cared-for," it found Tina
guilty of "having interests
other than parenting" and
"withholding the intangible
necessities of parenting,"
pointing to her activities

in support of the Revolutionary
Communist Party and felony
charges she was facing as
a Mao Tsetung Defendant. (For
a 1979 demonstration against
the state visit of China's
Teng Xiao-ping and in support
of Mao - after 34 years of
political battle, the charges
were dropped.) The child was
turned over to Tina's ex-
husband, a patriotic physi-
cist working for Lockheed in
production of the Trident and
Cruise missiles.

The National Lawyers Guild
noted that "...(this) distor-
tion of understood family law
principles and the extreme
measures employed by the
commissioner in this case
can be explained only as pol-
itical retaliation." Progres-
sive people are protesting
not only the political witch-
hunt style of the attack, but
that it comes cloaked under
the guise "best interests of
the child." Feminist attorney
Marian Neudel offered testi-
mony about the growing trend
in custody law for women con-
sidered rebellious in any way
to lose their children to
more conservative ex-husbands
(Ragan promptly ruled her
testimony out of order).

In court and through exten-
sive media coverage, the Fish-
man case is aimed to intimi-
date women who dare get up
out of their "place." Ragan's
ruling approves the lifestyle
of Tina's ex-husband as "a
stable, safe, religious and
orderly environment in an
attractive, comfortable com-
mune." The court even used
"expert psychiatric testimony"
to drive home the point: anyone who
rejects the American Dream
is obviously an unfit parent.

From the outset, this case
has broken with all normal
Uniform Child Custody Juris-
diction Act procedures, be-
ginning with the "emergency
situation" as grounds to
bring the case out of the
child's home state (Illinois)
into the California courts.
But despite repeated claims
of "no politics here," the
political nature of the case
has repeatedly come to light.

Browning was forced to with-
draw from the bench by expo-
sure of his "apolitical"
background: a 1970s career
as a federal prosecutor who
imprisoned draft resisters,
went after Black revolution-
aries, and directed a grand
jury against the Revolutionary
Union (forerunner of the
RCP). Tina's request for her
Freedom of Information Act
file was denied because its
release would endanger "na-
tional defense or foreign
policy" and "pending inves-
tigations" (the custody case?)

Even routine visitation rights

were wielded to pressure Tina
to back down - she was not
allowed to see her daughter
before facing political in-
terrogation about her poli-
tical beliefs and activities.
