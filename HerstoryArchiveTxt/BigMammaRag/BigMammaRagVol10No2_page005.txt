Law Enforcer?

The undersheriff of Lincoln  
Co., CO, has been charged in  
connection with his alleged  
1981 sexual involvement with  
a 14-year-old girl.

Cecil Stone was charged with  
three counts of sexual as-  
sault on a child, three  
counts of second-degree sex-  
ual assault, and three counts  
of child abuse.

The charges were lodged at  
the request of the girl's  
parents. The girl is now 15,  
the age of consent in Colo-  
rado.

Stone has been suspended  
without pay.

Changing Times

The management of Northern  
California Kaiser Hospitals  
is out to break the union of  
striking optometrists, who  
went out on strike on Jan. 4.  
The eye doctors are fighting  
to maintain the 20-minute  
schedule allotted each patient  
although they charge that a  
thorough exam really requires  
30 minutes.

The Kaiser administration  
has tried to force the doc-  
tors to give up these minimal  
scheduling rules that have  
existed for 10 years. But  
when it came to hiring  
non-union doctors during the  
strike, Kaiser sang a differ-  
ent tune, demanding "2 pa-  
tients per hour", or 30 min-  
ute exams by the independent  
optometrists.

In The Name  
Of Science

Nassau County (NY) police  
officer Steven Jasser plead-  
ed innocent to harassing an  
East Garden City woman in a  
series of phone calls.

He told her he was a clin-  
ical psychologist who wanted  
to research her sex life.  
Officials said they believe  
he may be responsible for a  
wave of similar calls on  
Long Island.

Jasser—an eight-year  
police veteran, married and  
the father of a 2-year-old—  
was arrested at a restaur-  
ant where he had arranged  
to meet the housewife.

He was released on his  
own recognizance after be-  
ing charged with criminal  
impersonation and aggravat-  
ed harassment. He was sus-  
pended from his job without  
pay.

Merry Xmas

Over 11,000 copper miners  
were laid off in December.  
For the workers in the comp-  
any town of Silver Bell, AR,  
it was more than a layoff.  
The transnational ASARCO co-  
mpany kicked the people out  
of their homes. On Dec. 23,  
the company closed down oper-  
ations at Silver Bell and  
gave workers with 15 years or  
less on the job 60 days to  
vacate company housing. Some  
70 families will have to  
leave by the end of February.  
The layoffs are aimed in part  
at weakening the United Steel  
Workers union which repres-  
ents the copper miners and  
which has a militant history.

Well Used TV

An anti-psychiatric group  
in Vermont put together a  
TV show on public television  
to educate people about the  
issues of constitutional  
rights for psychiatric in-  
mates. The show focused on  
common situations where peo-  
ple have been forcibly taken  
to the state hospital for  
such "crimes" as going off  
prescribed medications. The  
members of the group have  
found that the show has help-  
ed them make contacts with  
present, former, and potent-  
ial future incarcerated "pa-  
tients". They are working on  
passing a bill to abolish in-  
voluntary hospitalization.

It’s Official

In a recent statement re-  
leased to the media on offi-  
cial stationery, Cal. State  
Sen. John Schmitz charged  
that his recent public hear-  
ings on abortion were “infest-  
ed by imported lesbians, a  
sea of hard, Jewish and argu-  
ably female faces and murder-  
ous marauders of the pro-ab-  
ortion encampment.”

Schmitz responded to crit-  
icism by stating that "I  
would wear it as a badge of  
honor if I get stripped of  
my chairmanship for this is-  
sue." Schmitz's press re-  
lease was entitled "Senator  
Schmitz and his committee  
survive the attack of the  
bulldykes."

Fruits Of Sterility

EDB, a deadly pesticide set  
to go into use later this  
year is thought to cause can-  
cer and sterility. Used in  
combatting Mediterranean  
fruit flies, it is sprayed  
on the produce after the har-  
vest.

Some 100,000 workers will  
be exposed to EDB next sum-  
mer and fall. But OSHA has  
declined to issue emergency  
regulations covering the pest-  
icide, preferring to proceed  
as it does in normal cases.  
It generally takes one to  
two years for chemicals to be  
regulated.

Longest Walkout

The longest nurses' strike  
in U.S. history could be set-  
tled soon if the Ashtabula  
General Hospital in Ohio  
just agreed not to retaliate  
against the nurses who began  
their walkout 17 months ago.

Strikers are anxiously a-  
waiting a National Labor Re-  
lations Board hearing that  
will decide if the hospital's  
refusal to assure job securi-  
ty is an unfair labor prac-  
tice under federal law.  
Should the NLRB decide in  
the union's favor the strike  
will effectively be settled...  
If the NLRB supports the  
hospital, neither side fore-  
sees a settlement in the  
near future.

Sunni-Ali Out

Jailed Black activist Ful-  
ani Sunni-Ali was released  
last week, pending a second  
appearance before a federal  
grand jury investigating the  
Brinks armed robbery case.

Astute legal maneuvers by  
defense lawyers forced gov-  
ernment prosecutors to drop  
their attempt to prevent  
Chokwe Lumumba from acting  
as attorney for Sunni-Ali,  
(Lumumba is the minister of  
information of the Republic  
of New Afrika—a group label-  
ed "terrorist" by the pro-  
secution). Sunni-Ali had  
been jailed Dec. 7 for refus-  
ing to cooperate with the  
grand jury, in her words,  
"until my rights are respect-  
ed and I am allowed to have  
an attorney of my choice."
