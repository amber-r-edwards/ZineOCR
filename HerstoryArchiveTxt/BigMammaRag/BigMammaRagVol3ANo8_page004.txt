It Could Be You. You don't  
have to be an activist or even  
think of yourself as a “political  
person” or have the remotest  
connection to any “crime” to be  
subpoenaed before a grand jury  
or visited by the FBI. Any or all of  
us may be subject to this harass-  
ment.  

You are a likely candidate if  
you have ever: attended a  
demonstration; signed a peti-  
tion; had friends or acquain-  
tances who are or were active in  
anti-war, anti-racist, anti-sexist,  
pro-liberation work; had your  
name mentioned, no matter how  
obscurely, by another witness  
before a grand jury.  

Therefore, knowing what to  
expect and knowing your rights  
is essential.

On My Chinny-Chin-Chin  

There is no good reason to talk  
with FBI agents nor are you  
legally obligated to give more  
than your name. Talking through a  
closed door is desirable if possi-  
ble since FBI agents have  
sometimes considered an invita-  
tion to come in as a consent to  
search. Another possibility is  
that you can go out to say that  
you do not consent to speak with  
the FBI.  

A look at reasons people have  
given for talking with FBI agents  
and the repercussions of their  
cooperation show that the  
safest, most defensible thing we  
can do is to state immediately  
that we do not wish to speak  
with FBI agents and to close the  
door, if open, in their faces.  

After a visit from the FBI, it is  
good to talk to as many people as  
possible — friends, family,  
neighbors, co-workers — to  
make sure they understand they  
are under no legal obligation to  
talk with FBI agents.  

The FBI has a variety of come-  
ons: sometimes friendly,  
sometimes tough, sometimes  
pretend to be identified with  
voter registration, the census or  
credit bureau, or the long-lost  
high school friend of a friend of  
yours.  

Often they come in pairs so if  
you do talk to them one can  
corroborate in court the other's  
story of what you said. They  
sometimes use physical dis-  
guises and dress in ways intend-  
ed to get you to drop your guard.  
Or they use interrogation tricks,  

Arvada West High  

such as “We have information  
which tends to implicate you in  
your neighborhood bank  
robbery. If you could answer a  
few questions, I'm sure we can  
straighten things out.” This can  
easily lead to you describing  
your activities, whereabouts,  
and companions on a certain  
date. Don't lose your cool. Don't  
talk.  
The Grand Jury  

There are two kinds of federal  
grand juries. A regular grand  
jury meets to consider cases  
involving federal offenses (e.g.  
income tax evasion). The special  
investigatory grand jury, the kind  
we are talking about, is being  
called to gather information and  
look for criminal or conspiracy  
evidence.  

Those persons who exercise  
their right not to answer  
questions of the FBI are routine-  
ly threatened that failure to  
cooperate will result in being  
subpoenaed before the grand  
jury. A subpoena is a summons  
to appear to testify and/or  
present material at a particular  
time and place. The subpoena  
has to be handed to you, in  
person, by a U.S. Marshal, U.S.  
Attorney, or a federal agent, and  
can be a call to appear within  
24 hours to testify.  

If you are away and if the  
government cannot prove that  
you left to avoid getting the  
subpoena, you are okay. If you  
get it, and do not appear, you are  
considered a fugitive.  

As soon as you are sub-  
poenaed by a grand jury you  
should get both legal and  
political help. Do Not Act Alone.  
Without both legal and political  
support you will be even more  
vulnerable to the isolation, in-  
timidation and coercion the  
government — through the  
grand jury process — seeks to  
bring about.  

If you hear that you are going  
to be subpoenaed ahead of time,  
have your lawyer attempt to  
“quash” it (throw it out) on legal  
grounds.  

How the Grand Jury Works  

1. No defense lawyer may be  
present inside the grand jury  
room with you.  

2. No judge is present.  

3. No friends, press, or other  
witnesses are present.  

4. Trial rules of evidence do  
not apply.  

a. Hearsay evidence is ad-  
missible in grand juries.  

b. Wiretap evidence can be  
used (but can be challenged);  
informer evidence can be used.  

c. Evidence gathered from  
other sources may be used in  
prosecution against a witness  
for acts described by that  
witness while testifying under  
use immunity.  

Act  

Alone  

d. The prosecutor is allowed  
to feed information into the  
government memory banks and  
the FBI.  

e. The prosecutor can ask  
unlimited questions, and pre-  
sent unlimited evidence and  
unlimited witnesses.  

5. The witness need not be  
told the purpose of the investiga-  
tion, or even if she is a possible  
target of the investigation.  

6. Jurors, the prosecutor, the  
clerk, are bound to secrecy.  
Witnesses are not.  

7. Jurors are charged not with  
a simple yes or no to the  
question of indictment but with  
answering the vaguer question  
of whether any crime has been  
committed and if so, by whom. A  
simple majority is sufficient to  
serve a presentment for indict-  
ment.  

8. Grand juries may legally  
initiate investigations into ac-  
tivities not brought to them by  
government prosecutors.  

9. Grand juries run for an 18  
month term and can be  
reconvened immediately upon  
the expiration of their term.  

The Rights of a Witness  

A grand jury witness has  
extremely limited rights and is  
not entitled to the protection  
accorded to a defendant in a  
criminal trial because she has  
not been charged with a crime.  
The rights can be and are often  
denied, but it is worth a try:  

1. The right to remain silent.  

2. The right to refuse to testify  
based on the Bill of Rights,  
starting with the 5th Amend-  
ment.  

3. The right to question the  
use of wire taps, since it is one of  
the few subjects on which the  
Supreme Court has ruled in  
favor of witnesses. In practice,  
when the witness demands that  
the government reveal if it used  
taps, the government will dis-  
miss the subpoena rather than  
show its hand.  

4. The right to counsel (6th  
Amendment), to leave the grand  
jury room to talk with your  
lawyer after each question is  
phrased.  

5. The right to publicize and  
talk about the case in the com-  
munity.  

6. The right to write down  
everything said in the room.  

7. The right to refuse to  
answer certain questions based  
on confidential relationships  
that enjoy legal protection: at-  
torney/client, wife/husband,  
priest/penitent, patient/doctor,  
and new definitions of sanc-  
tioned relationships like com-  
munes, intentional com-  
munities, and women’s groups.  

8. Legal right to try to quash  
the subpoena, make appeals,

This One Booth, This One Little Booth! — For the first time in the  
history of the annual convention of the American Psychiatric  
Association, there was a booth entitled “Women Loving Women,”  
which was staffed by two lesbians from the National Gay Task Force.  
Over 5,000 people in the mental health field attended the conference in  
Anaheim, CA., and reactions to the booth were varied. “One man was  
furious with us and quite out of control,” reported Ginny Vida. “This one  
booth, this one little booth,” he said, can cause so much damage. You're  
trying to destroy our civilization. You're trying to destroy capitalism and  
the nuclear family!” (perceptive, wasn't he?) Another man didn't  
understand the purpose of the booth at all. “These are just pictures of  
women,” he remarked. It’s like having a display entitled ‘Red Apples.'  
After all, they're just apples.” (After all, there really are a lot of  
similarities between apples and women, don't you think?) Then there  
was the female employee who came by sweeping the rug and noticed  
the book Sappho Was A Right-On Woman. “I've always wanted a book  
like that,” she said, and swept on. (It's Time, June-July ‘75,  
“Psychiatrists Meet Lesbians,” Ginny Vida)  

How to Make the Women’s Movement Go Away — Dr. Monica B.  
Morris, in examining newspapers in the Los Angeles area, found that  
very little coverage had been given the Women’s Movement. (Not  
surprising.) Dr. Morris described what she sees as three steps in the  
mass media’s efforts to limit the movement. “First, ignore the problem —  
perhaps it will go away . . . Second, if the problem will not go away,  
give it so much frivolous coverage that its serious intent will be  
destroyed by bellows of raucous laughter. Finally, if the movement  
persists, publicize its least offensive goals, the ones that fit into society  
without really changing very much, while de-emphasizing its  
revolutionary aims. (“The Public Definition of a Social Movement:  
Women’s Liberation,” by Monica B. Morris, Sociology and Social  
Research, July '73)  

One is Hot Pursuit; the Other is Tough Shit — The Colorado Court of  
Appeals recently threw out a rape conviction in a lower court, ruling  
that Greeley police officers were not justified in conducting a  
warrantless search. In this particular case, officers traced a set of  
footprints in freshly fallen snow and found the suspect as well as the  
hiking boots which matched the prints. They did not stop to get a  
warrant, claiming that the prints would have dried by that time and they  
would not have been able to find the accused rapist. The lower court  
ruled that the wetness of the boots was essential evidence and that the  
police were justified in conducting a warrantless search. The Court of  
Appeals, however, threw out the conviction saying that police may  
search without a warrant only if they are in “hot pursuit” of an armed  
and violent criminal who must be located to protect citizens and prevent  
escape. In other words, since the woman has already been raped she no  
longer needs protection and it isn't really very important to be in hot  
pursuit of a rapist. After all, a rape is just a rape. (Rocky Mountain News,  
Aug. 20, ‘75)  

Best Put-Downs of the Year Award — goes to Willie Tyson for the fines  
of her song on Lima Bean Records called “I Don’t Need You.” Here's the  
first one, “You wear a black leather jacket and carry an Italian motif bag.  
Your pockets are stuffed with French perfume and oily cleaning rags.  
You think you look like Katherine Hepburn but you’re more like  
Tinkerbell in drag.” And here’s another, “Your painting consists of  
drawing smiles on black-eyed peas and your poetry sounds like the  
chemistry of some terminal disease.” And this one’s my favorite,  
“When I think of seeing you again — going blind sounds good to me.”  
(The album ‘Full Count’ may be ordered by sending $5.95 to Lima Bean  
Records, Inc., 217 12th St. S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003).

High School Women Explore Feminism  

Penny, Kathy, & Sue  

Women's Awareness Week  
was a project designed by  
myself, Penny Hutchens, Sue  
Haymes, and Kathy Barriga,  
seniors at Arvada West High  
School, to present information  
on the women's movement,  
women’s rights, and women’s  
role in society as it is and as it  
should be. The event took place  
at Arvada West High School  
during the week of Aug. 14-15.  

On Monday, August 11 an  
afternoon concert by “Raw  
Honey” kicked the week off —  
right on its ass. “Raw Honey”  
gave an outstanding perfor-  
mance but attendance was  
underwhelming. The 40 people  
who showed up were  
enthusiastic and a good time  
was had by all. The concert  
would have had better response  
had it been at night; however,  
evening activities cannot be held  
at the school unless a male  
sponsor is present.  

Tuesday, August 12, Jane  
Fisher from the Clara Brown  
Chapter of N.O.W. gave an  
excellent workshop on Con-  
sciousness Raising (CR). Seven  
people were present and  
although the response was  
minimal, four of these people are  
planning to form a CR group.  

Chris Beal, a coach from  
Columbine High School, led a  
“Women and Sports” workshop  
Wednesday, August 13. The  
discussion centered around Title  
IX, a federal law stating in part  
“no person shall, on the basis of  
sex, be excluded from participa-  
tion in, be denied the benefits of  
or be subjected to discrimination  
under any educational program  
or activity receiving federal  
financial assistance.” Ms. Beal  
clarified this law to the women  
present and applied it to inter-  
scholastic sports and athletic  
scholarships for college-bound  
women.  

Thursday, August 14, Clare  
Strawn, a member of the BMR  
collective, and Janine Bertram  
from the Lesbian/Feminist radio  
collective in Seattle presented a  
workshop on “Women and the  
Media.” The discussion involved  
the media and branched into  
politics, self-image, lesbianism,  
and finally “the revolution”  
which many feel is coming. We  
agree that this was the best  
workshop in that everyone pre-  
sent became involved and ex-  
cited with what was being said.  

State Representative, Nancy  
Flett, D-Arvada, and Councilper-  
son Rosemary Dooley spoke  
about “Women and Politics,”  
Friday, August 15. Ms. Dooley  
began the discussion with the  
definition of a lady and said she  
felt it is important to keep male  
and female roles separate to  
avoid confusion. She added that  
she is not a “women’s libber”  
and is against extremists —  
braless unshaven women. We  
realized at that point we had  
made a mistake in having her  
speak. Nancy was much more  
impressive, answering  
questions concerning women in  
a positive and broad-minded  
way.  

Throughout the week there  
was art, literature, and music  
displayed in the lobby. The  

Woman to Woman Book Center  
provided a large assortment of  
books, posters and albums for  
sale. The artwork was displayed  
by women from the Arvada  
Artists Guild and by students  
from the school, and music by  
women was played continuously.  
Reaction to the display was  

positive.  
We feel that the week was  
beneficial to all who par-  

ticipated, and that the poor  
attendance was due to the  
apathy that suburbs in general  
and high schools in particular  
tend to generate. Even though  
Women's Awareness Week did  
not reach as many people as we  
hoped it would we feel it was a  
success.
