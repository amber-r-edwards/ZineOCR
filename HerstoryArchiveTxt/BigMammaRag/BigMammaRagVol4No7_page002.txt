Women Everywhere Radio Collective Fights KFML  
To Keep Sunday Women’s Programming On The Air  

Kate Sharp  

The continued existence of the  
“Women Everywhere" radio pro-  
gram aired every Sunday after-  
noon at 2 PM on KFML was recent-  
ly, and is possibly still, in  
substantial jeopardy. This fact  
brought about several weeks of  
negotiations and controversy  
involving the KFML administra-  
tion, the Women Everywhere  
Radio Collective, and the NOW  
Media Task Force.  

For approximately one year  
the "Women Everywhere" show  
was aired weekly without any  
recorded complaint to the sta-  
tion management or personnel  
and with occasional positive  
comment to both the station and  
the radio collective. Suddenly,  
in May of this year, members of  
the collective "unofficially"  
learned that NOW had been app-  
roached by KFML with an offer  
to take over the show. The col-  
lective was also assured that  
NOW was willing to support the  
group if it wanted to fight to  
keep the show.  

At this point, radio collec-  
tive member Peg Hickox phoned  
KFML to ask program director  
Craig Applequist why NOW had  
been offered the “Women Every-  
where" show, to which the reply  
came that NOW had not been  
offered the show. It was rev-  
ealed, however, at a subsequent  
KFML/radio collective meeting  
(originally set up to solidify  
the collective's free advertis-  
ing contract with KFML) that  
Kathy Miller, the station's  
news director, had contacted  
NOW with the offer because she  
felt that the show should have  
a “broader scope". It was never  
made clear, however, whether  
this move had been self-init-  
iated by Miller or whether it  
had been a “recommendation"  
from the station's higher-ups.  

Both the station manager, Don  
Zucker, and the program direc-  
tor, Craig Applequist, stated  
at this meeting that neither of  
them personally had any compla-  
ints with the show, but that  
all involved had definitely  
decided that the Women Every-  
where Radio Collective would no  
longer be producing the show.  
When asked if the group could  
share the show with NOW, the  
answer was negative. When asked  
if the group could alternate the  
show (presently sponsored by  
BMR and Woman to Woman Feminist  
Bookcenter) with NOW, the ans-  
wer was the same. Collective  

members were told that it was  
possible that they might have  
the show back in six months and  
were at this meeting given pro-  
duction time to work on the  
contracted advertising spots  
only. (These spots were offered  
in return for doing the show  
free of charge for a year - an  
offer originally made at the  
outset of the show but not def-  
initely solidified until this  
point.)  

When asked why this decision  
had been made, Zucker informed  
collective representatives that  
the station's license was up  
for renewal soon and although  
the show fulfilled the “letter  
of the FCC law" it was felt  
that "the spirit of the FCC law  
was not being fulfilled” and  
that the station's obligation

was to provide the broadest  
appeal possible in women's  
programming. When told that the  
collective had been informed  
that NOW would back the present  
show and would not accept the  

spot, the station manager sta-  

ted that if that was in fact  
the case, the Women Everywhere  
Radio Collective would maintain  
control of the show.  

A subsequent meeting was set  
up between one member of the  
NOW Media Task Force, Sharon  
Leventhal, and Don Zucker  
during which Leventhal was told  
that if NOW did not accept the  
show it would definitely be  
given to a third group. (The  
League of Housewives was one

But, What Happens January 1st?  
Colorado General Nurses Allowed To Continue Maternity Program  

Eileen Bresnahan  

The Administration of Colorado  
General Hospital has decided to ex-  
tend the hospital's unique mater-  
nity care program, at least through  
January 1, 1977. This decision came  
in the midst of protests and organ-  
izing efforts by nurses associated  
with the program, women who had been  
and are being served by it, and  
other interested women in the Denver  
feminist community.  

As BMR reported last issue (June/  
July, 1976), the program was init-  
ially to have been terminated July  
1, 1976. The primary reason given  
at that time was that there was not  
enough money in the hospital budget  
to pay for the team-nurse approach  
to maternity clinic care. Since,  
under this approach, every patient  
is assigned to a two-nurse team, one  
of whom is called in when the pat-  
ient is in labor, it is more expen-  
sive to maintain (mainly due to  
overtime), but the care given is  
much more personal because the woman  
knows the nurse who is with her in  
the labor room.  

The nurses who work in the pro-  
gram, however, maintained that the  
question was not one of dollars, but  
of priorities. They pointed out that  
other hospital units such as the  

new burn center and the liver trans-  
plant center were amply funded,  
while the major money shortages had  
occurred in maternity and pediatrics.  
Feeling that this represented a pat-  
tern of discrimination against women  
and children's services, the nurses  
had taken their case to two femin-  
ist attorneys, who were exploring  
the possibility of seeking an in-  
junction to block the termination of  
the program, giving them the addit-  
ional time that they would need to  
bring suit.  

These plans have been placed in  
temporary limbo by the hospital's  
decision to continue the program for  
an additional six months, for the  
expressed purpose of doing a study  
to determine if team nursing makes  
a "difference" in maternity care.  

"All the hospital administration  
is going to believe are figures  
which show shorter labors, or de-  
creased new-born morbidity and mor-  
tality. They couldn't care less  
about whether women in the program  
are happier, more secure, or just  
generally get treated more humanely  
in team-care situations,” charged  
one woman who was active in the or-  
ganizing efforts. As proof of the  
satisfaction women feel with the  

program, the nurses have numerous  
letters from women commending them  
on the care which was received.  
"It was really strange that the  
hospital was suddenly able to come  
up with money to continue the pro-  
gram, when all along they had been  
telling us that there was no more  

money anywhere," said one nurse.  

The question now is what happens  
January first? Denver women have  
vowed that they will not let the  
program die without a fight. Only  
time, and the hospital administra-  
tion, will tell.  

Supreme Court Declares Abortion  
Restrictions Unconstitutional  

The Supreme Court, in early July,  
handed down two important decisions  
on abortion. The new rulings rein-  
forced the 1973 landmark decision  
forbidding states to prevent abor-  
tions during the first three months  
of pregnancy, calling such abortions  
a matter between a woman and her  
doctor.  

In a 5-to-4 decision, the court de-  
cided that states may not impose  
“blanket” restrictions requiring wo-  
men under 18 to obtain parental con-  
sent for an abortion. And in a 6-to-  
3 ruling in the same case, the Court  
held that a woman's husband need not  
consent to her abortion.  

Both rulings were in regard to the  
provisions of a 1974 Missouri law.  

The Court also struck down a pro-  
vision requiring doctors to use as  
much care to preserve the life of an  
aborted fetus as of a fetus intended  
to be born alive and ruled that it  
is unconstitutional to ban saline  
abortions.  

Writing the majority opinion, Judge  
Blackmun argued that a state may not  
grant a husband the right to prevent  
his wife's abortion when "the state  
itself lacks that right." And on the  
question of parental consent, Black-  
mun held that just as husbands have  
no constitutional right to prevent  
abortions, states have no authority  
to give parents “an absolute, and  
possibly arbitrary, veto” when an  
unmarried minor requests an abortion.
