| HAVE GIVEN UP SEEING UTOPIAN
TYPES OF SOLUTIONS ... WE NEED
TO CONCENTRATE ON WHERE

WOMEN ARE HURTING RIGHT NOW

Andrea: Well, I had been a very
super housewife for 15 years before
I came into my own in a whole lot of
ways. I was caught up in the fervor
of the sixties and became very much
involved in the anti-war movement
and also in the Civil Rights Move-
ment. At the same time I was also
involved in defining myself profes-
sionally because my two children were
school age and I was faced with the
prospect of spending the rest of my
life being a helpmate, which didn't
appeal to me.

I became more than just a
conscious wife, but rather someone with
a revolutionary consciousness. I felt
a threat to his career and an asset.

Both male and political
activity tended towards a
concern at home, which
left him feeling somewhat abandoned
and worried. I felt I was moving
away so far politically from the
space that he was in that there was
no way I could continue to respect
him and love him as a life companion.
I couldn't understand why he
felt so hostile, so betrayed when
I wanted out. It seemed obvious
that he was no longer happy either
with the kind of relationship that
we had and the kinds of differences
that were becoming evident.

He became so neurotically involved
in preventing me from breaking away
from him that we went through an
enormous divorce hassle. He was
unable to accept the idea of a div-
orce and he won his case in court,
literally. I became aware through
the whole process, too, of the is-
sues involved in self-determination
as a human being, specifically as a
woman, when the judge agreed with
my husband that I should simply
stay with him even though I didn't
feel able to do so. I had, by that
time, gone through a lot of guilt
about breaking with my husband and
it was the Women's Movement that
helped me to move away from feeling
guilty about it.

BMR: I know you have accepted and
oriented yourself more toward a
left program. How did you make that
change?

Andrea: In breaking with my husband
I also freed myself from my class
position somewhat. I began to iden-
tify with working-class people. I
began to see that strength in
building a revolutionary movement
lies only in aligning ourselves
with a movement of oppressed people
of all kinds—minorities, unemployed,
workers, welfare mothers—and
not in the politics of the middle
class, professional women's move-
ment. We are not going to make a
revolution if we stay in that ter-
ritory.

BMR: How do you see yourself as
working on women's issues within
the left, within the working class?
How does that differ from the
Women's Movement?

Sexism Is Real, But Is Not
The Primary Contradiction

Andrea: For one thing I have
given up seeing utopian types of
solutions or even needing to solve immediately
all of the problems that might oc-
cur for women in future generations.
I see things more in terms of where
women are hurting right now and
what are the first steps women need
to take to begin a process of emanc-
ipation.

For instance, I realize that poor
women are willing to put up with a
lot more oppression from men, their
husbands, for a much longer time
than I was willing to. I realize
that the economic dependence and
the economic problems that they
feel are more overwhelming in the
day-to-day battle for survival than
the problem of the domination of
the men over their lives. Appreci-
ating that more at a gut level, I
realize that talking about futurist-
ic solutions of breaking down mono-
gamous relations, pairing relation-
ships, and so on, really doesn't
make sense to most women who have
a primary problem of getting their
children fed, meeting the next rent
payment. The very real need to have
some security in their life makes
those kinds of ideas really diffi-
cult to accept. The problem of
security is so central. Emotional
security and economic security are
so intertwined under capitalism be-
cause that's the way the system is
set up and there are literally no
other primary relationships that we
have other than within the family.

BMR: You have some fairly strong
disagreements or positions that
are not usual for a Marxist-Lenin-
ist. I know that you are trying to
educate within the left on certain
women's issues. Could you talk
about what those differences are
and how you see yourself doing that
successfully?

Andrea: Women as a group need to
be mobilized to make decisions
about the programs and the tactics
involved in their own emancipation.
I feel that the women who are in-
volved in defining the politics of
the woman question in the Marxist-
Leninist party need to be involved
in mass work with the Women's Move-
ment and not just with women who
are in the party. This is the
difference between a reformist top-
down program and a revolutionary
program. A revolutionary program
literally means that oppressed
people are self-determining.

BMR: You have used the term “Marx-
ist-Leninist" left. Could you de-
fine that for women who do not have
a background in the differentiation
within the left?

Andrea: By Marxist-Leninist left
I make a distinction between the
Communist Party, Trotskyists, etc.
in this country. Basically the
differentiation is in the emphasis
on building a party which will not
only take power, but will establish
the dictatorship of the proletariat
that government will not dis-
appear after the taking of power.
Many women in the independent Wo-
men's movement are basically anar-
chists. They are utopian in the
sense that they feel somehow the
revolutionary changes are going to
come about by a conversion process
or by spontaneous mass action which
will create a perfect classless
society, without machismo, without
capitalist exploitation, and so on.
There is no historical precedence
of that happening.

BMR: I've noticed that a lot of
women in the Women's Movement are
less antagonistic to the idea of
a dictatorship when talking about
a women's dictatorship over men.
When talking about it in terms of
just class, I think the fear lies
in the fact that the left is still
very patriarchal in its nature and
if a dictatorship of the proletariat
takes over, it will be a male
proletariat that is not dealing
with women as a part of that pro-
letariat.

Andrea: If the activists in the
Women's Movement who are really
dedicated in that area become in-
volved in the Marxist-Leninist
left, then we can change the situ-
ation you just described. We have
to be willing to make some compro-
mises tactically to do that.

The question of analyzing the
source of our suffering, scientifically,
has to be faced up to. When Mao-Tse Tung talks about con-
tradictions in society—all of the
things that affect people on a day-
to-day level, such as sexism, racial
discrimination—may be the
primary sources of our feelings of
oppression on a day-to-day level,
but are not necessarily primary
contradictions in the scientific
sense of understanding how society
is put together.

UNLESS WE DEFEAT CAPITALISM,
WE WILL NEVER DEFEAT THE
OPPRESSION WE EXPERIENCE
FROM MEN

The whole question of reformism
has to be seen in this light. Women
struggled around issues like divorce,
the vote, and other questions long
ago in this country. But because the
question of economics was not being
dealt with when women won the right
to divorce, they still did not have
the economic independence to make
that right effective. They had the
vote, but they did not have the
economic clout to have political
power. These things lead us back to
analyzing the primary contradiction,
which is the contradiction between
the ownership of the means of the
production being in private hands
and the relations of production being
collective.

It is hard for women to see how
much this affects the experiences
they have of male chauvinism. The
way that women's place in the home is
structured by the economic system,
the way that women's secondary place
in the job market is structured by
the economic system, are what creates
the super-structural, ideological,
cultural mystique of women's
weakness, women's inferiority and
the whole religious paraphernalia
that supports those mystiques. This
is not to say that the struggle for
emancipation of women should be
postponed while we are changing the
economic structure. We have to
struggle around women's issues con-
stantly, but we have to see the
fundamental importance of changing
the economic reality as a condition
for our own emancipation.

BMR: Women who are looking at econo-
mic issues have run into a couple of
stumbling blocks with various
groups in the left. The major theoretical
conflict at this point centers around
the left's position on the family. Many women feel that
their unpaid labor in the family is
not taken seriously. The whole
question of wages for housework has
come up, the question of housework
as an economic issue. There's a feel-
ing that women's portion of economic
reality is not being dealt with.

Andrea: Those are important issues,
but in analyzing how revolutions are
made, we have to realize it is going
to be led by people who are in con-
trol of the big factories where the
major production is going on.

We have to be realistic enough to
see that housewives are isolated in
their homes, that it's going to be
a hard job to get us, as a group, to
be a leading force. We can work to
organize ourselves, as we should,
but it isn't in the cards, historic-
ally, for us to be as conscious of
our power as are women who are work-
ing in a textile mill, for instance.

There are a whole lot of areas
where women are more oppressed than
any other category of worker—
domestics or prostitutes—but that's
not the definition of who is going
to organize the revolution and lead
it. Those of us who are not working
in factories have to see ourselves
as allies, not as the revolution.
That's simply scientific analysis.

Marxist-Leninists have never said
that the industrial proletariat
makes the revolution. Many revolu-
tions have failed because effective
alliances were not made with pea-
sants, women, etc., and Marxist-
Leninists have been the first to
recognize this, even if male chau-
vinism has prevented them from act-
ing forcefully according to their
own analyses.

BMR: What about working-class women
who are, for the most part, working
both in productive labor and working
in the home in unpaid labor? With
that kind of energy drain, how
productive are we going to be polit-
ically as members of the working
class?

Andrea: It is a very solid reality
that women have to work harder than
men in asserting themselves politi-
cally. We simply have to do the
organizational work anyhow. We have
to develop our power to the maximum
of our abilities, not letting any-
thing hold us back, at the same time
realizing that, objectively speaking,
we are held back.

BMR: We've discussed the family and
discussed the need for an indepen-
dent women's movement. The one area
we haven't discussed where I know
you differ from the current Marxist-
Leninist view is that you propose
an acceptance, from a civil libert-
ies perspective, of lesbian rights.
Would you discuss how you came to
that position and how you would
present it to the party?

Andrea: More important than present-
ing it to the party and persuading
them in an abstract, intellectual
way, is building a vanguard of revo-
lutionary women, including lesbians,
who can make themselves so indispen-
sable to the struggle, not only
around women's issues, but in attack-
ing the economic system as well in
very fundamental ways. We should
organize strikes in places where
women work—to make ourselves so
indispensable that demand for rec-
ognition of the right to be women
