Doctors Continue to Prescribe Drugs  
Proven to Cause Birth Defects  

SEEMS TO HAVE  
SIDE EFFECTS.  

UMM... THAT DRUG  

ee ie”  

Although the US Food and Drug Ad-  
ministration (FDA) withdrew its ap-  
proval for prescribing certain hor-  
mones and tranquilizers to pregnant  
women in 1973, some doctors are still  
handing out these dangerous drugs to  
expectant mothers with regularity.  

According to the National Disease  
and Therapeutic Index, American doc-  
tors wrote about 533,000 prescrip-  
tions for just one dangerous hormone,  
progesterone, last year. Doctors are  
continuing to prescribe at least six  
other hormones and tranquilizers to  
expectant mothers, even though gov-  
ernment studies have shown that these  
drugs can cause serious birth defe-  
cts.  

But, according to Dr. Sidney Wolfe,  
director of Ralph Nader's Health  
Research Group, doctors should bear  
all the blame, “When the FDA removed  
its approval," Wolfe said, "It did  
so in such a quiet...way that most  
doctors - even those who are reason-  
able and conscientious about their  
work - were unaware that it was done.  

Wolfe has sent a list of sugges-  
tions to the FDA to correct this pro-  
blem. He suggests that pregnancy war-  
nings be placed on all drug packages  
and in drug ads. In addition, Wolfe  
thinks that drug companies should be  
required to write "Dear Doctor" let-  
ters informing physicians of possible  
complications when the drugs are used  
during pregnancy.  

Wolfe's suggestions have met with  
tepid response from the FDA. Accord-  
ing to FDA spokesperson, Ed Nida, “It  
is possible to require warnings.”  
But, he says, the FDA “cannot keep  
doctors from prescribing drugs. Con-  
gress has told us: ‘Keep your hands  
off the innovative use of drugs by  
physicians'."  

Congress, by the way, is currently  
considering a series of amendments  
to the Food and Drug Act, which would  
require warnings of possible compli-  

cations to be included in the packag-  
es.  

Mothers’ Lawsuit Against Baby Food Company  

A group of San Francisco mothers  
is filing a lawsuit this week against  
the Baker/Beech-Nut Corporation, the  
makers of baby food, for false ad-  
vertising.  

The suit stems from a Baker/Beech-  
Nut mass-mailing which warned some  
760,000 mothers of possible dangers  
resulting from homemade baby food.  
The mailer claimed that homemade baby  
food could cause “methemoglobinemia“  
- or death resulting from the  
infant's inability to handle certain  
chemical nutrients in non-processed  
foods. The mailer also warned that  
homemade baby food could become con-  

taminated by bacteria, and it sup-  
plied that baby food made at home  
could be less nutritious than com-  
mercial products.  

The mothers, who are backed by an  
expert group of nutritionists and  
pediatricians, claim that the Beech-  
Nut advertising campaign was not only  
misleading, but amounted to "scare  
tactics." Food contamination, they  
point out, can occur as frequently in  
commercial preparation as home pre-  
paration.  

According to Dr. Ann De Huff Peters,  
a pediatrician and teacher at the  
University of California at San  

Homesteaders...  

women. She is particularly interested  
in finding information on minority  
women who homesteaded. Those who  
know of written accounts of women  
homesteaders are encouraged to con-

at CU-Boulder.

Diego, .~ hemoglobinemia is so rare  
that she has "never seen a case of  
(the disease) in 30 years of prac-  
tice." Dr. Huff Peters claims that she  
has "long advised (her) patients to  
prepare their own baby foods, because  
home-prepared baby foods can be as  
nutritious, or more nutritious, than  
commercial products."  

The mothers, who are taking their  
case to San Francisco Superior Court,  
are asking for a preliminary injun-  
ction to prevent the Beech-Nut Com-  
pany from sending out more mailers,  
and to force the firm to publish  
corrective advertising.

Nourishing Space Expands  

The Nourishing Space is 160 acres  
of women's land 30 miles southeast of  
Tucson, Arizona. It is maintained  
through the payments of women who  
live on it and pay rent, women who  
hike and camp on it and pay fees,  
conference fees, donations, loans and  
contributions of skills and labor.  
The women who live there are consid-  
ering the possibility of forming  
Nourishing Space support groups in  
urban centers across the country. If  
you can help with any of the above,  
write to women at Cave Canyon Ranch,  
P.O. Box D-11, Vail, AZ 85641 or  
call (602) 791-7686. There will be a

Land of Hope and What?  

The Organization for Economic Coop-  
eration and Development - a club of  
the Western world's richest nations  
- has published a survey which shows  
some surprising facts about the  
United States. Of the OECD's 24 mem-  
bers, the US ranks 3rd in per capita  
income, 11th in giving funds to dev-  
eloping countries, and 1st in attrac-  
ting foreign tourists. Only four  
countries in the OECD have higher  
infant mortality rates than the US,  
and in 1973 this country ranked 15th  
in dwelling completed. The States  
does still retain supremacy in some  
categories, though: it has the high-  
est per capita number of television  
sets and telephones, and the highest  
consumption of animal protein.  

Babies On Black Market  

Law enforcement officials in Los  
Angeles have expressed the fear that  
the Mafia may soon become involved in  
the flourishing illegal adoption bus-  
iness. Prospective adoptive parents  
don't want the 120,000 black, handi-  
capped or older children available  
for legal adoption in California. The  
number of available healthy, white,  
newborn babies has dropped since  
changing social mores, improved con-  
traceptives and liberalized abortion  
laws have changed the situation of  
their mothers. It takes three to five  
years of waiting to get a white baby,  
whereas you can get a black one in  
nine months. Black market profiteers  
often offer pregnant white women  
large sums of money, and pay all  
their medical bills in return for the  
right to sell the baby.
