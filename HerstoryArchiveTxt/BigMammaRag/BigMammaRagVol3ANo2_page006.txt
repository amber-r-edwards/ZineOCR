Lesbian Nation Politics:  
The Ties That Bind  

Sandia  

One difficult conflict of many  
women in the movement is try-  
ing to integrate the personal and  
the political. While radical  
feminism means that our per-  
sonal lifestyles have political  
implications, in times of crisis or  
decision the personal often  
dominates us — at the expense  
of the political.  

Given the fact that Lesbians,  
with their explicit commitment  
of energies to other women, are  
often the most active figures  
within the movement, then what  
a Lesbian does with her energies  
is of no small political impor-  
tance. Her efforts can provide  
direction for a total community,  
and while this can be effective at  
times, when the personal in-  
terferes, the political work falls  
into a paralyzing morass. We  
have not yet established a  
womanbody politic that is self-  
perpetuating.  

Feminist politics at this stage  
are directed toward women’s  
centers, newspapers and other  
publications, music, task forces,  
health resources (rape, abortion,  
self-defense), child care, equal  
rights, and some collective com-  
munity efforts. Women are  
drawn into one or more of these  
activities often for personal  
reasons as much as for any  
political vision. Being with other  
strong women who want to  
change the world is exciting, and  
involvement with the work  
allows women to gain support  
and to share friendships on a  
dynamic level.  

In the case of lesbians, who  
often work out of monogamous  
relationships, their commitment  
to the political is often depen-  
dent on the state and well-  
being of that relationship.  
However, monogamous  

relationships are often short-  
lived. When commitment to a  
mate ends, responsibility to a  
political activity ends. If — and it  
happens too frequently to be ig-  
nored — the two lovers are im-  
portant forces behind some  
political activity, and they split,  
the group’s momentum, and in  
some cases its actual existence,  
is undermined. If a split occurs  
between several pairs of lovers  
at the same time, all within one  
political unit, the disunity ex-  
tends its circles even wider. The  
lovers play musical beds, often  
involving the whole community  
with them. Everyone retreats to  
some personal space to lick their  
wounds. Then our com-  
mitments are revealed to be the  
short-sighted, personal stroke  
involvements that they are. On  
such shaky foundations is much  
of our politics predicated.  

In Berkeley, a whole com-  

mune living situation ended  
because of this. In Denver, the  
Lesbian Task Force which had  
been a vital action group was im-  
mobilized for a while when  
several members who happened  
to be key figures in the group  
split from their lovers. With the  
interchanging of partners,  
redefinition of priorities began.  
Some women had become in-  
volved only because their lovers  
were. When they split up,  
visions faded. For some time the  
Task Force was in limbo, even  
though it has since been  
revitalized, it has been witness  
to the stagnating effects of per-  
sonal conflicts.  

There are several ways of  
analyzing the personal/political  
split, including a rethinking of  
our notions of politics, and per-  
sonal responsibilities toward  
other women.  

Traditional system politics go  
on no matter what is happening  
on a personal level. Behind the  
seemingly different ideologies  
espoused by leftists or rightist  
groups is an underlying  

denominator which pervades  
and supports their efforts. The  
structure of male politics is set  
up as a perpetuating machine to  
reinforce patriarchal values and  
keep the reins of power and  
social control. This common  
denominator unites democrats,  
republicans, birchers,  
weathermen, October league.  
Though radical politicos may  
scorn former leftists for now  
having settled in suburbia, the  
retired activist is not actually a  
cop-out. His participation  
politically did not stop, for his  
personal lifestyle reinforces the  
goals of the ongoing system. The  
male system is pervasive  
enough to include party  
members, protesters, defectors.  
It is an ism that survives wars  
and marriages, schisms and  
criticisms. It may not survive its  
own rape of the earth; it may,  
however, survive feminism, un-  
less women resolve the per-  

sonal detractions, setting up  
some code of ethics which in-  
tegrate the personal with the  
political.  

Women who accept responsi-  
ble positions in the movement  
might do well to consider some  
kind of long-term contract.  
Shulamith Firestone in The  
Dialectics of Sex discusses this  
idea, and while women may be  
reluctant to make a commitment  
for seven years as she suggests,  
they might consider other alter-  
natives that will encourage  
women to see themselves in  
terms of the larger community,  
perhaps a National Feminist Par-  
ty.  

Another aspect which should  
be considered is our con-  
ditioning about relationships.  
What heterosexuals have going  
for them is a structure that  
already exists and however im-  
perfect has provided some kind  
of framework. Lesbians have  
only personal relationships and  
while that in itself offers some  
kind of freedom, it also can foster  
some instabilities.  

Lesbian relationships and  
their coming together, holding  
together and splitting apart  
show the influence of the  
culture of romance that prevails  
in this society. True, in terms of  
coming together and the  
possibilities for joy and intensity

while things are going well  
reveal that some women have  
freed themselves from some  
traditional notions of love and  
sexuality. However, we still  
show the results of our cultural  
conditioning when it comes to  
the “departures.”  

In a sense, Lesbians are worse  
off than a woman in a hetero-  
sexual relationship because  
there is no contract and we tend  
to commit some of the usual  
mistakes. In ‘falling out of love’  
we often fall into the same trap  
of objectification. That is, the  
person you split from, rather  
than being treated subjectively,  
“sisterly” as our rhetoric goes,  
becomes treated as a love object.  
When women move out of the  
“romantic phase” to avoid the  
“working out phase” we are em-  
bodying a hippy “things should  
flow” philosophy rather than  
some view which is more in line  
with the feminine ideal. The ob-  

jectification is also evidenced as  
women move from one woman  
to another in a way reminiscent  
of male treatment of women.  
One woman terms this the  
“Interchangeability of women”  
which allows us to fall out of love  
one week, and exchange one  
woman with another the next.  
The pattern is the same, only the  
face changes.  

Until women can make the  
“falling out” periods of their  
lives as free from the con-  
ditioning of this society as they  
have with the positive “falling  
in” period, there are yet some  
concrete things women in the  
community can do. Formerly we  
have always thought that the af-  
fairs between two people were  
private. Yet, since the political  
well-being is so dependent on  
the status of relationships, this  
attitude must change — par-  
ticularly since we are moving  
away from notions of ourselves  
as isolated beings and moving  
into a sense of bonding and com-  
munity. What happens should  
be everyone's business.  

When a relationship is begin-  
ning to fail it should be the  
responsibility of the involved  
parties to make it known in  
whatever way seems most com-  
fortable. The community should  
then help with the transition to  
make sure that the women  

receive from the group the per-  
sonal support they need so that  
retreat and withdrawal from  
community work is not  
necessitated.  

Any attempts to blend our per-  
sonal lives with the life of a  
womanbody politic will make  
both levels of action stronger.  
This may mean more struc-  
turing, for in our fear of  
hierarchies and the power  

politics around us we have gone  
almost an anarchist route. This  
does not mean that we see only  
the narrow view of monogamy  
versus non-monogamy, but that  
we begin offering women struc-  
tures and goals that can allow  
for the continuance of our  
growth at both the national level  
as well as our personal well-  
being.

Moving Towards  

Center

We are not machines run  
down and out of time.  

We are womenpeople becom-  
ing.  

This is our beginning, the first  
step in creating new universes.  
How foolish to have thought  
man has done everything, has  
reached the zenith of civilization  
and technocratic living. Man has  
made incomprehensible  
“discoveries” of outer space  
while ignoring the essence and  
reality of inner spaces. We need  
only look around us at the  
human environmental waste  
and devastation to know that  
technology is good but has been  
used destructively. Goddess  
only knows the depth of the  

the discovery of atom splitting to  
drop the A-bomb on Hiroshima.  
Following this top priority use of  
the elements our leading scien-  
tists and military masters then  
applied themselves to providing  
nuclear heating systems, sub-  
marines and the like. Men have  
insisted on running and ruling  
the world on the premise of what  
they know and have invented or  
misrepresented. But the tides  
they are changing and a new  
order has been called for, the  
louder the better. May the call be  
as nerve-splitting as the shrill  
whistle used in the Battle of  
Algiers. The war of concepts has  
begun, no more laughing, no  
more fun if I may paraphrase one  
of my girlhood chants.  

Women’s Work  
Women’s work begins at such  
a point of awareness and  
worldround consciousness that  
has been in evidence. We are go-  
ing through a process of involve-  
ment that makes it difficult if not  
impossible to ever be inactive  
again. The pain of the untried,  
the unspoken, the unchallenged  
would be intolerable. Staying in  
motion has become our prime  
concern. Our energies until now  
have been dissipated if not com-  
pletely destroyed through our  
participation in a one-sided com-  
plex of ideas such as the  
American government, original-  
ly thought to have represented  
the “People.” Humanity has  
been operating way off center;  
Huwomanity now seeks the  
center. The center is woman.  
Some women are getting  
together; they are a small bond  
of bandits, banded together for  
the strength, love and  
femininity needed for a journey  
into the unknown. We are not  
persisting on knowing and ac-  
ting out what we think we know;  
we are seeking to know the  
unknown. We are seeking that  
portion of existence considered  
by masculine hierarchy to be of  
no value in a competitive struc-  
tured world. In fact, the motion  
could be dangerous to the co-  
opted power now ruling and to  

the mass-minded public living in  
fear of any type of con-  
sciousness that would require  
an individual “giving up”  
something or having to make a  
commitment to... evolution. I  
personally feel committed to the  
motion in the ocean of  
womanity. I seek worldround  
health, wealth and happiness  
and I am willing to give  
whatever, whenever. I seek not  
to change the universe because  
greater forces than mine set it in  
motion to begin with, but I do  
believe it possible for me to con-  
tribute more to the positive force  
of balance and less to the  
negative forces now holding  

sway. The equation balances  
out.  

Capitalism  
more than it gives, uses more  

than it replaces; wants the  
greatest something for as little  
effort as possible. Of course this  
that we are living under today  
has far out-grossed the original  
naive concept of capitalism and  
democracy. Today we have  
confusion.  

Woman's work is and will be  
the applying of forces to keep  
things moving toward es-  
tablishing creative change. A  
woman must choose the  
medium environment through  
which she will accomplish this  
“work.” There are enough  
women’s groups, publications  
and activities to help point the  
way for any neophyte. One thing  
is certain; we must maintain a  
kind of way of working side by  
side, a tolerance for the difficult  
and prolonged period of  
research and work, and a loving  
acceptance of one another  
which will continue to reinforce  
woman energy (womenergy).  
Women have been taught to re-  
ject (separate) for so many sub-  
ve reasons within the massive  
overt isms-schisms of sex, race,  
age and economics. So there is  
work a woman must do for her  
own inner growth, change of be-  
ing and revised welfare but she  
can do this work in the company  
of her fellow women.  

The whole universe is only  
matter and energy. That's it  
folks. It is what it is and it’s all in-  
terchangeable. Matter is that  
energy which has mass. Energy  
is the pure light force which  
changes all things inevitably.  
The objective world is energy  
manifested as matter. Man  
matter. Men found their center,  
split it and brought chaos within  
the world. Wom-energy: women  
finding their center and doing  
what? That is the unknown we  
are seeking. Shall we get  
bored/poured into our surface  
molds and screwed into a  
place/space for which no  
questions are asked and the rape  
is complete? Or will we move  
together toward new dimen-  
sions?
