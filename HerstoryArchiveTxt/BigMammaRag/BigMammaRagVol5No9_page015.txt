Dear BMR,  

Thank you, Kathy Riley, for your  
very fair and objective articles  
on NOW and the SWP. I, too, echo  
the final statement of your analysis,  

"why on earth do they want to work  
together in the same organization?”  

I believe the problem is a mis-  
understanding on the part of the SWP  
as to what NOW is all about. We are  
a civil rights organization. Tradi-  
tionally, we have brought about change  
through law. Many methods were used  
to effect change. But one must remem-  
ber that permanent change comes about  
in the places where decisions and laws  
are made. This is the only system  
that we have at the moment, therefore,  
this is the system that must  
change.  

SWP/NOW members are constantly talk-  
ing about "defending" or "fighting"  
for women's rights. The fights have  
been with NOW or defending themselves  
from the FBI. The only action they  
ever initiate is to stand around in  
the street with picket signs. Only  
the Archie Bunkers notice.  

In Denver, since the first of the  
year, five NOW chapters have grown  
from the original two. When SWP  
ideas were voted down in some chap-  
ters, these members formed their own.  
All attempts to work cooperatively on  
local issues have been rejected by  
the two chapters made up of, or con-  
trolled by, SWP members. They re-  
fused to attend the abortion demon-  
stration at the HEW office in Aug-  
ust. They refused to participate in  
the Equality Day walkathon for the  
ERA. They refused to work on the  
rooms for battered women at Brandon  
House. Chapter members from all over  
the eastern slope attended their  
speakout on Sept. 15, but were not  
permitted to speak out.  

The Denver Post and the Rocky  
Mountain News on Sunday, Oct. 23 had  
pictures of the Auraria Chapter pick-  
eting President Carter. One sign read  
"Free Abortion on Demand." That is  
not NOW's position. Our policy is a  
woman's right to choose abortion.  
There is a world of difference between  
the two ideas. As a NOW member, I  
resent this distortion. Is it delib-  
erate or is it ignorance?  

Our differences are probably irrec-  
oncilable. None of us questions their  
right to do what they do. We question  
the wisdom of doing it in the context  
of NOW.  

Why can't SWP members work within  
their own organization?  

For Equality NOW,

Dear Sisters,  
Recently there has been a lot of dis-  
cussion regarding the fiasco of the  
Gaybreak program featuring a Coors  
company representative. In the time  
following that show a member of the  
feminist community has been subjected  
to intense scrutiny.  

Linda Ryan has personally been  
attacked by women not known by the  
community for their political visibility. The  
trashing by these women of another  
woman is deplorable. That Linda Ryan,  
who has never refused to assist femi-  
nists or feminist causes, has been  
their target, is inexcusable. That  
these women have chosen to zero in on  
the Velvet Hammer for questionably  
real or imagined reasons is absurd.  
We, as a community, must not tolerate  
this type of divisive action.  

If the women of Gaybreak, or associ-  
ates thereof, wish to spread gossip,  
malicious or otherwise, let them do  
so in an open manner. Let them ap-  
proach the feminist community with  
fact, not defensive rationalization.  
Let the feminist community judge the  
events for what really happened and  
who really messed over whom.  

In Solidarity,

This case is important because af-  
firmative action is being weakened  
and possibly eliminated (take case).  
It affirms that affirmative action  
can be a guide to promotion, hiring,  
firing, and transfer where there has  
been past discrimination in getting  
these jobs; seniority is not necessar-  
ily the fairest guide to follow.  

Mountain Bell is part of American  
Telephone and Telegraph Co., which  
last year became the first corpora-  
tion on earth to make profits of $4  
billion in one year (1976). Their  
profits of $4.6 billion came from  
their pre-tax income of $6 billion.  
They were able to save $2.4 billion  
by using various tax loopholes to  
avoid paying $2.4 billion in Federal  
taxes. (They paid only 9.4% of their  
income in taxes.) This makes AT&T  
the largest welfare recipient in Amer-  
ica.

Laundry Workers  

FROM PAGE 10  
Juanita: We used to have a union  

in there, but there were some women  
there who didn't want a union, so  
finally all of the women quit. I was  
the last one to stay. No one else  
was in the union but me, so I finally  
had to drop it. No one ever came up  
with a strike or anything to make things  
better. The union never came down  
to the laundry, at least while  

I was there, probably because the  
other women didn't cooperate with  
the union too much.  

Addie, one of the women, got a  
raise from talking with the assistant  
manager after she dropped out of the  
union. They got a union and then two  
or three weeks later they dropped it.  
I don't know who came and told them  
not to have a union, that a union  
wouldn't do them any good, but some-  
body must have. I felt that if we  
all have a union, if we'd all co-op-  
erate together we'd probably get some  
more money, but being in there by  
myself wouldn't do any good. I think  
the boss gave some of the others some  
extra money or small raises in return  

for dropping the union.  

The others would never talk to me  
about anything because of my hearing  
or maybe because they thought they  
were brighter than me. I never had  
any education or anything.  

My Daddy didn't have much money to  
spend on sending us to school. Any  
money he had was spent on food, try-  
ing to raise us up. He died about 6  

years ago. He had a lot of trouble  
with Social Security too. He was an  
old man; 89 when he died. He finally  

got Social Security about a year be-  
fore he died, after he had worked so  
hard.  

I pay $21 for $52 worth of food  
stamps, and still they think that's  
too much food for me.  

I worked in the laundry at the  
Denver Hilton for a while. My boss  
would come up to me and say “Juanita,  
how come you never smile? Everybody  
here smiles but you." He said that  
at this place you have to be ‘Mr.  
Smiles'. I said "How can you be  
smiling when you don't hear right?  

I wish I could be like that, but I  
can't walk around smiling all the  
time."

Adrienne then begins to read from  
her new book, The Dream of A Common  
Language (to be out in December) and  

from her Twenty One Love Poems.  

I dreamed you were a poem/This  
is how I can love myself as only a  
woman can love me/I choose to love  
this time for once with all my intelli-

pulsations into images for the relief  
of the body and the reconstruction of  
the mind.  

Then the magic was broken by real-  
ity. Oviana Press has been ravaged.  
Possibly in only half an hour, by  
only two people, perhaps even women  
destroyed the plates for 3 volumes of  
the Ladder, Rita Mae Brown's Plain  
Brown Rapper, a reissue of Jeanette  
Foster's Sex Variant Women in Liter-  
ature. Adrienne and Susan Griffith  
have issued a statement calling for  
the censure of this act by the entire  
women's community.  

For me and several others there  
was an additional space with Adrienne  
a quiet, intimate breakfast. I con-  
fess that she has been my model and  
often my solace since 1967. Reading  
her in my isolation and pre-conscious-  

ness. I have been Page of Wands to  
her Queen. She has been mother to my  
daughter. Now I birth myself, I  

birth others. Mothers, daughters,  
midwives, sisters. The process is a  
continuum knowing no age or time.  
Thank you for this love.

Day Upon Day  

FROM PAGE 12  

After the play, a panel was formed  
of Judith Aplon, theatre dept. direc-  
tor at CWC; Lenore Walker, a psychol-  
ogist; Juliet; Stella; Sharron; Joe;  
Leanne; Lois Cooper; Sandra and  
Joanna. The panel discussion center-  
ed on the lives of the women. They  
identified themselves by the crime  
they were convicted of, their sen-  
tence and their families and the work  
they were doing in the joint.  

At an informal lunch and in the  
panel discussion, more information  
came out regarding the treatment of  
the women by the institution. Every-  
one praised the liberalism of the  
Superintendent, who had been a high  
school principal. For the 61 women  
prisoners at CWCI, the institution  
employs 39 guards, some of which are  
men. The prisoner population is  
about 1/3 white with Chicano and  
Black and a few Native American wom-  
en comprising the rest. Racism was  
not mentioned at any time.  

The panel, as well as the play,  
mentioned that the programs for the  
women were sewing, cooking, and  

cleaning.  

JOE'S HAIR AFFAIR (the cutting corral)  

1608 E. COLFAX at FRANKLIN 355-5951 = denver, co  

GET YOUR HAIR STYLED BY  

Big Mama Rag Vol. 5 No. 9  
The sewing consists of  
sewing uniforms for the men and wom-  
en who work at state institutions,  
uniforms for male prisoners, and  
diapers. The women are paid top  
wages, $1.50 per day and sew on old  
machines.  

The women said how difficult it  
was not to be able to make decisions  
about their lives and their everyday  
actions and then to be expected to  
go out into society, pick up their  
lives and care for their children.  

They credited Juliet with sticking  
it out, that she was persistent in  
wanting to help the women do theatre.  
Though at first the women's response  
was good, attendance dwindled until  
she proved herself and her intentions  
to them. The women said they were  
tired of do-gooders coming to the  
joint and raising their expectations  
with promises and pulling out when  
things didn't go as they, the out-  
siders, wanted. Prisoners are made  
a lot of promises, not only by out-  
siders, but by the institution, and  
so few are kept. One woman told how  
she had wanted to go on work-release  
and had been promised by the insti-  
tution that she could if she lined  
up a job. She got a job, filled out  
all the correct forms, and waited  
until told she couldn't go; there  
was no space for her in work-release.  
She wants to pursue a lawsuit and  
needs legal help.  

My own experiences with prisoners  
have been in jail where people do not  
know what is happening: they haven't  
gone to trial, they can't make bail,  
and most have not talked with a  
Public Defender. Racial tension was  
always high and the guard/prisoner  
relationship was barely tolerable  
with the guards preventing the people  
from existing under normal, humane  
conditions--physically and mentally.  

Prison life isn't necessarily as  
turbulent as jail. In prison, the  
women have been sentenced; they go  
through classification. The rules  
are more clearly defined (although  
they can be changed or re-interpreted  
at any time). A routine is es-  
tablished, and life can take on a  
pattern that gets to be acceptable.  

Even so, there is an undercurrent  
that is always present. The guards  
can be capricious, and the insti-  
tution upholds them. Their asses  
are covered because it is always we  
against them. I felt the play was  
understated with the tensions barely  
visible, and if I was a prisoner you  
can bet that I would understate my  
situation publicly because to be  
honest and open would mean that I  
never got out to act in the play.  

The women in the play react to each  
other with sensitivity and concern.  
Since they rewrote the play, and it  
reflects their attitudes, I saw  
women not vocalizing sisterhood, but  
enacting it. The most political part  
of the play is the scene with the  
Parole Board, and as brought out by  
the panel, they twist you and jerk  
you around and you are never sure  
what will happen. You play the game  
and try to be in programs in the  
joint, not get written up, be "good"  
and you have a chance to get out,  
but if someone, anyone, whispers  
you are defiant, violent, uppity--  
you lose. Prison life for women  
reflects society's concepts of what  
we should do and be. It is a warning  
to all us uppity women... beware.
