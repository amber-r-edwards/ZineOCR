Psychploitation

Dear Big Mama,

Bouquets of roses for ex-
cellent journalism to Susan-
na Smith for her article(s)
on the Rape Hotline and
"Take Back the Night" march
in October's issue of BMR.
Do you know how validating
and spirit strengthening
such writing is for us who
read your paper in places
like San Francisco where the
‘Feminist Therapy' community
stands as an all pervasive
and unmovable monolith.

I've been recently radi-
calized by my experiences
of torture and brainwashing
in the mental health system.
I spent 1979 through 1981
recovering from the drugs
and manipulations of the
system, while at the same
time getting rejected by
feminist therapists and the
women's community at large
who support their sister
therapists. I learned the
recuperative value of self-
help and peer support and
have been spending the last
two years trying to figure
out how to confront and
change the poisonous atti-
tudes of practitioners of
psychotherapy.

By the time January's is-
sue of BMR is out I will be
going through a deposition
in my medical malpractice
lawsuit against a husband
and wife team of psychia-
trists, who exploited the
spirit out of me by all the
tools at psychiatry's dis-
posal including sexual as-
sault, (used by them to
cure me of my lesbian 'pre-
occupation'). It was not
‘feminist’ therapists who
validated me in my demoral-
ized state then, or encour-
aged me to pursue legal re-
prisal against the shrinks.
They were too immersed in
the misinformation layered
onto their minds in their
patriarchal universities,
and pushed me away because
of the labels I'd been
given.

During my deposition I
will be questioned before a
whole array of attorneys for
the defense and the two
shrink defendants. My attor-
ney warns me that their in-
tent will be to break me
down and force me to give
up the lawsuit. They will
especially target not only
my sexual behavior (manipu-
lated as it was by these so
called "radical" shrinks)
but also my sexual fantas-
ies, since the court has al-
lowed them to subpoena my
detailed journals that I
kept during those five years
of "treatment" (1974-79).
The court also disallows
me to have any support pre-
sent during this grilling.

I can expect to be addressed
as a criminal. And the real
pisser for me is that the
nature of the justice sys-
tem is that this type of
lawsuit can only be a civil
suit not a criminal suit.
It's a voyeuristic orgy at
my expense once again.

So I learn a new way the
exploitative nature of capi-
talistic professionalism as
it's directed toward women.

But since I've been tel-
ling the story of my exper-
iences in the Mental Health
System to other women I've
also heard innumerable
stories from them of rape,
not only in the psych wards,
but in the therapists off-
ices as well; rape not re-
ported because of the dif-
ficulty of finding women
professionals who are cap-
able of going beyond their
own oppressive attitudes
toward women who have been
psychiatrically labeled and
are seen; therefore, as
“unrapeable".

Meanwhile I operate an
informal hotline for women
locked up in local psych
wards. Recently a woman
with a psychiatric history
that ended two years ago
was locked up for complain-
ing of a rape at a rape-
crisis center, here. She
was sent to Mt. Zion Hos-
pital and was drugged
against her will and kept
as an involuntary patient.
I encouraged her to go for
a "probable cause" hearing
and attended it. We were
assured by the patients
rights advocate and the pu-
blic defender that she
would win her discharge be-
cause of her clarity in
presenting herself and her
survival plans for after
discharge. But thanks to a
“feminist" psychiatric so-
cial worker who presented
this woman as "vulnerable
to rape" because of her
minimal financial resources,
she lost her hearing. The
hearing officer, who is a
rather liberal male might
have questioned such an
evaluation had it been gi-
ven by a male, but instead,
was persuaded to rule in
favor of the hospital's
prescription of longer in-
voluntary treatment by a
so-called "feminist".

And so we must struggle
on. And sadly we find our-
selves struggling against
our sisters who stubbornly
resist acknowledging their
collaboration with the
sexist, racist, classist
bias of psychotherapy, and
exert enormous energy
defending themselves in the
face of our demands that
they listen to our experi-
ences. Eventually they will
come to see themselves as
our natural allies and

give up their insistence on
single issue organizing
which keeps our women's
community divided.

Please never stop speaking
out as you women of the
Women's Psychiatric Inmate
Liberation Front so bravely
do.

With praise, gratitude and
love,

Free Juanita

Dear Friends,

We are sending you this
letter because you have
been identified to us as a
person or group who may be
interested in or involved in
support work for women in
prison. We are five women
from Lansing, Michigan cal-
ling ourselves Support Group
for Women In Prison. For the
past three years our main
work has been in support
of Juanita Thomas.

Ms. Thomas is a 40 year
old Black woman and mother
of five. She is a resident
of Lansing and was employed
by Michigan State Universi-
ty for twelve years. Juanita
is serving a life sentence
for first degree murder
in the Huron Valley Women's
Facility in Ypsilanti. She
was convicted in June, 1980
after she killed her boy-
friend in self-defense.
Prior to the incident that
resulted in his death, he
had abused and battered
Juanita for many years. In
July, 1983 Ms. Thomas' ap-
peal was denied. This has
been a severe blow to Juan-
ita, her family and those
of us who support her. Her
court appointed attorney
has removed himself from
the case.

Support Group For Women
In Prison consists of a dec-
ision-making committee
(Priscilla Feigenbaum, Ann
Francis, Billie Piassa,
Janet Schmitt and Vicki
Shafarman) and volunteers.
For two years we wrote, vi-
sited and provided assis-
tance to Juanita Thomas and
her family. In September
1982, we formalized our com-
mitment and formed a sup-
port group to address the
needs of Ms. Thomas and the
broader issues of women in
prison. The decision-making
committee works with Juanita
and makes no policy decisions
or plans without her appro-
val. Our goals are:

1. To provide emotional sup-
port, financial aid, and
legal assistance to Juanita
Thomas.

2. To find legal remedies
and organize political acti-
vities which will free Juan-
ita from prison.

3. To educate ourselves and
other people about women in
prison, particularly batter-
ed women who kill.

4. To organize political act-
ivities which will prevent
women who defend themselves
from going to prison.

5. To work in coalitions with
other prison support groups.

We believe that Juanita
Thomas should not be in pri-
son. We see in this case and
many others around the coun-
try that without money or
connections the legal sys-
tem does not lead to justice
particularly for women and
people of color.

Support Group For Women
In Prison realizes that many
of you, like us, have more
needs than resources but we
hope that by exchanging in-
formation we may all grow
stronger.

This is what we need.
Financial Support: 1. To con-
tinue personal support.
2. To finance defense work
including the hiring of an
attorney.

Informational Support:

1. To share strategies for
defending battered women who
kill. 2. To share names of
lawyers, support groups or
individuals who may be able
to help.

We ask that you do what
you can. Juanita welcomes
any letters or cards. Her
address is: Juanita Thomas
#161091; 3511 Bemis Road,
Ypsilanti, MI 48191.

Until Juanita is free,

Criticism

Dear Big Mama,

I just read your self-
criticism in the December
'83 issue. One of the things
you criticized yourself for
was that in the March and
April '82 issues of BMR, you
rejected "the ones from a
Jewish perspective,...while
those from a Christian per-
spective were accepted."
What about my article on
spirituality in the March
issue? It was written from
the perspective of a Jewish
witch, but just because I no
longer follow the Jewish re-
ligion, I am still very much
a Jew. I know it's a small
oversight, but it's just not
true that you didn't print
anything from a Jewish per-
spective. I think it's good
that you criticize yourself
for the articles you reject-
ed, but, hey, I fasted on
Yom Kippur until I was twenty
and kept kosher and one thing
I can't toler-
