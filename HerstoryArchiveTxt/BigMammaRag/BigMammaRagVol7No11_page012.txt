Feminist: Therapy And Other Bad Habits

Constance Perenyi

Last month, I celebrated my first
year of being out of therapy. Hurray
for me? Why am I writing this? Do
I even believe in therapy anymore?
Did I ever? Or did my first lover
do a good job of convincing me that
there was something desperately
wrong with me? Had the world already
done that? My parents? My friends?
Other women? Why is it that now, a
year later, I sometimes feel this
shadow, this brooding suspicion that
there is still something wrong with
me? That someday I will have to re-
turn to therapy in desperation and
failure? And all I really remember
was spending the time, the money.
Now, I am sure that I bought an hour
of friendship every week. I needed
to have someone to talk to - I was
so alone. Just my lover and me. And
as I already said, she had a stake
in keeping me down, convincing me
that I was unhealthy and that, of
course, was the reason that the re-
lationship was failing. I was the
one who was in therapy - not her.
And I was also the one who needed
other women to talk with. A his-
tory of abandonment - lover left me,
then therapist left me.

And I have been getting clearer,
feeling better ever since.

I suggested to her that we should
meet every other week so that I
could begin easing myself out of
therapy. She stated that such a de-
cision was a major one and that it
too was a process in which both of
us had to be involved. We did not
discuss modification or termination
again for another eight months.

In other cases, therapy seemed to
hasten crises. I will never deny
that my therapist fueled my discon-
tent in some very positive, affirm-
ing ways. She encouraged me to
seek better options in my life -
to feel my anger, hurt, and strength -
and shortly, situations began to
change. My relationship with my
lover ended faster than it probab-
ly would have otherwise - I was
spared that slow death. And before
I got out of therapy, I quit an
unsufferable job. At the same time,
I began to make art, preparing for
a show that my therapist was instru-
mental in arranging.

And yet, as much as I needed the
attention that I was getting, some-
thing felt wrong. With the benefit
of hindsight, I see that I became
dependent on therapy (and if any-
one pointed that out during my
therapy period, I would resist, be-
come defensive). I remember how
much I talked about it (and still
do, actually). The main topic of
conversation with newly made friends
was what was happening in therapy...
we spent a lot of time on theory,
splashing around in feelings, and
focusing on how we were dealing with
things. For a while, that was ex-
hilarating; it was so affirming to
realize that we were not destined
to be victims of our feelings, feel-
ings which prior to therapy had al-
ways been shrouded in mystery, or
forbidden like taboos.

But, enough is enough, and too
much is a dependency. When all I
was doing was talking, I literally
stopped doing. Instantly, I became
defensive when women asked me what
I was really doing with my life;
and when I looked at the calendar
(and my checkbook) and noted how
long I had been doing this, I be-
came frightened. And also, somewhere
along the way, I got bored.

I also began to question. It seemed
that in times of real crisis, my
therapist was not there for me as
I wanted her to be. Either she could
not see me when I was feeling des-
perate, or she was too busy to even
return my calls. At first, I felt
angry, slighted; and then I began
again to realize the simple truth
of my own aloneness. Weekly session
or not, when it came down to it I
was ultimately responsible for my-
self. And while I did realize that
early in the game, it took me months
to extricate myself because I was
so unsure of my own ability to
solve problems. And because I still
wanted to believe that if I stuck
with my therapist long enough, she
would give me some definitive ans-
wers, she would tell me to live hap-
pily ever after.

Of course, that never happened,
nor did I really want it to. I
just wanted to be told that I did
not have to struggle so hard all my
life. The funny thing is that the
real struggle did not begin until
after I was out of therapy. For the
first time in years, I began to
keep a journal - without my Thurs-
day afternoons, I knew that I had to
do something to keep up with myself.
I also rediscovered what it meant to
be politically active. By beginning
to commit myself to Big Mama Rag,

I started to break through the
silence that even therapy had pre-
served. Tentatively at first, I sha-
red with other women, and found sur-
prisingly enough, that I was not
as alone as I had believed.

Actually, my sessions ended as
quickly as they began, and not real-
ly as I would have liked. Although
my therapist assured me that she
was not leaving, and that I could
call her whenever I wanted, I soon
found that she had no intention of
dealing with me as a client again.
Later, I learned that she had start-
ed to see new women, and had over-
booked her schedule; and yet, I
still feel distance and tension when-
ever I run into her socially. And
at times, I feel ripped-off, so
much so that I wanted to begin this
article by totally disclaiming ther-
apy as a process. And still, I admit
that I got a lot out of it, and so
have many other women.

But, it is a process which is as
potentially harmful as it is help-
ful; so I want to offer some per-
sonal perspective on what it means
to be involved in therapy as a
client.

WHO IS THERAPY FOR?

Therapy is for women who can
afford it. It is also for women who
probably do not have other ways of
dealing with feelings that they
have stuffed into the back of their
existences since childhood. Tradi-
tionally, we are discouraged from
taking validation from our anger,
and are belittled for our hopes,
our fears, our love. Denial of emo-
tion has been an element of control
exercised over women for centuries -
without the strength of our feelings,
we as women remain powerless, non-
threatening.

In many ways, these same traditions
keep us isolated from each other. It
is common for a woman to reach her
twenties, thirties, fifties, even
seventies without ever sharing her
feelings with another person, es-
pecially with another woman. So, we
often awake one day finding ourselves
in dire need of a confidant only to
discover that we do not have a
friend, or at least “that kind” of
friend. For women in the 1970s,
therapy seems a viable option; not
only does a therapist listen, she
also listens and unscrambles (or at
least she should).

While I was in therapy, I had no
idea that there are women who were
somehow lucky enough to have friends
with whom they have shared, with
whom they have worked out real forms
of mutual and caring communica-
tion. In the last year though, I
have met women who seem clear in
their relationships (with themselves
as well as with others), who have
"therapy skills" without ever having
been in therapy. Likewise, I know
women who have been in therapy for
some time, still refusing to use
those skills.

And yet, I believe that no matter
how close a woman is to her friends,
the distance and perspective that
a therapist can offer is, at times,
invaluable. I also see that friend-
ships can be unnecessarily burdened,
especially in a crisis situation.
And for that reason, therapy fills
important needs in our communities.

THE THERAPEUTIC PHENOMENON

It is not surprising, therefore,
that the concept of therapy caught
on so rapidly. Nor is it surpri-
sing that this has contributed to
the growth of a feminist therapy
subculture. And it is here that we
must look for the roots, and dan-
gers, of dependencies.

What we must realize is that every therapist has
a bias, and we must ask if she is
willing to show enough of herself
(politically and personally) so
that her clients can make a choice.
While these problems may not be
common to every therapist/client
relationship, we must be aware that
this is a complex relationship by
its very nature. And this leads
to the question of whether therapy,
at least as we know it, and feminism,
at least as we would like to know
it, are mutually exclusive. First
of all, there is the tension that
grows out of the hierarchical sense
of therapy. In many ways, it is
a contradiction that enforces roles,
that puts one woman in a teaching
position, and another in a learn-
ing place. And this is healthy
only if it has room to grow and
change.
