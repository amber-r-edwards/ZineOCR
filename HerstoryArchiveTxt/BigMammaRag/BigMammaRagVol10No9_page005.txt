Grenadian Peoples

(Reprinted from the June 1982
issue of Spare Rib, a women's
liberation magazine, London.)

In March 1979, after cen-
turies of oppression and
struggle, the Grenadian
People's Revolutionary Gov-
ernment took power after the
most bloodless revolution in
history. Grenada and the Gren-
adines (Carriacou and Petit
Martinique) are the ‘Spice
Islands' of the Caribbean.
Now their people are strug-
gling to achieve self-deter-
mination.

Last spring, ten white Lon-
doners, five women and five
men, went to Grenada for a
month to work and to learn
from what is happening there.

Although our impressions
are bound to be superficial
on some levels, I think we
were able to gain an overview
of the situation in Grenada.
We were welcomed into people's
homes and visited by many who
were willing to talk about
their lives with great open-
ness. Also the island is
small....and we were free to
go wherever we wanted.

We five women worked in ag-
ricultural co-ops, in the one
school for mentally handi-
capped children, in the Re-
source Centre for the distri-
bution of imported books
(some of them politically
progressive, but others the
left-over dregs of western
educational systems - reac-
tionary, out-dated and com-
pletely inappropriate). Three
of us also spent some time in
the Ministry of Health.

The first two and a half
years of the revolution have
been spent in a massive ef-
fort to wipe out illiteracy,
repair roads, lay pipes for
water, and improve the stan-
dard of health and housing.
This effort includes resist-
ing American CIA plots to de-
stabilise the revolution, and
encouraging people to parti-
cipate actively in their
country's decision-making
processes. The government is
also trying to work with mem-
bers of the old bureaucracy
in the Ministries and pri-
vately owned firms. (Until
recently, even the electri-
city company was privately
owned.) For all these reasons
there are, for the time be-
ing, no statutory elections
in Grenada; the government
believes it is necessary to

have a strong and stable gov-
ernment through the initial
stages. In fact, people are
involved in decision making
at national and local levels,
are equipped with information,
and have forums for question-
ing; there is no doubt that
the system is already far
more participative than a for-
mal parliamentary democracy.

country's 100 villages. Its
coordinating body is 'The
Women's Desk', which is part
of the Ministry of Social
Affairs, and its brief is
"to organize education and
training opportunities for
women, and investigate the
law with a view to changing
the legal status of women. To

WOMEN STEP FORWARD

Women are taking a lead in
the transformation of the
Grenadian health and educa-
tion systems, the building up
of agricultural co-operatives
and the struggle for their
own rights through the Nation-
al Women's Organisation.

At present there is only
one woman minister nationally,
but women have additional
rights of representation at
parish and village level. The
first National Women's Con-
ference of Grenada was held
in June, 1979, with the
theme, 'In search of solutions
to the problems facing Grena-
dan women'; 76 women attended
representing every parish.
Shortly after, some of the
conference proposals became
law. Sexual exploitation by
employers was outlawed; equal
pay and maternity leave were
introduced. In May 1981, a
restaurant owner was charged
with dismissing a pregnant
woman and was fined 500 EC
Dollars or about $700. This
was considered lenient as it
was a first offence. The wo-
man was reinstated and paid
for the time she had missed.

The National Women's Organ-
isation now has a membership
of close to 5,000 and groups

foster active women's groups

in the villages and all other
settlements and to encourage

women to participate fully in
policy making.’

One of these local women's
groups met twice a week just
down the road from where we
were staying and two of us
went to their meetings. We
were welcomed into the once
weekly closed group which was
devoted to evaluation of pro-
gress, group self-criticism,
and discussion of more inti-
mate issues like relationships
and confidence building. The
other weekly meeting was an
open educational forum which
focused on women's issues or
on international affairs -
ranging from the situation in
Iran to the rest of the Cari-
bbean and Central America.

One of the meetings we
attended, 'The Politics of
Food', was a lively debate
about how to change the Gren-
adian ingrained attitude that
expensive imported canned
corned beef is better nutri-
tion than local fresh tuna;
an explosion of the myth fos-
tered by the multinationals
that the ‘overpopulated’
Third World cannot feed it-
self; and a discussion of the
relative merits of mountain
cabbage and callaloo, a kind

of spinach.

This local women's group
was responsible for coordin-
ating schemes like clearing
and concreting a patch of
waste ground, where a disused
bus was parked to house a
preschool playgroup. It organ-
ized blocoramas or 'blocos'
(mass celebrations with dan-
cing and eating), and 5am
yoga sessions. Many people
function at a level of energy
that sounds killing to us -
up at dawn to exercise or
write, work from 7am until
4pm, eat at 5pm, early eve-
ning meetings and then often
dancing or home-produced
theatre. But in fact, because
it's all about changing and
controlling their own lives,
the excitement and enthusiasm
are catching.

"THOSE WHO KNOW TEACH, THOSE
WHO DON'T LEARN - OR 'A 11
YEAR OLD CAN TEACH A 70 YEAR
OLD."

The Centre for Popular Ed-
ucation operates on a volun-
teer basis, and since the re-
volution has managed to re-

duce complete illiteracy from

14% to nil, and effective ill-
iteracy from 40% to nil. The
principle of involving people
at a grassroots level is
applied equally in the field
of health where the emphasis
is on prevention and educa-
tion. Health facilities were
in a state of devastation be-
fore the revolution. Now,
with the help of Cuban doc-
tors, there are three general
hospitals and each of the
five parishes has a health
centre or a polyclinic staff-
ed by a nurse and a team of
aides. Each health centre has
an outreach network of visit-
ing stations, staffed by a
district midwife and a local
aide. In this way every house-
hold is within walking dis-
tance of expert medical help,
and, by a system of referrals,
can reach the appropriate
level of help.

Strides are being made in
getting the health service to
work from the bottom up; the
key concepts are community
health care and education.
Much information about basic
health needs is disseminated
through the National Women's
Organisation and local groups.
This is also the task of the
community health department
of the Ministry of Health,
