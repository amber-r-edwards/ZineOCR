Booklet on the History of  

Santa Fe Gallery  
Now Underway  

Pat Sexton  

On Saturday, October 5th,  
Santa Fe’s first “all-women” art  
gallery and feminist bookstore  
was officially opened. A  
Woman’s Gallery is owned and  
operated by Deborah Ritchey  
and Kate Arnold, formerly of  
Albuquerque.  

The well-attended opening  
was a mellow introduction to  
this exciting new addition to the  
Southwestern feminist com-  
munity. Many women brought  
musical instruments and jam-  
med together; music and con-  
versation flowed, old friends got  
together after long and short  
separations. All afternoon and  
into the evening, women shared  
energy and feelings about the  
artwork entered by many of New  
Mexico’s women artists.  

The current show is com-  
prised of oil paintings, graphics,  
watercolors, photography and  
ceramics. They have been done  
by over a half dozen women,  
mainly from around the Santa  
Fe/Albuquerque region. Also  
shown are handmade jewelry  
and cards.  

Rebbie, coordinator of the  
gallery, spoke of her intentions,  
saying that the gallery exists to  
expose the public to women ar-  
tists, and to provide an outlet  
from the usual gallery scene of  
being “judged.” “It will be a  
place for women to express  
themselves and to show their  
work . . . a well-rounded place,  
for all fields of the arts,” said  
Debbie.  

Knowing how difficult it is to  
get work shown in most galleries  
(especially if you’re a woman),  
Debbie intends the gallery to be  
a place where all women artists  
will have an equal chance to  
show. It is a big step towards  
breaking down elitist, male-  
dominated concepts of ‘what is  
art’. She feels that, working  
with women artists, more is  
shared; distances between artist  
and viewer are lessened.  

The works in the gallery will be  
changed at roughly two month  
intervals to allow for a wide  
spectrum of work to be shown.  
The price range on works is  
broad: from $1.00 to $1,200.  
Debbie is also working on the  
idea of doing “exchange shows”  
with other women’s galleries  
around the country.  

The bookstore, which is  
managed by Kate, is perhaps  
the most complete and well-  
stocked feminist bookstore in  
New Mexico. It contains  
magazines, poetry, political  
books, non-fiction and fiction,  
including many hard-to-find  
titles. The political section is  
complete, but Kate hopes to get  
her hands on much more  
women’s fiction in the near  
future. What a joy to not have to  
send away to the publisher for a  
good feminist book!  

A Women’s Gallery and  
Feminist Bookstore is so com-  
pletely different from other art  
galleries that it is impossible to  
draw a comparison.  

The atmosphere is warm and  
easy, partly because it doubles  
as Kate and Debbie's home,  
partly because of the presence of  
the bookstore, but mainly  
because it is a gathering place  
for women in the community.  
Many “Nights of Music” are  
planned as future events in addi-  
tion to occasional special

seminars.  

On top of all this, the gallery is  
offering classes in figure draw-  
ing, dance, yoga and massage,  
mime, and theatre. There is ac-  
tivity almost every night of the  
week. It promises to become a  
new center for women’s ac-  
tivities, a focal point for women’s  
expression.  

A Women’s Gallery and  
Feminist Bookstore is located at  
1008 Canyon Rd. in Santa Fe  
(988-4211). If you’re in town, it's  
something you definitely should  
not miss, sisters.  

Pill Decreases  
Mental  
Sharpness  

Pam Scooros  

As more research is being  
done, more effects of the pill are  
being discovered. A recent  
Science News article revealed  
that the pill tends to lessen men-  
tal sharpness. The scientists,  
Stephen Wong of Queens Un-  
iversity, Kingston, Ontario, and  
John E. Tong of the University of  
Guelph, decided to study this  
theorized effect as a result of  
research suggesting the fluctua-  
tion of women’s mental  
sharpness as their estrogen  
levels changed. This would  
mean that a woman's mental  
sharpness is at its peak when  
she is ovulating and at its lowest  
prior to menstruation. They  
studied two groups of women —  
one not on the pill and the other  
on it. Besides not having these  
cyclical changes in mental ac-  
uity, the pill users “showed  
overall less mental sharpness  
than did women not using them,  
suggesting that the synthetic  
hormones were causing a  
depressant effect.”

Working Women’s:  
Organizations Available  

BERKELEY, CA (LNS) — A new  
booklet entitled “Working  
Women and Their  
Organizations, 150 Years of  
Struggle,” is now available from  
Union Women’s Alliance to Gain  
Equality (Union WAGE) — a  
group of union and non-union  
women fighting sexism “on the  
job and in society.”  

The 33-page booklet — written  
by Joyce Maupin, Coordinator of  
Union WAGE — briefly traces  
150 years of women’s labor  
organizations, usually omitted  
from traditional labor history. It  
not only describes actions of the  
labor movement as a whole, but  
also the specific struggles of  
women within the movement.  

Beginning with a brief men-  
tion of women’s labor in colonial  
America, the booklet points out  
that although “women were  
barred from institutions of  
higher learning on the grounds  
that their nervous system was  
too delicate for the burden of all  
that education, five-year-old girls  
were considered strong enough  
to work in the mills.”  

The booklet then describes the  
women’s 19th-century struggles  
for the ten-hour day and better  
working conditions; their in-  
volvement in the abolition move-  
ment and how it often led to the  
fighting for women’s rights; the  
exclusion of women from male  
unions; and the formation of  
separate women’s unions.  

Also mentioned is the  
American Federation of Labor's  
policy during this period of  
organizing mainly skilled white  
men.  

With the early 20th century  
came the formation of the  
Women’s Trade Union League —  
a group of trade unionists,  
socialists, liberal social workers  
and women of wealth who  
helped organize women’s un-  
ions;  

“I am a working girl,” said  
Clara Lemlich, a young teenager  
working at Triangle Shirtwaist  
factory in 1909, “one of those on  
strike against intolerable con-  
ditions. I am tired of listening to  
speakers who talk in general  
terms. What we are here for is to  
decide whether we shall or shall  
not strike. I offer a resolution  
that a general strike be declared  
now.”  

The next day, 30,000 un-  
organized working people, most-  
ly women, responded. They  
were assaulted by scabs, beaten  
by police and arrested, but 13  
weeks later, there were union  
contracts in 312 shops.  

The 1920s evidenced  
widespread repression of union  
activity due to the “Red Scare.”  

Although the 1930s brought a  
resurgence of union activity, the  
movement away from AFL craft  
unions to found the CIO also  
brought with it a shift to almost  
exclusively male leadership. Un-  
ion leader Agnes Nestor noted in  
her autobiography that “women  
got lost in the mass unions and  
did not build their own  
leadership as they had in the  
days when they were in separate  
unions.”  

During World War II, the  
booklet points out there were  
“jobs (for women) — but still no  
equality.” Both black and white  
women were considered  
“patriots” for entering the labor  
force to help the war machine,  
but then when the war ended,  
women laborers were labeled  
“unladylike,” and the propagan-  
da of the “happy homemaker”  
prevailed.  

The booklet includes a  
description of the new feminism  
of the 1960s. Dolores Huerta,  
Vice President of the United  
Farm Workers, Viola Mitchell, a  
black household worker and  
President of the California  
Homemaker’s Association — both  
considered to be in the  
category of “unorganizable”  
minority women — are noted,  
among others.  

The booklet wraps up with a  
call for unity among working  
women. “Women, in alliance  
with other minority workers can  
revitalize the union so they can  
assume leadership in the  
struggle to change conditions in  
our society.”  

The booklet “Working Women  
and Their Organizations; 150  
Years of Struggle” can be ob-  
tained for $1.00 each plus 24¢  
postage, or 80¢ each plus  
postage for orders of 10 or more,  
from Union WAGE Educational  
Committee, P.O. Box 462,  
Berkeley, California 94701.
