| don’t want to call you  
Don’t want to talk to you  
Don’t want to  

Let you know I’m home.  

| feel my strength  

Slipping away  

As you reduce  

My odyssey  

To ‘Do you want to break up?”  

There is no  

Life of the mind with you,  
| want to explore  

To question  

The formation of couples,  
Ask ‘Why two?”  

You only see  
the threat.  

So | must give up my quest  
And reassure you.  

And go back to what | was  
And abandon what | could be.

“a matter of identity”  

What's in a name?  

Shakespeare told us that:  
“A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.”  
Would it? | wonder...  

“What's in a name?”  
Probably more than  
we want to admit...  

WHO ARE YOU, WOMANPERSON?  

Do you take your name from your husband?  
Do you take your name from your father?  
Or did you give your name to yourself?  

Does it matter? Isn't a name just a label?  
Or is it your identity, womanperson?  

Do you call yourself Julie?  
Do you call yourself butterfly?  
Do you call yourself housewife?  
teacher?  
mother?  
poet?  
minister?  

What do you call yourself, womanperson?  
WHAT'S IN YOUR NAME?

for leslie  

fumbling through  
flexing kitten fur  

my hands are looking for  
your face  

but they must be pacified  
for now  

it’s okay, we have looked through  
the same glass  

into sweet insensibility  

knowing dark desire crashing in  
the center of myself  
the terrible waves  
of a storm that knows no calm  
but the liquid love  

no human passion can ever  
rock inside me  
with such mayhem  
and no amount of will ever  
kept the tides from ebb and flow  
woman, we did not choose to be  
condemned  

and when you choose to stay the sentence  
asking only grace that  
you can understand  

i will stand in solidarity  

proud to be your friend

The Tale of Time in the Minds  
of the Umpire, Zookeeper, and  
Onlookers All  

“Time out!”, cries the Umpire.  

She steps through  

The hole which  

Suddenly appears in the wall.  
The balls continue flying/slicing  
The air, and space takes a breather  
While the runners still run.  

“Time in!”, cries the Zookeeper.  

She opens cages  

And doors. The  

Animals run through the hole in the wall.  
The same hole  
And same wall.  

“Wait!”, cries the Lady.  

Whose veil is torn;  

Across her face is  

A smile. Lightly she presses  

Her mind to the sky.  
Time becomes a clockpiece and an  

Internal notion inside the spaces  
Occupied by the Umpire, Zookeeper,  
And Onlookers all.

My Birthday  

After an Exhibitionist  

in Next Door Window —  
For Real!  

3-F  

Prove to me in your camper truck  
What a man you are  

Exposed in the window, you waited  
In perfect erection, my passing by.  

How many symbols of fuck do you need?  
Your truck and the world in your balls.  

This poem need not be published  
And it won't by the Great Phallacy  
Of Historical thought, be considered  
Prime  

Reading material for future fuckers.  

By your own doing  
It is the whore that is window waiting.  
Do you propose to draw the same  

With your lame game?  
The internal switch man reddened  
For the rape?  

Now a backward glance  
You'll see from here, Sweetie.  
Keep on trucking, papa.  

it'll pass.

Old Habit  

‘Changing old habit  
is harder than raising the dead’  

our crazy sage cackled  
then spun down an alley.  

| hate him for finding such humor  
in our seriousness,  

locked into our space,  
spring narcissus melt in our vision,  
like honey into summer, crystal ginger  
for fall and winter’s slow dreams,  
building secretly like our lovemaking,  
our intent always the clown, barleycorn  
the prize.  

| was raised on serious  
biscuits and cataclysmic  
gravy. — | could have been champion of  
the world. Now the world is full  
of champions... J  
: this new game,  

nothing I've trained for; my mind  
celebrates, my heart cries like a  
nun; but my body  
is tense & hating,  
playing dodgeball to win.
