Tribal Loyalties To Vision Of Unity

ternal road which leads
back to the tribe, and that
need that one feels under
other skies, to break down

the barriers and take a look
around, like liberated goats,

to go randomly towards a
humanity that moves to the

rhythm of the turning stars."

The question that Adnan

leaves for all of us is: to

what extent does our identi-

fication with any group--

and the corresponding defin-

ition of non-

members as

"other"--lead to a mentality

that allows genocide? In an

interview with Judith Pierce

in The Middle East (Sept.,
1983), Adnan argues that
while group identity offers
a feeling of solidarity in
peacetime, the resulting ex-
clusion of others can lead
to total annihilation of
the "enemy" in wartime.
"This is the most dangerous
aspect in the Middle East,"
Adnan maintains. She also

declares that the kidnappings

conducted by both sides in
the Lebanese civil war were
"unforgivable...(E)ven if
your cause is just, there
are certain things that hu-
man nature should not do.
You stop somewhere.”

The captors of Marie Rose
do not stop short of her
brutal execution. The pic-
ture Adnan creates of them
is not one-dimensional.
While religion and class
play a part in their ac-
tions, so does male domin-
ation of women and the
corruption of power in all
forms. Adnan also slams
patriarchy in the form of
male images of women as
either madonnas or whores.

Greetings Marianne,

done nothing.

When I was put into the
hole, after I returned from
my first day of trial, I was
hit twice by a guard, male,
all I was doing was asking
why I was being locked up.

I've been told that if I
take a warrant which I wanted
to do, that I'll die in

on the story of a woman

Marie Rose was a principal
of a school for retarded
children. But in the novel,
she teaches deaf-mutes,
because, Adnan explains,
"I consider that the deaf
mutes represent the Arab
people."

A Lebanese poet, painter
and tapestry designer,
Etel Adnan, 58, is the
daughter of a Greek
Christian mother and Syr-
ian Muslim father. Educa-
ted in French and American
schools, she taught phil-
osophy for 14 years in
California, where she
now lives. She has pub-
lished 5 books of poetry.

It was during her stu-
dent days at Berkeley and
Harvard that she reclaimed
her Arab identity, and in
the early '60s she
helped found an education-
al organization called
Najda: Women Concerned
About the Middle East.

Adnan describes the act
of writing as a positive
gesture...I think when
you write the saddest
things, while you're
writing them, they seem
more hopeful."

At times you'll feel
hopeful while reading
Sitt Marie Rose; at other
times you'll cry and de-
spair. But at all times
her writing will touch
your heart and mind.
