Feminism and food... The  
other night, I got into a  
discussion with a co-worker  
about the politics of eating.  
And after explaining that I

was not talking about Repub-  
lican fund-raising dinners,  
I realized how important the  
issue is. It boils up to  
truly living - and eating -  
your politics.

After the discussion, a lot  
of things began to click into  
place. Someone once told me  
that becoming a vegetarian  
was like taking a step to-  
wards communism (and from  
the response I've gotten to  
my vegetarianism from some  
people, I might as well have  
said I am a communist). On  
one level, making the choice  
1) not to eat meat, and 2) to  
take care of your body does  
often represent a broader  
political consciousness - at  
least, an openness to alter-  
natives. It also signifies  
increased respect for the  
cycle of life (animal and  
human), and a clear disres-  
pect for hamburgers, hot dogs  
and all-American junk foods.  
And while it is possible to  
be a vegetarian and still  
consume a package of Twinkies  
a day, the choice not to  
eat meat is a sound beginning  
in the long process of un-  
learning unsound habits.

The next thing that comes  
to mind was one of my earli-  
est feminist theories - the  
“cookie recipe" principle.  
From childhood, I remember  
my grandmother guarding her  
best recipes. Having come  
to the U.S. at the age of 16,  
she held to Greek traditions  
all her life. These tradi-  
tions - especially her cook-  
ie recipes - were in many  
ways her identity. She never  
gave them away either - at  
least in their original form.  
Instead, she made damn sure  
that the recipes she "shared"  
with friends lost something  
vital in the translation. She  
sabotaged every recipe inten-  
tionally so that she could  

keep her identity intact.

And years later, I understood  
that my grandmother, like so  
many women, had little but  
her family and her kitchen  

to build her life around.  
Rarely was she recognized as  
an extraordinary woman - ex-  
cept when she baked her fa-  
mous cookies.

As my awareness of this  
phenomenon grew, I saw it as  
a very basic component of  
competition between women.

I looked at how all the wo-  
men in my family had intern-  
alized negative feelings  
about themselves and other  
women. Over and over again,  
these feelings connected  
somehow with food and feed-  
ing others. And so, as I

they say, "Feminism is not a  
part-time attitude for us; it  
is how we live all day, every-  
day." It is also feminist  
culture. Interspersed through-  
out The Political Palate is  
a thorough sampling of women's  
words: everything from a  
Woody Simmons' song verse, to  
a science fiction quote from  
Joanna Russ. The collective  
calls these their "best loved  
treasures - the resources in  
our bookstore to think about,  
talk about and try to live by  
... For the songs, poems, stor-  
ies and ideas are necessary to  
our lives." Without these,  
they tell us, long hours of  
cooking and cleaning are drud-  
gery.

These inclusions make the

struggled into a feminist  
consciousness, it seemed  
only natural that I should  
identify my own attitudes  
about food.

I suspect that all of us  
have carried early ideas  
about eating into adulthood.  
We know how food has been  
used against us, and how we  
have used it against our-  
selves. And that is why it  
is important that we learn  
how to integrate food into  
our lives as political fem-  
inists, and that we share  
that knowledge with each  
other.

With this commitment at  
heart, five women from Bridge-  
port, Connecticut have pro-  
duced a feminist vegetarian  
cookbook. The Political Pal-  
ate is a wonderful collec-  
tion of recipes, the by-prod-  
uct of the Bloodroot Collec-  
tive's restaurant and book-  
store in Bridgeport. They  
state in the introduction,  
"We are writing this 'cook-  
book’ for all the people who  
asked for it. When we began,  
we had little enthusiasm  
for the effort until we  
realized that to 'feed'  
we had to tell you what  
feeds us."

And what feeds these women  
is not only feminist food (as

cookbook unique, and so do  

the recipes. The Bloodroot  
women share their interest and  
respect for ethnic cooking and  
state, "There is much to learn  
from other cultures and no  
need to get confused with  
other woman-hating systems  
such as which foods are yin  
and yang." Instead, they have  
ordered their recipes in a  
much more sensible way - by  
what foods are available sea-  
sonally. The chapters are  
therefore broken down by Late  
Autumn, Early Winter, and so  
on throughout the year. They  
explain: "We use what is close  
at hand, and what is most  

fresh and local and therefore  
least expensive and least  

'preserved'. This seems ob-  
vious, but we know of no  

Thought  

other serious attempt at a  
seasonal cookbook."

The book itself is nicely  
produced - from the type  
style to high quality print-  
ing and paper. It is clear  
that the collective has  
tried to make The Political  
Palate readable, enjoyable  
and usable. They tell us  
in the introduction that  
many of the recipes have been  
adapted to what is most  
available in our culture;  
that as cooks themselves,  
they assume the use of high  
quality ingredients; and fin-  
ally, joy of all joys, that  
their recipes are not geared  
to calorie counting.

The one major problem with  
the recipes is not one of  
quality, but of quantity.  
Geared to restaurant clien-  
tele, the collective's col-  
lectibles are huge - appro-  
priate for a large household  
or a community pot-luck, but  
in most cases, unwieldy for  
just a few people (unless  
you plan to eat the same  
thing for several days run-  
ning).

Another drawback is that  
most of the recipes are for  
ovo-lacto vegetarians (those  
who eat dairy products).  
While the collective has made  
a commendable effort to  
include ideas for sugar-free  
desserts, they admit that  
much remains to be done in  
the area of soy protein for  
people who do not eat dairy.  
I look forward to seeing  
more recipes for vegans as  
soon as the collective can  
gather enough for a second  
volume.

and

All in all, The Political  
Palate is a must for veget-  
arian feminists. The Blood-  
root women are effectively  
re-defining culture - we  
are indeed what we eat,  
what we read, and what we  
think and believe. And the  
best part of it is the know-  
ledge that this collective  
practices what it preaches:  
"We cook as a way to survive  
economically, yet our cook-  
ing is part of our study, our  
living, and our politics.

It seems to us that there is  
no separation between art and  
politics, there is integrity  
which requires judgments  
and a value system underlying  
our work and our lives.  
Everything we do is the  
result."
