AN OPEN LETTER:  
A Critical Response to the Take Back  
the Night "Speak Out" Rally and  
Andrea Dworkin's speech, Nov. 1, at  
Luther Bonney Bldg., USM, Portland  
FROM: The Women of the Maine Anti-  
Draft Network, Nov. 5, 1980  

On Saturday, November 1, 1980, the  
University Women's Forum sponsored a  
program at the USM campus in Port-  
land which was publicized as "Women  
Unite - Take Back the Night." The  
program consisted of workshops in  
the afternoon, a rally and march in  
the evening followed by a "Speak  
Out" at 9:00 pm at the Luther Bonney  
Auditorium. The objectives of the  
program were, according to the lit-  
erature, "not only to educate the  
community about the severity and  
realities of violence against wom-  
en, but also to organize community  
support in affecting change."  

Several women members of the Maine  
Anti-Draft Network attended a number  
of the workshops in the afternoon  
and the “Speak Out" in the evening.  
We attended because we wanted to  
show our solidarity with other wom-  
en who are concerned about the op-  
pression and exploitation of women  
in this society, and who are com-  
mitted to the abolition of all forms  
of such oppression. Our perception  
was that the workshops were narrowly  
focused, with a singular emphasis on  
the threat of rape and physical vi-  
olence by men against women. As  
women, we certainly share this con-  
cern, but as women committed to  
abolishing all forms of oppression  
that women experience, we felt that  
the program was seriously lacking in  
any attempt to make a scientific an-  
alysis of the origins of women's  
oppression. Nor was any attempt  
made to link the oppression that  
white women experience with the  
struggles of our Native American  
sisters, or with black, Latin, and  
Asian sisters and their fight for  
liberation. It is evident to most  
all women, and especially working  
class women, that there are other  
forms of violence (besides physical  
rape and the threat of rape) that  
brutalize and dehumanize great num-  
bers of women on a day-to-day basis.  
Some examples: unemployment, unsafe  
working conditions, low wages, in-  
adequate health care and housing,  
lack of daycare facilities, mental  
and physical imprisonment, and lack  
of control over our own bodies.  

However, the biggest problem we  
encountered with the program occur-  
red in the evening at the so-called  
Speak Out. It was our understanding  
that the Speak Out was going to pre-  
sent an opportunity for women to ex-  
press their solidarity and to share  
their experiences and views. One  
of our members had earlier made a  
request to speak and was told that  
she could participate by one of  
the coordinators.  

The featured speaker of the even-  
ing was Andrea Dworkin, who had been  
billed as a feminist author and act-  
ivist. Her presentation, instead of  
educating and uniting women, con-  
sisted of an emotional tirade that  
can only be characterized as vicious,  
reactionary, and divisive. It was  
totally lacking in any kind of an-  
alysis or strategy which would en-  
able women to liberate ourselves from  
any form of oppression. In her  
targeting all men as the source of  
sex-related oppression of women, she  
rules out any basis for unity ex-  
cept possibly that of lesbian sep-  
aratists; this “analysis” also rules  
out any hope for resolution of this  

contradiction. It was interesting  
that no questions were invited from  
the audience, which numbered up-  
wards of 200 and filled the Bonney  
Auditorium and consisted mostly of  
women.  

Immediately following Dworkin's  
speech, Betsy Whitman (the coordin-  
ator for the event) announced that  
she was the last speaker and then a  
"sister's solidarity" song was to  
finalize the event. Her apparently  
deliberate attempt to omit the pre-  
viously arranged participation of  
one of our members (Carol Thomas)  
made it necessary for Carol to bring  
it to her attention and to insist  
upon being recognized. No one knows  
how many other women would have  
liked to address the group or ask  
questions, had they been invited.  
Carol was finally allowed to speak.  

Andrea Dworkin, the director of the  
Maine Commission for Women, remained  
seated on the stage as Carol pro-  
ceeded to introduce herself. Carol,  
who is a divorced mother of three and  
a rape victim herself, gave a brief ac-  
count of her personal and political  
history as a woman and an activist.  
Her presentation consisted of ex-  
pressing solidarity with all oppres-  
sed women in their struggles to end  
that oppression. Solidarity was  
expressed not only for women's  
struggles against rape and physical  
violence, but also for women's stru-  
ggle against economic violence and  
the struggles of Third World women  
against their oppression both as  
women and as victims of imperial-  
ism.  

At one point, in presenting a  
historical analysis of the origins  
of women's oppression, Carol made  
the statement that "Men are not the  
primary enemy" of women. As Carol  
continued sharing her analysis of  
women's oppression, some of the wom-  
en in the audience began getting up  
from their seats and walking out.  
Soon after, Dworkin and Potter  
walked off the stage and were joined  
by an increasing number of others.  
With these women gathered noisily  
in the lobby at the back of the  
auditorium, it was not easy to hear  
Carol, who continued speaking to the  
remaining 60-70% of the original  
audience.  

Soon Betsy Whitman and another  
woman came in from the lobby and  
interrupted Carol, asking that her  
speech be stopped so that those  
who were leaving could sing their  
"solidarity" song together. Women  
in the audience insisted that Carol  
be allowed to finish, and Whitman  
finally backed down and reluctantly  
allowed Carol to resume her pres-  
entation when a woman stood up and  
shouted, "Let's show this sister a  
little solidarity!"  

“AN ATTACK ON ONE WILL BE  
ANSWERED BY ALL”  

Carol received a standing ovation  
from many of those who stayed to  
listen, and many individuals ap-  
proached her to embrace, congrat-  
ulate, and thank her for her dis-  
play of courage as well as for the  
content of her talk.  

It became clear that the majority  
of the audience was receptive to  
Carol's show of solidarity with all  
women and with her political an-  
alysis. It also became very clear  
that there is a distinct need for  
some progressive leadership in the  
women's movement in Maine. Such  
leadership is obviously not going to  
come from the likes of Andrea Dwor-  
kin or those who directed and pro-  
moted the “Women Unite - Take Back the  
Night" program. The kind of polit-  
ics and leadership practiced by  
these women is revealed by the dif-  
ference in how they received Carol's  
presentation as compared with the  
warm reception of Governor Brennan's  
proclamation of November 1st as  
“official” Take Back the Night Day  
in Maine. This proclamation was  
also issued by Portland's mayor re-  
garding the city of Portland's  
support for "Take Back the Night.”  
It seems these women have more sol-  
idarity with the governor and the  
mayor than they expressed for Carol  
Thomas. Their unity with the gov-  
ernor and the mayor reveals the op-  
portunism inherent in the politics  
of the “Take Back the Night" pro-  
gram. Perhaps these women would do  
well to heed these words of Carol's,  
which she did her best to share with  
them at the "Speak Out": "The wom-  
en's liberation movement must be an  
independent movement - one that is  
free of any alliances with the  
state in any form; it must adopt a  
strategy for complete liberation  
that is derived from a scientific  
analysis of the historical roots of  
our oppression; and it must be in  
solidarity with all the progressive  
forces in the world.”  

In summary, it is our position  
that the "Take Back the Night"®pro-  
gram which we observed in Portland  
can have but two objective conse-  
quences: 1) to increase the numbers  
of lesbian separatists; 2) to block,  
to divert, and to dissipate any  
progressive potential as it begins  
to emerge and express itself in the  
women's movement.

Tide Publications announced Nov-  
ember 10 that they will stop publish-  
ing their national feminist news-  
magazine, The Lesbian Tide.  

The Lesbian Tide began publishing  
in 1971 and has been the largest  
lesbian paper in the U.S. The Los  
Angeles-based paper suspended pub-  
lication with their May/June 1980  
issue.  

Publisher Jeanne Cordova said  
the news magazine's staff has decided  
they want to pursue other interests.  
"This last August marked our 9th  
Anniversary, and several core staff  
feel it is time to move on.” Assoc-  
iate Publisher and Features Editor,  
Sharon McDonald is now working on a  
collection of short stories. Pro-  
duction and Circulation Manager,  
Barbara Gehrke is now working full  
time in the graphic arts industry.  
Publisher and News Editor, Jeanne  
Cordova is working in gay Democratic  
Party politics.  

Summarizing the staff's feelings,  
Cordova said, "It's been a very long  
and personally difficult decision  
for all of us. We remain deeply  
proud of the accomplishments of The  
Lesbian Tide, the role it played in  
the development of radical feminism  
and the national lesbian feminist  
community, and how it touched wom-  
en's lives."  

Jeanne Cordova also announced it  
is possible they will publish anoth-  
er paper in 1981. Cordova explained,  
"We are considering a newspaper  
which focuses on gay concerns with  
a feminist perspective, one which  
reflects the 1980's agenda of a  
community that is moving into an in-  
creasingly wider social and polit-  
ical role. The paper would be  
directed to lesbians, feminists, and  
gay men. But as of now, this is a  
consideration, not a plan."  

Tide Publications wishes to notify  
its retail outlets and advertisers  
that they have ceased publications.  
They also note there is a substan-  
tial paperwork backlog as work is  
now proceeding on a volunteer basis,  
but all subscribers will be not-  
ified of their decision to stop  
publishing.  

Tide Publications would like to  
thank the following women for their  
unique contribution to The Lesbian  
Tide over the past nine years:  

Shirley Buss, Sue Cooke, Annie Doczi,  
Rita Goldberger, Roberta Gregory,  
Starlyn Howard, Penny Grenoble,  
Karla Jay, Peggy Kimball, Claire  
Krulikowski, Cheri Lesh, Kerry Lobel,  
Kathryn Louyse, Barbara McLean,  
Bridget Overton, Caren Presley.  

Boston Re-vamps Clinic  

Dear Friends:  

After taking four weeks to re-eval-  
uate our services, Women's Community  
Health Center re-opened Sept. 9, 1980.  
Workers participated in a long, but  
energizing process to create a new  
structure that maintains our commit-  
ment to providing quality health  
care in a feminist woman-controlled  
setting in the Boston Area.  

Beginning November, WCHC will op-  
erate on a part-time basis. In order  
to implement this, we have developed  
a new structure that we want to share  
with you as a friend and supporter  
of Women's Community Health Center.  

Due to staff turnover and financ-  
ial considerations, we have made some  
changes in the services we provide.  
These are temporary measures until  
our new structure gains stability.  

We will continue to provide pregnancy  
screening, first trimester abortions,  
cervical caps, and educational serv-  
ices. We will no longer be providing  
routine gynecological care outside  
of the services already listed. In  
addition, the hours that we answer  
the phones will change slightly, as  
we will now be closed on Mondays.  
Telephones will be staffed Tuesday  
through Saturday.  

We will no longer use the suggest-  
ed fee system, which, while we whole-  
heartedly believe in the idea of a  
woman paying what she feels she can  
afford, has proved to be financially  
unsound. Cervical caps and abortions  
will be provided for set fees at a  
reasonable rate, with limited alter-  
native payment plans.  

Our internal structure has also  
been reorganized. We are now working  
with a smaller full-time staff. Vol-  
unteers and contract workers will be  
incorporated into the health center.
