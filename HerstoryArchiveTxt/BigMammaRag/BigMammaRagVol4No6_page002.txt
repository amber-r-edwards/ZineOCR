Women Rally To Protest Center's

Kate Sharp

On Sunday, May 16th ap-
proximately 150 persons gat-
hered on the steps of the
Denver City and County Buil-
ding to participate in a rally to
protest the recent closing of
the Women’s Resource Center
and to initiate the building of a
new Women’s Center.

The rally began with a few
songs performed by local
musician, Nancy Hutchinson.

Accomplishments of
Resource Center

Next, Resource Center board
member, Mary Neff made a
few opening remarks. She
stated that the reasons for the
rally were to show support for
a women’s center, to show
Denver City and County that
people do care that such a
center exists, and to develop a
broad base of community
support. Neff pointed out
some of the important accom-
plishments of the Resource
Center throughout its 2½ year
existence. Most notably, she
told the group that 1,700
women had been served in
1975 alone.

Women’s Needs a “Frill”

The next person to speak was
Congresswoman, Pat Schroe-
der. Schroeder began by
stating that the government
considers things dealing with
women a “frill.” This she
finds particularly appalling in
light of the fact that, “women
are the fastest growing po-
verty group in America.” 
Schroeder briefly touched on
the plight of the older woman
whom she said is discrimi-
nated against in the areas of
pensions, jobs, and social
security. Schroeder then told
the group that she “pitied the
poor younger woman” who is
now divorced and without a
college education. She said
this type of woman didn't feel
she needed an education,
“because she had been told
that if she just got married
that would be the end of it. So
then she got married and that
was the end of it.” Schroeder
stressed the point that very
few women are allowed to
fully develop. She also
mentioned that the Federal
Government espouses affirm-
ative action but doesn’t follow
through with it. She deplored
the government's lack of
proper daycare priorities and
said that working women
should leave their children at
the White House for the
politicians to take care of. In
summary, she deplored the
government’s overall failure
to see women's needs as a
priority.

Next at the podium was Judy
Gold, administrative assistant
to City Council representative,
Cathy Reynolds. Gold read a
letter of support from
Reynolds in lieu of the fact
that Reynolds had to be out of
town that day. In her letter,
Cathy Reynolds apologized for
her absence, said she wished
the group the best of luck, and
said she shared the group’s
goals and ideals.

Poems at Rally

At this point, local poet,
Chocolate Waters was asked
to read a few of her poems.
The most notable poem from
all the selections was one
describing the grueling
sexist experience of job hun-
ting. After she finished
reading, Chocolate announced
that she had copies of her first
published book of poems with
her and that the proceeds of
any she sold that day would go
to the group who sponsored
the rally, The Committee for a
Women’s Center.

The next speaker was Elsie
Pedilla from the Denver Hou-
sing Authority. Pedilla briefly
touched on the many oppo-
sitions in the way of working
women and particularly stressed
the needs of working
mothers and low-income
women. Pedilla concluded by
saying that she would back
any program that helped get
women back on their feet.

Psychological Needs of Women

Hannah Evans of the
Resource Center was the last
person to speak at the rally.
Evans spoke on the topic of
the psychological needs of
women and how a women’s
center might meet them. She
said that in order for women’s
psychological needs to be met
it is important that a women’s
center have a political philo-
sophy and that it give women
a supportive atmosphere in
which to grow. She pointed
out that this supportive
atmosphere usually doesn't
happen in the home because a
woman's needs become sec-
ondary to the needs of her
family. She said it doesn't
happen on the job either
because business situations
usually pit women against
women. Evans said that
women “need time and space
to define their life choices”

and to “find out what they
want for themselves without
being sidetracked.” Next,
Hannah Evans explained the
kind of functions she felt a
women's center should incor-
porate to be able to meet a
woman's need for the kind of
growth space mentioned ear-
lier. Evans suggested dual
functions were for fulfilling
survival needs (i.e. doing
counseling and referrals in
such areas as employment and
childcare) and providing
women the opportunity to
grow “within an educational
framework” (i.e. providing
women with workshops, lec-
tures, discussions, etc. dealing
with such topics as single
parenting, law for women,
sexuality, and health). Lastly,
Evans stressed the need for a
women's center to encourage
female bonding. She said, “If
we like other women, we'll
like ourselves.” She said any
good women's center should
help women develop into
independent, healthy, self-
actualizing, giving (including
self-giving) persons.

Thank-yous

Mary Neff made a few
closing remarks, including a
thank-you to the community
women who showed their
support and the staff of the
Resource Center for their hard
work. She also pointed out
that Moss Printers had do-
nated all the printing jobs that
were used to publicize the
rally. In conclusion, she urged
anyone who hadn't already
done so to sign the petition
requesting the City and
County to fund a women's
center. She also urged women
to sign the task force list of
persons willing to help plan a
women’s center and announced
the date of the first task
force meeting which would be
held in May.

Anyone interested in plan-
ning a women's center can
still get involved. Planning
meetings are expected to
continue for many months. If
interested, call Lou at
674-6223 or Susan at 355-9785.

Care Reduction

Those women who have lan-
guage and cultural differences.
The current system aims to
meet the needs of all women
in the city and county of
Denver by providing quality
care through eliminating the
humiliations and uncaring
atmosphere women usually
suffer by way of hospital
bureaucracy.

Appeal for Support

The nurses of Colorado Gen-
eral Hospital's maternity cli-
nic appeal to all women in the
city and county of Denver to
help them with their struggle.
They suggest contacting Dr.
Harry Ward, Dean of the
Medical Center and Sue
Bruckner, Director of Nursing
Services through letters and
phone calls. The number at
the hospital is 399-1211 and
the address is: Colorado
General Hospital, 4200 E. 9th
Ave., Denver, CO 80020.

If the hospital administration
should decide against the
continuation of the maternity
care system, women in Denver
plan to involve themselves in
protest actions against the
hospital. To keep informed
about these actions, call either
the BMR office or the Woman
to Woman Feminist Book-
center.

Civil Suits Charge Death

Five hundred thirty-three
civil suits are pending against
A.H. Robins Company as of
late April, charging death and
injuries caused by the com-
pany’s Dalkon Shield intra-
uterine device.

Another 117 suits have al-
ready been settled or disposed
of with settlements totaling
about $2 million, and another
225 claims have been filed but
not yet evolved into suits. An
additional 109 claims invol-
ving $394,499 have been set-
tled before suits evolved, the
Wall Street Journal reports.

Although complete statistics
do not exist, the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)
knows of at least 15 fatal and
247 non-fatal infected miscar-
riages attributed to the Dalkon
Shield since it was introduced
in 1970. A.H. Robins sus-
pended distribution of the
device in June 1974 at the
request of the FDA following a
wave of protests about its
hazards. The chief known
danger of the Shield is in-
fected pregnancy with the
device in place, causing septic
or infected miscarriage, severe
illness, and sometimes death.
The pending cases seek $480
million in punitive and com-
pensatory damages against
the company, whose 1974
profits totaled nearly $27
million. But A.H. Robins’
president and chief executive
officer, William L. Zimmer,
reassured those who attended
the company’s annual meeting
in April that “while the
ultimate cost to the company
cannot be accurately pre-
dicted, I can say to you that I
am firmly convinced that the
progress of the company will
not be materially affected by
this matter.”
