they received a sizeable grant  
to run an emergency housing  
program for women. They will  
have a house where women (or  
women with children) can go  
for up to two weeks during a  
transitional period in their  
lives. The cost will be $5.00 a  
night. This is an exciting new  
resource for women.

A Women’s Art Center has  
just opened in Boulder. It is a  
lovely two-room gallery and  
workshop space for women  
artists and students. The plan  
is that it will be a showcase for  
all the arts, not just visual. So  
far they have run workshops  
on poetry, creative body  
movement, and dance. They  
want to give women artists  
exposure and a chance to do  

their thing. They are now  
struggling to get grants to  
keep going.

Women Artists in the Front  
Range is a small diverse group  
of professional women artists  
who meet regularly in groups  
to discuss themselves as art-  
ists and to try to find  
alternatives to the male dom-  
inated university and gallery  
art scene. They started  
because they felt isolated  
outside of the university.  
Over the past three years they  
have put together several  
shows in galleries in the  
Boulder/Denver area. One  
problem they have is the  
transiency of members due to  
Boulder being a university  
town.

The Boulder Feminist The-  
atre Collective put on three  
one-act plays this spring (see  
April BMR). They are a group  
of three women and are  
looking for other women  
interested in theater to join  
them. They perform at  

benefits, the International  
Women's Day celebration, and  
also put on weekend-long  
performances by themselves.  
Womanchief Productions is a  
women's entertainment com-  
pany which organizes feminist  
concerts in the Boulder/Den-  
ver area. Over the past two  
years they have brought in  
Cris Williamson, Margie  
Adams, and Meg Christian,  
done a benefit for the Berkeley

There is an active Socialist  
Feminist Union of about 30  
members in Boulder. They do  
guerilla theatre, participate in  
debates, discuss books (Row-  
botham, Anti-Mass, Quest,  

etc.) and try to reach other  
women through skits in the  
community.

Boulder is a small college  
town, and its relationship to  
Denver is similar to what  
Berkeley's is to San Francisco.  
Denver is a cosmopolitan city  
and Boulder is a satellite,  
separated by 22 miles of  
grassy plains. Yet, Boulder  
does have a number of fine  
women’s resources of its own.  
Together, the two cities pro-  
vide a worthy feminist  
environment for women in the  
Rocky Mountain region.

HEMBRA is the Chicana  
Feminist organization of Den-  
ver. The group was founded  
by Becky Marrujo and Anita  
Espinosa-Larsen in late sum-  
mer of 1975. By October '75,  
they were joined by 3 other  
women in holding several  
initial meetings to discuss the  
group's purpose.

HEMBRA's stated purpose  
is “to improve the socio-  
economic status of Chicanas.”  
To further their goals, mem-  
bers held a reception for all  
Chicano legislators on Feb 5.  
The reception was to let the  

Big Mama Rag Vol. 4 No. 6

legislators know their group  
existed and to make them  
aware of Chicana causes. Jun  
5, HEMBRA sponsored a  
“Chicana Survival Exper-  
ience” workshop at the Aur-  
aria Campus. The workshop  
was extremely successful,  
with women from all areas of  
town giving their gut-level  
input.

HEMBRA meets every 3rd  
Tuesday at La Posada Res-  
taurant, 51 W. 4th Ave at  
5:30 pm. Officers are Anita  
Espinosa-Larsen and Delores  
Silva, co-chairing; Barbara  
Rodriguez, treasurer; and  
Esther Meza, secretary. For  
more information, call either  
of the chairwomen at the
