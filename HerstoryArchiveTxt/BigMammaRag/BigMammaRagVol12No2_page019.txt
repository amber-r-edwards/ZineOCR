(Women Of All Red Nations) is organizing on a  
massive scale. They are in need of funds to print informat-  
ion, to travel, and pay for legal litigations they are in-  
volved in. As women we must stand together in the struggle.  
All donations are greatly appreciated.  
Also available - T-shirts!!! These T-shirts are beautifully  
screened with the W.A.R.N. Woman on the front, and the say-  
ing "A nation is not conquered until the hearts of its wo-  
men are on the ground."  

Anti-Semitism  
from page 15  

just something that existed  
and ended with WWII. It is  
US government fascism, too.  

So here in 1984, while  
everyone is watching out for  
Big Brother...remember to  
watch out for the Jewish  
people, for Big Brother is  
also an anti-Semite!  

Where We're At  
from page 2  

In this issue we continue  
our writings on Zionism/  
Israel/Palestine/the Middle  
East with Deb's article on  
anti-Semitism. She talks  
about her own experiences  
as a Jewish woman, anti-  
Semitism in the left and  
white supremacist groups.  
In the next issue, we'll  
have articles on the his-  
tory of Zionism and how  
Israel was founded and his-  
tories of Palestine and the  
PLO. At some point we plan  
on getting together a read-  
ing list of all the liter-  
ature we have been reading  
on these issues (Thanks for  
the suggestion, Lois). We  
welcome responses.
