solace for all the bitter-
ness of life. And, at the
same time, she is the great
illusionist, the Seductress,
who draws him into life with
her Maya -- and not only into
life's reasonable and useful
aspects, but into its fright-
ful paradoxes and
ambivalences where good and
evil, success and ruin, hope
and despair, counterbalance
one another.

For the Madonna-Medusa image
seen so clearly by so many,
and described so vividly by
Lawrence, can't be real. No
one is that good/bad. Woman
is an archetype that
appears before him. Lawrence
is so hypnotized by his own
vision that he thinks he's
really seeing her, but he's
not. He's seeing Her. The
big Madonna in the sky. Who
holds up her skirts to reveal
Medusa. God/Satan in drag:
the Madonna not quite as
(powerfully) high, Medusa not
quite as (powerfully) low.
She did, after all, get her
head cut off. She was, after
all, mortal.

Give her the slap.

It's the slap that puts
everything in His place, God
in his Heaven, and the Madonna
washing his feet, and if he
looks deep into her eyes, he
will be turned to stone,
except that he is the devil
incarnated, so he will slap
the shit out of her first.

The cure-all.

Or is it. Is the big slap
really the answer to the big
mother?

Well, if so, then only
symbolically -- as the boy
supposedly symbolically
kills his father in order to

incorporate the father into
the self. Kills the father

in order to eat him. So

much written about the
Oedipus complex, the lust of
the boy-child for his mother,
the psychological killing of
the father in order to ingest
him -- but we get so confused,
don't we? Manning our guns,
shooting it out with each
other in actuality. The
commies will get you if you
don't watch out. And then,
after the killing of the
father comes the marriage
with the mother, the accept-
ance of the female in the
male self, the integration
of the Anima with the self.
The integration of Eros into
Logos. The marriage of Yin
and Yang.

Which first involves re-
cognition of Yin.

But yin has been so put
down in Western culture, poor
yin, so set aside, yin, so
degraded by this great rising
and swelling out of the tech-
nological yang yang yang, the
scientific yang yang yang.

It has nearly devoured us.
It tries to be All.

So what happens when man
confronts the very yin-ness
of his own self?

Fear. Panic. And, basically,
denial. So that the female
aspect of himself seems to
leap out of his being, a
great leap of paranoia.

Man lays it on women, in
general. Women around him, in
particular. Wife. Girlfriend.

Panic. Projection. And
there she IS. The embodiment
of everything Good. Of
everything Evil.

Anything but Okay. Anything
but human. Mortal.

But the slap, only sym-
POLlic.

Ironically enough, Lawrence
himself expressed somewhat
the solution to the problem
when he said (advising men

What is more anger-provoking
than the wasted time and mon-

as the frustration and emo-
tional anguish in seeking
help and handling these
cases alone is: Women, who I
sincerely felt would feel
empathy for women in prison
and in mental institutions,
didn't lend any legal support
--only condolences. It was
almost as though my existence,
my pain, and the trauma suf-

BMR UPDATE

The conviction of Julia
Wilder and Maggie Bozeman was
upheld in their January trial
in front of the State Court
of Appeals in Alabama. Out-
rage at the frame-up and sup-
port for the two activists
have been mounting since,

On Feb. 6th 300 marchers
walked the same ground (160
miles) as the historic Selma
to Montgomery Civil Rights
March to protest the jailing
of the two black activists
and to support the renewal of
the 1965 Voting Rights Act,
which expires Aug. 6th. The
march was sponsored by the
National Coalition to Free
Julia Wilder and Maggie Boze-
man and Save the Voting
Rights Act. Meanwhile, New
York City Councilman, Gilber-
to Gerena-Valentin has intro-
duced a resolution to the
City Council Feb. 9th urging
the council to support a call
for the U.S. Attorney General
to investigate this case,

throughout the United States.

I do not comprehend those
who seek to keep their sis-
ters in slavery and in chains.
And I don't understand how
women can turn away from
keeping their sisters and
their children alive. One
prison rights suit a year by
each woman attorney in Cal-
ifornia could vastly allevi-
ate America's suffering im-
prisoned.

Until that time, please
write to Gov. Jerry Brown
in Sacramento requesting that
the state contract out with a
medical-services corporation
for full-time doctors--and
that all drug experiments on
women at C.I.W. be stopped.
