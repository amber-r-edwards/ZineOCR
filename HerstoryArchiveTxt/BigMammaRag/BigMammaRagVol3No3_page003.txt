Letters Home to Mama

Dear Big Mama Rag:

In your August issue you
reported the story on Big
Mama Rag’s application for
funding with the Denver
Sustaining Fund. You stated:
“We deeply appreciate the
support and help we received
from the many community
women who attended the July
10 meeting of the DSF and
from Kathy DePaulo and Jim
McNulty of the board of
directors of the DSF.” Jim
McNulty was the only one of
the “boys” who supported Big
Mama’s proposal. I would
appreciate it if you would
point out in your next issue
that Jim McNulty is a member
of the Board of Directors of
the DSF as a representative of
the Gay Coalition of Denver.
And on the issue of BMR, he
was specifically urged to vote
for the proposal and to
support it vigorously.

At the previous board
meeting of the Gay Coalition

(a predominantly gay men’s
organization) we unanimously
voted that Jim take the above
course of action at the DSF
meeting. This is based upon
our support of a strong
Women’s Movement in Denver
which we perceive as our
allies in the struggle against
male heterosexual sexism that
oppresses both gays and
women. We understand your
appreciation for Jim individu-
ally, but there is also a gay
organization behind him who
sent him to the meeting with
specific instructions. It is no
coincidence that the only
male support was gay male
support.
Jerry Gerash,
President of the Gay
Coalition of Denver

Dear Sisters;

I just received the August
issue of BMR and would like
to comment on your “policy
statement” regarding Lesbian
baiting.

I think the statement is one
of the most beautiful, sisterly
and strong statements of its
kind that I have ever read
coming out of the women’s
liberation movement — and I
have been around for many
years.

If all women in the
movement felt as you did,
we’d be centuries ahead of
where we are — and we'd be
well on our way. The
statement made my day — no
— it made my week! Right on,
sisters,

in sisterhood,

Julie Lee

Big Mama Rag Vol. 3 No. 3

Dear Big Mama,

In your July issue, there
was an article about Chicana
welfare rights. I appreciated
your coverage of the concerns
of minority women. It’s
important that we understand
what’s going on with other
women. I think this article, as
well as others in the same
issue, brought some things
home to me that I hadn't
known before.

However, one of the quotes
from Patricia Estrada needs to
be clarified. She said: “Wo-
men who are on welfare are
forced to go to clinics where
the personnel try to convince
them to use birth control
methods to limit the size of
their families. This is simply

preparing the Chicana for
forced sterilization.”

First, I question whether
Ms. Estrada is referring to the
situation in Colorado, or
somewhere else in the coun-
try. If she is describing
incidents in Colorado, she
should back her statements
up with specific examples.
Where are welfare staff per-
sons forcing women to go to
clinics for birth control? At
what clinic are personnel
trying to persuade women to
limit the size of their families?

Because I work in family
planning, I’m concerned about
these accusations. My experi-
ence has been that family
planning personnel go out of
their way not to tell patients
how many children they
should have. I think the
emphasis goes toward helping
a woman decide when she
wants children, rather than
the number she should have.

If women are being bull-
dozed into unhappy choices,
then let’s find out who is
applying the pressure. Unless
women take the responsibility
to specifically point out and
change these practices, other
sisters will continue to have
their heads and their lives
messed with.

Sincerely,
Sherilyn Brandenstein

OoPS....

In our Aug. issue on rape we
reprinted an article by Susan
Griffin entitled “Rape-The All
American Crime.” Somehow
we misspelled her name and
we want to sincerely apolo-
gize to Ms. Griffin for this
egregious error.

Dear Big Mama Rag:

I may never find as many
women who people my heart
quite the same as you “Big
Mama’s” do. From start until
now, BMR has been in part my
recreation, in part my crea-
tion, and it has created a part
of me. Many women have
thanked me for the work I've
done on the paper. But I don’t
remember now if I ever took
the time to say thank you
back. So now, with those
crazy tears from the concert
returning to my eyes, thank
you! Thanks for being and by
being, giving me a chance to
be a part of you.

Love,
Elissa Meyer
