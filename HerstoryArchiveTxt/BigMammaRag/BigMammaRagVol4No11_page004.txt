Grand Jury Subpoenas Eleven

‘Witch Hunt’ Plagues Seattle Left

Janine Carpenter

Seattle's left community has come  
under increasing pressure and har-  
assment from the government in the  
form of a federal grand jury invest-  
igation. So far, eleven people have  
been subpoenaed in the witch hunt,  
which is being held under the guise  
of investigating the George Jackson  
Brigade, an underground group res-  
ponsible for several Seattle area  
bombings.

One woman, Michelle Whitnack, is  
apparently being used as an example  
by the government: She has been in  
jail since July 20th for refusing to  
talk to the Grand Jury.

‘Michelle was a friend of Po Ford,  
who died September 15, 1975 while  
attempting to bomb a Seattle Safeway  
store. Three days after the attempted  
bombing, the George Jackson Brigade  
bombed the same store in support of  
Po (who was not a member of the GJB)  
and to protest the capture of Bill  
and Emily Harris and Patty Hearst.

On January 1st of this year, the  
GJB bombed a Safeway office in Belle-  
vue and a power plant in the rich  
white Laurelhurst area of Seattle.

On January 23rd, the GJB attempted a  
bank robbery in Tukwila, a small town  
near Seattle.

Michelle’s case is such a  
blatant example of govern-  
mental repression that it  
often seems like a Grade B  
movie.

One man was killed by police and two  
others, John Sherman and Ed Mead,  
were captured. Sherman later escaped  
with the help of another man from  
the GJB. Shortly afterwards, Mark  
Cook, a black ex-con and prison  
movement activist, was arrested and  
framed for both the bank robbery  
and Sherman's escape in one of the  
most blatantly ridiculous trials  
Seattle has ever seen.

The subpoenas began after Mead and  
Sherman were captured. On May 1,  
agents from the Bureau of Alcohol,  
Firearms and Tobacco raided a Seattle  
home and served subpoenas on Michelle  
and another woman who lived there and  
one woman who was a former resident.  
Two of the women are single mothers.

The raid was illegally conducted,  
with seizures of address books, wal-  
lets, the financial files of the  
Committee to End Grand Jury Abuse,  
and such “evidence” as electrical  
tape and red felt tip pens. The Feds  
also admitted they had been search-  
ing the garbage of the home. The  
government also seized the house  
typewriters, claiming that the  
George Jackson Brigade communiques  
had come from the house. It was, of  
course, all lies, and no connection  
was made. The women at the house,  
who have now moved because the land-  
lord freaked out about “terrorists”  
living in his house, have filed a  
suit against the government.

Of the eleven people issued subpo-  
enas, one person testified, some  
people appeared once, refused to tes-  
tify, and were not called back, and  
some subpoenas were dropped.

Michelle's case, however, is such  
a blatant example of governmental  
repression that it often seems like  
a Grade “B" movie. She is a former  
member of the Left Bank Books Collec-  
tive, and as a result, Left Bank has  
been getting hassled. Recently, six  
policemen, all supposedly in hot  
pursuit of a car thief, broke into  
an apartment where three members of  
the collective had returned after an  
afternoon of target practice. Their  
guns were seized as “evidence” along  
with books, common household articles  
and even a hairbrush. (The car thief  
was, of course, forgotten.) The three  
were served with subpoenas. An effort  
to have them quashed because the  
police action was illegal recently  
failed in court.

On the last day Michelle appeared  
in response to her subpoena she was  
taken before federal judge Lindberg  
for what was supposed to be a pre-  
liminary hearing. The judge announced  
he'd had enough, and sentenced her  
for contempt without a hearing and  
ordered her to jail. At this point,  
Laurie Raymond, a lesbian feminist  
who has already served 30 days for  
cutting a fence at the Trident nuc-  
lear submarine base, jumped up and  
stated that the judge's order was  

Lureida Torres Freed

NEW YORK (Grand Jury Project)  
Lureida Torres was freed October  
28th after over four months in  
Federal custody for refusing to  
cooperate with a grand jury conduct-  
ing a fishing expedition into the  
Puerto Rican Independence movement  
in the United States.

Torres, a former New York City  
school teacher and member of the  
Puerto Rican Socialist Party (PSP)  
had been called before a Federal  
Grand Jury in New York last January  
which was investigating a series of  
bombings including the February,  
1975 blast at Fraunces Tavern in  
lower Manhattan for which a group  
called the Armed Forces of Puerto  
Rican National Liberation had taken  
credit. Lacking evidence, the FBI  
has been conducting investigations  
against Independence groups and  
individuals, operating on the theory  
that if one believes in independence  
one must know something about the  
bombings.

In a statement Torres issued  
June 1975, she said, "They (the  
Grand Jury) have called on me  
because of my political beliefs,  
violating my constitutional rights  
and my right to the political  
affiliation of my choice.

Throughout history there have  
always been those who are willing  
to sacrifice for their ideals.  
They are moved by a collective  
spirit with the understanding  
that their individual sacrifice  
brings benefits to all. Their  
struggle is imbued with love for  
all people.

My desire to defend my principles  
motivates me and guides me. I do  
not want to waver in my determin-  
ation in the face of this corrupt  
system which oppresses all and in  
particular victimizes the Puerto  
Rican people who are under the  
colonial domination of the United  
States.

When the grand jury expired on  
October 28th, over 250 people gath-  
ered in front of the Metropolitan  
Correctional Center in lower Manhat-  
tan to greet Torres with a candle-  
light vigil after her release from  
the institution. Other inmates of  
the MCC indicated their solidarity  
with Torres by holding matches to  
the windows of their cells.

Torres greeted those assembled  
saying that her jailing was an act  
of repression directed at the indep-  
endence movement, and that she was  
willing to go to jail again if  
necessary.

Lureida Torres may in fact face  
jail again, for it has been the  
FBI's habit to harass previous  
grand jury witnesses who refused to  
cooperate with this illegal use of  
the grand jury by resubpoenaing  
them to a new grand jury.

contemptible and urged the others  
in the courtroom to show resistance.  
She put herself between Michelle and  
the federal marshals and both were  
dragged out of the courtroom, Mich-  
elle by the handcuffs and Laurie  
by the hair. They were beaten in  
the elevator. One marshal told them,  
"Since you're going to act like  
animals, we'll treat you like men."

Laurie was tried for assault on  
November 5th. The jury found her  
guilty after one hour of delibera-  
tion, and she will be sentenced on  
November 30th. The possible sentence  
is 1-3 years in prison. Like so  
many others who have been victimized,  
Laurie is a single mother.

In jail, Michelle and another  
inmate, Gloria Kruger, began organ-  
izing for better medical care for  
the women prisoners. With outside  
support from Leftist Lezzies, a  
Seattle lesbian feminist group, a  
demonstration was held. On September  
23rd, Michelle was transferred to  
the Tacoma city jail, the second  
worst in the state. US Marshall  
Robinson said the transfer was not  
punishment, but that Michelle might  
be a management problem in the  

On October 12th, Michelle was  
transferred back to Seattle. Her next  
legal step is to file a grumbles  
motion. A grumbles motion is the  
attempt to prove, with the help of  
"expert" witnesses and mechanical  
devices that the grand jury witness  
will never cooperate. If this can  
be proven, the lock-up is no longer  
serving its purpose and the witness  
should be released.

It also looks like the government  
is going to try and frame Michelle.  
A recent letter from Michelle says:  

“After I was jailed, an effort got  
underway by the prosecutor's office  
to frame me for a GJB bombing (the  
Laurelhurst City Light substation on  
New Year's Eve). I was dragged by  
five marshals to a lineup where a  
‘witness' identified me as ‘the woman  
who climbed up a tree’ by the sub-  
station the afternoon before.

"No one, including the press, was  
too convinced: the ‘witness’ had  
admittedly been shown photos of me  
before the lineup (as was done  
with Mark Cook, likewise framed for  
nonexistent GJB involvement); folks  
who checked the site say there's no  
reason to climb a tree to case the  
substation, and the only tree that  
would hold my weight has no branches  
for ten feet up. Ed Mead, a GJB  
member captured in February, has  
stated that there were no women, much  
less anyone of my description, involved  
in that particular action.

“I'd rather rot in jail the rest  
of my life before helping put  
anyone in jail.”

“My position of critical support  
for the GJB has included some pretty  
scathing public criticism in the past  
before they cleaned up their act with  
regard to people's safety.”

"The prosecutor's motives to scare  
me to testify, to make me a ‘warning'  
to other witnesses, and to justify  
jailing me without charge or trial to  
the press and public were all too  
obvious even to the straight media.

"Last, and probably least where the  
courts are concerned, I just plain  
didn't do it. I am not, nor have  
I ever been, a member of the George  
Jackson Brigade, nor have I helped  
or participated in any of their  
actions. And I couldn't lead the  
government to them if I wanted to;  
anyway, I'd rather rot in jail the  
rest of my life before helping put  
anyone in prison."

Support for Laurie and Michelle is  
being carried out in Seattle by "Deep  
Freeze", PO Box 12847, Seattle, WA  
98111. Donations are desperately needed  
for Michelle and Laurie’s legal  
fees and to support their kids and  
house. The Grand Jury actions are not  
an isolated case. They are part of a  
pattern that has hit the Native  
American community in Pine Ridge, the  
women's community in Kentucky, the  
Puerto Rican community in New York,  
the Chicano community in Denver, and  
the Left community in Seattle - and  
it won't stop here. Resistance is  
vital, not just to these women, but  
to our movement and its future.

UFW Proposition 14 Voted Down

The United Farm Workers lost a  
major campaign last month when Prop-  
osition 14, the California farm  
labor initiative, was defeated by a  
margin of nearly 2 to 1.

The measure, which got massive  
opposition from big business, would  
have strengthened laws giving farm  
workers the right to vote for the  
union of their choice.

A well-financed media blitz by  
agribusiness aimed to frighten  
voters by calling on them to “pro-  
tect property rights."

Property rights were at stake,  
they claimed, because Proposition  
14 would have guaranteed union org-  
anizers the right to talk to workers  
on ranches for an hour before and  
after work and during lunch breaks.

That right is already allowed  
under the rules of the California  
Agricultural Labor Relations Board  
and upheld by the California and  
U.S. Supreme Courts. Proposition 14  
would have written the board's rules  
into law.

Access to on-ranch organizing is  
crucial to organizing farm workers.  
Often migrant workers live on the  
ranches where they work, or they  
live over a widely scattered area.

Hence, the opposition to Propo-  
sition 14 by agribusiness, which  
financed the "Vote no" campaign.  
Superior Farming, owned by Superior  
Oil, put up $5,000, as did the cor-  
poration president. Other large  
donations came from Getty Oil, Stand-  
ard Oil, Union Oil and the Southern  
Pacific Land Company.

In response, UFW volunteers logged  
thousands of volunteer hours, and  
raised more than a million dollars  
in support of the measure. It wasn't  
enough.

UFW supporters are particularly  
bitter about their endorsement of  
Jimmy Carter, in return for his  
formal backing of Proposition 14.

In practice, however, Carter said  
nothing about the issue in his  
speeches or advertising.  
"Our experience is that we never  
lose," Cesar Chavez said at a Las  
Angeles election night rally.  
"There's more time than money, and  
there's more of us than them."
