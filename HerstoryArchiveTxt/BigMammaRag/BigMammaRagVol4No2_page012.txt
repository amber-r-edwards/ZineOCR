My first impression notes  
jotted nearly 2 years ago after  
meeting Denver's Chocolate  
Waters read:  

“her pen is like a  
rocket of truth.  
her poems shock me rightly  
on, as she asks:  
‘what's wrong  
hating?’ “  

with man-  

These many months later I  
know both the woman and her  
poetry better, and my own fem-  
inist evolution has progressed.  
But now, after twice reading her  
new poetry collection, To The  
Man Reporter from the Denver  
Post, I am still shocked rightly-  
on. Time has only sharpened the  
directions and expression of her  
pen as a rocket of truth. The  
truths are both individual and  
universal, a quality necessary  
for poetry to achieve longevity. I  
can identify personally with  
many of her themes, and yet I  
also experience new ideas and  
thoughts. My awareness of her  
brand of feminism, as revealed  
in these poems, enlightens my  
own feminist development.  

The poems concentrate on  
these thematic emphases: (1)  
personal reflection, (2) love and  
erotica, (3) political statements.  
With the exception of the book's  
title poem, the third section of  
poetry is the weakest by my  
judgment. I wished for more of  
the first kind of poems, pri-  
marily because they reveal the  
author, but also because her  
experiences wound my own past  
out of my memory. Being a ro-  
mantic, I enjoyed the illusions of  
the love poems better than the  
liberated lustiness of Waters’  
erotic selections. Contrasting  
“Loving Her” and “The Les-  
bians Sexually Defined — By a  
Dyke This Time”, I prefer the  
first. Its central illusions coax  
me to imagine the sighs of  
women loving, and hence,  
affects me as sensual. The  
second poem is too blatant for  
my sensibilities. I know that  
when I make love with a woman  
she gets “sloppy wet as new  
grass” but I prefer lines like, “I  
want to whisper in your eyes the  
softest fingers that I can”  
(“Rocking Crazy”).  

Chocolate’s women are given  
to us in these poems with neon-  
bright contemporary imagery  
and structure; women on bill-  
boards, women dancing, women  
nailed inside themselves and  
others, “clawing the wood-  
work”, women angry with man’s  
ignorance to his own historic  
cruelties, women dying horrible  
quiet deaths, their blood seep-

ing up through the snow “delicate as cherry flavoring poured on top of white crushed ice”. We  
meet the Queens (of Wands, of  
Cups), the Mothers (who cry  
silver tears and quote the Bible),  
the lovers (clit licking, night  
stroking).  

For this reader, there is fren-  
etic relentless movement in the  
poetry. It does not sit upon the  
page, nor resemble much of the  
feminist poetry I have found  
“bored and boring, a tired  
cliché”. Throughout all the types  
of poems here is a technique  
uniquely Chocolate’s. It is an  
ability to contrast gentle-tough  
word sounds and pictures. This  
constant hard-soft, long-short,  
simple-complex, close-distant  
change of the imagistic tone pro-  
vides the movement I men-  
tioned. Traditionalists will call  
her work “inconsistent”, per-  
haps, due to this juggling of tone.  
For me, it is exciting and holds  
interest.  

To the Man Reporter from the  
Denver Post sends out its poetic  
experience like a sparkler, with  
many points of focus: word plays  
(“monotony-monogamy”),  
scathing satire (“Let's Be a  
Couple”), small prize-package  
poems, succinct and brilliant,  
rolling off the eye with an easy  
flow (“I Am Still”, “Epitaph”).  
There is painful, almost tan-  
gible vulnerability in several  
poems recounting rejection and  
mutual masochism. I yearn with  
Waters’ “Wishes” poem for that  
parental acceptability sought by  
lesbian daughters who will not  
conform.  

Some of my favorite selec-  
tions include “A Fairy Tella” (re-  
vealing Waters’ inimitable cam-  
py humor), “Wishes” (with its  
unique and original metaphors:  
blanks and spaces, edges and  
connections), and “To A Deli-  
cate Woman in the Ditch”. This  
last poem, on par with the title  
poem for its strength and power,  
is perhaps the best poem I've  
read lately. After inundation  
with Judy Grahn’s “A Woman Is  
Talking to Death” as the rising  
sun of emotional feminist ex-  
pression, Waters’ “Delicate  
Woman” moves me more. The  
tragic ode not only mourns one  
lost sister, but takes to task those  
women who ignore the loss,  
those women consumed in the  
schmaltzy romances written in  
Redbook.  

Stark black-and-white graph-

several of the poems in this col-  
lection, and the cover design by  
Bourge Miller is eye-catching. I  
purposely avoided searching for

symbolism with it because the  
color and design are enough to  
make readers stop and look at  
the book. The layout is varied so  
as to make this package com-  
fortable: rhyme and free verse  
alternate, as do short and longer  
selections, humorous and seri-  
ous themes. In addition, I laud  
this collection because it is en-  
tirely a woman-effort. Waters  
and friends have labored with  
the collating and binding me-  
chanics, distribution and adver-  
tising.  

My dissatisfaction with this  
book is minor, but comes in  
Chocolate Waters’ handling of  
some of her political statement  
poems (which seem too preachy  
and often casually constructed,  
almost like “fillers”), and in gen-  
eral, with her inclusion of sev-  
eral humorous rhyme poems.  
These are not up to par with the  
others I have mentioned. They  
somehow miss their mark, both  
in the rhyme’s meter and mean-  
ing. “A Name by any other  
Name” gave me a smile, but I  
think it’s too “in” to be worthy of  
the collection. It is a self-indul-  
gence Waters should have  
withheld.  

As a feminist, there are two  
things most important to me:  
Vital, living, woman-loving  
women and women in the pro-  
cess of creating. To the Man Re-  
porter from the Denver Post is  
the result of Chocolate Waters’  
following the spoor of creativity  
in that jungle of chaotic con-  
flicting influences known as the  
human experience. The book  
speaks of women and to women  
with angry foot-stomping for the  
injustice Waters sees, and with  
some of the most positive femin-  
ist one-liners I've ever read:  

“My wishes growing fat  
and possible”  

“I will always have a  
woman with me”  

Along with Chocolate, I am wait-  
ing for the Amazons to march off  
the billboards and lay some  
womanpower on Wall Street.  
She says people have tried to pay  
her to stop writing. Well, even  
though I'm billed as “one per-  
son who likes Chocolate”, that is  
not the reason I urge you to pay  
for the privilege of reading this  
collection of her poems. Be-  
cause of Chocolate, and in spite  
of her, the book is a notable and  
worthy addition to any feminist  
library. She shares intensely  
with the reader those involve-  
ments she has actively nur-  
tured since the age of seven:  
women and words.

The Feminist Book of Lights and Shadows  

Z. Budapest et al  
paperback; $4.00  
Woodwoman  

The Feminist Book of Lights  
and Shadows is a spiritual tool  
for political activists. It was  
wholly produced by members of  
the Los Angeles-based Susan B.  
Anthony Coven #1, whose High  
Priestess, Z. Budapest, was re-  
cently tried and convicted for for-  
tune-telling.  

The authors state their politi-  
cal position in Chapter 1, entit-  
led ‘Politics of Women’s Relig-  
ion’. Their position is that the  
repression of Goddess-worship  
has been an important aspect of  
women’s cultural oppression;  
and that, by reclaiming and glori-  
fying the feminine principle, we  
can “re-energize the male-  
dominated masses of wimmin.”  
(Womon’ and ‘wimmin’ are  
used throughout the book, pre-  
sumably to avoid the ‘man’ and  
‘men’ incorporated in the usual  
spelling.)  

This chapter, and a later one  
on ‘Herstory’, explain who the  
Goddess is, a necessary intro-  
duction, since she is the focus of  
the ancient Wiccan religion,  
which is where the book is  
coming from.  

Rituals and Holy Days  

The reader is taken step by  
step through basic rituals, star-  
ting with a calendar showing the  
days traditionally holy to  
witches, and a description of the  
tools needed for effective  
Goddess-worship and spell-  
making. Meanings and uses of  
different oils, candles and in-  
censes follow.  

The ‘Basic Witchy Set-up’ is  
described, plus detailed instruc-  
tions on how to celebrate each  
individual holy day; how to  
initiate new witches; the Wiccan  
Runic alphabet; spells (including  
one ‘to hex a rapist’); notes on  
herbs and on how to organize a  
coven or grove; a brief guide to  
the Tarot; and a bibliography of  
reference books for those in-  
terested in further study.  

The book is peppered through-  
out with political references:  

“witchcraft has never fit into the  
patriarchal system, so relax;  
listen to your feelings and body.”  
Or, in an invocation to the God-  
dess: “You can break the chains  
of our oppression / with your  
force, / while lapping inside us  
a love and sexuality.” Also  
sprinkled throughout are poems  
and chants of praise or suppli-  
cation to the Goddess.  

Not that the tone of the book is  
solemn. We are twice reminded  
that “the Goddess hates boring  
circles”, and encouraged to  
“boogie” at ritual celebrations.  

Cupcakeism  

One aspect of the book that  
particularly appealed to me was  
that it exploded the myth of  
white, as opposed to black,  
witchcraft. Dismissing the fear  
of casting negative spells as  
‘cupcakeism’, the authors assert  
that “a witch who cannot hex  
cannot heal . . . turning the other  
cheek is for Judeo-Christians, not  
witches.”  

I would have felt better about  
the chapter on Tarot had the  
author made clearer the essen-  
tial fluidity of the cards’ in-  
dividual interpretations. The  
reader's intuition, her past ex-  
perience of the cards, the con-  
text in which they are read, all  
contribute to a reading. A  
beginner reading this chapter  
might be tempted to adopt the  
author's interpretations rather  
than using them as a guide, to  
the detriment of her own  
development as a reader. I would  
have liked to see the reader's  
own part in the Tarot process  
better dealt with. Otherwise, the  
chapter is clear and informative.  

The Feminist Book of Lights  
and Shadows is essential for any  
aspiring witch, and useful for  
those of the rest of us who feel  
strange stirrings at full moon, or  
who want to know how to regain  
psychic balance after a rape.  

At the end of the book, the  
authors promise a second edi-  
tion. So mote it be — and soon.  

Women in Transition...  

From Page 11  

1970 found its switchboard  
loaded with calls from dis-  
traught women going through  
divorce or separation. They  
ranged from frenetic young  
feminists to flustered, un-  
liberated grandmothers. Typical  
questions involved how to find a  
lawyer who would not cheat  
them, where to get helpful  
therapists, how to find job train-  
ing, employment counseling and  
day care for children. And they  
needed emotional support. Pleas  
for information and sisterhood  
kept coming from young and old,  
black and white, middle and  
working class, lesbian mothers  
and common law wives. Women  
in Transition offers valuable  
material for each of these  
categories.  

A group of volunteers from  
The Women’s Center, them-  
selves divorced or separated,  
banded together and formed a  
group called Women in Transi-  
tion. After working with 5,000  
women going through these  
changes, they wrote Women in  
Transition based on this vast  
experience. Thirty-six authors  
further assure extensive and  
intensive material.  

The 532 pages contain an  
extraordinary gamut of infor-  
mation from copies of pertinent  
legal papers to prose and poetry  
by those who have experienced  
these crises. The first offers a  
path through the legal jungle  
and the last into private pains  
and problems. Those who feel  
unlearned or unsupported in  
marital breakdown or in leaving  
other intimate relationships will  
find Women in Transition a book  
of answers and assurance.  

Concerning the legal situation  
the writers state, “We have  
learned about the high cost of  
separation and divorce, about  
the delays in the judicial process  
and the sexism behind the laws  
regarding marriage, separation,  
divorce and custody. . . All of the  
women (who have come to us)  
have taught us something we  
could never learn in law books,  
or classes, or law offices and  
courtrooms. They have taught  
us a lot about what the law does  
as well as what it says.”  

Something of the desperation  
of female despair comes out in  
such poems as:  

Alright

leftover energy

and danced their way  

off a cliff  

Letters from the experienced  
punctuate the sections. One  
tells how she solved the com-  
mon difficulty of her ex-hus-  
band who kept shortchanging  
her with ordered monies (court-  
ordered payments):  

So I decided to put a stop to  
it. What I did was to stop  
reacting, no matter how hard  
it was, and believe me, it was.
