Spirituality  
Feminist Rediscovers Her Jewishness  

Rebecca Lesses  

I am a Jewish woman, a fem-  
inist and a lesbian. In the  
last year I have become re-  
acquainted with my Jewish  
identity, and I continue to  
be involved in feminist pol-  
itical activity.  

Very personal reasons  
prompted my rediscovery of  

Jewishness. Last year, my mo-  
ther was diagnosed as having  
cancer. I was immediately  
panicked and didn't know  
where to turn. Her cancer  
made no sense. I began to  
think about God/dess again.  

Before my mother got sick,  
I had gone to some feminist  
and progressive celebrations  
of Jewish holidays -- one  
year, for instance, while I  
was living in Santa Cruz, my  
roommates and I held a wo-  
men's Passover seder. I had  
also gone to a couple of God-  
dess celebrations, which  
hadn't touched me. However,  
questions about divinity had  
not seemed very important.  

When my mother got sick,  
the whole framework I had  
set up for understanding  
the world -- which included  
feminism -- started to col-  
lapse. Experience became a  
series of unrelated events,  
with no explanation of why  
one followed another. Along  
with this, at about the same  
time (maybe because of it)  

I was thinking about the Hol-  
ocaust. I was trying to think  
about it in a way that would  
not make me fall into com-  
plete hopelessness.  

I was also trying to think  
about it in a way that would  
not make my negative reaction  
to it my reason for being  
Jewish. I have found this to  
be a very common thing among  
American Jews, and I think it  
has a very negative effect on  
the community here.  

This collection of reasons  
resulted in my going to a  
Friday night service of  
Tikvah Chadashah, the gay  
synagogue in Seattle. I went  
because I wanted to find out  
if Judaism had any answers  
to the questions I was ask-  
ing -- or even if I could  
find some understanding of  
why I was asking those ques-  
tions. Nothing else I knew  
offered me even a response,  
not even the feminist com-  

munity, which has just begun  
to talk about death (two  
recently published books I  
can think of are The Cancer  
Journals by Audre Lorde and  
Lifetime Guarantee by Alice  
Bloch). What I found when  

I went there was reason to  
have hope; I didn't have to  
stay in the corner I had  
backed myself into!  

Now, you might ask, what  
is a feminist doing as an  
involved member of a relig-  
ious community which has  
been historically, and still  
is largely, patriarchal?  
Couldn't I have found what  
I wanted in modern-day wo-  
men's spirituality?  

The Jewish groups which I  
found in the last year are  
not in the Jewish establish-  
ment, and are committed to  
having men and women take  
an equal part in everything.  
That's the only way I could  
have gotten involved with  
them. I certainly would not  
be happy in the Orthodox  
community. As a matter of  
fact, the forces for equal  
women's involvement in the  
Jewish community are even  
touching more traditional  
institutions. One of the  
women I work with belongs  
to a Conservative synagogue.  
She just recently was bas  
mitzvah (in traditional,  
Orthodox Judaism, only men  
are bar mitzvah, at the age  
of 13. In the Reform and  
Conservative movements wo-  
men also become bas mitzvah.  
My friend didn't do it at 13,  
I'm not sure why), she  
led the Torah discussion  
one recent Saturday morning  
at her synagogue, and she  
is making herself a tallis  
(the prayer shawl which is  
traditionally worn only by  
men). All of these are acts  
traditionally participated in  
only by men. Much of the sex-  
ism of the Jewish community  
consists in women being bar-  
red from doing the most sig-  
nificant religious acts, and  
to have women now participa-  
ting in them is very impor-  
tant.  

My basic answer to the  
questions above is that Jew-  
ish ritual moves me very  
deeply and is the way I feel  
most comfortable talking to  
God/dess, (as a friend of  
mine says). It moves me the  
way no other celebration or  
ritual does, and I think a  
very important part of reli-  
gion is how it moves people  

emotionally. Feminist spir-  
ituality, with no Jewish  
reference, doesn't do a  
thing for me.  

Nonetheless, the patri-  
archal basis of Judaism  
bothers me, irritates me,  
weighs down heavily on me  
(although I don't suffer  
from its most obvious as-  
pects, because the group I  
belong to is egalitarian in  
practice). I sit and read  
the Torah portion every week  
(the Torah is the first five  
books of the Bible, and over  
the course of the year is  
read in its entirety in the  
synagogue, a few chapters at  
a time) and have arguments  
with myself about why I'm  
spending so much time read-  
ing about men, with little  
mention of women. The Torah  
records the encounters of  
men with divinity -- I can-  
not believe that at the same  
time Jewish women weren't  

also encountering divinity.  
But their experiences were  
not written down, for the  
most part. I would guess  
that the men who wrote down  
and codified the Bible sim-  
ply weren't paying atten-  
tion, to know what the wo-  
men were thinking (and of  
course, since what women  
wrote did not get included,  
we can't know directly from  
them). It's not easy, but so  
far, it has been worth it to  
me to persist.  

I see what I do as a Jew-  
ish person as a basis for  
political action, in the  
sense of giving me a firm  
ground to act from. It gives  
me a center, so that I'm not  
just running around not  
knowing what I'm doing. Jud-  

aism is not a system of pol-  
itical analysis, but it has  
principles of acting justly  
and establishing justice  
which are principles I try to  
use in political (and person-  
al) action.  

Which brings me to the  
larger Jewish community. In  
the United States, the Jewish  
community has historically  
been left of center. It still  
is, although a certain prom-  
inent part of it has been  
snared by neoconservatism  
(some of the most vicious at-  
tacks in the American press  
on Jacobo Timerman were made  
by Jewish neoconservatives.  
Jacobo Timerman was an Argen-  
tinian newspaper publisher,  
author of Prisoner Without a  
Name, Cell Without a Number,  
written after he was expelled  
from Argentina. In the book,  
he talked about the extent of  
Nazi anti-Semitism in Argen-  
tina (among other things,  
such as his experiences in  
the clandestine military pri-  
sons where he was held for  
two years) and the dangers it  
poses to the Argentine Jewish  
community). Jews were very  
involved in the Old Left --  
the Socialist and Communist  
Parties -- and there are a  
disproportionate number of  
Jews now involved in radical  
politics. I think the Jewish  
tradition is hospitable to  
movements which call for the  
establishment of justice.  

For instance, here in the  
Boston area, the Jewish Com-  
munity Council has a women's  
issues committee which is  
working with other groups to  
preserve abortion rights. In  
the last year or so, the New  
Jewish Agenda has been formed  

as a nationwide organization  

to promote progressive poli-  
tics (feminist, anti-militar-  
ist, pro-lesbian and gay  
rights) in the Jewish commun-  
ity and an awareness of Jew-  
ish concerns among radicals.  
NJA is making it possible to  
be a Jewish radical who does  
not hide her concern for Jew-  
ishness when among other pro-  
gressive people, or her con-  
cern for radical politics  
when among Jews. I'm a member  
of the Boston chapter and its  
Feminist Task Force. On Feb-  
ruary 7, we put on a program  
about reproductive rights and  
the threat of the Human Life  
Amendment, and in the end of  
March, we will be holding a  
day of workshops for Jewish  
women.
