spite. I explained to him
that my strike was not the
product of spite, but rather
freedom. My proposal was to
be transferred to another
institution where I would
be able to be productive in
the mainstream or to be
released into the population
here. The hunger strike was
not initiated on the basis
of a suicidal tendency nor
was I a martyr. But I had
come to the conclusion that
to be forced to live in such
confinement under such wretched
conditions was itself

a kind of death. It was

that belief alone that
caused me to initiate a hunger
strike. I had a "cause"
and that cause was freedom.
I suffer from no psychopathic
disorders. I am a
person that acts with careful
deliberation. I have
likes and dislikes just as
any other normal human being.

Because incarcerated people
do not have means to
gain proper legal representation,
such atrocities are
allowed and justified. Often
such horrors go untold.

The administration has and

will continue to justify
their most severe injustices. 
I do not make this
statement lightly or without
serious reflection and
without knowing it to be
factual. The administration's
brutal repression,

suppression, and oppression
is justified by the so-called
"hands off" policy. Many and
all policies need to be
questioned. The administration's
improper classification of inmates
is even justifiable. I am
classified as a non-conformist
and being argumentative. Because
I do not and will not conform
to their games of injustice,
I am classified as a non-conformist.
If I intelligently question
something, then I am classified
as being argumentative. Since I am a

prisoner, I have no right

to question whatever it is
that I need to know. So
with the failure of communication
there is and will be no
understanding. I am
left hanging in limbo.

*Sharron filed a suit
against K.C.I.L. and the
officers responsible for
this brutality. Part way
through the proceedings her
lawyer filed a "Motion to
Dismiss" her civil suit in
absence of any request by
Sharron to do so,

"...I was not informed of
the reasons why my case was
dismissed. I informed the
courts that I was an indigent
person and that I did
not have correct knowledge
of their law(s), yet my
suit was still dismissed.
The showing of such inconsistencies
only proves my suspicion of the so-called
"Criminal Injustice System"
and also such inconsistencies

where we’re at

birth in California prisons (see pg. 4) and the stories

of two women who are locked up and brutalized in two different
fascist U.S. prisons (see pg 5 and pg.14) In Oct. and
Nov. '83, at Marion prison in Illinois, each inmate was
systematically dragged from his cell and beaten and this
information is only now available in the media.

Sometimes we feel that if we say this every month, because
it has been true every month, that it makes it less real to
you, our readers. But....we very much need money, and do not
have the money to print, much less mail, the March issue.
Each month is more difficult, in these economic times, for
the paper and for us (and you) to just get by. Any money
that you can give to BMR is desperately needed. Each month
(and especially this month--we have about 50 requests for
subscriptions for women in prisons) many of our subscriptions
are mailed to prisoners and inmates of psychiatric institutions
and we are committed to continue sending these free subscriptions.
Anybody who shares this commitment with us and who can afford to,
can send money for a subscription for one of the many inmates who are
on our mailing list. Also, we have gotten very much behind
in our subscription list and in notifying you when your subscription has run
out. Please take the time to look at the numbers over your
name on the mailing label--this is the month and year that
your subscription runs out. If it says anything before 3-84
then your subscription has expired and we haven't been able to let
you know. If so, we hope you want to continue reading BMR
and will send $9.00 to renew.

Kay has told us that the newspaper boxes are being jammed
with paper, etc. making it impossible for anyone to put
their $ in and get a paper. If you notice this, please
call so that maybe we can get out and fix it before the
month is over.

As you can tell, we are in quite a state at BMR and are
overwhelmed by the happenings of the past few months. Until
next month...... BMR collective.

cies allow the Penal System
to continue to keep me in
the mud...face down!"

Since the publication of
this article, the case I referred to has been reopened.
As I am an indigent person
and still without legal
representation, I need help
in securing an attorney.

I am still the victim of
this administration's premeditated brutality. On
Sept. 17th, 1983, a SGT. on
duty called me "bitch" sev-
eral times. There was no
provocation from me. The
SGT. threatened me with
bodily harm. I reported the
incident through the proper
inmate grievance procedure
and once again justice and
truth were denied.

The policy of ignoring
threats from officers to
inmates is still very much
in effect. This policy al-
lows prison administrators
full control, and all bru-
tality can be covered up,
cleaned up, ignored, and
finally dismissed.

Homelessness
from page 12

in the discussion of vio-
lence and abuse toward the
homeless, the specific vul-
nerability of homeless wom-
en to rape and sexual as-
sault is not explored. There
is no discussion of the need
to safeguard women and
children from sexual assault
in new and existing shel-
ters.

The ratio of beds at the
Washington, D.C. shelter
opened Jan. 15, 1984, is
listed at 800 for men and
200 for women. Children are
not mentioned. Does this
reflect the ratio at which
women and men consistently
appear at shelters or does
it reflect society's bias
in favor of men? If women
request shelter less often
than men, what are the rea-
sons for that--are they
afraid of getting raped at
the shelter? Are they af-
raid the welfare department
or an ex-husband will take
their children away if they
admit how bad off they are?
Are children presumed to be
included in the slots as-
signed to women, making the
ratio even more strongly
biased towards men?

Little mention is made of
the direct experience of
mothers and children liv-
ing out on the street. Since
we know that women as a
class are poorer than men
they must be out there. Os-
tensibly, poor women and
their children are eligible

for Aid to Families with
Dependent Children, the
public assistance program
usually referred to as wel-
fare. But those of us who
have dealt with the system
know that it discourages,
intimidates and turns away
as many people as possible,
eligible or not. A little-
known fact explored by re-
searcher Marianne Stewart

in an unpublished research
paper (available from her
on request at P.O. Box 11737,
Costa Mesa, CA 92627) is
that many women in prison
started out as welfare moth-
ers. Fully 80% have young
children and the same per-
centage had either no in-
come or less than $2,000
the year prior to incarcer-
ation, which makes poor
women prime targets for loss
of freedom, whether they
receive any kind of aid or
not.

American feminists don't
know very much about poverty
in America, global hunger,
and prison, which is really
a legalized form of intern-
ment for political prisoners
and the poor. We know less
about poor and imprisoned
women in other countries and
I don't think we have made
these issues a priority. The
only organization that I
know of to take on world de-
privation as its primary
political focus is the New/
Fourth World Movement (172
First Ave., NY, NY 10009
(212) 228-1339). A humanitarian
rather than a feminist
movement, it takes its name
to describe the poorest peo-
ple world-wide and has col-
lected more than 250,000
signatures internationally
on an appeal with this key
sentence,

"I denounce extreme poverty
and social exclusion as a
basic violation of human
rights."

Aside from ritual com-
plaints and making excuses
for the things we don’t get
done because of financial
pressures, most of us prob-
ably don't think much in
terms of global economic
problems, except to assume
that things are bad and get-
ting worse. As feminists, we
need to develop sound econ-
omic theories and analysis
concerning women and pover-
ty with the same zeal that
we have devoted to other
issues, and reading Homeless—
ness in America: A Forced
March to Nowhere is a good
place to start.
