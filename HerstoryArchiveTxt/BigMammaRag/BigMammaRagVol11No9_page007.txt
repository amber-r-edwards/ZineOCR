Martial Civil Law

The so-called lifting of the
martial law in Poland actual-
ly means incorporating its
provisions into civil law, so
in fact it's worse than if no-
thing has changed. The amnesty
is likewise very limited. Not
only will not all Solidarity
activists be released, but
even those released have to
sign a pledge not to partici-
pate in future protests. Yet,
those two things—lifting
martial law and general amnes-
ty—were supposed to be the
big concessions the government
made to the Church as part of
their deal. In fact, so pleas-
ed are the Russians with the
"success" of the Pope's visit
to Poland that they are now
holding talks with the Vati-
can for the Pope's visit to
Estonia, where there are many
more dissidents.

Drafting Nurses

Legislation is in the works
that would make some women
eligible for the draft. Con-
cerned about the potential
shortage of wartime doctors
and nurses, the Pentagon is
drafting legislation that
would give the President the
power to order the registra-
tion of doctors and nurses un-
der the age of 46. "97 to 98%
of the nurse population is
female," said Lt. Col Tom
Schumann, deputy director of
health manpower for the Def-
ense Department. "The only
way I can see getting that
many nurses is to draft fe-
males," he said. The American
Nurses Assn. is urging people
to protest.

Flying Scabs

Community Hospital and
Health Care Systems, Inc.,
whose three hospitals in
Prince George's County, MD,
are currently being struck
by nurses, has brought in
"flying nurses" to break the
strike. These nurses are pro-
fessional scabs, paid to fly
around the country and take
the jobs of striking nurses.
Hospital spokesmen admitted
that the scabs had been hired
on a temporary basis from an
agency which specializes in
scab labor. According to the
Maryland Nurses Association,
these same scabs were flown
in to break another strike at
a nearby hospital last winter.
The hospital board pays the
scab's air fare, room and
board and union wages.

Vagimatic

Gyn-O-Tek, Inc. claims that
twice-a-day, 10 minute ses-
sions with Vagitone (yes, those
are the real names) will
strengthen the PC muscle,
which supports pelvic organs
like the bladder, to cure or
control incontinence and
“even help women reach orgasm
during intercourse." Squeez-
ing the PC as if to hold back
urine is the usual way to
strengthen the muscle. But
for $256, Vagitone is said to
do the work for you. Inserted
in the vagina, the device
emits 2-second, low-voltage
"impulses" that make the PC
contract. Users report sensa-
tions from a painless tingling
to an unpleasant jolt.

Army Bombed

On August 21, the United
Freedom Front bombed an Army
Reserve Center in the Bronx,
NY. In their communique they
wrote, "All the Peoples of
the world must unite with
these courageous Sisters and
Brothers in their just bat-
tle for the defense of the
Nicaraguan Revolution, the
inevitable victory of the
Salvadoran People and the
rights of all Central Ameri-
can Peoples to Freedom, Self-
determination and a future
for the Children free of hun-
ger, fear and need." In
"Solidarity to all progres-
sive individuals and organi-
zations opposing U.S. invol-
vement in Central America."

Sisulu Jailed

Albertina Sisulu, longtime
activist of the outlawed Afri-
can National Congress (ANC) in
South Africa, was arrested and
jailed without bail only 5
weeks after her banning order
of 17 years was allowed to
lapse. Sisulu is a household
word in South Africa, and she
is considered a double danger
to the regime for her decades
of committed activism and the
role of her imprisoned husband
and of her children. Sisulu's
arrest came on the eve of the
formation of the National Dem-
ocratic Front, a broad coali-
tion "merging the African,
colored (mixed race) and In-
dian people," formed to oppose
the government's attempt to
split these communities. De-
spite her arrest, Sisulu, who
was involved in organizing
the front, was elected presi-
dent of its Transvaal regional
council.

Laboruptcy

A Philadelphia appeals court
has ruled that labor contracts
become void and the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
rules do not apply once a com-
pany enters bankruptcy. Hence,
industry has found a new wea-
pon against labor, phony
bankruptcy. One of the most
recent examples is Continental
Airlines, whose first action
after filing bankruptcy was to
throw out the union contract,
halve wages and increase work
hours. Wilson Foods, the coun-
try's biggest pork producer,
with 8,000 workers, has just
used it to cut benefits and
slash wages 40-50%, despite
the fact it made $13 million
in profits last year. Manville,
the big asbestos producer,
used it last year to escape
the lawsuits of workers dying
from asbestos and lung cancer
while it made $20.3 million
in the first quarter of 1983.

Coffee Boycott

The Denver Justice and
Peace Committee is calling
for a boycott of General
Foods brand coffees as part
of a nationwide campaign to
halt the purchase of coffee
from El Salvador and Guata-
mala. General Foods markets
15 brands of coffee includ-
ing Maxwell House and Sanka.
The Committee is urging peo-
ple to purchase coffee from
Nicaragua and Tanzania when
possible.

Dowry Burnings

Women in India beat a man
accused of murdering his wife
for her dowry, after marching
to the man's house to protest
police failure to arrest him
for the murder. It is common-
place for women to be killed
in India because of small
dowries. The first death sen-
tence ever for wife murder
came in India last May, fol-
lowing the burning of a 21-
year-old pregnant woman. Hun-
dreds of protestors carried
her body through the streets
before her in-laws who burned
her were even arrested. Six-
teen women died of burns in
one week in New Delhi last
June. Husbands and in-laws
burn the women because of
small dowries, and suffer lit-
tle consequence under the law.

Maggio Strike

Two hundred Chicana and La-
tina farmworkers are entering
their eighth week of striking
against the nation's largest
carrot producer, Carl Joseph
Maggio Inc. Carrie Lopez of
the United Food and Vegetable
Workers and a worker at Maggio
for 11 years says the company
reduced salaries $1.50/hour,
cut out medical benefits,
pensions, paid vacations and
other benefits. The workers
had not even sought a wage
increase, just a freeze.
"This strike affects every-
one," says Lopez, pointing
out that contracts with other
packing houses expire in 1984
and if Maggio wins "it will
deeply affect the other
workers."

Selling Babies

Wartime entrepreneurs in
El Salvador have begun a new
form of trade in human life
and it's not in weapons produc-
tion. Infant stealing and
other adoption-related frauds
have become a million dollar
business in El Salvador.
