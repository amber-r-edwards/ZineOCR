Act Now To  
Save Lakota Nation

Dear Friend,

I need your help. Not just  
for myself, but for a now-  
or-never effort to save the  
Lakota Nation from total  
demise.

Our people, as you well  
know, have just barely man-  
aged to survive the last 100  
years of U.S. Government  
subjugation.

When it comes to poverty,  
we are hands-down the worst  
off in America. Of the seven  
poorest "counties" in the  
U.S., four are Lakota Res-  
ervations here in South Dak-  
ota, and the poorest "county"  
of all is where I live - the  
Pine Ridge Reservation.

As for work, there is vir-  
tually none. Unemployment is  
now over 80%. Imagine four  
out of five of your neigh-  
bors out of work with no  
hope in sight!

Add to that the coldest  
winter this century, high  
food and energy prices, and  
you have a situation even  
worse than that in 1973 when  
we "revolted" at Wounded  
Knee.

Back then it was our hope  
that our actions would jar  
the nation's conscience and  
as a result save our young.  
We revolted in vain.

Besides the fact that un-  
employment, disease and  
crime have all risen hor-  
ribly, something even worse  
is about to happen. Corpor-  
ate mining interests working  
hand-in-hand with the Fed-  
eral Government have just  
concluded a "development"  
plan which as a by-product  
will totally drain the main  
water aquifer on Pine Ridge  
by the end of this decade.

Our future and our hopes  
will evaporate with the last  
drop of water.

They must be stopped.

Next month - February 14  
to be exact - we have a  
golden opportunity to stop  
them dead in their tracks  
and to reverse the last 100  
years of misfortunes. And  
amazingly, it is ballots not  
bullets, that may win us our  
freedom.

For that is the date of  
the Oglala Sioux Tribal  
Council election. And this  
year there is a slate of in-  
dividuals representing a un-  
ified program called TREATY  
running for each council  
seat including the Tribal  
Council President.

If you know about TREATY -  
The True Revolution for  
Elders, Ancestors, Treaties  
and Youth - you know that it  
could bring lasting relief  
to Pine Ridge.

According to Article 6 of  
the United States Constitu-  
tion the U.S. can enter into  
treaties only with sovereign  

nations. The U.S. Government  
has signed not one, but four,  
treaties with the Lakota Na-  
tion. Therefore in terms of  
U.S. and international law,  
the Lakota Nation is a sov-  
ereign nation.

It is time we start acting  
sovereign.

If elected, the TREATY  
slate will immediately sever  
relations with the U.S. Gov-  
ernment. Sure, in the short  
run, some of the few services  
left may be terminated - but  
we have already begun explor-  
ing alternative sources of  
aid. Many European nations  
and Japan have expressed in-  
terest in opening diplomatic  
and financial relations with  
us. This is not new. For  
years the American Indian  
International Treaty Office  
at the United Nations has  
been seeding these hopes.  
Now we can watch them bear  
fruit: technical assistance,  
foreign aid and trade pacts  
that will allow us to sell  
the grain and cattle we grow  
at a reasonable profit.

With this leverage TREATY  
will develop new avenues of  
trade with the United States.  
Our trade agreements will  
stress self-sufficiency. It  
is time we develop the capa-  
city to feed and clothe our-  
selves again!

TREATY is the only hope  
Pine Ridge has to combat mal-  
nutrition, unemployment, al-  
coholism and illiteracy.  
TREATY is the only hope we  
have to stop the developers  
before they steal every last  
drop of water under our land.

Nothing less than the fu-  
ture of our people is at  
stake. But the developers  
and those greedy individuals  
who prosper at our peoples’  
demise know this too. They  
understand how important  
next month's Tribal Council  
elections are.

As a result, they have  
just announced who their  
candidate is. None other  
than Dick Wilson!

I don't know if you remem-  
ber Dick Wilson. He was Tri-  
bal Council President once  
before - during the 1973  
siege at Wounded Knee. Under  
his reign of terror, 234 In-  
dians were violently killed  
++-murdered. And not one of  
the killers was ever brought  
to justice. Wilson's goon  
squad roamed this reserva-  
tion with total legal im-  
punity.

The greedy developers know  
that it will take an “army"  
like this to steal the rest  
of our land and water.

Dick Wilson must be stop-  
ped.

The developers must be  
stopped.

As a result I am asking  
you, will you help us stop  
them before it is too late?

TREATY is the last peace-  
ful option we have. With

your help we can print our  
message and circulate it to  
every single voter before  
the election. With your fi-  
nancial support we can offer  
free rides to the polls to  
every voter.

Please don't forget - it  
is freezing cold and we are  
under mounds of snow. With-  
out our offer of rides many  
of the elderly, many of the  
poor will have no way to get  
to the polls.

Please help us. One doll-  
ar, five dollars - twenty  
dollars if you are working  
and can afford it will go a  
long way towards our goal  
of $4800. It seems unbe-  
lievable that for the same  
amount of money that it  

takes to make a down-pay-  
ment on a new car, we can  
make a down-payment on our  
entire future, on our child-  
ren's future.

Please contribute what  
you can and send it to  
TREATY at once. We have  
very little time before the  
election and much to accom-  
plish. I am afraid that  
without your support, we  
cannot do it alone.

Thank you.

Mercury POISONING, from page 9 -

Q What do you think others  
working in dentistry should  
do?

A If they're still hand  
squeezing amalgam, stop!  
Read about mercury poison-  
ing and get tested for it.

I think that they should  
talk to others, in the same  
office and in their associa-  
tions, and take group ac-  
tion. There is a new regula-  
tion on the handling of mer-  
cury in Ontario, but at the  
request of the Canadian Den-  
tal Association, dental of-  
fices have been excluded.  
They say they can look af-  
ter their own offices and  
don't need government inter-  
ference! This is completely  
unacceptable.

There are a whole list of  
hygiene precautions recom-  
mended for dental workers  
in most of the literature  
on the subject, including  
not eating or drinking in  
work areas; working with  
mercury only on smooth, liv-  
id surfaces; ensuring the  
proper ventilation of amal-  
gam-mixing areas; not sal-  
vaging scrap amalgam for  
recycling; using only im-  
pervious and seam-free floor  
coverings; not wearing work  

shoes or clothes out of the  
office and not allowing  
smoking in dental offices.

But I think that there  
are some other important  
things that don't often get  
mentioned. I think that den-  
tal workers should also  
make sure that they aren't  
exposed further to mercury  
in their hobbies and crafts;  
wear a mercury vapour moni-  
tor and an x-ray dosimeter  
at all times; leave the of-  
fice for breaks; keep in-  
formed about new research  
and procedures in mercury  
handling and substitution;  
question any potential em-  
ployer about their attitude  
towards mercury.

Speaking from personal ex-  
perience, ignorance is not  
bliss.

exposure. Please write her
