Radclyffe Hall at the  
Well of Loneliness

Radclyffe Hall and Una  
Troubridge were openly les-  
bian lovers at a time when  
Havelock Ellis was recovering  
from the trials in which his  
books on “sexual inversion”  
were banned. Not only were  
these two women open about  
their love, but Hall wrote the  
lesbian classic The Well of  
Loneliness at this same time.  
The expectations, then, of  
The Life and Death of  
Radclyffe Hall (Hammond &  
Hammond, London 1961)  
written by Troubridge, run  
quite high. This book would  
surely divulge the emotions  
and trials these two brave  
women faced while Hall's  
book was being banned in  
England and the States. The  
reader is disappointed to  
discover that this is merely  
one of many important things  
Troubridge deletes from her  
narrative. After reading about  
“Tea at 4,” which dog was  
sick at which home, and  
battling with the overly dis-  
creet “common cause,” the  
reader readily agrees with  
Djuna Barnes in her Ladies  
Almanack portrayal of the two  
as “Lady Buck-and-Balk  
(Hall) and Tilly Tweed-in-  
Blood...who sported a mon-  
ocle and believed in  
marriage.”  

Enter on the scene a new  
biography written in 1975.  

Perhaps this book will give a  
modern perspective on their  
lives. Unfortunately, it is  
written by a man who shows  

Lia the Belly  

Terra  

BMR: To begin with could  
you give us a history of belly  
dancing?  

Lia: There isn’t exact infor-  
mation on the origins because  
it goes far, far back. It did  
originate somewhere in the  
Middle East. In the ancient  
tombs of Pharaohs there are  
shapes of women that look like  
belly dancers.  

It all began with women,  
before going into labor, their  
nannies suggesting that they  
work on their stomach muscles  
to have easier births. Later,  
this use of the muscles and  
movements of childbirth were  
incorporated into a dance.  

In the villages, belly dancing  
was used as a fertility dance as  
well as a folk dance where  
women got together and  
danced for themselves and for  
each other as a celebration. In  
harems it was taught to harem  
girls to entertain the men and  
of course now there is the  
belly dancing in night clubs,  
cabaret style.  

There are different forms of  
belly dancing. For instance,  
there is the Egyptian style,  
which has very little move-  
ment of the feet with isolated  
parts of the body moving, and  
then there is the style more  
prevalent in America which is  
more a blending with the  
creative aspects from modern  
dance, which is much more  
interesting and beautiful.  

BMR: Belly dancing has  
become very popular as a form  
of exercise for women. What  
are the benefits of getting into  
belly dancing?  

Lia: Belly dancing is used for  
many reasons. One of the  
main reasons in this country is  

Una Troubridge, painting by Romaine Brooks 1924  

his sexism and heterosexism  
on every page. He continually  
trivializes his subjects, ma-  
king them appear by turns  
ridiculous, “neurotic,” and as  
“egoists.” A bond is formed  
between the reader and the  
subject through the medium of  
a common oppressor, the  
writer.  

Lovat is truly liberal in his  
treatment of these women’s  
lives. He cannot keep his  
prejudices in line after con-  
gratulating himself on his  
enlightenment in the first  
chapter. Presumably, he likes  
the people he writes about,  
otherwise, why write their  
biographies? However, he  
seems to side with their  
adversaries time and again.  
Lovat, enlightened liberal  
that he is, shows how well he  
understands their plight by  
reminding his reader con-  
stantly that his subjects were  
“neurasthenic,” or “ego-  
maniacs,” or both. He finds it  
difficult to comprehend how  

Troubridge could possibly  
have wanted a woman over  
her “virile,” “handsome”  
husband (also a man in  
uniform). He can see a  
relationship between two peo-  
ple only in terms of male and  
female roles.  

“Fantasy played too large a  
part in it (their love-making),  
and the fantasy began before  
they lay clasped in each  
other’s arms. John had to be

for tightening muscles and  
losing inches. Even if there is  
fat that fat will become muscle  
and look slimmer. Using belly  
dancing is more interesting  
than using exercise like calis-  
thenics and yoga, because of  
the music aspect and the  
aspect of dance. In my classes  
I spend half the emphasis and  
time on belly dancing as  
exercise and about half on it as  
a dance form.  

I use belly dancing to become  
more aware of my body and to  
accept my body, to become  
closer and love myself more  
through it. I belly dance more  
for myself than for others.  

BMR: How is your approach  
different from that of many  
other belly dancers?  

Lia: I feel my belly dancing to  
be not so much an art as a  
budding branch on the tree of  
belly dancing and I don’t find  
many belly dancers into it in  
the same way.  

There are belly dancers in  
the night clubs out to entertain  
men and perform to get  
admiration from them. They  
really enjoy it and receive  
money for it too. There are  
those who get into it as a folk  
dance, ethnically and cultur-  
ally.  

I feel that I'm a different  
off-shoot from them. I dance  
for love and recognition, and  
as an ethnic dance too. In  
addition, I feel I can educate  
people about what it is—both  
historically and what it means  
to me emotionally.  

To me belly dancing is a way  
of giving life to myself. It’s a  
form of therapy for me to  
dance because I can be as wild  
as I want to be or as soft, as  
sad, as melancholy because  

belly dancing has all these  
aspects. I can experience all  
these feelings and allow my-  
self to act them out through  
the dance.  

I also have a strong rapport  
with the people. Many times  
when I dance with an audience  
I feel like I have them in my  
hands. Not that I own them  
but that I can give life and give  
them laughter and a meaning  
that can come through in an  
educational framework. I  
really like to involve them  
either with dancing with me  
afterwards or in giving an  
introductory background of  
myself and the meaning of  
belly dancing to me—telling  
them that I’m not there just  
for them to get turned on but  
that I’m actually asking them  
to watch my feet too and  
understand what it means to  
me. If they just want to get  
turned on by it that is OK,  
that's cool but it seems to me  
that they become richer when  
they can notice other spiritual  
aspects of it along with the  
passion.  

Just seeing performers with  
feelings and emotions puts  
them in a different light. They  
aren't entertainers anymore  
because you can get into their  
soul. I’m trying to get away  
from being a cold entertainer  
on an empty stage. I can still  
do it, but prefer that the  
audience get to know me, and  
I get to know them by their  
reactions, their facial expres-  
sions.  

Now I’m working more in  
coffeehouses, for groups and  
organizations of men and  
women, and even in a church.  
I want to be in a lot of  
educational settings so belly  
dancing will be accepted as an  
art form and people can learn  

from it.  

BMR: When belly dancing is  
brought up among some fem-  
inists it is dismissed as sexist.  
What kind of reactions have  
you come across?  

Lia: Belly dancing has been  
used to entertain men, to be  
accepted and loved by them. I  
can see how women who are  
turned off to entertaining men  
could be very upset by it  
because it is suggestive or  
seductive. But I feel very  
comfortable with being very  
suggestive and seductive and  
when I am that way ultimately  
I want to be suggestive and  
seductive with myself. If I can  
turn myself on, it doesn’t  
really matter what anybody  
else feels or thinks. Some  
women I know are threatened  
by belly dancing, feeling that  
if a belly dancer will dance she  
will want to turn on the men,  
but what happens is that a lot  
of women will also get turned  
on. I’ve had a lot of feedback  
from so-called straight  
women who were very much  
turned on by my belly dancing  
because it is a very sensual,  
sexy dance. You can't help  
but be turned on by it and  
that’s OK.  

I'd really like to share my  
feelings with women who are  
very threatened by belly dan-  
cing—many times they'll go to  
the other extreme and not be  
accepting of the sexuality of  
their bodies. What’s impor-  
tant is to be really accepting of  
what you can experience with  
your body.

13th Moon  

Ellen Marie Bisset, ed,  
paperback; $4.56 yr (2 issues)  
V.P. Vicconnell  

The 13th Moon is a literary  
magazine publishing work by  
women, “whoever we choose  
to be.” Editor Ellen Marie  
Bisset has used keen sight and  
sense of balance in coord-  
inating 13th Moon’s poetry,  
short stories, book reviews,  
and interviews. Guiding de-  
sign elements for the collec-  
tion include themes unre-  
stricted by any one  
philosophy, and an approach  
that is feminist only in a  
general sense (i.e., that the  
work is by women, entirely  
from the female point of view).  
Readers are offered a variety  
of techniques and styles, as  
well as the integration of many  
emphases in theme; forms of  
work alternate to produce an  
easy reading flow. The  
graphics are striking, unusual:  
at times like poem-pictures  
with their flowering woman-  
images.  

The poetry does not seem  
consistently strong; some  
poems are quite powerful and  
offer instant identification and  
revelation. Others are not so  
easily accessible. But overall,  
this poetry is a learning  
experience: here are new and  
unfamiliar themes, as well as  
approaches to themes I oppose  
but for the first time find  
acceptable in this verse.  

Alix Kates Shulman contri-  
butes an amazing short story  
(“A Girl and her Dog”), which  
is almost O. Henry-ian in its  
ending. The piece is sprinkled  
with subtle feminist innuendo  
but takes an abrupt turn about  
mid-story. The denouement is  
accented with near-poetic  
imagery: “Waves and oc-  
eans, suns and moons, bar-  
becues, bubbles, blisters,  
tongues and tides—what a  
rich banquet awaits the un-  
corrupted.”  

E.M. Bisset and June Rooks  
have written an excellent  
interview with Amelia  
Etlinger, who is a concrete  
poet. Not only do we get an  
education on the obscure art of  
concrete poetry, but Etlinger’s  
personality comes through  
with some delightful down-  
home woman-truths.  

The 13th Moon is yet another  
valiant effort by women in  
small presses to give our  
literature an audience. The  
work in this particular col-  
lection presents women on  
many levels, evolving in many  
cycles, just like that planet  
mentor, the moon, in all her  
phases.
