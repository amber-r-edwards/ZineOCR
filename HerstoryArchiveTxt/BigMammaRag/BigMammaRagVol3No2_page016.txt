MINNIE WOMAN

In 5th grade the boys went to the gym  
and the girls went to the library  

when the librarian opened the door  

I realized it was the first time  

I'd ever seen her smile  

Woman of white, the school nurse,  
introduced the film we were about to see  
on the facts of life  

which turned out to be a cartoon  

called the “Story of Menstruation”  
starring Minnie Mouse  

The mouse came on, her tail twitching, nervously,  
a 40 piece orchestra accompanied Minnie  

through what she called the “Beautiful Moment”  
and I twitched thinking about my anemia  

‘Everything on the screen was enlarged  

so we could understand it  

but the distortion confused me  

til I wasn’t certain which was the egg  

and which was the kotex.  

I had difficulty with Minnie’s language too  
which made it hard to know where to laugh  
and I tapped my shoes anticipating lunch  
while the mouse told all she knew  

about being a woman  

When it was over the nurse came out again  
and said the egg catchers were available  

in her office:  

never having anything wrong with me  

I'd never been to her office  

She asked if there were any questions  

and it was silent til the bell rang

A WOMAN WITH ME  

Rain on me with your mouth  
As soft and winning as my favorite Scotch  
I have known you many times before sweet love  
A woman nestled against my arm  
A woman twitching at the cheek for want of  
touching me  
A woman with her legs around me—  
clutched so tight and looking at me with her toes,  
Some small respite from the world of men  
A woman  
Her eyes as bright as sparklers  
Her loves as warm and different as a patchwork quilt  
Let me sew myself into your hair  
Comfort you and listen to our noses pressed together  
They sound like us  
They sound like women  
Together many times  
Before and now and sometime in the future  
She will always be a woman  
With me  
I will always have a woman  
With me

SONGS FOR DELIUS*  

When does blindness have its turn?  

When do eyes used to seeing stretch marks on stomachs  
isolated hairs on nipples  

pick out their benchmarks  

from black landscape  

behind closed eyelids  

and give hurt a chance at its own joy?  

When?  

Tell me about the when?  

It lurked in the corner  

then moved over the edge of today  

holding hands with a hammer in a sea of nails.  

Every time I threaten to play carpenter  

and rebuild tomorrow  

when comes and peeks over the roof  
and through the floor beams.  

Its grimace scares away the ark  

and washes me on shore with no people.  

My self is seeking the event of its birth.  
The fractured egg nebula  

can no longer hide  

in pubic hair  

or inward stare  

I am not too old to learn about the Phoenix.  

The I/me/you/us/them split is healing.  
The salve lies within my own juices  
and I am drinking at my own well  
prefiguring, configuring the celebration:  
a female rite  

which the whole universe is invited to witness.  
And I am writing the songs  

for I have also found my voice  

and will sing to you.  

“Delius was a blind composer who wrote music in the form  

of tone poems.
