I cannot honestly say  
this book changed my life.  
I changed my own life sever-  
al years ago with the help  
of a tribe of womyn warriors,  
which, perhaps, is as it  
should be.

book review

It did serve to give me  
the focal point I needed  
and the answer to the follow-  
ing question: "Why am I  
doing this?"

The question that emerges  
from reading this book is—

If we were here all the  
time, why do we still feel  
so invisible, why do we need  
this book to document the  
commitment of Third World  
feminists? Did someone doubt  
us before? Does the act of  
publishing a book by radical  
womyn of color validate our  
existence in a way that  
years of work does not? What  
are we now, that we weren't  
before the book?

Why do I need this book  
to carry around with me and  
prove to the "real feminists"  
that I exist?

What the fuck is going on  
here?

It is hard to take in all  
the messages and personali-  
ties of this book, possibly  
because I've been going to  
college this term, and after  
that bullshit anything else  
is a mindblower.

Even though the book  
makes no pretense of being  
comprehensive and including  
every woman of color's per-  

spective, in some ways, it  
says it all. The seeds are  
there.

Or the basics are there.  
It just needed collating.  
This book does not trigger  
a movement or suggest a new  
thought or way of life. It  
was all happening anyway.

But it validates those of  
us who work so hard and al-  
ways seem invisible anyway.  
Why is that?

It gave us the clarity  
there—the pain, the horror,  
the fear, the decision—  
take power, go on, be one,  
the vision is clear and  
strong. Now what the hell do  
we do with it?

I usually have some feel-

before. I've had love songs,  
hate mail, love letters,  
music dedications and a few  
flattering book reviews, but  
I never had a whole book  

by dozens of womyn written  
just for me.

Thank you. It isn't

ings of resentment whenever  
I read a womyn's book or  
publication that I'm not  
in. In this case, it wasn't  
necessary. I'm in this book,  
on every page, in every word  
and thought.

You know, I never had  
anybody write me a book be-

enough. We have to continue  
to work. Now I understand  
all the people I truly loved  
who couldn't accept it—all  
the womyn and lovers I felt  
rejected by.

"I love the goddam wom-  
an," I cried, again and a-  
gain. “How can she do this  
to me?"

Afterward

It's hard to accept this  
much love and truth and car-  
ing and commitment because  
it demands and deserves no  
less than a total lifetime  
commitment. If I accept  
the precepts of this book  
I have to say I'm not going  
to fuck up anymore and go  
off and try to forget "all  
this bullshit" every time  
the womyn's community drives  
me up a wall (like this  
year, like last year, like  
every year, etc.)

It means I have to stand  
up and say for myself, "Hey,  
baby, somebody just spoke  
to you. So what's your an-  
swer?"

This book requires a re-  
sponse, and I am afraid to  
fail again. I have been  
wanting someone to come a-  
long and make it easy for  
me, hold my hand and tell  
me, it's “okay."

Naturally, there are no  
takers, and it is definitely  
not "okay." This time. It  
has been time for a long  
time. It is long overdue  
for us to rise up and take  
power, not from others, but  
from ourselves and use the  
gifts we carry with us to  
create a better world.

It is time.

It has been time.

For a long time.

It was time before the  
book. It is time after the  
book.

There is no external re-  
assurance. I look to white  
women and lovers to tell me  
that it's safe and I can be  
myself now.

It is time. The hand of  
God will not come out of the  
clouds and give me the mes-  
sage on a silver platter.

You are ready when you  
say you are.

Right here, right now,  
writing this, it is my time.

I am ready now.

And it is time.

It has always been my  
time.

I never knew that before.

I know now.

I await.

I am.
