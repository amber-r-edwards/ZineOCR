‘national  
N.O.W.: Manufacturing The Illusion  

(ed. note: This article is  
reprinted from Work and Pay,  
an anti-authoritarian paper.)  

Terry Downs  

on the way to International  
Women's Day in Golden Gate  
park, I found myself feeling  
hopeful, because considering  
myself a feminist, I do feel  
a certain solidarity with  
other women who struggle against  
sexism and domination  
by men. At the same time, I  
feel alienated from many of  
these same women because of  
what the women's movement has  
developed into over the years.  
Watching the scene brought  
back thoughts of an anti-nuke,  
anti-draft, or any other ty-  
pical rally. A large crowd  
of people sat passively in  
seats listening to famous  
people (leaders of the wo-  
men's movement) tell us what  
we should do to liberate our-  
selves. All the speeches  
dealt with the fact that we  
should all go out into the  
workforce and demand the  
same right to be exploited  
as men have. Even Willie  
Brown told us to "dig deep  
into our pockets and wave our  
money into the air" (and de-  
posit it into the nearest  
collection can) to show the  
rest of the country "we mean  
business." And in fact he  
went on to say that we'll  
keep giving that money until  
we have equal rights. Appar-  
ently the idea is to buy our  
freedom. What a contradic-  
tion! The cry of "ERA!" was  
made the slogan of the day  
and the National Organiza-  
tion of Women (NOW) is the  
group we must all join to  
force passage of the bill.  

Behind the spectators were  
all the groups who could in  
some way connect themselves  
to the women's movement. Lit-  
erature was plentiful, giving  
this or that group's ideology  
on “women's role in society”  
and the platform they had  
for obtaining their ideas.  
More than just literature  
were all the groups selling  
things. Buttons, tee-shirts,  
books, clothes, food, etc.  
bombarded me as I walked  
through it. Women's libera-  
tion has become quite a pro-  
fitable business.  

And then I ran across a ta-  
ble set up to recruit women  
to "join the force behind  
the star"—the police force.

The absurdity of it made me  
speechless. The idea of hav-  
ing more women cops as part  
of the answer to the end of  
domination by men (so that we  
could be dominated by women)  
is ridiculous. I wanted to  
smash up their table (as well  
as others) and burn them to  
the ground.  

Sunday, I went down to the  
Women's Building to see what  
was going on there. I had  
written a leaflet expressing  
similar feelings to this ar-  
ticle and during the break I  
began handing it out to peo-  
ple. I was quickly spotted  
by a "hostess" (now that mon-  
itor has become such a no-no  
word, they revert to a sexist  
word) and was told that I  
couldn't hand out leaflets.  

I protested, and she brought  
over the director who repea-  
ted the same thing. I couldn't  
believe they were going  
to keep me from letting my  
views be known. These same  
women who complain that only  
in a “women's space" without  
domination by men can we  
freely express ourselves, not  
letting me express myself.  
What the director told me  
was that I hadn't been part  
of an organization who helped  
sponsor the event. So out the  
door I went when I decided  
to challenge her authority  
and not allow her to dominate  
me.  

The women's movement today  
has lost any semblance of  
anti-authoritarianism it had  
15 years ago. As a result of  
sexist practice within the  
new left in the late '60s  
and early '70s, women rebell-  
ed and many opted for less  
hierarchical forms of organi-  
zation. The idea was to end  
domination by men, but also  
women. They were critical of  
the “system" as well as know-  
ing the pitfalls of working-  
within it to obtain a differ-  
ent society. But nowadays,  
many groups jump right into  
the bureaucracy in an effort  
to gain power. Be they in the  
traditional business world  
or the alternative “women's  
culture", little is being  
done to confront domination.  
In fact, once many women find  
themselves in a comfortable  
position, they are quite  
happy to either stay put or  
go after a position of more  
money and power.  

Women, already in the cor-  
porate business world, acting  
as managers, executives, etc.  
are constantly complaining  
of how difficult it was for  
them to climb the corporate  
ladder. There's a ton of  
books out on how to deal with  
the sexist boss (and still  
get ahead), how to manage  
your money (for those who  
have a lot of it), how to be  
a good executive (make the  
employees think you care  
about them), and generally  
how to survive in an aliena-  
ted, sexist, racist world if  
power and prestige are what  
you want.  

Remember poor Mary Cunning-  
ham—kicked out of Bendix  
Corp. for allegedly sleeping  
with her boss and thus moving  
up the corporate ladder too  
quickly. After much publicity  
in the press, which brought  
anger from "feminists" who  
cried, "DISCRIMINATION!",  
she's now a vice-president  
for Seagram's. What is she  
doing there? Campaigning for  
all the thousands of women  
workers who don't have a say  
in the company? You can bet  
your life the answer is "NO"  
(as if it matters anyway).  
She's a corporate executive,  
and like all corporate exec's  
her job is to increase pro-  
fits for the company and to  
ensure the exploitation of  
the workforce.  

For those women who are more  
“democratically” minded and  
think that electoral politics  
will bring liberation to wo-  
men, I can only point out  
the futility of that. People  
like Indira Gandhi and Mar-  
garet Thatcher have never  
worked for women's rights.  

In fact, as they have become  
leaders of governments, they  
don't even identify themsel-  
ves as women. They impose  
austerity programs onto their  
inflation-ridden countries  
until supposedly the economy  
is able to pick itself up  
again. This translates into  
most people getting less and  
less so that business takes  
more and more.  

In the U.S.A. liberal and  
leftist groups want what Bel-  
la Abzug stated at the Day in  
the Park. "We've got to make  
up our minds that we are go-  
ing to make this country  
work!" And the Coalition of  
Labor Union Women (CLUW) has  
objectives that call for  
“strengthening the role and  
participation of women in the  
unions, encouraging women to  
engage in the political pro-  
cesses of the nation, seeking  
affirmative action, equality  
of pay, promotion, hiring,  
and job classification." It's  
only natural then that people  
like Bella Abzug, the CLUW,  
NOW, and other such groups  
hail the ERA as the answer to  
our liberation.  

But looked at for what it  
stands for, the ERA, can easily  
be called the Empty Rights  
Amendment. Empty because the  
only change that can be made  
through passage and enforce-  
ment of it is that more women  
will attain higher positions  
in business and government,  
(Maybe we can even have a wo-  
man president!!) But the ba-  
sic relationships between  
people won't change at all.  
Representation by women is  
equally dominating as repre-  
sentation by men. Perhaps  
women will fight for equality  
of wages, etc., etc., but the  
fact remains that women (and  
men) will still be working at  
boring and useless jobs. They  
will still take orders from  
a boss, make flawed products,  
or shuffle meaningless docu-  
ments around.  

There will still be the con-  
sumerist nature that pervades  
this society. And commodities  
will still be the replacement  
for any real human contact be-  
tween people.  

Sure, companies can adver-  
tise their products for the  
"liberated" woman instead of  
for the "little housewife".  
The billboard with the woman  
next to a bottle of brandy  
typifies this. “I stand by my  
brandy," she says.  

Another illusion being manu-  
factured, at least in the  
Bay Area, as well as else-  
where, is the recruitment of  
women into the police force.  
Women's Day in the Park was  
patrolled by women cops  
(working under the orders of  
a male in charge). The illu-  
sion here is thinking that  
we'll be better protected  
because we'll have more repre-  
sentation on the police force.  
But, were anyone to "get out  
of hand" during the rally,  
they surely would have been  
quickly suppressed, arrested  
and hauled away. Women may  
become cops under the auspi-  
ces of protecting other women  
from harassment, rape, etc.,  
but the real nature of the  
police force is to control  
people's behavior. And women  
cops will have to arrest oth-  
er women for "anti-social  
behavior" at some point in  
their career. A recent inci-  
dent in a bar on Haight Street  
found a woman and man team  
harassing, arresting, and  
beating up people for no rea-  
son (except to “clean up the  
Haight"). This is a most  
sickening display of "femi-  
nism".  

On the other side of the  
coin are the groups who re-  
cognize that society is domi-  
nated by power and money, but  
choose only to challenge a  
part of it and ignore the  
rest. They blame patriarchy  
as the one and only reason  
for the position of women to-  
day. Most feel that elimina-  
ting domination by men elimi-  
nates all our problems.  

These groups are usually col-  
lectives of women who run  
business "by and for women".  
There is certainly a need  
of space for women who don't  
want to be hounded and har-  
assed by men or who simply  
want to be with other women.  

But by their very nature as  
a "business" continues the  
commodity relationship be-  
tween women and goods. Valen-  
cia Street in San Francisco  
has become a small haven of  
women-owned (singly or col-  
lectively) businesses. And  
what do we have there?  
There's a bar, bookshop, law  
office, beauty salon, etc.  
The only difference between  
these and any other bar, book  
shop, law office, etc. is  
that they are run "by and  
for women". Yet, when we're  
having a drink in a woman's  
bar, aren't we still paying  
money to buy a commodity that  
we think makes us more per-  
sonable, more attractive to  
others? And is the fact that  
a woman cuts, styles, and  
curls our hair any more liber-  
ating than a man doing it?  
We are still buying a commo-  
dity to appeal to people.  
And more often than not, the  
worker is exploited twice as  
much because she is working  
in a "woman-owned" business  
and forced to take lower  
wages so the place can stay  
in competition with other  
places. Doesn't the woman  
masseuse relieve tensions  
and stresses from a messed-up  
society through massage  
rather than confront the  
causes? Is the woman lawyer  
going to force the judicial  
system to decide all matters  
"fairly" any more than a  
male leftist lawyer? The real  
question here is why are  
these people in court anyway?  
N.O.W. can at least say a  
woman cop arrested them.  

Now, that's liberation???  

MS Magazine: The Sell-Out Of Feminism  

(Reprinted from Rouge, an  
Australian Feminist newspaper)  

--when you walk into a news-  
agent, and are faced with  
rows of women's weeklies,  
women's days, a magazine  
titled MS. stands out like  
a cooling breeze.  

--you open it to look at the  
contents, and your heart  
goes, baboom! here it is  
something to keep you alive  
and sane in the peak hour,  
something stimulating for  
hecate's sake.  

--you buy it, catch the bus.  
contents page, ah, the self-  
indulgence of choosing an  
article to read. But some-  
thing catches your eye. It's  
the opposing advertisement,  
reading, "I don't worry about  
tampon accidents!" And you  
think, what are they talking  
about. And when you follow  
the full page glossy advert.,  
something inside of you is  
saying I've been ripped off.  
Because they're advertising  
Playtex tampons, which come  
in a uniquely devised, non-  
degradable plastic pack. A  
tampon that's insulting to  
women, a tampon devised so  
that women won't have to  
actually touch their own  
vaginas, a tampon that  
reinforces all those boring  
tales about women's men-  
struation being dirty and  
unclean.  

--now Spare Rib is a magazine  
you don't often find at your  
local news agent but I order  
it especially because it's a  
women's liberation magazine  
from overseas, and I want to  
know what's going on. Spare  
Rib is always filled with  
articles of interest and  
importance to feminists. In  
this month's edition, I've  
just read an article slamming  
Playtex tampons—for the fact  
that they are non-degradable,  
but more importantly, that they  
lead to increased uterine  
infections. They have been  
linked with the gradual release  
of information on tampon caused  
toxic deaths in women.  

--so where does a so-called  
feminist magazine, like MS.,  
get off in having full page  
Playtex ads?  

--O.K. don't be so biased,  
yeah, never slam something  
until you know what it's all  
about. So, now I skip thru’  
the magazine, looking for an  
overall picture of it. And  
the next page that hits my  
eye, is one advertising Fem-  
iron—it's a pill that will  
supplement your vitamins  
while you're dieting.  

--well damn it!  

--so many liberated women to-  
day, are still locked into  
the dictation of society  
which says that women can be  
liberated but they must be  
slim and good-looking if they  
want to get anywhere. Yeah,  
and I was confused about my  
own body image until I read  
Fat Is A Feminist Issue, and  
other literature that relates  
to our feelings about our  
bodies. That's when I started  
to see that our self-image is  
something that has always  
been controlled by the patri-  
archy.  

--Well, the advertisement  

on the next page began, "what  
have I got against wrinkles?  
New Moisture Whip Moisturi-  
zer!)  

-Laurie White/Big Mama Rag  

~-consumer advertising is  
based on the market of women.  
Women who are taught by so-  
ciety that they must conform  
to certain pre-determined  
standards, i.e. they must be  
slim, have small breasts,  
nice legs etc., small details  
which increase and sustain  
women's bondage to a system  
which exploits and degrades  
them.  

--letters started circulating  
between rouge collectives  

maybe six months ago, and dis-  
cussion was, how do we commu-  
nicate our feminism without  
alienating women who don't  

as yet, see their oppression  
in every aspect of this so-  
ciety? Well, how can I effec-  
tively tell women that MS.  
Magazine only serves to rein-  
force the capitalist submis-  
sion of women?  

--the next advertisement I  

see says,  

"Leaves Skin soft and silky.  
For Pretty hands and feet."  
--who's kidding who?  

--I work as a domestic two  
mornings a week. It's not much  
but the money on top of the  
dole keeps me alive. Yet my  
hands come up in red rashes  
and break out in dermatitis.  
I'm lucky! When I worked in  
the factory full time, I had  
dermatitis full time. Nearly  
all the women working there  
had it as well, but it was an  
industrial disease, and no-  
thing could be done about it.  
Occupational disease—and  
this magazine is talking  
about pretty hands and feet.  

=-I reach the page that's  
filled with this, "I didn't  
know 0.B. could prevent  
stains." It says, "While no  
tampon can guarantee you'll  
never have an accident......"  

=-I give up!
