DYKE Folds

Dear Women,

It is with a mixture of sadness,
relief and anger that we announce
the folding of DYKE, A Quarterly.
When we conceived of DYKE four years
ago we decided that we would give it
a few years to become self-supporting.
We have been publishing now for
three years and the magazine still
does not support itself. Clearly,
we lack a large enough audience.

Tomato Publications, Ltd. published
six issues of DYKE, a magazine
of essays, interviews, history, art
and politics. Our first two issues
featured among other articles, the
highly controversial C.L.I.T. statements,
a major Lesbian separatist
analysis. Issue #3 presented a portfolio
of Alice Austen, a Lesbian
photographer from the turn of the
century. Issue #4 was a beautiful
four-color poster by Debbie Dreshler
which came along with a small magazinelette.
Issue #5 featured essays
about ethnic Lesbians, also a history
of Lesbian hoboes during the
depression, and an analysis of trans
sexuals in the women's movement.

Issue #6 featured articles about Les-
bians and animals, and a symposium
on Lesbian separatism.

We are proud of our work. It was
innovative, readable, provocative
and beautiful. The essays were highly
personal, based on the feminist
technique of consciousness raising.
We chose and wrote articles that
would give the reader a frame of re-
ference: who was the author, how did
she come to her ideas, what was the
relevance of the subject to her own
life and to Lesbians in general.

We believe that any subject can be
relevant and interesting to a Lesbian
audience when it is discussed.

Correction

In the last issue in the article
"New Sterilization Guidelines" that
federal money could not be used for
vasectomies. According to Rocky Mt.
Planned Parenthood the article was
incorrect on this point. Federal
money may be used for vasectomies.
All other guidelines in the article
are correct.

COLLECTIVE

Velvet Hammer May
Reopen

Dear Sisters,

I am very upset over the closing
of the Velvet Hammer. It is extremely
important that we support our
feminist groups (bar, bookstore,
newspaper etc.). Sisters: Unite:
Don't let these vital sources of
feminist communication and energy
die! We need them, they need us.

In struggle,

Jan

Editors Note: There is still hope
for the Velvet Hammer. If any woman
is interested in seeing that it
does reopen and stays a women's bar
and gathering place call Anna at
471-3783. She is trying to get the
money together to reopen, she has
some money but needs more.

Which Ads Go In?
Dear Sisters,

In your December 1975 issue (vol 3A
No 12 pg 4) you wrote--"One of the
responsibilities of a radical feminist
is to follow through on the political
stances with which she identifies..."
You used this statement to refuse an
ad from PORPOISE PRESS for their book
THE RIPENING FIG, which you had re-
viewed negatively (much in the same
way as the negative review of JOY OF
LESBIAN etc.). The ad you refused
(along with the pompous statements)
from PORPOISE PRESS was (by our esti-
mation) about a 12 dollar ad--the
one from Simon and Schuster (by your
reckoning) was for 100 dollars--
what price radical feminism? (We
estimate about 88 bucks).

If you've changed your policy on
accepting ads for things you consider
detrimental to our movement would you
consider apologizing to PORPOISE
PRESS for past refusal--or have you
only changed your policy for ads that
bring in what you consider enough
profit to forget “your responsibil-
ities..."

In the struggle,
