Music Festival

Sisters,

I could not let Barbara  
Gagliardi's article (West  
Coast Women's Music Festival)  
go without comment. It is in-  
sensitive and damn right  
cruel to feel like you have  
to criticize all women's ev-  
ents to keep them in line. It  
is an echo of the past. I have  
seen burn out a lot of sisters  
and needlessly hurt others.  
It is called trashing. These  
two thoughts are separate.

As for her views on the  
festival, not one nice thing  
was said about the efforts of  
different entertainers. Work-  
shops on Chile, El Salvador,  
lesbian rights, oh yes, on  
individualism, something peo-  
ple like Barbara refuse to  
give credit for. I realize a  
lot was wrong at the  
festival, and the views of  

all women should be respected.

The timing was very inappro-  
priate. A demonstration did-  
n't solve anything. An ad-  
dress was given towards help-  
ing next year's festival. More  
will be solved this way. I  
hope the committee is not  
made of women like Barbara.  
Little will be accomplished.

In the past year I have  
heard of women production  
companies staging fewer con-  
certs because of lack of mo-  
ney or losing money. What is  
the answer, a lower sliding  
scale to completely shut them  
down?

A possible boycott of next  
year's, a boycott worked on a  
East Coast festival. I'm  
told every year is supposed  
to be the last for Mich-  
igan's festival.

It seems to be impossible  
for some women to have a  
good time.

Big Mama Rag I am having a  
problem with anyway because  
of the tendency towards  
trashing. If there is so much  
wrong with other women, why  
be a Feminist? I don't object  
to criticism, but I want  
fairness. None of your head-  
lines have anything about  
love for other women.

BMR in Prison

Greetings BMR Sisters,

Would you please put me on  
your mailing list for a free  
prisoner's subscription to  
Big Mama Rag?

I read a fair amount of  
women's and alternative news-  
papers, and BMR is by and far  
the best. You cover both na-  
tional and international  
struggles as well as the lo-  
cal and personal issues, and  
do so in a way that provokes  
thought and further study.  
You raise questions that need  
to be asked, and present  
their analysis in a style  
that's really understandable.  
That makes BMR an especially  
useful tool in educating  
other prisoners and stimula-  
ting discussion among those  
who are not familiar with  
"politics" and are turned off  
by the super-rhetorical style  
of so many papers.

Your coverage of the strug-  
gles of the Puerto Rican pri-

Good News

Dear BMR,

I have been reading your  
newsjournal 4 mos. now and  
I would like to offer some  
criticism.

Your paper is full of news  
--yes, but it is mostly bad  
news or statements of ef-  
forts.

Why not have an article  
on some female accomplish-  
ments like the fact that  
history has been made with  
the acceptance of a woman  
on the Supreme Court of the  
U.S.? I consider that no  
small victory, as she will  
have say-so on future laws  
affecting all of us. Maybe  
some readers would be inte-  
rested in knowing more about  
her struggle "up through  
the ranks."

I look forward to your  
journal each month—keep  
up the good work!

Sincerely,

Mary J

CwC Homophobia

Dear Editor:

I am writing with regard  
to an article in your Novem-  
ber issue concerning Colora-  
do Women's College. It was  
determined by Sage Produc-  
tions that CWC's President  
Sherry Manning advocated a  
policy against the Gay and  
Lesbian movements which, a-  
side from being homophobic  
was outright discriminatory.  
As a graduate of CWC (1980)  
and a Lesbian, I would like  
to address this issue.

Homophobia has been grow-  
ing at CWC. It is unclear  
whether this is a result of the  
increasing conservatism sweep-  
ing across the country, or  
if it is an attempt by Pres-  
ident Manning to weed out  
"undesirables" from her cam-  
pus. In the four years of my  
acquaintance with the col-  
lege, I have seen the atmos-  
phere change from one in  
which Lesbians were openly  
accepted as part of the stu-  
dent body (and faculty), to  

-Liberation News Service

the present, wherein Les-  
bians have been warned to  
keep their relationships off  
campus, and freshmen were  
denied the right to have  
Lesbians assigned as their  
"Big Sisters."

Presently, approximately  
10% of the on-campus students  
are Lesbians as well as an  
unknown number of off-campus  
students. In an interview  
with Carol Lease of the  
GLCCC, Manning claimed that  
"there are no Lesbians at  
CWC." By ignoring our very  
existence and thereby nega-  
ting the contributions Les-  
bians have made to the col-  
lege, Manning does all of us  
a great injustice as women  
and as Lesbians. Apparently  
Manning has forgotten that  
Lesbians have been among  
some of CWC's most ardent  
supporters, and have always  
been among the Student Lead-  
ers; having served in vari-  
ous offices ranging from  
Student Body President to  
Residence Hall Assistant.

Manning feels that she is  
carrying out "the mission of  
the college." Seemingly, one  
is to infer by this that she  
means refusing to recognize  
a large and important part  
of the CWC population (as  
well as the general popula-  
tion), thereby maintaining a  
protected, heterosexual envi-  
ronment free from such unho-  
ly values as Lesbianism.

In actuality, what Manning  
is advocating is a fascist  
state wherein she dictates  
the suppression of opposi-  
tion as well as trying to  
maintain the social regimen-  
tation of the student body.

It is unconscionable that,  
in light of CWC's deep fi-  
nancial woes, Manning would  
concentrate her efforts on  
lashing out at Lesbianism,  
which can only result in al-  
ienating people from a  
school in desperate need of  
students. By her failure to  
recognize the existence,  
support and value of the  
Lesbians at CWC, Manning is  
succeeding in ostracizing a  
large part of the community  
as well as hastening the  
demise of what was once a  
fine learning institution.
