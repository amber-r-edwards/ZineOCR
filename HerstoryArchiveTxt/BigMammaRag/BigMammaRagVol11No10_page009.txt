Women In The Philippines Are Fighting, Educating And Organizing For Revolution

(Reprinted from Spare Rib.)

The following article was written by Marilee Karl, an
Italian woman who works in ISIS (Women's International
Information and Communication Service).

In it she looks at the growth of a distinctly feminist
movement in the Philippines. In some ways this can only
be a rudimentary view of the situation there, as it does
not go into the extent of American domination over social
and cultural life in the Philippines, or the way cultural
imperialism has affected women. The article also doesn't
go into the nature of Moslem guerrilla activities in the
two islands of Mindanao and Sulu, where women's participa-
tion and adherence to the veil and fundamentalist Islamic
rules have been left unquestioned.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

The Philippines is a republic made up of more than 7,000
islands, much of which is mountainous and densely
forested. The only Christian country in Asia, it is
predominately Roman Catholic. Approximately 18% of the
49 million people are national minority Filipinos,
including 5 million Muslims in the Southern islands of
Mindanao and Sulu.

In 1521 Magellan claimed the islands (already a
flourishing trading center and developed culture) for
the Spanish king. Over the next 400 years the Spaniards
developed a colonial and feudal society (in which at
least 200 revolts broke out). At the end of the 19th
century an independence movement grew and overthrew the
Spanish regime. In its death throes, Spanish colon-
ialism sold the Philippines to the USA. The Americans
set out to crush the nationalist movement; there followed
a long war at the cost of 1 million Filipino lives.
The war established the US as a colonial power in
Asia and the Philippines remains a stronghold of US
interests up to the present. In 1946 formal independence
was granted but this was more nominal than real.
US business retains special privileges, including trade
concessions and ownership of banks and industries. The
US also maintains 20 military bases in the country.

Although nominally a democracy, the Philippines in
fact has been controlled by about 200 wealthy families,
who act as agents of foreign capitalists, who enjoy a
virtual monopoly of the country's resources.

A worsening situation for the Filipino people led,
by the 60's, to a broad-based opposition, including slum-
dwellers, students, peasants, workers and priests,
communists and nationalist businessmen all working open-
ly in unity. The breadth and size of opposition present-
ed a real threat to US interests and the ruling clique.

So on September 21, 1972, Ferdinand Marcos, then the
elected president, declared martial law. Suspending
the Constitution and dissolving Congress, he moved
swiftly to close all channels of dissent.

Under various Presidential decrees, Marcos:

- closed down universities and imprisoned thousands of
students and professors;

- banned labor strikes and forbade union organizing;

- shut down 18 daily newspapers in Manila and instituted
tight control over the remaining media;

- transferred from civil to military courts all crimes
against the public order which range from vagrancy
to treason;

- suspended the writ of habeas corpus (protection
against illegal imprisonment);

- centralized the police into one national force;

- set aside the Supreme Court decision and repealed the
laws curbing foreign ownership of land, business,
and banks;

- and passed a new constitution legitimizing his
"Constitutional Authoritarianism".

"We make the integrated
circuits for calculators,
digital watches, computers

in the Philippines. We
are sitting on the floor
of her family's tiny two
room shack with four
other young Filipino women
workers and labor organ-
izers in the textile and
electronics factories of
Manila. They are also a
part of a new militant
women's movement with a
feminist perspective that
is growing in this country.

To reach Celia's house
we had to make our way
through twisting, muddy
pathways bordered by ram-
shackle houses made out of
scrap wood, cardboard
cartons and tin drums.

Celia lives in one of the
many sprawling slum squatter
areas which have grown up
on the margins of the cities
and industrial zones in the
country. We left our mud
covered sandals at the door
of this poor but spotlessly
clean and neat house. It

is a hot December evening.
"Good thing the rainy
season is just about over or
we'd be tramping through
mud up to our knees," jokes
Beth, who works in a near-
by textile factory.

"We don't enjoy living
on a garbage heap and open
sewers," says Celia, more
seriously. "My family came
here ten years ago from the
south. We used to be farm-
ers. Our family cultivated
the land for generations.
Then one day some men from
the city came with a piece
of paper claiming the land
was theirs. There wasn't
a thing we could do because
we didn't have a legal deed
to the land. The same
thing happened to the other
families in the village.
Then the land was sold to a
big coconut company. Some
of the villagers got jobs
on the plantation, but there
just weren't enough jobs
for everybody, so we came to
the city. There's no other
place we can afford to live."

This is a pattern which
has repeated itself all over
the country, causing mass-
ive migration from rural to
urban areas: giant multi-
national agribusiness corp-
orations have been busily
buying up vast tracts of the
most fertile lands and put-
ting them under cultivation
of a single crop, such as
coconuts, bananas, or sugar
for exports to our tables
in the richer countries of
the world. Vast numbers of
small farmers have found
themselves without either
land or work. Subsistence
farming has sharply declined
and with it food for the
people to eat. Sometimes
whole families, like Celia's
pick up and move to the
cities. Others, like Beth's
send their daughters who
are the most likely to find
jobs in the multinational
textile and electronics
industries in the cities and
export-processing zones.

"The government now has
this great plan for the
"beautification" of Manila,"
says Sally. "That means
they want to bulldoze our
houses and get us out of here.
But believe me, our people
will fight before they leave.
There's no place to go. We
can't afford the government's
so-called ‘low cost housing’.
And we won't go to one of
their model resettlement
areas—not that there's
enough for even a fraction
of all the 170,000 people
living here. Most of them
are like concentration camps,
and they are so far away,
we could never afford the
cost of transportation to
get to work."

Beth explained,
a room with seven other
girls near the factory.

The bosses say we don't
need to earn much because
we are single. It's not
true! My family works on a
sugar plantation in Negros,
but there is only work part
of the year. Without the
money I send home, they
wouldn't have enough to
eat. I wish I could send
more so that my younger
brothers and sisters could
stay in school."

Young people with more
education can migrate abroad.
The streets of Rome and
Milan are filled with young
Filipino women, most of
them trained teachers, nur-
ses or secretaries. Here they
can only find work as
domestics, but they still
earn more than they could
at home.

Sally, Beth and Celia
are part of a new labor
force taking shape in coun-
tries like the Philippines
in Southeast Asia. Since
the late 1960's these
countries have pursued a
World Bank promoted model
of development based on ex-
port oriented industrializ-
ation. Countries in the
region compete to attract
the investments of US,
Japanese and European
transnational corporations,
offering them many incent-
ives such as generous tax
concessions, exemptions
from import and export
duties, subsidized utilities,
lax health and safety stan-
dards and, especially, a
large, cheap reserve of
labor. This consists main-
ly of young, unmarried
women—90% of all workers
in electronics and 75% of
those in textile are women.
The managers and supervisors
are men, but women are
preferred on the production
lines because they can be
paid lower wages than men.

The five young women
workers here in this room
with me agree that their
main problem is money—the
impossibility of earning
enough to lead a decent
life. But it's not their
only problem. They complain
of bad working conditions
and health hazards; dust
fibers and noise in textiles,
toxic fumes and eye strain
from long hours of peering
through microscopes in
electronics. They also
complain that sexual har-
assment is one of the job
hazards women face. Minda,
a former worker in a rubber
sandal factory, and now a
full-time organizer, says
that this is often very
subtle, but it can be
blatant too: "What sometimes
happens is that the boss
will lay off a worker and
then call her into his
office and say she can have
the job back in return for
sexual favors."

"Almost all the women
in our factories are in-
experienced in labor or-
ganizing," says Celia. "It's
very hard for us to break
out of our upbringing to
be obedient and subordinate
to men."

“That's beginning to
change," laughs Minda. "I
would have loved to see
the look on President Marcos'
face when 10,000 workers
walked off their jobs in the
Bataan Export Processing
Zone last June. There's
never been a general strike
in a free trade zone before.
And three-quarters of the
workers there are women. So
much for the myth of the
docile woman worker."

The four-day general
strike of workers in 23
different factories took
the government and multi-
national corporations by
surprise. It began with only
200 workers from one factory
who walked off the job to
protest bad working condi-
tions, forced overtime and
an increased workload. For
several weeks these workers
resisted a back to work
order and attempts of the
police to break their picket.
Finally the police intervened
with force, brutally
attacking the workers:
Several were injured and 54
were arrested. When the
dust cleared, only seven
very courageous women re-
mained with their placards
on the picket line. It

seemed as if the strike was
crushed.

But news spread quickly
from factory to factory in
the zone. Within a few hours
3,000 workers surged out of
their factories in protest
and solidarity. By the
third day, over 10,000
workers—about three-quarters
of the workforce in the
zone—had joined the sympathy
strike. Before it was over,

“Marcos is calling our
unions ‘subversive' now. It's
very hard. A lot of workers
are afraid. Our families
are afraid we will be arrest-
ed if we continue to organ-
ize,” says Minda.

Yet they continue. In
December 1982, women labor
organizations from all over
the Philippines met together
for the first time to dis-
cuss the particular problems
of women workers. "We had
some problems with the male
labor organizations about
this," says Zennie. They
wanted to know why only
women? We ask them why they
feel threatened and insecure.
We tell them they should
encourage us. Our struggle
as workers is united—men
and women—of course. But
as women we have special
problems. We want to meet
together to discuss the his-
torical and sociological
reasons for women's secondary
place in society. We want to
organize ourselves to make
sure that the unions include
women's issues on the agenda
and in the courses for work-
ers. The whole issue of child
care hasn't even been touched
yet by the unions. It's

and I separated after our
child was born. We were both
full-time labor organizers.
All he would do is organize.
I had to do everything for
the baby. We separated over
this.”

Before we parted, Minda,
Beth, Celia, Zennie and
Sally explained to me their
plans of setting up a center
for women workers in Europe.
They said that they would
like to establish links
with women workers in other
countries and asked for
support and solidarity for
their organizing, strikes
and detained workers.

I had first met Minda in a
Women's center in Metro-Manila
—a hotbed of activity
packed into two rooms. Women
