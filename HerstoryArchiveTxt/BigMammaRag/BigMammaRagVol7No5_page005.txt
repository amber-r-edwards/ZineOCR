Freedom Fighters Free?

Puerto Rican independence fighter
Lolita Lebron may go free after 25
years if the US and Cuba come to agree-
ment. Lebron is serving a 75 year sen-
tence in a US prison after participating
in the 1954 attack on the US House
of Representatives in protest against
the “Law 600" which declared Puerto
Rico a “commonwealth” under jurisdic-
tion of the US. Fidel Castro said he
would release four men held as US spies
in Cuba if the US government would set
free Lebron and the three other Puerto
Rican political prisoners serving time
for the 1954 incident. The Justice De-

partment has confirmed that clemency
for Lebron and her fellow freedom fighters
is being considered.

Boston Murders

On April 27th, a 31 year old nurse's
aide was found strangled in her apart-
ment, becoming the eighth black woman
murdered in the South End/Roxbury/Dor-
chester area of Boston since January.
The next day over 500 women gathered
in front of the State House to protest
the murders and demand the city be
made a safe place for women to live.

At the rally before the march, dem-
onstrators learned that a ninth woman
had been found slain in Dorchester.

One woman said, "This is the most dev-
astating period for being a black woman
I've ever experienced." Another speaker
pointed out that women are the ones who
have organized against the recent vio-
lence; she said that black, Latina and
white women are uniting in this city

and that "we don't have to fight alone."

Blame-the-Victim Game

Rutgers University police have been
forced by women's groups to cease
their practice of issuing "warning
cards" to women they feel are in
dangerous situations. The cards read:
"If I were a rapist, you'd be in
trouble." Pointing out the dangerous
mentality of blaming women for the
violence against them, women's groups
complained that “the university po-
lice seem so powerless and now they
are placing the blame on us as women
for their incompetence on campus."

Ageless Exploitation

An estimated 500,000 girls and boys
under the age of 16 are presently in-
volved in the multi-million dollar
racket of child prostitution, accord-
ing to an official of a New York coun-
seling agency. A common denominator
among child prostitutes is often early
sexual abuse by parents in the home.

Sugar and Spice

A health screening test for school
children in Evanston, Illinois has
found that more sixth grade girls are
physically out of shape than are boys;
approximately 30% of girls and 5% of
boys were found to be out of shape.
Girls also had the highest cholesterol
levels in their blood, the highest
blood pressure readings and the high-
est incidence of being overweight.

Kate Carey of the Consumers Health
Group, which sponsored the test, said
that its results raise serious ques-
tions about the kind of activities
and diets that are encouraged for
girls.

Too Many Jobs

A woman lost her job with Haringey
Council because she stayed home to look
after her children when their school
was closed due to a strike. Her re-
quest to bring the children to work
with her was refused and after a few
days she received a letter of dismis-
sal. Ironically, she worked for the
same council which ordered the schools
to be closed.

Dumping Daycare

Senator Alan Cranston has cancelled
further Senate consideration of his
child care legislation, which would
have authorized up to $90 million to
help working mothers in lower income
brackets pay some of the costs of day
care. Cranston said, "The mood of the
96th Congress and of the American pub-
lic in general is very negative toward
proposals for new federal programs at
this time regardless of social need and
cost effectiveness."

Better Justice

The Justice Department is trying to
settle out of court a lawsuit brought
by a former woman job applicant who was
denied a law clerk position because she
admitted she was living with a man who
was not her legal husband. A US Dis-
trict Court Judge refused last month to
dismiss the case and criticized the
Department for stating in a 1977 legal
brief that cohabitation between unmar-
ried people was a sign of low moral
character. The woman, who is no longer
interested in the position, says she
will continue to fight the legal battle
in order to "make sure it doesn't hap-
pen to others."

Frisco Fobia

Peg's Place, a "movement" bar fre-
quented by lesbian feminists in San
Francisco, was recently the scene of
an attack by drunken off-duty police-
men who were told by doorkeeper Shir-
ley Levine to stay out. The men entered
the bar, hit Levine in the head
and chest, wrestled bar owner Linda
Symaco to the floor in a headlock,
and harassed bar patrons. Officer
Michael Kelly received cuts about the
head from a pool cue. Two of the po-
licemen were indicted on assault char-
ges.

This incident follows several others
in the last few months which have led
to charges that police feel free to
harass lesbians and gay men since the
murders of Mayor Moscone and gay Sup-
ervisor Harvey Milk. The Police Chief
denies there has been a policy change,
however, new mayor Dianne Feinstein
revealed her reservations about gays
in the March issue of Ladies Home
Journal, stating, "The right of an in-
dividual to live as he or she chooses
can become offensive."

For the Birds

President Carter announced last
month the appointment of Lynda Bird
Johnson Robb to replace ousted Bella
Abzug as head of his committee on
women. Administrative spokesmen said
the daughter of former President John-
son was the president's choice because
of her lack of ties with organized
feminist groups. Arlie Scott from NOW
described the appointment as made sim-
ply to enhance the president's chances
for reelection.

The appointment of non-feminist
Lynda Bird Robb came with a change in
name of the committee to the Presi-
dent's Advisory Committee on Women and
included a reduction in size from 40
to 30 members. More than half the ori-
ginal members resigned in protest
over Abzug's firing.

(One of the newly appointed members
is lesbian activist Jill Schropp.)

Going Hungry

The Food Stamp Program (FSP) will be
drastically cut unless Congress acts
immediately. The Food Stamp Act of
1977 imposed a “cap" that limits the
amount of funds that can be spent on
food stamps by the Congress in any
given year. This spending ceiling now
threatens the entire program because
it is clear that the total FSP spend-
ing will exceed the cap the next two
years, resulting in a cutback in bene-
fits to all participating households.
Everyone is urged to pressure Congress
right now to remove the food stamp cap
to prevent the taking of 1.3 billion
dollars directly out of the pockets of food
stamp participants.

Birth Control Blues

Contraceptives Unlimited, Ireland's
first contraceptive shop, opened in
Dublin recently in order to sell con-
traceptives openly to expose the ridicu-
lous laws around the provision of
birth control devices. Profits made
will go to a test case they are fight-
ing in which contraceptives they were
importing were seized by Irish custom
officials. In Ireland, it is illegal to
sell contraceptives. Contraceptives
Unlimited is demanding free legal
birth control financed by the govern-
ment.

Also, being debated this legislative
session is a family planning bill in
which only “families" would be elig-
ible for contraceptives; doctors of-
fering birth control to single people
would face fines of up to 500 pounds
and/or six months imprisonment.
