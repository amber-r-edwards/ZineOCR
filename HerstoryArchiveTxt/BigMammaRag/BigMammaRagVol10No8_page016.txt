National Conference Against Repression

jury resisters refuse to co-
operate in any way with the
U.S. "justice" system. This
includes refusing to give
handwriting samples, hair
samples, cooperating in a
line-up, or in any way recog-
nizing that this imperialist
U.S. government has any legi-
timacy.

I also attended the North
American anti-imperialist
meeting. We discussed the
role of whites, especially
white women, since we were
the vast majority of white
people at the conference, in
supporting national libera-
tion movements (NLM). Much of
the discussion centered on
the women’s workshop (which
I had attended) and racism
in the women's liberation
movement, as evidenced by us
continuing to discuss abor-
tion when it had been clearly
stated that abortion is not
a priority issue for Puerto
Rican, Black or Chicano/Mexi-
cano women. This racism (in
the workshop and in the wo-
men's movement as a whole)
led to the resolution that
the white women's movement
not be collaborators in the
abortion of Third World wo-
men, because they become
partners in genocide of
Third World people.

The white women's movement
has historically been racist
and unsupportive of national
liberation movements. "Take
Back the Night" marches, for
example, though rooted in
women's right to be free from
rape, harassment, et al, have
often collaborated with the
police and the state to op-
press Third World communities.

My criticisms of the conf-
erence stem from my back-
ground of work in the white
women's liberation movement
(WLM). So I did become defen-
sive at what I felt to be
blanket condemnations of the
WLM. Yes, a lot of so-called
feminist groups are bourgeois,
co-opted, trying to make it
in the capitalist system and
collaborating with police
and the state in some ways.
On the other hand, much of
the WLM is anti-imperialist
and supportive of NIM.

Because I see the struggles
against patriarchy and imper-
ialism as equally important
and vital, I was frustrated
with the stance that imper-
ialism is the main contradic-
tion. It is true that we can-
not rid ourselves of the pat-
riarchy under imperialism,
but I felt that parts of my
identity as a woman and esp-
ecially as a lesbian were not
addressed at the conference.
I didn't feel as though
there was space at the conf-
erence for critical discus-
sion of the politics and stra-
tegy of NLM, and I don't even
know if I think there should
have been. Being white, I
certainly can't tell a Black,
Puerto Rican or Chicano/Mexi-
cano person how to wage their
struggle. My frustration at
the conference also stems
from a desire to have my pol-
itics be articulated there,
and it is white supremacist
of me to think my politics
should be represented at a
conference for NIM. I went to
the conference to support the
politics and strategy of NLM,
not to again be racist by
forcing my politics on Black,
Chicano/Mexicano or Puerto
Rican people. I learned a
lot and do feel connections
were made for me. I give my
unconditional support (though
obviously not uncritical!)
to national liberation move-
ments, and especially to the
women in those movements.
CONTINUA LA LUCHA!
FREE THE LAND!

This article is my own per-
spective on the questions
raised at the Repression on
Women workshop at the Color-
ado Conference Against Repré-
ssion, especially around the
resolution against the white
women's movement collabora-
ting in the abortion of Chi-
cana/Mexicana, Puerto Rican or
New Afrikan women because
they become "partners in gen-
ocide of Third World people"
and the resolution around
shared revolutionary child-
care.

I see some contradiction
between National Liberation
Movements and the Women's
Liberation Movement, which
at the workshop focused on
the issue of abortion. It is
important to be clear about
this contradiction, which is
why I'm trying to present
both sides of the dialectic
in this article. It's impor-
tant because there is a need
for unity, and some basis for
unity, between anti-imperial-
ist forces such as the Puerto

Rican, New Afrikan and Chica-
no/Mexicano groups at the
conference, and anti-imper-
ialist feminists who were
also at the conference.

At the workshop, it was
raised that white feminists
were not "taking leadership
from Third World women." This
was said after the lengthy
discussion on abortion, when
women were still arguing
about if/how/why or why not
abortion was a priority for
the liberation of women of
color. That is a valid crit-
icism; there are many areas
where we as feminists benefit
from taking leadership from
women in national liberation;
for example, on dealing with
repression by the military
and police, armed struggle,
keeping a revolutionary per-
spective, etc. I and other
feminists do agree with the
basis of the conference;
imperialism is an enemy of ours,
women will not be free until
armed struggle clears the
ground of the strangling sys-
tem of oppression, and that
National Liberation Movements
are now the major way in
which imperialism is losing
ground. In other words, peo-
ple's war works. And we need
to support that and learn
from that. ("support" can
mean anything from coming
out in print for armed strug-
gle and liberation wars to
raising funds to being an
aboveground political group
defending a clandestine one,
to being an actual combatant.
Which level of support femi-
nists give will depend on
individual politics and pri-
orities, and how well contra-
dictions are resolved in a
principled way.)

There are also areas where
I for one cannot take leader-
ship; there are still ques-
tions unresolved to me, much
that I am not clear on and
worried about. At the women's
workshop at the conference,
abortion was a focus. Ques-
tions that I would like ans-
wers to: does "collaboration"
in abortion refer only to or-
ganizations that push abor-
tion on a target population
like Los Angeles’ Black comm-
unity? I agree that this is
genocidal and something fem-
inists should be aware of
and protest against. Or does
"collaboration" refer to in-
dividual, woman-to-woman help
when a woman of color has al-
ready decided, for whatever
reasons, not to have a child?

Is it the position of the
National Liberation Movements
at the conference that, while
it is a valid choice for a
white woman to have an abor-
tion, for a woman who is New
Afrikan, Puerto Rican or Chi-
cana/Mexicana, abortion is not
a choice to be supported?

I feel the resolution was
not clear on these points.
That is why I voted against
it.

Because I have a long his-
tory, politically and per-
sonally, of supporting the
safe access of women to abor-
tion, including the right of
poor women, and women op-
pressed also by racism, this
issue is emotional for me. I
have been through horrors
with women, friends of mine,
white, Black and Chicana, and
offered what emotional and
material support I could at
the time. I have also been
supported in my hard times,
and I worry about the future.
I know it will cause even
more suffering when abortion
becomes illegal unless we take
steps now to form support net-
works.

Hearing the rage of
Native, Black, Chicana and
Puerto Rican women at being
robbed of the choice to bear
healthy kids is more than
enough to inspire anger, sym-
pathy and action to stop U.S.
government "population con-
trol" practices.

Hearing that rage and the
conclusion, "abortion is gen-
ocide" from such women is
enough to keep me from ever
pushing abortion as this
great thing that's going to
free women in these nations.
It is not enough, however, to
make me say flat out that
abortion is wrong or counter-
revolutionary, as I have
heard other people say.

I am finally coming to be-
lieve abortion cannot be a
demand from a capitalist
system, because it backfires
as racist. But abortion is a
legitimate need women at
times have. So is childcare
a need, and decent housing,
water, food, health care,
community support, and so on.

A friend who is struggling
to raise her baby on hardly
any income put it very well:
"Not being able to afford to
raise a kid is a lousy reason
to have an abortion. Change
the conditions. Change the
conditions."

By the process of synthe-
sizing my own experiences
with listening to the issues
other women (in feminist
groups and national libera-
tion movements) raise, I am
getting closer to forming a
strategy for "supporting all
women's choices."

The tactics listed below
are how I see resolving the
contradictions in practice.

I hear women in Third World
and Native American nations
saying, "You want to support
our choices. Support our
movements, because it is
through the fight for self-
determination and socialism
for our nations that we have
real choices."

So:

We (feminist anti-imperial-
ists): Keep supporting Na-
tional Liberation Movements
(by my earlier definition of

Lori Bradford and Liz Lewis

We believe that feminist
politics must act for the to-
tal liberation of all women.
Feminism then, our political
analysis of who the enemy is,
must be defined, and must act
in opposition to white supre-
macy/patriarchy/imperialism.
Our strategies and tactics
must evolve from an under-
standing and political analy-
sis of how and why these sys-
tems maintain the exploita-
tion and oppression of all
women and children and men.
Although these three systems/
ideologies are separate and
distinct, we understand
through the connections be-
tween racism, sexism, ageism,
anti-Semitism and classism
that these ideologies must
be confronted simultaneously
for the feminist liberation
of all women.

Ideologies, i.e. sets of
ideas and objectives, func-
tion to influence a whole
group or national culture and
defend the interests of
classes or groups in strug-
gle. White supremacy demands
a relation of inequality,
subordination, and the as-
sumed inferiority of one
group of humanity to another.
Patriarchy, manifested in all
of society, dictates the na-
tural, in-born authority and
superiority of men. Living
under imperialism means that
the interests of the ruling
class of a few nations de-
termine the rights and future
of peoples of all nations.
Patriarchy/Imperialism/White
Supremacy are inseparable as
they maintain the oppression
of all. They must be over-
turned. Revolution is not our
goal, but rather our means of
attaining our goal...power or
self-determination, power to
restructure society. We don't
believe in women's revolution,
but rather in people's war
and people's revolution, in
which feminism could/would/
should be a shared ideology
.--Feminism that is anti-
Imperialist, organizing a-
gainst White Supremacy and
planning strategies and tac-
tics from a feminist/economic
analysis of Patriarchy. Femi-
nists support for National
Liberation Movements both in
and outside U.S. borders is
a necessary extension of our
politics. National Liberation
Movements directly confront
Imperialism, confronting a
shared enemy. We came to the
conference to listen and
learn about issues from other
movements. These ideas,
brought back into the femi-
nist movement, must serve to
broaden our definitions of
and the issues of feminism.

Because we define patriar-
chy as our enemy, as part
of the source of our oppression
as women, our strategy is to
organize as women in an auto-
nomous feminist movement. We
feel that it is essential
that women connect in support,
and common anger in order to
build a movement that is a
threat to the present power
structure and a powerful
participant in creating some-
thing new.

We organize around issues
that affect us - we organize
to provide for ourselves ba-
sic survival needs: food,
shelter, control over our
bodies, power in our lives,
controlling those decisions
that affect our lives. And,
as we organize and get in
touch with our anger, and
build a sense of power and
support, we need to constant-
ly be watching and re-examin-
ing the sources of the pro-
blems. We start opening our
eyes to the reality of those
forms of oppression, violence
that are leveled at others,
and that are not as obvious
at first to us.

And providing for our own
basic survival needs is not
enough anymore - we have to
recognize how often it hap-
pens that different oppressed
groups are manipulated to be
in competition with each o-
ther - that we are kept divi-
ded. So we need to broaden
our idea of revolution. That
we don't liberate one portion
of the people without libera-
ting everyone. We need to ed-
ucate ourselves to the issues
and realities of those with
other experiences. And through
educating ourselves, and lis-
tening, and being willing to
change - we hope to build
trust and respect between
movements to work toward com-
mon goals. That work needs
to be done on many different
fronts, on many different
levels.

It is important that we do
not develop theory separate
from practice. We recognize
that the way we work with each
other needs to reflect our
ideals. We choose to work in
