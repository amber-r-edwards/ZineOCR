‘New Prison Labor Scheme Busts Unions

(Edited from articles by
Diane Feinberg in Workers
World’ and Gay Community News)

Supreme Court Chief Justice
Warren E. Burger is urging
the converting of U.S. pri-
sons into "factories with
fences," in a speech prepared
for delivery at the Univer-
sity of Nebraska in Lincoln.

Burger motivated the con-
version of prisons into fac-
tories and factories into
prisons; the repeal of laws
that limit prison industry;
removal of any barriers to
"free exchange of commodi-
ties" produced by forced pri-
son labor; and a campaign to
try to persuade the trade
union bureaucracy not to re-
sist this pernicious design.

Burger was, in fact, arti-
culating a program of expan-
sion of the millions of doll-
ars in profit made annually
from prison labor. He is ad-
vocating the dramatic in-
creasing of prison industry
on a huge scale. This began
in earnest in the form of na-
tional legislation after it
was introduced in the Senate
this summer.

Burger outlined the move
already underfoot to throw
the weight of the economic
crisis even more on the backs
of those hardest-hit. The job-
less, especially Black, Latin,
Asian and Native youth, are
forced into prison in stag-
geringly increasing numbers.
They work as slaves. Almost
every bit of all the wealth
they produce is appropriated
by privately owned industry
or the government and state
apparatus and the so-called
Department of Corrections.

In Florida now, prisoner-
laborers are forced to build
the very cells that will im-
prison them, and are forced
to grow their own food on
prison plots like feudal
serfs.

This forced, low-paid labor
plan not only enslaves the
prisoners but threatens the
wages of labor in general.
Last summer, the Caduhey Meat
Packing Plant in Phoenix,
Arizona, closed down and
threw out some 400 union
workers. It reopened 60 days
later with prisoner laborers
making just about minimum
wage instead of the union
rate of $10.84 per hour the
workers had fought for.

The Arizona joint venture

is part of a federal program
whereby federal Law Enforce-
ment Administration can ex-
empt "state projects" from
two federal laws banning in-
terstate commerce in prisoner-
made commodities and banning
the sale of the products to
the federal government. These
two bans were instituted be-
ginning in the 1920s to stop
prisoner exploitation, such
as leasing prisoners to pri-
vate industry and plantation
labor and the retention of
the wages and the paychecks
by the prison administration.
Lewie Anderson, international

vice-president of the 1.3
million member United Food
and Commercial Workers inter-
national explained, "This
situation is a straight union-
busting tactic with the goal
of reaching profits by cheap
wages and exploiting the
convicts."

Those who labor behind
walls with gun turrets, who
are at the whim of sadists,
racist and sexist prison
guards with clubs, mace and
guns, are from the class
which has nothing to sell to
survive except their ability
to labor. Corporations are

attempting to institute a
system whereby the jobless
would produce surplus value
stolen by the bosses while
the prison masters take their
cut from the theft of these
wages.

This very system creates
more joblessness among work-
ers who are not in prison
and serves to drive down
average wages of those still
working. All who labor, in
prison and out, are threat- *
ened, and must fight against
the exploitation and impri-
sonment of the working class
and oppressed.

Statement From Yellow Thunder Camp

Yellow Thunder Camp is a
permanent community being
built on 800 acres of U.S.
National Forest land in the
Black Hills of South Dakota.
Lakota Indians have been liv-
ing on this land, their own,

resistance

according to terms of the
1868 Ft. Laramie Treaty,
since April of 1981.

The U.S. Government is
attempting to open this area,
the sacred Paha Sapa, to
mining - of coal, iron ore,
uranium and lumber. The Sup-
reme Court recently rejected
a demand by the Oglala Sioux
that the federal government
return this land to them. The
case will probably wind up
before Congress.

The following is a letter
from Yellow Thunder Camp to
the U.S. Government.

Hau, mitaku oyasin.
(Hello my relatives)

First, I want you to know
and the world to know, that
the people of Yellow Thunder
Camp know you have already
contracted with a lumber cor-
poration to very nearly clear
cut the entire forest within
our 800 acre claim. Further-
more, in order to accommodate
the logging trucks and other
heavy equipment necessary to
destroy the entire environ-
ment of our claim area, major
new roads will have to be
widened and straightened.
Also, we are aware of your
plans to turn our present
campsite at Lake Lamont (for-
merly known as Lake Victoria)
into a gravel quarry. A gra-
vel quarry that you fully
intend to allow in order to
repeat the continuing expan-
sion of the clear cutting
logging operations to make
way for strip mines!

Out of respect for your
culture the Lakota Nation has

historically abided by the

terms of the 1868 Ft. Laramie
Treaty and your Constitution
with all of its lesser laws.
The Lakota Nation recognizes
that the United States of
America is a nation of laws
and we have also acknowledged
that laws are needed for law-
less people. Therefore, we,
at Yellow Thunder Camp, have
chosen your lesser laws in
order to force the United
States of America to live up
to its higher laws... its
very own Constitution.

My relatives, I am here
tonight to inform the United
States Government that we
have acted in good faith out

of respect for our relatives'
vision:

Yellow Thunder Camp is my
home, it is the home of my
unborn generations. I will
defend the home of my family
with my blood.

From this moment forward,
Yellow Thunder Camp will only
recognize the two highest
laws that protect us: The
1868 Ft. Laramie Treaty and
the Constitution of the Uni-
ted States of America.

Allow me to end with this
quote from my ancestor...

I am neither cynical enough
to stop fighting,

Nor idealistic enough to
leave this fight to others.

You have pushed me into
this corner,

Now you must face me as I
fight for my Grandchildren.

If I lose, they will never
be born.

The Hills are at my back
and protect me

As with many who came
before,

Here I make my stand.

Yellow Thunder Camp is
requesting donations of med-
ical supplies, as they will
be opening a health clinic.
Especially needed are air
splints, sutures, medical
flashlights, blankets and
many other things. Send
supplies or the cash to buy
them to:
