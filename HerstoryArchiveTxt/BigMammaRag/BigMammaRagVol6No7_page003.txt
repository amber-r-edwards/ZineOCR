Controversial  

Dear BMR,  

I am writing to protest your que-  
asiness about having published Mar-  
ina Franchild's excellent “dust  
What Can Feminists Afford?" You  
criticize yourselves for "sloppy  
process in not taking time to dis-  
cuss the article more," and vow to  
“tighten up our process all around,  
by making political discussions by  
everyone on the collective a pre-  
requisite to publishing any contro-  
versial articles.” (BMR; where we'  
re at; May 1978) I object because  
establishing a double standard for  
controversial vs. noncontroversial  
articles can only result in suppres-  
sing in women's movement media, it  
diminishes in the movement itself--  
to our detriment.  

I do not object to making all pub-  
lication decisions depend on collec-  
tive discussion. That's an internal  
collective policy matter, and none  
of my business. But as a member of  
the movement, I do have a right to  
protest this policy when it is app-  
lied only to "controversial" material  
--because its result will be to sup-  
press such material. The reason is  
that, as you yourselves point out,  
there is always a "mad rush to get  
a paper out on time." Collective  
discussions take time. If you have  
to go through a lengthy collective  
process only for controversial ar-  
ticles, and you're already pressed  
for time, you would have to be mas-  
ochists to consider publishing con-  
troversial articles very often.  
Result: you won't. No one would,  
under those conditions. Especially  
since your reward for doing it is  
only to have some of the controversy  
generated by “controversial” articles  
fall on your already-exhausted heads.  
A double standard which charges you  
more for publishing controversial  
articles than non-controversial articles can

ber of controversial articles you  
publish.  

This decrease can worsen over time.  
In my experience, as collective mem-  
bers become achingly familiar with  
the cost of handling controversial  
material, they begin to twitch as  
soon as they see manuscripts which  
even hint at controversy. A mere  
tinge of a conflict about p.7,  
footnote 4, is enough reason to con-  
sign an ms to the rejection stack.  
And without anyone's meaning to be  
obstructive, individual collective  
members come to have veto power over  
all publication decisions. After  
all, one member's objection means a  
controversy; best to reject the ms  
and move on. What begins as coll-  
ective discussions about controvers-  
ial material, ends in a situation  
where collective unanimity is a pre-  
requisite to publishing anything.  
Controversy disappears.  

(I am omitting other reasons why  
an ms gets defined as "controversial"  
or "non-controversial” prior to pub-  
lication, like the movement status of  
the people it attacks. The higher  
the movement status of its targets, the  
more likely it is to be labelled  
"controversial," and suppressed.  
Similarly, the lower the movement  
status of its targets, the more like-  
ly it is to be labelled "noncontrover-  
sial," and published. To encourage  
such a situation by double standards  
for handling “controversial” and "non-  
controversial" material is unjust, to  
say the least.)  

I think that although open conflict  
is unpleasant, it is generally bene-  
ficial to movements. A movement  
without lots of open fights is either  
a dead movement completely controlled  
by its high-status members. For un-  
less the movement is dead, it encom-  

passes conflicting positions. If we  

these positions are not openly clash-  
ing, that merely means the conflict

is covert; the people with the domi-  
nant view have succeeded in censoring  
their critics. It is Franchild's  
position, and mine, that “people with  
the dominant view" tend to have domi-  
nant social resources--to be white,  
middle or upper class, heterosexual,  
Protestant, etc. Thus, a movement  
without a lot of open fights is usual-  
ly a movement ruled by exactly those  
social groups which already benefit  
from the system the movement was  
meant to attack.  

I cannot believe that BMR favors  
this kind of situation. And yet, if  
all women's movement media adopted  
the double-standard decision structure  
BMR now contemplates, the result  
could only be to suppress published  
dissent, and thus movement dissent  
itself. Censoring controversy, in  
the end, means supporting the hege-  
mony of high-status groups within  
the movement. BMR indicated its  
anti-elitist position by publishing  
Franchild's article in the first  
place.  

You now used that article as a jus-  
tification for changing your posi-  
tion. But subjecting "controversial"  
manuscripts to a more tortuous pub-  
lication process than “noncontro-  
versial" manuscripts amounts to ex-  
actly that.  

Franchild was extraordinarily cour-  
ageous to write her attack on move-  
ment "names." You were extraordinarily  
courageous to publish it. Please don't  
raise the ante of courage required to  
write and publish attacks on the  
movement status quo by subjecting  
"controversy" to pre-publication  
censorship.

Sorry, BMR,  

but your attempt to get off the  
hook on the Marina Franchild article  
on Daughters, Inc. press is inadequate  
to say the least. You have every  
obligation to read any article  
as destructive, as trashy and trash-  
ing as this one is, before publica-  
tion. As feminists, we have some  
obligation to not destroy everything  
that other women do. When you grant  
so much space to something this de-  
structive, all your other articles  
become of questionable validity. We  
wonder whether you have anything of  
consequence to print. Don't you  
think Daughters had the intelligence  
to go over the questions raised,  
again and again, as all of us do?  
It does not seem worthwhile to  
deal with specifics in the article,  

It would be sadly ironic if

the latter being so shoddy. But it  
does seem clear that Daughters has  
published the best books they could  
from the manuscripts submitted--  
the shame of many feminist authors  
being that for one excuse or another  
(we will reach a wider audience, we  
will make more money), they have  
chosen to publish in the men's  
houses. It is our weakness that  
women continue to betray each other  
for men and their structures...And  
you, too, BMR. Did you think it  
useful that Franchild misprinted and  
misquoted the Times article to rid-  
icule the efforts of Daughters? It  
is as though the most superficial  
socialist-feminist rhetoric had  
been tied together and Daughters’  
name injected as the oppressor. How  
can you, who manage a women’s  
business yourself, print such  
statements?

things to be said about the Franchild  
article, but that she misprinted and  
misquoted the Times article is not  
one of them.)  

Dear Big Mama Rag:  

Congratulations for publishing  
Franchild's excellent article. It is  
high time that public spokeswomen for  
the women's movement began to be held  
accountable for their statements.  

However, I am confused and angered  
by your Where We're At. Either you  
are saying that you disclaim any sup-  
port for the article because you  
published it without really knowing  
what was in it, or you are disclaim-  
ing any support for the article  
because some members of the collective
