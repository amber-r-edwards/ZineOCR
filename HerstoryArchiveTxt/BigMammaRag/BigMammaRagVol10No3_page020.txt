"THE ENEMY KNOWS THAT WOMEN ARE FIGHTING.

THEY KNOW THAT ALL THE

PAIN WE HAVE SUFFERED IS BEING DIRECTED INTO ALL THE HATRED THEY

DESERVE, AND IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT THE MOST BRUTAL AND CRUEL
TORTURE IS DIRECTED AGAINST WOMEN, BECAUSE THEY CANNOT UNDERSTAND
THAT WOMEN HAVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND A CONSEQUENT

PRACTICE."
