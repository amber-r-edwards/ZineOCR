WOMEN’S  
RESOURCES  

Big Mama Rag wishes to thank the following women for helping  
make the Women’s Resources section a reality:  

Tori Ayers   Julie Robinson  
Susan Binder   Price Ryan  
Sandy Sonn   Sneak Taylor  
Mary Jane Gasdik   Vicki Ziegler  
Elissa Meyer  

As a special feature section of our June/July 1976 double  
issue, Big Mama Rag has decided to print a listing of resources  
available to women in the Denver/Boulder area. It is our hope  
that this directory will prove valuable to local women; all of  
whom have a variety of needs and interests. We also hope it  
will prove valuable to any women planning to vacation in the  
area this summer, or who are considering possibly moving to  
the area at some time. We also hope the listing will prove  
interesting to women who simply have a curiosity about the  
goings-on in other feminist communities. At any rate, BMR  
hopes you find it valuable, interesting and enjoyable. If we  
have missed any area feminist projects in the listing (which we  
probably have) we hope you forgive us and let us know about  
your organization.
