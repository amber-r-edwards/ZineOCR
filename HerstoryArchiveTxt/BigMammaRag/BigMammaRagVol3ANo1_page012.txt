San Diego Feminists

The Restaurant Is a Capricorn

“Don't let it fall on me!”

In San Diego women have
created an alternative to the bar
scene by turning a corner office

into a women’s coffeehouse —
Las Hermanas.

The coffeehouse was started
by a group of about 20 com-
mitted women and a small initial
investment. The women worked

photos by Helen McKenna for two months on completely

rebuilding the interior of the
building — constructing walls,
installing sinks, doing plumbing
and wiring and making fur-
niture. It opened in December
and is now a focal point for
women’s activities in San Diego.
Films, poetry readings, video-
tape presentations and music
are some of the activities offered
as well as children’s programs.
Part of the way Las Hermanas
supports itself is through a small
restaurant which is part of the
coffeehouse. The vegetarian
menu features good, cheap,
healthy food. The Amazon gift
Special is delicious. Michelle Penny digging up floor.
One reason that the center (“I must not chew gum in school.”)
was established was to be an
alternative to bars and to be a
place for women to relax, plan
activities and be with each other
in a hassle-free environment.
According to one organizer, the
coffeehouse is a ‘space for
women to come to and not have
to deal with men. If men stray in,
they are told that it is a women’s
social center and they leave.
This is a space for men not to be
in. Women and children are
welcome. There are places for
men to go and be alone, but
there aren't for women. We have
to create that space and we did!"

“Our own coffeehouse — Las Hermanas. I’ve got to rest and
think. —
