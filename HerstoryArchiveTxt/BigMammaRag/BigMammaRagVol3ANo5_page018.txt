Shock Treatment Victims Testify Against Bill

Silent too long

time now to speak the
truth...

to reveal atrocities we
have known

to demand accounting
from false healers

in brown shirts under
white jackets...

“An End to Silence”
by Leonard Roy Frank

Angry former victims of forced
shock treatment testified in
California legislature hearings
early in May against the practice
of electroconvulsive therapy
(ECT). The ECT victims spoke up
against a bill which would
permit shock treatment and psy-
chosurgery without consent
when doctors decide it is ap-

propriate.
People representing the Net-
work Against Psychiatric

Assault (NAPA), the National
Organization of Women, the
American Civil Liberties Union,
the Association for Humanistic
Psychology, and other
organizations gave personal
testimony describing the treat-
ment as terrifying and destruc-
tive.

“We consider forced ECT
closely analogous to sexual rape
— an unethical, un-
constitutional and unjustifiable
intrusion into another person's
body and mind,” explained
NAPA. “Neither sexual rape nor
electrical rape should be legal
even if it is said to benefit the
victim, as many rapists argue.

“Psychiatrists used to spin
people in revolving chairs until
they were nauseous and un-
bearably dizzy. Psychiatrists
used to flog people with whips
and stimulate various parts of
the body with nonconvulsive
electricity. In both cases
~~ people’s behavior appeared to
improve and psychiatrists swore

divided or argue the correctness
of Jane Alpert's actions, but to
begin the process of making the
conditions of imprisonment visi-
ble.

Women in prison are obvious
examples of how free women in
this society are now political.
Some entree into the actual
prisons must be available so
women know the nature of their
treatment, their conditions.
Some entree into the judicial
processes that got them there
must be made visible. And most
of all, women across this country
must be visible as potent forces
for change.

There has yet to be any
national action by women
which will force the media to
re-evaluate the actual interment
women are facing. By our
peaceful but forceful vigilance
on that day and by whatever
other actions women find har-

monious with the feminine princi-

ple to counter the male principle,
we can begin some inroad, some
viable paths toward a deprison-

ed state. — Sandia

Colorado Women’s
Festival
Dear Folks,

Now that summer is here, the
Second Annual Colorado
Women's Festival is just around
the corner. This year’s festival
should be even more exciting
than the last, but we need your
fantastic ideas and energy. What
would you like to see happen?

This festival belongs to all the
women in Colorado, and
everybody’s suggestions are
welcome as to particular
speakers, booths, organized ac-
tivities, etc. Now is everybody's
chance to plan for what will
happen in August.

We hope many women will
participate as much as they can
and want. If anyone has
suggestions for what they would
like the festival to be, or talents,
skills and interests in art, drama,

they had an effective treatment.
Shock therapy is simply more of
the same only worse and more
destructive.”

Another bill — one designed to
guarantee a patient's right to
refuse ECT and psychosurgery
— was passed by the California
Assembly in 1974 and was to
become law on January 1, 1975.
But as a result of a suit filed by
two psychiatrists, the San Diego
Superior Court issued a restrain-
ing order against enforcement of
the law, alleging that the bill
infringes on a patient's right to
“freedom of treatment.”

California psychiatrists who
use ECT were particularly
worried about the penalties
provision of the bill, under which
a doctor found in violation could
be subject to a “civil penalty of
not more than $10,000 for each
violation and/or revocation of
license.”

In its lead story of February 5,
“Psychiatric News,” the official
paper of the American Psy-
chiatric Association (APA) at-
tacked the bill.

Since then, another weaker
bill has been proposed in the
legislature. It makes no provi-
sion that ECT be a last resort or
that the treatment be critically
needed for the welfare of the
patient. While it does propose a
review board for patients deter-
mined incapable of giving con-
sent, doctors would be fined only
$5,000 for violations, and would
not have their licenses revoked.

NAPA would support this
weaker bill only if amended to
prohibit forced shock treatment
and an end to the use of ECT on
minors altogether. “It's easy for
minors to be victimized under
coercive conditions of in-
stitutions so it’s hard for them to
give true consent. Voluntary
patients must also be protected
against force and misinforma-

music, politics, (wo)manage-

ment, food, and events within

the women’s community. Let's get

together June 16th to plan a
terrific festival!

Dear Friends:

Thank you for printing a blurb
about us in your April issue.
However, there are several
points we would like to clear up
and hope that you will print them
in a future issue.

First of all, we have been
finding out that a lot of people do
not know what microfilm is. So it
should be indicated that
microfilms are photographic
reproductions, and that from the

negatives, custom-made orders
can be produced for libraries
everywhere, and that people can
see the collections on microfilm
if their libraries order them.

Second, in order to get the
microfilms of our collections into
their libraries, people must show
a demand for the material, so
everyone must call, write, and
petition their libraries to order
the microfilms. Also, if we do not
raise the $30,000 in standing
orders from libraries for the
Women & Law microfilm, we
will not receive the $10,000 in
revenue sharing funds that are
needed to complete the project.
So far only 15 of the 40 reels of
the Law collection have been
produced, and if we do not meet
the challenge, the remaining
files will have to be sent to the
University of Wyoming Archives
un-microfilmed.

Third, the urgency of the
Revenue Sharing Challenge is

tion. These people are not in a
typical medical situation — they
are always exposed to incarcera-
tion, indefinite confinement and
are frequently drugged.”

ECT, the practice of running

70-150 volts of electricity
through a person's skull, has
been in use since the 1930s.
But even Dr. Ugo Cerletti, believ-
ed to be the first doctor to
administer the treatment, is said
to have had some doubts about
the technique.

NAPA charges that many
psychiatrists misinform people
about the risks of shock treat-
ment, including brain damage
and retrograde amnesia (the
inability to remember things

not mentioned in the blurb. We
must meet the challenge by the
end of June 1975. That is very
important. The unfinished (i.e.,
un-microfilmed) files are on
Politics and Employment, which
are of course very topical, and it
would be a shame if they were
not microfilmed.

Would you please print these
points in your next newsletter?

In later issues, we would
appreciate it if you could print
blurbs about our Health
microfilm (which is already safely
published on microfilm), and the
1975 Supplement project for our
FEMALE ARTISTS PAST AND
PRESENT.

Thank you very much, and we
look forward to seeing future
issues of BIG MAMA RAG.

Sincerely,

Women, Where

Are You?
Dear BMR Staff and Readers,

I’ll preface this by saying that I
am speaking only for myself.
Womanchief Productions was
founded as a non-profit
organization dedicated to bring-
ing to Denver the newly on-the-
road feminist musicians. We
would like to be able to guarantee
them at least their expenses to
and from here.

I rarely get angry, but 15
people (99% of them very late)
showed up to hear a fine singer
from San Francisco. I know BMR
has a larger staff than that — let
alone its circulation. Where
were these strong voices for
support? 

I would hate to think of the
feminist movement in Denver as
just empty words — lots of cheap
talk and no action.

If that support doesn’t show
itself, those women will have to
bypass Denver, or worse yet —
not be able to travel due to

before treatment), and perma-
nent brain damage.

“In fact,” writes NAPA,
“shock is very much like psy-
chosurgery and should be con-
sidered in the same category.

Both procedures involve the
destruction of brain tissue and
both procedures result in the
serious permanent debilitation
of the patient.”

In addition to the possibility of
brain damage, NAPA says there
is no scientific evidence that
shock treatment is even effec-
tive. Both of the only two con-
trolled studies done on ECT
found no difference between
actual ECT and simulated ECT,
strongly supporting the thesis

Denver's critical location. That
would be a sad loss.

Come on — I know you can do it.

Let The Sun Shine

Through
Hello Chocolate,

Received my first copy of 3/15
BMR and not only did the sun
begin to shine but the ice began
to melt. I read and laughed and
cried. I guess you could say I
awoke again to the world around
me. I've contacted a few sisters

Women...

writing of this book. I feel it is a
spiritual work. Not because I
agree with everything they have
to say. That is not the point. The
point is that something happens
to you when you get as high
sexually as they are talking
about. What happens is tantra:
sexual intimacy that substantially
changes your understanding
of “how it all is.” This is what
Nomadic Sisters must basically
be about; their publication
reflects it. Looking at the picture
of them in the front of the book,
what I see is love. Listening to
their words, this is what I hear,
“if people can't laugh and talk
and be close in bed, I don’t see
how there’s any hope for other
aspects of their relationship.”

Loving Women was written
and published by four women,
Nomadic Sisters. It is printed as
a paperback in high quality stock
and is complete with il-
lustrations, of which this graphic
is one. They are done by a fifth
woman, Victoria Hammond. It is

that the placebo effect (the
power of suggestion), in addition
to the impact of fear, is an
important factor in the behavior
changes resulting from shock.

One of NAPA's most effective
weapons in the fight against ECT
is a newspaper story from the
San Francisco Examiner head-
lined “It Didn't Shock the
Patients, But It Shook the Doc-
tor.” The article tells the story of
an ECT machine in England that
was apparently not working for
over two years. However,
hospital officials were unaware
of its breakdown and continued
giving the patients “shock”
treatment. The article concluded
that “the patients seemed to
benefit as much from being put
to sleep in preparation for treat-
ment as other patients do from
the treatment itself.”

NAPA says this proves its
point that ECT is a bogus treat-
ment—with little or no therapeutic
value.

“Shock needs to be seen on a
continuum and not isolated off
as a singular atrocity by an
ordinarily good and benevolent
institution,” NAPA points out.
“Whether the patient is a
woman in her fifties frustrated
by the void in her life after
children are gone, or a worried
worker unhappy with his or her
job, the remedy is to shock them
and get them back performing
their roles as this society defines
them. We must fight this.”

Bismarck — they will be letting
me know of bookstores for you to
contact. I’ll get them to you as
soon as I hear. North Dakota is not
exactly open-minded — as a
matter of fact I question if some
inhabitants have minds. It's
becoming spring here and life
seems to be awakening again
after a long winter's nap. I will be
in Colorado Springs later this
summer — I lived there for seven
months and the mountains are
calling me back. You'll be hear-
ing from me periodically. I'm
sending a few selections of my
poetry, my contribution to BMR.
Keep smiling.

Socialist...

had been kicked off the National
Steering Committee because of
Trotskyist politics. They asked
women to sign a petition deman-
ding an open discussion and
debate. Most of the women
present seemed to feel that it
was divisive, and not the right
place or time to deal with it.

Other than this, energy stayed
high.

The conference was
evaluated, and most women
there seemed to feel very
positive that it took place at all,
that the communication was
good, that they were able to
share some common problems
and solutions. In small groups
people shared what they had
done — were doing in practice.
This was a useful interchange.

“Socialist feminism is more
than adding socialism and
feminism together; their syn-
thesis propels us in new direc-
tions. From socialism we take
the tools for analyzing the socie-
ty in which we live and a vision of
an alternative economics
organization based on equitable
distribution. From feminism we
learn that the personal is
political — that what we each
experience in our lives is not the
result of some personal inade-
quacy but is an oppression
common to all women. To see
this gives us the power for
political change.”

There is an ongoing study
group looking at left politics from
a feminist place. Meetings are
Friday at 7 P.M. Call Morgan at
832-2468 or Kim at 573-6394
