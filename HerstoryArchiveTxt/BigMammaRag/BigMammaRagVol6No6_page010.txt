Denver General Nurses Lose Suit

Gabriella Uhlar

Four years ago, nurses from Denver  
General Hospital initiated a suit  
against the City and County of Denver  
charging that the City's job classi-  
fication system is discriminatory in  
operation and founded upon stereo-  
types of women. The suit compared  
the status of nurses to that of other  
professional categories in the city  
system. It showed, for example, that  
the female Director of Nursing Ser-  
vices at Denver General was making  
$144 less per month than the male  
Hospital Administration Officer des-  
pite the fact that both jobs require  
similar levels of education and in-  
volve similar supervisory responsi-  
bility. The DG nurses insisted that  
a federal court recommend a new city  
system to eliminate these inequities  

and that they receive back pay to  
compensate for past discrimination.  
This past April, the DG nurses re-  
ceived a major setback by the legal  
process. Federal Judge Winner re-  
jected their case after hearing near-  
ly two weeks of testimony, saying  
that he could not accept their com-  
parison of nursing positions with  
city professional jobs totally unre-  
lated to the nursing field. Winner  
stated also that the nurses had fail-  
ed to convince him of any difference  
in wages due to sex discrimination  
"except as history has created a low-  
er pay for certain occupations."  
Apparently the lower salaries of  
nurses is due to an oversupply of  
women who have chosen nursing as an  
occupation. Attempts to rectify this  
historic condition by a favorable

Fingerprint Attempt

A woman who violently resisted an  
attempt by the police to take her fin-  
gerprints by force was held by the  
Court of Appeal to have acted within  
her rights. Yvonne Jones got into a  
fierce argument with a policeman after  
a parking incident. Four other offi-  
cers were called to the scene and for-  
cibly removed her to the local police  
station, charged and bailed her. They  
then tried to take her fingerprints,  
she refused, and when a second att-  
empt was made by force, Ms. Jones  
“defended herself stoutly, biting a  
woman police constable and kicking  
her leg. She also bit a male con-  
stable." However, the Court of Appeal  
said that the police have no power to  
take fingerprints unless by the order  
of the magistrates court. Although  

Woman Defends  
Against Police

A Washington, D.C. Superior Court  
judge has ruled Thelma Clatterbuck  
may continue with her suit against  
the District of Columbia. Clatter-  
buck, who is 60, has asked $250,000  
damages from the District in connec-  
tion with a 1975 narcotics raid on  
her apartment. Her lawyer, Walter  
Nicholson, Jr., said she filed the  
suit after plainclothes police armed  
with a warrant naming an entire 12-  
unit building, battered down her door  
at one in the morning. Police report  
state Clatterbuck, who did not realize  
the men were police, charged out of  
her apartment and attacked the intrud-  
er with a bayonet. After an officer  
shot at her, and missed, police re-  
ports state Clatterbuck fled back in-  
to her apartment. Police then re-  
portedly bashed in a second door and  
knocked an elderly woman down. No  
narcotics were found, and Clatter-  
buck, it turned out, did not even  
meet the description of the suspect  
the police wanted. A police weapons  
review commission, however, later  
ruled the use of a gun was (quote)  
"justified."  

Clatterbuck sued the D.C. govern-  
ment, charging the police with ass-  
ault, negligence, unlawful entry,  
violation of civil rights, and intim-  
idation. Early this month, Superior  
Court Justice Harold Greene denied a  
defense motion to dismiss Clatter-  
buck's suit on technicalities. The  
District government, says her attor-  
ney, must now defend its actions on  
the merits of the case, or pay up.

federal ruling had the potential of  
“disrupting the entire economic sys-  
tem of the U.S."  

An appeal of this ruling is being  
considered, though another legal bat-  
tle will certainly be extremely time-  
consuming and expensive. The current  
case does have its limitations since  
it is wholly concerned with “profess-  
ional" categories.

make up over 75% of the health indus-  
try's workforce yet are generally  
poorly paid; working long, unpredict-  
able schedules and have little say in  
the delivery of health care. Chall-  
enges to the nation's second largest  
industry should indeed be frightening  
to Judge Winner. Just where would  
they end?

Breast Cancer  
Detector Found?  

Early detection of breast cancer  
may soon be possible through a simple  
skin test. Dr. Georg Springer of  
Northwestern University has discover-  
ed that breast-tumor tissue contains  
a substance called T antigen. T anti-  
gen is a chemical normally found in  
red blood cells, but not present in  
healthy breast tissue. Springer has  
found that administering T antigen  
to suspected breast cancer patients  
produces a reddening and swelling at  
the site of the injection, if they  
do have cancer. Out of 100 women  
suspected of having breast cancer who  
were given T antigen, all but two who  
showed positive skin responses turned  
out to have breast cancer. The two  
who didn't had benign tumors. Spring-  
er says that further experiments must  
be done to determine if the T antigen  
reaction is truly a specific indica-  
tor for breast tumors and not other  
disorders. If it is, the T antigen  
skin test may be a life-saver for  
many women by detecting cancer early  
enough to arrest it through surgery  
or other means.

Birth Certificate is Invasion of Privacy  

Birth certificates requiring a  
child's mother to record how many  
spontaneous or induced abortions she  
has had are creating a furor among  
women's groups in California. The  
birth certificate put out by the Cal-  
ifornia Department of Health in Jan-  
uary also requires the mother to ans-  
wer questions on ethnic background,  
levels of education, weight gain dur-  
ing pregnancy and whether she engaged  
in drug or alcohol abuse. The Los  

Angeles Times reports that the Cali-  
fornia Commission on the Status of  
Women has strongly criticized the new  
birth certificate, saying that such  
excess information might fall into  
the wrong hands, such as anti-abortion  
groups or certain federal agencies.  
The commission charges that the birth  
certificate “far exceeds what is re-  
quired to record a new birth" and  
constitutes an invasion of privacy.

Right-to-Life Gaining Ground  

The Right to Life movement is appar-  
ently gaining rapid momentum in the  
United States. The New York Times re-  
ports that Right to Life groups have  
already invested millions of dollars  
in efforts to get rid of the 1973 Su-  
preme Court ruling legalizing abor-  
tions. They are proposing a consti-  
tutional amendment to make the oper-  
ation illegal. The newspaper says  
that the National Right to Life Comm-  
ittee, an umbrella organization for a  
number of Right to Life groups, has  
11 million active supporters in 3000  
chapters. Their combined membership  
is much larger than any pro-abortion  
group. The committee, says the Times  
has already persuaded nine of the  
required 34 states to petition Con-  
gress to convene a constitutional  
convention for an anti-abortion amend-  
ment. The newspaper adds that the  
Tax Reform Act of 1976 has also given  
pro-life groups a boost. That act  
allows organizations that are mainly  
"educational" to use 20% of their  
budgets for direct legislative lobby-  
ing without losing income tax bene-  
fits. According to the Times, poli-  
tical action committees which can now  
legally provide funds for candidates  
and lobby against abortion are being  
set up in every congressional dis-  
trict. The Roman Catholic Church  
alone has reportedly donated over a  
half-a-million dollars to the comm-  
ittee for a human life amendment. As  
a result of anti-abortion lobbying,  

Dylan States Marriage Views  

One former husband who has been re-  
thinking his attitude toward marriage  
is Bob Dylan. Dylan said in an inter-  
view with Barbara Kerr that he be-  
lieves in marriage, but not in open  
marriage because, “sexual freedom  
just leads to other kinds of freedom!"  
The protest singer added, "Women use  
romance and passion to sweeten you up.  
A man is no more than a victim of  
that passion." He explained, "You  
give me a woman who can cook and sew,  

and I'll take that over passion any  
day." Dylan said that the role of  
the father became clear to him when  
he once saw a mother cat kill her  
kittens. The father is there, accord-  
ing to Dylan, “to protect the child-  
ren from their mother." The recently  
divorced Dylan said of his former  
wife, "She is still the mother of my  
children and I see fit to protect  
her."

the Federal Government cut off funds  
for abortions in August of 1977.  
Since that time, approximately 14  
states are still funding abortions  
unconditionally, while another 15  
are providing for abortions only if  
there are severe and long-lasting  
health threats to the mother. The  
31 remaining states reportedly do not  
provide for abortions under any cir-  
cumstances.

More Tokenism  

The U.S. is at last admitting women  
scientists and doctors (and blacks  
and orientals) to be trained as as-  
tronauts. There are now six women

Houston. The space agency's adminis-

One woman out of the six possible

1979 U.S. Space Shuttle. It has been  
fifteen years since the first and  
only woman (Russian), Valentina Ter-  
eshkova, has been in space. While  
Tereshkova was on her own, and per-  
formed all necessary duties herself,  
the first American spacewoman will be  
very limited in her activities and  
will be one of a team of six, with a
