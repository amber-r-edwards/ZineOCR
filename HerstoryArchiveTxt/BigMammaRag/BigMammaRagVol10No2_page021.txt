The Lincoln Legion of Les-  
bians, P.O. Box 30137, Lin-  
coln, NE 68503, would like  
to request your assistance  
in creating a network of  
lesbian feminist pro-  
gramming resources and pro-  
ducers, sponsors in our re-  
gion. In our work to spon-  
sor a variety of programs,  
we have often found that  
transportation costs are a  
barrier to being able to  
sponsor appearances by les-  
bians from very far away.  
If interested write them  
for more info.
