On March 24-27, the eighth annual  
Women and the Law Conference was  
held in Madison, Wisconsin. Hosted  
by the women law students from the  
University of Wisconsin Law School,  
the conference was attended by ap-  
proximately 2,000 participants.  

This year’s conference featured  
two major categories that had been  
largely neglected in past years—  
the Lesbian Law Section and Third  
World Women’s Block.  

As a result of the emphasis on  
the Lesbian section, the Wisconsin  
Bar Association decided against  
contributing a grant of $2,500.00,  
which had been recommended by the  

Bar's finance committee. James  
Hough, executive secretary of the  
state Bar, said in an interview  
with Madison's Capital Times, “I  
don't think there's any question  
but that the Lesbian Law Section  
caused some problems (with some  
board members) on whether or not  
the board would lend its (financial)  
support.”  

The keynote speaker for the Les-  
bian Law Section was Elaine Noble,  
assistant majority leader of the  
Massachusetts House of Represent-  
atives. Her speech addressed two  
fundamental issues: the influence  
of the laws upon the lives of les-  
bians and custody cases, and,  
secondly, the influence of the  
legislature in making the laws. It  
was her contention that as the  
courts have failed to uphold human  
rights, it is up to the legislature  
to re-write the laws to guarantee  
constitutional protection for all  
people.  

After Elaine's speech, the Les-  

Women's Library Opens  

Mary Wadding  

Eight months of diligent sorting  
and cataloging have culminated in  
the opening of the Woman to Woman  
Feminist Bookcenter's library.  

Initial plans for the library were  
put together nearly two years ago  
when the Center opened. Since that  
time, books, newspapers and periodi-  
cals have been collected and stored  
in the basement of the bookstore,  
waiting only for a group of women  
to summon the energy to put them into  
order.  

In August of last year, Trudy Sauter  
and Sue Haymes began the monumental  
task of going through the collection.  
All the literature had been dumped on  
the shelves below the stairs and into  
boxes along the walls.  

At the time Trudy and Sue were going  
through the books, it became apparent  
that the already existing systems of  
cataloging were inadequate to accomo-  
date the subject ranges contained  
within the literature. At first,  
prior to last August, there were  
attempts to catalog the library by  
alphabetical listings. However, this  
does not allow for easy access in  

finding a book by subject. If the  
author was not known by the woman  
seeking a specific book, it would  
prove difficult to find.  

The system devised for the new  
library is based on the Dewey Decimal  
System. Basically, there are ten  
categories of subjects applicable to  
a Feminist library. The ten classifi-  
cations are: Health, Family, Spiritu-  
ality, Women and the Arts, Women and  
Literature, Women and Education, Wo-  
men and the Law, Feminist Theory, Her-  
story, and Survival.  

The Dewey System covers any imagin-  
able topic, while the library's system  
covers books about women and the  

super difficult to get ahold of.  
Reference copies may not be checked  
out but women are welcome to use the  
space at the center to read them  
there.  

Also in the planning stage, is the  
Children's library. These books have  
yet to be cataloged, but should be  
finished within the month.  

All books can be found in the card  
catalog listed by author and by title.  
Listing by subject will be done at a  
later date.  

Books may be checked out for three  
weeks. No deposits are required and  
there are no fines for bringing them

bian Law Section dealt with a  
series of strategy workshops.  
Topics included Domestic Relations,  
Employment, Constitutional Law,  
and institutionalization and the  
Criminal Justice System.  
Exploration of the discrimination  
experienced by Asian American,  
Black, Chicana, and Native American  
women comprised the series of Third  
World Women Block workshops. Top-  
ics discussed were: Language Prob-  
lems, Political Access, Affirmative  
Action Trends, ERA Misconceptions,  
Jobs in Professional Organizations,  
and Minority Women and the Family.  

Of the 125 workshops offered by  
the conference, twelve dealt with  
the legal problems of lesbians and  
two related to Third World women.  
Additionally, about 600 women at-  
tended the lesbian workshops, aver-  
aging 90 per meeting. No estimates  
were available as to the attendance  
at the Third World Women's Block.  
This year's conference, according  
to Carol Glowinsky, a student at  
the Denver University Law School,  
was well-organized and thorough  
in its coverage of topics. A wide  
range of participants were repre-  
sented from throughout the nation.  
Though it was a women's conference  
with Feminist themes, it was not  
strongly radical. The discussion  
was a basic, low-key rap, with few  
tones of activism. Reformers seem

drop soccer from its list of sanctioned  
sports.)  

Terra  

In his memorandum opinion and order  
of April 15, 1977, Judge Matsch of U.  
S. District Court ruled that Colorado  
school districts must allow girls to  
play interscholastic soccer if they  
allow boys to do so. The class action  
suit was filed last fall by Donna  
Hoover, a Golden High School junior,  
and Cynthia Hoover, her mother, for  
all girls in Colorado similarly situ-  
ated. Defendants included members of  
the Jefferson County School District  
Board of Education, the Commissioner  

of the Colorado High School Activities  
Association (CHSAA) and the CHSAA.  

The CHSAA rule struck down as uncon-  
stitutional stated that in regards to  
soccer, "NOTE: Because inordinate in-  
jury risk jeopardizes the health and  
safety of the female athlete, partici-  
pation in this activity is limited to  
members of the male sex."  

Compliance to the order of the court  
requires equal opportunity be carried  
out through one of several alternatives:  
abolish interscholastic soccer  
altogether, provide separate but "com-  
parably equal" teams for girls, or  
allow girls the opportunity to compete  
on the presently all-male teams.  

Before last fall, Donna had already  
played on a Golden High School reserve  
soccer team one year and was, according  
to her coach, in the "top 2/3 of the  
team in skill level." Her hopes were  
to play on the varsity team, when last  
September she was called into the off-  
ice of the Golden HS athletic director  

to be more concerned with issues  
such as forming law collectives and  
working within the legal framework  
as professionals. Very few women  
were concerned with issues such as  
alternative practice. The women  
were mostly of the ERA feminist  
level.  

Carol went on to describe the  
participants as a “law school,  
privilege class." Most of the  
women were either students or prac-  
ticing lawyers, members of a higher  
class by rights of economics.  

Women who are able to attend law  
school usually have the money to be  
there in the first place and, there-  
fore, have access to privileges  
that middle and lower class women  
do not.  

It is this sense of privilege  
that dominated the overall tone  
of the conference. While conscious  
of their higher status, the confer-  
ence women have a lesser conscious-  
ness of the politics of feminism;  
they don't feel the same political  
motivation.  

Overall, the conference was not  
a high-powered analytical one, but  
with the potential, through legal  
knowledge, to offer strength to the  
movement.  

As Carol said, the conference  
is the beginning analysis, but  
still needs to hone the edge in  
terms of true feminist awareness.  

The conference is annual and  
organized by law students "to pro-  
mote the equality of women through  
educational workshops, opportunities  
for women to develop and exchange  
technical and litigational skills,  
and the promotion of a nationwide

and told she couldn't participate or  
practice with the team anymore because  
of the CHSAA rule prohibiting girls  
from soccer competition. She decided to  
fight the discrimination and got a  
temporary order which allowed her to  
play in the presence of the coach until  
the end of the season, except where  
"probability of collision contact with  
other players exists."  

One criterion which Judge Matsch  
used was how important high school  
athletics is to a student. Such acti-  
vities were decided to be an "integral  
part of educational progress in public  
high schools of Colorado." Chances for  
athletic scholarships to college were  
also limited by prohibiting high school  
athletic competition for girls. "While  
the content of the educational programs  
is up to the local school board,  
whether it is algebra or athletics,  
that which is provided must be open to  
all."  

The defendants' case was based on the  
state's interest to protect females  
from injury in this sport. However,  
evidence shows that size and other  
factors of difference between the sexes  
is less than the range of differences  
of these variables within the boys’  
group or girls' group. Since there  
was no effort made to establish physi-  
cal criteria to protect small and weak  
males, the idea of protecting lost  
credibility. Judge Matsch contended  
that “there is no rationality in limit-  
ing this patronizing protection to  
females who want to play soccer."  

“Women and girls constitute a majori-  
ty of the people in this country. To  

be effective citizens, they must be  
permitted full participation in the  
educational programs designed for that
