Distributors Talk Business/Music

Ronnie Ewoldt

The author feels that the use of
the words "womon" and "worn," which
are feminist-identified words, are
an important part of defining our-
selves in terms related to the
patriarchy.

The Olivia Records' distribution
network, having grown from 10 womyn
and one "45" record in mid-1974, now
has over 80 womyn in 32 states, Puer-
to Rico, Germany, and England, dis-
tributing seven albums, two song-
books, and the "45". Inherent in
this growth process is the problem
of maintaining close communication.
There is a monthly distributors’
newsletter; there are letters to and
from the Olivia collective in Los
Angeles; there is Pac Bell. But in
order to provide the space for shar-
ing, political interchange, and sup-
port, to be found in sitting down
with other "Olives" for a few days
of discussion, decision-making, and
of course, a little music, Olivia
held the first in an on-going series
of distributors' conferences last
June. The most recent one, held
December 4th and 5th in Austin, Tex-
as, included womyn from New Mexico,
Texas, Colorado, Arkansas, Missouri,
and Louisiana.

In preparation, the Austin distri-
butor volunteered her home and made
arrangements for food and lodging.
Space, Olivia paid for and coor-
dinated plane flights, and all who
would be attending, including two
collective members, put together
a list of agenda items.

Hearing Casse's and Theresa's music
first thing provided an appropriate
atmosphere for the conference.
Casse, recorded on the Urana Label,
draws on country western music for
much of her style, and Theresa's
style varies from a gutsy blues to
country to contemporary funk. This
generated an informal discussion on
the process Olivia uses in determin-
ing who to record and in what order.

The conference began Saturday morn-
ing with tapes of Casse Culver's and
Theresa Trull's forthcoming albums,
which will be out in January and
February, respectively. Hearing
Casse's and Theresa's music first
thing provided an appropriate atmos-
phere for the conference.

These recordings generated an in-
formal discussion on the process
Olivia uses in determining who to
record and in what order. The pri-
ority is to record womyn whose music

is womon-identified, and to provide
a wide range of womyn's music.

During the time set aside for in-
troductions, it was learned that
those at the meeting distribute in
very diverse areas.

The numbers of records sold range
anywhere from 30 to 300 a month,
meaning some distributors make as
little as $15-20 a month, while
those in urban areas where there are
large womyn's communities might
make as much as $200 a month.

Some distributors have found it
possible to organize telephone con-
spiracies, whereby a list of local
stations and their telephone numbers
are passed out at concerts and meet-
ings. If enough people call and
request an artist, there is the
likelihood that they'll play it a
few times at least. This can have a
powerful effect. Womyn who might
otherwise never hear this music may
go to a concert and discover the
existence of womyn's communities.
(In this area, several stations have
albums. Try KFML, KCFR, KOSI, KBPI,

Kade, KRNW, or KIMN. Any calling
should be done on a very random
basis as it's unusual for a station
to receive more than one or two
requests per day for any one song
that’s out "Top 49." A deluge of
calls may make the station refuse to
play anything.

This prompted a discussion of the
new distribution system begun last
October. Previously, distributors
worked on a commission basis. Under
the new system, records are bought
from Olivia for $3 and are then re-
sold to stores for $3.50 to $3.65, or
to individuals for $5, (the same
price as at the womyn's store in this
area). This way Olivia has less
bookwork and the distributors more
money. Hopefully distributors
will soon be able to be paid a month-
ly salary, eliminating the need to work
other jobs to pay the bills, and
freeing those hours to be spent
doing Olivia work. A discussion also
ensued about the way such a salary
would be determined. Possibly, it
could be based on each womon's
"needs," i.e. rent, food, transpor-
tation, and business expenses, and
the number of hours she wants to
work. Salaries are still several
months away, but these questions can
be thought about and worked on in
the meantime.

Most of the discussions and deci-
sions made were based on the politics
of being a feminist business within a
capitalist economic structure. Dis-
cussion often centered around main-
taining collectively-run business
in the face of the non-feminist re-
cording industry, legal requirements,
and Olivia's growth and expansion.

It is felt by the Olivia collective
that they will continue to grow
without having to compromise their
original goals: 1) To make high
quality womyn's music available to
the public 2) To give womyn musi-
cians access to the music industry

3) To offer training in the techni-
cal, musical, and other fields re-
lated to the recording industry and
4) To provide jobs with decent pay
in non-oppressive conditions.

Olivia differs in that her profits
do not make a few womyn “at the top”
rich, nor are those profits made
by the exploitation of its workers.
All money goes back into Olivia
Records for production of more
albums, for future purchase of its
own studio, and to provide training
and wages for workers. Each year,
Olivia's financial statement is pub-
lished in the feminist press, and
further questions can be directed

to local distributors, who, along
with Olivia Records, are accountable
to the womyn's community.

At the end of Saturday morning's
discussion, "Organic Blueberry Pie”
was shown. This video, produced by
Suzanne Shiffman and Brenda Warren,
is a combination of interviews with
Cris Williamson, Holly Near, Karlene
Faith, Margie Adams, Olivia collec-
tive members Ginny Berson, Jennifer
Woodul, and Meg Christian, inter-
spersed with clips of concerts,
and presents the views with various
concepts of womyn's culture.

The following few hours were pri-
marily a sharing session. Ideas
were exchanged about bookkeeping
systems, promotion, prices, and ways
to set up new accounts with over-
ground stores. When each new record
comes out, a certain number of copies
are used for “promotion.” Womyn's
bookstores are each given a free
copy, and if it seems that an over-
ground store will indeed play the al-
bum (instead of selling it), a copy
is usually given.

Ideas were also shared about get-
ting music played in coffeehouses,
college student unions, and in
bars. The "45's" that are made
for each album produced by Olivia
are primarily for juke boxes.
