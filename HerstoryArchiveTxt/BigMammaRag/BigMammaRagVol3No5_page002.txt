Women and Therapy

a psychological adventure

Franci Candlin, Carol Lease, and Sandia

If it has been several thousand years that men have
controlled the public lives of women, it has been nearly a hundred
that the attitudes of Freud and his followers have commandeered
our psyches. It is against their prescribed conventions of mental
health and treatment that Anne Wilson Schaef has been devoting
her practice, and her energies have been in the direction of women
defining and establishing their own psychological models.

The process of unlearning traditional psychological theories
began about six years ago for her. Although the change in Schaef
has been evolutionary, the main catalyst was a workshop on
Community Development sponsored by The National Training
Laboratories. She relates that people in the institute quickly split
along racial and sexual lines. On the second day of the workshop,
the Black members caucused, a decision that the group as a
whole respected. However, on the fourth day when the women
decided likewise to caucus, their actions were met with disbelief,
paternalism, and extreme defensiveness on the part of the male
staff. The significance of this event for Schaef was to arouse in
her an awareness of the negative reactions of men toward women
who dared to step out of the White Male System (WMS).

Problem of Rage

Soon after, she decided to
focus on formulating theories
and techniques relevant to
women. Following several
workshops with women, she
began to witness their in-
tense, terrifying rage which
she admits was a frightening
experience for her. She
realized that she had to deal
with her own rage before she
could help women with theirs.
She illustrated the inability of
many therapists to cope with
their clients’ rage. They
encourage patients to explore
their feelings, but when these
feelings are expressed as
rage, then frequently they
resort to tranquilizers rather
than confront the existing
emotions.

Such attitudes only heighten
the alienation women
already feel. Schaef refers to a
recurring fantasy of women
which exemplifies this isolat-
ing aspect of rage. In this
fantasy, the woman pictures
herself standing all alone in
smoldering ruins following
the explosion of a hydrogen
bomb. Schaef interprets this
imagery as meaning that
women feel that if they
allowed themselves to ex-
press the full intensity of their
anger, they would be capable
of devastating the whole
world, leaving her totally
isolated.

Schaef encourages women
to get in touch with their rage
using the modality of a group
as their support system. She
feels this is crucial as the
main fear of women is
isolation from men and later
on estrangement from other
women if they were to give
vent to this rage. Thus the
importance of groups in
therapy. The group can be of
assistance in this painful
process because women know
that the group will not desert
them, and they can use the
collective experience of the
group to validate their own
feelings.

One method for working
through the rage phase which
Schaef has utilized is a “rage
room.” This is a place where
the only guidelines are that
the individual cannot directly
harm herself or any other
person. In the instance of one
school teacher, she expressed
her rage by chopping up a
desk. Although this technique
bears some resemblance to
Primal Therapy, unlike Primal
which has become a “belief”
system providing an “an-
swer,” and which contrives
rage, this approach stays out
of the way of the client and
deals with what naturally
emerges.

Following this emotional
catharsis, the cognitive phase
of therapy must begin. Now

Ann Schaef, feminist therapist.

Schaef encourages women to
explore what she terms as her
“Original Sin” theory. This
derives from a woman's
perception that she is born
innately inferior to men by
reason of her sexual class.

She seeks to rid herself of this
second-class status by at-
taching herself to a man.
However, much to her dismay,
she fails to find the superior
man who can be the outside
intermediary that will make
everything okay, and so the
void continues. At this crisis
point, women too often reach
the conclusion that some-
thing must be wrong with
them individually. Somewhere
they must have personally
failed. Schaef uses the group
to help women distinguish for
themselves which problems
result from being members of
a certain class—and most
women take their identity
from men—and which pro-
blems arise from their own
personality patterns.

An Emerging Feminist Theory
Schaef has devised the
following theoretical con-
struct as a way of explaining
the difficulties women have
coping with the White Male
System (WMS).

note: see graph

Schaef states that most
traditional therapy focuses on
either the intrapsychic level
(problems within the individu-
al) or at best on the
interpersonal level (problems
arising between family and
friends). However, unless the
pervasive influence of the
WMS is recognized and
accounted for, many pro-
blems will be erroneously
viewed as primarily personal
or interpersonal in nature
rather than as a spin-off of the
WMS refusing to accept or
respect the beliefs and values
of other subsystems.

The WMS comes complete
with its own mythology and
rhetoric. In part that reads:
“The WMS knows and under-
stands everything.” In other
words, it becomes a belief
system, too, assuming there
is only one “rite” way. Like a
religion convinced of the
Truth, the WMS sees no need
to look at any of the sub-
systems’ ways of perceiving
reality. In actuality, those in
the subsystems (Chicanos,
Blacks, women, etc.) know
the most about the WMS as
they have had to scrutinize it
closely trying to decide why
they are never fully accepted
by it. More important, they
have had to know it as a
survival tactic.

The thrust of the Women’s
Movement has been the
awareness that there are other
systems, and they are not
innately inferior. Moreover,
each system comes complete
with its own politics, its own
philosophy, and in a sense its
own religion. That is why it is
impossible for a therapist to
be apolitical or aphilosophi-
cal. And this is why women
need to understand how they
as part of the female system
might operate necessarily
different than men. One
example of differentiating the
female and male systems is
our attitude toward time. Male
time is measured, controlled,
regulated by numbers. Female
time is process. Rather than
thinking in terms of clocks or
intervals, women think in
terms of completing one task
and when that is finished or
when a gestalt is completed,
they move on; if they need
more time they get it. This
attitude toward time becomes
especially valuable when ap-
plied to time segments allotted
for therapy appointments. If a

client needs more than the
usual hour, she gets it and all
of Schaef's clients share that
understanding.

Schaef's model provides an
alternative framework for
viewing mental health as a
process of problem solving
rather than as a cure for an
illness. She further explains
that the word neurosis is also
male-oriented and based on a
traditional medical model
which sees psychological
realities in terms of such
stereotypes as sickness and
health. From this perspective,
the relationship between ther-
apist and “patient” is intrinsi-
cally authoritarian and hier-
archical. The therapist diagnos-
es the sickness and pre-
scribes the cure. A feminist
orientation sees a problem as
an opportunity for growth. 
When growth as a natural
process is interfered with,
then certain symptoms be-
come manifest. What women
must recognize is that people
have the dynamics of matur-
ing within them and need not
be manipulated from without.

In feminist therapy, then,
the role of the therapist
becomes “a model for coping,
not a perfected individual.”
Thus, she shares herself and
her problems with other group
members and encourages
them to relate to each other
outside the sphere of the
group. This sense of peer-di-
rection can sustain a continu-
ing network of support across
the country.

Usual Money Bind

Her work is without con-
flict. As a feminist who sees
herself in a primary commit-
ment to women, Anne Schaef
is caught in the “service/oc-
cupation” dilemma shared by
many professional women.
That is, as a professional and
a working woman she needs
to charge for her services
though she is aware that some
of the women who need her
help the most cannot often
afford to pay for it. Yet, she is
keenly aware that women in
this society need to be paid
and recognized for their
efforts. What does a woman
do who has been working
since sixth grade and has
children to support and there
are clients with outstanding
debts that range into the
thousands? She struggles.
While there are certain fees,
Schaef negotiates. Some wo-
men are capable of paying
$30/hour. Some are not able
to pay anything. Schaef has
had to resolve this problem of
remuneration on an individual
basis, working out with her
clients their needs and hers.
Since some women see her
privately, or in groups, and
still others for occasional
weekend workshops, she tries
to arrange sessions that suit
the clients’ financial status.

Future Outlook

Schaef has not only trained
women nationally on her
views of therapy, but is
presently working on a book
which would delineate a
feminist model. Her aim is to
convey how women feel and
experience the world and then
to take a critical look at the
differences between the fe-
male and male systems, with
