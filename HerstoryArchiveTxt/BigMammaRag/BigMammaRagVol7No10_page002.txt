Anita Bryant

Bobbe Ross

In late September folks learned  
that Anita Bryant was being sponsored  
by the Association of School Business  
Officials to appear October 15 in  
concert in Denver at the Auditorium  
Arena. The Association which was  
having its 65th annual convention in  
Denver originates out of Chicago.  
Lesbians and gays met and decided a  
picket should be organized. People  
divided the work into various commit-  
tees, some of whom had to deal with  
the media and police. There was  
lesbian and gay representation on  
all committees. Child care was ar-  
ranged as an alternative for bringing  
children to the demonstration.

Two leaflets were written, one to  
the Lesbian/Gay community to rally  
people to the picket, some with  
Spanish translation. The pressure  
of time prevented all the leaflets  
from having the translation. The  
second leaflet was for distribution  
to the people paying 9 to 10 dollars  
to hear Bryant.

On October 15 about 500 lesbians/  
gays and some heterosexual friends  
showed up for the picket, many carry-  
ing their own signs, others carrying  
signs that committee members had made  
earlier. Even with that many people  
in a fairly narrow area, the picket-  
ers were orderly and loud. Police,  
dogs, and patrol cars were very  
evident, in front of us and on each  
end. Onlookers were across the  
street watching us and much of the  
time, heckling us. Cars going by  
would show support by waving and honk-  
ing. Police ticketed some cars and  
a motorcyclist for excessive noise.  
Legal advisers were on the scene and  
it is hoped that people would have  
some help with those tickets.

Picketers restrained themselves,  
but were very angry by the obvious  
police harassment. The marshals  
urged people back into the picket  
line and to get on with the business  
at hand. Although the picket line  
was long, it extended from one block  
to the other, the line opened willing-  
ly and courteously for people going  
into the Auditorium. Police brusquely  
escorted people through the picket  
line, making a show of being public  
servants.

The picket began around 7 pm and  
continued until just before 10 pm.

No one was arrested, no fights occur-  
red and the mood of the people was  
strong and the emphasis of the signs  
and chants were for gay rights and  
reminding people that "We are your  
children."

At the convening meeting alterna-  
tive actions were discussed but be-  
cause of the pressure of time. A  
picket was felt to be the simplest  
action to organize and would bring  
out the most people. The politics of  
that meeting went the whole spectrum,  
but when signing up for committee  
responsibility, there was much enthu-  
siasm and people were very respons-  
ible. Assigned jobs were done at  
the time they were supposed to. Crit-  
icism/self-criticism was not done nor  
was a meeting called to discuss the  
picket afterwards.

Comes to Denver

“Take Back the  
Night” March

About 400 women carrying candles marched  
to “take back the night" in Boulder  
on Friday, October 5th. Women met at  
8 p.m. at Chautauqua Park and walked  
through the University of Colorado  
campus singing and chanting. The  
group rallied on the University campus  
where Becky Foote from the Boulder  
Women's Rape Crisis Center and Judy  
Leach of the District Attorney's Off-  
ice spoke. The march continued on its  
route through the Pearl Street Mall  
with marchers singing the chorus from  
“Fight Back," a song by Holly Near.

Datacall

Any person who believes she/he is  
the victim of discrimination or unequal  
treatment by police or in employment,  
housing, public accommodations or  
abuse by people on the streets because  
they are Gay or Lesbian is invited to  
call “Datacall."

Co-coordinators of Datacall, Carol  
Lease and Gerald Gerash say that the  
main purpose of Datacall is to see if  
frequent allegations of Gay and Lesbian  
discrimination can be proven.

Anyone interested in reaching Datacall  
is asked to phone the Gay Community  
Center at 831-6268, leave their name  
and phone number and one of the co-  
coordinators will call back for an inter-  
view.

Investigating  
Temporary  
Employment

Have you ever worked a temporary  
job through a temporary job service?  
If so, you know what is going on:

* Low wages to you relative to the  
high fees temporary services charge  
their customers.

* The lack of any real benefits--  
vacation, sick pay, insurance.

* Your lack of control over the kind  
of work you will do.

* The increasing reliance of corpor-  
ations in Denver on temporary workers.

Three Denver feminists invite other  
women with an interest in the workings  
of temporary job services in Denver,  
to join them in an investigative ac-  
tion project. If you have done cler-  
ical, factory, cleaning, construction  
or any kind of medical work for a  
temporary job service, you have some-  
thing to contribute to winning changes  
for all temporary workers.

This group is just forming; as of  
this writing, no regular meeting sched-  
ule has been set. Initially, its work  
will focus on gathering information  
about the numerous temporary services  
in Denver.

To work with the group or contribute  
information, call Bobbe (377-5193),  
Kathy or Jan (322-6298).
