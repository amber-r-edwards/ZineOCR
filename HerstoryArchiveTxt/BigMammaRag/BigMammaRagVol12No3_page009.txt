And Forest Rights - And For Survival

a very rich area in terms
of all kinds of natural re-
sources, it has the richest
forests in the country. The
British passed very repres-
sive forest laws, declaring
certain areas protected
forests which means the
tribals lost age-long usu-
fractory rights to enter
these forests and these
tribal economies are essen-
tially forest-bound. It is
also an area of subsistence
agriculture, it is a one
crop region because there
is no irrigation, there is
no source of water except
the monsoon. If the mon-
soon failed even that one
crop failed which means
the amount of food produced
is not enough for year-
round consumption. So for
months of the year the for-
ests are the only source of
survival. Only a small por-
tion of the forest is left
for the tribals, for their
survival. The British en-
couraged commercial exploit-
ation of the forest by out-
side commercial traders.
The forest would be leased
to timber merchants while
it became criminal for peo-
ple to go and collect wood
for their fuel. Increasing-
ly the forests are vanish-
ing and the country is a vast
desert land. So the fuel
and fodder needs and other
forest uses such as game
hunting began to be severe-
ly restricted. Even years
after Independence this po-
licy has become more repres-
sive. Getting fuel now in-
volves having to walk many
miles. I find it traumatic,
I can hardly believe that
somebody should need to go
through such drudgery for
such a basic survival need.
Fuel is not available unless
you walk miles into the
forest.

This is also a very rich
mining area, it provides the
heart of India's mineral
wealth: coal, iron, copper
and mica. So the British be-
gan to encourage what they
called "the development" of
this area. They encouraged
people to come in and open
mines, extract the mineral
wealth. In the name of the
industrialisation of the
region, there was large-
scale appropriation of trib-
al lands. After that, what
they called "development pro-
jects", hydro-electric pro-
jects, irrigation schemes,
building dams, railway sta-
tions. One dam and hundreds
of villages will be submerg-
ed. Tribal land was taken
away without any measure of
fair compensation and anyway
to the tribals money has no
value. Therefore they're

fighting on all these fronts.
To reclaim their forest
rights, to stop land aliena-
tion by private land owners
and industrialists and fight-
ing their Government and its
development projects.

Even today, though we don't
have a British government,
even though we have an Indian
government, they are follow-
ing exactly in the footsteps
of the British. There is the
whole tradition from the col-
onial structure of an abso-
lute lack of accountability
to the people. You want to
do something, all you have
to do is to pass a circular let-
ter, just issue a circular
in what's called the District
Gazetteer. And people can't
read and write English. All
you do is issue one notifica-
tion. And suddenly that's de-
cided. The tradition which
carries on after the British
left is this: the British
created the structure because
they saw themselves as abso-
lute rulers, they were not
accountable to the Indians,
they were here only for the
purpose of their exploita-
tion. They had absolutely no
notion of accountability.
That has become so embedded
in the system, into the very
mentality of this whole gov-
ernment machinery that they
are only perfecting it more
and more rather than being
able to break it. So the
lands are taken away. Some
people say if irrigation
comes to this tribal area,
it will help agriculture.
Yes, if irrigation comes it
is good, but the moment the
land becomes productive the
outsiders will come in. It
will not then be left to
the tribals. The tribal
land is poor, so poor that
nobody really wants it. As
soon as it becomes rich, it
will be taken away.

As if this was not enough,
in many tribal areas, you
find a problem for women
is that they have no land
rights. Even when tribals
own land, women have very
limited rights, only rights
as a daughter and the right
to be maintained as a wife.
Not the right to own land
as a man. This puts women
in a very vulnerable posi-
tion. If their brothers
don't want them to be in
the house and to be main-
tained, pressure is put on
them to marry. When they
marry and the husband mal-
treats them, which is very
common, or the husband just
leaves them which is equal-
ly common, they have no-
where to go except back to
seek work in the city in
very brutal conditions be-
cause they are so poor

and resourceless. The more
resourceless and poor you
are, the more exploitable
you are. So that's another
thing which Manushi has in
mind. We have to fight to
stop tribal land aliena-
tion, but women must be
given rights to own land,
because women perform 90%
of all agricultural tasks,
they do all the forest
gathering. Little work is
done by tribal men. I would
say the economy is run by
women. Unfortunately wom-
en's rights are not yet on
the agenda of tribal poli-
tics. On the question of
women's rights, tribal pol-
itics tend to be extremely
conservative. They have em-
ulated the worst of outside
culture when it comes to
the rights of women.
Manushi has challenged
this denial of land rights
to tribal women in the
Supreme Court. We say it's
unconstitutional because
our constitution swears by
equality, it says that
there shall be no discrim-
ination on the basis of
sex. This happened because
some tribal women brought
this to our notice. They
are fighting a hard surviv-
al battle within the commun-
ity and they need to be
able to hold on to the
land for their survival.
This comes for a final
hearing next month. If we
do succeed it's a very
small step forward, be-
cause the essential battle
is getting this accepted.
A mere judgment on a piece
of paper is no good.

(Broadsheet has yet to hear
the outcome of this Court
Case.) The battle will be
to acquire collective
strength enough to put some
content into that paper
right.

KKKKKKKKK
The Bodhgaya Struggle

A recent struggle and one
in which the question of
women's rights assumed the
most radical dimension is
the Bodhgaya struggle in
the district of Bihar, one
of the poorest states in
India. In this area the land
is concentrated in the hands
of the religious head of a
Math, a Buddhist institution.
It illegally held enormous
tracts of land in direct
contravention of the law.
Because there was one land-
lord, resistance was easier
because you don't have to
fight many employers, just
one, although it had enor-
mous political clout at its
disposal and the power of
the state machinery behind
it. One of the first fights
for women in these struggles
has been the right of women
to fight at all, the right
to be involved in a creative
way.

The Bodhgaya struggle
started on the slogan of
"land to the tiller": Those
who sow and plough the land
are the owners of the land."
