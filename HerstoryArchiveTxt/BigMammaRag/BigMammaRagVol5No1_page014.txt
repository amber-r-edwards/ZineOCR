Revolution:  
The Need To Organize...

(Bonnie is the pen name of a 24  
year old white woman who has been  
living and working in the San Fran-  
cisco Bay Area. At one time, she  
identified herself as a lesbian  
separatist but now works with a  
mixed left group.)

BMR: Why are you working with a  
mixed group in a hierarchical  
structure?

Bonnie: My goal is working for the  
revolution, which I see as seizing  
state power through class struggle,  
(a necessary condition to cultural  
revolution).

BMR: How did you become involved  
in politics?

Bonnie: I started out several years  
ago thinking of myself as a strong  
woman, that “women’s lib” was a  

good thing but that I was indepen-  
dent and didn't need the help of  
anybody else to get by. I was  
against the war, wanted everyone to  
love each other and had some notion  
that if poor people started small  
businesses and communes we could all  
have the good life.

BMR: What changed your ideas?  
Bonnie: After working a bunch of  
shit jobs (in what seemed like every  
kind of women's work--in motels, of-  
fices, bars) and after a lot of  
struggle with the man I lived with,  
after getting no support in my “pro-  
gressive" school for what I wanted  
to study, and after seeing all the  
problems continue in the country I  
got fed up and angry.

BMR: What did you do about your  
anger?

Bonnie: I sought out people who  
shared my anger, who turned me onto  
women's studies, radical psychology,  
and political economy. I turned  
over a lot in my life; I saw the  
personal as political, that sexism  
caused much of the pain and frustra-  
tion in my life, that capitalism is  
the system that perpetuates sexism  
and other forms of oppression that  
keep the profits up and the people  
down. I learned that revolution  
could be positive to my goals.

BMR: Were you working in any poli-  
tical groups at that time?

Demystifying Socialist Feminism...

confront capitalism. I could have  
said that we need to address oursel-  
ves to the class system simply be-  
cause women are members of classes.  
But I am trying to bring out some-  
thing else about our perspective as  
feminists: there is no way to under-  
stand sexism as it acts on our lives  
without putting it in the historical  

context of capitalism.

Unlike ‘mechanical Marxists’  
we cannot understand class  
struggle as confined to wages  
and

I think most socialist feminists  
would also agree with the capsule  
summary of Marxist theory as far as  
it goes. And the trouble again is  
that there are a lot of people (I’ll  
call them "mechanical Marxists") who  
do not go any further. To these peo-  
ple, the only "real" and important  
things that go on in capitalist soci-  
ety are those things that relate to  
the productive process or the conven-  
tional political sphere. From such  
a point of view, every other part of  
experience and social existence-  
things having to do with education,  
sexuality, recreation, the family,  
art, music, housework (you name it) is  
peripheral to the central dynamics of  
social change: it is part of the  
"superstructure" or "culture."

Socialist feminists are in a very  
different camp from what I am calling  
"mechanical Marxists." We (along with  
many, many Marxists who are not  
feminists) see capitalism as a social  
and cultural totality. We understand  
that, in its search for markets, cap-  
italism is driven to penetrate every  
nook and cranny of social existence.  
Especially in the phase of monopoly  
capitalism, the realm of consumption  
is every bit as important, just from  
an economic point of view, as the  
realm of production. So we cannot  

Bonnie: I didn't want to work with  
men because I was tired of being  
harassed, intimidated, and emotion-  
ally messed over. I was living,  
working, studying and getting it on  
with women. Mostly, I was involved  
with helping set up a women's stu-  
dies program, a teaching collective,  
and living in socialist-feminist  
households. We were building some-  
thing of our own--non-competitive,  
non-hierarchical--a women's alter-  
native culture.

IF THE GOAL IS TO GROW  
LARGER AND KEEP BRINGING  

IN NEW PEOPLE, A HIERARCHICAL  
STRUCTURE WORKS WELL...

BMR: Why did you start to work with  
mixed groups?

Bonnie: I learned a lot and felt  
really good, but after a couple of  
years I found myself getting burned  
out on the work I was doing because  
it seemed to be limited by the fact  
that there was no clear strategy;  
people had different political goals  
and there was not much outreach to  
people who weren't pursuing it.

Like the song says, "I can't be free  
'till everybody else is." There's  

a great need to reach out to people  
who have the same interests and con-  
cerns (and most of us do, one way  

or another) and organize around  
common needs.

BMR: What kinds of groups did you  
start to become involved with?  
Bonnie: I found myself studying  
labor history and economy and seeing  
the need to organize. I knew of a  
group doing a combination of commun-  
ity and labor organizing so I  
checked it out and started working  
with them. I said to myself, "I can  
learn these skills even though I  
don't agree with the structure (hier-  
archical) and I can always take them  
back into the women's community.”

It was important to me that they were  
organizing service workers, or as I  
put it, women's work, and that they  
were into training people and didn't  
lay anything down about sexual pre-  

understand class struggle as some-  
thing confined to issues of wages and  
hours, or confined only to work-  
place issues. Class struggle occurs  
in every arena where the interests  
of classes conflict, and that includ-  
es education, health, art, music, etc.  
We aim to transform not only the  
ownership of the means of production,  
but the totality of social existence.  
As Marxists, we come to feminism  
from a completely different place  
than the mechanical Marxists. Because  
we see monopoly capitalism as a  
political/economic/cultural totality,  
we have room within our Marxist  
framework for feminist issues which  
have nothing ostensibly to do with  
production or "politics," issues  
that have to do with the family,  
health care, "private" life.  
Furthermore, in our brand of Marx-  
ism there is no "woman question"  
because we never compartmentalized  
women off to the "superstructure" or  
somewhere in the first place. Marx-  
ists of a mechanical bent continually  
ponder the issue of the unwaged woman  
(the housewife): Is she really a mem-  
ber of the working class? That is,  
does she really produce surplus  
value? We say, of course housewives  
are members of the working class- not  
because we have some elaborate proof  
that they really do produce surplus  
value- but because we understand a  
class as being composed of people  
and as having a social existence  
quite apart from the capitalist-dom-  
inated realm of production. When we  
think of class in this way, then we  
see that in fact the women who seemed  
most peripheral, the housewives, are  
at the very heart of their class-  
raising children, holding together  
families, maintaining the cultural  
and social networks of the community.  
We are coming out of a kind of fem-  
inism and a kind of Marxism whose  
interests quite naturally flow toge-  

ther. I think we are in a position  
now to see why it is that socialist  
feminism has been so mystified. The  
idea of socialist feminism is a  
great mystery, or a paradox, so long  
as what you mean by socialism is  
really what I have called "mechanical  
Marxism" and what you mean by femin-  
ism is an ahistorical kind of radical  
feminism. These things just don't  
add up; they have nothing in common.  
But if you put together another  
kind of socialism and another kind  
of feminism, as I have tried to de-  
fine them, you do get some common  
ground and that is one of the most  
important things about socialist  
feminism today. It is a space- free  
from the constrictions of a truncated  
kind of feminism and a truncated  
version of Marxism- in which we can  
develop the kind of politics that  
addresses the political/economic/  
cultural totality of monopoly capit-  
alist society. We could go only so  
far with the available kinds of fem-  
inism, the conventional kind of Marx  
ism, and then we had to break out to  
something that is not so restrictive  
and incomplete in its view of the  
world. We had to take a new name,  
"socialist feminism," in order to  
assert our determination to compre-  
hend the whole of our experience and  
to forge a politics that reflects  
the totality of that comprehension.

Women are the culture  
bearers of their class.

However, I don't want to leave  

socialist feminist theory as a  
“space” or a common ground. Things  
are beginning to grow in that  
"ground". We are closer to a synthe-  
sis in our understanding of sex and  
class, capitalism and male domination  
than we were a few years ago. Here I  
will indicate only very sketchily  
one such line of thinking:

BMR: Were women also in positions  

of power?

Bonnie: In the groups I worked in,  
one effect of using a hierarchy  
provided a way to deal with sexism  
without challenging it directly, I  
saw men with real pig notions about  
women change because they were learn-  
ing from women in leadership posi-  
tions. It's called dealing with po-  
sitions, not people; you get the po-  
sition through training and commit-  
ment; everyone does it; that way  

you don't need charisma.

BMR: What were some of the advan-  
tages you found working with a  

mixed group?

Bonnie: I enjoyed working with pe-  
ople who I never would have other-  
wise: women (and men) of all ages,  
races, and class backgrounds. When  
we talk with each other about how  

we survive and live, we can start  
discrediting a lot of racist, sexist,  
and liberal prejudices while uniting  
around common needs of survival. We  
are each other's allies.

BMR: Where are you heading in your  
politics now?

Bonnie: I am at a point of transi-  
tion and need to evaluate what's  
happening in my life right now. I  
need to ground that period of prac-  
tice in a better understanding of  
theory. I am going to read and study.  
BMR: Where do you think the women's  
movement should work towards?

Bonnie: I continue to see a need for  
autonomous women's groups, by women  
for women. Services like anti-rape  
groups and health care are necessary,  
but in themselves not revolutionary;  
in other words, they will not topple  
the power structure. They need to  
be community supported (because gov-  
ernment money gets taken away as  

soon as they do something threaten-  
ing) and have the ability to align  
with other groups. It is going to  

take a lot of groups from all over,  

doing different kinds of organizing  
and services, coming together with  

the people they have mobilized to  

create a revolution.

1. The Marxist/feminist understand-  
ing that class and sex domination  
rest ultimately on force is correct,  
and this remains the most devastating  
critique of sexist/capitalist society.  
But there is a lot to that "ultimately".  
In a day to day sense, most  
people acquiesce to sex and class  
domination without being held in  
line by the threat of violence, and  
often without even the threat of  
material deprivation.

2. It is very important, then, to  
figure out what it is, if not the  
direct application of force, that  
keeps things going. In the case of  
class, a great deal has been written  
already about why the US working  
class lacks militant class conscious-  
ness. Certainly ethnic divisions, es-  
pecially the black/white division,  
are a key part of the answer. But I  
would argue, in addition to being  
divided, the working class has been  
socially atomized. Working class  
neighborhoods have been destroyed  
and are allowed to decay; life has  
become increasingly privatized and  
inward-looking; skills once possessed  
by the working class have been  
expropriated by the capitalist class;  
and capitalist controlled “mass cul-  
ture” has edged out almost all indig-  
enous working class culture and  
institutions. Instead of collectivity  
and self-reliance as a class, there  
is a mutual isolation and collective  
dependency on the capitalist class.

3. The subjugation of women, in  
the ways which are characteristic of  
late capitalist society, has been  
key to this process of class atomiza-  
tion. To put it another way, the  
forces which have atomized working  
class life and promoted cultural/material  
dependence on the capitalist  
class are the same forces which have  
served to perpetuate the subjugation  
of women. It is women who are most
