Indian Act Disputed

According to Canada's Indian  
Act, the federal legislation  
that governs the Canadian In-  
dian population of Canada, a  
woman loses her Indian status  
and rights, including her  
right to own a home on a re-  
serve, when she marries a non-  
Indian. The same act gives  
wives of Indian men all the  
rights and privileges of a  
full-status Indian Canadian.  
Sandra Lovelace is fighting  
the discriminatory act by  
bringing her case (she had  
married a non-Indian) to the  
attention of the international  
community. The Canadian gov-  
ernment is now considering a  
new nondiscriminatory Indian  
Act. But they say it would be  
too expensive to reinstate  
those who have already been  
stripped of their rights.

More On Additives...

Thousands of Puerto Rican  
girls aged 8 months to 8 years  
are experiencing premature  
breast development caused by  
eating contaminated chicken,  
milk and beef. A large percen-  
tage of the children affected  
also develop cysts on their  
ovaries. Furthermore, the hor-  
mone additives are known to  
cause cancer in humans (DES  
is one drug used to promote  
growth in animals). And this  
in a colonized nation where  
40% of the women have been  
sterilized.

Centerfold Beer

William Boam has come up  
with the idea of labeling beer  
with the body of a nude woman.  
“I got the idea when I...stop-  
ped by a store to pick up a  
six-pack and a copy of Play-  
boy. I walked out thinking,  
‘Gee, I could combine these  
two things.'" Nude Beer would  
have a different picture each  
month, "so the beer will be  
just like the centerfold in a  
magazine - we're going to run  
a nationwide contest and put  
the winner on the label each  
month."

Gays “Enchanted”

An advertisement in a Denver  
gay publication (Guide) pro-  
motes "a seasonal enchantment"  
RIPPER. “London, a century  
ago...In the darkest fog of  
the alleys and moors it  
waits..." And gay men wonder  
why lesbians have trouble  
working with them!

Haitians Released

The U.S. Justice Department  
announced Sept. 22 that it  
would parole 49 Haitian refu-  
gees jailed in the Immigration  
and Naturalization (INS) fac-  
ility in Brooklyn. The an-  
nouncement came 24 months  
after Judge E. Spellman's  
order that the INS release  
all Haitians detained after  
May 20, 1981. The Brooklyn  
detainees were excluded from  
that ruling, issued in Miami,  
FL, because they were invol-  
ved in a separate lawsuit in  
New York. Until Sept. 22,  
the government refused to  
release them.

Death By “Dowry”

Old Indian tradition per-  
mits in-laws to kill a bride  
if they are dissatisfied with  
the dowry being offered by  
the bride's family. Indian  
officials have discovered that  
19 such murders were commit-  
ted in the first half of 1982  
in New Delhi alone, and so-  
called “dowry deaths" occur  
as often as every other day  
in all of India. Although the  
nation outlawed dowry murders  
22 years ago, no one has ever  
been punished for the crime.

Black Lesbian Beaten

Robin Porter, a 26-year-old  
Black lesbian, was beaten and  
arrested by 3 cops after whis-  
pering a remark to a friend  
about police using a night-  
stick to choke a man sitting  
on a park bench. She was later  
taken to a hospital with mul-  
tiple contusions and hemorr-  
haging in her left eye. Wit-  
nesses following police to the  
station were insulted and in-  
timidated by police who came  
out of the precinct.

Curfews For Blacks

The South African government  
is planning to impose a dras-  
tic nationwide urban curfew  
for Black people, an attempt  
to tighten the existing pass  
laws. Under the present pass  
laws, Black people may remain  
in the "white" areas for up to  
72 hours without a permit.  
Now, no Black person will be  
allowed to remain in "white"  
areas between 10 at night and  
5 am the following morning.  
Massive nighttime raids are  
expected to follow the changes  
in the pass laws.

Baton Sale “Mistake”

News of the sale of 2500  
shock batons to South Africa  
surfaced Sept. 17. The appro-  
val of the sale, issued April  
26, was “an honest mistake,"  
"a simple, unfortunate screw-  
up." The present administra-  
tion has revised export con-  
trol regulation and licensed  
the sale of several items that  
had been barred by previous  
administrations because of  
the white-ruled nation's sys-  
tem of "apartheid."

58,000 Dutch Squat

Squatters and their support-  
ers battled with police in  
three cities in the Nether-  
lands on Oct. 12 and 13. Focus  
of the protest was a three-  
story building that squatters  
have held for 3 months after  
they were ordered to leave  
for a housing conversion.

Some 58,000 people are listed  
as seeking places to live in  
Amsterdam alone, and police  
estimate that up to 10,000  
people have taken over office  
buildings left by companies  
moving to the suburbs.

“Homemakers” March

In Boston, 100 "homemakers"  
marched on the governor's  
campaign headquarters to pro-  
test low wages and lack of  
benefits provided by home care  
corporations which employ  
5,000 mostly Black, Hispanic  
or Haitian women in the area.  
These companies get $6.35 per  
hour and the workers get from  
$3.50 to $4.35 after ten  
years. The United Labor Union  
(ULU) is organizing workers  
and is concerned with the  
financial accountability of  
these agencies as well as im-  
proved wages and basic bene-  
fits such as sick days, pen-  
sion and health insurance.

Gay Bar Is Raided

More than 30 uniformed,  
armed New York City police  
raided and virtually destroyed  
a small Black gay bar in a  
violent attack which lasted  
more than an hour and sent  
countless victims to several  
hospitals.

On Sept. 29, police entered  
Blue's, locked the front door,  
and said, "Let's have a party.  
All you 'niggers' to the back,  
hands up, face the wall." The  
customers and employees were  
beaten with nightsticks and  
pistol butts. Machines were  
destroyed, bottles broken and  
emptied and money stolen. And  
on Oct. 8, the same policemen  
came to Blue's again.

At present, representatives  
of the two police precincts  
involved will not say what  
caused the attacks because it  
is now being investigated  
internally.

Straight Strikes

Another Cincinnati area  
woman appears to have been  
the victim of a "lesbian de-  
programming" scheme this year.  
Cyndi Masters alleges that  
she was forced by her parents  
into a drug rehabilitation  
program in which staff members  
attempted to "cure" her of her  
lesbianism. Masters said that  
although she had abused drugs  
in the past, she had been so-  
ber for over a year and a  
half last February when her  
parents led her into a trap  
at Straight, Inc., from which  
it took her 2 months to escape.

First Victory

After almost a month of  
civil disobedience and demon-  
strations, North Carolina re-  
sidents protesting the dump-  
ing of tons of soil laced with  
cancer-causing PCB's (poly-  
chlorinated biphenyls) won  
their first victory. Gov. Jim  
Hunt, who had previously re-  
fused to meet with the protes-  
ters, agreed that the landfill  
will be detoxified as soon as  
feasible, and that he will  
support a bill outlawing fur-  
ther toxic waste landfills in  
Warren County. The town chosen  
for the dumpsite, Afton, N.C.,  
is 75% Black, and racism is  
said to have played a role in  
the choice of the site. Hunt  
also promised that the state  
would monitor the health of  
residents and safety of drink-  
ing wells within a 3-mile  
radius of the dump.
