Seeks to Reunite Families

Suit Filed

A civil suit on behalf of Viet-
namese children was filed in a
California federal court against
government officials responsi-
ble for the “Operation Babylift”
on April 27.

The suit charges that many of
the over 2000 Vietnamese
children evacuated to the U.S.
from April 3-28 were illegally
evacuated and adopted. The suit
also maintains that many of the
children wish to return to Viet-
nam, and, contrary to Operation
Babylift coordinators’ conten-
tions, many or most of the child-
ren are not orphans.

The suit was filed by Muoi
McConnell, a Vietnamese
woman, and is being handled by
the Center for Constitutional
Rights in New York. McConnell,
a nurse’s aide living in the San
Francisco area, said she had
volunteered to work at a
processing center for the
evacuated children in San Fran-
cisco where she learned that
some of the children there
wished to go back to Vietnam.

Specifically, the suit was filed
on behalf of three Vietnamese
siblings, aged 3, 6, and 7 years
old. According to the suit, the
children had become separated
from their parents during the
retreat of the Saigon army and
were temporarily placed in an
orphanage until their parents
could be located.

“The plaintiffs had been
living in the ‘orphanage’ for only
days before they were removed,
abducted and transported to this
country,” the suit charges. “No
efforts were made to reunite
them with their parents before
bringing them here.”

McConnell said the three
children “were desperate and
begged me to help them return
to their parents.” However,
McConnell was refused permis-
sion to interview the children
further, and has been refused
information on the children’s
current whereabouts by Opera-
tion Babylift coordinators.

Interviews Required

The lawsuit requests the dis-
closure of the current location of
all 2,000 infants and children
evacuated by the airlift, and
permission to interview the
children to determine if they
wish to return to Vietnam.

The suit also requests that the
government be required to turn
over records on the children’s
pasts, records relating to the air-
lift and adoptions, and the iden-
tities and addresses of the
children’s Vietnamese parents
and/or guardians.

A spokesperson for the Center
for Constitutional Rights said
however, “Frankly, I don’t think
the government even cares
where these children came
from, and I’d be surprised if they
even have these records.”

The federal judge hearing the
suit, Spencer Williams, refused
to grant a temporary restraining
order in early May which would
have forbidden further adoption
of the children until it is deter-
mined whether the children
should be returned to Vietnam.
Preliminary hearings on the suit
are scheduled for May 15, and a
lawyer for the plaintiffs says
both U.S. and international laws
stand in favor of the return of the
Vietnamese children.

Legal Adoptions

The lawyer said it appeared
that many, if not most, of the
children were illegally adopted
since most states in the U.S.
require an affidavit from a child's
parents or guardian relin-
quishing rights before a child
can be adopted. Many of the
children were apparently
adopted without these essential
papers.

The evacuation and adoption
of the Vietnamese children is
also in violation of the 1973
Paris Peace Accords, the plain-
tiffs charge. The Peace Accords
prohibit the U.S. from “inter-
vening into the internal affairs
of South Vietnam.”

The “babylift” is also in ap-
parent violation of the 1949
Geneva Convention on the
Protection of Civilian Persons in
the Time of War. Specifically,
Article 49 of the 1949 Conven-
tion “prohibits taking of
protected persons to a non-
neutral country regardless of
motive” and requires that “per-
sons thus evacuated (only for
temporary security of the pop-
ulation) shall be transferred back
as soon as hostilities ... have
ceased.”

Children As Pawns

Although the lawsuit names
Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger, Secretary of Justice
Edward Levy, and Secretary of
Defense James Schlesinger as
co-defendants and officials
responsible for the Operation
Babylift, it is not known exactly
who gave the orders to imple-
ment the airlift.

However, a Thieu cabinet
appointee, Phan Quang Dan,
said that in a conversation he
had with U.S. Ambassador
Graham Martin in late March,
Martin “stressed that this
evacuation will create a shift in
American public opinion in favor
of (Saigon). When these children
land in the United States,” Dan
reported Martin as saying, “they
will be subject to television,
radio and press agency coverage
and the effect will be tremen-
dous.”

The effect was a tremendous
outpouring of indignation
however, from the international
community, but particularly
from the Vietnamese them-
selves.

The evacuation was sharply
attacked by Huynh Lien, the
head of the Mendicant Buddhist
order, one of the largest and
most influential of the religious
orders in Vietnam. “We have
lost too many people in this war
already,” Lien said, “so why
send away our children too? It is
an insult to Vietnamese women
to suppose that they cannot look
after their own children.”

Mixed Children Wanted

Lien denied reports in the
American press that Vietnamese
children of American fathers
would be subject to discrimina-
tion in Vietnam, adding that the
children are likely instead to face
discrimination in the U.S. “We
feel a Buddhist love for all
people,” Lien said, “It does not
matter who the father of the
child is.”

The Mendicant order main-
tained an orphanage in South
Vietnam throughout the war, but
Lien said the Thieu administra-
tion restricted the number of
children the order could take
care of because of the Men-
dicants’ opposition to the war.
Lien said the order could have
taken care of many of the 2000
evacuated Vietnamese children
if they had been called upon, but
she would prefer that the child-
ren be reunited with their
families instead.

And Phan Thi Minh, a
spokeswoman for the then
Provisional Revolutionary
Government of South Vietnam,
said, “Only now, after years of
bombing and napalm have
destroyed our villages full of
women and children, are these
governments worried about the
fate of our little ones.” Minh also
added that the U.S. policies in
Vietnam had created 10-12
million refugees in the South
and that if any of the children
were orphans, it was un-
doubtedly because their parents
had been killed by U.S. or Saigon
army troops.

Anybody who has informa-
tion on the current where-
abouts of the Vietnamese child-
ren evacuated under the
Operation Babylift is requested
to get in touch with the Center
for Constitutional Rights. The
Center stresses that the infor-
mation is vital since Judge
Williams has indicated that the
burden of proof in the suit will be
on the plaintiffs.

People with information
should get in touch with Nancy
Stearns at the Center for Con-
stitutional Rights, 853

Feminist Calendar Again

If you or your group has
any event planned that you think
would be of interest to the
feminist community, let us know
— deadline is the 15th of the
month for the next month's
issue.

Structure

Given five days, a campsite,
summer and a gathering of
women who mean business,
which is the best way to go? The
conference facilitators have
been talking about small groups,
large groups and workshops.
Small groups so that everyone
can say her say; large groups to
draw it all together; and
workshops to deal with
specifics. So far the projected
workshops are: land purchasing,
organic or other farming, animal
farming, mechanics and
machinery, construction
(carpentry, plumbing, electricity),
health care (professional and
paramedical), child care and
education, businesses (cottage
industry, crafts), communal
government, communication
with the movement, media,
finance, law and its relation to
the community, public relations
(dealing with the existing com-
munity), design arts, alternate
power sources, policy on men,
library and resource facilities,
women's communities in the
past, defense (self and com-
munity).

Clearly, the expertise needed
to make this conference happen,
and the equipment necessary to
document it, will have to come
from the participants
themselves. There will be
women traveling this summer,
who can research land
availability and prices. There are
women whose experience has
given them to reflect on different
lifestyles. They are the women
who will facilitate workshops.

Already women across the
country, still only a few, have
offered to share their skills and
information at the conference:
so far, in the areas of electricity
and carpentry, community
financing, land purchase, legal
processes, credit unions, alter-
nate power sources, self-
defense, and communication.
Many more are needed to come
forward, not to teach or to
organize, but simply to offer
themselves as centers for others.
