Horrors In Mind

Dear BMR:

In your June, 1982 issue—
the reprint of Marilyn Kay
has touched me so much with the
horrors I have been trying
for so long to forget. I have
not seen as many articles pr-
inted about the "treatment"
we get as lesbians in the mental
“health” system, and the tr=
eatment also from our "sis-
ters" in the women's and les-
bian movement. What a contra-
diction of the slogan sister-
hood—at least the mental
health system never says we
accept all and love all—Our
power as lesbians I have
found is in ourselves not
“our" movement. I fought the
abuses of drugs, the abuses
of incest—and the abuses of
being my sister's token "ment-
al patient". And now I am &
have the strength to be a full
person, a woman who loves women
& will discuss how I feel a-
bout the mental health system
& their drugs & treatment. If
it will help someone not have
to go through the torture I
did.

Please accept my thanks for
your newspaper & my love—
Keep up the good work.

In Sisterhood—

A Woman's Story

Dear Rebbecca Lesses,

So you thought my article
was "an almost totally nega-
tive picture" of Jewish id-
entity. Gee, thanks for dis-
counting my life experience!
Who are you to say what is
"positive" and “negative”?
Is my frustration at being
always subjected to male
supremacy within Judaism
"negative"? Is refusal to
put my energy into the sac-
red misogynist chant, the
Shama, "negative"? My exper-
ience with Judaism was not
one of "discovery". I grew
up in a Conservative Jewish
family in which we all kept
kosher, observed Passover,
observed the twenty-four hour
Yom Kippur fast, and watched
Grama light the Sabbath
candles every Friday night.
Where do you come off dis-
counting my experience as
"negative"?—A woman's story
is her story. It's not an
issue of labeling one story
"positive", and one story
"negative".

My article was written
reacting against three

Jewish women who felt that
the emergence of Jewish wom-
en's identity was racist and
white supremacist. I included
a long background to the
horrors of anti-Semitic vio-
lence against Jewish people
over the centuries, because
I wanted people to know

that anti-Semitic violence
did not just happen with
Nazi Germany, that Jewish
people have been struggling
for the whole history of
Europe.

I assume my article on
spirituality was also the
"diatribe" you referred to.
Do you forget that I am
also a Jewish sister? My
whole point was struggling
against patriarchy, not
Judaism in particular. It's
just that my cultural exper-
ience is of being Jewish.

In light of Israel's re-
cent slaughtering of Leban-
ese people, do you still re-
fuse to hold the state of
Israel responsible for its
racism and brutality
against Arab people?

In struggle,
Rose

Judaism Encountered

Dear BMR:

I'd like to elaborate a
little on what I said in my
letter to you last month,
specifically about the situ-
ation in the Middle East.

—I wrote my letter before
the war in Lebanon broke
out. I'd like to say that I,
and many other Jews, do not
support Israel's invasion
of Lebanon, while remaining
supportive of Israel's right
to exist. I mourn those who
have died in Lebanon, been
wounded, or been made home-
less. I don't think Israel's
actions were justified mil-
itarily, and in this I
think I agree with many in-
side Israel, members of
Shalom Achshav (Peace Now)
and other peace movements.
New Jewish Agenda, the Amer-
ican Friends of Peace Now
have both come out with
public statements opposing
the war and calling for hu-
manitarian aid to the vic-
tims of the war.

At the same time, I hope
this is an opportunity—
created by horrible means,
but here nonetheless—for
Israel to realize the Pal-
estinians are not going
away, and for the Palestin-
ians to realize Israel is
not going away (some on
both sides have called for

and Palestinians,

recognizing the other).
That's what I hope for, that
those who have recognized
each other on the battle-

field will now recognize

each other at the negotia-
ting table—without the
rhetoric and posturing com-
mon on both sides.

I'm glad to see my arti-
cle, and Vivian's article,
finally published. I didn't
feel it necessary to state
my opinions on Zionism in
the article because I wanted
to talk more about my re-
ligious feelings than my
political views. Vivian did,
I noticed, mention her
views on the Middle East.

It should be clear from
this letter that I support

both Zionism and Palestin-
ian nationalism—I think
each group of people, Jews
and Palestinians, each need
a state of their own.

I would also like to
comment on Vivian's article.
I was very glad to see your
article printed, also, but
I think I see Judaism some-
what differently from you
(which is perfectly legiti-
mate—we don't have to all
agree). I very much liked
what you said about “what
we worship." You put into
words what I have had a

great deal of difficulty

saying (not least because

of the embarrassment I
feel talking about Jewish
concepts of the divine in
this Christian culture).
However, I must disagree
with you about women parti-
cipating in the synagogue. I
personally find it very
meaningful to put on a
tallis (prayer shawl) and a
kipah (a yarmulke—in trad-
itional Judaism, both of
these are usually worn only
by men) and be counted as
part of the minyan at my
Havurah (a leaderless Jew-
ish community organized for
prayer, study, support and
socializing). I agree that
lighting Shabbat candles

and celebrating Rosh Chodesh
(New Moon) are meaningful
for Jewish women, but I also
think they are meaningful
for Jewish men. A few months
ago, some of the women at
the Havurah were discussing
celebrating Rosh Chodesh in
a way that would affirm the
strength and wisdom of women,
and one of the men in the
Havurah said that he too
wanted to take part in Rosh
Chodesh celebrations. And I
agree, because I want all
Jewish actions and rituals
to be open to both women.
