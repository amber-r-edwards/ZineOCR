Taking Power in the Workforce

needed to compete in a business is
getting larger and larger and it has
been shown that the amount of money
women are able to get their hands on
is growing smaller and smaller. Plus,
the hard facts are that 400,000 small
businesses go under each year and
being your own boss more often means
broken dreams and money down the
drain.

Getting ahead by getting into the
professions, by getting into the
trades, or by getting to the position
of saying, "I'm my own boss,” keeps
alive the idea that this economic in-
dividualism is the push that will turn
our lives, as women, around. Some
women, maybe, but something that goes
unspoken is that our pushing to get
ahead is more often our push to get
away-- away from the humiliation
that typifies the work of women.

Looking For Answers

Every woman who has grown up in
this culture is taught to have con-
tempt for women's work. Even the mark
of a successful homemaker is her ab-
ility to employ a "lesser" woman to
do the work around the house. The
evidence of the scorn for women's
work, and thus, women, is everywhere;
it shows most evidently in our poor
salaries, poor working conditions
and lack of respect for the work we
do. No matter what it is that women
do at work, the labor of women is
worth less than men's. If we are with-
out credentials, whether they are a
penis or documents showing education-
al achievements, our abilities to
solve problems and do good work go
unrecognized.

Everywhere women are looking for
answers-- maybe the right combination
of affirmative action, equal rights
legislation and becoming more asser-
tive will get us out of the humilia-
tion of women's work. The message is
that we, as individual women, have
to change-- through training, learning
new skills, affirmative action, or
learning “all the games mother never
taught us"- in order to become more
eligible for the rewards our society
offers-- raises, visibility, pres-
tige, etc., etc. We are told to look
at what it is that's wrong with cur-
selves in having been unable to pull
ourselves up by our bra straps; the
women's movement even encourages us
to think something isn't quite right
if we don't aspire to be “exceptional”
women, even knowing that the quota
is fixed on how many exceptions will
be allowed.

“Women do not expect to succeed;

they do not expect to be decently

paid. Resistance, struggle are hard for them, just because they are not

allowed these attributes, and because they are so often condemned to

solitude

in their effort and in their toil.”

Mary Agnes Hamilton, Women and Work, 1941

Most women working today are aware
that something isn't quite right. It
isn't right that we are constantly
made victims of uncertain employment
situations; that we are expendable;
that our work is getting more routin-
ized and that our chances to use our
creative abilities are being eroded
more and more by machinery which is
all designed to keep the element of
human skill to a minimum; this helps
explain the mindlessness of most of
our work and our powerlessness as
working women.

Although our work may be mindless,
we are not. Though this statement may
be simple, it is the most important
thing we have in fighting the causes
behind low wages, subordination to
authority, pressure to produce and
lack of creativity-- all of which con-
tribute to the barriers of our living
a good life.

First Steps

When we give ourselves and each
other respect for all the areas of
work that are not recognized by our
culture as being worthwhile, we make
a very important first step in what
will really revolutionize our posi-
tion in the workplace. When we say
out loud "there is nothing wrong with
who I am or the work I do” we turn
from ourselves as being the source
of the problem and can begin to see
that it's the structure of work we
are forced to fit into that's the

real problem. It's a sham and the
people behind the sham pour millions
of dollars (that could be going to
pay us) into having us hang on to the
myth that all we could ever want out
of life is at hand's reach, if we only
work hard enough and play our cards
right. When all we could ever want
doesn't materialize, we, alone, have
failed. I know of very few women who
can honestly say that they do not
work hard, so it must be that the
cards aren't there for us in the first
place.

When we say out loud that “I am happy
with myself, but I'm not happy with
my job” we can begin to see that what
is humiliating about our work is not
the work itself, but how we are treat-
ed by our employers (and others) in
relation to that work.

As women, we have given very little
thought as to the basic organization
of work and how it connects to our
position in society, let alone how to

change it. We can either try to "get
ahead" or we can continue doing “shit
work." (Shit work is shit work be-

cause the wages are shit; a lot of
"men's" work is the same as our shit-
work, only the pay is such that they
can afford toilet paper.) We make our
strategies for living around the idea
that the structure of work is fixed,
inflexible-- that we are the ones who
have to do all the bending and flexing
in order to make life as good as pos-
sible within this context.

We will always have to work at some-
thing in order to meet our needs of
food, clothing and a place to live,
but there isn't any reason at all
that we should be forced to do this
for the benefit, and under the control
of employers separate from ourselves.

We can change work from slavery to
an expression of what we really need
and want. Taking control of our work
means we take control of the kinds of
lives we want to have. Whether or not

we can get rid of the “unnatural” posi-

tion we are in of working for someone
else's benefit, depends on the actions
we choose to take. Realizing that

group were found dead and the gov-
ernment decided it was suicide. What
do you think about that incident?

Alex: I have to be very cautious
because that's one reason I was
brought before the disciplinary
board. I did a lot of publicity
work defending not Baader or Meinhof
but Gudrun Ensslin and Irmgard
Müller. They were in the prison in
Stuttgart Stammheim for attacking
headquarters. Baader and Meinhof
were the so-called leaders of the
group but they always said they had
no leader; they had been a collec-
tive. I had very close connections
with Irmgard Müller because I defend-
ed her and when I heard on the ra-
dio on the eighteenth of October,
1977, at 9 o'clock, that they had
committed suicide, I couldn't be-
lieve it. They said that they had
killed themselves with a gun and I
couldn't believe how the gun could
have come into the prison because
they were completely isolated. Even
the lawyers who represented them
inspected.

At the same time, contact between

Baader-Meinhof and their lawyers

was interrupted because an aircraft
was hijacked and the hijackers asked
that they release members of Baader-
Meinhof. (In reaction to the hijack-
ing) the Bundestag (German congress)
passed the law that lawyers couldn't
see their clients in prisons for up
to thirty days. This law only app-
lied to members of so-called crimi-
nal organizations and was only in
effect for one month. So, on the
eighteenth of October, 1977, I
wanted to see my client, Irmgard
Müller, who had been badly wounded
because, the government said, she
tried to kill herself with scissors
and I wanted to see her.

BMR: But you could not communicate
with your client.
Alex: No. There was no control and
anything could have happened to her.
But I saw her three weeks later and
asked her “Did you do it your-
selves?" and she said “We didn't do
it ourselves".

There were terrible articles pub-
lished in the Spiegel. A tv news

commentator, Golo Mann, said that
for each person kidnapped on the

plane, one prisoner should be killed.

The public was so pushed a-
gainst the terrorists that you
couldn't exclude that anyone who

could possibly get into the prison
could do what this man said on
tv.

BMR: So the prison officials simply
could have turned their backs and
people could have gotten in to
kill them.

Alex: Yes. We found out that there
was a stair and one door and they
were on the seventh floor. So it
was never cleared up. They did no
research about it. I took a claim
to the city attorney and they re-
fused it.

I said in a very great public
meeting, in front of many people,
that it must be possible to doubt
the official word. Three days after
about eight policemen with guns
came into my law office and they
searched through my office and
looked in my cases. Now I am accus-
ed of supporting this criminal or-
ganization, Baader-Meinhof. I am
accused of conspiracy.

BMR: Were you brought to court?

Alex: Not yet. They search about. At
this time two lawyers have gone to
prison. One of the lawyers of Baader-
Meinhof is now in prison accused of
conspiring with them.

BMR: Did the terrorists come from pri-
vileged backgrounds? What did they
think they were accomplishing?

Alex: Yes, they come from the upper
middle class and we don't really

know what they wanted. They wanted so-
ciety changed to some kind of human
ism with more human rights. They felt
very close to the Toupamaros, a lib-
eration movement in South America,
similar to the Black Panthers here and
Che Guevara in Cuba. They (German ter-
rorists) translated the Toupamaros'
text and then they fought in the same
way.

This is what the left movement says
they did wrong: they didn't start
support from the population. But I
think that they thought that it wasn't
time to find support. They thought,
"We must begin and by our activities
we'll show the population that we are
right" and they thought that in this
way they would find support. But I
don't think it was the right way.
