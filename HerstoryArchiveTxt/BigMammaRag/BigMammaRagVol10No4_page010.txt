The sheer size of this co-
llection is somewhat over-
whelming. However, once the
reader begins to pick and ch-
oose among sections of speci-
al interest, the book becomes

manageable, and fascinating.
Spretnak accomplishes two
things with this collection:
She provides a good overvi-
ew of the herstory of women's
spirituality, from the femin-
ist researchers who exposed
7000 years of Goddess worship
almost everywhere on earth,
through Asian, African, Eur-
opean (Gypsy and Pagan), and
Native American traditions, to
the modern spiritually-orien-
ted part of the feminist sep-
aratist network. She includes
classic works and also new
stuff. A history of WITCH,

(Women's International Terror-

ist Conspiracy from Hell), in
the early days of the women's
Movement, was fun to read. I
had never seen anything about
Goddess worship among African
women, so I welcomed Sabrina
Sojourners, In the House of
Yemanja.
The other thing Spretnak

feminist dimension, are also
worn by those who do not see
what women's participation
in today's Polish fight for
freedom means. We have to
confront what it means that
the 18-man Presidium of Sol-
idarity was just that—all
men.

The women of Poland, as
everywhere, know reality in
a way that men don't. Listen
to a woman from Lodz, inter-
viewed July 30, 1981: “Take
my husband: he's always
worked on the first shift.
He never waits in line. He
knows there is nothing (in
the shops), I told him. But
he isn't really informed. He
can only say the refrigerat-
or is empty. Men don't like

to wait in line...It's like
with the salaries. Lodz re-
ceives the least because
they give us light industry.
Which light industry? We
work in clouds of dust, in
humidity, under an infernal
noise!...They think that be-
cause we're women, they can
pay us less!...Lodz and the
light industry of Silesia
have the lowest salaries in

the country." (L'Alternative,
Nov-Dec. 1981.)

Or listen to Alina Pienk-
owska: "In August, 1980 the
women in Gdansk were very
active in building Solidarity
and in the strike. She fought
for the rights of all

human beings. Naturally an
improvement of the position

of women depends on the im-
provement of the general ec-
onomic situation. But we have
not been able to win our con-
crete demands that are im-
portant to us women...Taken
all in all, I have come to
the conclusion that we must
struggle more for the women's
cause.”

In the course of the Polish
revolution, women have cert-
ainly been the most active,
the most militant, most crit-
ical, most revolutionary of
forces. The present discus-
sion merely scratches the
surface of the wealth and
depth of women's participat-
ion in and contribution to
that movement. Yet something
is surely missing when wom-

en's activity and thinking
has remained almost invisible
for so long. The shortsight-
edness to women as force and
as Reason shows a shortsight-
edness to revolution, to —
seeing precisely—who is
reaching for completely new
relations. That is what must
be confronted if we are to
capture all the new forms of
revolt that are sure to come
from Solidarity's underground
activities, and that are
critical to creating that
truly new world.
