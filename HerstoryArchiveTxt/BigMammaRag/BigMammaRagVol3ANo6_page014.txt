their own penises. The assump-
tion of eternal male leadership
was built into their programs.
‘Neither Jesus nor Marx analyz-
ed his own power trip.” The real
crunch is that you have publicly
‘turned from the Marxist-
Leninist banner in favor of the
one flown by Susan B. Anthony
and Victoria Woodhull. Those
who oppose you are few but
noisy. I usually ignore their dull
rhetoric and nasty
recriminations and would con-
tinue to do so were it not for the
fact that you are now being
publicly victimized.
I am delighted we share the
same “biology”.
Love, sisterhood and welcome.

United Feathers

Dear Staff:

Recently I was given a shot-in-
the-arm by the L.A. women’s
movement and some women
connected with The Feminist
Wicca in particular. Until that
brief but energizing exposure, I
was becoming exhausted by and
deeply concerned about the
pervasiveness of a critical mind
set (and relative feminist
cultural-lessness) of much of
what I have encountered and
participated in here in NY.
United Feathers is a reaction
against both and toward the
warmer feelings of sisterhood
that provide more space for
eccentricity, good-willed
criticism and self-criticism, and,
in fact, movement within the
movement.

National United Feathers (we
started a week ago and we
already have “chapters” in 8
major cities) is also a first public
flight into mythical politics, a
tactical approach I've been
developing. I'll try to write
further about the more world-
changing possibilities of
mythical politics at some future
time.

United Feathers is not design-
ed to be money-making. It is
designed to be mirth-making.
Publish it and this letter if you
like. We hope you and other
sisters enjoy it as an inside joke,
a moment of comic relief from
the difficult pressures of
revolutionary struggle.

Oh, and NY is having its first
and perhaps only U-F. affair...
“The U.F. Annual Beach Bar-B-
Que and Pillow Fight or A Very

Late Celebration of the Winter
Solstice” July 19th. Any new
members from the Denver
Chapter are of course welcome.

P.S. Your coverage on Jane
Alpert was the best in the
country. It was a relief to read.
I'm enclosing a money order for
a subscription. And good luck.

The workers at AMS Head,
Inc. (“Head Ski" in Boulder) have
gone on strike after almost four
months of negotiations. A large
part of the union negotiations
and proposals have been aimed
at eliminating the sex dis-
crimination the women workers
have been facing at Head Ski.

Besides enduring the daily
annoyances of a supervisor's
wink or a superior’s bids at Head
Ski. Although bidders cannot
legally be considered on the
basis of sex, age, race, or national
origin, the interviewer often has
the gender, if not an exact
person, in mind before he posts
the job. There are no firm
guidelines for choosing the
bidder and the interviewer may
use different disqualifying
priorities for the same job in
order to come up with the
desired bidder. If all else ties for
the same job in order to come up
with the desired bidder. If all else
fails, the interviewer can usually
discourage a woman from wan-

ting the job badly enough to
question his fairness. He might
describe the job in such a way
that no one would want it, subtly
mock a woman for even bidding
on the job, demonstrate how
underqualified she is by using
technical terms that no one,
except the previously trained,
could understand, or make her
lift something where even a man
would, or should, routinely ask
for assistance.

With regard to the relative
difficulty of a job and its com-
mensurate pay, women con-
tinually hear that they are in-
dispensable in a low-grade job
— ‘it would take too long for a
new person to achieve that level
of efficiency,” or, ‘a man can't
handle that kind of work —
women are more stable and
better with their hands.’ The fact
is that the higher grade job can
be taught in a matter of minutes
to someone off the street.

There are many single
mothers at Head with two or
more children, trying to survive
on $2.60 an hour. Men and
women come in at the same pay
level, but most men are
promoted in two to three weeks;
some women have stayed at the
entry level two to three years.

Health and safety standards
have also been a major focus in
union negotiations. One woman
who was seven months preg-
nant was forced to work on a
machine which spins tennis
rackets at a high speed. Four
people have been hospitalized
this past year when the racket
flew off and hit them in the
stomach.

All are urged to support the
strike and boycott Head
products. If you have food to
donate to the strikers’ families
(they receive only $30 weekly
strike pay from the union),
please drop it off at Linda
Harford’s, 245 So. 40th Street,
Boulder. For more information,

Schroeder Questions Army

Congresswoman Pat
Schroeder has written a letter to
the Secretary of the Army,
Howard Callaway, enquiring
into the Army’s practice of hiring
go-go dancers to entertain its
personnel.

The letter poses several
questions regarding the employ-
ment of the dancers and the
stipulations devised by the Army
around their performance. In the
most probing question of all,
Congresswoman Schroeder
asserts that the employment of
the dancers “is apparently a
surrogate for broader male-
female relationships among
service personnel. However, I
believe it is a substitute which
perpetuates a shallow and im-
personal sort of relationship
between men and women.
What, if any, accommodations are
being made for more meaningful
activities by or between the
sexes which do not promote
sexual stereotyping?”

She also asks whether the
Hon. Callaway believes that “go-
go dancing fits the image of
Today's Army.”

Gonce Sees Prostitutes

John Gonce, Chairman of the
GOP First Congressional District
Central Committee, professes
shock and disapproval at what
he sees as Congresswoman
Schroeder's “apparent sugges-
tion... that the U.S. Army
encourages prostitution at of-
ficer and enlisted men’s clubs.”
Although conceding that there
have always been prostitutes
where there have been armies,
he asserts that Congresswoman
Schroeder’s “suggestion” is, “in
this enlightened age, it is
reprehensible.”
Perhaps... Chairman Gonce
should reread the Congresswoman’s question and
examine his own assumptions.
