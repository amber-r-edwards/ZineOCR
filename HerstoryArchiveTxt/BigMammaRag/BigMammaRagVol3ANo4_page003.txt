Letters Home to Mama

And Then She Continued  
Chocolate, Sandia,  
Linda & BMR Staff,

Just got BMR March issue  
yesterday at Womanbooks, NYC.  
It's the only place I’ve found you  
here in New York. It's real nice to  
know Denver still exists and that  
you — at least in print — are  
doing well. And you are doing  
well. I am glad you printed the  
Jane Alpert interview. This is  
very important as there are a lot  
of very confused stories floating  
around here, I am glad you  
provided the place for her to tell  
her own story. I much prefer to  
hear it from her than from the  
New York Times, who are a  
questionable source of  
information about our communi-  
ty.  
Well, here is the book I told you  
about many months ago. (And  
Then She Continued, poetry by  
women in New Haven). There  
have been many mix-ups around  
this book. I've almost considered  
it some weird fantasy that we'd  
even done a book — but here it is  
and now it's feeling a little more  
real. It turned out better than I'd  
thought and worse than I  
thought. It looks good but one of  
the poems is totalled, someone  
screwed up real bad on this  
poem — ‘Male Lesbian,’ it’s too  
bad but unalterable now.

I am glad you are printing  
articles like Sandia’s ‘Lesbian  
Nation Politics, The Ties That  
Bind’ and ‘The Individual  
Solution — A Depressing  
Discourse’ — depressing, yes,  

but it’s absolutely necessary that  
the Women’s Movement press  
deal with what I see as a very  
crucial issue, that of how we —  
feminist revolutionaries — are  
sabotaging ourselves and that  
we analyze why this happens.  
I hope you enjoy the book and  
hope you can review it as it  
would help us to sell it — which  
we want to do. If you have any  
info. on who could sell it in the  
Denver area let me know. I hope  
you get the money support to  
continue doing the good work  
you're doing. I will help when I  
can. Also, if you have the  
address of Z Budapest please  
send it to me. It’s real interesting  
that the advocate of a Woman  
church should be arrested; the  
State knows what is most  
dangerous. If a Women’s church  
could be set up this would allow  
us the same mobility, legal  
protection and material  
protection that the Roman  
Catholic church has and believe  
it, they don't want this threat.  
Keep up the good vibes /good  
work.

Planning a Women’s  
Community  

An Open Letter to Sisters:

We are a group of radical  
feminists/lesbians in the Miami  
area who recognize the need for  
the development of an effective  
nationwide system of  
communications among  
feminists. Too often, the fact that  
we are so dispersed and isolated  
from each other makes it difficult  
to attain the goals we so  
desperately need to further the  
progress of the woman's  
revolution. Therefore, we  
propose a national conference,  
the purpose of which will be to  
plan the creation and  
implementation of a unified,  
concentrated area of feminism,  
primarily as a large, self-  
sufficient, independent  
women’s community and  
communications network  
center.

We are looking for a place to  
hold this planning conference.  
We need enough land to  
accommodate sisters from all over  
the country who would be  
interested in joining us at this  
planning conference to be held  
sometime in August or  
September.

We would also like to hear  
from sisters who would be  
interested in planning,  
organizing, and advertising the  
conference in their areas.

Let us give power to Elizabeth  
Gould Davis’ vision of a return of  
the matriarchy.

In Sisterhood and  
in Struggle,

Conference Committee,

Dear Mama,  
I have been absolutely loving  
BMR lately. It’s really good,  

we're feeling the same kinds of  
conflicts and feelings down  
here, and it’s just great to pick it  
up each month. I sort of feel like  
I did in the first years of the  
movement (or months?) when  
every page of a feminist  
newspaper was pure ex-  
citement. Now I rarely feel that  
way in general, but always feel  
that way about Big Mama. I’m  
(we're) excited about the idea of  
going to Mexico City, agreed  
completely with your analysis of  
Sagaris (I had planned to write  
something myself, and just read  
the article instead), etc. Keep up  
the good work, and thanks for  
pushing CIRCLE ONE.

Tucson and BMR  
Dear Mama,

Well, it’s just like you said:  
there IS feminist activity afoot  
here in Tucson, and it’s both  
alive and well.

I finally made it over to the  
Women’s Center to see about  
writing for the Sisterhood Ex-  
press, Tucson's “soon to be”  

feminist newspaper, only to find  
that there might not be a  
Women’s Center! That shock led  
me to my first Women’s  
Community Meeting, and guess  
what! No tea and cakes, and no  

fur flying!  
I took copious notes, as per  
your request, and I even  

managed to compose a sort of  
news article on the progress  
made that evening by the sisters  
in Tucson.

The only problem is I don't  
have the money to have the  
article published. Could you  
spring me a loan (you know,  
getting credit is rough on the  
single girl...) or put my news  
story right here in the letter  
column? It would be much ap-  
preciated.

Oh, yes, just one more thought  
before I sign off, Mama. Thanks  
for the 30 copies of BMR which  
you sent. They're all distributed  
(Antigone Books, Hot Rocks  
Records, Perelandra Jewelry) in  
hopes of informing and  
outraging my new-found and  
yet-to-be-found sisters here in  
the Southwest. The proceeds  
follow.

Love and thanks  
Laurie
