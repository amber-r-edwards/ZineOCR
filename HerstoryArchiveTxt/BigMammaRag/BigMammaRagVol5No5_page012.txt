**Woman On The Line**

**Coors—They Don’t Want Women**

Since 1971 Coors Beer has hired 65  
women brewery workers under pressure  
from the EEOC. Women are now 4% of  
the workers and minorities 5% at  
Coors brewery. Laurie Babock worked  
at Coors as a general brewery worker  
for four years until she went on  
strike 2 months ago with the brewery  
Workers Union Local 366. We asked  
Laurie her feelings about sex discrim-  
ination at Coors, the strike and what  
it feels like to be on the line.

BMR: Laurie, you're one of the few  
women that have been working at Coors  
in the brewery. What kinds of dis-  
crimination have you run into?

Laurie: Basically, a simple part of  
it is the clothes and safety precau-  
tions we have to go up against. For  
instance, I had to fight six months  
to get myself a pair of small gloves—  
and I still haven't gotten them,  
although I'm on strike now. The only  
gloves they have are men's medium  
and extra large. Now the mediums are  
too big for me, the mediums are too  
big for some men, and the mediums are  
much too big for most of the women.  
It's a case of catching the extra  
fingers on the gloves in the machinery  
or wires. It's a pain in the neck  
and sometimes working on the machinery  
it can be quite dangerous.

Another thing on clothing itself.  
A friend of mine had been wearing a  
men’s shirt with the tails untucked.  
It's a safety precaution that you  
aren't supposed to have loose clothing  
and she was told to tuck it in. So  
she tucked it in, but then they  
came out with new clothing for the  
women. What they gave us was smocks  
which are actually longer than the  
shirt tails on men's shirts. Now I  
can't see the difference. That smock  
could very easily get caught in any  
type of machinery. And it's regular  
cotton polyester so it doesn't  
stretch or anything like that and  
you could get dragged into the machine  
and possible injuries might occur.  
Another thing. Boots were ordered  
for us—again, because we weren't  
supposed to be wearing the men's  
clothes. The boots have different tread  
on them than the men's. As soon as you  
step on a wet floor you can expect to  
go slipping and sliding and you're  
probably on your butt half the time.  
It's just little things like that that  
you have to keep fighting for con-  
stantly.  
BMR: What about restroom facilities?  
Laurie: The only locker room for  
changing is in packaging. There's  
also one other bathroom and that's in  
packaging too. If you work in one of  
the other departments, you have to  
go up to a supervisor, if you can find  
a supervisor, and get a key, and then  
go up to the other department to go  
to the bathroom or whatever. You  
have to plan your emergencies or what-  
ever about half an hour ahead of time.  
BMR: Do you feel that this is negli-  
gence on the part of the company or  
do you feel like they're actually  
trying to harass women workers?  
Laurie: Actually, I don't think they  
want the women around. I don't know  
if it's harassment, but there are  
times where they do give some women  
a hard enough time where they want to  
quit.

BMR: Do any of the guys you work with  
have old fashioned attitudes about  
women?

Laurie: There are two old fashioned  
ways. There are guys that don't want  
the women around and expect you to  
pull your weight entirely—pulling  
heavy machinery around by yourself  
and stuff like that—and there are  
other guys that go back to not wanting  
you to lift things at all. Of course,  
you’re also going to have the typical  
MCP that everyone always thinks about,  
but even then, when they get to know  
you, there's a respect that can be  
reached. I've gotten to the point  
where the guys will back me up and  
they have backed me up in the past.  
BMR: How much support have you gotten  
from your union in the kind of things  
you're fighting for?

Laurie: I haven't really brought a lot  
of things up to the union, because  
I've tried doing it on my own. But  
the shop stewards have backed me as  
far as I've gone. 100% let's say.

BMR: I understand that a suit was  
filed with the EEOC against both the  
company and the union for not hiring  
or actively pushing and promoting the  
hiring of minorities and women.  
Laurie: I don't know much about the  
suit. But as far as I can tell right  
now, the company openly fought to keep  
women and minorities out and in their  
place. The union didn't exactly push  
for it or push against it.

BMR: The current strike demands are not  
directly concerned with the kind of is-  
sues we've been talking about. What  
are the issues in the strike and why do  
you think it's important that every-  
body—women, men, racial minorities—  
get together behind this strike and  
support the Coors boycott?

Laurie: I think people have to get to-  
gether against this type of company to  
stop them from using people. Take seni-  
ority for instance. If Coors had their  
own way, they would use people as much  
as they could—unbearable hours, and  
that sort of thing. Then once you get  
burned out or start fighting back, they  
would just drop you. This is where I  
think seniority might help. Without it,  
they could keep their supposed good pe-  
ople there, their yes men in hand.

BMR: I understand there're a lot of wives  
coming down and doing support work on the  
picket. As one of the few women workers,  
since you know the guys better, how does  
it feel to meet their wives?

Laurie: The wives down there are doing  
one really good job. They're working  
on the picket, they're working on the  
boycott, they give a lot of moral sup-  
port.

BMR: How do they feel about you since  
you're working with their husbands?  
Laurie: It was kind of touchy at first.  
I felt uncomfortable. Because I knew  
the guys and I didn’t know all the  
wives. There's usually not many women,  
so they're nice around to have to talk  
to. At first I may have thought there  
was some sort of competition going on  
because the guys' wives were down there,  
but it's no competition any more. We're  
working for one goal and we're working  
together. It's just one big family.  
That's the way a union is.

**EEOC, Coors Make Deal**

**Peg Hickox**

The second week in May, stories ap-  
peared in the local press to the effect  
that Coors Brewery, the fourth largest  
brewery in the country, had reached a  
settlement with the Equal Employment  
Opportunities Commission (EEOC) re-  
garding sexual and racial discrimina-  
tion in their hiring practices.

In the settlement, in which the  
Operating Engineers and Laborer's  
Union were also parties, Coors admit-  
ted to past discrimination in two  
cases, one involving a woman and one  
involving a Black. The total compensa-  
tion to the injured parties was $2,200.  

Coors also agreed to a minimal in-  
crease in funding and training pro-  
grams for women and minorities. The  
settlement agreed upon relieves Coors  
of any further affirmative action  
measures for the next three years.

The agreement was not signed by the  
Brewery Workers Local 366, the largest  
union at Coors which covers approxi-  
mately 1500 workers. The Brewery Work-  
ers union stated that the settlement  
did not in any way represent adequate  
compensation for Coors' discriminatory  
practices. One union official called  
the settlement a "secret deal between  
the government and Coors." The agree-  
ment was leaked to the press two months  
after it was originally signed, sug-  
gesting that Coors was, in fact, try-  
ing to pull some sort of coverup. It  
is still unknown whether the Brewery  
union will file a separate suit charg-  
ing Coors with discriminatory practices  
against women and minorities.

At the end of last year, Coors pre-  
sented an Affirmative Action program  
to the Brewery Workers which would  
give the company full control over  
that program and which would override  
any existing union contract. Such a  
program would give Coors a free hand  
in hiring and promoting workers,  
regardless of seniority, work record,  
or competency. According to the union,  
this would enable the company to pit  
one group of workers against another  
and virtually eliminate all worker  
protection.

The union was willing to accept an  
affirmative action program that would  
include stipulations using government  
or union guidelines. Coors was unwil-  
ling to comply with the union's demand  
and the union dropped the affirmative  
action clause from the contract nego-  
tiations in January.

**HAGAR THE HORRIBLE**

**SOMEDAY WOMEN WILL HAVE JOBS JUST LIKE MEN!**

It's a funny thing. People that have  
been taking our jobs, the scabs, have  
to take a polygraph before they can  
get the job. There have been people in  
there who couldn't get the job because  
they couldn't pass the polygraph and  
now they're screaming: So even the  
people who were trying to scab are mad  
and they're yelling up and down the streets.

Once a company starts doing the things  
Coors is doing, you're losing your  
rights. People who are not working for  
Coors should consider this also. It's  
not basically economic situations in this  
strike. It's human dignity and human  
rights we're fighting for. If one com-  
pany can start using people like this,  
another company can do it. So that's why  
I think people should stick together.  
Women, men—the children are down there  
too—we're all fighting for our basic  
rights as citizens.
