35 Years Later

TOKYO ROSE:

Isami Arifuku Waugh

Former prosecution witnesses in the
"Tokyo Rose" trial have recently ad-
mitted to a Chicago Tribune Reporter
that in 1949 they were coerced into
testifying against Iva Toguri and
were coached two hours a day for a
month before the trial. They now
state that she did nothing treasonous
as Toguri has maintained all these
years.

If anything, "Tokyo Rose" was the
personification of fantasies which
Allied soldiers had regarding Asian
women during World War II. The leg-
end is that a seductive-voiced woman
broadcast over Radio Tokyo, mingling
the newest American popular records
with accurate predictions of Allied
movements and imploring the Allied
soldiers to give up fighting, telling
them that their women were cheating
on them, and creating feelings of
homesickness and demoralization. De-
pending on the listener, she spoke
with a British accent, Japanese ac-
cent, American accent, or a combina-
tion of languages and accents. Belie-
vers in the "Tokyo Rose" legend str-
essed the propagandistic intent of
her broadcasts. Speculation about
the nationality and appearance of the
legendary "Tokyo Rose" was part of
the experience of fighting in the
Pacific.

Iva Toguri did in fact broadcast
over Radio Tokyo to soldiers in the
Pacific. However, coached by and
reading scripts written by Allied
prisoners of war, she was convinced
that she was in fact entertaining
Allied troops in the Pacific, and
aiding in the war against Japan.

Born and raised as very American in
Southern California, Iva Toguri was
the daughter of Japanese immigrants.
She was sent to Japan in July 1941 at
age 25 to help care for an ailing
maternal aunt, though she did not
speak Japanese.

After war broke out between Japan
and the U.S., she was constantly har-
assed to give up her U.S. citizenship
but stubbornly maintained that she
was an American and would remain so.
As a result, she was denied a food
ration card, and her finances depleted.
She secured part-time jobs which pro-
vided an inadequate income on which
to live.

She finally found employment as a
clerk at Radio Tokyo where she became
acquainted with Allied prisoners of
war forced to broadcast on the radio.
When a woman announcer was needed on
the Zero Hour, the POWs specifically
asked for Iva Toguri to broadcast
with them since they knew of her
strong pro-Americanism. At first
refusing, Toguri was threatened by
authorities and talked into partici-
pating by the POWs who convinced her
they were subverting the propaganda
intent of the program. She first
broadcast in November of 1943; Allied
troops already referred to a "Tokyo
Rose" in December of 1941. It should
be pointed out that there were many
women and men broadcasting from Radio
Tokyo, many of whom were U.S. citi-
zens.

With the end of the war, journal-
ists descended on Tokyo seeking the
legendary Tokyo Rose only to find
that there was no such person. Each
found a woman to interview claiming
this was "The Tokyo Rose". The rea-
sons why are not clear, but Iva Tog-
uri became most closely associated
with the legend. She was arrested by
the U.S. Occupation Forces and incar-
cerated for over a year pending in-
vestigation. During her year in pri-
son, she was allowed visitors for
only 20 minutes a month, and no legal
counsel. When the Dept. of Justice
concluded in 1946 that there was no
case against her, she was released.

Not having seen her family since
1941, and wanting her baby born in
the U.S., Iva Toguri attempted to re-
turn to the U.S. in 1947. When news
of her application to return was re-
leased, various groups launched a
vigorous protest to prevent her re-
turn. The State Department could do
nothing, it said, to prevent her re-
turn since she had been cleared by
the Army and Dept. of Justice of any
wrongdoing. The opposition to her
return resulted in a new effort to
prosecute Toguri for treason. The FBI
issued a press release to major news-
papers in the country that any person

who could identify the voice of Iva
Toguri should immediately contact
their local FBI office. Toguri was
arrested again in 1948 and shipped to
San Francisco, a center of anti-Jap-
anese activities, to stand trial.

She was tried and convicted by an
all-white jury in the summer of 1949
upon the testimony of two turncoats
who had renounced their own U.S. cit-
izenship, and for whom she had worked
at Radio Tokyo. Ten years in prison
and $10,000 was her sentence, plus
automatic loss of the U.S. citizen-
ship she had previously refused to
renounce. Upon release from Alderson
Federal Prison in January 1956 she
was served with a deportation notice.
For two years, Toguri was harassed
by the government until it was deci-
ded that she could not be deported
since she'd claimed U.S. citizenship;
if she had not been a citizen, she
could not have been tried for treason.
Her status now is that of a stateless
person. Her husband resides in Japan
while here to testify in Toguri's
trial, he was forced to sign a state-
ment saying he would never re-enter
the U.S.

Time has affirmed Toguri's claim to
innocence. The charges now appear to
be vague and inconsequential; the ev-
idence and witnesses presented at the
trial unreliable. Reporters covering
the trial were convinced she would be
acquitted. The prisoners of war who
wrote her scripts were cleared by the
military of any wrongdoing. Now, pro-
secution witnesses state they were
coerced to testify against her. It
raises questions about the origins of
the legend of "Tokyo Rose", why the
legend persists today, and how Iva
Toguri intersects with it.

One can speculate about the rela-
tionship of the case to world or nat-
ional events. However, it is as an
Asian woman that she has been perse-
cuted. It is the image of Asian women
which predisposed Allied soldiers to
believe the legend of Tokyo Rose, and
led some to testify against Toguri in
1949. Those informed of the case are
convinced of Toguri's innocence, but
the legend is still alive in others.

As an Asian woman, Toguri's case
was affected by almost a century of
anti-Asian feelings and stereotypes
which exist to this day. Her exper-
iences coincided with one of the
peaks of those feelings.

Chinese-Americans were victims of
anti-Asian sentiments even as the
West coast was being developed. At
the turn of the century, the image of
Japanese became that of potential
spies for Japan, a result of increas-
ing Japanese population in the U.S.
and Japan's empire building efforts.
Stories in the San Francisco Examiner
(Jan. 1 & 10, 1907) even indicated
that Japanese immigrants were Japanese
soldiers in disguise. Behind such
stories is a racist assumption that
Third World people cannot be assimil-
ated into Western societies; even
American-born Japanese supposedly
could not escape their innate loyalty
to the emperor of Japan.

As Japan's imperialistic ventures
continued in the 1930s, stereotypes
of Asian women evolved, culminating
in the comic strip caricature known
as "Dragon Lady". She wore slinky,
form-fitting clothing and brandished
long cigarette holders. She was ruth-
less, cruel, intelligent, and seduc-
tive. Through her femininity she at-
tempted to corrupt white American men
with the values of other political
systems.

(Stereotypes of Asian women have
never been realistic, but have chan-
ged through the years. The sexy, sed-
uctive image has persisted. Another
example of the early 1900s was the
Native Sons of the Golden West who
characterized Japanese women as mind-
less "beasts of burden" for their
long hours toiling in the field and
raising families. This was similar to
the overall image of Asians working
as automatons in the service of a
conquering emperor. A later image,
popularized in films, was that of the
obedient, quiet, humble, asexual
woman, continually serving others.
None of these one-dimensional images
accurately depicts the experience or
lives of Asian women then or now.)

True Story of a Drunken
Nancy Lee Hall

This excellent book is about a wom-
an who tries to kill the pain of her
existence with alcohol. It is about
a woman who marries not only a man,
but also the navy. Nancy Lee Hall's
fictionalized autobiography is a sto-
ry which would not be heard without
a feminist press. It speaks for all
women who came of age during WWII and
of their lives which were all too
often given over entirely to babies
and men, particularly to men in uni-
form: "men who deserved everything!"
In the straightforward language of
this book, the reader travels with
Nancy through constant moving, child-
birth, fights, lack of money, and in-
adequate government housing. Nancy,
without psychoanalyzing, tells of
her efforts to be a good mother and
wife (Each time that they moved, she
knew that things would be all right
this time if only....); and her in-
credible suffering and guilt over not
attaining that image. This is a pow-
erful book in the depth of Nancy's
struggle--and the extremes to which
she goes before being able to effec-
tively fight back. I think many of
us can empathize with the desire to
escape a painful reality, whatever
our differing escape routes may be.

This book is also about the lives
of her six children, and how they
managed to bring up each other and
their mother. One of the most
frightening scenes in the book is
when one of Nancy's children, Mary,
complains that her father put his
hand between her legs and she is
scared of him. Nancy is basically
powerless to defend her children.
In her heroic battle against her en-
emy, the bottle, Nancy still carries

Mother

a childhood dream of greatness with
her, which surfaces from time to time
to remind her of her potential and
to inspire her.

Nancy's story ends with her batt-
ling her way to freedom and assuming
the responsibility for her life, and
the lives which she has brought into
the world. Her analysis of her sit-
uation is powerful and stunning, made
more so by the unrhetorical nature
of the book. The power of this book
lies in its complete honesty and in
its “real life" events.

NANCY LEE HALL

dovetails neatly with more general
views of Japanese-Americans in the
1930s and 1940s as being potentially
disloyal to the U.S. The basis for
the herding of over 117,000 Japanese-
Americans into concentration camps in
1942 was that one could not distin-
guish the loyal ones from the poten-
tially disloyal. The fact that this
was acceptable to the whole country
is indicated in the very few protests
made at the time. The National Opin-
ion Research Center found in August
of 1946 that two-thirds of all Amer-
icans believed that Japanese-Americans
had spied for Japan, and only 13%
thought that they had no part in aid-
ing the enemy. After World War II,
comic strips such as "Steve Canyon"
and "Terry and the Pirates" as well
as comic books reinforced these
images. In addition, movies depicting
the war years oftentimes had their
version of a "Tokyo Rose" spouting
propaganda to the troops.

In summary, an image of Asians gen-

erally, and of Asian women specific-
ally, as being potentially subversive
was characteristic of those times.
Unfortunately, a woman, Iva Toguri,
suffered long-lasting consequences
of being a victim of the fantasies of
white Americans.

The comic strips and movies are
still in circulation today. They con-
tribute now as they did then to the
maintenance of the legend of Tokyo
Rose, and the continued belief that
Iva Toguri was, in fact, the mythical
figure. The destructive and tragic
consequences of stereotypes can be
clearly seen in her case.

A movement to secure Iva Toguri a
presidential pardon and subsequent
return of the U.S. citizenship that
she refused to renounce during World
War II is underway. Letters of support
for this movement are needed. For

Committee for Iva Toguri, JACL, 1765
