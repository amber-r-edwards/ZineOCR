Living in the Open  
poems by Marge Piercy  
Alfred A. Knopf  
paperback, $3.95  

Rose Z. Moonwater  

This book deserves a quiet  
place where real listening is  
done. The poems describe  
nature intimately: the feel of  
compost, the urgings of the  
sea; “The small things of this  
world are sufficient and magi-  
cal.” Nature as source for the  
growth and death and rebirth  
that is all our struggles.  

The ambivalence in her  
struggles with relationships is  
familiar. She reaches deep for  
the bone of truth hard won by  
experience.  

“When another year  
turns over  
compost in the pile  
last year’s feast  
breeding knots  
of juicy worms,  
I do not want  

to be indicting  
new accusations to  

another ex-lover...  

Of men and women she  
says,  

“I am sick,  

sick to desperation  
of the old defeats,  

of the broken treaties,  
episodes of the same colonial  

war of women and men.  

I want the cavalry to take off  
those bemedaled  

blue uniforms  
the color of Zeus and  

those clanking boots  

clanking with spurs.  

I want the horses to win  

this time and eat grass  

together.”  

These poems are so rich  
with experience crystallized to  
fine points of clarity. They  
illumine the common reality of  
women who are consciously  
struggling with abuses of  
power, with internal condi-  
tioning that is destructive,  
with honest appraisal that is  
risky and necessary.  

From the poem ‘For Inez  
Garcia’:  

“A woman’s horror  

is rooted in being able to say  
yes,  

to say no and make each  
stick fast,  

that ghostly will  

that rises in us  
from the prone corpse of  

our passivity;  
like a resurrection, naked and  

thin and strange,  
spirit of the responsible will  
walking and talking  

from the grave  
of the body that ate the child  
that swelled into the woman,  

that now gives birth  
to her own new holy being  

that carries high  

a sword, a torch, a rifle.  
There is no  

holiness without terror, no Will  

without responsibility and  
consequence,  

no entire person without  
boundaries,  

without doors that open  
and close  

and the will to guard what goes  

out and what comes in.  

Let Inez Garcia, Joan Little  
become  

two faces in a crowd of women,  
an army  

each defending her body,  
defending her sister,  

defending the frail ghost  
of the new whole  

conscious self struggling  
to stand upright  

and walk,  
like a nine-month child.”  

This book shares my life.  
Quotes rise from it when talk-  
ing in the kitchen with the  
women I live with. I am  
hungry for this kind of writing  
— writing from a woman  
which has many aspects,  
which has aged, which is alive  
and in transition. In this book  
along with anger and pain and  
strength, Ms. Piercy sings  
many praises. I now sing one  
to her and say this is a book to  
read again and again.

uncomfortable.  

On the whole Larkin’s  
images are original and evoca-  
tive; sometimes, however,  

they are blithely obscure. She  
can write, for instance, with  
delightful imagination: “Was  
it old music laying gold-leaf  
on the evening?” And with  
squarely-on accuracy that  
“December turns... / the  
leaves to gutter paper.” Better  
yet, in “Uptown”:  

The party foams up around me  
in little unions.  

Where there was a  
clear white room,  
music churns the lump of  
people dancing...  

Yet she can write something  
like “This sidewalk is like the  
dead:/a flat stone ribbon/  
spread on the afternoon,/hot  
and white.” which leaves me  
nonplussed. Or she ends the  
poem “Uptown” with:  

Tears fall into it  
like vaudeville:  

a woman’s drunken bleating  
on the sofa.  

The most annoying thing  
about these last lines is that  
they appear heavy with mean-  
ing; they may, in fact, be  
laden with meaning for her,  
the reader, however, feels as  

if she has been privy to some  
joke which she is not intended  
to understand.  

The book is divided into  
sections: the first entitled  
“Housework,” the second  
“Needs,” then “stop,”  
“True Stories,” and “A Cer-  
tain Notion of Strength.” In  
the last, “A Certain Notion of  
Strength,” Larkin becomes  
political, and these are among  
her most moving poems. She  
writes of the bombed Viet-  
namese villages, and of her  
sister’s rape, from which the  
section takes its name. In this  
poem, Larkin juxtaposes the  
steady, relentless strength of  

water with the steady oppres-  

sion of women, the relentless  
repression through fear.

Most importantly, this book  
is full of poems by women I  
have never heard of. Larkin  
and Bulkin collected poems  
from women all over the coun-  
try, literary women: teachers,  
reviewers, poets, authors.  
These women work with  
health collectives and study to  
be auto mechanics. They are  
printers, painters, mothers,  
and farmers.  

And all of their poetry is  
good.  

Like other anthologies of  
feminist poetry which have  
appeared in the last several  
years, this book performs a  
more important function than  
the dissemination of good  
poetry. As Susan Griffin, who  
is quoted in the preface to this  
book, writes:  

... the risks other women  
take in their writings, casting  
off the academic shroud over  
their feelings, naming the un-  
speakable, moving with cour-  
age into new forms and new  
perceptions, make me able to  
write what before could not be  
written. In every sense, we do  
not work alone.

Nightingale...  
From page 12  

character, to her, was important.  
She felt that it could not be  
ascertained by public exam-  
ination.  

“I have a great horror of my  
papers being made use of  
after I die by ‘Women Mis-  
sionaries’ and those kind of  
people. I am brutally indiffer-  
ent to the wrongs and rights of  
my sex,” she wrote in 1858.  
It’s not surprising that when  
John Stuart Mill wrote to her a  
few years later to enlist her  
support for the movement to  
enable women to qualify as  
doctors, she refused.  

Her reply to Mill was both  

“practical” and single-minded.  

She stated that there were  
enough “first-rate doctors;  
there was a shortage of first-  
rate nurses; therefore, women  
should be nurses. She closely  
guarded the growing nursing  
profession and obviously sup-  
ported the prevailing attitude  
of both her time, and now,

Boulder Feminist  
Theatre Collective  

Theresa Schook  

The Boulder Feminist Thea-  
tre Collective was founded in  
May 1975. Her members are  
Dinah Leavitt, Juliet Wittman,  
and Wendy Lauter. One of  
their stated goals is “to  
express...feminist ideology  
through the medium of thea-  
ter.” The 2, 3, and 4 of April,  
they presented 3 one-act plays  
in Old Main Auditorium on the  
CU campus.  

The first play was Snowangel  
by Lewis John Carlino.  
Making “snowangels” is the  
fond girlhood memory of a  
tired aging whore, Connie,  
played by Juliet Wittman.  
Connie rarely has time for  
pleasant memories as she is  
awakened by customers at all  
hours of the night. A four  
a.m. caller, aptly named John,  
shuffles into her room, meekly  
apologizing for disturbing her  
sleep as she reluctantly pulls  
herself from bed. During the  
course of the play, he becomes  
more assertive, demanding  
that there be tenderness in his  
cash-on-the-line sex.  

His idea for encouraging  
warmth between two stran-  
gers, for getting it up, is for the  
woman to play a role for him.  
He wants her to reenact  
conversations that he once had  
with an idealized girlfriend of  
his, who no longer exists.  
Connie, shouting things about  
her sense of self-respect, calls  
her pimp who informs her that  
since she is aging and losing  
her figure, she must provide.  
Forced by economic necessity  
to be another woman, she  
reacts with hard-boiled sar-  
casm, which is rewarded with  
an attempt by John to kill her  
in a fit of rage.  

Terry Dodd was adequate in  
the role of John. There were  
times, however, when he  
seemed uncomfortable in his  
timing. It was difficult to class  
this play. The subject seemed  
to be one worthy of serious-  
ness, yet Wittman’s use of her  
body was far too overdone,  
making Connie's most wistful  
moments laughable. Timing  
is of essence in comedy, yet  

neither performer had much  

sense of timing. The play  

dragged.  

Perhaps the acting could  
have been improved if the  
script had been better. The  
dialogue was poorly written,  
full of exchanges that illum-  
ined neither character and  
only served to make the  
audience restless.  

Window Dressing, by Joanna  
Russ, was the second play.  
The script was much improved  
over Carlino’s writing atte-  
mpt. Joanna Russ writes well.  
The story involves a store  
mannequin who is kidnapped  
by a semi-moronic employee  
of the store.  

Dinah Leavitt, the mannequin,  
did a truly artworthy job  
portraying a range of plastic  
emotions and thoughts. Terry  
Dodd was much more at ease  
in the role of stuttering  
boy, showing a versatility that  
was surprising. There was a  
sense that two performers  
were on the stage during this  
play, less a sense of high  
school play competitions.  

The third selection was Me-  
gan Terry’s Calm Down Mot-  
her. This play seemed  
alienating as a commentary on  
woman's role. Leavitt showed  
both subtlety and versatility in  
changing from role to role,  
from worn mother to aged  
daughter to childish prosti-  
tute. Both Lauter and Witt-  
man were overly theatric with  
their gestures.  

Acoustics in Old Main were  
very poor. In all three plays,  
there were lines that were  
swallowed by the radiator or  
the walls. Old Main was not  
built for acting.  

During the first intermission,  
a young woman named Muriel  
Coyle accompanied herself on  
the guitar. Her voice was  
delightful, but very few people  
listened to her as she played.  
She received a smattering of  
applause when her set was  
over, but not so much as she  
deserved.  

The Boulder Feminist Thea-  
tre Collective invested a lot of  
work in this project. It was an  
entertaining evening. Hope-  
fully, they will be doing more  
plays where they need no  
men. Hopefully, it will be  
soon.  

Ifession, are eminently suited  
to supplementary roles.  

She considered Elizabeth  
Blackwell, an American and  
the first woman doctor, to be  
“inferior as a third-rate  
apothecary of 30 years ago.”  

Miss Nightingale was often  
bitter in her accusations that  
women lacked compassion.  
Ironically, in her personal life,  
she was somewhat lacking  
in this quality. Aside from her  
nurses, friends, and family,  
her experience was mostly  
with idle, upper-class women  
who had little or no social  
conscience. Her opinions  
would always be tempered by  
the narrowness of her views.  

Not to minimize her achieve-  
ments or her place in history,  
it should be pointed out that  
her influence was indirect,  
and her reforms were made  
possible by the help of men  
who occupied positions of  
power and influence. Women,  
in her day, had not the power  
or influence to support her  
struggle.  

She was, in outlook, both  
arrogant and aristocratic.  
Equality, let alone equality of  
the sexes, meant little to her.  
She was often contemptuous  
of women struggling for the  
vote, referring to them as the  
rank and file. A vote would not  
help to achieve her reforms.  
She modestly insisted that the  
only difference between her  
and other women was that she  
worked, and they did not.  

Whatever — discrimination  

she experienced because of  

her sex, her reactions were  
vague and self-contradictory.  
Her ego, lack of compassion  
and fanatic ambition would  
have been enough to make her  
insensitive to the opinions of  
others.  

She was glowing in her  
praise of her male collabora-  
tors and merciless in prodding  
them into action. But always  
she was outside the power  
structure. If she had been  
politically inclined and had  
run for office in direct compe-  
tition to them, her place in  
history might be scant, in-  
deed. Politics is the road to  
power and influence; social  
reform is not.  

Not only did she fear suc-  
cess, she was ambivalent to-  
ward her own genius. She  
wrote in a private note, “If I  
could leave one man behind  
me, if I fall out of the march,  
who would work the question  
of reform, I would be satisfied  
because he would do it better  
than I.” Few women were  
capable of challenging her  
superiority but she never  
aspired that it could be other-  
wise.  

To the modern feminist, it  
might seem that Miss Night-  
ingale was one of the few  
women of her century who  
succeeded in creating the con-  
ditions of her own liberation  
yet consistently refused to  
acknowledge the basic needs  
and frustrations of her own  
sex. A woman of her time, she  
was; a woman of all time, she  
was not.
