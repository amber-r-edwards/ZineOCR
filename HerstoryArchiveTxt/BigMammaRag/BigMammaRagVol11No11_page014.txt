Shock

frightening. It was a little
like having secret meetings
and clubs when you're a kid.
Ex-"mental patients"--like
ex-prisoners--are not sup-
posed to hang out together
after you get out. Easier to
control us when they keep us
separated I think. It seems
like it is just the opposite
with alcoholics in recovery--
they are supposed to hang
out together. I think it all
has to do with how best to
control people, adjusting
them to society.

As the Women's Psychiatric
Inmates Liberation Front we
got involved right away in
fights in the women's com-
munity over feminist thera-
pists, psychiatric interven-
tion and takeover of women's

issues like rape and batter-
ing, and how we think about
people in pain.

As the Liberation Front we
attended a Denver women's
community meeting (see BMR
Oct. 1983) called by RAPP--
the Rape Awareness and Assis-
tance Program. We had heard
that women were being "of-
fered" psychiatric institu-
tionalization if "out-pa-
tient therapies" weren't
enough, if the rape victim
was not handling her rape
adequately. We asked that
if they were going to refer
rape survivors to therapists
who lock people up that RAPP
take a position against rape
in prison and psychiatric
institutions. That they
start support groups for rape
survivors with no profession-
als or therapists involved.
We actually had to ARGUE
with "feminists" to take a
stand against rape because
they did not want to be af-
filiated/connected to any
of the politics against psy-
chiatry that was coming out
of the Women's Psychiatric
Inmates Liberation Front.

It was a real painful meet-
ing for us as political ex-
inmates-- I felt like we
had been to a public exec-
ution with no "actual" body
count. It was like my night-
mare-- we were the bad men-
tal patients who would keep
women from getting "help".

Saturday, Oct. 22, 1983
was chosen as the North Am-
erican Day Of Demonstration
Against Electroshock. Demon-
strations were held in:
Denver, CO., Boston, MA., To-
ronto, Canada, Lake Worth,
Fla., Philadelphia, PA., and
Syracuse, NY. In Denver the
Women's Eye Liberation Film
Festival Committee in soli-
darity with the demo and
Women Psychiatric Inmates
Liberation Front showed the
film "Hurry Tomorrow" by
Richard Cohen and Kevin Raf-
ferty. The film exposes

Hospital in Los Angeles.
Readers Theatre by Dee, Mar-
ti, and Susanna allowed the
voices of those tortured by
shock to be heard. Unfortunately not many people came.
This was Friday, Oct 21st.

On the 22nd about 60-70
people came to join us in
the picket in front of Colo.
General Hospital and later
Mt. Airy Psychiatric Center
a few blocks away. Guerilla
Theatre was done against
shock treatment in front of
Colo. General.

At Mt. Airy we managed to
get some of our leaflets to
inmates. One inmate contac-
ted us. She had taken our
phone number off the leaflet
before the staff searched
her room to confiscate it.
Amidst an argument between
her and staff--about don't
you know better than to talk
to strangers--she was forced
into seclusion the afternoon
of the picket because the
staff had seen her take
a leaflet from us. Said the
staff was pissed and they
would take it out on the
inmates. Inmates in any ins-
titution are totally vulner-
able to the moods of the
staff/guards/attendants. And
we--the public--allow for
this because of what we are
taught to think of prison-
ers and “mental patients",
and the "cause" of their of-
fense against society.

In the last month I was
living with broken glass on
my living room floor for a
little less than 3 weeks. I

started one night to throw
my dishes against the wall
and broke a few at a time
for weeks. Seemed silly.
Collected the sharpest pie-
ces and had to cut myself
some. Pain to ease the pain.
Then it ended--I bought a
broom and dustpan and swept
it up. I miss it sometimes,--
a reminder of?

All this is connected to
organizing the demonstration
against shock--being a "men-
tal patient" in public,
small painful interchanges
in the women's community
around ex-inmate politics in
Denver. A friend being
raped, and confronting the
oppressive and often deadly
politics of police, psychi-
atry, and medicine that have
come to be too often con-
nected with the women's
movement and rape and bat-
tering and incest.

I struggle not to feel
"symptomatic". My workplace
seems more and more like the
fascists must be in charge.
Undercover narcs at work. If
you come to them (the em-
ployer) with your drug or
alcohol problem, they will
grant a leave of absence--
no loss of seniority--if you
enter an approved drug or
alcohol rehabilitation/lock-
up program. (To get you off
street drugs and on state
drugs.) Psychiatry is every-
where--industrial psychology
for controlling the workers.
When I figured to end my
nightmares by doing ex-in-
mate work in May. It "saved"
me. The reality that I am
left to struggle with is
that all my politics and
panic can't seem to change

things and self fast enough
to keep me from turning my
pain and rage against myself.
You could say I am "clin-
ically depressed." My psy-
chiatric files say I am dia-
gnosed as: "severe neurotic
depression", “history of
parent loss by death", "re-
active depression", and
“borderline personality."
And I was locked up for try-
ing to kill myself. I carry
rope with me now. At the
RAPP community meeting I men-
tioned before one issue that
was briefly raised--and then
dropped--was “forced inter-
vention in suicide." We con-
tinually debate at what
point/why do you call for
the cops and the reality
police (shrinks) and take
away from someone the small
amount of "power" we do
have...Like at some magic
line psychiatry changes from
bad to good. For our own
good? I tell you I am fright-
ened, frightened but that
psychiatric intervention
could not begin to touch or
diminish it--only cloud it
with drugs or something.
ECT (shock) is frequently
used as "Suicide interven-
tion." My best friend at the
hospital always had to break
out the small panes of glass
in the dormitory with her
fist. Sometimes it hurt worse
than others. Once she hung
herself--she had been hang-
ing for minutes and was un-
conscious--and they cut her
down, "saved" her. She had
been in and out of institu-
tions for years, she thought
enough, and they said no.
She was an alcoholic and
they also hooked her to
