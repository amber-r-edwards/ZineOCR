Southern Organizer Charged

Klan Alleges Kidnapping

Linda Fowler

Bessie Lou Cornett was
arrested on July 14, 1975, in
Harlan, Kentucky, and charged
with “kidnapping by force”
Kathy Lee Ball, wife of Paul Ball,
a leader of the Ku Klux Klan in
the Harlan area. The arrest
marked the escalation of long-
standing tension between Cor-
nett, a labor leader and sup-
porter of minority rights, and
Harlan coal mining operators,
city officials, and the Klan.

The 27-year-old Ms. Cornett, a
native of Harlan, was a leader in
the Brookside miners' strike and
the Pikeville Hospital strike in
Harlan County in 1974. She and
other leaders in those strikes
were arrested, badly beaten, and
charged with felonious assault
on a police officer. During the
court proceedings that followed,
the defendants were warned not
to cause any more trouble in
Harlan.

The Harlan Labor News, of
which Cornett is a staff member,
published its first issue during
those 1974 strikes. As a sup-
porter of labor and Black people,
the News, as well as Cornett, has
come under constant attack
from coal operators and city
officials of Harlan.

Segregation through
Urban Renewal

The Ku Klux Klan began to
surface in the area after the
Harlan Labor News exposed the
City Council's attempts to rid the
town of a large percentage of its
Black population. The city had
begun condemning homes in the
predominantly Black George-
town section of Harlan and had
applied to the Department of
Housing and Urban Develop-
ment (HUD) for $400,000 in
urban renewal funds for that
area. Through the efforts of the
Harlan Labor News and the
“Save Georgetown Committee,”
which the News started, a suit
was filed on June 19, 1975,
against the Harlan mayor, the
City Attorney, and the City Coun-
cil members, charging them with
covertly forcing Blacks out of the
city of Harlan.

On June 30, 1975, Harlan,
which had been the number
twelve priority for HUD funds,
was denied funding for urban
renewal because, according to
HUD, there had been: 1) no
relocation arrangements made
for residents whose property
had been condemned, and 2) no
community involvement in the
planning of the project.

KKK Terrorism
and Kidnap Charges

Shortly after the June 30
announcement, many resi-
dents of Georgetown and some
Harlan Labor News staff
members began reporting what
they said were acts of terrorism
perpetrated against them by the
KKK.

Bessie Lou Cornett then
petitioned the City Council to
take a public stand against the
Klan. In response to the request,
Hiram Brock, the Harlan City
Attorney, stated, “If the KKK is
after people like you, I'm for it.”
The kidnapping charges followed
a few days later (July 14,
1975).

Ms. Ball, who brought the
charges, claimed she, her two
children, and a neighbor were
abducted by Cornett and an
unknown man and taken across
the state line into Virginia where
they escaped and returned to
Harlan.

While Cornett was in jail
awaiting bail, the situation in
Harlan became tense. A
vigilante group, Citizens
Deputies, called the jail hourly,
reports say, to inquire if Cornett
had posted bail and been releas-
ed. The KKK scheduled rallies to
be held in the following days in
Harlan and neighboring Paducah,
Ky.

Support and Further
Harassment

Meanwhile, a Support com-
mittee for Cornett began
organizing. The Black Congres-
sional Caucus offered its sup-
port, as did many individual
senators and congresspersons.
The International Black Appeal
set up a defense fund for Cornett
and the Ky. NAACP agreed to
send in an investigatory team to
ensure Cornett’s safety while in
jail.

Ms. Cornett was released
from the Harlan jail the after-
noon of July 16. As she, her
lawyer Daniel Taylor, and a
friend were leaving the jail, the
jailer gave a signal and a man
with a gun emerged from the
crowd outside the jail. Before
any shots could be fired, Taylor
and Cornett ducked into a nearby
bathroom. The friend secured a
car and the three left Harlan by
back roads.

Legal Recourse Taken

On August 5, 1975, after
investigation into the kid-
napping charges, the FBI
arrested Kathy Ball and charged
her with bringing false charges
against Cornett, a felony which
comes under federal juris-
diction.

Ms. Cornett’s case, as it now
stands, has four aspects: 1)
defending her on the kid-
napping charges, 2) defense on
charges which came out of the
1974 strike action, 3) follow-up
on the FBI case against Kathy
Ball, and 4) bringing a suit
against Kathy Ball and the Ku
Klux Klan, if possible, for filing
false charges against Cornett.

The International Black
Appeal has raised approxi-
mately $8,000 to date, with most
of the funds having already been
used for Cornett’s defense ef-
forts. More is needed. If you

Women should make their own
decisions about their own
bodies, with full knowledge of all
options. Working toward this
end, counselors are specially
trained to advise on all facets of
the abortion. A weekly birth
control clinic is also held. They
say their services are the lowest-
priced in the area.

Women from all over the
western slope look to Boulder
Valley for help in getting their
abortions. Eight to 100 abortions
are performed at the clinic each
month and 30 women per week
participate in the birth control
clinic.

Hostility

The clinic staff is amazed at
the hostility that is directed at
women. Purvis said that they
were being picketed as a symbol
of both the feminist and the
abortion movements. The
picketers have called the clinic
the epitome of both. Purvis was
angered at the people who want
to take the right to safe abortion.

Over 100 women, including
many well-known feminist
writers and representatives of
over ten women's presses,
gathered recently at A Woman's
Place in Oakland to discuss
publishing with June Arnold and
Parke Bowman of Daughters,
Inc.

June and Parke pooled their
money in 1972 to start
Daughters, and since then have
published twelve novels and
become one of the best-known
and well-distributed women’s
publishing houses in the United
States. Currently, June, Parke,
and Bea Zimmet do all the
reading and selecting of manu-
scripts, editing, book production
and design, promotion, distri-
bution, and day-to-day work
involved in running a publish-
ing house. The actual printing of
the books is done by the lowest
bidding local printer.

One reason for their visit to
the west coast is that June and
Parke are interested in learning
about the actual printing aspects
of production that The Women’s
Press and others are doing.

From the start, Daughters has
limited its scope to the publi-
cation of feminist novels, a need
that June, being a novelist, felt
has not as yet been met. Initially,
they received novels with tradi-
tional and non-feminist themes
that had been rejected by the
male press. They now average
five to ten manuscripts a week
with well-developed feminist
content.

Of these, the majority are
about the difficulties of living
with men. June said, “They are
all more or less the same story.”
Daughters gets very few black,
third world, or lesbian novels,
and June particularly urged
writers in these areas to submit
their work.

Daughters views the women’s
press as a means of discovering
women writers. A quality of
wholeness has developed in
women’s writing which is es-
pecially evident when a book has
been handled at all stages by
women. The primary criterion
for selecting books for pub-
lishing is that they excite and
appeal to June and Parke. They
must also speak to issues that
they feel are important. Books
offensive to their political stan-
dard are obviously rejected.
June said of The Ripening Fib,
for instance, “It is the type of
book that the CIA would print
and distribute overseas to show
how awful U.S. lesbian
feminism is.”

Business and Politics

Daughters was not prepared
to be a commercial press when
Rubyfruit Jungle became pop-
ular and forced them to grow.
They had to struggle to remain
faithful to their politics, with
such issues as whether to adver-
tise in the New York Times and
their stand on free competition,
while handling a rapidly growing
demand.

An issue relevant to all
feminist businesses is how
much money and business one
can handle without becoming
corrupt. Whether size is neces-
sarily relevant to corruption was
discussed. One idea is that
women’s groups tend to grow
large while still calling them-
selves a “collective” when, by
virtue of their size, that is a dis-
honest label. The problem, it is
thought, is that women tend to
talk “big” but still think “small.”

Judy Grahn commented that
we shouldn't use the phrase
“small press” in reference to the
women's press. Daughters has
sold more than 10,000 copies of
each of their first five novels and
over 43,000 copies of Rubyfruit
Jungle, which is much more
than male publishers do as an
average. Shameless Hussy
Press has been publishing for
over seven years and is also no
longer a small press. June and
Parke stressed that women’s
presses are not “alternatives”
but the only.

According to June, the male
press has stopped growing and
is going bankrupt through com-
petitive practices such as accep-
ting women's books so other
companies don't get them and
then not promoting or distribut-
ing them. One example is Loving
Her, a novel by Ann Scockley
about an interracial lesbian
couple. It was published by
Merrill and is not being
promoted or distributed.

Recycling Support

June and Parke are con-
cerned that many women opt to
do business with the male or
“old” publishing houses. They
feel that in building a women’s
culture, it is necessary for
money to be recycled among
ourselves. Daughters has found
that feminist books don't sell in
non-woman oriented bookstores.
The reasons for using the
male press, the promise of larger
distribution and more money,
don't apply to feminist books.
There is no reason for serious
feminists to patronize the “old”
publishing system. Many
women’s presses publish
poetry, art, and calendars. Diana
Press publishes non-fiction and
Daughters publishes novels.
Women’s resources will con-
tinue to grow through inter-
related support.

Daughters, Inc. works in co-
operation with Women in Dis-
tribution and feminist book-
stores, and invests advertising
money in the feminist news-
papers. They rely on reviews in
feminist newspapers to stimu-
late political analysis, pro and
con, and discussion of their
books.

June and Parke feel strongly
that feminist newspapers
should review only women’s
press books. Male publishers
have other means available to
them, but feminist newspapers
are the only way to reach the
feminist population. It is the
responsibility of the feminist
press to make that link in the
recycling of women's support.
June and Parke feel, and in my
opinion rightly so, that the
