The first National Les-
bians of Color Conference,
September 8-11, in Malibu,
CA, brought together lesbi-
ans of color from all over
the country. There were
some excellent workshops
and individual discussions
which addressed the surviv-
al needs of lesbians of co-
lor. This gathering, which

organizing

the conference organizers
worked hard to bring about,
was another step in build-
ing a national movement of
lesbians of color.

However, crucial issues
and serious problems arose
which were not fully dis-
cussed or resolved, with no
adequate time for debate,
plenaries or resolutions.

During the conference,
some women criticized
straight women of color
for being workshop present-
ers, for relating to men
"the enemy" and for not
being lesbian. Others ques-
tioned the right of light-
skinned women of color to
be there and later com-
plained that one conference
organizer wasn't ‘apparently'
a woman of color. The
discussion raged around
"Who is a lesbian of color?"

The organizers explained
they had sent out a ques-
tionnaire nationally, re-
questing suggestions for
speakers. Among the names
often requested were Nellie
Wong and Mitsuye Yamada,
two straight women of color,
who as writer-activists
are respected nationally
for their long history of
fighting for lesbian and
gay rights. Wong, Yamada
and other straight women
were invited and attended
in solidarity with lesbians
of color, thinking they
would be welcome. Naturally,
they wouldn't have attended
if they had been told other-
wise.

These attacks on straight
and light-skinned women of
color resulted from two
parallel ideologies: les-
bian separatism and cultur-
al nationalism: trends
which increase the divi-
sions by race, sex, and
sexuality fostered by our
oppressors.

Lesbian separatism makes
a principle of separation
from men and straight wo-
men, perpetuating instead

of confronting racism and
sexism. Cultural national-
ists consider their culture
to be superior to others
and elevate race liberation
to a priority above other
oppressions. Separatism is a
principle of cultural nation-
alism and this leads to ra-
cist and sexist divisions--
separating us among our-
selves and from our white
allies. Both rigidly define
who is an ally and who an
enemy, not seeing that sex-
uality, race and culture are
interrelated, dynamic and
fluid.

Both ideologies also ig-
nore class differences and
the need for working class
unity based on feminism and
anti-racism. There was not
one workshop on working les-
bians of color. Instead the
focus was on spontaneity,

spirituality, personal growth

and socializing. The tone
was anti-political, anti
collective-action. Some even
attacked resolutions as
‘white and male'. To agree
on proposals for action is
not a racial or sexual char-
acteristic but a means of
organizing.

Lesbians at this confer-
ence often referred to the
search for the sacred 'safe
space' where we are all the
same. This is an avoidance
of confrontation in our com-
munities, in society. Separ-

ation is a retreat which only

a privileged few can enjoy.
Real safety will come by
uniting with all our allies
to defeat the right wing,
capitalism and the patriar-
chy. Lesbians of color have
the potential from our place
at the bottom to do this,
and turn all of society a-
round.

There's nothing wrong with
an autonomous conference for
lesbians of color only, but
if straight women of color
are invited, they shouldn't
be attacked. We hope at fu-
ture LOC conferences, parti-
cipants will respect all wo-
men of color who actively
fight for lesbian and gay
rights, and that we will af-
firm our solidarity with the
color, regardless of skin
pigmentation or sexuality.

On October 15, over a hun-
dred lesbians of color ga-
thered in Berkeley at the
Pacific Center. There was a
discussion of the LOC Confer-
ence, and a beginning of ten-
tative plans for the next.

We talked of the need to con-
tinue the unresolved discus-
sions concerning the inter
and intra-group racism, na-
tionalism, lesbian separa-
tism, and how to build
connections among us. This

is an exciting and positive
continuation of what began

at the Lesbians of Color Con-

ference in Malibu.

MONEY MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND and the RayGun boys have
been busy playing with the bucks. Monies that have been/
plan to be allocated - $98.7 million for education & social
welfare, $11.5 billion for foreign aid, $65 million to El
Salvador, with 30% withheld until El Salvador comes up
with the men responsible for murdering 4 US churchwomen
in '80. What concern!

$2.1 billion is reserved for building the MX, $253 bil-
lion is a tidy nest egg that is earmarked for the military
for '84, out of which nerve gas production will be resumed.
The Senate wants nerve gas, the House doesn't. Maybe the
next bomb in the Senate will be nerve gas--you boys de-
serve it.

While planning to produce more nerve gas, US hasn't (so
they say) since '68, US officials showed UN members a
place in Utah they have for detoxifying chemical weapons?
BIG DEAL! With both US & USSR playing with nukes & chemic-
als - not to mention other countries, we wonder what other
joys of warfare they have in mind, & in production.

Truck drivers in $800,000 trucks covering 8
million US miles yearly tote missile war
heads, nukes & components to 125 sites
in 48 states. Under the watchful eye
of DOE - Dept of Energy - & with

Q clearance, the FBI's highest
security clearance, most
drivers & trucks start out
at Amarillo TX. DOE assures

us that the trucks are safe,
Suddenly I feel like dancing
that they've never had an
accident in which the con-
tents posed a threat to the driv-
ers or the public. Nice try but somehow we don't feel safe
knowing you, the trucks & cargo exist.

For all the hi-tech that exists it's comforting to know
that a navy pilot threw secret documents in a public San
Diego trash can. The documents had to do with the weapon's
system of Navy super-jet fighters.

Another incident found hundreds of blueprints, some of
which dealt with the Tomahawk Cruise missile, in a National
City industrial park trash bin.

Lorton Virginia prison found itself holding a file cab-
inet full of “sensitive” papers & top secret documents.
Hey! keep that information coming out. Who wants to be the
next Ellsberg?

Ponder this: there are 50,000 nuke weapons in the world,
the US controlling the largest amount.

Europe has been getting US Pershing Missiles, next year
they will get New Patriot hi-speed air defense missiles to
protect the Pershings. The Army is putting out $11.4 bil-
lion for the Patriot. Seems US needs now to develop a new-
er hi-speed super missile to protect the Patriots. The
Army has a plan to improve the aging Hawk missile batt-
eries, using $349 million. And Defense Sect'y Weinberger
(former head of Health, Education & Welfare) wants $305
billion for the Pentagon boys to romp through in '84.

Missiles make the big guns BIGGER, & when they go off--
will we all be safe from democracy??? Will we be????
