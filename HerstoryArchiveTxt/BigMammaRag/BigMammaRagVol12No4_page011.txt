Conflict Raises Issues For White Women

Ajowa Ifateyo

I am responding to "Where
We're At" (Feb. 1984) in
which you asked for feedback
on your “publicizing criti-
cism of a Black national-
ist movement (APSP) espec-
ially the way the criticisms
were raised and without more
information.

My name is Ajowa Ifateyo,

a member of the African
Women's Committee for Comm-
unity Education (AWCCE) which
wrote and distributed the
leaflet you printed and which
you seem to be having second
thoughts about. You did not
express clearly what problems

criticism

you had with the "way the
criticisms were raised",
and I can’t imagine what
problems you had with the
leaflet unless possibly

you think the leaflet is
the first time Waller has
been confronted with these
charges. The fact that he
has indeed been confronted
is implied by the statement
on the leaflet that "Wall-
er has refused to honestly
and progressively discuss
his brutal exploitation of
black women and has consis-
tently refused to give up
his exploitation and op-
pression of women."

As a member of APSP for
eight years, Central Com-
mittee person and supposed
close "friend" of Waller,

I certainly know of his
financial and sexual ex-
ploitation of women in and
outside of the Party, of
his using the movement as

an excuse not to financial-
ly or emotionally support
his children and his phy-
sical brutalization of my-
self and the last two known
women who had children from
him-- all of which was done
under the guise of his be-
ing "pro-women." Several
former APSP people have
been attempting to publicly
and openly struggle with
Joseph Waller (aka Omali
Yeshitela) since 1980 when
he brutalized and threat-
ened to kill me and Aziza
Ayoluwa, one of the women
he was having a personal
relationship with and mot-
her of his then eight-
month old daughter.

Waller refused to acknow-
ledge that he did anything
wrong, refused to make a
self-criticism for his at-
tack, destroying Party mat-
erials and other destruc-
tive and dehumanizing acts
(not to mention go through

a rectification process

for his crimes), refused
to attend a scheduled dis-
ciplinary hearing and as a
result was subsequently
expelled from the organi-
zation. Adamantly refusing
to abide by the majority
Party decision, Waller at-
tempted to discredit myself
and others, threatened vio-
lence against the remaining
Party members, and had the
all-white African People's
Solidarity Committee
(APSC) withdraw the
funds that the national of-
fice was dependent on at
the time for most of its
projects, including the
journal, The Burning Spear.
I went through all this
background to show you that
the struggle with Waller is
a four-year struggle, that
it was first attempted with
him, but because he has con-
sistently refused to struggle
principally, the struggle
was then taken to the gen-
eral movement.

You mentioned that you

didn't have a lot of inform-
ation about what the struggle
involved, and that seems to
be part of your regrets about
having printed our leaflet.
I should apologize because
when this struggle around
Waller's brutalization first
happened (which led to the
majority of the membership
withdrawing rather than be
involved in violence over
control of APSP) I promised
to write an article for Big
Mama Rag, but because we
were busy recuperating from
such a devastating personal
and political blow, as well
as trying to write a "State-
ment of the Movement", I
never got around to it.
However, I am pretty sure we
sent you a copy of the state-
ment.

I want to respond to the
criticism raised of you by
a woman purporting to be a
member of the DISBANDED
African People's Solidarity
Committee and your confusion
about whether you should
have printed AWCCE's leaflet.
You were correct, in my
opinion, to assume that the
struggle had been opened up
to the general movement.

It has for some time. You
state that you received cri-
ticism from this APSC woman
for “not checking out the
charges against Joseph Wal-
ler and the APSP." Who would
she have you "check" with --
the PERPETRATOR of the vio-
lence? I am one of the
VICTIMS -- and the leaflet
which was signed by me said
that he brutalized us (as
well as the "Statement to
the Movement", and a pamph-
let done by another former
APSP member Linda Leaks, en-
titled "APSP Defaults of
Women's Rights")

Like most attackers, Joseph
Waller has consistently den-
ied his physical brutaliza-
tion in private, instead
choosing tactics to avoid
criticism and self-criticism
such as charging Linda Leaks
(his ex-wife and former com-
rade) and myself with being
FBI agents, "lesbian separ-
atists" and "bourgeois fem-
inists". In public he has
adamantly refused to even
comment on his beating and
subsequent dictatorial anti-
Party and egotistical actions.
(Recently the SPEAR has been
printing a shameful series
of articles that still do
not contain ANY statement

- not even a denial -- of
Waller's dastardly attempt
at anti-woman terrorization.
Instead we are carefully
connected to the FBI!)

I, the victim of this par-
ticular charge of physical
attack, am stating again for
your benefit that Joseph
Waller (Yeshitela) attacked,
threatened to kill and other-
wise terrorized me and others
in the Party. I also know of
specific instances or have
information about other in-
stances of his exploitation
of other women, and am in
close contact with women
who have been exploited and
victimized by Waller.

Secondly, I am very annoyed
at your apparent inabil-
ity to see through this
charge of "furthering the
interests of the state by
printing slanderous charges
against a ‘Black Liberation
Movement’ (APSP!)." Can
black people/groups do no
wrong? Can a criticism be
made of a political forma-
tion/individual without the
FBI supposedly directing it,
or it furthering their inter-
ests? How are groups held
accountable, especially
when they are involved in
anti-woman terrorism, or
sexist exploitation or eco-
nomic exploitation of the
"movement" or any of the
other actions that stifle
the progress of the strug-
