Friendly

kind of an attractive but basically
estranged way--but never really talk.

Judy: And any two bodies can fill in
the slots.

Eileen: As long as they're attrac-
tive...I don't think that women and

men really like each other. You go

to a party and the men sit in one room
and the women sit in another room--
they really don't talk about the same

things, they don't talk the same lan-
guage.
Kate: They really don't talk to each

other except one-to-one and: lord
knows what they talk about then.

Pat: When I meet somebody that I find
interesting, I'm interested in getting
to know her and what she has to

say about a lot of different things. I
don't know what people think sometimes
--it's like they only want to kiss a
lot--and I want to talk because that's
really important to me--getting to
know what they're thinking.

Judy: Romance doesn't have to deal
with real people--people who me and
belch.

Lori: People are so bizarre--I think
it's incredible that people get along
anyway, because people's minds are so
incredible--the potential for bizarre-
ness is so great I think it's incred-
ible that we avoid some of it as much
as we do.

Judy:

I think something important
that we haven't talked about is that
relationships as dependencies can be
real positive--that you can depend on
someone to grow with you and not

just help you grow.

Kate: What do we have the right to
depend on people for? Or do we have
no right to depend on people?

Eileen: I think that you have the
right to depend on people for honesty
--beyond that, I don't know.

Vicki: I think you work that out
amongst yourselves, too.

Connie: As you go along.

Vicki: About what your expectations
are and what you require--what you
need and what you are willing to
give. You should be clear about that
from the beginning, but sometimes
that's hard because you don't even
know yourself...The subject of mon-
ogamy vs. polygamy is something I've
been skirting talking about for a
while. I've gone through different
phases where I've been in relation-
ships--I was seeing three different
people, none too closely, for a
while; and then I went through a
period of celibacy for a year and
a half, which I insisted on; then I
was in a monogamous relationship,
although it wasn't called that. Now
I'm to the point with Connie that I
want a monogamous relationship, and

I don't see where that is at all pol-
itically incorrect. It feels really
right for a lot of reasons.

Kate: Why does it feel right?

Vicki: Just because--before I got
involved with Connie I was celibate
for a year and a half. Then I had

a kind of a fling, but when I was
ready to start being sexual again
with other than myself, I was getting
some things clear in myself about
what I wanted.

Lori: I've never been comfortable
with monogamy because I think it's so
dangerous. At the same time, I have
been monogamous. Except when I've
really been fighting, and the rel-
ationship has been bad enough that

Dependencies

we've gone outside the relationship.
Vicki: I know what it is--I feel
like with this, it's really coming
from a position of strength. I
don't feel like my being is consumed
at all--that who I am is given so
much room to grow I want to continue
with that. Before I felt trapped
and oppressed in monogamous sit-
uations, and I don't feel that now,

at all.

Lori: In monogamy I've always felt
frightened, not so trapped, because
I've come to a point that I've been
at for almost a year, where I feel
really socially inadequate, very un-
able to have friends, unable to talk
to people on the telephone, unable

to carry on conversations with people
--I do it, but I still feel unable to
do it even though I do it.

Connie: Because you are in a one-
to-one relationship?

Lori: Well, it's got something to
do with it.
Judy: Lori's always been uncomfort-

able with monogamy. Our biggest
early fights in our relationship were
because I always insisted on mono-
gamy. I finally did consent to non-
monogamy for several reasons; I was
going through a real asexual period
and Lori was sexual. I could see
that our needs were really different
and because she wasn't getting her
needs met she was becoming really
frustrated and hostile toward me. It
seemed realistic for her to have sex
with somebody else. But also be-
cause I still wonder if a monogamous
relationship can continue to meet all
these needs.

Connie: I think there are two kinds
of monogamy. There's capital M
monogamy which means: no other
friends, you focus entirely on one
person--you may have other acquaint-
ances, but not somebody with whom you
invest other energy and other caring.
Then there's small m monogamy where,
it doesn't necessarily have to be
sexual, but you choose to relate to
one other person in a certain way--
it may mean in an emotional way, it
may mean in a sexual way. When I
hear you talking about monogamy, it's
capital M; you're not really getting
very close to anybody else. Although
I think Vicki and I are monogamous in
a lot of ways right now, I break my
monogamy because I have a really
close friend in Pat--we're real
intimate in a lot of ways.

Eileen: But I've still never heard
anyone come up with a reasoned pol-
itical argument to support monogamy.
I've heard people come up with really
good political arguments to support
nonmonogamy. I'd like proponents of
monogamy to come up with a reasoned
political argument, coming out of
strength, to support monogamy.

Connie: I was being as nonmonogamous
as I could before I met Vicki--I
realize now that a lot of it had to
do with fear. I was afraid of some-
one getting to know me very well, be-
cause I was afraid they wouldn't like
me. I think what's happening right
now is that Vicki and I are giving
each other a lot of permission to

be who we are in entirety; and we're
accepting each other for strengths

and weaknesses. Which doesn't mean

we don't challenge each other; I think
we do in positive ways. But I see

it as giving me a lot of permission to
be who I am all the way and to really
start taking some strength from it.

Eileen: But why do you have to be
monogamous to be who you are?

Judy: She's on BUR, she doesn't have
time.
Eileen: I know, but that's coming

from weakness, it's not coming from
strength. It's coming from a lack of
time--from a lack, not a plus.

Connie: I think it's pretty rare to
find someone with whom you can really
feel free,

Eileen: I agree, but why do you have
to be monogamous?

Vicki: What is the difference then?
I feel that I am allowed these other
things, that I am not focusing on

getting all my needs met with Connie.

I'm having needs met elsewhere.

Judy: What sort of needs are you
talking about?

Vicki: friendship, other kinds of
support; discussions, intellectual
stimulation--I certainly get those
met by Connie, but I also get them
met elsewhere. So that pressure is

alleviated--I can do things with other

people if I'm needing to feel social.
If I'm needing to be alone, I have
that time to be alone, and Connie's
not threatened by that. I have never
seen anyone who is happy being poly-
gamous (or whatever the word is) and
that does translate into how you do
your other work.

Eileen: But why is that?
Vicki: I think a lot of poly-
gamous people are doing things they
don't really want to do--that they're
responding out of a certain kind of
pressure.
Connie: A peer pressure.
Eileen: I know that women very easily go into
monogamous relationships. I see all
around women in monogamous relation-
ships, some who've been in them for

a lot of years, or who have been in
several monogamous relationships in

a brief course of time. But still
every relationship is monogamous.

It doesn't seem to me that it must

be that way. It seems to me that it
is that way, that we're raised for

it to be that way, that we're taught
to be that way, but almost that it
mustn't be that way. Because if it's
going to be that way, then how are

we going to deal with the needs of
single women, women outside of mono-
gamous relationships.

Judy: But you could spend all your
time involved with relationships and
not have anything left.

Connie: Or you could spend all your
time in a monogamous relationship
and never get to know each other.
When you step into a relationship
expecting it to be monogamous, as
we've known monogamy, I think that

as well.

Because I think a lot of poly-

But I still don't understand.

you really start cutting back on in-
timacy, or the potential for inti-
macy. But I don't think that has

to be. I'm a proponent, not of

monogamy as we've known it, but of
a different kind. Which requires
a different kind of working out, too.

Eileen: But there's a definite dif-
ferentiation, when you start making
friends with other people, when you
say, this friendship can go this
far, but no further. The friendship
can go up to the point of sex, but

it can never cross that barrier.
From the outset, then, you're rele-
gating all your other friendships to

secondary friendships. 

Lori: But in most monogamous rel-
ationships it seems that sex is more
incidental than that. When you talk
about nonmonogamy, what's the more
threatening thing is not that your
lover is going to go out and get laid
by two other people, but that the
emotional commitment is going to out-
weigh hers to you, which could eas-
ily happen in a friendship--even if
it was only for a while, even if it
was just the intensity of getting to
know someone. That's the more
threatening thing in nonmonogamy.

Kate: I don't think that's necessar-

ily true. I think the implication

is if you end up in bed with some-
