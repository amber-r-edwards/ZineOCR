Health care for women in our
society is profoundly affected
by and connected to the general-
ly deplorable state of the U.S.
health empire. Women’s health
is further complicated by the
fact that we are unique both
because of physiology and be-
cause of the social status we
have been granted in this soci-
ety. The most blatant area has
been the takeover of the obstet-
rical and gynecological fields by
men. Historically this occurred
with the introduction of forceps
and other surgical procedures,
and concomitantly with the
realization that this was a field
where money could be made.
This is the most important area
for us to reclaim, not only for
the sake of pride, but for the
sake of better care of our
bodies.

One crucial step in the return
to medical care of women by
women is the legalization and
support of midwives. Sweden,
the Netherlands, Norway, and at
least eleven other countries do a
better job than we do of
delivering babies as judged by
such statistical measurements as
the infant mortality rate. In all
of these countries except Cana-
da, the well-trained midwife
plays a central role in childbirth
education and delivery. In the
world as a whole, 80% of babies
are delivered by midwives as
compared to 1% in this country.

Since Sweden has the lowest
infant mortality rate in the
world, I would like to quickly
review the procedure followed
there. Ninety percent of preg-
nant women make a first visit to
the doctor during the first three
months of pregnancy. If no
problems are detected, the wo-
man is assigned to a midwife

Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon,
co-authors of the book
Lesbian/Woman, will speak at
the CUDC auditorium (Room
214), 14th and Arapahoe, on
Friday, April 5th at 7:30 pm.
The event is jointly sponsored
by the Gay Coalition of Denver,
the Denver chapter of the
National Organization for
Women, and the Office of

who gives careful prenatal care
with extensive teaching and
home visits. This midwife almost
always delivers the child. Mem-
branes are rarely ruptured, drugs
to induce labor are rare and
instruments are less commonly
used. Many political and social
factors influence this high sur-
vival rate, but good teaching and
care by a skilled nurse midwife
oriented toward preventive
health care is certainly one
important aspect.

In 1971, the patriarchs of our
bodies, the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists
(only 3% women), finally recog-
nized that since 15% of residency
positions were unfilled, maybe
midwives had a place and would
not rob them of all their
substantial fees. Since that time,
every state except Colorado has
legalized midwifery though
many laws still need further
revision. A group of nurses in
this area is now working to get
an interpretation through the
State Board of Nursing and the
Nurse Practice Act which would
broaden the status of nurse
practitioners in the field of
midwifery to allow them to
fully use their extensive training.
The outcome of this should be
known by April. If the current
strategy fails, check Big Mama
Rag in May for what we can all
do to help counter the estab-
lished patriarchal, dollar-minded
system.

Once the legal right of mid-
wives to practice is finally won,
a bigger hurdle may be reversing
some of the prejudices left from
an era of untrained “grannies”
(some great, some deplorable).
We need to look at what a
midwife is today and why she

can give care not only equal to
that given by an obstetrician,
but in most cases better. So put
away any stories you heard from
your grandmother and get ready
to hear a lot more about the
kind of care women in many
countries already have access to,
and the kind of care we all need
and deserve.

One other very large problem
is going to be training. There are
currently only 1,400 American
trained midwives with only 70
new midwives graduated in 1972.
So be alert too for opportunities
to support the expansion of
training programs.

If you have information or
questions, please send them on
so we can get a dialogue going.
I'll be glad to send a good long
list of references to any of you
interested. Most important write
and let us know what you're
interested in hearing more about
or what your problems have
been in the field of women’s
health.

MSC Offers
Women’s
Classes

Nancy Heine

Metropolitan State College
offers Denver Area women one
of the first local Women’s
Studies programs.

Beginning in spring, 1972 with
a class entitled “Women,
Feminism and Literature”, the
program has expanded to
include fourteen classes in seven
subject fields.

Both women and men
students enroll in classes which
trace women’s role from an
historic, political, psychological,
artistic or sociological point of
view.

The program, according to a
recent statement from its
director Dr. Barbara Blansett,
“is aimed at heightening
women’s awareness of
themselves as human beings,
with all the dignity and
potential inherent therein.”

The interdisciplinary courses
are designed to make students
aware that women’s “role in
today’s society is based not on
biological necessity, but upon
cultural biases.”

The MSC Women’s Studies
Program is, as of fall, 1973,

under the Center for Urban
Affairs. Most of its course
offerings are listed under
Women’s Studies in the school's
catalog but a few remain listed
under various other
departments.

Six faculty members together
with six students were elected
fall quarter to democratically
decide the direction of the
program. Financing, courses,
publicity and hiring are
discussed several times during
each quarter by the Women’s
Studies Council.

The program gives three $100
Colorado Scholars’ scholarships
quarterly to students who
participate in Women’s Studies
and who are academically
qualified.

Courses to be offered in the
spring include: “Introduction to
Women's Studies”, “Sociology
of Women’s Roles”, “Eve Image
in Literature”, “T’ai Chi
Chu’uan” and possibly “Women
in American History.”
