Sita

by Kate Millett

Farrar, Straus and Giroux

If you're going through "changes"  
in a love affair and need to relive  
all the nuances of that dinner con-  
versation, closed door, promised  
reunion and your own racing emotions  
as you leaned against the kitchen  
counter drinking coffee the next  
morning, you have probably already  
bought this book.

If not, wait for the paperback  
edition and donate the cash differ-  
ence to the women's presses.

Sita, written after the break-up  
of a three-year romance, a divorce,  
nervous breakdown and numerous sui-  
cide attempts, is an attempt to do-  
cument the exact process of the dis-  
solution of a relationship. It's  
the story of the relationship of  
Kate--feminist, artist, writer--with  
Sita, a woman ten years her senior  
and “all the women I never was":  
mother, grandmother, successful uni-  
versity administrator, European-born  
aristocrat and survivor of three  
oppressive marriages.

If you liked Kate's last book,  
Flying, (I did) you'll probably want  
to read this one, as both have sim-  
ilar strengths and weaknesses.  
Millett has a great eye for detail.  
The effect is, that while she sel-

Culture

dom says anything in one sentence  
that could be said in five, somehow  
it all works. You've been there  
with her, from every sunset to every  
wrong turn off the freeway. The  
pacing of the book also works: The  
short sentences, the fragments build  
mood, as does Kate's knack for in-  
troducing an event, reintroducing  

it later with more detail, and then  
once again, much as thought goes.

Sometimes, though, it stalls.

Eventually the dinners, mornings in  

bed and plane arrivals seem endless,  
possibly because Kate does not bal-  
ance them out with details of the  
events between those intense moments  
with Sita. For example, the class  
she teaches in California--her ex-  
cuse for staying but also her stim-  
ulus--is not really examined. May-  
be I just wanted Millett to write  
a different book this time. Part of  
the strength of Flying was its sub-  
jectivity, its insights into the  
real life of the author, the brain  
who produced Sexual Politics. Sita  
is a continuation of Flying. But  
what are all those unfinished man-  
uscripts on her desk about anyway?  
Somewhere I also wanted to shake  
Millett with some sense of her own  

The Woman Artist

Constance Perenyi

The following is the first in  
a series of articles on women in art.  
The author, an artist, is conducting  
four workshops on Women and Art at  
Woman to Woman October 26, November  
9, 23, and 30. This article serves  
as an introduction for more in-depth  
pieces to come.

The history of women's involvement  
in the arts is a history of frus-  
tration, disappointment, and denial.  
No matter how we look at it, the  
frustration and disappointment have  
always been ours, both as artists  
struggling in a patriarchal system,  
and as sisters in pursuit of her-  
story.

Denial is a more complex issue  
though. Initially, we must deal  
with the conspicuous dearth of in-  
formation about women artists by  
recognizing the editorial powers of  
traditional art history. Male his-  
torians have denied us access to the  
past by ripping our work from the  
natural context of shared experience.  
We are subjected to the painful an-  
alysis of women's work as it com-  
pares to the styles of contemporary  
"masters"; therefore we are forced  
to defend an expression that does  
not measure up to acceptable stan-  
dards of "technical proficiency."

In an effort to survive as artists  
many women have opted to compete in  
the art game by the same rules that  
forbid self-expression. They deny  
themselves as women because they  
want to be winners rather than his-  
torical losers. As a result, for  
many years, the “successful” artist  
was the unsisterly artist, and the  
charges leveled at her as an elitist  
were well-deserved. Yet, feminism  
has begun to touch the art world;  
with its effects, the barriers be-  
tween women artists have begun to  
tumble. It is time to expand the  
horizons of our political conscious-  
ness to include an awareness of fem-  
inist involvement in the arts. This  
is the only way to break the defea-  
ting circle of denial.

First of all, we must realize that  

the artist is much like every other  
woman in that she too has been ruth-  
lessly oppressed. She has created  
in isolation, risking the ridicule  
of a world that is insensitive to  
the content of her work. If taken  
seriously as an artist, she has  

been branded aggressive and unwoman-  
ly; if her work is perceived as  
"feminine," then she is refused ar-  
tistic status.

However, the woman artist has con-  
tinued to create. Although we will  
never open an art history book to  
read about the woman who makes  
prints in her kitchen, or who re-  
cords her daily experiences in a  
sketchbook, we know that these wom-  
en are significant to our legacy.  
They have affirmed themselves  
through their artistic expression;  
in so doing, they began to challenge  
the system that denies their exis-  
tence.

In many ways, we have a respon-  
sibility to the future of women in  
art. Already, artists like Judy  
Chicago and critics like Lucy Lip-  
pard have identified themselves as  
feminists whose lives, both profes-  
sional and personal, are firmly  
grounded in their convictions. As  
Lippard proclaims, she is joining  
the artist who is trying to extri-  
cate her personal expressions and  
universal feminism from the styles  
and prejudices of an antagonistic  
culture. Not only must we support  
these women, but we too must under-  
take the risky, and often painful  
evaluation of our own prejudices.  
The woman artist has been oppressed  
long enough, and now she is turning  
to us as feminists who will identify  
with the iconography of women's art and  
encourage her in her personal ex-  
pression.

Our struggle is just beginning,  
but it is no longer an endeavor to  
be recognized by history. Instead,  
it is the struggle of women giving  
birth to themselves. As a feminist  
approach to art emerges, one message  
becomes increasingly clear: the  
legacy of women in art is an open  
ended source of strength and pride.

privilege. Between trips to the  
airport and to the grocery store for  
chateaubriands and roast chickens,  
she panics at the realization of  
having "only" three years of royalty  
money left before she has to get a  

job. Hard to empathize, when you're  
squeezing in another chapter of the  
book at work.

But, back to the theme. In this  
book, Kate--one of the hopefully-  
not-last great Irish romantics who  
sees the rose fade the moment it  

blooms--plays Persephone, committed  
to building an on-going relation-  
ship with Sita. The plan is six  
months a year in sunny California  
(which, in its phoniness and for-  
eignness to Kate, takes on definite  
tones of the underworld) and six  
months in the ever-gray, but creat-  
ively green art world of New York  
City.

In the true romantic tradition,  
defeat (in love) gets snatched out  
of the jaws of victory (indepen-  
dence). Convinced she can win both,  
Kate leaves for six months in New  
York, and begins to build back her  
strength after weeks of emotional  
turmoil in California. Shortly af-  
terwards, Sita phones with news of  
the final break. And there the  
book ends, one page later.

If you're hoping to discover  
Kate's process of building back her  
self-esteem out of the self-contempt  
and bewilderment that dependency and  
rejection always produce; or, if  
you're hoping to find out just what  
Kate finally makes of it all, all  
this talk of love, jealousy or the  
practice of the theory of non-monog-  
amy, you'll have to wait for the  
sequel.
