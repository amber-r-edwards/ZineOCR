BUT THEY WERE SO MESSY!

ALL OUR LIVES, A Women's Songbook

Baltimore, MD

Theresa Schook

It is, as subtitled, a
songbook of lyrics and music by and
about women. The editors have col-
lected representative samplings of
songs about all facets of women's
lives and listed them under the gen-
eral headings of Contemporary and
Traditional. The general headings
are subdivided into more specific
categories, like “Women with Women,"
"Songs for Today's Activists," and
"Songs of Choice."

The book's layout is attractive.
Photographs of women balance the
texts of the songs, illustrating the
lyrics without appearing contrived
to fit. The technical quality of
the reproductions of many of the old-
time photographs is amazingly clear.
Effective use of blank space around
graphics is also in evidence.

The illustrations used for many of
the songs in the Contemporary sec-
tion are often photographs of the
composers of the songs. In the in-
stance of some of the lesser-known
modern women composers, this added
warmth and a human touch to the beau-
tiful music beside them.

The introduction lasts for ten pa-
ges, explaining why the book was
conceived, how it came to be, and
the editor's reasons for including
the songs chosen. Each song also
has its own short paragraph of intro-
duction. The verbalizing about the
music underscores the research that
went into the production of this col-
lection. In the back, there is a
list of other songs in each category
that were not included in the book
with an index of sources where they
can be found.

Of utmost importance, in the back
of the book is an analysis of the
costs of producing the book and a
letter to a male publishing house

explaining why the editors chose to
be published by a feminist press, the
politics behind the decision.

All in all, the book is beautiful
and an extremely worthwhile invest-
ment for any woman's library, even
those women whose musical inclina-
tions are nil. It is a well-planned,
finely executed item; the editors
and Diana Press are to be commended
for their work.

reach inmates through programs on at
least one of the radio stations that
the women are able to hear.

In terms of accountability, the col-
lective will continue to issue infor-
mation sheets listing the breakdown
of monies raised at benefits and con-
certs. Money generated by the collec-
tive will be used as ‘front money,‘
that is, as deposits for and rental of
equipment used to produce an event.
For the time being, members of Virago
will be using personal funds as ad-
vances for equipment and will be reim-
bursed after funds are raised. Any
leftover funds will be used to sponsor
future advertising and events. Plans
for the distant future include the
purchase of sound and lighting equip-
ment to alleviate the need for rent-
ing. Members do not feel it is fea-
sible at this time to pay themselves
salaries and do not plan to do so un-
less the financial situation permits.

The purpose of the collective is to
share in learning the skills necessary
in the production of concerts, dance
performances, and other events. Feed-
back from the community is welcome
and any woman with ideas regarding
future events should call Virago.
Women interested in working with or
joining the collective should contact
members at 832-1585.

PEOPLE. The

Diana’s Grove Sprouts Coffeehouse

Cheryl

Diana's Grove is a newly formed
feminist collective that is working
towards setting up a women's coffee
house in Denver which would ideally
be in a building that could also con-
tain other feminist projects. The
nine women who make up the collective
have many ideas about what they en-
vision as the possibilities of a
women's building. Some possible ideas
include a darkroom, a theater space,
emergency housing, a library, a clinic,
a press, and spaces for feminist bus-
inesses.

Diana's Grove first began when sev-
eral members of the Lesbian Task Force
of Denver NOW started talking about
where they would like to put their
energies. Because they were dissatis-
fied with the Task Force, and wanted
to reach out to more women, they de-
cided to find out what women in Denver
expressed needs for. They organized
and publicized a meeting for the wo-
men's community to talk about our
needs and future goals.

What came out of that meeting of
about 20 women was a core group of
nine women, and the idea of starting
a coffeehouse. Candy Sweet, Vicki
McConnell, Mary Quintalty, Romey Rain-
water, Jane Hoback, Beth Fuller,
Morgan Starchild, Mary Temple, and
Deirdre Reilly are busy planning ac-
tivities for Diana's Grove.

Diana's first project is a con-
ference being held at the First Univer-
salist Church in Denver on April 1st.
The group wants to raise some money
as its first step in realizing their
goal. In early June, they are planning
to put on a sequel to the play

which was written by Vicki
originally performed at
the meeting. Are you interested in
acting or staging? Contact Diana's
Grove.

The collective is open to input from
Denver women, both ideas and energy.
They are particularly hopeful that
