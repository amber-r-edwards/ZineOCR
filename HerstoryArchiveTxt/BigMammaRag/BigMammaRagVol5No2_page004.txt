Two Years Later, Union Activist's Death A Mystery

Silkwood

By Kathy Riley

Two and a half years after the
death of union activist Karen Silk-
wood in a “mysterious” car crash, her
case has become a rallying point for
feminists and nuclear power opponents.

During the past four months, a
federal damage suit has been filed,
and an extensive article in the Jan.
13 Rolling Stone points to a cover-
up by industry and government of the
circumstances surrounding Silkwood's
death.

Karen Silkwood was a technician at
the Kerr-McGee nuclear power plant
in Oklahoma. She died in late 1974
when her Honda Civic smashed into a
culvert off a highway not far from
the plant. When she died, she was on
her way to meet with a New York Times
reporter to give him information on
the falsification of plutonium docu-
ments—and perhaps a nuclear smuggling
operation—at the Kerr-McGee plant.

As a member of her local chapter
of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic
Workers union, she had already given
the Atomic Energy Commission detailed
evidence of safety and health viola-
tions that caused the radioactive
contamination of 83 workers.

Weeks later she discovered that her
apartment had been highly contaminated
with plutonium, with the highest
concentration of radioactivity found
in the bologna in her refrigerator.

Officially Silkwood's death has
been ruled "accidental": she had
been taking medication and probably
fell asleep at the wheel. However,
an accident specialist hired by
Karen's union produced evidence that
Silkwood's car was forced off the
road. Furthermore, a manila folder—
found near the car and tossed back
into it by a patrolman—is missing.

The Ties That Bind

Editor’s Note:
first of a two-part series, adapted
from a research paper by
Martha Shelley. It has been edited
for length. (See back article.)

Part I deals with the political
structure and working relations
of the Oakland Feminist Women's
Health Center.

Part II will focus on how these
same politics shaped FEN, the Detroit
Federal Feminist Credit Union, and
the collapse of FEN.

Shelley's thesis is that the struc-
ture and operation of FEN, as well as
the conduct of the women behind it,
were fascist and reactionary. She
believes her research and documen-
tation bears that out. We also believe
that FEN's abuses, as detailed in
this series, were primarily a result
of FEN's structure and politics.

In mid-November, I signed a leaflet
which was headed, "We support the
women of FEN." It detailed attacks
which were presumably made on the
Women’s Health Center of Oakland. I
did not personally see evidence of any
of these attacks. In spite of my reser-
vations about the politics of the
Health Center, I felt it necessary to
support them against attacks by "the
Man.”

The leaflet I signed deploring the
attacks on the women of FEN was mailed
all over the country. I now believe,
after weeks of research, that the
politics of FEN are fascist and reac-
tionary. I have reason to think that
these attacks never occurred, or, if
they did occur, were unrelated to the
politics of FEN.

That Karen's case was not quietly
dropped two years ago is largely due
to the efforts of NOW and a Washing-
ton D.C.-based coalition of groups
called Supporters of Silkwood (SOS).
Their efforts resulted in two days
of U.S. House subcommittee hearings
last spring.

Information from the hearings laid
the groundwork for a $160,000 damage
suit filed by Silkwood's father last
November on behalf of her three
children.

The suit charges Kerr-McGee offi-
cials with conspiring to violate
Karen's civil rights; three FBI
agents and journalist-informer Jacque
Srouji with conspiring to cover up
the conspiracy, and the Kerr-McGee
corporation with "willful" negligence
that resulted in radioactive contam-
ination of Silkwood and her home.

The suit also charges that the de-
fendants "used force, violence, intim-
idation, surveillance, harassment,
wiretapping and other forms of illegal
conduct against Silkwood."

In the Jan. 13 issue of Rolling
Stone, reporter Howard Kohn charges
that Kerr-McGee and FBI officials
used accusations of Silkwood's bi-
sexuality to discredit her and to
thwart investigations into her
death. For example:

. James Reading, Kerr-McGee sec-
urity chief, told FBI investigator
Larry Olson that Silkwood “could not
be believed" because “Lesbians don't
care, they'll do anything.” (Olson,
however, continued the investigation
until he was reportedly stopped by
higher-ups in the FBI.)

. Later FBI officials tried to
stop U.S. Rep. John Dingell from
holding hearings on the case before
the House Small Business Subcommittee
on Energy and the Environment. They
reminded Dingell of his tenuous jur-
isdiction in the case and recounted
Silkwood's “unconventional sex life."

The hearings began anyway in
April, 1976. Among other things,
they disclosed that Jacque Srouji,
who wrote a book on nuclear energy
attacking Silkwood, was an FBI in-
former. But the FBI itself was not
forced to disclose its role in the
case. Hearings were to resume in
December, but were cancelled, re-
portedly because the FBI and Justice
Department refused to testify on
grounds they had been named in the
damage suit. At the same time,
Dingell lost his subcommittee chair-
manship after a Detroit call girl
named him as one of her clients.

Kohn's article posits a massive
cover-up by government and Kerr-
McGee officials, partially because
Silkwood apparently had information
on a smuggling ring at Kerr-McGee,
as well as proof that 40 to 120
pounds of plutonium were missing
from the plant. Kohn suggests that
such smuggling would necessarily have
involved “complicity at the company's
upper levels,” and Silkwood may have
stumbled upon falsified inventory
reports.

Kohn offers two theories for the
government's role in the cover-up:
a desire to avoid another scandal in
the nuclear industry, or even more
startling, conjecture that the mis-
sing plutonium was diverted to Israel
by the CIA. (Kerr-McGee had sent a
plutonium shipment, not on regular
consignment, to the "Special Pro-
jects Program” in Hanford, Washington
a few weeks before Silkwood's death,
according to FBI investigator Olson.
The Hanford facility reportedly does
not have a special projects program.)

Meanwhile, activists around la-
bor, feminist and anti-nuclear issues
have been meeting together, accord-
ing to Donna Warnock of the Support-
ers of Silkwood. “And they wind up
going on for hours and hours talking
about each other's concerns."

On November 13, the second anni-
versary of Silkwood's death, suppor-
ters held vigils, marches, benefit
film showings, forums and other
actions.

Sara Nelson, of the NOW Labor
Task Force, has this to say about
the case: "Some women said this is
not a feminist issue; ‘It's a health
and safety issue (they said)—not
sex discrimination’. . But there's
lots of women who are concerned
about dying of cancer because of
their jobs. . She was a union woman
who risked her life—and died—in
the process of doing her job."

FWHC Abuses Presage FEN

where I have failed,
the responsibility is mine.

OFWHC

The Health Center was established in
1972 when Laura Brown and Debra Law
came to Oakland from Los Angeles for
the purpose of opening such a center.
They had other associates, who subse-
quently dropped out.

Laura Brown and Barbara Hoke make
most of the decisions for the center,
have control over the finances and
have the power to hire and fire the
others. I do not know what their
"legal" power is. (I called the Se-
cretary of State's Office in Sacramen-
to and was told that the Health Center
is a non-profit organization.)

Story Of FEN

Representatives from feminist
credit unions from across the country
met in Detroit in November 1975, to
form a national association—the
beginnings of an economic power base
for feminist work. The association
was to provide resources for credit
unions to pool funds and expertise,
and as a funnel through which credit
unions could invest in feminist
businesses.

The result of the convention was the
formation of the Feminist Economic Alliance, while
representatives of Detroit and Wash-
ington credit unions, Diana Press,
New Moon Publications (The Monthly
Extract Newspaper), and the Oakland
Women's Health Center formed the
Feminist Economic Network (FEN).

The differences focused on struc-
ture and immediate goals. FEA sup-
ported grassroots decision-making
and a representative structure, as
well as a focus on building more and
stronger credit unions.

FEN supporters ratified a centra-
lized decision-making structure and
a decision to go ahead immediately
with investments in "profit and non-
profit business enterprises operated
by and for the feminist movement."

Among the controversial items in
FEN's bylaws were these two:

1. FEN will accept financial lead-
ership for the Women's Movement.

2. Decision-making power will be
confined to the Board of Directors
who shall be

a) founders of, and working for
three years in a self-supporting
feminist enterprise...

b) subject to the value audit
system.

The women from the Oakland Feminist
Women's Health Center were influential
in setting up the structure and pri-
orities of FEN.

Controversial from the beginning,
FEN quickly drew criticism from the
feminist community. Ten months after
its founding conference, FEN dissolved
amid charges it had misused women's
money and labor to concentrate power
in the hands of a few.

Currently FEN is paying off its re-
maining debts and the building is in
receivership. The future of FEN is
not yet known.
