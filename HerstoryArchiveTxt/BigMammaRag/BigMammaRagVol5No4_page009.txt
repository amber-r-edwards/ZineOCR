Is FEN Fascist?

Martha Shelley

This is the third and last part of

the three-part series of the research
paper "What is FEN?" written by Martha
Shelley and edited by BMR. (See BMR
issues March and April, '77.) We
contacted the Oakland Feminist Women's
Health Center asking for a copy of

the packet they have prepared in
response to Martha's article. They
refused to communicate with us. See
our editorial on page 4 for further
analysis of this article.

“Whenever I hear accusations such
as ‘too much power in the hands of a
few' I become suspicious that a move
against new ideas is afoot again
within the Women's Movement." That's
Kathleen Barry speaking in the Jan.
1977 issue of Our Backs.

It's been 32 years since the end of
World War II, a whole generation,
time enough to forget the meaning of
one word. Time enough for people to re
vive an old idea and dress it up in
new language.

FEN...uses “middle class” as a
smear label and “working class”
as a compliment.

Fascism does not begin in the death
camps. It isn't a bunch of silly
men who parade around wearing Swastikas.
It is a set of beliefs created
inside each person by an authoritarian
society.

Fascism is not really an ideology;
it is an attitude which is present,
to a greater or lesser degree, in
all of us. It begins with self-
hatred, extends to a contempt for
"weakness" and thence to contempt for
humanity at large.

In its political expression, it has
certain distinguishing characteristics: 1) the belief that the strong
shall rule without being accountable
to the weak; 2) a concentration of
power in a few hands without pretense
at legal restraints or "checks and
balances; 3) unrestrained exploitation
of workers; 4) a racist or na-
tionalist ideology (that some people
are better by birth than others); 5)
the use of violence against dissenters; 6) the notion that military dis-
cipline is necessary to achieve our
aims, weather the crisis, etc.

In every case, FEN passes the test.
With no. 4, all you have to do is
substitute "men" for "Jews" or
“Blacks”.

Let's look at the "New ideas" of
FEN: "People committed to do the
most work and take on the most respon-
sibility will make the most (and final) decisions."--Joanne Parrent. I

agree with that idea, except for the
word final, which is in fact the key
word. It means that women without
the money, energy and time to have
become founders of feminist enter-
prises will be excluded from the
decision-making process, just as is
stated in the by-laws of FEN.

The leaders of FEN are supposed to
be self-selected, by virtue of their
hard work and commitment. Nobody
disputes that these women work hard--
but at what? For whom?

Democracy and socialism are anathema
to the women of FEN. Democracy
means rule by the people and socialism
means economic democracy--distributing
the wealth. Joanne Parrent, in
her article "Sowing the Seeds of
Feminist Economic Revolution" has a
few words to say about democracy.

"Likewise, we recognize democracy
to be a patriarchal concept. It is
merely the housekeeper of our capi-
talist economy. It was developed by
men for men. We will never make the
immense changes that as feminists we
see as necessary by imitating the
structures men have created. If they
do not work for men, why do we think
they should work for women?”

So do we all agree now? Do we
trust our self-selected leaders?

In my opinion, the problem with
democracy in the U.S. is that we
don't have it; the problem with
socialism (or workers' control) in the
Soviet Union is that they don't have
it.

Joanne criticizes democratic femin-
ist institutions as "ineffective be-
cause the decision-making power is
placed in the hands of an elected
body and not necessarily those who
are doing the day-to-day work of the
organization."

On what basis were those people
elected, if not their work? If people
are fool enough to elect shirkers
to office, will they be any less fool-
ish to install a dictator?

She criticizes organizations which
have regional representation. The
FEN women claim that they, as women,
understand the needs and aspirations of
all women. FEN will set up credit
unions for them and find ways to
spend their money. Laura Brown claims
that women cannot oppress other women.
Since she worked 18 hours a day in
the Feminist Women's City Club, for no
pay, why shouldn't other women be
happy to do the same?

But she owned the building. The
difference between her labor, and the
labor of her underpaid, overworked
employees, is the difference between
freedom and slavery... It is the dif-
ference between women really control-
ling our own lives, and someone else
controlling it for us.

Women without money, energy and time
to have become founders of feminist
enterprises will be excluded from the
decision-making process.

Accountability is another word that
has been thrown around a lot. Joanne
Parrent writes, “We believe that we
are accountable to the goals imple-
menting our most creative and far-
reaching feminist visions of what the
world should be, and to those femin-
ists who share these visions and are
working to create them also." Now
what the hell does that sentence mean?
The first part says we are accountable
to an idea. The second part, to any-
one who agrees with us. If you dis-
sent, then we aren't accountable to
you.

The purpose of this blather about
far-reaching feminist visions is to
encourage you to focus on the pie-in-
the-sky of a future matriarchy, and
to forget about the means used in the
present.

Leadership: FEN puts a lot of em-
phasis on leaders, telling us that
we must trust and respect our leaders.

Margaret Sloan: “Laura gets things
done...that's why I admired her so
much.

"She also lies. She says or implies
that she has always been in the Wo-
men's Movement, that she's been pre-
sent at every historical moment, no,
that those historical moments wouldn't
have happened without her.”

Mussolini made the trains run on
time. In fact, he didn't do it, the
Italian workers did. And lots of
women in the Movement have been get-
ting things done for a long time
without claiming credit--or cash--
for everyone else's work.

HOW THEY TRASH DISSENTERS

Let's look at how dissent is treated.

They resort, for the most part, to
verbal attack. Critics are themselves
called “trashers" and bringing up a
political issue is called trashing.
Critics are "downwardly-mobile hip-
pies, middle-class drop-outs who have
nothing better to do than stand out-
side our building and scream ‘capital-
ist pig’.”

What does “downwardly mobile” mean?
In a recession maybe it means any of us
who are out of work; someone who
doesn't want to work for IBM any more
and is putting her energy into a fem-
inist cooperative. That's a good way
to trash someone--while you, of course,
are the hard-working owner of a
business. Raised yourself up by your
bootstraps, did you?

What does "middle-class" mean? Does
it mean that like Valerie Angers your
father owns a steel shelving business;
that your immigrant parents busted
ass to send you to college--and now
you have a superfluous degree and no
job? Or does it mean that you dis-
agree with the "working-class politics
of FEN? What is the label "working-
class"?

The National Socialist (Nazi) Party
started out as a workers' party,
issuing such statements as "It is
the hitherto suppressed class, the
producing people of fist and brow, the
working class, which now enters upon
the stage to fulfill its historical
mission."

FEN offers no class analysis at all.
It simply uses "middle class" as a
smear label and "working-class" as a
compliment.

Moreover, these people talk out of
both sides of their mouths: on the
one hand, they talk about workers'
control, on the other, they exploit
and terrorize the women who work for
them, they form holding companies and
self-appointed Boards of Directors.

Fascism ...is a set of beliefs
created inside each person by
an authoritarian society.

THE VALUE AUDIT SYSTEM

In order to effectively control many
organizations, you need a system of
political and economic surveillance.
Nobody has come forward to state clear-
ly what a “value audit" is, except
that FEN's “value auditors" would
routinely visit and inspect all its
subsidiary corporations. I obtained
a copy of the "Value Audit Analysis
Sheet" and reprint it in full:

Italics are mine. Read this, study
it. Think: Who would want such
information about your group? Its
legitimate and illegitimate activities?
What could they do with that informa-
tion? Blackmail you? Sell it to the
FBI if your whole group resisted dom-
ination?

THE ROOTS OF FASCISM

It would be very convenient--and
tragically wrong--to say, "these women
are monsters. They victimized us." It
is much more accurate to say, "We
permitted them to take over." The
members of the Detroit FFCU allowed
this to happen when they abdicated.
