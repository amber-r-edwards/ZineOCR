For those of us who have been  
searching for signs of vitality in  
feminist culture, there is exciting  
news. Heat Lightning, 114 pages of  
poetry by Heather, has just been re-  
leased by Black Widow Publications.  
What is exciting about this volume  
is that it doesn't pretend to be  
anything it isn't; and because of  
that, it is so much more than we  
have learned to accept from other  
feminist poets.

On the back cover of the book,  
Heather is said to tackle the issues  
of motherhood, romance, sex, race,  
fat, and work, among others. If that  
sounds ambitious, it is. But her  
poems, as the description says,  
are woven together to trace the ups  
and downs of a woman's daily life.  
Rather than isolating a topic with  
a well-now-I'm-going-to-deal-with-  
this attitude, Heather shares her  
feelings and we, her readers, be-  
come equals.

During all my girlhood I saw no  
pictures, no art gallery, no studio,  
but had learned to feel great con-  
tempt for my own efforts at picture  
making. A traveling artist stopped  
in Wilkinsburg (Pennsylvania) and  
painted some portraits; his studio,  
and a new world was opened up to me.  
Up to that time painting had seemed as  
inaccessible as the moon—a sublimity I no more  
thought of reaching than a star;  
but when I saw a portrait on the  
easel, a palette of paints and some  
brushes, I was at home in a new  
world...

Bard, the wagon-maker, made me  
a stretcher, and with a yard of un-  
bleached muslin, some tacks, and  
white lead, I made a canvas. In the  
shop were white lead, lampblack,  
king's yellow and red lead, with oil  
and turpentine. I watched Bard mix  
paints, and concluded that I wanted  
brown. Years before, I heard of  
brown umber, so I got umber and some  
brushes and began my husband's por-  
trait. I hid it when he was there or  
I heard anyone coming, and once  
blistered it badly trying to dry it  
before the fire, so that it was very  
rough work; but it was a portrait,  
a daub, a likeness, and the hand was  
his hand and no other. The figure  
was correct, and the position in  
the chair, and, from the moment I  
began it, I felt I had found my vo-  
cation... I forgot God, and did  
not know it; forgot philosophy, and  
did not care to remember it; but  
alas! I forgot to get Bard's dinner,  
and although I forgot to be hungry,  
I had no reason to believe he did.  
He would willingly have gone hungry,  
rather than give anyone trouble;  
but I neglected a duty. Not only  
once did I do this; but again and  
again, the fire went out or the  
bread ran over in the pans, while I  
painted and dreamed.

A woman's work  
is never done

She says in the introduction, “It  
is not without some hesitation that  
I open up my personal life so un-  
disguised. At least a novelist  
can hide a bit behind the fiction  
of her characters. But there is  
little fiction to stand between you  
and me. Here I am, with all my  
contradictions hanging out." All  
these contradictions make for some  
of the most honest and moving poet-  
ry the women's movement has seen.  
Heather is not an academic who  
approaches words clinically; in-  
stead, she is a real, struggling and  
sensitive woman.

Heat Lightning is divided into  
three sections. The first, "Coming  
Out" shows us Heather as a middle-  
aged woman who is dealing with  
her feelings of attractions to other  
women, feelings that she had not  
reconciled for over ten years. In  
CLOSET, she says:

I was cooking dinner

when the realization hit  
that I hadn't loved anyone  
in the last ten years  
since I loved her.

My conscience began bothering me.  
Housekeeping was a “woman's sphere,"  
although I had never then heard the  
words, for no woman had gotten out  
of it to be hounded back; but I knew  
my place and scorned to leave it.

I tried to think I could paint with-  
out neglect of duty. It did not oc-  
cur to me that painting was a duty  
for a married woman! Had the passion  
seized me before marriage, no other  
love could have come between me and  
art; but I felt it was too late,  
as my life was already devoted to  
another subject—housekeeping.

It was a hard struggle. I tried to  
compromise, but experience soon de-  
prived me of that hope, for to  
paint was to be oblivious of all  
other things. In my doubt, I met  
not marry an artist, but a house-  
keeper." This fitted my case, and  
my doom was sealed.

I put away my brushes; resolutely  
crucified my divine gift, and while  
it hung writing on the cross, spent  
my best years and powers cooking  
cabbage.

Friends have tried to comfort me  
by the assurance that my life-work  
has been better done by the pen  
than it could have been with the  
pencil, but this cannot be. I have  
never cared for literary fame...and  
never been so occupied with it as to  
forget a domestic duty...

Where are the pictures I should  
have given to the world? ... Is  
that Christianity which has so  
long said to one-half of the (human)  
race, "Thou shalt not use any gift  
of the Creator, if it not be ap-  
proved by the brother; and unto man,  
thou shalt ever turn and ask,  
‘What wilt thou have me do?'"

Jane Gray Swisshelm, Half a Century,  
1880.

New Signs Of Life

I had to hang onto the stove  
the pain came on so strong,  
so unexpected,  
in the middle of my comfortable,  
straight existence.

And the poem concludes:

I will fight every day  
for the rest of my life  
to make sure that the grotesque  
waste  
of my last ten years  
never happens  
to anyone  
again.

Overcoming that waste, risking re-  
jection from women friends, and  
opening up her life to their energy,  
Heather comes to terms with her  
lesbianism. Her verse is often e-  
rotic and sensuous, and it is al-  
ways shared, sharable. One criticism  
that I have of a lot of the  
"feminist erotica" I've seen is that  
it is trapped in what it damns be-  
cause it continues to idealize. One  
lover, both lovers, the relationship  
becomes unreal. But Heather never  
objectifies or romanticizes. Her  
feelings are evidenced in I DON'T  
LIKE ROMANCE:

I want to stand here  
in this work-a-day world  
and touch your real face  
with my ordinary hands.

In the next section from which the  
title of the book was taken, Hea-  
ther's writing reflects the changes  
in her life that are, no doubt,  
results of her decision to come out.  
These are not happy poems—most  
are angry, sad, lonely. She talks  
in the beginning about people she  
has lost and she connects with  
the reasons for those losses: "The  
thing I hate most about being white  
is all the people I couldn't love  
because of it." And remembering  
her "freedom summer" working for  
civil rights in the South, she  
says in MS. FANNIE LOU HAMER:

and because I know they have tried  
to crush your face with clubs

I now turn alien eyes  
to the men who fathered me.

The next poems recount a chrono-  
logy of events in Heather's life:  
she tells us of the death of her  
cat (which is one of the saddest  
poems I've read), of the further  
sequence of one thing going wrong  
after another, of moving to a new  
city, of being poor and on welfare,  
and of finally finding a job. In  
JOB INTERVIEW, she talks about put-  
ting on make-up and dressing seduc-  
tively to get a job that she badly  
needs:

Perhaps someday  
I'll have courage enough  
to plunge the knife  
to kill that fawning whore in me,  
But now,  
my well-modulated smile  
doesn't let him see  
the rage I feel  
when I compromise  
my dignity.

And when she gets the job and  
settles into a more comfortable way  
of life, she fears that her spirit  
will be crushed by the "normalcy"  
of her days:

My vital signs grow weak.  
Where has the revolution  
gone without me;  
can I go on without it?

WAITING FOR THE CHANGE, the last  
poem in this section, expresses  
Heather's restlessness, her longing  
for all of us to break out:

Meanwhile women wait  
and count the passing years  
as meals break and dinners cook—

Time is heavy with it now,  
it can't be long:  
I've seen it in the hills.

The final section of the book is  
"Songs of Love and Lust" and is  
dedicated to "lovers and friends for  
both the joy and tears that inspired  
these poems." Beginning with some  
rather tentative love poems, Heather  
moves into the fullness of shared  
growth and love with another woman:

But love goes on in the long run  
and the long run is starting now.  
Can we give each other strength,  
pass courage back and forth?

But, once again, Heather finds her-  
self alone, dealing with more "tears  
left over from my childhood  
and every loss since then.” Moving  
through jealousy, and experiencing  
the ups and downs of hurt and hope-  
fulness, she writes in TILLING THE  
SORROW UNDER:

Today is Sunday, and then will come  
Monday and then will come Tuesday,  
and so on, and so on, and on.

The euphoria that sped time up has  
done,  
and now for the let-down and tears.

But it, too, will pass,  
as slowly and sweetly as days...

But as comforting as Heather's  
words are, they are also challeng-  
ing. Her acceptance of day-in-day-  
out life is far from passive. In  
her own way, she is a fighter: a  
woman strong enough to do more  
than just make it through because  
she never denies her feelings. In-  
stead, she learns from them and  
makes broader connections, saying  
in her introduction: "...each of us  
needs to know that we are not alone  
in our perceptions and our pain  
and to realize that, therefore, we  
are not individually at fault. If  
the personal is political, then  
this is a deeply political book,  
oftentimes a cry of outrage at the  
situations this society sets up  
for me and my children to cope  
with and try to survive. It cannot  
remain this way. My dearest hope  
is that this book will be a mean-  
ingful addition to women's culture  
and our struggle to create a humane  
and loving, maternal world so-  
ciety."

Heat Lightning is certainly a  
meaningful addition to feminist cul-  
ture, and to me is a real sign of  
hope. The volume is a record of  
the challenges that women face when  
we try to survive with our feminist  
vision intact. Heather tells us,  
and bravely shows us how to take  
strength from our feelings:

That's how "our wounds will heal  
us,"  
By sharing,  
and the respect  
that follows.

For nothing short of reverence  
for each other  
will see us through  
the next few years—  
if we really do intend  
to change the world.

With women's first experiences  
in consciousness raising ten years  
behind us, feminists in 1980 could  
forget the power of sharing feel-  
ings. But with a poet like Heather  
to remind us, we stand a better  
chance of seeing each other through  
and working toward an integration  
of our politics and our lives.
