Ms. Carol Lease:  

In behalf of the local  
chapter of Chicana Welfare  
Rights, we extend to you our  
“Mil Gracias” for the very  
good coverage in your news-  
paper. The paper contained a  
good variety of issues and  
made interesting reading.  

We appreciated the editorial  
on the Taimadge Amendment  
and hope to hear from women  
that are interested in helping  
us. We will keep you posted of  
our progress and again  
“Gracias.”  

Muy Agradecida,

Dear Big Mama Rag:  

This is a letter of the spirit  
that you grow in your beautiful  
way, that your paper contin-  
ues its truth and soul. Also,  
the infold poetry on the last  
issue is the best stuff I have  
read in any publication around  
here in years. To your brilliance  
and hard work-  

A buddy  
Ed. Note: We were wondering  
what this letter was going to  
say since it was printed on  
tissue paper! Now, however,  
we just might frame it. Thank  
you!

Dear Big Mama Rag:  

I think that the NOW  
conference (Ed. Note: Held in  
Texas in June. See article p21)  
was a near total disaster as  
were the Sexuality and Lesbi-  
anism workshops. Virtually all  
that was accomplished in  
three days was election of  
officers - the rest of the time  
was frittered away by parlia-  
mentary procedure, politick-  
ing, and factional in-fighting.  
This has definitely got to be  
the low point in NOW’s  
history and from here we  
either move ahead or strangle  
to death. My faith in NOW  
would have been destroyed,  
except that Karen DeCrow, by  
far the most radical of the  
presidential candidates, was  
elected along with a progres-  
sive National Board.  

When the Sexuality and  
Lesbianism workshops finally  
did happen, they were poorly  
organized. The National Task  
Force (on Lesbianism) has  
nothing to show for its 18  
months of existence. As far as  
I know, only five to ten chapters  
in the country have a thriving  
and active Lesbian Task  
Force. Gay caucuses were  
held several times, but I didn’t  
get very many constructive  
ideas to bring back to our  
chapter. I heard one horror  
story after another of mis-  
treatment of Lesbians in local  

COMING NEXT ISSUE: A look inside Canyon City  
Women’s Prison, an interview with a former prisoner, a  
report on one of the first Feminist newspapers in the  
country which was put out by a Colorado woman over 50  
years ago, a new advertising column, an interview with  
poet Diane DiPrima, book reviews, poetry, calendar of  
Feminist events and much more. Goes on sale Sept. 1.

chapters, ranging from un-  
conscious misunderstanding  
to outright oppression.  

NOW has two good resolu-  
tions standing from the last  
two National Conferences,  
but implementation is the  
problem. Many chapters have  
actively disregarded these  
resolutions in order to pre-  
serve their community reputa-  
tion, especially in the vulner-  
able regions where the ERA  
has not been ratified. All in all  
it was a discouraging scene  
and I left the conference with  
more doubts about the Lesbi-  
ans' place in NOW than I went  
with.  

I pretty much feel now that  
the Lesbians in Ft. Collins  
must unite politically as a  
separate group and articulate  
our common oppression. In  
the meantime, Lesbians with-  
in Ft. Collins NOW are  
coming out and becoming  
more and more visible (as am  
I). We can educate and  
influence our fellow NOW  
members on matters dealing  
with Lesbianism, but the real  
action has to happen outside  
the NOW chapter...  

Congratulations on your  
recent publications of BMR -  
they've been packed full of  
good, enjoyable reading.

Dear Brothers & Sisters:  

I am writing to you from a  
Federal Prison Hospital, where  
I am involved in trying to start a  
Gay group. And also in getting  
Gay books put in the library, and  
at least one Gay book sold in the  
commissary. The straight people  
have the Playboy sold to them  
every month when it comes out.  
And there are books on every  
subject except the Gay people in  
the library.  

So if you have any ideas that  
might help me get done what  
I want done and what needs done  
in ALL PRISONS, please let me  
know, I will answer all letters that  
come to me.  

Please excuse the form letter,  
but I am writing to all the people  
that I have addresses to. So that  
I can get all kinds of information  
that will help.

And here's a P.S. we recently  
received from a local woman  
which we can’t omit: My  
husband hates the sight of  
your newspaper. That means  
it must be good, huh?!
