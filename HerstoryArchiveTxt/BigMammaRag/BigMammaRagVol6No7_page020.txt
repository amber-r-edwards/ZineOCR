SQ THAT WOMEN EVERYWHERE may have a  
vehicle for exchanging ideas and con-  
tributing to the creation of our own  
religion, I am starting a publication  
devoted to this purpose. I feel cer-  
tain that many women, both here in  
the United States and throughout the  
rest of the world will want to parti-  
cipate, if we can spread the word to  
them. Your contribution will help  
support this effort. For the Bulletin  
of the Feminist Religion write: Toni

Why Do Some Female  
Athletes Feel the Need  
to Apologize?

Many still consider athletics a masculine activity and —  
so, some female athletes feel the need to counteract that —  
notion by wearing hair ribbons and frilly outfits to as-  
sure themselves and others that they are truly feminine.  
In the current issue of FRONTIERS, a Journal of  
Women Studies, we explore the women’s athletic  
movement and the idea that sports should promote  
self-fulfillment rather than competition or glorification  
of one individual.

FRONTIERS is published three times a year by a col-  
lective of women living in Boulder, in association with  
the Women Studies Program at the University of Col-  
orado.

“Playing Our Own Game: Women and Athletics,” appears in the most  
recent issue of FRONTIERS (Volume III, Number 1) and is available at  
local bookstores or by writing to FRONTIERS, Women Studies Pro-  
gram, Hillside Court 104, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado  
80309. Individual copies are $3.25; subscriptions (2 issues) are $9 a  
year, or $15 for institutions. All subscriptions must be prepaid.
