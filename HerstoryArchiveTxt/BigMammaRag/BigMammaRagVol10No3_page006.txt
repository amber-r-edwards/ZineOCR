Woman Tortured

A young woman accused of  
setting off a bomb in Buenos  
Aires was rumored to have  
been literally put through  
a meat grinder by the Argen-  
tine military government.

CIA and Nicaragua

President Reagan has app-  
roved a broad plan to counter  
alleged Cuban presence in  
Nicaragua, which includes  
encouragement of paramilitary  
action by foreign governments,  
The Washington Post said re-  
cently.

The newspaper said the CIA  
proposed a $19 million plan  
to build political opposition  
to rule by the leftist Sand-  
inista government of Nicar-  
agua and to "create ‘action  
teams' for paramilitary,  
political operations and in-  
telligence gathering in Nic-  
aragua and elsewhere."

Independentista Held

The New York grand jury "in-  
vestigating" the Puerto Rican  
and Chicano-Mexicano movements  
in the U.S. is stalled, while  
a federal grand jury has sub-  
poenaed the financial records  
of the Puerto Rican Cultural  
Center in Chicago. Police re-  
pression continues unabated,  
though.

The wife of Puerto Rican  
political prisoner Felix Rosa  
was standing at a bus stop  
when she was forced into an  
unmarked car by four unidenti-  
fied men, and held captive  
for six hours. While being  
driven around the city, Mrs.  
Rosa was threatened and in-  
terrogated about her husband,  
who is the brother of Puerto  
Rican P.O.W. Luis Rosa. After  
refusing to cooperate in any  
way, she was finally released  
unharmed. Her captors are  
believed to be members of the  
Chicago Police Red-Squad.

Eat Crabmeat

When Susan Benjamin, who  
raises two handicapped sons  
in the suburbs of Chicago,  
wrote to President Reagan to  
protest budget cutbacks in  
funds for educating the hand-  
icapped, the White House sent  
her two eight-by-ten glossy  
photos of the Reagans, a form  
letter on voluntarism, and a  
recipe for crabmeat casserole.

‘Henpecked Husbands It's The Only Number  
We Have Get.

WIFE BEATER’S LICENSE

NAME  
ADDRESS -  

CITY STATE

WHEREAS, the Royal Order of Henpecked Husbands has thor-  
oughly investigated the case of the above-named individual, and  
WHEREAS, we have found the case to be in need of action,

The above-named is hereby authorized to beat, chastise,  
whip, or otherwise manhandle his wife in any way he feels  
necessary—and capable. Spanking is recommended for minor offenses.  
Recommended method is to bend her over your lap, lift skirts, pull  
down panties, and (if still mad) proceed. This method can be  
distracting. Use of brass knuckles or rubber hose is prohibited  
except in extreme cases.

If wife questions your authority, show her this permit. Then you are on your  
own, brother.

The New York State Coalition  
Against Domestic Violence was  
outraged when they discovered  
that "Wife-Beater's Licenses"  
were being sold in vending  
machines at restaurants on  
the New York State Thruway  
last August. In response, the  
Coalition sent alerts to their  
members urging them to send  
protest letters. Members of  
the Coalition were successful  
in having the item removed  
and its sale discontinued.

Anarchists Doomed

On March 2, 1981, the Roman  
Catholic Church's "congrega-  
tion for the doctrine of  
faith" confirmed in an offi-  
cial declaration that Free-  
masons, Nihilists, Charcoal-  
burners (an underground rad-  
ical sect of the last cen-  
tury) and Anarchists are to  
be considered as automatically  
excommunicated from the  
church. Such evil-doers are  
thus deprived of burial ac-  
cording to the Catholic  
rites and will, of course,  
be consigned to the inner-  
most circles of hell.

Refugees Jailed

Women refugees from El Sal-  
vador are receiving unequal  
treatment from U.S. immigra-  
tion authorities.

In the Los Angeles area,  
men are housed at INS camps,  
but refugee women in the U.S.  
illegally are sent to county  
and state jails. As a result,  
in at least one LA area facil-  
ity, the women refugees must  
submit to strip searches and  
body cavity searches twice  
daily. The men do not have  
to undergo such examinations.

Sexist Laws Abolished

According to a report in  
the New York Times, the last  
two and a half years have  
seen the end of all laws con-  
sidered by Nicaraguans to  
discriminate against women.

A law giving fathers abso-  
lute right over their child-  
ren has been abolished, for  
example, while a new measure  
banning the "commercializa-  
tion" of women has been  
passed.

More Boycotts

The United Farm Workers  
has called a boycott against  
Dole products, which is owned  
by Castle and Cooke, Inc.

C&C also owns West Foods  
which is being struck by the  
farmworkers union.

The United Food and Commer-  
cial Workers Union is calling  
on consumers to boycott Chef  
Boyardee products. The union  
has been on strike in Nia-  
gara Falls, Canada, since  
Aug. 31, but the U.S. side of  
the company has been ship-  
ping its products across the  
border in efforts to help  
break the strike. Along with  
the 21 Chef Boyardee products  
is Jiffy Pop popcorn.

Safeguarding Nukes

"Mission Impossible Capers"  
best describe the teachings  
from the 4-week course for  
drivers of nuclear materials  
shipments. Tactics for safe-  
guarding cargo resemble James  
Bond stunts. In only one  
month, these men are trained  
to spot “terrorists,” learn  
how to recognize a "police  
ruse" and finally, how to  
shoot an AR-15 rifle, a 12-  
gauge pump shotgun and a .38  
pistol. The estimated cost  
for one class of 15 in 1978  
was $37,921.18.

The Transportation Security  
Personnel Training Manual  
gives:

"Reasons for Being a Terr-  
orist:

1. Political - Some groups  
advocate overthrow of a form  
of government - some just  
have a minor complaint(!) such  
as the civil rights in the  
60's - the students who were  
against the Vietnam War and  
wanted the U.S. to bring all  
its troops home - against  
the conditions they live in -  
such as ghettos."

More Depo-Provera

Depo-Provera, Upjohn Com-  
pany's injectable wonder-drug,  
banned by the Food and Drug  
Administration for use as a  
contraceptive in the U.S.,  
has not only been exported  
to more than 70 countries,  
but is now being injected in  
American Indian women in the  
Minneapolis-St. Paul area.  
And in Ontario, Canada,  
mentally retarded women were  
injected with Depo in some  
institutions.

Zimbabwe, though, last year  
announced they were banning  
the use of Depo completely.

The FDA scheduled hearings  
this February to recommend  
whether or not Depo should be  
used as a contraceptive in  
America despite cancers found  
in dogs, monkeys and now  
humans.

In South Africa, Depo Pro-  
vera is being widely used on  
Black women.

The Director-General of the  
racist South African Depart-  
ment of Health and Welfare,  
Dr. J de Beer has confessed  
concern with the continuing  
increase in the Black popula-  
tion. He said, "It is not  
easy to get the birth rate  
down other than by penalizing  
people and having steriliza-  
tion and abortion both on de-  
mand and by command." (our  
emphasis).

Rape in Marriage

Senator Jeremiah Denton, Al-  
abama Republican, opposing  
legislation that would permit  
prosecution of a husband for  
raping his wife, said, "When you  
get married you might expect  
you're going to get a little  
sex."

Poles to S. Africa

According to the South Afri-  
can Digest, an organ of the  
South African government,  
“Thousands of Poles - includ-  
ing doctors, nurses and other  
specialists - are seeking a  
new life in South Africa to  
escape Soviet oppression,  
diplomatic sources said last  
week." Recruitment of Poles  
by South African corporations  
in Vienna, Austria has been  
particularly successful, as  
the South African government  
desperately seeks skilled  
white labor.
