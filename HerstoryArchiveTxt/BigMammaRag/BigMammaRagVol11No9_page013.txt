Rita Silk Nauni

Support/Defense Network

Thank you for your letters
to prison officials. Some of
the mistreatment of Rita
(Silk Nauni) has been halted.

women in cages

Your letters of support have
helped give Rita strength.
She has been able to see her
son for the first time in 3
years. As long as letters
keep coming in, prison guards
will think twice about repeat-
ing their past brutalities.
Rita's lawyer went to Oral
Arguments to find out if she
can try to appeal. It will
probably take a year to get
this decision. It can take
years to go through the ap-
peals process. Every day she
is away from her son she is
missing his development. She
must be freed from her 150
year imprisonment term she is
charged with for protecting
her son and self against ra-
cial prejudiced police bru-
tality. Do not forget our
sister Rita, she still needs
our help.

The Oppression Of One Womyn By Another

This was edited from The So-
ciety of the Raging Bull, an
organization whose main goal
is to help oppressed women,
mostly martial artists. The
organization is in its early
stages of development. If you

Donna Dimaulo is a womyn,
26 years old, a martial art-
ist of 7 years, and a type-
setter who lives in Oakland,

struggle

California. She is presently
being oppressed and denied her
rights by the Women Martial
Artists organization.

Below is a copy of the let-
ter, word for word, that was
mailed to Donna after she re-
gistered for the 6th Annual
West Coast Women Martial Arti-
sts Training Weekend. The Tra-
ining Weekend is sponsored an-
nually by Women Martial Artis-
ts.

Dear Donna:
We cannot accept your appl

1) Rita more support in
Oklahoma.

2) A supportive home in Ok-
lahoma awaiting Rita's re-
lease.

3) Letters need to be writ-
ten to the National Council
of Churches requesting the
reinstatement of her bail. N.
C.C. has been under fire by
news media and rightists for
their support of prisoners
and could use supportive
words to counteract the back-
lash they have been receiving.
Please write: National Coun-
cil of Churches, 475 River-
side Dr., New York, NY 10115,
or call (212) 870-2200.

4) Rita is also asking that
letters are written to: State
Appellate Court, State Cap-
ital Building, Oklahoma City,
OK 73111.

5) If National Council of
Churches does not reinstate
bail, money will need to be
raised. For contact list and
other information, send dona-
tion: ($1 more if you can,
less if you can't) to the
Survival Network, or: Rita
Silk Nauni Support Defense
Network, P.O. Box 712,
Wabash, IN 46992.

regarding the 6th annual W-
est Coast Women Martial Arti-
sts Training Weekend due to
your history of violent beha-
vior toward others at past wo-
rkouts, trainings and within
the martial arts community of
the Bay area.

We regret having to make
this decision, yet we cannot
endanger other participants
on the weekend by accepting
your application. Please find
your payment of $25.00 enclos-
ed herein.

Sincerely,

Nina Jo Smith

This letter is outrageous be-
cause:

1) Everything in it is false.
Donna never acted violently
toward anyone in or out of the
martial arts community and the
various workouts. She attend-
ed 2 past training weekends
put on by WMA, the 4th and 5th,
at which there were no proble-
ms. She enjoyed herself at bo-
th of these. This year she at-
tended Special Training '83
(June 9th) in New Jersey, where
a crisis did arise. However

this was a crying episode, not

one of violence. Donna was de-
pressed because she couldn't

Marina Jurez

Support/Defense Network

Marina Jurez Rangel has
been transferred from the
Perryville Prison in Arizona
to Missouri! When Marina was

prison atrocities

17, her co-defendant testi-
fied and turned state's evi-
dence witness against her.
Her co-defendant committed the
rape Marina was charged for
even though her only partici-
pation was being there.

Because of the nature of
this case, Marina has been
beaten by guards, mostly male.
She has been mistreated in
ways that not only shock the
conscience of people who have
witnessed the brutality, dep-
rivation, and humiliation at
prisons, but also those that
know the difference between
the regular occurrences and
the special ones. Marina was
handcuffed, belly chained,
and had not eaten because of
a fast lasting 7 weeks. She
was disciplined while her
co-defendant's disciplinaries
were dismissed.

Prior to her transfer pa-

find a new school of her sty-
le to train in. (more on this
later). She was on the lawn

in front of one of the build-
ings when suddenly she found
herself surrounded by a group
of women from the Special Tr-
aining organizing committee.
One of them said, "We're your
friends. We want to help you."
Then they proceeded to yank

her up off the grass despite
her objections. 2 of the wom-
en then talked and walked with
Donna on a track court that
went in a circle as did their
conversation. Later in her do-
rm where the women were housed
the same Committee Members sh-
owed up again, this time with
a psychiatric worker. Upon the
worker's insistence that she
speak to Donna alone in her
room, Donna agreed-only because
she felt the women she was dea-
ling with had very conservative
attitudes and should she refuse
it would create an atmosphere
of panic. Once inside her room
the worker asked Donna questio-
ns and apparently didn't get
acceptable enough answers as
she then threatened her with
possible confinement inside a
psychiatric facility. Finally

Marina was given an
alternative by Russ Savage, a
correctional program super-
visor (wrote) "If you sign
the transfer papers you go
west if you don't sign the
papers you go east. I suggest
you sign them." He attempted
to coerce her into signing
which she did not.

Marina was taken to a tran-
sfer hearing but was told it
wasn't an actual hearing,
that she was told would hap-
pen later. They told her she
did not need a lawyer, nor
present witnesses, nor evi-
dence in her behalf nor could
she question the evidence
against her.

The information obtained on
Marina was by one of the in-
side six of her inside sup-
port group. An outside group
is now being organized by
S/D Network:

Like all prisoners Marina
needs legal counsel and
people to check up on her
and administration. Friends
and family fear for her life!

Donna convinced her she was
okay and promised to see a
therapist as soon as she got
home, though inwardly she had
no intentions to as she didn't
and doesn't feel the need to
see a therapist. Following
Special Training '83 Donna
sent a letter to the Committee
