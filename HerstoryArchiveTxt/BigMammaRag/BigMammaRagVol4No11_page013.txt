This is your basic Bringing the  
Sweetheart Home to Meet the Folks  
book. It suffers from poor charac-  
terization, stilted dialogue, and  
stereotypic situations. Politics,  
or lack thereof, will not even be  
discussed in this review.  

The plot consists of Robin, be-  
loved daughter of a minister's wife  
and her minister, visiting the folks.  
Having decided to let the gang in on  
the secret about her roommate, she  
brings said roommate along in the  
hopes that the family will be as  
captivated as she.  

The roommate, obviously adored by  
"Robbie," has problems with visibil-  
ity (Ah yes, lesbian visibility a-  
gain) in the book. For a character  
so central, she never says much  
other than "I love you." The reader  
does learn how Tracy, the roommate/  
lover, makes love with young Robin.  
There is a rather mechanical de-  
scription of the process near the  
beginning of the book.  

During the week that she and Tracy  
are visiting, they manage to meet  
every living relative she has.  
There's the wise older brother--some  
of his best friends are homosexual--  
who thinks his little sister can be  
just as queer as she wants to be.  

He and his wife are secure. There  
is the orthodox, religious older  
sister who doesn't want her strictly  
ordered life to have any mars, in-  
cluding the divorce she is conten-  
plating and her flawed sister.  

Robin's other endearing relatives  
are Gram and Gramps. Gram is a  
stereotypic sharp-tongued nag, who  
raised a milksop son, Robin's father.  
Gramps, who had nothing to do with  
raising his son, is a keen-eyed  
kindly old soul, the sort who feeds  
ducks in the park.  

The female characters are all neg-  
atively portrayed in the book.  

Robin and Tracy are hardly real  
characters. Mom is the basic middle  
class mother figure, although she  
acquires some depth about three  
fourths of the way through the story.  
Sister is a madonna, or trying to be  
one, and Grams is a nag, a bitch, a  
hen-pecker.  

The major conflict in the book is  
between Robin and Dad. Dad, the  
milksop, is also a tyrant with his  
wife and children. At one point, he  
threatens to excommunicate Robin, or  
whatever it is ministers do--exor-  
cize? Well, Dad never quite accepts  
his daughter living in sin, but he  
doesn't boot her from the familial  
bosom, either.  

Mom, of course, accepts Robin be-  
cause a mother always loves her  
children. After some fast-talking  
by Gramps (Old Keen Eyes), Gram  
accepts Robin's lifestyle. Everyone  
lives happily ever after, with the  
possible exception of Gram, who has  
terminal cancer.  

The story ends with a “to thine  
own self be true" moral. Was this  
a true story... Rumor has it that the  
book is based upon the experience of  
the author. Stranger than truth, as  
the saying goes. No doubt this ex-  
plains much of the awkwardness of  
the portrayal. Often, writing about  
an experience too close to home  
lends a confusion to the writing.  
Perhaps Robin Jordan should have  
waited a few years before trying to  
write about an experience that was  
so obviously trying and important to  
her.  

Focus on Imogen Cunningham  

ity of the real. At the same time,  
a renaissance of sorts was taking  
place in the field of photography.  
Photographers, independently of each  
other, sought to explore the forms  
of objects as ends in themselves.  

Imogen Cunningham's portraits of  
this period were sharply focused,  
more precise and unembellished. She  
seldom photographed larger scenes;  
she focused on people. Her nudes  
were highly abstract, and her series  
on plants, made during the twenties,  
were original and beautiful in their  
design. Today, they remain fresh  
and enchanting.  

The "f/64" group was formed in San  
Francisco in the early 1930's. Ms.  
Cunningham was a member, along with  
Willard Van Dyke, Ansel Adams, John  
Paul Edward, and others. It derived  
its name from the lens opening that  
provides the ultimate in the sharply  
defined image: In essence, this  
loose group of artists adhered to  
a growing trend in photography on  
the West Coast and believed that the  
camera gave ultimate access to the  
real world.  

During the 1930's, her portraits  
appeared in Vanity Fair. Among her  
subjects were Wallace Beery, Spencer  
Tracy, Upton Sinclair, and dancer,  
Martha Graham. She expressed a pre-  
ference for photographing homely men  
because they had no illusion about  
themselves. She later admitted that  
the least gratifying aspect of por-  

trait photography was when she had  
not been able to please the person  
with his or her own likeness.  

As a purist, Ms. Cunningham pre-  
sented a happy contradiction. When  
she attended an exhibit of surreal-  
ist photographers in the 1970's, she  
was offended. "If I thought that  
was the way photography was going,"  
she said, "I'd go home and bury my  
camera." Yet without a twinge of  
guilt, she cropped her prints and  
used only a part of the negative  
she wanted.  

THE OPOPONAX

Any woman who has been subjected  
to a Catholic education will find  
much to relate to in Monique Wittig's  
The Opoponax. For myself, I smugly  
believed I had filed those experi-  
ences and memories away along with  
other useless items like training  
bras and pamphlets explaining men-  
struation. But 50 pages into Opopo-  
nax and visions of sugar plums were  
replaced with holy water, rosary  
beads and rituals to the snappy tune  
of saecula saeculorum.  

There is no greater single female  
influence in a Catholic girl's life  
than THE NUN. She does not float,  
hover, or flit--she LOOMS. There  
are painful remembrances of SISTER  
standing tight-lipped and toe tapping  
while you painstakingly tried to man-  
ipulate your alphabet through tears  
mingled with washable blue/black ink.  
And what joy surpassed those cunning  
escapades wherein you got away with  
plucking one another's beanies while  
Sister was dutifully beating her  
breast at the Holy Sacrifice?  

Two things Wittig does most effec-  
tively are smashing myths and solid-  
ifying suspicions. The most far-  

reaching myth to be shattered is the  

In 1970 she received a Guggenheim  
Fellowship. When a collection of  
her works dating from 1901-1973 was  
exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum  
of Art in 1973, Hilton Kramer of the  
New York Times said: "Miss Cunning-  
ham is remarkably generous and sear-  
ching. She really gives herself to  
the subject--there is no question of  
turning the subject into 'a cunning-  
ham.'"  

Always very much in demand, she  
photographed dolls for Life, and her  
work has appeared widely in photo-  
graphy magazines. She was a Life  
Member of the American Society of  
Magazine Photographers, and a Fellow  
of the National Academy of Arts and  
Sciences, a distinction she shared  
with Martha Graham. Two years be-  
fore she died, she was named the re-  
cipient of the University of Wash-  
ington's Alumnus Summa Laude Digna-  
tus award.  

When asked if she preferred the  
company of men or women, she replied  
that it depended on what she or he  
was like. Her fellow male photo-  
graphers liked her and she liked  
them. It never occurred to her to  
play the game of pretending to be  
dumb in order to make a man like her.  
"I'm dumb enough to begin with," she  
told Barbaralee Diamondstein. "Why  
try to pretend that I'm dumber?"  

She outlived many of her juniors  
such as Dorothy Lange and Margaret  
Bourke-White (the latter, she ad-  
mired for her courage). Up until a  
short time before her death, she  
remained active, teaching occasionally  
at the College of Arts & Crafts  
in Oakland and the Ansel Adams Work-  
shop in Yosemite Park. When asked  
to comment on her photographs, she  
said, “There's far too much philos-  
ophizing about photography these  
days. People will just have to look  
at my stuff and make up their own  
minds."  

Big Mama Rag Vol. 4 No. 12  

innocence and inborn, spontaneous  
goodness of children. Her children  
are violent, brutal, often cruel and  
insensitive. They are also cunning,  
having learned early on how to mani-  
pulate adults and tell them exactly  
what they want to hear.  

And if you had a sneaking suspicion  
(after the fact of course) that the  
Catholic religion helped form your  
second-class citizen mentality, right  
again. The children are given exten-  
sive history lessons, all male of  
course. They are told that ghosts  
live in the forest but only men and  
boys are smart enough and possess the  
emotional cool to escape. Little  
girls are harassed and rendered impo-  
tent to physical attack by the short  
skirts which are part of their uni-  
form.  

Marguerite Duras has called it a  
masterpiece because Wittig uses  
"nothing but pure description convey-  
ed by purely objective language."  
That is exactly the book's downfall.  
A series of vignettes with thematic  
unity is still only a series of vig-  
nettes no matter how fine the writing.  
After the first 75 pages there is  
nothing new and reading it becomes a  
labor of love with diminishing re-  
turns.  

For women who have not had the  
questionable benefits of a Catholic  
upbringing, do not despair. The book  
has political implications for anyone  
who has suffered female childhood in  
any form.  

The book jacket states that Opopo-  
nax has no definition in the material  
world. Untrue. The opoponax is a  
flowering herb with an odorous gummy  
resin used for medicinal purposes.  
Revolution, aggressiveness and vio-  
lence are the balm applied to the  
wounds of a Catholic girlhood. Amen.
