L.A. Museum: Knee Deep Racism/Sexism

Artists Coalition
for Equality

July 15, opening night at
the impressive Los Angeles
Museum of Art. Well dressed
patrons were arriving to see
the two Bicentennial exhibi-
tions: "Seventeen Artists of
the Sixties," and "The Museum
as Site - Fifteen Projects,"
both originally planned as

zap action

major representation of Cali-
fornia art from the past two
decades. Around the corner
marched 150 women and minority
artists dressed in white
shirts, black jackets, and
western style string ties,
ready to protest, and ready
to perform! Los Angeles femi-
nist artists have, over the
past several years, developed
a unique merger between poli-
tical action and performance
art, using creative props,
guerilla actions, and media
coverage. Tonight was their
contribution to art of the
seventies.

Two abreast they converged
on the gate and were halted
abruptly by seven armed guards.
"We have invitations," some
of them stated, but they were
still refused entry. "We have
a performance for your court-
yard!" the leaders shouted.
Instead of picket signs, pink
and black balloons bobbed
above the protestors, asking
the question "Where are the
women and minorities?" Out of
32 artists in the two current
exhibitions, only two were
women, and despite the fact
that Los Angeles has a high
percentage of Latino, Black

and Asian people, no minority
artists were included. Los
Angeles County Museum of Art
has a long time record of
discrimination. In 1971, the
curator of one of the current
shows, Maurice Tuchman, was
responsible for the "Art and
Technology Show," an exhibi-
tion of 64 artists, 63 of whom
were white men! This touched
off a strong protest movement
by women artists in Los Ange-
les, eventually ending in the
Museum's commitment to spon-
sor the 1976 exhibition,
"Women Artists: 1550-1950,"
curated by Ann Sutherland
Harris and Linda Nochlin. A
similar gesture was made du-
ring the intervening years
with "Two Centuries of Black
American Art," curated in
1976 by David C. Driskell and
Leonard Simon, but by and
large the same discriminatory
practices remained in effect.
Now, in two of its major con-
temporary exhibitions, the
museum appeared to be retur-
ning to the narrow mentality
of the sixties, blatantly ig-
noring their own gains and
the changes in social con-
sciousness of the past decade.
By 9:00 pm opening night
over 200 protestors had gath-
ered outside the gates. Sud-
denly out of a nearby Cadillac
jumped six women clad in masks
and hot pink cowgirl outfits.
Identifying themselves as the
Cowgirl Commandos they announ-
ced "We're looking for curator
Maurice Tuchman, wanted on
three counts: rustlin' tax
dollars from poor folks, falsi-
fying history, and having the
gall to invite you all here
to watch him do it!" Under a
banner someone had tied to the

VISIONA NARROWSA - Deadly Curatorial DISEASE
A Case Study: 10 years observation of Maurice Tuchman, curator of the Los Angeles County

Museum of Art.

VISIONA NARROWSA, Deadly Curatorial Disease, is common in museum curators with the highest incidence
found in white males living in North America. SYMPTOMS: 1) inability to see Black, Asian, Latino/a or American
Indian artists and the art they make, 2) inability to see female artists, especially women of color and lesbians.
CAUSES: racism, sexism, classism, capitalism. CURE: extended bed rest and reeducation can alleviate symp-
toms temporarily but for a complete systemic cure the causes must be eliminated. PROGNOSIS: Maurice is
regressing and requires immediate action. Send letters recommending retirement.

seven foot gate - Los Angeles
County Museum of White Male
Art - the cowgirls exclaimed,
"We've come here to tell you
you're standing knee-deep in
institutionalized racism and
sexism, podner, and we think
it's about time you scraped
off those boot-heels of
yours!"

As the performers continued
listing the "crimes" of the
institution, a police helicop-
ter circled overhead, illumi-
nating the crowd with its
searchlight. The museum staff
worked frantically to keep the
"disturbance" from affecting
the tranquility of the opening
and the "upper category" pat-
rons inside. They called out
the police, told television
stations they could not come
inside to film, and escorted
guests out the back gate. In-
side, many of the guests, (a-
largely white crowd) ate tacos
served by Mexican-American
workers, strolled past Black
guards, and remained oblivious
to the commotion.

want the showdown!" the cow-
girls demanded. "Where is Mau-
rice?" They whirled around to
face 100 masks of Maurice
Tuchman, donned by the protes-
tors. Yelping and hooting, the
cowgirls rounded up the masked
curators, oinking and mooing,
and drove them up to the gates,
discouraging guests from ent-
ering for two hours, as press
photographers and one tele-
vision camera recorded the
event. When finally the pro-
test performance was over, the
crowds left, feeling elated,
and humming the cowgirls re-
frain "Cai-ai-yippee, ai-ay,
ai-ay, White boys ain't the
only ones making art in LA!"
(to the tune of Get Along
Little Doggie)

Press coverage, continued
pressure on the Museum's
Board of Trustees, and the
Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors, is expected from
the Artists Coalition for
Equality (ACE), as the grass-
roots coalition gains momen-
tum through the success of
this event.
