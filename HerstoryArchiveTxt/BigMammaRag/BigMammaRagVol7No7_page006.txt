Birth Control Blues

According to a Stockholm, Sweden
eye expert, birth control pills may
be causing women to be color blind.
Olof Lagerlof is reporting that re-
cent studies show that as many as
40% of women on the pill develop pro-
blems with seeing in color, and that
some have trouble telling blue from
yellow. There is belief that the
pill may cause poor circulation of
blood in the eyes and this reduction
of circulation results in a loss of
color vision.

A Woman’s Worth

Women and girls don't get a very
big share of community foundation
grants according to a study by a
group called "Women and Foundations,
Corporate Philanthropy" (WAF/CP).

Of the community foundations studied,
the most generous handed out only
11.9% to programs aiding women or
girls. Barely more than half a per-
cent of private foundation funding
goes to women's projects specifically
designed to help eliminate sex dis-
crimination or to further opportuni-
ties for women. The reason? In the
words of Esther Schacter, who super-
vised the study, “...women's pro-
grams touch economic, political and
social issues that challenge many
accepted public policies and tradi-
tional lifestyles."

Erotica Versus Porn

Women Against Violence in Porno-
graphy and Media recently held a
series of workshops dealing with
issues involving pornography. One
workshop dealt with the differenc-
es between erotica and pornography.
According to the women in that
workshop, "Although the question
of the differences between erotica
and pornography cannot be totally
resolved, and though there is room
for differences of opinion, our
group was able to formulate a list
of observations about the differ-
ences. They are as follows:

EROTICA
1. personal
2. emotional
3. Motivation:
   sensual
   sexual
4. has “lightness”
5. refreshing, rejuvenating
6. tactile, textural
7. element of trust, caring,
   concern, love
8. taps into emotional, creative
   part of self
9. Natural
10. fulfilling
11. circular
12. it’s just there

PORNOGRAPHY

1. Sexuality is defined by penis, men
2. for titillation of men - not with women’s
   interests in mind
3. power imbalance
4. Produces violence
5. Suggests violence
6. unreal image of “appearing sexy”
7. element of fear, mindlessness
8. heavy
9. bodies are contorted
10. No reciprocity between people
11. gratification at someone else’s expense
12. voyeuristic
13. linear
14. something you buy and sell

Racist Kidnapping

The US Supreme Court has agreed
with a Texas appeals court that the
raising of a girl with her Indian
mother on a reservation is “unnat-
ural" and awarded the child to her
white paternal grandparents.

The racist high court ruling in
June upheld a Texas Court of Civic
Appeals decision last fall which
held that allowing 9 year old Tif-
fany Butts, the daughter of a
Sioux woman and a white man, to
live with her mother on the Rose-
bud Indian Reservation in South
Dakota would subject her to “un-
natural conditions."

The 8,000 member Rosebud Sioux
Nation said that “the findings
are based on racial considerations
totally irrelevant to any legiti-
mate purpose of the state to pro-
tect children from parental abuse
or neglect."

Commuters in Jeopardy

Commuters in Jeopardy, an alliance
of women's groups concerned with pub-
lic safety, is taking on Philadelphia's
public transportation system over the
issue of security on commuter trains
and at train stations.

The commuters charge that the rail-
roads have been unresponsive to the
need for more security at city and
suburban stations despite numerous
beatings and sexual assaults.

Commuters in Jeopardy formed as a
result of a suit against CONRAIL by
Chris Bateson, a 17 year old woman
who remains physically handicapped
as a result of a beating three years
ago at one of the CONRAIL stations.

SEXCE Petition

Students for the Examination of
Contraceptive Effectiveness (SEXCE)
from George Washington University,
petitioned the Federal Trade Commis-
sion to impose regulations against
deceptive advertising by the manu-
facturers of over-the-counter vagin-
al contraceptives. The group says
that misleading advertising is result-
ing in pregnancy for one out of four
women who use these non-prescription
methods. SEXCE says government in-
difference to the problem is result-
ing in thousands of unwanted preg-
nancies.

Big Media and Little Girls

The following comments were deliver-
ed in a speech, “Child Pornography,"
by Florence Rush at the WAVPM Con-
ference on Pornography held in San
Francisco:

"There is little doubt that men
are sexually attracted to children
and entrepreneurs and advertisers
attempt to capture this market. Our
media transforms the most nonsexual
items into an erotic garden of child-
ish delights. Bell telephone at one
time circulated a picture of a 12
year old girl standing on a phone
book reaching for something unseen.
The caption read, ‘are you using your
phone book properly?' The message os-
tensibly instructed that the phone
book is for finding numbers rather
than adding height, but by posing the
girl with provocatively exposed but-
tocks, the picture made a direct
appeal to male sexual interest in
little girls.”

Five Feet Will Do

Janice Lynn Foster is only 5' tall.
She was top-rated when she applied
for a job on the greenchain in a
forest corporation's mill at Youbou
on Vancouver Island, Canada. The
company, however, refused to hire
her. “Unfair” said the Human Rights
Commission in a ruling released last
month. The inquiry board found that
the standards of B.C. Forest Products
Ltd. for height and weight for jobs
on the greenchain discriminates
against a class of people which it
prefers not to employ- women. They
found the job requires technique and
stamina, not strength.

The Real “Woman” Wins

A New York District Court Judge
ruled in favor of the New Women's
Times in the trademark infringement
case of Allied Publications and
New Woman, Inc., versus New Women's
Times, Inc.

The New Women's Times was incorpo-
rated in New York in 1975 and New
Woman was federally trademarked in
1969. New Woman is a slick, glossy
magazine published every two months
with articles on beauty, fashions,
horoscopes, and health. The New
Women's Times is a tabloid newspaper
published every other week with
articles on politics, feminist ac-
tion, and news from around the world,
sold on newsstands for 50c. New Woman
is sold for $1.25.

The judge found no evidence that
the New Women's Times intended to
infringe on New Woman's trademark or
to confuse the public, or to rely on
the goodwill of New Woman in order to
sell New Women's Times.

Messing With MS.

A federal judge has ruled that a
New Hampshire school board violated
the First Amendment when it banned
Ms. Magazine from the Nashua High
School Library. Judge Shane Devine
ordered the school board to replace
back issues and to resubscribe to the
magazine.

The school board had contended that
Ms. was "obscene" because it contain-
ed information on birth control, sex
and lesbian relationships. The judge,
however, ruled that the magazine was
"not obscene within any recognized
definitions."

“Bodies” Banned

The self-help manual, Our Bodies,
Ourselves, one of the most popular
books on women's health to come out
of the women's movement, was recent-
ly banned by the Renton School Dis-
trict, just south of Seattle, Wash.
The District's General Instruction
Committee voted to remove copies of
the book from Renton's three high
school libraries because the book
"was too mature and explicit for all
students grades 9 - 12 and that the
book's language was biased in that
it condones homosexuality."

Lesbians Bad Business?

Lesbian Information Line (LIL) has
been denied advertising space in the
Vancouver Free Press, because "it's
bad for business." This follows fast
on the heels of a recent Canadian
Supreme Court decision that it was
okay for the Vancouver Sun to refuse
a Gay Tide subscription ad on the
grounds that an advertisement for a
gay liberation newspaper might, in
the Sun's opinion, result in loss
of business. LIL is a counselling
and referral service for lesbians.

Briggs in D.C.

The Briggs Initiative is dead in
California, but its legacy lives on.
A piece of legislation is quietly be-
ing drafted in the District of Colum-
bia that would prevent federal fund-
ing of any school teaching that homo-
sexuality is an “alternative life-
style." Working behind the scenes is
right wing fundamentalist group
Christian Voice, which boasts a $1
million budget, a DC lobbyist and
a membership of 100,000.

Getting High With Anita

Anita Bryant, in her just published
book, "At Any Cost", is simply a whole
some Christian ahead of her time in
recognizing the moral landslide in
America. Moral landslide does not re-
fer to nuclear catastrophes, widening
gaps between women's and men's wages,
Right-to-Life blackmail schemes or the
fact that 50% of the US prison popula-
tion is drawn from the 10% of the gen-
eral population which is black. Moral
landslide is us-- lesbians, feminists,
homosexuals, ERA advocates, abortion
advocates, etc., etc. In the book,
Protect America's Children and the
Anita Bryant Ministries, Inc., have
a solution-- all we have to do is
relax and give ourselves into the warm
soothing caress of a higher "author-
ity." They will help us with counsel-
ling centers (some already in opera-
tion) and toll-free hotlines for
referral and counselling. From the
book: “Whatever we do, it is certainly
not for our own profit, but because
Christ's love controls us."

Michael Riordon, in a review which
appeared in the Body Politic, states,
"They (Bryant and husband Bob Green)
know what's at stake. So do we. At
stake for them is power. At stake for
us is us."
