Compartmentalization

The separation of sex from the everyday flow of our lives, done
through its over-glorification, is part of the general compart-
mentalization of our lives, which makes it easier for Business
to take us over, part by part, exploit us as much as we allow,
and rule us. By separating politics from our jobs, from our
sexual relations, from consuming, from the economic
structure, the total rip-off can be more easily hidden from
view, and solutions sold to us for the parts of our dissatisfac-
tion without disturbing the superstructure that steals from us
in so many ways.

By dividing our physical bodies into sexual/non-sexual parts,

we lose the potential of our full sensuality. This numbing is so

that we will put up with necessary hours of grueling &/or
boring toil and living our lives in concrete, polluted cities.
Over-glorification of sex
Glorification of sex can be to the detriment of affection and
emotional involvement with sexual partners, as well as with
other people. Other forms of sharing and sensuality are dis-
counted, thus concentrating all our love, sensuality, and
needs for touching into sexual contacts (and our genitals).

When sex is considered the ultimate in sharing, loyalty to
sexual partners comes before other commitments and
relationships, blocking collective struggles. A danger of
heterosexual relations is that with this kind of attitude our
final loyalty would still be for a man, and so more easily with
the patriarchy.

Emphasizing sex helps to divert a whole lot of energy into an

approved form of release rather than using it for creative

social change. It’s used as cheap thrills to help people forget a

tight and exploitive economy, to replace the fulfillment of

other needs, and is thus a block to radicalization. By giving us
an illusion of sexual freedom, other oppressions may more
easily go unnoticed.

These general oppressive attitudes about sex may be carried
over into any sexual/emotional relationship, between women as
well as with men. A radical feminist’s sexual choices are therefore
not as much between lesbianism, bisexuality, heterosexuality, or
celibacy, as in deciding whether the relationship she chooses to
be in reinforces in herself and others the oppressive Amerikan
program for sex, or whether her relationships, with men &/or
women, add to her effectiveness in the radical feminist struggle.

LNS: Were you surprised at
people’s interest in your case?

I was in the sense that I didn’t
know there were so many
women down there fighting
rape. It felt good to see so
many women struggling for
the same thing I was strug-
gling for and that they could
identify with what I was doing.
We may not benefit by it right
now, but we will in the long
run, maybe our daughters or
our nieces.

LNS: Some women on your
defense committee say that
rape is like part of a war
against women. How do you
see that?

I believe that. Anywhere you
go, when you say you’re raped
they don’t want to accept that.
You’re the victim when it first
starts, and you become the
guilty party. The person that
attacked you becomes the
victim, and you become the
guilty party because you fight
back.

LNS: Was that the same kind
of attitude you found in court?

That’s the way they teach you
from your childhood. The man
is supposed to be the master
of the house — it’s the
machismo way, let me put it
that way. I believe that in
Monterey where the trial was
that’s what it is too — it’s a
town that's run by men and a
woman don’t have any say.
LNS: And so when you went
against that—

They couldn’t even under-
stand it or they couldn’t relate

to it.

S.R.: I thought the courtroom
was like a fraternity house.
During the trial the lawyers
are all very friendly to each
other. Even though they're on
different sides of the case
they’re in the same club. I was
standing around when the jury
was out, and Charles Garry
and Arthur Broderick, the pro-
secutor, were just talking very
friendly.

They were laughing and kid-
ding along with each other.

S.R.: Saying ‘you did a good
job.’ ‘Yeah, well I thought

you did a good job.’ Broderick
had been asking Inez really
lousy questions about the rape
— ‘what did you take off first,
did you fold it? What did you
do next, what article of
clothing did you take off next.’
It was hard to sit there, and
Inez was under a lot of
tension. Garry never objected
once. Afterwards Garry said
‘he could have been a lot
harder.’

LNS: In what ways did the
prosecution try to distort the
situation?

S.R.: The prosecution tried to
make it seem that Inez was
involved in a drug scene and
that she was Freddie’s lover.

The whole thing the

prosecution was trying to do

was ignore the fact that these

men were killed because Inez
was raped. They were trying
to pin a drug rap on Freddie.
They were concentrating a lot
on Freddie, trying to prove
that these men had been killed
because Freddie was beaten
up, and Fred went out to shoot
them. The prosecution said
that Inez had said, ‘well, my
family will get us off, so let me
shoot them.’ That was the
prosecution's story, and they
didn't prove that, they
couldn't.

I.G.: They tried to bring up a
lot of little things to make me
look bad, but they couldn’t.
First of all, in Soledad I could
have gone out with any man,
but I didn’t do it. Everybody
knew that. So a lot of the men
thought that I was too good for
the men in Soledad. Men had
come to my door to bug me.
Plenty of times, they tried to
break down my doors and I
had to call the police. There’s
testimony in the trial about

this. A man who worked as a
guard at Soledad prison lived
across the street, and he used
to watch my door for me, be-
cause mostly I was there by
myself with my son and my
nephew. I had that testimony
at the trial but there was other
testimony the judge wouldn't

allow.

LNS: “Why do you think you
were convicted?

I believe I was convicted be-
cause the judge was preju-

countability of the board and
credit committee to its mem-
bers. The board of FEN, on
the other hand, is self-select-
ed; FEN members must rely
on the personal integrity of
their representatives and the
decisions they make.
Overlaps Confuse

Concurrent with the FEN/
DFFCLU struggle is a conflict
within the feminist health
movement. Until the FEN
conference in November,
1975, the Oakland Women
Feminist Health Center (OW-
FHC) and the Detroit
Women’s Feminist Health
Center (DWFHC) enjoyed a
friendly and cooperating re-

lationship. At the conference,

however, political differences
surfaced (see Big Mama for
January 1976 for a complete
analysis of the issues); OW
FHC, aligning itself with FEN,
withdrew its support of the
Detroit clinic.

Subsequently, another wo-
men’s health center was or-
ganized under the name of the
Downtown Detroit Women’s
Feminist Health Center and
maintains an unspecified but
partial relationship with FEN.
The original Detroit clinic is
suing the Downtown clinic for
adopting ‘a similar...confus-
ing name that sounds like a

branch of the Feminist Wo-
men’s Health Center, Inc.’
A priority of the directors of
the Downtown clinic, who are
black, is to make their services
accessible to inner city wo-
men. The original clinic is
located in the suburbs. Both
staffs were trained by the
OWFHC.

Meanwhile, personal and
political conflicts escalate
daily as more information
comes to light. The overall
situation is further compli-
cated by the overlapping of
several personalities involved
in more than one of the
projects concerned.

architects and educators is
necessary. Financial backing
is imperative in order to use
fluctuating welfare funds, and
so most community groups
must turn to a large agency or
wealthy church for financial
support.

Unlicensed day care is easier
to organize because there are
no legal obstacles, but it is
usually transient and unsuit-
able for most women. Organ-
ized by mothers themselves on
a volunteer basis with one or
two paid staff, they don’t last
very long without a stable
financial or administrative
arrangement. Mothers
change jobs, move and have
other children, and it is hard
to run a home, work and
manage a center at the same
time.

Day care is a microcosm of
our capitalist system where
people’s needs are sacrificed
for profit.

of service will again be avail-
able in some form, to the
women of the Denver Metro
area.”

Realizing the limited poten-
tial of this statement, Re-
source Center volunteers are
organizing a public rally to be
held on May 16th at the City
and County Building, 14th and
Bannock, starting at 2:00 pm.
Representatives from the Vol-
unteer Committee told BMR
that their intentions for this
rally are to ‘embarrass poli-
ticians who say they support

the women and don’t’ and to
‘raise women’s conscious-
ness’ around the issue of
women being such a low
priority for City and County
funds. Petitions will be cir-
culated at the rally asking that
local politicians make women
a priority. Another petition
may be circulated urging
Metropolitan State College to
take over the Resource Center
(this has not as yet become a
final decision). Women musi-
cians and speakers will be
present at the rally.

The Volunteer Committee is
presently considering a num-

ber of possible alternatives for
the center. They definitely do
not wish to close it down, but
rather, are actively looking for
possible location(s) for office
space. They are also talking
about possibly broadening the
scope of the center to deal
with more kinds of primary
needs that women have. Any
suggestions regarding these
two areas would be welcome.
Open community meetings to
discuss these and other issues
are held every Wednesday
night at 6:00 pm at 625 S. Elm

diced, he was a male chau-
vinist: It’s a men’s town. They
run it. They don’t agree that a
rape happened, they don’t
want to see it. The judge had
made up his mind, he already
knew I was guilty one way or
another. There was a lot of
testimony the judge wouldn’t
allow. They just wanted to
make me look bad. They
succeeded in doing so and
making it the way they wanted
it to be.

It’s supposed to be justice,
it’s supposed to find out the
truth, not go about the way
they want to see it. Broderick
made it sound like he was
there and knew what happen-
ed. It wasn’t the way it
happened, but that’s the way
they convicted me.

LNS: What was the question-
ing like?

It was nasty, it felt terrible. He
had a big smile on his face and
he was getting a kick out of it.
I asked him ‘Do you get a kick
out of asking me all these
questions...’

LNS: When you were on the
stand?

Yes, and then I answered his
questions very badly, I said....
S.R.: You said something like
‘Sure I enjoyed it,’ being sar-
castic. And when Judge Law-
son wrote that he didn’t want
Inez to have probation, they
took it out of context.
I.G.: He wrote up that I said,
‘Oh, sure he was being nice
when he fucked me.’ Instead
of saying he raped me, I used
those words, because of the
way he was asking me and he
had a big grin on his face.
LNS: How do you think this
second trial will be different?
I feel I’m going to have a much
better understanding with
Susan Jordan, my new lawyer,
than I did with Charles Garry.
Garry didn’t represent me
right. He wanted to claim that
I was insane or mentally
incapacitated, as though you'd
have to be out of your mind to
go out and do what I did, to
defend yourself when someone
attacks you.

In this trial, we're going to
try to bring up all the things
that didn’t come up in the
other trial. The fact that one of

the men threw a knife at me
besides raping me hardly
came up in the first trial. I’m
going to be sitting down with
Susan to discuss how every-
thing is going to be presented.
LNS: Have your experiences
with the trial, the defense
committee and being in prison
changed you?

I see things differently than I
did before in a lot of ways.
There’s a lot that I used to go
through that I don’t have to go
through anymore because I
know that I don’t have to put
up with it anymore.

The way I was brought up, I
was taught that the man would
work and the woman was for
the house, to keep the house
clean, get the food ready and
have everything ready for him
when he got in. Then he would
get dressed, go out and you
would stay home. And he
would come home and sleep
with you or whatever, and in
the morning do the same
thing. Over and over.

The way I have changed is
that I have become a woman in
the sense that I don’t have to
put up with what my mother
and grandmother put up with.
I guess every woman who has
been a housewife knows what
I am speaking about. Now I’ve
realized a woman can make it
in this world without a man. I
believe that very strongly. It’s
hard anyway. It’s a decision
you have to make and you
have to stick to it. I believe
that a woman shouldn’t be a
slave of a man now. I didn’t
before.

Also I have changed in that I
want to get involved in helping
other women like me —
getting involved in the peo-
ple’s movement and trying to
help other people. There are a
lot of changes that need to be
done in the system — not only
about rape — we have all
types of different oppression,
different rapes.

I was studying in prison
about the people’s movement,
and I have learned that there’s
a lot of different oppression in
the world. I know what
oppression is. You learn from
what you experience through
life. Some people sit down and
read a book. I can't read or

write. When I speak I try to
speak from what I know or
what I have been through.
LNS: You talked about the
people’s movement. Were you
aware that people were active
in things like that before?

No, I wasn’t aware until I met
people and found out that
there were people fighting for
their rights. Before I didn’t
know about it or didn’t under-
stand it. And there’s a lot of
people like me that don’t
know. They just live from day
to day the way they were
brought up. They believe that
they are all by themselves and
that there’s nothing they can
do about it. This is true of
women that I know of.

LNS: Do you think you event-
ually would have found out
about the movement?

Maybe eventually, little by
little. Maybe I would have
gotten involved, maybe I
wouldn’t have. I found it out
late — I'm going on 32 — but
I found it out.

LNS: How will you pay for the
second trial?

In this country you have to buy
justice. If you don’t have the
money you have to go to jail —
that’s the way I see it, that’s
the way they work it. It’s a
shame you have to go through
that. I have people who are
trying to help me or else I
wouldn’t have been able to
even fight it. We need near
$75,000.

We've tried to get a lot of
groups involved to try to help
us raise money. The defense
committee helped from the
very beginning. In this trial it
will be even better because we
have more support than be-
fore. Now we are getting a lot
of Latina women involved. If
you don’t have enough people
to back you up to fight it, you
ain't going to get nowhere.
When you’re fighting by your-
self it’s just another case and
it goes the way they want it to.
I have a strong feeling that we
are going to win it.
