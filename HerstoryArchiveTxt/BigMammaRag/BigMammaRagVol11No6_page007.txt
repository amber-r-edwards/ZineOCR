We Won't Go Away

The government of Mozambique  
has established relocation  
camps for lesbians, citing  
lesbianism as a product of the  
country's period of coloniza-  
tion by European powers and  
decadent western civilization.

Solidarity, USA

Solidarity, a gay San Fran-  
cisco organization and the  
AFL-CIO Coors Boycott Commit-  
tee are being sued in an anti-  
trust suit for $145,000 by  
Adolph Coors Co. for organiz-  
ing boycotts against the com-  
pany's products. The suit  
demands the names of members,  
minutes of meetings and other  
info about its activities.

The district court ruled in  
December that Solidarity must  
turn over all requested mat-  
erial to Coors. If Coors wins  
the use of boycott as a pol-  
itical tool will be severely  
weakened but other such cases  
have been thrown out of court.

Coors is using the anti-  
trust laws to silence a com-  
munity group which is prot-  
esting what it sees as un-  
fair labor practices and use  
of profits for right-wing  
causes, says ACLU who is  
defending Solidarity.

Hate Station

The Black Media Coalition  
has petitioned the FCC to re-  
voke KTTL-FM, Dodge City, KS  
radio license. The station  
has repeatedly broadcast  
coarse and hostile programs  
attacking Blacks, Hispanics,  
Native Americans and partic-  
ularly Jews. At one point the  
station urged listeners to  
take the names of local Jews  
and go kill them...if the  
Jews even fool around with us  
or try to harm us in any way,  
every rabbi in LA will die  
within 24 hours. Another time  
the station urged listeners  
to be God's battle ax...they  
are going to cleanse this  
land...with blood..And isn't  
that going to be fun? What  
is this nonsense trying to  
fool people that the Blacks  
are being deprived?...They  
haven't the capacity to rule  
and administer in your govern-  
ment.

The owner of the station,  
Nellie Babbs, maintains she  
has the right to broadcast  
the trash under the First Am-  
endment and has offered air  
time for those with differing  
views.

Miners

Five Black miners were arr-  
ested in Johannesburg, South  
Africa in April while others  
were dismissed for refusing  
to go underground and for de-  
stroying property at a uranium  
mine where 16 people died in  
an explosion that month. Be-  
sides killing the 16 people,  
50 more were injured in the  
methane gas explosion.

Discrimination

Lillian Bishop, 75, Denver  
bookkeeper was hired and then  
fired by Denver-Metro chapter  
of the March of Dimes. The  

reason—her age. She is suing  
for breach of contract citing  
the age policy. Her comment—  
"I'd always heard the March of  
Dimes doesn't discriminate in  
any way, who would think I'd  
be the exception!"

Go Get Him

Six women who have been  
sexually abused by a male  
Toronto psychiatrist for over  
20 years have banded together  
to demand his license be rev-  
oked from the College of  
Physicians and Surgeons.

On advice of counsel they  
are told they have a good  
chance of winning. They need  
$1,000 to cover legal fees,  
if there is money left over  
the women hope to set up a  
fund for other similarly ab-  
used women.

It is hoped that if they  
win it would set an example  
so that other women patients  
will not tolerate such treat-  
ment. Send donations to:  
Sexually Abused Patient's  
Defense Fund, % Toronto Rape

Sounds Familiar

A 700 pound pregnant cow  
recently traveled 35 miles  
in 20 hours to find her way  
back to her original owner,  
after being sold to a cattle  
rancher.

Julieann, the cow, was des-  
cribed by her original owner  
as a free spirit with a pen-  
chant for wandering. The new  
owner, who plans to reclaim  
the errant heifer, is convin-  
ced that Julieann's wandering  
days will soon be over. He  
says, "She needs to have a  
calf, and then she'll settle  
down."

Turn Around

drug and he had cancer.

Protest Nazis

More than 1,500 demonstrated  
in Karlsruhe, West Germany  
to protest plans by neo-Nazis  
to hold a rally in the area.

About 20 anti-fascist groups  
took part in the protesting of  
neo-Nazi Michael Kuehnen de-  
claration that he would launch  
a steering group to unite all  
the neo-Nazi groups in West  
Germany around his party,  
Action Front of National-Soc-  
ialist-National Activists or  
ANS.

Artfully Truthful

Artist Barbara Carrasco  
was paid $6,000 by the LA  
Community Redevelopment Agen-  
cy to paint a 16x80 mural.  
Carrasco painted LA History—  
a Mexican Perspective and the  
Agency has tried to pressure  
her into erasing some scenes,  
including ones showing the  
relocation of Japanese-Ameri-  
cans and the lynching of 21  
Chinese workers. The Agency  
denies it but would not put  
the mural up. It is hanging  
in downtown LA on Broadway  
where it is thought to have  
the heaviest minority foot  
traffic in the city.

Bang Bang

Marianne Bachmaier of Lübeck,  
West Germany was sentenced to  
six years for killing the man  
who raped and murdered her 7  
year old daughter Anna. Two  
years ago Bachmaier pulled out  
a gun in the courtroom where  
Klau Grabowski was on trial  
for the rape/murder. She pum-  
ped all seven bullets into  
his back. Grabowski had a long  
record including sex offenses  
against young girls.

Her Fault?

Rene Shin-Yi Chen, 6 years  
old, who was killed when a  
helicopter crashed on her,  
had knowingly assumed the  
risk when she took part in  
the movie that also killed  
another child and actor Vic  
Morrow.  
The above defense was incl-  

uded in a response to a $200  
million wrongful death suit  
filed by Renee's parents.

Attorney Wm. Vaugh said in  
the court document that if  
the plaintiffs suffered or  
sustained any loss, damage or  
injury...the risk, if any  
risk there was, was knowingly  
assumed by the decedent,  
Renee Shin-Yi Chen.

Boom Boom
