Olivia Records on “moving money”

Vicki Piotter

Olivia Records, the national women's
recording company which has produced
eight albums of lesbian music and
poetry since 1974, was in Denver the
first week of May to give a concert
with two of their recording artists,
Teresa Trull and Meg Christian. May 4,
the night before the sell-out concert,
30 women attended a workshop at Woman
to Woman Feminist Bookcenter where
Jennifer Woodul and Teresa Trull, act-
ing on Olivia's policy of being acces-
sible to the community, talked about
the Olivia business/collective in re-
lation to their records and concerts,
the process of generating money, and
their collective/consensus structure.

Jennifer started the workshop with
a detailed account of one aspect of
Olivia's financial operation -- where
Olivia spends the revenues from the
average price of $3.57 they receive
for each album sold. In addition to
where the money goes from record sales,
Jennifer emphasized the importance of
when the money goes into women's
pockets, with the comment that Olivia
tries, as much as possible, to deal
with women when paying bills. For
example, (see the chart following),
all of the outlay for salaries goes to
women, and likewise the rent money;
most of the money for royalties on
songs goes to women; some of the money
paid out for travel, printing and in-
surance expenses end up with women,
etc.

Jennifer said that Olivia is exper-

iencing one problem in that they have

a very large accounts receivable;

the women who distribute Olivia re-
cords, who buy the majority of Oli-
via's inventory at $3.30 an album,
are taking up to 90 days (and some-
times longer) to make payment on the
albums. Olivia does not have the same
flexibility in paying their bills,
most of which are due within 30 days:

Community meeting
Diana’s Grove

Constance Perenyi

The last community meeting in May
was presented by Diana's Grove, a
collective consisting of seven women.
Begun in 1977, the group perceived a
need for a large space for women to
meet and be together. During their
first meeting they discussed estab-
lishing a coffee house; shortly
after, they expanded their vision
and proposed a comprehensive women's
center.

Since 1977, the collective has of-
fered activities ranging from dances
to the concession sale at the Rita
Mae Brown lecture. Now they are
working to organize a panel for
Lesbian-Gay Freedom Week, and are
considering a film festival. Furth-
ermore, they have returned to their
original idea of a coffee house and
have proclaimed January, 1979 as
an opening date. To that goal, all
of their events are offered by don-
ation. The collective is now seeking
a grant, preferably from a private
foundation, to be used to offset
basic operating costs; the money is
not intended to pay salaries as
presently there are no paid positions
within the group.

Obviously the most important point
of unity for the women of Diana's
Grove is the collective process it-
self. Operating on the belief that
oppression must be ended, and that
the condition of women will be ele-
vated only through unity, they have
struggled with each other to survive
as a collective. They see their pro-
cess as providing an atmosphere that
encourages both political and per-
sonal growth. Each member is requir-
ed to be at the process meetings
which are opened with some kind of

Teresa said Olivia understands that
few distributors are able to front the
money for the albums and are forced to
make payment as they sell them, but
that together they are trying to work
on ways to eliminate this cash flow
problem. She also said that while the
outstanding inventory is not good for
Olivia, it is good that lots of
women are able to supplement their income
or get all of their income from sell-
ing Olivia records.

Jennifer and Teresa then turned to
one of Olivia's major political con-
cerns -- money, how to keep it moving
for the benefit of individual women,
women's projects, women's businesses,
and how Olivia and “moving money”
work together.

Generating Money

Teresa and Jennifer said that Olivia
Records, by self-definition, is a
political group as well as a business.
While many women's groups are still
struggling with the question as to
whether "business" and "feminist" are
contradictions in terms, Olivia has
resolved the issue for themselves by
maintaining that the feminist
values with which they approach the
business of selling lesbian music
makes them different than regular bus-
inesses. Jennifer said that the women
of Olivia are not interested in the
accumulation of profit for a small

group of people. Rather, they defy cus-

tomary business objectives and prac-
tices, working in ways so that the use
of money not only benefits Olivia, but
benefits women dealing with Olivia as
well.

Although not an actual example of
how Olivia has practiced feminist
values and "moving money", Jennifer
and Teresa offered the following
example for the purpose of making the
idea more clear. Olivia discovers that
record sales in the Southeast United

expression of female spirituality,
followed by a time for each woman to
state how she is feeling; and ultim-
ately these meetings evolve into
constructive skill sharing. At
present, Diana's Grove is closed as
a collective, but open to community
response.

Throughout the meeting, women in-
volved in other collectives responded
positively to Diana's Grove's
unique commitment to process. Most
of the questions asked after the
initial presentation concerned
problems with which all collectives
deal, such as communication, account-
ability and trust. Diana's Grove
answered with personal examples
from their time together. Apparently
they have reached a stage in their
development in which they feel se-
cure as a collective; and as they
expressed it, are now ready to move
into the community. Their dreams are
far-reaching - they see a women's
building to rival the center in Los
Angeles, and a community in which
we as women can support each other
financially. In many ways, theirs
is an example of a collective in
which those dreams and that support
come from within. They have built a
strong foundation for themselves.

States are slow when compared to the
rest of the country. In order to reach
more southern women with lesbian music,
they borrow $5000 from a friendly fem-
inist at 8% interest; they pay a south-
ern women's newspaper $1000 for the
use of their mailing list; they pay a
woman $2000 to design an advertising
package and then pay a women's press
$2000 to print the package. After the
ad campaign has reached its destina-
tion, Olivia can expect to receive
$5400 in orders for albums, which Oli-
via then uses to pay back the loan.
Although Olivia has not made a mone-
tary profit on the venture, they feel
that it has served a good political
purpose by providing (much needed)
money for a women's project, a women's

Lilith closes

Lilith, the feminist bookstore in
Boulder, closed May 25th. Lilith not
only sold a wide variety of feminist
products, it also provided a space
where women and women's groups could
meet. Women Against Psychiatric
Abuse, potluck dinners, solstice and
equinox celebrations, and classes on
everything from women's health to
workshops featuring writers and poets
were held there.

The women of Lilith have struggled
for a year and a half to make Lilith
solvent enough to pay the rent and
keep the store stocked. Unfortunately
the store did not receive the finan-
cial support it needed and was forced
to close.

It is hoped that another group will
buy Lilith and reopen. In any case
the store will be closed for at least
a month while inventory is taken and
then may reopen in another location.

Lilith and the women of Lilith
brought much new and vital energy to
the Boulder/Denver area. That energy
and the services and creativity they
generated will be greatly missed.

business, and individual women and
that the act of reaching new women
with their music is political in
itself.

The example did point out the prac-
tical effects money can have -- aiding
in a group's survival and possible
growth, supplementing the income of a
working woman, to free her to work in
other areas, but ideas on how this
fits into the work of eliminating sex-
ism, racism, etc., how moving money
affects the direction of growth,
and how it translates into making ul-
timate change were not addressed. Jen-
nifer and Teresa made it clear that
"moving money" is a commitment to
growth and self-support, but did not
make clear whether Olivia sees "growth
and self-support" as a goal, in and of
itself, or as a strategy towards a
different goal. Jennifer did comment,
in reference to the example, "What we
have learned that this means politi-
cally is that to reach a woman with the
kind of feminist women's lesbian cul-
ture that we put out is to frequently
really spark change, individual change
that can be translated into group
change."

Music and Concerts

Women who do not, or are unable to

attend Olivia workshops, most visibly

see the politics of Olivia in the
records they produce and the concerts
they give. For many women, Olivia's
albums have served to legitimize their
lesbianism by the strong and proud
woman-loving lyrics that can be found
not only in women's bookstores, but
"straight" record outlets as well.
Olivia has the respect of many women,
and rightfully so, for helping les-
