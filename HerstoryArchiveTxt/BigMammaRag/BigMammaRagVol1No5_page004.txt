KNOW YOURSELF - BE WELL

by Vicki Ziegler and Li
Campbell for Colorado Springs
Women's Health

Colorado Springs Women's
Health has been active for
almost a year now in an ever-
changing, loosely woven organ-
ization of women dedicated to
teaching other women about
their bodies and their health.
We started our work in the
context of a women's
liberation consciousness-raising
group, but have been a sep-
arate operation for several
months. New participants
moved into a passive acce-
ptance of our normality such
as childbirth and pregnancy.
We see a doctor.

We have received and we bet, nobody even
knew it was coming. We have
worked in Circle-One art-
on the history of the
Ah movement, patient
advocacy, and menses extract-
ion. In the purely clinical
area, there are step-by-step
instructions for doing bi-
annual pelvic exams, for using
the speculum, and for learn-
ing breast examination. There
is a comprehensive article on
the various vaginal infections
and their treatments which
should be of interest to every
woman who has ever had an itching,
burning crotch. There is

also a discussion of child-
birth from a feminist per-
spective.

We found ourselves branch-
ing out quite naturally into
the area of women's sexuality,
and consequently, we included
a large enthusiastic section
of several articles on mastur-
bation—a subject not dealt
with extensively from a femin-
ist viewpoint in any other
publication we know of.

Several of the women working
in our women's health group are also part of a teach-
ing collective established by
one of the few women profess-
ors at Colorado College. With this feminist
anthropology professor, we are

developing a women's studies
course for the Fall of '73. We
have decided to vary the cour-
ses from the usual reading,
study, discussion seminars, and
create a workshop course dealing
with women's issues and prob-
lems.

The teaching collective has
the primary authority for mak-
ing decisions about required
reading and general course reo-
quirements. The main thrust
seems to come under the gen-
eral heading of women's health
and the health movement.

The course will deal largely
with mental health, but the
students will be reading our
Circle One as well as
other materials and will be encouraged to participate in the
self-help part of their
work. We taught the
women's health course last Jan-
uary, and every woman in the class
responded enthusiastically to
the information on self
health. We ended up with three
or four swimming classes,
some of which continued as on-
going consciousness-raising
groups.

We are especially involved in
subsequent health work. Our
hope is to turn more women on
to meaningful work involved and encourage them to
go in whatever direction
they find especially interesting. The health movement has
so many facets, there is a
place for every young woman.
Currently, we are starting
two new classes in beginning
self-health. One of them came
from response to our notice in
the free university summer
session catalog. We worked
through the free university in
the Spring teaching two
classes. If there is anything
like that in your area, it is a
good way to reach women other
than those attending local
colleges. We charge no fees
but receive contributions for
our packets which include all
the necessary equipment plus
Circle and the Birth-
Control Handbook. (Contri-
butions are usually about $3
from women who are able to pay.) 
Another project for the
Summer is to compile a re-
ferral list of gynecologists
and obstetricians. We want to
ferret out those physicians
who are willing to cooperate
with us—those who will pro-
vide good gynecological care
free of condescension, and
with a lot of useful inform-
ation about our bodies and the
problems we may be having with
our bodies. We plan to have a
questionnaire that should re-
veal their attitudes about
women coming to appointments
in pairs, how they feel about
answering questions fully,
what their political views are
concerning informed consent
during an exam, their fees, and
various other topics. Our goal
is to be able to recommend
doctors who we know will give
good and responsible care to
any woman who chooses to pa-
tronize them.

We've also been traveling
around the state helping new
groups get started. (We will
go wherever we are asked to
for 13¢ a mile.) We are always
available to help new groups
get started. If you are inter-
ested in any aspect of the
women's health movement, and
we can be of assistance to you,
please contact us by mail at

I had reasoned this out in my mind; there was one of two things I
had a right to, liberty or death. If I could not have one, I would have
the other, for no man should take me alive. I would fight for my liberty
as long as my strength lasted, and when the time came for me to go,
the Lord would let them take me. Harriet Tubman

printing notes:

Much as we appreciate
quality and breadth, our space
limitations demand that articles
be SHORT-SHORT- SHORT. Strive
for a maximum of two double-
spaced typewritten pages. We
reserve the right to edit any
articles which we would like
to publish but are too lengthy
to be included in full. Also,
if any of our readers would like
to mail us articles,
photos, and/or graphics, we
would appreciate it if you
would write a few words
about who you are so you can
be credited. Be kind to
yourself. All material can be
mailed to: The Big Mama Rag,

or call Donna at 399-2149.
