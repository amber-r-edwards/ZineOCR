Renewing A Commitment To Feminism

BMR Collective

In putting together this  
issue on the state of the  
movement we were a little  
disconcerted by the articles  
we received, for although  
the articles addressing our  
theme represent a great deal  
of important feminist theory  
we felt like the following  

of knowing I am an adult,  
thinking woman, because there  
were times I had to think up  
a rationale of why I had the  
right to say or do as I wanted. I grew up in an era where  
I was told that I had to beg  
for the thing or "work  
around" someone for things,  
play the game.  

* The issues of feminism are  

sexual politic as well as giving  
an analysis of sexual  
practices in a political con-  
text, such as sexual harass-  
ment in the workforce, bat-  
tering, the analysis of porn-  
ography and rape as an issue  
of exploitation and power not  
of sex, the role of women as  
doormats for men in the home,  
the sexual division of labor.  

independent feminist movement  

questions, among many others,  
remained unanswered or at  
best, confusing.  

1) Why is there a need for  
an Independent Feminist Move-  
ment?  

2) Why is there a need to  
work with other movements?  

3) How do we work with  
other movements/engage in  
class struggle with our own  
Movement?  

4) How do we put our pol-  
itics into action?  

5) How does our work in  
Big Mama Rag function to  
strengthen the Independent  
Feminist Movement?  

Contributions to this issue  
were not solicited from any  
other feminist group, except  
for asking in "where we're  
at", nor did we receive any.  
We did solicit the articles  
from the New Movement in Sol-  
idarity for Puerto Rican  
Independence and Socialism  
and Cate Gilles.  

Right now the BMR collect-  
ive is four white women, two  
of us are raising kids. We  
all work for a living full  
time and work on BMR without  
pay--in our own self-interest.  

We taped a discussion among  
the collective in an attempt  
to begin to address the above  
questions and initiate dia-  
logue in the Feminist Move-  
ment and the feminist press.  
(* Each * indicates a new spe-  
aker since through all the  
editing we lost track of who  
said what.)  

Why is there a need for an  
Independent Feminist Movement?  
* The emotional part of fem-  
inism is one of the things  
that holds me together, that  
I have rights, whatever my  
needs are. The right to have  
an abortion, to demand free  
medical care, that who I live  
with will share equally ac-  
cording to our capabilities.  
I am equal because I say I  
am, I know it. The strength  

in every day life, every day  
in every way women deal in  
feminist issues.  

* In looking at all aspects  
of our lives the Independent  
Feminist Movement demands the  
destruction of the nuclear  
family, not defining people  
in terms of their relation-  
ships to others, or to repro-  
duction...as well as demand-  
ing an end to racism, anti-  
Semitism, class structures  
and imperialism.  

* We have to be saying--We  
believe in our Independent  
Feminist Movement--but we  
must be aware that the assa-  
ult on sexism will be only  
as strong as the assault on  
racism and anti-Semitism.  

The freedom we want must be  
for all, not just some. At  
the same time we must organ-  
ize as feminists and confront  
issues and behavior that  
aren't being confronted by  
other movements.  

* We are unique in our con-  
frontation of the nuclear  
family. I don't see many nat-  
ionalist struggles, for inst-  
ance, threatening the nuclear  
family. Some communist part-  
ies are encouraging nuclear  
family structures now. These  
groups are saying capitalism  
and imperialism are the enemy  
and are leaving out the whole  
analysis of patriarchy.  

* The nuclear family isn’t  
just a consumer unit. It's  
also an emotional unit,  

with the responsibility and  
blame put on the woman. It's  
a feminist responsibility to  
bring all of these issues  
together.  

* Sexual liberation (i.e.  
more freedom in sexual pract-  
ice) was in fact no libera-  
tion at all, for all libera-  
tion must be connected to a  
politic. Talking about sex  
like it wasn't affected by  
capitalism or patriarchy is  
not real. The Independent  
Feminist Movement defines a  

/Page 10 - Big Mama Rag, August, 1981  

* The Independent Feminist  
Movement says that feminism  
is necessary for revolution.  
It sees the end of the nuc-  
lear family and how we are  
defined in relation to others  
as integral issues for rev-  
olution. This goes beyond the  
economic relationship of the  
family under capitalism and  
the role of women in this  
relationship. It goes beyond  
the relationship of individ-  
uals producing things and the  
cluster of individuals (fam-  
ilies) that eat them up.  

How and why is there a need  
to work with other libera-  
tion struggles?  

* We made a mistake when we  
decided to fight for reforms,  
such as for abortion. Now the  
right to get an abortion has  
been given and taken away. We  
have spent all time convincing  
legislators instead of  
convincing women that the  
liberation of women cannot  
happen under capitalism. Cap-  
italism requires the exploit-  
ation of women. This aware-  
ness is the beginning of the  
answer to why feminism  
needs to struggle towards an  
alliance with other move-  
ments. We haven't learned to  
say fuck all reforms. We con-  
tinue to divert all this en-  
ergy to reforms instead of  
making coalitions with the  
Black Nationalist Movement  
and El Comité-The Committee  
Against Police Repression-  
and people who want revolut-  
ion. The demand of women to  
control their own bodies is  
both the demand for the right  
to abortion and the demand  
to end the use of forced st-  
erilization as genocide. When  
feminism weakened and worked  
for abortion reforms we fucked  
off everybody else and  
watered down the demand of  
controlling our bodies into  
the single issue of a woman's  
“right to choose”.  

* When we ignored the issue  
of sterilization, we aband-  
oned any pretense of strugg-  
le against racism, anti-Sem-  
itism and class structure. It  
didn't matter a goddamn what  
the law said, it was women  
with race and class privil-  
ege that got access to abort-  
ion, and no one else. Poor  
women and women of color were  
forced into sterilization.  
The demand to control our own  
bodies does make connections  
with national liberation st-  
ruggles and the Black Liber-  
ation movement; does say  
something about racism and  
genocide. Anti-abortionists  
and supporters of forced  
sterilization must be confr-  
onted at the same time. The  
Independent Feminist Move-  
ment must push the demand  

for control of our bodies  
based in a politic that sup-  
ports and unites us with  
other struggles. It doesn't  
just say, let's end capital-  
ism and imperialism, but  
patriarchy as well.  

How does Big Mama Rag fit  
into, and function to stren-  
gthen the Independent Femin-  
ist Movement? Putting our  
Politics into action...  

* BMR is a strategy, espec-  
ially for working class wo-  
men. We don't set ourselves  
up as professional writers.  
We don't outlaw somethings  
written by someone like me.  
I think or hope that BMR is  
known as a working class  
publication. It's real im-  
portant that we get out our  
words the way we say them  
about issues we feel are im-  
portant. And it's import-  
ant to let other women know  
that there is information  
here, and they can also give  
us their information, in  
their own words.  

* I feel like I want to est-  
ablish that BMR is coming  
from a considered position;  
of having considered econom-  
ics, the oppression of women,  
and the oppression of women  
in relation to other oppres-  
sed people. And out of that  
analysis to state that we see  
the need for an Independent  
Feminist Movement and BMR as  
a voice for the movement  
That BMR has the responsibi-  
lity to reflect back on its  
own movement and outwards to-  
wards others.  

* We view the nuclear family  

movement  
... Putting Our Politics Into Practice  

as one of the greatest threats  
to women. Right now one of the  
ways to attack family is  
to work collectively whenever  
we can. I don't buy that the  
majority of the members of  

the Feminist Movement are rea-  
dy to go out and live collect-  
ively in our personal lives.  
But I think we should push for  
all feminist projects to be  
run collectively. And that  
feminist collectives practice  
criticism/self-criticism. We  
can attack it in our personal  
lives, in how we work and re-  
late to each other, in getting  
rid of our romanticism in who  
we love and why.  

* And, we have to remember  
that living collectively, or  
having other people involved  
in parenting your children  

are constructive changes, but  
are only reforms, not ends in  
themselves. We are demanding  
complete change in people's  

attitudes. We have to define  
ourselves in a process. We  
could decide that collectivi-  
ty is a goal and yet the struc-  
tural change is not enough.  

Collectives can still be  

aggressive.  
* We attack  

the nuclear family as a  
larger problem by under-  
standing the need for total  
revolution. BMR as a vehicle  
for communication, functions  
towards the goals of feminism  
by first doing basic report-  
ing, informing women on local,  
national, and international news  
--not like the straight press  
does, but from a perspective  
that grows out of women's ex-  
perience. Putting information  
out there so that women have  
what they need to make connect-  
ions. Then, promoting dialogue,  
developing theory, and long-  
term strategies.  

* But, BMR is not only defined  
by our spoken ideology in the  
BMR office. It matters what  

we do when we leave the office  
--our politics are defined by  
our practices and what we put  
in the newsjournal.  

* And, sharing personal ex-  
periences and struggles, and  
pursuing new understanding  

of our culture as women, in  
order to challenge ourselves  
to apply our theory to our  
personal lives.  

* Then, we try to critically  
analyze the various ways  

that we as a movement are us-  
ing energy... Asking ourselves  
“are we being effective?"  

* For instance, I feel that  

if one of us reads something  
in the feminist press that  
we react to we should be  
writing them a letter. Con-  
fronting women who are real-  
ly on our side in defining  
radical feminist politics,  
like Off Our Backs and Ma-  
trix. Other liberation move-  
ments read the feminist press  
and see things go down that  
are racist or classist, and  
go unconfronted. I think  
we're lazy in using the  
press to develop politics.  

* One thing that is frust-  
rating to me is that as well  
as encouraging discussion  

The  
Demands of Women  

within our own movement, the  
feminist media should be  
finding movements that con-  
nect with us, and we're not  
doing it. We have no con-  
nection to, for example, the  
welfare mothers movement,  
and I know there must be  
some grassroots organizing  
going on somewhere if not in  
Denver, and until they burst  
on the scene and we see it  
on CBS we don't know about  
it. I don't know why we don'  
make those connections.  

* We don't get out on the  
streets over issues like  
forced sterilization, abort-  
ion, welfare rights, or hous-

demand the right to use any means necessary  
to eliminate male supremacy  

A Big  

thing often enough. BMR has to  
generate this kind of political action. How  
do we do that?  

* We do that to some degree  
by writing away to  
to find out what they're do-  
ing. Like writing to the  
Puerto Rican Solidarity group,  
like writing to Elizabeth  
Stone House (an ex-inmate  
controlled alternative to  
mental institutions) to get  
an article from them, like  
when we report on a zap act-  
ion brigade. And sometimes  
we're better at it than other  
times but we really have to  
keep in touch and keep put-  
ting out what women are do-  
ing so that we get inspired  
by what other people are do-  
ing and so that we know that  
there is support out there  
for what we are doing.  

This discussion was for  

us, an attempt to pull back  
once again and gain per-  
spective on that huge term  
"The Women's Movement;" try-  

ing to take a look at where  
we are and refocus on our  
long-term goals, re-evalu-  
ate our strategies. It seems  
so easy to get caught up in  
the specifics of the strug-  
gle and pull back only to  
find that we have gone  
slightly (or dramatically)  
askew. And while it  
sometimes seems that we are  
dragging ourselves down with  
more and more words and  
analysis, the distance and  
perspective should ideally  
serve to put us in touch  
with fresh approaches to  
keeping our movement vital  
and effective on many levels.  
Lori once said about us  
working on BMR, "Sometimes  
we feel we're in a paper  
cage lined with words." In  
our talking we may have come  
up with some ways to break  
out and participate more in  
the concrete kinds of strug-  
gles that are real to women.  
Connections between feminism,  
work conditions, issues of  
union organizing, working  
for a feminist movement led  
by working class women in-  
terweave like a spider's  
web and seem to confuse us  
in choosing our direction.  
But these connections are  
important to try to grab  
onto and we must renew our  
commitment to promote  
these struggles.
