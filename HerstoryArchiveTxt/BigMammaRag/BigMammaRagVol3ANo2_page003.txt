Letters Home to Mama

Sisters in Love

Love to you this day and every
day. May your days be blessed
with positive, cosmic, creative
energy doing away with all our
fears and illusions — as each of
us joins together doing Goddess
work.

Big Mama Lives! You better
believe it.

Enjoyed the poetry, calendar
and the articles, very enlighten-
ing, especially the subjects on
rape, religions and rights.

The year is 1975 — the year of
the bunny rabbit who hops
around and does not stand still.
He is quick on his feet, so watch
out sisters. Love is here, but not
to rape the earth for profits. It is
time to “om” “America.”

Love,
Mt. Lemmon, Arizona

Mother-Daughter
Dear Big Mama Rag:

You are wonderful! My mother
sent me a year’s subscription to
BMR for my birthday — she digs
it! She is a beautiful, turned-on
woman who is “trucking” to find
herself in really fine ways. In
coming to learn how many
positives she gave me, I have
come to understand how much
women’s progress depends on
resolving mother-daughter
issues. And with joy I celebrate
her efforts to grow out of the
same hang-ups I’ve been shed-
ding. (Any sisters interested in
touching base with a right-on
woman who still feels new to
Denver, call Lorraine Hedlund.)
Enclosed is a check for five
subscriptions — keep up the
beautiful effort and thanks for
being you!
In love,
Nancy Hedlund

“A Case of Rape”
Dear BMR,

The other evening I watched a
made-for-television movie (a
true story) called, “A Case of
Rape” starring Elizabeth
Montgomery. It must have been
the third time I'd seen it. But un-
til now I couldn't define the
emotions the movie stirred in
me. Now I think I know. I was un-
easy, I was uncomfortable. Why?
Because the woman being raped
(by one man physically, and also
by the police, by the community,
by her husband) was me!

When I saw what was being
done to her, I knew that she
represented every woman. As I
watched, I could feel my face
blush with shame, I felt the guilt
rise within me for having been
raped. Rape is the ultimate put-
down and I feel we, as women,
are being raped a little each day.

I've never been raped in the
traditional sense. Some of my
friends have. But I have ex-
perienced forced sex with men
that I trusted not to use me.

There have been so many little
“put-downs” which I didn’t even
recognize for what they were. I
agree with Ellen's feeling that
towards the end of the ordeal, no
longer to feel guilty for what was
done to me.

One line in the movie was said
to Ellen by a policeman, “even
when you win, you lose.” That was
true, but it doesn’t have to be
anymore. Women will win, but
only by fighting for themselves,
for their own rights and dignities. I'm not what one
would call an activist, but I want
to tell every woman, I care when
I hope my emotional support
will strengthen you, every woman,
just a little more.

Working Class
Dear Chocolate & other staff:

In cleaning up after the fire we
found a postcard from you
behind the filing cabinet. . .

Please keep our exchange sub
coming. Your newspaper is get-
ting better and better. The
anonymous story and analysis
by a working-class woman were
excellent. Would she be in-
terested in reviewing Class and
Feminism? I disagreed with one
point... that all single women or
Lesbians are working class. I
know a lot of single professional
women who are more middle
class and secure than I was
when I was married.

I haven't had time to read the
spirituality yet but I look forward
to it. You all should be con-
gratulated on doing such a fine
job!

Best,
Coletta

Spirituality

Cheers! An issue of your publication
has found its way here. . . love
it!! Just read your special,
Woman and Spirituality. I'm
floating! Is your paper available
by subscription in Michigan? I
saw it in Ann Arbor, where it
rivals any similar local stuff.

Also, is each issue dedicated to a
particular concept? If so, what
are upcoming topics? I have
some journalism background,
and am willing to contribute.

Woman Survival
Dear Glaeshia Lily,

I was very much impressed
with your column on Women
Survival. Especially the six
suggestions of ideas to try. It has
often occurred to me that I am
not using anywhere near my full
brain capacity. The thought
often frightens me as well. My
eager brain welcomes your
writings and is anxious to hear
more from you. Please keep up
the excellent work.

Sincerely,

Seay Sree fe le BIWWIG 5 -
