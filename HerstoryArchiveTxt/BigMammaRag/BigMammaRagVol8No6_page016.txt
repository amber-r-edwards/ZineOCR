The D.C. Area Feminist Alliance  
wants to establish communication  
ties with radical, multi-issue fem-  
inist groups for the political work  
which we all will be doing in the  
coming decade. They want to connect  
with other groups which share their  
political beliefs to discuss future  
strategies for the women's move-  
ment and create at least an inform-  
al national network. From their  
press release: "We have not adopted  
any of the traditional labels for  
feminist organizations. We, as an  
organization, do not characterize  
ourselves as socialist feminist,  
although opposition to capitalism  
is a central part of our politics;  
nor have we self-defined as a les-  
bian feminist organization, although  
a majority of our members are les-  
bian; nor do we call the Alliance  
radical feminist, although most of  
us probably came from that part of  
the movement. We try to let our be-  
liefs and our actions describe our  
politics, in part because all of  
these labels are imprecise and sus-  
ceptible to many meanings, often  
different ones in different cities.  
We are committed, however, to keep-  
ing a multi-issue focus and to pre-  
senting a feminist, left, anti-rac-  
ist and pro-lesbian and gay voice  
in local political work.”

The D.C. Area Feminist Alliance  
is asking women who are a part of  
such organizations to contact  
them at 1225 Newton Street N.E.,  
Washington, DC 20017.

COAT HANGER,  

Call to Women Playwrights! At The  
Foot of the Mountain, a profession-  
al experimental women's theatre, is  
now accepting original scripts for  
two events in its 1980/1981 season.  
The first is a series of monthly  
staged readings of scripts by women  
and the other is a fully-mounted  
production in Feb/Mar, 1981, of a  
new full-length script by a woman  
playwright. The theatre is looking  
for plays which, in content, explore  
women's feelings and women's issues  
with roles that can be performed by  
female actors. They are also eager  
to find plays which, in concept,  
explore new (or ancient) forms of  
dramatic structure and experience.  
The deadline for all scripts is  
September 15, 1980. Mail scripts to  
At the Foot of the Mountain, 3144  
Tenth Ave South, Minneapolis, MN
