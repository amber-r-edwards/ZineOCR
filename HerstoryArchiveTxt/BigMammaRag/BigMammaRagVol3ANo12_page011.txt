Cheryl! Il

I know now that I didn’t kill you but
I love you very much

you were my other self
and my oneness, my single cell-self

still hurts from the loss of you. The Uses of Language

your body with stretch marks on it

To what degree does sunrise
differ from mountains?

If you are speaking to me
you must say things clearly

I stopped reading minds
pain, you understand

alone and lost and dead in the hospital
was dearer to me than sanity

let your madness reach out to me
from the world of flying elephants
(or wherever you are) so
Jean Sirius
claiming me to be yours my soul is

yours already
I think it always was

Mary Ellen Braun

the timid women

whose stockings scratch
against their legs

little mice noises

as they walk

are careful to hold themselves in

as if their bodies are something
obscene and ugly

thinking if they are thin enough
hunched over enough

no one will know

they are diseased

having: breasts
underarms
navels
legs
and hair

in all the wrong places

they walk across fragile land
heels clicking like the Gestapo
issuing commands

their hands keep busy
pushing papers
or counting their fingers
never, oh never
touching their bodies
those: breasts
underarms
navels
legs
and hair
always going hungry

these women

live in someone else's dream
they walk as if they are afraid
to wake the dreamer up

these are the good ladies

in their print dresses and high heels

they are their own Nazis

no one will ever have

to tie them up

or put them in prison

or make them recite lines

of propaganda

over and over

or pour water down their throat

they are already their own fear
walking:

someday, when they wake up
the crumblings under their feet

will be loud.

Martha Courtot

Woman Awry

I'm lopsided under
the shove of demand
and expectation.
Among my cousins,

boulders and

scraggy bristlecones,
I return to my
proper dimensions.

Carol Hille

POET

Dyke Marine

She killed for dinner

fish and rabbits it was easy
a crippled kitten in the litter
that was hard but

she wouldn't pay the vet

to do her dirt

Once she tried to kill a man
but missed

he said all lesbians should die
she threw him downstairs
she fought off a teenage gang
with a motorcycle chain

it was easy

Dyke about town

heavy political line

punch her she won't feel it
Somebody found out

how to open her

how to get her hungry

it was by accident

it would be easier to kill

than feel
what she is feeling now

Martha Shelley

In Memoriam

— Carol Hamilton

a feminist, a sister, a friend

To Carol in the Death House Laughing

From this culture we cannot protect
our children or our dead
Carol in the Death House
cushioned in the casket baby blue and dripping money
the long white communion gown the rosary beads
wrapped around her hands her hair as straight as
straight
Carol with the frizzy hair and overalls
Always smelling like Patchouli
The Patchouli her friend Bonnie had sneaked in
beneath the cushions and
behind the beads a bright smooth stone that Carol loved
Donna with the dulcimer
sang to her the old familiar songs
Chased away Count Dracula lurking from the halls
with phony hands

*The long straight walls all dripping plastic death

How she would have laughed at this
How it makes me cry this final insult.
A sister told me once:
Let no man touch my body when I'm dead
Dress me as I lived and say witch prayers
Feed me wine and burn my bones
Then eat me
Take me to yourselves I give my power to the living.
Tomorrow they will fly her East
A service we will not attend
A vulture saying prayers she will not hear
not now or then
These mourners all dressed right
to the teeth crying through their teeth
The Carol that they never knew.
From this culture we cannot protect
our children or our dead
Burn me eat my bones in celebration
Carol in the Death House
laughing.
