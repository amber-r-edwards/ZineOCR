Dr. Wolf Analyzes Women's Roles

Linda Fowler

Dr. Wolf is a nationally known sociologist, a feminist and founder of
the Denver chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW). She is
a professor at Colorado Women’s College (CWC) where she teaches a
course on women in social situations. With the termination of the
academic year, she will leave CWC to become head of the sociology
department at Ohio Wesleyan University.

I interviewed Dr. Wolf in her office at CWC. We talked about the in-
fluence of various kinds of social structures on the development and
behavior of women in the United States today, about the development
of women within the family, and through groups of other women
within the Women’s Movement.

BMR: Dr. Wolf, could you comment on the influences of the
American family on the development of women?

Dr. Wolf: A while ago I thought
the nuclear family was the worst
thing that could happen to
women. It’s been an absolute
disaster. And I thought perhaps
communal living might be the
answer. But then I did a study of
three mountain communes, and
almost without exception,
women seemed to be carrying
the load—doing all the work.
And men are doing what I call
the new role for men, the male
drone role where they expect all
the traditional privileges but
none of the traditional respon-
sibilities. The best of all possible
worlds. So I don’t think that's the
answer. What we're looking for
is a real sharing of roles; a blurr-
ing of roles. And the term
“unisex” doesn’t frighten me
one bit.

I think we're going to go on
having family units of some kind.
What kind of unit would provide
openness for every individual to
develop? I think maybe in some
ways a small family is better
than a large one; mostly because
of cross-cultural research which
points out that when there are
lots of male and female adults
there is a division of labor, and it
seems to go along sexual lines;
there isn't a cross-over.

Raising Children Collectively

BMR: What do you see as
possibly developing for a family
situation? Obviously the com-
mune isn't the answer. It’s pretty
evident to me that in most com-
munal situations there are cer-
tain surface differences that are
quite different from the society
at large, but when you come
down to the basic inter-
personal relationships they are
exactly the same as they have
been; so that doesn’t answer the
question. What do you think
about the collective as a system
of child-rearing and family in-
tegration where several families
might live together or in the
same area? The raising of
children is done collectively by
the entire group.

Wolf: I think so far it’s one of the
best ways, and certainly for
children. Children cease to be
the responsibility of some poor
woman basically and of the cou-
ple basically, and should and do
sometimes become the respon-
sibility of the whole collective. I
think, probably, the best places
I've seen for women, even
though they haven't lasted very
long, are those that have been in
cities and people all work out-
side the home. They are families
living together in a big house or
on a farm and go into town to
work—like in Boulder on the
Nelson Road place. There you
have a lot of problems, but I think
maybe it’s more conducive to the
development of women.

BMR: Do you think there is a
significant difference between
women who are functioning in
marriage and women who are
functioning more or less alone?
Do you think there are any
differences in the pressures that
are felt in their ability to develop
as individuals?

Wolf: I think it’s probably easier
to develop if you're living alone
and you can choose friends
without pressure. I think we
should have great compassion
for the housewife. Financially
and emotionally there is a great
amount of pressure for her to
stay where she is and not
change; and those who do
manage to isolate themselves
from this situation need support.
The Women's Movement is
providing this support in all kinds
of unlikely places that a few
years ago seemed hard to get to.
We who have some awareness
can't simply step away from all
this — we've got to help one
another — we need each other
— we need the grassroots —
we've got to help other women.

Middle Class—Working Class

BMR: It seems to me that it’s
often very difficult to get this
kind of awareness from the mid-
dle class woman about what her
own personal and social situa-
tion really is, because she has
privilege to make her feel she
has freedom and they are not
the same thing at all. Working
and lower class women, on the
other hand, rarely have the
same kind of privilege. Their op-
pression is much more overt
and they can see it more clearly.

Wolf: They see economic op-
pression more clearly; they do
not see inter-personal oppres-
sion as clearly and this has
always been the case. We have
to face some kinds of real things
that occur in terms of com-
munication. Communication
goes from the top of real things
that occur in terms of com-
munication. Communication
goes from the top down — how
the image of upper and middle
class women is emulated by
working-class women. If you can
get people to realize that, that’s
an important first step.

BMR: Are you talking about tak-
ing steps to reach women in
middle and upper class com-
munities as a means of influen-
cing those women who are in
lower socio-economic groups?

Wolf: I think these steps have
already been taken—in televi-
sion, certainly a lot in
magazines. A few years ago
women who were in the
Women’s Liberation Movement
were funny; humor in a kind of
scaffolding fashion (you laugh
and then you destroy). It’s not
happening too much now. This
has made it acceptable for poor
women who depend on a job and
have been afraid to have
Women’s Liberation attached to
their name. Afraid to be other
than, quote, feminine. You've
got to get support from other
women.

BMR: What things do you think
begin to happen when women
come together in groups within
the Women's Movement? We
talked about women func-
tioning alone and also within
the family. But then you go onto
women functioning in groups of
women. There seem to be
changes that occur when this
happens.

Wolf: I think probably one of the
great things about the Women’s
Movement is that we have come
to desire and like our own com-
pany, and we didn’t used to. To
go out with women was con-
sidered the worst kind of thing to
do. You know, “Can't you do
better than that?” Part of the
whole horrible picture of hating
ourselves, hating one another
and judging everything in terms
of the dominant class
ideology—male. I don't think this
happens so much anymore. I
think women who are involved
in the movement really enjoy the
company of other women and
really like women as individuals.
This great sense of solidarity has
come through the movement.

Radicals in the Movement

BMR: Do you feel that
radicalism within the women’s
movement has a value?

Wolf: It frightens some women;
for some it is absolutely terrify-
ing. If you say anything in terms
of the family structure it scares
them.

BMR: Nothing is going to
change, really, in the society un-
til the family itself changes. This
is the keystone.

Wolf: This is why I felt reluctant
in terms of what the future might
bring even if you have a com-
munal situation or if you have
families living together; the ker-
nel of the family is the same
thing. Nothing changes. It’s like
a raisin pie in which the raisins
are in a certain relationship to
each other: you can transport
the pie all over the place but
nothing changes internally.

BMR: There is a surfacing now
of radical Lesbians in the
Women's Movement. What sort
of effect do you think this is hav-
ing on the movement and on
societal structure generally?

Wolf: I think Lesbian women are
a very valuable part of the
Women’s Liberation Movement.
I think we have to include all
women in the liberation move-
ment. Probably when I came
face to face with it, was when I,
as a member of NOW, was called
a Lesbian. At first I said, “Oh no.
No, no.” And then you think,
“Goddamit, what are you trying
to beat me with?” I don’t think
we should let this be a club.

BMR: This is one of the most po-
tent things to hit women with
because this is something that
definitely steps outside of the
male-oriented culture and
therefore is quite a threat to the
patriarchy. Thereby it is a threat
to women who are still very
much identified with the
patriarchy. The lifestyles that
are developing within the Les-
bian community are certainly
radically different from the
nuclear family unit that holds
the whole society together. And
this may be something of a key
to what is needed to change the
society as a whole. There is an
absence of dominance-
subordinance patterns and
sometimes collective child rear-
ing in collective households. Do
you think this might begin to
really change things?

Wolf: I think that’s fine if it does. 
I don't think it’s happening with
great enough frequency to have
any effect at all. What worries
me is that there will be a kind of
repressiveness. Economic
situations, political situations
have not been very conducive to
an openness. There is a fear, as
with the sexual preference bill in
Boulder, and if there is enough
momentum here I think it will
have an effect of beating people
back into closets, back into
kitchens. And these hard-fought
gains of all of us in terms of mak-
ing life a little more decent for all
kinds of people—I mean how
many gains can we hold on to?

Gays Meet
Vice Chief

At a recent meeting with Cap-
tain Jerry Kennedy, Denver Vice
Bureau chief, Gay Coalition
representatives discussed
harassment of gays by vice
squad officers in gay bars.
Marge Johnson, coalition
member, said that on various oc-
casions vice squad officers had
told women in The Three Sisters
Bar, “We just came to look at all
the pretty little dykes,” and
“Don’t get uptight, girls—we just
came to watch.” She also told
Kennedy that vice officers have
tried to solicit dates from female
customers in the bar. “This is
unprofessional conduct,” she
said, and pointed out that
Lesbians believe vice squad of-
ficers go there to provoke trou-
ble.

Kennedy replied that to his
knowledge no vice squad officer
had recorded in the bureau log
having been at The Three
Sisters. He suggested that the
bar managers keep a log of vice
officer visits to the bar and that
women record the name,
physical description and of-
ficer’s badge number and file a
complaint with Kennedy if they
feel they've been harassed.

Sometimes vice officers work
undercover and, therefore, are
not obligated to provide iden-
tification when requested to,
according to Kennedy. He pointed
out, however, that customers
could get license plate numbers
and turn them in to him.

He said he instructs vice
bureau officers to “enforce the
law and keep your opinions to
yourselves.”

Rape is a Vice

Ms. Johnson also asked
Kennedy whether the vice
bureau is involved in sur-
veillance of gay groups in
Denver and in investigation of
rape cases. He replied “no” to
both questions. Ms. Johnson
said she considers rape to be a
vice.

Coalition members said they
wanted to hold “education
sessions” with vice officers and
to get a liaison officer between
the vice bureau and the gay com-
munity. Kennedy agreed to
these requests. Gerald Gerash
of the Gay Coalition pointed out
to Kennedy that being gay is not
the problem, per se—homophobia (fear of
homosexuality) is the problem
that needs to be dealt with.

Coalition representatives also
recommended to Kennedy that
there be gay representation on
the vice bureau. Kennedy
responded, “Do you have
anyone to suggest?” Coalition
people said not at the moment,
but that they would com-
municate Kennedy's interest to
the gay community. Any gay per-
son who is interested in working
on the vice squad is asked to
contact Cordell Boyce at the
Coalition office, 831-8838.
