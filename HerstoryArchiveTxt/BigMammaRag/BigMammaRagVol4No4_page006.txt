Red-baiting Fails

Teri Bach, a Seattle feminist
and socialist, won a legal battle
for her two children in January
this year. Counsel for her hus-
band, who was attempting to
have the original custody ruling
altered in his favor, cited Bach’s
political activities and personal
affiliations as proof of her unfit-
ness to be a mother. Bach's at-
torneys were mostly inexperi-
enced legal workers handling
the case on a volunteer basis.
Judge Edward E. Henry, in
rendering his decision, defen-
ded Bach's right to pursue her
personal and political philoso-
phies, and ruled that the child-
ren (who had been kidnapped by
their father five years ago)
should be returned to their
mother, who would retain full
custody.

Punishment to Fit?

Carolyn Smithers is an in-
mate of the Bedford Hills Prison
for Women in New York. She is
also an epileptic. She has suf-
fered several violent seizures
while in the prison; prison
authorities have responded by
tear-gassing her, locking her in
punitive isolation, throwing her
naked into a strip cell (a cell with
absolutely nothing in it), and
beating her up. She has, in lieu
of medical treatment, been ad-
ministered drugs which are
known to increase the frequency
and intensity of epileptic
seizures.

Her lawyer is seeking legal re-
course. Meanwhile, sisters can
help by writing the Warden,
Miss Clement, 247 Harris Road,
Bedford Hills, New York, in
protest, and by writing Carolyn
Smithers at the same address
and letting her know of your
support.

Meatwrappers Beware

Workers who wrap meat for
supermarkets (most of whom
are women) are documenting
evidence that shows that the
process with which they work
causes asthma-like respiratory
distress. Polyvinyl chloride
(PVC), which is used to wrap the
meat, is cut with hot wires and
sealed with hot pads, which de-
compose it into vinyl chloride
(which causes cancer), carbon
monoxide, hydrochloric acid and
phosgene (banned as a
poisonous gas in World War I).

Reporter Sues

A TV news reporter in An-
chorage, Alaska, is suing Mid-
night Sun Broadcasters, Inc., for
$1,150,000 after having been
fired for rejecting the sexual ad-
vances of her station manager.
Virginia Morgheim has filed suit
against both the station
manager and the station on
grounds of damage to her
career, intentional infliction, sex
discrimination, abridgement of
her right to privacy, and negli-
gence. She hopes that the case
will set a precedent and will en-
courage women in all areas of
employment to fight sexism on
the job. Moral and financial sup-
port should be sent to her at
3414 E. 18th, Anchorage,
Alaska 99504.

Profitable Cuts

There were 2.4 million un-
necessary surgeries performed
in the U.S. in 1974, taking
11,900 lives and netting almost
$4 billion. Most prevalent un-
necessary surgeries were ton-
silectomies, appendectomies,
and of course, hysterectomies.

Progress?

Barnwell, South Carolina is
the site of a nuclear waste
factory. The U.S. plans to con-
duct nuclear experiments in the
Pacific, bring the waste ma-
terials to San Diego and Seattle
and then ship them cross-coun-
try via railroads to Barnwell. In
the immediate area of Barnwell
the contamination rate will rise
800%. Anything grown in the
area will not be edible and any-
one or anything living in the area
will have an 800% increase in
the chance of getting cancer and
heart disease.

Periodic Disability

The American Civil Liberties
Union is supporting Officer
Penelope Brace in her efforts to
win promotion in the Philadel-

ten years of service. Explaining
his position, Philly Police Com-
missioner Joseph O'Neill made
the following historic observa-
tion: “While I have no desire to
embarrass women, there are, in
fact, certain times of the month
when a woman is emotionally
and physically incapable of
doing her work.”

Bread for Bread

The value of the ingredients in
a one-pound loaf of white bread

Attention Servicewomen

Two little-publicized court
decisions make thousands of
women veterans eligible for
retroactive GI benefits. Service-
women with spouses and child-
ren can now claim them as
dependents (previously they had
to prove that their families were
actually dependent on them,
while men could automatically
claim); and women attending
college with GI Bill assistance
between June 1, 1966 and Octo-
ber 24, 1972 (when the benefits
were equalized) can retroactive
benefits.

The Veterans Administration
says it is ‘trying to locate women
entitled to money and pay them,
but time is running out: eligible
women must claim before July 1
this year to receive the benefits
due to them. Contact your
regional VA office.

Budapest Appeals

Z Budapest, a feminist witch,
was convicted last spring of
fortune-telling, placed on a two-
year probationary period, and
forbidden to read the tarot. In
January this year, the Appellate
Department of the Superior
Court upheld her conviction, and
more recently informed her that
she would not be allowed to take
her case to the Court of Ap-
peals. Her lawyer, Marge
Buckley, is preparing a Writ of
Habeas Corpus, which is a direct
appeal for the case to be heard in
the Court of Appeals. If this is
denied, one will be submitted to
the California Supreme Court
and, if necessary, to the Federal
Supreme Court.

Just In Case

At a Florida cancer and gene-

J. Lynch announced that he had
recently removed both breasts of
a 19-year-old woman as a pre-
ventative measure, because
some close female relatives of
hers had developed breast can-
cer. He and Dr. Joe Fraumeni, of
the National Cancer Institute,
also reported that 14 other
women from ‘high-risk
families’ had had their ovaries
removed even though there was
no sign of cancer in any of them.

a continuing forum:

The Insidious Connection

Janet Sergi

How do the master plans of the corporate-liberal state affect all
women and especially feminist institutions? Here is one connec-
tion. The intense conflict at Sagaris last summer centered around
the question — is Sagaris indebted to the corporations like Ms
and the Carnegie Foundation for the respective $15,000
(for scholarships and general funding) and $3,000 (for an accredita-
tion committee) grants? How can these “strings” co-opt the radical
feminist content and process of the school, witness the $700 tuition?

Likewise the conference by the Women’s Institute of Alternative
Psychotherapy (see March Big Mama) was heaved into conflict over
the $40 entrance fee. The basic question is over money, and who has
access to feminist institutions which charge large fees or tuition.

Though there are women of bad faith and worse politics who ex-
ploit the radical feminist movement and consciously co-opt radical
thought and action into a self-serving ideology, disguised as “liberal-
ism” or professionalism, they are not the only problem: Inexperi-
enced, but honest, feminist organizers make the following basic mis-
take. Both the Sagaris and WIAP organizers bought a “liberal
university package deal” to house a feminist gathering (perhaps in
hopes of gaining accreditation and respectability with the Man
through association).

This summer in Vermont Lyndon State demanded $400 for room
and board as CU demanded $40 for conference space. Once they
committed themselves to these prices they automatically excluded,
like the university itself, working class and most minority women.
Unless a sophisticated awareness of this is shown through a well ad-
vertised and administered sliding scale and/or scholarship process,
a project will eventually enter classist and racist grounds. Radicals
must and will confront such a project, as inevitably happened both at
Sagaris and at the WIAP conference.

These grounds are carefully planned by the corporate liberal state,
either to exclude the poor from real radicalization or by destroying
the alternative institutions through justified internal conflicts over
“open admissions” (remember the student revolts in the sixties).

No Strings

Here is an excerpt from a letter by my friend Janet Seiz about our
Sagaris experience:

“Have been reading some interesting things in Dollars and
Sense magazine. One article about higher education — it seems
governments (State and Federal) are coordinating their efforts to
reduce admissions to four-year colleges, by making financial aid
scarce, tuitions higher, and grants harder to get.

They want to make private colleges more exclusive and steer
most people into two-year vocational-oriented community
colleges. It’s all a real simple way to shore up and perpetuate the
class structure as it is, reducing upward mobility. Limiting
liberal arts educations to the privileged few.

The most interesting thing is that it’s all being masterminded
by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education, which
is/was one of Sagaris benefactors. I wish to hell we'd had the
time and good sense to research Carnegie and show them for
what they were while we were in Vermont.

We were right to see that whole thing as being very insidious
and very serious — we shouldn't have let the collective (Sagaris)
get away with that bullshit about how foundations give grants
because they want to show how “liberal they can be”.

The job of Carnegie and groups like the American Psychological
Association is to police and control through their accreditation pro-
cedures the ideology of all, especially “alternative” institutions (be
they schools of theory or therapy), to force them into ultimate har-
mony with the corporate liberal state. You can’t get their money
without getting them. We feminists need not keep repeating this
error.

Funding and accreditation by existing institutions must be open to
political questioning or all our schools and institutions will be co-
opted the minute they open their well-funded but high-priced doors.

Alternative funding, honest conditions and political and financial
accountability are examined in detail in Quest magazine, especially
their Money, Fame and Power issue and the latest on Organizations
and Strategies which can be purchased at Woman to Woman Book-
center for $2.00 per copy or from Quest: a feminist quarterly P.O. Box
