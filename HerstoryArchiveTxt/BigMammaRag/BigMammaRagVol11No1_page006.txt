Boycott!

Dole, a Castle and Cook Sub-
sidiary, has suddenly closed
down its Nicaragua banana op-
erations, leaving the Nicar-
aguans stuck with 83,000 box-
es of bananas which they are
trying to sell in Calif. Ni-
caragua's trade minister has
charged that the company's
decision was a part of the ef-
fort by the Reagan administra-
tion to destabilize the San-
dinista government. Dole had
tried to pull out of Nicara-
gua in 1980 but was talked
out of it by the Carter ad-
ministration. This time there
was no opposition to the com-
pany's decision. Boycott all
Dole Products, Bumble Bee Tuna,
Andy Boy Produce, Maggio Car-
rots and Red Coach Lettuce.

Courting Racism

Thirteen Chinese garment
workers and their supporters
were stunned on Nov. 1, when
the San Francisco District Att-
orney announced that he could
continue to press charges a-
gainst the women for unemploy-
ment fraud and demanded resti-
tution of $150 dollars apiece.
The women and their attorneys
had understood that all par-
ties would abide by the pre-
trial diversion program which
had recommended that all
charges be dropped, that there
be no restitution, and that
each woman take 20 hours of
English lessons. The case be-
gan a year ago when the women
were charged with defrauding
the unemployment fund by col-
lecting partial unemployment
benefits while supposedly em-
ployed full time--including
unpaid time they were required
to wait for work.

Victory?

A Denver federal judge re-
cently ruled that the Colorado
State Hospital's policy for
"voluntary" commitment of
juveniles by a guardian vio-
lates state law and gave the
hospital 60 days to change
its procedure. The suit chal-
lenged a procedure in which
people under the age of 18
may be committed on the sig-
nature of their guardians,
sometimes including social
service workers. However, true
to the power invested in the
legal and psychiatric system
this legal "victory" means
nothing. All four of the wo-
men who brought this suit to
court remain incarcerated.
One woman will be moved to a

"foster home"... A court date
has not been set.

Racists In Charge

Fourteen Hispanic students
from East Los Angeles were
forced to retake an advanced
college placement test when
they scored so high that test-
ers refused to believe that
they had not cheated, that
such high scores could come
from a "minority school".

The Educational Testing Ser-
vice forced through their
racist demand, and all stu-
dents again passed the test
with the same scores. The
politics of education in Amer-
ika--discrimination all the
way.

St. Anti-Semite

Last month the Pope sainted
a Polish priest, Maksymilian
Kolbe. St. Kolbe was (is) a
vicious anti-Semite, whose
hatred of Jewish people is a
matter of public record. The
Militia of the Immaculate,
founded by Kolbe, called for
the conversion of "Jews, sin-
ners, and heretics".

Why did the Pope make Kolbe
a saint? Michael Checinski,
author of the book Poland,
adds that the church carried
on a campaign against "Jews
in the government" mainly be-
cause "it regarded anti-Semi-
ticism as a powerful political
weapon against communist rule."
How is this policy still being
pursued by the Vatican?

Just A Warning

In Boston, the board of
health and hospitals has post-
ed warning signs stating,
"Nuclear War/No Shelter - No
Escape/Warning" in all non-
residential buildings in that
city. The signs are posted
next to all existing fallout
shelter signs.

Psych Torture

Judith Ratchford is now
suing her San Diego, CA psy-
chiatrist, Gary Aden, M.D.,
for $8 million. Her suit
charges that he kept her de-
pendent on drugs for over
five years and coerced her in-
to performing bizarre sex
acts under hypnosis. Aden has
denied the charges.

An additional sum has been
requested for punitive dama-
ges for "alleged" ill effects
from a combination of drugs
prescribed to her, and re-
quired medical treatment. She
suffers from a heart abnorm-
ality as a result, the suit
alleges, and she fears taking
any medication prescribed by
a doctor or psychiatrist. A

Food Now!

The lawsuit, known as the

All People's Congress and The

People of Michigan versus
Reagan and The U.S. Dept of

Agriculture, demands the imme-

diate release of the billions
of tons of food currently
stored in government and pri-
vate warehouses, and its dis-
tribution at federal govern-
ment expense. Detroit has
been declared in a state of
emergency by the Mayor, be-
cause of appalling unemploy-
ment figures, infant mortality

figures and hunger in the city.

Genocide Politics

The Cleveland Plain Dealer
(Ohio) reports that hundreds
of possibly defective cardiac
pacemakers have been shipped
into Third World countries
through MAP Int'l, Inc., a US
charity that "helps the needy
overseas". The pacemakers
were manufactured by an Ameri-
can Hospital subsidiary, Ed-
wards Pacemaker, which was
shut down in 1979, along with

an FDA ordered recall.

Bitches, Witches and Dykes

Stinking Therapy

Prison officials in Vermont
have announced they will try
a new form of "aversion thera-
py" on sex offenders. During
treatment sessions, foul smel-
ling chemicals will be pumped
into prisoners' noses when they
become aroused by erotic
photographs and literature be-
ing shown to them.
