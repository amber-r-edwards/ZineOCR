Dear Friends and Colleagues,  

I have been invited by a Peruvian  
women's organization, Mujeres in  
Lucha (Women in Struggle), to visit  
Peru during the summer of 1981. I  
will be meeting with women's politi-  
cal groups throughout the country. As  
you may know, I lived in Peru for  
several years, from 1973-1976, teach-  
ing at the Universidad Nacional de  
Centro, in Huancayo, working with  
farm women through the Confederacion  
Campesina del Peru, and participating  
in popular urban movement in the  
“pueblos jovenes" (new towns) of  
Lima. Since then I have been in close  
touch with continuing struggles there.  

In order to finance my way to Peru  
next summer, and in order to share  
knowledge about Peruvian economic and  
political life, I would like to give  
presentations in the homes of friends.  
I have pictures, music and poetry,  
as well as a great deal of informa-  
tion to share. The meetings could be  
informal potlucks or gatherings of  
people who might be willing to contri-  
bute something toward my trip or to-  
ward popular struggles in Peru.  

Please let me know if you would  
like to sponsor such an event. My  
home phone number is 777-6562.  

Sincerely yours,  
Andrea Gabriel
