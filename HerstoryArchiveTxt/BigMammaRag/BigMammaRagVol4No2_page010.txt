Not to Struggle More Frightening  

Black Woman Activist Calls Fear Healthy  

Women Against Prison  
339 Lafayette St.,  
New York, N.Y. 10012  

Assata Shakur (slave name:  
Joanne Chesimard) was found  
innocent of kidnapping and rob-  
bery in Brooklyn Supreme Court  
on Friday, December 19, 1975  
around 3 p.m. The jury had been  
out deliberating since 11:30 the  
previous morning. As the smil-  
ing jury filed out of the court-  
room, they stopped to shake  
hands with Assata and her bril-  
liant lawyer, her aunt, Evelyn  
Williams.  

It was an exultant moment for  
the women supporters who had  
witnessed the long, almost six-  
week trial from Assata’s elo-  
quent opening statement  
through Evelyn Williams’ extra-  
ordinary daily outsmarting and  
outmaneuvering of the state's  
lawmen.  

Assata now goes on trial in  
Federal Court at Cadman Plaza,  
Brooklyn, for bank robbery. Jury  
selection starts January 5 in  
Judge Weinstein's courtroom. It  
is expected to be a short trial.  
Assata’s lawyer for this case is  
Stanley Cohen. She still faces  
another charge in Brooklyn and  
must return to New Jersey to be  
tried there.

Interview with Assata Shakur  
December 29, 1975;  

Riker’s Island, New York City  
(Women’s House of Detention)  

WAP: How are you feeling about  
your recent acquittal in Brook-  
lyn Supreme Court now that the  
trial is over?  

Assata: Tired and mad that we  
were there to begin with.  
WAP: How much longer do you  
expect to be in jail?  

Assata: I don't know.  

I am sad when I see what hap-  
pens to women who lose their  
strength. They see themselves  
as bad children who expect to be  
punished because they have not,  
in some way, conformed to the  
conduct required of “good child-  
ren” in the opinion of prison  
guards. Therefore, when they  
are “punished” they feel abso-  
lution has been dealt, and they  
are again in the “good graces” of  
the guards. Approval has been  
given by the enemy but the  
enemy is no longer recognized  
as an enemy. The enemy be-  
comes the maternal figure pat-  
terning their lives. It’s like a  
plantation in prison. You can see  
the need for a revolution. Clear-  

ly.  

WAP: But there are many  
women who see the need for a  
revolution but are afraid to fight  
back. It's not just women, whole  
populations are paralyzed by  
fear of the authorities. Yet you're  
not. And that’s what makes  
women respect you. Do you  
know how to tell women how to  
lose their fear of fighting back?  
Assata: I started out with a naive  
outlook on the world and every-  
thing. Once I realized my own  
stupidity, it became very impor-  
tant for me as a human being to  
look into things, examine them  
carefully and always try to grow.  
The more you understand what  
you're dealing with, the strong-  
er you get. People see fear as a  
bad thing. Fear is healthy when  
you're dealing with Amerika. But  
when fear controls you, when  
you're afraid to struggle — fear  
is a bad thing. I'm more afraid of  
what will happen if I don't  
struggle than what will happen if  
I do.  

WAP: What do you think the role  
of women is in the struggle for  
black liberation?  

Assata: Women are capable of  
doing anything men are capable  
of doing. I don't see women in a  
confined, narrow role. The spe-  
cial role we have is to destroy the  
definition of male-female ag-  
gressive/submissive patterns and  
to create an equal kind of re-  
lationship between men and  
women; and to destroy a lot of  
myths that men have about  
women in relation to those  
societal-oriented patterns.  

WAP: How do you feel about the  
women’s liberation movement?  
Assata: I think a lot of positive  
things are the result of the  
women’s liberation movement. I  
think, however, that it has not  
expanded to include working-  
class women and Third World  
women. We must understand,  
however, that this is because of  
many reasons; some of which  
include lack of understanding,  
communication and awareness  
of each other on both sides, that  
more effort on both sides might  

accomplish the togetherness  
needed. We must understand,  
however, that women cannot be  
liberated without liberation of  
the entire society.  

WAP: There's been a lot of ar-  
ticles recently in the media  
blaming the women’s move-  
ment for what they call, ‘the in-  
creasing violence of women.” To  
illustrate their point, they use  
you, the women of the S.L.A.,  
the women who attempted to as-  
sassinate Ford, etc. What do you  
think of that?  

Assata: First, I think that the  
contradictions in this society are  
more blatant than ever. And I  
think women have responded to  
that in many ways. But in terms  
of women being more violent, I  
think that’s deceptive. It's a  
screen to avert us from seeing  
the violence of society as a  
whole. Women have been raped  
throughout history, and now  
when we fight back, now that we  
have the consciousness to fight  
back — they call us violent. To  
blame the women’s movement  
for creating a violent monster is  
insane. The violent monster is  
the American government.  
WAP: What do you think it will  
take before black women can  
trust white women?  

Assata: Practice. So much that  
has happened to black people in  
this country has happened be-  
cause of white racism. White  
women have been, historically,  
part of that oppressive neces-  
sity. How can black women not  
condemn white women for fail-  
ure to exercise their own re-  
sponsibility in eliminating  
racism?  

It would be insane for black  
people not to have distrust of  
white people. The only way that  
mistrust can be replaced by trust  
is when we see white people  
struggling against the same  
enemy. If we all can say “I pre-  

fer death to controlled liberty” —  
then we can be one. Babies are  
not born racist, they're made to  
be racist. When the values of so-  
ciety are changed and capital-  
ists can no longer profit by pro-  
moting racism, then forcing  
divisions between human  
beings will not be a necessity.  
But as it stands now, the rulers  
of this country can only con-  
tinue to exist by fostering  
racism. The more racism there  
is, the more secure their empire  

is.  

WAP: Do you think blacks in  
socialist countries are “freer”  
than in capitalist countries?  
Assata: Yes. Definitely.  

WAP: Do you think the road to  
black liberation is the road to  
socialism?  

Assata: Socialism is the cure for  
a lot that ails us, but it’s only a  
start. I think that the reversal of  
the capitalist economic struc-  

ture is only one aspect of the  
revolution that we need.  

WAP: What can women on the  
outside do to concretely help  
women in prison?  

Assata: The first thing women  
on the outside can do to help  
women in prison is to organize  
other women, and to educate  

women not only in terms of the  
oppression of women, but in  
terms of the oppression of poor  
people, black and third world  
people whether they are in  
prison or outside. It is necessary  
to educate women about the re-  
pressive role this government  
plays in human lives. Most of the  
women in prison are not in  
prison because of some “crim-  
inal streak” in their personali-  
ties, but rather because of the  
oppression that they received in  
the streets. It’s hard enough for a  
well-educated middle-class  
white woman to obtain a decent

pay and a meaningful job, but for  
a poor black woman, it's damned  
near impossible.  

Another way to help is to be-  
come active in women’s prison  
groups and to form half-way  
houses where women can come  
after release from prison. Some-  
where she can get her head to-  

gether, have time to find some-  
thing to support her, maybe get  
some skills. Because as it is now,  
women leave prison with a few  
dollars and almost a guarantee  
of coming back.  

WAP: The guards are coming. Is  
there anything else you'd like to  
say?  

Assata: Yes. I want to thank the  
people who have supported me,  
and the people who have come  
to court for me. My message to  
them is: keep on struggling.  
There are a lot of political pri-  
soners who need support be-  
sides me. We all need you.  

Cleaners Win Back Pay  

The University of Regina in  
Canada has been found guilty of  
sex discrimination and has been  
forced to pay 31 women  
cleaners the same salary as  
males doing the same job.  

But as a result of its appeals of  
the original ruling handed down  
by the Saskatchewan Human  
Rights Commission, the Univer-  
sity avoided paying a full year of  
retroactive pay adjustments.  

The case began in 1974 when  
the women’s bureau of the Sad-  
katchewan labor department  
took up the case of the women  
cleaners at the University of  
Saskatchewan who were being  
paid $155 per month less than  
men doing the same work.  

That same year, the University  
was split into two different insti-  
tutions — the University of Sas-  
katchewan and the University of  
Regina — and unfair employ-  
ment charges were continued  
against both.  

The University of Saskatch-  
ewan conceded that the jobs  
that the women and men were  
doing were similar enough to  
warrant equal pay and paid the  
women cleaners retroactive to  
July, 1973, the date when the  
equal pay legislation was pass-  
ed.  

The University of Regina  
refused to classify the women  
cleaners and an investigation  
was ordered after which the  
Human Rights Commission  
ruled that the positions required  
equal pay. The University of  
Regina appealed the ruling but  
lost after two years.  

The court, however, ordered  
the University to pay equal sal-  
aries retroactive only to July,  
1974. So, because of the legal  
maneuverings of the University  
of Regina, equality came a whole  
year later for the women  

cleaners there.
