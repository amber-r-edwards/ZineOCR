**Abortion Debate Resumes**

Clinic Raided in Italy

— A January 10 raid on a  
Florence abortion clinic has  
sparked nationwide protests and  
demonstrations, renewing  
debate on Italy’s present abor-  
tion law. News of the raid hit the  
front pages of every major Italian  
newspaper.

According to the present law,  
instituted under the Fascist  
regime of Benito Mussolini  
when contraception and abor-  
tion were considered ‘crimes  
against the integrity and health  
of the race,’ abortion is  
punishable with up to five years  
in jail for patient, doctor, and any  
third persons who contribute  
financially or otherwise to the  
act.

The military police raided the  
Florence clinic, arresting forty  
women for allegedly undergoing  
abortions. All of the women  
were immediately subjected to  
physical examinations. One doc-  
tor and five nurses were also  
arrested.

The clinic was set up in open  
defiance of the present law by  
CISA (Central Information for  
Sterilization and Abortion), an  
organization affiliated with the  
Italian Radical Party, a non-  
parliamentary civil rights group  
that has been working with the  
Italian feminists for liberaliza-  
tion of the present law.

In the 16 months since it  
opened, the Florence center  
provided thousands of abortions  
by suction method at the  
relatively low cost of $150. Free  
abortions were given to women  
who could not afford the cost.  
The clinic also organized trips to  
England for those women whose  
advanced pregnancies required  
hospital care.

Within a week of the Florence  
raid, two leading members of the  
Radical Party were arrested and  
several warned that they were  
under investigation for ‘procur-  
ing abortion and criminal  
association.’ Among those  
jailed was Radical Party  
secretary Gianfranco Spadaccia,  
who publicly claimed  
“political and militant respon-  
sibility” in the name of the  
Radical Party for the manage-  
ment of the clinic.

At a demonstration January  
14 called by various  
organizations of the women's  
movement and the Left, 8,000  
women and men in Florence  
protested the raid and arrests.  
Although police had twice  
previously forbidden marches  
through downtown Florence,  
the insistence of the  
demonstrators forced them to  
allow the protest.

At a rally in Rome January 16,  
where several thousand people  
demonstrated, the CISA  
declared that new clinics will be  
opened soon in six major cities in  
an effort to contest the law.

“As happened in the divorce  
issue,” said a speaker, “the  
problem is again one of making  
the law recognize the reality.  
Hundreds of thousands of  
women have abortions every  
year and the present law im-  
poses unbearable costs and  
dangerous conditions on work-  
ing class women...

“We are perfectly aware that  
women in our society do not  
resort to abortions because they  
want them, but because they are  
forced to do so due to inefficient  
distribution of safe and effective  
contraceptives and because of  
oppressive social and economic  
conditions.”

The first conference on abor-  
tion held in Italy was called joint-  
ly by the Radical Party and  
various feminist groups shortly  
after the clinic raid. On the first  
day of the conference, 52-year-  
old feminist Adele Faccio,  
sought by police for her co-  
responsibility for the clinic, gave  
herself up. While television  
cameras recorded the  
proceedings, Faccio was han-  
cuffed and arrested as the 5,000  
conference participants com-  
plied with her requests for  
silence.

The conference demanded  
change in abortion laws which  
would make abortion available  
to all women.

As the law stands now,  
women who wish abortions and  
can afford expensive  
gynecologists ($500 to $1,000)  
can buy their way around the  
law. The expensive private  
clinics which offer relatively safe  
and sanitary operations have  
never been raided.

For poorer women, however,  
abortion means submitting to  
crude ‘backstreet’ abortions or  
home-made remedies, risking in  
either case serious com-  
plications and death.

The situation is made more  
dramatic by the almost total lack  
of information regarding the  
use, safety and different forms of  
contraception. Although it has  
been legal to advertise con-  
traceptives since 1971, it  
remains a crime punishable by  
six months to two years in prison  
to distribute or sell them.

The specific demands put  
forth at the conference which  
will be added to a bill now before  
Parliament are that pregnant  
women and not doctors should  
have the first say as to whether  
the abortion is to be performed,  
that abortions should be free,  
and that national and regional  
governments must provide sup-  
port for unmarried women who  
decide to have a child.

FDA Allows Modified Shield on Market

Against the recommendation  
of one of its own advisory com-  
mittees, the Food and Drug Ad-  
ministration (FDA) announced  
recently that it would end the  
moratorium on the marketing of  
the Dalkon Shield Intrauterine  
Contraceptive Device (IUD) to all  
of the distribution of a modified  
type of the shield when it  
becomes available.

Although there are no com-  
plete statistics, at least 13  
women have died from infected  
miscarriages attributed to the  
Dalkon Shield since it was in-  
troduced in 1970. Two hundred  
and twenty-three infected mis-  
carriages have also been at-  
tributed to the shield.

The FDA decision will allow  
A.H. Robins, the manufacturer  
of the Dalkon Shield, to dis-  
tribute the modified shield under  
a “formal registry and reporting  
system,” to doctors who must  
only agree to tell the company  
how many pregnancies and in-  
fections occur, and other data.

A.H. Robins had suspended  
distribution of the device on  
June 27, 1974 at the request of  
the FDA, following a wave of  
protest about its hazards. The  
chief known danger of the  
Dalkon Shield is infected  
pregnancies with the device in  
place, causing septic or infected  
miscarriage, severe illness and  
sometimes death.

Data compiled by the Depart-  
ment of Health Center for Dis-  
ease Control shows that of  
women hospitalized during  
pregnancy during the first six  
months of 1973 for a possible  
IUD-related complication, about  
62% were wearing the Dalkon  
Shield. The Dalkon Shield ac-  
counted for approximately 39%  
of the IUDs in use during that  
period.

Particularly alarming about  
the Dalkon Shield-related  
deaths is the fact that the infec-  
tions moved throughout the  
body very rapidly, with no  
localized symptoms to alert the  
woman to a possible cause.

It is not known exactly why the  
Dalkon Shield causes the infec-  
tions. The device resembles a  
flat crab, with barbs on either  
side, and has the largest surface  
area of the IUDs in use.

One doctor who published a  
report on four of the deaths  
associated with the shield  
speculated that there might be  
something about the design of  
the shield that allows the carry-  
ing through the bloodstream of  
infection that might otherwise  
be locally contained.

Another scientist has  
speculated that the Dalkon  
Shield is hazardous because it  
has a multi-thread or multi-  
filament string attached to it, ex-  
tending out of the uterus into the  
vagina, which has been shown  
to have the ability to harbor  
bacteria which the single fila-  
ment string type of IUD does not  
have. The shield was designed  
with the multi-filament string  
because it makes it more difficult  
to expel the device.

A third possibility is the large  
surface area of the shield,  
which, according to one scien-  
tist, “acts as a foreign body,  
predisposing the placental site  
to acute inflammation.”

The FDA does not require  
safety and efficacy tests for  
hardly any types of IUDs, in-  
cluding the Dalkon Shield,  
because they are classified as  
“devices” rather than drugs,  
even though they are implanted  
in the body. (The only types of  
IUDs considered drugs are the  
Copper 7 and the Copper T  
which, the FDA admits, lose  
copper into the uterus.)

According to Anita Johnson of  
the Health Research Group,  
(HRG) a public interest organiza-  
tion, “The drug law says that the  
manufacturers have to prove the  
safety of a product for it to be  
sold, but with a device, the  
burden is on the government to  
prove danger.”

“All this time women have  
been using these things almost  
without testing,” points out  
Johnson.

The new version of the Dalkon  
Shield that A.H. Robins intends  
to put on the market sometime in  
the second half of 1975, will be  
changed only in having a string  
with one filament rather than  
the multifilament string in the  
old one. Studies on the use of the  
new type of shield in animals  
have not been required by the  
FDA, although when question-  
ed, an FDA spokesperson  
responded, “the company  
probably did some.”

“The FDA has chosen to accept  
the explanation that the mul-  
tifilament string is the cause of  
the infections, although, “There  
is no evidence that other aspects  
are not responsible for these  
tragic pregnancies,” notes  
Johnson.

One member of the FDA’s own  
Obstetric and Gynecology Com-  
mittee, which had recommend-  
ed that the shield remain off the  
market until the safety questions  
were resolved, resigned in  
protest over the FDA’s  
decision.
