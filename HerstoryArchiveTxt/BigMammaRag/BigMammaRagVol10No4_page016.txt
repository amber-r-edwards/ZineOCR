ize and build a well, or pro
vide a road, or some commun-
ication...something that
helps make their lives better.
And, that organization has
been part of the revolutionary
movement. It's a logical
progression. It's not like
the church set out to make

a revolution. But, it's kind
of a result of that reali-
zation that people have a
right to certain things.

Then, would you say that
the church functions differ-
ently in Central America than
it does here?

Yes, in this country, in
my work of doing education
about Central America, the
place where I meet the most
opposition is in church
groups. And, in terms of the
women's movement that is true
too, that the church is more
conservative. Whereas in

Third World countries (I saw
it in Africa, too) the church
is an institution where
they're working to help wo-
men organize and be educated.
It's similar to what's
happening to poor women here
in the U.S.--the primary
concern is family and child-
ren. Everything is centered
around what's best for them.
Poor women here try to get
food stamps, or welfare, or
a job, so that their children
can have a better life. In
El Salvador, you might have
a woman who says "I have two
choices--to die of hunger,
or to fight." There's really
nothing else. The women ref-
ugees I work with were talk-
ing about hope, and I fin-
ally asked them--where are
you getting hope? Immediately
the 34-year-old widow who
had two days previously gi-
ven birth to the eighth child
said “Everything will be
fine now because the baby is
healthy." If they can give
them a start, then there is
hope. They don't have the
luxury of worrying about
equality in jobs, because
there are no jobs. And, it's
the women who suffer most,
because if there is any food,
it goes to the children first.

are either dead, or off
fighting.

What are some of the issues
of concern to women in El
Salvador?

Water is a key one--so much
of a woman's life is spent
carrying water. And there is
sanitation--just building
outhouses. And, then, edu-
cation is the primary con-
cern. They are recognizing
the need for education, even
though they often don't have
access to it. It's basic
needs.

Is the position of women
in Nicaragua changing now?

In Nicaragua, I think about
two thirds of the lea-
ders at the time of the tri-
umph were women. At this
point, many of the people in
the higher offices in govern-
ment are women. So there is a
side by side moving forward.
The women are in the militia
in the defense, they are pre-
pared to take their place
and fight to preserve the
revolution. And, in the go-
vernment, people who have
the same level jobs get the
same pay. But there's still
a distinction between those
who are in power and those
who are poor.

There is a national women's
group as part of the govern-
ment structure in Nicaragua
and in Cuba for the purpose
of helping women. In Cuba,
the national group has a
house where they bring women
from isolated areas, and
teach them, for example, how
to sew, and then send them
back with a sewing machine
so that they can teach other
women.

Looking forward (in El Sal-
vador's case), or looking at
Nicaragua now, how is the
role of the church changing?

In Nicaragua it is exciting
what's happened with the
church. The church is so
strong, and part of the rev-
olution. The church is part
of everyone's lives. Again
you have to talk about two
churches. The hierarchy is
definitely questioning, open-
ly challenging the government.
They're not so willing to say
that this government may be
doing good things--they're
more conservative. But the
popular church is saying "we
need to organize in such a
way that we can help move the
revolution forward"--to
achieve the purposes for
which they were fighting--

a unification of the country,

working together for the
rights of all, and more of

a co-op situation in the
rural areas as well as the
urban areas. There are neigh-
borhood organizations--for
instance, outside of Managua
in a smaller community, they
conducted a malaria campaign
--the neighborhood groups
organized so that by ripple
effect, there was a spreading
of information and action
throughout the country. And,
they have organized to the
point where they have people
on patrol in neighborhoods,
for protection, and to guard
against counter-revolution-
ary covert action. And, the
church is really a part of
that.

In Central America you're
looking at 95% Roman Catholic
population. Indigenous rel-
igions have been combined in
many cases with Catholicism.
The symbols, for instance, of
indigenous religions are
combined with the Catholic
tradition. So there is a real
blend.

Are there conflicts between
women and the church around
certain issues, as there are
here? For instance birth con-
trol and abortion.

Well, you have to look at
the infant mortality. Birth
control is not available to
all. But in some ways it's
not even an issue--children
are so important, and many
women don't want to use birth
control. Increasingly, though
women are wanting birth con-
trol, and the women's organi-
zations are trying to provide
that, especially the use of
breastfeeding as birth control.

If the church is involved
in that, isn't that a contrad-
iction?

Well, I am part of the

Catholic church. But I am
not paid by or working dir-
ectly for the church. I am
working for the people. One
of the very strong teachings
of the church has always
been individual conscience.
And, the struggle comes when
individual conscience doesn't
go along with the official
teachings (e.g. with birth
control). There is a constant
pull in balancing that.
There is a lot of struggle.
There is a lot of personal
responsibility that weighs
heavily.

I stay within the structure
to work for change. It's the
work that is happening at the
grassroots level that makes
a difference.
