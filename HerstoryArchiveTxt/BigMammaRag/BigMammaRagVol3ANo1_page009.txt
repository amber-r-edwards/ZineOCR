Reactions  

Dear BMR:  

We, Arlene Gardiner and Julie  
Stark, were both involved in the  
conception and initial organiza-  
tion of the Denver Coalition on  
Sexual Assault (DCOSA). We are  
presently community workers at  
the Southeast Denver  
Neighborhood Services Bureau  
(SEDNSB). We stress though  
that the views expressed here do  
not represent nor reflect those of  
other members of SEDNSB and  
that we are responding to Ms.  
Lease’s article “Politics of Rape  
in Denver” independently of our  
involvement in the SEDNSB.  
However, our involvement in the  
bureau has afforded us ample  
exposure to the development of  
DCOSA and other agencies and  
groups involved with rape  
prevention, counseling and  
research in Denver. It is from  
this perspective that we respond  
to your article.  

We both became involved in-  
itially with DCOSA in early  
February of '74, Arlene as a  
representative of Women in  
Transition and Julie as a con-  
cerned individual. Our un-  
derstanding of the purpose of  
DCOSA was that women in  
Denver needed to form a  
mechanism to get information  
about services and make that in-  
formation on rape prevention  
etc., available to victims and not  
as stated in Ms. Lease’s article to  
absorb an overload of speaking  
engagements from the SEDNSB.  
It should be noted that SEDNSB  
began its operations in January  
of '74 and was just getting on its  
feet so there wasn't any existing  
backlog of anything.  

First of all the information  
about DCOSA is not updated and  
doesn't cover the total spectrum  
of people's recent involvement.  
For one thing DCOSA has a new  
director Susan Weeks who is in  
the midst of developing a new  
direction. We consider it a major  
discrepancy to have neglected  
the coalition's recent activities as  
well as Ms. Weeks' endeavors  
owing to past resentment. It  
seems like a majority of your ar-  
ticle is based on allegiance to  
certain agencies and individuals  
and totally negates the value of  
others without having recently  
investigated them.  

I, Arlene, was a member of the  
counseling task force from its  
conception to its demise and  
although I felt the steering com-  
mittee hampered efforts of the  
task force, the task force  
members admitted, when they  
withdrew from the coalition, to  
taking responsibility as well for  
their own lack of initiative. Much  
was talked about and little done  
when members had the oppor-  
tunity i.e. to create an escort and  
transportation service, better  
bus service, better street lighting  
and various other projects.  

We agree with your statement  
about the absolute necessity of  
self-defense classes. But you've  
contradicted yourself and misled  
the reader. The SEDNSB is LEAA  

funded and is definitely in-  
terested in self-defense classes  
which the Bureau is presently  
participating in. Also, the Capitol  
Hill Storefront is LEAA funded.  
So, your statement about  
LEAA’s lack of involvement in  
rape self-defense is simply un-  
true. The SEDNSB has also been  
actively involved in self-defense  
classes in Aurora and currently  
is involved in the origin of two  
rape prevention classes in  
Jefferson County.  

In regards to your innuendo  
the Denver General Hospital  
Violence Research Unit is racist  
and selective as far as whose  
phone calls they return, we have  
heard of no complaints of this  
nature in the course of our  
professional contacts with them.  
You should also be aware that  
due to the nature of their  
research it would be counter-  
productive to not return phone  
calls.  

Granted, we realize that all is  
not perfect with the federally,  
locally and privately funded rape  
prevention, assistance and  
research programs but funds  
have been provided to in-  
dividuals who are internally com-  
mitted to this problem. And to  
negate their existence and value  
because of internal bullshit and  
personality conflicts is in itself a  
crime against women.  

We take personal issue with  

your statement “other rape in-  
terest groups aren't as excited  
about women” etc. You also  
state that there appears to be  
a lot of anxiety coming from the  
established victimization group  
when new groups attempt to  
provide services. First of all, as  
far as we know the bureau has  
the only existing victimization  
program that deals with rape  
prevention, 24-hr. emergency  
assistance, counseling of vic-  
tims and various other aspects of  
victimization in the city of  
Denver. We are the only com-  
munity workers in Denver that  
we know of and we certainly  
don’t feel threatened nor  
anxiety-ridden because of the  
advent of groups working with  
rape victims, in fact we welcome  
it. The only qualms we have are  
that there has been little com-  
munication between the new  
rape interest groups and  
ourselves. We are open to com-  
munication which we feel is es-  
sential to avoid duplication of ef-  
fort and to coordinate activities.  
We have spoken personally to  
close to 8,000 potential victims  
and victims of rape and also  
potential victims of burglary,  
robbery and assault. The two of  
us alone cannot possibly meet  
the total needs of the residents  
of Denver and we don’t pretend  
that we can. So, we recognize  
the necessity and importance of  
other groups getting involved.  
You state that statistics say  
that “40% of all rapes are  
preventable if women would not  
think of themselves as persons.”  
We say that 40% would be  
preventable if women DID think  

of themselves as people. It  
would be lovely to be able to go  
for a midnight stroll through  
Cheesman Park or to thumb a  
ride home after school or work  
but we do not live in a society  
that permits women the freedom  
of these actions. For those who  
want to take the risk the results  
can be devastating. We don’t  
condone these limitations and  
find them personally frustrating  
and infuriating. However, com-  
mon sense can dictate  
precautionary measures and  
women can get involved with the  
fundamental issues of rape to  
bring about an end to this sexist  
crime against women.  

BMRA has in spite of itself  
defeated what we perceive to be  
its purpose. Few of us have  
much faith in the “straight”  
press and depend upon alter-  
native publications like BVA to  
present us with more accurate  
and less biased reports of a  
situation or incident. The repor-  
ting done for ‘The Politics of  
Rape in Denver” article was in a  

sense an injustice to your  
readers. Editorializing is great  
but you should present an article  
as either an editorial or a report.  
You are claiming to write a  
report when in fact it is seven  
columns of editorializing, innuen-  
dos and some outdated and un-  
true information. We see the ob-  
jective of an editorial to present  
the author or editor's bias and  
we have no argument with that.  
It is just when the editorializing  
and factual reporting begin to  
blend into a hodgepodge of per-  
sonal bias and new and old infor-  
mation that issue must be taken  
with this sort of “alternative”  
publication you are offering the  

women of Denver.  

In closing, in all fairness to  
your article most of the informa-  
tion provided about the existing  
services was valuable and we're  
glad you publicized it.  

Julie Stark  
Arlene Gardiner  

Ed note: In an interview with  
Kathy Saltzman last July who,  
until recently, was the director of  
the Denver Coalition on Sexual  
Assault (DCSA) she stated that a  
reason for the creation of DCSA  
was to alleviate the heavy re-  
quests for speakers on the topic  
of rape that SEDNSB was receiv-  
ing. This does not negate or deny  
any other reason for the forma-  
tion of DCSA. It is good that new  
leadership exists for the group,  
but I wonder if the steering com-  
mittee structure remains? The  
OSCA is infamous in its reputa-  
tion for being elitist and un-  
responsive to its members. To  
expect people to feel otherwise  
is unrealistic and who really  
cares anyway? There are many  
things going on in the city of  
Denver dealing with rape. It  
seems that you refuse to accept  
many people's bad feelings for  
DCSA by invalidating them. Too  
bad. Because if the group is truly  
changing then it seems you're  

Big Mama Rag  

not and the old cycle will in-  
evitably repeat itself.  

The article you are responding  
to does not negate the existence  
of federally, locally or privately  
funded rape prevention. Some  
programs have tended to negate  
themselves because of (in your  
own words) “internal bullshit  
and personality conflicts” that  
have seriously affected their  
effectiveness in dealing with the  
violence of rape.  

And so the “crime against  
women” to which you refer is  
the double one of being raped  
once by the rapist and again by  
agencies that tend to be too  
hung up on professionalism and  
money to do anybody any good,  
including the women who  
happen to be involved in them.  

Another point, just because  
you two have heard of no com-  
plaints concerning the “racist  
and selective” returning of  
phone calls that the Violence  
Research Unit at DGH has been  
known to practice doesn’t mean  
that this hasn't happened. Your  
chauvinism is showing. The  
selective returning of calls is  
common knowledge among  
many community anti-rape  
groups. But I suppose that this  
lack of responsiveness has  
clearly shown these groups just  
which agencies do care and  
which collect comfortable  
salaries to give lip service to the  
problem. And the VRU wonders  
why not many minority women  
respond to them. Goddess, how  
blind and deaf can bureaucracy  
get!!  

Any woman at any time can be  
raped in this society. This is no  
accident — nothing peculiar to  
the '70s or the recession or  
women’s liberation or any other  
sociological incident. It is an es-  
sential part of a patriarchy that  
essentially rewards woman-  
hatred not only in its men but  
also in its women. And it is the  
lack of a political analysis of rape  
that makes groups rely on  
statistics such as the number of  
victims contacted, the decrease  
in the number of rapes, the  
number of new street lights in-  
stalled to be the sole indicator of  
what is happening and why.  

It seems that you are saying  
that it is because most women  
don’t think of themselves as per-  
sons that they get raped.  

To me, this shows incredible  
lack of understanding of your  
sisters. It also shows a naive un-  
derstanding of rape. It negates  
the woman's experience of op-  
pression and subjugation in the  
world. It doesn’t help anybody. It  
perpetuates the myths you are  
working hard to eradicate. I don’t  
think you realize this — it may be  
that you're too close to an agen-  
cy that is too limited in its scope  
(of dealing with rape) and you're  
too involved in a job.  

But I feel that we agree more  
than we disagree. I think that the  
time to form a new coalition is  
here as many other people have  
also suggested.  

There are many people doing  
good things in Denver about  
rape. This does not exclude the  
SEDNSB. Many people are in-  
terested and want to do  
something, as is evident by the  
number of calls we receive con-  
cerning the problem of rape. So  
let's not waste time.

Rape Response  

Dear Big Mama Rag,  

Thank you for your excellent  
follow-up article on the rape  
situation in Denver. We of the  
NOW rape Task Force would like  
to share with you and your  
readers our objectives for 1975.  

1. Lobby for the legislative  
changes currently proposed  
by Rep. Arie Taylor of Denver.  

2. Support any or all programs  
or individuals working in the  
area of rape prevention or  

Vol. 3-A, No. 1  

education, or treatment of the  
victim or offender. This plan  
includes the Denver Coalition  
on Sexual Assault as well as  
those groups who have  
chosen not to be a part of the  
Coalition.  

3. Make a film of a male rape to  
use at presentations before  
male groups who ask for  
speakers.  

4. Expand our existing  
volunteer program at DGH to  
CGH and other interested  
hospitals and to more of a 24  
hour a day coverage. Make  
other hospitals aware of the  
rape kit and encourage its use  
whenever a rape victim is ex-  
amined.  

5. Give aid and support to the  
Capitol Hill Community  
Storefront in their efforts at  
rape awareness and self-  
defense training. This plan  
includes supporting the treat-  
ment program proposed to  
the Storefront by Bill Casey of  
the Jefferson County Mental  
Health Center.  

6. Advocate the use of a special  
prosecutory team for all sex-  
ual assault cases rather than  
the current rotating  
assignments. We feel this  
will enable prosecution of  
sexual offenses by a group  
with special training and ex-  
pertise that will allow a more  
equal footing with the  
defense team. Currently an  
inexperienced trial deputy DA  
is pitted against a highly paid  
“legal-eagle” who has  
known all the tricks for 20  
years. (This concept has been  
tested in Indianapolis where  
the special team won convic-  
tions in 12 of 12 cases. These  
results are rather startling  
compared to the conviction  
rate in Denver.)  

7. Encourage all victims to  
report the crime to the police  
and follow it through criminal  
court until the assailant is  
either incarcerated, in treat-  
ment or under strict  
probationary supervision.  
Plea bargaining will be sup-  
ported only when it achieves  
these ends. We will also en-  
courage and support victims’  
pressing their cases in Civil  
Court where a judgment of  
75,000 dollars was recently  
awarded against two rapists  
who had pleaded guilty but  
who had received suspended  
sentences.  

To those who would en-  
courage more radical action we  
suggest that they also get  
together. We currently feel  
that we can gain more by work-  
ing with some individuals and  
systems rather than against  
them. When we feel, however,  
that regular pathways are block-  
ed we will resort to more of a  
public challenge. We have no  
grants to protect and we depend  
on no groups for data to justify  
our existence and our worth. We  
don’t have to justify our salaries  
because we are all volunteers.  
Anyone interested in working  
with us can contact Judi Stut-  
man at 388-6389 or Hannah  
Evans at 573-0393.  

A CIA Plot?  
Dear Mama,  

In the December/January  
issue of BMA, there were 26  
women’s activities reported in  
the “Feminist Calendar of  
Events.” There was also an an-  
nouncement in bold type that at  
last, “THERE IS A WOMEN'S  
COFFEEHOUSE IN DENVER!!”  
All of these are held at some E.  
Colfax place named only,  
“Storefront.” It is important, for
