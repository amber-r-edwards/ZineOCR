MA Woman Responds  
About Anti-Semitism  

Dear the Women of Big Mama Rag,

I am a Jewish woman involved  
in the feminist and gay/lesbian  
movements. Currently I am a  
member of the Boston chapter  
of the New Jewish Agenda, a  
group formed about a year ago  
which is (to quote from its  
statement of purpose): "com-  
mitted to Jewish peoplehood  
and to fostering a progressive  
voice within the organized  
Jewish community, American so-  
ciety, and among our people in  
Israel and the Diaspora." As a  
member of the local Feminist  
Task Force, I am writing in  
response to your articles and  
letters on anti-Semitism and  
racism.

I was very pleased to see  
the articles on racism and  
anti-Semitism in the November  
issue of the newspaper, and  
equally pleased to see that  
this forum continued in the  
December issue. However, I  
must disagree strongly with  
the letter from Sandy Katz,  
Shelly Kushner, and Louise  
Brotsky.

I agree with you that Jews  
in the United States do not  
today face the same magnitude  
of oppression that people of  
color do. For most Jews in the  
United States there is not a  
question of economic, physical  
and cultural survival, as  
there is for people of color.  
I would like to point out,  
however, that contrary to the  
stereotype, not all Jews in  
the United States are well  
off, especially older people.

Anti-Semitism, in this coun-  
try, is generally not as  
strong and violent as other  
forms of racism. It does ex-  
ist, nonetheless, and anti-  
Semitism has a long history in  
this country, as it does in  
any other country with a Chri-  
stian foundation. I think be-  
cause of the history of Jew-  
ish people, any manifestation  
of it has to be watched care-  
fully and fought. That means  
within the feminist movement  
as well. I do not by any means  
mean to suggest that anything  
like the Holocaust is about to  
happen in the United States--  
far from it! But because of  
it, we have to be wary of any  
sign of anti-Semitism, be-  
cause we know just how far it  
can go. That's why I've been  
heartened to see articles dis-  
cussing anti-Semitism in the  

feminist movement. Anti-Semi-  
tism, like other forms of  
racism, does exist within the  
feminist movement because the  
women in the movement grew up  
in this society. I think it  
is important to fight all  
forms of racism, and not to  
establish a hierarchy of op-  
pression--how can you say  
that one form is worse than  
another?

However, I must disagree  
with you about Israel  
and Zionism. While I criti-  
cize many actions of the Is-  
raeli government, such as  
the settlements in the West  
Bank, the dynamiting of  
houses belonging to "suspec-  
ted terrorists" who may be  
nothing more than school  
children throwing rocks at  
policemen, the closing of  
Bir Zeit University in the  
West Bank, the racism within  
Israeli society, the discri-  
mination suffered by Jews  
from Arab countries, Prime  
Minister Begin's unwilling-  
ness to try for peace and  
instead relying exclusively  
on military might to main-  
tain the security of Israel,  
etc. The list is long. None-  
theless, I adamantly refuse  
to accept the indictment of  
Israel as a "settler colonial  
state" and I refuse to ac-  
cept the equation of Zionism  
with racism. The national  
liberation movement of no  
other group of people is  
equated with racism and no  
other state, however corrupt,  
imperialist, or authoritar-  
ian, is denied the right to  

Kim Womantree/Big Mama Rag,  

exist. (I support the crea-  
tion of a Palestinian state  
in the West Bank and the  

Gaza Strip, as demanded by  
the recent Saudi peace plan).

While harsh criticism can  
be made of the Israeli gov-  
ernment treatment of Pales-  
tinians, of its refusal even  
to consider the creation of  
a separate Palestinian state,  
etc., I do not think Israel's  
actions towards the Pales-  
tinians can be compared to  
the Nazi treatment of the  
Jews. Israel is not trying  
to exterminate the Palestin-  
ians. I think it is an in-  
sult to those whom the Nazis  
killed to compare the ac-  
tions of a Jewish state to  
the actions of Germany.

You say that in order to  
fight anti-Semitism, we  
should "fight against white  
supremacy and ally ourselves  
with forces who actively  
oppose racism and fascism."  
I couldn't agree with you  
more, but I think we ought  
to be very careful to in-  
spect their record on anti-  
Semitism and their view of  
Israel. The Left has not al-  
ways been terribly eager to  
support Jews. The current  
government of Poland (the  
military junta) is current-  
ly blaming the Jews for the  
Solidarity movement. This  
is despite the fact that  
there remain only six to  
twelve thousand Jews in all  
of Poland.

I have been pleased to see  

that women in the feminist  
movement are skeptical a-  
bout many Leftist positions  
on women. Don't you think  

we should be equally skepti-  
cal about incorporating this  
particular Leftist belief  
(anti-Zionism) into the fem-  
inist movement? It seems to  
me Robin Morgan had a good  
idea when she turned her  
back on the Left in her es-  
say "Goodbye to All That."

Thank you,  
Rebecca Lesses  
Cambridge, MA  

Collective note to Rebecca,  
We agree that feminists  
should not accept any "lef-  
tist", or feminist for that  
matter, ideology uncritical-  
ly. (Although in the letter,  
we assume you mean the "male  
left" because we on BMR con-  
sider ourselves and the pa-  
per leftist. However, neith-  

er BMR nor any but a very  
few "pro-Soviet Union forever"  
type papers equate the mili-  
tary junta in Poland as rep-  
resenting leftist progress  
there. Feminists and Leftist  
papers have almost without  
exception supported Solidar-  
ity, and opposed the junta.

IL Women Write  

Dear Big Mama Rag,

We are a group of five Jew-  
ish Lesbians from Chicago who  
have been meeting for over a  
year to discuss the meaning  
of being Jewish in our lives.  
We are directing the following  
comments to Sandy, Shelly and  
Louise in response to their  
letter concerning Zionism/  
Racism in the December, 1981  
issue of your paper.

Your letter says, "We can't  
be off bemoaning our Jewish  
oppression and equating our-  
selves with third world peo-  
ple." We do not equate or  
compare our oppression with  
the oppression of any other  
race of people. What upsets  
us is that you have placed us  
on a "scale of who is most  
oppressed" and imply that  
Jews are so low on the scale  
that our oppression is not to  
be taken seriously. It is  
true our oppressions are dif-  
ferent and these differences  
must be acknowledged and re-  
spected. That does not mean  
that Jewish oppression is not  
real and should not be taken  
seriously as any other form  
of racism. If we continue  
fighting about who is most op-
