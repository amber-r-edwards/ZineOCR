Matrix looks at the lighter side of classism  
Fool-Proof System For The Inexperienced  

In the April issue of Matrix, a feminist/Lesbian publication from Olympia, Washington, the collective published a "Class Watcher's Guide for the Inexperienced" that is reprinted below. In their introduction they said, "It has come to the attention of the Matrix Collective that some of our readers are not yet aware of the sure-fire signs which can be used to immediately identify persons of different class backgrounds. In the spirit of community service, we have developed this fool-proof system for class identification. We have provided this illustrated version for your enjoyment. Keep this chart for future reference, and feel free to add any signs you have observed which are not included here. Happy Class Watching!”  

Matrix is published monthly and is available by subscription for $6 per year. Write to Matrix, P.O. Box 7221, Olympia, Washington 98507.
