Nevertheless the shocking
of older people continues.
People in their eighties or
nineties have been shocked.
There is even a reported case
of (Minnesota Medicine, 1974)
a ninety-four year old woman
being shocked, simply because
she refused to eat and was
apparently suffering from "an-
orexia-nervosa". After her
5th shock treatment, the
staff found that she was
"very cooperative, ate well
and showed almost no paranoid
thinking." The woman, probab-
ly damaged by ECT, was then
sent to languish in a home
for the aged.

Some doctors specialize in
giving ECT to old people. A
psychiatrist Alan Gunn-Smith
once admitted to administer-

The Twelfth Annual International Conference for Human
Rights And Against Psychiatric Oppression will be held
in the Denver area in late May or early June, 1984. The
conference brings together about 150 current/ex-psychi-
atric inmates/"mental patients" from across the US and
Canada. Anti-psychiatry activists (who are not ex-in-
mates themselves) are welcome if sponsored by an ex-
inmate group. Ex-inmates living in the Denver area who
are interested in working on/having input into the or-
ganizing of this conference please contact:
Conf. Comm., Box 61307, Den., CO 80296, or call 393-7026.

Seniors have the highest
rate of suicide...Dr. Shul-
man, an Ontario psychiatrist,
believes that the suicides
of elderly people are the re+
sult of undiagnosed but tre-
atable depressions. "The av-
erage elderly suicide has on-
ly a mild to moderately se-
vere disorder, a condition
common to many of our older
population."

It seems that their social,
political and economic situa-
tion is ignored or has been
re-defined as a series of me-
dical problems amenable to
psychiatric treatment.

Interestingly enough, many
of these suicides are caused
by painkillers, sleeping
pills and antidepressants
prescribed by physicians.

Studies show that the mor-
tality rate increases drama-
tically when elderly people
are institutionalized rather
than being given home or co-
mmunity care.

Discharged psychiatric in-
mates and the elderly are
presently sharing a common
vulnerability at the hands
of provincial governments,
which have enacted a policy
of deinstitutionalization
and cutbacks without provi-

ding community-based support.
