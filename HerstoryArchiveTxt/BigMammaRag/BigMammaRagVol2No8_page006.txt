Games We
Still Play

Anne Zeigler

The new wave of Feminism, the sisterhood we have generated
over the past few years, and the embryo accomplishments of our
new consciousness have given women a glimpse of the heights and
breadths we can reach as women. And yet, simultaneously with
our growth as Feminists, we have developed a new repertoire of
games (some of them insidiously incorporating Feminist analyses)

as a new rationale for passivity.
I have found many ac-
complices in my own self decep-
tion, and have substantially aid-
ed other women to deceive
themselves. Some of the games
we play are new disguises for old
ploys—others are developed as
we are increasingly exposed to
new and threatening situations
and need some way to hide from
ourselves and whomever we are
trying to manipulate into loving
us. As we allow ourselves to
continue to play these games,
we remain bound to the tread-
mill of non-success which has
been trapping us for centuries.
“Dancing Dog”

I call the first game “Dancing
Dog,” after an often-quoted in-
sult of Ben Johnson: “A learned
woman is like a dancing dog: one
wonders not that it is done well,
but that it is done at all.” The
woman who plays dancing dog
tends to be astonished that she
actualizes anything at all, and to
expect others to praise her for
doing much less than she really
can. This is a good way to avoid
criticism, as a dancing dog can
hardly be criticized for not being
Rudolph Nureyev.

Dancing Dog is also a very
effective way to avoid the con-
flict of not wanting to fail, but of
being afraid of success, a dilem-
ma in which many women often
find themselves. Sisters who
reinforce a player of dancing
dog, refusing her the dignity of a
loving but honest appraisal of
her work, may do so for many
reasons. I think these reasons
are mainly rooted in the issues of
identity and competition. Rather
simply put, if we are male-
identified to some extent, a
woman who does well becomes
a competitor for approval and
attention. If we are struggling to
become woman-identified, we
have to face the scary situation
of knowing that we, too, can
succeed, and deal with all the
fears that success evokes.

Another dynamic that main-
tains the game of Dancing Dog is
our ineptness in handling feed-
back. Rather than accepting
feedback as an opportunity for
growth, we often see it as a
critical undermining of our
achievements, and even more
intensely, as an undermining of
ourselves. And rather than giv-
ing feedback in a loving, tactful,
sharing way, we tend to feel
critical out of our own sense of
competition or inadequacy, and
to avoid anything like criticism,
lest it reveal our anger or fear or
insecurity. We are not so fragile
that we should be afraid of
breaking or destroying each
other by assuring each other of
our potential for growth.

“There, there, dear, you just
cry all you want to.” All the nur-
turing and caring that we have
developed are used in this game
to smother us. Nurturing should
make us stronger in the face of
obstacles, should generate
energy, should encourage us
with the knowledge that we are
loved and unconditionally
worthy of love.

“There, there” is a game in
which support becomes
crutches, and stumbles and falls
evoke attention and sympathy
for their own sakes. We need to

learn to express our concern, but

we need to help each other to
realistically analyze and con-
front setbacks, fears, con-
ditioning, rather than to wallow
in them. We need to help each
other to develop discipline and
staying power, to gain a sense of
perspective towards obstacles.
Girls Give Up

Experiments with children un-
der two years of age have shown
that little boys, when confronted
with a barrier between
themselves and their mothers,
will try to cross the obstacle or
find a way around it, with some
persistence. But small girls, if
they try at all, give up soon and
cry to be rescued. The habit of
giving up was ingrained in us
very early, and we need to
recognize it and gain a sense of
faith in our power over our en-
vironment, rather than to admire
ourselves and others for the
number and difficulty of the
adverse circumstances we find
and create for ourselves. We all
need help and love, but we must
learn to ask for and give help and
love, rather than to ask for rein-
forcement for pain and failure.

Dilettante: this is another
favorite game, which seems to
spring from several sources. The
first is that it's okay for a woman
to be bright...but not too bright;
competent...but not too compe-
tent. So when we find ourselves
getting competent, we switch to
another area of interest where
we are less accomplished. This
way, we don’t violate any
achievement taboos, but still can
find challenge and opportunity
for growth.

A dilettante is spared the
frightening responsibility of tak-
ing herself or her work seriously,
of avoiding the risks involved in
commitment to one discipline,
and some dilettantism also
seems to be a remnant of the
way we prepared ourselves to be
ready to help our man in his
work—whatever it turned out to
be; to be sufficiently informed to
be stimulating companions, but
not so much as to be com-
petitive. A smattering of
everything makes us more
marketable, adaptable to more
men’s lifestyles.

Begun to Explore

Another, and more positive,
source of dilettantism is the fact
that we have begun to explore
the world around us with a new
attitude, that it is full of exciting
things in which we were
previously forbidden (by custom
and isolation, as well as by law)
to participate.

But as we establish our new
identities as actors rather than
as bystanders and helpers, we
are going to have to learn the
habits and attitudes of commit-
ment and serious participation,
rather than those of helpful
amateurs and accessories.

Us-Them: one of the most bla-
tant manifestations of our in-
security is our tenden-
cy—still—to find strength and
identity in elitism. “We older
Feminists” do not have any
monopoly on the right ideas or
any superiority as women, just
because we have been aware of
our oppression for a few years
longer, or know the rhetoric a lit-

“Great Art” proves that men are
superior to women, that men are
women, being labeled “Great
Art,” almost all of which, as the
anti-feminists are fond of
reminding us, was created by
men. We know that “Great Art”
is great because male authorities
have told us so, and we can’t
claim otherwise, as only those
with exquisite sensitivities far
superior to ours can perceive
and appreciate the greatness, the
proof of their superior
sensitivity being that they
appreciate the slop that they
appreciate. — Valerie Solanas,
Scum Manifesto.

tle better than other women

We are all just beginning to
ask the right questions, let alone
struggle through to the answers
that will liberate us. There are
many people with whom we may
disagree; there are many times
when we know that sharing past
experiences could provide some
guidance to other women who
are in the midst of similar ex-
periences now. But to deny
another woman's feelings or ex-
perience, or to subject her to
ridicule because she has not
learned the same lessons in the
same way will only reinforce all
that traditional conditioning to
which she has been sub-
jected—it will not strengthen
either of us or help to unite us.
There is no us-them; there are
different perspectives and
knowledge and strengths and
experiences. To push someone
over into a “Them” position
limits her, implies that she is not
capable of growing and
changing—limits us in our small
progress—and exemplifies the
caste system in its most efficient
operation.

There is more than one way to
be a Feminist, or even a Radical
Feminist; there are important
issues and trivial ones; there are
concessions we all make to sur-
vival and comfort. To make each
other feel guilty or less woman-
ly; to perceive ourselves in the
role of exemplar of
Feminism—or even more
destructively, as inadequate at
Feminism—will drain energy
that should be used for creative
and constructive solutions to our
differences and difficulties.

The games I have discussed
here are ones which I play all the
time, and help others to play.
They are especially prevalent
among white Feminists with
middle-class origins. To deny
our origins is to deny our roots;
but recognition of the sources of
fear and games will strengthen
us. We owe it to each other to
stop playing and start challenging
each other to grow.

"Rebels or Collaborators
Raps Florynce Kennedy

Carolyn Agosta

Once more Denver received
an earful in the form of Florynce
Kennedy, radical, Black,
Feminist lawyer. Her “rap”
began with four songs, three of
which are take-offs from the
originals, “Richard, the Red-
Necked Reindeer,” “Abortion
Rap,” “Striped Christmas,” and
“God Rest Ye Merry
Gentlemen.” Since she was
speaking at the University of
Colorado Medical Center, her
talk centered around the

medical profession. She stated
that the health community has
been neutral in the past...but
that now, no one can be
neutral...we are either rebels or
collaborators.

“Women are still studying
nursing and if there ever was a
group of ‘niggerized,
niggerizers,' it's the nurses.”
Niggerization is a divide and con-
quer technique, a sort of DandC
Strategy, and is a part of the mid-
dle class. But according to her
claim, there is no real middle
class, since 90% of the country is
poor and the other 10% is rich.
This was demonstrated during
the tornadoes. People who had
been labeled “middle class” lost
their mortgaged homes, cars;
people who had thought that
they were ‘above’ welfare,
suddenly were forced to turn to it
for help. This “instant niggeriza-
tion brought on many symptoms,
like paranoia, that are
associated with poor people.”

M.D. Fetus-fetish

Ms. Kennedy talked about the
nursing profession and the
whole medical profession as not
being ‘absolutely dedicated,’
that politics plays a large role in
them. Gynecological

departments are heavily
dominated by Catholic men,
fetus-fetish M.D.s, who take the
stand that any woman who
wants to terminate a pregnancy

is only going through a ‘phase’
and when the time comes, she
will “happily” become a mother.
(??) She spoke of the medical
profession losing the mythical
respect of the poor. The profes-
sion needs to reach into the
community and bring “the
message from the outside in.”
Since there is very little light
coming into the profession, peo-
ple think that doctors are always
right.

Another interesting point that
Ms. Kennedy mentioned was the
fact that “up until 1869, the
Catholic Church allowed abor-
tions of a fetus that was male up
to 40 days and a fetus that was
female up to 80 days.” (That
should be a good clue as to what
the church thinks about us
(women!!?) Now the Catholic
Church is in the forefront with its
concerns about continuing un-
wanted pregnancies...

Breakdown Elitism

Flo Kennedy praised the CU
Medical Center Women's
Caucus (who had sponsored
her). It started around faculty
and now includes students and
clerical personnel, which has
very much enriched it. “The
hierarchical professional elitism
is breaking down.”

To close, here is a quote from
Flo Kennedy, call it a thought for
every day: “Anyone who is close
enough to hurt us has some
weak point that we can shoot
at.”

Ed's note: Florynce Kennedy is
one of the founders of the

National Organization of
Women, a member of the
National Black Feminist

Organization, co-author of the
book Abortion Rap, and
author of Pathology of Oppression.
