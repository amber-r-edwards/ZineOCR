A woman's place:  
Breaking Bonds  

Janet Sergi  

Women are changing. What is a  
woman's place? How can we  
become new women? Today old  
modes of acting and interacting  
with one’s self and others are  
unacceptable. We cannot be the  
ever-nurturing females that  
many of our mothers were.  

Both our biological and  
mythical mother figures have  
forsaken their own identities to  
shape and mold their daughters  
and sons into the roles the  
patriarchy needs. Sons become  
workers or the professional  
elites. These males are  
psychically nurtured from birth  
to death by females: first by  
their mothers, then by  
mothering wives, and lastly by  
mothering daughters/nurses in  
old age.  

In a patriarchy, sons revolt  
from their nuclear family ties  
and set off on their own. In the  
course of a man’s rebellion, he  
finds a female who performs the  
nurturing role for him. In  
heterosexual men this takes the  
form of a wife and the cheap  
service and labor of women in  
the economy; homosexual men  
just have the latter.  

Women are men’s prime  
possession. This is the reason for  
the extreme competitiveness and  
aggression of males. The results  
are war, capitalism and of  
course, woman's  
dehumanization. She is but an  
object. Her function is to serve  
man. She cannot help herself  
nor her female children. A  
female has no identity other  
than her connection to the male,  
i.e. women take the last name of  
their closest male relative.  

Mothers break their bonds  
with their female child early.  
The daughter begins to nurture  
the other children in the family  
and dotes on her father before  
she is grown. Freud is incorrect.  
The daughter is socialized in a  
patriarchy to nurture her father  
and all men not for love but for  
survival. She turns into a  
mother/wife before she is  
allowed to be a daughter, a  
female to herself. This lack of  
mother nurture and female self  
identity produces much hatred  
and jealousy among women.  

This kind of horizontal  
hostility among women weakens  
them and makes them more  
amenable and available to the  
male power structure. The  
female has only one role, that of  
mother. Still after four years of  
feminist training, I tend to think  
of others first, afraid or unsure  
of my own needs.  

A new role for woman would  
be that of a daughter, a female  
for herself. A daughter nurtures  
herself. A daughter rebels  
against everything that denies  
her her own energy. A daughter  
climbs every hill and valley of  
experience without even the  
thought, “Is this proper for a  
woman to do?” A daughter to  
herself is the greatest threat to  
the patriarchy. She deprives men  
of female nurture and service.  

Men use women's energy to  
control the world for their own  
benefit. Control and power are  
the unifying concepts of sexism,  
racism, classism and imperialism.  
White, upper-class men control  
the rest of the world’s energy.  
First, they usurp their mother's  

energy, then through their  
patriarchy they become a  
parasite to all women, the lower  
classes, and other races.  
Females, racial minorities, the  
working classes and the Third  
World have no identity or power  
other than their nurturing role  
to white males.  

Radical feminism begins to  
break this cycle of oppression.  
Daughters become daughters to  
themselves. Females begin to  
have a self-identity. They keep  
their own power and energy  
unto themselves. Thus white  
males are deprived of ill-gotten  
energy. Men are not allowed all  
their mother’s energies. The  
cycle begins to break. Men are  
not given the right to other  
people's energy, be they female,  
poor or racially different.  

What is needed is a daughter’s  
rebellion. Rebellious women are  
daughters to themselves; the  
vitalities of a new order. A  
daughter to herself keeps her  
power and energy to herself and  
thus stops the vicious cycle of  
white male supremacy.  
Concretely, we need to learn  
skills in all fields of human  
endeavor. And we need  
to build a woman's community.  

These communities should be  
social and political units capable  
of giving love and support, time  
and energy, and wisdom and  
knowledge to other women. A  
women’s community is the place  
where women’s energy will be  
generated and stored.  

The minority and Third  
World Communities are building  
their power bases. Likewise  
women must regroup themselves  
for the long task ahead. We are  
working for a place where each  
of us is powerful unto herself.  
The patriarchy needs to be  
replaced, not by a matriarchy  
nor any form of hierarchy, but  
by an energized society. It might  
be called a woman's place;  
a woman's place is a place for  
herself.
