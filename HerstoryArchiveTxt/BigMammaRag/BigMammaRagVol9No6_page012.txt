Population Control - Aid Or Attack?

Susan Goding

Technology, with all its
labor-saving devices, has
often been credited with
liberating women, freeing us
from the worries of house-
wifely duties. Contraceptive
devices are sold to us with
the same sort of promises:
liberating us from the wor-
ries of unwanted pregnancy.

Sterilization

Birth control pills, the
IUD, Depo Provera and assort-
ed other new contraceptive
methods foisted on women
each year. Barrier devices,
such as the cervical cap,
which are the safest to a
woman's body and very effec-
tive in preventing pregnancy,
are increasingly being regu-
lated by the government.
(See BMR, April 1981) Depo
Provera, on the other hand,
which is known to cause dam-
age to women's bodies, is
still readily available to
many women around the world.

Through lies and coercion,
we are often inflicted with
the least desirable, least
healthy kinds of birth con-
trol. The damage and illness-
es the new technological ad-
vances in contraception
wreak on us give us an idea
about who the contraceptive
techniques are serving, and
it's not us.

Controlling women's repro-
duction and sexuality has
been a major interest of the
ruling class for the last
century. Such familiar names
as the Rockefeller Foundation,
the Carnegie Institute, the
Ford and the Mellon Founda-
tions have all sponsored,
with millions of dollars, re-
search into eugenics, "men-
tal hygiene", and contracep-
tion; all of which have been
and are being used as meth-
ods and excuses for popula-
tion control.

Controlling reproduction in
different population groups
has been the response of the
ruling class to threats to
its wealth and power. The
ruling class has, through
its tax-shelter foundations,
developed techniques to ef-
ficiently and inexpensively
control who has children in
the world. By restricting
abortions for all women and
then pushing sterilizations
on selected populations, the
ruling class is able to sub-
stantially influence the
growth of the population of
their target groups. For
example, in the U.S., abor-
tions are becoming more and
more restricted and contra-
ceptive methods and infor-
mation are being banned
through efforts of the right
wing movements. White women
are literally being forced
into pregnancy, whereas
women of color are being
sterilized, often through
coercion and lies.

The eugenics movement came
along at a time when the
ruling class needed an ex-
cuse for passing restrictive
immigration laws. Eugenics
conveniently provided the
"proof" that foreigners, es-
pecially those with dark
skins, were hereditarily
inferior to U.S. born whites
and should be kept from in-
fecting the crowded slums
with bad genes, typhus and
socialist/anarchist politics.
Eugenicists contended that
"mental defectives" propa-
gated so wildly that society
would become overrun with de-
generates, and they were
determined to save the
world for the brightest and
the whitest, themselves.

In 1922, the elite medical
and legal professionals drew
up a "model sterilization
statute" for national enact-
ment, proposing the mass
sterilization of drug addicts,
syphilitics, lepers, others
with chronic illnesses, the
blind, the deaf, the deformed,
"ne'er-do-wells", tramps,
paupers, orphans, and others
regarded as a drain on socie-
ty. An estimated 15 million
persons would have been af-
fected by this act, which
never passed but which reflec-
ted the official and unoffic-
ial practices in some states.
It may be noted that this act
apparently served as the model
for the Nazi mass-steriliza-
tion program started in Ger-
many in 1933. One drafter of
the act was Harry Laughlin,
once superintendent of the
Carnegie-funded Eugenics Re-
cords Office. The Eugenics
Records Office, among other
things, trained field workers
to track down and monitor
people with suspect genealogy.
According to C.L. Gaylord,
Laughlin received an honorary
degree in 1933 from Germany's
Heidelberg University, a major
Nazi research center on
race purification for his
contributions in eugenics.

The middle and upper class-
es welcomed and generously
funded the movement for "men-
tal hygiene". The Rockefeller
Foundation was a major contri-
butor to the National Commit-
tee for Mental Hygiene (NCMH)
(founded in 1909). The Common-
wealth Fund, Carnegie Corp.
and others gave substantially
to the NCMH propaganda efforts.
The NCMH, among its many ac-
tivities, urged Congress to
pass laws requiring mental
exams for all aspiring immi-
grants and trained policemen
in mental hygiene ideology.
Better mental hygiene was
even exalted as the solution
to labor disputes, class
struggle and international
problems. Today, more effec-
tive methods of population
control are exalted as the
solution to those same "pro-
blems" and are being paid for
by the same foundations.

The Rockefeller Foundation,
International Planned Parent-
hood (Rockefeller-controlled),
the Population Council and
the Ford Foundation still
fund much of the research in
population matters and birth
control, although gradually
they have introduced the
concept into U.S. governmental
agencies and finally into
United Nations policy.

In 1958 the first recom-
mendation was made to Con-
gress to finance population
research by the Committee to
Study U.S. Military Assis-
tance Programs. In the 20
years since, the concept of
population control has be-
come a central part of the
foreign policy of most cap-
italist countries.

The majority of non-mili-
tary U.S. foreign aid is
administered by the Agency
for International Develop-
ment (AID). AID was created in
1961 as part of the State
Department but since 1979 has
been elevated to a free-
standing agency of foreign policy
reporting directly to the
President. (Carter was form-
erly the president of the
Tri-Lateral Commission). The
AID budget doubled during the
Carter administration to over
$4 billion and involves ser-
vices or grants to more than
60 countries. Although AID's
plans for modernization in-
clude such projects as build-
ing roads and rural electifi-
cation, an increasing propor-
tion of funds are budgeted
specifically for population
control.

AID's projects are closely
tied to another program ad-
ministered through the U.S.
Department of Agriculture--
"Food for Peace". In this
program, acceptance of popu-
lation control programs is
a precondition necessary for
foreign governments to pur-
chase U.S. food surpluses.
(It's interesting to note
that the chairman of the
Senate Agriculture Committee
is Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC)
who is also a member of the
Human Life Amendment Commit-
tee, which is pushing to out-
law abortions and contracep-
tive devices in the U.S.)

The government and ruling
class have zeroed in on con-
trolling women's lives, con-
trolling our reproduction and
sexuality, controlling the
number of children we have,
in order to solve their "pro-
blems" before they're born.
