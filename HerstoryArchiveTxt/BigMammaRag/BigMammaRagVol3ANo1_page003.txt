Letters Home to Mama

Thanks for Listening  
Dear Janet,

I want to thank you many  
times over for your review of  
Yesterday's Lessons — we have  
been freaking out at some of the  
reviews which are meant to be  
positive reviews — but are con-  
descending or miss the whole  
sense of who Sharon is or feel  
sorry for her — Also Sharon has  
been blown out by the reviews  
and responsive thinking that  
people are laughing at her —  
Really liked how you managed to  
combine your own ideas with  
Sharon's sense of life and  
politics — Again thanks. It’s real  
important that women listen to  

each other. Glad you were  
listening...  
Best to all at Big Mama.

Unknowingly Knowing  
Jane Alpert  
Dear BMR,

My first gut-level knowledge  
of Jane Alpert occurred while  
reading Jane's “Letter to the Un-  
derground” and “Mother Right”  
articles in Off Our Backs about a  

year and a half ago. Jane’s  
words concerning her breach  
with the New Left and her recent  
and ongoing commitment to the  
Women’s Movement were  
honest and moving. They left  
one feeling that Jane Alpert was  
somehow, somewhere (despite  
her constant attempts to stay  
underground) doing what she  
could to participate actively in  
the Women's Movement. I was  
left feeling that Jane Alpert was  
a courageous and optimistic  
woman.

Several months passed and  
the Denver Free University  

offered what sounded like a  
most intriguing course in  
Women’s History to be offered  
by a woman named Carla  
Weinstein. I enrolled in the  
class.

Carla was an extremely know-  
ledgeable, articulate and sen-  
sitive teacher. She brought new  
insight and excitement to the  
lives of the women in her class.  
Each week, knowledge of the  
class spread by word of mouth  
and each week more and more  
people were in attendance.  
Eventually, her class was packed  
like sardines into two rooms at

the Women In Transition House.  
And there, for several months  
we read about and studied  
evidence and theories concerning  
the early matriarchies, the  
beliefs and political/religious  
persecution of the witches, and  
the “first wave of feminism” of  
the nineteenth century and its  
relevance to feminism today. All  
in all, a most dynamic learning  
experience. And after the class  
drew to a close, Carla informed  
us that she was leaving on a  
several year archaeological ex-  
pedition — a feeling of deep per-  
sonal loss prevailed among her  
students.

I nearly forgot about Carla for  
quite some time. Suddenly, a few  
weeks ago, while mindlessly  
flipping through the pages of  
Newsweek a picture of Carla  
appeared before my eyes. My  
first thought was that Carla  
Weinstein had made some im-  
portant archaeological find. But  
the story that went with the  

Big Mama Rag  

Vol. 3-A, No. 1  

photograph told about Jane  
Alpert recently turning herself  
in. I stared at the picture for quite  
some time, certain that she and  
Carla were one and the same.  
But then, remembering the  
archaeological expedition,  
I figured they must simply look  
remarkably like one another.  
However, a few days ago, The  
Rocky Mountain News confirmed  
my original thoughts by stating  
that Jane Alpert had recently  
turned herself over to  
authorities in Massachusetts  
after having lived and worked in  
Denver, Colorado for two years  

under the name of Carla Wein-  
stein.

Since then, I’ve found myself  
constantly thinking about  
Jane/Carla. I remember her  
moving testimony of commit-  
ment to women printed in Off  
Our Backs, I remember her as a  
person — warm, sensitive, and  
an inspiring orator and teacher.  
I'm left feeling that as Jane  
Alpert faces a lonely and gruel-  
ing period in her life, that period  
called a prison term, I would  
somehow like to thank her for  
her courage, her inspiration, her  
direction, and her optimism in  
the face of incredible danger. In  
these days, when she is most  
likely filled with memories of  
loneliness, the inability to share  
fully her life with others, grave  
fear, constant running and con-  
stant danger I would like her to  

know that at least one woman's  
memories of her are very fond  
and profoundly grateful.

Credit Graphics!  
Dear Big Mama:

I am surprised at your ap-  
parent negligence of your ar-  
tists.

Some of the best drawings in  
your double year-end issue were  
not credited. (Witness page 5 —  
“High Priestess,” page 5 —  
“Psychic Power,” page 7 —  
“Rapist Killers,” page 11 and es-  
pecially page 22-23 — “Poetry,”  
page 26 “Spiritual Legacy,”  
page 26 “Filling Up,” page 28.

What gives? The rest of your  
drawings, and even  
photographs, are credited. If the  
artists who produced the above-  
mentioned works are listed as  
“contributors,” there is no way  
we could tell. This is grossly un-  

fair to the women (We assume  
they're women) whose work  
appeared in the last issue and  
other issues where this has  
happened.

One of the premises we  
operate on is that women should  
be recognized for their work.  
How can we be recognized in the  
world at large if our own sisters  
don't?

Please list the artists by what  
they do — all — not just a  
haphazard few. I read your paper  
regularly, and c'mon, you're  
better journalists than that! And  
please fill us in on who did the  
drawings in the last issue not  
credited. The world is watching  
how we treat our sisters.

In love,  
Julie  

Ed. Note: Your criticism is well-  
founded. We would like to point  
out, however, that our over-  
sights are not intentional. They  
are the result of too much work  
and not enough women to do it.  
So come on in and help. We can  
use you on production so that  
this doesn't happen again. We  
look forward to seeing you! High  
Priestess was credited to the  
Lesbian Tide. “Psychic Power”  
was done by Susan Binder; the  
graphic which went with the  
“Women Kill Rapists” article  
was from Liberation News Ser-  
vice; the two uncredited  
graphics on the poetry pages  
were done by Lori Wendel; we  
have been unable to locate the  
artist who did “Filling Up”; un-  
credited graphics with “Spiritual  
Legacy” were done by Ruby  
Charisma, I.R.B. Trout, and  
Miriam Flambe. To these artists  
we extend our apologies.
