LIBERATION BEGINS

One evening in Venice, Cali-
fornia a couple of years ago a
friend and I, in a fit of bour-
geois debauchery, sat drinking
Scotch and water over a hand of
rummy. I was keeping up a pat-
ter of light conversation to
hide the fact that I was losing
the game. The light conversa-
tion being the women's movement.
My friend was basically a cynic
and I was into the revolution:
down with the ruling class (the
rich) and worry about petty de-
tails like the alleged oppres-
sion of women later. Not want-
ing to be accused of turning on
my own people I always gave a
polite interest to the rising
fury of women, but frankly I
felt that it was an unnecessary
factionalization of the radical
movement (whatever that was).
Actually what was happening was
that I was getting my political
analysis from the circle of male
politicos, well-read and arti-
culate, that made up many of my
close friends at that time.

So anyhow, over the Scotch,
Joyce and I sat talking. "You
know," sez I, being just as cute
as hell, "some of my best friends
are men." We kicked that around
for a while. We came to the con-
clusion that even worse than that
(and it's true) is that few of

my best friends at that time were
women. I began to consider that
maybe it wasn't some kind of ac-
cident that most of the women I
knew were as boring as hell:
never activating anything on
their own, but existed only in
their relationship to some guy
somewhere, like my boyfriend
this or that. It is pretty hard
to gain valuable companionship
from a person who ain't even
there. Many things, thoughts
that had been laying dormant in
the back of my mind came into
being that evening. Mostly they
concerned my own identity: not
exactly who I was, but definitely
who I was not.

I was in love with James Dean.

Through the course of our con-
versation that night we discov-
ered that we had never seriously
thought of ourselves as women.
Our heroes were male. I was in
love with James Dean—in fact, I
adored James Dean—I idolized
him. That passion, that heaviness
of misunderstood youth,
that sensitivity suppressed and
manifesting in violence. He
seemed so real. In a word, I
wanted to be James Dean. And
it had never occurred to me un-
til this drunken evening that I
could never be him, not even in
a hundred years of affected
heaviness. No, cruel world, I
would have to be James Dean's
woman. I would have to be pa-
tient with that passion. I
would have to be understanding
of his confusion. I would have
to be tolerant of his self-

exploration. Oh shit, a self-
image torn from me. For my
friend and I could suddenly see
that all the admirable traits
that we so loved in our heroes
were reserved for males and for

us was the role of the woman be-
hind the man.

Valour, bravery, adventure,
commitment to an ideal, the hun-
gry intellect, the bursting to
explore the world around us:
in our posters these attributes
are not expected of or condoned
in women. With the most outrageous
blatancy and with every subtlety
the role of contented mother is
enforced in our psyches. And the
goal of life, the final (ABSOLUTELY
FINAL) glory to our beings is to
be chosen by the best man we can
get (of course, as you grow past
youthful beauty you must lower
your expectations somewhat so as
not to be left unchosen). Our

beings, after we have left our
father’s house, are defined by
the man who has chosen us. And
how proud we can be to be picked
by one of those fine noble men,
the man with a social conscience,
the man with high standing in
the community, the liberal-
minded man who is proud of his
wife, who wants her to put forth
her ideas, in the PTA and in
Democratic Party Women's lunch-
eons. How lucky we can consider
ourselves at being absolved of
the responsibility of having to
define ourselves, of having to
activate our own life—for we
will simply be judged by whom we
have married.

a devastating revelation

Perhaps for some of you read-
ing this it is not much of a
revelation. For my friend and
I it was devastating. Suddenly
there was a limitation put on
us—or rather it was not sudden,
only we had just become aware of
it. We had before obviously al-
lowed ourselves the delusionary
luxury of relegating ourselves
to the special position of excep-
tional women. We considered our-

selves apart and above that de-
plorable mass of women with their
self-imposed dullness and insipid
characters. In our stupid
ignorance, we had assumed that
each individual female was to
blame for her own lack of self-
growth.

For we had not understood the
dynamics of the culturized, in-
stitutionalized, and yet worse,
internalized concept of women in
this society. A role so linear
and confining as motherhood is
expected to fulfill our self-
hood. It is hardly the stuff a
girl child should be expected to
dream on. Unfortunately it is
not only expected to be the
dream stuff of the girl child,
but the reality of the grown
woman. With the highest sophis-
tication of the capitalist econ-
omy women are preyed upon with
this artificial picture of
femaleness. There can be no mis-
taking of the image: ever
searching for ways to be even
more attractive to our mate,
like somehow we owe him that for
his choosing us. Ever search-
ing for new and better ways of
serving our family, unselfishly
devoting the rest of our lives
to their happiness. In a sense,
forgetting your self to serve
other selves. And even more
disheartening is that there was
no alternative to this lifestyle
for a woman, only sad excuses.

dictated roles

The role of mother for each and
every woman has been dictated to
us with the import of religion,
in the sense that to try to es-
cape or alter this fate is the
same as blasphemy to most
people.

We, I, have internalized much
of this propaganda about what a
woman is. I have internalized
it to a point that I very much
need the support and under-
standing of women who are exper-
iencing these same things. Per-
haps now we can begin to explore
who we CAN be. It will be a
long and hard struggle because
we are defying a role which is
