work as labor for which wo-  
men should be compensated.  
Eve tries to get the women  
in her building to collectiv-  
ise housework. Later, when  
her husband says she can't  
use the car because he's paid  
for it, she responds, "If I  
earned money for what I do  
all day, I'd buy a big bus and  
everyone could ride--every-  
one but you!"  

The film does not pretend  
lesbians are perfect. A mem-  
ber of the largely childless  
gay movement, Liliane has ne-  
ver had and doesn't unders-  
tand the responsibility of  

raising children. When Eve  
expresses longing for her  
daughter and son, Liliane  
storms away, exclaiming "Mo-  
thers!" in exasperation.  

The movie's main flaw is the  
overabundance of mushy scenes  
in which starry-eyed femin-  
ists gather around to sing  
Meg Christian's "The Rock  
Will Wear Away," the film's  
theme song.  

Despite its sentimentality,  

A Woman Like Eve is a thought-  
ful, sensitive and accurate  

film about a subject which is  
almost invariably mistreated.
