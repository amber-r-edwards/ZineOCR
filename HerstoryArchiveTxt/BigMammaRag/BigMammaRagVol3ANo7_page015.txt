Mothers Hassled

Three mothers in Miami,  
Florida, have been tossed out of  
a public park for breastfeeding  
their babies in public. Said Parks  
Director Howard, “Breastfeeding  
is a natural and beautiful act,  
but it’s an act for the home, not a  
public park where kids play."  
Said one of the mothers, “The  
people who complained  
probably raise their kids to think  
that breasts aren't for anything  
other than display in Playboy  
magazine.”
