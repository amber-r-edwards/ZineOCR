...From the Publisher

The women of America are about to be  
had. Again. Still.

This time it’s (heaven help her) the work-  
ing mother. She’s about to be canonized,  
synthesized, and utilized in everyone’s inter-

An instant institution.

The wheels of industrial and political  
clout grind exceedingly large and exceeding-  
ly fine. Large enough to create another self-  
serving tradition they’re calling Working  
Mother’s Day and fine enough to pulverize  
whatever chance women ever had of escap-  
ing the oppression of McCall’s magazine.

Remember McCall’s? And their big “to-  
getherness” theme that dumped so much of  
the burden and responsibility of marriage  
onto women that it drove them back to work?

Well, guess who’s waiting at the work  
place? And guess what the next impossible  
dream is going to be. And guess who’s going  
to be responsible. And guess who will have  
all the burden. And all the worry. And all the  

feeling of inadequacy. And failure. And frus-  
tration.

The Working Mothers of America, that’s  
who.

Because McCall’s isn’t going to tell hus-  

bands, sons, bosses or brothers what they  

can do to help. In fact they’re going to blame  
you if the men in your life don’t rally round.  
You didn’t ask them right. Or plan it right.  
Or plead or cajole just right. You didn’t say  

please. You criticized too much or didn’t  

praise enough. You were ungrateful. Or  
demanding. Or hysterical. Or...sound fam-  

iliar?

Working Mother’s Day is a male trip.  
And it’s a clever one. For along with the  
most sanctimonious public appreciation of  
her role in American Society, the working  
mother is about to have dumped on her a  
dose of social standards and consumerism  
that will most likely break her back if not her  

Same old tune. Just double the trouble.

Good luck to us.

A Violation of  

Rights  
I recently dined at a bar/restaurant  
called Our House in Brighton and  
am writing to urge other women  
not to make that same mistake. The  
reason: my date and I were both  
given menus but mine had no  
prices. Thinking I was correcting  
an oversight, I mentioned my (par-  
don the expression) priceless menu  
to the waiter after ordering. He  
replied that the menus given to  

women were intentionally priceless  
so that “they wouldn’t have to  
think about the cost of a dish while  
ordering.”

I asked him what made the  
management think that the man  
would always be taking care of the  
check. He answered that men did  
in most cases. Choking on my  
mushrooms, I told the waiter that  
their “priceless” policy had just  
lost them a paying female cus-  
tomer.

I never thought eating out  
would make me so sick.

Commendable

I'd like to commend you for run-  
ning the intelligent and com-  
passionate article “Alone and  
Afraid” by Nene Hauck and  
Talbot about the violation on  
Aid for Dependent Children (AFDC)  
by Catholic women regarding the  
abortion experience. The article  
was very moving in its description  
of difficulties faced by women  
when they exercise a right that is,  
after all, a fundamental constitu-  
tional right — the right to make  
decisions about problem pregnan-  
cies in accordance with their own  
consciences and sound medical  
practice.

“Priceless”

As an AFDC mother and journalist,  
an outrageous violation of chil-  
dren’s rights has come to my atten-  
tion.

During the current search for  
battered children across Massa-  
chusetts by the Department of Pub-  
lic Welfare, Aid for Families with  
Dependent Children (AFDC) recip-  
ients may be required to fill out  
a form for each of their children. This  

bureaucratic process marks the children as  

welfare babies for the rest of their  
lives.

The Department of Public Wel-  
fare uses the customary white  
cards, but before they are turned  
into the Social Security Office a  
caseworker adds a coded number  
on the back. The forms are for-  
warded to the national office in  
Maryland where the identity is in-  
vestigated for fraud and the num-  
ber assigned.  

You must file a form,  
completed application at the nearest social  
security office yourself. It takes  
approximately six weeks to pro-  
cess.

You must also bring to the  
social security office the child’s  
birth certificate, proof that the  
child exists like an immunization  
or medical record or a library or  
report card, and identification for  
yourself. Do not use any kind of  
welfare identification or it will be  
marked on the application perman-  
ently and kept in their records.  

The records cannot be changed.

Victory  
Thank you so much for the very  
generous write-up you gave to the  
signing of the Displaced Home-  
makers Bill. After working for  
passage of the bill so long and so  
hard, it was gratifying to see it  
treated as the very important piece  
of legislation that it is.

I, together with other members  
of the Chapter, particularly  
appreciate the fact that Equal  
Times gave NOW credit for their  
part in the “victory,” since dis-  
placed homemaker legislation has  
been a priority item with us on both  
the national and local levels for  
several years. Three different task  
forces worked on this bill in Massa-  
chusetts over the years, and many  
different members contributed to  
the final triumph.

On behalf of all of them, thank  
you.
