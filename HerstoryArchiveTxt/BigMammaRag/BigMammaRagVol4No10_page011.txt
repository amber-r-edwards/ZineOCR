Mini-Conference Held at CWC

Terra

Women from across the state met at  
Colorado Women's College to exchange  
information and ideas, September 24,  
at the Mini-Conference on some imme-  
diate needs of Colorado women.

The conference was sponsored by the  
Colorado Commission on the Status of  
Women (CCSW). Those in attendance  
appeared to consist only of women  
from the Commission and “cooperating  
state-wide agencies," who were in-  
vited to report to the group, per-  
haps partially due to the inconven-  
ient time for most working women  
and lack of child care.

The CCSW, made up of 48 commission-  
ers appointed by the Governor, has  
several accomplishments in its 15  
year history. Some of these achieve-  
ments are: the creation of the Vir-  
ginia Neal Blue Resource Centers for  
women throughout the state, research  
and lobbying concerning the role of  
women in Colorado's state-supported  
schools, the creation of a career  
Talent Bank of women available to  
appointment to government positions,  
aid in drafting and passing Colora-  
do's Equal Rights Amendment, and ex-  
amination of C.E.T.A. with regards to  
the needs of working women. The Com-  
missioners meet quarterly, with meet-  
ings in different parts of the state.  
They are open to the public.

The Mini-Conference consisted of  
reports from the commission and the  
state-wide agencies invited to speak,  
a speech by Congressperson Patricia  
Schroeder, a wine & cheese fundraiser  
for ERA Colorado, guest speaker Mar-  
jorie Bell Chambers, president of  
Colorado Women's College, and a floor  
discussion on the future of the CCSW.

Commission Reports

Several CCSW committees gave re-  
ports. The Budget report is avail-  
able on request and outlines the use  
of its $24,500. The Education Com-  
mittee has been compiling a file on  
equal opportunity resources and a  
brochure which it distributed to edu-  
cational institutions state-wide.  
The brochure asks such relevant ques-  
tions as "Are males counseled into  
different careers than females? Does  
your school have an affirmative  
action plan?"

Questionnaires to those running for  
public office were sent out by the  
Legislative Committee to determine  
the candidates’ stands on women's  
issues, the results of which they  
will publicize. They also scheduled  
a "Meet the Candidates" meeting and  
compiled voting records on incumb-  
ents. Some work has also been spent  
on putting bills before the legisla-  
ture. For example, the Lawyers for  
Colorado Women analyzed discrimina-  
tion by the insurance industry which  
led to the introduction of insurance  
bills favorable to women into the  
1975 Legislature.

The purpose of the Women in Govern-  
ment Committee is to increase the  
number of women in the state govern-  
ment. In the past there have been  
too few women appointed to powerful  
policy commissions. The record of  
Governor Lamm is considerably better  
than those of his predecessors—59%  
of his appointments to commissions  
have been women.

Reporting for the Minority Women  
Committee, Gerry Maestas stated a  
hope to work for poor women more  
next year, that the Commission be  
"concerned about equal credit but  
also food stamp rights. . . Our  
(poor women's) issues are the same,  
with only perhaps a few which are  
more complicated to address."

Other Organizational Reports

The reports from other state  
women's organizations offered infor-  
mation on a wide range of activities.

ERA Colorado chairperson, Gail B.  
Villa, charged a “lack of support"  
from individual Commissions for work  
on ERA projects. She emphasized the  
direness of the situation, "begging"  
the commission's help. Stressing the  
importance of Colorado success as  
part of the national campaign for the  
U.S. Constitutional amendment, she  
stated, "If stopping the repeal ef-  
fort is a reality, now is the time  
(for the Commission) to step for-  
ward." Fundraising events in Octo-  

our long herstory. And unlike our  
sister writers of the 1950's, we  
have the beginnings of an alterna-  
tive to the male-dominated publish-  
ing world which would ignore, dis-  
tort or exploit our work.

The subject of where do we go  
from here included a workshop on  
the question, What is lesbian-  
feminist literary criticism?

"I know I'm asking more critical  
questions (of women's literature)  
than I did in 1972," one woman  
said. Her view was shared.

But in asking those questions, do  
we need to develop a new way of  
doing so? Just what goes into  
"constructive" criticism? How is  
it different from traditional  
criticism which often posits a  
hierarchy ranging from “another  
Shakespeare“ to "worthless." How  
do we avoid its opposite, the "Isn't  
it wonderful you finally took pen  
in hand" approach? How do we  
provide good feedback to lesbian  
writers whose work falls short of  
what we consider to be "quality"?

One woman put it this way:  
"Telling the truth can be done with  
a certain amount of sisterhood,  
without saying, ‘You are a piece of  
shit.'"

Another suggested that good  
criticism basically meant putting  
a writer's views in context of time  
and place, keeping in mind the  
readers' context as well.

Still another offered three  
criteria for most writing: Does it  
raise consciousness? Does it invite  
dialogue, and does it contribute to  
culture?

No clear consensus emerged from  
the workshop on what constitutes  
lesbian-feminist criticism. But  
participants agreed that both  
aesthetics and content are important  
to good writing, qualified by one  
woman's caution: “What is considered  
well-written is still so culturally  
conditioned. We need to see with  
new eyes."

Also on the future directions  
theme was a workshop on entertain-  
ment writing, where participants  
agreed that humor, mystery, fantasy  
and speculative fiction are still  
too scarce in our writing. Yet  
they are exciting parts of our her-  
itage and can be powerful political  
tools as well.

One woman attending the workshop  
announced that LadySmith is a new  
women's publishing company espec-  
ially looking for contributions  
in this area. It can be reached  
at P.O. Box 8879, Minneapolis,  
Minn. 55408.

last year's conference is forth-

Massage Coop for Women Begins

Rosemary O'Connor

A women's massage co-op is now  
forming in the Denver area. It's  
free and open to all interested wo-  
men. No previous experience is re-  
quired, just a desire to be more  
in touch with your own body and  
in how we experience ourselves and  
others through massage. One idea  
behind the co-op is to develop a  
supportive atmosphere in which wo-  
men can give and receive massage.

The structure of the co-op is  
two-fold. First, a workshop is  
held every other Saturday from 11-  
2 p.m. During this time the empha-  
sis will be on learning techniques.  
This will include stroking, knead-  
ing, stretching, pressure points,  
and whatever else people can con-  
tribute and create. Some awareness  
exercises will also be used to col-  
lect our energy and to help us cen-  
ter it.

The second part is “massage cards.”  
These cards will have the name and  
phone number of each woman in the  
co-op on them. Whenever a member  
wants to give or receive a massage,  
she can call anyone on the list to  
see if she is available. When  
a massage is done, a card is given  
to the massager by the massagee,  
thus keeping massages on a give-  
and-take level.

The essence of massage is the a-  
bility to communicate without words.  
The touch is as important a context  
with which is the sense of sight or  
hearing. Hands have the ability to  
break up physical tension, to deal  
with energy blocks and to calm.

The next co-op workshop will be  
on Saturday, Nov. 6 from 11-2. For  
the location call the Woman to Wo-  
man Bookstore at 320-5972.
