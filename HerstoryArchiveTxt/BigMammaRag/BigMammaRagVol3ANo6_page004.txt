Get Your Rights In Writing

Lynette Cazeau

A workshop on Legalities of  
Alternative Lifestyles for  
Women was presented May 30  
in conjunction with a Women’s  
Legal Rights Conference in  
Boulder.

The workshop treated two  
aspects of alternative living:  
nonmarital one-to-one com-  
mitments and communal living.

Ruth Buechler, Denver at-  
torney, discussed legalities of  
living with a lover outside  
marriage. The first maxim is  
practical. Accept from the outset  
that an eventual breakup is, if  
not a certainty, at least a con-  
tingency that should be made  
less traumatic by planning some  
basics. This is not to say that  
alternative commitments break  
up more often than marriage. It's  
just that married people have the  
protection of the system in the  
division of property when the  
breakup occurs. Non-married  
people have to protect  
themselves.

Property

There are two different ways  
you can own property together,  
and the legal terms have impor-  
tant consequences. If property is  
owned “tenancy in common”  
and one owner dies, her legal  
heirs get her interest. On the  
other hand, if owned in “joint  
tenancy” and one party dies, the  
other party owns everything. So  
if you want your lover to inherit  
your share if something should  
happen to you, put it in “joint  
tenancy.” And be persistent.  
Some sales personnel are  
narrow-minded.

Another approach is to form a  
nonprofit corporation or trust  
and buy everything in its name,  
the house, the car, the stereo.

In either approach, it’s quite  
important to be clear between  
yourselves — on paper, if need  
be (and this is a good idea  
because it forces you to think  
things through) — as to who gets  
to take what if (when) you break  
up before one of you dies.

As long as we're talking  
unmentionables like dying or  
breaking up, it’s also a very good  
idea to have a will. If you die

without one, your property  
automatically goes to your legal  
spouse and/or your legal  

children. If you have neither,  
then your blood relatives are  
given your property. So if you  
want your lover to have any of  
your belongings, you must have  
a will.

Now wills can be contested.  
The familiar challenge in  
situations of this sort is for the  
long lost relatives to show up  
after your dear departure and  
claim that your unscrupulous  
lover used undue influence to  
take you for all your money. Or  
they may claim you had given  
them up for dead but would have  
left them the car if you had only  
known they were still alive. If  
either claim is sustained, your  
will won't be enforced. So to be  
sure you get your way, mention  
all blood relatives by name and  
make it perfectly clear you  
haven't forgotten they exist.  
Then give each of them some  
keepsake, explaining why you  
are giving them that and nothing  
else. This will go to demonstrate  
your seriousness and  

thoroughness and help defeat  
any challenges to your state of  
mind when drawing up the will.  
Custody Cases

When children are born into a  
nonmarital relationship, several  
questions arise. Is it any better  
for the father to be acknowledged  
on the birth certificate? If he is

not, the mother has the advan-  
tage of retaining sole control  
over the child. But she is put in a  
difficult position in getting sup-  
port payments from the father.  
Generally, it’s better to  
acknowledge the father and get  
the edge on the child support  
battle, since we still have the  
edge on custody. But if you want  
to have sole control and are  
willing to take financial respon-  
sibility, don’t acknowledge the  
father. By the way, you can give  
the child any last name you  
want.

Recently a Colorado trial court  
ruled that a woman living with a  
man outside marriage would  
have to mend her ways and live a  
“moral life” or give her children  
to her previous husband. The  
Court of Appeals reversed this  

HEW/ Railroads Prison Bill

An important bill in the area of  
prison reform was recently out-  
voted in the Health, Education  
and Welfare Committee of the  
State Senate. HB 1445 would  
have provided for “moving  
women prisoners from Canyon  

City to community-based  
programs where maximum  
security is not deemed  
necessary. Rudy Sanfilippo,  

Director of Corrections, es-  
timates that at least 90 of the  
women in prison could be im-  
mediately released to residential  

work, and educational  
programs. Special psychiatric  
facilities would serve the  

remaining 10 who need secure  
supervision.

About 74 women are present-  
ly incarcerated, primarily for  
property-related, non-violent  
offenses such as forgery and  
embezzlement. Further, most  
criminal homicide offenses are  
situational and will never be  
repeated. Yet women remain  
locked in Canyon City, an  
isolated rural community which  
— like the prison — has no  
meaningful programs designed  
to teach women skills that will  
enable them to maintain  
themselves in the community.  
Women prisoners average 3.5  

children per person, and must  
work to support themselves and  
their family after release. If HB  

1445 had passed, prisoners  

would have been able to main-  
tain family contact and move  
toward economic independence  
if based in their own com-  
munities for rehabilitation pur-  
poses.

Services already exist in  
Denver and metropolitan areas,  
including drug and alcohol  
programs, volunteer support,  
counseling and university  
programs. In addition, residen-  
tial facilities include Walden  
Community Treatment Center in  
Denver, Adult Forensic Service  
in Colorado Springs, and Weld  
Mental Health Center in  
Greeley. Work release centers  
include Camp George West,  
Delta Honor Unit, and others.

Use of these and other com-  
munity services in lieu of im-  
prisonment works! Recent  
statistics reveal a 60-80% return  
rate for those released from  
Colorado prisons, while Adult  
Forensics reports only a 15% rate,  
and South West Mental Health  
reports a 21% rate.

A special bill mandating com-  
munity corrections for women is  
required in this state because  

women prisoners have been  
ignored by corrections and  
public alike. For example,  
despite a much-publicized  
change in policy last January  
admitting women to work  
release programs, only two  
women are participating.

Further, there is no half-way  
house for women offenders.  
Equal protection of the law could  
have been mandated for women  
via HB 1445. Pro-Women  

in reaction to the defeat of HB  
1446 there has been the forma-  
tion of a group of “Colorado  
women interested in equal  
protection of the law for women  
in the criminal justice system.”  
A first meeting was held and  
goals and priorities were set.  
Anyone interested in further  
information should contact Betty  
Marler at 761-7937 or 936-  
8441 x 225.

There will be a more in-depth  
look at this group's workings and  
expectations in the next issue.  
Look for it!

decision, saying the relevant test  
was “the best interest of the  
child” and there was no showing  
that the mother's living situation  
had a bad effect on the children.

This year a judge in Jefferson  
County allowed two women to  
keep their children even though  
they were living together as  
lovers. In cases like this it’s  
important to have legal counsel  
who is prepared to educate the  
judge and demonstrate that the  
children are not being adversely  
affected. Some lesbians are  
afraid for the judge to find out  
their sexual preference during a  
custody hearing for fear they will  
lose everything — even visita-  
tion rights. This is pure paranoia  
and a good intimidation tactic to  
boot. The most that can be lost is  
custody, and with the judge  
leaning toward giving the  
children to their mother and the  
test being the child's best in-  
terest, you pen a very strong  
position in court.

Communes

Communal situations  
generally amplify all the above  
issues relative to nonmarital  
relationships, plus the more  
complex property questions.  
Ronnie Rosenbaum of the  
People’s Clinic of Boulder  
stressed the importance of  
writing down the structure of the  
commune as well as the method  
of financing it and how to pay  
back the ones who put up the  
front money. Another issue is  
what financial arrangements to  
make when individuals leave the  
commune. Often this takes the  
form of writing bylaws for a  
corporation, a bit of a contradi-  
ction because bylaws require (at  
least on paper) a hierarchical  
structure. But a corporate struc-  
ture is a handy one for buying  
property in a group, though  
another method is by forming a  
land trust. Either way, you'll  
have to write it all out, which  
means you'll have to talk it out  
beforehand.

Anyone planning to live com-  
munally should check with local  
zoning officials. Towns have  
residential zones which restrict  

inhabitants to nuclear families.  
But you can usually find areas  
(like much of Capitol Hill) where  
the zoning is for multi-family  
units (apartments) but there are  
still a lot of old houses which,  
until their day of reckoning with  
the bulldozer, are ideal for  
communes and legal too.  
Country Limits

In the country be careful.  
Things aren't as free as they  
used to be. You have to get a  
building permit to change a  
chicken coop into a home for  
people. And there are rules as to  
how many acres per dwelling  
and what sanitation system  
must be installed. So they may  
not give you the permit and  
building or remodeling without a  
permit can bring penalties. As  
with many other things we deal  
with, these laws can be either  
enforced or ignored or even  
exaggerated depending on the  
zoning official. So the best tactic  
is to be aware of the law and not  

be fooled by the individual  
enforcement agent.  
Many more topics were  

covered by the two-day session,  
but it was impossible to report all  
workshops. Boulder County  
Women’s Resource Center and  
Boulder Human Rights Office did  
a fine job organizing the con-  
ference. One question: “Why do  
we need a male keynote  
speaker?”
