“New Federalism”

Under Reagan's "New Feder-
alism" 44 Indian schools will
close - Indian health repre-
sentatives, gone - Indian
housing projects, gone. Rea-
gan himself is supporting a
bill from Strom Thurmond that
would terminate all land
claims by Indian people. The
"New Federalism" breaks treaty
after treaty with Indian peo-
ples. If abrogation is Rea-
gan's answer to solving the
economic problems of the US,
then the response of the In-
dian people is demand for the
restoration of their lands.
The return of all lands ceded
to the US through 389 treat-
ies - shall be one of our
answers.

“Oct 20th” Trial

The trial of the Oct. 20th
freedom fighters began Mon.,
Sept. 20th. They have been
indicted for allegedly parti-
cipating in an attempted ex-
propriation from a Brinks
Armored truck in Nyack, N.Y.
Sekou Odinga, Judy Clark, Ku-
wasi Balagoon and David Gil-
bert have refused to partici-
pate in the trial, taking a
strong non-collaborationist
stand. Solomon Brown and Kathy
Boudin are participating in
the trial based on making it
a political trial. Counts
were dropped against Abdul
Majid and James York, but they
have been charged with murder
and attempted murder in the
shootings of 2 police in '81.

Corporate Pushers

In Third World countries,
public health is often left to
the multinationals that con-
trol the drug markets. In Ban-
gladesh efforts at reform be-
gan last April. At stake in
the drug reform law is a $70
million-a-year market domi-
nated by eight multinationals:
Pfizer and Squibb headquarter-
ed in the U.S., all others in
Western Europe.

Developing countries consume
$30 billion in drugs yearly,
most of which are non-essen-
tial and some of which are dan-
gerous, and some deadly.

Grand Jury Victory

36 residents, friends, and
legal workers for Yellow Thun-
der Camp (a Native American
repossession of their Black
Hills land) were subpoenaed to
testify before a grand jury in
Rapid City, So. Dak., Sept. 16.
All of the witnesses had re-
fused to testify, and on Sept.
16, the day they were to appe-
ar, the Grand Jury subpoenas
were cancelled.

The Grand Jury was ostensi-
bly to investigate the death
of Clarence Tollefson, a white
man who repeatedly came around
armed, dressed in fatigues to
threaten the camp. July 21, ‘82
Tollefson became belligerent
and drew his pistol at men
from the camp--one of whom
blocked his arm--he died with
in minutes of shooting himself.

....and New Attack

Since the State's efforts
to discredit the Camp by use
of the Grand Jury were de-
feated, the State is now try-
ing a new attack. The State
has hired a new pathologist
to reverse the original find-
ings, i.e. that Tollefson
died by his own hand. This is
not a new tactic, it was also
attempted after the death of
Anna Mae Aquash, who died by
a state bought bullet through
the back of the neck.

MLN 5 Indicted

On Sept. 24, five leaders
of the MLN (Movimiento Liber-
acion Nacional), the Puerto
Rican national liberation
group, were indicted for crim-
inal contempt. The charges
for the five (Julio Rosado,
Andres Rosado, Steven Gerra,
Maria Cuento and Ricardo
Romero) come from refusing
a second time to talk to a
grand jury, and carry a pen-
alty of up to five years im-
prisonment.

Bomb God's Gift

Phyllis Schlafly, fresh from
her triumph over the ERA, has
other comforts too. "The atom-
ic bomb," she says, "is a mar-
velous gift that was given to
our country by a wise God."

Up With Azania

The Anti-Springbok Five who
were arrested protesting the
South African Springbok rugby
tour were sentenced in Queens
Criminal Court, NY, July 8th.
Mary Patten received one year,
Tim Blunk and Eve Rosahn each
9 months, and Margo Pelletier
6 months for minor misdemeanor
charges. Donna Borup who faced
the heaviest charges, was not
sentenced because she chose
not to appear for her trial.
In doing so she struck a blow

to the state's plan to get them

all on serious felonies. The
stiff sentences were justified
by FBI info that they were not

properly contrite--were commit-

ted revolutionaries. As the
defendants were removed from
court they raised the chant
"UP WITH AZANIA! DOWN WITH SO.

AFRICA!" and each was given 30

additional days for contempt.

Pill Can Paralyze

Susan Odgers, 23, Michigan,
was paralyzed from the waist
down due to a spinal blood
clot she suffered 4 years ago
while taking oral contracep-
tives. First she won--was
awarded 3.8 million--this was
then nullified by a federal
district court because the
court was misinformed on whe-
ther Ortho-Novum, or any drug
company, has a separate res-

ponsibility to inform the user

as well as the doctor of drug
risks. The case is now in the

Michigan Supreme Court.

On The Right Track

13 women in Mexico City have
won the right to become train
drivers despite opposition
from subway administrators and
psychiatrists. The women per-
severed with a three month
training course to move from
ticket sellers to train drivers
although psychiatrists origin-
ally told the transit system
that the women would faint at
the first problem!

Psych Horror

A former college professor
who bludgeoned his wife to
death has been sentenced to
tutor prisoners in psychology
for 22 months, in lieu of
serving a jail term. This sen-
tence was pronounced by County
Circuit Judge Gene Martin in
the case of Ron Karraker, the
former Chair of the education-
al psychology dept., at the
Univ. of Mo. at Kansas City.
The sentence was reached after
the defense attorney convinced
the prosecutor that Karraker
would plead insanity if he
was charged with more than
manslaughter.
