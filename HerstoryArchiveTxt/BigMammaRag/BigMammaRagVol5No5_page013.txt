BETWEEN OURSELVES  
Audre Lorde  
Reyer Eidolon, Editions 1976  

Jantha Johnson  

Ms. Lorde's ability to see under-  
neath the surface of situations,  
strange places, obscure faces and -  
endless dry conversations has gifted  
her with her book of people and poems.  
Or perhaps it could more appropri-  
ately be called a book of poems about  
children. This writer/woman dis-  
cusses, flashes on her existence as  
a mother, a daughter, and a sister.  

She further creates with her abil-  
ity to visualize her skull into the  
reader's skull. Thus space and mo-  
bility are visualized by words like  
"pump," "holocaust," and "untaught."  
For some reason, when she writes them  
on paper they begin to form a struc-  
ture and not in a non-sensical man-  
ner. She complements her words as  
she uses them to entice, attract and  
convey her message.  

"Scars," "Outside," and "Power" are  
bitter, painful, and nostalgic. She  
understands all the forms of hate in  
the human anatomy in her piece enti-  
tled "Power." Although she relates  
to love, she also is attuned to un-  
selfishness, aid, and humility. Read  
her piece entitled "Solstice."  

Her manner of titling her poems is

Hidden Faces is an exhibit of pho-  
tographs and quotes of early Colorado  
women that is being displayed around  
Colorado this summer. On May 28-31,  
it was showing at Mammouth Gardens.  

Starting at the beginning, the dis-  
play goes from the Anasazi women  
through to the suffragist movement  
and ends around 1920. The photo-  
graphs and quotes are from all ages,  
classes, and races of women. While  
physically the display is a letdown,  
composed of 4' by 8' walls set at  
angles with large photographs and  
text next to them, it is compelling.  
You'll find yourself or a friend in  
at least one of the photographs. My  

(favorites were the pole vault at a  

far stronger than her title cover.  

Reading her book made me reflect to  
myself that I am glad that I am now  
on the “outside” and I kept thinking  
how often had I been on the outside.  

Her ending poem "A Woman/Dirge For  
Wanted Children" is very angry,  
direct, emotional yet non-emotional;  
you're able (if you really "read" the  
book) to visualize yourself "seeing"  
the blood flow from your thighs onto  
the cold floor. Heavy poem. Quiet  
book. Her senses aren't as high as  
some authors but her ability to per-  
ceive, read body and facial expres-  
sions/language are conveyed very  
nicely to her readers.  

This woman/writer has an accurate  
memory storehouse and vivid imagin-  
ation that focus in her sense of  
"seeing" and "listening." Her poems  
move, and they carry much color.  
Read also her piece entitled "Our-  
selves." Read her book in the park.  
If you have children have them around  
to visualize with her poems. Have a  
cold glass of rose hip tea and take  
her skull for awhile. She's vivid  
and is she good.

high school track meet--Delta 1915  
and the operetta play from around  
1890--take a good look at “Queen  
Ester" in the middle.  

These excerpts from diaries and  
letters are full of the irony and  
hardship of women's lives; they also  
reveal their strength and persever-  
ance. Hidden Faces will be in Boul-  
der June 3-5, and from there go on  
to Leadville, Glenwood Springs, and  
elsewhere.  

The women who are compiling the  
information for the Hidden Faces pro-  
ject are gathering it from journals,  
diaries, letters, census records and  
oral histories. They are being fun-  
ded in part with a grant from the  
National Endowment for the Humanities.  
The exhibit is free of charge. For

GREASY THUMB AUTOMECHANICS MANUAL FOR  
WOMEN

Iowa City Women's Press

The Greasy Thumb isn't a manual for  
a woman who wants to learn automechan-  
ics as a trade, but rather it is for  
the woman who wants to learn something  
about how her car works, how to main-  
tain it, and how to fix at least some  
of the things that might go wrong  
with it.  

Clearly written and illustrated and  
with a glossy, relatively cleanable  
cover, this book will greatly help any  
woman who wants to know how to fix her  
car. Written primarily for older Amer-  
ican cars, this manual covers tools,  
how to use them and where to buy them,  
with illustrations so that you can  
see what an allen wrench and an off-  
set screwdriver look like before you  
go to buy them.  

After reading and doing everything  
in this book, your car will be tuned,  
lubricated, and winterized. Its front  
bearings repacked, tires rotated, and  
brakes either rebuilt or replaced.  
You'll know how to put on shocks, fix  

the exhaust system, replace the univer-  

sal joint, and repair the clutch.  

You can do it! Even if you have  
no desire to learn how to do all these  
repairs, after reading this book you

will know enough to keep from getting  
burned by the boys who own the garages  
and gas stations. That, in itself,  
should be motivation enough to buy  
this book.  

Musicians Form New Band  

Tea Schook  

A new music collective is in the  
process of forming in Denver. Called  
“The Feminist Accordion Collective"  
(FAC), its members hope to grow and  
become a full-fledged accordion band.  
As one collective member put it, "We  
decided that Frankie Yankovic had  
been the leader in the area for too  
long. We wanted to play music that  
had a woman's waltz to it. No more  
Beer Barrel Polkas for us."  

The collective at present numbers  
six, half as many as are needed to  
form the accordion band of their  
plans. Members are, however, optim-  
istic about attracting the final  
needed six players. They grew to  
their present size through word-of-  
mouth only. They feel that they  
have now progressed to the point  
where they can advertise their exis-  
tence. Says founding collective mem-  
ber Sally Ann Kovalewski, “We were a  
little afraid at the beginning. Most  
of us were closet accordionists,  
playing polkas at night when no one  
was around. I myself used to hide  
my music stand whenever my feminist  
sisters would visit."  

The group first formed as the re-  
sult of a conversation between mem-  
bers of a bowling team. A C-R group  
was formed, with members meeting on  
Thursdays after the alleys closed.  
"We thought about calling ourselves  
‘accordionists anonymous,' but those  
letters were already taken," said  
Kovalewski. Now, with the support  
gained from their bellows-sisterhood,  
they are actively recruiting members  
for their prospective recitals.  

Meetings are opened with bass hand  
scale warm-ups and a chorus of “Lady  
of Spain." Then the collective takes  
care of business. The rest of the  
meeting is used for practice. "Some  
of us haven't played since we became  
feminists," says collective member  
Amalia Kowalski, “our reeds were get-  
ting dry and cracking." These prac-  
tices are also important to the  
group's collective process; “The col-  
lective that plays together, makes  
beautiful music together," said mem-  
ber Bettina Boniewiczki.  

The collective has eventual plans  
for making money by playing at local  
weddings and coffeehouses. They have  
already approached some of the more  
prominent places in town. "The Folk-  
lore Center was booked for the next  
six months when we called, and Cafe  
Nepenthes offered us some marinated  
artichokes when we called them," said  
Kovalewski.  

While working on their hand attack  
technique, members also discuss their  
politics and goals as feminist accor-  
dionists. A recent heated discussion  
centered around “feminist art." The  
outcome of this discussion was that  
members decided that the very act of  
calling themselves feminist accordion-  
ists in a male-dominated arena made  
their schottisches revolutionary.  
"It's because of the personal being  
political and all, you know?" said  

member Kovalewski, “Just the fact that  
we want to play our polkas for women  
only is an extremely political thing,  
because of the personal is political.  
It's too bad we weren't together for  
those weddings in Boulder. That would  
have been a real thing where we could  
have shown where our politics are at,  
playing at a gay marriage."  

To raise funds in the meantime, the  
collective is tentatively planning a  
women's dance for sometime next month  
with the collective providing live  
music. They are presently negotiating  
for use of the VFW hall in Wheatridge.  
The dance, however, is still shaky.  
"Some of us are still afraid that our  
sisters in the movement are not going  
to accept our feminist vision," said  
Kowalski.  

For further information about the  
collective's future plans, or to find  
out about joining the collective,  
call 322-2010. Members are also look-  
ing for another person to join their  
bowling team, so if you are interested  
give them a call.
