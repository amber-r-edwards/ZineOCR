Saga of Suffrage and Religion

Glenna Booth

Like most of Elizabeth Cady
Stanton’s other reform projects,
the Woman's Bible was decades
ahead of its time. When the first
volume was published in 1895,
the fight for woman suffrage had
become a respectable one, no
longer fought by rebel fringes.

Elizabeth Cady Stanton had
been one of the first and most
radical founders of the move-
ment for female equality. It was
she who insisted on the first in-
sertion of woman’s right to the
ballot in the ‘Declaration of Sen-
timents’ at the Seneca Falls
Convention in 1848. At that
time, even the enlightened
Lucretia Mott reacted to the
proposition of franchise with,
“Thou wilt make us ridiculous.
We must go slowly.”

By 1886, when Stanton began
work on the Woman's Bible, she
had resigned herself to her
minority thinking. The ballot had
been only a small step in her
long list of reforms, and she was
moving on.

In the mid-nineteenth cen-

“If you fail to teach
women a broad
catholic spirit, I would
not give much for them
after they are en-
franchised . . . You had
better organize one
woman on a broad plat-
form than 10,000 on a

narrow platform of in-

tolerance and bigotry.”

tury, most people believed in the
“plenary inspiration” of the Bi-
ble. It was considered an infalli-
ble guide not only to moral and

religious matters, but also the
ultimate answer in science,
history, and geography.

The Bible played a large part in
the ideological question of
slavery, with each side citing
passages for and against.

The question of suffrage was
also being debated on Biblical
terms, but the suffragists found
themselves outnumbered in
“anti” passages. There seemed
to be three solutions with which
they could combat the Bible
quoters: they could meet them
head-on in arguments; they
could quote the scriptures which
seemed to favor equality; they
could ignore the religious
arguments. All three were used.

Liberal Theology

Suffragists were helped along
in their battle against a divinely
ordained “woman's sphere” by
an increasingly liberal theology
in the 1880s and 1890s. New
theology texts and publications
began to appear, and the heresy
trials of ministers began to be
covered in the press. Revised
editions of the Bible appeared in
1881 and 1885, which under-
mined the absolute infallibility of
the wording of the Bible, and the
new theories of evolution helped
to weaken the hold of literalism.
These changes did not affect
everyone, but they opened the
door a crack.

The Woman's Bible blew the
door off its hinges. Elizabeth
Cady Stanton had come to the
conclusion that it was not dis-
enfranchisement which was im-
peding the equality of women,
but the Bible and the churches.
She felt that if it could be proven
that the subjugation of women
was not divinely ordained, then
men would be more willing to
grant women a place in govern-

ment and society.

It cannot be said that she
received much encouragement
on her project. Even her best

friend and long-time
collaborator, Susan B. Anthony
wrote to her: “No — I don’t want

my name on that Bible Com-
mittee — You fight that battle —
leave me to fight the secular —
the political fellows .. . I simply
don't want the enemy to be
diverted from my practical ballot
fight — to that of scoring me for
belief one way or the other about
the Bible.”

Despite the objections of
Susan B. Anthony, Stanton
began the Woman's Bible in

1886, with the support of Clara
Bewick Colby, who published
segments in her Woman's
Tribune and supported it in her
editorials.

The book was authored by a
“Revising Committee.” Stanton
had hoped to have Greek and
Hebrew scholars comment on
the original texts and to have
Biblical savants place passages
in history. Although she wrote to
many women, most replies were
that one should not tamper with
the Bible. The “Revising Com-
mittee” for Part One eventually
consisted of 23 women, three of
whom were ordained ministers.

Two Interpretations

The purpose of the Woman's
Bible was not to rewrite the
book, but to comment only on
those passages which referred
to women or obviously excluded
them. There were two main
types of commentaries: those
which proved the Bible was in-
deed the enemy of women’s
equality, and those which were
reinterpreted to show that the
Bible really portrayed women as
the equal of men. Stanton wrote
both types of commentaries,
because she believed that, like
any other book, the Bible con-
tained both good and bad.

The Woman's Bible was
written in two volumes. Part I,
published in 1895, covered the
Pentateuch. It consisted of brief
commentary on those verses
singled out for attention. The se-
cond volume, published in 1898,
followed the same format, but
dealt with both Testaments,
Joshua to Revelations. Part II
had a different revising com-
mittee of 25 members, also in-
cluding three ordained ministers
and some foreign dignitaries.

An example from the
Woman's Bible will help us un-
derstand the torrent of abuse
which was heaped upon it in
1896. One passage interpreted
is Genesis 1:26-28.

“So God created man in his

We have been beset at
every step with the cry
that somebody was in-
juring the cause.

own image, in the image of God
he created him; male and female
he created them. And God bless-
ed them, and God said to them,
“Be fruitful and multiply, and fill
the earth and subdue it; and
have dominion over the fish of
the sea and over the birds of the
air and over every living thing
that moves upon the earth.” 
(RSV)

Elizabeth commented on this
passage in the following
manner.

“The first step in the elevation
of woman to her true position, as
an equal factor in human
progress, is the cultivation of the

religious sentiment in regard to
her dignity and equality, the
of an ideal
Heavenly Mother, to whom their
prayers should be addressed, as
well as to the Father. If the
language has any meaning, we
have in these texts a plain
declaration of the existence of
the feminine element in the
Godhead, equal in power and
glory with the masculine. The

There were two main
types of commen-
taries: those which
proved the Bible was
indeed the enemy of
women’s equality, and
those which were
reinterpreted to show
that the Bible really
portrayed women as
the equal of men.

Heavenly Mother and Father!
‘God created man in his own im-
age, male and female.’ Thus

‘Scripture, as well as science and

philosophy, declares the eternity
and equality of sex.”
Our Heavenly Mother?

Ideas such as a Heavenly
Mother would be heavily dis-
puted today, so one can imagine
their impact in the 1890s. Even
Elizabeth Cady Stanton was not
quite prepared for the degree of
denunciation which Part I of the
Woman's Bible received. For the
public was familiar with
criticism of the Bible, but had not
really accepted it as totally valid.
The “Revising Committee” was
condemned not only for what it
wrote on the Bible, but also for
the fact that women had dared to
write anything on the Bible at all.

In her usual spirit, Stanton
wrote the following reaction to
the abuse her Bible had received.
“The criticisms on the Woman's
Bible are as varied as they are
unreasonable... One clergyman
says: ‘It is the work of women
and the devil.’ This is a grave
mistake. His Satanic Majesty
was not invited to join the Revis-
ing Committee, which consists
of women alone. Moreover, he
has been so busy of late years
attending Synods, General
Assemblies and Conferences, to
prevent the recognition of
women delegates, that he has
had no time to study the
languages and ‘higher
criticisms.’ “

Stanton weathered abuse and
denunciations from the clergy
and society in general with little
concern. There was one group,
however, whose haste at
repudiating the book was a low
blow. The 81-year-old Stanton
was still an honorary president
of the National American
Woman Suffrage Association.

The NAWSA, now filled with
respectable young women,
feared that their cause could not
bear any connection to this
heresy. At the NAWSA conven-
tion in 1896, they passed by a
vote of 53 to 41 the “Bible
Resolution.” It stated, ‘That this
Association is non-sectarian,
and that it has no official con-
nection with the so-called
‘Woman's Bible’, or any
theological publication.”

Relinquishing her chair as
president of the Association,
Susan B. Anthony argued elo-
quently against the repudiation
of a privately published work by
their honorary president:

“Born Heretic”
“From the beginning the dis-

tinct feature of our association
has been the right of individual
opinion for every member. We
have been beset at every step
with the cry that somebody was
injuring the cause. You have
never repudiated me and I was
born a heretic... When this plat-
form is too narrow for people of
all creeds to stand on, I shall not
be on it... If you fail to teach
women a broad catholic spirit, I
would not give much for them
after they are enfranchised . .
You had better organize one
woman on a broad platform than
10,000 on a narrow platform of
intolerance and bigotry.”

Four years later, Susan B.
Anthony resigned from the
presidency of the NAWSA, and
the organization passed fully
into another era of leadership
and membership. The Woman's
Bible has a significant place in
the history of American women;
not only as a bold voice to
whispered ideas, but also as one
of the highlights of the first wave
of the equal rights movement.

When woman suffrage was a
radical cause, the women
fighting for it were radical
women — those who were will-
ing to brave public censure for
ideas they thought true. A mind
questioning the tenets of the
basic laws of the country could
easily move on to questioning
the basic tenets of religion.

As suffrage became an accep-
table cause, women could
become suffragists who were
conventional in every other
manner, bringing a middle-of-
the-road approach to suffrage,
and ushering in a new wave to
struggle for equality in a
different manner. The move-
ment had changed from an
idealistic one envisioning
equality, to a movement bent on

transferring the ideals into
realities — the first reality being
the vote. The Woman's Bible
landmarked the move from the
visionary to the purely practical.
