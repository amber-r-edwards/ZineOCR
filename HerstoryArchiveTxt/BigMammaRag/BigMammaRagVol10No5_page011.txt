“The Color Of Jails, Cells, Bars, Fences,

At the beginning
my doctor told me to make

some friends on the

ward.
I watched Terri bent over her dinner
tray. Her doctor was sitting at the ta-

ble next to her, begging her to eat. He

waved a spoonful of soggy vegetables

in her face. Her jaw held

tight. Her mouth did not
move. Terri did seem

like flames

under the pink,

he wore every now. Her hair
eyes were dark, like the moon when it
hides in the shadow of the earth. Her
face and arms were too white. I wondered
if the fire had stolen her color. I
knew something, someone before the fire
had been the thief.

Later that evening I hesitated into
Terri's room. She was sitting on her
bed with two pillows hugging her back.

I stepped into her distance, paused for
a minute, then told her my name and that
I was afraid of the doctors, too. Carefully she got out of bed, picked up my
limp arms and told me to hold her hands.
When I did, she said: no, hold tighter.
My grip drew strength from her plea. She
went on to explain that her hands slapped
when she tried to talk. We spoke about being scared and not being able to
talk. And she never hit me.

By the end of the week my doctor told
me to stay away from Terri because she
was talking to me, not to her doctor.

I didn't understand what I had done
wrong, not then. I withdrew, again.
Terri withdrew, again.

A hurried crew of white-suited men
wheeled Annie down the long corridor
of the ward. The entrance door slam-
clicked after them. Annie was tied to
the cart. As they passed me, I watched
her head roll from side to side. Her
swollen eyes tried to focus, to under-
stand something, anything. They rushed
her into a room next to the nurses’
station and shut the door.

A few days later the doctors took
twelve-year-old Terri into Annie's room.
I saw them push her close to the bed,
close to Annie's congested, strained
breathing. A doctor on each side held
Terri's arms. They said Annie had start-
ed trying to kill herself when she was
Terri's age. That was fourteen years
ago. Now at twenty-six her skin was a
mass of scars from so many years of
cutting and burning. Broken bones meshed
back together in lumps after she had
thrown herself out of beds and rocked
the chairs she had been tied to until
she crashed on the floor. The doctors
told Terri that the reason Annie was in
the hospital this time was because they
had to do a lobotomy on her. They had
to dig into her brain to cut out the

violence because Annie wouldn't stop it herself. They told Terri that if she
didn't stop trying to kill herself and
start talking to them, like Annie,
she'd end up just like Annie.

After witnessing this, I found myself again, lying on the
linoleum floor under my bed, crying.

Cages, Our Own Souls After A Time...’

Elsie wore flower-print dresses, a
sweater and oxford shoes with anklets.
The dresses and sweaters were state
clothes, donated from people on the
outside. These clothes came when people
got tired of wearing them or when the
current style changed. Sometimes a box
of new clothes arrived after a relative
died. Elsie's shoes were her own. They
looked older than they were, just like
she looked older than her forty years.
The leather on her shoes cracked. Dust from the ward floors and
dirt from occasional walks on the ground
filled the pattern of crevasses in her
shoes. Eleven years of medications puffed
out her skin. Her aging released
and hung the flesh in loose folds. Her
shoes were curled up on the ends, mostly
because they got worn a lot. Her blad-
der too weak and tired let go more often
than not.

Upper back, shoulders, neck, and head
all hunched over the wide-base broom
that Elsie silently pushed around the
dayroom. Her nose was stuffed up so bad
she had to breathe through her mouth.
Drool spilled out as she swept. Sometimes she cried when she did this self-
appointed ward duty.

There were three rocking chairs in the
dayroom. Elsie's favorite was the big
"grandfather" rocker. Every few weeks
she rocked herself into a roaring out-
rage. Her eyes big with tears rushing
down her cheeks. The spit of her furor
soon became a drool and she rocked her-
self back into a lowing defeat.

I never found out what the source of
her deep sadness was or the details of
her rage. What was clear is that Elsie
was a woman who used to be. A woman
who was somebody, before her psychosur-
gery.

Written For Kim F.

Kim and I did time together

when we were young and wild

we learned the pain of surviving
without the pleasures of being a child

Many times we swallowed the Reds
While Neil Young sang us the blues
In our muddled drugged out minds

We felt we had nothing better to lose

One night while driving in the car
Kim fell asleep at the wheel

There was the sound of metal and glass
And then the night was still

Together we faced the emptiness
of the years that passed us by
Together we learned to fight to live
Yet alone, Kim learned to die

did you hear us cheering,

pleading you on

as the pigs converged.

secretly jealous of the courage and heart
we longed to act on.

you must have known

you carried the hopes and dreams

of us all tonight

as you scaled the wire mountain
laughing in their faces to the end.

Letter To Haydee

I know it's been awhile, and I

The Longing

Tonight the ache of loneliness
Of dreams that quietly die

Of yesterdays that fill my mind
And tears that flood my eyes
If you could only see me right
each bar within

the night the ache

for freedom too

A Question of Rehabilitation
Versus A Sense Of Loss

It was about endless days
filled with despair
Inside a prison
where nobody cared
It was over 2 years
of hard Southern hell
I lost my identity
in a dark lonely cell
Black as night
during the day
with no human contact
or glimpse of a face
it was guards and cons
no middle of the road
at 18 years
I became weary and old
it was hounds baying
in the hot Southern night
it was the scream of my friend
who got caught in mid-flight
it was the sirens wailing
the sound of the guns
The beat of my heart
to the cries of someone
And then finding out
that someone was me
who had somehow forgotten
what it meant to be free

haven't floated off

into the abyss. You are often in my thoughts. The words

and thoughts churn inside but do not flow freely onto paper.
But I couldn't let this day go by without noting your

anniversary.

So I send you this bouquet of Edelweiss
hardy, wild mountain flowers

that struggle through the rocks and ice
to bloom

atop mountains where nothing else survives.

I know we are of the same stock,
germinating our seeds

in spite of starvation

and blooming in the midst of barrenness.

our harvest will be freedom.
and I love you.
