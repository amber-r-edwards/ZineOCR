Canadian Wimmin’s

Bobbe Ross

We, the Wimmin's Fire Bri-
gade, claim responsibility for
the fire-bombing of three Red
Hot Video outlets in the Low-
er Mainland of B.C. on Novem-
ber 22, 1982. This action is

self-defense

another step towards the de-
struction of a business that
promotes and profits from vi-
olence against wimmin and
children.

Red Hot Video sells tapes
that show wimmin and children
being tortured, raped and hu-
miliated. We are not the prop-
erty of men to be used and
abused.

Red Hot Video is part of a
multi-billion dollar porno-
graphy industry that teaches
men to equate sexuality with
violence. Although these tapes
violate the Criminal Code of
Canada and the B.C. guide-
lines on pornography, all law-
ful attempts to shut down Red
Hot Video have failed because
the justice system was cre-
ated and is controlled by
rich men to protect their
profits and property.

As a result, we are left no
viable alternative but to

change the situation ourselves
through illegal means. This
is an act of self-defense
against hate propaganda. We
will continue to defend our-
selves!

In November, three Vancouv-
er, British Columbia video
tape porn stores of the chain
Red Hot Video were fire-bomb-
ed. The chain had been hit
once before in October. In
the November attack one store
was damaged, one destroyed
along with two other stores
in the same complex, and the
police removed incendiary
bombs in a third store before
they went off.

The Wimmin's Fire Brigade
has taken responsibility for
the three November attacks.
For their statement see above.

The Red Hot Video chain
opened in February, 1982 and
now has 13 stores in B.C. and
is planning to open 5 more.
Since their appearance in
different cities in B.C.,
women's groups have objected
to them. In October, 1982 an
"underground" newspaper (not
identified) announced the
first attempt of an unsuc-
cessful fire bombing. Since
then the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police (their FBI)
has promised an "investiga-
tion which will involve close

Brigade Takes

scrutiny of all the provinces
underground activists" and
they say "the net has now
been widened considerably".
Women's liberation groups
that form the B.C. Federation
of Women have taken a firm
stand of support of the Fire
Brigade, with only a few in
opposition to their methods.

"While we did not partici-
pate in the fire bombings of
November 22 in the Lower Main-
land, we are in agreement with
the frustration and anger of
the women who did.

We noted and appreciated
their efforts to see that no
one got hurt.

Thirty-six women's liberat-
ion groups of the B.C. Feder-
ation of Women have made a
decision to close Red Hot
Video outlets this year.

We insist that (B.C. Attor-
ney General) Allan Williams
take action immediately to
prevent rich men profiting
from Red Hot Video's hate
literature about women and
children.

The women of B.C. are being
driven to desperate acts. The

Canadian and B.C. governments
have failed to use the exist-
ing laws to defend more than
half the population from the
horrors of the pornography

industry.
"Pornography is the theory--
rape is the practice."

I fully support groups that
take action as the Fire Brig-
ade has done. If we wait for
the law and enforcers of law
to protect us, we'll be wait-
ing a hell of a long time.

But I can't accept “porn is
the theory--rape is the prac-
tice". That just doesn't say
enough to me, it's too simpl-
istic. To me the theory is
that the racist patriarchal/
imperialistic system we live
under profits from all of us
and in order for the system
to profit it must subject us
to whatever practices it can
get away with. Canada is no
different from the US except
that the US is more influen-
tial, more oppressively imper-
ialist.

If that system can convince
men that women aren't humans
we will be treated as objects
and property, if whites are
convinced that we are super-
ior then we will have racism,
if the middle class is convinced
that the working class is lower
we will have classism, if
Christians are convinced that
Jews and Arabs are evil then
we will have anti-semitism.
And the system sure as hell
has convinced a lot of people

Sex Tourism

(Reprinted from Girl's Own)

Bill Horne, the most pro-
lific pornographer in Austra-
lia, is about to begin con-
ducting organised tours of
Philippines brothels for Aus-
tralian men. The "tour guides"
will be men already living in
Manila.

Tour destination Angelo City
is notorious for the extent
to which impoverished, and se-
xually drug-addicted girls and
women are marketed as sex-ob-
jects for male tourists.

The tour will be conducted

Page 14+ Big'Mania Rag, January, 1983

Of Australia

by arrangement with Castro
International, one of Sydney's
leading travel agencies.
Horne's publications, ribald
and Bawdy in particular, are
filled with pages of advert-
isements for local brothels
and otherwise depend on the
unpaid exploitation of women's
bodies.

Most of the photographs used
are lifted directly from over-
seas porn, such as Larry Fly-
nt's Hustler magazine and ot-
her more European sources.

Horne virtually never pays
the women appearing in his
publications. He is a self-con-

fessed racist and actually re-
fuses to have blacks or Asians
in his presence, though many
advertisements appearing in
his publications stress the
racial origins of the women
for sale. All of this informa-
tion was sent to various stra-
ight papers (i.e.: The Sun).
None of them have made any
comment. Women being exploited
is obviously not "news."

What Bill Horne is doing is
a logical extension of porno-
graphy, in which women are
beaten, raped, maimed and
killed in a male search for
pleasure. As Australian women

Women

are not always desperate enou-
gh to oblige, nor "exotic",
Filipino women will be exploi-
ted instead.

Angelo City is a satellite of
Manila, existing mainly be-
cause the ruling Marcos family
don't want obvious prostitu-
tion in the capital. Now be-
coming a tourist attraction,
with prostitution its major
industry, Angelo City is a di-
rect result of effective lega-
lisation of prostitution, the
huge number of desperately
poor people and an anti-union
government that considers big
business/profit first...

Zap Action Against Porn Tape Dealers

One of the
fear

for a long time
best convincers is fear:
of rape, fear of the KKK,
fear of the Nazis, fear of
our jobs, of unions, of union
busting, fear of our exist-
ence.

Porn is profitable, not
only in money but how it ex-
ploits us, from the level of
the women who need the money
and participate in it to the
pushing of white male fantas-
ies of controlling women and
men.

Racism is pushed in porn-
the Black man as stud, lurk-
ing on the streets to pounce
on white women, the Black wo-
man as hot and eager, ever
ready to service white men.
The reality is that Black men
have been tagged as stud be-
cause back in slavery that
was one of their purposes that
the white man insisted they
performed. And the white man
sold the Black men and women's
children as if they were cat-

tle. Black men had no history
of raping white women. But

white men have a long history
of raping Black women, from
days of slavery when women
were their property to current
times when white men still
feel that all Black women are
their property.

The anti-semitism that porn
pushes is the Nazi uniformed
men and women using Jewish
women as the captive victim
and brutally using them for
male sexual fantasies.

Porn furthers the myths and
fantasies of white males, all
the horrors that are "play"
have been, are being acted
out in real life.

The laws of our lands give
out double messages: censor-
ship is bad and everyone
should be able to speak out.
The enforcers go after polit-
ical activists with grand
juries and look the other way
when women are used as objec-
ts to brutalize, whether in

porn, rape, battering, in the
workplace or in the unemploy-
ment line. The real message
comes across, fear controls-- 
if daily more fear is fed to
the people, more will conform
to the dictates of the white
supremacist patriarchal im-
perialistic system and the
quieter we get the easier it
is for that system to advance.
I support the Wimmin's Fire
Brigade actions. I hope that
the women continue to do
actions and that other women
will get the courage to fol-
low but we as a movement must
stop thinking in terms of
single issues, the connect-
ions of oppressions are there
walking and breathing in our
daily lives. As important as
sexism is, it isn't the only
issue that we must address.

The white women who are
objecting to the video tapes,
Custer's Revenge in this
country have hooked up with

the sexism of a white man
trying to get to an Indian wo-
man to rape her. Indian women
speak of the racism of the
game. I think the white women
placed their emphasis on sex-
ism because it was easier and
more comfortable to object to
and they wouldn't go out on a
limb to combat the racism of
this country.

As white women we must
recognize how our white pri-
vilege oppresses others and
how we profit from white
supremacy. We have the priv-
ilege to politicize on only
one level and further all the
myths because then we are not
threatening to the system but
once we make the connections
we do become threatening. And
as we make more connections
we will be able to be respec-
ted and join others in our
mutual fight.

Attempt To

Families and Relatives of
Political Prisoners in West
Germany

Helga Roos, a prisoner from
the Anti-imperialist Movement,
has been imprisoned for one
year pending investigation.

locked up

She was arrested on Oct.
1981 in her apartment in
Frankfurt/Main. The publicity,
through the Federal prosecu-
tor and media, presented
Helga Roos as the first arr-
est in the Kroesen case.
(Three members of the Red
Army Faction, RAF - an armed
underground revolutionary
organization existing in West
Germany since the late '60s,
attempted to assassinate NATO
General Kroesen in Sept. '81.)
In a letter on Oct. 4, 1982,
Helga Roos informed her law-
yer that the Sentencing Board
of the State Supreme Court in
Stuttgart had ordered a psych-
iatric examination for her.
This examination would be
carried out by the Govern-
mental Medical Director En-
gell, Socialtherapeutic In-
stitution, Ludwigsburg.

Ever since there has been
a resistance movement, there
have been attempts to insti-
tutionalize political prison-
ers in psychiatric hospitals
and to define as insane their

resistance, their identity,
and the goals for which they
are fighting.
Such an attempt was made
against Ulrike Meinhof in
1973 and against Siegfried
Haag in 1975. The methods
used by the courts are varied, but the threat of
psychiatric institutionaliza-
tion being the back-up means
of controlling political pri-
soners.
The goal is identical; isolated
prisoners would be targeted
to delineate resistance and
struggle against the system
as crazy and sick. Prosecutor
Geis clearly and plainly
stated this in the proceed-
ings against Meinhof: "It
would be so embarrassing if
it turned out that all the
people began to follow a
mad woman."

The federal prosecution was
unable to carry out their
attempt to institutionalize
Meinhof and Haag because their
goal was publicized and na-
tional and international
pressure and resistance de-
veloped. Likewise, this pro-
ject against Helga Roos must
be stopped.

The trial will begin in the
middle of January. Helga Roos
is charged with supporting
and helping in the prepara-
tion of the Gudrun Ensslin
Kommando action against NATO
General Kroesen.

Since her imprisonment,
Helga Roos (like most of the
political prisoners in West
Germany) has been in total
isolation. She is allowed one
half hour visit from her sis-
ter per month. Otherwise she
has contact only with the
guard who brings her food.
She is allowed to write ten
letters (two pages each) per
month. All of her mail is
censored and her reading ma-
terial is restricted.
