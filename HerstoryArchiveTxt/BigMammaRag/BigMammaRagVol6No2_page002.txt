Deportation: Double Injustice to Women

Support Grows for ‘Gerry 4’ Defendants

By Peg Hickox, Phyllis Kadison and  
Vicki Piotter

The current immigration laws in  
the US prohibit immigrants from Latin,  
Asian, and African countries from  
coming to work or live here in large  
numbers. This is in spite of the  
fact that US corporate interests  
abroad have impoverished many of  
these countries to the point that  
people are forced to leave their own  
land to find work. Many of these  
people, particularly from Mexico, are  
now working and living in the US.

Since they are unable to get offi-  
cial permits to work here, they are  
called undocumented workers. Tech-  
nically, the government considers  
them “illegal aliens."

In Denver, the case of the ‘Gerry  
4’ not only has important implications  
for the general plight of undocumented  
people, but points out special situa-  
tions confronting the undocumented  
woman worker.

The case began in March, 1977, when  
agents of the Immigration and Natura-  
lization Service (INS or La Migra),  
raided the Gerry garment factory in  
North Denver. They arrested four  
Mejicanas. The four women workers  
were jailed for being in the US with-  
out papers.

Each of the women had been living  
in Denver for at least two years, and  
two of them had been here four years.  
One woman is the sole support of her  
family; the others share support with  
husbands. One woman was pregnant at  
the time of the arrest, while all of  
the others have children.

Below is an interview with Sally  
Miranda, a coworker of the four, and  
a member of the Gerry Defense Coali-  
tion. The coalition was formed short-  
ly after the arrest to help free the  
women and to bring attention to the  
injustices of deportation and US immi-  
gration policy. We talked to Sally  
about the Gerry case and the problems  
of undocumented workers.

BMR: Sally, why are the Gerry women  
on trial for deportation?

SALLY: On March 7 last year, INS  
agents came into Gerry and told the  
personnel manager they had a report  
that there were some undocumented  
workers at Gerry. A number of women  
were then called into the cafeteria  
and were asked if they had their doc-  
uments.

It resulted in four women being  
taken to Migra and ordered to leave  
the country within two weeks. These  
women decided to stay and fight. With  
the help of lawyers we knew, we start-  
ed a campaign in the shop and also in  
the communities, talking about the  
women and their case, and talking  
about deportations. The women had de-  
cided themselves to take this struggle  
up.

BMR: What happened to the women after  
they were detained?

SALLY: From what we understand, the  
women were never informed of their  
rights. This happens to many, many  
undocumented workers who are picked  
up by La Migra; they are never in-  
formed of their rights, they are  
taken to Migra, to the county jail  
and back to Mexico.

BMR: What made the women decide to  
stay on and fight the case?

SALLY: It was a combination of quite  
a few things. I think that their  
families are one of the primary rea-  
sons. Most of the women had families  
here; some of the women had been here  
a number of years, and I think that  
they were able to see the support  
that was rallied for them.

BMR: The women's co-workers supported  
them right along, but what about the  
employer at Gerry?

SALLY: When we confronted the presi-  
dent of Gerry, demanding that the  
women get their jobs back, he refused.  
The four women went in there with 35  
of their supporters, and we said we  
were not going to leave until the  
women got their jobs back. In a mat-  
ter of 15 minutes, they decided the  
women would be allowed to stay on the  
job.

BMR: What do you mean by, "the women  
and their supporters went in there?"

SALLY: Well, about a day or two after  
La Migra picked them up, there was  
a small demonstration at the INS of-  
fices. Two of the women were released  
on their personal recognizance, which  
is something that hasn’t happened in  
Denver for a long, long time. All of  
the women were out within a couple  
of days, and we had another demon-  
stration in front of the Gerry plant  
to expose the deportations.

While we were out there, we asked  
the women what should we do -- Should  
we just have a demonstration, or  
should we go inside? They said, "Yes,  
let's go inside; we want to demand  
our jobs back." So we all went in  
and occupied the offices and demanded  
that the women be rehired and not  
lose their seniority. The president  
said at first that he wasn't going  
to allow them to come back, but  
after a small conference, decided the  
women could go back to work and not  
lose their seniority.

BMR: Have they received any flak  
since they've been back on the job?  
Have things changed for them there?

SALLY: At first, there were a few  
workers who--I don't know exactly how  
to describe it--were quite unkind to  
the women. But the majority of the  
women in the shop were very sympath-  
etic to the women, especially in light  
of the fact that they had been taken,  
and no consideration had been made  
for their families. One woman had  
left three children behind and a small  
baby.

BMR: What's the status of the case  
right now? Are the women pleading  
innocent to all of the charges?

SALLY: At the hearing, all of the  
women took the 5th amendment and re-  
fused to say anything that might  
prove to be self-incriminating. At  
this point, the INS lawyer is trying  
to get an order from the attorney gen-  
eral giving the women immunity so  
that they will have to answer any  
and all questions he asked regarding  
their birth places, when they entered  
the US, where they entered, and the  
status of their families.

One thing we've stressed from the  
beginning is that we really can't  
rely on the court for justice; we  
know that we have to rely on the peo-  
ple to move this case and get justice  
for the women. I think that if  
we can keep rallying the broad num-  
ber of people to go to these hearings  
and the trial, the women will be vic-  
torious in this struggle. And it is  
also going to mean victory for other  
undocumented workers, not just for  
the Gerry women.

BMR: How are the lawyers handling  
the case?

SALLY: What the lawyers are saying  
is that from the very day the agents  
went in to arrest them, it was illeg-  
al search and seizure, that the women  
were not advised of their rights in  
any way. They (INS) kept hounding  
them with questions like, “Where is  
your family; do you have kids here;  
how long have you been here; how did  
you get in?" Even in the INS offices,  
they were still not informed of their  
rights nor given a form, which they  
are supposed to be given before they  
are even talked to. And the fact that  
the company said they did not call  
the INS agents--that they are only  
going on an ‘anonymous tip'--is some-  
thing the lawyers are using in the  
case. The hearing we had a few weeks  
ago had to be continued because the  
judge and the lawyer for the INS are  
kind of baffled around what to do with  
this case. I think that they have  
never seen anything like this in Den-  
ver around deportation, with all of  
the women's supporters sitting in the  
courtroom listening to everything  
that the judge is saying. He knows,  
with that many people there, he's not  
going to be able to pull the wool  
over anybody's eyes.

Bluebirds Fly Free

By Pandoura & Bobbe

Six days before the Bluebird Five  
were to go on trial before Judge  
Carelli in the Denver City and County  
Building, the city attorney asked  
for dismissal of the charges. The  
charges have been dropped for good,  
thanks to solid feminist support,  
good media coverage, and a weak case  
for the prosecution.

The Bluebird Five--five Denver  
feminists--were charged with de-  
struction of property for pasting up  
anti-pornography leaflets and spray  
painting the front of the Bluebird,  
a local porn theater.

The charges were dropped “with  
prejudice", meaning that the five  
can never be charged again for that  
action.

The five are Crystal Arp, Lori  
Bradford, Judy Barlow, Pandoura Car-  
penter and Bobbe Ross.

The women had five good lawyers,  
prepared for a feminist defense had  
the case gone to trial. They also  
presented a solid block of unity  
among themselves that was tested  
on at least two occasions. One test  
came when the city attorney offered  
Crystal Arp a deferred judgment,  
with charges dropped against all of  
the others. Together, the five decided  
not to accept the city attorney's  
"deal", offered at a preliminary  
hearing in late December.

Another tactic of the city attor-  
ney to divide the five was to issue  
subpoenas to each of them to testify  
against the others.

The defendants had a strong defense  
committee and support from other  
feminists who jammed the courtroom  
in December and prepared for the trial  
which was to have been held Jan. 17.

At a final press conference Jan.  
17, the defendants restated the  
political points raised in their  
Oct. 31 action. Leaflets, which  
had been pasted on numerous Denver  
area porn shops and theaters, called  
on women to fight economic and poli-  
tical oppression. Immediately after  
the press conference, street theater  
was held in front of Sid Kings, an  
East Colfax Avenue porn bar. Members  
of the Defense committee, joined by  
two male supporters, presented a  
role reversal skit, showing men facing  
the same sorts of sexual objectifica-  
tion that women face.

A defense committee meeting has  
been scheduled for Jan. 29, at  
which the entire case will be eval-  
uated and decisions made about  
money raised before the trial date.

A full report will be printed in  
next month's BMR.

Lawyers for the Bluebird Five  
were Ruth Buechler, Jeannie Busacca,  
Patti Price, Sandra Rothenberg and  
Phil Cockerille.
