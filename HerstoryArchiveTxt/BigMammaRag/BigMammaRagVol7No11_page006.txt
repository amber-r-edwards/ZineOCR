Welcome Support

In one of the first actions of its
kind, some 1400 mostly male unionists
at a Washington state plywood plant
walked out on strike last October to
protest a contract violation stemming
from the company's sexual harassment
of a woman worker. The dispute began
when the woman sued the Simpson Ply-
wood Company. She charged she had been
refused a job because she did not ac-
cept the sexual advances of the com-
pany interviewer. The company, appar-
ently frightened of an adverse ruling,
hired the woman, but when she refused
to drop the complaint it fired her 26
days later. In firing her the company
violated the contract, say leaders of
the International Woodworkers Union
Local 38. They called a strike to de-
mand her reinstatement.

Wage Slave Suicide

A particular American form of sui-
cide," says Eula Bingham, executive
director of the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA), “is
holding a steady job." She isn't kid-
ding. Bingham says that at least
100,000 workers die each year, and
three or four times that many are dis-
abled as a result of occupational
disease. These are not workplace acci-
dents (which occur at a rate of about
2,000 a month) but illnesses attribut-
ed to the thousands of new chemicals,
untested for safety, that are being
introduced into industrial products
and processes.

Fetus Football

A family court judge in Houston has
reversed Judge William Bear in the
temporary guardianship case of a ten-
week-old fetus carried by an unmarried
teenager. Judge Bear had granted guard-
ianship of the fetus to Eileen Brady,
an identified anti-abortionist. Brady
then filed suit in the District Court
to prevent the teenager from having
an abortion, but the family court's
ruling removed the basis for that suit.

No Right to Her Life

A month ago a family court in Nova
Scotia, Canada awarded custody of an
unborn fetus to a "pro-life" group.
An 18-year-old woman, separated from
her husband, applied for an abortion
at Victoria General Hospital; her hus-
band went to staunch “pro-lifer" Ted
Moyer, who applied to family court to
have the unborn child placed under the
guardianship of a pro-life group,
arguing that the fetus fell into the
category of "a boy or girl under 16"
and deserved the same rights that a
child would have. Judge Ray Bartlett
accepted the argument and awarded
custody of the fetus to the group.

The case was held ex parte, meaning
that the woman was unaware of the
case until after the decision had
been handed down; meanwhile, the hos-
pital has now refused to perform the
abortion fearing a lawsuit. The wo-
man's lawyer is considering suing the
hospital and the abortion team for
support of the child because they
changed their mind over a three-day
period. The group, Nova Scotians Uni-
ted for Life, have said their inten-
tion was to stop the abortion, not
to gain guardianship in order to be
parents. The lawyers can argue back
and forth in higher and lower courts,
but what's ahead for the woman?

Blue Meanies

Three Paris policemen were convicted
last month of raping a 13-year-old
girl. It was the fifth time this year
that French police have been convicted
of rape. In September, two Paris cops
dragged a German tourist into their
patrol car and raped her after she
asked them for some information. The
cops said during the trial that they
had been drinking and were bored. In
the case of the 13-year-old, the cops
said they had been provoked because
the girl, who had run away from home,
wore only a nightgown.

Turkey’s Turkeys

Turkey's strongest women's organi-
zation, the Progressive Women's Or-
ganization, has been banned by a gov-
ernment “pledged to defend democratic
rights." The Progressive Women's Or-
ganization had a membership of 15,000
mostly working women. It was an activ-
ist organization, not specifically
feminist but concerned with women's
immediate problems—health care, mat-
ernity conditions, and literacy. It
also participated in the trade union
movement, trying to raise women's
consciousness of their position as
women in the working class. Martial
Law authorities closed its general
headquarters in Istanbul and its
branches all over the country. The
PWO is banned as an organization
though some activities continue and
no doubt it will open again under
another name.

Psychosexual Hostility

Women from the British feminist
magazine Spare Rib recently attended
a conference in Liverpool on "psycho-
sexual problems" which included a
paper on "Psychosexual problems in the
wake of the feminist movement." Dr.
Enoch, a Liverpool psychiatrist began
his talk with "Why are 95% of all
women's libbers ugly?" The Spare Rib
women reported that the chairman tried
to defuse the tension by saying the
remaining 5% were obviously at the
conference. Needless to say the women
left feeling depressed at the amount
of hostility towards feminism.

Sock It to Them

The Women's Equity Action League
has bestowed upon the Atlantic City,
NJ, Uptown Community Complex “one
dirty jock sock" where fifth and sixth
grade boys spend long, rainy lunch
hours playing basketball. The girls
get to watch, and a lucky few help
wash the boys’ towels after their
showers.

Life Isn’t Fair

Ellen Goodman, a nationally syndi-
cated columnist, handed out the third
annual “Life Isn't Fair" awards in a
recent column. The Stand By Her Man
prize for ardor in battle went to the
Santa Ana, CA, woman who sued her
ex-husband for alimony payments while
he was in a coma; the My Kind of Guy
button went to Massachusetts Governor
Edward J. King, who replaced the Com-
mission on the Status of Women with
the new Commission on the Status Quo
of Women. This group of conservatives
has so far tackled such tough matters
as distributing perfume samples.

Supreme Suit

The US Supreme Court, by refusing
last month to become involved in one
of the largest sex discrimination
suits ever filed, let stand an order
which forces the Western Electric Co.
to pay virtually all costs which may
arise in what may turn out to be more
than 2000 separate trials aimed at
the determination of damages sought
by women who have been discriminated
against by the company on the basis
of their sex.

The suit was first filed by Cleo
Kyriazi in 1973; in 1977, as a result
of that suit, a federal judge ruled
that Western Electric has systemati-
cally discriminated against women.
Kyriazi's suit was later certified
as a class action against the company
and more than 2,000 women have joined
her in charging sex discrimination.
Western Electric, owned by the Ameri-
can Telephone and Telegraph Co., has
announced they will contest any and
all damage claims on a case-by-case
basis.

TIT Classics

Feminists in Walla Walla, Washing-
ton went to action and forced the
cancellation of an Invitational Tourn-
ament, called TIT by the golf organ-
izers, in which women entered accord-
ing to their bra size: gum drop for
bra sizes 32-34 A; lemon, 32-34 C;
canteloupe, 32-34 D, and so on. Ron
Coleman, coordinator of the tourna-
ment, in hopes of promoting sales of
sports bras at the golf course's pro
shop, displayed a TIT tee shirt with
a photograph of a woman's breast when
he first announced the tournament.

Steamed Publisher

LithoCrafters, a printing company
specializing in the production of
small-press books, refused last spring
to reprint a lesbian novel originally
published in 1961 by Avon books.

“Love is Where You Find It," by Paula
Christian was returned almost immedi-
ately to Timely Books, the new pub-
lisher, because, according to Litho-
Crafters’ President Bill Nuffer, it
is not company policy "to print mater-
ial of a salacious character because
over half of our employees are ladies
and conservative men." Nuffer added,
however, that lesbianism is "not al-
ways salacious, but certain passages
are." Jo Anne Prather of Timely
Books theorizes that the determination
was made on the basis of the “over
picture of two women on the original
Avon edition which she says is “hardly
anything steamy."

Portuguese Purge

A 22-year-old nurse, Conceicao Mas-
sano, was acquitted October 29 in Lis-
bon of charges that she had had an
abortion three years ago. The Campaign
for Abortion and Contraception mobil-
ized women for support demonstrations.
On the day Massano was acquitted, ac-
cording to the Washington Post, "riot
police swinging clubs" fought women
demonstrating on her behalf. Four
people needed hospitalization.

According to Portuguese activists,
some 180,000 women have illegal abor-
tions in Portugal annually.

IQ Quackery

In a historic decision by a Federal
Judge in California, California school
districts can no longer use IQ tests
to place students in classes for the
mentally retarded. The 131-page opin-
ion issued in October is said to be
the first of its kind in the nation.
It sets an important precedent in the
area that is the focus of many third
world education activists. The ruling
stems from a 1971 suit filed by five
black San Francisco pupils who charged
they had been improperly placed in
Educable Mentally Retarded (EMR) clas-
ses on the basis of culturally biased
IQ tests.

Righteous Rapist

George Pappajohn, an affluent Van-
couver businessman, told the Canadian
Supreme Court he honestly believed he
had the woman's consent. Pappajohn
has been convicted by lower courts of
raping a woman in August 1976; the
Court has heard his final appeal and
has yet to make a decision. Melonie
Edwards testified that she had been
raped four or five times, finally
tying her hands behind her back and
gagging her with his bow tie. She
escaped from the house, naked and
still bound and with the gag around
her neck. Pappajohn claims that she
only put up token protests.

Workout With Valium

This session Congress is taking a
look at addicting drugs such as Valium
commonly prescribed to women by their
doctors. "It is not uncommon,” said
Representative Cardiss Collins, who
is urging the Congressional hearings,
"for a doctor to advise a male patient
to work out his problem in the gym,
while a female with the same symptoms
is likely to be given Valium."

Cutting the “Bloodline”

Billboards around Seattle recently
depicted the lower face, neck and
bared shoulders of a woman with a
bright red slash across her throat.
From a distance it looked as if her
throat had been cut; on closer in-
spection, the red line turned out
to be a ribbon. The billboard was
advertising the film, "Bloodline."
After a protest by the Seattle chap-
ter of Women Against Violence
Against Women, the billboards came
down. However, a Seattle daily paper
continued to run a quarter-page ad
of the same picture that was on the
billboards, and the ribbon was in
red. Very eye-catching; very harmful
to women.
