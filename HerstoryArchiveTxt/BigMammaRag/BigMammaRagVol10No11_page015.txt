brothers also left; and my
little sister, who was nine,
said she was going to join the
guerrillas and not die of hun-
ger or be killed by the troops.
Shortly after that, my fath-
er was murdered. He and other
peasants had occupied the
Spanish embassy in Guatemala
City to protest and to draw
attention to the repression in
El Quiché. He and 29 others
were murdered by the army.
Three months later, my mother
was raped and murdered by the
military. We, her children,
had to find another way to
struggle. Otherwise, it would
be impossible to go on.
A few years ago I went to
the city to become a maid. I
thought that everything would
be different there. But the
rich lady I worked for demand-
ed that I give up my Indian
clothes. "What would my friends
say if they saw you in my
house in those clothes?" She
gave meat to her dog; to me she
gave tortillas. To these people
an Indian is worth less than a
dog.
I must continue the fight that
my parents began. I joined the

organization of Revolutionary
Christians in order to get in-
volved in the mass struggle.

I began to learn Spanish, which
is necessary if those of us
from different areas want to
speak with each other. I also
learned three of the Indian
languages, but no one can know
all of the 20 that are spoken
in Guatemala.

The army is getting more and
more sophisticated, with its
weapons, equipment, tactics
and intelligence operations.
We must do the same; we must
know how to defend ourselves.
We must know how to get out of
our houses when the soldiers
block the doors. We must know
how to make and throw Molotov
cocktails. Even a two-year-old
child must know this. If a
child's parents are killed,
the child has the right to
defend itself. I have been do-
ing this—teaching and learning
these things.

Before I have children,
things must change. The Ladinos
celebrate the day honoring
Tecun Umán, an Indian here
who fought against the Spanish.
We refuse to celebrate this
day because we can't accept
that our struggle lies in the
past, as if it were over. We
haven't given up fighting.
People think the Indians are
idiots because we are so obed-

because we don't speak
Spanish. But we are fully con-
scious of who we are and what
our rights are. It is this
consciousness that prevents

me from having children and
leads me to participate in

the struggle.

As a woman, I have decided
not to marry and not to have
any children. Our traditions

don't accept that. A woman
must have children, and we
enjoy having them. But I

could not stand it if what
happened to my brother happen-
ed to a child of mine. I have
often wished that my mother
had aborted me and that I had
never seen the light of day.

I also don't want to have a
lover. That would only bring
additional pain. They would
most likely kill him and I
don't want to cry anymore. At
one time I had a lover. He
went to the city and dreamed
about having a home and living
in peace. But for me that
wasn't possible. As it is, I
am no longer in control of my
meager existence. The world
that I live in is so gruesome
so bloody. From one moment to
the next, they can destroy me.
That's why I can only struggle.

There is an amazing
moment that comes between
the end of a song and the
beginning of the audience’s
applause. I can hear a sigh
from anywhere in the room
in that second or two of
intense stillness. Through

that tiny opening, I feel a
powerful stream of energy
flowing between the
audience and me. We

are incredibly vulnerable.
And we are nurtured.
