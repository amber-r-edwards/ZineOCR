Reconstructing Feminism

movies depicting Native Amer-
ican women stereotypically

as whores who either enjoy
abuse or as subhuman Car-
icatures of human beings.

In a cross-cultural study of
52 religious children's texts
Irene Lorfing (Lebanon) found
women were rarely portrayed
as full human beings. Three
images arose frequently in
both Eastern and Western
texts:

- a flat sex role ster-
eotype,
- women dominated by culture
and rarely permitted to make
decisions, and 
- women as objects. Phanuel Akubeze
Egejura (Nigeria) noted that
the images of African women
exported in literature showed
them usually as property,
appendages to men or one of
several wives waiting around
for male attention.

One of the most shocking
presentations of sexist i-
mages was Brenda Verner's
(USA) depiction of Black wo-
men in the US media. Her an-
ger at the devaluation of wo-
men, both as Black and as wo-
men, grew as she described
how famous Black men contin-
ually reinforced it. Her
powerful voice brought home
the pain of the internal
struggle for positive ident-
ification under these cir-
cumstances. In affirming the
power of language and naming,
Verner noted the evolution
of the word "Black", from an
adjective to a noun. As a
noun it denies the humanity
of a people, a history, land
base, political power and
international connection. A Kenyan woman

in the audience added that
the reaction against the term
Afro-American demonstrates
the potential power of self-
naming by exposing the
threat of political connect-
ion between US Blacks and
Africans.

Isabel Letelier's keynote
address focused on what she
called the "double journey
of women" in her country and
elsewhere. This journey in-
cludes rejecting reforms and
fighting for national liber-
ation with her people while
at the same time demanding
women's liberation. A single
path, doubly arduous, she
cautioned against leaving a-
side women's demands and ex-
horted us to “change roles
behind the barricades" while
struggling against imperial-
ism. The struggle for control
over our bodies must be unit-
ed for social justice.
Hellieth Saffioti (Brazil)
reiterated, “We have to fight
against everything at once...
integrate our struggle a-
gainst machismo with our
fight against the massive un-
employment and hunger of our
people." Letelier emphasized
the necessity of autonomous
women's organizations in as-
suring a voice for women's
demands within national lib-
eration struggles. Speakers
specifically warned against
faith in socialist revolution
alone to liberate women.
Tohidi stated that without
autonomous women's organiza-
tions "women become tools of
the revolution, the first to
die and the last to be liber-
ated." Juanita Ramos (USA)
voiced her fear that to work
in Puerto Rican liberation
groups in NY while ignoring
her oppression as a Lesbian
could lead her into post-
revolutionary prison camps.
Winona LaDuke criticized so-
cialism for its potential to
exploit the land and stress-
ed that we must forge a strug-
gle for the survival of the
planet. If we fail to raise
all these issues simultane-
ously, to create a dialectical
journey in our movement, we
find ourselves trapped by the
oppressions we allow to per-
sist. Many speakers agreed
that the struggle we envis-
ioned would be the longest
and most thorough in history
but to fall short could mean
losing everything.
Motlelapula Chabaku gave an
impassioned speech on the re-
sponsibility of First World
women to organize against
imperialism as well as women's
oppression: "Our destinies are inter-
twined...you live in afflu-
ence on our pain. We watch
our children die in this age
of plenty but we have the
minerals that keep this
country going, we have the
labor...We must be concern-
ed about all issues." As
others pointed out, if US
feminists ban Depo-Provera
here only to have it export-
ed to the Third World, what
have we accomplished for the
world's women? First World
women must be constantly a-
ware of the implications of
our struggle worldwide. El
Saadawi concluded her talk
with the need to hold conf-
erences like this one but
also to create permanent or-
ganizations. For American
women, Letelier outlined
tasks of educating children
about human rights, learning
about and supporting Third
World struggles and publicly
criticizing imperialist
ideologies such as the Mil-
ton Friedman model of devel-
opment originated in the US
and applied in Chile.

Women who have done exten-
sive analysis of global
domination by multinational
corporations pointed out
that racism, sexism and eco-
nomic exploitation are very
well integrated in their
structures. El Saadawi out-
lined the creation and
growth of a global economy
and stressed that this
gives women the grounds for
global resistance. Neo-colo-
nialism in the Third World
absolutely prohibits the in-
dependence of women, as does
capitalism in this country.
As repression escalates here
and abroad, we women in-
creasingly face the same en-
emy, though on very differ-
ent fronts and in very dif-
ferent ways. Women bear the
brunt of oppression in most
societies. Examples which
arose in the course of the
Conference included Guata-
mala where women and child-
ren are often the victims
of massacres in the high-
lands, S. Africa where women
under apartheid have the
responsibility of feeding
themselves and their fami-
lies under impossible cond-
itions, and the increased
health risks of Black women
in the US. Cheryl Johnson
(USA) summed up in her clos-
ing address that because
Third World women personally
experience all these forms
of oppression in their lives
a unified women's movement
has the potential of being
the most liberating struggle
in history.

In closing speeches, the
organizers of the Conference
concluded that we did not
have grounds for an interna-
tional women's movement, but
must form alliances around
issues. Their remarks seemed
to contradict what many con-
ference participants per-
ceived as a growing con-
sciousness of the need for
solidarity among women
worldwide.
