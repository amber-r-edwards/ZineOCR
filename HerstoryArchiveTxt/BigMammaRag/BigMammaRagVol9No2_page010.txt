Two Big Contradictions In Terms

Women have rape fantasies, bondage
fantasies, fantasies of being over-
whelmed by a sexual partner or
partners. Do such fantasies necess-
arily mean that women want to be
raped, bound, or overwhelmed; or
do they mean that women—who have
been taught to be sexual objects—
occasionally fantasize about being
seductive and irresistible consonant
with conditioning? The contention
that fantasy, once made manifest
through acting out, loses its hold
on the individual is an interesting
one. The reverse, however, seems to
be the case; for fantasy, once it
enters the realm of reality, has ta-
ken hold and maintains power over
the individual. The cathartic theory
has been challenged over and over
again. Information now points to
the idea that behavior is reinforced
through repetition rather than
fantasy exorcised through expression.
But, then, why all this fuss over
what some have "chosen" to do? There
are those who would say that S&M is
just plain fun, those that would
cringe at the thought of a sexual
political correctness. If S&M is
just plain fun, why should anyone
care? I care; I care that some women
have grown to love their chains. The
master-slave roles are nothing new
just as making light of oppression
is nothing new. The anything-goes—

attitude in this philosophy of sexual
liberation frees a person from re-
sponsibility, frees a person from
having to think beyond the proscribed
male perspective saturated in role
dualism. It is easier to let the
groin do the talking than the mind to
do the thinking; but sexuality is
not something that exists in a vac-
uum, something to be confined to
the responsiveness of the groin.
Feminists who oppose S&M as a
pornographic male subculture are
rebuked by lesbian feminists into
S&M who levy old blows of puritanism
and accuse feminists of oppressing
a sexual minority. They play on
old feminist guilt for not being
sisterly enough to accept everyone.
Feminists, on the other hand, are
beginning to dare to draw lines, to
leave behind the feminine role of
accepting and understanding every-
thing. Champions of lesbian feminist
S&M say we are anti everything, anti-
transvestism, anti-prostitution,
anti-pederasty like all the other
sex-for-reproduction-only moralists
as they align us with the Klan, the
Nazis, and the Anita Bryants. They
accuse us of fueling the fire of the
moral majority's oppression of sex-
ual minorities. Feminists do not
fuel the fire—the fire is fueled
by defenders of female imitation,

and water scenes as they confuse sex-
uality with toilet habits and general
abusiveness, I do not pity the poor
masochist or the poor sadist, and

I have grown weary of the oh-how-
more-oppressed-am-I-than-thou

blues.

Let us, for a moment, look again
at the definitions of sadism and
masochism. Sadism is broadly defined
in terms of inventive sexuality,
possibly innate or culturally norma-
tive, a consensual source of pleasure
in which a sadist wields power or
inflicts pain over the masochist
who derives enjoyment from receiving
the pain or submitting to the power.
Pain in S&M is simply erotic sensa-
tion. Sadism and masochism, however,
more aptly fit into old constructs
of male superiority and female
inferiority with sadism "the erotic-
ization of violence" and masochism
"the eroticization of powerlessness."
(Lavendar Culture, John
Stoltenberg.)

For women to degrade and hurt
each other is to conform to and to
confirm male myths about female
sexuality. The primary myth that
feminists fight to dispel is that
we are first and foremost sexual ob-
jects with all else merely peripher-
al, that we are so sex-starved and
orgasm-focused that we will do what-
ever it takes to make us come—

a myth that has steeped our psyches
in self-hatred. "Feminists are women
who are sick to death of being de-
fined sexually. Our enemy is the
Establishment—its laws and its
institutions. S&M not only does not
share a common enemy with us, but
longs to be recognized as part of
the essence of the power structure
that is our enemy." (Ti-Grace Atkin-
son addressing the Eulenspiegel
Majority Report, September,
1977.)

Lesbian feminist S&M clearly mod-
els itself after straight and gay
male cultures, cultures in which
there is little room for women "to
discover what it means to be self-
defined, self-loving, woman-identi-
fied, neither an imitation man nor
his objectified opposite. In spite
of this, lesbians throughout his-
tory have survived, worked, support-
ed each other in community, and
passionately loved." (On Lies, Se-
crets, and Silences, "The Meaning
of Our Love for Women," Adrienne
Rich, p. 225-6.) We will continue
to survive, work, support and pas-
sionately love each other only to the
extent that we can create positive,
loving and life-affirming relation-
ships with each other, relationships
that are the very pulse of our wo-
men's culture.

definition of "socially accepted
sex," and is an extreme outgrowth
of the lesbian feminist therapy
movement.

Throughout Sapphistry, Pat Califia
refers to the puritanical society
which has defined our notions of hu-
man sexuality. She repeats, both
directly and indirectly, that our
world is anti-sexual, that all forms
of sexual expression are taboo; and
that consequently, any sexual expres-
sion at all threatens the system as
we know it.

This is not true. We are taught
from infancy on that just as there
are "no-no's," there are certain
acceptable ways to experience and to
express our sexuality. To paraphrase
the Feminist English Dictionary,
patriarchy has created traditional
slots for women's sexual status:
whore, wife, and old maid. And while
these roles are defined by women's
relationships to others (i.e. to men)
they are also laden with sexual im-
ages and expectations—how women
look when they are being "sexual."
Automatically, we picture the loose
open-legged stance of the whore; or
the prone, accepting image of a
wife lying on her back; or the lonely
frozen emptiness of an old maid,
forever lying alone. These are media-
maintained images that, however lim-
iting, continue to define female
sexuality.

On the flip side of the coin are
the male images—the double stan-
dard that promotes male sexual acti-
vity while keeping women passive.

And while Califia makes reference
to traditional role definitions,

she never acknowledges that our
puritanical society finds this kind
of sexuality acceptable. It is not
that all sex is taboo; it is that
certain kinds of sex are taboo. What
society cannot tolerate is the po-
tential of all women to be open,

self-determined sexual beings.
Societal morals are based on the
roles traditionally assigned to keep
women flat on our backs, totally
fucked over by patriarchy. To truly
threaten the system, it is not
enough to just "express our sexual-
ity," nor is it enough for us to
choose to relate sexually only to
women—we must first refuse to
mimic the roles we have been taught,
we must break through these expec-
tations to really challenge the
powers that be.

And I do not, in any way, see les-
bian sadomasochism as a threat to
society—instead, it is a threat
to all of us as lesbian feminists,
and to the women's movement as a
whole. The very idea of "tops
and bottoms," of women humiliating
and hurting each other is far from
liberating—instead, it almost
exactly reproduces the roles we
have already learned are OK. Califia
would argue that my imagination is
limited and that I'm uptight about
my own sexuality but the fact is
that for many of us, the struggle
against role playing and violence
against women has been made even
more difficult by books like Sapphis-
try. Califia states, "S/M is a
form of sexual rebellion...it is
non-reproductive, denies any correla-
tion between maleness and sexual con-
trol or femaleness and sexual passi-
vity..." And while she tells us
that no erotic act has an intrinsic
value of its own, she defines humi-
liation as a "deliberate lowering
of the bottom's status" and that
"the bottom who derives pleasure
from being shamed or abased is
triumphing over that degradation."
And this perverse logic is emphasized
by all the options that Califia
outlines. An example: "In an S/M
context, giving someone an enema
symbolizes taking control of her ex-
cretory functions. Deciding when and

if someone will be allowed to
relieve herself represents a lot of
power."

The examples go on and on, making
Sapphistry not only a guide, but a
book of "etiquette" for sadomasoch-
istic lesbians. Again, I emphasize
that no matter what kind of argu-
ments Califia makes, they are based
on faulty analysis—she sees
sadomasochism as a threat to societ-
ally defined "acceptable sex." In
reality, sadomasochism enforces the
roles that have been created to
keep us in place and to keep us
playing sexual games with each oth-
er.

The final point I want to make is
that many of the theories used to
justify lesbian sadomasochism grow
out of the whole lesbian/feminist
therapy trend. In therapy, many
women are encouraged to explore
their fantasies, and what Califia
calls the "darker or more dangerous
side of ... eroticism." But, throu-
ghout the therapy process, the
political implications of these
fantasies are avoided like the pla-
gue. Women are encouraged to do
“their own thing," to make their
lives into whatever they want—
regardless of how this relates to
other women's lives. The emphasis
is on the individual rather than
the collective solution.

Further, women are told by fem-
inist therapists that no fantasy is
too weird, kinky, or dangerous—
just what Califia bases much of
her argument on. While it is impor-
tant to discuss fantasies and their
origins and implications, the fact
remains that the "darker side" of
eroticism can indeed be dangerous.
If we call ourselves lesbian femin-
ists, we must reject the premise
that "anything goes," especially
when "anything" requires a victim.
Victimization occurs on many levels
in sadomasochism—ultimately, all

of us are the victims as long as
some women choose to hurt other
women in the name of "liberated
sexuality."

What goes on between two women in
bed is symbolic of what goes on
between them in their relationship.
A therapist told me that—and while
I hold the statement as true, I also
see it as incomplete. Whatever goes
on in bed is also symbolic of the
way that a woman relates to other
women and to the world at large.
Our sexual behavior is indeed poli-
tical—and I believe that if we
oppress other women (yes, humilia-
ting and hurting another woman is
an act of oppression) we are also
oppressing each other politically.
And no woman who is involved in
sadomasochism is a feminist—no
matter how well she plays the word
games that explain her behavior.

Feminism in the 1970s witnessed
many changes. One of the most
positive was the growing acceptance
of lesbianism within the movement,
and the broadening definitions of
women's sexuality. But, for many
women who approached this without
political analysis, the acceptance
became distorted into the monster
of sadomasochistic theory. Sapphis-
try is more than a book of theory,
though—it is a distortion of fem-
inism itself. Naiad Press made a
grave error in publishing the book;
but we, as lesbian feminists do
not have to compound the mistake by
buying, or promoting the book.

And once again, we must risk
unpopularity by criticizing Sapphis-
try and all the premises behind it.
Lesbian sadomasochism is not fem-
inist—but it is a feminist issue.
If Califia and others see us as
being "puritanical" and dangerous
to each other, she is forgetting
our obligation to one another—and
that entails breaking through all
the chains, especially the ones
we put on each other.
