This is the season for films  
about women and their  
marriages. Although the three  
best films are written and  
directed by men, they offer some  
good viewing of women coping  
with marriage, divorce and  
widowhood. All three have won  
various awards already and are  
sure to be nominated for a varie-  
ty of Oscars. They range from  
funny to hopeful to disquieting.  
All three are worth the viewing  
and raise some valid questions.  

Scenes from  
A Marriage  

Directed by Ingmar Bergman.  
Starring Liv Ullman and Erland  
Josephson  

SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE  
is a little too long (3 hours) and is  
a frustrating experience  
because the subtitles are totally  
inadequate for the dialogue ac-  
tually taking place. Originally  
made in six “scenes” for  
Swedish television, this film is  
without Bergman’s usual hidden  
meanings and mysticism. After  
ten years in a “perfect” marriage  
(Security, order, comfort, and  
loyalty. It's almost vulgar.)  
Johan and Marianne awake to  
find that they are frustrated by  
each other and that they are  
beginning to hate one another.  
Johan leaves for an affair with a  
woman 20 years his junior and  
Marianne is left to cope with the  
children and the remnants of her  
life. Their relationship is one of  
mental pain for pain, hurt for  
hurt, which deteriorates into  
physical violence. It is not until  
they have been divorced for  
almost eight years—and have  
remarried that they begin to  
come to terms with themselves  
and with one another. They are  
lovers once more and Bergman  
lets us see that they will con-  
tinue to grow and to become  
more of their own persons,  
perhaps in spite of themselves.  

Alice Doesn't Live  

Here Anymore  

Directed by Martin Scorsese  
Starring Ellen Burstyn with  
Alfred Lutter, Diane Ladd and  
Kris Kristofferson  

ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE  
ANYMORE is by far the funniest  
of the three, and yet is perhaps  
the saddest. The story of a  
woman who gave up the begin-  
nings of a singing career in  
Monterrey to marry the Coca  
Cola salesman and move to  
Socorro, New Mexico, is the  
story of a million other women  
who have given up a career for  
husband and home. After her  
husband is killed in an auto acci-  
dent, Alice decides to try again  
for a singing career in  
Monterrey. She sells everything,  

packs up her 11-year-old son  
(who in this reviewer's eyes,  
could be the most obnoxious  
child to ever make a screen  
appearance) and heads for  
Monterrey. She makes it to  
Phoenix where she gets a job in  
a bar singing and playing piano  
and ends up with a boyfriend  
who makes her husband look  
like a saint. He finds his wife at  
Alice's and literally kicks her out  
of the room. He then tells Alice  
that, like the plastic-encased  
scorpion he wears around his  
neck, he is a dangerous man to  
mess with. Alice beats a hasty  
retreat and is soon on the  
highway again.  

In Tucson, she gets a job in a  
nightmare café at the motel they  
are staying in. There she meets  
Flo, a brash, outspoken woman,  
most delightfully portrayed by  
Diane Ladd. Flo tells the boss  
that she could lay under him, eat  
fried chicken and do a crossword  
puzzle and still not be excited by  
him. She tells Alice that by un-  
buttoning another button at the  
top of her uniform she will get  
more tips because then the  
customers can see more of her  
breasts when she leans over.  
She is a comfort to Alice when  
her romance with a local  
rancher (Kris Kristofferson)  
breaks up. She tells her that she  
must decide what it is that she  
really wants to do and then set  
her mind to doing it. She points  
out that she too is alone in the  
world with a child to raise and  
that she is just taking things as  
they come.  

In the end, her rancher tells  
her that actually she can sing  
anywhere she wants and that  
she just has to make up her  
mind. He even offers to sell his  
ranch and take her to Monterrey  
so that she can decide what it is  
she really wants. As the film  
ends we wonder what she will  
decide to do. Can her life ac-  
commodate another man, her  
child and her singing career?  
Will she take up the offer to go to  
Monterrey and try to regain her  
faded career? We are left with  
the feeling that whatever Alice  
decides, she will continue to  
grow and eventually find the  
woman she is becoming.  

A Woman Under  

The Influence  

Directed by John  
Cassavetes, Starring Gena  
Rowlands and Peter Falk.  

Kathleen O’Brien  

One thought kept coming to  
mind after viewing John  
Cassavetes’ “A Woman Under  
the Influence” — no relief. In for-  
cing us to stare at the prisons we  
make for ourselves, Cassavetes  
pounds us like rocks in a severe  

hurricane; when it’s over we are  
standing, but altered from the  
relentless, unremitting beating.  
That is how it was for Mabel  
Longhetti, the woman who  
fights to keep body and soul  
together in this picture and  
loses. Mabel’s story is not un-  
usual; what’s odd about a  
woman trying to cope with a  
mother-in-law, three children,  
and a husband who neither un-  
derstands her nor allows her to  
be herself. Mabel doesn’t even  
know what that is. “I can be  
anything you want, Nicki, just  
tell me” cuts into even the most  
peripheral feminist. But Mabel  
seeks her liberation in crossing  
the threshold of the fantasy  
world, darting in and out so  
skillfully at times that one  
wonders where the lovable kook  
ends and the disturbed being  
takes over. Her antics and  
behavior eventually land her in a  
mental hospital for six months,  
leaving the children to her hus-  
band, Nick. Watching him fumbl-  
ing around in his work  
relationships and trying to cope  
with three youngsters, one  
wonders if perhaps the wrong  
person has been committed.  

What keeps this from being  
one more soap opera is the  
superb acting of Gena Rowlands  
and Peter Falk. Gena as Mabel is  
just the right blend of strength  
and insecurity; her performance  
makes the concept of liberation  
through insanity chillingly real.  
Peter Falk is too close to home as  
the threatened, inept, well-  
meaning husband. On the one  
hand he is always urging Mabel  
to “be yourself,” reminding her  
that it is her house and then  
screaming for her to sit her ass  
down. An all too telling com-  
mentary on the great American  
marriage machine. But as in all  
great American machines,  
Mother bounces back. She tucks  
the children in, still dripping  
blood from her wrist-slashing  
attempt, telling them not to  
worry; she’s grown up therefore  
she’s fine. And as she smiles at  
Nick bandaging her hand, one is  
left with the distinct feeling that  
in a little while Mabel will jump  
from the frying pan into a bigger  
frying pan.  

The largest distracting feature  
of this film is the sound. Much is  
lost in the attempts to be real and  
unpretentious. If the viewer tries  
to absorb all the assaults to the  
auditory system, a splitting  
headache is almost guaranteed.

Diana Press  
Still Afloat  

Carol Hille  

On December 27 the roof and  
third floor of 12 West 25th  
Street, home of Diana Press of  
Baltimore, was destroyed by fire.  
Diana Press, although housed in  
the basement, received exten-  
sive water damage to its  
presses, composer and paper.  
Among the casualties were the  
1975 edition of The Day Before  
Garland: a 1975 women’s  
calendar, the 1975 advertising  
brochure and lesbianism and  
the Women’s Movement.  

Coletta Reid reported, “Ac-  
tually, we were very lucky.  
Across the hall in 10 West 25th  
(our bindery), we had half of the  
second issue of Quest, The  
Sheep Book of Lollipop Power  
and the Whole Woman  
Catalogue, A North Carolina  
Women’s Guide plus all of our  
other books. The water that  
came pouring through the ceil-  
ing on the press side also ran  
over to the other side, but very  
few books were damaged. What  
water-spotting that did occur  
was caused by the carelessness  
of the firemen when they  
shoveled out the water.  

“The police called us about  
7:55 a.m., saying the building  
was burning. Someone in the  
third floor apartment had fallen  
asleep smoking. We arrived just  
in time to let the gas and electric  
company in or they would have  
broken down the door. We got  
the composer out, but nothing  
else was easily moveable. I have  
no idea how much water they  
hosed into the building, but it all  
ended up in our basement —  
some four inches deep. The  
place looked like a dark rain-  
forest when the firemen left. No  
electricity, no heat, and water  
dripping out of the ceiling. Since  
the building has had no roof for  

three weeks, water has con-  
tinued to drip whenever it has  
rained or snowed.  

“They just finished putting the  
roof on yesterday and we have  
just now gotten the presses back  
into printing condition. Our first  
job has been to re-do the  
datebook and calendar. We re-  
set the type and re-did the paste-  
up at home and will print them  
this week. We hope women will  
still buy them — in fact, we've  
added an extra month —  
January, 1976 — to the calendar  
so no one will feel cheated.  

“We had fire insurance and  
have put in a claim for $4,500 —  
$1,000 for damage to equip-  
ment, $2,000 for paper, and $1,  
500 for art supplies, type and  
paste-up. The insurance com-  
pany, of course, is giving us a  
hard time dragging their feet all  
the way. But we expect them to  
pay within six weeks to six  
months. Right now, that makes  
our financial situation very  
touch-and-go as we have had to  
re-buy the paper ourselves. We  
were depending on the calendar  
and datebook sales for money to  
repay loans we took out last  
year. In March 1974 five in-  
dividual women loaned us $3,  
500 altogether to enable us to  
buy a $7,000 high-speed  
collator. So far a number of other  
women’s groups have come to  
our aid. Our new brochure was  
made possible by the help of  
Olivia Records, Quest, First  
Things First, KNOW News, and  
Baltimore Women’s Center. If  
women across the country ap-  
preciate our predicament and  
respond, we'll make it through  
what was almost a disaster.”  

Diana Press, owned and  
operated by women, is a com-  
mercial printshop and feminist  
publishing house that offers  
quality work and top priority to  
women’s jobs.
