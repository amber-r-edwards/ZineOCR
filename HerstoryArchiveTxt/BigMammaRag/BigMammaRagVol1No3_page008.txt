ther, men have been unable to form  
a truly human picture of women.  
Mother Nature is good; she gives  
men life and the means to keep on  
living. But embedded in this ability  
is tremendous uncontrolled (by men)  
power. The Good Mother Nature can  
become Pandora, Eve, "The unsealer  
of the forbidden trees, the devil's  
gateway." Long after witchcraft  
had ceased to occupy Americans,  

the split image of women continued  
to haunt us. In the last century,  
Woman was either the sexless angel  
or the depraved but exciting cour-  
tesan. A favorite device of Ameri-  
can novelists for two hundred  
years has been the juxtaposition  

of the snow maiden and the dark  
lady. Nathaniel Hawthorne, author  
of the Scarlet Letter, is typical  

in his use of the contrasting  
images. In his Blithedale Romance  
he juxtaposed the dark-haired, sen-  
sual Zenobia (probably modeled on  
Margaret Fuller, an early feminist)  
and the frail blond Priscilla,  

who is Philip Wylie's or Philip  
Roth's "Mom" if not the dangerous  
woman in a new guise, emasculating  
her male children as did the "vagina  
dentata" - the vagina with teeth -  

of earlier myths. Woman is the  
incomprehensible "Other," angel-  
ically good or diabolically evil.  
(When she was good, she was very  
very good...)

Women's Voice  

The Woman's Voice bookstore  
needs the support of all  
sisters. By narrowing the  
market to feminists, the store  
has made itself a specialist  
bookstore. The Woman's  
Voice is in trouble if there  
is not more support by the  
public.  

Any requests for special  
books are welcomed by the  
bookstore. The management  
appreciates any help in loca-  
ting new material by feminists,  
or of interest to women. It  
is very difficult to keep  
aware of all the new material  
published on women and the  
women's movement. Please help  
the bookstore serve you better.  
Your support is greatly appre-  
ciated.  

What is it about us that men find  
so unfathomable? "I just can’t  
understand women!" How often have  
we heard that one? Isn't it too  
bad we can't just be ordinary human  
beings? It would all be so much

easier. I must admit, though, I  
am at times envious of the witch's  
traditional powers, and don't you  
enjoy the way the thunder roars  
and the lightning cracks when  
Mother Nature's butter turns out to  
be margarine?  

In this article, I have made exten-  
sive use of a very interesting new  
pamphlet by Barbara Ehrenreich and  
Deirdre English, “Witches, Midwives,  
and Nurses: A History of Women  
Healers." It is available at the new  
women's bookstore, The Woman's  
Voice, 673 South Pearl. I have also  
relied on papers written by two of  
my women's history students, Judy  
Matchett's "Momism: From Philip  
Wylie to Philip Roth" and Dorothy  
Kiernan's, "Witchcraft: The Role  

of Women in the Witch Craze of the  
16th and 17th Centuries." Margaret  
Murray in her The God of the Witches  
discusses European witchcraft as  

an ancient, indigenous cult. Norman  
Cohn in The Pursuit of the Millen-  
nium discusses the bizarre sects  

of Medieval Europe. Malleus Male-  
ficarum is in paper. There are  
many histories of witchcraft in the  
English colonies including among  

the most recent, Marion L. Starkey's  
The Devil in Massachusetts and  
Chadwick Hansen, Witchcraft at  
Salem. The theme of the evil  

woman is explained in detail in H.R.  
Hay's The Dangerous Sex. Last, the  
YSA posters of famous women in histo-  
ry that I mentioned in my last  
article are available at the Women's  
Voice.
