Jane Alpert Response

May 11, 1975  
Sisters,

Just read your recent issue.  
The coverage of Jane Alpert was  
excellent. Linda Fowler did a fine  
job, bringing in many closely  
related events I have seen  
mentioned nowhere else. Finally  
the intense coverage and in-  
tegrity of this strong woman  
shine through the prevalent  
attacks and smear tactics, at  
least for those who look beyond  
them. May your vision always  
remain so clear, and may others  
be enlightened by your clarity.

In Sisterhood,

Pat McGloin

Dear Sisters:

These are hard times. If un-  
questioning criticism of Jane  
Alpert is irresponsible, dogmatic  
and divisive, so ultimately, is  
unquestioning support. Your  
strong defense of Jane Alpert  
(May 75) was misleading in  
several respects. Most women  
in Colorado have not had a  
chance to see the statements  
which criticized Alpert in the  
first place. By your decision not  
to print those statements critical  
of Alpert, Big Mama Rag side-  
stepped the chance for serious  
feminist discussion of the  
issues. Neither Jane Alpert nor  
your readers are helped by this  
kind of ‘protection’. The  

feminists of Colorado are  
capable of hearing all sides and  
drawing their own conclusions.  
In the past six months, three  
underground women, including  
Jane Alpert, have been im-  
prisoned or face imprisonment  
for political acts against the  
state. Seven more women have  
been imprisoned or face im-  
prisonment for no other act than  
the refusal to testify before a  
grand jury. Many women with  
varying levels of involvement in  
feminist groups have been  
questioned by the FBI.  
Feminists in other cities have  
been concerned with this recent  
government attempt to repress  
and divide the Women’s Move-  
ment. Jane Alpert’s voluntary  
surrender to the authorities is  
central to these issues. So are  
the criticisms of Alpert raised by  
Ti Grace, Flo Kennedy, the Off  
Our Backs collective and the  
Weatherwomen’s Underground.  
Prior to these events, how  
many of us had thought about  
the dangers involved in testify-  
ing before the grand jury? How  
many of us had ever thought we  
would have to seriously question  
as well as support the actions of  
a sister? How many of us had  
considered what we would or  
wouldn't say if an FBI agent  
appeared at our door? And how  
many of us believed that the  
government's threats of “in-  
formers” and prison would have  
threatened the solidarity of  
women to the point where we  
could not honestly analyze and  
discuss the issues?  
If we recognize the women’s  
movement as more than the

social event of the decade, if we  
are going to develop strategies  
for feminist revolutionary  
change, we must examine the  
current government attack and  
all our responses to it.  

We fully believe Pat Swinton  
when she says that Jane Alpert  
would not knowingly collaborate  
with the authorities and that  
Jane was not responsible for her  
(Pat Swinton’s) arrest. But the  
question of whether or not any  
woman can turn herself into the  
government without increasing  
the danger to the political groups  
she has worked with is more  
complicated. Turning herself in  
does not mean she will disclose  
information that the government  
can use against others. But by  
putting herself in a position  
where the authorities can close-  
ly question her about her ac-  
tivities, she greatly increases the  
risk. Few women can judge  
whether Alpert was right or  
wrong in choosing a term in  
federal prison over a lifetime of  
prison underground; yet we  
must continue to question  
when, or whether, such an  
action is the best choice.  

It is also our responsibility as  
feminists to comment on certain  
political statements Alpert made  
shortly after her surrender. In  
the interview appearing in BMR  
(Feb. 75), Alpert indicated that  
feminists should not work for  
socialism or “left” issues. In the  
same interview, she states that  
“the first priority of feminism at  
this time lies in personal self-  
growth and finding our own  
creativity." For those of us  
whose whole lives have been a  
series of waitress, domestic and  
clerical jobs, finding the leisure  
time to seek such “personal  
growth” is difficult. While we  
agree that women should bail  
out of the male left and work on  
developing feminist theory, if  
such a theory is to benefit all  
women, it must include the  
struggle against class and race  
privilege as a concrete, stated  
priority. While Jane Alpert did  
not create the conflicts between  
working and middle class  
women within the movement,  
we feel that her statements  
reflected a strong middle class  
bias. Moreover, she made these  

statements at a time when few  
feminists feel free to question  
them and when she is not in a  
position to clarify any mis-  
conceptions drawn from her  
statements. This has only added  
to the confusion and debate  
around her surrender.  

Unlike Big Mama Rag, we do  
not view Jane Alpert as a  
heroine, but we do see her as a  
woman “caught between a rock  
and a hard place.” Jane Alpert is  
a political prisoner of the male  
state and as such we fully  
support and defend her.  

In struggle,

Dear Sisters,  
Upon reading your May issue,  
I discovered that our politics are  
very much the same and that I  
want to support your burgeoning  
feminism. I wish to subscribe to  
your paper and would you please  
start with that issue (volume 3-  
A, no. 4) on Jane Alpert. I foresee  
your importance in the future of  
the women’s movement. I wish  
you all the luck. Blessed be.  
With love and support,  
Emily O'Brien

Dear Linda:  
Women here are really ap-

last few issues have been fan-  
tastic. The night before the April  
issue arrived, a few of us were  
discussing our reactions to the  
exclusionary costs of the Sagaris  
program. Then Big Mama Rag  
arrived with your article on  
“Feminist Catch 22” — ex-  
pressing the same conflicts.  

At a Pueblo self-health  
presentation this week, I  
overheard some sisters talking  
about how Jill Johnston “trashed”  
Ann Schaef in Denver. That  
was not my impression of what  
happened. The set up was  
unfortunate for all concerned,  
especially for both Ann and Jill.  
My reactions would take too long  
here, but basically I felt we  
should have tuned in much  
earlier (a few did, I think) to the  
heavy associations Jill was  
making, to have been more  
sensitive to her feelings and to  
have allowed her to express her  
discomfort in the situation. As a  
very real and generalized part of  
women’s oppressive history (&  
Jill's in particular), it seems  
legitimate to question and to be  
trustful of the whole therapy  

ag.  

I do not know Ann Schaef, but  
have heard many good things  
about her. I did not feel negative  
toward her that night, but angry  
at those who in her defense  
seemed to negate Jill's ex-  
periences, feelings, lifestyle,  
being, by refusing recognition.
