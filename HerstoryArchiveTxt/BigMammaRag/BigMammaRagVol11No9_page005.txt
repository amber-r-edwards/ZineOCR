night, the time of sex, and
night, the time of race. Fear
of the dark is manipulated
into fear of black - black
men in particular. Black men
are punished for what all
men do. Dworkin also made
connections between anti-
Semitism, racism and violence
against women. She stated,
"The values of the day become
the obsessions of the night."
Night was the time when the
Gestapo in Hitler's Germany
went into the Jewish ghettos -
smashing windows - dragging
people from their homes and
killing them outright or send-
ing them to concentration
camps. As black men are made
into the carriers of danger,
of rape, Hitler made Jewish
men into the carriers of dan-
ger, of rape.
Dworkin then talked about
confinement of women - in the
home, in our clothes - spike
heels, tight skirts, etc. She
called the freedom of move-
ment the most basic freedom.
Dworkin's speech was very
moving, and she made some
good connections. I wish she
had made a few more - like
who are the real carriers of
danger, of rape; who keeps us
confined and who really has
the power. We are economical-
ly, psychically and physi-
cally exploited and violated
by Madison Ave., the Pentagon,
big business, et al, who keep
us firmly in our place.

The march itself was both
stirring and disturbing. I
always feel very powerful and
"up" when I'm marching with a
large number of women, a vast
number of whom are lesbians,
yelling, "Women unite, take
back the night." On the other
hand, it was disturbing to
walk down Colfax and be star-
ing into the sometimes con-
fused, sometimes supportive,
sometimes hostile faces of
"street people," working class
people. Who is the real enemy?
I think we should have been
marching on 17th St. downtown
on a Friday at noon - yelling
at all the bankers and busi-
nesspeople.

Having the cops stopping
traffic for us all along the
way was quite a contradiction.
As Dworkin said, we were there
with permission. Taking back
the night with permission!

Flo Kennedy was the "key-
note" speaker after the march.
She was very witty, but not
exactly what I wanted to hear
after building up a lot of
energy from the march. She
began with the feminist na-
tional anthem, the feminist
battle hymn of the republic
and then the feminist prayer -
all take-offs with feminist
lyrics. Her speech covered a
wide political spectrum, from
"All oppressed people have a
right to violence," and "get
a gun" to "get out and vote,"
"run for office" and "take
over cable TV." Kennedy's ad-
vocacy of "anything goes" kind
of politics leads to scattered
and ineffective organizing, if
not outright dangerous.

After the march, what I
really wanted to hear was wo-
men speaking out on their own
experiences with rape and
violence.

By this time it had begun
to rain, and Kennedy was say-
ing she would cut her speech
short so women could go home
and get out of the rain. It
wasn't until after her speech
that a RAAP spokeswoman came
on stage to say the rally was
not over and would women
please stay for the speakout.
Microphones had been set up
in front of the stage for
women to use. This was confus-

ing, especially since it was
raining and the stage was the
only covered area. Only
"stars" and RAAP women could
use the stage?

The speakout started, not
with a call for women to ex-
press their anger and rage,
but with community announce-
ments. Out of perhaps twelve
women who spoke, only 3 or 4
spoke on what had happened
to them personally. The
speakout really turned into
a community announcement time,
not a time for women to share
their experiences and anger.

I am angry at RAAP's use of
the women's community to gain
credibility for their march.
Flying in Kennedy and Dworkin,
a black woman and a Jewish
woman, both "known" speakers,
at considerable expense, I
guess was supposed to attract
more women, and was part of
their outreach to women of
color and women of other cul-
tures than the dominant white
Christian culture. I think
all the rally time should
have been devoted to women
speaking out on rape and vio-
lence in their lives, not
having that tagged on as an
afterthought.
I am angry at RAAP's opera-

ting a business under the
guise of feminism. The three
white women who are the sal-
aried directors started RAAP
with a certain philosophy,
and even though they accept
a certain amount of input from
canvassers, hotline volunteers
and members of the community,
that philosophy still stands.
They will refer women to ther-
apists, even after struggle
with WPILF and other women
around how this makes rape a
“personal problem," and puts
women at risk of being insti-
tutionalized because of "rape
trauma syndrome." ("Rape trau-
ma syndrome," like “battered
woman syndrome" and “battered
child syndrome," is a thera-
peutic term. It places the
emphasis on the victim, not
on the men who are doing the
violence. It blames the vic-
tim for "her problems" stem-
ming from the violence done
to her.)

RAAP will continue to work
with the police and the
courts, even after struggle
around how police and the le-
gal system (yes, even so-
called liberal judges) only
go after Third World and/or
poor men. Cooperating with
therapists, cops and the
courts is collaborating with
a system which is male-domi-
nated, white supremacist,
money-oriented and psychia-
trized.

RAAP has paid Carolyn Agosta,
a social worker and therapist,
who is co-director of E.V.E.
(Ending Violence Effectively),
$750 a month for consultation.
They will soon be hiring a
full-time counselor to take
over that function. (I assume
at the same $300/wk gross that
the other three directors are
making.) RAAP will also be
hiring a volunteer coordina-
tor. One of these positions
will be filled by a woman of
color. According to Lindblad,
it's not tokenism, even
though this woman will be
joining an already established,
all-white organization: Lind-
blad states that RAAP needs
and wants input from women of
color, and hopes to get bi-
lingual hotline volunteers
soon. But according to a
former RAAP canvasser, both
female and male bilingual
prospective volunteers have
been referred to RAAP. None
were interviewed. RAAP was
also offered 30 minutes on
