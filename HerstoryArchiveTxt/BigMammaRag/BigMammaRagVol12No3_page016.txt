Feminization Of Poverty from page 11

class find themselves in ex-
actly this position. When the
men in two-parent families
leave, the standard of liv-
ing of these families drops,
both because of women's low-
wage status and because of
the vacuum of social supports
available for raising chil-
dren. In the current period
of social austerity, the lo-

wer strata is growing in size
and changing in composition.

New social groups are being
forced to face the bottom-
line realities of US capital-
ism, creating the “new poor."

Among them are the women
caught in the nexus of these

two social trends--the women
for whom poverty has been

"feminized." 
But, before taking pity on

the plight of the “nouveau
poor," it might be useful to
recall that women who thought
that the color line and a
working husband would protect
them from the worst that
capitalism has to offer have
shown no particular concern
for the permanently impover-
ished sectors of the US pop-
ulation. The oppressive
conditions faced by the poor
were acceptable and easily
overlooked, as long as they
mainly affected those people
whose poverty was viewed as
almost a genetic deformity--
the "colored" and "foreigners."
Poverty has been rediscovered
now that increasing numbers
of working-class whites
are in danger of defaulting
on their mortgage to the
"American Dream."

Whether this sector will
establish political unity
with the “old poor" or wheth-
er they will struggle to re-
gain their material privil-
eges remains to be seen.

But there is nothing yet to
indicate that the branch of
American womanhood represented
by Avis will become
the most reliable combatants
in the struggle to defend
the poor against political
and economic attack and to
strike at the class roots of
poverty in the US. The po-
tential for these women to
identify with and fight a-
gainst the conditions suf-
fered by the "old poor" de-
pends entirely upon the ex-
tent to which sharp and
consistent struggle is taken
up against racism and class
oppression.

By the year 2000, all of
the nation's poor will be
women and their dependent
children. (from 1980 Nation-
al Advisory Council on Eco-
nomic Opportunity, cited in
Ms. magazine, July/August
1982, and the Guardian, June
29, 1983.)

This prediction is a fav-
orite in "feminization of

poverty" literature. It
seems to assume that by the
year 2000 all of those men
who are presently poor will
be either rich or dead.
Furthermore, it indicates
that the “feminization of
poverty" perspective not only
provides a distorted view
of women but also leaves men,
minority men in particular,
entirely out of the analysis.

While poverty is intensi-
fied by sexism, women's op-
pression is not its sole or
even fundamental determinant.
The profile of the poor is
incomplete without putting
men back into the picture.
Here again the condition
faced by minority men most
starkly reveals the life
conditions of the lower
strata of the class.

A recent study released
by the Center of Social Po-
licy, based on 1980 Census
data, concluded that the gap
between the average incomes
of whites and Blacks, men
and women, is as wide today

as it was in 1960, in spite
of two decades of civil
rights struggle. In 1981
median income for Black fam-
ilies was 56% of that of
whites, up only 1% since
1960. Black poverty was at-
tributed not only to the in-
crease in the portion of
Black families headed by wo-
men, from 1/5 to nearly 1/2
but also to the rapidly in-
creasing number of jobless
Black men. While 20 years
ago 75% of Black men were
employed, today an astounding
45% of all Black men do not
have jobs. If the 15-20% of
Black men between 20 and 40
years of age who could not
be located by the Census are
added to this figure,
conservative estimates put the
proportion of unemployed
Black men at more than 50%.
Black men also make up almost

half of the prison population. Men who immigrate from Mexi-
co, Central America and the
Caribbean in search of work
hardly fare better. The edu-
cational and employment op-
portunities available to
Puerto Rican, Native Ameri-
can and Mexican-American men
are severely restricted.

Thus for many minority men
the military (poverty draft),
the streets, or prison have
become the only remaining
"career" options open. Those
who do find work are general-
ly at the lower end of the
wage scale in the service
and agricultural sectors of
the economy.

While poor women were
forced into dependence on
Aid to Families with Depend-
ent Children (AFDC) to raise
the kids, it should not be
forgotten that general as-
sistance, which provided
some support for adult men,
was virtually eliminated
some time ago. Other programs
designed to improve the em-
ployment opportunities of
minority men have also got-
ten the axe. It should not
need saying, but the men who
depended on such programs
and services have neither
disappeared nor become
wealthy. In minority commun-
ities poverty has not become
"feminized." Though women
face distinct kinds of dif-
ficulties and hardships, po-
verty is the common condition
of a large portion of these
communities which include
men, women and children. The
"feminization of poverty" a-
nalysis is unlikely to find
many adherents among the wo-
men who inhabit the inner
cities, ghettos, barrios and
reservations of America. For
these women, reality includes
the fact that their male
children will have only a 50/
50 chance of ever finding a
job. It includes the fact
that many of the adult men
of their community have been
driven close to desperation
by the bitter dynamics of
capitalism and racism.

2 out of 3 people in pover-
ty are women. What if we all
went to the polls?" (Slogan,
of the East Bay Women's Coal-
ition).

This slogan now being popu-
larized by feminist organi-
zations aptly sums up the
strategic implications of the
“feminization of poverty"
perspective. Although not e-
veryone attracted to the line
has linked it to a definite
strategy to rebuild the wo-
men's movement, the women who
lead liberal feminist organ-
izations such as NOW and the
National Women's Political
Caucus certainly have. For

poverty" analysis provides

a lever to widen the "gender
gap" (the significantly
greater % of women than of
men supporting Democrats
over Republicans). The issue
of female poverty is seized
upon as an electoral tool to
cohere the Democratic Party's
base of support among women
voters. Of course, it is no
small matter that the US gov-
ernment is currently headed
up by reactionary, anti-wom-
an Republicans, the likes
of Ronald Reagan. Supporting
politicians committed to a
more liberal social program
is certainly in the common
interest of the vast majority
of women. However, there are
serious problems in promoting
the illusion that getting
more Democrats into office
can qualitatively alter, much
less reverse, the trends in
women's oppression, racism
and poverty.

But the liberals of the
feminist movement and of the
Democratic Party cannot be
expected to sort out the com-
plexities of class, race and
sex and to create a program
that focuses on the issues
that most affect working
class women. What is extrem-
ely disturbing, however, is
that some of the most avid
and prolific adherents of the
“feminization of poverty" view
are those feminists who iden-
tify as socialists. In part-
icular, the trend of social
democracy, represented pri-
marily by the DSA, has be-
come a highly active advocate
of this analysis and strat-
egy. One might expect that
socialist feminists and so-
cial democrats would be more
wary about adopting a per-
spective that, in its origins
explicitly drops class and
race out of consideration.
Quite to the contrary, these
particular socialists have
built a political career
wishing that the knotty pro-
blems of race and class that
divide women would simply do
a disappearing act. "Femini-
zation of poverty" as a stra-
tegy provides a new magic
wand--attractive because of
its seeming concern for the
poor and oppressed.

The incidence of women's
oppression and poverty is a
critical question which does
shape the survival of peoples
of color and significant
sectors of the rest of the
US working class. However,
promoting the “feminization
of poverty" as the issue
that can "unite women across
class, race, age, and sexual
preference" is a highly du-
bious enterprise. Feminist
