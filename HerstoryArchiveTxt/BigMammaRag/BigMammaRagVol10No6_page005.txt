over in the corner at the
rally singing "We Shall Not
Be Moved," and I'm sure they
didn't realize that that was
a Black spiritual. So here
are those women crying about
not wanting any religious
overtones, and they're sing-
ing my music real proud and
not knowing that it is a
spiritual. And I was pissed.
That's just a case in point.
People are really ignorant and
they need to examine these
things.

And then the rally was can-
celled and we had a gathering
at someone's house and I
learned that a woman's speech
had been rejected by the ral-
ly committee because she
wanted to talk about Lesbians
in violent relationships.
They told her that there
wasn't enough data on it, and
anyway they wanted this to be
a positive experience. So
here this goes on and people
need to know that, and they
cut her. And I said to myself
that this doesn't make sense.
I mean, speakers dealing with
incest but they wouldn't let
her talk. Maybe they're in
violent relationships them-
selves and don't want to
deal with it, but why keep
the subject away from others
who might benefit from it?
White people, especially
white women, tend to idealize
things. They put together
values and they want to show
just the good side. Or, look
what the men have done to me.
But they don't want to talk
about what the women are do-
ing to themselves and what
women are doing to other
women. They don't want to
talk about that. It's very
lopsided. And I'm saying,
"Hey, this is how it is; one
hand washes the other. If you
want to talk about what men
are doing to women, let's
also look at what women are
doing to women. If you're
going to talk about what the
white men are doing to
minorities, let's talk about
what white women are doing to
minorities also. Because
there's a lot of discrepancies
here.”

Another group of women want-
ed to do something on South
Africa--Black women--and they
were cut because their message
was too redundant to the
thing about oppression. I say,
"Oh wow, let's alter history

Page 6 ~ Big Mama Rag, June, 1982

to fit our views now:" I
mean, what that committee did
in censoring these women—and
I do say censoring—is the
same thing that their white
male counterparts did in
altering history and leaving
out Native Americans and
leaving out Blacks and Jews
and what have you.

Eleanor: Some of the women

from WAVAW realized what was
happening and read out a

-Artist unknown

statement apologizing to wo-
men of color. But others did
not agree with that statement.
Kim: No, in fact, they re-
signed and they handed out

a disclaimer statement at the
rally and after reading the
statement, I realized I had
given them more credit for
intelligence than they war-
ranted. I mean, these women
that had censored so much
during the rally were saying
that they were being falsely
accused, and it wasn't that
they were censoring, they
were just trying to pick the
items that most exemplified
minority oppression. I say,
bullshit, they as white women
were going to make this
decision, there wasn't a
dark face on that whole rally
committee, so they're

going to take it upon them-
selves, they're going to call
themselves the great "Goddess,”
and they're going to tell
you what best tells my
story.

I said, “I'm sorry, these
people need some help." I
read this disclaimer and I
had to laugh to keep from
going up to one of them, I
had to laugh to release that
tension. I mean, these are

the same ignorant people
running America and wondering
why minority people riot and
burn cities. I mean, if

you have to burn down a city
to show that there are
problems, you're dealing with
some ignorant folks.

And it was fine for people
to make that apology, but
people out in the audience
didn't know what was going
down. And if they had taken
out five, ten, fifteen min-
utes from the rally to ex-
plain what had gone down,
that apology would have made
a difference. And the people
that that apology was meant
for, outside of myself,
weren't even there. They did-
n't even hear that apology.
People were sitting there
saying, “What are they apolo-
gizing for, I don't under-
stand." But I am floored that
there were so many people on
this committee and they gave
all the power to a small
group of women and let them
make the decisions. And then
when they didn't necessarily
care for the decision, they
didn't speak up, they didn't
speak up until I made a
ruckus about my thoughts. And
then they sort of faced it,
but, hey, that's too late,
that's like closing the gate
after the horse has escaped.
If you're going to let your-
self go on and not say any-
thing, you're just as guilty.
Eleanor: So how was it for
you participating in the
rally after all of this?

Kim: I participated in the
rally because of the people I
worked with and their contri-
bution, because there were a
lot of people involved, not
just the singers, but a conga
drum player and dancers and
lots of people who had spent
time researching and putting
the narration together. I

was doing it for them because
they had already put in a

lot of time before I came,
into it, and I was not going
to take that away from them.
But afterward I listened to a
couple of other speakers and
then just left. I just didn't
feel good about participating,
about marching even. And I
doubt if I will be partici-
pating in it next year or

any year after. Unless the
women's community does a real
about-face. I mean, there was
a Black woman from the Circle

of Ishtar (a group of Lesbians
of color who meet in the Twin
Cities area--ed.) who tried to
get on the committee, and
they never got back to her,
and she just got tired and
gave up. So it's one of those
things, I'm sure a lot of
white women would be too
intimidated to be on a commit-
tee with more than two
minority women. I mean, I've
seen so many times people

who will tell you how lib- -
eral they are, go through

some real changes when there's
more than a couple minority
people on the committee.

They really think we're clos-
ing in on them.

I know the Circle of Ishtar
has been asked by the Coffee-
house to do a forum on racism
and they have adamantly said
no, because this has been
done before, and it just turns
into a shouting match with
white women feeling guilty
and getting defensive. I have
to say that I seldom frequent
the Coffeehouse myself, because
I just don't feel welcome
there. In the beginning, not
that many Black women went
there, in fact, I often would
be the only one, and now that
more Black and Native American
women are going there, I've
noticed a real change.

And there's been an issue
about the music there. Black
women will go up and make
requests and the requests
aren't played, and white
women will go up and make a
request and it's put on just
like that. So there's a cul-
tural thing that needs to be
balanced out. I don't like
a lot of white music, what
can I say, I don't like rock
and roll. And I have to say
that most of the Black music
that is played is danceable
music, you can dance to it.
But when they put on the punk
rock music, it's real strange
to me. I wish that they would
play more Black music. I
would probably frequent there
more. As it is, if I want to
go dancing I'll go to the
Townhouse (a local bar) be-
cause I know they'll play
decent music. And there's not
going to be a power trip
about how many Black songs
and how many white songs. That
has gotten brought up time
and time again at Circle of
Ishtar meetings that they don't
