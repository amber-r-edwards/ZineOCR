"ARMY SISTERHOOD? ~~

Do you wonder if Lesbians
and women in general possess
Sisterhood in the Women's Army
Corps? Well, you can stop
wondering; they don't. There
may be a few individuals here
and there, mostly there, but
the general view presents
back-stabbing and "save-your-
own-ass" attitudes. Most of
the women in the Army are
Lesbians, not all of them
though. This majority consists
of many career women and most
definitely "lifers." The rest
are young women entering the
service right out of high
school or college. Many are
already gay when they enter
but many women are brought out
after entering. The big, bad,
sexual perversion a woman
heard about from her parents
and friends before joining,
suddenly becomes very natural
and she discovers there are
other women that feel just
like her. So, she lets it all
hang out, and acts naturally;
acts the way she would have
before society's blind, narrow
minded claws sank into her
and brainwashed her. However,
the Army isn't the ideal place
for one to discover herself.

The Army considers homo—
sexuality a sexual perversion,
and proof of one's sexual
practice in this field can
lead to an undesirable dis-
charge. However, in an almost
heroic attempt to protect its
best workers, it has made it
more difficult to be boarded
out on this charge. In the
past, it took only a pen in a
gossip's hand to ruin a woman's
career, or present job. Now,
pictures, witnesses, and
statements must be presented
before a board of officers
will even be staffed. The reasoning
behind this change could have
been motivated by any of the
following: 1) A gossip or busy-
body could ruin an innocent
woman's career because of her
dislike for her or jealousy.

2) Women, heterosexual or homo-
sexual, could sign themselves
out as a lesbian if they were
sick of the Army. 3) And fin-
ally, because of a confidential
survey, the Army has discovered
its most efficient workers
are usually gay.

In any event, the gay women
in the Army aren't the best
Sisters, (and I use the term
‘sisters' lightly).

For instance, a woman of
rank will unveil her sister of
lower rank to make herself
look good, or "straight." This
usually doesn't happen right
out of thin air. The woman of
lower rank may be suspected
and with a little help from
her "friends," the action can
be completed. This also hap-
pens frequently between women
of equal rank and not always
involves sexuality. So you
see, you're never really safe.
Often, a gay orderly room
(administrative personnel),
will "hang" someone if they
don't like her, feel she knows
too much about them, or a
"make tentative plans."

If they have
enough evidence to get her
discharged, they can usually
transfer them to another unit
under a trouble-maker label, or
at the least, just plain cause
her a lot of hell and hassle.
When they do this,
often hoping for a breaking
point. Not all orderly rooms
are this way, nor all WACS.
But, I'm only striving to let
the rust show besides the shin-
ing silver.

I heard a rumor before I
was discharged, that the Army
may legalize homosexuality
because of the survey
mentioned above.

Will this change
the sisterhood scene?
I certainly hope so!

JOMANNING THE BOOTH-- I am at the
Lesbian Center booth during the
Women's Festival which was soon-
sponsored by L.O.O.W. in August.

The Denver Lesbian Cen-
ter has been considering the
possibility of a regional
conference sometime this
year. We have heard of les-
bian groups in Boulder, Ft.
Collins, Colorado Springs,
Manitou Springs and Albuquer-
que; and we suspect there may
be others.

One idea we have dis-
cussed is that of a planning
session during Thanksgiving
weekend. This would be a
time for representatives from
each interested group to set
together, share ideas, and
make tentative plans. These
plans could then be taken
back to the local groups and
revised as necessary. Hope-
fully we can avoid at least
some of the tensions that
seem to come with conferen-
ces.

If you are interested,
please let us know. We are
at 1895 Lafayette
Denver, CO
(505) 573-6604.

Dear Aggie,

I am a 27-year-old
However, I find
I have been attracted to a
society.

Dear Aggie,

I understand that due to
weird and abnormal sex
practices, many Lesbians
are really true?
A Reader From Chicago

Dear Aggie,

In my class of sex
ual perversion, our teacher
told us that one queer can
tell another a mile away.

Being a lesbian I've tried
making passes on other women
who I thought were dykes.

So far all I've gotten is
kicked, slapped in the face,
and arrested. Could my prof
be wrong?

Leslie Gay

Dear Les,

No, your prof isn't wrong.
Our society is now suffering
from a bad case of "closetism."
Many women do not want their
sexual identity revealed,
like your mother for instance.
