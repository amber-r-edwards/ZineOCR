“Women in the People’s  
Republic of China have achieved  
social, economic, and political  
equality with men," said Ms.  
Susan Klonsky, who recently  
headed the American Women’s  
Friendship Delegation to that  
country.

At a free public meeting on  
March 14, at the University of  
Colorado (Denver Center) Ms.  
Klonsky presented  
approximately 100 slides  
concerning the changes which  
have taken place for Chinese  

women since the socialist  
revolution in 1949.  
Just one generation ago  

women there were practically  
slaves in their families, had no  
legal rights, were sold into  
prostitution, and had their feet  
bound not for beautification, but  
to keep them from running  
away from their masters.

The purpose of Ms. Klonsky’s  
delegation, which consisted of  
about 14 women ranging in  
political persuasions from the  
National Organization of  
Women to the October League,  
was to “investigate changes in  
the lives of people—especially  
women—since the socialist  
revolution.”

Hold Leading Positions

“Women in China,” stated Ms.  
Klonsky, “have progressed from  
having practically no power  
whatever to holding leading  
positions in government,  
industry, education, and cultural  

Sex Assault

Carolyn Agosta

“The problem of sexual  
assault is one which affects  
us all, no matter what our  
age, race, or life-style might  
be. Sexual assault is not  
limited to the rape of young  
women, but includes attacks  
on infants as well as senior  
citizens." (From handout at  
Conference on Sexual  
Assault in Denver.) Two hun-  
dred and fifty persons  
gathered at the United Way  
Building on March 2 to gain  
an awareness of the crime  
and problems related to rape,  
to take action towards  
prevention and to develop  
programs of treatment for  
both victims and their  
offenders.

“Just Lost a Screw”

The morning of the con-  
ference was spent in  
educating the group about  
the problems of rape and the  
attitudes of judge, jury,  
prosecutors and police  
toward the victim. A clinical  
psychologist who works with  
rape victims, Dr. Hannah  
Evans stated, “A jury is very  
reluctant to convict a rapist.  
The jury figures that all the  
woman lost was a screw so  
why should a guy go to jail for  
10 years for that?” The at-  
titude is that it takes two  

from white lung  

institutions.”  
Chinese women are not only  

employed in almost every  
conceivable job position  
(doctors, welders, farmers,  

industrial mechanics, etc.), they  
also have control along with  
male workers to organize and  
oversee their jobs. One factory  
employing mostly women even  
shut down production for a year  
while the women there designed  
a way to protect themselves  
(a disease  
common to U.S. mill workers).

“Institutions in China today,”  
explained Ms. Klonsky, “are  
geared to serve the people rather  
than to make profits.”  
(Complete health coverage, for  

example, may be purchased for  

as little as a dollar a year.)

Today there are only about  
four kinds of jobs which Chinese  
women are not permitted to do  
and these include coal mining,  
operating heavy equipment, and  
being exposed to temperature  
extremes. “The reason for these  
restrictions,” explained Ms.  
Klonsky, “is that there is a great  
emphasis on family life and it is  
feared that such jobs might  
possibly damage women’s  
reproductive organs.”

Not Pressured To Marry  
The pressure to marry, however,  
has been taken off Chinese  
women today by making full  
employment available. Abortion  
is free on demand and child care  
centers are provided all over the  

country. Divorce is also free and  
there is no alimony to pay, but  
couples wishing to end their  
marriage usually go before a  
kind of criticism committee first  
(composed of townspeople) to  
help decide if the marriage can  
be saved.  
Women Martyrs  

Women in China are not only  
actively engaged in running the  
country today, they also played  
a large part in overthrowing the  
old system which enslaved them.  
They fought alone and with men  
in the Red Army and there are  
many pictures on display in  

Conference Held  

consenting adults for inter-  
course to occur.

The conference was split  
into four groups in the after-  
noon: counselling, health  
care, education, and legisla-  
tion.

The education group dis-  
cussed a mass media cam-  
paign to begin around April  
19. People from Denver Un-  
iversity will be making  
posters, pamphlets and other  
materials will be printed.  
There will be a speakers  
bureau set up in which  
research will be done, a  
slide-show will be made and  
people will learn to speak in  
front of a group.

The persons in health  
care agreed to develop an ad-  
vocacy program whereby a  
woman could be “on call”—  
when a woman is raped, the  
woman on call will go to the  
hospital to give emotional  
support to the victim.

Use Sexuality  

In the legislative group,  
the top priority was changing  
the prior chastity rule. At pre-  
sent, the victim's past sexual  
experiences can be used  
against her in an open court;  
whereas, the activities of the  
accused cannot be  
presented.

In the counselling area,  

the group decided to es-  
tablish a crisis center to coor-  
dinate health care services  
including counselling, court  
procedures and police. Also  
to keep the woman informed  
of her case.

The conference is only  
the beginning. The coalition  
has hopes of sponsoring  
more of these in different  
parts of the city as part of the  
educational area. All of this,  
of course, is going to take  
knowledge, concern and a lot  
of hard work, especially on  
the part of women.

Anyone interested in  
working with the Coalition or  
in more information, please  
call Dr. Katherine Saltzman  
or Julie Stark at 321-8192.  
Also, if you have been raped  
and would like to talk to  
someone call 321-8191  
(between the hours of 9 a.m.  
and 9 p.m.).

Editor's comment: In addi-  
tion to the measures taken  
concerning rape discussed  
by this conference, we think  
just as much emphasis  
should be placed on  
establishing and en-  
couraging self-defense  
courses for women. An  
ounce of real prevention...

China honoring women martyrs.  
Today there is much emphasis  
on equal physical training for  
both girls and boys and both  
women and men receive training  
in the People’s Militia.

Added Ms. Klonsky, “the U.S.  
military maintains  
women to repair its uniforms,  
but in China the men must do  
this task themselves."

Lesbians in China  
After the slide presentation  
Ms. Klonsky answered questions  
from the audience concerning  
her talk. One woman asked  
about the condition of lesbians  

STEREOTYPES  

14,000  

in China. Ms. Klonsky explained  
that although lesbians were not  
persecuted outright or sent to  
institutions to become  
heterosexually-oriented, their  
sexual preference was looked  
upon as a “political deviation  
because of the emphasis on  
family structures.”

A man expressed his opinion  
that “there shouldn't be any  
question of male chauvinism in  
China because women had  
always been taught to respect  
and obey the men.”

To this utter tripe Ms.  
Klonsky said, “Well, I can think  
of about 400 million Chinese  
women who would very much  
disagree with you!”

Stereotyping Conf.  
Big Disappointment  

Randi Lornelli  

One of the problems of  
any mass movement are the  
inevitable differences in  
stages of consciousness.  
While some women are well  
along the way of developing  
totally new lifestyles, others  
are just beginning to wonder  
if maybe hubby shouldn't  
pick up his own clothes in-  
stead of leaving them where  
they fell.

Unfortunately, the Con-  
ference on Stereotyping in  
Education, held at Colorado  
Women’s College on March  
1, seemed to be aimed at  

those people who are getting  
the first faint glimmers that,  
(sexual, ethnic, religious)  
stereotyping does exist.  
Perhaps they found the con-  
ference enlightening but  
anyone who already had  
some awareness was bound  
to be bored. Who really needs  
to be told that girls are taught  
to please men rather than  
themselves?

The conference ran into  
problems from the begin-  
ning. Pre-registered par-  
ticipants had to wait as long  
as forty-five minutes to pick
