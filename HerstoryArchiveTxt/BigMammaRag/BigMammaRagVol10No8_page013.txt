Apartheid Tries To Destroy Black Families

without much help or sympathy
from the members of the fam-
ily she did not consult be-
fore taking the baby to the
hospital. To meet the expense
she might have to borrow
some money which the husband
may refuse to pay when he
hears that his wife failed
to obey the orders of his
community. Not only would
she be blamed for disobey-
ing the unwritten laws but
also for the subsequent death
of her child. There will al-
ways be people who are wise
after the event whose com-
ments will be "she should
never have taken the baby to
hospital when it was so ill,
unless she wanted it to die
of course. Maybe that is why
she did not even tell her
parents-in-law. Maybe it is
not the husband's baby.'
From the mother's point of
view, when she knows from
other women's experiences,
the risk is not worth taking.

"But what can I do? I can-
not change the system?"

‘Perhaps not but we can
start by treating this baby
now, here in the clinic. By
10 in the evening we shall
have given enough water
through the vein and at least
four doses of antibiotic to
see the baby through the
night. We can take both moth-
er and child home in our am-
bulance. If the baby shows
signs of improvement the
mother will bring him back
tomorrow. All we need to do
is to borrow the necessary
equipment for the treatment
from the hospital and if the
treatment works we can start
ordering our own stuff. Once
mothers have confidence in
the treatment they will not
hesitate to bring in their
children. They may even agree
to leave them overnight. If
they choose to they could stay
here or come at 10 in the
morning, spend 4 hours with
their babies and take the bus
back home at 2 pm.

‘The hospital we had talked
about was 45 miles away and
had no facilities for mothers.
Transport to and from the
town in which the hospital is
situated is very poor. To vi-
sit a mother has to leave
home at 5 am and will not get
back home until afternoon the
following day and all that
for half an hour's visit.

‘Alright," the doctor said
slowly. "I'll ring the hospi-
tal. Could you please ask

the ambulance driver to go

to the outpatient department?
I'll borrow all the equipment
from there. Meanwhile we
could start with the antibio-
tic treatment."

After giving the message to
the driver, I came back and
sat by the mother. I explain-
ed in Zulu, "The doctor will
try and treat the baby here.
I will just give the baby his
medicine first and I will
discuss the arrangements with
you."

As the baby swallowed his
first dose, he gave a little
cough and the mother's ex-
pression lost its hopeless-

ness, "My baby, he is get-
ting better already."

He did get better. By the
time I left the clinic we
were giving similar treat-
ment to many more babies.
Although it still maintains

the title of clinic it is in
effect a cottage hospital.
One tiny change. But the
basic cause of that baby's
starvation remains and will
until apartheid is destroyed.

AN EXPLANATION- AND SOME
ESSENTIAL INFORMATION
ABOUT SOUTH AFRICA FROM
HILDA BERSTEIN'S FOR THEIR
TRIUMPHS AND FOR THEIR
TEARS

The language of apartheid
is a totally necessary part
of its ideology. Without

language.

For example, apartheid
speaks of South Africa as
being divided into White
areas and Homelands. The
White areas are more than 87
percent of the total country,
while the Homelands are less
than 13 percent, mostly
scattered areas which are not
even consolidated into the
nine designated Homelands.

This is historically a lie
-- the demarcation is some-
thing imposed by White govern-
ment -- and factually non-
sense, since the majority of
black people actually reside
in ‘white’ areas. But these
are terms used by government
spokesmen, and in fact must
be used when quoting from
them; so that eventually some
people have come to accept

the idea that 70 percent of
South Africans are entitled
to live in only 13 percent of
the land area -- their 'home-
lands.’ On the other hand,

it can be cumbersome always
to condition these terms by
using quotation marks, or
prefacing them with 'so-
called.'

Apartheid has also develop-
ed words and phrases that
have meaning only within the
context of apartheid -- for
example, 'Bantu,’ or 'Separ-
ate development,' or 'Endors-
ed out.’

What follows here is a
brief explanation of some of
the apartheid language.
HOMELANDS, BANTUSTANS, RE-
SERVES: These all refer to
the areas that successive
white governments have des-
ignated for occupation by
the Africans. Reserves was
used in the past, and today
has more accuracy inasmuch
as these areas have become
reserves of cheap labor.
Homeland is the official
term, reflecting the inten-
tion of the white government.
Bantustans originated as a
satirical term, and is gen-
erally used by opponents of
apartheid. In 1961 Dr. Verwo-
erd, then Prime Minister of
South Africa, frankly stated
that ‘in the light of the
pressure being exerted on
South Africa’ the government
would introduce new Bantu
states, 'a form of fragmen-
tation which we would not
have liked if we were able
to avoid it, thereby buying
the white man his freedom
and the right to retain dom-
ination in what is his coun-
try.'

SEPARATE DEVELOPMENT: This
is the preferred official
term for apartheid. It is
intended to emphasize the
idea that racial separation
is based on separate devel-
opment, and to avoid the un-
pleasant ideas associated
with the term apartheid.
BLACKS, BANTUS, AFRICANS:
Bantu has been the official
term used for Africans, who
dislike it as being inaccurate
and offensive. Black
covers three racial groups,
that is, Africans, Asians
and Coloured (the term used
in South Africa for people
of mixed white and black ex-
traction) and, as well as
being adopted by the black
