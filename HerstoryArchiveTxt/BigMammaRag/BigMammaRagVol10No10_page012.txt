government and demanding rep-
arations and just payback for
centuries of colonial exploi-
tation which continues to
this day. The National Commi-
ttee To Build the Internation-
al Tribunal on Reparations
for Black People in the U.S.
also includes the Columbian
Front for Socialism (FECOPES)
North American (white) soli-
darity forces like the Commi-
ttee in Solidarity with Af-
rican Independence and other
supporting members and indi-
viduals.

I am a North American les-
bian woman working in solid-
arity. The North Americans
working on the committee see
supporting this campaign
concretely and giving mater-
ial solidarity to the liber-
ation struggle of U.S. born
African people as the strong-
est and most direct way to
challenge the U.S. govern-
ment and “fight racism." When
you think about what it
means to "struggle against
racism", it involves not only
confronting racist condition-
ing, but also giving support
to colonized people as they
struggle for justice.

The U.S. and Europe got
rich by stealing African peo-
ple from their own land and
their own civilization. Afri-
cans were loaded onto slave
ships under such conditions
of over-crowding that mil-
lions did not survive the
Atlantic Passage. Those who
did survive were first taken
to the Caribbean, West Ind-
ian Islands where they were
tortured, forbidden by fear
of death to speak their own
languages, and separated
from their families, in order
to transform them from free
people into slaves. African
civilization had highly de-
veloped skill in agriculture
and metal arts. African peo-
ple did all that work which
grew and processed the to-
bacco and cotton and other
crops from which the white
ruling class made their for-
tunes. They also cleared the
land, built the roads and
the houses, and ran the ma-
chinery. African slaves,
brutalized, overworked to ex-
haustion, stripped of their
African cultures, did the
work that built America for
the ruling class capitalists

and brought the profits from
which industrialization and

imperialism expanded.

Slavery for African peo-
ple did not end with the
Civil War. They are still a
colonized people, still left
with the hardest, lowest pay-

ing jobs. African women die
in childbirth three times as
often as white women.

Not only were the people
of Africa stolen, but also
the natural resources of the
land were stolen (and are
still being stolen). The rul-
ing classes of Europe and the
U.S. "discovered" gunpowder
from the Chinese and devel-
oped guns and cannons which
they used to take over the
lands of Africa, Asia, North
America and South America as
their own private colonies.
Most of the wealth of the
land of Africa, like gold,
silver, diamonds, rubber, oil,
iron, bauxite, tin, palm pro-
ducts (used in soaps and many
other products), cocoa, and
copper, had been stolen.
European and U.S. industrial-
ists got rich off the people
of other lands and developed
an ideology of racism to jus-
tify the plunder and looting.

The African People's So-
cialist Party is collecting
testimony from Africans
throughout the country. This
testimony will be presented
at the World Tribunal in New
York City in November and
will be a documentation of the
condition of existence of
African people within the U.S.
The Demand for Reparations
Now will be taken to the U.S.
government, to the United
Nations, and to the World
Court.

The APSP publishes a month-
ly newspaper called the Burn-
ing Spear. The following
quotes are excerpted from a
December, 1981, article a-
bout the reparations:

"Food stamps, hell! We
want everything that is owed
to us. Reagan's food stamp plan
is just a spit in the face of
the people who created the
wealth of the U.S., the peo-
ple who planted and hoed to
grow the food. Now he has the
obscene arrogance to tell us
to beg for a bit of that
food, to sign up for South
Africa-type I.D. cards with
photos and other ‘pertinent
information' designed to con-
trol our exploding African
communities.

"And the story is not one
of chattel slavery only. For
after the Civil War our peo-
ple were driven back to
slavery, in the peonage sys-
tem of the South and the in-
dustrial hell-holes of the
North, where to this day we

are paid 57¢ to each $1 paid
to North American workers.
"It adds up and, sorry to
say for Ronnie, we don't for-
get what has happened; it is

not ancient history but the
basis of our present condi-
tion of poverty and the basis
of his present condition of
opulence.

“Our people are not beg-
ging for crumbs. We stand
tall with dignity, and de-
mand Reparations Now!"

A lot of money must be
raised to fund the Repara-
tions Campaign and the Tri-
bunal. It is the extremely
wealthy, the ruling class
who owns most of the stolen
wealth, but all along white
people have been given crumbs
from the colonialist table
in order to buy loyalty to
imperialism. Supporting col-
onized people's struggles
means supporting them with
money and/or work. Even those
of us who are working class
and poor and North American
have a lot more access to
money than most colonized
people. Contributions add up.
Please send what you can af-
ford to the Uhuru House at
7622 MacArthur Blvd., Oakland,
CA 94605. If you are inter-
ested in working on the Rep-
arations campaign or giving
the slide show, get in touch

Open Letter About
“Sisters United”

Dear Sisters:

You may be aware of my
lesbian short stories and
poetry over the years; they
have appeared in numerous
women's magazines and news-
letters. You may also be
aware, but perhaps not, of
my book innocence/experience
that was released in June,
1981 by Women Prints Press.
It is about my book, and
about Woman Prints, that I
feel I must write at this
time.

When in 1980, Sisters
United's "Invitation to
Black Sisters" article of
August, 1981 that I began to
realize just what was being
said. I finally began to
look closer at the magazine,
and finally began to realize
that it was not a religion
of women's love that was
being set in front of me. S.
Diane Bogus withdrew her
pending publication from
Woman Prints, but my own book
had already been released.
Letters were sent to many

~Val Vaughan

women's magazines asking for
a boycott of Sisters United
and of anyone who dealt with
them, on the grounds of the
magazine's racism, sexism,
and antisemitism. I am a
Jewish lesbian.

My own book had already
been released; I had a con-
tract with Sisters United
for innocence/experience,
and Sisters United/Woman
Prints was holding 500 copies
of my only/first book. They
are still holding approxi-
mately 300 of them. I wrote
my own, private, letter of
censure to the editors of
Sisters United, but with the
obligations I was under,
felt that there was no more
I could do.

I do not and have never
held the religious persuas-
ions of Sisters United. I do
not and have never held the
racist, sexist, or anti-
semitic ideas of "Invitation
to Black Sisters" or of any
other such horror. Anyone
who is familiar with my
writing will be aware that
there is no conscious racism
in it, no attempt to hurt any-
one in any way. My only
"anti" is of the male establ-
ishment patriarchy. Yet my
name has been linked in
"guilt by association" with
the leanings of Sisters
United --not because anything
I have ever said or written
deserves it--but simply be-
cause my book was published
by Woman Prints. Book sales
stopped long ago.

I am writing this letter
to tell what few women who
have believed in my "guilt"
that I am not guilty. Nor
is innocence/experience
guilty. Nor is anything I
have ever, or hopefully will
ever. It is vital for me to
tell you this, because my
writing is a vehicle to speak
for the women's community.
It is a valuable vehicle for
the community. And it is also
my life.
