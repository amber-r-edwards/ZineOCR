a haven

Janet Sergi

One thing about class, that is painful but is important, is
that each woman is but one man away from the bottom of the
heap. Women derive their economic and social status from their
closest male relative, i.e. father, husband, or brother, in a
patriarchal society.

Any privilege a woman receives comes from her male
guardian. He may be the benevolent father that sends her to
college to learn middle-class values/actions, or he may be the
dictatorial husband that beats and keeps her because he brings
home a paycheck.

The way we think, act, dress and talk are all products of our
class backgrounds. There are no originals. There are only origins:
We must accept the responsibilities of our pasts, to change our
futures. Look at your friends. If you are college educated and
middle-class, lo and behold, so are your charming and clever
friends. Narcissism reigns supreme. If you worked your way
through school, I bet your friends are honest, hard-working, no
bullshit types. Since each tends to think their way is the way, we
women tend to laugh, disregard and belittle other women of
different ethnic, social or class backgrounds.

The patriarchy, the white men in power, love this horizontal
hostility. If women, who are despised by men, despise, gossip
and effectively destroy each other too, then the patriarchy has NO
enemies. To think of acting in a way that makes another woman feel
inferior to yourself helps men control both women. As long as we
keep each other down, we avoid overthrowing the real enemy,
white ruling-class men. Classist ideas are men’s hateful
classifications of all people other than themselves. Men think if
they can classify people as inferior, the people themselves will
believe this propaganda and begin to hate the person just below
them in the male hierarchy of things. “Keep the hens pecking at
each other. And keep the chicks off my back,” are the basic sexist
and classist axioms of the male strategy to divide and conquer
women.

So when we women begin to examine how we oppress
working-class women, what we are really doing is beginning to
examine how deeply the patriarchy has brainwashed us into
hating other women.

Only through a deep and honest probing of our thoughts,
actions and beliefs, can we begin to create honest and loving
relationships with each other. This love that transcends our
patriarchal pasts is the basis for a woman's place, that place in
ourselves, that is truly ourselves; the woman space, the place
where our woman soul resides.

Kathleen Richardson
Special Agent
Lincoln National Life Insurance Company

Being single, 23 and a professional life insurance agent I am
in a unique position to see where the lack of a good estate
planning program has caused unnecessary financial hardships,
deterioration of lifestyles and at times separated families. I have
been with Lincoln National Life Insurance Company long enough
to realize that only a very small number of people have a thorough
knowledge about what insurance really is.

I am going to be writing a series of articles for BIG MAMA
RAG to make you more aware of why a good insurance program is
essential and ways insurance can be to your benefit if you live, die
or quit.

Since the majority of you are single, my articles will deal
with the needs of singles. However, I will also include information
dealing with children and husbands as statistics say that they will
be a part of our lives at one time or another.

The articles in the coming months will be covering income
protection, estate planning, maintaining independence, retire-
ment income for yourself, trusts, endowments, hospitalization
coverage and special circumstances caused by marriage, divorce
and children.

These articles will be of interest to you in that most of them
deal with possible situations that can occur and the outcome if
you have or have not taken precautions against unfortunate
occurrences.

Good qualified insurance agents can inform you of various
situations that commonly occur and ways in which you can
protect yourself and those around you.

My first column next month will be concerned with income
protection for the single female and the importance of it with or
without children.

Working Woman’s Account...

and keep me from feeling like
a whole person:

1. There is an assumption
about the ready availability of
money that is just not true for
working-class women. This
assumption extends itself in
many ways. For example, I
bitterly resent being criticized
for working just to earn
money. Middle-class people
often seem to think that the
only good reason to have a job
is if that job has some
redeeming social value. They
don’t seem to understand that
for me, there is only one
choice: to earn a living any
way I can. Earning money is
not a luxury: it's a necessity
for me. Working-class people
do not have the privilege of
choosing what kind of work
they do: they have to sell their
labor to survive. Middle-class
women have little sensitivity
to my survival problems and
necessities, and very little
awareness of their overriding
intensity and importance to
me.

This also extends to my
hatred of middle-class con-
cern with physical appearance
and dress. I am too busy
earning a living and building
toward a feminist world to
care about those things; they
are not survival priorities. Any
spare money I may happen to
have, I recycle to the feminist
community. Appearance and
dress are at the bottom of the
list, and I get very angry when
other women show by their
attitude or to my face, even,
that they are not impressed by
me because of what I wear or
how I look to them. If my
hands are dirty, it’s because I
have been working hard, and
there is no shame in that. I
resent their clean hands that
help no one and are most
often used to shut doors in my
face. I do happen to like nice
clothes, but I resent the
implication that this is, first of
all, easily available to me, and
second, that I should wear
nice clothes, or that there is
something wrong with me if I
don't.

2. I also resent the frequent
use of rhetoric by middle-class
women. Communicating is
very hard, because I relate
best to plain, straightforward
talk, and I hate women not
saying what they really mean.
That is a male trick that
women have fallen for, and
another form of lying. I’m tired
of assumptions, implications,
and big words that mask gut
feelings. I object to middle-
class mindfuck games that
always avoid the real issues.

This kind of dishonest
communication involves so-
cial skills I never learned, even
though I went to college, and
it leaves me out of their world
in a very significant way. It is
another way of excluding me,
avoiding me, and putting me
down, and I resent it.

3. I hate pseudoliberalism
in the middle class. It is a
posture that breeds the
indiscriminate using of people
for what you can get out of
them. Liberalism is the
privilege of the middle class,
because it is a choice they can
make freely and they do not
have to back up their choices
because they have the power
not to if they choose that.
Radicalism and anarchy are
the only prerogatives of the
working class, that and
revolution. I'm tired of middle
class women agreeing that I
have not had the same
advantages they've had and
how it really is a shame what
society does to us, and then
turning around and using
those same advantages against
me (like communication
skills).

4. Middle-class attitudes
breed insensitivity to pain in
others, the tendency to ignore
hassles instead of confronting
them, an unwillingness to
listen, and definite resistance
to change. (How will anything
ever change this way?) If a
middle-class woman can't feel
my pain, she won’t confront
me hassling her, she won't
listen to me when I tell her
how she is fucking me over,
and she damn well won’t give
up one single precious previ-
lege to change.

5. Many middle-class
women have immature atti-
tudes toward personal re-
sponsibility and accountabili-
ty to others. She has a
security and independence
the working-class woman
doesn’t have. Middle-class
women are not open to giving,
whether it’s money (especially
that), friendship, love, or
concern. The middle class is
definitely out to hold on to
what it’s got, even if that
means fucking people over in
the process, and I can’t stand
that.

Any time I have ever really
needed help, it has almost
always been a working-class
woman who has held out her
hand and given me money out
of her working-woman's
pocket, who has taken my
tears gently into the pain of
her own heart, who has led me
fearlessly back to where I
needed to be. What I want to
know is, middle-class women,
WHERE THE HELL WERE
YOU when I was down and
out, you in your houses with
your bank accounts and your
precious privileges?

Women in the feminist
movement are still using the
male privileges of money and
power to put me down, ignore
me, or use me, and I’m sick
and tired of my anger and
frustration being dismissed as
silly, unnecessary or unim-
portant, when the real prob-
lem is that these same women
are perpetuating the worst
evils of the patriarchy by
holding on to those same
privileges that oppress us all
as women. They refuse to
criticize themselves or accept
the fact that THEY are as
much an oppressor as any
man.

A lot of middle-class
women, too, aren’t aware of
what they’re doing. They have
to be TAUGHT not to oppress,
not to perpetuate a system full
of privileges for the few and
out of reach of many,
TAUGHT not to unconsciously
(and probably unwillingly)
serve the patriarchy which is
destroying us.

Any time another woman
puts me down because I am
not knowledgeable, inarticu-
late, indecisive, ill-at-ease,
angry, or worse, because I
have nothing to offer, she
becomes my enemy. She joins
with the patriarchy in oppos-
ing my right to speak, to
learn, to interact, to contri-
bute, to be. She opposes my
working woman's valid pain,
and that is a position I can
only attack in her until she can
meet me, with love, on equal
ground, openly, wanting
nothing.
I refuse to listen to her

classist demands until she
has recognized that mine are

waited too long. Then --
maybe then -- we can work
together at last. And that is
what has to happen.

Nobody can undo what has
been done. But every feminist
has an overriding obligation to
herself and to her sisters to
thoroughly examine her own
class background and start
getting rid of things in her
head that The Man has put
there and to replace it with
love, respect, and concern for
ALL women.

I still do not personally have
money or power, but I have
words -- and love. I give both
to this struggle, that we may
all arise brave and free and
strong. Working-class women
must unite in solidarity
against their oppression, and
all other women must listen to
our cry. We now demand it, on
the pain of our entire lives.

make front-page headlines for
raising a family of 12, but a
woman lawyer who promotes
a day care center does.

In the process of the
deification of the system, we
commit ourselves to whatever
values that system wants to
lay on us.

14. Stepping out of our
roles and abandoning a
middle-class value system is
the same as committing a
societal crime--when we won't
do what we’re “supposed” to
do, we shake up the order of
things as they are. We
threaten the Almighty Sys-
tem. This is why radicals are

frightening, and radical les-
bians are twice as frightening,

because they are defying the
value system of society twice

over.
