Anti-Obscenity Laws Nullified

Courts Give

Carol Lease

In early January the Colorado  
State Supreme Court nullified  
state and local anti-obscenity  
laws. The statutes were judged  
“too vague,” “overbroad” and  
therefore unconstitutional. The  
court based its decision on the  
landmark 1973 United States  
Supreme Court ruling that an  
obscenity statute must  
specifically define the sexual  
conduct that may or may not be  
described or depicted.

The ruling has forced local  
courts to take at least 200  
pornography cases off their  
dockets; has turned formerly  
“topless” clubs into “topless  
and bottomless” clubs and night  
spots; has (at least temporarily)  
increased sales and browsers at  
local pornographic bookstores,  
nude photo studios and has  
provided a return engagement  
for Deep Throat at an area  
theatre.

More than one law-enforcement  
official in the state is wary  
of an influx of East Coast organized  
crime into the Denver area  
pornography scene. The  
absence of anti-obscenity laws  
makes the state “more attractive”  
to organized big money  

since more explicit movies and  
books can be shown and stocked  
without the theatre and store  
owners facing jail, fines, and  
costly court appearances.  
Supreme Court Guidelines  
Colorado's anti-obscenity  
laws failed to conform to 2 of the  

3 tests established by the U.S.  
Supreme Court in judging  
whether or not a work is  
obscene:

1) whether the average per-  

son, applying contemporary  
standards would find the work,  
as a whole, appealing to prurient  
standards.

2) whether the work depicts or  
describes in an offensive way  
sexual conduct as specifically  
defined by the state law.

3) whether the work as a  
whole lacks serious literary,  
artistic, or scientific value.  
Colorado's statutes failed to  
pass the second and third tests.

NOW Looks Over the Opposition

Logic Proves Wrong Tact

Carol Hille

Equal rights amendments  
have recently failed to pass in  
New York and in New Jersey.  
Colorado’s own ERA is under  
threat by the efforts of various  
conservative groups, notably the  
League of Housewives, to have it  
rescinded. Until recently,  
feminists have believed for the  
most part that few could take  
seriously the line of rhetoric  
being put out by these groups;  
increasingly, they are coming to  
realize that it is taken seriously  
by a significant proportion of the  
electorate, as well as providing  
for others a much-desired ex-  
cuse to withdraw their support  
for the ERA.

N.O.W. Meeting

This state of affairs was taken  
up at the January 20th meeting  
of the Clara Brown Chapter of  
NOW, Jefferson County. Atten-  
dance was considerably larger  
than usual, as concerned  
members and guests over-  
flowed the room at the Jefferson  
Unitarian Church assigned to  
the meeting.

The program was put together  
by Sharon Menard, Sue Bollman  
and Linda Kuennen, and  
centered loosely around the ERA  
and the housewife; its benefits  
to her, the opposition to the ERA  
from some housewives and,  
finally, why NOW support for the  
ERA has not been sufficiently  
effective.

Ms. Bollman opened the  
program with a summary of  
some of the extreme dis-  
criminations suffered specifical-  
ly by married women in non-ERA  
states. Her listeners seemed  
surprised, for instance, to find  
that in some states, a married  
woman cannot enter a business  
or profession without her  
husband's formal consent. On  
the matter of support: anti-ERA  
groups purport to believe that  
the ERA will take away a  
woman's “right” to be supported  
by her husband. Where a hus-  
band is required to support his  
wife, it is in whatever manner he  
thinks fit. Even if he chooses to  
keep her below subsistence, no  
court will interfere in an on-  
going marriage; a wife in such  
circumstances has no recourse.  
Better known is the discrimina-  
tion against married women in  
the areas of credit, Social  
Security and division of property  
on the dissolution of marriage.  
Many of the abuses involved are  
the result of the discriminatory  
legal assumption that the  
housewife’s contribution to her  
marriage is of no material value.  
The ERA should help to rectify all  
of these inequalities.  
Eagle Forum

The League of Housewives  
had been invited to address the  
meeting with their side of the  
controversy; they declined, and  
it fell to Linda Kuennen to  
present the anti-ERA position.  
She used the much-quoted  
League of Housewives declara-  
tion and the Eagle Forum. The  
LOH declaration parodies the  
U.S. Constitution in language  
and form, apparently to un-  
derline the patriotic nature of the  
group. Significant was the ap-  
prehension expressed in the  

preamble, of huge, vague dis-  
aster overhanging the United  
States that could only be held off  

by a return to strongly conser-  
vative lifestyles. The beliefs  
presented were, as could be  
expected, those of a strongly  
rightist political orientation, with  
objections to “radical  
teachings” in the schools and  
abortion, among other things.  
Like nearly all appeals to  
preserve a social order in which  
women are subjected and con-  
sidered inherently inferior to  
men, the argument falls back on  
“God” for its validation, with  
emphasis on maintaining His  
“divine plan” that ordains the  
man as the head of the family.

From the Eagle Forum came  
an anti-feminist version of  
NOW’s goals. This consisted of  
a collection of goals (not  
necessarily NOW’s, although  
some were) that can be found  

grass-roots opposition to the  

statute defines  
“lustful or morbid  

The state's  
obscenity as  

interest in nudity, sex, sexual  
conduct, sexual excitement,  
excretion, sadism, masochism  

or sadomasochistic abuse.” Ac-  
cording to the ruling, this defini-  
tion of obscenity was too vague  
and not specific enough to let an  
individual know when s/he  
defied the law, incurring criminal  
penalties.  
Legislative Action

After the U.S. Supreme Court  
decision of 1973, some Colorado  
lawmakers realized that the  
Colorado anti-obscenity laws  
would not stand up to the new  
guidelines for constitutionality.  

In an effort to clarify and  
strengthen the laws, the  
Colorado District Attorneys  
Association introduced a bill  
before the state legislature last  
year that would have changed  
the anti-obscenity laws, using  
stronger, more specific  
language. But the bill was killed  
in the House.

It seems that an organized  
lobbying effort against the bill by  
a group called the Media Coali-  
tion, an organization of  
booksellers, librarians, teachers  

among feminists, selected and  
mis-stated to deliver maximum  
shock to the conservative mind.  
Anti-ERA Forces

Following presentation of this  
information, Honey Roberts,  
past president of the chapter,  
added a few remarks that started  
a general discussion as to just  
what she and the others present  
did know about the activities of  
the anti-ERA and anti-feminist  
movements in Colorado. Ms.  
Roberts pointed out that a large  
organization has been formed to  
back the efforts of LOH — their  
fast mailing of literature in  
Colorado amounted to no less  
than one million pieces. She  
noted also the existence of a  
publication called ‘Wake Up  
Colorado,’ designed to raise  

Pornographers Free Hand

and publishers, whose thrust  
against anti-obscenity laws  
rests on freedom of expression  
and First Amendment rights plus  
a general apathy among  
legislators (1975 wasn't an  
election year) killed the bill.  
This year, however, Governor  
Lamm and the City Council have  
vowed to put together new sta-  
tutes and place them before the  
public. Eighteen states have  
passed obscenity laws that have  
withstood the scrutiny of the  
U.S. Supreme Court decision.  
Many feel that if the Colorado  
legislature stated explicitly what  
was not allowed in the realm of  
obscenity, the law would have a  
good chance of surviving.  
Another concept of anti-por-  
nography legislation is that what  
can't be effectively prohibited  
can be regulated. An idea would  
be to have specific zones in the  
city that would have porno-  
graphy and others that would  
not. Boston regulated porno-  
graphy this way, as do many  
European cities. Of course the  
question is whose neighbor-  
hood will the bookstores and  
theatres and shine parlors be in?

ic in ERA Fight

ERA. It is, as she said, a format  
that can easily be adapted and  
spread to any other area.  
Perhaps her most important  
point was a reiteration of what  
others have observed in the past:  
the anti-ERA forces have heavy  
financial backing, allowing them  
to afford such things as mass  
printings and mailings that are  
beyond the reach of feminist  
organizations. Ms. Menard in-  
terjected at this point that  
feminists have not taken advan-  
tage of tools that are available to  
them. LOH, for instance, has  
made good use of the power of  
mass letter writing campaigns,  
whereas NOW has not.

Inez Garcia, pictured at left upon her release from jail, was freed  
on $5,000 bond pending a new trial. On December 29, 1975, the  
California Court of Appeals overturned her 1974 conviction of  
second-degree murder in the death of a man who held her down and  
raped her. Garcia was released from the Monterey County Jail in  
Salinas, California on January 9, 1976, after having served 15  
months in the California Institute for Women in Frontera, California.  
About 70 women, her son, and her husband greeted her and  
presented her with flowers upon her release.

Inez Garcia and Susan Jordan, her attorney, met the press in San  
Francisco on January 12 to discuss the status of the 22-month-old case  
and the defense for the new trial. Both women look forward with  
confidence to a four-year-long court battle. Garcia emphatically stated,  
“This time we are going into court and talking about rape and knives.”  
Seconding Garcia's statement, Jordan added that the basis of the  
defense in court is that two men brutally assaulted Inez Garcia — rape,  
beating, verbal intimidation and knifing — necessitating her reason-  
able reaction in self-defense. Jordan stressed that the defense is  
determined to use every legal technique to ensure that the new trial is a  
fair one. “The way they railroaded me the first time — this trial is going  
to be different,” Garcia stated, adding, “and this time we're going to win!”
