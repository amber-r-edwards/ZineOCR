Simonson Sues

Wisconsin's former Dane County  
Judge Archie Simonson has filed suit  
against two major wire services in  
the U.S., charging that their stor-  
ies were unfair and cost him his  
judgeship.

The lawsuit asks for $3.4 million  
in damages, $1.7 million dollars  
each from Associated Press and  
United Press International.

The former controversial judge  
charges that the wire services un-  
fairly reported his comments last  
May in sentencing a 15-year-old  
boy to a year's home supervision for  
his part in a gang rape at West  
High School in Madison, Wisconsin.

During the hearings, Simonson  
discussed his views on Madison's  
"permissive" atmosphere, "provoca-  
tive" women's clothing, nude enter-  
tainment, sex shops and their effect  
on impressionable young people.

The former judge was quoted as  
saying that rape was a “normal  
reaction" to such a permissive  
atmosphere. His comments created a  
furor, were labeled as sexist and  
biased and interpreted by some to  
condone rape.

As a result of his comments, out-  
raged women's groups circulated  
petitions demanding a recall elect-  
ion, and Simonson was ousted from  
his judgeship in the election by  
losing to his opponent, feminist  
attorney Moria Krueger.

Simonson charges in his suit that  
the A.P. and U.P.I. stories were  
rewritten from the Wisconsin State  
Journal, which made a distinction  
between the sentencing and the  
remarks made during the hearing.  
The former judge charges that A.P.  
and U.P.I. did not make that dis-  
tinction.

The lawsuit accuses the wire  
services of focusing on the light  
sentence given the 15-year-old boy,  
and not mentioning further comments  
by Simonson that sexual assault was  
not proper conduct.

It states that stories released  
by the two wire services helped fuel  
the controversy over Simonson's  
remarks, which ultimately led to  
his being recalled from office last  
September.

Gentle Women

Thirty-two percent of Spanish women  
under the age of 45 have had some  
sort of lesbian experience during  
their lives.

These are the findings of Doctor  
Serrano Vincens writing in his recent-  
ly-released book, Sexual Report on  
Spanish Women. Vincens says that

even though almost one-third of the  
women in Spain report having had a  
homosexual experience at one time,  
only seven percent describe themsel-  
ves as gay.

Vincens claims lesbianism among  
Spanish women is due to the lack of  
gentleness and understanding of  
Spanish men.

No Clothes

A memo, advising congressional  
representatives who planned to  
accompany President Carter on his  
recent trip to Colorado to wear  
business suits, has drawn criticism  
from a lawmaker in Colorado.

Colorado representative Patricia  
Schroeder reportedly complained to  
the House floor that she doesn't  
even own a business suit.

Stopping Periods

The latest controversy in the  
sports world over women involves  
menstruation.

The New York Times reports recent  
studies have revealed that about 30%  
of the women involved in heavy train-  
ing for competitive sports experience  
either irregular periods or none at  
all.

The paper says most gynecologists  
and sports medicine specialists specu-  
late that cessation of menstrual per-  
iods occurs when the percentage of  
a woman's body fat drops below 15%.  
While the average woman's body fat is  
about 25-28%, the body fat content of  
female athletes and dancers can drop  
to 15% or lower.

According to Dr. Joan Ullyot, the  
author of Women’s Running, “It's as  
if the body were saying it didn't  
have enough fat to support a pregnan-  
cy, so it would be better not to pro-  
duce any eggs at all."

Most of the women who report irreg-  
ularities with their periods say that  
as soon as they stop training stren-  
uously, their periods begin again.

Other gynecologists, however, are  
worried that the cessation of menst-  
ual periods may be related to stress,  
posing a possible health problem for  
the women who participate in compet-  
itive sports.

Housewives & Cancer

Doctors released a report in Lane  
County, Oregon that revealed that  
housewives had a death rate from  
cancer 55% higher than either white  
or blue-collar working women. It  
was suggested that the home environ-  
ment is made the most dangerous  
workplace by deodorizers, detergents,  
waxes, and other cleaning products.

Kids Klux Klan

More than one hundred teen-age  
boys reportedly have organized  
Ku Klux Klan chapters at two area  
high schools in Oklahoma City,  
Oklahoma, and are waging a campaign  
of terror against gays, according  
to an Associated Press release.

"We are not just against blacks  
like the old Klan," one youth is  
quoted as saying. "We are against  
gays and the clubs that support  
them, and are going to try to shut  
them down because this activity is  
morally and socially wrong.”

The Oklahoma City Times also  
reported that an estimated 112-132  
students, in the ages 15-16, have  
joined two teen-age chapters of  
the Klan centered in northwest  
Oklahoma City and surrounding  
suburbs.

The boys were quoted as saying  
that in late November they used  
baseball bats in an organized attack  
on patrons at a club catering to  
gays. In that incident several  
people were injured, tires slashed,  
and cars vandalized. The youths  
also claimed responsibility for the  
vandalizing of a large number of  
autos at a gay meeting spot in Will  
Rogers Park in December. No one  
was injured in that incident.

One boy was quoted as saying,  
"The only people we won't let in  
are girls, blacks, Jews, or dope  
smokers. We might consider Cathol-  
ics if the time comes."

Women’s Rights

The United Nations is working on  
an international equal rights con-  
vention which would make discrimin-  
ation against women illegal through-  
out the world. The convention,  
being drafted by delegates from all  
over the globe, is expected to be  
completed in 1979. The U.N. says  
that once the convention is approved  
the U.N. will enforce it by seeking  
sanctions against nations which  
continue to discriminate against  
women.

No More Fear

A Hawaii circuit court jury has ac-  
quitted a woman who reportedly shot  
her former husband after he abused  
her, put a gun in her hand and order-  
ed her to shoot herself.

The jury found Judith Holbron in-  
nocent of manslaughter charges, after  
a witness testified she had previous-  
ly suffered beatings with an axe at  
her husband's hands. The witness  
also told the court that the husband  
had struck his wife when she was nine  
months pregnant, and on a later occa-  
sion stuck the baby's hand in an elec-  
tric fan.

Speaking in her own defense, Holb-  
ron testified: "I knew it wasn't  
right, but my kids aren't living in  
fear anymore, and I'm not living in  
fear anymore."

The jury took only two hours to  
reach its verdict.

Religious Experience

Women prisoners in a jail in Saint  
Gabriel, Louisiana, have asked a  
court to make their warden stop try-  
ing to convert them.

A suit filed by the American Civil  
Liberties Union charges that Warden  
Victor Walker selects whites for pray-  
er meetings at the prison, while dis-  
couraging blacks from attending.

The warden made news earlier this  
year when a New Orleans paper alleged  
Walker had tried to exorcise a woman  
prisoner, Jaqueline McCrary. Walker  
reportedly termed that attempted exor-  
cism a "religious experience."

State prison officials last year  
ordered Walker to cease saving souls  
during working hours.

However, the Louisiana Coalition on  
Jails and Prisons claims the warden is  
still pushing prayer meetings at the  
souls in his slammer.

In case of rape...

Despite vocal protests from parents  
and women's groups, the police in  
Ottawa, Canada, will continue show-  
ing high school girls a film advoc-  
ating "playing along" with rapists.

The Ontario provincial Attorney-  
General has told the protesters  
that, "In summary, the film of which  
you complain is entertaining but  
impractical and possibly dangerous  
in its recommendations." But because  
it does not break any laws, the  
Attorney-General claims, he can't  
take action.

The Ottawa Rape Crisis Center has  
attempted to counteract the film in  
question by sending speakers into  
the classrooms where it is shown.  
They do not, however, have sufficient  
staff to cover all screenings.

Protestor Rita Rosenfeld charged  
that "The Ottawa police have in  
their possession at least two other  
anti-rape films, which they claim  
are not as ‘entertaining’ as the one  
we're objecting to."

No Joy—Just Anita

The two books, Joy of Lesbian  
Sex and Joy of Gay Sex have been  
the basis for criminal charges in  
at least two cities and the subject  
of a memorandum banning their dis-  
play in all of B. Dalton Booksell-  
er's 300 stores. The books were two  
of 12 confiscated from three book-  
stores by police in Lexington, KY  
in the city's first enforcement of  
a new anti-pornography law that  
prohibits the display of sexually  
oriented material in places frequen-  
ted by minors.

Last July 18, a memo was sent to  
all managers of B. Dalton stores to  
“keep the books off the selling  
floor and show it to adult customers  
by request only." In the fall,  
Dalton's company bulletin which  

views books included a rave re-  
view of Anita Bryant's book with a  
note on the bottom that said it  
was ordered for all the stores.

Prostitution Ring

About 2000 Thai women are “sold”  
into prostitution in West Germany  
against their will each year.

Agence France Press reports that  
a handful of West German men are get-  
ting rich by “importing” young women  
from Thailand by trickery. The women  
are reportedly persuaded to go to  
Germany with promises of marrying  
wealthy German men or of earning  
their own fortune by being models or  
restaurant hostesses.

Once in Germany, Thai women are  
"rented" to brothels masquerading as  
night clubs or saunas for as much as  
$2500 and are often sold outright for  
$10,000. The clubs then make up the  
cost of buying women by charging high  
prices for prostitution.

The women rarely denounce their  
employers because of fears of re-  
prisals and death.
