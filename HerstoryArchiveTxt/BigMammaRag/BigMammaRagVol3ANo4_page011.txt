A Letter to Cynthia

Have You Ever

Have you ever  
thought  
that the blind  
have no colour prejudices,  
and the deaf care not  
for speeches,  
and even lacking our five  
overrated senses  
that humans have the choice  
to hate  
or  
to love.  

Bernice Lever  

I cannot bear the pain of seeing your  
face, so thin and gray with shadows hiding  
in each crease upon your cheek. You play  
at being hard and cold... acquired bravado  
for the sake of all appearance. Where are  
you beneath this crust of necessary stone?  
You should have lived in milder clime,  
straight way from birth 'til now, and yet  
you've endured the harsh and bitter taste  

of sage, as though that’s all there is.  

Oh, golden child of chaos’ time, who for  

all of this can find in the twinkle of a  

gem, the gleam of gold and silver, the  
moon’s delight. You've been placed un-  
fairly in roles unsuited for so fragile  

a girl. You do not fool me, not for an  

instant. Your heart is

Portrait  

I hold my face  
like my mother's  
eyes  
corner  
apprehensive  
searching  
between her lines  
for clues to my own  
wrinkled fate.  

Her self-portrait is  
of a woman  
I have never seen before  
shadows of purple  

and green  
hair flaming from  
pituitary eye spot  

This painting is of  

a woman unleashed  

who lies in wait  
inside myself.

red and velvet.  

Insulation  

we sit close together  

under slow-dropping  
sky-stinging tears.  

I swallow speculations  

fed by your eyes and your smiles.  

a barrier exists.  

hiding behind your insulation  

you watch my words fall short  

flashing like futile arrows  

failing to span immeasurable distances.  

and yet you offer nothing.  

is this day  

another loaf of baked illusions?  

or do we dare not touch  

the sensitive pulse locked up in your mind?  

it seems you are afraid  

that I will try to peel from you  
your protective layers of silence.  
yet I too tremble  

on the brink of vulnerability  

and once again we part  
embalmed in our own inhibitions  
I am left again unsatisfied  

under slow-dropping  
sky-stinging tears.

_ The American Way  

televised tears  
of the American parents  
upon seeing their Vietnamese foster children;  
is adoption compensation  
for all the Viet lives lost?  
will a wholesome suburban upbringing for these infants  
console the shrapneled souls, the buried bodies?  
are these new American citizens  
to replace those who suffered and died in a foreign war?  
twenty years from now, how many of them will be called  
to fight for their foster country on foreign soil?  
we slaughter the countrymen and women,  
and bring their orphans home to Americans who will teach them  
that their parents and their native land:  
were raped and destroyed —  
in the name of holy democracy.

Moments  

Tick, Tock  

Tick, Tock,  

A clock ticking away  

the seconds of the minutes of  
the hours of a night for an  
empty person in an empty bed,  
Tick,  

Remembering,  

Tock,  

Forgetting,  

Tick,  

Memories,  

Tock,  

Dreaming,  

Ticking,  

Awake, a ceiling staring  

like a dark canvas with  
endless shadows.  

The silence so loud that  

the ticking is echoing off the walls  
emptying into a mind-needing, wanting  
Ticking, Ticking...
