terers or rapists. If you

access to such briefs, con-
tact Kris Steinkoenig, 410

thesis entitled, "A Politi-
cal Analysis of Self Defense
Law and its Application to
Women Who Kill in Self
Defense."

ments will be used at meet-

choice pamphlet to counter-
act misleading and exagger-
ated claims by so-called
"pro-life" activists.
