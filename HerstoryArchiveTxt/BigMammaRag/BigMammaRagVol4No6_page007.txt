Health Insurance Will Not Cure Health Industry Ills for Poor

Deborah Taylor

In this article I will discuss
the health care system: who
pays for it, profits from it, and
controls it. I will also examine
proposed national health in-
surance plans and their likely
effect on our health care in
this country.

The health care system is a
huge industry, controlled for
profit by the providers of
health care, not the con-
sumers. The proposed na-
tional insurance plans will not
change this basic system;
rather they will consolidate
the power of the providers and
continue the inequities and
deterioration of our health
care.

Who makes a profit from our
health care? The providers
and buyers of our health care,
and not us. The drug industry
makes $600 million/year pro-
fit; hospitals and nursing
homes $150 million; hospital
supply companies $400 mil-
lion; doctors $2 billion in
excess salaries; and health
insurance companies hun-
dreds of millions in profits.

Who pays for our health
care? We do—the working
class women and men of this
country. We pay insurance
premiums, dentist bills, social
security, and out-of-pocket
health expenses like drugs. A
large chunk of our income
goes for health, and the poorer
we are, the more we pay
proportionately. In 1963, the
average family earning $2000
paid 15.7% of its income in
health care expenditures;
families with income between
$3500 and $5000 paid 6.8%
and those with income over
$7500 paid 3.8%. As usual,
the rich get richer and the
poor stay poor.

Social security now pays for
Medicare and will probably
eventually fund the national
health insurance plan. But,
social security is the most
regressive form of taxation we
have: meaning the rich do not
pay anywhere near their
share. There is a cutoff point
at $7500 and any income
earned over this is not taxed
by social security. So poor
people will have to pay much
more for their health insur-
ance than rich people.

Who controls health care in
this country? The providers
and buyers of health care
and not the consumers. Blue
Cross and Blue Shield hosp-
itals, drug industries, medical
supply companies, doctors,
and the commercial health
insurance agencies have a
huge amount of financial and
political power and use it to
control the health business.
Blue Cross handles hospital
insurance for about 100 mil-
lion people and $10 billion a
year passes through its hands.

Blue Cross pays for over 40% 
of hospital costs in New York
City. Representatives of hos-
pitals dominate Blue Cross
plans, and the interlocking
directorates mean that Blue
Cross pays for anything the
hospital asks for. Doctors and

kept of who had access to it,
and those people would not be
the ones who were digging
up the so-called “independent
evidence” later on. Those
motions were denied. So, we
felt as though there was a very
good legal issue around that.

There were questions in
terms of the whole hearing by
which she was granted im-
munity and, then, the other
hearing in which she was
found in contempt. The
hearing in which she was
granted immunity—we got
oral notice of that about an
hour and a half before it was

Blue Shield interlock on the
Boards of State Medical Soc-
ieties and local Boards of
Health.

Aetna Life Insurance com-
pany is one of the biggest
commercial companies in the
country, and now sells one
billion dollars’ worth of health
insurance each year. One half
of our net savings is now used
for premiums of health and
life insurance. The insurance
companies have become inc-
redibly powerful: Prudential
and Metropolitan Life are
equals to Chase Manhattan
and have more assets than
General Motors, Standard Oil
of New Jersey and I.T.T.

These insurance companies
have discovered they need a
more stable cash flow to
counteract inflationary med-
ical costs. In the last few years
they have been underwriting
losses, and have struggled to
get rate increases to keep pace
with inflation. Public sub-
sidies would help firm up their
shaky financial position.

Just as Medicare has pumped
a lot of money in profits
into the health care system, a
national health insurance plan
would do the same thing on a
larger scale. The profits of
nursing homes, hospitals and
drug companies will go up
with national health insur-
ance. Hospitals will finally get
the money they need for
capital investment ($25 billion
is needed for the next ten
years).

Since 1964 when Medicare
started, medical costs have
risen astronomically, because
it encourages unnecessary
procedures by doctors and
profiteering by nursing homes
and hospitals. In California,
children of Medicaid recip-
ients have four times as much
surgery as other children.

There are no real controls or
careful audits because in our
system, doctors supervise
doctors and professionals are
considered above reproach.
Medicare has improved the
health care of the elderly, but
at the expense of the rest of
the population. Medicare has
overburdened and has not
dealt with the basic inequities
of the system without restruc-
turing it. Medicare only pays
for 43% of the yearly bill of
the elderly ($692 average).
Everyone sees national
health insurance as an idea
whose time has come. We
hope it will do something
about our deteriorating health
care: the shortage of doctors,
astronomical costs, the two-
class health care system,
where the poor get inferior
care, impersonal fragmented
service and the use of danger-
ous drugs etc. Unfortunately,
however, unless we make our
needs known and gain some
power, the structure of the
system will stay the same,
while getting more financially
stable. National Health Insu-
rance has a positive side to it,
it would diminish health care
needs. Right now,
private health insurers pay for
40% of health costs, whereas
National Health Insurance
would cover up to 70% of the
costs. This, however, is not
complete coverage, there is
still a financial burden for
getting sick.

Both Nixon’s and Kennedy’s
proposed health insurance
plans do not deal with the
current shortage of doctors.

We need 50,000 more doctors
and 500,000 more health wor-
kers. The supply of potential
primary doctors (family prac-
titioners, internists, and ped-
iatricians) has fallen from 94
per 100,000 population in 1931
to 53.2 per 100,000 in 1967.

When we do see a doctor, we
are shuffled from one spec-
ialist to another impersonally
without any continuity of care.
Doctors can’t give us much
time if they want to earn their
huge incomes. (The median
income of doctors was $40,000
in 1970.) Since it costs $100,000
to produce one doctor, a lot of
money is needed just to get as
many doctors as we had forty
years ago.

Unfortunately, neither of the
insurance plans is allocating
much money for the devel-
opment of medical personnel.
On top of this, we are
confronted with the elitist
nature of the medical profes-
sion. The sexism and hier-
archical nature of our male
dominated medical delivery
system won't diminish with
national health insurance. No
money is being allocated for
in-service training or the sha-
ring of responsibility by dif-
ferent levels of personnel.

Patients will still remain pow-
erless.

The drug industry will con-
tinue producing expensive,
unnecessary and dangerous
drugs in order to make its
huge profits. Drug companies
charge consumers thirty times
the actual cost of producing a
drug because of their monop-
olistic control of the market.
There are seldom more than 2
or 3 companies producing any
given drug; more than half of
all drug sales are of products
made by only one company.
Long term patents keep out
potential rivals. The drug

let's go up and see the judge,
walk upstairs, and have a
hearing. (There was) no ci-
tation of what was, in fact, the
particular questions that she
was being held in contempt
for—nothing, nothing like
that.

BMR: Was she held in
contempt because she would
not talk to the grand jury—or
was that even made clear?
RB: Yes, basically, it's
contempt of court. The judge
orders her to talk to the grand
jury—he did that as part of
giving her the immunity.
(He) ordered her to talk to the
grand jury, and then, when
she did not, relying on these
various privileges, then he
found her in contempt of
court. That’s how that
basically proceeds.

Another issue was the whole
question of having an attorney
present in the grand jury
room. Most people don't
realize this, they think that
anybody who has any dealings
with the criminal justice sys-
tem can have an attorney with
them. In most cases that’s
true. If they’re being ques-
tioned by a district attorney,
it’s true; if they're being
questioned by a United States
Attorney; if they're in court; if
they're in a hearing; anything—
but not the grand jury.

With the grand jury the
witness has to go in alone, the
attorney cannot accompany
them. We feel as though
that’s a violation of their right
to counsel! and, in all proba-
bility, of their right to not
incriminate themselves, since
they wouldn’t necessarily
have the technical knowledge
to understand when they were
or when they were not incrim-
inating themselves, and when
they had the legal right to
remain silent, without the
advice of counsel. Now,
counsel can be in the hallway
outside, the witness can go out
into the hall and consult with
the attorney, but it's not the
same as having your attorney
