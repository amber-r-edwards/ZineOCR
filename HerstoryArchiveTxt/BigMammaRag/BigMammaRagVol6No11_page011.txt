is Christmas  
Politically Correct ?  

To The Women’s Community;  

As Jewish women, we ask the women's  
community to think about the follow-  
ing:  

1. Women from Christian backgrounds  

should at least think about why and  
how they celebrate Christmas.  
2. As Jewish women we are assaulted  
by Christmas greetings, decorations  
and celebrations. WE ARE SICK OF  
HEARING MERRY CHRISTMAS.  
3. Chanukah is not "The Jewish  
Christmas". “Happy Chanukah" is a  
historical celebration and falls  
the same time every year, the 25th  
day of the month of Kislev. The  
only thing that Christmas and  
Chanukah have in common is that  
they fall at the same time of year.  
4. Christmas, as celebrated, is  
oppressive to poor people.  
5. Christmas is a Christian/patri-  
archal holiday. Examine the terms  
associated with Christmas:  
Virgin Mother  
Immaculate Conception  
Son of God  
Father of Man  
3 wise men  
Kings of kings.

Witch Speaks Out  

Dear BM,  

I am writing in protest to the un-  
fair bigoted, and misleading slander  
of the real Witches that occurs 365  
days a year, but becomes predominate  
in the autumn seasons with all the  
"witch" costumes sold for trick or  
treating, the various programs on  
TV depicting Witches as mean, ugly,  
warty, revolting people and the in-  
evitable newspaper articles about  
witches’ brews, brooms and such.  
These things are the products of  
ignorance and are very offensive to  
those whom the products and articles  
parody. Why don't they ask the real  
Witches? :  

All Hallow's Eve (or Samhain, as  
we Witches call it) is a religious  
holiday, about 3000 years old, of  
the Witches in honor of their God  
who, contrary to popular misconcep-  
tion, is not Satan. We don't even  
believe in the existence of a devil.  

I feel that it is in very poor  
taste to ridicule another person's  
religion. That a nation as great as  
America should make an annual public  
display of their ignorance in this  
matter, offending other citizens'  
religious beliefs, is unbelievable.  
It would be like the nation deciding  
to ridicule Yom Kippur and everyone  
donning an oversized plastic nose as  
part of the celebration since it is  
common to associate a large nose with  
being Jewish; although any intelli-  
gent person realizes that this is a  
fallacy.  

The religion that Witches practice  
is a very beautiful, peaceful reli-  
gion. It is much older than Christi-  
anity and has continued through cen-  
turies of persecution and lies in  
spite of the bigotry. We are slowly  
emerging aboveground but, due to the  
public's lack of knowledge of the  
subject and their subsequent fear,  
we find it difficult to practice our  
religion openly without fear of harm,  
although according to the Constitu-  
tion we are guaranteed such freedom.  

Wake up, America: It's the 20th  
century now, and surely everyone  
must realize in this day and age  
that everything that one reads or  
hears is not necessarily so. We  
Witches have been maligned and per-  
secuted for far too long. It's time  

Alice Levine  
Donna Levi  
Wendy Axel  
Judith Klain  

for Americans to take their heads  
out of the sand and look to every-  
one's religious rights and freedom -  
not just those beliefs that have  
been traditionally accepted.  

Blessed be,

Virago  

FROM PAGE 2  

Virago met through the Leaping Les-  
bian Follies and the Musicians Union.  
Since the festival, Virago has help-  
ed some of these performers gain more  
exposure by suggesting their names  

to the Boulder and Denver Women's  
Coffeehouses, the Rocky Flats Action  
Group and the Karen Silkwood Defense  
Fund Committee.  

Most recently we produced Wood  
and a trio of mime-dancers called  
Terpsichore. The concert was well  
attended, ran smoothly and was en-  
joyable to work on. Hopefully more  
concerts of local performers will  
continue to happen.  

As some of you already know, the  
concert of Wood was Virago's last  
production. Toward the end of Octo-  
ber the members of Virago decided to  
dissolve both the collective and the  
corporation. It was a painful and  
a hard decision to make and yet all  
of us realized that it was the only  
reasonable solution to our situation.  
While everyone in Virago shared a  
common interest in expanding women's  
culture and developing the women's  
music network, over the months it  
became apparent to all of us that  
as a group we lacked a shared poli-  
tic. We struggled with collective  
process to the point of sheer ag-  
gravation (which is not a new phen-  
omena by any means) but this was not  
the major source of our problem. We  
gradually recognized that our indi-  
vidual political attitudes and goals  
were so different that we could not  
work together.  

More specifically, our differences  
surfaced around three major issues:  

*** How to deal with money  
(i.e., setting ticket prices and  
fundraising);  

*** How and what it means to be ac-  
countable to the women's community;  

*** Under what conditions and how do  

we compensate the collective for the  

skills and resources that we share  

with other organizations and busi-  
nesses.  

The lack of agreement on these  

issues and the unwillingness to  

compromise created a severe lack  

of trust within the group which  
made decision-making by consensus  
virtually impossible. When we rea-  
lized that our spirit as a group  
was in name only, regardless of the  
given struggles of collective pro-  
cess, we knew it was time for us to  
disband.  

We have arranged to store our  
files in the feminist library at  
Woman to Woman Bookcenter so women  
can have access to information and  
resources on production. To in-  
sure that everyone has equal access  
to these files, the information  
will not be taken out of the library  
but will be available for use at  
the center. As far as our  
finances are concerned we have de-  
cided to donate Virago's remaining  
funds to the Colorado Feminist  
Federal Credit Union and to Big  
Mama Rag. Each group will receive  
$242.00  

While it is unfortunate that  
Virago has disbanded, most members  
(recent and past) continue to have  
an interest in working on women's  
productions. Perhaps some of us  
will regroup, or work with other  
feminist organizations, or work  
independently. Regardless of the  
individual directions we take,  
the Denver feminist community will  
not be without women's cultural  
events.

bian Sex as the way things really are  
serve only to re-cloud the issue of  
who and what a lesbian is.  

Hopefully any woman who buys The Joy  

of Lesbian Sex will do so in complete  
awareness that this book does not by  
any means explain how it is for all  
lesbians, or even the majority.  

More seriously, there were several  
statements in this book which I found  
extremely dangerous in their total  
inaccuracy. The two most blatant ex-  
amples of this concerned first, the  
connection between alcoholism and  
lesbianism; and secondly, the rather  
wishful insistence that all lesbians  
are able to come to orgasm at will.  

The authors state, “as for alcohol-  
ism, it's been our experience - both  
clinically and through personal ob-  
servation - that lesbians are not af-  
flicted at a rate any greater than  
the general population.... The image  
of a lonely, middle-aged lesbian  
hunched over endless scotches may  
reflect the outside world's view that  
gays can't be happy, but it is simply  
not accurate."  

Unfortunately, there are many - and  
not just middle-aged - lesbians for  
whom the above image is painfully ac-  
curate. Furthermore, the rate of al-  
coholism in the lesbian community is  
much greater than that in the gen-  
eral population. (See box on page 5):  

As for the claim made in The Joy —  
of Lesbian Sex that frigidity “is a  
condition simply unheard of among  
lesbians", and the later, even more  
blatant supporting statement, "there  
is no such thing as a frigid lesbian  
... lesbians always reach orgasm in  
their lovemaking, and frequently ex-  
perience the joy of reaching it a-  
gain and again in the same session",  
I cannot understand how the authors  
could have believed these statements,  
much less have allowed them to be  
published. Frigidity is a problem  
that goes with sexuality, and it is  
not confined to the bedrooms of het-  
erosexuals.  

These completely inaccurate claims  
are dangerous in two ways. First,  
it puts the lesbian who is having  
difficulty expressing or experienc-  
ing her sexuality back in the posi-

tion of being a freak. Secondly,  
and perhaps more importantly, these  
false claims form another myth that  
serves to keep lesbians isolated as  
mysterious and different people.  

If lesbians were not considered ab-  
normal enough, they now have this  
magical ability to come to orgasm  
at will.  

Lesbians have problems like anyone  
else. To state that they do not, or  
to minimize their importance or oc-  
currence, is to do a disservice to  
every woman who reads the book, par-  
ticularly to the lesbians who are  
reading the book in search of accu-  
rate information, but also to those  
of us who had hoped this book would  
explain and describe not only some  
techniques of lesbian lovemaking,  
but also what it means to be a les-  
bian, the unhappiness as well as the  
joy. Because no lesbian is gay all  
the time.  

Abortion  

FROM PAGE 3  

confusion of many young women about  
birth control and abortion rights.  
If this minors' law is upheld and  
other states view it as precedent-  
setting, young women across the  
country will be forced to carry un-  
wanted pregnancies to term. Or they  
will do what I suspect they've been  
compelled to do: lie about their  
ages or fake parental permission  
forms."  

Circuit Judge Aldrich agrees with  
Cagan. In writing about the 1974  
law, he said the young woman finds  
herself in a “no-win situation. If  
she loses the judicial proceedings,  
(she will experience) a personal  
blow...If she wins...she is likely  
to find herself in an even worse  
situation," one in which she risks,  
at least for some time, the possible  
deterioration of her relationship  
with her family. And in more drastic  
cases, she is left vulnerable to  
parents who are potential or actual  
child abusers.
