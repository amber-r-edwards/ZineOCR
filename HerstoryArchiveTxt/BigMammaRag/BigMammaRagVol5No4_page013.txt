At home or at work, they'll try
to put you down

They can’t seem to understand
you survive with no one around

Well listen people and I'll tell you

Loving a woman ain't one stroke short
of bliss

No longer must women content them-
selves with vague and ambiguous re-
ferences to the women in their lives.
No more pretentious cover-ups. No
more neutered words. What has been
given is stated in no uncertain terms
through the music and words of Teresa
Trull.

Teresa's The Ways a Woman Can Be is
the latest offering from Olivia Re-
cords. Once again, feminists can re-
joice in this addition to the variety
of women's music the Olivia Collect-
ive has chosen to share with us.

It is refreshing to listen to
Teresa sing openly of women as
friends and lovers. Her lesbian
feminist politics are evident enough,
in her strongly worded songs, to sat-
isfy even the most hardcore of the
movement.

All the diverse aspects of our
lives are scattered throughout the
songs on the record. Very little of
the music threatens to join the ranks
of polite music that has been the
experience of the past. It is in
the struggles of women that Teresa

~-Rebecca

This book is about friendship, a
long-time friendship told through the
separate journal entries of two women

who had been close friends in college.

By all accounts, they “should” have
grown apart. The journal project
covers 1971-72--several years after
Esther Newton (Pauline) and Shirley
Walton (Rebecca) have graduated.

They share a growing commitment to
feminism, but they've made very dif-
ferent life choices: Rebecca, a pro-
fessional sportswriter, is married
and pregnant; Pauline, a writer and
professional academic, is childless
and in the process of coming out
(politically) as a lesbian.

The project marks a critical time
in their friendship, a point where
many of us might have given up for
good or taken a long leave of absence
from one another. It was also a dif-
ficult time within the women's move-
ment for "gay-straight" relationships.

The book blends both the political
and personal. The journals connect
with solid political subjects such
as gay liberation, nuclear families,
class, CR groups, therapy and man-
hating--as such weave through the
lives of both women. Pauline has
several entries covering the early
days of planning for Amazon Expedi-
tion, a lesbian-feminist anthology
she helped edit with several "nota-
bles" in the New York dyke/feminist
community. Although all names are
changed, the none-too-subtle power
plays within the group make fascin-
ating reading, as does all good
gossip.

But the strength of the book lies
in the interrelationship of Pauline
and Rebecca's separate, but over-
lapping daily struggles: the death
of a father-in-law, the sharing of
child care, mothers (their own), the

Culture

is strongest.
Musically, Teresa moves from blues
to an upbeat

style, through soul,

form of folk rock, presenting the
listener with a variety of moods and
expression.

Depending on the song, she is
quite capable of softly caressing a
note, turning around, and addressing

it from a gutsy, let-it-all-out level.

The instrumental accompaniment is
supportive and full-bodied, without
detracting from the vocals. The
background vocals also lend them-
selves to the well-rounded feelings.

With The Ways a Woman Can Be, we
are given the benefit of the experi-
ence and expertise Olivia seems to be
fostering in women's music. The al-
bum is polished and precise; Olivia
has come a long way from their first
record in both quality and style.

Teresa and Olivia are to be con-
gratulated on this long-awaited, much
longed-for musical delight. We can
only hope this record is an indica-
tion of women's music yet to be
heard.

process of taking your writing ser-
iously, quitting smoking, dealing
with assholes, and the intricacies of
“working it all out" with your lover.

A major theme of the book is Re-
becca's pregnancy, which begins shor-
tly after both women agree to keep
journals of their friendship. It
becomes a catalyst for the fears,
political differences, and long-
standing competitiveness of both:

Pauline: "Nature overwhelms me.
NATURE has this day ratified your
marriage, casting me and Laura into
the void of perversion, nonexistence,
invisibility and insignificance.
Pitiful, perhaps, two women together

..When will this rage, this pain
stop?"

Rebecca: "I was her (Pauline's)
Alice B. Toklas. I could be envied
at times, for having the privileges
of convention, but the envy was a
useful tool, a goad used by Pauline
to succeed. When the envy wasn't
there, it was again implicitly,
understood that my privileged status
was in fact inferior in terms of
morality and principle."

The central feeling of the book is
intensity. Pauline and Rebecca put
each other through a lot of pain:
rage/guilt/demands/plain misunder-
standing--the stuff of soap operas
with little of the comic relief of
Mary Hartmann. The relationship
not only survives, but grows--solid
support for those of us who tend to
condescend/overprotect/keep silent
when a relationship runs into pro-
blems.

Sometimes, however, Pauline and
Rebecca's mutual introspection and
accusations seem just too "tortured"
--a flaw which may be partly due to
the fact that both women are then
seeing shrinks. You find yourself
wishing they would just "let go" or
forget the whole thing; but the
journal form keeps it all flowing,
and you read on.

Underlying this book is the impli-
cit question, what is the nature of
friendship? What is that something
that goes beyond political alliances,
"common interests" and simple long
association? Those questions are
never fully answered, but here are
some excerpts from the journals:

Pauline: "Rebecca, I love you.
When have I said this? Why do I
feel it now? I don't approve of you,
I am angry at you...But all this is
zero, nothing...I am reduced to a
tiny point in the middle of my brain
which connects to my stomach and I

MARGIE ADAM.
a record album
Margie Adam

SONGWRITER.

Mary Wadding

Released in 1976, Margie Adam, Song
writer, is certainly a welcome addi-
tion to the growing list of women's
recordings.

Margie has been a familiar figure
in women's music through her work
with the Olivia Records label. How-
ever, with her first offering, she
exhibits her talents as--yes, a song
writer.

There can be little doubt, listen-
ing to her record, that she can
write a pleasant song. Hers is a
collection ranging in appeal from
the introspective (Lost in Inner
Space, Images), to the current punk
fun fad (Sleazy).

Each song has within its lyrics the
spiritual essence and strength she
finds within herself and other women.
Yet, we can also experience the ver-
satility of her musical ability. Two
selections are without vocals, show-
casing Margie on the piano.

The sound quality is excellent and
the arrangements, accompaniment, and
background vocals are worth noting.
Familiar names are among those who
contributed to this recording where
time and energy were obviously de-
voted.

There are two very basic criticisms
that should be mentioned. First,
there is a notable lack of political
consciousness. There is plainly no
feeling that politics even exist.
This may or may not be relevant in
light of the enjoyment of women's
music. Even those feminists who are
wholly immersed in their politics
and looking for a strong, political
statement must admit the record is

know that you are on my side, you
care about me and I care about you.” 
Rebecca: "I think she (Pauline) is
afraid to comment on my work, because
she sees no devotion to becoming an
artist, no 'great' literature. She
misses the profundity of what we do,
regardless of what we write as indj-
viduals...we use this vehicle for
separate reasons. Yet the fact that
we do it together, that we struggle
in print together, is revolutionary."
Rebecca, again: “We for all our
differences, have similar inhibitions,
similar needs around security, rela-
tionships, order, tradition, fear,
anxiety. Should we be supporting
each other around these inhibitions?
Do we help each other change?"
Womenfriends is published in 1976,
four years after the writing. In
the epilogue, the authors tell you
what has since become of themselves
and of Rebecca and Pauline--who by
then have evolved into separate char-
acters of a sort. (Because the book
struck me as part mystery, I won't
reveal the ending, except to say that
it flows naturally from the journals.)
A note on that four-year gap be-
tween writing and publication: Esther
and Shirley were faced with a monu-
mental editing problem: 1000 pages.
Failing to find a "skilled editor"
(fortunately) or a publisher, they
decided to do it all themselves:
"This vote of confidence in ourselves
plus the distance we eventually ach-
ieved from our journals...gave us
the energy to understand what we had
done, and to bring it into focus."
They did.

pleasant listening.

The second criticism is the incon-
sistency of Margie's voice. At times
it fails to hold true, breaking and
changing mid-note, fading out of
tune. Somehow, it's not up to the
smooth music it accompanies.

Overall, Margie Adam, Songwriter,
is very easy on the ears--a pleasant
experience. It's just one of those

albums that everyone should have the
good fortune to hear.
