role in the collective as providing  
a pragmatic base for Seline. "You  

can't protect children from the real  
world and to do so is a disservice.”  

Seline, herself, is currently going  

through the crisis where she is demand-  
ing an exclusive relationship with  
her "Mom", although she is also am-  
bivalent and uses the fact that she  
has "six mothers" to make her peers  
at daycare jealous.  

In spite of Seline's demands,  
Penny believes that she is doing  
what is best for Seline. "If I'm  
happy, she's happy. I can't take  
full emotional and economic responsi-  
bility for Seline and the childcare  
collective provides the necessary  
support. This is the price Seline  
has to pay. And she certainly isn't  
a deprived child."  

Because of her exposure to people  
and experience, Seline is exception-  
ally aware of people's feelings and  
attitudes and is intellectually per-  
ceptive.  

THE ALAN COLLECTIVE  

For women who would like to con-  
sider the idea of a childcare collec-  
tive but are overwhelmed at the  
thought of jumping into a complete  
collective commitment, the Alan  
collective provides a more "modified"  
version. Alan was raised in a nuc-  
lear family until age two. When his  
parents got divorced, his mother,  
Judy, moved into a collective house  
of women. She now defines herself as  
a lesbian. For the past four years  
Alan has lived collectively with  
parenting responsibilities informally  
divided among 3 or 4 women. For the  
past year and a half, Alan has had a  
childcare collective. Alan's collec-  
tive acts as a support group for his  
mother, Judy. The collective does  
not share the economic responsibilities  
at this time.  

Alan spends some evenings during  
the week with collective members, but  
he does not stay overnight. Each  
weekend, he spends at different  
collective members’ houses, so that  
each primary collective member has  
him for one weekend a month.  

“We aren't just regular babysit-  
ters," as one member put it. “We  
have regular meetings and discuss  
Alan's problems and how to handle  
them. For instance, Alan was afraid  
to bring a close friend home from  
school and wouldn't tell his mother  
why—that he might be worried about what  
his friend would think of his moth-  
er's lesbianism. We discussed it at  

a meeting and one of the other parents  
(also a lesbian) was picked to dis-  
cuss this with him the next time he  
spent the weekend. He was, in fact,  
able to discuss it more openly in  
this kind of situation."  

THE LESBIAN-FEMINIST FACTOR  

Since all of the collectives at  
this time are in the lesbian feminist  
community, the situation of male par-  
ents and male children (or their ab-  

sence) does raise some added questions.  

The absence of men in the family  
living situation, as in the Seline  
collective, can be dealt with most  
easily. Although peer pressure from  
friends at her daycare does encourage  
Seline to seek a "Daddy", this is a  
problem that any single mother has  
to face. "I was raised with my  
mother", said Penny, "so a matriarch-  
al household seems normal to me. Se-  
line has contact with men anyway,  
through daycare and in the neighbor-  
hood. I feel no responsibility to  
furnish men for her. I'm not a pro-  
curer."  

John's situation as the only male  
parent in the Morgan Collective has  
also caused some tension. John has  

expressed that he sometimes feels  
threatened by being outnumbered. His  
presence seems to provide less of a  
problem to other women in the collec-  
tive, and on the whole, the group  
does not feel it is the major issue.  

The most serious contradictions  
seem to occur when a male child is  
being raised in a lesbian feminist  
household, Judy admits that she had  
some of her own reservations when  
she first entered the lesbian commun-  
ity. At the same time, she did not  
trust Alan's natural father to raise  
Alan and she did not see any other  
choices. The lack of support for  
lesbians raising male children in  
much of the lesbian community has  
been a painful process for Judy.  

One woman who had a long-term close  
relationship with Alan left the child-  
care collective because she no longer  
wanted to deal with male children.  

Judy recognizes that as Alan has  
been exposed more to traditional  
society, he has identified himself  
more with male attitudes, including  
sexist attitudes. In this instance,  
the childcare collective provides —  
some support to both Judy and Alan in  
that there are two men in the collec-  
tive with a commitment to feminist  
principles so that Alan will have  
male images that counter the more  
extreme forms of male sexism. Judy  
acknowledges that it may still be  
necessary for both her and Alan to  
let his father raise him at some  
point, but does not feel it is neces-  
sary nor advisable at this time.  

DOES IT WORK?  

In the final analysis, the ques-  
tion is whether the childcare collec-  
tives work. From an outside observ-  
er's view, the children seem indepen-  
dent, well socialized at daycare,  
bright, and generally happy. They  
seem to have neither more (and some-  
times less) problems than other child-  
ren of their age. If the problems  
they do have seem somewhat different,  
they reflect the fact that their  
living patterns are somewhat differ-  
ent from those of traditional fami-  
lies. All of the parents I spoke  
with felt that the childcare collec-  
tives provided the parents with  
greater freedom and that there were  
less parent-child tensions for the  
children than in a nuclear family  
situation. As one parent put it:  

“I worry sometimes that these kids  
will rebel when they get older as we  
did against our parents, but I'm  
sure my mother worried about how she  
was raising me. Basically, I want  
these kids to be strong and they are  
strong."

experience of lesbians in Canada. In  
fact, I cannot recall any books I  
have read from Canada which deal with  
lesbians—a stark contrast to the  
writings which are being produced by  
American feminists. Are these six  
books representative of a pattern? I  
haven't any answers to offer. At the  
same time, I must reiterate that Cana-  
dians do an exceptional job of bring-  
ing forth working-class writings and  
feminist analysis, and it is something  
for American women to consider. Per-  
haps American women must turn and ask:  
"What current working-class writings  
do we print which are not lesbian?  

Who is invisible to us?”  

I have chosen to write about New  
Star Books this month not because they  
are the best of all Canadian presses  
which deal with women. Such a state-  
ment is ridiculous and irrelevant. I  
chose to write about New Star Books  
because a good friend gave me a copy  
of Taxi! to read on my trip to Denver.  
I became curious about the press,  
wrote them and collected materials for  
this article. But there are many more  
presses in Canada and I would like to  
share their addresses. They are:

those involved in the recall, of les-  
bians who are also feminists. Since the  
beginning of the gay rights movement  
there has been a strong tendency of  
men to think that they can have mixed  
organizations of men and women around  
gay (male-oriented) issues, without  
having to deal with feminism. Somehow  
the logic seems to be that male homo-  
sexuality and female homosexuality are  
similar enough to be a basis of gay  
unity without the necessity of strug-  
gling over other things that separate  
men and women. If, for gay men, their  
primary oppression is as homosexuals,  
it does not necessarily follow that for  
lesbian women, that is also the case.  
To expect women to unite only around  
those limited issues of homosexuality  
is sexism itself.  

Heller was also accused of vot-  
ing against several fundraising ac-  
tivities that would clearly offend  
lesbian feminists. In one case, she  
voted against using the center's name  
in conjunction with an Anita Bryant  
look-alike contest to be held at a  
porn movie theater. She and Gerash  
are also accused of “engaging in a  
lengthy discussion" about whether the  
GCCC should accept money from an event  
sponsored by the Tobie Foundation.  
The Tobie awards, held every year,  
feature such award categories as  
“Whore of the year", "Bitch of the  
year", “Butchest bar of the year",—  
satire as a token to women, "Best women's  
are  

Gerash was also accused of speak-  
ing as a representative of the GCCC  
in favor of the boycotts of Florida  
orange juice and Coors beer. The  
“Privy council", which sets up the  
Tobie awards, informed Gerash of “ill-  
feelings" created by these public  
statements.  

While the recall allegations are  
fair game in pointing out the sexist  
politics of the people behind them,  
they also need to be examined as a  
purge attempt. The purge comes under  
the guise of the belief that the best  
politics are no politics and that all  
points of view are equally okay.

offered protection, . .  

The men who frequent the porno store  
seemed either afraid and/or ignorant  
of women. They saw nothing biologically  
unusual about a fifteen-inch dildo dis-  
appearing into a woman. They saw noth-  
ing strange about the lesbian films  
always including a man in the sex  
scenes. They believe what they read  
there: that all women are nymphos,  
want to be raped and abused, enjoy sex  
only for the man's pleasure. . .I  
could fill the page. Rather than con-  
front a real woman, they buy rubber  
vaginas, with or without fake pubic  
hair, life-size Cindy dolls, complete  
with orifices, tits, and blond hair.  
And they probably vote NO on issues of  
sex education.  

The men who bought porno were not  
depraved sorts; they were husbands and  
fathers, sons and little brothers.  

Some wore Brooks Brothers suits and  
carried attache cases, some held pub-  
lic office, some were cops. Many of  
them were daily customers. Many of  
them were kids, just over the legal  
age, hunting information, not thrills.  
Many were married men hunting a homo-  
sexual experience (they weren't 'queer'  
--the other guy was). All of them were  
men afraid or confused by the real  
world of sex, hiding in their respec-  
tive closets and aura of fantasy that  
surrounds the porno shop. I was sur-  
prised to find out just how intimidated  
by women men could be. But the know-  
ledge left me feeling uneasy, not pow-  
erful—people who feel threatened lash  
out, and I don't want to be a target.  

Why am I writing about men for a  
women's paper? Even a lesbian separa-  
tist can't ignore the fact that men  
influence the world women live in. I  
had a microscopic view of the fear of  
women that perpetuates rape and vio-  
lence against women. I don't personally  
believe that porno can be wiped out,  
any more than I believe prostitution  
is going to go out of business. But  
isolating myself in the women's commun-  
ity isn't going to make it go away. I  
intend to keep my eye on men and their  
inner sanctums to keep my consciousness  
alert as to where my oppression is  
coming from. Every movement has its  
spies.

Born Again  

(Editors' Note: The following  
statement was written by Cara Heller  
as her response to the recall meet-  
ing and to the feminist community.)  

The recall attempt has made me  
aware of how pathetically little  
consciousness or willingness to strug-  
gle with sexism most gay men possess.  
I've come to the conclusion that it's  
futile to try to raise their con-  
sciousness by working with them. But  
I also want to express a criticism  
of the feminist community before en-  
during the recall.  

The following is a personal state-  
ment about this and how it has af-  
fected me.  

I was glad to have the support I  
got from the feminist community. But  
I was also amazed that feminists  
would support me. The little con-  
tact I had with the feminist commun-  
ity while working with the GCCC was  
bewildering and painful. It was hard  
for me to understand why the women  
at both Big Mama Rag and Woman to  
Woman greeted me with apparent hos-  
tility. I felt that I was considered  
a traitor for working with a predom-  
inantly male organization.  

Sometimes I wonder why this exper-  
ience didn't turn me against feminism.  
I felt a bit strange about trying to  
defend women who seemed to want  
nothing to do with me. And I was hes-  
itant to get involved in feminist or-  
ganizations. Part of the reason I  
stayed with the GCCC as long as I did  
was that I felt I had nowhere else to  
go. When, during the recall attempt,  
many of the same women who had been  
so critical were suddenly supportive,  
I was afraid to trust it.  

However, now that I've resigned  
from the GCCC, I feel ready to begin  
an involvement with feminists. I know  
I don't want to go back to working  
only with gay men.
