Throughout the centuries,
Gypsies have learned to dis-
trust authorities and have
looked for strength and iden-
tity within their own group.
Their secretiveness about
the social and cultural organ-
ization necessary for their
survival has been incorpora-
ted into the prejudice that
defines them as dishonest
and uncooperative.

Today the world's 6.5 mil-
lion Gypsies are fighting for

from the Balkan regions dur-
ing the last century.

Gypsies have suffered a
long history of persecution.
In 1498 the German emperor
declared them outlaws, making
it legal to shoot them down
on mere sight. Rationales for
prejudice and persecution
then were no different from
those of today. Identifying
with their own descendant
group rather than with the
nations through which they
traveled marked them as po-
tentially subversive people.
Their nomadic lifestyle pro-
hibited their entrance into
accepted professions and left
them to invent their means of
livelihood through transient
and therefore "suspicious"
professions, such as petty
trade, entertainment and for-
tune telling. Hence, they
were seen as unwilling to ac-
cept the prevailing work
ethic.

During the Third Reich, the
Gypsies were among the groups
that became targets for geno-

round a quarter of a million
Gypsies were murdered here (in
Germany) & in various other
places during World War II.

The post-World War II poli-
tical boundaries have set
heavy restrictions on the
Gypsies' life and social org-
anization since, as nomads,
they have never defined them-
selves as belonging to one
nation or any form of struc-
tured state. Industrializa-
tion, urbanization and state
institutions which acknow-
ledge the individual only
when s/he belongs to a ‘recog-
nized nation have forced
many Gypsies to settle down
and integrate into other cul-
tures.

Today, Gypsies are still
seen as outlaws; legislation
requires them to register for
civil rights and recognition
as a distinct ethnic group in
the Soviet Union, the U.S.,
Canada, India and Western
Europe. In the Federal Repub-
lic of Germany, there are
around 60,000 Sinti and
20,000 Roma Gypsies. They
speak the same language,
"Romany," but differ in their
culture and religion. The
Sinti have been traveling in
and through German countries
since the early 15th century,
while the Roma first came

cide. The fascists saw them
as an inferior race and, be-
cause of their migratory
lifestyle, as a threat to
national security. In 1937
Gypsies had to register with
the Gestapo and by 1939, were
not allowed to leave their
designated area. By 1942 Gyp-
sies had the same status as
Jews and were transported to
the Auschwitz concentration
camp. About 30% of the Gyp-
sies in Germany were murdered
in camps. All together, a-

THERESIA SEIBLE
(Excerpted from Courage, West
German feminist monthly, May,
1981)

Three years ago, Theresia
Seible, a Sinti woman who had
been living in the U.S., re-
turned to West Germany. She
founded an organization there
called The Committee of the
Gypsies, which focuses on past
and present discrimination ag-
ainst Gypsy women. This is the
only international Sinti wom-
en's organization.

During the Third Reich, many
Gypsies were subjected to for-
ced sterilization, but until
today no court has recognized
this as bodily harm. The Sinti
tradition forbids men from
speaking of these atrocities
since these are taboo matters;
only women can talk about them.
The Committee of the Gypsies
can advise women on reparation
issues and be an advocate if
necessary.

Matters of reparation are
not the only concern of the
women's organization, however.
It deals also with education,
housing and healthcare. The
Sintezza (Sinti women) travel
at their own expense to all
the cities where families have
asked for their help. By now,
the organization is so well
recognized that Seible is cal-
led on to testify and advise
in court as well as to repre-
sent the Sinti in their deal-
ings with public institutions.

In addition, the Sinti wom-
en's organization meets with
women's groups; in fact, they
can belong to mutual
support networks that can be reduced.

Seible describes her own
experiences as a victim of
forced sterilization as fol-
lows:

Gypsy. It was under this
name that we were persecut-
ed. After Auschwitz they
wanted to call us Sinti;
they no longer labeled us
Gypsies because it was con-
sidered an abusive name. But
my people have been outlawed
and persecuted under this
name since the 16th century,
so I'm proud to be a Gypsy.
One should respect this
name. I am always quarreling
about this with members of
my race.

During the Nazi era, about
600 Gypsy families were liv-
ing around the Main River in
the vicinity of Würzburg.
They had tents in the quar-
ries or little campers
drawn by horses. Daddy was
a basketmaker and owned a
stand where he could sell
things. My mother was a
seamstress. Everything chan-

Discrimination Against Gypsy Women —

ged in 1937 when the police
came and ordered us to go
to Würzburg to be registered.
By that time, they had al-
ready got at the Jews. We
witnessed them being taken
from their houses, but we
didn't think they would get
at us because a Gypsy never
mixes in politics. We knew
that we were next when we
were made to register and
told that we were no longer
allowed to work independent-
ly. We had to sign a state-
ment saying that we would
work in factories producing
uniforms and weapons. Those
who were performers had to
be available to work for
Kraft durch Freude (Strength
Through Happiness, the
Nazi cultural program). This
was one of the reasons why
they couldn't let us so eas-
ily disappear—many of us
were too well-known.

But that didn't stop them
from sterilizing us. In
1939, after we got Berufs-
verbot (a German term for
prohibiting one's freedom
to practice), I had to make
myself available to the Nazis for
research. I had to sign a
paper stating that I wouldn't
have any sexual rela-
tions with men and would
not get pregnant. But I re-
ally wanted to have a child!
A thousand thoughts crossed
my mind. What could I do? I
would go crazy afterwards?
I had no idea what they want-
ed to do to me. I was 19 at
the time and working as a
dancer in the theater.

I was afraid, but I was al-
so enraged that I was not
able to defend myself, to
scream this injustice out
loud! All this was suppres-
sed. So I decided to have a
child, for if I didn't sur-
vive, at least the family
would have a child, a Gypsy
child. This was considered
a crime, because I had sign-
ed a statement at the Gest-
apo office.

About two months later they

detected that I was carrying
twins. They wanted me to
have an abortion, but then
they said the pregnancy had
progressed too far and they
would make an exception for
me since I had not been pre-
viously convicted. But I re-
ceived no medical care nor
the supplementary rations
that other mothers got.

Because I was terrified
and had nothing to eat, the
children were born in the 8th
month. I was not allowed to
see them after they were
born; all they would tell me
was that I had had two girls.
When I finally got to see
them, five days later, they
were very skinny.

At that time they were
transporting the last re-
maining Gypsies to Auschwitz.
I was afraid that my family
would get to the camp before
me and then I would be trans-
ported all by myself with
the two children. So on the
7th day I took my children
and escaped from the hospi-
tal. I could hardly walk. Two
days later the Gestapo came
for my family. We all went,
including my two children,
who were now registered as
Rolanda and Rita Winterstein.

Because they said my child-
ren were undernourished,
in the hospital I was not
allowed to see them. At that
time it had turned out that they
were using people for re-
search. After a month I
could no longer endure it.
Perhaps I had a hunch. So I
went to the hospital and de-
manded to see my children.
The nurse was very evasive.
She then brought me Rita.
“Where is Rolanda?" I asked.
Finally she told me that Ro-
landa was in the bathroom.
There she was in a bed with
a small wreath around her.
I couldn't cry at all. I
grabbed the nurse's neck and
squeezed her. Then I ran in-
to Rita's room, wrapped her
in my coat and raced outside.
One month later, they told
me I was to be sterilized.
I hadn't even recovered
from the pregnancy yet. They
took me to the university
hospital along with 2 Russian
women, 4 Gypsy women and my
little 12-year-old cousin. I
was a physical and nervous
wreck. I thought, if they
cut me now, while I am still
raw everywhere, I won't sur-
vive. The Gestapo made the
physicians perform the ster-
ilization in their presence
to ensure that it was carried
out.

Complications arose after
the operation. A Gestapo stu-
dent had left a small pair of
tweezers in my left side.
There had been an air raid
warning during the operation,
so he had sewn me up as
quickly as possible. I had
ongoing infections. After
1968 I could no longer walk
upright. A tumor the size of
a child's head had developed.

Years later I received
6000 marks (about $2500) as
compensation, but they then
went and deducted 4000 marks
from it. They claim that the
deduction equals the amount
of welfare benefits which I
had received years ago. Yet
I only received welfare for
a brief time after the war.
What angers me is that the
same office which paid for me
to be sterilized now refuses
to pay me my full compensa-
tion.

I'll just never be able
to understand that—they paid
for our infertility, they
paid a social worker to es-
cort us to Auschwitz to make
sure that every last child
got gassed. Where is the jus-
tice? In the newspapers they
write that Gypsies are aso-
cial and that they are a bur-
den to the welfare office.
Why don't they just give us
the money we are entitled to?

In 1953 I was summoned to
Würzburg for a check-up so
they could estimate how much
disability insurance I was
entitled to receive. At
first I didn't want to go,
because the same people as
during the war are judges
and prosecutors. As I entered
the State Health Office, I
met the man from the Gestapo
who had been present during
my sterilization. Today he
has a leading position with
the health office. I said
to him, "You were present at
my sterilization and you
want to estimate the damage
done to me!" Then I grabbed
the first thing I could, an
inkpot, and threw it at him.
They charged me 20 marks for
his glasses.

After being recognized by
the state as a persecutee, I
requested reparations for
Rita, who suffers from blood
disorders. Our request for
reparation on the grounds
that she had suffered damage
as a fetus and had been
used for research purposes,
was turned down in 1960. We
first received word of the
rejection, however, in 1979.
The wording read about like
