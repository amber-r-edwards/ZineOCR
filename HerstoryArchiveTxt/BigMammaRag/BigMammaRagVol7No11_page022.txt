Relationships

body, that by that experience you've
formed some sort of bond that wasn't
there before.

Lori: But I don't think that's
always the point of sex either--I
think that's true lots--and sex im-
plies a certain intimacy that can

be threatening--but there are emo-
tional levels that don't necessarily
result in sex that can be equally
threatening to a relationship. It's
not necessarily the point of sex.

Eileen: But it is the point of sex.
It's continually the point of sex--
that's the way it's continually ex-
pressed. Women say, I could deal
with anything else, until she slept
with X.

Lori: But I don't think that it's the
sex.
Judy: I think it's the romanticism.

I'd feel more threatened if Lori

had an intense romantic involvement
than I would if she just had sex
with someone.

Lori: Friendly sex would be okay.
Connie: I think that sex is much
more complicated than that. I can't
think of a single casual sexual rel-
ationship I've had that was success-
ful.

Vicki: What I see as the problem,
whether you're relating to three
women or one woman, is feeling neg-
ated. I would get jealous when I
saw the person I was relating to,
not by the being involved with some-
one else—that I didn't see as neg-
ation—but when I was no longer con-
sidered as part of decisions, when
before, all along we had considered
each other.
That's where the hurt would come
from. In situations where I was
given the respect I had formerly
been given, I would not feel jeal-
ous. It's like getting ignored.
A very disrespectful thing to
do.

Kate: But I don't think that dis-
respect is inherent in nonmonogamy,
though it is easy to fall into.

Vicki: But when it happens, it's
my primary source of jealousy.

Eileen: But in fact, if we were
perfect beings, we wouldn't be
jealous at all. Jealousy is some-
thing we learn and something that's
continually reinforced by the soc-
iety.

Lori: Jealousy is possessiveness.
People have the idea that you have to
be jealous to keep the love relation-
ship going—to stimulate it. Like,
if you have a bad relationship, one
thing you can do to get your lover
back with you is make her jealous.

Vicki: But you can feel jealous,
even without a sexual relationship.

Eileen: But, jealousy never does
you any good. If you're to a point
where you're going to lose someone,
getting jealous would help you keep
them. And if you're not to that
point, jealousy poisons things. I
don't think it ever helps things,
just makes them worse. I think it's
more realistic to tell your lover
how you're feeling about the sit-
uation. If you feel your needs are
not being met, you can tell your
lover that: A) this is making me
miserable and, B) if you think I'm
going to be miserable interminably,
you're crazy and, so, C)...

Connie: That implies a real power
imbalance to me.

Eileen: It doesn't because I think
there sometimes comes a point where
the situation is intolerable. I
think it's really self-destructive
to continue in an intolerable sit-
uation because you're trying to
save it.

Judy: Not if you really believe it
can be better. Sometimes your lover
might be into something so intense
she doesn’t have a lot of control.

Eileen: That's purely romantic.
You always have control.

Then I would get jealous.

Lori: I still don't know how I feel
about nonmonogamy. In a lot of ways
I don't see how it would work. Time-
wise, there's a problem. Also,

the Denver feminist community is

so small. And getting involved with
someone without any politics in so
delicate a situation as nonmonogamy
is really stupid. At least with a
political woman you have a greater
chance that she'll behave ethically.
And struggling that much around
ideologies of relationships is a
political issue.

Connie: I guess what concerns me the
most about maintaining a monogamous
relationship right now with someone
whom I consider a political peer is
that we'll come to identify each
other with political struggle so

much that it will be difficult to
relate to each other beyond that.
Sometimes I think we signify struggle
to each other, and that's just real
exhausting.

Judy: I think relationships are a
struggle, just by their nature.

Vicki: I guess, maybe, when I say
I'm committed to a monogamous rel-
ationship, I mean that I will not
run when the struggle comes up, when
it ceases to be all fun and games.
It's that commitment to see things
through. I think in nonmonogamy,
women do run at the slightest sign
of trouble. And I think that means
that they're not dealing with some-
thing in themselves.

Eileen: But can't you have committed
nonmonogamous relationships?

Vicki: We have a hard enough time
in small groups of women building
trust, even on a non-intimate level
—to count on each other and support
each other and be family—to be
committed. We can't even do that

in our small working groups. If we
can't do it on that level, how can
we do it intimately? I'm not

saying it's not important to try for
that. My ideals I don't think I'll
ever see. I cannot live an ideal
when no one else is living it.

Eileen: That's like saying I have
to be racist because the society is
racist. Just because the dominant
culture upholds monogamy, doesn't
mean we have to fall into it.

Vicki: The dominant culture is
saying the right way is role-de-
fined relationships. That's how
they define monogamy. I am approach-
ing it from a very different per-
spective than that and I don't see
that as being inherently bad. I see
it as being ultimately freeing.

Eileen: Define monogamy.

Vicki: Just to prep it, you mentioned

that it's like not working with racism.

I have discovered that I am no longer
willing to work on things with women
who are not being honest about their
work on it. I will no longer work
with women on racism who are just
doing it to prove how nonracist they
are. Monogamy, as I see it right now,
is a commitment—a commitment to one
other woman at this point, who I feel
is coming from pretty much the same
basis as me. We have spent some time,
and it does take time, to work through
things and to see how each other deal
with situations around being honest.

I spent a long time alone finding out
what I need, becoming independent,
finding out that my survival is not
dependent on another person. I feel
my commitment is not a dependence on
Connie to take care of me. My commit-
ment is to see us grow in all ways
possible. And we also have a commit-
ment to be honest, to communicate, to
be clear of our motives, to do all
these things. I think that's really
rare. And since Connie had those same
commitments, I’m not willing to take
the chance on another woman who might
not have the same intentions.

Kate: I see a difference between the
definition of monogamy and primary
relationships.
Monogamy says you are the most
important thing in my life

above all my other friends, above my
politics, above my job, above how I

spend my spare time, above everything—
And I see a pri-

mary relationship as something that
will exist for a time and may change—
it may be what you need for a while,
but I don't think you should say, I'll
always be here.

Connie: I see myself as nonmonogamous because I have primary commitments to many things. Time is a real question.

Eileen: I think in a monogamous rel-
ationship, the relationship is more
important than anything. Monogamous
relationships, therefore, inhibit

growth because if you grow, you may grow

apart. Your interests might become

different, you would wind up with noth-

ing to talk about. In monogamous
relationships, people tend to either
get into what their lovers are into
or discourage their interest in these
things. So I see monogamous rel-
ationships as inhibiting.

Vicki: Then I would not say that
we have a monogamous relationship.

Pat: Maybe we shouldn't use the word
anymore, maybe we should say a
committed relationship.

...that was something that we could
see.

the restrictions, reports Gold, is
that Medicaid recipients in states
where abortion funds are withheld
are two weeks later in obtaining
abortions than other women.

"We hypothesize that women are
delaying to find money to pay for
abortions, although the COC esti-
mates that every week of delay
increases a woman's risk of dying
by 50%, and her chance of compli-
cations by 30-50%," said Gold.

One case of a woman unable to
come up with money for the pro-
cedure was reported by the National
Abortion Federation (NAF) recently.
A call coming in the NAF hotline
was from a Kansas woman, 22 weeks
pregnant and desperately seeking
an abortion.

There are only two facilities in
Kansas which provide abortions,
and neither provides the service
at 22 weeks. The woman was urged
to travel to New York or Georgia.

"The woman called us every single
day," said Uta Landy, executive di-
rector of NAF. “We found a clinic
which would adjust her fees to
almost nothing, but still she'd
have to travel several hundred
miles...She said she was selling
her furniture, she said her welfare
check was coming next Wednesday.

It was clear she was running out
of time...

"Finally, she wasn't able to come
up with the money," said Landy.

"We called her a week later. She
seemed to be on drugs, resigned to
having the child."

There is no reliable information
on the number of illegal abortions
being performed. But it is clear
that in some parts of the country,
poor and third world women are
being placed in desperate situa-
tions.

Last January, when Landy went to
South Carolina to investigate a
suspected illegal abortion, she
found the victim too frightened to
talk, but stumbled upon still an-
other case.

A black single mother in her late
20's pleaded with the only hospital
in Columbia, S.C., which provides
abortions. When federal funds were
available, the hospital, in the
State's capital city, performed
only nine abortions a week. Cur-
rently, hospital personnel do al-
most none. They turned a deaf ear
to the woman's pleas, and she
turned to the streets. She al-
most bled to death after a $100
kitchen table abortion.

The attacks against abortion are
coming primarily from a small,
highly organized group. Backed by
the Roman Catholic Church, evan-

evangelical groups, and increasingly
the new right, right-to-lifers
have at times mobilized thousands
to march against those whom they
call "baby-killers."

The Catholic Church hierarchy
continues to be a powerful lobby
against pro-choice forces, despite
the widespread backing for choice
on abortion among churchgoers.

"The Catholic Church has one of
the best grassroots organizations,"
Kissling said. “They see every-
body once a week. Legislators
are fearful that (it) can call out
the troops."

Increasingly, evangelistic groups
and right-wing organizations are
getting on the anti-abortion band-
wagon. Rhonda Copelon of New York
City's Center for Constitutional
Rights had called the alliance
between the right-to-life movement
and the right wing a powerful
“interlocking directorship,” char-
acterizing a movement that has the
potential of becoming the McCarthy-
ism of the 1980's."

Among the groups which support
"right-to-life" are the Ku Klux
Klan, the John Birch Society, the
Christian Crusade, and the Nation-
al States Rights Party.

"The new right," according to
Pat Gavett of the Religious Coal-
ition for Abortion Rights, “has
focused on specific issues as a
technique for increasing their
power. The issues they choose
are emotional issues. They in-
clude ERA, anti-gun control,
busing...and the hottest issue of
all, abortion. Those issues tend
to produce core groups of advocacy
who will be single-issue voters.”

"It's really the liberation of women
that's at stake," Landy argued. "It's
working women, the whole changing of
roles, the ability of women to decide
to stay home and have children or not
that's at issue.”

ARAW showed that more women are be-
ginning to see this issue more clearly
and are actively supporting reproduc-
tive rights. According to Kissling, a
significant development of the week was
the number of rank-and-file labor
women who joined the local planning,
“expanding the abortion rights con-
stituency.”

Similarly, Rothbart saw that the
coalition of groups who worked together
such as the ACLU, the Coalition of
Labor Union Women, the National Alli-
ance of Black Feminists, and Religious
Leaders for a Free Choice, was in it-
self a concrete gain from the week.
