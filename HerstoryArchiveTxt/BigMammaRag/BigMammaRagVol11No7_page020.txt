Jocal’s women’s committee and is a founding member  
of the Denver Coalition of Labor Union Women.  

By standing up to this attack, Goodman is in the  
forefront of the fight not only to defend the rights of  
women workers and workers with ideas different  
from their bosses, but also to defend the existence of  
the union movement itself.  

Statements of Support  

“We support Sally Goodman’s position that  
she should be allowed to perform her duties as  
an ‘A’ electrician without any interference or  
harassment by the Defense Investigative Service.”  

Bob Killian  
President, UAW Local 766  

Lloyd Trujillo  

Chairman, Bargaining Committee  
UAW Local 766  

President, Colo. UAW CAP Council  

“Central Denver NOW supports the efforts  
of Sally Goodman to hold a job as an electrician  
with a security clearance at Martin Marietta  
without being harassed for her political affiliation  
and/or sexual preference. Her basic  
constitutional rights guarantee her privacy with  
regard to these rights.”  

Resolution passed on May 4, 1983 by the  
Central Denver chapter of the National  
Organization for Women.  

Political Rights Defense Fund  

The Political Rights Defense Fund (PRDF) is a  
national organization established in 1973 to mobilize  
support and raise funds for a lawsuit filed by the  
Socialist Workers Party and the Young Socialist  
Alliance. This lawsuit challenges the 40-year-long  
campaign of the FBI and other government agencies  
to spy on, harass, and disrupt the two socialist groups.  
It is a fundamental challenge to the government’s  
claimed “right” to use so-called national security as a  
basis to go after individuals and organizations whose  
ideas and activities it doesn’t like. PRDF has also  
taken up the cases of other victims of the government’s  

unconstitutional efforts to curtail political rights.  
PRDF has joined UAW Local 766 to help defend  
Sally Goodman, and the right of all unionists to be  
free from government spying, “investigation,” and  
victimization.
