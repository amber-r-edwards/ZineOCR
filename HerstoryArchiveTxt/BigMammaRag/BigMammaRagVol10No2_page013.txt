Saxe Targeted In Prison Drug Raid

(Edited from an article by
Jill Clark in Gay Community
News)

Two hundred state troopers
and prison guards converged
on Framingham (Mass.) State
Prison during the night of
Tues., Jan. 5, as part of

prisons

what officials call the
largest coordinated law en-
forcement operation in the
state's history.

Prison officials declared
a state of emergency in the
minimum security prison for
over 30 hours while they
searched the prison for evi-
dence of organized narcotics
trafficking and gambling.
All 170 women inmates at the
prison were prevented from
communicating with anyone
outside the prison, includ-
ing their attorneys, from
2 a.m. on Jan. 6 until the
next afternoon.

All 34 male inmates were
moved at 4 a.m. to other
state prisons, including the
maximum security facility in
Walpole, Mass.

The raid, according to
Middlesex County Assistant

District Attorney Peter Agnes,

is a part of a five-state

directory.

effort to crack down on or-
ganized crime. Agnes said
that the D.A.'s office has
reason to believe that in-
mates have used the facil-
ity's computer room for nar-
cotics and sports betting
operations.

Early reports claimed the
"ring leader" of the alleged
narcotics and gaming activity
was Susan Saxe, anti-war act-
ivist convicted seven years
ago of felony-murder for her
involvement in a bank rob-
bery in 1970. Saxe has been
instrumental in the develop-
ment of the computer train-
ing program.

However, at a Jan. 6 press
conference, police and prison
officials and spokespersons
for the D.A. refused to com-
ment on whether Saxe was a-
mong those being investigated.
"I don't want to prejudice
the case," said Agnes.

Nancy Gertner, attorney for
Saxe, described the actions
of the 230 police and guards
on January 6 as "gestapo
tactics."

According to Gertner, Saxe
said that the police entered
the rooms of the women in-
mates at 3 a.m., stripped
back the bedding and forced
them to walk to a large room
with other women to be
searched in the presence of

male officers. They were
forced to stand there for
hours, some naked or parti-
ally clothed, Saxe told
Gertner. Some inmates were

forced to stand outside in
the cold. Women were not
allowed to use a toilet for
so long that one woman urin-
ated on the floor.

Local prisoners’ rights
activists are furious that
Saxe's name was mentioned in
the press in connection with
the alleged drug and gambling
operation. Some activists

stated that it is "ridiculously
out of character" for Saxe
to be involved in drug deal-
ing or gambling.

"They searched her room and
found nothing," said Berna
Errenson of Gertner's office.
"If she was accused of smug-
gling yogurt into the prison
I'd believe it, but Susan
doesn't do drugs or even
drink wine. She doesn't even
smoke cigarettes."

"Susan has very consistently
involved herself in activ-
ities which help the women in
the prison," said Jean Fox of
Aid to Incarcerated Mothers,
an organization which Saxe
helped found.

Priscilla Howell of the
Boston Bail Fund suspects
that Saxe's name was used to
ensure that the raid got
front-page publicity. She
noted that the district att-
orney is up for re-election
this year.

Howell also suspects that
this is an attack on the com-
puter-training program it-
self, which, she said, all-
owed the prisoners involved
in it more autonomy and self-
respect than prison officials

were comfortable with.

Agnes refused to comment
about the number of inmates
being investigated, but said
that five persons on the
"outside" have been arrested.
He said that 275 bags of a
substance believed to be
heroin, two weapons, almost

$10,000 in cash and two auto-
mobiles have been seized in
connection with the alleged
drug trafficking.

Agnes said that electronic
surveillance was used inside
the prison to gather evidence.
He said that evidence of in-
mates' involvement in drug
trafficking and gaming will
be turned over to the grand
jury in the week of Jan. 11.

One law enforcement official
said that the inability of
correction officials to
unlock the door to the com-
puter room had been the sub-
ject of complaints to the
Correction Department offi-
cials for several years.

Since training to use the
computer takes a long period
of time, only those prisoners
with longer sentences are in-
volved with the enterprise
"Computer Systems." Most of
the inmates employed by the
enterprise were male.

Richard Quillen, one of
the 34 inmates relocated on
Jan. 6 (but not kept incom-
municado), told reporters
that he is "shocked... and
I'm sure Susan Saxe is just
as shocked as the rest of us."

He also expressed concern
about the customers of the
computer enterprise. "We were
doing work for the Department
of Labor and CETA in New Bed-
ford and Brockton. Now it's
just lost."
