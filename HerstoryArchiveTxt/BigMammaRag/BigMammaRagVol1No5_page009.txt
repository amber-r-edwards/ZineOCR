For Everyone! Call

Precious  
(Being of course, Women)  
By Wate S.

I guess I owe you for a  
helluva lot, like freeing me  
from literally endless preen-  
ing and grooming and double-  
check sniffs to my armpits-  
and skirts I couldn't move in  
couldn't run in if I had to  
(end sometimes I did), and  
freeing me from fucks in the  
back of cars and indebted  
fucks for dinner and a movie,  
for being like me and not  
making me have to scream to  
be heard and completely give  
up on being understood, for  
teaching me slowly, in-  
finitely, patiently all the  
things I had to learn, un-  
learn, relearn, and rearrange  
in the proper perspective...  
everything from how to be  
angry, to how to care, to how  
to say no, to how to put up  
drywall, to how to be honest,  
to how to change a tire, to  
how to grow a garden, to how  
to make sense of things and  
of course to how to say yes!  
For giving me back all the  
orgasms I'd lost over the  
years, for curing my acute  
and almost fatal case of  
tactophobia, for ridding me  
of the guilt of not being  
voluptuous and seductive, for  
ridding me of the shame of my  
"monthly curse", for ridding  
me of my sense of obligation  
toward raising a family,  
feeding a horny, demanding,  
insensitive, egotistical,  
breadwinner, and making the  
colors in the carpet and the  
curtains match, for giving me  
more loved ones than ever I  
would have acquired in a house  
with a two-car garage or  
possibly would have acquired  

in the state institution  
living in that house might  
well have led me to, for  
allowing, indeed encouraging  

me to feel the full spectrum  
of human and exclusively fe-  
male emotion, and for beings  
much like me that I could give  
you back all those things in  
return and keep the whole  

thing moving.

WHY I DROPPED OUT OF THE MILITIA  
Revolutions make people bleed.  
I don't wanna bleed.  -Alta  

the world  
upside down in a raindrop  
with the sun at the bottom  

enchanted  

spell the swell sister  
kiss the drop  

drink the world  

tree branches burn  
into watery blue  
sky eye sun stares  

the power  

from that star is yours  
or mine or ours or  

you or me  

we  

are the water witches  

the fire air earth witches  
women of all elements  

we breathe  

magic

A FAIRY TELL  

H.W.  
Once upon a tell  

Lived a cindered Cinderella  

Met her stepmother Ella  

And two sickly sisterellas.  
Cinderella scrubbed like hella  

(And she scrubbed herself as wella).  
She was very beautatella  

But we'll leave her to hersella  

And tell about the princel.  

In this land there lived a princel  

Who was strong and bold and richel,  
Though he walked with quite a swishel,  
He was still a hansel princel  

But a little feminincel.  

Now his Dad the Great Loud Kingle  
Guessed why his son was single  

So he planned a big shebangle  

With women, wine, and fandangle.  

At first the son did laugh and scoff.  
Then he starts to choke and cough  
And flip his wrist an awful loff.  
Papa wanted him married off!  

Throughout the land the news did tell,  
And Cinderella heard the tell  

There was to be a gay ballella  

(She never listened very wella and  

She knew this prince was quite a fellah).  
But she needed a husband desperella  
So she called her fairy godmorella.  
They planned to trap the fair princella,

Two Carrots  

in the sink  
in one toward the drain  
the water recedes.  

Just pieces of carrots  

of the same carrot peels  

Peeled, sliced, quartered,  
diced.  

Until only their color defines  
them  

Left in the can alone after the  
vegetable soup was heated,  
rinsed out into quiet  
corners of the sink  
from where they floated to-  

gether  
and touched.  

Then cleaved to each other  

-down the drain.
