A Lesbian Feminist: TOP PRIORITY IS

POLITICAL THEORY,
ANALYSIS OF PATRIARCHY

Jackie Doan, who is a third
ident and a mother of two
active in several feminist
groups in Denver. Most recently
a member of the Lesbian/Gay
Legal Workers.

Jackie: I was raised in a tradi-
tional Catholic family, the young-
est of three daughters, in a working
class area of suburban Washington,
D.C. When I graduated from a Cath-
olic high school in 1963 I was a
kind of "JFK-Peace Corps-equal jus-
tice to all" kind of liberal. You
know, the secular missionary type.
I was a scholarship student at
Georgetown University, where I first
made contact with "radicals," who
were activists in the civil rights
movement. Later, I became a leader
in the university’s “community ac-
tion program" (tutoring kids in the
ghetto, etc.) and later an activist
in the Student Peace Union, which
later became SDS-identified.
However, in 1967, my life changed
and my politics evolved outside the
academic walls. That was the year I
married into an interracial family,
and moved to Brooklyn where I taught
school by day, and attended college
by night. My own family had re-
jected me entirely because of my mar-
riage, and my husband's family,
which itself had an old leftist back-
ground and political commitment,
had a tremendous influence on my
everyday life. During the following
year my son was born and I kept
touch with politics mostly through
underground newspapers and in organ-
izing a tenants union where I lived.
Then in 1969 an old college friend
traveling from Boston to D.C.
stopped by and brought with her some
new “subversive” feminist publica-
tions from Female Liberation in
Boston. (No More Fun & Games,
Female Revolution)

BMR: What effect did those publica-
tions have on you at that time?
Jackie: As Betty Friedan would say,
"It changed my life!" At that time
I was a teacher of Black and Puerto
Rican history in the Ocean Hill-
Brownsville experimental school dis-
trict. I was trying to make sense
of the culture shock I was experienc-
ing, and was realizing that my ef-
forts at "social change in the class-
room were much more effective working
in a reactionary Catholic school
than in Ocean Hill. I was learning
to respect other people's needs and
differences, and to look to my own
situation as a woman and a mother
for a more compelling understanding
of oppressions.

BMR: Were you doing other things at
this time besides teaching?
Jackie: Some of the teachers at my
school got together with other wo-
men and formed a consciousness rais-
ing group; we just did it. It was
one of the early ones—not sponsored
by any organization or anything.
During the next year and a half I
read everything I could and began
to appreciate women as never before.

WOMEN WHO ARE TRYING TO
FIND SOME NICE SOCIALIST
FEMINIST MIDDLE-GROUND ARE
MAKING A MISTAKE

BMR: What happened when you came
to Denver?
Jackie: I came to Denver in 1971
with a toddler, a newborn daughter,
and a husband. I immediately joined
a CR group here, was pursuing psycho-
logy in a personal and political
sense, and separated from my husband
six months later. I was involved
with anti-war groups here in Denver
briefly in 1972, and then put most of
my energy into Big Mama Rag. Since
that time I've become a lesbian fem-
inist, and have done writing, speak-
ing, and organizing in feminist pro-
jects here, mostly through BUR, the
Colorado Feminist Federal Credit
Union (CFFCU), and the Rachele Yas-
meen Defense Fund. I've also been
going to law school and intend to
graduate this June.

BMR: Since you know some of the his-
tory of BMR, tell me, weren't the
women who started the paper both
socialist and heterosexual? Has
that changed?
Jackie: The women who started BMR
were radicals, in the sense of being
interested in political and social
revolution. Most had previous exper-
ience working with the male Left, and
were evolving a kind of reaction to
that experience. We saw those very
men as part of the problem and we
wanted to work separately. Few of
these women had a real commitment to
socialist ideology, although no one
actually rejected that ideology either.
However, a couple of the women
did leave the paper on principle
in its early days to pursue Marxist-
Leninism, and the rest of us stayed to
try to publish a feminist newspaper.
The issue over which they left was
whether BMR should take an ad from a
store which was run by the followers
of Guru Maharaji. They felt we
shouldn't because the group was reac-
tionary, bourgeois, and sucking po-
litical energy out of people. The
rest of us reacted to their position
as being typically narrow leftist
purism crap, and we focused on want-
ing the only radical feminist insti-
tution in Denver at that time to
survive. I think the significance
of the event was that it solidified
our growing commitment to feminism
as a political priority, and our
willingness to be criticized by the
Left, if necessary, to do that.

BMR: Were all these women you're
talking about heterosexual? How
did the paper become lesbian-identi-
fied?
Jackie: With the exception of
Maureen Mrizek and Chocolate Waters,
everyone else was straight, celibate,
or enjoying flirtations with lesbian-
ism. By 1974 energy on the paper
was at an all-time low. Then with
the help of a foundation grant, the
involvement of both straight women and
lesbians led to BMR's Great Lesbian
Controversy later that year. The
straight women on the paper had to
deal with lesbians at the same
time that a big, vocal lesbian
separatist community developed.
The lesbians were voicing their dykiest and being totally un-
compromising, if not uncommunicative,
with the straight women, who were
either limiting their involv-
ement, feeling defensive, or saying
very little at all. By late Spring
two straight women remained on the
paper. This "split" simply rein-
forced the belief among the les-
bians that the women who are really
committed and have their energies to-
gether are the lesbians because
the straight women are all pouring
their energies into men and into
resisting lesbianism, as the natural
evolution of feminism. While the
position of the lesbians was, ad-
mittedly, chauvinistic, at the same
time through self-definition, the
paper's staff had more positive
energy and the paper itself improved
as never before. Since that time,
many other women have worked on BUR,
probably 90% of them lesbians.

BMR: Wasn't there some kind of con-
frontation between the lesbian ten-
inist community and the Left com-
munity about that time?
Jackie: Yes. BMR applied to the
Denver Sustaining Fund (which at
that time was left-oriented) for a
grant to start a women's bookstore.
There was a community meeting with
the DSF board, which was attended
by about 50 lesbian feminists and a
smaller number of community leftists
at which one of the Left women
spoke up saying BMR shouldn't get
the grant because it was too les-
bian-oriented and turned off the
working class. The working class
lesbians among us in particular
got angry, we all walked out, and
BMR responded with a full-page
spread the next issue, as one final
"goodbye" to the new Left.

BMR: Why hasn't there been more
cooperation and communication
between feminists and Leftists?
Jackie: For one thing, on a person-
al basis, feminists remember the
subtle power plays and sexual games
that went on in the Left, and many
have been personally insulted by
women and men who once considered
them "comrades." The deference to
male power and opinion is very real
in the Left, and I think it's still
going on. Even in leftist feminist
groups, even if the men themselves
aren't there, their ghosts and
heroes are. Women who are operating
under a strict Marxist ideology
evaluate themselves by what Marx-
ists (mostly men) have done in the
past, and use those standards to
measure political progress and
strategies now.

BMR: What about differences? What
about socialist/feminists?
Jackie: I think the political dif-
ferences are real—this is not just
an old personal hassle. I think that
women who are trying to find some
nice "socialist feminist" middle-
ground are making a mistake. It's
premature because feminist political
theory is young, and to try to "mar-
ry" it with socialism at this point
in time, would cause the Left to
tack “women" onto its particular
list of oppressed peoples, and that
would be that. Case closed.

Yes, while I think that
it's very important that feminists
develop a deeper understanding of
the impact of world-wide (not just
American) communism, (as well as
capitalism); at the same time, I
don't see that as a priority for
the women's movement. I think the
top priority for feminists is the
development of a political history
and analysis of patriarchy. By pa-
triarchy, I mean that system—
intellectual, political, social, sex-
ual, psychological—which requires
in the name of human progress that
one group (in the history of the
world, rich, white men) controls
and exploits the energies of anoth-
er, and in which women are particu-
larly despised. It includes pa-
triarchal institutions (heterosex-
uality, the nuclear family, private
property, etc.) which are the tools
of oppression as well as the patri-
archal mind-constructs which, like
capitalist mind-constructs, limit
even our ability to think beyond
what is. This is what we must
analyze. The significance of what
feminism could mean in the history
of the world is completely discount-
ed by relegating feminism to "fight-
ing sexism." Feminists are just
beginning to really understand sex-
ism, and all of its implications go
far beyond fighting for democratic
rights for women. It's essential
that more and more people are
brought into the feminist frame
of reference.

BMR: I had been told before I came
here tonight that you were a so-
cialist feminist.
Jackie: I see feminism as qualita-
tively different than socialism.
The reason why some people may
think I'm a socialist feminist is
because I don't reject a lot of the
ideas of the Left—such as the signi-
ficance of materialism and class
consciousness in affecting revo-
lutionary development. Although I
am a feminist and believe in anti-
profit redistribution of wealth, I
don't label myself a socialist fem-
inist.

BMR: It sounds like you think that
women inherently can create a
better economic system. Don't you
have criticism of the women's move-
ment for having a predominantly
white and petit bourgeois back-
ground?
Jackie: I don't have criticism of
the movement for being that. That's
where the movement came from, and
I don’t think you can criticize
people for what they are. However,
I do have criticism about women's
resistance to developing class
consciousness. Some of it is un-
willingness; some of it is ignor-
ance. I see less in the more radi-
cal women's organizations than in
the reformist organizations. And
the women's movement is much weaker
for not pushing to understand the
pervasive influence of the class
system. Also I don't believe wo-
men are necessarily going to create
an egalitarian, classless, woman-
valued utopia. Women are a product
of patriarchal socialization also,
and subject to the same limitations.
It's not simply biology. It's also
a matter of experience. The ex-
periences we hold most in common—
growing up girls, becoming the wife,
lover, of a man, and motherhood—
have given us a unique perspective
on the world. If we get out—

A LESBIAN IS THE ANTITHESIS
OF PATRIARCHY’S CONCEPT OF
WOMAN. WE ARE THE BAD-
ASSED NIGGERS OF WOMAN-
HOOD.

Outside those experiences, we can un-
derstand the oppression of women
in a context which has been sup-
pressed throughout the history of
the world. At the same time, if we
acknowledge and allow what we do not
have in common as women (race,
class, sexual, language, cultural
differences) we may begin to under-
stand and analyze the divisions
among us which have been created
by patriarchy.

BMR: I noticed you label yourself
a lesbian feminist. Why that la-
bel and not some other?
Jackie: Because the lesbian label
strikes fear in me and reassures me
at the same time. A lesbian
is the antithesis of patriarchy's
concept of woman. We are a fear-
some bunch—the bad-ass niggers
of womanhood. I fear that in my-
self, and I love it at the same
time. The image (label) reassures
me that, yes, we are different—
and it's our very difference which
is our strength. Our very exis-
tence offends society, although
our existence alone isn't enough.

BMR: You see being a lesbian
as much more than a sexual prefer-
ence—it is a political statement.
Jackie: Right, but a sexy politi-
cal statement. They'd like it to
be just a sexual preference, just
like they like us to be just fight-
ing sexism. As a revolutionary
group we have to ask what makes a
revolutionary, what motivates pe-
ople to change. From a Marxist
point of view, the answer would
probably be—material conditions.
Right now we don't have a clear
understanding of the psychological
or spiritual basis. In fact, from
an historical perspective, I think
we are in a period of challenging
the idea of what it is to be a wo-
man, of ridding ourselves of old
concepts without becoming like men.
I think the women's movement is
greatly preoccupied with these
questions of self, and I wish we'd
get on with developing more social
concepts of women in groups. It's
new to women's concept of self to
think in terms of politics, groups,
and power and self-government. I
