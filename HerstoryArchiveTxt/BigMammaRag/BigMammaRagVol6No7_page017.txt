Susan Colson, Baba Yaga  
sstris

During the last two evenings in May,

Denver women were treated to the jazzy  
songs that Baba Yaga, a band out of  
Portland, plays so well. In Russian  
folklore, Baba Yaga was a witch and  
herbal healer; a woman who was both  
compassionate and competent; and as  
we witnessed last month, the Russian  
translates into English as pure energy.

On the afternoon before their last  
performance at the Velvet Hammer, I  
talked to band members Bonnie Koval-  
eff and Patti Vincent about jazz, the  
collective, and how those work together  
to produce the incredible enthusiasm  
that is Baba Yaga. The group began four  
years ago as a workshop for women  
interested in jazz; and with the support  
of the Portland women's community, it  
has bloomed into a nine-member band  
whose musical scope includes jazz, Latin,  
and funk. Just finishing a six-week tour,  
Baba Yaga plays women's concerts and bar  
engagements, and manages to accommodate  
audiences who want dance music while  
maintaining the integrity of their  
own special sound.

jazz, the traditional music of black

Kate Millett read from her newest,  
and as yet unpublished, work, The  
Basement, at a reading in Boulder  
sponsored by the Naropa Institute on  
June 23. Millett refers to The Basement as  
her "life's work." It is the horrifying  
and true story of Sylvia Likens,  
a sixteen-year-old woman-child who  
was brutally tortured to death in  
1965. Millett has taken the story out  
of the context of an atrocity story  
published by a sensation-hungry press  
and into the realms of poetry, philo-  
sophy, and social criticism. She  
calls Sylvia her muse.  
Sylvia Likens was the daughter of  
midwestern carnival workers. They  
were, no doubt, negligent parents.  
Then they left Sylvia and her younger  
sister Jenny to board with Gertrude  
Baniszewski; they never checked to see  
if the room, for which they paid  
twenty dollars a month, existed. It  
did not.  
Gertrude Baniszewski was a woman  
with seven children and no child support.  
Her husband, a cop, had deserted her.  
It was a grim, impoverished life. These  
are important facts, but they explain very little.  
The fact of Gertrude Baniszewski's  
destitute existence does not explain  
how she, with the aid of her children  
and up to fifteen neighborhood boys,  
could have tortured Sylvia Likens to  
death.  
They confined Sylvia to a basement.  
They beat her with a belt and a  
board. Daily, they immersed her in  
scalding water. They burned cigarettes  
into her skin. They raped her  
with coke bottles and forced her to  
do the same. Slowly, painfully, sad-  
istically, they killed her.  
Her sister, who was crippled, was forced to watch.  
Neighbors heard the screams.  
No one was told of the beatings  
and hid who witnessed them. The  

oppression, and I asked if the music  
relates to feminist oppression:

Bonnie: "To a certain degree. Not be-  
ing a black woman, or a black person,  
I can't speak for that oppression be-  
cause I haven't been there. I can speak  
for the oppression of women and  
lesbians and different cultures, and  
what I know. They are related though.  
There is something about an understanding  
of oppression that expands awareness."

Patti: "It's fair to say that struggle  
is struggle, but it's not fair to  
equate struggles. That's something  
we've tried to say, that we relate to  
struggle. But we know it would be real  
questionable to copy black music and  
say it is our struggle because it is  
not."

I also asked about women's reactions  
to the fact that much of the music  
Baba Yaga plays is male-oriented:

Bonnie: "There're a lot of women who  
won't come and listen to us play be-  
cause they know that we do play some  
music that is written by men. That's  
not true on a large scale though."

Patti: "Something we've tried to do re-  
cently is find jazz music by women.  
It's just that it's really hard to  
do—to find women's music...I think  
what I'm trying to do is learn from  
what has been there before and not  
feel guilt about where I'm coming from  
in the world, or where anyone else is  
coming from, but to see it objectively  
and understand what the truth is about  
the expression of it and let it flow."

"I always knew when I was in  
school taking music classes I was on  
edge and I never knew why and it's  
just recently that I've understood  
that things were left out. And it  
comes down in a real political way—  
class, race. Jazz has not been an ac-  
ceptable thing until very recently  
and when a lot of people have pushed  
to have it recognized."

Both the racism we discussed, as  
well as a kind of male intellectual  
possessiveness of jazz in the 1960s,  
kept this music from the public for a  
long time. People were suspicious of  
jazz, basically because it was struc-  
tured differently than traditional  
European music. And, as we agreed, be-  
cause people are in large measure so  
protected in their tastes that they  
rarely seek out other sounds.

In many ways, this makes jazz suit-  
able to a "non-traditional band," es-  
pecially one that weaves politics  
into their music and their process.  
Baba Yaga approaches jazz flexibly,  
and in turn uses the flexibility of the  
music itself to the band's advantage:

Patti: "Our purpose in expression is  
not to present a math problem, and  
that's the way a lot of men relate to  
jazz—it's like a challenge."

Bonnie: "We get a lot of support through  
our process about expressing our-  
selves, and that it's OK to express  
ourselves. And we have not had the  
chance to do that before. We've got-  
ten to the place where we can deal with  

Both from their recording and per-  
formances, Baba Yaga proves that nine  
women can flow together both musically  
and psychically. When I thought about  
their energy while I watched them  
play, I was amazed—here were per-  
formers who had been on the road for  
weeks, whose music was incredibly de-  
manding, and who, for all financial  
intents and purposes, were playing  
for the pure joy of it. The fact is  
that at times, the band barely breaks  
even; so, all the members maintain  
part-time jobs in addition to their  
performance and practice schedules.  
Yet, despite the added pressures of  
daily existence, they all have the  
resources to continue working at their  
music.

Certainly part of their energy is  
refunded to them by enthusiastic au-  
diences. They marveled that part of  
their performance experience is give  
and take. But, it seems that their  
real impetus comes from within the  
band:

Patti: "It's real easy to start wonder-  
ing why you are doing this thing;  
sometimes, it seems like you could  
just give it up and it would be the  
same...But one of the biggest things  
that pushes me is other people's self-  
motivation. If I'm working around peo-  
ple who are pushing and driving all  
the time trying to get to this point,  
then I am in one of the most support-  
ive working environments."

Mother responded with the observation  
that if they were beating Sylvia,  
she probably deserved it.

Kate Millett lived with this story  
for thirteen years. Haunted by it,  
she did a series of sculptures with  
prisoned-like Sylvia.

The women were im-  
The women were  
Sylvia. Three years ago, Millett fin-  
ally went to Indianapolis to begin  
research for The Basement. She read  
five thousand pages of court testi-  
mony and began to reconstruct the  
story.

It was not just a simple case of  
child abuse, though that was part of  
it. After all, the neighbors heard  
the screams, but condoned the act of  
beating. If only it hadn't gone too  
far. Unfortunately, when abuse is  
begun, when corporal punishment is  
sanctioned, who is to judge when it  
has gone too far? At death? Before  
then? When? 

Millett analyzed the torturers. Did  
they have fun? she asked. They must  
have. They must have enjoyed the ex-  
citement of creating new tortures.  
How they must have laughed, for sure-  
ly they did laugh, at Sylvia's suf-  
fering.

The tortures they inflicted upon  
Sylvia were ritualized. They replaced  
the games these male children nor-  
mally played after school. They were  
just like the games they always played—  
the games all of us played: cops  
and robbers, bondage, bang you're  
dead. Only for Sylvia Likens it wasn't  
a game; it was her life and it  
ended in murder. The torturers were  
playing a game which all society re-  
cognizes, only they went too far.

But I am skirting the issue. The  
reason behind the crime, the meaning  
of the crime was obvious. It was  
engraved on Sylvia's abdomen: "I am  
a prostitute and proud of it." Syl-  
via Likens was punished for sex, for  
having sex, for being sex, for being  
female.

Millett said: "It's time to start to  
examine the corpses in our midst,  
the abominations against us."

Sylvia Likens, a nubile sixteen  
year-old woman-child was murdered for  
being female.

Perhaps if Gertrude's eldest daugh-  
ter was not pregnant, unmarried, and  
facing the same miserable future as  
her mother, perhaps if young boys  
weren't taught to beat up women under  
the tutelage of their fathers, per-  
haps if Indianapolis was not a fun-  
damentalist town, perhaps if women  
were not so well versed in their own  
oppression that they did not hand it  
down from generation to generation,  
perhaps if all these things didn't  
happen, then Sylvia's torturers would  
not have felt compelled to teach Syl-  
via her lesson: that women are sexual  
objects to be abhorred and feared for  
their sexuality, until their spirits  
are broken.

The ritualized tortures which Syl-  
via underwent were lessons designed  
to teach her shame, shame for her  
sex. Her body was humiliated in hun-  
dreds of ways. She was even forced to  
humiliate herself, to push a coke  
bottle into her own vagina. She was  
taught sexual shame.

It is a lesson we all learn. We all  
learn that we are not to walk alone  
at night, we learn not to hitchhike.  
When we do walk alone, or hitchhike,  
we are raped and assaulted. When our  
case comes to trial, the judges rule  
that we "invited" the attack. We  
learn shame. We learn that clothing,  
or the lack of it, is provocative.  
When we behave "faultlessly," when  
we dress in jeans and turtlenecks,  
when we are still raped and assault-  
ed, the judges rule that women are  
fair game in a "sexually permissive  
society." We learn shame.

Sylvia learned shame. She also  
learned despair.

Despair came on the last day of  
her life. Alone, in a damp basement  
on the last day of her life, Sylvia  
Likens finally seized a coal shovel  
and pounded her message, pounded for  
help, pounded in despair. She pound-  
ed until one neighbor almost called  
before she realized, the pounding  
stopped. Sylvia Likens knew despair  
as well as shame.

The story has hundreds of dimen-  
sions. Millett invited us to view it  
as a series of sculpture pieces. She  
examined Sylvia Likens' story from a  
universal aspect as well. And the  
story can be dismissed as a news  
story, so horrifying that we rush to  
forget it as quickly as we rush to  
hear of it. Sylvia's story can also  
be told from police photographs, the  
many impersonal 8x10 glossies that  
chronicle the terror.

But of all the photographs, of all  
the images that this story conjures  
up, none is as terrifying as the  
autopsy photograph with its visual  
record of cigarette burns, scalding  
baths, beatings, and obscenities  
carved into her skin. "But it was  
the mouth I could not forget," chant-  
ed Millett softly.

Sylvia Likens had, in her despair,  
chewed her lips in two. It was a  
wound which Sylvia had inflicted on  
herself. The penultimate statement  
of despair: the victim had finally  
learned to inflict her own pain.

"I had known evil," concluded Mil-  
lett.

So had all who heard Millett read.  
The audience left in total silence.

Forgive me for paraphrasing Mil-  
lett's all too powerful words. I had  
not planned to write this article.  
That I did not bring a tape recorder  
to the reading I deeply regret. Yet  
I had to share this experience.

Sylvia Likens lives with me now, as  
she has lived with Millett for years,  
as she must be living with others who  
have heard Millett tell her story.

When The Basement is finally pub-  
lished, do read the book. It may  
change your life.
