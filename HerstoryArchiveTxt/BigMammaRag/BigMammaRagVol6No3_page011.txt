the defense committee and they would  
collectively make a decision if the  
money is to be used as bail. The  
money will be paid directly to the  
court and 9/10ths of the amount  

would be refunded at the end of the  
trial or when the charges are dropped.  

When calling in information,  
please give the woman or women's full  
name, home address, phone number,  
work address if possible, what she/  
they are charged with, where she is  
presently kept, the amount of bail,  
her lawyer's name and phone number,  
if possible. Get only the known  
facts of the case, but do not ques-  
tion the woman herself or the lawyer  
about anything else pertaining to  
the case. Protect her rights; if you  
are given any unknown facts you  
place yourself in jeopardy and could  
be subpoenaed against the woman.  

The fund is small, and we hope to  
make it grow in the future. No woman  
will be asked to pay for the use  
of the bail money. Anyone at any  
time can send in any amount to the  
Denver Feminist Bail Fund, c/o  
P.O. Box 18236, Denver 80218.  

Phone numbers for the administra-  
tors are Lori, 388-8678; Karen,  
233-6758 and Bobbe, 322-6119.

Lic attitudes... If books like this  

one had existed when I was growing up,  
I would not have wasted years of my  
life trying to pretend to myself and  
the world that I was heterosexual.  

I don't have to pretend anymore, to  
myself or anyone, and it feels wonder-  
ful. Still, few of us can afford to  
be so open. And so, to those of you  
who are still 'in the closet’, we say  
that we understand why, and as Barbara  
Gittings would say, ‘Courage, folks.  
Those of us who are out are oiling the  
closet doors as fast as we can!’

must be proven that he knew that his  
consort was married. Only the wronged  
husband can bring charges.  

Amnesty for Women demands that women  
held in prison for "women's crimes" be  
released. An Oct. 14 Amnesty law par-  
donned only those who could prove that  
their "crimes" were specifically relat-  
ed to one of the movements for civil  
rights or autonomy in Spain.  

"Social prisoners” [as ‘common pri-  
soners are called], among them many  
women, have been left jailed. The re-  
sult has been repeated prison uprisings,  
hunger strikes, and self-mutilation:  
the prisoners' desperate cries for some  
sort of recognition.  

The Moncloa Pact has served to con-  
fuse the picture. Billed as a step to-  
wards true democracy, this agreement  
signed by Suarez and political party  
leaders, has been variously interpreted  
by the press and its signers, and arb-  
itrarily implemented by the government.  

The Moncloa Pact promised among other  
reforms the de-penalization of adultery.  
A bill to this effect has been present-  
ed by the Council of Ministers. It  
must still go through the slow process  
of approval by the Cortes.  

Also agreed on in the Moncloa Pact  
was the de-penalization of the use and  
distribution of contraceptives; but so  
far not even a bill has been presented,  
although newspaper headlines played up  
the point.  

Divorce is supposedly part of the new  
Constitution--Spain is governed right  
now without one--but it actually isn’t  
even mentioned by name in the draft re-  
cently published. Instead, it states  
that civil law will regulate "separation  
and dissolution" of marriage. The  
Constitution of the Second Republic, it  
is interesting to note, stated clearly  
that divorce could be obtained through  
mutual agreement.  

Proposed divorce legislation calls  
for five years of separation before a  
divorce can be granted. This stipula-  
ted requirement for previous separation  
is longer than any other in the world.

remain in the city and possibly the  
right to remain with their children as

Despite the extreme conditions of  
their oppression, black women have  
played a significant role in the strug-  
gle against apartheid. As early as  
1913, black women led a prolonged fight  
against the government's attempt to is-  
sue passes to women. After numerous  
demonstrations, including a march of  
600 women to the municipal offices at  
Bloemfontein, where they dumped a sack  
containing all their passes at the feet  
of the deputy-mayor, the government a-  
bandoned this attempt in 1956. Black  
women have also played active and prom-  
inent roles in trade-union organizing,  
particularly in the garment and textile  
industries and in food processing and  
canning.  

Although black trade unions were not  
recognized by the government, many  

black women gained invaluable experi-  
ence from this organizing work. Among  
Coloured workers, whose unions were  
recognized, several women became the  
best known and most militant organizers.  

During the 1950's, women fought along  
side men in the protests, demon-  
strations, strikes and boycotts which  
marked the Defiance Campaign Against  
Unjust Laws. In the course of this  
ultimately futile attempt at peaceful  
reform, 8,500 people of all races  
deliberately invited arrest and impris-  
onment by defying apartheid laws.  

In 1955, when the government renewed  
its decision to issue the hated passes  
to black women by announcing that pass-  
es would be required by 1956, a protest  
initiated by black women (but open to  
all) in Pretoria drew 2,000 women, and  
similar demonstrations soon spread to  
Durban and Cape Town. Women refused  
the passes, burned them and otherwise  
resisted the extension of this humili-  

ating practice which has become a part-  
icular symbol of the oppression of  
South African blacks.  

On August 9, 1956, which is now desig-  
nated Women's Day in South Africa,  
20,000 women overcame tremendous obsta-  
cles to assemble in Pretoria to present  
petitions against the pass laws signed  
by hundreds of thousands of people.  

The protests continued, not only in  
the cities but in remote rural areas  
as well, but this time the government  
won. Old women attempting to collect  
their miserable pensions were told, "No  
pass book - no pension." Women without  
pass books could not register the birth  
of their children or keep their jobs.  
In some areas, the government retaliat-  
ed against resistance with beatings,  
shootings, the burning of homes to the  
ground and the banishment of individ-  
uals. In the end, the pass books were  
accepted.  

The Defiance Campaign and many of the  
illusory hopes for reform which it gen-  
erated were crushed at Sharpeville in  
1960, when the South African government  
murdered 69 unarmed protesters.  

In the early 1960's, harsh "anti-ter-  
rorism" legislation was introduced, and  
women were prosecuted for a wide var-  
iety of political charges, including  
treason, terrorism, membership in or  
assistance to banned organizations,  
sabotage, helping people to escape from  
the country, recruiting guerillas and  
breaches of banning orders. Sometimes  
women were jailed simply on account of  
their husband's political activities.  

Since 1960, the struggle against a-  
partheid has continued largely through  
illegal organizations and activities,  
but the demonstration recently at  
Soweto has shown the mass resistance  
to the oppression of the Vorster re-  
gime has not been successfully sup-  
pressed, and will ultimately triumph.  

It is important that the  
unity women have built as a movement  
grow and become even stronger in spite  
of all efforts to divide us.  

Support National Liberation Movements!  
All over the world, women are organi-  
zing to demand equality with men as  
they join in struggles for national  
liberation. In Eritrea, 4,000 women  
demonstrated in the streets after the  
liberation of Keren, demanding that  
the peoples' government put an end to  
male supremacy. In the United States,  
Puerto Rican women such as Lolita  
Lebron are in prison for working with  
the Puerto Rican independence move-  
ment. We denounce all actions taken  
by the U.S. and other big powers that  
are the enemies of the working people.  

Organize the Unorganized! Build our  
Strength in the Workplace: Women and  
minorities are the last hired, first  
fired, and get the worst paying jobs.  
Affirmative action laws giving prior-  
ity to their training and hiring are  
being attacked and the very right of  
all workers to organize is threatened  
by “right to work" laws. Poor work-  
ing conditions such as forced overtime  
and lack of childcare especially hurt  
women, and are issues that unions fail  
to deal with because they are often  
male dominated and undemocratic.  

Only when the rank and file realize  
their power will the needs of women  
and all workers be satisfied.
