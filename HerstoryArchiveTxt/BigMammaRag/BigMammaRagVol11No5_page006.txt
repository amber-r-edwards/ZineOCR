Paralyzing Strike

More than 9 million workers
walked off their jobs across
Argentina recently to demand
a massive wage hike in the
face of a 400 percent annual
inflation rate.

The strike paralyzed most
activities in the country of
27 million people. Banks,
shops and restaurants closed
and subway and train drivers
abandoned their jobs. The
Interior Ministry estimated
that 96 percent of Argentina's
industrial workers in key man-
ufacturing centers in Buenos
Aires and interior provinces
joined the 24-hour strike.

Violent Protests

Violent protests erupted
April 4 and 5 in Sao Paulo,
Brazil, set off by soaring
unemployment and a faltering
economy. One person was killed,
96 injured and 200 detained
by police. More than 1,500
protesters marched to the
state governor's palace where
they smashed 30 yards of iron
railings before being repelled
by four truckloads of riot
police wielding riot sticks
and using tear gas. Property
losses were in the millions
of dollars in South America's
largest city with a popula-
tion of 12 million.

Disarming Woman

A 35-year-old Englewood, CO
woman thwarted an attempted
sexual attack by disarming
her knife-wielding assailant
and forcing him to drive to
a nearby police station.

The woman had missed her
bus and accepted a ride from
a man who agreed to take her
to her destination. Once in
the car, the man pulled a
knife and demanded that she
perform oral sex on him. She
refused and when the man was
distracted by traffic, she
grabbed the knife, held it
to his throat, and forced
him to drive to the police
station.

Klan Protection

50 members of the Ku Klux
Klan marched in downtown Hous-
ton, protected by over 600
riot-equipped police and an
undetermined number of under-
cover cops. A fifteen-mile
police escort was given to
the Klan from its headquart-
ers to downtown. Along the
march route thick rope was
tied along the sidewalk mak-
ing it very difficult for
anyone to come near the Klan.
Exits on the freeway were
closed and streets were
blocked off so that people
had to walk long distances
to get to the site and
searches were made as people
filed in. Nonetheless, over
2,500 people took to the
streets to show their oppo-
sition to Klan terror.

Girls Poisoned

On March 27, 317 girls from
six schools in Jenin, on the
West Bank, were rushed to a
hospital and treated for symp-
toms which suggested that they
had been poisoned. In Yatta,
over seventy miles from Jenin,
another 400 Arab schoolgirls
have been hit by the epide-
mic. This outbreak brings the
number of victims to 1,000.
The Israeli army has imposed
curfews on Yatta, Tulkarm and
parts of Nablus where cases
of the epidemic have been re-
ported. This epidemic is be-
ing depicted by the officials
as “a mass phenomenon" - how
odd then that it hit only
Arab schoolgirls. An Arab
journalist has been charged
with “inciting people to be-
come ill."

Permanent Eyeliner

Applying eyeliner may be a
thing of the past because of
a unique implant surgery -
developed by a Las Vegas sur-
geon for a former beauty
queen. Dr. Giora Angres says
he implants color pigment a-
long the eyelash line. The
coloration will not smear or
run and can last for years.

Whipping Death

The 12-year-old daughter of
Dr. Rad Poor was arrested in
Mesched, Province of Karassan,
Iran, while she was walking
at her father's side, because
she was wearing shorts in
public. Khomeini's "revolu-
tionary" police, the Passa-
daran, sentenced the girl to
60 lashings. Fearing for her
life, the father demanded
that the punishment be meted
out to him instead. The Pass-
adaran refused and the child
was whipped in front of his
eyes. She died during the
whippings.

Police Murders

Seven New Orleans police
are being tried in Dallas,
Texas, for beating and ter-
rorizing residents of a Black
neighborhood. This campaign
of terror dates back to 1980
when a Black man was shot to
death in the Desire housing
project. During a two-day
period in Nov., 1980, four
more people were murdered by
the police in pre-dawn raids.
One woman was shot to death
by police who burst into her
apartment while she was tak-
ing a bath. The cops are also
accused of taking people to
secluded areas to be “res-
trained, beaten, assaulted,
gagged and threatened with
firearms."

Marriage Or Jail

A Minnesota judge is sen-
tencing minor offenders to a
life sentence - marriage.

For the past 20 years,
Judge Noah Rosenbloom has
made marriage a condition for
probation. When he learns an
individual seeking probation
is living with a girlfriend
or boyfriend, he gives the
probationer three choices -
get married, move out or go
to jail.

Custody Denial

A young white woman has
been denied custody of her
son for a second time because
she gave birth to a racially
mixed daughter. Superior Court
Judge Bernard Mulherin in
Waynesboro, GA, said Kathleen
Blackburn was "unfit" and
"immoral" as a mother. Black-
burn's lawyer, Ozell Hudson,
Jr., says this is a civil
rights issue. The case will
be appealed.

“Spay” The Mayor

Mayor D.C. Master of Char-
lestown, WV recently drew the
wrath of local NAACP activists
by saying that women on low
incomes who have too many a-
bortions should be "spayed."
Master made the remarks in
opposition to funding of
statewide family planning
clinics. The Mayor, a veter-
inarian, said he meant it as
"neither sexist nor racist."
The NAACP Chapter is calling
for Master's resignation.

Towards Fascism

There are now new guidelines
for FBI investigations of
“violence-prone groups" in
the U.S. and Puerto Rico.
From now on, government a-
gents are mandated to go af-
ter political groups who mere-
ly advocate illegal activity
or who might commit an ille-
gal act at some point in the
future. No longer does the
FBI legally require "probable
cause" that a crime has taken
place or is being planned be-
fore initiating an investiga-
tion. Public activists in the
U.S. and Puerto Rico who sup-
port armed struggle for so-
cialism and national libera-
tion will be principal tar-
gets of the FBI offensive.

Non-Resident Gays

Participants in stable gay
relationships who are not
Norwegian residents may apply
for work permits under Nor-
wegian law, according to
Lovetann, a lesbian/gay paper.
Under Norwegian law, gay re-
lationships are equivalent to
heterosexual marriages for
the purpose of issuing work
permits.

Strip-Search-Of-Girl

A 12-year-old Los Angeles
black girl was strip-searched
after a classmate reported $5
missing from his wallet. Rose-
Marie Sease is now suing the
Ocean View Elementary School
District for $500,000 in dam-
ages for physical and emotion-
al pain suffered by her daugh-
ter LeTichia.

A boy admitted he had taken
the $5, but LeTichia was
strip-searched. After the
search proved fruitless, school
officials ordered her to
bring in $3 to help replace
the money. Her mother points
out that LeTichia is one of
the few black students in the
school.
