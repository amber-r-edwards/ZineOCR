Joining Feminism/Anti-Imperialism

Dear BMR--

I'm writing with a progress
report on the article we are
working on. Basically we're
getting close to getting it
done. We have a draft we feel
pretty good about. It needs to
be tightened up and cut (it's
too long), but we expect to
be able to send it to you in
the next couple of weeks. It
seems like it would fit in
just right for the August is-
sue on the state of the wo-
men's movement. We really hope
that you'll put it in that
issue.

I read the abortion rights
article in your June issue
and thought it was good, but
wanted to comment on the
statement: "the radical left
insists that the ‘woman pro-
blem' can wait until after the
big enemy 'IMPERIALISM' is
dead." We would agree that
much of the left says to wo-
men "you'll have to wait until
after the revolution." But we
feel like a sweeping state-
ment as the one from the abor-
tion article gives the impres-
sion that all of anti-imper-
ialism is inherently backward
in terms of the liberation of

women--or that anyone
who talks about imperialism

as the enemy can't also be a
serious and active fighter for
the liberation of women. As
women who consider ourselves

collective:

both part of the women's move-
ment and the anti-imperialist
movement--trying to develop
politics which can fight for
the liberation of women in

the context of the overall
worldwide struggle against the
imperialist system, we are
concerned about the effects of
the statement in the abortion
article.

The article that we are work-
ing on for the August issue is
specifically on the relation-
ship of the struggle for wo-
men's liberation to the defeat
of imperialism. We think this
is a very important issue for
us as women to be dealing
with. Hopefully the article
will clarify what we think on
this question. We'll send it
to you soon.

Dear Barbara,

Thanks for reminding us to
put away our broom, when we
are writing the kind of poli-
tical analysis that was in
the abortion article. BMR is
committed to the alliance of
worldwide liberation strug-
gles and the liberation of
women. We look forward to
BMR

your article.

No Such Thing As “Mental Illness’

Dear Lori,

I have a little more time to
write my reactions to your ar-
ticle. As I said in the last
letter, I was really pleased
by your article and the issue
as a whole and thought you
presented a lot of important
information. I do have some
minor criticisms.

I felt your article was
slightly ambiguous at times
about whether there is such
a thing as mental illness or
there isn't. My own feeling
is that most people get locked
up because they are somehow
threatening to society--at
least initially most do not
exhibit behavior that would
be considered "crazy". Kids
are locked up by their parents
because they run away from
home (i.e. an oppressive si-
tuation) or take drugs. Elder-

Lavender Left

To BMR,

As an avid reader of lesbi-
an, feminist, gay and radi-
cal papers and literature,

I am subscribing to BMR. Ha-
ving read a few issues that
I saw at Oakland's Women's
Place Bookstore; I was im-
pressed with the depth of
articles and the relevance
of the topics explored.

I look forward to more dia-
logue/articles on lesbian
parenting and child custody
issues. And to building a
radical gay and lesbian
movement (Lavender Left).

Look forward to getting my
first issue.

ly parents are locked up by
their kids because the latter
don't want to take care of
them, wives are locked up by
their husbands because of a
family fight or because the
wife is talking of leaving--
you touched on this in your
article. However, in most of
the cases you gave the inmate
would be perceived as "sick"
(she couldn't care for her
kids or she had a "breakdown")
Often these "failures" are
actually acts of rebellion. I
didn't feel that was stressed

oops!

In June 1981, Vol.9 No.6
please note the following
corrections:

On page 4 in "Union Organi-
zing In The Shelter Move-
ment" it was stated erron-
eously that Volunteers of
America is part of the Sal-
vation Army. VOA is a sep-
arate church, with a struc-

ture similar to the Salva-
tion Army.

On page 20 in "Lesbian
Chauvinism Exposed" Brooke
offered the following chang-
es: in the middle of the
first column it should read

"...nobody wants their femi-
nists." (No I don't, con-
sider myself the only femi-
nist in the movement); in
the midsection of column 3,
point 4 should read "Many
heterosexual women do flake
out: leave the movement for
their boyfriends (and cut
you dead), go the MS. route
join the "women's communi-
ty," etc. Sure they can
sell out. What somehow do-
esn't get mentioned..."
