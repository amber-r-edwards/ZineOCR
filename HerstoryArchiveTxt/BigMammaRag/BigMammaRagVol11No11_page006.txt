Support Grows

Two young, white South  
Africans, Carl Niehaus and  
Johanna Lourans, are cur-  
rently on trial for high  
treason in Johannesburg.  
They are accused of support-  
ing the African National  
Congress (ANC), the leading  
organization of the 24 mil-  
lion Black people who are  
trying to overturn the  
hated apartheid regime. High  
treason carries a possible  
death sentence.

Informants of the fascist  
security police have accused  
Niehaus of trying to re-  
cruit whites to support the  
ANC and also of taking pho-  
tographs of possible tar-  
gets for sabotage by the  
liberation forces. In the  
past half year, the ANC had  
successfully stepped up  
guerrilla bombing action as  
an additional tactic along  
with mass boycotts and  
strikes.

Aid Denied

A gay man, already ex-  
tremely ill with AIDS, was  
sent to San Francisco by a  
Gainesville, Florida, hos-  
pital in an act reminiscent  
of deportation. Morgan  
MacDonald, a 27-year-old  
Florida resident, died Oct.  
20 in a San Francisco hos-  
pital. He was sent in a  
chartered jet, attended by  
a doctor, a nurse and a  
social worker at an esti-  
mated expense of $10,000.  
Shands Hospital in Gaines-  
ville had declared the man  
to be an out-patient and  
said that there were no  
nursing homes in Florida  
that would accept him. San  
Francisco doctors felt that  
MacDonald's classification  
as an outpatient was an ex-  
pedient way to get rid of  
him.

Red Alert

Central American support  
groups in San Francisco, CA,  
are joining forces in the  
wake of a right-wing harass-  
ment that forced one woman  
to move from her ransacked  
apartment. Susan Gomez, an  
American member of the Nic-  
aragua Solidarity Committee  
began receiving threatening  
phone calls and found a note  
tied to a rock in her bed-  
room. The note, which was  
made from letters cut from a  
newspaper in her apartment,  
said “Communists now we know  
who you are--out of Nicara-  
gua." Gomez spent that night  
away from her apartment and  
returned to find it ran-  
sacked. Gomez said, "This  
kind of thing outrages peo-  
ple more than it intimidates  
them. We might be somewhat  
scared personally, but it  
does not intimidate us in  
our work."

Taking Up Arms

For 13 hours in October,  
a band of 250 contras led  
by CIA-trained ex-Somoza  
National Guard member Mike  
Lima plundered the village  
of Pantasma, Nicaragua and  
two neighboring agricultural  
cooperatives. Candida Rosar-  
io Martinez expressed the  
anger that people through-  
out the country felt with  
these words: "Not one tear,  
not one lament, not one  
flower will there be in this  
valley for the death of our  
fellow peasants, teachers,  
soldiers, our massacred  
people. The tears will now  
be the arms we will take up  
to destroy every one of the  
criminal Somocistas."

Maltreatment

Where there is an illness,  
there's an industry.

Many "health" clinics have  
opened that "treat" women  
for pre-menstrual syndrome,  
or PMS. The clinics treating  
PMS patients typically give  
women a battery of blood  
tests and a pelvic exam,  
charging between $200 to  
$500. Another expense comes  
in the form of monthly dos-  
ages of the hormone proges-  
terone, which can cost up to  
$200 a month. PMS patients  
may be prescribed as much as  
2,000 milligrams a day of  
progesterone. Progesterone  
has not been shown to cure  
PMS, but has been proven to  
have many side effects.

Graphic Tactic

A new kind of political  
expression is sprouting on  
highways in some parts of the  
country. Groups of nocturnal  
political activists known  
as the “billboard guerrillas"  
have been pasting over such  
existing signs as Come to  
Marlboro Country with radi-  
cal advertising. They usual-  
ly publicize an upcoming e-  
vent or make a general poli-  
tical statement.

Most billboard groups have  
four or five members, who  
scale the billboard struc-  
tures equipped with house  
paint, five gallons of flour  
paste, a few paint rollers,  
butcher paper, and long-han-  
dled brushes. One advertis-  
ement will set the group back  
about $15.

Invasion Planned

One phase of US aggression  
against Nicaragua is a plan,  
in effect since 1981, to  
use the "rescue" of the in-  
digenous Miskito, Sumo, and  
Rama peoples as a pretext  
for a full-scale invasion  
of Nicaragua. This informa-  
tion appeared in a full-  

page ad in Sunday's New York  

Times put out by an organi-  
zation called Indigenous  
World/El Mundo Indigena. The  
group says, "The State De-  
partment plan under consid-  
eration to occupy the North-  
east Region (of Nicaragua)  
under the banner of ‘Indian  
Liberation' is a program of  
genocide and must be aban-  
doned along with all scenar-  
ios for intervention in  
Nicaragua."

Free The Five

On Sept. 6, trial #1 of  
the Vancouver Five began  
with all of the Five pleading  
not guilty to all charges  
involving the Brinks conspi-  
racy. Due to jury selection,  
etc., the actual trial it-  
self will not begin until  
Jan., 1984, and supporters  
believe that the trials will  
continue throughout the year.

Capitol Bombing

On Nov. 7th the Armed  
Resistance Unit bombed the  
US Capitol building to re-  
taliate against imperial-  
ist aggression that has  
sent the marines, the CIA,  
and the army to invade sov-  
ereign nations, to trample  
and lay waste the lives and  
rights of the peoples of  
Grenada, Lebanon, El Salva-  
dor, and Nicaragua.

In a communique from the  
ARU the group says: "Our  
action carries a message to  
the US imperialist ruling  
class....We did not choose  
to kill any of them this  
time. But their lives are  
not sacred, and their hands  
are stained with the blood  
of millions. Let it be as  
clear to the people of this  
country as it is to the  
rest of the people of the  
world that the US ruling  
class are war criminals,  
and they will be held ac-  
countable for their crimes.

Campus Rapes

A Labatt's Brewery truck  
has been given to the Eng-  
ineering students of the  
University of Saskatchewan  
in Saskatoon and is being  
used during "mock" rape  
contests between the Engin-  
eering faculty and the Ag-  
ricultural faculty. Named  
the Rape and Plunder Squad,  
the truck has been purvey-  
ing the campus searching  
for likely candidates. The  
squad has grabbed women to  
pull their pants down. So  
another boys night out.
