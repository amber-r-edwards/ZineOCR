the movement. Another progressive  
organization, the Irish Congress  
of Trade Unions, has supported it  
through "A Better Life for All"  
campaign in the Six Counties.  

It is significant that working-  
class women are taking leadership  
roles. They are defying their  
traditional position in a male-  
dominated society, and are experiencing  
collective power. The Catholic  
Church is a powerful institution in  
Ireland, and patriarchy is deeply  
rooted.  

In the IRA and the Official  
Republican Movement, women have been  
fighting sexism and patriarchy for  
the past 60 years. And they have  
been contributing successfully to  
the overall struggle in Ireland.  

Women such as Mairin DeBurca and  
Bernadette Devlin have traveled  
in the US, gaining support and  
talking about workers’ struggles  
in Ireland.  

It is hoped that the accumulated  
experiences of the progressive  
movements in Ireland will influence  
the Peace Movement in the direction  
of conciliation among the working  
class, and not conciliation with  
pro-European forces—thereby deepen-  
ing class struggle in Ireland.

ment, Official wing, who spoke in  
Boulder October 4, 1976.)

seems to me they would be reasonably  
perfect." She strongly felt that  
women should be liberated from the  
kitchen and nursery on occasion and  
have their places taken by their men-  
folk.  

By the time Amelia decided to make  
an around-the-world flight five years  
later, the "craze for flying" had  
subsided and the big transports were  
slowly easing out the smaller planes.  
The fact that the navigational equip-  
ment available for civilian flying  
was inadequate didn't stop her. She  
took off on the second leg of the  
flight with her navigator, Fred Noo-  
nan, from Miami on June 1, 1937, in  
a Lockheed Electra. The flight plan  
was to fly east from Miami to South  
America—Africa—Asia—Australia—New  
Guinea. Then the big hop for home.  

Amelia was last seen alive by  
friends before her plane sped down  
the runway in Lae, New Guinea, for  
Howland Island, the next-to-the-last  
and most perilous leg of the return  
flight over the Pacific. They had  
logged over 22,000 miles, and she  
was tired. She longed to be home  
for the 4th of July.  

Homing in on Howland Island, ap-  
proximately 2 miles long and a half-  
mile wide, would be the most diffi-  
cult landing of the entire trip.  
When the Electra approached the is-  
land, some contact was made with the  
men in the radio shack on board the  
US Coast Guard cutter, “Ithasca."  
Amelia's voice was heard, strident  
and high-pitched, giving her posi-  
tion. Then terrible silence and  
the world held its breath. A massive  
search took place but her plane was  
never found.  

When the air-sea search was finally  
abandoned, the carrier Lexington  
steamed into San Francisco's harbor,  
its colors at half-mast in tribute.  
Amelia had disappeared, but she was  
not forgotten. Rumors were rampant.  
What a good sector of the public  

didn't know, it speculated upon, with...  

warped intensity, and the mystery  
surrounding Amelia Earhart's disap-  

pearance was no exception. She did  
not die—she passed into American  
mythology.

“Either I could assume I would nev-  
er get out and plan a life around to-  
tal resistance inside the walls. This  
was the course taken by Stanley Bond  
(one of my codefendants) who was mur-  
dered by the government while im-  
prisoned in Walpole in 1972. The other  
alternative would be to attempt to  
reduce the sentence through a protract-  
ed campaign in the courts, parole and  
commutation boards, and other legal  
and political channels... In other  
words, by appealing to the mercy and  
decency of the system. I find this as  
politically distasteful and counter-  
productive as I find the other alter-  
native personally distressing.  

"By pleading guilty I have given  
the state another 18 months of my life  
(the difference between my federal and  
state parole eligibility dates), pos-  
sibly more. But at least I have put  
an upper limit on the time they can  
get from me. Yes, I'm giving them  
something they have no right to take.  
In a sense it's like paying blackmail—  
giving them part of my life to keep  
them from taking the rest.  

“On the other hand, it's a small  
victory that even this was possible.  
Without the energy, love and support  
of so many people, I would have been  
railroaded into the maximum sentence  
in the first trial. If the movement  
were in a more advanced stage, perhaps  
we would have been able to push even  
further.  

"Under different circumstances per-  
haps no compromise would have been pos-  
sible or necessary. But for now, at  
this point in our development, we have  
done what we could.  

"We fought the state to a standstill,  
which is a partial victory. We have  
won back from them the greater part of  
one woman's life. I want to affirm  
once again that it is and will continue  
to be a life dedicated to struggle."

WIAP is a new institution, a  
non-profit institute partially  
funded by the US Department of  
Health, Education and Welfare. Set-  
up to allow students to remain in  
their home communities, WIAP re-  
cently accepted its first group of  
students in Salt Lake City. This  
summer it will offer an intensive  
28-day seminar on women's therapy,  
beginning June 26. (Tuition is  
$850, with partial scholarships  
available. Classes not filled will  
be open to the public.  

_ *Female-system psychology is de-  
fined by WIAP as a system "which is  
concerned with issues pertaining to  
women, men and minorities. The trad-  
itional models of psychotherapy con-  
tain inherent biases, having been the  
products of Western thought and  
ideals, developed within a culture  
system of white male supremacy...  
Under these conditions therapy be-  
comes the subtle imposition of the  
dominant culture upon those very in-  
dividuals who have suffered most  
from its inequities."

instigation. Later, Judy, Nancy and  
Medley were given three choices: 1)  
to be retained as contract GYN workers  
at $39 a week for ten hours of work.  
They would not be allowed to go on  
unemployment and receive their $30  
under the table. (Under-the-table  
payments were common at the Center).  
2) They could go to Detroit, at their  
own expense, and work in the FEN  
building. 3) They could go to work  

at a diaper service which the Health  
Center was carrying out...  
Medley later stated that she had  
been given the three choices, and she  
felt these prospects looked appealing.  
I decided I wasn't feminist enough."  

They came up with a counterproposal  
—to form their own abortion counsel-  
ing group and refer to OFWHC, but this  
was rejected, and they left. When  
they formed another clinic, Laura is  
reported to have said, “We'll never  
fire three people at a time again.”  

Nancy, Judy and Medley formed  
Common Woman's Force and started  
their own clinic.  

Next month's continuation of this  
article will focus on FEN and how  
the OFWHC had a large influence in  
shaping its politics.  

CHILE  

From Page 12  

Basically, although the executive  
power had been turned over to Allende,  
the legislative power and the judi-  
cial power were still in the hands of  
the ruling class. And the political  
parties of the PUG denied the people  
the education that they would have  
to defend the revolutionary process  
with armed struggle.  

BMR: What has happened since the  
coup?  

Carol: With the massive unemployment  
and the extreme inflationary process,  
the extraction of products from  
Chile to industrialized countries to  
pay off the debts, the country is  
extremely poor. The people are suf-  
fering a kind of misery and oppre-  
ssion they've never known.  

Women have been affected even more  
than the men—in education, in the  
schools, in the factories, in the  
firings that take place. The male  
head of the family is given priority.  
Prostitution has probably doubled,  
if not more. Beggary is common. Women  
are out looking for food in the gar-  
bage pails in the areas of the city  
where things are a little bit better.  
Many women are spending an extreme  
amount of time and energy just trying  
to keep things together in their  
homes; they can't think about any  
kind of self-realization or social  
changes.  

However, the resistance movement is  
very strong in Chile. The Socialist  
Party, which was one of the two major  
parties of the PUG, has now taken the  
position that the policies of the PUG  
were incorrect, that the failure can't  
be laid simply to outside interven-  
tion, but on the failure of the PUG  
to anticipate that kind of interven-  
tion. The Socialists have now organ-  
ized with groups like the MIR (Revo-  
lutionary Left Movement, which was  
outside the PUG because they differed  
on these questions) and are now work-  
ing together to prepare the way for  
a people's war in Chile.  

BMR: Has the small taste of freedom  
that women experienced under the PUG  
strengthened their revolutionary  
resolve in any way?  

Carol: I think, in some cases, people  
react to extreme repression and  

power by simply pulling in and con-  
centrating on survival and going back  
to old individualistic values. However,  
there are an increasing number of  
women, as well as the rest of the  
population of Chile, who are active  
in the resistance because they did  
have a taste of what self-determina-  
tion could bring, not only to them-  
selves, but to the whole community.  
Women have organized soup kitchens  
in the working-class communities.  
These are the only kinds of places  
where any kind of public gathering  

can take place because all organiza-  
tions and meetings are prohibited.  
Given the extreme situation of hunger  
and starvation in Chile, the govern-  
ment cannot come in and destroy these  
centers. They have opposed them, but  
the churches have taken them on in  
order to legitimize them, and many  
of the centers actually exist in  
churches. But they were organized  
by community women and these are  
centers of subsistence, both phys-  
ical and moral, for the working  
class people of Chile.  

BMR: What is happening to the women  
and men that were active in both  
the PUG and other left groups now  
that the military has taken over?  
Carol: To the extent the govern-  
ment can do so, they have simply  
tried to eliminate those people.  
Dictatorial rule is such that people  
can be picked up on the streets, or  
their homes can be entered and they  
can be taken away without charges or  
any kind of protection. They can  
simply disappear. Many thousands  
have disappeared in exactly that  
way. Others are kept in detention  
centers and others have been per-  
mitted to leave the country because  
of international solidarity move-  
ments on their behalf. There have  
been some battles in which some of  
these people have been killed; some-  
times they have been able to inflict  
damage as well.  

The extent of repression, of  
torture, is really hard for us to  
comprehend. Yet, the ability of  
the people to maintain their organ-  
izations, to function in a politi-  
cal way, in spite of that repression  
is also hard for us to comprehend.  
BMR: There have been descriptions  
of some of the tortures political  
prisoners have faced, especially  
some of the tortures that women  
have faced that are specific to  
women and reflect the woman-hatred  
of their captors. I know there are  
groups that are trying to help  
these political prisoners. What is  
the most important thing that we  
can do in the US for the people of  
Chile, not just the political  
prisoners, but people in general?  
Carol: I think the most important  
thing is to build a revolutionary  
movement in the US. As long as the  
imperialist systems exist, these  
kinds of repressive regimes are going  
to exist. This kind of repression  
will also come down on the people of  
the US eventually.  

We need to learn from the lessons  
of Chile, use Chile solidarity, work  
not just to help the Chileans, which  
we cannot do in any long-term sense  
without creating a revolutionary  
movement within the US, and building  
a revolutionary party that's capable  
of taking state power.  

BMR: What do you do besides play  
music?  
Casse: That's it. Well I've got  

several things. I'm involved in a  
women's sound company called Women's  
Sound Company. I'm the technician;  
I design, fabricate and take care of  
the equipment. It's been really nice  
because it's really important for  
that equipment to be available for  
women's political events and so on.  
As a musician, I feel really strongly  
about having women who are proficient  
in communication arts.  

We started out with some equipment  
that my father had paid for me to get  
and then built on it from there and  
prayed. Our goal was to get women  
hands-on experience on equipment.  
We've trained close to 12 women in  
sound reinforcement. And we'll con-  
tinue to do that; it’s one of our  
primary motivations for having a  
sound company.  

I'm also really into ecology. I'm  
an organic gardener. I'm a militant  
non-smoker. I feel very strongly  
about creating a matriarchal culture  
for ourselves in a country setting.  
I'm interested in seeing how the  
earth operates, how she takes care of  

herself. Those are a couple of  
things. I'm also riding my bicycle  
a lot. My life feels really inte-  

grated. I'm also coming from a meta-  
physical space, involved in raising  
my goddess consciousness, uniting the  
spirit with the physical and the in-  
tellectual. Something that has been  
dichotomized by the patriarchy.
