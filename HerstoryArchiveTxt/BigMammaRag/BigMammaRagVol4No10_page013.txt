BOULDER FEMINIST THEATRE COLLECTIVE  
Window Dressing by Joanna Russ  
Day Upon Day by Andrea Shepard  
Calm Down Mother by Megan Terry  

Julia Robinson  

The Boulder Feminist Theatre Col-  
lective presented its first Denver  
production to an enthusiastic and re-  
ceptive audience at Theater Lab West  
October 9, 10, and 11. The ambitious  
format included three one-act plays  
written by and about women.  

Window Dressing by Boulder-based  
science fiction author Joanna Russ  
featured collective member Dinah  
Leavitt as a Fifth Avenue mannequin  
struggling for human life and inter-  
action. Her sympathetic antagonist  
appeared in the guise of a male soc-  
ial reject, credibly played by Peter  
Bruch. As they each looked to one  
another for comfort and understanding  
it became apparent that neither could  
comprehend the other's perspective.  

A brutal ending climaxes with the  
mannequin killing herself and the  
lonely, broken man rejected again.  
Both are victims of the empty expec-  
tations of traditional female beauty  
and the one-kiss-and-you-will-live-  
happily-ever-after fantasy.  

Day Upon Day written by Andrea  
Shepard and directed by collective  
member Juliet Wittman realistically  
portrayed a microcosm of life of wo-  
men incarcerated in a Canadian pri-  
son. Nine cast members effectively  
tackled the issues of lesbianism,  
parole-guard-judicial power plays,  
rehabilitation and street survival  
tactics in frank and explicit terms:  
Newcomer Kathleen O'Brien as the in-  
mate eligible for parole gave a vi-  
brant and sensitive performance  
that held the play together.  

The audience was visibly moved when  
she was denied by the parole board.

In Talk Among the Womenfolk  
Susan Saxe has selected a handful  
of poems written during three of  
her years as an underground polit-  
ical fugitive.  

Susan writes prose poetry, where  
content overrides style and syntax.  
The collection, written between  
1970 and 1973, was designed to give  
us some sense of her growth process  
- not a total picture. "But  
perhaps it can be a starting point,"  
Saxe writes in a brief foreword.  

A fine starting point it is.  
Susan Saxe's transition from the  
male left to lesbian-feminism par-  
allels the experience of many women  
who became politically conscious  
during the sixties. In Susan's  
poems, the values of the left have  
not been discarded, but rather  
reworked and brought into a new  
context.  

Living underground, she retains  
her anger against the destruction  
of Viet Nam, the oppression of  
women and the "last ugly memory"  
of a country where drugs and mach-  
ines have usurped creativity and  
nurturance.  

And she retains her desire to  
heal and to rapidly reconstruct:  

Amerika. .  

I wish for your rebirth  

in as little suffering as possible,  
but I know the pain will come.  

Exactly how a feminist revolution  
will happen or differ from the old-  
new left is not specifically anal-  
yzed. Instead Saxe continually  
expresses a belief that political  
commitment tied to respect for  
process and joy will keep us whole  
and united in struggle.  

She watches, angry, as some of  
her friends replace political work  

with no reasonable explanation or  
willingness to understand her needs.  
Katy's monologues were warm and well-  
timed and she incorporated her per-  
sonal mannerisms to present a candid  
portrayal of a woman who is the sum  
of our many parts.  

Calm Down Mother by Megan Terry and  
produced in collaboration with Lee  
Worley is subtitled "A transformation  
for three women." Certainly the most  
demanding acting vehicle of the pro-  
duction, it starred collective mem-  
bers Dinah Leavitt and Juliet Wittman  
and veteran Marlow Brooks in a mon-  
tage of women's hopes and fears.  

with "gods and gurus."  

What future can we promise our  
gentle friends?  

Resistance and confrontation  

to those whose greatest love is  
peace.  

How much better to believe that  
peace will come without struggle.  

The irony of seeking freedom  
through Nature is expressed in  
"Hippiechick," addressed to a sister  
who has chosen to center her life  
around farm and kitchen.  

Well, your man grows stronger  

With each passing day. . .  

While you, your belly grows bigger.  
My sister, I'm freaking out.  

You're barefoot and pregnant.”  

Saxe's respect for inner growth  
coupled with her aversion to the  
cult of karma-seeking reflects the  
current polarization between "spir-  
itual" and "political" growth  
within the movement.  

It's clear from Saxe's writing  
that political activism and  
spirituality, loosely defined as  
the search for the intuitive and  
transcendent, are both integral to

These three women are exceptionally  
talented and clearly had their act  
together (to coin a phrase). We saw  
mother, daughter; sister, friend, co-  
worker dealing with jealousy, rage,  
humiliation, pain, death, love and  
self-worth: all up front, no holds  
barred, and from a feminist perspec-  
tive.  

The play moves fast, and we are  
forced to move with it. The energy  
of these three actresses combined to  
scan a lifetime, a history of women's  
emotions. The audience was a catal-  
yst for questions most of us dare not  
ask, but which became demystified  

a women's revolution,  

Both the beginning and ending  
poems of this collection celebrate  
a common theme. The opening poem,  
a tribute to Susan's mother,  
affirms the primal ties of mother  
and daughter despite the separation  
brought about by each woman's po-  
litical choices.  

And in the final selection, Saxe  
writes that a whole "hystery"  
awaits creation,  

from the footnote that leads us  
to suspect the lie,  

to a tale passed down  

from someone's maiden aunt,  

confirmed by a fragment of an  
ancient woman's grave,  

a myth, a hint, an intuition.  

But Saxe also implies that a  
true spirituality needs to be  
developed as finely as a political  
analysis. We have learned that  
we don't need a weatherman to tell  
which way the wind blows. And we  
ought to know that we don't need a  
guru to teach us how the grass  
grows.

through exposure,  

Dinah Leavitt's acting versatility  
was given full reign--the static man-  
nequin who evokes identification and  
sympathy; the brown-rice, no-bra,  
hippie-chickie sentenced to seven  
years for a hash deal who unmasks the  
coldness and self-righteousness of  
the judicial system; and the woman  
who ages, despairs and protects  
herself from the duty of living.  

Theater Lab West is your basic fun-  
ky, alternative theater. It's locat-  
ed among the pawn shops and liquor  
stores of Sante Fe Drive and the aud-  
ience sat on the floor or on bleach-  
ers softened by rugs. The floors  
creaked, backstage conversations were  
overheard during intermissions, and  
the lighting system depended on ex-  
tension cords.  

This atmosphere, however, relaxed  
the audience and challenged the col-  
lective. And at no time during any  
performance was the professionalism  
of the BFTC doubted.  

My only criticism is that less than  
150 people came to the performances.  
As feminists we need to support and  
encourage the work of the BFTC; as  
women who desperately need viable and  
self-actualizing entertainment that  
speaks our language and warms our  
hearts, we must support and encourage  
the work of the BFTC.  

Do you want to act, help organize  
another performance, learn theater  
lighting, help with publicity, scour  
for props or work a sound system?
