"The Color Purple”: Reflects Lives Of Black Women

The Color Purple

by Alice Walker

Harcourt, Brace and Jovanovich, Inc.

Karen Lee Osborne

If you want to write a
gutsy book, try telling the
truth about incestuous rape,
and in the telling rely only
on letters written by two
sisters, one of them unedu-
cated. Try portraying, with-
out apology, a happy, healthy
love affair between two wom-
en, and offer—of all things—
a happy ending. The tricky
part is to make it all take
place not in fantasyland but
in the American South, during
the time between the two
world wars, and to make it
believable.

A writer who can do this,
you might say, will have out-
done herself. Indeed, Alice
Walker's new novel, The Color
Purple, is her most moving,
to date; if you are already
a Walker fan, you will real-
ize that this is no small
achievement. Her earlier
novels and stories have dis-
tinguished her as one of Am-
erica's finest fiction writ-
ers. Meridian, for example,
is one of the best books we
have about the civil rights
movement and its aftermath.

In The Color Purple we
meet women of an earlier gen-
eration who also happen to
be black women of the South,
and, like Meridian, they
change the lives of those a-
round them. The story is told
primarily by Celie, the elder
of the two sisters who suffer
a strange fate. In her raw
Southern vernacular, Celie
writes letters to God, be-
cause the man she believes
to be her father repeatedly
rapes her, telling her she'd
better "not never tell nobody
but God. It'd kill your mam-
my." Celie bears two children,
both of whom the stepfather
takes away. Later, he more
or less forces her into mar-
riage with a man who had want-
ed her younger sister instead.

There is certainly no love
in the marriage for either of
them, but Celie endures liv-
ing with Albert and taking
care of his children. She
even helps her sister Nettie
to escape. Nettie eventually
moves to Africa with a mis-

sionary couple.

The sisters write to each
other faithfully for many
years, though neither receives
the other's letters. Nettie's
letters read less like fic-
tion and too much like dull
essays; the voice fails to
persuade. Fortunately, the
bulk of the book is given to
Celie's voice, which is un-
equivocally the real thing:

"One good thing 'bout the
way he never do any work

'round the place, us never
miss him when he gone.

Five days later I look way
off up the road and see the
wagon coming back. It got
sort of a canopy over it now,
made out of old blankets or
something. My heart begin to
beat like fury, and the fir-
st thing I try to do is
change my dress.

But too late for that.
By the time I git my head and arm
out the old dress, I see the
wagon pull up in the yard."

In the wagon is Shug (pro-
nounced like "sugar") Avery,
the most beautiful woman
Celie has ever seen, a singer
notorious for her longstand-
ing affair with Albert. Celie
nurses Shug back to health,
and for the first time in
her life, falls in love. Shug
returns her love, and the af-
fair between these two women
is one of the most positive
portrayals of a lesbian rela-
tionship in the history of
literature. In Walker's work
characters are defined neith-
er by their race nor by their
sexual preference; they simp-
ly are, and Walker accepts
them and lets us get to know
them.

Shug Avery, like Meridian
in another Walker novel,
transforms the lives of those
around her. One of these is
Albert, Celie's husband. He
beats Celie, but the greatest
abuse is his concealment of
Nettie's letters—a kind of
revenge for being denied the
sister he wanted. Because of
Shug, Celie is at last able
to read the letters. Albert
also stops beating Celie, and
when he learns that Shug and
Celie are lovers, he performs
the leap of understanding:
“It don't surprise me you love
Shug Avery," he say. "I have
loved Shug Avery all my life."
Eventually the former husband
and wife can acknowledge that
they are not happy within
their marriage, but that they
can be happy separately and
as friends. Communication and
sharing grow. Loving Shug,
like loving Meridian, becomes
an ennobling occupation.

The coincidence is hardly
accidental, for Walker affirms
a spiritual identity in her
heroines. They are mission-
aries of compassion and a
transcendence that does not
require ruthless self-abnega-
tion. Shug's endearing qual-
ity is a boundless exuberance,
founded on her unorthodox
faith:

"Here's the thing," say
Shug. "The thing I believe.
God is inside you and inside
everybody else. . .

"It?" I ast.

"the best stuff God did. And
when you know God loves ‘em
you enjoys ‘em a lot more.

"God don't think it dirty?"
I ast.

"Naw," she say. "God made it.
Listen, God love everything
you love—and a mess of stuff
you don't. But more than any-
thing else, God love admira-
tion.

"You saying God vain?" I
ast.

"Naw," she say. "Not vain,
just wanting to share a good
thing. I think it pisses God
off if you walk by the color
purple in a field somewhere
and don't notice it.

"What it do when it pissed
off?" I ast.

"Oh, it make something el-
se. People think pleasing
God is all God care about.
But any fool living in the
world can see it always try-
ing to please us back.”

While Celie and the other
characters suffer much, what
prevails is joy—no highfal-
uting abstract sermonizing,
but pure, concrete expres-
sions in the mouths of peo-
ple with real voices. Her
characters' complex lives il-
lustrate the dangers and de-
pendencies of human nature,
yet into these lives Walker
(who considers herself only
the "medium" through which
her characters come to us)
brings change and growth,
and often triumphant libera-
