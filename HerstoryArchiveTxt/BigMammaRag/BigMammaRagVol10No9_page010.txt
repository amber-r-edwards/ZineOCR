Kay Young  

I'm Linda Lane, a thirty-two  
year old white dyke, recovering  
alcoholic. My father was  
working class. My mother was  
middle class. I am a detox  
worker. I work with wet alco-  
holics. I need to witness  
here what happened to Carmen,  
I don't want this to happen  
again. I don't ever want to  
witness this again and not  
try to stop it.  

My name is Kay Young. I was  
a witness/participant to Car-  
men's removal from the Michi-  
gan Women's land. I want to  
write what I saw and heard  
because I believe in the re-  
sponsibility to share inform-  
ation. I also know I did not  
try to stop something I felt  
was wrong. I've had time to  
think about why and, to the  
extent that what hung me up  
might do the same to others,  
I feel there is value in dis-  
cussing it. I'm a thirty-four  
year old white lesbian with a  
middle class background. I'm  
a school bus driver and was a  
private therapy patient.  

On Sunday, Aug. 15th we  
were sitting and talking in  
the healing area when a woman  
in a green shirt came and  
told us, there is an emer-  
gency, we need help to clear  
the area. We walked toward  
the main pathway and heard a  
health tent worker asking us  
to make a line to block the  
pathway to make room for an  
ambulance. Linda asked the  
woman in the green shirt what was  
going on. Green shirt replied,  
"I can't deal with you about  
it now." Asked again, she sta-  
ted, a woman is having mental  
problems. At this point Car-  
men was brought out. She was  
being carried by a group of  
women. She was naked and  
struggling against the women  
who held her. She cried out  
no to these women and said,  
they want to take me off the  
women's land, they are treat-  
ing me like men and women, I  
appeal to you from my heart  
don't let them take me. She  
was then stuffed into a van.  
Green shirt then told us to  
move down the road to clear  
it for the van. The van had  
a flat and she was removed to  
another car for transporta-  
tion off the land.  

One of the health tent  
workers called a meeting to  
discuss what had happened.  

Women's Music Festival:  

Some of the women who were  
responsible for removing Car-  
men from the land were pre-  
sent, along with other women  
who had been in the vicinity.  
At the meeting, Carmen was re-  
ferred to as Cardemun. We  
were told she had had a psy-  
chotic break. We were told  
she had first been noticed on  
Friday, rushing the day stage,  
grabbing a performer and  
talking in what was called a  
“word salad" (a psychiatric  
term meaning generally  
stringing together nonsensi-  
cal words; example: "table,  
sky, foot..."). We were told  
she had again tried to rush  
the stage that night and had  
broken the glasses of a guard  
who had tried to stop her.  
Green shirt, the doctor, said  
she had been called to the  

night stage to see if Carmen  
had any physical problems,  
but she had run away. The  
doctor and another med worker  
said there had been hours of  
consultation between health  
workers and the highest fes-  
tival organizers. They said  
one of their main concerns  
was that she was roaming a-  
round with insufficient cloth-  
ing and was not taking care  
of herself. (Lots of women  
were naked.) They said Carmen  
had come voluntarily to the  
med tent on Sunday and the  
osteopath had adjusted every  
bone in her body but she had  
continued to cry and be up-  
set. About this time the de-  
cision was made to take her  
to Hart for psychiatric treat-  
ment because the med tent wo-  
man didn't know what to do to

insure her safety and the  
safety of others. A woman in  
the meeting had been lying  
next to Carmen and had been  
talking to her in the med  
tent when a group of women  
approached, took Carmen by  
her shoulder and told her she  
was going to the hospital.  
She was then restrained and  
dragged off. Someone asked if  
Carmen was with friends and  
if there had been an effort  
to contact them. The response  
was it wasn't a priority be-  
cause the friends of a men-  
tally ill person often parti-  
cipate in the illness and  
they might just have compli-  
cated the situation, but they  
were still checking it out.  

A woman with red hair said  
she was very angry that Car-  
men had been taken off with  

=Tea Schook/BMR  
no clothes and dirt and lea-  
ves in her hair. She said she  
knew from her own experience  
that a disheveled appearance  
can lead other people to be-  
lieve you're crazy. The doc-  
tor said, there is a differ-  
ence between running around  
naked, with leaves in your  
hair, worshipping the goddess  
and doing the same thing and  
being crazy. She then said,  
if a woman comes in with a  
certain set of symptoms I  
know I'm looking at pneumonia  
and when she comes in with  
the symptoms Carmen had I  
know she's psychotic. We were  
then assured some women would  
stay with Carmen through the  
whole process.  

At Sunday night's concert  
we saw some women up front  
trying to raise the issue of  

what happened to Carmen. They  
were very persistent and fin-  
ally drew a response from the  
stage. The response was that  
this was a place for music  
not other issues, that it  
would be unfair to raise one  
issue and not other equally  
important ones, that the pol-  
itical tent would be open to  
anyone who wanted to discuss  
it and that a statement would  
be available after the con-  
cert. The women kept calling  
for the statement to be read,  
but were shut down. There was  
a mixed response from the aud-  
ience with some women wanting  
the statement and others the  
music. The concert continued.  
We left and went to the poli-  
tical tent which was complete-  
ly closed. A number of con-  
cerned and curious women  
started arriving and together  
we opened the tent. We shared  
what we knew of what had hap-  
pened to Carmen. Other women  
had other information and  
shared it. Two women told the  
gathering they had met Carmen  
that afternoon in Hart. She  
was barefoot, did not have  
her belongings and had simply  
been left at the hospital  
which she had walked away  
from. It was at this point  
we learned that her name was  
Carmen and not Cardemun as we  
had been told. The two women  
were asked by Carmen to deli-  
ver a message to her friends  
and to help get her things.  
When they tried to take care  
of Carmen's business they  
were told everything was al-  
ready taken care of. Another  
woman told us that she had  
been sitting in the differ-  
ently abled area near the  
stage the night Carmen was  
supposed to have been so dis-  
ruptive and dangerous. She  
said that Carmen had been  
dancing and trying to comm-  
unicate with the members of  
Cheveré in her own language,  
Spanish.  

There were different stra-  
tegies discussed to deal with  
the situation. Many women  
were outraged at how the fes-  
tival was dealing with the  
racism and the control of the  
stage and also at how unwill-  
ing the organizers were to  
deal upfront. They were  
hiding information and not  
letting women draw their own  
conclusions. A woman who was  
working at the healing tent  
showed up and said she be-  

national  

“They Want To Take Me Off The Land"  

lieved Carmen was back on the  
land and being cared for in  
a quiet place, but she wasn't  
sure.  

This is the best way we  
know how to tell you, reader,  
what happened. It is outrag-  
eous, so outrageous you ask  
why didn't we stop it, be-  
cause we were there. We want  
to discuss our process why we  
did not stop it.  

From Kay:  

There were two main reasons  
that hung me up. The first  
was just the phrase "mental  
problems." I believe that in  
Amerika the area called "men-  
tal health" functions much  
like a religion. Instead of  
telling people not to do some-  
thing because it is sinful,  
we're told don't because it  
is crazy. Crazy is a word  
that is purposely left unde-  
fined. Since it is so broad,  
it can be applied to anyone  
whose behavior is unaccep-  
table to people in power. It  
has been used against women  
for loving women, against  
people whose anger at the  
ripped off quality of their  
lives has brought them to  
violence, used against those  
whose pain was not suffered  
in the proper muted fashion.  
At the same time "crazy" has  
a lot of other defined sup-  
posed symptoms. Words like  
psychotic, passive-aggressive,  
depression, etc., are said to  
have special meanings which  
are only known to mental  
health specialists. This  
makes them like religious  
professionals, people of  
knowledge and power who are  
not supposed to be questioned.  

I feel that even though I  
have had doubts about much of  
the mental health religions  
I was still accepting one of  
the prime tenets which is  
"let the experts deal with  
it." By abdicating my right  
to concern myself with what  
was being done to Carmen, I  
participated in an injustice  
and reinforced one of socie-  
ty's power systems.  

The second reason that  
stopped me was a fear of res-  
ponsibility. I know out of my  
own experience, there are  
people in the world who eith-  
er cannot care for them-  
selves or need a lot of help.  
People and their friends and  
family are often caught in a  
gap. This is the gap between  
wonderful ideals such as  

friendship groups and self-  
support cooperatives and  
dehumanizing institutions  
such as psychiatric institu-  
tions, jails, and nursing  
homes. I was afraid Carmen  
might be someone who could  
not care for herself and that  
somehow I would get caught  

men was having mental  
problems, I shuddered, I refused  
to hear what she said no I  
did not hear it. I must have  
misunderstood, act confused  

Linda. I had "mental problems"  

once, I was confined, I was  
given thorazine, I was an  
active alcoholic. No, I heard  

“Artist Unknown/Triple Jeopardy  

with her in that gap. This  
was patronizing in that I did  
not think of asking Carmen  
what she wanted or could sug-  
gest and it was individual-  
istic in that I did not think  
to ask other women for their  
ideas or help. Individualism  
is a self-defeating habit of  
thought that is encouraged in  
this society. When we look at  
any situation only through  
one set of experiences we  
leave out every different  
way of viewing the world,  

and every different way of  
problem solving. When we at-  
tempt to deal with situations  
only with our own resources  
we are setting ourselves up  
for failure.  

From Linda:  

I have thought very hard  
and struggled with myself on  
my inaction. A wise recover-  
ing alcoholic black woman  
said, "Be who you are and  
tell what you know." I am a  
recovering woman who should  
not have lived, but I did. I  
know that racism, classism,  
sexism, imperialism, anti-  
semitism kills. It is my job  
to stay alive and to fight  
back. I forgot my commitment  
to be and to tell; because I  
forgot I allowed Carmen to be  
torn from the land. When  
green shirt told me that Car-  

wrong. I'll just help clear  
the area because the woman  
must be bleeding, dying and  
needs to go to the hospital.  
When I saw Carmen naked,  
screaming, terrified and  
restrained, I wouldn't let  
myself see or hear her. I  
just couldn't believe what  

I saw or that I participated  
in this and I ran away. I was  
angry, I was cold, afraid, I  
didn't want to feel anything  

I wanted to hide. I was afraid  

for my life. Like the times I  
had been drinking and woke up  
sick and tremulous and could-  
n't recall where I was and  
what I did, but I knew it was  
bad and if I just lay very  
still in a closet no one  
would find me, but I could  
hear them coming. That's how  
I felt. Keep cool, act smart.  
I was afraid I'd go next. I  
felt alone when the medical  
woman talked about Carmen's  
psychotic break. It was po-  
werful. Just say psychotic  
break and most people will  
react to it. Violent madness,  
make demons out of us. Hide  
the children, run for cover -  
stand back, they (crazies)  
are going to self-destruct  
and take us all with them.  
Psychiatry has created the  
best con of all time - just  
say "psychotic break" and  

Big  

watch them scatter. Your lo-  
ver, sister, mother, friend,  
a stranger will become a mon-  
ster beyond all recognition.  
"Psychotic break" requires  
little investigation. Get ‘em  
out of here before we are all  
murdered. That's what happen-  
ed to Carmen. No history, no  
information, no nothing, but  
we knew everything 'cause the  
doctor said "psychotic break."  

What happened to Carmen,  
for us, connected to many  
other issues. These are ideas  
and questions that have ari-  
sen while thinking about  
Carmen. We wanted to believe  
we were in a different world  
at Michigan. We wanted to  
trust each other. We wanted  
to help. What we forgot was  
to find out if we shared com-  
mon basic values with the wo-  
men we wanted to help at the  
medical tent. In this case we  
did not. They wanted to throw  
a woman into the psychiatric  
system. Women can and do par-  
ticipate in all the oppres-  
sive systems in Amerika. In  
the outside world we feel  
powerless. At Michigan we  
feel powerful. We believe we  
have power and we are even  
invited to participate in the  
power and use it against Car-  
We wanted to believe we  
were safe because we were a-  
mong women but we weren't, we  
only thought we were.  

We wanted to believe we  
were not racist, and the fact  
that when Carmen spoke in  
English, it was not her first  
language, was not important,  
because we were all women and  
cared for each other. But  
what was happening was we  
were white women trusting  
white women and the powerless  
trusting the powerful.  

The women who took control  
over Carmen's life did not  
involve Carmen in their deci-  
sion making. How could they?  
They didn't even know her  
name. They did not really at-  
tempt to involve her friends  
or women who shared her lan-  
guage and culture. They did  
not ask for help from the  
festival community. They only  
talked to other health pro-  
fessionals. We believe that  
the "highest festival organ-  
izers" feared if this issue  
got out it would be disrup-  
tive to their control and  
ultimately their profit.
