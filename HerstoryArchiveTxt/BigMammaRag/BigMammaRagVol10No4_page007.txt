The Survival Of Female Power In Peru

Andrea Gabriel

In many places where con-
quering armies have imposed
new religions on conquered
peoples, old deities were not
destroyed. Instead, the con-
querors required that their
own deities be added to those
already important in the re-
gion or locality. The Spanish
were adept at overlooking
surviving pre-Catholic relig-
ious practices in Latin Amer-

ica. However, they relent-
lessly persecuted those who
refused to worship the Chris-
tian God or to put themselves
under the authority of Cath-
olic priests.

In Peru, center of the In-
ca empire before Spanish col-
onial rule, women who heard
the "confessions" of other
women were accused of witch-
craft and idolatry. They were
nevertheless tolerated if
they translated other women's
confessions to the priest.
Translators were called her-
manas mayores (older sisters),
and were inclined to make lib-
eral translations that omit-
ted "sins" not traditionally
regarded as sinful.

Many female leaders refused
to be coopted in any way by
the church. Some fled to the
puna (high mountain areas) un-
der persecution, where women
remain to this day practicing
their native religion, in par-
tial seclusion from men. They
have received the protection
of village men who recognize
that "the women in the puna
are living in the ways our
ancestors lived years ago,
they are defending our cus-
toms, they are defending our
culture." However, when vil-
lage men do things the women
disapprove of, the women will
stone them and refuse to see
them. They have also been
known to kill their male child-
ren in protest against men's
submission to outsiders.

Although the Spanish accus-
ed Peru's medicine women of
consorting with the devil, na-
tive religion does not include
a belief in "good" and "evil."
Sickness, war, famine, etc.,
are thought to be caused by
imbalance. Wisdom from snakes
or cats, or from the spirits
of dead ancestors, can help
create balance out of imbal-
ance. When villagers refused
to reveal the whereabouts of
medicine women on the grounds
that the village would suffer
bewitchment, they were ca-
tering to the Spaniards' own
beliefs, while actually con-
spiring to protect the women
from persecution.

To this day, in village
ceremonies and meetings, wom-
en sit in a group, separate
from men. While they seldom
participate freely in dis-
cussions, women will protest
as a group if the men make
decisions that are contrary
to their interests. They some-
times refuse to go to their
houses or threaten subversion
of the men's plans if they
feel important interests have
been violated.

Before colonial rule, And-
ean communities had a dual
system of religion and govern-
ment. Sister and brother dei-
ties were worshipped. The
creator was "neither male nor
female." Village councils, or
allyus, had parallel male and
female structures. Parallel-
ism existed also at the pro-
vincial level, and there is
evidence that women through-
out the Inca empire were unit-
ed organizationally. This par-
allelism still exists in some
form everywhere - and is being
reborn in the women's move-
ment, where the Women's Com-
mission of Peru's largest Left
political coalition has
achieved autonomy from male
party leadership (see BMR,
November, 1981). The Spanish
were quite successful, howev-
er, in gaining the allegiance
of the male curacas (politi-
cal leaders) and in violating
the reciprocity, not only be-
tween women and men, but also
between leaders and the com-
munities they served.

To avoid mita (conscription
to work in the mines), men
would sometimes pawn their
wives to the Spanish, giving
credence to the idea of male
"ownership" of women. This
violated the traditional bal-
ance or harmony (ayni) be-
tween individuals, considered
to be necessary for sexual re-
lations. Priests also raped
and prostituted women, and
found partners for them after
they became pregnant, using
their priestly authority to
legitimize marriages not con-
stituted by ayni. Protest a-
gainst marriage is still a
recurrent theme in Peruvian
folksongs sung by women.

Through taxation, the
State and the Catholic Church
forced peasants into the mar-
ket economy. Women were en-
couraged by the Spanish to
live in their husbands' allyu
to avoid double taxation.
Women often lost land, inher-
ited from their mothers, be-
cause it was sacrificed to
pay the taxes.

Women and men in Peru
traditionally worked together
on communal tasks. All tasks
were shared even though men
and women participated diff-
erently (men holding down an
animal, for instance, while
a woman performed the kill).
During Spanish rule, men were
conscripted for the mita
while women were sometimes
locked alone in rooms to
weave and spin. Women were
kept out of schools and
guilds. Spanish law required
that male children inherit
authority in their families,
violating the traditional
system of authority based on
order of birth rather than
gender.

It was naturally easier
for men to accept Spanish
rule than it was for women
because men received special
"privileges" over women in
return. Even so, some Peru-
vian men have seen the error
of their ways and are ac-
quiescing to the new militan-
cy among women in Peru. Wide-
spread celebrations honoring
Pachamama and Mamaquilla
(goddesses of the earth and
moon, of production and re-
production) are a symbol of
defiance against foreign
ways far more important than
the government-inspired re-
enactment of the Inca's an-
nual sacrifice to the sun.
The latter is a tourist at-
traction, while the former
is an authentic survival of
native culture.

Men's respect for the
contemporary feminist move-
ment in Peru is tempered by
their understandable defense
of Spanish machismo on the
individual level. However, on
the political level, many men
understand intuitively that
women's complaints are jus-
tified and that women's
organization is necessary to
bring about the age-old re-
ciprocity once enjoyed by
both women and men.
