when she phoned to try to talk with  
him, his grandparents refused. She is  
faced with a double dilemma, she has  

to be extradited to Florida to clear  
herself of federal charges, which carry  
a five year sentence if she is found  
guilty. She also risks losing her new-  
born son, as a Colorado Protective  
Service had started to take some action  
to gain possession of him. They drop-  
ped the action, but she is not sure  
what they will do. She has to pay not  
only the lawyers in Colorado but also  
the lawyer in Florida to fight the  
federal charges and try to get legal  
custody of her son.  

Concerned parents that Fremo knows  
have started a trust fund to help her  
pay legal fees. She needs money to  
fight extradition and custody, and she  
is asking women to help her. The Joan  
Fremo Trust Fund, Western National  
Bank, P.O. Box 9250, Colorado Springs,  
CO 80932  

If further information is desired,  
you may contact her by writing to  
BMR and your letters will be forwarded  
to Joan Fremo. Send money only to  
the trust fund, not to BMR office.

BMR: Was there an urban/rural split?  
Carol: The needs of rural women were  
not discussed because there were few  
rural women there. There were only two  
disabled women there and we would like  
more disabled women represented in the  
next conferences.  

BMR: Were there any prisoners there?  
Carol: No, but Colorado intends to do  
outreach in that area.  

BMR: Were there any class conflicts?  
Carol: One of the more obvious was a  
dinner at a swank Japanese restaurant  
overlooking Beverly Hills given by a  
prominent lesbian from Los Angeles.  
Delegates had their way paid, but ob-  
servers had to pay $15. Some delegates  
boycotted the dinner because they felt  
this was classist. The steering comm-  
ittee needs to be balanced in terms of  
class.  

BMR: What was one of the major things  
not accomplished at the conference?  
Carol: We tended to assume that we all  
either knew or agreed on our reasons  
and common goals for establishing a  
national lesbian feminist organization.  
We didn't talk enough about why we  
wanted it. And I feel that is going to  
prove to be a major obstacle in the  
functioning of the NLFO in the future.

from page 4  

the most criticism were as follows:  

"I not only appreciate but share  
your outrage at Larry Constantine's  
garbage...People here basically believe  
that most people will in fact have a  
negative reaction to this male over  
intellectualized bullshit. Vascon-  
cellos must have his head (or some-  
thing) screwed on wrong. Liberal 'do-  
gooders' like him continue to lead  
this society down very strange paths."  

"I have this fantasy of a huge giant  
sticking his dick in Constantine's  
tiny baby mouth or ass and then ask  
him if his sucking urge was satisfied."  

In her testimony Mondanaro explained  
that this imagery was designed to  
illustrate what it's like to be raped  
by someone much bigger than you. She  
stated that as a pediatrician she had  
once seen a six month old baby that  
was raped by an adult. "The vaginal  
and rectal orifices were completely  
obliterated,” she said.  

Dr. Mondanaro filed an appeal which  
led to the abovementioned hearings.  
When her attorneys asked that Brown  
be brought before the public hearing,  
the Governor refused and offered in-  
stead a private disposition. Brown's  
behavior was questionable throughout  
the hearings. He was quoted as once  
stating "nobody cares about drug ad-  
dicts because they don't vote." And  
whether it was the letter itself or  
Dr. Mondanaro's homosexuality, it was  
clear that Brown wanted to avoid a  
political embarrassment at all costs.  

Because of Mondanaro's outstanding  
performance as an employee and because  
of the nature of the letter, the state  
personnel board voted 4-1 to reinstate  
her. If the letter had not been  
concerned with child abuse, but a less  
popular cause (i.e. homosexuality  
itself) it is unlikely that the hear-  
ings would have ended so favorably.  
But for now the result is one woman's  
victory over a state government that  
may prove to be as corrupt as Nixon's  
Washington.

Custody Case  
from page 3  

ered that the last day of the trial  

had been lost. The attorneys present  
that day will have to reconstruct from  
memory and their notes what went on in  
court that day.  

Phyllis Warren, when questioned at  
the AFSC meeting about potential  
precedents to be set by the case,  
pointed out child custody is a state  
matter, so the case would be a direct  
precedent only in New Jersey. How-  
ever, because there is so little case  
law in this field, those cases that  
have been settled are widely quoted  
all over the country.
