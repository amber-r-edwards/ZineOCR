and must among Third World
peoples, there will be pro-
gressive whites who join in.
This is nothing more or less
than the legacy of John Brown,
and many others.

Finally, military attacks
against the system, including
expropriations of money, al-
ways develop in response to
tyranny and repression.

Not all these issues are
easily resolved, but one thing
is clear: progressive people
must not allow the government
to use this case as an oppor-
tunity to further divide and
isolate. Those who join with
the government in denouncing
this as terrorism, as so many
have done regarding Puerto
Rican independence fighters,
do so at their own risk. Once
the government has swept sec-
tions of the progressive move-
ments to its side, it proceeds
to undermine and destroy all
sections. The focus of all
response to the Brinks bust
must be criticism of the state
and the system which have
created the conditions for

such activity. This does not
mean that criticism should be
muzzled, but it does require
a critical sense of who the
enemy really is - and who the
terrorists really are.
