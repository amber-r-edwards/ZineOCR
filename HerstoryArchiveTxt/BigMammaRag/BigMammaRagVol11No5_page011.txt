Tools of Repression Cannot

Ann Hansen and Julie Belmas

On Jan. 20, 1983, while we
were travelling along the
Squamish Highway, we were
stopped by cops posing as
highway flag persons. Seconds

canada

after
the vehicle stopped, at
least 30 men in camo-fatigues
armed to the teeth with auto-
matic rifles, shotguns and

large caliber handguns, in
unison attacked the vehicle
we were in. They all swarmed
from positions in the sur-
rounding hillside and from
a large dump truck
stuck on the highway.
While stampeding

the vehicle

they smashed a window and
shot in tear gas. All the
cops were screaming hysteri-

cally while they ripped us

out of the truck and threw us
on the ground. They kept
shouting not to move or we'd

be shot while they stuck
their rifles into our backs
and pressed their handguns
to our heads. Our faces were
forced down into the ground
so that we couldn't check on
one another. We all thought
that one of us had been shot
when we heard a tear gas
shell being fired.

It was horrible having to
lay passive to the whims of
these crazed military ex-
tremists and their guns. We
could imagine how other wom-
yn felt in other countries
especially being unarmed and
having to survive and accept
the horror and death of a mil-
itary attack in their vil-
lages and homes. The feeling
is too extreme to explain.

It suddenly becomes
clear that these men with
their guns are ready to kill
you. They seemed very hyper
and unpredictably insecure.
The slightest movement could
startle them causing their
fingers to spasmodically jerk
and kill.

What is happening in Canada
today in reaction to the re-
cent sabotage of Checkye-
Dunsmuir and the firebombing
of the Red Hot Video outlets
is not unconnected to the pol-
itical repression used against
people resisting in other
parts of the world. In other
countries where the liberation
movements are strong and ac-
tive enough to threaten the

government and corporate in-
terests, counter-insur-
gency forces respond instant-
ly with extreme violence. The
tools of repression are inter-
nationally devised and are

used explicitly for political
purposes! Every power struc-
ture in the world is paranoid
of the people seeing through
their facade and rebelling
against their authority. The
ultimate weapon of the people
has always been militant re-
sistance, and all police
states are constantly devel-
oping their violent repres-
sive apparatus to use against
the people to protect their

interests.

Being womyn identified, po-
litically conscious, environ-
mentalists and determined to
challenge a society that ins-
titutionalizes rape and mutilation, we refuse to ac-
cept their labels of us as
terrorists. We know that there
are many sisters who share
the analysis of the charges laid
against us for centuries. The
authorities reacted vio-
lently to womyn who resisted;
they used to brand us as
"witches" and burned us; now
they label us as "terrorists"
and will try to bury us in
their cement tombs.

The state and its media are
portraying us as elements of a
“lunatic fringe" so that peo-
ple will be frightened of us
instead of relating to us with
their rebellious spirits. We
must not allow the liberalism
of this society to hide the
sicknesses of the rulers and
rapers behind their institu-
tions, laws and lies. We are
always threatened with their
violence, whether it be
through nuclear power plants,
nuclear weapons, industrial-
ism, prisons or sexual terror-
ism in our everyday society.
We will face their horrors
boldly and challenge their
corporate interests with the
determination and strength of
womyn warriors. We will see a
resistance movement building
in Canada, in an attempt to
rid the earth of further cor-
porate destruction so that

future generations can sur-
vive.
Since our arrests, we have

felt a responsibility to the
womyn's community to outline
why we feel the womyn's move-
ment must transform itself
into a womyn's resistance
movement that is capable of

smashing patriarchy.
For so many centuries and in
many societies, the patri-
archy has separated the sis-
ters from the brothers. Such
institutions have stunted and
mutilated our human potential
by robbing womyn of the power
to control their own lives,
while making our brothers our
rulers and rapers. Throughout
their lives, womyn are prevent-
ed from developing the so-
called "male qualities" of
strength, aggression, power,
reason and intellect, while

simultaneously teaching men
to have contempt for the so-
called "female qualities" of
sensitivity, spirituality,
sensuousness and emotionalism.
There is no biological rea-
son why the male and female
qualities can't live harmoni-
ously inside the same body.
But instead, patriarchal so-

cialization has torn apart
our rich and complex inner
beings, leaving us pathetic
shells of womyn and men whose
only function is to perform
profitably for the capitalis-
tic system.

The world has almost always
been dominated by patriarchal
societies, but none so mani-
fests the male qualities on
all levels and has so strip-
ped womyn of all value as the
modern industrial culture. It
is the historical epitome of
patriarchy. Office towers,
cars, strip mines and nuclear
arms are the physical tribute
to man. There is no balance
in the corporate industrial-
ized world. There is no room
for sensitivity and sharing.
The balance is dangerously
clear, precipitating

the crisis.

The all-pervasive economic
system has created a society
based on consumer products and our re-
lationship to all life is
based upon economic rela-
tions. People are not appre-
ciated for their kindness or
goodness but are valued and
identified through their ec-
onomic roles, that is, their
jobs and consumer status. Our
natural environment is per-
ceived as a resource base to
be developed. If the land
can't be raped in some way
through lumbering, mining or
some other industry, then,
it is considered worthless.
Animals are perceived as po-
tential sport, food or pets.
Outside of their economic
value to man, other living
creatures are not recognized
for their wisdom, skill and
ability to survive in harm-
ony with the earth. When in-
digenous and third world peo-
ple resist the encroachment
of industrialism on their
land, they are forced to move
or are exterminated through
terrorism, forced steriliza-
tion, starvation and alcohol-
ism. All beings, if they are
unprofitable or an impediment
to the expansion of imper-
ialism, are wiped out.

The capitalist economic
system has become so pervas-
ive throughout society that
its relations and values of
consumerism permeate all as-
pects of our lives. As a re-
sult of this, people have be-

international

Determination of Womyn Warriors

come blind and incapable of
experiencing the richness and
depth of the natural world--
forests, mountains, water,
animals and other humans.

In the industrialized world
a womyn's value is also def-
ined by the economic rela-
tions of the marketplace. She
is defined by her profitabil-
ity to the system as a wait-
ress, doctor, secretary or
slave labourer in the home.
Any other qualities that she
may have, with the exception
of her male-defined sexuality,
are not valued by the society.

As the industrialized world
sinks into a depression with

“Bonnie Acker/Fight Back

soaring unemployment, womyn
are the first to lose their
already menial jobs, thus be-
coming completely worthless
to a ruthless economic system
where profitability defines
everything. The only consist-
ent value that a womyn has in
the corporate economy is as

a sex object. By perversely
associating her sexuality
with consumer products, busi-
nessmen can sell more prod-
ucts while conversely, the
womyn, as consumers, are
taught to buy all kinds of
junk to try to improve their
sexual attractiveness. Think
of the sexual womyn with the
low-cut gown sitting on the
Rolls-Royce; is she any more
intelligent, strong or com-
passionate than the car?

Because womyn throughout
their lives are stripped of
all value other than their
sexuality, they are essential-
ly objectified. In their re-
lationships with men and oth-
er womyn, they are not respec-
ted for their mental ability,
strength and competency. They
are regarded with contempt for
their female qualities by
equating them with stupidity
and weakness. Throughout her
youth, a girl is brought up
to be a sex object, and when
she is too old to fulfill
that role, she becomes an old
womyn and is treated like a
piece of garbage.

The same institutions and
values that teach people to
see trees as lumber, moun-
tains as mining resources,
old people as pensioners and
children as unruly trouble,
teach us that womyn are sex
objects. The rape of forests
by lumbering companies and
the rape of womyn can ulti-

mately be attributed to the
same criminals--the men that
rule the industrial complex.
The decisions to designate
vast areas of the earth as
"sacrifice areas" in the name
of industrial progress and
the decision to sacrifice the
El Salvadorean people in the
name of "freedom," is made
by the same exploiters in
control of the multinational
economy. The wealthy fur com-
panies that purchase seal
pelts are the same companies
that use womyn as sex objects
to sell their fur coats.

It is not possible in this
society to be a liberated
womyn without being in a con-
stant state of conflict and
struggle. However, if our con-
flict and struggle is not
guided by a consciousness of
the magnitude of the problem,
then our energies will be
misdirected and futile.

We do not want equality and
equal pay in this patriarchal
society. We do not want equal
job opportunities to work in
their office towers, their
lumber companies, their nuc-
lear power plants. We do not
want to be aggressive, compe-
titive female replicas of the
men that rule this society.
We want to develop a feminist
resistance movement that em-
braces a means of survival
that allows us to flourish
and grow as rich human beings
living in harmony with the
earth.

The womyn's movement cannot

be a one-issue oriented strug-
gle, but must understand and
embrace the ecological strug-
gle, indigenous peoples' re-
sistance and anti-imperialist
liberation movements because
the same patriarchal institu-
tions that perpetuate our op-
pression also oppress the
animals, the indigenous peo-
ples, the third world peoples
and the earth.

On Jan. 20, 1983, we were
forcibly transferred from a
minimum security society into
a maximum security prison. We
are new and different to the
prison system. We are politi-
cal prisoners. As long as
there are injustices happen-
ing, there will be political-
ly active people in prison.
Although these cement tombs
are torture, are we that much
less free than those caught
up in the "free" business
world and the supposed democ-
racy of this society? We will
survive.

The authorities plan to use
the threat of imprisonment to
contain the development of any
forms of resistance that are
not state-sanctioned. They
believe that prisons will be
an effective deterrent to us,
yet they do not understand
that the true spirit of free-
dom cannot be subdued. We
want people to know that our

physical freedom may be limit-
ed, but mentally we remain
free. Our group unity is
strong and individually we
are all politically dedicated
to living through this crap.

We feel strong solidarity
with feminist womyn who are
dedicated to questioning
themselves for truth and who
have the sensitivity and pol-
itical consciousness to never
create power struggles and
oppressive orders again. We
are sisters forever.

* While we wholeheartedly
support these womyn's strug-
gles, we object to some of
the terminology used to des-
cribe the enemy...crazed,
paranoid and sick. Ann and
Julie themselves reject the
term "lunatic fringe" in this
article as a description of
their valid anger and acti-
vism! Well, these terms also
negate the seriousness and
deliberate power and oppres-
sive acts on the part of the
government, police and indus-

try. These terms blur the is-
sue. Also, by using these terms
we feed into another system of
oppression...psychological
therapy and theory. Paranoid,
for example, means an irration-
al or unfounded fear and sus-
picion of another, and yet
when referring to “every pow-
er structure" as being "para-
noid of people seeing through
their facade and rebelling a-
gainst their authority," these
powers indeed must fear this
because, in fact, those op-
pressed will eventually all
rise up and fight back!
