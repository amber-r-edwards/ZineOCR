Mine Shaft

Eight women miners in  
Wheeling, West Virginia, have  
filed suit against Consoli-  
dated Coal Company for viola-  
tion of privacy. The miners  
claim the company offered  
their male co-workers the  
fringe benefit of installing  
a peephole in the women's  
bathhouse for the men to peer  
through, and that the company  
failed to notify the women  
or correct the situation.

Pay In San Jose

City workers in San Jose  
overwhelmingly approved a con-  
tract July 14th that union of-  
ficials said was a major step  
toward giving women the same  
pay as men for comparable  
work. The two-year agreement  
offers $1.5 million to cor-  
rect wage inequalities. The  
2,000 workers represented by  
AFSCME Local 101 walked off  
the job for nine days in the  
strike for equal wages.

Dressed to Bomb

After the Pittsburgh Press  
ran an ad for "Dressed to  
Kill" that read, "What hap-  
pens to Kate in the shower is  
the latest fashion in murd-  
er," Pittsburgh's Women  
Against Sexist Violence in  
Pornography and Media tried  
to place their own ad in the  
paper: "Bomb scares are the  
latest fashion in theatres  
showing violence against  
women." The Press refused to  
run it, explaining the ad  
might lead to an increase in  
bomb scares "and then someone  
might get hurt."

Silkwood Suit

Are labor union activists  
protected against anti-civil-  
rights conspiracy when such a  
conspiracy is undertaken  
against them because of their  
organizing activities? The  
Supreme Court will decide this  
issue when it hears the appeal  
of a civil liberties lawsuit  
on behalf of Karen Silkwood,  
who was killed in a controver-  
sial car crash in 1974 while  
en route to deliver evidence of  
missing plutonium and falsifi-  
cation of safety tests at the  
Kerr McGee nuclear facility  
where she worked. The federal  
suit charges Kerr McGee offic-  
ials with criminal conspiracy  
and charges four FBI agents  
with a cover-up of these ille-  
gal activities.

War Plans

The Department of Defense  
is now asking for voluntary  
agreement from civilian health  
administrators in 17 US cities  
to allocate bed and staff to  
military casualties of "a fu-  
ture large scale war overseas"  
which will probably "begin and  
end very rapidly and produce  
casualties at a higher rate  
than any other war in his-  
tory." By the end of 1981, a  
national capacity for 50,000  
beds will be "reserved" for  
such casualties.

MX Moms

"We want nukes/We want war/  
We think oil's worth fighting  
for!" The Future Moms: for the  
MX Missile chanted this slogan  
as they held a bake sale last  
month in Boston. Some of the  
"goodies" that stopped the  
lunch hour crowd included Plu-  
tonium Fudge, Napalm Crackers,  
Trilateral Treats, Agent  
Orange Cake, and Apocalypse  
(They're Out of this World)  
Muffins. The six women who or-  
ganized the bake sale thought  
it an appropriate response to  
“the absurdity of current  
White House social policies,"  
however, some people thought  
they really were raising money  
for the MX missile.

Striking Back

One million women in the  
Netherlands, about 7% of the  
population, took part in the  
national women's strike which  
was called March 31 to protest  
against Holland's new abortion  
bill. Sit-ins, demonstrations  
and barricades were organized  
in every town to tell the gov-  
ernment that women are no  
longer willing to sit back and  
accept what is decided for  
them.

Criminal Justice

A British law officer  
who brought about the death  
of Patsy Malone during sex  
recently got off with a  
light sentence. The issue of  
how she died was never prop-  
erly revealed during the  
trial. What was stressed  
was that she was not only a  
prostitute, but a lesbian,  
and that this was enough rea-  
son for this literal butcher  
(he dismembered her body).

How Now, Mao?

The custom of concubinage  
was outlawed in China under  
Mao, but now the Kwanchow  
Evening News reports that  
the practice of men taking  
"second wives" is making a  
comeback. In Kwantung Pro-  
vince, Communist Party mem-  
bers are among those married  
men who have reportedly taken  
young concubines.

Shove It

“Many parents believe that  
we can't ban the hook be-  
cause censorship is unconsti-  
tutional. Of course, censor-  
ship is not unconstitutional.  
Censorship is condemning  
something that's wrong. The  
Communist Manifesto is okay,  
that's not obscene. But this  
book is out and out porno-  
graphy, advocacy of abortion  
and masturbation - including  
instructions on how to use  
a cucumber." These are the  
words of Marian Tucker-Honey-  
cutt, a Belfast, Maine, par-  
ent who, in the wake of a  
vote by the Belfast board of  
education in favor of keep-  
ing Our Bodies, Ourselves in  
the local high school libra-  
ry, has launched a petition  
drive to force the board to  
reverse its decision.

Stripped of Rights

Washington DC jail offici-  
als have agreed to a tempor-  
ary suspension of their  
"strip" and "squat" searches  
of women in response to a  
lawsuit filed by the ACLU on  
behalf of four women arrest-  
ed and held at the DC jail.  
Mary Morgan, arrested for  
protesting budget cuts, was  
forced to strip off all her  
clothes and have her genitals  
sprayed for "lice and crabs"  
with a substance guards  
could not identify. In the  
meantime, police in Fremont,  
California detained and  
strip-searched a woman who  
showed up at the station to  
pay a fine for failing to  
license the family dog.

Wed-un-locked

The Spanish Parliament  
approved a bill legalizing  
divorce in Spain. This  
action, taken in June, ended  
a ban on divorce that began  
after the country's 1936-  
1939 civil war.

Abortion No Option

While women in the states  
are fighting to hang on to  
abortion rights, women in  
Canada are facing a growing  
anti-abortion movement. In  
Newfoundland, it is next to  
impossible to get an abortion  
since the number of doctors  
performing the operation has  
been reduced from three to  
one. Approved applications  
for abortions have been cut  
by about 75% so that only  
three or four are approved  
weekly; with a seven week  
waiting list and a regulation  
banning abortion after the  
12th week, for many Newfound-  
land women abortion is no  
longer an option.
