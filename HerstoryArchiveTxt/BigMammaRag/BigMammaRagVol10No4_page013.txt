are all anti-Semitic. I grew
up with all the same WASP
white, blonde images as every-
body else in America and I am
sorry to say there were many
times that I wished I was not
Puerto Rican.

I reject the accusation
that my assessment of the
Jewish womyn as white is an
anti-Semitic act. I reject
the accusation that defending
my land for womyn of colour
was an anti-Semitic act.

I reject the accusation that
pointing out the racism of
individual Jewish womyn or
Jewish groups is an anti-
Semitic act.

The only womyn whose safety
became threatened in the tribe
because of this situation was
myself. Also, the person who
got physically attacked in
the name of anti-Semitism, the
one time I tried to return to
the tribe, was myself.

There is something very deep
in white people that doesn't
want them to let people like
me have any power or any vali-
dation for my struggle. I
hear the letter from the wo-
man in the Feb. issue subtly
claiming my anti-Semitism
when that accusation has been
made and validated many times.

I am waiting for anyone, ex-
cept the few womyn of colour
who learned about La Luz
after the situation was al-
ready over, to use the term
racism in describing the
challenge of white womyn for
womyn of colour land, includ-
ing the challenge by Jewish
womyn for the womyn of colour
land.

‘naide ‘Exon the problems and

differences between womyn of
colour and Jewish womyn; wo-
myn's: ‘lives: Softer: a vast: po-

_@eparate from the confines and
standards of men. 
“Part of my reason for
speaking out, aside from my
concern that anti-Semitism

may be used to obscure issues 
of racism, is the fact that

some womyn have been Lesbians 
for years and haven't heard 

about the exciting and turbu-
lent concept of womyn's
lands.

I would like to put out a
call to all the womyn who
have criticisms of me. I
think our fear of talking
about the problems is far
outweighed by the sheer crea-
tive potential of womyn liv-
ing and working together.

In closing, I would like

to say that the Jewish/womyn
of colour conflicts that I
have outlined are only one
facet of what happened when
political lesbians moved to
the country in groups.

In the hopes of bringing
this way of life to the lar-
ger womyn's community and
purging my soul, which I
sorely needed to do, I have
written a book on my exper-
iences called, The La Luz
Journal.

I am not the only womyn
involved with womyn's lands
or La Luz to write a book
but I may be the first womyn
to try to go public with the
subject.

I hope all womyn will be
encouraged to speak out about
their experiences with other
womyn and these heavy issues,
especially womyn in situa-
tions like womyn's lands that,
up till now, have not been in
the forefront of the womyn's
movement and media.

We need to know what all
womyn are doing and why and
what we have learned from
these experiences.

To womyn who are interested
in what happened to La Luz--
the land was in foreclosure
when I left the west coast
several years ago and I have
not heard any word since. I
assume it has gone back to
the patriarchy or is still
in the legal process since if
womyn of colour were living
there I probably would have
heard about it. Though that
is not necessarily true.

I hope the womyn's land
movement continues and I en-
courage womyn who own land to
consider opening it up to

collective and tribal living.

In spite of all the problems
and the conflicts, I am con-
vinced that being with womyn

Writing The Truth

Dear Big Mama Rag,

I guess I am writing this
to you because it follows up
on my January letter. I need
to be doing something right
now. On Friday March 12,
at about 5:30 pm (today) a
white womyn jumped me because
of my book, The La Luz Jour-
nal. She was with another
sixteen-year-old lesbian.

I agreed to change her mo-
ther's name in the next print-
ing and withdraw the book
from our local Co-op where
it has been on display this
week. I'm sure there were
people who doubted my fears
in the first letter, yet they
have followed me these long
years.

Because I am self-publish-
ing my book I never had to go
through a feminist collective
to discuss the ethics of us-
ing womyn's real names in my
book and basically writing
an expose on the womyn's
community.

None of the names in my
book are people's legal names
and some womyn have changed
their names several times si-
nce La Luz. I knew the ethics
of telling the story as a jo-
urnal and not a fictionalized
account were questionable.

I chose the way I did because
I thought it was important to
tell the truth.

I realize I have power in
the use of my writing. Pub-
lishing the book is a way of
taking power, of not letting
the forces grind me in the
dirt and tell me I’m no good,
and I will not stop. There is
a bruise on the

on the frame where she twisted them. This time it was

a sixteen-year-old girl who
did not want her mother's re-
al name used in the book.
Last time it was a white wo-
myn who thought I was being
anti-Semitic. I used to be
afraid of rape and murderers.
Now I'm afraid of the dykes.

I realize it is frightening
to have someone write about
you in a book over which you
have no control and I'm sure
this can be like a violation. This book is my response
to a lifetime of pain and sub-
jugation. I'm sorry if it
hurts anyone or makes other
lesbians feel more vulner-
able than we all already are.

I have exposed no one in
my book as much as myself
and I have placed no one in
financial, physical, and
emotional jeopardy as much
as myself. And the womyn who
got violently attacked by a
white womyn was again, my-
self.

I realized that my assigned
role in life is to lay
down and shut up and put up
with all manner of oppress-
ions. I am not a rapist and
I do not attack womyn. My
writing is my way of fighting
back and I will continue to
do so to the best of my
ability.

I will strive to protect
