Video display terminals
(VDTs) are computer input de-
vices and/or word processing
machines. They are comprised
of a typewriter-like keyboard
and a television-like picture
tube which displays informa-
tion typed at the keyboard
and/or returned from the com-
puter's central processing u-
nit.

The picture tube or cathode
ray tube (CRT) works on the
same principles as a televi-
sion picture tube. A high
voltage transformer generates

between 10,000 and 40,000
volts (10,000 volts for black
and white CRT and up to 40,000
for color CRTs), and feeds
this voltage to the anode of
the CRT causing the bright-
ness of the screen. Herein
lies the hazards of CRTs.
This high voltage produces
ozone and both low-level ion-
izing and non-ionizing radia-
tion. Keep in mind that view-
ers normally sit yards away
from a television screen, but
VDT operators sit only inches
away from the VDT screen. This
factor along with an average
of 40 hours a week in front

of the terminal subjects the
user to unusually large amounts
of low level radiation. Re-
member also that television
viewers were warned back in
the 1950s not to sit less
than 6 feet away from their

TV screens.

Video display terminals have
revolutionized secretarial
and office work. Their use
has saved billions of dollars
for corporate firms by drasti-
cally lowering the number of
employees needed to produce
reports, keep records, and
perform other "menial" tasks
as well as save on the costs
of paper, printing, keypunch-
ing, and storage space.

The majority of workers us-
ing VDTs are women... VDTs
are everywhere: in banks, hos-
pitals, insurance companies,
telephone, telegraph offices,
airlines, railways, buses, news
newspapers, government offices

women are reporting everywhere
side effects.

The health hazards of VDTs
fall into two main areas: the
effects on operators of low-
level, non-ionizing radiation
from the machines and what is
broadly described as poor work-
place design, leading to vis-
ual problems. Many of the
symptoms in both areas are
similar. In general it has
seemed easier to convince go-
vernments and industry to re-
spond to the poor workplace
design issue; the radiation
hazards are more controvers-
ial. The Food and Drug Ad-
ministration has discounted
the effects of constant ex-
posure to low-level radiation
in a recently released report.
In January 1980 NIOSH (Nation-

al Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health) conducted

a study of health risks ass-
ociated with working with
VDTs. Although they found

no significant chemical ex-
posure or radiation levels a-
bove government standards,
they did find higher levels

of visual and musculoskeletal
problems and more psychologic-
al distress and job stress.
Prompted by these discoveries
unions are seeking independent
experts and doing their own
epidemiological studies to
determine the extent of health
hazards.

We know that low level ra-
diation heats up tissue (as
in microwave ovens) and inter-
acts with biological systems
in ways that are not complete-
ly understood. There are a
growing number of studies,
based on experiments with an-
imals and on observations of
human beings who work with
non-ionizing radiation, such
as radar technicians, that
suggest there are serious bio-
logical effects produced by
exposure to very low levels.
VDT operators worldwide
have complained of headaches,
visual deterioration, changes
in colour perception, skin
rashes, dulling sensation in
the fingertips, general fati-
gue and irritability, particu-
lar kinds of cataracts,
leukemia-like blood diseases,
interference with reproduc-
tion and fertility and birth
defects in the children of
female and male workers.
NIOSH's study verified work-
ers' complaints of: eye sore-
ness, redness, stinging, ir-
ritation, general discomfort

in eyes; pain in neck, back
and arms; dull headaches

sometimes above the eyes;

loss of visual acuity - see-
ing blurred or double images,
fuzzy coloured fringes; diz-
ziness, nausea; problems with
eyeglasses, contact lenses.
The NIOSH report recommends

that workers have 10 minutes
off every hour; that the
hours on and off should be
alternated and that the total
time on machines should be
limited. In Sweden the limit
is four hours a day. Unions
in Sweden and Germany have
pushed for regular breaks.

Canada's first claim for
compensation from damages
caused by VDTs was brought
by four operators who gave birth
to children with defects (all
within a 3 month period). The
operators worked at the Tor-
onto Star Newspaper. Govern-
ment officials from the Min-
istry of Labour, Occupational
Health and Safety Dept. test-
ed the VDTs and reported no
detectable levels of radia-
tion.

Two New York Times editors
developed eye cataracts and
related their conditions to
working on VDTs. They lost
their compensation suit be-
cause the radiation level
emitted by the machines they
worked on was "too low."

Darlene Weiss, employee of
the Ministry of Transporta-
tion and Communications in
Thunder Bay (Canada) opera-
ted a VDT from Aug. '78 to
March '80. Before going to
work on the machines she had
an eye examination and had
no problems. She now needs

surgery for removal of cat-
aracts. A 40-year-old woman
with no medical or family
history that would account
for cataracts, she has been
told cataracts are rare in
her age group. New York op-
thalmologist, Milton Zaret
has examined Weiss and diag-
nosed her condition as "rad-
iant energy cataracts caused
by exposure to radiation from
VDTs." Zaret has been study-
ing the ocular effects of
microwave radiation since
1959. In a telephone inter-
view reported in The Toronto
Clarion (March 13, 1981), he
said that similar damage has
occurred to New York journa-
lists (see above) and air
traffic controllers who use
VDTs or other devices such
as radar. "Some of the first
cataract victims received
compensation from New York
workers' compensation auth-
orities but succeeding cases
were denied compensation."
He also said, "My problem is
that I have seen people with
symptoms, but I cannot get
experimental data. There is
a body of information on
chronic low-level exposure
to microwave radiation that
people in the U.S. don't like
to look at, but it happens
to be accurate. In the Soviet
Union, it's a compensable
disease. The connection was
made 10 years ago, and over
100 cases have been studied
there. When a worker gets
halfway to this sickness,
they take him out of that
work."

On March 4, the New York
State Workmen's Compensation
Board ruled in a landmark
decision that chronic expo-
sure to microwave radiation
killed a telephone company
employee. Samuel Yannon work-
ed for eight years as a su-
pervisor of relay equipment
at the Empire State Bldg. He
developed symptoms of accel-
erated premature aging and
died in 1974. "40 years of
aging were kaleidoscoped into
the last 10 years of Samuel
Yannon's life," said Zaret
who gave expert testimony at
the hearing. Yannon's symp-
toms were loss of memory,
lack of coordination, cat-
aracts and problems with
hearing. "The effects of
chronic exposure to the lens
of the eye is that the lens
becomes opaque, there are
other effects to neurological

tissues: the transmission of
electrophysiological data to
various parts of the brain
and body are interfered with,
causing behavioural effects.
There are other effects re-
lated to damage to membranes.
Hopefully, tightening up of
standards will happen proper-
ly and quickly, as a result
of this case. I have suggest-
ed all along that there be
different standards for diff-
erent usages. The biggest
users are defense departments
and intelligence agencies,
air traffic controllers and
VDT operators. Then there is
the household use of micro-
wave ovens. There is a need
to protect the sick, the old,
the very young and people on
medication, all conditions
which enhance the effects of
radiation. We should have a
multi-tiered standard."

The crux of the problem is
that in North America, the
dangers of low-level non-
ionizing radiation are not
acknowledged. The Canadian
and U.S. standards for occu-
pational exposure to micro-
waves is ten milliwatts per
centimeter. In the USSR and
in other European countries
it is much lower - 1000 times
lower for the workplace and
10,000 times lower for the
general population. They are
obviously very concerned
about the hazard of leakages
that here are called "mini-
mal, negligible, harmless."
Pregnant women can't work
with microwaves in some East-
ern European countries which
is a sign of the hazard of
non-ionizing radiation as
well as the hazard of being
a female worker.

In Vancouver, the Workers
Compensation Bureau assures
workers that there is no
danger at the established
limit of exposure; in fact
the Board was planning to
eliminate compensation for
disease due to exposure to
non-ionizing radiation.
Pressure from various groups,
especially the Newspaper
Guild, forced the Board to
back down. Recently on the
U.S. east coast, some air
traffic controllers, who work
with radar were compensated
for cataracts. Paul Brodeur
(who wrote Zapping of Ameri-
ca, a book expose of micro-
waves and what he describes
as a massive coverup of the
problem), said in a recent

visit to Vancouver, British
Columbia, that the U.S. will
be changing its standard,
and that the microelectronic
industry will have enormous
lawsuits on its hands.

If governments would uni-
versally recognize the haz-
ards of VDTs and impose
health standards, workers
and business could benefit.
Standards that would demand
developing technology for
testing, changing machine de-
signs, demanding quality con-
trol and maintenance are all
necessary. Machines placed
together increase the radia-
tion danger for all workers.
Shields should be used to
protect workers, and glare-
resistant features should be
built-in features. Glare from
the screen, and also from the
surrounding lights and win-
dows and surfaces of desks
all contribute to headaches
and eye strain and stress.
The stress from bad position-
ing, incorrect height of desk
and chair, angle of the
screen, and the stress of
speedup of the workplace

falls on the worker.

Even before women began
working in the offices on
VDTs, women, mostly in South-
ern California (known as the
"Silicon Valley") have been
employed in the manufacture
of microchips. Microchips or
micro-electronic technology
is based on the silicon chip,
which is smaller than a fin-
gernail. It is possible to
put all the circuitry of a
modern computer onto one of
these chips. The chips are
called microprocessors. When
microprocessors are added to
other electronic gadgets,
which endow them with a mem-
ory function, they become
“intelligent machines" or
microcomputers. VDTs use
microchips as do electronic
toys, calculators, home com-

puters and electronic mail

systems.
The silicon chips are be-

ing manufactured by women,
who are being exposed to num-
erous, toxic, unlabeled, un-

tested substances. In South-
east Asia it is estimated

that over 300,000 women
are employed in delicate
tedious circuitry work, dam-
aging their eyes and bodies
and receiving, in some places,
as little as 10¢ per hour.

Analysis

Bobbe Ross

The builders of technology
and the buyers of technology
are one and the same - the
big boys. Technology is pro-
gress and big business.

The workforce shifts and
technology progresses - new
jobs are offered, old jobs
are phased out. For the work
er this means not only re-
learning, but discarding old
skills and learning new
skills, if they are lucky
enough to hold onto a job.
It also means new hazards to
detect and protect against -

the same game goes on, and
the big boys, patriarchal
capitalism, always survive
and profit.

Workers, primarily women
and minorities, are shifted
around in the workforce as
new technology enters the
field, because we make up
such a large part of the la-
bor force and we are the
ones most affected by the
health hazards.

It is understood that the
companies that produce the
machinery could perfect them
so there would be no health
hazards either to the workers
who make them or to the work-
ers that use them, but per-
fecting machinery means time
and money and workers are a
throw-away item. We live in a
society that long ago decided

that working class people
were dull-witted, capable of
only using their hands and
backs, and good to produce
kids that in turn were dull-
witted, capable of only using
their hands and backs and
good to produce kids. Since
there are so many of us, it
is not profitable to keep us
healthy, the supply is end-
less and the bosses never
really assume responsibility
for our bad health.

Companies that buy and use
the machinery could further
protect the workers but
again - time and money are
required. If they can crowd
ten machines into the space
where only five machines should
go, have the space lit as
cheaply as possible, leave
off safety partitions (eas-
ier for a straw boss to see
who is working) well, obvi-
ously it is saving the user
company money.

The government may be
forced by unions to regulate
the standards of machinery
and it does so reluctantly
for, as an old saying goes,
“what is good for business
is good for the country,” it
allows time and legal loop-
holes to give the company a
lot of leeway.

In the event that the pro-
ducer or user company gets
too many restrictions or the
union is too demanding,
either company can move, not
only within the U.S. border
but to foreign countries
where wages will be much low-
er, restrictions non-existent
and unions unheard of. Even
if it means some money paid
to officials of other coun-
tries (brothers under the
skin) the company will still
profit. At that time the U.S.
government will decide the
unemployed worker is getting
too much unemployment compen-
sation, AFDC and food stamps
and will punish the worker
even more with cutbacks of
necessary aid.

As feminists, we have to be
aware of the game but never
give up learning what is hap-
pening and working together
at the workplace and in our
own communities. We have to
scream out in a loud voice
our demands, not only for
ourselves but for our sisters
and brothers in other coun-
tries. Our struggle will
never be over while there
is a worker being oppressed.
