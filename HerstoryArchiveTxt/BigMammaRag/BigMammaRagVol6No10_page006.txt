This is Real

Anita Bryant failed to perform in  
Boston, Friday, September 1, when  
Democratic United States Senatorial  
candidate Howard Phillips called off  
his fundraiser starring the anti-gay  
crusader. Phillips claimed to have  
cancelled the concert due to threats  
of violence from “militant homosexuals,"  
but failed to mention low  
ticket sales. A reliable source told  
GUN that only 78 tickets were sold  
through commercial outlets.

March to  
Protest Briggs

On Thursday, August 16, 309 protest-  
ors gathered in Healdsburg, California  
to demonstrate against Proposition  
6 (The Briggs Initiative).

SCRAP 6 (Sonoma County Residents A-  
gainst Proposition 6) found out one  
day prior to the demonstration that  
Senator John Briggs, sponsor of the  
anti-gay, anti-union legislation,  
planned to kick off his campaign in  
Healdsburg.

Briggs was invited to kick off his  
campaign by the town Board of Educa-  
tion which had recently attempted to  
fire a 4th grade teacher, Larry Ber-  
ner, who had written a letter to the  
Board stating his opposition to Prop-  
osition 6. The Board of Education,  
composed of four men and one woman  
(who has since resigned) decided to  
fire Larry Berner for his stand on  
Proposition 6.

The Board was unsuccessful in its  
attempt because Berner had neither  
misconducted himself in the classroom  
nor had any record of arrest for  
"public immorality." The media pick-  
ed up on the action and it became  
widely known that Berner is gay. Fif-  
teen parents immediately withdrew  
their children from the school.

Using this as an excuse, the school  
superintendent asked Berner to resign  
because "he had caused the parents to  
withdraw their children which threat-  
ened the school's funding." The vast  
majority of parents mobilized to sup-  
port Berner by threatening to with-  
draw their children from the school  
if the superintendent didn't stop  
action. The case is now pending in  
the courts.

We Will Know You

A list of men charged with or con-  
victed of rape and related offenses  
was published in the September issue  
of the New Women's Times of Rochester,  
New York. The list, compiled by  
Rochester Women Against Violence  
Against Women, included names of the  
men, addresses, and circumstances  
surrounding their brutal attacks on  
women and girls. The men listed were  
mostly from Rochester, but there were  
also New York state and national  
incidents. The information was com-  
piled from clippings taken from the  
Times-Union, a Rochester paper, and  
from the New York Times.

Rape Victims  
to be Identified

An editorial by the publisher and  
editor of the Northern Virginia Sun,  
Herman J. Obermayer, announced that  
the paper will begin to publish the  
names, ages and addresses of women  
who are rape victims.

According to Obermayer, the reason  
for taking this action was to dis-  
courage women from seeking revenge upon  
a man by taking his freedom away for  
life. Obermayer reasoned that with  
the risk of public exposure fewer  
women would feel sufficiently anony-  
mous to satisfy their vindictive  
urge.

Local feminists, readers of the  
paper, police, hospital officials and  
fellow news persons have denounced  
the move.

Obermayer did concede that in a few  
cases he will refrain from exposing  
the victims. If she is under 21 or  
if exposure would endanger her other-  
wise, Obermayer indicated no amount  
of public pressure or contention will  
force him to alter his new position.

The Facts of Life

Among the findings reported in The  
Spirit of Houston:

The number of working women has  
more than doubled in the last 25  
years. By September 1977, they ac-  
counted for 41% of the labor force,  
but they earned, on the average,  
only 60% of what men earned.

Only 6% of American families fit  
the concept of the "average" family  
consisting of a breadwinning father,  
a homemaking mother, and two school-  
age children.

Alimony is awarded in only 14% of  
all divorces and no more than 7% of  
divorced men actually make such pay-  
ments.

More than six million children of  
preschool age have working mothers,  
but only about 2% of them are in  
day care centers.

Women are the poorest of the elder-  
ly. In 1976, women over 65 had the  
lowest median income of any age or  
sex group -- $2,300 a year -- about  
half the income of men their age.

A majority of new health insurance  
plans do not cover maternity services.

Some state laws permit indeterminate  
sentences for women, and this  
leads to longer jail sentences for  
women than for men convicted of the  
same crime.

Rape is the fastest growing crime  
in the United States, occurring at  
the rate of one every nine minutes.

Women are 64% of all elementary  
and secondary school teachers, but  
only 2% of high school principals  
and 18% of primary school principals.

The nation's 15 million minority  
women have lower life expectancy  
and higher maternal mortality rates  
than white women.

Since the founding of the United  
States, there have been 1,727 U.S.  
Senators, of whom only 12 have been  
women. Of a total, 959 members of  
the House, only 87 have been women.

Abortion News

In Bowling Green, Kentucky, women  
won a victory for abortion rights on  
August 30 when a jury found Maria  
Pitchford not guilty of charges that  
she aborted herself with a knitting  
needle.

Pitchford, a twenty-two-year-old  
college student, had been unable to  
obtain an abortion at a clinic any-  
where in Kentucky.

Immediately after she had a miscarr-  
iage, Pitchford had been taken to the  
Bowling Green Warren County Hospital.  
There a Dr. Slazack, an anti-abortion-  
ist, treated her and then called pol-  
ice.

A grand jury indicted Pitchford for  
first-degree manslaughter and for per-  
forming an abortion without a license.

The manslaughter charge was dismis-  
sed on the grounds that a fetus is  
not legally a person.

The illegal abortion charge was  
based on a relatively new Kentucky  
law that prohibits anyone but a lic-  
ensed physician from performing an  
abortion. Pitchford, the first per-  
son to be prosecuted under this law,  
faced ten to twenty years in prison  
if convicted.

During the trial Pitchford's former  
companion Dwight Mundy testified  
against her. Mundy turned state's  
evidence under threat of being indic-  
ted also.

Pitchford won support from around  
the country. Some women came from as  
far away as Atlanta to observe the  
trial. On the last day, the court-  
room was crowded with local and  
national news reporters and women's  
rights activists, about 150 people  
altogether.

The Militant

Despite its continuing controversy,  
abortion remains the most widely  
used method of birth control around  
the world.

The Atlas World Press Review re-  
ports that annually the global total  
of women who abort is 45 million --  
a figure which is equal to the popu-  
lation of Turkey, the Philippines, or  
Thailand.

The magazine adds, however, that  
despite this, 150,000 women die each  
year from illegal abortions.

A brief abortion overview by the  
magazine shows that sixty percent of  
the world population now lives in  
countries with liberal abortion laws.  
Among those are China, The U.S., Japan  
and most European countries,  
according to the magazine. The re-  
maining 40 percent lives in third  
world countries where abortions are  
strictly forbidden or allowed only  
in cases of rape or incest.

In Belgium, The Philippines, Colom-  
bia, Ireland, Haiti, Panama, Liberia  
and Zaire, abortions are illegal.  
In the Netherlands and Taiwan, abort-  
ion is only allowed explicitly to  
save a woman's life.

The magazine says that all Eastern  
Bloc European countries except  
Albania have liberal abortion laws,  
and in England, France, Italy and  
West Germany, abortion is currently  
legal.

Her Say

A temporary delay in the August 15  
cutoff of state funding for abortions  
in California was won when the Wom-  
en's Litigation Unit and five other  
public interest law firms filed a  
lawsuit against the state Depart-  
ment of Health Services, charging  
violation of constitutional rights to  
privacy and equal protection under  
the law. A hearing is scheduled  
August 30.

Injunctions against similar state  
funding restrictions for abortions  
on the grounds that states are re-  
quired to provide medically necessary  
services for poor women by the  
federal Social Security Act, have  
been granted in Illinois, New Jersey  
and West Virginia.

Lesbian Mother Loses

On February 23 the Oakland County  
Circuit Court in Ann Arbor, Michigan  
deprived Margareth Miller of custody  
of her 12-year-old daughter Jillian.  
Judge Frederick Ziem had denied  
Miller the custody of her child last  
June, but the Michigan Court of  
Appeals sent her case back to him  
for reconsideration. Miller's ex-  
husband, who already has custody of  
their 14-year-old son, had dragged  
her into court to gain custody of  
Jillian, whom she alone had supported  
for five years, on the grounds  
that her lifestyle did not provide  
stability in the home. What the  
self-righteous guardians of bourgeois  
propriety actually find so object-  
ionable is that Margareth Miller is  
a lesbian.

The charge that Miller is an unfit  
mother was forcefully contested in  
court: by her child, who has stated  
that she would prefer to live with  
her mother; by her child's teacher;  
by a court-appointed psychologist  
and by two "Friends of the Court"  
witnesses, one of whom testified:  

“Here's a single parent doing a  
phenomenal job with her daughter."  

Ziem has admitted that his original  
ruling last June was based on  
the issue of lesbianism. At that  
time he cited a press account de-  
scribing Jimmy Carter's disapproval  
of homosexuality and raved about the  
“threat of a lesbian environment" to  
the well-being of the child. But  
this proved too embarrassing for the  
Michigan Court of Appeals, which  
sent the case back to Ziem to enable  
him to strengthen the legal pre-  
texts of his decision.

Margareth Miller is once again  
seeking to appeal her case, and
