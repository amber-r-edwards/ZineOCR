Out of the Closet Into

Feminists Spurred
Into New Corral

Carol Lease

In late April the first women’s
conference, “Feminism in the
Cowboy State,” was held in
Casper, Wyoming. Women from
South Dakota, Wyoming,
Colorado, Utah, Montana and
other area states attended the
three-day symposium that
featured regional women artists,
nationally known feminist
speakers such as Margaret
Sloan, Flo Kennedy, Sissy
Farenthold, and Karen DeCrow. Big
Mama Rag staff attended the
conference in order to set up
sorely needed contacts in the
Northwest, hear what other
women are doing, and see the
trend the women’s movement is
taking nationally.

In a workshop on minority
women in the women's move-
ment it became obvious that the
word ‘feminist’ has been
diluted and distorted to describe
anyone who believes in “equal
pay for equal work.” According
to Margaret Sloan there is no
distinction made between
women's liberationists and
feminists and “there ought to

be.” Women in the movement
have differing degrees of con-
sciousness and there should be
distinctions made for those
degrees. We shouldn't lump the
whole movement together.

Feminism and Racism

In answering a question about
racism in the women’s move-
ment, Sloan said that “there can
be no feminism if there is
racism. The ‘women’s liberation
movement people’ are those
who haven't dealt with their own

racism and give the feminists a
bad name; feminists, by defini-
tion, cannot be racist.”

Sloan talked about women of
all colors working together to
“get through their differences
because we have a vested
interest in the female culture.” 
She said that the National Black
Feminist Organization (NBFO)
coalesces with white women on
issues of rape, child care, the
ERA but is an organization of
African women. “Black women
have to deal with their own
racism as well as white
women,” she added. “Women of
color tend to distrust each other.
They believe what the oppressor
has been telling them.” This
July, Sloan, Gloria Steinem and
Lily Tomlin, among others, are
giving a benefit in Detroit for the
Joan Little Defense Fund. “It is
important for women to support
her and not let leftist groups use
Little as a political bandwagon,”
she stated.

Another idea that came from
the workshop was Speak-Outs
on Rape which only women can
attend and give testimony about
rape. The “amazing testimony”
that is given has included date-
rape, incest, gang rape and
marriage rape. These groups
provide tremendous support for
rape victims and help women of

all colors see their common
problems.
At the media workshop

women who worked in media
projects talked about their com-
mon problems. Women generally
recognized the distortion that
media makes of feminism but
felt powerless to affect change
except in a personal, alternative
way.
Media Message

Linda Dover of Laramie,
Wyoming talked about her radio
show A Woman's Place and the
problems she is having with
funding it. Alternative
newspapers and journals and
radio shows were discussed as
means of taking control of some
aspect of media. Flo Kennedy
suggests that women learn all
the rules of challenging stations
and dragging them to the FCC to
make them more accountable to
women. She was upset that
women’s publications hadn't
used their “power of the word”
to antagonize and boycott adver-
tisers that wouldn’t support
women.

Films and Flams

A series of feminist and
women’s films were shown to
participants at the conference,
some good, some bad and an
incredibly anti-woman series of
skits was performed by some
area women. The art show was
good. Many Denver-area artists
showed their work. There was
ample time and opportunity to
talk with the speakers Kennedy
and Sloan. But Farenthold and
DeCrow apparently only had
enough time to speak, pick up
their checks and fly out. Meeting
other feminists from the “upper
states” has hopefully set up
lines of communication and
support that we all need.

Flo Kennedy: Don’t Bite
The Chocolate

Carol Lease

Florence Kennedy doesn't
care who agrees or disagrees
with her, whether her audience
likes her or what she has to say.
She is steady in her opinions, is
honest and has guts. She is a
lawyer, an author, a tireless
campaigner, a civil rights ac-
tivist, a founder of the National
Black Feminist Organization.
Her emphasis in her speeches at
the Wyoming conference on
Feminism in late April (see story
in this issue) was on en-
couraging women to break into
electoral politics and changing
the process of decision-making
from within while maintaining a
position outside the system from
which to throw rocks.

She maintains that women
have the right to be pissed off
and still be inside. The people in
the suites are the “good people”
who, Kennedy says, want to love
and be loved but suffer from the
“wise-monkey” syndrome
which doesn’t let them hear, see
or talk about injustice unless
that injustice is directed against
the establishment or their own
end of town. She says that good
people don't want trouble and, of
course, injustice doesn’t trouble
people who aren't affected by it.

Liberal Ethics

This “liberalism” tends to
affect those “bad people” who
have been in the streets all their
lives, not in control of any
institutions that affect them,
when they are finally let into the
suites and given the CON (Con-
trol of Nigger) job. The important
thing, Kennedy maintains, is to
be in both places at the same
time by staying in the streets

Flo Kennedy

after we've been admitted to the
suites. And remember that the
people who say that they never
kicked a nigger (read: Indian,
Mexican) are usually the same
liberals who deplore the op-
pressed their right to violence,
but think the government's right
to bomb the DMZ in Vietnam out
of existence is O.K.

Kennedy warned the group
not to let the media define our
reality for us. She said that
certain words like “bloodbath”
shouldn't be allowed to be
connected with the Vietnamese
war. “They never talk about the
bloodflood that has been going
on over there for years, and now

they try to tell us about a
bloodbath that hasn't happened
and will never happen. The
public should put such pressure
on the media that they will not
dare to insult us by associating
the word humanitarianism with
the kidnapping and rip-off of kids
to change the focus of the
murder and carnage and 25
million craters in Vietnam,”
Kennedy maintains.
Chocolate-covered Shit
The 59-year-old activist warned
her audience not to accept the
chocolate-covered shit that the
media tries to pass off as candy.
“They chocolate cover the shit

and shit cover the chocolate.”

Margaret Sloan:
We Can Turn This
Country Around

Susan Hayes

“It would be nice if the con-
stitution applied to women,”
stated Margaret Sloan, one of
the founders of the National
Black Feminist Organization.

Ms. Sloan was in Casper,
Wyoming April 24, 25, 26,
participating in the first feminist
symposium ever to be held in
that state. She told the large
crowd filling the auditorium of
Casper College that in order for
the ERA to pass, we must use
our power as consumers. “Break
up the economy of the states
which do not pass it,” she said.
When one woman told of
Florida’s recent refusal to ratify
the amendment, Margaret used
it as an example of the potential
power of women united. “Stop
buying Florida orange juice,”
she said, “and write the com-
panies, telling them why you're
not buying it. Then watch what
happens.”

Withdraw Consent

Margaret also said women
must make corporations res-
pond to them. “Why put money
into them if they use racist and
sexist advertising?” she asked.
“We must withdraw our consent
to oppression, and that means
giving up a lot.”

The well-known black
feminist had a few words for the
sprinkling of males present.
“We don't need white liberal
men in our movement,” she
stated, to the tune of thunderous
applause. “Males should deal
with their own kind, the truck-
drivers and the cowboys. Then
we'll call you brother.” As an

And then they tell you not to bite
into it. Stay away from what the
establishment sells for women
to be involved in. Stay away from
the traditional woman's
professions. Stay away from
marriage until you're sure that if
el-cheapo, el-creepo leaves you
you're prepared to rear the little
one alone.”
Politics of the Ass

Kennedy is critical of the
“revolutionary” who sits on
his/her ass with nothing

between them and the ground
but a pair of blue jeans. She
maintains that these are the
people who say that electoral
politics makes no difference and

example, she told of an organiza-
tion in Chicago called M.A.C. —
Men Against Cool, who picketed
the Playboy club there with signs
reading, “We Have Small
Penises, So What!”

A portion of her message was
directed at long-time feminists.
She spoke of C-R groups as
psychic turfs where we offer
each other support and encour-
agement. She said that we have
been conditioned since birth,
and feminism is a day-by-day
process. Many heads nodded in
agreement when Margaret told
us, “We are all damaged
women.” “As we move on we
must take into account the hills
and valleys others have come
through.”

Bi-centennial B.S.

Concerning the upcoming
centennial, she said it just
doesn’t apply to women. “It is a
celebration of white man’s in-
dependence from England.”
“No,” she added, “I never could
understand why black folks
would be barbecuing every
fourth of July.” She noted that
we could have our own celebra-
tion, when we get our in-
dependence.

Margaret Sloan gave the
women who attended the sym-
posium ideas for actions using
the power they hold as con-
sumers, aching sides from
laughter, and a spark of inspira-
tion to carry with them through
the cowboy states. “We can turn
this country around,” she said.
There were many at the con-
ference who thought she just
might be right.

are the same ones who aren't
going to be at the barricades and
will love themselves into a sense
of security and superiority over
those that are doing something.

They not only criticize
everything that is done, they
don’t do anything themselves.
They are not disruptive and do
not use consumer power. They
do not demand clarity from the
media. They intellectually
masturbate with themselves
and others who agree with
them.

women to get involved with
