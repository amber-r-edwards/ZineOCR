Feminist Therapists Convene and Conflict

Terra, K. Sharp, V. Piotter, P. Hickox, E. Bresnahan

On the weekend of January
23-25, 350 women from across
the country met in Boulder,
Colorado for a feminist
therapists’ conference. The con-
ference was organized by the
Women's Institute of Alterna-
tive Psychotherapy (WIAP) in
Boulder, and jointly sponsored
by WIAP and the University of
Colorado Women’s Studies Pro-
gram. Most of the women at-
tending ranged in age from 20 to
50 years. Most were white,
except for two black women and
no more than five Chicanas. As
early as registration an aura of
professionalism pervaded the
conference, as revealed through
women’s conversations about
their work and expectations of
the conference.

Pillows vs. Politics

The first planned event of the
weekend was a speech by
Miriam Greenspan, entitled,
“Psychotherapy and Women’s
Liberation.” In her speech, (ex-
cerpted in the centerfold), Green-
span distinguished between
traditional, liberal feminist, and
revolutionary feminist therapy.
In simplified form, if an office
worker has a run-in with her
boss, the traditional therapist
would tell her that her father
didn't pay enough attention to
her; the liberal would tell her to
express her anger at her boss by
hitting a pillow, while the re-
volutionary therapist would help
her to organize a strike against
her boss. In other words, the re-
volutionary therapist sees the
problems of the woman who
came to her in a political and
economic, as well as a personal
context. Greenspan urged
women who counsel to suggest
political activity relating to their
counselees’ specific difficulties
as a concrete way for women to
deal with their immediate pro-
blems, to begin taking control of
their lives, and to begin chang-
ing the society in which they live.

Greenspan urged the break-
down of the professional/client
hierarchy and questioned pro-
fessionalism, including the
“legitimization” of feminist
therapists by admittance into the
American Psychiatric Associa-
tion or the American Psycholo-
gical Association, as perpetuat-
ing the status quo on all levels.
Miriam Greenspan's speech
was the first, as well as the only
speech at the conference to have
a feminist, political analysis.

Audience response to Green-
span was mixed. A number of
women wanted to ask her ques-
tions, but Ann Schaef, project
director of WIAP, effectively cur-
tailed discussion. She whistled
loudly to gain order and dis-
courage interaction. She also in-
sisted the schedule be adhered
to and that the multi-media pres-
entation, entitled, ‘Woman Is’,
(scheduled as the next part of the
program), be shown immediate-
ly.

You Can Make It If You Try

“Woman Is” was in sharp con-
trast to the theories and values
expressed by Miriam Green-
span. The lesson of the film
seemed to be that a woman can
make it in any field if she wants
to badly enough. No examina-
tion was set forth of the pos-
sible economic or psychological
traumas and frustrations
brought on by a society that will
not allow her to succeed or break
out of traditional roles. Career
and “fulfilling relationships”
were seen as the solution to a
woman's psychological hard
times. There was no represen-
tation of the woman too poor to
afford education or training; the
woman lacking social and self-
esteem skills acquired in the
middle class family; the woman
with too many children and too
little money; or the woman artist
without the luxury of being sup-
ported while she works in her
medium. The lack of Third World
women was so glaring that the
filmmakers felt compelled to
superimpose black faces over
footage of white ballet dancers.
Unfortunately, one of the most
notable aspects of the film, the
cinematography and photography,
were done primarily by male
technicians.

Despite its many political
shortcomings, ‘“Woman Is” was
met with a great deal of positive
response. Some women gave it a
standing ovation, having felt
their values reaffirmed.

Political Conflicts Surface

The issues of class and pro-
fessionalism did not go away
with a good night's sleep. As
conference participants filed in
Saturday morning, they were
handed the following statement
drawn up by the Boulder
Women's Health Group:

To the Women at this confer-
ence:

The Boulder Women’s Health
Group turned in a proposal to
run a workshop on “How Body
Images Influence Behavior.”
Another woman also turned in a
proposal on ‘Women and Ad-
diction.’ Both of these propo-
sals were accepted by WIAP for
workshops. However, these two
workshops will not be presented
at the conference due to the fact
that WIAP is requiring that all
women — those presenting
workshops and those partici-
pating in the conference — must
pay the total fee of $40.

We Object Strongly To Charg-
ing A Fee To People Who Spend
Extra Time And Energy To Pre-
sent A Workshop (A call to the
University of Colorado Bureau of
Conferences and Institutes in-
formed us that of all the confer-
ences run by that organization
only one has ever charged a fee
to persons who present
workshops.)

We Object Strongly To Allow-
ing Women Reduced Fees Only
If They Are Willing To Perform A
Traditional Female Role Of Car-
ing For Children. Through this
women receive financial
recognition for taking a shift of
child care but not for presenting
something which uses their pro-
fessional expertise. Also in pro-
viding child care the women who
receive reduced rates also are
forced to miss part of the con-
ference.

We Object Strongly To the Ex-
clusion Of Women Who Work In
Related Fields As Paraprofes-
sionals, Volunteers, Or Low-
Paid Professionals. Although the
brochure announced that this
conference would be an inter-
disciplinary conference for
feminist therapists and educa-
tors, in actuality WIAP believed
that only well-paid profession-
als should attend. These two
quotes from the recent WIAP
newsletter address this issue:

WIAP decided not to reduce
registration because of the
need for keeping to the point
of the conference through
attendance only of those
interested in our specific
topic. This isn’t a women’s
conference; it's a confer-
ence specifically for prac-
ticing feminist therapists
and some future students of
feminist therapy to discuss
the development of this
field, not women’s issues in
general.

Although WIAP is commit-
ted to soliciting input from
future students, future
clients and community
women this goal is not the
goal of the conference and
would therefore be best met
in other ways than by re-
cruiting these persons for
the conference through free
registration.

These statements certainly in-
dicate a belief that there should
be a hierarchy among women
counseling women. It implies
that anyone who would need a
reduced or free registration
could not possibly be counsel-
ing women or understand the
subject matter of the confer-
ence. This seems to be parallel to
the male medical profession
“owning” medical knowledge
and treatment, (part of the white
male system that WIAP speaks
against.)

In fact a lot of woman to
woman psychology is and has
been developed and practiced by
paraprofessionals. These very
people are being excluded from
sharing their experiences and
learning more about therapy at
this conference. The prevailing
attitude of WIAP and the firm
$40 fee is keeping many local
women away who could benefit
from attending. This includes
women working as paraprofes-
sional phone and walk-in coun-
selors at the local women’s
centers and women’s lines,
abortion counselors, birth control
counselors, and women working
in other health or mental health
fields.

Professional feminist
therapists need to recognize,
share with, and learn from these
women.

The Boulder Women’s Health
Group further invited con-
ference women to attend a
meeting at noon to discuss the
issues raised in the leaflet.

Back to the Agenda

The first scheduled event of
Saturday was a speech by Ann
Schaef, WIAP project director,
entitled, “A Conceptual and
Theoretical Framework for
Feminist Therapy.”

Schaef opened her speech
with an observation that in her
clinical work she had seen that
women dislike and distrust each
other, compete for male valida-
tion and power, and take out
rage on each other, rather than
on the male system. Taught that
women have the “original sin”
of being female, Schaef said that
we've tried to deal with our
“innate” inferiority by overcom-
pensation (becoming super com-
petent, super sexy, or super
tough). Such feelings of in-
feriority, she said, lead to a basic
distrust of our own perceptions.
When there is a conflict be-
tween how we see things and
how the White Male System
says things are, we end up being
labeled crazy, stupid, or bad.

Schaef outlined character-
istics of the White Male System
as dualistic thinking, a sexual
world view, and putting work,
accountability, and self as the
center of experience. She sug-
gested that women have an al-
ternate system, the Female
System (FS), although she did not
examine the Female System any
further than that it exists. Schaef
continued that the White Male
System denies the existence of
other systems since they would
invalidate its major premise; that
it is innately superior. Schaef
closed by encouraging women to
acknowledge and know the
Female System as well as the
White Male System. Audience
reception to her speech was
warm.

Directly following Schaef,
conference women took part in
an “action sociogram” in which
they were directed, in a large
room, to group according to
questions about their educa-
tional background, their income
bracket, their sexuality, their
geographic location, and their
approach to therapy (traditional,
liberal, or radical).

What could have given an ac-
curate account as to the compo-
sition of the conference turned
out to be more of an exercise on
how women view themselves.

After the sociogram, con-
ference participants adjourned
to elective workshops. Work-
shops were diverse and includ-
ed: “Radical Psychiatry for
Women”, “Legal Aspects of
Middle Aged Divorce Counsel-
ing”, “Sexuality”, “Adolescent
Girls and Feminism”, “Working
With Non-Feminist Women”,
etc. (Reports on workshops BMR
staffers attended can be found
on page 10.)

Some tension and conflicts
surrounding the political issues
raised earlier that morning were
beginning to surface at this time,
but on the whole, workshops
went smoothly.

Political Conflicts Analyzed

The Boulder Women's Health
Group meeting at noon lunch
break drew about 30 women
who discussed grievances about
the way WIAP organized and ran
the conference. They also dis-
cussed the “lack of regard for
women’s services and talents”
at the conference.

For example, one woman had
asked WIAP if she could trade
video-taping work for the $40
fee and was told that “someone’s husband was doing the
videotaping.” (BMR later learn-
ed he was paid $5 an hour
through the three-day con-
ference.)

The women further discus-
sed the matter of conference
fees and credentials which had
been raised in the leaflet dis-
tributed earlier. It was decided to
hold a four o'clock meeting to
draft a statement supporting the
Boulder Women’s demands, and
to ask the evening speaker,
Hogie Wycoff, to yield some time
for its presentation and discus-

| Ann Schaef addressing conference opening session

For example, on the question
of economics, most of the
women grouped in the middle
income range; however, the
definition of what constituted
high, middle, and low income
was left up to the individual
woman with no guidelines for
comparison. The same happened
when they were asked about
approach to therapy; no
definitions were set forth. Two
thirds of the women placed
themselves in the liberal
category, two in the traditional
category, and those remaining
called themselves radical thera-
pists.

It was assumed (correctly) that
most women had a college edu-
cation. On the question of back-
ground education and experi-
ence, people were asked to
group according to subject area
of study. It was revealed that
most women had formal train-
ing in the areas of psychology
and the social sciences.

The sociogram closed with the
question regarding sexuality.
One half of the women classi-
fied themselves as heterosexual, 
one third as bisexual, and the
remaining sixth as lesbian.

After lunch break, women
again adjourned for workshops.
By this time tension surround-
ing the possibility of political
confrontation was beginning to
show. Many of the workshops
diverted from their stated sub-
ject to talk about the conflicts
that were arising. Afternoon
workshop reports can be found
on page 12.

About 10 women met for the
four o'clock meeting to draft the
statement to be presented at the
evening session. The major
argument was the inflexibility of
cost to attend the conference
and the exploitation of work-
shop facilitators and speakers by
making money off their work
without telling them how it was
to be used. It was stated, “The
feminist community can’t accept
exploitation in the name of
feminism.”

Women present felt that if the
small WIAP staff had made an
effort to tap a wide range of input
in the planning of the con-
ference, many of the objections
would not have been raised.
