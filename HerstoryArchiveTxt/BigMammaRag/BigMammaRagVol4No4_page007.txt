Wages for Housework

Women’s Role is Work Says WFH

Linda Fowler

“The women of the world are
serving notice. We clean your
homes and factories. We raise
the next generation of workers
for you. We serve our men so
that they are able to work for
you. Whatever else we do, we
are the housewives of the world.
In return for our work, you have
only asked us to work harder.

“We are serving notice to you
that we intend to be paid for the
work we do. We want wages for
every dirty toilet, every painful
childbirth, every indecent
assault, and every smile. And if
we don't get what we want we
will simply refuse to work any
longer.”

This statement, from “A Letter
To All Governments” (Wages for
Housework, Amazon Press,
Toronto, Canada) expresses the
basic tenet of the Wages For
Housework (WFH) movement,
the recognition of women's role
as work. It seeks to point out that
this work is pervasive in all as-
pects of what women are ex-
pected to do and that it is time
that women were paid for their
work, just as any laborer. It is a
sweeping socio/political analy-
sis which could serve to rede-
fine the working class struggle
and socialism, could integrate
the feminist movement and les-
bianism with the left, or could be
the most reactionary element
yet to come out of a changing
woman's consciousness.

The Overall Perspective

The WFH movement began in
Italy in 1972 when an inter-
national gathering of women,
later named the International
Feminist Collective, sought to
define women’s oppression
through an economic analysis. It
has since grown to include
groups throughout the United
States, Europe and Canada.

The WFH perspective starts
from the premise that money is
power and that the housewife,
while producing the commodity
of labor power which, in turn,
produces profits for industry and
the state, has neither power nor
money. But the housewife is
only the extreme example of the
free labor used by capital to
maintain its system. All women,
the movement says, do house-
work, be they married or single,
heterosexual or lesbian, upper,
middle or lower class. The wage
for this labor is sought for all
women in return for the work we
do as women, the woman’s role.

That role, it is pointed out, is
basically one of service and
maintenance, both in our homes
and in the workplace. We main-
tain a family and a husband to
send them off to the labor
market, or we do the same for
ourselves and, once in the work-
place, we do it for others. We run
the errands, make coffee, smile,
soothe the ego, provide sex, all
part of the woman's role, all part
of our work.

Housework has never been
recognized as work because it is
not paid labor. In the social unit
of the family, the husband's pay
check is valued over the home
labor of the wife even though
she will average 99 hrs. per
week working in the home if she
is not employed outside (accord-
ing to a Chase Manhattan Bank
study). How many women who
cook, clean, wash clothes,
budget, shop and provide sex
when asked if they work will
respond, “No, I'm a house-
wife”? If she is employed at a
second job outside the home she
will still average 40 hrs. per week
in home labor and will earn less
at her paying job than her hus-
band will at his (Sex in the
Marketplace: American Women
at Work, Juanita Kreps).

The lack of value attached to
home, or unpaid, labor holds
true, too, on a national level. The
United States government does
not include housework in the
GNP because it is not waged
labor. Yet the amount of work
done in the home by women,
when valued at market cost, is
equal to 1/3 the GNP. The average
yearly value of unpaid output for
the American family in 1964
(latest available data) was $3,929,
or 50% of disposable in-
come. 90% of this was in the
form of housework. Moreover, if
a woman takes a job keeping
house for someone else this
work is included in the GNP be-
cause it is waged work. The WFH
movement contends that if
women were paid for house-
work this amount would then
figure into the GNP and would
reflect more accurately the
economic situation of the coun-
try.

The lack of wages for house-
work maintains the economic
dependence of women on men
and distorts love into a power
relationship, at least in the
heterosexual situation. With the
wage for housework, paid by the
government, women would gain
not only immediate economic
independence but would also
gain some security in the future,
being eligible for social security
benefits, disability programs and
other government benefits.

Picking Up The Pieces

Through a new definition of
work, wages for housework may
be able to carry on where the left
has failed, uniting feminism,
complete with the lesbian
quarter, with the workers move-
ment. The Modern Times Collec-
tive, an independent leftist
group, points out that the con-
cept of work and workers which
has formed the basis of left
politics since its inception was
originally outlined by capitalist
interest itself. Capital has defin-
ed workers as those who are
waged and everyone else as the
problems, or drains on society.
The left has never challenged
this definition of work; it has said
only that workers are exploited
and the rest of us are oppressed.
This leaves intact the “given” in
capitalism: work-paycheck. In
organizing only paid workers,
the left automatically excludes
the unemployed, the elderly on
social security and welfare
recipients. In its attempt to
organize workers (as defined
above) against capital the left
has, therefore, built in its own
defeat.

WFH insists that all women
are workers, whatever their
class and employment situation,
by virtue of providing extended
housekeeping for all men, and
that this is true whether we
receive a salary or not. If we
consider that wives and mothers
alone (not counting single
women) produce 42% of all work
done in the U.S., waged or
unwaged, and that all men to-
gether produce only 39% of the
total work we begin to see why a
movement whose membership
requirement is the dollar sign is
doomed to failure. According to
the Modern Times Collective, “to
locate the vanguard of the
working class in the already
more powerful or more easily
organized sectors of the class is
to base one’s strategy on the
divisions within the class, rather
than on their destruction.” Re-
defining work as the WFH move-
ment does, without the neces-
sity of a wage paid, would give a
new base to worker organiza-
tion and to the socialist move-
ment.

As further support of WFH as a
direct attack on the State, Silvia
Federici pointed out in a speech,
given in New York City in 1975,
that women’s work of family
maintenance, reproduction and
proper socialization serves direct-
ly the interest of the state by
providing the commodity of labor
power. When women cease to
serve this function the state
comes in and fills some of these
roles, such as providing drug
therapy in the schools to calm
down and socialize “hyper-
active” children or providing
“family therapy.” If the state
benefits, she maintains, the
state should pay. If money is the
measure of power under
capitalism, then, it is pointed
out, wagelessness is both the
cause and the measure of the
powerlessness of women.

But the point is not to take a
second job outside the home and
to earn money in that manner.
Susie Fleming, of the Power of
Women Collective in Bristol,
England, has noted, “... to
propose that women take on
more work is simply not a
strategy of any kind of liberation.
Work has never been a libera-
tion.”

If any question remains that
women’s work serves the state,
the current concern over
lesbianism should resolve it. The
state, Federici notes, is not, by its
nature, against homosexuality;
male homosexuality has usually
been tolerated. But lesbianism is
a direct threat to the stability of
the family and a refusal to re-
produce the commodity of labor
and to raise the kids in a properly
socialized manner.

The recognition of this link
between lesbian and hetero-
sexual women and the recogni-
tion that all women do extended
housework has led to the
integration of lesbians into the
WFH movement. In Toronto,
Canada, within the Wages for
Housework Committee there
exists the Wages Due Collective
which is composed of lesbians.
Until the WFH movement, these
women point out, “... we did
not have a perspective which
would show us clearly the
internal connection between our
struggles and those of every
other woman...”

This recognition is not without
its class consciousness. “It is the
existence of lesbianism that
makes fucking visible as labor.
Also, a woman who refuses to
fuck is refusing part of her work
as a woman, and is therefore
waging a fight against the state
whether she recognizes it or not.
Lesbianism... is a form of
social relationship between peo-
ple of equal power. It
strengthens the power of the
class by being a gut expression
of class solidarity.”

That the concept of house-
work as labor deserving of a
wage is one readily understood
by most women is evidenced in
the rapid growth of the WFH
movement. The tenets of the
movement are becoming an
issue in labor questions. In Eng-
land in the summer of 1974,
when nurses threatened to go on
strike, one of their demands
was that they be paid lunch
hours during which they do their
grocery shopping. This was seen
as recognition, in the form of
money, of the unpaid job of
housework, or of a part of it. In
addition, they refused to be
guilted out of the strike by the
question of what would become
of the patients, pointing out that
concern for humankind does
not pay the rent and thus helping
to destroy the myth that women
play their role out of love or be-
cause it is their nature.

Why Is WFH Becoming Accep-

table?

While no country yet pays a
wage for housework, there is a
trend in that direction. Canada
pays a monthly allowance for
each child a woman has. In the
U.S., Aid to Families with
Dependent Children is a form of
salary for child care, but it is only
available under certain con-
ditions, among them that there
is no male head of the family. In
addition, it is seen as a handout,
not as a payment for work.
Governments are leaning
toward establishing a wage for
housework. This is not, how-
ever, because the state sees it as
a deserved wage but because it
is seen as a means to maintain
the status quo. Governments are
concerned over the so-called
crisis in the family (read non-
socialization of the next genera-
tion). One study done for the
Department of Health, Educa-
tion, & Welfare credited a large
part of “women’s current dis-
content” with housework to the
fact that we are expected to do it
in addition to a full-time job. It
stated, also, that women may
strive to increase their money
which may not increase the wel-
fare of the family. It recom-
mended that a wage for this
work might solve this crisis.
Sylvia Glber, of the Canadian
Dept. of Labor, stated, concern-
ing the wage for housework,
“Belittling of the role of house-
wife ... has been responsible,
in no small part, for many of the
dissatisfactions being ex-
perienced at the present time,
particularly by some younger
women...” It is governmental
attitudes such as these which
moved feminist Elizabeth Reid,
former Special Advisor on
Women’s Affairs to the Prime
Minister of Australia, to state,
concerning wages for house-
work (Ms. Magazine, Jan.,
1976), “I think it would be one of
the most backward steps that
has happened to the women’s
movement for some time. All
that does is reinforce the ex-
isting sex roles in society. It
doesn't question them at all.
Wages for mothers, wages for
housework, is a right-wing de-
mand. Every fascist and reac-
tionary political party in history
has asked for it. It is one of the
most effective means of keeping
women where the fascists think
we ought to be — in the house.

But WFH maintains that they
do not see women as spending
all their time doing housework;
that a wage will mean we can
refuse to do the work, at first not
doing it full time and eventually
not doing it at all. If we get a
wage from the state for our
work, we don't have to play the
role for a husband.

But the entire female role,
whether played for the state or
for a husband, is work. Getting
paid by the state, it would seem,
is merely a restyling of the
economic system, only a change
in where the money comes from.

While it might make it clear that
we work for the state, it might
also lock us into this dependency
as a new form of indenture, re-
placing the family. Furthermore,
unless men are eligible for
wages for housework, too, all
that has really been done is to
institutionalize women’s “work”
forever. Once we are paid for the
role, it will be expected of us; we
may, ourselves, see it as
justified. Or we may feel we
have won ultimate victory, as
our foremothers did with the
winning of the vote.

Yet the alternative to the wage
for housework is to leave women
in their current position with no
power at all. A woman worker in
a Distress Center for women and
children in Canada said, “The
women who stay with us here
come from situations of marital
breakdown. They have often
been married for ten to fifteen
years. They have nothing to
show for it. No home, no fur-
niture, no dignity, no money...
It happens all the time and it’s
time we women did something
about it. Whatever we are doing,
whatever situations we are in,
we are all exploited in the same
way, as unpaid house-
workers... If the women in the
Distress Center had been paid
for the work they had done in the
home they wouldn't be on wel-
fare today.”

In addition, says WFH, the free
time women gain will sup-
posedly be used for organizing
more women. This, in itself, is a
questionable premise, for there
