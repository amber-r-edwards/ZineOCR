Feminist Economic Conference  
Feminist Economic Seeds Split  

— Two Groups  

Jackie St. Joan  

A convention to “plant the  
seeds of feminist economic re-  
volution” was held at the De-  
troit YWCA over Thanksgiving  
weekend. The convention,  
sponsored by the Feminist  
Federal Credit Union (FFCU) of  
Detroit, was attended by some  
75 feminists, mostly from  
feminist credit unions (CUs), and  
from some feminist businesses.  
The purposes of the convention  
were two-fold: to have educa-  
tional workshops on practicali-  
ties and theories of operating a  
feminist business; and to organ-  
ize the first meeting of a na-  
tional association to be called  
the Feminist Economic Network  
(FEN).  

The convention participants  
could not, however, agree on the  
national network's common  
principles, immediate goals, and  
internal structure. The clash oc-  
curred on Friday evening. By  
Sunday morning there emerged  
from the conference, two  
organizations (with some differ-  
ent, but with many overlapping  
purposes): the Feminist Econo-  
mic Alliance (FEA) and the  
Feminist Economic Network  
(FEN). (More details of the dis-  
pute are discussed in Perspec-  
tive: the Detroit Story, on p. of  
this issue.)  

Convention Background  

In May, 1975, a meeting of  
several feminist CUs was held in  
New Haven, at which time the  
idea of a national organization  
was proposed by Valerie Angers  
and Joanne Parrent of FFCU of  
Detroit. (The first feminist CU  
was organized by them in De-  
troit 2½ years ago. Since that  
time, 13 other feminist CUs have  
been formed, most of them still  
in their initial stages of opera-  
tion.)  

The purposes of the proposed  
national organization were  
broad. They included the forma-  
tion of cooperation in areas of  
mutual need (data processing,  
organizational handbooks, col-  
lateral funds); a possible femin-  
ist institute to train women in  
the operation of feminist  
businesses; and, most  
importantly, the formation of a  
national association which  
would provide a funnel through  
which feminist CUs could in-  
vest in feminist businesses to  
provide an economic power base  
for feminist work. At the New  
Haven meeting it was decided  
that the Washington Area  
Feminist Federal CU (WAFFCU)  
and the Connecticut FFCU would  
draw up different proposals for  
the by-laws of such an associa-  
tion, that dues were to be paid by  
participating organizations, and  
that a convention was to be held  
in Detroit in November to  
organize nationally.  

The by-laws proposals were to  
be submitted by August, so they  
could be circulated before the  
convention. According to  
Joanne Parrent, the FFCU of De-  
troit, not having received any by-  
laws, drew up its own plan for  
the structure and operation of  
the association with help from  
three women from the Oakland  
Feminist Women’s Health Clinic  
(FWHC), Barbara Hoke, Laura  
Brown, and Debra Law. Thus, at  
the very first welcoming meeting  
of the Detroit convention, the  
participants were confronted  
with three sets of by-laws (one  
from Connecticut, one from  
Washington, and one from  
Detroit.) A By-laws Committee,  
made up of women from the  
three groups, was to meet all day  
Friday to try to work up one com-  
prehensive set of by-laws for the  
association.  

Friday Workshops  

Most of the women attending,  
not being aware of the nature of  
the by-laws controversy, or the  
exact purposes of the national  
association, spent Friday in  

workshops, while others were  

engaged in political battles  
around the by-laws of the pro-  
posed feminist economic net-  
work. Workshop topics included  
such issues as Loan Policy,  
Structure, Budgeting and  
Growth Projection, Internal Edu-  
cation and Training, Promotion,  
Feminism and Economic Theory,  
Feminism and Racism,  
Accountability within Feminist  
Institutions, Financial Manage-  
ment and Cash Flow, and  
Feminist Institutions as Power  
Base for Revolution.  

By lunchtime, it was becoming  
clear that some kind of subplot  
was going on. Many women,  
expecting workshops with con-  
crete information about the  
operation of CUs, were sur-  
prised to find that about half of  
the workshops were being led by  
women from the Oakland  
FWHC, and that discussions  
were mostly centering on the  
politics and organizational pat-  
terns of that group.  

What Is Success?  

In the Structure Workshop, for  
example, ideas flowed back and  
forth on questions of leader-  
ship, privilege, collectivity, suc-  
cess, commitment, and repres-  
entation. However, no concrete  
conclusions or recommenda-  
tions resulted from the work-  
shop itself. (The following is an  
edited version of a discussion  
which took place in the Struc-  
tures Workshop, coordinated by  
Debra Law.)  

Debra Law (FWHC/Missouri  
FFCU): “When we look at some-  
thing like a feminist economic  
network, we can see that some  
of the very same principles  
which have allowed the Femin-  
ist Women’s Health Clinics  
(FWHCs) to be successful on a  
local level are applicable to FEN.  
One thing I’ve experienced is  
that the women who do the work  
have the most laid out on the  
line, and, therefore, inherently  
do make the best decisions.”  
Bev Fisher (Quest): “But how do  
you select who will do the work?  
People will do the work if they  
have the time, the daycare, and  
a way to survive, and if they’re  
getting paid for what they do,  
and if they have some skills.”  
Debra: “The FWHC is one suc-  
cessful institution that has ques-  
tioned some of the very values  
which feminist institutions have  
used in their operation. We have  
to analyze the track record, and  
see what has taken us where we  
want to go. Collectivity ob-  
viously has not taken us where  
we want to go. Values which do  
put us in the position of being the  
most powerful have.”  

Bev: “I'm not contending with  
your basic assumption — that  
FWHCs are successful — but the  
basis of that statement is a  
judgment on your part about  
what is success. Not everyone  
would necessarily agree that the  
FWHC is the criterion by which  
we should judge success, and  
that therefore their structures  
are successful. We have to  
spend some time talking about  
our goals because if we can all  
agree on where we want to go,  
then if we get there, that would  
be termed a success.”  

Caroline Sparks (Columbus  
Women’s Action Collective): “In  
discarding our old traditional  
structures, we all have gaps in  
handling the procedures for that  
change. But I think it’s pre-  

mature to throw out notions of  

collectivity altogether.”  

We Need Leaders  
Beverly Boothwoman (FFCU,  
Lansing Branch): “We have to  
look for leaders who are capable,  
rational, and have an overall  
capability for decision-making to  
provide direction. We've tried in  
the Political Caucus, in NOW, in  
all our groups to find structures  
that work, but none of them  
have. How can you have a  
power base when you have 87  
different opinions in trying to  
develop a national consensus on  
policy? I think we need to talk  
about a group of women — and I  
don’t care how they’re picked.  
They set policy — then you have  
a power base.”  

Maria Bithorn (Conn. FFCU): “It is  
not easy to know how to choose  
committed women for the front  
line. We may know locally who is  
committed, but how do we know  
nationally?”  

Caroline: “If the staff is only  
responsible to themselves, then  
what responsibility do we have  
to people out there in the  
community?”  

Debra: “We have to have value  
audits (Ed.— See FEN By-laws  
below) to determine if institu-  
tions, structures, are feminist  
and working in all of our inter-  
ests. I see no arbitrary separa-  
tion between myself working in  
a feminist institution and the  
community, because I see no  
separation between my best in-  
terests and any other woman's  
best interest.”  

Commonality of Women  
Bev: “Saying that whatever is  
good for me is good for every  
other woman denies that there  
is a distinction between com-  
munities. For instance, there  
certainly is a difference be-  
tween the Los Angeles FWHC  
and Watts. Our ultimate goal  
may be to give every woman a  
job in a woman-created insti-  
tution, but we have to look at  
what is actually possible. To jus-  
tify saying that the women who  
do the work make all the deci-  
sions by saying that we're going  
to provide all women with jobs  
today, even in the city of Detroit,  
is absurd. There's a big gap be-  
tween employing 20 women in a  
FWHC, and 5000 women, whom  
you can't employ right now,  
make up a different community  
and have different needs.”  
Debra: “I see what you mean, but  
I disagree. One of the principles  
of feminism is that there is a  
basic commonality between  
women. Not that there are not  
tremendous differences, but  
that I, as a woman, do not have  
any different vested interest. If a  
woman was putting out a publi-  
cation, like The Monthly Extract,  
there would be no reason for me  
to believe that her interests were  
any different than mine. It's an  
extremely important assump-  
tion, and I believe the only one  
we can work on.”  

Caroline: “Then, knowing that  
others may not share your as-  
sumption, FEN cannot set itself  
up as controllers of a section of  
the feminist movement. I under-  
stand it’s very tempting — I'm a  

very frustrated person after 5 or  
6 years of this kind of work. But  
you can't just say, I've just got to  
get on with it.”  

Debra: “We can say we have  
certain values and that’s who we  
are, and if you can join us, fine,  
and if you can't, then do what  
you have to do. If the original  
group tries to pull in everybody at  
once, they distort themselves so  
that they become nothing for  
nobody.”  

Bev: “I agree it's better to ex-  
clude people than to have this  
phony ‘because we're femin-  
ist we have all these things in  
common.’ Using CUs as a base,  
which have no political criteria  
for joining, then to claim to be a  
network of all the CUs in this  
country, is very deceptive. Because  
that then leads people to believe  
that all CUs agree to the objectives  
of this national network, and that’s  
not true.”  

CUs As Strategy  

Debra: “Credit unions are a per-  
fect strategy for a political body.  
My goal in life is not to set up and  
run a CU. But what a CU is  
allowing is more money in the  
women's community, providing  
myself and other women the ap-  
portunity of working full-time for  
revolution, and working to  
create an economic base.”  
Bev: “The basis of the whole  
ideology of feminism is the ques-  
tion — what do I have in common  
with every other woman? I'm not  
sure exactly what it is, but it has  
something to do with identity,  
feeling, a psychology existence  
that males don’t experience —  
call it the female principle or  
whatever. But, what that com-  
monality means in relationship  
to how you survive  
economically, where you live in  
this world, what color your skin  
is, what your language is — all of  
these other things, I have not  
figured out. Maybe when I’m 60  
and retired, I can spend my time  
contemplating on the common  
ality of women, but for the next  
30 years I’m going to spend time  
on concrete organizing, around  
specific tangible goals. Then I  
will find out who are the people  
who share those goals on all dif-  
ferent levels.”  

“When you try to justify what  
you're doing in a project by this  
visionary idea of the com-  
monality of women, it just  
doesn’t hold water. We have got  
to set concrete goals this week-  
end, so we find out who are our  
political allies in working to-  
wards those goals.”  

Meanwhile Back at the  
Bylaws Committee  
Meanwhile, the By-laws Com-  

mittee had been working all day.  
During the morning, the Con-  
necticut and Washington by-  
laws were discussed, but the  
Detroit-Oakland FWHC women,  
many of whom had been lead-  
ing workshops during the mor-  
ning, did not participate. Late in  
the afternoon, the Detroit by-  
laws were considered, when the  
Detroit-Oakland FWHC pre-  
sented their concept of the  
structure and goals of the na-  
tional organization.  

However, when they found  
out there was little support in the  
By-laws Committee for their pro-  
posal, the representatives from  
Detroit-Oakland FWHC, together  
with some women from the  
Washington FFCU left the  
room. The remaining 15 women,  
representing seven other CUs,  
and opposing the Detroit by-  
laws in favor of the Connecticut  
by-laws, continued to hash out  
the final points until dinner-  
time.  

Points of Conflict  

In general, no one was in dis-  
agreement over the Statement  
of Purpose which had been pro-  
posed by the Detroit by-laws.  
The conflicts arose over the pur-  
poses and structure of the pro-  
posed organization. In general,  
the Connecticut by-laws pro-  
vided for a representative struc-  
ture, with its main purposes  
focusing on the development of  
more and better feminist CUs.  
The Detroit structure was based  
on a concept of participation, no  
representation, and provided for  
a centralized Board, made up of  
both feminist CUs and feminist  
businesses.  

The main sections of the  
Detroit by-laws which were sub-  
jects of controversy were the  
following:  

1) Purpose to accept  
financial leadership for the  
feminist movement;  

2) Purpose: “... to invest in profit  
and non-profit business enter-  
prises operated by and for the  
feminist movement.”  

3) Membership: Voting  
membership in the organization  
would be limited to persons who  
are members of the Board of  
Directors;  

4) Membership: Non-voting  
membership is available to  
(among others) dues-paying  
feminist enterprises.  

5) Membership: A prerequisite  
to membership in the organiza-  
tion shall be that each feminist  
enterprise adopt and imple-  
ment the Statement of Purpose.  
Failure to do so, as determined  
by value auditors, authorized by  
the Board of Directors to  
evaluate said organization, may  
result in termination of member-  
ship.  

6) Directors: Any feminist  
woman who meets the following  
criteria shall be eligible to be a  
voting member of the Board of  
Directors:  

a) She was a founder of and is  
presently employed in a self-  
supporting feminist enterprise; or  

b) She has worked for 3 years  
for a self-supporting feminist  
enterprise ...  

The Detroit proposal was a  
very different one, in structure,  
from the Connecticut by-laws.  
The Connecticut by-laws  
proposed (among other items,  
almost indistinguishable from  
Detroit's by-laws):  

1) Purposes: deleting the pur-  
pose of investment in feminist  
enterprises, at this time.  

2) Membership: Voting  
memberships shall be limited to  
Feminist CUs who are members  
of the Regional/National Coun-  
cils of FEN. Regional Councils  
shall be made up of elected or  
appointed representatives from  
member credit unions on the  
grassroots level. The National  
Council shall be made up of
