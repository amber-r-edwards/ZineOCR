Taproot:  
Feminism  
in Action  

TAPROOT is a service  
oriented non-profit organiza-  
tion “dedicated to advancing  
the opportunities for women  
and minorities in employ-  
ment, education and econo-  
mic development through  
both traditional and non-tra-  
ditional means.”  

TAPROOT was organized by  
seven Boulder feminists in the  
spring who chose the name  
TAPROOT because they see  
the root of “the woman’s  
problem” being women's eco-  
nomic powerlessness and  
women's traditional condi-  
tioning to accept this defini-  
tion of herself.  

The taproot of a tree is the  
source of its development so  
the nourishment of the tap-  
root provides is vital to the  
health of the tree.  

Membership in TAPROOT is  
open to anyone who shares a  
basic commitment to social  
equality. Members are eligible  
for participation in a food  
buying co-op and for group  
health and life insurance.  
Members can also register for  
classes at a reduced rate -  
classes designed to fill in  
some gaps in the traditional  
education offered to men and  
women. TAPROOT also offers  
assistance to businesses and  
organizations seeking profes-  
sional advice in developing  
creative employment practi-  
ces to meet the increasing  
obligations of affirmative ac-  
tion and equal employment  
guidelines.  

The Boulder based group is  
offering diverse courses this  
fall, beginning October 21.  
Among those available are:  
You and the Law, Common  
Car Care, the Single Father,  
the Single Solution (interper-  
sonal relationships), Home  
Canning, Preparing for Re-  
tirement.  

For registration information  
write to TAPROOT, box 3119,  
Boulder, Colorado, 80303 or  
call 494-6131. Some scholar-  
ship funds are available in

effort to enhance the position  
of women and minorities in  
our society. In many cases,  
work scholarships or trades  
with instructors may also be  
arranged.

Boulder Resource Center Opens  

The Boulder County Wo-  

men’s Resource Center  

opened in September after its  
establishment was highly  
recommended by the city's  
Task Force on Women and  
Children. The Center is  
currently seeking funding so  
that it will be able to  
adequately deal with the  
problems women face in  
education, employment, legal  
issues, health and child care.  
The space the Center occu-  
pies in downtown Boulder is  
donated and shared by Wo-  
manpower, a job resource and  
referral agency. The office is  
staffed by volunteers, gradu-  

ate students and a half-time  
release employee from the  
Mental Health Center.  

A previous Women’s Center  
in Boulder, housed in High-  
land school, was anti-struc-  
ture and therefore hard to  
maintain, according to staff at  
the newly organized center.  
Any woman can receive  
walk-in counseling (of the  
non-professional type), infor-  
mation, referrals. There are  
brown bag lunches every  
Thursday for working women  
and other women who want to  
come and talk or just get to  
know the center.  

Women who work with the  
resource center are very  

representative of all women in  
Boulder, says Barbara Caley,  
a staff person. “There are  
women from diverse econo-  
mic, social backgrounds. Sin-  
gle heads of households,  
older and younger women,  
working women and profes-  
sional women.” The resource  
center will also work with  
other women's groups in  
Boulder so that services won't  
be duplicated and so that  
issues such as child care  
facilities in the city can be  
focused on by all women.  
Finally, it seems, Boulder  
women’s groups are coming  
together.  

Women’s Liberation Coalition  
Begins Another Term  

The Women's Liberation  
Coalition at the University of  
Colorado has come to life  
again after summer vacation.  
Although some women are  
facing trial for their part in the  
demonstration and occupa-  
tion of a university building  
last spring over the issue of  
day care, the first meeting  
drew about seventy women  
who listened to the history of  
the coalition and got involved  
in making its history for this  
school year.  

The coalition has speakers  
who go into the Boulder  
community to talk about  
women’s liberation. It has a  
media and community con-  
tacts committee and intends  
to coordinate its activities  
with other women’s groups. A  
newsletter will be written to  
hopefully reach dormitories  
with new students who don’t  
understand or have miscon-  
ceptions of women’s libera-  
tion.  

As a result of the day care  
action last spring, the coali-  
tion maintains, the university  
has begun construction on a  
day care center for 60 children  
- hardly enough for the  
demonstrated need for child  
care. It won't be finished until  
March or April (it was  

supposed to open this month)  
and student housing fees are  
building it. Fees for married  
student housing and for  
Kiddie Kampus, the small day  
care center the University now  
has, have been raised to pay  
back the loan. There is also a  
conflict between the concept  
of a center for child care and  
private home child care. The  
University favors individually  
licensed child care homes.  
Future action around the  
issue is planned at the next  
Regent meeting sometime in  
October.  

Another area that affects  
women at the school is the  
struggle that workers in the  
student grill have had and  
continue to have with man-  
agement. According to one  
woman who was recently fired  
from the grill with no warning  
(contrary to State Personnel  
procedure that requires 3  
warnings, 2 of which must be  
written) the management is  
unorganized, has no com-  
munication with workers, is  
all male, although half of all  
workers are female. Last year  
university employees that  
didn’t belong to unions tried  
to organize but were satisfied  
with a small wage increase  
and more input into policy  
decisions.  

Another activity of the  
coalition is the Women's  
Crisis Project that would get a  
Women's Center established  
near the campus so that not  
only students but also com-  
munity women could use the  
facility. Self-defense, self-  
help, legal resources, career  
counseling and intramurals  
are some of the activities that  
the center would sponsor. A  
hotline for rape referrals and  
information would also be  
established. Money is cur-  
rently being requested from  
the student government. “We  
need to show that we are here.  
We're paying out money and  
now we want some back,”  
says one member.  

In the past the structure and  
organization of the coalition  
has been very loose. This year  
women in the coalition want  
to see a definite strong  
organization so that women  
will have someone there when  
they need help or communi-  
cation with other women who  
share their oppressed posi-  
tion.  

A three member steering  
committee helps coordinate  
the activities of the coalition.  
The office is in the student  
union across from the grill in  
room 181.

Women’s  
Studies  

The Women's Studies Pro-  
gram at the University of  
Colorado is beginning acade-  
mic consciousness raising in  
the school’s departments and  
courses. The program coordi-  
nates and helps sponsor  
courses in the College of Arts  
and Sciences that deal with  
the neglected subject of  
women either as makers of  
history or as potential crea-  
tors of their own lives. Women  
in Literature, the sex roles of  
women in sociology, women's  
history, Experiential Studies  
courses in women’s oppres-  
sion and liberation and  
women in cross-cultural per-  
spectives from the Anthropology  
Department are some of  
the courses a woman can take  
at the university this fall.  

“At this point, we don't  
offer our own courses,” says  
Carol Pearson, director of the  
Women’s Studies Program.  
“We didn't ask for recognition  
as a department of our own for  
many reasons. Historically,  
departments that were for  
women even though they were  
heavy in academics turned  
into home ec. centers and the  
university wouldn't support  
them. There is no reason to  
think that would happen here  
but such a department may  
tend to congregate all women  
faculty in one department and  
create a ghettoization of  
women.  

“It would also take good  
women out of regular depart-  
ments and make it less likely  
that the general student body  
would take the courses, but  
rather only those students  
who were already interested in  
women’s studies.”  

Pearson also sees the  
necessity for “turning on  
students” and concerning  
other faculty members to  
change a course or teach it  
from another perspective that  
would include the historical  
neglect that academia has  
given women. This is another  
reason why it’s important not  
to isolate women’s studies in  
its own department.  

The Women’s Studies Pro-  
gram can be issues oriented  
or research oriented, its  
direction hasn’t yet crystal-  
lized. Office hours are from 9  
to 5 at Hillside Court #7, 17th  
and University in Boulder.
