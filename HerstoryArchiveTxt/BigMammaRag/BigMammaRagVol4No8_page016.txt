Eve and Others...

ing through the countryside to get
away from the strangers. In her tra-
vels, she comes across a deaf-and-
dumb young boy with whom she had an
affair, bringing about an unwanted
pregnancy. However, she asks Joseph,
a local old man to marry her. Every-
one lives happily ever after until
one day Joseph asks Mary who the real
father of the child is. Mary tells
him "God" and begins a tremendous
chain of events with that single
answer.

God is portrayed as a wizened old
patriarch who sits around in bull
sessions with men who tell the women
"God says so" whenever their whims
are questioned. Eve and Lot's wife
are two that speak to this idea, that
God is just another for “because so",
a convenient excuse for men to rule
women.

Eve is much more intelligent than
Adam, who only wants to sleep and eat
and fuck. Eve gets lonely and ques-
tions the status quo and Adam tells
her to be quiet because "God doesn't
like too many questions". The ser-

successful, and alive, whether they
be around starting a feminist book-
store, newspaper, massage group, or
getting school lunches and stop signs.
These groups build relationships
based on respect and trust. They in-
volve a commitment to something
larger than ourselves, feminism and
revolutionary change, and such a be-
lief is very nourishing. Criticism/
self-criticism sessions facilitate
emotional growth.

Eventually we will realize that
we are the best there is and that
no one can know more about us than
we do; we are our own best authori-
ties.

Eve falls in love with Eve and teaches itself to talk so it can be
close to her. Of course, Eve eats the
fruit from the tree of knowledge of
good and evil and God banishes them
from the Garden. Eve, now understand-
ing a lot more of motives and other
things, only says, "So?"

Lot's wife is turned into a pillar
of salt, not because she turned to
look at the burning city, but be-
cause she started back to her beloved
home. She preferred dying with her
best friend, Rebeccah, to living with
Lot, whom she hated. There is some-
what of a hint that she and Rebeccah
were lovers, also.

All in all, the stories are well
written and very funny. Estelle
Eirinberg has put forth quite an
effort in maintaining the dryness of
the original French. Owing to pre-
vious reviews, this reviewer has
been accused of not liking anything;
however, this is the book that
breaks the mold. It is a book well
worth reading several times.

Perhaps you should, to ensure that
you are protected from contamination.
After all, the revolution will only
be won by radical-lesbian-feminist-

and analysis are ideologically
correct.

does the practice of sado-masochism
(in whatever guise) help us get
closer to that goal? By teaching us
to act as the oppressor acts? By al-
lowing us to "play" victim? Do these
things not, in fact, hinder us by re-
inforcing male patterns of power and
dominance? What do we gain by emulat-
ing our enemy? Our struggle to be free
is real - not theatre.

Our treatise, as you call it, on
sado-masochism appeared in our Strug-
gle column because we struggled
mightily with the issue - through 3
collective meetings, 1 community
meeting, and numerous discussions
over a 3 month period. Your statement
that it was based on fear rather than
experience is incorrect - as women
who have been raised in the patri-
archy, we are only too familiar with
sado-masochism.

As to your statement that "your
lover" attempted to join the BMR
Collective - if that is the case, we
find it strange that in her entire
time in Denver she was in the BMR
office but once, at which time she
said nothing about wanting to work
with the paper on a collective level.
Two women who are on the collective
did meet with her privately, at her
request, to discuss with her certain

"vibes" which she felt the Denver
collective had toward her. Basically, what
she was told by the women was that
they felt that her position on sado-
masochism was a spot where her fem-
inist analysis "fell apart". They
said that, because of this, they
would not be as quick to validate her
analysis of other issues. At no time
did the women say that they would
not work with her politically.
