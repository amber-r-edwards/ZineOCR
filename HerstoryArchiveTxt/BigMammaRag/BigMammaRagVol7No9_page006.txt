Criminal Caps

Barbara Seaman, author of “Women
and the Crisis in Sex Hormones,”
testified before the Senate Health
Subcommittee last month to protest
the Food and Drug Administration's
ruling which would result in a ban
of the cervical cap, a contracep-
tive used in England and Western
Europe. "One of our (National Wo-
men's Health) Network member physi-
cians ordered cervical caps from
England for her patients," Seaman
reported. "The caps were seized by
federal agents. FDA should be con-
fiscating truly dangerous contracep-
tives like Depo-Provera, not the
cervical cap.”

DES Daughter

In the second ruling of its kind
this summer, a Chicago woman was
awarded $800,000 in damages that re-
sulted from her mother taking the
"wonder drug" of the early 1950s,
DES. Anne Needham, who is now ster-
ile because of extensive surgery
and treatment that she had to under-
go as a result of DES-induced can-
cer, sued the manufacturer of the
DES her mother took, and was award-
ed the $800,000 after a nine-day
trial.

Blue Brain

What makes you smell like an ox and
turns your brain blue? Why it's acety-
ethyl tetramethyl teralin (AETT), the
stuff that gives the musk fragrance
to soaps, deodorants, perfumes and
creams. That wonderful musk fragrance
designed to drive someone crazy with
passion might drive its users crazy
as well. A report in Science magazine
said that rats receiving as little as
25 milligrams of AETT per kilogram of
body weight each day showed behavioral
changes as soon as two to three
weeks. These changes were accompanied
by a progressive blue discoloration
of the brain and nervous system and
marked degeneration of the nerves.

Fetus Frolic

Anti-choicer Dr. Phillip Ney has
come up with a new gimmick. Why not
dash into a hospital and snatch an
aborted fetus? If it dies, says Ney,
you can report the doctor who per-
formed the abortion to the College
of Physicians and Surgeons, recom-
mending a charge of negligence. Ney
told 100 delegates to an anti-choice
conference that it is within any-
one's rights to protect another
person; this would be legal justi-
fication for the hospital raid.

Wanted: Bad Girls

A recent study shows that “girls
have a tendency to blindly support
male authors just because they are
male." In this study, the same story,
"Grizzlies in Their Backyard,” by
Beth Day, was read to a group of Sev-
enth-graders. The first class was
told the author was Sally Bronson and
the second class was told the author
was Richard Bronson. Girls responded
to the female author about the same
way boys responded to both male and
female authors; however, girls gave
no negative responses to the story
when believing it was written by a man.

The BC Teacher's Federation said,
"These results are consistent with
descriptions of other types of behav-
ior patterns in the classroom. Girls
tend to be less disruptive, more task
oriented and more anxious to please
authority figures."

Rampant Racism

A couple of
the teachers
began talking
one day about
the televised
production of
Maya Angelou's
"I Know Why
The Caged
Bird Sings."
The teacher
sitting next
to me said
she didn't
think the
children's acting was very convinc-
ing. The librarian sitting across
from us placed her hands around her
mouth in such a way as to allow only
us to hear her: “After seeing all
the black faces around here all day
long, why do you want to go home and
watch them on TV?" For once, the us-
ually articulate teacher expressed
shock in her eyes, stuttered and be-
came speechless. (From a para in the
Oakland public schools.)

Third World Feminists

Several third world women are
planning a Radical Third World Fem-
inists' Anthology: A Woman to Woman
Dialogue of essays by women of color
on their perspectives regarding the
feminist movement. They want to ex-
press to all women, and especially
to white middle-class women, the
experiences which divide them as
feminists. They also want to exam-
ine incidents of intolerance, preju-
dice, and denial of differences
within the feminist movement.

Articles as short as two pages or
as long as 3,000 words will be ac-
cepted for consideration. Submis-
sions, accompanied by a self-adres-
sed stamped envelope, may be sent
to Gloria Anzaldua, 948 Noe St.,
San Francisco, CA 94114. Deadline
for submissions is October 15.

No Endorsement

Because of complaints received from
participants about the interviewing
process, the National Gay Task Force
has withdrawn its cooperation with
Renee Epstein's research project.

Renee Epstein was touring the coun-
try interviewing gay parents and their
children for a book that she is writ-
ing. She has finished the interviewing
and is now in the process of putting
it together.

Aiding Mothers

The Supreme Court has unanimously
declared unconstitutional the dis-
criminatory, sex-based classifica-
tion in the Aid to Families with
Dependent Children, Unemployed Fath-
er program. Now needy families in
which the breadwinner mother is out
of work will have as much right to
receive welfare funds as those with
unemployed fathers. The Court's de-
cision in this case is seen as a
victory for women not only because
they are recognized as breadwinners
but also because it will provide
real economic benefits to disadvan-
taged women whose families qualify
for income assistance.

Trying for Face Lift

WPRO, a Providence, Rhode Island
radio station, has issued an apology
to its listeners concerning a con-
test it broadcast that included the
question: “How many times have you
looked at your wife and yearned for
a younger model, one with less miles
and a little more style?" Winners
were to receive gifts for their
wives—lingerie, a face-lift, and
a visit to a figure salon. In re-
sponse to complaints to the Federal
Communications Commission, the ad-
vertising campaign was removed from
the air.

Trust in the Law?

“If it was my house, I would have
beat my wife for the condition it
was in," said detective Bruce Dunne.
He was referring to the messy state
of the southeast Calgary home of a
man busted for illegal possession
of ammunition. Speaking at the pre-
liminary hearing against the man,
Dunne testified that the accused's
home provided "good cause for wife-
beating."

Dangers of Marriage

Dr. Elaine Hilberman conducted a
study at a rural health clinic in
North Carolina and found, “in a
twelve-month period half of all the
women referred by the medical staff
for psychiatric evaluation were
found to be victims of marital vio-
lence."

Marked for Life

During the 1971 civil war in
Bangladesh, an estimated 200,000
women were raped by Pakistani sol-
diers. Women who have been raped
face ostracism. In order to pro-
tect these victims, the prime min-
ister declared them, “the truest
heroines of our country's fight
for independence," and urged the
young men of Bangladesh to marry
them. However, despite government
efforts to include these women
in society, no husbands have come
forward.

Unpackaging Sex

In Tokyo, women activists have or-
ganized to protest "sex package
tours” in which all-male groups of
Japanese “tourists” are flown to
Seoul, Manila and other areas once
occupied by the Japanese army. In
leaflets distributed at Narita air-
port, the women compared the male
"tourists" to imperialist assault
forces and ended, "Let's find a new
way to live together with Asians."

Kicking Culture

A number of feminist groups in
California have responded to the
recent decision by the California
State Senate to reject Jane Fonda's
nomination to the California Arts
Council. In an open letter to the
people of California, groups from
the Los Angeles Women's Building
said: "This attack has serious rami-
fications for any artist who makes
social awareness a vital element of
her art. The Senate action deals a
deadly blow to community artists
who strive for content and meaning
in their art; who voice their per-
sonal views and the views of their
community through their art."

“Miss Piggy is everything
we don’t want our daughters to be.”

A woman writing into a Houston
feminist paper warns of the dangers
of The Muppet Movie: "I was appalled
at the blatant sexism of the film.
Naturally, the main character/hero
was a male figure, Kermit the Frog,
who goes through a series of marvel-
ous adventures on his way to seek
fame and fortune in Hollywood. Of the
20 characters in the film, three were
female. Miss Piggy was the only one
of the three who had what could be
considered a major role. The audience
first meets her as the winner of a
beauty contest. She is beautiful (for
a pig), but of course, as the stereo-
type goes—"you can't be both beaut-
iful and intelligent at the same
time"—therefore, the big-busted,
blonde Miss Piggy is an idiot. She
is everything we don't want our
daughters to be."

Got a Broom Stick?

An official of the Law Enforce-
ment Assistance Administration told
Little Rock, Arkansas officials at
a meeting: "The easiest way to re-
duce the rape rate would be to get
more people married. In most cases
the assailant and the victim know
each other and if they were married
there could be no crime."
