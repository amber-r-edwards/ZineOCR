training staff puts together a
variety of workshops and
seminars related to human
sexuality, family planning and
management. Some of the
programs offered can be taken
for credit at the University of
Northern Colorado. The Planned
Parenthood people feel
that an important aspect of
their work involves public
education. To that end, the
agency will furnish brochures,
films and speakers not only to
explain contraceptives and
family planning services, but
also to assist groups studying
topics like the population
problem or human sexuality.
Developing Finances

Obviously, an agency offering
this range of services
needs a broad financial base.
And Rocky Mountain Planned
Parenthood, a non-profit or-
ganization, is developing that.
Services such as problem
pregnancy counseling, abor-
tion clinics, vasectomy coun-
seling, and vasectomy clinics
are supported totally by the
persons using them. Almost
all other functions of the
agency are paid for by a
combination of funds. An
important part of the financ-
ing comes from patient fees in
the contraceptive clinic. State
and federal (HEW) monies add
supplemental funding, which
is rarely guaranteed for more
than a year at a time. Private
tax-deductible donations
make up the remainder of the
income. Despite these various
sources of financial assist-
ance, RMPP consistently

seeks additional funding to

meet the increasing demand
for family planning services in
Colorado.

Being a private agency and
receiving some government
aid puts RMPP in a unique
position. The fact that it is
private means that Planned
Parenthood can change pol-
icies more quickly with fewer
bureaucratic hassles than a
public agency. Also, the
staff and administration
feel freer to be innovative and
can expect less public re-
action because the agency is
private. This is an important
point when one works in an
area as intimate and personal
as family planning. However,

a positive result of RMPP
using HEW monies is that the
consumers of Planned Par-
enthood services have the
opportunity to be on a
Participant Advisory Council
(PAC). It is a channel for
patients to tell the agency
what they feel and how they
would prefer clinics to func-
tion. Any regular contracept-
ive patient can ask to be on
the PAC for her clinic.

Human Component

The PAC is just one of the
human components running
Planned Parenthood. There
are also administrators and
staff who are paid to keep the
whole operation going on a
consistent basis. They are the
ones that patients come in
contact with, so they can truly
make a clinic visit dreadful,
tolerable or positive. Volun-
teers who work in clinics or
serve on administrative
boards supply valuable kinds
of support to the entire RMPP
system.

All these persons have two
common commitments. The
first is to free women and men
from the burden of unplanned
or unwanted births, no matter
what their income or lifestyle
or race or culture happens to
be. That means the patient
decides if she or he will have
any children and if so, when
children are desirable and how
many are wanted. The second
one is to assist people in
understanding and taking
healthy care of their bodies.

These are not easy commit-
ments. There are many taboos
and misconceptions and re-
sentments that make those
commitments difficult. How-
ever, Colorado residents con-
tinue to come to Rocky Moun-
tain Planned Parenthood in
increasing numbers, with
needs for more varied services
than ever before. So the
people working at RMPP try to
improve those services and
deliver them in the most

efficient and personable way
possible.

“The largest area of the
HANDBOOK is devoted to
gonorrhea so that ‘we can rid
ourselves of this unnecessary
and unpleasant complication
to sexual freedom’. Gonorrhea
is transmitted through vagi-
nal, anal or oral-gential
intercourse and presently
afflicts 2,000,000 Americans a
year. Eighty percent of the
women infected with gonor-
rhea have no symptoms for
the first few weeks or months
until complications set in,
while men have symptoms in
three to five days. Thus the
need for partners to inform
each other becomes acute....

know what the doctor found,

Menstrual Extraction Controversial

Menstrual extraction, or
endometrial aspiration, is a
process by which the uterine
lining is removed from a
woman at the time when her
monthly period is due. A four
to six mm cannula is
introduced through a suction
pump, and uterine lining is
removed all at once. The
process takes about 60
seconds. If menstrual extrac-
tion is performed within 5 to
10 days after the date the
menstrual period is due, the
menstrual lining of the uterus
and any fertilized egg which
might have been implanted
there will be removed.

There are several controver-
sies surrounding the use of
this technique. First, there is
considerable discussion as to
whether the technique should
be used at all. Supporters
argue that (1) the use of the
cannula simplifies the abor-
tion procedure by virtually

treatment from a doctor who
will not accompany it with a
thorough explanation. It then
devotes four pages to the
types of medicines, dosages
and methods of administration
(injection, pills, etc.) most
effective. The negative effects
of certain drugs, alternative
medicines for those with
allergies, and medicines to be
avoided during pregnancy are
also detailed...

“There is a beautiful effort
to rid the HANDBOOK of
sexism and racism. Doctors
are not ‘he’ but ‘he or she’ and
a woman or a man’s sexual
partner is a ‘sexual partner’ or
‘lover’ not a specific sex.
Heterosexual and homosexual
relationships are dealt with
side by side with no bias
indicated. And drugs harmful
to specific people (such as

eliminating the need for
dilation of the cervix and
anesthesia. (2) Menstrual ex-
traction represents a faster
and less expensive method of
terminating a possible preg-
nancy test. Opponents of the
procedure argue that (1) the
technique is still experimen-
tal, (2) it is not painless and
women who have not had
children often require anes-
thesia, (3) it is not totally
reliable as an abortion tech-
nique (4) Many of the women
who undergo the technique
are not pregnant, (5) there is
not enough evidence to
determine the rates of uterine
perforation and infection, and

to determine the long-range

side effects.

The second controversy
involves the question of who
should perform menstrual
extraction. One perspective
claims that the procedure is
only safe if it is performed by
a qualified doctor, whereas

treatment recommendation.

“Perhaps the only criticism
of the HANDBOOK would be
in the attitude of total reliance
on the medical profession for
treatment of such things as
monilia and trichomonas. The
self-help clinic approach to
yeast infections would be
recommendation of vinegar
douches and yogurt applica-
tions to the vagina to return
the vaginal lining to its natural
acid state and bacterial/yeast
balance, not conducive to
yeast overgrowth. But since
a majority of people still rely
on institutions, education
ourselves to deal with
those institutions is also an
important step toward receiving
better medical care.”

others believe that the pro-
cedure is simple enough that
anyone trained in the tech-
nique can perform it.

The third area of discussion
concerns the use of menstrual
extraction as a method of
controlling the monthly men-
strual cycle. Menstrual
regulation eliminates the in-
convenience and discomforts
of the monthly period as well
as functioning as a contra-
ceptive measure. However,
even those who advocate the
use of menstrual extraction as
an abortion technique caution
against the unknown side
effects of its repeated use.

In addition to her writing,
she has been instrumental in
the formation of the Women’s
Institute for Alternative Psy-
chotherapy which will begin
around the first of the year.
Besides establishing new
methods of training and
theory, she wants to develop
new styles of organization for
women. One example of a
feminist approach to organi-
zation is consensual decision
making. In contrast to the
usual hierarchical method being
used to make decisions,
women can learn the skills of
group dynamics allowing
them to share equally in the
decision-making process.
This approach, of course,
requires a centeredness in
people who know who they
are and feel good about that.

Anne Wilson Schaef's work

exciting in the mental health

challenge the sacred cows,
but she brings to her work an
underlying strength from
within. Hers is a philosophy
that emphasizes the essence
of women and sees their
whole being on a level of
dignity essential to spiritual
as well as psychological
growth.
