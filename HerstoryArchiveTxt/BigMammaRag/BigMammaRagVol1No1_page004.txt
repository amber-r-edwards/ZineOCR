WRITE WOMEN BACK

INTO HISTORY

we DO have a history!

If the silence of the
historians is taken
to mean anything,

it would appear that
one-half of our po-
pulation have been
negligible factors

in our country's his-
tory. (Arthur M.
Schlesinger, Sr. New
Viewpoints in Ameri-
can History, 1922)

Fifty years ago an eminent
male historian called at-
tention to the gross neglect
of women in the standard
interpretations of American
history. It didn't do much
good, did it? How many of us
in the countless history
courses that we were fed in
public school or even college,
ever encountered a woman who
was important? If the authors
of textbooks felt compelled
to mention women, they
brought in two or three appa-
rent oddballs--Carrie Nation,
the temperance worker who
chopped down bars was a favo-
rite--leaving us with the
impression that real, normal
women have never been an in-
tegral part of American history.
This will be a regular
column that will discuss the
history of women in America,
as one way to begin to under-
mine the myth that only men
have had a history. The co-
lumn will take a variety of

forms--short biographies of
interesting women, book re-
views and discussions of the
conditions of women in the
past. Out of this we can
begin to know a little more
about our history.

The column might also
lead us to other questions.
Just what does the history
of women in America involve?
Does it mean rewriting male
WASP history to include

female superstars?

Or perhaps female history
should begin at the opposite
end with an examination of the
history of the family, that
intimate institution in which
most ordinary women have lived
out their lives. But who
was the “ordinary woman"? Was
there ever such a person? Was
she the middle class leisured
lady or the farm girl hired
to work in the textile mill?
Was she the Southern planta-
tion wife or her house slave?
What were the differences
among American women that
created the variations in the
experience of growing up female
in America? And beyond these
differences, was there a common
experience out of which a
feminist consciousness could
have developed? Did we develop
a female culture alongside
the dominant male culture?
Despite the neglect of wo-
men in the history texts,

there are many isolated books
with which we can begin the
task of putting ourselves back
into history. I will mention
a couple of these each issue.
To begin with, if you want to
get a general, overall picture
of the history of American
women, there are a couple of
good paperbacks out that
should be available at either
Together Books or RIP Bookstore.
Andrew Sinclair's The Emancipa-
tion of the American Woman

(available in paperback at the
library under the title The
Better Half) is a very readable
history that does a fair job
of dealing with more than just
superwomen and the women's
movement. The Woman in American
History (190 pp.) by Gerda
Lerner is shorter and was writ-
ten as a high school text.
However, it probably gives the
best short, overall picture
presently available.

I hope that this column will
reflect your interests as well
as mine. Please write and let
me know what you would like
me to write about as well as
your reactions to what I've
written. Susan Spragg Jones,

MOVIE REVIEW

Stand Up & Be Counted

The story line is stereo-
typically simple. Three main
characters--one a super-career
woman, one a hassled housewife,
and one a sex symbol married to
a business tycoon make up the
characters. Each, in her own
way, works out her personhood.

I won't dull the movie for you
by going into detail.

I do have strong positive and
negative feelings. One good
thing is that it is clearly
stated that there is no individ-
ual liberation. All women are
in the struggle together. The
movie showed women as strong,
sensitive people, capable of
changing their lives.

The "bad" are along the lines
of political criticism. The movie
didn't deal at all with the problems
of consumer capitalism. The women
in the movie are dressed like fa-
shion models, with full make-up and,
one assumes, vaginal deodorant.

The movie implies that, if a woman
wants to be liberated, she can go
out and get a tremendously satis-
fying job making tons of money. (Fat
chance) One of the sub-plots ques-
tions the right of a factory owner
to pay women less than men; it
never questions his right to own

the factory. Etc., etc., etc.

There are moments in the movie
that really embarrassed me with its
clumsiness. The "consciousness-
raising group scene" was clearly
made by someone never remotely con-

nected with consciousness-raising.

The movie briefly mentions les-
bians, poor women, older women, etc.,
but one shot on each subject is
hardly “in depth."

The way Senior Women's Liberation
was handled was degrading. It was
pretty clearly a man's view of older
women.

I think this review is a lot
more negative than is necessary.

For all its faults, I think you
will leave feeling excited and happy.

Even knowing that I was being
co-opted, I loved seeing women be-
ing "together."
