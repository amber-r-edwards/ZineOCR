A Day at the Zoo

A man who bit a woman on the but-
tocks in order to collect on a bet,
and then followed up this class act
by dumping a pitcher of beer over
her head, has been sentenced to work
one day for the county at the zoo.

The incident happened at a joint
called R.C.'s Beer Garden in Milwau-
kee, Wisconsin.

The woman was having a drink with
a friend when they noticed some men
staring at them. One of the men, a
stranger to the women, came over and
sat down on the floor behind one of
them. Then a crowd of people, both
men and women, gathered around; and
before the woman knew what had hap-
pened, she had been bitten, hard, on
the buttocks.

Things didn't stop there—when the
jerk tried to appease her anger by
buying her a drink, and she retaliat-
ed by throwing it in his face, he
got angry and dumped an entire pit-
cher of beer over her head.

But, never fear, the bar management
noticed the fray and came over to
intervene. They settled things by
pinning the woman against the wall,
and then by telling her that she
would have to leave.

When she requested that the jerk
be removed from the bar, the owner
retorted by saying, “Don't tell me
how to run my business."

The woman sought medical attention
for her injury and pressed criminal
charges through the city attorney's
office. The result was the zoo sen-
tence.

Said the assaulted woman, Debbie
Ehr, "Apparently when a man acts like
an animal, he must be put in the zoo.

"I would be satisfied only with
seeing the bar's liquor license sus-
pended or revoked. R.C.'s condoned
the incident...and in turn perpetua-
ted the myth that a woman is an ob-
ject, to be attacked, harassed and
degraded in any way conceivable by
a man. If a blatantly sexist event
such as this goes unnoticed...then
there is no justice in being a woman
in Milwaukee,"

"—or anywhere else, for that matter."

Safe House Overload

Two hours after opening, Cross-
roads, a shelter for battered women
in Fort Collins, Colorado, had more
residents than it could handle and
had to turn away two women and 11
children.

The facility has room for only
three women and 10 children. Those
turned away had to seek shelter
through a crisis center or find a
place to stay themselves.

Sex Tourism

Tourism seems like an innocent en-
ough diversion—but 'tain't necessar-
ily so according to two recent re-
ports from Third World countries.

In the Philippines, where two and a
half percent of the population con-
trol the means of production, tourism
has since 1970 been the largest dollar
earning industry. As many as 75% of
the tourists come for “pleasure” and
70% of them are male. They have
brought about an enormous increase in
bars, “hospitality girls," hostesses,
club waitresses, sauna bath attend-
ants, and prostitutes. Thousands of
women from the provinces are herded
into Manila and other urban centers
where they are exposed to systematic
exploitation and at the same time con-
tribute to the spread of venereal
disease.

Things are a little different in Thai-
land, where the tourist industry is
the third largest source of foreign
revenue—$220 million—after rice and
sugar exports. Western European
travel agencies promote the country
with brochures that subtly and some-
times openly advise male tourists to
indulge in sexual "pleasures" inex-
pensively in Bangkok, "the Mecca of
eroticism." Poverty and social dis-
organization provide a steady stream
of women to be prostitutes—currently
100,000 women in Bangkok alone. Land
reform is badly needed and the peas-
ants live in squalid conditions, most
supported mainly by what their daugh-
ters can scrape together in brothels
and massage parlors in the capital.

A Private Matter

The US Circuit Court of Appeals
in Richmond, Virginia, has ruled
that the 1974 extension of the fed-
eral minimum wage law to domestic
service employees is constitutional.
The ruling reversed the 1977 de-
cision in Marshall vs. Rose, where
the defendant took the position that
the employment of domestic service
employees was a matter of "privacy"
protected by the commerce clause of
the US Constitution.

No Snow Job

The Massachusetts Supreme Court
has ruled that a wife can sue her
husband for failing to shovel the
walk.

The court said it was time to
change the “antediluvian assumptions
concerning the role and status of
women in marriage" that led to the
development of “interspousal im-
munity"—the principle that a hus-
band and wife are legally one per-
son.

Skillet Murder

Two of three women who allegedly
murdered a Melbourne, Florida, op-
tometrist in a plot to take over his
business and hire all female em-
ployees, have been convicted of his
murder.

The prosecution alleged that Joyce
Cummings, Priscilla Bradford (the
wife of the optometrist, John Brad-
ford), and Janice Gould—with the
help of Priscilla's 14-year-old
daughter Eden, the prosecution's
"star witness"—beat Bradford to
death with an iron kitchen skillet
and a steel bottle capper in the
kitchen of his home on March 28.

Janice Gould is still awaiting
trial, Priscilla pleaded guilty,
and Cummings was convicted by a jury.

Bradford was lured into the kit-
chen on the pretext of looking at
steaks, Eden testified.

The teenager said that when she
went into the kitchen, she saw her
step-father lying in a pool of
blood with her mother hacking at him
with the bottle capper.

“I heard him. He was still mov-
ing a little bit," she testified.

Then, the young woman said, her
mother handed the capper to her,
picked up a broken frying pan and
began to hit John with the rim of
the skillet on his forehead.

Family In Danger?

If you still have any doubts that
the Right is rising in this country,
check this—last October, something
called the Family Protection Act was
introduced in Washington D.C. This
bill, Senate Bill 1808, would remove
federal funding from schools which
use textbooks that portray women in
varied roles, schools which teach
values clarification, and schools
which do not promote prayer. Why?
To "strengthen the American family,"
of course, by removing from schools
those activities which inhibit this
"strengthening process."

Reports have it that Phyllis Schaf-
lyites and their ilk are already
waging a letter writing and telephon-
ing campaign to support this bill.

Not Guilty!?!

A man who beat his wife to such an
extent that she was unconscious for
two days and spent three weeks in
the hospital, was acquitted of fel-
ony assault recently by a jury that
decided that he did not intend to
harm her.

After a seven-day trial and two
hours of deliberation, the jury of
ten men and two women found Thomas
Gilvary of Mineola, New York, not
guilty of second-degree assault.

Several jurors said the jury was
guided by the judge's instruction
that "intent" was the key factor.
Believing that Victoria Gilvary had
struck the first blow, jurors char-
acterized the beating as a domestic
squabble that got out of hand.

The jury foreman said that it
seemed that Gilvary "did it more or
less in self-defense."

One of the two women jurors said,
"In a fit of anger, people do a lot
of things. What goes on between
husband and wife should be settled
in family court, unless he has a
history of beating his wife."

Victoria Gilvary was beaten too
badly to remember the night of the
assault. But according to police,
who got their information from the
husband, the "incident" occurred
when the woman, a school teacher,
came home with a folder of papers
that she refused to let her husband
see. When the husband grabbed for
the folder, police said, she resis-
ted, scratching him in the face.
The pair fell to the floor and
struggled.

The defense attorney said the ver-
dict was “significant for all hus-
bands. Men were on trial. Here is
a woman who apparently provoked a
fight with her husband and tried to
have him convicted."

What does Victoria think of the
verdict? She said, "I learned, af-
ter being beaten nearly to death and
trying for two years, not to send him
to jail, but just to hold him ac-
countable, that there is no justice
if you're a wife. Wives are treat-
ed worse than dogs, and the master
goes on his merry way and nothing
happens."

Film Boycott

Rona Barrett recently reported
that Women Against Violence Against
Women has called for a boycott of
the film "Dressed to Kill."

Lost Cause

"We have lost an occasion to ad-
vance our cause. I am depressed,
because we feel that none of the wo-
men's issues will get real consider-
ation here. This is not a women's
conference—it is a states’ confer-
ence. And who dominates in any
case? At UN conferences, where the
argument is political, you don't
discuss your country as an individ-
ual, you represent your country's
stance and who determines that
stance? It is the parliament and
the government. It is not the wo-
men. It is the men."—Nitza Shapiro
-Libzi of Israel, addressing the UN
Conference on Women in Copenhagen,
quoted in the London Sunday Observer
of July 20.

The quote of the month comes from
soon-to-be (anything but gay) div-
orcee, Anita Bryant: "What has
happened to me makes me understand
why there are angry women who want
to pass the ERA."

Crunch Nestle

A group of more than fifty people
carrying flower draped baby coffins
and waving signs and banners, mar-
ched in front of Denver's Stouf-
fer Inn on August 23 to protest the
sickness and death of millions of
children who succumb to "baby bot-
tle disease" because of the Nestle
Company's aggressive promotion of
their breast milk substitutes.

The demonstration was organized
by the Denver Area Justice and
Peace Committee which is urging the
Denver Inn to terminate its fran-
chise with Stouffer's, a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Nestle Co.

A delegation of the demonstrators
presented an infant coffin to the
Inn's management as part of the
"Coffin Hour."

"During the hour that we are out-
side...nutritionists estimate that
1,140 babies will needlessly be-
come sick from ‘baby bottle dis-
ease,'" said Terry McCarthy, a
spokesperson for the demonstrators.

"Many of these babies will even-
tually die from infant formula mal-
nutrition. The Nestle Company is
responsible for half of the infant
formula market in areas of the
world where safe formula use is
impossible. Ignoring the World
Health Organization recommendations,
the Nestle Company continues to use
unethical and aggressive sales tac-
tics to convince mothers in devel-
oping countries to feed their bab-
ies artificial infant formula in-
stead of their own nutritious bre-
ast milk."

The international consumer boy-
cott of Nestle products is still in
effect. Denver consumers are re-
minded not to eat at the Nestle
owned Top of the Rockies Restaurant.
