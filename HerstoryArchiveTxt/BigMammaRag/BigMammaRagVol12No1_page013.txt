To Include All Women's Struggles

"culturalist perspective"
that tends to obscure differ-
ences of race and class with-
in a culture. She also point-
ed out that culture in Third
World countries has often
been defined by the upper
class and colonialism and
therefore often misrepresents
the masses of the people.
While women share specific
issues, the context from
which these issues gain
their meaning so differs
that superficial cross-cult-
ural alliances can become
divisive. The pitfalls of
taking issues out of context
were highlighted by two exam-
ples: clitoridectomy is a
crime against women that all
women react to strongly.
Nonetheless, as Nawal el Sa-
dawi (Egypt) and Cheryl John-
son (USA) pointed out, the
movement of western feminists
to abolish clitoridectomy in
Africa can be very offensive.
The assumption of clitoridectomy
as a priority issue
ignored how it fit into Afr-
ican women's lives, what pri-
ority they themselves put on
the practice. Many women re-
sented suddenly having First
World feminist allies on
this one battle while for
years their children starved
because of imperialist ex-
ploitation, with no similar
outcry. Women also objected
to the implication that sex-
ism is worse in these "barb-
aric" countries, a racist
image especially considering
that clitoridectomy has been
practiced in the US and
throughout the western world
to control women's sexuality.
The practice only diminished
when repressive ideology be-
gan to accomplish the same
ends in subtler ways. El Sa-
dawi urged US feminists to
look to their own "clitorid-
ectomies of the mind". In
the second example, Nayareh
Tohidi (Iran) described how
the veil, considered a sym-
bol of Arab women's oppres-
sion, actually became a sym-
bol of resistance against
the Shah's Westernization
programs and his prohibition
of the veil. In sum, to in-
terpret cultural practices
outside of the context of
women's total struggles
violates their experience
and can drive wedges be-
tween women involved in
progressive movements.

In approaching the term
Feminism, we quickly real-
ized that it does not have
the same meaning to all wo-
men. Isabel Letelier (Chile/
Institute for Policy Stud-
ies, Wash. DC) in her key-
note address explained how
the historical inability of
North American feminists to

consider the total exper-
ience of Latin American wo-
men has led to the associ-
ation of feminism with bour-
geois ideology. Latin Ameri-
can women activists could
never identify with femin-
ists "who would vote for
someone good on ERA, who
would also send you to war
in Central America". Angela
Gilliam (USA) recounted an
incident at the Internation-
al Conference on Women in
1974 when Domitila Barrios
de Changara, a working class
Bolivian woman stated that
she did not consider herself
a feminist nor could she id-
entify with the ruling class
women present. Betty Friedan
then accused her of being
manipulated by men and not
working on women's issues.
Gilliam criticized the "men-
are-the-enemy" version of
feminism for its refusal to
deal with divisions of race
and class and its potential
to ally with women like Marg-
aret Thatcher and Jeane Kirk-
patrick who are responsible
for the continuing oppression
of Third World women.

As Paz Buttedahl (Brazil)
said, "I have trouble with
the concept of feminism but
identify with the issues.
Conceptually we share pro-
blems but think of them dif-
ferently". The boldness of
the conference title led us
to assume that we had an un-
derstanding of the term but
the proceedings demonstrated
that we did not. I did not
find this discouraging al-
though overwhelming but viewed
the lack of consensus as
yet another warning that one
cannot transfer her own de-
finitions of feminist strug-
gle. We have much work ahead
in forging an analysis of
women's liberation, work
which requires, as Spivak
quoted "pessimism of the
intellect and optimism of
the will".

Acting with respect for the
complexity of differences
cannot be seen as a lifetime
endeavor, but rather as a

“task for generations to come.

The foremost challenge
seems to be to reconstruct a
definition of feminism that
includes all struggles for
social justice, not solely
freedom from male oppression.
Feminism must recognize cap-
italism/imperialism as the
present historical structure
that perpetuates forms of
sexism, racism, and economic
exploitation we see today.
We must be guided by the be-
lief that no woman can be
free until that structure is
abolished.

Say my name. Mess it up, but
Say it. It's who I am...
People who have lost every-
thing carry only their names.
If you despise them world-
wide, you despise me.
Call people as they wish to
be called,
Motlalepula Chabaku

The essentiality of self-
naming recurred as a theme of
the Conference, denoting the
necessity for women to define
their own issues and identi-
ties. The ability to define
ourselves and freely live
that definition lies at the
heart of human liberation.
Many women spoke to the mis-
definitions applied to them
without their input by the
Western women's movement. As
one example Winona LaDuke,
a member of the Anishinabe
tribe corrected the program
saying that she is neither
from the US or Third World,
but a member of the "Host
World”.

Rigid definitions of femi-
nism and women's issues cre-
ate a hindrance to the part-
icipation of poor women and
women of color by denying
the other struggles in their
lives. Third World women
wondered aloud whether they
would ever find white North
American feminists beside
them in the trenches as they
fought neo-colonialism or
for the right to feed their
children. For this reason
many Third World women re-

- LNS-

fuse to use the label of
feminist, feeling it ignores
a large part of their lives.
In addition, Gloria Joseph
argued that because of the
history of racism of the wo-
men's movement in the US,
"many Black women in the US
feel that it's not relevant
to their lives but their
postures are identical to
self-proclaimed feminists".
Sandra Wine-Tuttweiler (USA)
shared a powerful image of
contradictions in her dou-
ble journey as a Black woman
and a feminist in her poem
called "I Ain't the Right
Kind of Feminist". (Excerpted
from the poem):

I'm too confused...

my articulateness fails me,

I trip over the unseen.

my sexist heels are too high
-..my feminism is chasing
my Blackness over a white
sea.

my Blackness is chasing my
feminism...I ain't the right
kind of feminist

I am just a woman.

In seeking to name them-
selves, women in general
face a tremendous task in
overcoming images given us
by culture and media. This
task is compounded for women
of color. A workshop on Wo-
men in Literature and Culture
catalogued the dehumanizing
images of women we grow up
with. Maryann Oshana (USA)
ran down a list of American
