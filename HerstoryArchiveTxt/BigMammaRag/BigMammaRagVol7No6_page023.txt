enough work to get it all done. Con-  
sidering the amount of work involved  
in the paper, the number of women work-  
ing on it, it is miraculous that the  
paper can continue as it has, and is  
real testimony to the commitment of  
the women working on the paper, to  
collective struggles and to feminist  
projects.  

True, if women were paid for their  
work, BMR would be a much more viable  
paper, however BMR has politics that  
are not mainstream. It has, by defin-  
ition, a very limited readership.  
While a journalistically better quality  
paper with more complete news coverage  
is sorely needed and would bring in  
more readers and enhance the paper's  

financial status, the paper remains  
collectively run, and the paper's  
radical analysis is a deterrent to  
financial solvency. Even if no politi-  
cal content was sacrificed for finan-  
cial self-sufficiency, the means to  
that end are more than just confusing  
and seemingly out-of-reach. They are  
political issues and ones that many of  
us cannot readily embrace. Perhaps  

we could carry on pros and cons dis-  
cussions about paying women for their  
post-retreat work in a future article of  

Carol makes several statements--  
"I would like to take over the paper  
and make it a serious newspaper,"  
and later "It's not because we are a-  
fraid to take power. We could get an  
incredible amount of support from  
in the movements. I have an  
idea of how a newspaper should be run  
but I don’t know if the community  
would accept it." The last paragraph  
of the article said that "other dis-  
cussions said that maybe the paper  
should have a board of directors or an  
advisory council to help out, provide  
some expertise, have a say in deci-  
sions.  

What does this mean--an elite  
"Think Tank" of self-designated "movement leaders" to make decisions about  
the paper without sharing the work?  
Carol is not clear what she means about  

the paper, but the way  
it chills me down to my  
core. I've misread what she  

taken over by radical women in the  
last three years or so, but  
seems like you intimate, but.  

ideological struggle within  

were a $0 sharing the work  
integral part  

Old political women can have a lot  
to offer, but as women become inactive  
and arrogant about their past politi-  
cal experience, there is a new gener-  
ation of "old political people" of  
all ages out there doing the shit  
work, forming analysis, and continu-  
ing to advance the women's movement.  

BMR needs criticism, but it also  
needs help--nonabstract, nitty-gritty  
shit work help, otherwise no amount of  
ideological struggle is going to get  
it all out on paper.  

As a final word--I want to con-  
gratulate and thank the BMR collec-  

tive for the last issue--the best  
issue of the paper that I can remem-  
ber, and tell you that I see the pa-  
per getting better in many ways with  
each issue. Keep it up: I need you  
more than I could ever tell you.

Taking Ourselves  
From Page 2  

Among the factors which probably  
alienate new readers are our clar-  
ity in print. How many of our  
articles name people by their names  
or initials, and totally  

fail to provide background on met-  
ers prepared? News is  
identifying even very well  
such as "Edward"  

spent the last five years as heavily  
political feminists that Virago was  
a "collective of women who brought  
women musicians to Denver audiences  
in 1977-1978."  

Instead of using the small town  
technique of naming X, Y, and Z who  
spoke at an event, can we say the  
speakers said X, Y, and Z. Let's  
focus on ideas, not personalities.  

apathy is 2159 t qus fe ar as pos-  

Letting in a non-  
with a "bidders enough" that  
they can involve themselves.  

Information sharing techniques  
which let Apaiyidia s or small  
groups watch what's going on in  
public spheres are more intim-  
idating than those "call Joan at  
for more information" methods:  

People frequently complain that  
Denver Lesbians use political  
groups to find lovers and friends  
and build cliques. In my  
opinion this is also the result of  
not being serious. We use our org-  
anizations to meet personal needs  
and particularly to re-enforce our  
self-image and sagging egos by  
playing "most politically correct"  
and most "in" with "radicals-in-the  
know." If we were serious we  
would see that "correct theory" is  
only important to prevent mistakes  
in practice and any shades of po-  
litical correctness.  

Reducing cliques is not synon-  
ymous with reducing personal emo-  
tional support. Personal support  
is vital. Let's face it; real ex-  
pansive social change will change  
the lives of each of us. It is a  
tremendous risk and tremendously  
frightening. We are each invested  
in our present situation to some  

degree. Particularly we are white  
and middle-class so change alone is  
frightening.  

And change will not just occur  
because people finally recognize  
that it should. Change will be  
resisted by the people who get eco-  
nomic and power advantages from the  
present system. People will be  
killed, people will be hurt, people  
will be jailed, people will lose  
their jobs, people will be evicted  
from their homes, people will lose  
their children, people will be os-  
tracized and trashed. Everything  
that can be made to go wrong will  
be made to go wrong and the whole  
process will go on for many, many  
years. It is impossible to imagine  

that any one of us could survive  
this without the emotional (and  
sometimes physical and economic)  
support of our co-workers. That  
support is something we owe to all  
others engaged in the struggle and  
facing the problems, not just to  
our own lovers and close friends.  
Support is also something we owe in  

proportion to need and not in pro-  
portion to political appropriateness.  

New people are the life-blood of  
the movement. We must support them with  
patience but also recognize that  

they are not so politically advanc-  
ed as we are is easily felt by  
them and causes much more disillu-  
sionment and dropouts than mere  
personal coolness. Remember this  
is a revolution which seeks major  
change in the conditions of peo-  
ple's lives because present condi-  
tions are intolerable. Almost  
everybody suffers from those con-  
ditions to a greater or lesser de-  
gree. Their experience is valua-  
ble and should not be minimized  
because they haven't spent as many  
years reading the books written by  

other individuals who were theori-  
zing based on their own experience.  

Consciousness Raising is shared  
experience. It helps us sort out  
what is unique to our own experi-  
ence and what arises from our sit-  
uation as women, as members of an  
economic class, as participants-  
victims of a culture which is ra-  
cist, sexist, and based on providing  
profit for owners of natural  
resources and manufacturing facili-  

ties.  

Being serious about ourselves  
will also help reduce racism in  
our movement and make it relevant  
to women of different backgrounds.  
At this time the major involvement  
of many women is attending a con-  
cert or going to the bars. Cul-  
tural events are necessary and of  

serious value both in their own right as  
the beautiful products of forth-  
while people and as part of a sup-  
port system recognizing human needs.  
It is not a means to social need.  
When we seriously engage in activi-  
ties aimed at radical change, the  
to Black and Chicana wo-  
men will be clear and we will  
work together instead of beating our  
breasts about whether our cultural  
and social activities are integrated  
which, of course, they are not and  
will not be so long as they are  
only a part of a closed, selfish  
"alternative" to help white middle-  
class women endure our world rather  

than change it.  

This letter is long too long  
so I invite each reader to  

submit responses to significant social  

change.

Insanity  
From Page 2  

After I came out, my lover exposed  
me to literature and politics.  
I became radicalized quickly and progress-  
ively committed. At the same time, I  

became aware of the fact that my poli-  

tics were not given support anywhere  
with a few exceptions. There was no  
support among the lesbians and need-  

less to say none within any of the lo-  

cal women's organizations. I didn't  
expect it, but what I did expect was  
some enthusiasm for the fight and  
struggle for women's civil rights.  
What I encountered was a severe lack  

of interest on the part of the entire  

women's community including the les-  
bian community. I began to question  
my politics daily.  
I am still a lesbian (there's no going  

back) and a confirmed separatist (not  

only in my personal, day-to-day en-  

counters, but as one of the most use-  

ful tools of the movement.  
I too, desperately hope the 80's  

will show a resurgence of spirit that  

the 60's displayed (bearing in mind  
that the women's involvement at the  
time was horribly taken advantage of  

by egotistical men playing hero games).  
I have been concerned and somewhat  

disheartened by the diminishing in-  
terest in radical ideas within the  
movement.  
and in light of some of the other  
movements around (survival) some of  
us are confused as to where to put  
what energy we do have into.  

As a lesbian my energy goes first  
to myself, my lesbian sisters second  
and women in general third (I tried  
not discriminating and including all  
women at one time, but got burned  
and drained and decided that my les-  
bian sisters were in more dire need  
of energy than my straight sisters).  
A feminist analysis, especially the  
most radical kind, puts the world as  
it is (patriarchally fucked up) into  
perspective.  

Personally, I feel the need to fre-  

quently climb aboard my soapbox and  

expound the lesbian feminist perspec-  

tive to all women, because they are  
not likely to run across it anywhere  
anytime soon. My point is to make  
information available to all women,  

information that expounds, what inti-  

ally probably sounds like an absurd  
explanation for the condition of the  
world.  

to listen to the politics of Lesbian  

Nation, and decide for themselves con-  
cerning the reasonableness of the poli-  

tics.  

I know women are burnt out. I  
probably will be at some time in my  
life as well.  
By sharing points through newspapers (remember  
the rallies?) and discussion groups, we  
increase the likelihood of other sis-  
ters filling in for us temporarily  
while we recover from the strains and  
pressures of dealing with the  
pigocracy.

Radical lesbians need to keep  
their zest and zeal because there are  
so many women who owe it to themselves

Criticism

to "put in time" as is done in other  
jobs. We simply did what needed to  
be done at any given time and then  
went on to other things. Many of us  
used the flexibility and freedom af-  
forded by the CETA funding to work on  
other projects in the women's commun-  
ity. My perception of the criticism  
being presented on this issue is that  
the same women are criticizing us for  
taking the man's money and then for  
not playing the game by the man's  
rules. A double bind indeed.  

I encourage women who still have  
questions about Virago or issues  
they would like to discuss to write  

letters to BMR or contact me through  
Woman to Woman in the fall.

the local Advocates for Victims of  
Sexual Assault here. The team is  
organized by the Larimer County  
Mental Health Center and is a county-  
wide service. I feel it has the po-  
tential for being helpful and sup-  
portive of women who are raped. I  
would like to prevent rape from ever  
happening though. That sometimes  
seems like such an immense task  
which can only be accomplished by  
overthrowing the whole of patriarch-  
al attitudes toward women. But per-  
haps we can start by patrolling our  
own neighborhoods and confronting  
known rapists.

Homebirth  
From Page 14  

love and joy for this new little  
person, and so amazed at the whole  
birth.  

The reason I decided on homebirth  
was, I wanted my child to come out  
to a peaceful, loving space instead  
of a cold, impersonal delivery room.  
I feel that a good start in life  
could only help.  

If you, or someone you know, is  
considering a homebirth, the people  
to contact in this area are:

Nuclear Family  
From Page 11  

As soon as all of you are on your own,  
your mom and I won't be together."  

It is an understatement that the  
family was not serving the needs of  
my mother or the children, yet it  
held together out of the false "sec-  
urity" that marriage and children is  
the only viable lifestyle for people  
to relate. Once we start asking in  
whose interest does the existing fam-  
ily model serve, we get some answers  
as to why the “crime” of the physical  
abuse of children is inherently a  
potential in any nuclear family, and  
that the perpetuation of this family  
unit is the real crime.
