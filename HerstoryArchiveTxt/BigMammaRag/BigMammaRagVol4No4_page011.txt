Housework . . .

From Page 6

IS NO reason to assume that
women will be willing to
organize once we have the wage
any more than before it.

The object of further action
and organizing by waged house-
workers, WFH contends, is to
send all housework and to topple
the capitalist system which it
sees as the only user of the
commodity of labor reproduc-
tion. The WFH movement's
economic analysis relies heavily
upon the sins of capitalism for its
jumping off place and may find
its doom in the same dependen-
cy, just as the left did in depen-
ding on capital for its definition
of labor. While many of the WFH
points are unquestionably valid,
there is no support for the
assumption that these same
conditions do not and will not
exist under a socialist state.

To destroy the ruling class is
not to destroy all work. House-
work must be done in any
socio-economic order. How will
this change when capitalism is
destroyed and what is to assure
that women alone will not still do
it? In 1960, women wrote in a
Russian newspaper that they
were equal in the workplace but
still had to do all the work in the
home. Currently, Russia is
pushing women back into the
home owing to the child care

tremendous feeling that we
must get together as sisters on a
social scale. And, of course, they
begin to love one another, too,
because they have just found
one another again. Right? It
follows from it.

BMR: Why wouldn't you call for
a matriarchal society as the
solution to the problem? I know
that you identify yourself as a
socialist and call for that kind of

ER: We are not going back to the
matriarchal period because that
was a primitive period. For all the
magnificent things the women
did, I am not for going backward
to a primitive, unenlightened
economy — they didn't have any
science in those days — but
going forward to a new kind of
egalitarian society whose name
is socialism in which both sexes
will be free and equal. This
means, of course, getting rid of
male supremacy, but when you
get rid of capitalism, you auto-
matically get rid of male sup-
remacy. Well, I shouldn't say
automatically because we are
going to have to be very vigilant
in the transitional period to make
sure that none of our gains are
lost as women. We can see what
happened in those Stalinized
countries, the Soviet Union and
Mao’s Stalinist bureaucracy,
where the women still are the
second sex. But, these are not
socialist countries. They are just
workers' states, which is good,
but not good enough.

Now the question of sex su-
periority and inferiority from the
biological standpoint. Notice I
have been very reluctant to deal
with it on that level. It seems to
me a level that impedes scienti-
fic viewpoint, it’s so subjective.
But, the evidence speaks for it-
self, doesn’t it? That women,
who have been trained to be-
lieve for centuries that they are
the second sex, the handicapped
sex, that they are stunted in
mind and body, are suddenly dis-
covering that they are really a
superior sex. Right? And that’s
very good. They have a million
years of heroic accomplish-
ments and can do it again. But
that means that they have to join
the social structure that will
change society. It's incumbent
upon them to do that.

BMR: Now I'm going to play
devil's advocate. Isn’t that what
women did before, when they
educated the men and invited
them into their social order?
Wasn't that when we started to
get the shift to patriarchy?

situation in its nurseries; it
seems the USSR, too, is ex-
periencing a ‘crisis in the fami-
ly”.

The Society for Anglo-Chinese
Understanding, upon visiting
China in 1970, noted that, al-
though women do new jobs,
child care is still carried on
predominantly by women.

Cuba is not exploring any new
family forms and women are still
responsible for the housework.
When women’s labor is needed,
the state takes over child care,
not the men, for it is the state, in
Cuba, too, who needs the labor.

Moreover, if the wage is to be
paid to all women, as WFH pro-
poses, will this not strengthen
the class differences since upper
class women, who already have
more, will be paid as well as
lower class women?

Perhaps WFH needs a more
thorough program to assure that
we do not settle for the wage,
seeing it as utopia, nor build in
our own defeat by making the
program dependent upon capital
as the villain, when there is so
much further to go. Yet it may be
too forward a step to be given up,
for as Boo Watson wrote in her
song, Too Many More Women,
“When the pain eases up I
remember there’s a thousand
more houses like mine, and in-
side every one there’s a woman
like me without any money or
time.”

ER: No. You are missing the
social forces that transcend the
sexual problems. As I told you,
society had to progress from that
primitive economy. In order to
accomplish their needs for sur-
vival they had to create the
sisterhood and brotherhood. We
will have to go back someday to a
sisterhood, brotherhood re-
lationship, whatever our sexual
proclivities are. Socially we will
all have to be sisters and
brothers, assuming both sexes
remain on earth, which is not a
foregone question either.

On the question of men, most
men feel threatened by the
women’s movement and value
they possess. This blinds them to
the fact that they are oppressed
and exploited also, though not as
much as women. But there are
many men who are willing and
eager to become allies with
women, and I, for one, know
several who call themselves
male feminists. We are going to
need that alliance for the re-
volution. We need men, all work-
ing people, to get together on the
question of social change, then
men will decide for themselves
what sexual changes they wish
to introduce — whether they re-
main the same or whether they
change. But, we've got to have
the social change and we also
have to educate those men who
are still blinded by the present
conditioning they are in. It’s part
of our obligation in order to ef-
fect the revolutionary solution.

BMBR: I think one of the big con-
troversies between socialists
and feminists has been on the
question of unity. Many femin-
ists say, “Yes, I am a socialist. I
want to have these economic
changes, but right now, as my
way of educating men, I have to
go on strike against them. I have
to let them know they are hurt-
ing me, and the only way I can
make my point is to walk away
from them.” Yet, socialists are
saying, “We can’t afford to do
this. We have to maintain a
unified approach.”

ER: Yes, we can afford to do it.
You know, sometimes when you
are educating people, and we
are going to have to educate a lot
of men, sometimes you have to
use a little forceful methods, or
even retreat to teach them a
lesson. Right? On the other
hand, we have to educate them
because it is absolutely neces-
sary for the unity to take place on
the basis of the class struggle,
the social struggle. There are
enough men who are exploited,
impoverished and beaten down
who will be willing to do that;
and in the course of that they will
also learn the value of women if
we come forward in that strug-
gle. And we play a very big role in

Grants — How ..

ments. Mention similar projects
elsewhere. Also, know every-
thing you possibly can about
your field; research is vital to es-
tablishing credibility. Account-
ability is also advisable. You
should be in communication
with other projects in the com-
munity who have programs and
goals similar or related to yours
and should mention these con-
tacts in this section of your pro-
posal. You might even want to
set up an advisory board to work
closely with your group made of
persons from these organiza-
tions. Another important way for
your organization to establish
credibility might be to have an
accountant and/or lawyer. If you
use the services of such per-
sons, mention them in this part
of your proposal. And lastly, the
most important thing to remem-
ber is that the proposal is your
chance to make a favorable ap-
pearance. The purpose of this
beginning section of your pro-
posal is to establish yourselves
as a credible project!

The next thing you want to do
in your proposal is define exactly
what the need of your consti-
tuency is and educate the foun-
dation as to the need. Next, tell
the foundation what your
organization's solution of this
need is. Make sure your solu-
tion is clear, understandable and
feasible. Do not indicate in this
section of your proposal exactly
what your project's program is.

Next, describe your program
objectives. Here is where you tell
the foundation exactly what your
program is. Tell the foundation
what your methods and plans
are and explain how these will
affect the need you earlier des-
cribed. Make sure you don't
knock other projects with similar
programs. This will come across
as a “holier than thou” attitude
to the foundation. Don’t des-
cribe goals for your project that
could not possibly be feasible for
you to carry through. In other
words, don't tell the foundation
that you intend to provide free
abortions for any woman in Los
Angeles who wants one if what
you intend to do is provide inex-
pensive abortions for no more
than 100 women per month.
Lastly, don’t try and impress the
foundation with your innova-
tiveness because they are most
concerned with your effective-

ness.
Documentation

In the next section of your pro-
posal, tell the foundation how
your project will be documented
and assessed at the year's end.
Unfortunately for a great many
feminist projects, no foundation
wants to fund a project that will
not be accountable to the foun-
dation. Foundations need to
know (or think) that their money
will be well spent. They also
want to know how records will
be kept, if and how any monitor-
ing will be done (establish ways
in which you will be account-
able for accomplishing all the
things your project sets out to do)
and about any timetables you set
up for yourselves (schedules you
plan to adhere to for getting cer-
tain things done at specific
times).
Survival
The next part of the proposal
should contain a section on the
project's long-range plans for
survival. What will you do when
your grant monies run out? Do you plan to be self-
sufficient at that time? Do you
plan to seek other funding? Let
the foundation know. No foun-
dation wants (or at least claims it
doesn't want) to fund some-
thing that will collapse when its
grant money runs out. (See Fund-
ing article on page for
further discussion of this point).

The final part of your proposal
should contain a proposal
budget for the year. Here list all
the expenditures you plan to be
making the following year in-
corporating the sum you have
asked for in your proposal into
the budget. 75% of your total
operating costs should be shown
as going toward salaries. (Found-
ations are not fond of funding
“volunteer” projects. Paying
salaries establishes credibility).
It is a good idea to define exactly
what the responsibilities of the
salaried persons will be (do this
in the section where you des-
cribe your program objectives).

After you have completed your
proposal write a summary that
briefly capsulizes all parts of
your proposal. Make your sum-
mary concise and interesting,
and keep it to about ½ page in
length. You might want to put
your summary at the beginning
of the proposal so that the
person reading your proposal
can get a taste of what the pro-
ject is all about before reading
the entire proposal. Often pro-
posal readers will skip to the
back and read the summary first,
anyway if it is to be found there.
Lastly, put a complete table
of contents in your proposal.

The final thing to remember in
your attempt to receive funding
is to keep a complete file on all
your funding work. All research
on foundations should be kept.
Any correspondences between
the project and the foundations
should be kept. Files should be
kept on contacts, proposals
written, and any follow-up on
the part of foundations.

A SOCIETY OF THE
long development of matriar-
chy. You might remember that
the matriarchy didn't begin as a
full blown matriarchy. The very
condition of life grew up into
that, into its great tribal struc-
ture. At the end it's a whole
evolutionary process. In the un-
even development of society
some areas came first, but what
I am trying to show is that whole
line of development. Two major
changes have occurred — the
first one when we left the animal
world, the second when we left
the matriarchal world. The third
is today when we are going to
leave the capitalist world.

Colorado Credit Union Opens Its Doors

Excerpted from CFFCU Newsletter

Feminists in Denver, Colorado
Springs, Ft. Collins and Boulder
are currently organizing a Colo-
rado Feminist Federal Credit
Union (CFFCU), that would serve
all members of local feminist
organizations, with a particular
outreach emphasis for poor
and minority women.

For those who wonder exactly
what credit unions are, they can
be defined as self-help, non-
profit, financial institutions,
owned and operated by the
people within their member-
ship. The Credit Union move-
ment began in Germany in 1849
and developed in the U.S. during
the 1930s when people with a
common bond found it neces-
sary to pool their savings in order
to grant loans to each other.
Credit unions are organized for
people, not for profit. Members
elect their own directors and
vote on policies — one member,
one vote, regardless of the
amount of savings you have in
the credit union.

Advantages

The CFFCU, in its original
communique, listed the follow-
ing advantages of a feminist
credit union:

— A feminist credit union is a
way of pooling women's re-
sources, so that women who are
saving money can lend that
money to women who need to
borrow it.

— We can invest our savings
in loans to our sisters, instead of
in male-owned and controlled
banking institutions with sexist
lending policies and employ-
ment practices.

— We can borrow where we
are not discriminated against
because of marital status or
sexual preference or the credit
rating of husband or father.

— With women we can be
honest about why we want a
loan — whether it be for a di-
vorce, an abortion, a business
venture, a vacation, or to pay off
old bills.

The Colorado Feminist Federal
Credit Union officially opened in
March. On December 13, mem-
bers of the Board of Directors,
the Credit Committee and the
Supervisory Committee met
with a representative from the
Colorado Credit Union League to
fill out the necessary forms for
submitting its charter to the Na-
tional Credit Union Administra-
tion. Since then CFFCU has been
contacted by other groups who
are interested in being in the
field of membership. Collecting
by-laws and financial state-
ments from the remaining
groups has held up the charter-
ing procedure which usually
takes from 4 to 8 weeks. At this
point, CFFCU’s field of member-
ship includes groups from
Denver, Colorado Springs, Fort
Collins and Boulder.

CFFCU's priority right now is
on getting the Denver office on
its feet. It hopes eventually to
begin branching out. The group
is looking for liaisons around the
state to set up service centers.
For instance, they are hoping to
have someone in Colorado
Springs two days a week to
interview loan applicants. This
will be in addition to individual
members doing business with
CFFCU through the mail. If
you're interested in setting up a
service center in your area and
have a specific amount of time to
commit, contact Jackie St. Joan,
1558 Detroit St. #1, Denver,
80206.

Location

CFFCU's office is located at
1458 Pennsylvania, Rooms 11
and 12 upstairs, just ½ block
south of Colfax. It is important to
keep operating costs low so
that as much of the credit
union's income as possible can
be returned to members in the
form of dividends and services,
consequently, anything you
could donate to the office would
