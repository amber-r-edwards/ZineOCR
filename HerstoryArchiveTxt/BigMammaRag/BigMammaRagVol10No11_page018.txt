The Consumer's Association of
Penang, Malaysia is pleased

to inform you of their new
publication “Abuse of Women
in the Media,” a 90-page book
(5 x 7½ inches) with photo-
graphs. This book traces how
the media has been used to
portray women as inferior be-
ings and as sex objects in

the areas of advertising, por-
nography, sex tourism, wo-
men's magazines, paperback ro-
mances, in humor, in TV and
films, and in the newspaper
coverage of women. We believe
that this is one of the first
books from a developing coun-
try which deals with the prob-
lems of women both in Malay-
sia and in the Third World.
