In the winter of 1979, Robin
Ruth Linden produced video-
tapes (3/4", color, 2 camera)
of 2 symposia, "Feminism and
the Philosophy of Science" &
"Women and Scientific Research"
at the American Association

for the Advancement of Science
meetings. 12 lesbian-feminist
scholars and activists parti-
cipated. "The issues (medical
experimentation, racism,
clear holocaust, etc.) are
compelling and timely," Lin-
den writes. "The tapes, them-
selves, even in rough assembly
are exciting. Because of
changed personal circumstances
however, I am now unable to
continue...I am seeking a
qualified individual or group
to...turn over the project,
including master videotapes,
transcripts, files, etc."
