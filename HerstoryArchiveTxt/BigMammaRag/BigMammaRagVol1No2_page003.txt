WRITE WOMEN BACK

"From the dawn of civil-
ization women have made
important contributions
to society. And, under

the heel of oppression,

women have struggled for
freedom. In asserting
the right of women, we
reclaim our heritage...
Write women back into
history."

A proud and angry statement
that makes you want to run out
and discover your past, isn't
it? It is from a series of
posters of famous women in his-
tory that the Young Socialist
Alliance is producing. I have
put up in my study the intro-
ductory statement and four of
the posters, for inspiration.

Much as I like this series,
however, I sometimes have
trouble with the second state-
ment. First, it tends to mis-
lead us into thinking of women's
history as always, everywhere
the same: women's history e-
quals oppression. Second, we
have to be careful in looking
for antecedents to our own
struggle. Women's "struggle for
freedom" did not occur as fre-
quently nor in all the places
one might expect.

For example, the history of
17th and early 18th century wo-
men, particularly the Protestant
women of English descent, should
be approached on its own terms.
If it is forced into the 19th
and 20th century categories of
oppression and liberation, we
only confuse ourselves.

Let us look at the 17th and
early 18th century women. What
exactly would oppression have
meant for these colonial women?
Certainly the attitudes ex-
pressed by literate men about
women left something to be de-
sired. Woman, according to a
very long tradition, was a weak
creature. She was, first, men-
tally weak. Overtaking her
brain by excessive reading and
writing might well unhinge her
mind. This was a pity, but, of
course, she couldn't be blamed
for her inferiority. But there
was a second kind of female
weakness which the early colon-
ial men found positively dis-
concerting. Woman was the
daughter of Eve, and she in-
herited her mother's moral weak-
ness. Worse, like Eve, she had
a seductive power that could
pull men down with her. Al-
though this image of woman as
“the dangerous sex" was usually
latent, it occasionally sur-
faced as it did in the Salem
witch trials. It was because
of these weaknesses, finally,
that woman was subordinate,
subordinate to her father in
childhood and later to her hus-
band in marriage.

But what did all this intel-
lectualizing actually mean in
the lives of colonial women?

INTO HISTORY

To begin with, the average co-
lonial woman was not well edu-
cated. Most girls who were
educated at all were taught the
rudiments at home or in the sum-
mer sessions of the public
schools if they existed. Even
in Massachusetts, a colony with
a considerable concern for edu-
cation, only 50% of the women
could sign their own names in
the mid 17th century. But how
significant was this depriva-
tion in a society in which edu-
cation was not necessary for
survival and in which most men
were equally deprived? Lack of
educational opportunities did
not mean to the colonial woman
what it would mean to us.

Under English common law in
which woman was declared civil-
ly dead at marriage, woman's
legal status looks oppressive.
However, in America, the harsh-
ness of English law was modi-
fied by Equity law: if a woman
came into a marriage with con-
siderable property of her own

her father would make out a
contract to protect her right
to this property. The law as
practiced protected her rights
in her husband's property. Di-
vorce was permitted when either
party to a marriage could prove
that the other had neglected a
fundamental duty.

The fact that English law
was modified in the American
colonies is significant. Wo-
men were in short supply in
the early period. Companies
who invested in a colony real-
ized how important the pre-
sence of women was to the cre-
ation of a permanent colony
and made efforts to induce wo-
men into coming to the New
World. The London Co. which
underwrote the Virginia colony
advertised for “Agreeable per-
sons, young and incorrupt...
(who would be) sold with their
own consent to settlers as
wives, the price to be the
cost of their own transporta-
tion." Apparently women
found this offer very attrac-
tive. In 1619 ninety came on
one ship alone. Historians
have speculated that it was in
part this demand for women that
made women's place in colonial
American society much better
than that of their sisters who
remained in the Mother Country.

But even if they had been in
good supply, the work of the
early colonial women, even wo-
men of the wealthier classes,
made them absolutely indispen-
sable. From earliest childhood
when a girl began doing house-
hold and barnyard chores the
female was a useful and pro-
ductive member of her family.
In her early to mid-twenties,
she married and bore on the
average nine to ten children.
Childbearing was hard and the
mother's life expectancy was
7 years less than her husband's.
Two or three of those children
died before they were adults.
Aside from childbearing and
rearing, she was in charge of
the home. It was not the con-
suming home of the 19th century
but the producing home, a small
manufacturing unit which turned
raw materials that the husband
produced—grains, flax, leather,
meat—into usable products.

The woman and her daughter made
all the cloth for the family,
turned the cloth into clothing,
did all the brewing, baking,
and curing of meat. They made
wax and the only form of light-
ing, candles; they made the
family soap out of drippings
and lye, the lye from ashes.
The woman had charge of the fam-
ily garden and of the family
doctoring. It was an extremely
difficult life but through her
work she had the self-respect
and the community respect that
