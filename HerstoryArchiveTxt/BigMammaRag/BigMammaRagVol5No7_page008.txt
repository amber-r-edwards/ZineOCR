Editor's Note:

As a special feature pullout section,  
Big Mama Rag offers a listing of re-  
sources available to women in the  
Denver/Boulder area. It is our hope  
that this directory will prove valu-  
able to local women - all of whom have  
a variety of needs and interests. We  
also hope it will be interesting to  
women who are considering moving here  
or are simply curious about the goings  

on in other feminist communities.

The main focus of this directory  
was to be useful and complete;  
hence the lack of graphics. We tried  
to contact all the groups through  

letter, phone, or in person. If we  
have missed an area feminist project  
or good agency serving women (which  
we probably have), we hope you forgive  
us and let us know about your organi-  
zation.

Women’s Hot Lines

THE WOMEN'S LINE  
UMC, C.U., Boulder  
492-8910

The Women's Line is a rapline for  
women from noon through the night to  
6 A.M. daily. Call 492-8910. The all  
women volunteers who staff the rapline  
will do “telephone counseling," offer-  
ing crisis intervention, help with  
decision-making, and information on  
birth control and other problems. They  
will give referrals to Denver-Boulder  
resources for women. All conversations  
are confidential.

This telephone line is funded by a  
yearly grant of $1500 from the C.U.  
student body in Boulder. All of the  
staff are volunteers and all major  
decisions are made by consensus, al-  
though there are two co-directors:  
Patrice Inglis and Randi Gardner.

The staff is trained in a 16-week  
course in crisis intervention counsel-  
ing for women.

In explaining their politics, the  
Women's Line says, "Our goal is to  
be a stronger, positive force in the  
women's community, to lend support to  
individual women and to be a contact  
(referral agency) for other women's  
organizations, helping to coordinate  
different women's efforts.

"We try to serve any and all women  
who call us. As individuals, it's safe  
to say we are all feminists, though not  
all are politically oriented. Although  
our counseling methods are quite def-  
initely non-directive and we will try  
to help a woman find whatever sort of  
service/help/information she seeks,  
we are tuned to resources of a femi-  
nist persuasion and will raise femin-  
ist issues if they are relevant to a  
counseling conversation. We believe  
that lending support to women, person-  
ally, especially those who are strug-  
gling to be free of personal and  
social limitations that they encounter  
by virtue of being female, cannot  
but be feminist."

One major change in policy during  
the past year is that they no longer  
do any long-term counseling. They  
accept only one or two calls regarding  
one woman's present needs with possi-  
ble follow-up for referrals.

The volunteers are not therapists.  
They are trained to help women help  
themselves, to ask the right questions  
so that a caller can find the answers  
herself. If therapy is indicated, they  
will refer the caller to a qualified  
therapist.

WOMAN TO WOMAN FEMINIST SWITCHBOARD  
2023 E. Colfax, Denver  
320-5972

This rapline for women is open from  
10 A.M. to 8 P.M. Monday to Saturday.

The volunteer staffers at the  
feminist book center give "peer counsel-  
ing" over the phone. They refer women  
to resources in the Denver-Boulder  
area to help with legal, emotional,  
and physical problems. They refer  
women to women's groups, child care,  
and resources for women who have been  
battered or raped or whatever.

This hot line gives a feminist per-  
spective to your problems and has  
access to information on all local re-  
sources.

There is always a need for volunteer  
staffers and women who know of good  
resources should call and let them  
know about them.

Marie Mendoza 399-7015

Hembra is a feminist Chicana organ-  
ization concerned with giving psycho-  
logical, social, and job support to  
Chicana women. Currently, we are rais-  
ing money for a resource center, which  
will enable us to offer more services  
to our community. We also offer edu-  
cational and training programs at  
various times throughout the year.

Hembra meets every third Tuesday

tees which work on separate tasks.  
There are elected officers and a Board  
of Directors consisting of two chair-  
persons, Secretary, Treasurer, and  
liaisons of the various committees.

As regards their politics, a member  
of Hembra says, “We are an advocacy  
group for Chicanas. We deal with  
issues and concerns that affect us. As  
a feminist organization, we support in-  
dividual growth and self-development.  
We support the ERA and the right of  
all women to choose their own life  
style. We have also given support in  
our activities to other women's groups.

Women’s Groups

THE FEMINIST SOCIALIST GROUP  
447-2425 Susie  
449-8092 Jeannie

The Feminist Socialist group meets  
weekly in women's apartments as a  
study/action group. The group's  
dual function includes reading and  
studying feminist works and carrying  
out actions that touch on issues of  
importance to women. These actions  
often take the form of guerilla thea-  
tre. The group's philosophy is that  
their actions and their theatre  
should grow out of their own lives.

Some of the current activities of  
the Denver area chapters are the redec-  
orating of two rooms in the Brandon  
House, a home for battered women; the  
sponsorship of an ERA walkathon in  
Boulder; the establishment of an  
extensive CR program; and a Speakout  
on Women's Rights and a dance on

Colorado has several working task  
forces which provide many varied ser-  
vices for women and which also pro-  
vide education and training for NOW  
members and the general public.

There is a CR task force; a Media  
Reform task force is trying to promote  
better programming which is not as sex-  
ist and also to integrate more women  
into policy-making decisions in the  
media. There is also a task force on  
Legislation which promotes legislation  
of concern to women. The Labor task  
force recently produced a brochure on  
how to organize into a union. The  
Violence Against Women task force  
has been active in educating people  
and setting up a Colorado Association  
for Aid to Battered Women.

The NOW Rural Women's task force  
will use the NOW State Newsletter to  
end the isolation felt by rural women  
in Colorado. There is a State Newsletter  
task force. The task force on Prosti-  
tution promotes the decriminalization  
of prostitution. The task force on  
Education monitors compliance of Title  
IX for equal opportunity in education.  
The task force on Lesbianism is trying  
to educate other NOW members, pass  
a national gay rights bill, develop a  
referral package for newcomers to  
Denver, and is considering publishing  
a list of convicted rapists in the  
Denver area.
