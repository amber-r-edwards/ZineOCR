Board Fires Staff, Restructures Program

down to a choice between com-
promise of the feminist princ-
iples or a loss of funding.
And so, structures of power
and authority change to suit
the values of the funding
sources. The staff becomes
increasingly “professional”
--the focus changes from women
helping each other, sharing
skills and support, to one
highly-educated, highly paid
group, making decisions that
wield control over the lives
of the battered women. And,
of course, there is a board
of directors who control the
money, the hiring, the struct-
ure, and the efforts of both
the staff and the residents.
In the case of the Denver Safe
House, elimination of the cri-
sis phone line and the commun-
ity education program, is a-
nother significant compromise
of feminism.

The problem of battering is
a product of a society where
women do not have control ov-

er their bodies and their
lives. The concept of safe
houses is a good one--women
need to help each other re-
gain that control in the con-
crete ways of exchanging emo-
tional support (developing
stronger self-images), and
learning survival skills (in
the areas of jobs, food,
housing, education, etc.).
Women need to have the option
to leave a situation that is
destructive and dangerous,
and the space to change their
self-images from victim to
independent.

In trying to create a struc-
ture through which to work
toward this, we need to keep
our long-term feminist goals
in mind every step of the
way. Shelters are important
to women's survival in this
world--we need certain chang-
es in our lives now. But
the ultimate goal of a fem-
inist project still must be

Well, this is the second month using our new layout style,
in spite of some problems in moving from our old format
we find that our layout time during production
is much easier. Though no one has written us, we have
heard through the grapevine that the paper is easier to read
and looks nicer too.
Aside from dealing with the "looks" of the paper, we are
still in struggle over our process and goals - within collect-
ive meetings - within our monthly supporters meeting i
our most active supporters (Vicki, Connie, Judy, and Bobbe
and (hopefully) with our local community, at our community
meeting coming up April 4th. This struggle seems presently
focused on the maintenance of the paper and our work with wo-
men in the Denver community; and in finding a balance in what
we cover and why, i.e. local and lesbian community issues vs.
national and international issues and in maintaining a radi-
cal feminist analysis and focus on women and yet making con-
nections between the oppression of women and all others.

to change the structure of 
power in the larger society--
to work toward eliminating

a structure where one group
has the privilege and power
to control the lives of oth-
ers. This is where the prob-
lem of battering comes from
to begin with.

We must reject a hierarch-
ical structure of power in
projects such as Safe House.
"Middle of the road, commun-
ity leaders, and business
people" cannot be trusted to
make good decisions concern-
ing the lives of battered

women. Relationships based
on equality and mutual res-
pect--women supporting women--
need to remain a priority

in the structuring of shelt-
ers. We are going to have to
find money from our own comm-
unity, money without strings
(most of the $100,000 raised
by the staff of Safe House
came in small donations from
individuals). In order to
make long-term change, we
need to take the control of
projects like Safe House back
into the hands of the women
whose lives are involved.

Woman To Woman Vandalized

Denver's feminist bookstore,
Woman to Woman, was vandalized
on the night of March 14. One
panel of the back door was
broken, allowing the vandal(s)
to unlock it and enter. All
the cash was taken (perhaps
$50) and checks were taken
and scattered in the back al-
ley, where they were retriev-
ed the next day by Woman to
Woman staffers. The stereo
was taken along with many re-
cords and T-shirts. Posters
were thrown into the dumpster
outside where they also were
retrieved.

Though the identity of the
vandals is unknown, there was
one other recent incident
which may be connected to the
robbery. On Friday, March 13,
a sign was taped on the front
window of the bookstore with
the words "Us Men Have Rights
Too." So, it is probable that

the incident was maliciously
intended.

Woman to Woman can't col-
lect insurance for the losses
because there is no burglar
alarm. Plans for preventing
further break-ins include buy-
ing a separate barred door for
the back, putting sheet metal
on both sides of the door, and
buying new locks. Discussion
of the possibility of relocat-
ing has also been reopened.

Woman to Woman has suffered
significant financial losses,
although staffers acknowledge
that the damage could have
been much worse. To recover
from the losses, and to make
changes that will cut down
risk of future problems, mon-
ey will be needed. Tax deduct-
