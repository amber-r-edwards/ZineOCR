Working Women...

Women were laid off, along with other
women in outside craft jobs, despite
the fact Mountain Bell had just been
granted a $28 million rate hike,

and was requesting $40 million more
under the guise of “emergency relief"
to prevent lay-offs.

The installer's union, the Communi-
cation Workers of America, refused to
file grievances on behalf of the
women, citing the seniority system as
justification and that the 'gentle-
men's agreement’ between the EEOC
and AT&T was not intended to affect
seniority provisions.

Karen said the lay-offs, although
were done according to seniority,
perpetuated past discrimination when
applied to their situation since
women were not hired into craft posi-
tions before 1973. She said that the
installers were not asking that men
with more seniority be laid off while
the women continued to work. Instead,
AT&T, which makes more profits than
any other U.S. corporation, should
bear the financial burden for their
past sex discrimination - not the
workers.

(Mountain Bell only gained about
$30,000 by demoting the installers.
In comparison, it cost them $162,000
just to prepare its side of the rate
increase request.)

Karen said the women have been do-
ing all they can to fight back. Early
in 1975 the Women Installers Legal
Defense Fund filed sex discrimination
charges with the EEOC; they filed a
grievance with the National Labor
Relations Board against the CWA;
and on March 8, 1976, they filed suit
in federal court against Mountain
Bell. To help in their federal case
the installers are asking any woman
who applied for, but was denied, non-
traditional work at Mountain Bell
before January 1973, to get in touch
with them through Better Jobs for
Women.

Learning By Experience

The second half of the workshop was
a combined discussion of the job re-
alities of small shop workers along
with the mechanics for organizing a
union. As groundwork for this, two
women, Kathy Pantzer and Sue Goding,
shared their experiences working for
Bettaway Foods, a meat packing plant.

When Kathy went to work for Betta-
way in March of 1976, there were 13
employees - 8 women and five men -
with three of the men working the
night shift. Kathy, like the other
women, started out making $2.35 an
hour for a job that required her to
work along an assembly line catching
chicken fried steaks, meat loaf, etc.

with her bare hands as they came out

of boiling grease, placing the meat on
trays which were then put in freezers
and finally packed into boxes for
sale to institutions. Sue and Kathy
said that their hands were frequently
burned from catching the meat. The
company refused for a long time to
get them gloves, claiming the expense
would be too great. When gloves were
finally provided, they melted from
the heat of the greasy meat.

Kathy said after working there for
three days she realized there was
discrimination going on against the
women employees. She said the job
descriptions enabled the men to make
$1.00 more per hour than the women,
although their work was basically the
same. The company justified the wage
difference by saying the women weren't
strong enough to lift the 100-pound
sacks of flour that the men were
required to lift. In actuality, the

men lifted the flour sacks together
in pairs, and one of the women was
occasionally asked to help. The
company also said the men knew how
to work on the machinery and the
women didn't, when in fact, none of
the men knew how to work on the
machinery until the company trained
them. Irritating discrepancies showed
up in a number of other ways. For
instance, only the women were requir-
ed to wear hair nets although most
of the men had longer hair than most
of the women.

Sue said most of the Bettaway
employees were dissatisfied because
of low pay, unsafe working conditions:
a gas oven that often leaked, a meat
slicer that was hazardously located-
no guaranteed work week, and the wage
and other discrepancies between the
men and women. Kathy said that after
six weeks of hearing how nice it
would be to have a union, she called
the Amalgamated Meat Cutters, and
within a week there was a meeting
between ten of the workers and the
union.

At this meeting they got fired up
and ready to proceed with the union;
the workers were issued authoriza-
tion cards, which if the majority of
employees signed, would allow them to
hold an election for union represent-
ation.

Of the ten people issued cards,
eight signed, only one woman choosing
not to do so. With the simple major-
ity they could vote on whether or not
to go union in six weeks. Kathy said
that the hardest part of organizing
turned out to be keeping up the
enthusiasm in wake of the job harass-
ment that started coming down from
their supervisor and owners of the
plant.

The company did everything the
union warned them about: they slowed
down production and reduced the
working hours so that take-home pay
decreased from $75 a week to $50 a
week; they offered bribes to employ-
ees to go against voting union; they
tried to find out who initiated the
unionizing process by questioning
each employee privately; employees
were told if they refused to work

their day off (Saturday) they would
be fired; Kathy was struck by her
supervisor when she complained to
him about the work slowdown.

The workers had been advised by the
union to always have a witness to any
bribe, threat or interrogation coming
from the company. Having paid atten-
tion to this advice, the workers were
able to file three charges against
the company with the National Labor
Relations Board. Sue filed charges for
attempting to be bribed; Kathy filed
assault charges against her super-
visor, Lloyd Bell; and six of them
filed charges for being harassed and
laid off work because of their union
activities.

When election day came at the end of
May, the employees managed to stay
together and voted in the union by
a vote of 9 to 3. The following day,
however, the harassment was turned
on full force as the company laid
off half the workers for one week
and the other half for two weeks.
Even though the union was voted in,
the victory basically stopped there
most of the workers quit their jobs
finding they could no longer support
themselves and their families on less
than $50 a week. Sue said only one
of the original workers remains at
the shop and that the company
replaced those who left with company-
identified workers.

Bettaway Foods, however, is not rid
of its union "troubles". The union is
taking them to court in mid September,
suing them for back wages all the
times the workers were laid off
because of union activity; the union
is planning on suing Bettaway for
failure to negotiate; and the company
has been fined by the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration
for dangerous health hazards as the
result of a complaint filed by Sue.

Although the struggle at Bettaway
Foods was lost in that the women
never realized any of the benefits
from their efforts, two of the women
have committed themselves to using
the knowledge they gained on future
jobs.

Putting the Pieces Together

After hearing the organizing ex-
perience at Bettaway Foods, plus
other on-the-job experiences women
shared, we outlined what we'd learned

1. Equal pay for equal work and equal opportunities, with effective af-
firmative action programs, and jobs for all who want them.

2. Organizing working women into unions and caucuses, and encouraging
women unionists to take greater responsibility and leadership roles;
and to end male domination in the unions.

3. Interpretation of the Equal Rights Amendment to guarantee the extension
of labor standards covering women to men, and national protective leg-
islation including health and safety standards reflecting the needs

of workers, not employers.

4. Fighting racism. Recognizing the need for minority women, who are
doubly oppressed, to take leadership in unions and in Union WAGE;
supporting the struggle of all minority sisters and brothers.

5. Raising special demands for women workers: e.g., paid parental leave
without loss of seniority, maternity medical coverage without restric-
tions, and child care facilities, employer and government supported,

parent-staff controlled.

6. Ending sex and age discrimination in health and welfare and pension
plans, with pension portability for all workers.

7. Minimum wage of $4.00 per hour to be escalated in proportion to rate
of inflation, guaranteed to all workers without exception. Work week
of 30 hours or less at 40 hours pay with voluntary overtime at triple

pay.

8. Free national comprehensive health care.
9. Free abortion on demand. Free contraceptives of choice. No forced sterilizations.

10. Social Security benefits with an inflation escalator for every adult

and child.

11. An end to economic and social discrimination on the basis of sexual

orientation,

and what we still didn't know about
the process of organizing.

We agreed that most working women
are in isolated job situations,
whether we work in traditional or
non-traditional jobs. We found that
most of us have little education on
our rights as working women and little
education on the agencies designed to
protect our rights, as well as the
limitations of these agencies.

Although we learned some do's and
don'ts about bringing in an existing
union, we still lack knowledge on how
to shop around for a union, how to
fight sexism within unions, how to
form a union from scratch designed
specifically for our needs, or how to
organize in areas that have never
been organized, i.e., household workers.
Most of all, we recognized the diffi-
culty of realizing our goals as work-
ing women.

Some of the women expressed a
commitment to meet again, feeling
we had only touched the surface of
a very involved and complicated
problem, feeling the need for action.
