Cop Kills Kid

A white cop shot and killed  
a five-year-old Black child  
in the boy's bedroom when he  
"mistook" a toy pistol of the  
child's for a real one. Neigh-  
bors had called the police  
because they were concerned  
at not having seen either the  
child or his mother for a  
number of hours. Patricia  
Ridge, his mother, is a work-  
ing woman who is so poor that,  
like millions of women in the  
same situation, she couldn't  
afford to pay a babysitter to  
look after her child while  
she worked to support them  
both. A grand jury is "con-  
sidering" whether to indict  
the policeman. They are also  
considering indicting the  
mother for leaving her child  
alone and possibly for invol-  
untary manslaughter!

Racist Murder

After Willie Lee Drumgoole,  
a 36-year-old Black man, was  
choked and beaten to death by  
four guards after demanding a  
cigarette and talking back to  
his white jailers, a fascist  
KKK-style leaflet was found  
circulating inside the Rich-  
mond (CA) Police Department  
gloating over Drumgoole's  
murder and glorifying the  
chokehold that killed him.  
The leaflet showed a grinning  
hunter crouched over a dead  
deer (Drumgoole) and depicted  
Black people as animals that  
need to be hunted and killed.

Stop Violence

"Women against violence  
against women" movements are  
gaining strength in Mexico  
and Peru. Women in Mexico  
City have set up the country's  
first Rape Crisis support  
telephone line, while in  
Lima the first Reclaim the  
Night marches have been sta-  
ged and attended by hundreds  
of women. In Peru, the women's  
movement reports that 80% of  
cases of rape brought before  
the courts are lost. Women  
have to prove they are vir-  
gins and demonstrate “physi-  
cal" proof of their rape.

Eros Club Burned

On March 21, Angry Women  
attacked the Eros Sex Cinema  
Club in Call Lane, Leeds. A  

Ford Escort was driven through  

the front window of the city  
centre club at about 2:30,  
and its passenger compartment  
set alight. Fire was confined  
to the car itself. This is  
the third attack on the Eros  
Cinema in a year. Previous  
attacks have involved petrol  
bombs.

NO MORE SHIT

-New Indicator

Porn Shops Shut

A New Mexico feminist group  
has managed to close down 11  
porn shops by gluing shut the  
locks. According to group  
members, their "Attacks on  
private property are far less  
injurious than...the attacks  
on women...by these porno-  
graphy stores." The group of  
protesters is known as the  
"Greater Albuquerque Feminist  
Trash Collection and Disposal  
Agency."

Sex Determination

Women in Bombay, India have  
been investigating the use of  
amniocentesis to determine  
the sex of a fetus and are  
asking an end to this use be-  
cause many people are using  
it to abort girl babies.

Women are demanding that  
amniocentesis be allowed only  
in research institutions.

Women Win Strike

Black South African women  
are continuing to strike a-  
gainst their country's oppre-  
ssive apartheid system, high  
unemployment, high food prices  
and low wages. Black women  
members of the Federation of  
South African Women organized  
a rent strike in the towns of  
Mabopane, Alexandra and Sowe-  
to. Faced with soaring rents,  
transport and food costs, the  
women refused to cooperate  
with authorities until rent  
increases were withdrawn. Des-  
pite intimidation and eviction  
threats, the battle was won.

U.S. Intervention

Protests erupted in Puerto  
Rico as soon as it became  
public knowledge that the  
island's National Guard had  
participated in massive U.S.-  
Honduran war games aimed at  
Nicaragua. Puerto Rican mili-  
tary forces are being groomed  
as auxiliaries to the U.S.  
army for intervention in the  
region. In the past, the is-  
land's government has denied  
reports of a National Guard  
role outside Puerto Rico.

The decision to release in-  
formation on the just-com-  
pleted war games is, says the  
Caribbean Project for Justice  
and Peace, "designed to test  
the reaction of public opin-  
ion in Puerto Rico, Latin  
America, the Caribbean and  

the U.S. to these activities  
and, therefore, to measure  
the political costs of a dir-  
ect and overt Puerto Rican in-  
volvement in Central America."

Woman Disappears

Maria Cecilia Rodriguez  
Araya, a Chilean citizen,  
seized by police in early  
February, as she was about  
to board a plane for an inter-  
national meeting in Spain.

She has been active in an or-  
ganization of relatives of  
Chileans, including her bro-  
ther, who were arrested and  
never heard from again in the  
wake of a 1973 military take-  
over in that country.

Under Chile's 1981 consti-  
tution, the country's presi-  

dent has the ability to order  
people held for up to 20 days  
for questioning without being  
charged with any crime. All  
too frequently, those held  
join the ranks of the over  
20,000 Chileans who have dis-  
appeared altogether over the  
last decade.

Water Rights Denied

The Supreme Court on March  
30 denied five Southwestern  
Indian tribes their rightful  
water rights in the Colorado  
River basin. The denial was a  
serious blow to the Indians,  
who had proved that the high  
court's 1964 decision regard-  
ing their water rights was  
based on the government's  
figures, which admittedly  
understated by 22% - thou-  
sands of acres - the actual  
irrigable acreage held by the  
Indian tribes. The size of  
the irrigable acreage deter-  
mines the amount of water  
rights allotment.

Those who gained by the  
ruling were the states of  
Colorado, California and  
Nevada, who would have lost  
the increase in water rights  
they gained in the court's  
1964 decision.

Records Destroyed

The Rhode Island Rape Cri-  
sis Center has destroyed the  
records of more than 1,000 of  
its clients to prevent the  
files from being subpoenaed  
for use in rape trials. The  
center's director recently  
spent 16 hours in jail after  
refusing to give a judge the  
records on a teenager who  
was raped.

Censorship Lifted

Several forms of censorship  
used by guards at the Oregon  
Women's Correctional Center  
and the Oregon State Peniten-  
tiary were ruled unconstitu-  
tional in a federal court in  
Portland. Lesbian and gay  
male publications or books  
which are not "sexually ex-  
plicit" must no longer be  
kept from prisoners.
