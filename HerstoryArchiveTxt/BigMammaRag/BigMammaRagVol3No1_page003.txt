Big Mama Rag - Vol. 3 - No. 1

Bertha Romero is a Peace Corps Volunteer in Thailand who teaches English to blind students from kindergarten to the eighth grade. She has been in Thailand since January and has the following to say about women in Thai society.

Sumalee is a Thai woman, very verbal and active in women’s rights. She was writing articles every week until recently - about two months ago - and is still behind the lights. Rumor has it that many Thai (both men and women) have been offended by her writings and she was advised to be more careful. Also, there might be fear for her life because she apparently “knows too much.” Another woman journalist, an American named Claudia Ross, was murdered in Bangkok about that same time (two months ago). So things are slowly dying down - it’s funny how the mass media is never really made aware of how things turn out in the end. But she hasn't been writing at all lately.

I've learned too, that Thai women are very aggressive, equal, and outspoken. Sumalee also worked on a draft of the constitution to include women’s rights, equal rights, wages, improved job conditions, etc. - but the House turned it down. The bill was not published, and the only thing people read in the papers was: “She was asked to remove herself from the room because she had her legs crossed. She refused, stating that all the men had their legs crossed and if she was asked to leave they ‘should be too.’ (She was also the only woman there.)” She was finally physically removed, I've gathered. And when I mention her name to some Thais, either men or women, they immediately say “She's foolish and nobody pays attention to her anyway.” That’s the way it is in Thailand.

Feminist College to Open

With more than 1,000 colleges offering women’s studies courses and 80 making it possible to earn a degree in the same, is a college devoted to feminism necessary?

Such a college - it will be called an institute - will open in the summer of 1975 in Boulder. Founded by feminist activists, Sagaris will answer the need for the study of unadulterated feminist philosophy. Dr. Joan Peters, one of the founders, said in an interview that there will be greater academic freedom than found at any college or university offering women’s studies. “Present courses leave something to be desired,” she said. “In many schools the women’s studies are controlled by men or locked into a system that does not allow adequate freedom for maximum intellectual growth.” Dr. Peters, of Goddard College in Plainfield, Vt., and Brooklyn, N.Y., told how the institute got its name. “The name was taken from the Sagaris, the double-edged sword of the ancient Amazons, who, according to mythology, were militant only when necessary to protect themselves from aggressors.”

The Amazons, mythology holds, were powerfully strong women who waged war on the oppressors. Dr. Peters stressed that they take Sagaris in a political and not a military sense.

“Our institute, which we call an institute to allow ourselves the intellectual freedom not possible in establishment colleges, is meant to be a feminist-humanist alternative to existing patriarchal society schools of higher education,” Dr. Peters said.

The founders include writers, teachers, and activists. Among them is Blanche Boyd, author of a book titled “Nerves.” Also involved, according to Dr. Peters, is Ti-Grace Atkinson, pioneer theoretician of the women’s movement in America.

‘Girl’ Gets $9,000.

Mary Joyce, 26, who complained to her boss about calling her “the girl” and a day later she was fired, will get $9,000 from her former employer by order of the New York State Human Rights Division. Miss Joyce said in her complaint she was fired after telling assistant vice president John Maloney of AVCO Financial Services, Inc., she didn't like being called “the girl” when her title was “Commercial Paper Salesperson.”

She said she was called in the next day and dismissed on grounds of “misconduct.” Under a settlement signed by both sides, AVCO will pay her $9,000 and give her a mutually agreed upon letter of recommendation informing future employers she was “capable, competent, and satisfactory.”
