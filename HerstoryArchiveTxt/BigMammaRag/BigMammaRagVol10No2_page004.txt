Hold Your Nose

A campaign by organizations
representing poor people
succeeded in pushing Reagan
to distribute to the poor a
small portion of the millions
of tons of surplus cheese
that are beginning to rot
in government warehouses.

Reagan used the distrib-
ution of the cheese to mas-
querade as a humanitarian
who thought of giving the
cheese away all by himself
as a holiday gesture.

The cheese and other dairy
surpluses are a small frac-
tion of the millions of tons
of food that agribusiness
and the government withhold
from the market and usually
destroy to keep food prices
high.

No Sanctuary

A diverse group of 100
clergy, community leaders
and local San Francisco area
activists presented 10,000
signatures to the Immigration
and Naturalization Service
(INS) demanding sanctuary
for Salvadoran refugees.

Despite reports that many
Salvadorans are tortured and
sometimes killed when they
are forced back to El Salva-
dor, INS District Director
Ilchert insists that such
deportees are "economic re-
fugees," and therefore not
entitled to sanctuary in this
country. The demonstrators
argued that all Salvadoran
immigrants, regardless of
political philosophy, are po-
litical refugees.

Melt Down

An Arizona legislator sug-
gests overcrowding at the
new Perryville State Prison
could be alleviated with a
cooling system breakdown,
allowing prisoners to suffo-
cate in 115-degree tempera-
tures.

The comment by Rep. Jane
D. Hull, R-Phoenix, came
during questioning of state

prison chief Ellis MacDougal,
who appeared before the
House Appropriations Commit-
tee to support his requested
budget.

"Maybe the swamp coolers
will break down," she said.
"That might get rid of some
of our prison population...
I really believe if we made
it harder on them, they
wouldn't be there."

Human Sacrifice

After a nuclear war the
U.S. government would have
the aged act as guinea pigs
to test radiation levels, ac-
cording to a recent Dept. of
Energy study.

The report suggests that
people over 40 be sent out
of the shelters first to
sample contaminated food and
water supplies, sparing the
younger generations.

The reasoning behind the
study is if the elderly ab-
sorb larger doses of radia-
tion than the young, less
harm will be done to the
species as a whole. The con-
clusion is obvious—the lives
of senior citizens are ex-
pendable.

“Classy” Housing

A tenants group from a work-
ing class neighborhood in
downtown Manhattan, are in-
volved in an intense struggle
to protect their homes. The
neighborhood (Chelsea) is

the latest target of a "gent-
rification" program—where
working class people are
thrown out of their homes and
the buildings are renovated
to sell as condos or rent for
higher payments. Community
activists occupied one build-
ing and several rallies in
support have called attention
to the struggle.

More Daycare

Recently released govern-
ment statistics show a grow-
ing need for daycare, even
as federal support for day-
care programs is being cut
back.

The Dept. of Labor reports
that for the first time, half
of all children under 18 have
working mothers. The largest
increase is among working mo-
thers with children under six
years of age. Their numbers
are growing by about 200,000
a year. The largest propor-
tion of such families are
headed by divorced women.

Sambo's Bankrupt

The target of a national
Black boycott, the Sambo's
fast food chain, recently
filed for bankruptcy.

The chain took its name
from the racist children's
tale, "Little Black Sambo",
and refused to change it de-
spite Black organizations'
protests.

The NAACP led the boycott
effort, which was particular-
ly successful in New England.
Sambo's had restaurants in 47
states.

Unveiling

Homa Nategh, Iranian histori-
an, a former university pro-
fessor, and a leading feminist
has been arrested and impri-
soned along with many other
members of the Iranian Writ-
ers Association. She has con-
demned the compulsory veil

and Khomeini's oppressive sys-

tem in her articles. Accord-
ing to Khomeini's regime, she
has committed two crimes: op-
posing him and being a femi-
nist.

Sick

A citizens group in Lancas-
ter, WI, said Tuesday it
will circulate petitions
seeking the ouster of the
circuit judge who called a
5-year-old sexual assault
victim an "unusually sexually
promiscuous young lady."

Judge Reinecke made the
remark a month ago in sent-
encing Ralph Snodgrass of
Gays Mills, to 90 days in a
work-release program for
sexually assaulting the 5-
year-old daughter of the wom-
an with whom he was living.

He said he was sleeping
and the girl climbed on top
of him.

The judge said he was sim-
ply trying to show that the
girl, not really knowing
what she was doing, was the
aggressor.

Brown Lung

Cotton mill workers in Ala.
are organizing the Ala. Brown
Lung Association (BLA), an
organization which has had
much impact already in the
state of N.C. In Ala., due
to an industry-wide cover-up
and a repressive state compen-
sation system, nobody has ev-
er won a worker's compensat-
ion award for brown lung.

Carole Spriggins, one of
the BLA organizers, is a
typical victim of this respir-
atory disease, caused by years
of breathing the cotton dust
in the mill. She is totally
disabled, but is afraid to
file for worker's comp be-
cause the company may fire
her husband, whose salary is
now supporting the large fam-
ily. She says the BLA is
working for compensation for
victims, but also for safer
working conditions.

Frozen Memorial

The memory of homeless peo-
ple who died from exposure
and neglect was commemorated
in an action in Lafayette
Park in Washington, D.C. on
Dec. 28.

Activists erected 539
crosses in the park, which
is across the street from the
White House, to draw attent-
ion to the effect of Reagan's
policies on the poor. It is
estimated that 900 homeless
and poor people die every
year from exposure.
