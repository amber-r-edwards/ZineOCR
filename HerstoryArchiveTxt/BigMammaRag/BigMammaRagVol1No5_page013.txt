IT HAPPENED

and college days and I will
never again be ashamed of
either. Most of my friends
are women who identify them-
selves as women and who now
see many solutions to con-
temporary outrages through

feminist eyes. Trying to
live our lives with that kind

of consciousness always in
mind is often difficult,
FRUSTRATING, and even madden-
ing, but it can be exhilarat-
ing as well.

At least I have learned to be
proud. Whereas I was once
perverted, abnormal, and some-
thing less than human, I am
now prideful, beautiful, and
sometimes even superior about
myself because I am Lesbian.

levels I was and am

I was afraid before
because I thought I was an
outcast to be shunned and
whispered about (now I know
I'm an outcast, but being an
outcast is my strength). I
am afraid now because I know
there are people who would
not hesitate to kill me—and
kill me with self-righteous-
ness. Being a Lesbian who

is out front, I am immediately
a threat to this entire pat-
riarchal society—a society
that has become so corrupt
and fascistic it would will-
ingly annihilate anyone who
dares to oppose it (often as
long as that annihilation is
undercover—shades of WATER -
GATE). Before, I was a mon-
ster inside of myself (and
that was the monster) but now,
as Robin Morgan put it, "I
AM A MONSTER AND I AM PROUD."

I am also happy because

I will continue to be a "Mon-
ster" as long as we live in

a world where people are only
as free as far as the wire tap
on their telephones, where
every minority must suffer for
their differences and where
every woman—in the context

of our lives—must be a pros-
titute to someone or some-
thing.

I know that I must con-
tinue to be an outcast be-
cause I can never again be
part of that system, that
I will spend my whole life
functioning outside of it
and that I will do every-
thing in my power to stop
its insensitive destruction
of woman's soul.

By Linda T.

Children can be amazingly per-
ceptive. My lover, Linda,
went with me to my parents
last Christmas, just as any
happily married couple would.
Everyone was polite to her,
as my roommate; and only
slowly pieced together their
suspicions that our relation-
ship might be different. Ex-
cept for my six-year-old nep-
hew. Kent immediately sensed
our feelings for each other,
accepted it, and put it all
into the only model he knew:
Linda was my husband. Even
though her name was feminine
she obviously had to be a
boy. When we insisted that
she was a girl, he just pro-
ceeded to ask other people,
hoping to eventually find
someone who agreed she was

a boy. The really intri-
guing part was that he also
recognized the sexuality of
the situation. Although we
had never even held hands in
his presence at one point he
teasingly delivered a de-
scriptive monologue on the
subject. "I know what you do
in bed—You hug and kiss and
everything." (giggle)

And he was six years old!

"Marie."
"I got your letter today."
"Yes,"

"I read something about you and
Jim,"

"Oh Marie, he's so great! You

have to meet him."

"You said you were going to
stay there with him. I thought
you would come to Denver?"
“Well, I told him about
our closeness, and he said he was
sure it's just a childish

girlfriend relationship we
should have had in high school.
He's a psych major, you know,

and we talk a lot about, well,
maybe we'll both be out some-
time to visit you this summer."
"No. No don't do that;
don't. I'll see you

Goodbye."

the rest of the evening, every-
thing was silent. She sat
in front of the window like so
many before, looking
into a street that led

into an empty city.

What did she have in the fu-
ture now to look forward to?
But remember, now is what is
important. The happiness now
justifies living for the
future. Or was it the hap-

piness of the future that jus-
tifies living now?
