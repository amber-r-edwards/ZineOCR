Herizons: Politics Of

Sue Doell

Herizons: A Bookstore for
Women, opened in Denver in
February, 1983 as a privately
owned feminist bookstore.
The store permanently closed
in December. Many women have
made the assumption that it
went out of business for

classism

financial reasons. This is
not true. Herizons was closed
very intentionally and the
motivation was political -
not financial.

This is not my original
statement, nor is it all I
have to say. There is ano-
ther article in progress
that is very personal. It
talks of my life, my growing
political awareness, the
connections of oppression
that I see. I share my re-
action of attempting to "let
go" of my classist attitudes/
privilege. It talks about
survival. That piece of wri-
ting is already very long,
yet I feel I've only begun.
Who knows where it will all
end. It talks more in depth
about the issues I will try
to address here. This arti-
cle focuses only on class
issues. I intentionally, for
now, do not specify issues
of racism, anti-Semitism,
mentalism. This is offered
only as a brief summary.

Herizons opened as a femi-
nist bookstore, without me
having a clear definition of
feminism. I came to realize
that I was operating a main-
stream capitalist business.
The "clientele" was for the
most part white/christian/
middle-class, and detached,
intellectual about oppres-
sion. So was I. I created an
environment that was the
epitome of my classist val-
ues/attitudes; of my subtle
racism (subtle to me, not to
women of color) and naive
of other oppression. As I
became more politically a-
ware, I was in constant
struggle about the contra-
dictions of my politics. I
was trying to do active work
fighting oppression, yet I
was perpetuating and encour-
aging it all on a daily ba-
sis by owning, operating and
keeping Herizons alive. It's
more involved than me just
needing to get out; I cannot
support a store like Heri-
zons on any level. Herizons
operated under a pretext of
feminism and presented it-
self as an "alternative."

It cannot do both. Herizons
was a business, plain and

simple. I opened the store
with the emphasis on organ-
ization and cleanliness; I

was not at all prepared to
offer support or solutions
to the many women who came
there because they were
homeless and hungry. I
quickly learned to refer
them away, to go spend the
night in some church where
they could wake up the next
day living under the same
miserable conditions. An
hour later a white, class
privileged woman would walk
in, claiming to be a femi-
nist and saying she was
there to support what I was
doing, to support Herizons.
She would walk out with an
armful of books and merchan-
dise, which rarely included
any of the titles available
about politics/feminism.
She would walk out giving
me praise for my classism,
racism, anti-Semitism.

The "clientele" never saw
what was happening. When I
finally did, I felt trapped.
I wanted to change the store.
To change everything: the
name, the inventory, the
priorities. But it was a
large space - the rent was
high ($550 a month). I had
an entire inventory that I
did not know what to do with.
I finally reached a point -
it had all become so intol-
erable - that I was even
willing to walk away from
it, to take a "loss", to
call it quits. The absolute
only reason Herizons remain-
ed open from June until Dec-
ember was because of my leg-
al obligation with the lease.
That lease was secured by
other assets (which means
I would have had to sell,
or lose, those assets to
pay an additional $3300 in
rent whether the store con-
tinued or not). I was caught
dead-center in a classic,
classist "bind."

During this time, I "came
out" as an ex-psychiatric
inmate (see July '83 BMR).
The Women Psychiatric In-
mates Liberation Front
(WPILF) began meeting at
Herizons. I tried to keep
the politics of the group,
and the up-to-now neutral-
ity of Herizons separated,
but could not. The store re-
flected the politics, the
"women's community" reacted
to both the group and the
store, and all hell broke
loose. I hope to never again
have to encounter such vi-
ciousness. At times women
were direct, hateful. Most
of the time the attacks
were painfully subtle. Daily
confrontations became the
norm. I cannot say anymore
about this, and expect to
keep this particular arti-
cle a reasonable length. For
now, I refer you to the Oct.
'83 BMR (Susanna Smith's —

“Feminist” Business

article on the local rape
hotline/community meeting)
and the Dec. '83 BMR (Lori
Bradford's article on the
mental patient's liberation
movement).

In early summer, a working-
class woman began staffing at
the store. We were friends,
we were working together
politically and collectively
in WPILF. Morgan became an
intricate part of my survi-
val during this time, not
only by staffing, but also
by our constant political
discussions. And somehow
through it all, in the be-
ginning we had fun. We could
and did talk for hours, yet
we never quite got around to
discussing class issues. I
was an "employer" and didn't
want to deal with it. I dis-
regarded the traditional,
blatant methods of being an
employer and thought that
that solved any conflict.
But my classism continued
to affect everything. I made
the decisions, signed the
checks, had full and total
control. Financial differ-
ences are “easy," they are
visible and apparent. But
for me, classist attitudes/
values/actions are so much
more difficult to identify.
I was not politically aware
—I never took the time to
think about it. Which by it-

self is classist (and would
apply to every other "ism").

I want to apologize, and I
need to do it publicly. To
Morgan, because I hurt you
so deeply. And I want to tell
you - not in consolation -
there is none - but just so
you know... This other piece
of writing that is in pro-
gress, my intention is to
try to show the connections
of oppression; how so many
of us are both the oppressed
and the oppressors. That art-
icle is very personal and
honest, in the hopes that
other white, class privi-
leged women can someday un-
derstand and join the strug-
gle.

Another reason I must apol-
ogize publicly is to acknow-
ledge that these things hap-
pened. All our mutual friends
have also felt the pain. Life
has been too intense lately,
for all of us, as it is.

I also talk about it here
because many women who came
to the store would like to
believe this is an isolated,
personal incident, that it
has nothing to do with them,
with Herizons. Classism,
racism, anti-Semitism and
mentalism have absolutely
everything to do with why
Herizons closed.
