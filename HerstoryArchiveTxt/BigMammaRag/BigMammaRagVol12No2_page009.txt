Patients Getting More Than

sleep, and then I'm awake
early in the morning.

I often laugh and cry in-
appropriately. This really
interferes in my relation-
ships with other people, and
is still upsetting to me. I
used to be an outgoing per-
son, but I have become very
fearful of people and sit-
uations, even those I know
well. I often feel confused
as well as anxious, and I
have difficulty making even

simple decisions.
I feel depressed most of

the time. It's hard to know
how much of that is the mer-
cury and how much is that
I'm just so tired of feel-
ing sick all of the time.

I become uncontrollably
angry at unpredictable
times. Part of me would re-
ally like to hurt other peo-
ple, and sometimes I really
don't know why I want to
lash out at them. I grabbed
a doctor by the necktie
once, but that was after
he'd told me that all of my
symptoms were in my head.

I find telling you all of
this for publication very
threatening. I'm worried
what others reading this
will think of me, but I
know that if I don't let
others know, then they may
go through the same thing
alone. It's a horrible
thing to live with, espec-
ially when you want to harm
those you love.

Q I think that you have a
lot to be angry about.

A I know that you think so,
and that helps somewhat.
But at times the anger is
overwhelming, and I'm not
even sure who or what I'm
angry about.

Q How did doctors and dent-
ists react to you when you
described your problems?

A Well, first of all, no-
body even checked me for
mercury poisoning. This
makes it hard for me now,
because after all these
years my blood mercury lev-
els are normal, even though
I am still quite sick. I
think if I'd had a blood
mercury level taken earlier
--when the results would
have been elevated--then
perhaps doctors would be-
lieve me now.

Basically, up until a few
months ago, all the doctors
I saw dismissed me as
"crazy." I was a "hypochond-
riac." They gave me tranq-
uilizers, relaxants, and
anti-epileptics. In the
dental offices, my lack of
coordination was a subject
for joking. The dentists, as
well, wanted me to take
drugs. One even gave me Val-
ium. There were lots of

drugs in the dental office--
pain killers and tranquiliz-
ers--and I could have had
whatever I wanted. That was
easier for my employer than
giving me time off work

to go to a doctor.

Q How did you feel when ev-
eryone decided that you were
a "crazy woman"?

A Very, very alone, and
desperate. Listening to all
those doctors tell me it was
all in my head would have
made the sanest person crazy.
I began to believe them. The
hurt, shame and guilt were
tremendous.

Q How did you find out ab-
out mercury poisoning?

A Someone gave me an arti-
cle by Ben Berck on mercury
in dental offices, entitled
“Mercury Vapour as an Atmos-
pheric Contaminant in Dental
Offices" (Archives of Envir-
onmental Toxicology, 3:2).

I started doing some more
reading and it was like a
jigsaw puzzle being put to-
gether. I was terrified. I
wanted to know, yet I didn't
know who to trust. I called
Jay Cowan, who was the N.D.
P. critic on workplace
health and safety in the
Manitoba legislature. He put
me in touch with Bob Sass,
then the director of Saskat-
chewan's Occupational Safety
and Health Branch. Sass had
written about another work-
er, George Smith, who also
had mercury poisoning, and
he arranged for me to talk

to him. Talking to them all
pulled me through some tough
times.
Q What did you do then?
A I began the long task,
which now seems impossible,
of trying to "prove" that I
have mercury poisoning. Now,
that the acute phase is ov-
er, analysis for mercury
content in blood is meaning-
less. A sympathetic dental
researcher here recently did
an analysis of my hair for
mercury content, and found
it abnormally high. How
much this "proves" is debat-
able. I believe that there
are still mercury deposits
in my bones and other tissue,
but this is impossible to
prove. They just don't have
the medical technology.

But I did keep trying for
a long time. The general
medical consensus about me
was that I was schizophrenic
and manic-depressive. If I
spoke about my mercury poi-
soning, they all viewed this
as a further symptom of my
mental illness. In their
minds the problem wasn't
that mercury was making me
crazy, but rather that I was
crazy to think that my symp-
toms had anything to do with
mercury. Then I really start-
ed to feel crazy. I felt so
alone, and I became very,
very depressed. I thought
about suicide.

I became afraid of what
would happen if people knew
how depressed and angry I

sometimes felt. Because of
this fear, I tried to hide

a lot, and not let anyone
know how bad it really was.
Of course, this just made me
feel more lonely and isolat-
ed. My handicap now is an
invisible one, and so people
find it hard to empathize
with me.

Q Are you eligible for work-
ers' compensation?

A No. Dental offices in Man-
itoba and Alberta, the two
provinces in which I worked,
are not covered by workers'
compensation. Dentists can
voluntarily opt for coverage.
Unfortunately for me, none
of the dentists I worked for
did so. If I'd gotten mercury
poisoning in a factory, or

as a hydro worker like George
Smith, I'd be a lot better
off financially, and probab-
ly emotionally too.

Q How do you manage now?

A It's a struggle 24 hours
a day. Support from under-
standing people helps, but
I still feel alone with it
at times. My symptoms are
not as bad now, and they
can be expected to lessen
over time, but there is no
cure. That's the most diffi-
cult thing for me still,
knowing that there is no
cure. I still forget simple
things and often have troub-
le saying what I mean to
say. I'm trying to be less
hard on myself when these
things happen.

Hazards Of Working With Mercury

Mercury has been an occu-
pational hazard for hundreds
of years. As early as 1600,
mercury nitrate was used in
the felting of hats. Hence
the "Mad Hatter" of Alice in
Wonderland. "Mad" hatters
were exhibiting the signs
of chronic mercury poison-
ing. Mercury was the first
substance to be occupation-
ally regulated - in 1665 in
Idrija, Yugoslavia. In re-
cognition of the hazard,
the working hours in the
mercury mines were reduced
from 14 hours to 6 hours
per day.

Mercury is a particularly
insidious poison. It is the
only metal which vaporizes
at room temperature. Since
mercury vapor has no odor,
accidental inhalation is a
real risk. Mercury poison-
ing can also occur through
ingestion or absorption
through the skin.

ACUTE mercury poisoning,
caused by high levels of ex-
posure, is rarely seen. Its
symptoms include respiratory
irritation, digestive dis-
turbances, kidney damage.

In severe cases central
nervous system damage also
occurs.

CHRONIC mercury poisoning
usually results from long-
term, low levels of expo-
sure. It causes a great var-
iety of symptoms. The cen-
tral nervous system is the
primary target. Damage to
the CNS from chronic mer-
curialism results in psych-
ological disturbances - shy-
ness, irritability, insom-
nia, indecision, depres-
sion - tremors, sensations
of tingling and numbness
and lack of coordination.
Other symptoms include
gingivitis, excessive sal-
ivation or dryness of the
mouth, disturbances of
taste and smell and loss
of appetite.

There are three types of
mercury - metallic, organ-
ic and inorganic. ALL ARE
TOXIC. Epidemics of organic
mercury poisoning such as
those among native people
in Northern Ontario and the
residents of Minamata, Jap-
an, have been the result of
industrial pollution. A

1972 epidemic in Iraq, which
killed 459 people and poi-
soned 6530, was the result
of the ingestion of methyl
mercury fungicide used to
treat the wheat seed used
in bread making.

Occupational exposures to
mercury may occur among the
makers of:

acetone

paper

fulminates

batteries

scientific instruments

mercury vapor lamps

disinfectants

dyes and colors

The following workers are
also exposed:

dentists and other dental
workers

induction furnace workers

mercury boiler workers

photographic workers

mercury pump workers

farmers and farm workers

tannery workers

electroplaters

gilders

metal refiners

bronzers

fur handlers
