Workfare  

gram because the number of  
persons able to comply would  
be cut down. .  

This administration has  
committed itself to reducing  
the budget by reducing social  
services and to keeping the  
rich safe by increasing the  
defense budget.  

A few statistics about the  
food stamp program and the  
defense program might be  
helpful in putting the food  
stamp program into perspec-  
tive. The entire food stamp  
budget for fiscal 1982, with-  
out any cuts, without the  
implementation of the workfare  
program, is expected to cost  
$12.6 billion. With all of  
the proposed cuts in the food  
stamp program, the government  

from page 3  

"save" about $1.8 bil-  
lion. *$1.8 billion is slightly  
less than the cost of a pro-  
posed nuclear powered aircraft  
carrier. The 1980 defense pay-  
roll for military personnel  
in Colorado alone totaled  
Piet DIT Ti6n.  

When the workfare pilot pro-  
grams were started, proponents  
said it would lead into full-  

woulc  

time jobs for the participants.  

Now after the workfare program  
has been going, only a handful  
of participants have gotten  

jobs through the program. Doug  
Tallor,  

workfare would lead to jobs,  
now says even if it does not  
lead to permanent full-time  
jobs, workfare "does build

an official in Tazewell  
county who pushed the idea that  

the character of an individu-  
al, and it gives them a work  
ethic attitude and if it only  
does that it's worth it." How  
a person is supposed to feed  
her family with a work ethic  
and no job he didn't say.  

Persons forced on workfare  
not only have to work, but  
they also end up having to  
pay to be in the program.  
Participants have to pay for  
their own transportation to  
the jobs and, if they have  
children 6 or older, must  
arrange and pay for childcare.  
When asked about what mothers  
are supposed to do with their  
children when working for  
food stamps, Helms said,  
"Hundreds of thousands of  
working women who do not re-  
ceive any benefits at all  
solve that problem."  

The workfare program for  

food stamp recipients is only  
the first phase of Reagan's  
plan to have all welfare re-  
cipients work for their bene-  
fits. The conclusions from  
the food stamp workfare pro-  
gram will have a direct ef-  
fect on whether workfare will  
be extended to other benefits  
recipients. The attitude that  
the poor are poor through  
their own fault, that they're  
lazy and unable to do what  
"hundreds of thousands" of  
other women do puts the blame  
on women who would work in-  
stead of business; which re-  
fuses them work and the gov-  
ernment that now won't even  

pay them wages for working.  

Welfare recipients, if Reagan  
has his way, will find them-  
selves in the position of  
having to "sell their soul to  
the company store" to survive.
