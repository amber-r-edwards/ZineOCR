our sovereign nation. And so this is what I told them. And  
also, talking about other things, the presidents who are in  
the White House - when we go to see them, they are always  
somewhere in a foreign country, a country where those citi-  
zens of that country didn't vote for them. But he goes  
there, only to make war. This is how these presidents go  
about their business. And one president, his name was Ford,  
he was responsible for signing Public Law 93-531. So today  
we have relocation and livestock control. Recently one of  
the new commissioners came out and I asked him two ques-  
tions - all the federal representatives, I ask them these  
questions. I asked them why are they afraid of the movement  
of the clock and I asked them also why are they scared of  
the big wind. I'm talking about the weather, because when  
they come to our meetings they always say we are pressing  
for time. We think it's going to rain. I tell them, we Diné  
people, our lives every day, our daily lives, we live accord-  
ing to the sacred mountains, the laws they represent. We  
are told that these sacred mountains, in the beginning were  
embedded with the big wind spirit, we call it. And also, I  
tell them that our people, as individual persons we go  
about and live on this land. We carry the mountain songs,  
the mountain prayers, and songs and prayers for the fire,  
and songs and prayers for the hogan. So this is how we live.  
Those are our laws. That's how we all come to be on this  
earth. Your law, you the white man, your law is on paper.  
We can leave this paper out on the land and it will begin  
to fade away; it will deteriorate within a few days. It  
will disappear. Or if the wind blows it into a fire, it  
will burn. That is your law and you hold it like it was so  
sacred. Also with that you are scared of the wind and the  
clock. And so this is how we live today. Still today we are  

gathered here before our father the sun. Also one thing  
that I would like to mention, is that we keep on hearing  

of the federal government cutting back jobs. Different jobs  
that aren't really necessary are being cut. So I wonder why  
they haven't cut the BIA programs yet. Maybe they only cut  
away the good jobs, and all the dirty jobs have to continue.  
Also with our own people, there are only a few of us that  
speak the language - mostly the old ones are speaking the  
language. Many of our children and grandchildren speak a  
little, but they speak mostly English. So the United States  
government has stolen our children's tongue, and with that  
they have stolen our land. They are stealing our livestock  
today. All the things that the United States government  
does today is go to foreign countries and be a part of  
those actions where they go in there and provide arms to  
make war among peaceful nations. Today he's doing the same  
thing here to the Indian people on this land.
