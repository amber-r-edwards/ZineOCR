Costs Of Free Speech

A judge in Alabama who
cited a woman for contempt
because she criticized him
in a letter to a newspaper
is now the target of a flood
of critical letters from all
over the country. Connie Cox
had criticized the court's
handling of a divorce case
and said that she wanted wo-
men to know the type of jud-
icial system we have. The
judge at first called her
letter “disrespectful and
false" and fined her $100
for contempt of court, but
he later decided to withdraw
the order and fine. The let-
ter urged women to "sit up
and take notice of this sit-
uation because next time it
could be you."

Baby Guinea Pigs

The majority of drugs giv-
en to pregnant women have
never been approved by the
FDA as safe for such use.

The FDA reasons that it is
unsafe and unethical to test
drugs on pregnant women yet
approved the use of the drugs
during pregnancy, labor and
birth without testing. The
most dangerous effects of ob-
stetric drugs are frequently
omitted from the package.

No News

The White House acknowledged
that the Pentagon, with
the approval of Reagan, took
over from the beginning the
management and dissemination
of news concerning the inva-
sion of Grenada. As a result
the public was shut out of
invasion news independent of
U.S. government sources.
Meanwhile, the administration
was able to stress its mo-
tives and justifications
(tell its lies) for the in-
vasion and keep journalists
and television cameras away
until the combat was over.

Whose Heritage?

A conservative think tank,
the Heritage Foundation, has
"thought" of a new way to
feed the poor. Soup kitchens
and vitamin pills should re-
place expensive federal pro-
grams because malnutrition
still runs rampant in diets
of those who receive aid.
"Passing out vitamin pills
to the poor would be far
cheaper and more effective
nutritionally than current
programs and would not des-
troy anyone's incentive to
provide for himself." Sounds
like something Reagan would
have "thought" of.

Business As Usual

Nearly a year ago a woman
from Schenectady, NY was
raped and assaulted by a
"prominent businessman" who
she had worked for. She re-
ported this to the police and
has “pursued this for almost
one year now, trying to get
criminal charges against
(her) attacker." Since that
time the businessman has
tried to break into her
apartment and attack her
again and he has tried to
bribe her to drop the charg-
es. She has sought help from
the rape crisis agency, the
battered women agency and the
criminal justice agency where
she was told that "if he were black, he
would have been convicted/
arrested right away."

NY Editor Killed

The editor of a New York
based Haitian newspaper who
had criticized the Carib-
bean country's regime was
assassinated as he returned
home from work, and his son
charged his father was killed
by "political opponents from
Haiti." Firmin Joseph was
killed outside his home af-
ter being threatened on many
previous occasions.

ATT Workers

Everyone knows about the
strike this summer at ATT,
where strikers were picket-
ing over job security. The
best pickets were women, wo-
men operators in particular,
who are facing an industry
which is planning to declare
them "surplus labor." It is
just the beginning of some-
thing in that industry and
in the economy as a whole,
because the whole purpose of
ATT divestiture is to push
to the limit this technical
revolution in the economy.
Their newest concept is
called telecommuting which
is a return to cottage in-
dustry. What that means is
that with a computer you
don't need a boss, they have
a record of everything you
do, people can work from
their home, and it is being
touted as the answer to
child care and the preserva-
tion of the family. And, of
course, this will end any
responsibility to have un-
ionized workers.

High Death Tech

A new ABC series, Blue
Thunder, based loosely on
the movie of the same name
stars a high-tech helicopter
operated by a team super-
vised by a division of the
Justice Department. Though
no such helicopter actually
exists in real life, its
individual components are
real and employed by the mil-
itary. The chopper can "see"
in the dark, "hear" a con-
versation from 10,000 feet
above where it is taking
place and do visual and
aural surveillance through
walls. Two added devices
available from the military
but rejected by ABC, were
the ability to be voice-
activated for all commands
and a periscope that resem-
bles a man's head. A produc-
tion executive deemed these
items "too impossible for
an audience to accept."

Bankrupt Court

In the early 1970s very
few women ever filed for
bankruptcy but now 30% of the
personal bankruptcies are wo-
men, usually with dependent
children. A bill now in con-
gress, and heavily supported
by the American Bankers Ass-
ociation and others in the
credit industry, will
make it more difficult for
individuals to file for bank-
ruptcy, but would not change
laws covering corporate bank-
ruptcy. For individuals, this
will mean that people must
adhere to a specific schedule
of debt repayment set up by
a judge, which will result in
a system of involuntary serv-
itude, as future wages can
be garnished.
