Silkwood Judgment Is $10.5 Million

The Question Remains:

Vicki Piotter

A federal jury awarded the three
children of the late Karen Silkwood
$10.5 million May 18th, finding that
the Kerr McGee Corp. was negligent in
its operation of a nuclear fuel plant
where Silkwood worked when she was
contaminated with plutonium.

The three-woman/three-man jury that
returned the verdict of $10 million
in punitive damages and $505,000 in
actual damages rejected the company's
claim that Karen Silkwood stole plu-
tonium and took it to her home to
spike her urine samples to back up
her claims of unsafe working condi-
tions at the plant.

It is the first time a US nuclear
products firm has been found liable
for radioactive contamination that
occurred outside its plant.

"I'm finally glad they got Karen's
name cleared," said her mother. "She
was only trying to help those people
get a clean plant."

History of Cover-up

A big question still remains: who
killed Karen Silkwood? The night
Silkwood died, she was en route to
meet with a New York Times reporter
to turn over documentation that Kerr
McGee was falsifying its nuclear fuel
rod quality reports. That night, Nov-
ember 13, 1974, Silkwood was found
dead in her overturned car on an Ok-
lahoma highway, having apparently
been forced off the road, into her
fatal collision, by the car following
her.

Several inquiries into her death
were thwarted by the intentional re-
fusals on the part of the FBI and
Kerr McGee to cooperate with invest-
igating authorities. Most recent
inquiries are being obstructed with
the all-too-familiar claim of "Nation-
al Security."

During the last few months of her
life, Silkwood was very active within
her union, the Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers. Her union put her in
charge of the safety and health
committee at the Kerr McGee facility.

During her data collection, she
found that workers at the plant were
being exposed to unsafe levels of
radiation. In September of 1974, she
went to Washington DC to testify her
findings at a secret meeting of the
Atomic Energy Commission. The Commis-
sion said it couldn't do anything
unless Silkwood offered further
proof.

Silkwood continued her work of
collecting documented evidence about
alarming plant hazards for upcoming
contract negotiations, the Commission
and the national press.

Collecting Evidence

All the while, she continued her
work as a laboratory analyst at Kerr
McGee, checking various fuel mix-
tures. Fearful of its toxicity, Silk-
wood was careful when handling plu-
tonium. However, during a routine
check for skin contamination on Nov-
ember 5, 1974, Silkwood registered
a radiation level 40 times the amount
that is considered safe. Before
leaving work, her radiation level
was made safe through the standard
procedure of scrubdown with a wire
brush and mixture of detergent,
bleach and potassium.

The next morning, another test
showed she had been contaminated
again. The third morning a nasal
smear was conducted and showed plut-
onium contamination was internal.
The contamination was not from an
accidental spill on her job, which
could have conceivably occurred,
but the source was from where she
least expected it—her home.

Silkwood was rushed along with two
friends to the Los Alamos Medical
Facility in New Mexico and all were
treated for contamination at the
government nuclear reservation there.

While they were being treated, a
company decontamination team was sent
to her apartment. Their investigation
showed that the highest level of con-
tamination was in the food in her
refrigerator. (The decontamination
team later admitted to going through
Silkwood's personal letters, papers
and diary, as well.)

The evening Silkwood returned from
Los Alamos she was set to meet with
David Burnham of the New York Times
and a union representative from Wash-
ington in Oklahoma City. Jean Jung,
one of the last of Silkwood's friends
to see her alive, testified at the
trial that she saw a folder, note-
books and other materials Silkwood
was carrying moments before her death.
Jung quoted Silkwood as saying, "I
have my proof."

Silkwood never arrived for the
meeting. Hours after the fatal crash,
a union-hired investigator examined
the car at the scene and concluded
that fresh marks on her rear bumper
indicated she had been run off the
road. Based on this report, the Atom-
ic Workers union believes she was
murdered in the attempt to steal the
documents she was carrying.

But other reports of the accident
differ; the Oklahoma Highway Patrol
called it a simple case of the driver
asleep at the wheel.

The notebooks and other materials
that a police officer said were
scattered inside the smashed car have
never been found.

Silkwood’s Concern

Karen Silkwood was not only involved
with safety issues on her job; she
was also concerned with the larger
question of safety of the public
from nuclear accidents. Testimony at
the trial and other investigations
show many of the concerns Silkwood
was attempting to make public know-
ledge:

-Silkwood and other workers, accord-
ing to plant supervisors, were
assigned to work areas where radia-
tion levels exceeded legal limits.

-Silkwood and other workers were ord-
ered in 1974 to step up production,
and at the same time, according to
a GAO report, safety checks of fuel
rods were being intentionally fals-
ified. These same rods are now being
stored for future use in fast breed-
er reactors.

-A plant supervisor testified that he
was ordered to divert bomb-grade
nuclear materials from the govern-
ment stockpiles to the Kerr McGee
stockpiles. The government has re-
ported 40 pounds of plutonium
missing.

-Testimony from Kerr McGee officials
has revealed that Kerr McGee was il-
legally tipped off to upcoming
“surprise” safety inspections by
Atomic Energy Commission officials.

-Silkwood co-worker Ron Hammock testi-
fied that officials never told him
that uranium and plutonium were dang-
erous substances. That, in fact, he
had learned only a few months ago
that radiation contamination causes
cancer; he said employees had so
little fear of radioactive uranium
that they once playfully threw
chunks of it at each other.

Burning Questions

The settlement of the civil suit
on behalf of Silkwood's children
only found Kerr McGee with liability
for Silkwood's contamination. The
case of Karen Silkwood is far from
resolved; what happened to her fold-
ers and notebook containing proof of
safety record falsification; what
about the indication that she was
forced to her death by the car behind
her; how did radiation become concen-
trated in her apartment; and finally,
who killed Karen Silkwood?

Kerr McGee and the FBI must still
be forced to answer the charges of
conspiracy to violate Silkwood's
civil rights through wiretapping,
surveillance, harassment, violence
and cover-up.

The quest for truth into the death
of Karen Silkwood is serving much
more than the original purpose of
bringing justice for a woman who
dared; it is opening the eyes of the
public to the dangers of nuclear
power and is involving everyone in
the question: how far are nuclear
companies like Kerr McGee willing to
go to cover up practices that are
not only unsafe to workers, but to
the country as a whole?

Wanrow’s Case Over; Crigler's Case Uncertain

In order to forego the pain of a sec-
ond trial, Yvonne Wanrow pled guilty
to second degree assault charges and
was sentenced to five years probation
on April 26th.

Wanrow had been battling the Washing-
ton State Courts for seven years over
her right to self-defense to protect
herself and her children from attack.

In her statement to the court, Wan-
row said, "These past seven years
have been like a prison sentence. The
many activities undertaken by the many
people from throughout the nation and
abroad have helped me this far. I in-
tend to now return home to take care
of my children and to make plans for
the future.

Given the chance, I would fulfill my
duty as a human being on this earth to
construct a better future for us all,
not destroy what exists.”

The Washington State Courts had
been aware of the threats made by
Wesler, as he tried to follow through
with his threats:

In the course of her many court
dates, a friend-of-the-court brief
was filed which offered an analysis
of Wanrow's plight. It said, "Yvonne
Wanrow was a woman caught up in a web
of events which inevitably led to vio-
lence and might have been averted had
she been able to rely on the protect-
ion of society...If Wesler had been
taken into custody, even temporarily,
or if the police had promised surveil-
lance of the neighborhood in order to
reassure the women they were being pro-
tected, the tragedy would have been
averted.”

Another Washington State woman,
Sharon Crigler, who had asked for pol-
ice protection, is facing the uncer-
tainty which is finally over for Wan-
row. Crigler, a 22-year-old black wel-
fare mother, was sentenced to 10 years
in prison for shooting her ex-boyfriend
when he attempted to break into her
house in a clear act of vengeance.

Initially, the police decided that
the shooting was justifiable homicide.
It was not until a week after the
shooting in 1977 that Sharon was charg-
ed with first-degree murder. The basis
for the murder charge was that the
crime was premeditated, because 1)
Sharon had called the police earlier
that night to request protection,
meaning she recognized she was in a
potentially dangerous situation and
2) she had a gun on her person.

The jury that convicted Sharon Crig-
ler in September 1977 was all white,
and two-thirds male. The night after
her conviction, one of the jurors said
in the presence of witnesses, "I just
convicted some Nigger bitch for shoot-
ing her old man."

On April 17th, lawyers for Sharon

Military Madness

The monster of compulsory military
service has again raised its ugly
head. This time, however, some of
the bills to be considered by the
House include automatic registration
of young women between the ages of
18 and 26.

Already, groups are mobilizing in
resistance to the draft. In Colorado,
contact Cornerstone Justice and
Peace Center (Registration and Draft
Information), 940 Emerson, Denver,
CO 80218.

The first bills are scheduled to
be presented in Congress on June 10,
so there is time to register your
opposition with your local US repres-
entative. Call, write, or better yet,
send a telegram.
