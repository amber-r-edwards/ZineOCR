Women Workers Strike For  
Higher Wages And Job Security  

Women workers have been on strike  
at Vernon Graphics in South San Fran-  
cisco since July 17. They are fight-  
ing for their first union contract  
after having voted to join Office  
and Professional Employees Union,  
Local 3.  

Vernon Graphics is a nationwide  
data processing corporation which has  
exclusive contracts with the Pacific  
Telephone Company and their counter-  
parts throughout the country.  

The strike was called when the em-  
ployer refused demands for a union  
security clause, a workable senior-  
ity system, and cost of living clause.  

The workers, who are data entry op-  
erators, mailing and logging clerks,  
and computer operators, have had no  
job security and suffer from gross  
inequality in wage rates. Employees  
with two or three years service are  
paid less than newly hired workers.  

Promotions, demotions, and dischar-  
ges are made at the whim of the em-  
ployer. New workers have been kept  
on temporary status for more than  

a year, earning no vacation time.  
Wages range from $2.75 per hour to  
$3.50 per hour.  

The 50 to 60 strikers, almost all  
of them women, are determined to hold  
out for a union contract. As one  
member of the negotiating committee  
said, “The Vernon Graphics lawyer  
told us we were a bunch of naive  
girls. We're out to prove ourselves.  
We won't accept a 'kiss ass' system.  
We want union security, seniority,  
and a decent living wage."  

The sisters need support for their  
picket lines, 6:30 am - 10 pm at Vernon  
Graphics, 226 Miller Avenue, South  
San Francisco. For further informa-  
tion call 777-3444, OPEU office.

Women Kept Out of Mines  

EARTH NEWS—In Sweden's iron ore mines  
a serious controversy has developed  
over the job rights of women versus  
potentially serious health hazards.  
The Swedish Mine Workers Federation  
has just turned down a proposal from  
the country's Labor Market Board to  
allow women to work underground in  
Sweden's mines. But the union says  
the capability of women to do mining  
work is not an issue in its decision.  
The Miner's Union says the question

is not so much a matter of difficult  
physical work, because technical pro-  
gress has eliminated the worst of the  
manual labor. Instead, the union  
says its objection is the possibility  
of genetic danger, which women might  
be exposed to underground. The union  
says that not enough is known about  
the effects such gases as radon could  
have on children which women miners  
might bear in the future.  

The union says it will not be will-  
ing to hire women miners until medi-  
cal experts guarantee there is no dan-  
ger of deformed children being born  
in Swedish mining communities as a  
result.  

The issue is complicated by the fact  
that, in many mining communities,  
there are no other job opportunities  
for women, and the companies fear they  
will lose their male employees if wo-  
men cannot find some kind of work. A  
further question, as yet unanswered,  
is the extent to which exposure to  
dangerous gases affects the male min-  
er's genetic input into children.  

Although the issue is an increasingly  
complicated one, some women alread-  
y are working in underground mess  
halls and canteens at various Swedish  
iron ore mines. The union says it  
wants to hire more women, but it's  
standing firm in its position that  
all new female employees should stay  
above ground for health reasons.

Feds Believed to be Involved In Break-Ins  

EARTH NEWS—A series of break-ins,  
closely resembling the FBI's infamous  
black bag jobs, have hit two west  
coast feminist organizations over the  
past few months.  

In San Diego, the Center for Women's  
Studies and Services (CWSS) was bro-  
ken into over the weekend of April  
7th. CWSS, which publishes a national  
news-journal called the Feminist Bul-  
letin, had its mailing lists, mailing  
labels and membership files stolen.  
Although the center housed valuable  
office equipment and money, none was  
stolen. According to the center's  
spokeswoman, Lisa Cobbs, the robbers  
were obviously “interested in informa-  
tion on the feminist community.” Who-  
ever broke into the center, she added,  

knew what they were doing, because  
they simply removed a pane of glass,  
and went directly to the correct files  
and rolodexes.  

In Los Angeles, the offices of Sis-  
ter, the west coast feminist newspa-  
per, were vandalized in mid-June.  
Just before an issue of Sister was to  
be mailed, someone broke into the  
newspaper's office, tore down stacks  
of old papers, threw around toilet  
paper, and dumped the newspaper's  
mailing list onto the floor. Some  
mailing labels were later found mis-  
sing. What's more, The Women's Center  
where Sister is housed, was vandali-  
zed a week before the newspaper's off-  
ice was trashed.

Commission on the Observance of IWY  

Proves To Be Nothing More Than Farce  

Chris Lundberg  

The invitation said, "...on behalf  
of the President I would like to in-  
vite you or your representative to  
the White House at which time the  
President will accept the final re-  
port of the National Commission on  
the Observance of International Wo-  
men’s Year." I was only a represent-  
ative, one among hundreds in Jacque-  
line Kennedy's garden on July 1st.  
There were a few men present, a few  
minority women, and a few from the  
armed forces - including 3 women in  
the Marine band that played.  

Waiting in the hot sun to get  
clearance to enter (thought for sure  
I'd be stopped right there), I over-  
heard one woman say, "I'd feel like  
a snob if I didn't accept, but I  
wouldn't be missed, either.” Most  
women were in their summer dresses,  
a few of us ventured forth in pants,  
I saw a couple of women carrying  
gloves, and several women without  
nylons - have we come a long way?  

I was upset at the political over-  
tones, a lot of women wearing "Women  
for Ford" buttons, or "Keep Betty in  
the White House"; one woman wore a  
T-shirt with "I'm for Ford" (of  
course she was interviewed on tele-  
vision).  

Jill Rukelshaus, the outgoing Pres-  
iding Officer of the Commission,  
appointed by Ford in April, 1975,  
presented the report with 115 recom-  
mendations to the President. The re-  
port is titled, "To form a more  
perfect union, justice for American  
women." The President in his speech  
mispronounced the name of Elizabeth  
Athanasahos, the new Presiding Off-  
icer, but did ask the black woman  
who is the new second in command to  
come to the platform. He used the  
occasion to announce that just that  
morning (coincidence?) he had charg-  
ed the Attorney General to review  
the US Code to see what sections  
were sex-based, as we cannot wait  
for the ERA. He talked about remov-  
ing injustices for all, but not as  
charity; taxes and economic discrim-  
ination against women being the ma-  
jor two items, and he bragged about  
the legislation he signed concerning  
education and credit for women. He  
apologized for Betty not being pre-  
sent (tired from being on the cam-  

paign trail), but said that she wan-  
ted the group to be allowed to visit  
the ground and state floors of the  
White House after the cookies and  
lemonade reception on the South Lawn.  

The report itself is 382 pages  
long, divided into 7 parts. Part II  
"Today’s Realities” contains 15 pa-  
rts, ranging from Full Partnership  
for the Homemaker to Mass Media.  

Part III: "The Future", is results  
of a 1975 poll of 1,522 women in the  
U.S. with some interesting results:  
for example, 53% have heard of the  
ERA but only 20% felt informed en-  
ough to have an opinion; 43% are in  
the labor force. Me, was not in -  
cluded in their top 10 magazines.  
Occupational categories differ as to  
marital status; increased education  
does not increase proportions in  
management--1/2 of the 12% in pro-  
fessional category are nurses or  
teachers; 37% have no income of their  
own. Only 44% divorced or  
separated receive child support,  
and 2/3 had to resort to legal means  
to collect; and 57% have positive  
feelings about the women's movement.  

Part IV deals with the history and  
membership of the Commission. Part  
V are the recommendations of the Com-  
mittees and Interdepartmental Task  
Force. The committees were: Arts  
and Humanities; Child Development;  
Enforcement of Laws; ERA; Government  
Organizational Structure; Homemaker;  
Internal Interdependence; Internatio-  
nal Conventions for Women; Media;  
Rape; Reproductive Freedom; Special  
Problems of Women--no mention of les-  
bians; Women in Employment; and Women  
in Power.  

Part VI, the Appendix, gives no new  
information, but contains: What You  
Should Know About Women (comparative  
Statistics with men); Where Women  
are Now; Federal Laws Prohibiting  
Sexual Discrimination; World Plan of  
Action; Who Shall Speak for our Na-  
tion's Women; 5 Lives Who Have Touch-  
ed Mine; Public Law 94-167; ERA; Sup-  
plemental Reading Material; The Sec-  
retariat; and the IWY Bird—designed  
by Valerie Pettis to illustrate the  
theme of IWY—Equality, Development  
and Peace—the mathematical symbol  
for equality, the feminine symbol,  
and the dove of peace.
