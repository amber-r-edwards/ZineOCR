Colorado Labor Union Women Move to  
Organize the Unorganized.

Women trade unionists  
from as diverse unions as the  
United Rubber Workers, the  
American Federation of  
Teachers, the Amalgamated  
Clothing Workers and the  
American Postal Workers Un-  
ion met together September  
14 to found the Denver chapter  
of the Coalition of Labor  
Union Women (CLUW).

CLUW was founded at a  
national convention in Chica-  
go in March of this year where  
3,200 union women from 58  
national and international  
unions attended. The stated  
purposes of the organization  
are to increase women’s  
participation in their unions,  
to press for reforms for  
women through legislative  
and political action, to initiate  
affirmative action programs  
and to aid in the organizing of  
unorganized women into the  
union movement.

Since the founding conven-  
tion, women in New York, De-  

troit, Seattle, Washington  
D.C., Los Angeles and other  
cities across the country have  
successfully held founding  
conferences to establish local  
CLUW chapters. The signifi-  
cance of the organization lies  
in the fact that it brings many  
of the issues raised by the  
women’s liberation movement  
into the realm of working  
women who up until now have  
often felt that the women’s  
movement was not concerned  
with their problems. The  
Coalition hopes to give rank  
and file union women a voice  
in their unions and on their  
jobs.  
The September 14 Denver  
meeting drew about 60 women  
from about 25 different locals  
in the area. The meeting laid  
out the basic purpose of the  
organization, described the  
procedure necessary to be-  
come a chartered CLUW  
chapter, and began a discus-  
sion of the difficulties faced in  

COALITION OF LABOR UNION WOMEN  
STATEMENT OF PURPOSE  

(As adopted at the founding  
conference, March 23-24)

Of the 34 million women in  
the work force—little more  
than four million women are  
members of unions. It is  
imperative that within the  
framework of the union move-  
ment, we take aggressive  
steps to more effectively  
address ourselves to the  
critical needs of 30 million  
unorganized sisters and to  
make our unions more re-  
sponsive to the needs of all  
women, especially the needs  
of minority women who have  
been singled out for particu-  
larly blatant oppression.

Women unionists work in  
almost every industry, in  
almost every part of the  
country. Despite their geo-  
graphical, industrial and oc-  
cupational separations, union  
women share common con-  
cerns and goals.

Full equality of opportuni-  
ties and rights in the labor  
force require the full attention  
of the labor movement...and  
especially, the full attention  
of women who are part of the  
labor movement.

The primary purposes of  
this new national coalition is  
to unify all union women in a  

viable organization to deter-  
mine, first—our common  
problems and concerns, and,  
second—to develop action  
programs within the frame-  
work of our unions to deal  
effectively with our object-  
ives. Through unity of pur-  
pose, the Coalition of Labor  
Union Women will seek to  
accomplish these goals. We  
recognize that our struggle  
goes beyond the borders of  
this nation and seek to link up  
with our working sisters and  
brothers throughout the world  
through concrete action of  
international workers’ solidar-  
ity.

ORGANIZING THE  
UNORGANIZED WOMEN  
Since less than twelve  

percent of the women in  
today’s labor force are en-  
rolled in labor unions, it is  
obvious that most working  
women are suffering eco-  
nomically. Statistics clearly  
demonstrate that the union  
member enjoys higher wa-  
ges, better fringe benefits and  
working conditions and great-  
er job security than the unor-  
ganized worker. The Coalition  
of Labor Union Women seeks  
to promote unionism and to  
encourage unions to be more  

aggressive in their efforts to  
bring unorganized women  
under collective bargaining  
agreements, particularly in  
those areas where there are  
large numbers of unorganized  
and/or minority women.  
CLUW will seek to create a  
greater awareness of the  
benefits of union member-  
ship. Within our intra-, inter-,  
and emerging union structure,  
we will work to encourage  
non-union women to join us in  
the trade union movement.  
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN  
THE WORKPLACE  
Employers continue to pro-  
fit by dividing workers on  
sexual, racial and age lines.  
This encourages the segrega-  
tion of job classifications and  
results in wage and benefit  
losses to women. The power  
of unions must increasingly  
be brought to bear, through  
the process of collective  
bargaining, to correct these  
inequities. The Coalition will  
seek to encourage women,  
through their unions, to  
recognize and take positive  
action against job discrimina-  
tion in hiring, promotion,  
classification and other as-  
pects of work. Women must  
learn what their rights are  

under the law. They must  
become more knowledgeable  
of the specifics of collective  
bargaining and of the contract  
clauses and workplace  
practices which discriminate  
against them. They must be  
informed about what is and  
can be done within the labor  
movement to correct these  
situations. We seek to edu-  
cate and inspire our union  
brothers to help achieve  
affirmative action in the  
workplace.  
POLITICAL ACTION  
AND LEGISLATION  

It is imperative that union  
women, through action pro-  
grams of the Coalition,  
become more active partici-  
pants in the political and  
legislative processes of our  
union and our unions. Move-  
ment for full employment, and  
job opportunities, shorter  
work week without loss of  
pay, child care legislation, a  
livable minimum wage for all  
workers, improved maternity  
and pension benefits, im-  
proved health and safety  
coverage, expanded educa-  
tional opportunities, mass  
action for final ratification of  
the Equal Rights Amendment  
(ERA), guaranteed collective  

bargaining  

rights for all  
workers, the right to strike  

and an extension of truly  
protective legislation for all  
workers are only a few of the  
political action programs in  
which CLUW must partici-  
pate. Whenever and wherever  
possible CLUW urges all  
women to seek election to  
political office.  
PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN  

WITHIN THEIR UNIONS  

The Coalition seeks to  
inspire and educate union  
women to ensure and  
strengthen their participation,  
through full and complete  
democratic procedures, to  
encourage their leadership  
and their movement into  
policy-making roles within  
their own unions and within  
the union movement in all  
areas. The Coalition supports  
the formation of women’s  
committees and women's  
caucuses within trade unions  
wherever necessary.
