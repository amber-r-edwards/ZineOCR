The women above are from the Guerilla Army of the Poor in Guatemala (E.G.P.). "What is it
that has transformed the quiet worker in the cornfields from the provinces of Quiche and
San Marcos, into the committed guerilla warrior? What has driven the Kanjobal Indian women
to replace the loom with a weapon turned against their oppressors?" -- E.G.P.

Your government has branded us as terrorists. But the word terror-
ist no longer means to the Puerto Rican nation what it used to.
Instead of arousing fear or censure, terrorism is a call to action.
To be called a terrorist by our enemy is an honor to any citizen;
for this means he or she is fighting with a gun in their hand
against the monstrosity of the present government and the suffering

it causes.
it causes ~ Carmen Valentin, Puerto Rican Prisoner of War
