Double Jeopardy

Fulani Sunni-Ali (Cynthia
Boston), who was cleared of
involvement in the October
Brink's robbery and shooting,
was jailed again in early
December, for refusing to co-
operate with the federal
grand jury. For refusing to
cooperate, she could spend
from 18 to 24 months in jail.

Double Standards

John Gregorio, a leading
crusader against sex educa-
tion books in public libra-
ries, has been found guilty
of sexual misconduct with
an 8-year-old girl and a
teenage boy. Gregorio was
arrested last spring at
the same time he was mak-
ing headlines for his lead-
ership of Taxpayers Against
Kiddy Smut in Florida.

Just Don't Marry

A Federal Appeals Court has
ruled that “having children
is the major purpose of mar-
riage" and that Florida may
require wives to tell their
husbands before terminating a
pregnancy. At the same time,
the Court declared that ju-
veniles did not need an
adult's consent in similar
circumstances because it in-
terfered with minors' rights.

Daffy Standard

Students of the Omaha Chris-

tian School watched as their
principal set fire to a pile
of sinful publications. Among
the materials destroyed were
National Geographic, an Ani-

mals record cover, a Batman

comic and a Daffy Duck comic.

Inflammatory Eunuch

Andrew Bailey, recently ap-
pointed by Interior Secretary
James Watt to head the conser-
vation division of the U.S.
Geological Survey, wrote in
a 1979 memo, "Inflammatory
words such as disturbed, de-
vastated, defiled, ravaged,
gouged, scarred and destroyed
should not be used" in envir-
onmental impact statements.
"These are the words used by
the Sierra Club, Friends of
the Earth, environmentalists,
homosexuals, ecologists, and
other ideological eunuchs op-
posed to developing mineral
resources.

Grin & Bear It -

It seems that scientists at
the Reproductive Physiology
Unit at the National Insti-
tute of Health Veterinary Re-
sources Branch have had a
brilliant idea. Having reject-
ed as immoral the thought of
a cross between apes and hu-
mans, they propose that women
should carry ape and chimpan-
zee embryos to term in utero
instead. Why? Said Dr. Steph-
en Seager, "I think you could
find women who are serious
conservationists, who want to
help endangered animals. After
all, it would be pure chimp or
pure gorilla." He should have
been asked, Why are women to
reproduce the great apes; 

whose habitat men have destroy-

ed, who have been hunted to
near extinction by male entre-
preneurs and thrill seekers.

The Press Repressed

In an interview between
Jeremiah Denton (R-AL), head
of the Senate Subcommittee on
Security and Terrorism and
Arnaud de Borchgrave, a for-
mer editor of Newsweek, de
Borchgrave accused Mother
Jones, The Progressive, The
Soho News and The Village
Voice of being part of a So-
viet "disinformation network"
here in the U.S. The inter-
view was sent out in
cassette form, to several
hundred radio stations across
the country, postage paid for
by you and I, the taxpayers.
This is just part of the Rea-
gan Administration and his
right-wing cheerleaders ef-
fort to represent American
dissent as Soviet intrigue:
the purpose is to discredit
any criticism from the Left
as unpatriotic at best, trea-
sonous at worst.

Coors Cultivates KKK

Coors is suing, MARK, Movement
Against Racism and the Klan,
for its slide show "Unmasking
the Ku Klux Klan". In the
show they point out that the
Adolph Coors Company provides
financial support to the Ku
Klux Klan and endorses and
approves the commission of
criminal and terrorist at-
tacks against Blacks, Jews,
Hispanics and other minori-
ties by the Klan or its mem-
bers. Coors is obviously up-
set about the fact that the
boycott is still going strong
and is afraid the truth will
build support for the boy-
cott. At last a chance to
prove in court for all to see
what we, especially those of
us in CO, have known all
along about good ol' boy Joe
Coors and his Company.

Suck It To ‘Em

After Jennifer Trott was
ejected from a shopping mall
in Toronto, Canada, for nur-
sing her infant son, 50
breastfeeding mothers staged
a "Suck-in" in protest. Bou-
tique owner, Rozsika Antel,
who had Ms. Trott thrown out
insisted that breastfeeding
is a private act like urina-
ting and copulating and
should be done only in seclu-
ded places. One of the demon-
strators noted that most peo-
ple aren't offended when
they see breasts on TV or in
ads yet when they see a mo-
ther nourishing her child
they get upset.

To Serve & Protect...

On June 2nd 150 women and
children were attacked by 60
policemen with their numbers
removed when they assembled in
parliament to urge the passage
of a bill funding women's ser-
vices, including refuge or
safe houses. Without any warn-
ing or a directive to leave,
police jumped on women from
behind screens and corridors
at King's Hall, Leichhardt,
N.S.W. Australia. As Speculum
Speaks wrote, "It is not
enough that women and children
must experience domestic vio-
lence and rape in their daily
lives. They are also forced to
cope with police brutality
while trying to defend the
very organizations which give
them support against male
violence."

..The Rapist

"The policemen wouldn't
look at me. They told me to
get in the back seat of the
squad car and I did. They
stood outside talking to
these guys, even laughing
with them, and then they let
them go." The Women's Rape
Service Network in Chicago
has called a meeting in re-
sponse to this latest exam-
ple of police "competency"
in helping an 18-year-old
rape victim. In the past, po-
lice who were dismissed for
raping women were later rein-
stated. So far these 2 cops
have only been suspended from
duty. The Network is calling
for their dismissal.

Gimme Shelter

California landlords were
blacklisting leftists through
RentCheck, an affiliate of
TeleCheck Services, Inc. The
blacklist contained over one
million names, including mem-
bers of the Coalition for
Economic Survival, the Santa
Monicans for Renters' Rights,
and the Campaign for Economic
Democracy. Also, the Apartment
Assoc. of Los Angeles-Western
Cities admitted telling land-
lords they didn't have to
rent to members of those
kinds of “ultra-radical organ-
izations." In response, letters
were sent to all LA area
apartment associations and a
suit was filed against sever-
al of the largest associations
in Santa Monica. Both have
agreed to stop political
screenings.
