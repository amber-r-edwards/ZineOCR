One More Victim Of Psychiatric ‘Therapy’...

In Sept. 1978, at the age
of 14, Susan Deliman was
placed in the psychiatric
ward of St. Joseph Hospital
in Lorain, Ohio. Her doctor,
Margaret R. Read, M.D., had
diagnosed her as suffering
from an adjustment reaction
to adolescent problems, de-
pression, feeding problems,
and acne. Since early puberty
Susan had been overweight,
she had acne, she was self-
conscious and she alternated
between starvation diets and
gluttony. For nearly two
months she was under psych-
iatric care, in and out of
the hospital. To help her,
she was heavily drugged and
had 12 electroshock treat-
ments (ECT).

On Nov. 18, 1978, at home,
10 days after her release
from the psychiatric unit
and 12 days after her last
ECT, Susan took about 20
prescribed 150 mg. tablets
of Norpramin. She was found
in a coma and rushed to the
hospital but she died six
hours after taking the drug.

Norpramin, which is a tri-
cyclic antidepressant, is
controversial for its effects
on the mind. Information
given to doctors on this drug
states, "It is important that
this drug be dispensed in the
least possible quantities to
depressed outpatients, since
suicide has been accomplished
with this class of drug. Or-
dinary prudence requires that
children do not have access
to this drug...storage of
this drug in the home must be
supervised responsibly. Clin-
ical experience in the con-
current administration of
ECT and antidepressant drugs
is limited. Thus if such
treatment is essential, the
possibility of increased
risk relative to benefits
should be considered." There
is no antidote for Norpramin.

Nicholas Deliman, Susan's
father, had been against her
admittance to the hospital,
he had refused to let the
hospital give her ECT. Susan
was living with her mother,
Beverly Deliman Mahar at the
time, her parents being di-
vorced and her mother remar-
ried. She was released in a
few weeks but classmates
teased her about being in the
“nut ward" and she returned
to the hospital where Dr.
Read had Ms. Mahar sign a
consent form for ECT. In a
ten minute discussion with
Dr. Read, Ms. Mahar was told
that there might be a memory
loss for a few hours or a
headache but nothing long
term. She had no other infor-
mation about ECT.

The frontal lobes of the
brain take the brunt of dam-
age done by ECT. That would
be the same as a surgical
lobotomy and may provoke
suicide. The use on adults is
controversial according to a
director for the Center for
Study of Psychiatry in Mary-
land, to use it on children,
he called it barbaric.

Susan was given Haldol,
which contains a warning that
it should not be prescribed
for patients who are severely
depressed. Susan's parents
were never told the dangers
of any of the drugs given her
and the drugs were often
prescribed at the adult max-
imum dosage. The parents
were told that Norpramin was
a normalizer and they weren't
told to keep the medication
in their control.

When Susan was discharged
from the hospital, her doctor
was not present. When she
took the lethal dosage, her
parents called Dr. Read, but
she never talked to them.

She sent a bill after Susan's
death for $1,800.

Nestle Boycott

Infant Formula Action Coali-
tion

Nestle Boycott organizers
from across the U.S. meeting
in the 5th National Confer-
ence of the Infant Formula
Action (INFACT) in Minneapol-
is, July 10-12, pledged to
step-up the scope and inten-
sity of the international
Nestle Boycott. The confer-
ence, held on the 4th anni-
versary of the Boycott, cele-
brated major victories of
this grassroots campaign
including:

-Announcement by the Nestle
Co. that its profits declined
by 16% in 1980. Industry ob-
servers believe the boycott
and publicity contributed
substantially.

-In May, formulation and
passage of the World Health
Organization International
Code of Marketing of infant
formulas. The Code calls upon
the baby formula industry to:

1) Stop giving free formula
samples.

2) Eliminate "milk nurses."

3) Halt direct promotion to
mothers.

4) Place warnings on labels.

5) End commissions to
salespeople to increase
sales.

6) Restrict promotion to
the health profession.

118 nations supported the
code in Geneva; only the
Reagan administration opposed
it.

-Defeat of the nomination
of Ernest Lefever as Assis-
tant Secretary of State for
Human Rights following reve-
lation of his Ethics & Public
Policy Center obtaining
$35,000 from Nestle for an
attack against the infant
formula campaign.

-Overwhelming votes in the
U.S. House (301-100) and
Senate (89-2) on separate
resolutions censuring the

Big Mama

America held hostage (day 253)

Reagan hit the airwaves again! His smiling face and fork-
ed tongue were beamed into the homes of 2 million plus. He
brought tidings of bad times to come, of more social cuts,
of the abolition of the departments of energy and education.
Reagan sent his right wing Watt to the West to check out
the federal lands waiting to be stripped and wasted. The
camera panned in for close-ups of Reagan showing his sin-
cere face. Reagan's solution to problems caused by social
cutbacks is the institution of a new age of voluntarism -
which, under Reagan's plan, may get government out of our
personal lives, but would let big business in. While Nan
See Reagan was out shopping for new White House china at
$1,000 per place setting, Ron Knee was finding ways to
save bucks by axing $1.2 billion from the food stamp pro-
gram and food programs for the elderly. While White House
dinner guests gaze at their reflections on the 24 karat
gold-edged dinnerware (guaranteed to shine regardless of
what detergent they are washed in), Reagan searches for
ways to produce and stockpile the neutron (kill people -
preserve property) bomb. The neutron bomb is already kill-
ing people by killing medical programs, daycare centers,
food programs, CETA jobs and subsidized housing. Among Ray-
gan's proposed casualties are 4.89 million women who will
lose unemployment insurance benefits, 900,000 women cut
from the food stamp program, 750,000 women to be dropped
from Medicaid, 360,000 women cut from ADC roles while an-
other 232,000 have benefits slashed,
jobs from cutbacks in public service employment, 32,000
households headed by women will lose funding for subsidized
housing and 700,000 women and children to be cut out of
WIC program which offers food and counseling.

In an attempt to ensure that more po-
tential Reaganomics casualties are
available for future abuse,
the gun has pushed his Human Life
Bill through committee stages in the US Senate. The bill
denies all abortions, IUDs
and progesterone pills by de-
fining abortion and birth con-
trol as murder.
And so it goes-

Deliman struggled for three
years trying to find out the
facts of her death. It took
months just to get Susan's
medical records and informa-
tion from the US Food and
Drug Administration on the
drugs and ECT equipment. It
took more months looking up
medical terminology and un-
derstanding it. Last year
Deliman filed a $44.5 million
lawsuit charging wrongful
death against the hospital,
Read, Merrell Dow Pharmaceut-
icals (maker of Norpramin),
manufacturers of ECT equip-
ment and the pharmacy in
Amherst, Ohio which dispensed
the drug. He tried to get an
injunction against St. Joseph
to stop the use of ECT equip-
ment but failed. He would
like to see Norpramin taken
off the market.
