letters home to mama

and men. I don't think male
and female encounters with
the divine are so different
that we need to separate off
into exclusive rituals.

However, I agree with
much of what you said, and
appreciate the care and
thinking that went into your
article.

Mothers Without

Dear BMR:

Enclosed is my check to re-
new—finally! I have enjoyed
every issue, and feel I have
learned a lot about the lives
of many women in circumstances
both similar to and different
from my own. I particularly
enjoyed the issue dealing with
women in prison, and the article
in July BMR about mothers
without custody. I am glad a
group has been formed to as-
sist women in this situation.

I would like BMR readers to
be aware of other groups to
help mothers who do not have
custody of their children not
because of divorce, but be-
cause of adoption. Like many
other oppressed women, we who
are now coming out of our clo-
sets, to expose the corrupt
adoption system, and to seek
the children we have never
forgotten, or ceased to love.

Most people think of adopt-
ion as a benevolent institu-
tion, where everyone wins—
the “unwed mother" gets rid
of the incriminating evidence
of her sin, and goes on as if
the birth had never occurred,
the perfect hand-picked ster-
ile couple get a child they
can pretend is theirs, and the
adoptee grows up grateful to
everyone with no questions,
no pain, and no "mark of illeg-
itimacy". That is the adopt-
ion myth. The reality, for
many mothers who have lost
children, and for children who
grow up with no heritage, is
often a nightmare.

Most babies who are given
up for adoption are surrend-
ered not because they are un-
wanted or unloved, but be-
cause their mothers—usually
single, middle-class young
women—are offered no altern-
ative, and are used by the sys-
tem to produce a saleable
product, white-healthy-infants
for couples who can pay.

Your excellent issue on wo-
men who are locked up missed
one institution that should
be included with prisons and
mental hospitals—"Homes" for

unwed mothers. Thousands of
helpless, frightened young
mothers have been incarcerat-
ed in these places, brain-
washed into believing that a-
doption was their only choice,
then heartlessly discarded as
soon as the "product" was de-
livered and the adoption papers
were signed. The people who
run these "Homes" have now
linked up with Right-to-Life
groups, to remove the choice
of abortion for women who are
truly unwilling or unable to
care for a child, and to keep
up the supply of infants for
adoption. Feminists should be
aware of their unsavory coali-
tion.

My own story is typical of
many young women who were
used by the adoption systems,
but until I met other women
who had gone through the same
thing, I felt that I was
"crazy" not to have "adjusted"
as I was told I would. I hope
that other women who have lost
children to adoption will read
this, and realize that they are
not crazy or alone.

I was a college student in
the late 60s involved in the
anti-war and civil rights move-
ments, idealistic and naive. The
father of my child was my 1st
lover, the love of my life,
who I truly believed would
marry me. When he did not, and
my parents would not accept
my “illegitimate” child, I
fell apart. It was then that
I was introduced to the mani-
pulations of an adoption agen-
cy and a psychiatrist whom I
trusted, because they were
authority figures who knew
best and I was just a "bad girl"
who had nothing to offer her
child but love. Their "coun-
seling" convinced me that the
only thing I could do for my
son was to give him away, that
it would be "selfish" to keep
him. The same "counseling" al-
most killed me, destroying
what little self-esteem I had
left at that point, and leaving
life-long scars. What happen-
ed to me is not an isolated
case—it is typical and it is
still happening to young women
every day.

In the past several years,
women like myself have gotten
together, both for mutual sup-
port and consciousness raising,
and to try to change the adopt-
ion system. Many of us, includ-
ing me, have located our lost
children, not to steal them
away from their adoptive fam-
ilies, not to interfere in
their lives, but to assure
ourselves that they are indeed
alive and well and when they are
older to offer information a-
bout ourselves and their heri-
tage, information that can be
vital to their self-esteem and
in the case of medical prob-
lems, to their very lives.

While most of our children
have been found alive and in
good homes, some were never
adopted, some were sent back
into foster care and some were
rejected as teenagers by the
adoptive family because of
problems with drugs, alcohol
or emotional disturbance.

Adoption is not the perfect
solution, either for single
mothers or for their children.
Adoption is another means of
punishing "deviant" women,
who have children outside
of marriage and of perpetua-
ting the patriarchal family.
The adoption system views
women as "machines" to pro-
duce healthy white infants and
views children as a commodity
needed to fill a demand.

Mothers who have lost
children to adoption should
join Origins, POB 105, Oak-
hurst, NJ 07755 and Concerned
United Birthparents, POB 573
Milford, Mass. 01757. Both
groups support open records
for those separated by adop-
tion and choices rather than
coercion for young pregnant
women.

I am one of the Co-Founders
of Origins, and have included
an information sheet which I hope
the BMR collective will make
available to any interested
women in your area. Please
feel free to contact me for
more info and thank you for let-
ting other women know about
our group.

P.S. We have just assisted a
mother whose children were
taken from her while she was
imprisoned and her daughter, who
was rejected by 2 adoptive fa-
milies, may soon be home with
her. There is hope!

Minds At Work

Dear Womyn:

Thank you so much for your
Where We're At column this
month. I was enraged at that
John Brown Anti-Klan insertion
in last month's issue—for all
the reasons you stated in
"Where We're At" and because of
something in it about "it's our
turn to lead" or "follow our
leadership to prove you're
anti-racist" (I can't find the
insert to quote it.) I don't
want a leader or leaders. It's

-Val Vaughan/BMR

time for us all to be respons-
ible and lead ourselves.

You know what I like? (No!
wrong answer). Womyn who can
re-think things and say, “I made
a mistake." and not take years
to do it! Hope someday I can
be like you. Anyway, instead
of cancelling my subscription
I'll be anxiously awaiting
next month's issue. Letting
us in on the workings of your
minds is probably the most
radical and dangerous thing to
do. Thanks.

Ah-Oh! I should have mailed
this letter before I read this
month's issue any further.
(July '82) About the article
on page 12—"Hurry Tomorrow".
What a crock of shit! What a
crock of sexist shit!

First of all, because of the
excellent coverage of Psych-
iatric violence, which has
appeared in many feminist news
journals during the past two
years (BMR included) I know
that the majority of psychia-
tric patients are womyn, so
here we have a film about
poor male patients!

Then we find out that one of
these poor male inmates' (a 19
year old) only crime was that
"of trespassing on his mother's
property, after she had barred
him from the house". Now,
while I'm totally opposed to
psychiatrists and psychiatric
prisons, I would have drowned
him and the psychiatrists in
self-defense! Males demand
lifetime access! Throw up!
Totally! Gag me with a spoon!
Barf out!

Also the filmmaker, a male,
says that “several nervous
young womyn"—"psychiatric
technician students fresh out
of high school" think he's an
inmate. I can just see him
there so superior as he is.
That's the main problem. I
think he needs drowning too!

P.S. Don't use my letter un-
less you leave it intact—

Editors are fascists!
