Value of Therapy

Dear BMR,

The title of Nancy Schiff's article
"How Therapy Is Damaging to Women"
disturbed me. It should have read
"How Therapy Can Be Damaging to Women."
I hate to think of a woman deciding a-
gainst doing therapy because of this
attitude among many feminists. It is
hard enough to admit that one needs
help. Blanket statements against it
deny the very real and vital healing
that therapy can and often does pro-
vide.

Many therapists are indeed guardians
of the status quo, and many are them-
selves mentally unhealthy. However, a
good therapist can help a woman undo
a lifetime of self-hatred and destruc-
tive patterns. This is happening to me.

Six months ago I was paralyzed by
despair. I wanted nothing more than a
complete revolution of consciousness
and massive changes - these are abso-
lutely essential. However, I myself
was too miserable to have the energy
to work for these changes. Following a
speech I heard in which a vice-admiral
fairly high in the military hierarchy
said that there will be a nuclear war,
I lost all hope. I cried off and on
for days until a friend persuaded me
to see his therapist. I said that the
arms race and militarism and the whole
mentality was the problem, not me, but
he pointed out that a political activ-
ist who is not together isn't a very
good example and people can easily
write her off. I would defeat my own
purposes unless I got myself together.

What I hadn't been able to see was
that part of my total attention to so-
ciety came from a denial of my own
problems. Yes, society is sick to
death and it makes us sick. But I was
out of touch with my feelings and un-
aware of things that were unconscious-
ly motivating me, such as parental in-
fluences and the poor self-image that
my childhood experiences created in me.
Until I started working through my
problems, I could never hope to be ef-
fective in what I chose to do - I was
too unhappy and down on myself. Those
are not helpful feelings for a revolu-
tionary.

Because society is rotten and must
be transformed does not exclude my
having developed unhealthy ways of
perceiving myself, relating to others,
etc. I must understand what my life
has done to me in order to change
those things that are unhealthy, make
me miserable, and tie up my energy and
my ability to work. It is extremely
difficult for me to see myself clear-
ly. I need a therapist right now to
help me.

My therapist is a heterosexual white
male who supports my lesbian-feminism
and is helping me to get rid of guilt
and self-hatred (which do not stem
from my lesbianism). He is more sup-
portive of me than even some lesbian
feminists, who can give me guilt trips
if I ever like a man. My therapist do-
esn't judge me - he just wants me to
understand and be true to myself.

Other Side of Therapy

BMR,

Congratulations on your first is-
sue as a team. I thoroughly enjoyed
it. You asked for letters on what
we'd like to see--so here goes.

The article on therapy was basi-
cally very good--however, it would be
interesting to present the other side
of feminist and/or lesbian counseling.
Interviewing some of the ladies in
our community, some consumer informa-
tion on cost in our area, screening
a therapist (how does one go about
selecting a therapist "counselor" so
one doesn't get ripped off, how does
one know if one is getting ripped off
so one can terminate and find another
therapist?).

Although therapy has been and
still is damaging, I feel it doesn't
have to be; ground rules are essen-
tial--why are you going? Do you
really want to grow or are you going
because you are being pressured?

Have a contract with yourself on what
you hope to achieve.

Thank you for listening and help-
ing me grow.

Fort Collins Events

Dear BMR,

Writing to let you know how great
your journal is. I look forward to
receiving BMR each month. I'm new to
Colorado and enjoy learning of events
in the calendar section; unfortunately
I've never seen any feminist happen-
ings such as coffee houses, groups,
etc. in the Fort Collins area. I
would like to see any articles rela-
ting to heterosexual married women
and mothers, who are also lesbians.
Naturally, I realize this area repre-
sents a microcosm of lesbianism and
possibly not of interest to the major-
ity of your readers.

Sincerely,
An Avid Reader

Editor's note: Would someone from
Fort Collins like to send us items
for our calendar? If so, we will
include them in our calendar.

Articles of Interest

Dear Sisters,
I especially like your hot briefs,
and sometimes your in-depth articles.
In this last issue “Surviving! Three
Greats", "The First Conference on Porn
ography" and the review of Mary Daly's
new book were especially interesting.

Issue on Health

Dear Sisters,

I thought your last issue on "Women
and Health" was excellent. I particu-
larly enjoyed the article on therapy.
I am in therapy myself at the present
time. I do have a woman therapist
that I like.

I lived in Colorado for 7 years. I
have many friends in Denver.

I work 2 days a week at the Women's
Center. I take my issues of BMR there
so that other women can read them, too.

Sincerely,
Yvonne Mattingly

Tenants Rights

Dear Collective,

Picked up the April issue of BMR
and found it well worth reading. The
article on Tenants Rights was very
apropos--a current problem of mine.
However, when I called the “Lawyer
Reference Service," I found the woman
who answered unhelpful almost to the
point of being rude. Too bad there
isn't a consumer-oriented or "alter-
native" yellow pages for professional
services.

Editor's note: Turn to page 17 of this
issue for more helpful advice and
telephone numbers on tenant's rights.

Up and Kicking

Dear Sisters,

Keep up the good work. I am so
happy you are up and kicking again.
One never fully appreciates a dear
friend like Big Mama until she almost
goes down.

Hanging in There

Dear BMR,

Glad to see you are still hanging
in there. Your last issue looked
like it was put together by someone
who spent some time on layout and
paste up--looked good! Content was
interesting as usual.

Best wishes,
Linda Bauer
