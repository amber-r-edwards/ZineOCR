Surviving the Chaos:  
Clarity, Unity & Relevance  

Jackie St. Joan  

— In its November 16, 1974  
issue, Majority Report, a  
feminist newspaper published in  
New York, revealed its bleak  
financial situation, and  
questioned: Why don’t feminists  
support the women’s move-  
ment? In an insightful analysis of  
the “death wish” in the move-  
ment, the editors came up with  
four possibilities: 1) Non-support  
of movement projects by women  
with money; 2) Preoccupation  
with hedonistic pursuits; 3)  
Tendency to drive out the people  
we need most; and 4) General  
desire to fail.  

— Sister, a feminist paper  
published in Los Angeles, citing  
many women’s businesses and  
projects which are failing,  
printed an interview with the  
owner of the Sisterhood  
Bookstore, questioning her  
about the bookstore’s finances.  
(Jan. '75) Gahan Kelley replied  
that women’s studies programs  
on campus are weak and that,  
anyway, the women are  
purchasing their books  
elsewhere (thus contributing to  
Sisterhood’s demise). She con-  
tinued, “The women’s move-  
ment is largely theoretical and  
based on personal politics and  
now that the whole country is on  
the verge of a depression it isn't  
clear what the movement can  
offer new women in terms of the  
bread-and-butter issues they  
need to survive, like child care  
centers or jobs.”  

— The Lesbian Tide in L.A. has  
suspended publication tem-  
porarily because its workers are  
“burned out” and they are  
searching for new structures  
within which to work without  
dissipating all of their energy.  
The Tide has also expanded  
editorially to include articles  
which speak to the economic  
situation, stating that Lesbians  
are workers who are strongly  
affected by the economy, and  
need to be prepared to take  
leadership in economic  
struggles which will come about  
in this country.  

— Meanwhile, Quest, a  
feminist quarterly published in  
Washington, D.C., in its first two  
issues, has been analyzing the  
lack of overall organization in the  
Women’s movement, and the  
movement's difficulties in deal-  
ing with questions of money,  
fame, and power. Arguing for a  
recognition of economic realities  
by feminists, for more concrete  
goals, strategies, and  
organizational forms within the  
movement, Emily Medvec asks:  
“Will we trade our feminist con-  
sciousness and sexual loyalty for  
the false promises of capitalism  
or will we dare to bite the hand  
that feeds us?”  

Confusion in Denver  

What is happening on a  
nationwide basis is also happen-  
ing locally. BMA is challenged  
for its own inconsistencies —  
printing an article entitled,  
“Women in Chile Brutally Tor-  
tured,” right next to an article on  
“assertiveness training” in  
which an Esalen trainee stated,  
“Humanists accentuate the  
positive. Life is full of joy, so en-  
joy!” The Women’s Center  
Coalition is down to three  
members, and a center has not  
yet appeared in 6 months of dis-  
cussion. The Lesbian Task Force  
has not been heard from for  
many months. The Coalition on  
Sexual Assault, purged of its  
more radical elements, has been  
divided and weakened. Women  
in Transition, a shelter home for  
women and children, seems to  
be unclear as to whether it is a  
feminist institution or not.  
Women’s social and cultural  
events are fairly well attended,  
but few have time for  

organizational meetings or  
political necessities.  

The confusion that is manifest  
locally in the women’s move-  
ment is also manifest in  
women’s personal lives.  
Feminists are asking themselves  
how the women’s movement  
relates to the racism that has  
been exposed in recent busing  
controversies, here in Denver as  
well as in Boston. What is a  
feminist analysis of the current  
economic situation — the in-  
flated food prices, rising un-  
employment, the energy crisis?  
Does the women’s movement  
offer any solutions to the  

problem of hunger facing the  
world community? Is the  
women’s movement relevant,  
beyond one’s own sense of  
belonging to a community?  

Crisis of Relevance  

The women’s movement is go-  
ing through a crisis of relevance.  
The examples set forth above are  
merely symptoms of the diffu-  
sion of energies and the confu-  
sion which currently exists in  
the movement. What is needed  
is a convergence of energy, a  
focusing in by feminists as a  
group, and a renewal of local ef-  
forts around a unified system of  
goals. The women’s movement  
is at a turning point in its  
development. It could become a  
curious cultural relic,  
amorphous and internalized, or  
it could emerge as a strong, in-  
dependent, and powerful force  
in history. To accomplish the  
latter goal, the movement must  
be willing to confront the  
systems which oppress women,  
by forming a unified, principled,  
and clearly articulated political  
position, with long-term goals  
and strategies to bring about a  
feminist revolution.  

Why Now?  

There are several reasons for  
the importance of resolving this  
confusion now, namely 1) the  
economy is worsening; 2)  
history is repeating itself, and 3)  
there is a strong and dangerous  
drift towards reform within the  
women’s movement.  

The economic crisis may well  
destroy those feminist in-  
stitutions which have  
developed. The community  
usually exists on the periphery of  
the economy, and is likely to be  
among the first to suffer the  
effects of inflation and the lack of  
surplus funds in the community.  

Feminist products generally are  
more expensive than those  
produced through capitalist  
channels (books for example),  
and, as individuals' personal  
finances dwindle, many will  
purchase elsewhere than in  
feminist retail outlets. Many  
feminist organizations exist  
mainly on donations and grants,  
which are likely to become  
smaller as unemployment rates  
rise.  

Integrate Economic Issues  

Few feminists are attempting  
to explain the economic crisis  
and even fewer are organizing  
women around economic  

questions (food stamps, jobs, in-  
flation). To be effective in con-  
fronting the economy and the  
political system which supports  
it, women must work to in-  
tegrate economic issues into our  
ideology. We must be able to  
offer some answers to women  
who are questioning what is  
happening in the country and in  
the world, or we risk losing their  
support in a feminist context.  

There is also a lesson from  
history which warrants atten-  
tion. During the late 1800s, as  
feminist feelings and political  
beliefs were forming, groups of  
women from all over this country  
shared ideology and some pro-  
jects. Much of the substance of  
what they were discussing  
(marriage, family, property  
rights) was recognized by those  
women as being radical —  
radical, in the sense of “going to  
the root” of societal dilemmas.  
As 19th century feminist groups  
grew to take political action on  
their beliefs, many of the more  
radical elements of their  
programs were watered down,  
or eventually disintegrated in  
lieu of getting the vote for  
women.  

After the Vote, What?  

A new generation of suf-  
fragists emerged in the 1900s.  
These women carried on the  
struggle for the vote, but did so to  
the detriment of establishing  
any long-term goals beyond the  
vote. As a result, at least partial-  
ly, of this incompleteness of vi-  
sion, although the vote was won,  
women did not emerge as a po-  
tent force in this society.  
Statistics have shown that  
women, in general, vote pretty  
much the way that men do, and  
seldom, if ever, form a political  
block of their own. The vote  

could have been an extremely  
potent force in the political life of  
this country, if women had  
organized around programs  
broader than the vote. The win-  
ning of the vote for women was  
an empty promise of any real  
change in government.  

The struggle for the ERA may  
be seen as an example of history  
repeating itself. While some  
feminists question if the Equal  
Rights Amendment would even  
benefit women as a whole, it is  
an issue around which political  
groups have organized in this  
country. Like the vote, it may be  
an empty promise of any real  

Epstein/LNS  

change. After the vote, what?  
After the ERA, what?  

ERA - As Testing Ground  

On one level, working for the  
ERA could be a worthwhile  
feminist activity. If radical  
women joined forces with others  
working for the ERA and did so  
with a political consciousness  
that this struggle was mostly a  
tool — a testing ground for  
building forces towards organiz-  
ing women for broader goals, the  
results could be beneficial.  
However, it appears that win-  
ning the ERA is seen as an end in  
itself, and that the inquiry into  
the role of women and society is  
a limited one. A unified  
organization of feminists who  
work from an ideology that ex-  
plains to women why the world  
is in the condition that it is in,  
and how unity among women  
could change the course of  
history could transform the ERA  
issue from one of mere self-  
interest to one part of a broader  
feminist program for social and  
political revolution.  

Reformist Drift  

A third reason for resolving  
this confusion in the women’s  
movement now is that the  
current drift of the movement is  
towards reformist goals. For ex-  
ample, the National Women’s  
Political Caucus has rallied  
women from around the country  
to promote the election of more  
women to political offices.  
Groups such as this one are  
working towards fuller participa-  
tion in the patriarchy, apparently  
in their own self-interest. If this  
is not true, and these groups are  
really vying for power so that  
they may affect, and  
revolutionize patriarchal  
systems, then they should say so  
— clearly, loudly, and with  

specifics.  

The danger that is imminent is  
that groups with reformist goals  
or politically muddled goals are  
speaking for women as a group,  
and are quickly becoming the  
norm for what people expect  
from “women’s lib.” These  
groups have no analysis of  
society. They apparently speak  
for no one’s interests but their  
own. If they are allowed to speak  
for us and to represent  
themselves as speaking for the  
women's movement, it will  
become more and more difficult  
for revolutionary women to  
change that image. Reformist  
women are not the enemy, but  
their narrow vision is  
dangerous. Radicals will con-  
tinue to be discounted unless  
they come forward from a un-  
ited, principled, well-planned,  
and effective position that dis-  
tinguishes what is revolutionary  
from what is reformist.  

National Feminist Covenant  

One means by which women  
could bring about an organic  
feminist ideology, with concrete  
realistic goals and strategies  
would be through a National (or  
International) Feminist Cove-  
nant. Within the next year,  
women could meet and discuss  
ideas for working together —  
structures, goals, timetables,  
communication networks, etc.  
After a period of discussion  
locally, a national congress  
could be called for women to  
organize on a national level. This  
organization, which I have called  
a Covenant, could be developed  
along the lines of a political party  
or a labor union, and would be  
working toward a world-wide  
revolution led by feminists. With  
this long-term goal in mind, local  
groups could then work in coor-  
dination with other groups  
around the country, on specific  
goals and issues. Resources  
could be consolidated. Theories  
could be developed, circulated,  
criticized, reworded. Groups in  
one part of the country could  
benefit from the experiences of  
women in another part of the  
country.  

Women's groups could  
organize around issues related  
particularly to women (rape,  
abortion, child care, etc.) as well  
as around broader issues. For  
example, in the past year or so,  
there have been articles publish-  
ed about studies which have  
shown that the layer of ozone  
which surrounds the atmosphere  
of earth is slowly being worn  
away by various sources, mainly  
by jet engines, as well as by  
aerosol sprays. The result of the  
wearing away of this atmospheric  
protection will be that the sun’s  
rays will not be filtered, and that  
within the next 30-40 years,  
many diseases, particularly skin  
cancer will plague the earth.  

Ozone — a Women’s Issue?  

One could say that this is not a  
women’s issue. It is an en-  
vironmental issue. I believe that  
this is a women’s issue. It is a  
clear example of one of the  
effects of the male value system  
and capitalism — uncontrolled,  
profit-oriented technology.  
Women have an interest in the  
quality of life for their children  
and for themselves. In a  
woman's state such abuses of  
the environment would not be  
permitted simply for the present  
convenience of jet travel and  
commerce. This issue would lay  
bare the values of the patriarchy,  
which hold human life to be an  
expendable commodity.  

A women's congress, speak-  
ing clearly, and with vocal  
leadership, could organize
