Crummy Decision

Girl Scout officials in  
Detroit have revised a pro-  
posed program for teenagers  
on sexuality so that it no  
longer mentions birth con-  
trol or abortion because they  
were threatened with a boy-  
cott of the annual cookie sale  
by the anti-abortion group,  
Right to Life-Lifespan, Inc.  
The program will make no  
mention of pregnancy preven-  
tion or abortion, "except to  
show girls they can say no."

Good Example

Bighearted Ronnie Reagan  
recently said he would don-  
ate all the residual income  
from his old films to chari-  
ty. This, says he, would be  
an example of what private  
citizens and companies can  
do to help the poor and make  
up for his brutal cuts in  
social services that are  
“saving America from big  
government." The total resi-  
duals for 1982 from gener-  
ous Ronnie came to $30. What  
a help!!!

INS Motel

Barbed wire and hurricane  
fencing is "tastefully" hid-  
den behind a bamboo curtain  
outside the Olympic Motel in  
Houston, TX. A sign visible  
from a nearby freeway indi-  
cates that the motel is open  
for business and at night  
the lighted sign boasts co-  
lor TV, radio and a phone.  
Despite the advertising, the  
motel is in reality a deten-  
tion center, jointly operated  
by the Immigration and Nat-  
uralization Service (INS)  
and the private Corrections  
Corporation of America.

INS has a similar motel  
turned prison here in Denver.

“Deformed” Women

In a statement to the Food  
and Drug Administration (FDA)  
concerning silicone implants,  
the American Society of Plas-  
tic Surgeons asserted that  
women who have small breasts  
are afflicted with “deform-  
ities...really a disease",  
and that treatment of the  
condition is "often very  
necessary to ensure an  
improved quality of life."  
These doctors perform over  
70,000 operations per year  
to enlarge women's breasts,  
mostly for cosmetic reasons.  
The complication rate from  
this procedure is 25-33%.

Not surprisingly, an FDA  
advisory panel has recommend-  
ed an investigation into the  
safety of silicone-filled  
devices to be done by the  
manufacturers.

The Bible Saves

A Milwaukee man who admit-  
ted he sexually assaulted  
his two stepdaughters, fath-  
ering two children by one of  
them, received probation af-  
ter correctly answering a  
question on the Bible. The  
judge asked the man a ques-  
tion on the Book of Revela-  
tions and the correct answer  
saved the man, who had prior  
convictions for manslaughter  
and grand larceny, from a  
10-year prison sentence.

Fashionable Abuse

Japanese designer clothes  
currently in vogue promote  
abuse as "high fashion." The  
clothes, deliberately design-  
ed to look torn and ripped,  
are accessorized with band-  
aged feet and painted-on  
bruises. Models are shown  
with swollen lips, bruised  
cheeks and gashed foreheads  
painted on.

All The Time

A Department of Energy  
spokesperson at Hanford,  
Washington, explaining why  
no announcement was made af-  
ter the smokestack at a plu-  
tonium plant was found to be  
leaking radioactive material  
into the air: “The thing is  
this--we have incidents hap-  
pening over here all the  
time."

Fight On!

In Auckland, New Zealand,  
a group of angry women left  
a rapist chained to a tree  
after seizing him outside his  
home. Six women waited until  
the 40-year old professional  
man drove up in his car. They  
leapt inside the car, over-  
powered and gagged the man  
and drove off. He was chained  
to a tree outside Auckland  
Zoo. The women say that they  
know definitely of three or  
four rapes he has committed.  
The group wants to encourage  
women throughout New Zealand  
to take action themselves.  
"We want other women to know  
they do have the strength--  
and we want to encourage wo-  
men to use it." The man in-  
tends to press charges of  
assault. Women are planning  
to either turn up ‘en masse'  
(in hundreds) and "confess"  
and/or continue to harass him  
with phone calls, letters  
and graffiti every day.

U.S. At War

The dispatch of the 78,000  
ton aircraft carrier America,  
accompanied by other warships  
including two guided missile  
destroyers, to the east coast  
of Central America should put  
the whole anti-imperialist  
movement in this country on  
alert. Less than a month ago,  
speed boats, operated either  
by the CIA or directed by the  
US Navy, heavily mined the  
Nicaraguan port of El Bluff.  
Even as the naval forces a-  
mass, with eight ships now on  
Nicaragua's Atlantic Coast,  
the Senate Intelligence Comm.  
approved without dissent Rea-  
gan's proposal that the Nic-  
araguan "contras" be funded  
with another $21 million for  
their battle against the rev-  
olution.

No More Cutoffs

Militant action by over  
300 members of the Community  
Coalition to Stop Utility  
Rate Hikes in Chicago  
have forced People's Gas  
Co. to make some changes  
in their "policies". There  
will be no more gas shut-  
offs this winter in Chicago!  
Everyone shut off since Dec.  
1 will be reconnected  
free of charge! Rewards of  
organizing.

Artificial Fathers

A California judge has  
ruled that, although a state  
law provides that sperm do-  
nors are not to be considered  
natural fathers if the sperm  
is used by a licensed phy-  
sician in “artificial insem-  
ination", that law does not  
extend to procedures done  
without a doctor. Therefore,  
a Sonoma County lesbian who  
had a baby after inseminating  
herself, using sperm donated  
by a gay male acquaintance,  
must now grant visitation  
rights to the man and inform  
him of all major medical and  
educational decisions affect-  
ing her son.

POWs Tortured

A group of relatives of  
women political prisoners in  
Montevideo, Uruguay, have de-  
nounced the brutal treatment  
of the women prisoners in  
Punta de Rieles, a military  
prison. One hundred-forty  
women are being held. Accord-  
ing to the relatives, the  
soldiers "make a double line  
through which the women are  
forced to march while the  
soldiers beat them up with  
sticks."

Rip Off Loss

The latest "slimming tech-  
nique" developed in the U.S.  
is called suction lipectomy.  
A tube attached to a pump is  
inserted into an area and the  
fat is literally sucked out.  
Another violent method of  
weight loss involves the  
implantation of tape worms  
which live in the intestines.

Fixed Trial

During the trial of Brink's  
defendants Kuwasi Balagoon,  
Judith Clark and David Gil-  
bert in Orange County, N.Y.,  
sharpshooters were on the  
roof 24 hours a day. The jury  
was anonymous, identified  
only by numbers, and moved  
to and from the courthouse in  
a bus with covered windows.  
Such actions create the im-  
pression that the jurors’  
lives are in danger.

Westchester, N.Y. officials  
are creating the same impres-  
sion in the Kathy Boudin/  
Samuel Brown trial. First  
they announced plans to con-  
vert a post office into a  
maximum security court. Hav-  
ing abandoned that idea, they  
have now barricaded the coun-  
ty courthouse in White Plains  
in preparation for the trial.  
The security measures are so  
extreme that county officials  
have placed a $6.6 million  
price tag on the operation.  
The actions the state is tak-  
ing to ensure conviction and  
heavy sentences (like 75 years  
for the other defendants)  
must be exposed.
