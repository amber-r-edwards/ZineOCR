Boycott Coors

Coors does it again! Wil-
liam Coors in a speech to
a group of minority business
owners said that "blacks
lack intellectual capacity"
and that "one of the best
things they (slave traders)
did for you is to drag your
ancestors over here in
chains." Coors also attri-
buted the economic prob-
lems in Africa to a lack of
intellectual capacity. "In
Rhodesia the economy was
booming under white manage-
ment...Now in Zimbabwe...it
is a disaster."

The day after, Coors tried
to say that it was only a
poor choice of words, not
racism that prompted his
comments. In response to
Coors' white supremacist
views, Bishop Brookins of
the 5th Episcopal District
of the African Methodist
Episcopal Church has called
for a national boycott of
all Coors' products. For
many of us this boycott is
ongoing as Coors has a
long history of union bust-
ing, racism and homophobia.

Part Of The Job

The U.S. Army is refusing
to pay damages to a woman
who was raped by two fellow
soldiers on an Army base 14
months ago, on the grounds
that the assault was just one
of the risks of serving in
the military. Betty Ann Buck-
miller says, however, that she
will sue if necessary to win
the damages. Adds Buckmiller:
"There's no job I've heard
of where rape is incidental to
any type of working condition?”

Damn Silence

Sexual relationships be-
tween students and staff at
the Nebraska School for the
Deaf went on for at least
2 years with the other staff
members' knowledge. As many
as 15 of 110 staff members
are being investigated for
sexual abuse, sexual miscon-
duct, child abuse, misappro-
priation of funds and drug
violations.

Shock ‘em Up

The use of electroshock on
involuntary patients is leg-
al, an Ontario judge ruled
in December. But despite the
judge's ruling that electro-
shock is not a form of psycho-
surgery and doesn't require
the consent of the patient
or relatives, the woman has
been moved to another hospi-
tal where she won't receive
shock. Carla McKague who re-
presented the woman believes
her client was transferred
to prevent an appeal of the
decision--and that other
cases will be tried now that
the issue has broken.

Black Workers Win

In Illinois, hundreds of
current or former black wel-
fare workers have been award-
ed more than $15 million in
what their union said may be
the largest racial discrimin-
ation suit in U.S. history.
The suit charged that black
public aid workers performed
the same tasks as whites but
earned from $150 to $300 a
month less. At least 1,000
people will share the money.

No Ripple This Hole

The Reagan Administration
has been concealing under-
ground nuclear explosions in
Nevada for over a year. One
of the blasts caused the
earth more than 1/5th of a
mile above to collapse, in-
juring 12. An area 60 feet
wide and 150 feet long drop-
ped between 10 and 30 feet.
Energy officials stated that
the decision not to announce
all the tests was made for
the sake of convenience--
"the size of some of the
tests was such that they
didn't even create a ripple!"

No Fault

A Federal jury in Denver
Friday rejected the claims
of a woman who said she suf-
fered a miscarriage because
of police brutality. The cop
knocked her to the floor and
another struck her in the
back with his knee before
tossing her in the patrol-
car, the suit alleged. Attor-
neys for the officers say
that only necessary force
was used and that their ac-
tions didn't cause the mis-
carriage.

- Armed Action

Tonight (Jan. 29, '84) ar-
med units of the United Free-
dom Front bombed the offices
and facilities of the Moto-
rola Corporation in Queens,
NYC. Public awareness of Mo-
torola as a death merchant
is not as widespread as it
is for other corporations like
Honeywell. In '76 the Pentagon
listed Motorola as the 66th
largest war contractor in
the US. In just the last half
of 1983 Motorola was already
guaranteed 125 million in
war contracts. Motorola sup-
plies parts for cluster
bombs, missile guidance sys-
tems for the navy, etc.
Motorola not only contrib-
utes to imperialism's inter-
national exploitation but
also takes advantage of the
cheap labor and reactionary
governments as well by loca-
ting its foreign holdings
in countries like Puerto Ri-
co, South Korea, Malaysia,
Philippines, Costa Rica, Is-
rael and South Africa. We
dedicate this action as a
part of the international
day of solidarity with the
people of El Salvador.

Haitians Attacked

In recent months Haitian
cab drivers in Montreal have
been fighting attempts to
push them out of their jobs
by racist white workers. One
Haitian driver, Willy Cicer-
on, has registered a com-
plaint with the Quebec Human
Rights Commission over at-
tempts by white drivers to
prevent Haitians from pick-
ing up fares. The racist pro-
paganda over Haitians as
supposed carriers of AIDS
has sparked the attacks,
which range from "warning"
passengers not to get into
Haitians' cabs, to actual
beatings of Black drivers.

Hungry Too Long

Hundreds of peasants in
drought-stricken northeast
Brazil smashed into a govern-
ment food warehouse with
picks and shovels to steal
beans and flour, then looted
a butcher shop and a street
fair. About 1,200 rural work-
ers, destitute after five
years of a drought that has
parched the northeast, gath-
ered just after dawn. Many
wielded picks and shovels
and carried empty sacks over
their shoulders. The angry
workers smashed into a state-
owned warehouse and hauled
off hundreds of 11-pound
bags of beans and flour.

Medical Assault

Student doctors practicing
vaginal examinations on un-
conscious women is a common
and accepted practice in the
teaching hospitals in England.
The women--who have gone to
hospital as patients, expect-
ing health care--are not
told, nor are they asked for
their permission for these
examinations. This is a
clear case of the medical
profession's contempt for
women, and their abuse of
our bodies. It could legally
be seen as assault.

Why Not Assault?

A Waukesha County circuit
judge in Wisconsin dismissed
a sexual assault charge a-
gainst a man accused of fond-
ling a 10-year-old's breast.
Judge Roger Munphy ruled that
sexual assault was not in-
volved because the victim's
breasts had not yet developed.
