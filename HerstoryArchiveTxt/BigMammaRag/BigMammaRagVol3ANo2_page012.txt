What I do

I work in an office.
I am motivated by daily memoranda
announcing layoffs.
They come from silver-tongued computers.
Their cards tell me where to eat lunch,
how much to spend.
They caution me to smile (honesty is
unfriendly).

I am assured of being on the same
conveyor belt twenty years from now.
My only hope is to grow a penis.

But what good would it do?

I
never I didn't go to Harvard or Yale.

You listen; 
They tell me I'm smarter than their machines
look out and pay me in quarters and dimes.

I watch for revolutions to germinate.
Each night I go home at the end of the day
he waits for you to my trailer-sized room.
My hot plate makes instant coffee.

I am 42 years old.

I write this poem on the wall
in the hall bathroom.
No one else will listen.

The judge sat fat and crinkled and bald:
He is known to be a liberal,

The patriarchs gathered in chambers deciding my fate;

I sat on a bench and heard their male sounds rise and fall.
David was there with a handstitched suit:

They tell me it was obscene.

They tore my children away that day, mother right was doomed;

A cesarean section was made in my heart and tenderness removed.
I wanted to scream and kick and kill:

My father said I was calm.

The crime was loving women, and I stand guilty as charged;

I steal daydreams

I like to watch them glow
in the darkness of my cell.
When it rains I move them
closer to the window sill,
We almost join hands.

By Christmas they will know I'm not real

I take all women to my breasts, we hide our tears in our flowing hair.

We love each other inside of ourselves:

Our lips are forever sealed,

Talkin’ to My Mama

Then they'll pack up their stars and move on

to better neighborhoods.

I will mourn their loss for a few weekends, play Beethoven

and get drunk,

Before I have time to throw away their pictures

I will find a new group of daydreams,

standing on the corner in the snow,

waiting for someone to lead them across the street
and up the crooked stairs

to a warm fireplace, hot cider,

the velvet streamers hiding

my other face.

Mama, I've got a springy body

Can't you see what you've wrought?
My eyes that look so much like yours
The mind that is unlike yours

For years you didn’t know

the difference in me from the rest —
Guess you didn't have time...

And I think that you still don’t know
Mama, Look what you helped make
We could be friends if you hadn't
brought me into the world,

and so very conscious of the fact.

September Love Poems

You tell me why you were lonely

in Nashville, riding the tour bus
around Opry Land like a frightened
child on a carnival pony.

I am driving and so cannot stop

to hold you, to lift you from your
memory where sadness drifts now,
the ghostly rocking horse of long ago.

It had started then. You were left

in the green field holding to the back
of the great mare, and your father died
of a terrible disease, and your mother
grew you up so carefully.

Now, you cling to my hand, and I want
to give you all the love those strangers
with you in tourist land could not.

women of the mirror

you've been dead 3 mos.
2 days ago he told me

again I wake in cold sweat
in the kitchen a glass breaks in my hand

I stare through myself into the wail
outside my window

this is where we stood
women of the mirror

he locked you
& placed me beside

you pulled me against you
your hand slid down to reveal your breasts

& hit hard
you wanted to see if I'd want you

your hand slid down
you knew he’d fuck me

his hand slid down against your breasts
he wanted to know if I'd want you

your hands slid down

lips

opening to kiss his darvon
hands cool as

glass

they hold our breasts
tight

to the dark
