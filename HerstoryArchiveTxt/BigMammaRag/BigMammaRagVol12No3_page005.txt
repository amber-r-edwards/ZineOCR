Marilyn Lowery: Serving 2

Gentlepeople:

I am writing this letter  
in the hope that somewhere  
there is someone who is  
willing and able to help me  

locked up  

in my current plight. At  

the present time, I am in-  
carcerated at the Ohio Re-  
formatory for Women (ORW),  
Marysville, Ohio, where I am  
serving a 22 year to life  
sentence for Aggravated Rob-  
bery and Murder. I am a 28  
year old, Black woman, and  
have been incarcerated since  
April, 1982.  

It is my sincere hope that  
you and your readers will  
see the injustice in my  
story and be willing to as-  
sist me in my struggle to  
secure a reduction in my  
sentence and regain my free-  
dom. The following is the  
story of the events which  
led to this situation and  
what has transpired during  
my incarceration.  

In 1976, my husband and  
father of two of my daugh-  
ters was murdered on the 4th  
of July, as the result of a  
gunshot wound to the head,  
inflicted by a white man who  
had been drinking at a bar  
in Cleveland, Ohio. The man  
had allegedly made a state-  
ment in the bar, previous  
to the murder, to the effect  
of, "I'm going to kill my-  
self a Nigger!" My husband,  
myself, and my sister were  
in an automobile going past  
the bar, when the cold-  
blooded murder occurred. In  
including the story of my  
husband's tragic death, it  
is my hope that you will  
understand the mental and  
emotional instability I have  
suffered and continue to  
suffer.  

Being a young widow attem-  
pting to be both father and  
mother to my children and  
having aspirations of be-  
coming a model, I attended  
modeling school and invested  
money in a portfolio. After  
a series of rejections and  
no big breaks, I became  
disillusioned. I have the  
stature and looks to be a  
successful model, but I was  
a poor, minority woman and  
lacked the education and  
backing to be successful.  

Eventually, I became in-  
volved with a man of my own  
age who had the appearance  
of being a success in life.  
At the time, I was lonely  
and he provided the compan-  

ionship I had virtually lack-  

ed since the time of my hus-  
band's senseless murder.  
This man had a charisma  

about him which led me to do  
whatever he asked of me and  
I became a prostitute for  
him. Ultimately, I began to  
fear him, but I was unsure  
of how to remove myself and  
my children from the sit-  
uation.  

On the evening of April 3,  
1982, this man and I went to  
an after hour joint in  
Cleveland, that we fre-  
quented from time to time.  
We had a few drinks and  
with no prior warning, he  
pulled a gun and began rob-  
bing the patrons. Being  

told him how I felt and  
that I was going to turn  
myself over to the authori-  
ties. I encouraged him to  
do the same. After inform-  
ing my family of my involve-  
ment in the robbery, I did  
not turn myself into the  
police, because my family  
was afraid for me, but I  
was arrested approximately  
a week later. My man did  
not turn himself in, and  
was later arrested.  

Having no prior felony  
record and being totally  
ignorant of my rights and  

terrified of this man and  
the situation, I did what  

I was told and assisted in  
taking the property of in-  
dividuals at the scene. I  
then went to the car as  
another patron was entering  
the bar. While in the car, I  
heard a gunshot and when  

my man came out, he explain-  
ed that there had been a  
struggle and the gun had  
gone off. At that time, I  
had no knowledge of anyone  
being harmed.  

Upon reading the newspap-  
er two days after the crime,  
I discovered that one of  
the victims had been cold-  
bloodedly shot in the head  
while laying face down on  
the floor. All I could  
think of was that this man  
had died in the same manner  
as my husband. I called my  
man on the telephone and  

the way in which the crimi-  
nal justice system operates,  
I made a statement to the  
police. Subsequently, I  

was charged with Aggravated  
Murder, Aggravated Robbery  
(multiple counts), and Ag-  
gravated Burglary. (The bur-  
glary charge resulted from  
a purjured statement by the  
after-hour joint owner's  
girlfriend, who maintained  
that she was there and that  
we broke in. This was said  
because the owner was a  
parolee who did not want to  
be implicated in the opera-  
tion of an after-hour joint).  
Throughout the entire time  
period from the robbery and  
murder on, all I could en-  
vision was that an innocent  
man had been shot in the  
head, the same as my hus-  
band. I was not competent  
and was given medication at  

2 To Life  

the Cuyahoga County Justice  
Center where I was being  
held.  

My family hired a private  
attorney to represent me at  
a cost of $4,000. In ex-  
change for their fee, the  
attorney encouraged me to  
plead guilty to the lesser  
charge of Murder and two of  
the Aggravated Robberies.  
The one person I was told to  
plead guilty to robbing was  
not ever at the scene. With  
the thought in mind that a  
man had been shot in the  
head and the threat that I  
would receive the death  
penalty, should I be convic-  
ted by a jury, I pled guil-  
ty to the lesser charge and  
received a 15 year to life,  
and two 7 to 25 year sen-  
tences, one to be served  
consecutively and one to be  
served concurrently. I did  
not want to enter a guilty  
plea, but the attorney in-  
sisted. I will not meet a  
parole board until 1996.  

My co-defendant had a jury  
trial and received a life  
sentence with no parole el-  
igibility until after 30  
years. Throughout the trial  
process, I was constantly  
told that I should testify  
against him, but then the  
prosecutor felt like I was  
lying because I couldn't  
honestly say that I saw him  
commit the murder. In addi-  
tion, I was carrying his  
child at the time.  

Shortly after my arrival  
at ORW, I gave birth to a  
baby girl and while we were  
both in the prison hospital,  
the baby was burned by some-  
one. I noticed the marks on  
her legs and reported it to  
the Correctional Officer on  
duty. The officials here  
accused me of injuring my  
child. My parents came and  
picked up my daughter. When  
I was placed in the popula-  
tion, I was constantly har-  
rassed by the other inmates  
and eventually suffered a  
complete breakdown. I was  
then taken to the Forensic  
Psychiatric Hospital, Col-  
umbus, Ohio, where I re-  
mained until this past fall.  

During my stay at the For-  
ensic Center and since I  
have been back at the prison,  
I have written letters to a  
variety of public defenders,  
the Cleveland ACLU, and  
Congressman Louis Stokes. In  
all instances, the replies  
have all been to the effect  
that my case has merits,  
but they do not have the  
funds or staff to handle  
it. Each reply has contained  
another individual's address.  
I just feel as though I am  
being put off.
