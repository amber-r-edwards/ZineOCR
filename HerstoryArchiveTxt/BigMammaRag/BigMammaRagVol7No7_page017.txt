Women’s Rights In Employment

Through laws, executive orders
and regulations, both state and federal
governments provide services to
assure access to jobs by prohibiting
discrimination based on sex, age,
religion, race, national origin or
handicap. Further, after you have
become an employee you are entitled
to additional rights and protection
in regard to wages, safety and health,
labor practices, occupational injury,
etc.

DOCUMENTATION

It is important to document any
discrimination. One of the best
ways to do this is to keep a file
of affidavits. There are two reasons
for keeping affidavits; they will
provide a detailed written account
of what happened in case you forget
and they can be used in a hearing.
Sometimes a complaint can take many
months or years to reach the final
hearing and details might be forgotten.
Try and get any other worker who
experienced the discriminatory act
or who witnessed it to also write
an affidavit. Keep a copy and send
one to your lawyer.

An affidavit should include the
date and time of what happened, what
exactly did happen, who was involved
(names and titles), who witnessed it,
and where it happened. Then sign it
and date it with the date you wrote
it. Have somebody witness it by
signing and dating it. The witness
to the affidavit is someone who saw
you sign and date the affidavit, not
who saw the discriminatory act.
Write the affidavit as soon after
the act as possible.

APPLYING FOR A JOB

When a company is investigated for
unfair hiring practices, the investi-
gation is generally based on the appli-
cations it has received. If no appli-
cations from women have been received,
a company can hire only men.

Women have been discouraged from
applying for jobs in a variety of ways.
Some ways have been direct, such as
by saying that no applications are
being taken. Some indirect. One woman,
applying for a brakeman/switchman job,
was shown a stack of applications
several inches high and told she would

Go For Help

have to wait years before her applica-
tion was processed.

You are legally entitled to apply
for any job for which you believe you
are qualified.

When you apply for a job, the appli-
cation may ask you whether you are
male or female, whether you are married,
and your height and weight. These
questions are lawful, as long as they
are asked for all job applicants, and
the information is used for legitimate
job screening purposes. It is unlaw-
ful if the information is used to
discriminate against women. An employ-
er may impose restrictions as to mini-
mum height and weight, and responsibi-
lity for children only where these
restrictions are clearly necessary for
job performance, for safety and
efficiency on the job, and where
these restrictions are applied equally
to men and women. Some employers give
tests to applicants such as tests of
skill, fitness, knowledge, and person-
ality traits. These tests should
relate to the duties of the job.

PREGNANCY

According to current Civil Rights
Commission regulation, an employer
must allow a “reasonable” amount of
time of leave for childbirth. A woman
may return to her job then, if the
job has been held open. Whether the
job has been held open depends on a
number of factors, including what
the employer interprets as a “reason-
able" amount of time.

If a company has a temporary disa-
bility program, pregnancy and compli-
cations of pregnancy and childbirth
must be included as a temporary
disability.

If a company has a disability pro-
gram or a health program that covers
childbirth, it must be provided for
a woman regardless of when she became
pregnant. If employees are eligible
for a health insurance plan 39 days
after beginning work, a woman cannot
be denied the plan because she was
pregnant before starting that job.

An employer cannot require a preg-
nant employee to take leave, unless
the pregnancy interferes with job
performance or the woman's doctor
has recommended that the employee
take leave.

SEXUAL PREFERENCE

The law provides little protection
for workers who are discriminated
against on the basis of sexual pre-
ference.

Public employees, however, do have
some protection since they usually
may not be fired except for cause,
which must be related to job perfor-
mance. Some union contracts have similar
protections.

The U.S. Civil Service Commission
has ruled that homosexuality is not
just cause for firing a federal employ-
ee. The government also may not fire
an employee for exercising her rights
to free speech. Therefore, a woman
who has publicly advocated lesbian
rights may not be fired if employed
by a government agency.

When you have been discriminated
against, take action immediately.
First, go through internal employer
grievance procedures. If results
are not satisfactory, file a complaint

Against Discrimination

COLORADO CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION

1525 Sherman Street

Denver, CO 80203

Phone: 839-3554

Administers Colorado equal opportunity
legislation. Hears complaints,
investigates, and files suits in
employment discrimination cases.

A charge of employment discrimina-
tion may be filed with EEOC by an
individual or organization, and must
be filed within 180 days after the
offense. EEOC must send (defer) the
charge to the Colorado Civil Rights
Commission for further action, or else
keep the charge and: 1) investigate
the charge; 2) if the charge is valid,
resolve the complaint by conciliation
or file suit; or 3) issue to the per-
son complaining a right-to-sue
letter. You have only 90 days after
receiving the right-to-sue letter
from EEOC to file a lawsuit on your
own behalf.

To avoid delay and for your own pro-
tection, file a complaint with both
state (CO Civil Rights Commission)
and the federal (EEOC) agencies.

EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
COMMISSION (EEOC)

Denver, CO 80203

Phone: 837-3668

Administers Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act, as amended. Hears com-
plaints, investigates, and files
suits in employment discrimination
cases.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 makes it illegal for most employ-
ers to discriminate against any
employee or applicant with respect to
any condition of employment, or against
any applicant for employment, because
of race, color, sex, religion, or
national origin. In extremely rare
cases where employers can show that
religion, sex, or national origin are
"bona fide occupational qualifications"
which are reasonably necessary for the
job, then it is not illegal for them
to select employees on this basis. For
example, an actor may be selected to
play the role of a male character in
theater productions.

Most employment discrimination
claims are brought under this law.

of the employee. This Act applies

EXECUTIVE ORDER 11246

Regulations issued by the U.S.
Department of Labor outline specific
affirmative steps that certain
employers must take. These steps
must show a good faith effort to
achieve goals set for women’s parti-
cipation in construction trades. All
contractors and subcontractors that
hold a Federal or federally assisted
construction contract in excess of
$10,000 must:

- increase applicant flow of women
for consideration for employment.

- maintain a working environment
free of harassment, intimidation,
and coercion at all sites and in all
facilities where employees work.

- where possible, assign two or more
women to each construction project.

- ensure that all supervisory per-
sonnel are aware of and carry out
the obligation to maintain such a
working environment.

- seek referrals from female recruit-
ment sources.

- maintain records on female refer-
rals from unions and off-the-street
applicants and the reasons why any
of these women are not employed.

- develop on-the-job programs for
the area which expressly include
women.

In order to encourage women's
participation in apprenticeship
programs, contractors must:

- give advance notice of apprentice-
ship opportunities to women's centers
and publications directed toward
women.

- admit to apprenticeship women
whose age exceeds the usual maximum
where such action assists the
sponsor in achieving its affirmative
action obligations.

- initiate programs to prepare
women and encourage women to enter
traditionally male programs.
