I finally was able to leave
the house, having to give my
mother back and body massages
while she was naked. I would
be locked in her room with
her for hours. I would say,
after kneeling at the foot of
her bed, "How's that?" She
would reply "Just a little
here," showing me an
area that was still sore. It
seemed endless, yet, one of
the very few ways in which I
pleased my mother.

I had been abused--I would be
taken to a strange hospital

vaginal, urinary tract, and
kidney infections. Our regu~

child has been abused--" "But
she comes from Edina (an up-
per middle class suburb in
MN)" "How do I explain what I
have to do to her--(pelvic

about eight months,
the first four or five months,
only my father was allowed to
see me. At the beginning, he
came almost daily at lunch
time--almost "on the sly"
from my mother. Then, there
were sessions with my parents,
the doctor and myself. These
sessions were set up like a
battle:
against my mother, and my
father sort of put off in a
prison camp--he was usually
silent and usually not spok-
en to. The "good" doctor im-
plied that I had told him
terrible things about my mo-
ther--when I had told him
nothing; thus she thought I
had told the
"good" doctor also promised
me that I would be safe--that
I would be going to a foster
home--that I would not be
going back to my parents’
house. Then a "Good" priest

then I was subjected to even

and more came from the "good

or sexual abuse.

‘Thus my nightmarish career
of life in therapy and mental
health institutions began
and (ashamedly) continued for
about seventeen years. I was
taught that I could not sur-

loud or became loud with anger
(not violent), one was thought

to be regressing and usually
put on more drugs, or in a
locked or more structured unit
or possibly given shock treat-
ments, sent to a board and
care home, or even sent to a
state hospital. Shame and
punishment are quite often
the rules of treatment in the
mental health system.

One must follow the rules in
order to survive the therapy
game:

1) Do Not let anyone know that
you have fantasies of any type

women in cages

My Nightmarish Career In Therapy

or ever have private conversa-
tions with yourself about any-
thing. (Many people do this
is not craziness). 2) Do Not
fight the drugs - spit them out
if you have to, but if they
find out, you will be given
higher dosages usually in in-
jection form. Long ago, I
thought drugs "helped", but I
was taught to be dependent
upon them (psychiatrists tell
you that drugs are not addic-
tive). After struggling
through chemical dependency
treatment, my needs were nev-
er respected around this is-
sue, even though I made it
clear that I was dependent.
3) Do Not try to come out as
a lesbian within a straight
system - you will lose all sup-
port and are thought to be
even "sicker". Recently I got
the courage to go back to one
of the hospitals where I've
been "incarcerated", I managed
to read my charts (few people
are aware of their right to
do so) - I found that within
seven years my need to deal
with my identity as a lesbian
was mentioned twice. Actually
the issues I mentioned verbal-
ly and in self-charting were
seldom if ever, dealt with.
4) If you complain of depres-
sion be aware that often the
treatment of choice is elec-
tro-shock "therapy".

5) If you are totally honest,
know how to use the mental
health jargon and are effec-
tive, you are then accused of
manipulation or told you need
to learn respect or possibly
denied further treatment be-
cause you are too smart/not
because you know how to deal
with all of the situations
that cause problems in your
life.

6) If you fight the forms of
treatment imposed upon you by
your doctor (by fight I do
not mean violent acting out)
you may be subjected to a
seclusion cell, restraints,
forced drugs, shock treat-
ments, sexual abuse (it has
happened), or possibly a
court hold or commitment to

a state hospital.

7) If you are overweight or
underweight you are forced

to be on an “appropriate”
diet, and, of course thought
to be crazy because you don't
look right.

I want to share a part of me
that still evokes silent
screams, sobs, stuttering and
shivers of fear, sadness,

pain, anger and -the remem-
bered punishment etched for-
ever into my memory. I need
to say that this is very dif-
ficult...there. In 1969, I
was struggling to come out,
to own my Lesbianism, and be
a proud, strong, woman-identi-
fied-woman. I was “in-resi-
dence" at Anoka State Hospi-
tal from spring into summer
and on. An ironic thing about
most of Minnesota's state
hospitals is that the grounds
are usually on or near a
river, creek, body of water
and quite often the grounds
are beautiful. There are
trees and room to roam with-
out being watched, guarded-
especially in the summer.
That spring, I learned to
love, know, grow, share with
Eleanor. Eleanor was a strong
amazingly intelligent woman,
whose intelligence and sensi-
tivity at times caused her to
cross over a sort of break-
ing point - during which she
would flee reality into vio-
lent rages or complete silen-
ces. On good days, we would
wander off into the woods or
the tall grass down by the
river, and yes, we would make
love. Then, maybe the fear
of our loving would explode
inside Eleanor, or perhaps
just her inner worlds were
at war - she would then be
whisked (usually forced) off
into seclusion. Seclusion is
a solitary cell, sometimes a
section of six solitary cells
with mats on the floor, (at
times this is taken away -
the thought being that one
might try to suffocate one-
self) the walls are usually
padded, and a pail (to be
used as a toilet) also you
are not given toilet paper.
You are put into hospital
pajamas, given your food in
an unbreakable container and
a spoon. Your food and drugs
are given to you at mealtimes
and bedtime; you are not spo-
ken to, visited, asked if you
need anything, at any other
time with the exception of a
possible shower (never daily).
The amount of time spent in
seclusion is not a 'given',
it also does not necessarily
depend on your behavior.
Sometimes there may be a
small, barred window that you
can try to look out of. The
locks and the sounds of the
heavy doors clanging shut are
almost unbearable. Eleanor
would scream plead with me to
talk to her - give her some

semblance of sanity, read to
her, play my guitar for her,
or just stand where she could
see me in the yard below the
seclusion cells. Slowly, be~
tween rages, Eleanor would
calm, would come back to real-
ity and eventually she would
be given freedom once again,
and we would be able to share
once again. One day, shortly
after regaining her freedom
after an almost endless stay
in seclusion, we made love,
went to supper, and it was
dusk... we were down by the
river. Eleanor was peaceful,
extremely quiet, she commen-
ced speaking of her decision.
Eleanor would never be drag-
ged away, locked into a seclu-
sion cell, restrained or given
forced injections - ever again:

though I loved her,

Eleanor walked into the sea.

though I loved her, she gave herself

to the indifferent sea

and the fish nibbled those
breasts

which had filled my mouth

while the crabs ate

the dark brown eyes that
had sung me praises.

Eleanor did not

and she walked into the
ocean Eleanor walked into
the sea.

If only she had drowned my
love, too.

Yes, Eleanor committed sui-~
cide. I was in the midst of
coming out and growing strong.
I approached the one staff
person I thought I could trust
(who it turns out is a dyke)
and she went to my doctor.
The next day I was scheduled
for electro-shock treatments.
I spent the days/nights in
seclusion - the cold, hard,
ALONE place which Eleanor
hated so much... and my pun-
ishment had just begun. Mor~
ning, nothing to drink, no
breakfast, I was taken to a
ward (not even a special
room). There were a lot of
staff members around the bed,
the doctor was sitting at the
head of the bed, where there
was an awful, whirring,
buzzing machine. "Please
don't" I pleaded, "Please,
at least, you promised you
would put me to sleep - I
haven't done anything wrong -

Please don't hurt me!" Dr.
"Now - you must cooperate
with us. Sit down on this bed
now lie down. Oh, you certain-
ly ARE a fat, perverted thing,
aren't you! Well, I don't
think I want to bother search-
ing for a vein in this fat
arm - Let's get on with it.”
(The bastard was fat himself.
Also, it is against the law
to give shock treatments with-
out anesthesia) I struggled
to get free--they all grabbed
me, forced a rubber mouth-
piece into my mouth (to keep
me from biting/choking on

my tongue) me still fighting,
four holding me down, then a
rubber strap--a tight band
was placed around my head--
tight--across my forehead,
temples, back of my head,
next, underneath the band on
each temple some conductive
goop was smeared, and the el-
ectrodes were inserted. I
was fighting with all my
might now, the fierce, hating,
punishing stares--all of them,
except the doctor who with a
smile, “Maybe you will take
heed and learn from this."
The whirring buzzing machine
simultaneously,
they let me go as there was
an awesomely terrible pierc-
ing pain in my temples, my
body lost all control, every~
thing went black, I was un-
conscious, but my body was
still in extreme grand-mal
convulsions which last any-
where from ten to twenty-five
minutes. The severity of the
convulsion is much worse as I
was given no muscle relaxant,
drug to dry my saliva, or
anesthesia. Upon regaining
consciousness, my head was
splitting, my body bruised, I
didn't know where I was~

total confusion--and, I was
taken back to seclusion. I
suffered fifteen to thirty
treatments, and although--
They didn't know, They did
not erase Eleanor or my being
a dyke.

Thus, I learned through
much punishment, violation of
my rights, that I had no
rights, that I was to act “as
if": as if I was not there,
as if I was not angry, sad
hurting, lonely, confused, as
if I was not’ a strong woman
as if I was not hungry, as if
they did not continuously
shame me, as if they were not
abusing me--continuing the
cycle of abuse in which I

grew loud,
