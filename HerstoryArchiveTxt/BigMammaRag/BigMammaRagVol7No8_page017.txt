Using Eroticism as a Creative Force...

CONTINUED FROM PAGE 11

We have been raised to fear the
yes within ourselves, our deepest
cravings. For the demands of our
released expectations lead us inevi-
tably into actions which will help
bring our lives into accordance with
our needs, our knowledge, our de-
sires. And the fear of our deepest
cravings keeps them suspect, keeps
us docile and loyal and obedient, and
leads us to settle for or accept
many facets of our oppression as wo-
men.

When we live outside ourselves, and
by that I mean on external directives
only, rather than from our internal
knowledge and needs, when we live
away from those erotic guides from
within ourselves, then our lives are
limited by external and alien forms,
and we conform to the needs of a
structure that is not based on human
need, let alone an individual's.

But when we begin to live from with-
in outward, in touch with the power
of the erotic within ourselves, and
allowing that power to inform and
illuminate our actions upon the
world around us, then we begin to

be responsible to ourselves in the
deepest sense. For as we begin to
recognize our deepest feelings, we
begin to give up, of necessity,
being satisfied with suffering, and
self-negation, and with the numbness
which so often seems like their

only alternative in our society. Our
acts against oppression become inte-
gral with self, motivated and em-
powered from within.

...and Finding New Words

In touch with the erotic, I become
less willing to accept powerlessness,
or those other supplied states of be-
ing which are not native to me, such
as resignation, despair, self-efface-
ment, depression, self-denial.

And yes, there is a hierarchy.
There is a difference between paint-
ing a back fence and writing a poem,
but only one of quantity. And there
is, for me, no difference between
writing a good poem and moving into
sunlight against the body of a woman
I love.

This brings me to the last consid-
eration of the erotic. To share
the power of each other's feelings
is different from using another's
feelings as we would use a kleen-
ex. And when we look the other way
from our experience, erotic or oth-
erwise, we use rather than share
the feelings of those others who
participate in the experience with
us. And use without consent of the
used is abuse.

In order to be utilized, our erotic
feelings must be recognized. The need
for sharing deep feeling is a human
need. But within the European-Ameri-
can tradition, this need is satisfied
by certain proscribed erotic comings
together, and these occasions are
almost always characterized by a
simultaneous looking away, a pre-
tense of calling them something else,
whether a religion, a fit, mob vio-
lence, or even playing doctor. And
this misnaming of the need and the
deed gives rise to that distortion

which results in pornography and
obscenity - the abuse of feeling.

When we look away from the impor-
tance of the erotic in the develop-
ment and sustenance of our power, or
when we look away from ourselves as
we satisfy our erotic needs in con-
cert with others, we use each other
as objects of satisfaction rather
than share our joy in the satisfy-
ing, rather than make connection
with our similarities and our dif-
ferences. To refuse to be conscious
of what we are feeling at any time,
however comfortable that might seem,
is to deny a large part of the ex-
perience, and to allow ourselves to
be reduced to the pornographic, the
abused, and the absurd.

The erotic cannot be felt second-
hand. As a Black Lesbian Feminist,
I have a particular feeling, know-
ledge, and understanding for those
sisters with whom I have danced hard,
played, or even fought. This deep
participation has often been the
forerunner for joint concerted ac-
tions not possible before.

But this erotic change is not
easily shared by women who continue
to operate under an exclusively
European-American, male tradition.
I know it was not available to me
when I was trying to adapt my
consciousness to this mode of li-
ving and sensation.

Only now, I find more and more
woman-identified women brave enough
to risk sharing the erotic's elect-
rical charge without having to look

must begin over again.

In speaking of their genitals the women do not employ hyperboles or metaphors
they do not proceed sequentially on by gradation.
Litanies, whose refrain is an unending imprecation. They do not strive to

multiply the intervals so that in sum they signify a deliberate lapse. They
say that all these forms denote an outworn language.
They say that a great wind is sweeping the earth.

They do not recite long

They say everything

even the three
soft cages

away, and without distorting the
enormously powerful and creative
nature of that exchange. Recogniz-
ing the power of the erotic in

our lives can give us the energy to
pursue genuine change within our
world, rather than merely settling
for a shift of characters in the
same weary drama.

For not only do we touch our most
profoundly creative source, but we
do that which is female and self-
affirming in the face of a racist,
patriarchal, and anti-erotic society.

One would first touch the mouth

and the last song around them

a shred of light.

A crumpled apron, a handkerchief, a veil.
One would keep nothing.

ECSTASY

Internal movement of the body when reaching

an extreme harmony. Eyes have been seen falling

during ecstasies, ears becoming longer, hearts

becoming visible on the surface of the chest, bel-

lies twining around the navel at full speed, all

that without death resulting for the persons con-
cerned. It seems that this is a state not to be feared.
