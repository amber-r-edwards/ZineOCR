Lakota Nation: A History Of U. S. Abuse

Bobbe Ross

In 1868 the Ft. Laramie  
Treaty was signed by the US  
government and the sovereign  
Lakota Nation. The Treaty  
deeded 17 million odd acres  
to the Lakota Nation. This  
land has always been very ce-  
ntral to the people because  
of the sacred lands of the  
Paha Sapa (Black Hills).

The Treaty reserved the  
western half of South Dakota,  
about 1/3 of North Dakota,  
northern Nebraska, ¼ of  
Wyoming and a large corner of  
Montana. It was stated that  
no non-Lakota shall ever be  
permitted to pass over, set-  
tle upon, or reside in the  
reserved land and that no  
whites could "pass through"  
that area without getting  
Indian consent. Further, no  
agreement by the Lakota Na-  
tion to give up any of their  
reserved lands shall be of  
any validity or force unless  
it is signed by at least 3/4  
of the adult male Indians.

At the time of the Treaty  
the land was thought worthless  
by the whites. Soon af-  
terwards gold was found in  
the Paha Sapa, now we know  
that the area is rich in  
lumber, coal, iron ore and  
the amount of raw uranium  
ore is estimated in the mil-  
lions of tons.

In 1877 the US government  
tried to buy the Paha Sapa  
back but the Lakota people  
wouldn't approve the sale.  
Since they couldn't buy the  
land, the government stole  
the sacred Paha Sapa by an  
act of Congress.

In 1897 federal statutes  
authorized the Forest Service  
to give up small amounts of  
land for the setting up of  
schools and churches to  
people living in the vicinity  
of national forest land.

The 1978 Indian Freedom of  
Religion Act guaranteed Indian  
peoples the access to  
sites, use and possession of  
sacred objects and the free-  
dom to worship through cere-  
monies and traditional rites.

In 1967 South Dakota Dept.  
of Environmental Protection  
called the Paha Sapa the most  
valuable 100 square miles on  
earth. There are at least 27  
multinational corporations  
holding over 1 million acres  
of claims to uranium and  
other minerals. The Paha Sapa  
has been designated as a Nat-  
ional Sacrifice Area.

In June, 1980 the US Supr-  
eme Court ruled that the  
Paha Sapa region was illeg-  
ally taken from the Lakota  
Nation through the 1877 Act  
of Congress. The government  
wants to award the Lakota  
peoples $122.5 million and  
the Indian peoples have re-  
fused. Several cases have  
been filed by Indian people  
asking for $11 billion in  
damages for the taking of  
Paha Sapa, to make up for the  
peoples suffering over the  
loss of their sacred land,  
and for the vast mineral and  
other resources taken from  
the Paha Sapa in the past 113  
years, and that the Paha Sapa  
be returned to Indian control.

On April 4, 1981 a Lakota  
community established itself  
in the Paha Sapa near Lake  
Buddy Lamont (formerly Vic-  
toria Lake) by the Dakota  
American Indian Movement. A  
Special Use Application was  
legally filed with the Forest  
Service for 88 acres for a  
permanent settlement with  
school and religious site to  
be established along with a  
development plan for alter-  
native energy which was de-  
tailed. The community named  
itself Yellow Thunder Camp.

The government sent forms  
which the Indian peoples an-  
swered and the government's  
final decision was that the  
Indians could not stay, giv-  
ing a deadline of Sept. 8,  
1981. FBI agents tried to in-  
filtrate the camp and camo-  
flaged soldiers were spotted  
along the area with a truck  
of ammunition during this  
period.

On Sept. 8 the government  
filed a civil suit seeking a  
permanent injunction to keep  
the Indian peoples from set-  
tling in the Paha Sapa and  
asking for damages done to  
the environment.

The Indian peoples went to  
court seeking a temporary  
restraining order so that no  
one could evict them from the  
land while the civil suit was  
in process.

All women and children  
welcome.
