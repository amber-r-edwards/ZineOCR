An Ad For Racism In The Capitalist Tradition

Lori Bradford

Our government these days
is again putting out the line
that we live in an integrated
society--I think they believe
that integrated toilets imply
an integrated society. After
a summer of seeing vacation-
ers coming and going through
Colorado, it's obvious that
almost all who have the class
privilege to "See America
First" are whites.

Racism and anti-Semitism
are so common, so subtle in
our society that active
white supremacist groups who
veil themselves in a blanket
of patriotism get away with
things like the full page ad
(see Rocky Mountain News,
Tuesday, Oct. 13, Denver, CO)
sponsored by the John Birch
Society--proclaiming the e-
vils of terrorism. Terror-
ist actions being defined
as threats to the security
of the U.S., never as a pro-

tection against racist imper-
ialist threats by the U.S.
(and other nations as well)
against struggling nations.

The ad promoted active sup-
port of the Reagan regime,
and his international allies
like Margaret Thatcher. Be-
moaning the takeover of Rho-
desia by Marxist terrorists
who have renamed their coun-
try "Zimbabwe". And, I quote
"This is bad news for U.S.
industry! It is expected
that terrorists will contin-
ue to try to grab other na-
tions of “Africa." At a Bir-
cher meeting which took place
Oct. 19 at the Landmark Inn
on S. Colorado Blvd.; the
guest speaker was Gordon
Lloyd who served in Rhodesia
as a professional photograph-
er for the British South Af-
rican Police.

Somehow it seems that some
kind of great outcry should
have occurred in protest to
the Rocky Mountain News giv-
ing space to white suprema-
cist groups, and yet I know
that that's only wishful
thinking on my part. In fact
Denver and Colorado have long
been a stronghold of KKK'ers
and Birchers, for instance,

As we fall back into the
women's community for secur-
ity and comfort (which is a
false security) we must know
that our Third World, Women
of Color, and Jewish sisters
have no choice for this kind
of withdrawal, neither can we
as white feminists allow our-
selves this privilege any

Sage Productions, Inc.

Singer and songwriter
Margie Adam will be perform-
ing at South High School on
November 7th. The concert was
originally slated for the
Houston Fine Arts Center at
Colorado Women's College.
Sage verbally contracted with
CWC for use of Houston Fine
Arts and waited for approxi-
mately a month and a half to
receive the written contract.
We had already begun our pub-
licity for the concert when
one of our members received

a phone call from Dick Beard,

the recently hired head of
the CWC Conference department.
He informed her that he had
called our office and heard
on our answering machine that
one of our ticket outlets was
the Gay and Lesbian Community
Center. He had conferred with
a fellow in the CWC Business
Office, and the two of them
determined that it is CWC
policy to not rent CWC facil-
ities for any events which
promote the Gay and Lesbian
movements.

Sage members immediately
requested a written copy of
the college policy. After

desert our sisters and bro-
thers at the "front lines".

discussing the matter among
ourselves, Sage members de-
cided to talk with college
president Sherry Manning in
an attempt to resolve the
issue in a principled fash-
ion. In a telephone conversa-
tion with Manning, clarifica-
tion of the College policy
and, specifically, the use

of the word "promote” was
sought.

It was explained to Manning
that a Sage concert is a
community event with commun-
ity groups running informa-
tion and literature tables in
the lobby, from the Rocky
Flats project to Men Against
Sexism to Woman to Woman
Bookstore. She was asked if
"promotion" meant telling the
record distributor not to
sell records by lesbians,
telling the Gay and Lesbian
Community Center they could
sell our tickets but not have
a table in our lobby.

Sage will not use CWC fac-
ilities for any future con-
certs, nor, in our capacity
as community consultant for
concert production, will we
recommend CWC to other groups
