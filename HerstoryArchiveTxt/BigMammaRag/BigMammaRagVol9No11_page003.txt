Zionism / Racism

Dear Big Mama Rag,

We are three Jewish women
from the San Francisco Bay
area. We're writing because
there were a number of things
which really concerned us
about the November theme is-
sue: "Racism and Anti-Semi-
tism: Two Sides of the Same
Coin Part I." Several months
ago, you had mentioned that
you were planning a theme
issue this fall on Racism.
Like many others, we were
looking forward to this is-
sue. Obviously racism is to-
tally critical for us, living
in this country, to be deal-
ing with. But we found it
shocking and thought it was
really wrong that there wasn't
a single article on rac-
ism against Black people in
the U.S.--or for a paper com-
ing out of Colorado to not
deal with the very severe
racism against Chicano Mexi-
cano people, is very racist
itself.

We disagree with the theme
issue being focused on Rac-
ism and Anti-Semitism--pre-
sented as two sides of the
same coin, giving the two
equal weight. Of course anti-
Semitism exists and in fact
is growing with the growth
of the whole right wing
movement in this country
today. But we can't compare
the conditions that Jews
face in this country with
those of Third World people
here. We don't think we can
compare being told to sing
Christmas Carols with what
it means for Black, Puerto
Rican, Chicano Mexicano, or
Native children being forced
to say the pledge of alle-
giance--talking about "one
nation under God, indivisi-
ble, with liberty and justice
for all"--or to compare it
with 25-40% sterilization
rates or statistics like one
out of every four Black men
will go to prison in his
lifetime.

A view that Jewish women
are "Third World" or at least
"non-white" has been emerging
more and more in women's
communities and women's press
in the U.S. We think this is
wrong--and we think it comes
from Jewish women wanting to
find a place on the scale of
"who is most oppressed" and
from a desire not to have to
take full responsibility for
fighting white supremacy in
this society. It's danger-
ous because the result is

that it focuses so much
energy and attention on
fighting anti-Semitism, con-
fusing it with the fight
against racism and ultimate-
ly taking our focus away from
the much more basic problem
of racism and white suprema-
cy in the United States.
--In this case resulting in
an issue on racism that
doesn't deal with Black peo-
ple in America. This view of
Jews as Third World people
leads inevitably to support
for Zionism (another form
of racism).
Specifically on the article
"A Jewish Woman Defines Her
Needs"--Linnie Jennings takes
issue with the left for being
anti-Zionist. She says, "It
is legitimate to criticize
the Israeli government for
100% inflation, constant
state of war, poverty and
class systems. However, it
is anti-Semitic to scream
Zionism and insist upon the
political and ultimate so-
cial assimilation of the
Jewish state for the sake of

a peaceful solution to the
Palestinian problem." The
reason that we are opposed
to Zionism and the continued
existence of Israel, is
not merely because Israel
is a capitalist state. It
is because Israel is a set-
tler colonial state--no dif-
ferent from South Africa
(which everyone knows is
its best friend and ally).
Israel is built on land
stolen through terror and
war from the Palestinian
people. The "constant state
of war" which Linnie Jen-
nings refers to is because
war against the Palestinians
is what is necessary for
Israel to enforce its occu-
pation of Palestine.
Throughout history, Jews
have suffered great oppres-
sion--and in this century,
the Nazis attempted to com-
mit genocide against us
while masses of German peo-
ple and others around the
world stood by watching and

refusing to stand up against

it. But this does not give
us the right, then, to turn
around and commit genocide
against the Palestinian peo-
ple, a people who are in no

way responsible for our op-
pression (talk about anti-
Semitism--what a misuse of
the word! Arabs are semitic
people just as much as
Jews!).

If our history means any-
thing, it should mean that
we are unwilling to stand
by while genocide is com-
mitted against others. To-
day while Jews represent a
group with one of the high-
est per capita incomes in
America, we can't be off be-
moaning our Jewish oppres-
sion and equating ourselves
with Third World people. We
need to challenge our rela-
tionship as Jews in white
America in 1981 to the sys-
tem of imperialism.

Although there has been a
tradition of leftism in the
Jewish community, this has
been diminishing over the
past years. Many Jews who
once considered themselves
liberals are now openly sup-
porting Reagan because of
his support for Israel--Is-
rael which defends South
Africa, Israel which drops
Napalm, Israel which can in-
vade any Arab country with
aplomb in the name of fight-
ing anti-Semitism.

The question facing Jews
is how do we best fight anti-
Semitism in this world? It
is only by recognizing that
today we must fight against
white supremacy and ally
ourselves with forces who
actively oppose racism and
fascism. ZIONISM IS RACISM.

Genocide is being commit-
ted against Black, Chicano
Mexicano, Puerto Rican and
Native American people in
this country and genocide is
being committed against the
Palestinian people in the
name of Zionism. We must op-
pose these attacks and stand
on the side of liberation
rather than trying to say
our oppressions are all the
same. They simply are not.

A View Of Jamaica

Dear Sister/s,

I read with interest your
November issue of B.M.R. This
is the first time I came a-
cross your paper. I am very
pleased to see the kind of
issues covered.

I am deeply touched by the

-Peg Averill/LNS

interview that Elizabeth Bow-
man and Judith Eisencher had
with Ingrid Kirkwood. I am a
Jamaican who has lived abroad
since 1959. I want, more than
anything else to join in the
struggle for equality in my
island. I do not wish to
start anything anew since I
believe it's much better to
unite with others who are al-
ready doing something.

I do have contacts with
people in Jamaica, but unfor-
tunately their philosophy and
mine differ greatly. They
like myself were brought up
under a system that breeds
vampires, and were even
taught to believe that that
was a great thing. Now that I
am fortunate to know the rea-
son behind the unequal econo-
mic system that existed, and
still exists in Jamaica, I
wish to cast in my "two
cents" worth to help to
change the "vulture system"
that we have. Like Franz
Fanon I believe that "Each
generation must, out of rela-
tive obscurity, discover its
mission, fulfill it, or betray
it."

I would greatly appreciate
if you could make it possible
for Ingrid and myself to be
in contact with each other,
either by sending her address
to me or mine to her.

Keep the light burning.

Yours faithfully,
Sylvine Smith
Dorchester, MA
