Postal Hazards

What's the most dangerous  
job in the federal govern-  
ment? Maybe the military?  
No, it's the Postal Service.  
The post office does not  
even meet minimum safety  
requirements, according to  
a recent federal study. The  
study concludes that the  
postal management is letting  
the plants and equipment de-  
teriorate while pressuring  
the workers to move the mail  
faster. This has left three  
dead and hundreds injured  
in the past 16 months.  
Safety will be a major issue  
in the contract negotiations  
that are opening this week  
for a contract that expires  
on July 30.

Hellfire & Hypocrisy

The Rev. W.B. Timberlake,  
a Southern Baptist preacher,  
has launched efforts to block  
repeal of a 28-year-old Cali-  
fornia statute requiring  
health professionals to re-  
port evidence of sexual acti-  
vity by women under 18. The  
law, which until recently has  

been ignored, gives California,  

in effect, the right to keep  
files on the sexual activity  
of young women. Under the  

statute,  
sex acts by women under 18 are illegal.

No Tanks

An arsonist's fire gutted  
Toronto's newest lesbian  
bar, the Sappho Restaurant  
on Church Street, March 1st.  

Entry was forced through a  
rear window and fire set to  
paint remover which had been  
poured over empty liquor  
cases in the basement.  
According to police specula-  
tions reported in the Toron-  
to Star, the fire was in-  
tended to cover up the theft  
of less than $100 from the  
restaurant's cigarette ma-  
chine.

Until February, Sappho's  
had been known as Tank's,  

a bar catering to gay men.  
But business had fallen off  
with the opening of another  
bar in the vicinity. During  
Sappho's three-week life  
span, no attempt had been  
made to redecorate the in-  
terior, which sported cam-  
ouflage nets on the ceiling  
and a large mural of a tank  
on one wall.

Clamps On Midwives

Delia Burns has been sent-  
enced to serve 30 days in  

jail and three years probation  
as the first midwife in Calif-  

ornia history to be convicted  
of practicing medicine with-  
out a license.

No Bell Babies

Four pregnant employees at  
Bell Telephone of Canada have  
won the right to refuse to  
work on CRT terminals without  
loss of pay. The women con-  
tended that the equipment  
might emit radiation which  

could result in birth defects.

Gunning For Christ

Tribulation Outfitters,  
Inc., of Lawing, Utah, adver-  
tises (in Christianity To-  
day) that its Deluxe Survi-  
val Kit includes “enough  
long-lasting freeze-dried  
food to supply a family of  
four for three months, fifty  
gallons of pasteurized water,  
a completely stocked medical  
case, and a .357 Magnum re-  
volver in case your neigh-  
bors attempt to take advan-  
tage of your Christian fore-  
sight.”

Peeping Boss

A former secretary for a  
building firm has filed a  
$750,000 lawsuit against the  
company, alleging that her  

employer made a videotape of  
her while she was using the  
office bathroom.

No More Cages

A lawsuit has been filed  
to protest a ban im-  
posed by the Ohio Reforma-  
tory for Women at Marysville  
against a newsletter titled  
No More Cages. Officials  
at the reformatory, Ohio's  
only prison for women, for-  
bade inmates to receive the  
October 1980 issue of the  
New York-based publication,  
apparently because of an ar-  
ticle critical of the Marys-  
ville prison.

The suit, filed as a class  
action by Marysville prison-  
ers Rose M. Love and Fran-  
cine Smith, claims that in-  
mates' rights of freedom of  
speech are violated by the  
ban. Their complaint, filed  
in federal district court  
April 29, states that 200  
of the 600 Marysville pri-  
soners read No More Cages,  
which is written for women  
in prison.

Learning Young

An "exhaustive" investi-  
gation of a 7-year-old girl's  
allegations of rape confirmed  

that she had indeed had a "sex-  

ual encounter" with an 8-year-  
old boy. Because of the boy's  
age, he will not be charged  
with either rape or sexual a-  
buse, but could face probation,  
placement in a foster home or  
juvenile center at the discre-  
tion of the Family Court in  
Syracuse, N.Y. The news item  
did not say what the condition  
of the 7-year-old girl was af-  
ter the rape and the "exhaus-  
tive" investigation.

Breastfed Dangers

Substances found in the  
mother's blood may show up  
in her milk. For example,  
PCBs in Michigan showed up  
in mother's milk, endanger-  
ing the infant. In a horri-  
ble situation in Halifax,  
B.C., a six-week-old baby  
was poisoned by breast milk  
containing a dry cleaning  
solvent that the mother  
breathed during regular vi-  
sits to her husband's work-  

place. The baby developed  

liver disease as a result,  
but improved after the mo-  
ther stopped breast feeding.

Fast Learner

The father of a ninth grade  
boy in Ames, Iowa, has re-  
portedly called for an end  
to high school self-defense  
classes for girls after his  
son was hospitalized as a  
result of a blow to his nose,  
a blow struck by a girl.

The boy and girl were re-  
portedly “just horsing around"  
when the girl rammed her palm  
up against the boy's nostrils.  
She said she learned the nose  
punch in a self-defense class  
the day before, and just us-  
ed it without thinking.

School officials, in the  
meantime, say they won't can-  
cel the self-defense courses,  
because they are necessary  
as a protection against crime.
