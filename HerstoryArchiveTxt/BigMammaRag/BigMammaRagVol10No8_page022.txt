Conference

collectives, rejecting power
hierarchies. We use construc-
tive criticism to learn new
ways to deal with differences,
based on the assumption that
discussion and struggle will
lead to a point of unity out
of which action for change can
come about.

As members of the BMR coll-
ective, we saw our participa-
tion in the Conference Against
Repression as an early step
in building connections be-
tween movements, mainly
through educating ourselves.
For us as white women, part
of the education gets as ba-
sic as attending a conference
where whites are not in con-
trol/leadership - where whites
participate on the terms of
people of color.

We are still very blind to
racism in ourselves and in
our work. A good example of
this is what happened in the
women's workshop. White women
dominated the discussion and
persisted in keeping abortion
the main topic despite the
very clear statements by sev-
eral Third World women that
abortion is not a priority
issue for them. It seems that
even though abortion was the
focus of discussion, the real
issue being struggled over
was white women blocking the
power and self-determination
of Black, Chicana/Mexicana
and Puerto Rican women.

If we are working towards
a revolution that includes
not just white women, but all
oppressed people, then we
have a long way to go to
learn to listen. To listen to
people whose experience is
leading them to organize in
different ways than ours.
Rather than trying to impose
our methods and goals...we
must recognize when our met-
hods and stated goals are a-
lienating us from others with
whom we should naturally be
aligned. And, then, we need to
take this new political per-
spective and apply it to our
work.

We need to have a complete
analysis when doing any or-
ganizing...To rid any of our
lives of the realities of
battering and rape and in--
cest, we also have to end
genocide in Third World comm-
unities, stop colonization
of oppressed nations world-
wide by imperialist forces,
we have to destroy jails and
psychiatric institutions, we
have to fight back against

privilege based on sexual pre-
ference, we have to destroy
class exploitation on the job,
we have to fight against white
supremacy, for self-determin-
ation of Third World peoples...
and so on and so on and so on.
Oppression in the lives of all
women is inter-connected.

Our political work has to
be rooted in our day to day
lives and then connected to
the experiences and issues of
other people. We can't look
to the state for a solution
to the problem - the state is
the problem. We have to deve-
lop an understanding that
fascism is being strengthened
in this country with the sup-
port of white people.

Fascism very basically de-
fined is a dictatorship of
the extreme right which is
based on an iron alliance of
the triangle: corporate inter-
est, government and the mili-
tary. This triangle seeks to
impose authoritarian control
on the people by 1) limiting
access to freedom of the mind
and body, 2) twisting minds
by means of propaganda and
doublespeak, 3) encouraging
and developing the innate
racist tendencies of a cul-
ture into full blown militar-
istic nationalism and neo-
colonialist imperialism, and
finally, 4) ensuring control
by preying on existential and
economic insecurity with sim-
plistic, often mythical ans-
wers to the most basic ques-
tions. (definition from "Wo-
men and Fascism", Cate Gilles,
BMR, Vol. 9, No. 8, p. 16.)

In choosing our strategies
for organizing we have to be
aware of and responsible for
our role in collaborating in
white supremacy.

The conference emphasized
for us the necessity of avoid-
ing out-of-context single is-
sue organizing. Say for exam-
ple the issue of equal pay
for equal work - could lead
to organizing for the Equal
Rights Amendment, which as-
sumes that the passage of
"government" legislation will
solve the problem. However,
the focus on women earning
59¢ for every dollar a man
earns does not begin to make
necessary connections. To
connect with the issues of
classism - an assumed higher
pay for "professional careers"
as opposed to "blue collar
jobs." To connect with the
issues of racism and employ-
ment/unemployment (who gets

hired to begin with, and un-
equal pay between white work-
ers and people of color). To
connect with issues of access
to "education" in the first
place (how the "educational"
systems function to channel
people of privileged classes
or skin color into different
jobs). In other words, "to get
that foot off our own necks,
we have to be careful where
we're putting our own damn
feet!"

So, where does this leave
us? What are some ways that
we can work politically that
don't collaborate with the
system that oppresses women,
poor people, people of color
- that don't step on the
necks of people with whom we
should be aligned - that do
take a large political con-
text into account, and pushes
us toward large scale change?
First of all, we (white women)
need to listen to Third World
women, working in the women's
movement and in national lib-
eration movements, hear their
criticisms of racism in past
and present work in the wo-
men's movement. This goes not
only for how we organize, but
what we choose as priority
issues.

For example, in the past
and all too present, organi-
zing around the issue of abor-
tion has been singular and
out of context, which sets
up that organizing to be rac-
ist and in collaboration with
the state. Thinking back to
the early '70s when abortion
was not legal and underground
networks were formed such as
the Jane Collective to pro-
vide access to abortion and
also the skills to actually
do them - ended up keeping
all the skill and knowledge
in the hands of white women.

For the feminist movement
to organize around abortion
requires a real change in our
strategy and tactics, for it
means in fact not organizing
around abortion as a singular
issue - and it also means a
greater change than just mak-
ing it a dual issue - i.e.
pro-abortion/anti-steriliza-
tion. The change we see need-
ed for the feminist movement
is to actively engage in or-
ganizing a broad health care
movement of which abortion is
only a part. A health care
movement that deals with the
fact that the infant/early
childhood mortality rate of
children of color is higher
than that for whites. A health
care movement that attacks a
medical system where race and

class determine the quality
of and access to health care.
And not just the "care" end
of health but also addresses
health issues on the job - how
Blacks, Chicano/Mexicanos,
Puerto Ricans, Native Ameri-
cans and poor women are often
forced into more hazardous
jobs - as when, after one
"accident" at a nuclear plant,
women and Third World people
were hired to "clean up the
mess." And furthermore we
don't organize around health
care separate from the under-
standing that there will be
no adequate and equal health
care under a system of Patri-
archy/White Supremacy/Imper-
ialism. Other long-standing
issues of the feminist move-
ment like rape, battering,
child care will continue to
be important within the move-
ment and yet must be re-exam-
ined from a new perspective
that works toward long range
broad based change.

Our work on individual is-
sues can only be effective/
useful in a broader analysis -
if it occurs in a way which
sees revolution as necessary
for real change.
