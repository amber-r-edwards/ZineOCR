Women In Italy Protest Missiles Genocide

(This article was written by
the eleven women who were de-
ported from Italy for block-
ading a road leading to a
cruise missile site.)

Women began arriving in
Comiso (Italy) from all over
Europe, on the weekend lead-

resistance

ing up to the 8th of March
(International Women's Day)
to meet, discuss and grow
with each other, and primar-
ily to show our solidarity
with Italian women in the
struggle against cruise mis-
siles being sited in Comiso.

The first action took place
on Sunday the 6th with a
march by women against sexual
violence, through the streets
of the town. Women reclaimed
a space traditionally occu-
pied by men (“Fonte di Diana")
by holding hands and forming
an expanding circle. Rounded
stones, with women's names
written on their sides, were
placed in the shape of a
mountain in the plaza.

Two days later, in the morn-
ing of the 8th of March, a
hundred or so more women
staged a “sit-in" in front
of the main gates at "Mag-
licco" airport (the site
being prepared for 112 Ameri-
can cruise missiles) by sit-
ting in a large circle and
linking arms. A web of col-
oured wool was woven as women
threw to each other balls of
wool across the circle. We
sat in the road for several
hours and then stood up lift-
ing the web whilst singing,
covering the police presence
with the web and our vibrance.
That afternoon we gathered in
the town square, where we
joined 600 women and more
from all corners of Sicily,
to march through the narrow
alleys and main streets of
Comiso, for peace.

At about 6:30 am, on the 9th
of March, women blockaded the
main roads leading to the
missile base before the work
traffic had arrived. We
stayed there for three hours
before the police, along with
military from inside the
base, began dragging us away
from the main gate. As we re-
peatedly went back to block-
ade, the police violence es-
calated - a woman offering
no resistance except the dead
weight of her body had her
arm broken. During the action
the police ripped films out
of women's cameras, frenzied
at the evidence showing their
brutality. We stopped block-
ading because of the harm and
injury being inflicted in
such a vicious and calculated
manner. Another woman had her
arm broken and several women suffered handfuls of hair torn from
their scalps. One woman was
slapped on the face by a po-
liceman. After a congregation
at the main gate by the po-
lice, and the arrival of a

way upon women taking non-
violent direct action.

Late into the night of the
10th of March a group of us
painted peace symbols on the
surrounding wall of the base,
and later still, we experi-
enced horrendous treatment
and threatening behaviour
from armed military men whilst
we walked around the base
along the road provided. Shots
were fired from inside the
base over our heads and the
sound of guns recharging was
performed within hearing dis-
tance to intimidate us.

Friday the 11th of March...
most of the women who had
come for International Women's
Day were only able to stay
for a short time, so by now
we were a small number. For
this reason, those of us who
remained decided to blockade
only the road leading to the
main gate.

At the beginning of the
blockade (6 am) workers arr-
ived and we talked with them
about the necessity of our
actions. They listened, talk-
ed in response, and many of
them turned around in their
vehicles. The blockade
lasted for about an hour dur-
ing which time we experienced
yet more police violence. A
smartly dressed man who ob-
viously had a certain ‘auth-
ority' and was waving with
frantic gestures, the police
came and arrested 12 of us.
After undergoing two hours
of waiting in a police van
and six hours in Ragusa police
station where photographs,
fingerprints and other 'de-
tails' were ‘extracted’ from
us, although our cooperation
was minimal, we were then

As we go to press, meager
bits and pieces of news are
slipping through the net of
censorship and repression
surrounding Chile -- "Gener-
al Strike", "Millions Pro-
testing Pinochet Regime",
"Thousands Lose Jobs in Mas-
sive Anti-government Pro-
tests", etc. Despite a vir-
tual news blockade, one
senses and knows that power-
ful and courageous movements
are rocking the fascist
stranglehold that was forced
on the Chilean people almost
10 years ago through U.S. in-
tervention, and in the weeks
to come a fuller news picture
should emerge.

While we all wait and hope

taken to the women's section
of Ragusa jail.

Due to the twenty-four hour
delay in medical treatment,
in which time we spent energy
on insistence and more insis-
tence, the woman's broken arm
had re-set badly and had to
be re-broken. She then spent
two days and two nights alone
in a locked cell with two
armed guards (one of whom had
originally broken her arm).
After five days in prison
we were no clearer as to our
possible situation, we knew
only this: that we were char-
ged with blocking a road
(which has a penalty of 2 to
12 years, the ‘creator’ of
the law being Mussolini) and
had been denounced by a farmer
owning a piece of land near
the main gate of the base,
for ‘invasion of private
land." This man had before
given his permission for the
International Peace Camp to
be there. While we were in
jail we also learned that
police had evicted the camp
and burned it to the ground.
On the sixth day, Wednesday
the 16th of March we were
hustled into Ragusa police
station where we managed to
decipher that eleven of us
who are of ‘foreign’ nation-
ality, were to be deported
from the country that night.
We refused to sign the expul-
sion order. We were purposely
led into confusion. Advantage
was taken by the police be-
cause most of us do not speak
or understand Italian. ‘We

for more news, each of us in
our communities should be
looking for ways we can aid
in this struggle, review and
teach each other the history
of the Chilean drive towards
socialism and its subsequent
loss to the U.S. backed
fascist junta, and prepare to
take quick action to keep
the U.S. from further mili-
tary intervention.

September 11, 1983 marks
10 years since the overthrow
of the peoples’ government.
Our support for the Chilean
people should be especially
visible on that day.

This struggle is our
struggle, a deep source of
national shame and an inspir-
ation to anti-fascist people
everywhere.
