KCFR - Flowing Through the Airways With “Woman Alive”

Glenna Booth

KCFR, 90.1 FM, long of low
wattage and reaching mainly its
immediate neighborhood, is
now radiating 26,500 watts
from Lookout Mountain. It is
receiving increased attention
from National Public Radio (the
radio equivalent of Public Broad-
casting System), and some
money from Denver University.
However, it is still primarily a
listener-sponsored station, with
only six or seven paid staffers —
the rest volunteers.

As a public access station,
KCFR is open to new programs,
new directions. Women are as
welcome at the station as men. It

is necessary for anyone to hang
around for a while and go to a
few staff meetings to show
serious intent, but after that, you
are trained.

The KCFR staff currently con-
sists of about 20 people and
operates on a consensus basis.
Everyone is encouraged to do
everything, and the staff line is
horizontal, rather than vertical.
There is little show of competi-
tion at the station, since
everyone regards it as a creative
outlet.

The main ingredient of radio
creativity, like any other art, is
dedication. For instance, the re-

a leap of consciousness, but I
submit that in order for a radical
feminist to be truly integrated, to
be whole, and in harmony on all
levels, she must be a Lesbian.
Feminist Lesbianism as a
political/social/sexual/spiritual
reality is an integrated lifestyle
which affirms in every way the
Cosmic Covenant of Sisterhood.
Bisexuality —
The Golden Mean?

I am saying that Lesbian
Feminism is the melding of the
personal and the political, of
emotional and intellectual. I am
not proselytizing. I am not trying
to appeal to guilt, but to what is
strong in women. Daly's
theories lend some insight into
heterosexual feminists’ reaction
to a celebration of Lesbianism. In
her section on “Existential
Courage and Transvaluation,”
Daly rejects the Aristotelian
theory of moral virtue. “Since
moral virtue was understood as
the mean between two ex-
tremes, prudence was under-
stood as a virtue in the intellect
which enabled one to steer
between two opposed vices... This
theory presupposes a view of
human life in which the emotions
are considered inferior to ‘reason,’
which is the summit of the
hierarchy of human faculties.” I
believe that heterosexual
feminists’ reaction to Lesbian
Feminists — that she will not ex-
clude half of the human race
from her life, or that she is really
“bi-sexual,” which is the ul-

timate freedom of sexuality, is
really a “reasoning” process,
that she has found the golden
mean — that truth is somewhere
in the middle. What she ignores
is that the entire world is off-
balance, and that a shift to the
middle or down the scale a bit, is
really an intellectual exercise
which avoids an intuitive reac-
tion from her deeper self.
Lesbian as
the Priestess

Daly also ignores that the
network of Lesbian Feminist
community which has been, for
the large part, the focal point of
spiritual re-creation, particularly
in rediscovery of the Wicca, of
astrology, and of female
festivals, such as Summer
Solstice, which has been
celebrated for two years in New
Mexico, and which has been
organized by Lesbian Feminists.
The energy that is created when
women join in love is more than
one plus one ... it is energy that
can create a revolution in which
everything is possible. It is no
wonder, then, that Lesbians re-
sent the withdrawal of that
energy and creativity from
women and its displacement
with men.

The joining of a Lesbian com-
munity is like the joining of a
coven of witches. Speak the un-
speakable word. Exorcise the in-
ternalized “demon that divides
the self against the self.” All you
have to do to become a witch is
to say three times to yourself: “I
am a witch; I am a witch; I am
a witch.” It is the same thing.

The recent 40-minute segment on Big Mama Rag took about 15-20
hours of preparation. However,
with dedication, it is possible to
transform an idea into an audio
reality.

“Women Alive” is one such
transformation. In the KCFR
guide, it is described as “... a
forum for the expression of
women’s feelings and concerns.
It includes a mixture of women’s
poetry and prose, discussions of
issues important to women, and
features on local women.”

“Women Alive” was in-
novated about a year and a half
ago when Marty Durlin, now a

d.j., programmer and station co-
ordinator, went into KCFR with
the concept of a short program
on contemporary women poets.
Aside from the women working
on the program, “Black Focus,”
she was the only woman in-
volved in programming.

Marty and another woman,
Roni Tagliaferri, produced a
weekly program on contemporary
women poets — each running 15 to 30 minutes — for
about six months. They also did a
series of documentaries on
writers such as Sylvia Plath,
Colette, Anaïs Nin, and a moving
reading of women’s erotic
poetry. These are considered as
some of their best efforts,
because they gave full range to
the beautiful voices of both Mar-
ty and Roni.

As the show moved into a
looser format, that of a general
“feminist program,” it also mov-
ed into greater difficulty. The
concept that there was interest
in “any woman, doing anything,
any time,” simply did not always
work in audio. They discovered
that a program must be visually
demanding, or a bored audience
would be the result.

An illness in her family forced
Roni’s involvement with
“Women Alive” to be curtailed.
Beth Sheker has stepped in to
take her place in the creation of
the programs. Beth, in addition
to being a mother to four
children, is a poet and dramatist.
From her frustration at trying to
write poetry while caring for four
children, was born a three-voice
interdialogue centering around
the idea that schizophrenia is a
normal state for women today.
She read this with Marty and
Roni on the air. The drama, and
some on-the-air poetry readings
brought her to “Women Alive”
as Roni was going out.

Both Beth and Marty are
mothers. It is much to the credit
of the financially-poor KCFR that
a portion of PBS grant money is
paid to those with children, to
defray the cost of day care. So
while they are not making much
money at KCFR, at least it isn't
costing them anything to be
there.

Tobi Kanter, a mass com-
munications graduate student at
DU, has done one program for
“Women Alive,” but generally
prefers to “work for myself.”
She did an interview with Cassie
Culver, the vibrant singer who
appeared at a BMA benefit. Tobi
has also done several book
reviews and a poetry reading at
the Quaker meeting house.

Big Mama Rag was recently
the subject of a “Women Alive”
documentary. The transition

voice flowing between
segments of BMA staffers
belongs to Suki Levin, a
volunteer newswriter for the
station. This was her first
collaboration with the program.

The women involved with
“Women Alive” feel that its
growth has been very similar to
that of Big Mama Rag. They have
gone from the structureless
“everybody, everything” con-
cept, to programming with more
focus and direction. Open-ended
air time is there to use to fully
develop their themes.

Some innovative programs
have been completed and more
are on the way. A show was
done on women in prison, with
an interview with Esther Mon-
toya and some women from the
Montview Girls School.

“Male Chauvinism” was an in-
triguing program just completed.
The raw material was garnered
from an advertisement re-
questing replies from male
chauvinists. Among those inter-
viewed on the air were Denver
Post staff writer Dan Goldman,
Paul Cohen, publisher of a DU
circulated magazine called
Macho, and for contrast, a man
who teaches LaMaze method,
does half the housework, etc.
The women did the program
with the idea that they would
“not go into it with anything to
prove,” and regard it as a real
learning experience.

Beth characterized “Women
Alive” as a program which is
“combining energies to appeal
to most women, trying to get
away from the separatist idea —
to make a creative society for
everyone.”

A tentative schedule for
programs in the near future in-
cludes:
December 6 — Women and
children
December 13 — Women and
pain
December 20 — Abortion
December 27 — Doris Lessing
January 3 — Raw Honey

“Women Alive” is on the air
every Friday evening at 7 p.m.
and repeated at 12 noon on the
following Tuesday. Marty Durlin
works as a KCFR disc jockey on
Sundays and Mondays from 2
p.m. to 6 p.m.

KCFR has published a guide to
programming, which is edited by
Laurie Arnow, another woman
on the staff. A free monthly
schedule can be obtained by
calling the station, 753-3437,
and requesting that your name
be added to the mailing list.

Feedback is of great impor-
tance to the women producing
“Women Alive,” so call them or

your ideas, criticisms,
suggestions or congratulations.
