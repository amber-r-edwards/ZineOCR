Women’s Music Is Heard

Libby Atkins

If it weren't for the music  
Bringing us together in  

a natural way,  
I'd still be looking for  

a way to say:  
I want to be your good friend.  
(Cris Williamson from  
“If It Weren't For  

the Music”)  

After the Cris Williamson and  
Margie Adam concert in Denver,  
I experienced a profound  
sadness. I knew that I could not  
hear women’s music just  
anywhere. I could not turn on my  
radio and hear a woman sing  
about her own experiences. For-  
tunately, I had gotten a little 45  
at the concert from Joyce  
Hawkins who was distributing  
for Olivia Records. The record  
contained a cut of Williamson's  
and one of Meg Christian's, but I  
wanted to be able to hear more  
women-identified musicians  
and their music.  

I found myself sitting quietly  
the next day after the concert  
trying desperately to remember  
the songs, the words, the music.  
I knew that I had heard my  
music, women’s music, for the  
first time in 28 years. It was a  
music that had been buried in-  
side and joyously revealed to me  
in the music of Williamson and  
Adam. I knew a void had been  
filled — a part of me re-created,  
recognized and healed. But  
there remained the agonizing  
reality that I could not hear this  
music anywhere again in the  
near future.  

Control the Music?  

Years ago I had not com-  
prehended what Plato had  
meant in the Dialogues, when  
he stated that in the ideal state,  
music should be controlled. Why  
would anyone want to control  

music? Indeed, how could  
anyone control music?  
The word “music” derives  

from the Greek word “Muse.”  
The Muses were 9 sisters in  
Greek mythology presiding over  
song, poetry, and the arts and  
sciences. Hence, any art presid-  
ed over by the Muses was music.  
If we understand that mythology  
is merely the deeds of ancient  
heroes sifted through time and re-  
telling, we come to the conclu-  
sion that women were the artists  
of ancient civilizations.  
(Elizabeth Gould Davis, The First  
Sex, states that women were  
probably the rulers before  
recorded history and this grand  
universe was believed to have  
been presided over by the Great  
Goddess.)  

What happened? When did  
women cease to be creators of  
art? Perhaps it was when men  
discovered that the one who  
controls music, controls the  
masses. That is probably when  
women were relegated to  
producing the masses (children)  
and denied the creation of art.  

Plato obviously knew the  
power of music. He knew those  
who controlled the arts were ful-  
ly in control. Government by  
men, right? There it is...  

From another perspective the  
I Ching, hexagram Yu,  
(Enthusiasm), states that rulers  
have always understood the  
power in music (the arts and  
sciences).  

“Joy and relief make  
themselves felt (through music).  
So too, music has power to ease  
tension within the heart and so  
loosen the grip of obscure  
emotions. The enthusiasm of  
heart expresses itself involun-  
tarily in a burst of song, in dance  
and rhythmic movement of the  
body. From immemorial times  
the inspiring effect of the sound  
that moves all hearts and draws  

them together, has mystified  
mankind. “Rulers have made  
use of this natural taste for  
music; they have elevated and  
regulated it.”  

Confucius then is quoted as  
elaborating upon this wisdom  
saying: “He who could wholly  
comprehend this . . . (the power  
of music) could rule the world as  
though it were spinning on his  
(sic) hand.”  

Spinning Too Long  

And spinning we have been as  
women. Keep ‘em confused and  
away from the centers of power.  
(Often I wonder just exactly  
where the pejorative cliché “diz-  
zy broad” derived and why.) And  
spinning is where all women ar-  
tists have been for too long.  
Spinning their wheels to make it,  
to be recognized and revealed in  
their art to their peers. Women  
who dare to proclaim  
themselves as women artists  
are systematically denied en-  
trance to museums, shows,  
access to the media by critics  
who scarcely know they exist,  
and disc jockeys who deem  

anything that is woman-  
identified as bizarre and un-  
worthy of their listening  
audience. ‘Does it make  

money?” becomes the qualifying  
factor for recognition. Men, by  
monopolizing and dictating what  
shall reach the masses, by  
carefully screening all avenues  
to recognition, have effectively  
achieved and maintained control  
of the music — of the Muses.  
How funny that we are just  
now discovering long-lost  
women artists. How many are  
yet to be discovered? What  
anguish have women even in  
our own time suffered to have  
their creations recognized. Emily  
Dickinson's works were dis-  
covered after her death. Ger-  
trude Stein was dismissed and  
compared to a lunatic, Mabel  
Dodge Luhan, a great patron of  
art and artists who boldly wrote  
of her feelings as a woman,  
managed to get three volumes  
published. Yet, the majority of  
her works have been se-  
questered away within the  
hallowed archives of Yale Un-  

iversity by her son, lest they  
make too revealing disclosures  
which might embarrass friends  
and family. What of the terrible  
dues extracted from Sylvia Plath  
and Janis Joplin for daring to  
declare themselves as women  
and artists and proceed accor-  
dingly? Most recently the story  
of Antonia Brico who was  
callously denied her own instru-  
ment, the orchestra. But we're  
discovering these women and  
gaining the strength and insight  
necessary not to allow this to  
happen again.  

While in San Francisco last  
Thanksgiving, we visited the Full  
Moon Coffee House and were  
delighted with the music of the  
Berkeley Women’s Music  
Collective. I kept having feelings  
of déjà vu. I knew that I had been  
in a similar situation before.  
Later, I realized that I had been  
there back in the early sixties —  
a time when we were going to  
the coffee houses to hear music,  
see theater and experience  
poetry that we knew we could  
not get anywhere else. Only  
now, instead of the men doing  
their art, we are seeing the  
women doing theirs. It is the  
women this time who are  
gathering in little-known and  
unpublicized sanctuaries to hear  
their own music.  

Women are stopping this spin-  
ning, dizzy world and reclaiming  
what their ancient sisters, the  
Muses, had created — the  
Music. It is woman-identified  
music. It is music by women, for  
women and to women. It is  
political, joyous, filled with life  
and love. It is music vibrating for  
the first time in the souls of  
women who have never heard  
their music. It is healing.  

Womanchief is Born  

How does one go about foster-  
ing woman-identified music? In  
the music industry today, it is a  
terrific and terrifying struggle for  
a woman to obtain recognition.  
Already in the larger cities on the  
east and west coasts of the  
country, there are coffee houses  
and places where women can  
present their art. “Lavender  
Jane” was recorded on the  

Women’s Waxworks label in  
New York and Olivia Records in  
Washington, D.C. has just  
released their first album with  
Meg Christian. These are recor-  
ding companies run by and for  
women. Women all over the  
country are beginning to awaken  
to the possibilities of touring and  
getting their music out to  
women.  

Here in Denver, a group of us  
have decided to create a produc-  
tion company for women. We  
call it Womanchief Productions.  
The outfit derives its name from  
an unknown warrior and chief-  
tain of the Cheyenne Indians  
who was a woman. We want to  
assist women musicians in ob-  
taining an audience with their  
peers — to be heard.  
Womanchief will produce only  
women musicians and women’s  
bands comprised solely of  
women, for as one woman so  
astutely observed, when men  
are in a group or playing as  
backup musicians it completely  
changes the character of the  
music. We know too that it is  
expensive to travel and hard to  
live without some kind of support  
from the community, so we hope  
to charge $2.00 per show per  
person and hopefully we will be  
doing some benefits for the  
women’s communities in  
Denver and Boulder.  

It is difficult to do this kind of  
thing without some kind of  
suitable place to perform, i.e.,  
not too large and expensive (that  
takes money away from the  
musicians and it usually goes to  
the man) that contains a piano  
and will be conducive to an in-  
timate atmosphere for the  
listeners and artists. We would  
greatly appreciate any informa-  
tion relating to suitable places to  
perform.  

We are open to suggestions  
and would love to hear from  
women musicians who would  
like to perform for other women  
in the Denver area. Currently we  
are working towards bringing  
the Berkeley Women’s Music  

Collective to Denver and/or  
Boulder in the third week of  
March. For further information

Productions, 2312 Bluff Street,  
Boulder, Colorado, 80302,
