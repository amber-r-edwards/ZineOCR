The New Woman's Survival  
Sourcebook (successor to the  
New Woman's Survival Catalog)  
comes about as close to being an  
encyclopedia of the woman's  
movement as can be envisioned. It contains sources, re-  
sources and essays on every  
aspect of our lives from money to  
the arts to self-defense. It is easy  
reading, it looks good and it costs  
the same as the mother volume  
of two years ago, though it offers  
much more.

The Sourcebook devotes equal  
depth and scope to the social,  
political and cultural aspects of  
the women’s movement. The  
attention to detail is gratifying. In  
every instance one is given  
complete information on the  
availability of an item, its cost,  
how to get it, where to get  
additional information, who to  
write to and what to expect  
when you do. It is more than  
satisfactorily thorough in all in-  
stances.

Insight

The addition of essays in this  
issue of the book provides an  
explanation and interpretation  
of the various aspects of our  
movement. There are essays in  
all categories of the book. While  
these essays do, of course, re-  
present the opinions of the  
editors (opinions with which one  
might not always agree), they  
nonetheless offer insightful and  
useful background material,  
developmental accounts, and  
future projections.

A discussion of the potential  
power and effect of feminist  
credit unions as an economic  
force for our revolution is one  
example. Another is an inter-  
view with Robin Morgan and  
Adrienne Rich on the relevance  
of culture to the goals of  
feminism.

Organization

The way the book is organized  
reflects a successful effort to  
leave liquid the boundaries  
between the different areas of  
our lives. At the same time,  

content is logically broken down  
in a way that makes the book  
easy to use.

The editors were forced to  
leave out nearly half the material  
they had collected for the book  
due to space limitations and  
materials costs. The layout has  
been designed in such a way as  
to use virtually all available  
space, but in no way is the effect  
crowded or cramped.

The editing process was  
handled with a clear sense of  
priorities. In categories where  
cuts had to be made, re-  
presentative projects which  
would themselves serve as re-  
sources were used. Complete  
listings are available through  
several sources, always made  
clear in the Sourcebook.

Successes

Certainly, the book has some  
shortcomings: the graphics are  
not always sharp, and the  
interpretation of facts is sometimes  
one-sided. But to dwell on these  
would be nit-picking indeed.  
What is more significant, and  
exciting, are the book's  
successes.

It is attractive, it is packed full  
of information, it is easily used  
and the cost is the same as two  
years ago — a remarkable  
achievement. The editors took a  
cut in their royalties to maintain  
that price, one they felt would be  
within the range most women  
could afford to pay. The book  
reflects a standard of profes-  
sionalism which all women can  
be proud of.

With their first book, the  
editors appropriated 20% of the  

royalties to help finance  
women’s projects. Olivia  
Records, her-self newspaper  

and Diana Press benefited from  
grants thus made available. This  
time the funds are being  
channeled back into what is to  
be yet another transformation of  
the Catalog.

Given the rate of growth of the  
women’s movement, a publica-

years cannot keep up with the  
rapidly growing body of

Born to Struggle

“Don't let anybody shit on  
you,” May Hobbs’ foster mother  
advised, “and always stick up for  
what you think is right.” That’s  
what May Hobbs did. Her book  
Born to Struggle (Daughters,  
1975) details both the oppres-  
sion she suffered as a working-  
class woman in London's East  
End and the fierce wit, will, and  
energy which she found to fight  
it.

The book divides roughly into  
three parts: a sketch of her early  
life, a history of the London Night  
Cleaners Strike, and a chapter  
on “the arts and crafts” of  
survival in a world where crafti-  
ness is as crucial as it is com-  
munal. It is the strong sense of  
community, of solidarity among  
people who know that no one  
will help them except them-  
selves, that knits these three  
parts together.

Hobbs, born in 1938, had four  
homes before the age of thir-  
teen. By twelve, she and her  
friend Mary were pushing the  
little lords of Eton into the mud,  
but at fifteen, told by the Youth  
Employment Officer that women  
don't “have careers,” she em-  
barked on a series of dead-end  

Big Mama Rag  

jobs in factories that might have  
been owned by Etonians: a shoe  
factory, a tool factory, a candy  
factory, factories making boxes,  
tea, Christmas cards, and  
watches.  
Politics  

May's advice to complainers is  
terse: “You're always moaning.  
Why not do something in-  
stead?” After organizing some  
small strikes, after marriage,  
pregnancy, the jailing of her  
husband, the death of her foster  
mother, a month in jail herself,  
two more pregnancies, and an  
eviction notice, she decided to do  
something on a big scale: “Right,  
I thought, I'll really get into the  
politics of things.” And she does.

At the time she was working  
as a night cleaner, one of the  
corps of exploited women who  
mop the office buildings of rich  
capitalist and government firms.  
Her hours were 10 PM to 6 AM  
five nights a week; her pay was  
£9, about $25. The enemies  
were the firms themselves, the  
cleaning contractors they hired  
(contractors who as a group  
amassed profits of over $280  
million a year by paying the  
women not much over 36¢ an  
hour), and, finally, the male  
officers of the trade unions who  
inched closer to the govern-  
ment as they edged closer to  
power. May and the women had  
to do it themselves.

The chapter detailing the  
organization of the Cleaners  

Action Group and tracing the  
major strikes of 1971 and 1972  
is the center of the book. For  
Americans, in our general fail-  
ure to link the forces of women’s  
unions and women’s liberation,  
it is the most salutary. In the  
picket lines at Night Cleaners  
strikes marched delegations  
from the Socialist Women and  
London Women's Liberation:  
May, in turn, spoke for the move-  
ment at a rally in Trafalgar  
Square.  
Heras  

The consciousness of the  
book, however, is largely class  
consciousness; there is little  
explicit feminism. There are  
jibes at Youth Employment Of-  
ficers and male union officials  
and good-natured pokes at men  
who keep their pay packets from  
their “old women,” but the  
women’s movement is always  
“Women’s Lib” and there are no  
conclusions drawn from the fact  
that the one thing that unites the  
capitalists, the contractors, and  
the conventional union hier-  
archy is their sex.

The heroes of this book, never-  
theless, are women: May's in-  
domitable foster mother, her  
feisty and resourceful friends,  
her fellow night cleaners, and,  
finally, May herself. “If I am a  
militant,” she says, “it’s what I  
see going on makes me into  
one.” She sees clearly; she takes  
no shit; she never fails to stand  
up for what she thinks is right.

Against Our Will... .

From Page 10  
though reporters were aware of  
it. Since women played a major  
role in military operations of the  
Viet Cong and fought as equals  
to men, rape was not as common  
an occurrence in the Viet Cong.  
But, Brownmiller writes, as the  
American presence in Viet Nam  
multiplied, the unspoken  
military theory of women’s  
bodies as a reward of war and a  
necessary provision like pop and  
ice cream to keep our boys  
healthy and happy became stan-  
dard policy.

As the war progressed  
prostitution became the only  
viable means of employment for  
many South Vietnamese women  
and by 1966 the Army had  
established military brothels  
within base camps.

Rape, gang rape and mutila-  
tion of women’s bodies was not  
an uncommon part of patrols in  
Vietnam. Brownmiller  
documents Vietnam rape  
atrocities well, and reveals the  
sexual abuse and rape that  
occurred at My Lai.

Slavery and Rape

Brownmiller discusses the Ku  
Klux Klan’s use of the terrorism  
of rape of both black and white  
women to chase off newly en-  
franchised black men after  
Reconstruction in the South.  
She effectively shows that sex-  
ual intimidation knows no racial  
distinctions, that battle lines are  
drawn on the bodies of women,  
whether they were Mormon  
women on the western frontier  
who were raped because of their  
religious/political beliefs or  
white women who were raped  
after the liberation of the Bel-  
gium Congo, or black women  
who were raped because their  
husbands/sons/fathers refused  
to give up their land and go  
north.

In her discussion of rape and  
slavery she shows how the rape  
of the black woman was built  
into the institution of slavery.  
The white master owned her  
body and used it to increase his  
slaves. Legally the concept of  
raping a slave didn’t exist. The  
rape of one man’s slave by  
another white man was con-  
sidered “trespass.” But the rape  
of one man’s slave by another  
slave had no official recognition  
at all.

The anti-slavery contingent of  
males in the country didn’t have  
any noticeably different aware-  
ness of women and equality.  
Any abuse of the body of a  
woman was seen as an abuse of  
the property of her husband or  
father. Even though slaves were  
not allowed to marry,  
abolitionists expressed sym-  
pathy for the husbands of the  

raped slaves.  
Current Rape Trends

An interesting discovery in the  
chapter on the Police Blotter  
Rapist was that rape has in-  
creased 62% in a 5-year period  
as compared to a 45% rise for  
other criminal acts. Brown-  
miller posits that this may be due  
to the fact that more women are  
reporting rapes, but she feels  
that it is most likely due to a rise  
in the hostility and violence that  
is directed at women. She  
describes the typical rapist as  
“little more than an aggressive,  
hostile youth who chooses to do  
violence to women.” Freudian  
psychology and its influence on  
thinking in criminality fostered  
totally inaccurate popular con-  
ception of rape, according to the  
author. She attributes this to the  
failure of the Freudians to make  
a moral judgment: they wanted  
to “understand” what they saw  
as “deviant sexual behavior,”  
but never to condemn. But the  
Freudians did condemn. They  
condemned women. They saw  
rapists as victims “of an uncon-  
trollable urge that was infantile  
and the result of thwarted  
natural impulse to have sex with  
their mothers.” Again, it is  
woman's fault that men rape.  
How convenient, since all  
humans must have mothers (at  
least at this point.)

Institutionalized Rape

Brownmiller devotes an entire  
chapter to institutionalized rape —  
police rape, prison rape, date  
rape, father rape and marriage  
rape. To me, these kinds of rape  
are the hardest to identify, to  
understand and to see the  
importance of. In these rapes,  
rapists tend to work within a  
dependent relationship which  
weakens the victim's resistance,  
distorts her perspective and con-  
founds her will. The therapist  
who suggests to his frigid  
patient that having sex with him  
will help her, is raping a vulner-  
able victim. The date who  
demands/manipulates a  
woman into sleeping with him is  
raping. Marriage laws that treat  
women as an extension of a man  
legally and economically en-  
courage rape.

Jagger the Rapist

In the Myth of the Heroic  
Rapist, Brownmiller shows how  
history’s memory of an event  
can be distorted if the object of  
some grotesque violence is a  
man, especially if there are  
sexual atrocities involved. Gilles  
de Rais, the original Bluebeard,  
actually abducted, raped and  
murdered between 40 and 100  
young boys in his castle in the  
15th century. But his legend,  
kept alive by male writers and in  

the movies, says he murdered 7  
of his wives. When his victims  
were women the horror of his  
deeds was diminished. For men,  
that is.

Jack the Ripper has been  
remembered as a hero of sorts  
and is actually revered for his  
murders of prostitutes.

Mick Jagger memorialized the  
Boston Strangler in the “Mid-  
night Rambler” and recreates  
the rape-murder of 23-year-old  
Beverley Samans in the song  
simulating violence and woman-  
hatred for sexual satisfaction.

Race and Rape

The chapter “A Question of  
Race” examines the issue of  
interracial rape. It is a chapter  
that few reviews include due to  
the potentially explosive nature  
of the subject matter, common  
misunderstandings and mis-  
conceptions of rape itself, and  
the tendency for white/black  
male (and some female) leftists  
to label anything that isn’t in  
complete sympathy with black  
militant politics as racist.

Brownmiller lays careful,  
well-documented groundwork  
of rape and the position of black  
and white women in the south  
during slavery and Reconstruc-  
tion to show how all women  
were viewed by the white man.  
With Reconstruction, the white  
southerner saw his property  
being threatened by the freedom  
of the black man. And his  
property included his white  
woman. A way to alleviate this  
threat was through charges of  
rape, whether real or not.

The white women “benefited”  
from this system only if she re-  
mained sexually subservient to  
white men. The pedestal she  
was placed on was based on her  
economic dependence, and the  
fastest way for her to get knock-  
ed off that pedestal was to show  
any inclination for sexual  
freedom, Brownmiller writes. In  
some states women were  
whipped and put into servitude if  
they had black lovers. If a white  
woman's reputation for chastity  
was open to question, she  
couldn’t be raped by a black man.  
So rape existed only in degrees.

Brownmiller criticizes leftists  
and liberals, radicals and  
revolutionaries who blame the  
white woman for her complicity  
in the white man’s rape  
lynchings, and who tend to  
believe that “when a black  
woman is raped the crime is  
political, but when a white  
woman is raped the charge is  
hysterical.”

She says that the black  
revolutionary position that it is  
politically alright to rape white
