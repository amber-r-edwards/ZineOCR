Margaret Sloan: “I’d hate to be a man and be judged by the size of
my paycheck. That must be a burden.”

Happy Birthday BMR

What is exciting about this birthday anniversary is that Big
Mama Rag is two years old, and while the first issue came out in
October of 1972, it was the culmination of nine months of
planning and organization. This makes Big Mama one of the
longest surviving feminist newspapers in the country - a fact
supplied to us by Susan and Kirsten, the women who compiled
the Women’s Survival Catalog.

Few papers have held it together that long. The fight against
the male system, against weariness, has worn away many
well-intentioned efforts. And, too, for many papers, discontinuing
has been a positive sign. The women involved went through many
changes as a result of their collective efforts, and their disbanding
meant that theory had grown, that it was time to implement their
learning, to refocus, to expand. Such has been the case with
excellent papers such as The Furies.

Big Mama has tried to grow in another way. BMR has changed
from a small operation into one reaching all across the country -
from New Orleans, to L.A. and Oregon, the Midwest, and up and
down the East Coast. Sales, circulation (over 3,000), and coverage
cut across class, geography and personal politics. Though we are
being read nationally, however, we want primarily to be a local
paper for Denver women, discussing issues relevant and
interesting to women here. True, the Women’s Movement needs
quarterlies like Quest and Amazon Quarterly which discuss the
mainstream of theory and tactics, it needs books like Amazon
Odyssey which delineate capacity and function in the continuing
redefinition of women.

But local networks of communication which reach out to
women in a personal way, which bring about grassroots support
and growth must also be part of the struggle. This is the vision
involved in BMR. Women who have begun questioning the
essence of their lives when they have seen articles discussed from
a feminist analysis, and over the past two years this has included
women in medical schools, motherhood, the unions, lesbianism
and its relationship to feminism, women in prison, the working
class women.

Contrary to what some reformists believe and would like to
mastermind women into thinking, BMR is THE ONLY TRULY
RADICAL PAPER IN THIS CITY. It is the only paper working at
changing the basic structure of this society.

It is attempting to do so by using print media in a subjective
way as opposed to the traditional false notion of objectivity laid
out by the straight press.

Revamping - that is what the women’s movement is all about
and the objectives of BMR work towards that larger aim rather
than success by its usual standards. We want the paper to be a
focus for women’s energies: to inspire, to activate, be it for a
women’s center, women’s voice, women’s civilization. That’s what
we're about and don’t miss the point. A society restructured on
the more feminine principle is the vision of feminists and this
paper, and when vision and word become one, that is Revolution.

Happy Birthday, Big Mama.

Black feminist, Margaret Sloan

one of two speakers, on loan
to Colorado Springs

to sink or swim today

to discuss the sex role

stereotyping of women today, today
being October 18th. A second thought,

another day, I might say
sex role stereo- come in

hi-fi. According to Sloan some

points are painful according to Hoyle

others are not.

All I can say really
happened that day I wrote a
poem at twilight, the rest was
herstory for I've never to the
Springs journeyed, I say to
present self to Black Femin-
ist. Venture I to say what that
pulled together one day or
whom. Well, a collective of
pants’ persons crossing Au-
tumn's campus w/M.S. heav-
ing for days. The altitude has
got her by the seat of her
drawers while I dream sketch-
es in the friendly air.

Women join Margaret Sloan
in Black Student Union at 3,
three. Sketches: 3 Black, 7
white (if one wants to speak
opposites instead of Octaves).
Who creates or recreates or
reaffirms the stereo sex role?
Specially rolled around a big
fat cullid woman who hit the
road to speak for herself. Ms
Sloan is big enough to stand
at the front lines and shield us
all who dare not come out of
our points of pain, speak
about it.

As I say I felt moved to do
an evening poem proceeding
Sloan’s 7:30 speech in a
Chapel, Black students
who conspicuously missed the
Union rap came out to
Chapel, Shove Chapel full
of men and ladies. They
can't resist the humor and
vocality of Sloan's rap!
Certainly her vocality of spirit
is matching her physicality, 
remindful of silence as
greatest point of pain.

Earlier in the day at Hotel
Antlers a door slams, a
woman escort from Virginia
Neal Blue Center had made a
hasty exit from one of the
many corners the BMR right
hers had cornered or circled
Margaret Rose Sloan (M.R.S.)
yuk, yuk, lady exits barely
holding self together. Margar-
et says, “why didn’t I ask that
woman if she has a drinking
problem?” Point of pain.
Silence Some do and some
don’t.

M.R.S. says she gonna diet
after the holidays but holidays
are about a family eat-in going
down. Turkey, look out!

So anyway Libby Borsch
from Littleton’s Women’s Re-
source Center along with Ms
Sloan, we two from BMR and
four other good persons from
Littleton’s Women’s Resource
were circled again around
Margaret Sloan over some
lunch at a round table trading
information. I turned to Carol
and suggested a picture of
women at the round table
sans self-consciousness, af-
ternooning it with the Black
Feminist Dynamo from New
York.

All agree and are aware of
the stereotypes and perhaps
sitting in the direction of go,
the point where pain changes
to joy.
