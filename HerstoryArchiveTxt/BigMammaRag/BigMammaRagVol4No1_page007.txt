Save Us from Those Weird-o's, Ronald! — “Perhaps Ronald Reagan  
will be able to save us from the loud minority demands of radical  
feminists for free abortion for all.” (Rosemary Hamilton in a letter to  
Time, Dec. 15, 1975)  

My Sentiments Exactly — I recently gave one of my favorite buttons to  
a friend of mine who was then employed as an art director at a local  
advertising agency. The button, which proclaimed “Lesbian Feminist,”  
was given with the stipulation that it be worn to work for at least three  
days. Most people either looked over, under, around or through the  
ornament with no comment. One woman employee, however, confined  
with my friend on the elevator, took a look at the button out of the corner  
of her eye. “My sentiments exactly!” she laughed, as they went their  
separate ways. Neither woman had spoken to each other before — or  
since!  

Ah, C’mon Boys — Along with the disclosure that Hoover's FBI  
harassed Martin Luther King Jr., has come other interesting revela-  
tions. In the 1960s the FBI, trying to disrupt a women’s liberation  
protest demonstration, arranged for several white mice to be released  
at the event. (Time, Dec. 1, 1975)  

Notorious Woman — Masterpiece Theatre has been doing a special on  
George Sand, the nineteenth-century French novelist who often wore  
men’s clothes, smoked cigars, and had at least one affair with a woman.  
Believe it or not, Masterpiece in its snobby way, didn’t completely cop  
out on George's relationship with women. In the TV version, however,  
George and her woman lover are accosted in bed by the latter's  
outraged male lover. He says something original to George like, “I forbid  
you to ever see my woman again, Monsieur!” Of course we are led to  
believe that “Monsieur” complies and the two never see each other  
again. Sand later goes on to become involved with the real love of her  
life, Freddy Chopin. She is, after all, basically straight and her involve-  
ment with a woman was only one more way to defy society — well,  
according to Masterpiece anyhow.  

Up Your Royal You-Know-What — Prince Charles has recently  
announced that he just doesn’t dig the women’s movement. “Women’s  
Liberationists rather annoy me because they tend to argue all the time  
and start calling you a male chauvinist pig.” Which of course Prince C. is  
not. (Free For All, Nov. 20 - Dec. 11)  

Just Like Everybody Else? — Andrea Kincses Oberstone and Harriet  
Sukoneck gave a battery of tests to 50 single women, half of them  
lesbian and half hetero. The women ranged in age from 20 to 45 and  
were also matched for education and income. The researchers didn't  
find any differences between the two groups on any test of psychologi-  
cal adjustment. They also couldn’t find differences in drinking or drug  
abuse, suicide attempts, relationships with parents, satisfaction with  
work, and many other lifestyle issues. Do you think this means that  
psychologists will start treating dykes like everyone else? — which may  
not necessarily be a good thing. (Psychology Today, Dec. 1975)  

P.S. — I have heard rumors, however, that all psychologists aren't bad.

Puerto Rican Sterilizations  

The 18 sterilization centers  
now operating in Puerto Rico  
perform up to 150 sterilizations  
each month. 5,000 women were  
sterilized in 1974, and the figure  
for 1975 is expected to run to  
over 6,800. Puerto Rico has the  
world’s highest incidence of  
sterilization, with 35% of women  
of childbearing age now sterile.  
The operation is funded by the  
U.S. Department of Health,  
Education and Welfare, and is  
free to the women who undergo  
it. Many of the women are not  
informed of the effect of the  
operation, which is offered as a  
form of birth control.

National Women’s  
Agenda Created  

The National Women’s Agen-  
da was an initiative taken by the  
U.S. women’s community in res-  
ponse to International Women’s  
Year. International Women’s  
Year 1975 mandated that each  
member of the United Nations  
focus on its own problems and  
gains in women’s rights. Des-  
pite their readiness to help meet  
this mandate, many U.S. women  
and women’s organizations felt  
they had virtually no vehicle  
through which to participate in  
the United States IWY planning  
and activities. In response to this  
situation, the Women’s Action  
Alliance, a non-profit resource  
center for women’s organiza-  
tions, contacted nationally bas-  
ed women’s groups interested in  
women’s issues. From these  
contacts and many meetings  
came the first National Women’s  
Agenda.  

The Preamble reads: We,  
women of the United States of  
America, join together to chal-  
lenge our Nation to complete the  
unfinished work of achieving a  
free and democratic society,  
begun long ago by our Founding  
Mothers and Fathers. Join us as  
we commit our lives, hearts,  
energies and talents to the  
attainment of this goal.  

In creating the first National  
Women’s Agenda, we are mak-  
ing explicit demands on our  
Government, and on the private  
sector as well. Firm policies and  
programs must be developed  
and implemented at all levels in  
order to eliminate those in-  
equities that still stand as bar-  
riers to the full participation by  
women of every race and group.  
For too long, the nation has been  
deprived of women’s insights  
and abilities. It is imperative that  
women be integrated into  
national life.  

We are women with interests  
and roots in every sector and at  
every level of society. Although  
our programs and goals may  
vary, still we have agreed upon  
issues which must be addressed  
as national priorities so that  
women will play a full and equal  
role in this country.  

Diverse as we are, we are  
united by the deep and common  
experience of womanhood. As  
we work toward our common  
goals, we insist upon the pro-  
tection of this diversity, and call  
for the simultaneous elimina-  
tion of all the insidious forms of  
discrimination, not only those  
based on gender, but also on  
race, creed, ethnicity, class, life-  
style, sexual preference, and  
age.  

Full realization of our Agenda  
also requires commitment to  
peace as fundamental to a free  
society, and attainment of the  
Constitutional guarantees of  
equal rights. Without these,  
women’s rights in the society  
will be neither guaranteed nor  
preserved.  

The U.S. National Women’s  
Agenda declares full equality  
under law, as embodied in the  
Equal Rights Amendment, to be  
essential to the equality of op-  
portunity and access for women  
in all aspects of life, including  
specifically:  

Fair representation and parti-  
cipation in the political process.  

Meaningful work and ade-  
quate compensation.  

Equal access to economic  
power.  

Quality child care for all  
children.  

Quality health care and ser-  
vices.  

Adequate housing.  
Just and humane treatment in  
the criminal justice system.  

Fair treatment by and equal  
access to media and the arts.  

Physical safety.  

Respect for the individual.
