Arrernte Fight Flooding Of Sacred Land

A nationwide appeal began  
recently in Alice Springs,  
Australia, to support 50 Abor-  
iginal traditional owners and  
custodians who have set up a  
camp near their sacred site  
Welatye Therre to prevent the  
Northern Territory Government  
flooding the area for a recre-  

australia  

ation lake. This report is  
from a Northern Territory cor-  
respondent who has been to  

the camp to speak to the trad-  
itional owners.  

Hilda Rice is a woman in her  
sixties. In her own language,  
translated here, she told a  
video crew from the Central  
Australian Aboriginal Media  
Association why she left the  
comfort of her new house in  
the family's town camp to move  
back to the river bank north  
of the town.  

"I was born here, in my  
grandfather's country, in my  
father's country, and it was  
here I grew up from the time  
I was a baby. That's why I've  
come back here to camp, be-  
cause I'm afraid that dam  
might be built here; to stop  
that welfare mob, no, that  
government mob, from building  
a dam. I've camped here with  
my brother Howard, with my  
family, with all of our child-  
ren."  

Hilda, her brother Howard  
Stevens and her husband Willie  
Rice are the senior members  
of a group of 50 traditional  
owners and custodians who 10  
days ago reoccupied the area  
they call Inketyene, a few  
kilometres north of the Alice  
Springs township. To the white  
town, the area is part of the  
Old Telegraph Station Historic  
Reserve, site of the first  
government outpost established  
in Central Australia. To the  
local Arrernte people the area  
has other significance.  

It contains important sites  
of the "Two Women Dreaming,"  

a story line or dreaming track  
which extends across the con-  
tinent from Port Augusta in  
the south as far north as the  
Tiwi Islands off the coast  
from Darwin. The major site  

in the area is Welatye Therre  
(translation: Two Breasts), a  
place where women have danced  
and sung for thousands of  
years to assert and strengthen  
their unique relationship with  
the country.  

As if this wasn't important  

enough to warrant preservation  
of the area, the Old Telegraph  
Station was for a great many  
years the main Aboriginal re-  
serve in the vicinity of Alice  
Springs. Known to the people  
as “The Bungalow," this was  
the place where people re-  
treated as the expanding town  
and pastoral properties  

pushed them out of other  
areas. Here many local Abor-  
iginal people were born; it  
was here they grew up, and  
where they learned the skills  
and the law and the ceremonies  
of traditional Aboriginal  
culture. Because of the peo-  
ple's special relationship to  
the land, this place is there-  
fore an integral part of Ab-  
original identity in Central  
Australia.  

Welatye Therre is a regis-  
tered sacred site, protected,  
in theory, under Territory  
legislation. From bitter ex-  
perience, the Arrernte peo-  
ple know how little this can  
mean. A few months ago anoth-  
er registered site near the  
town was bulldozed to make  
way for a road. So when Chief  
Minister Everingham announced  
his intention to begin work  
on the dam this winter, the  
people decided to take direct  
action. Everingham's view is  
callously simple. He said in  

~Photographer Unknown  

the Territory Assembly, "The  
site itself will not be phys-  
ically damaged, but will be  
submerged." The traditional  
owners and custodians' re-  
sponse is summed up by Terry  
Rice, one of Hilda's sons:  
"When they come with their  
machines to build the lake,  
we will tell them to get off.  
We will not move from here.  
They have already destroyed  
some of our sacred sites and  
objects. What more do they  
want?"  

Everingham's resolve to go  
ahead with the dam appears  
to have been strengthened by  
a campaign in favor of the  
lake organized by a local bus-  
inessman. Petitions and pos-  
ters supporting the lake ap-  
peared several weeks ago in  
many Alice Springs shops and  
nearly 5000 signatures were  
collected. The organizers got  
free time on local commercial  
radio to press their cause.  
Although the pro-dam argument,  
which has been around in one  
form or another in Alice  
Springs for 20 years, has al-  
ways centered on the needs of  
residents for a water sports  
venue, this time, the publici-  
ty claimed the dam would pre-  
vent flooding of the town. On  
this basis, it seems, many  
people with vivid memories of  

the floods of a few weeks ago,  
which claimed several lives,  
signed the petition.  

The local Environment Coun-  
cil and also the ALP Branch  
have pointed to the opportun-  
ism in this move. Last week  
both groups called for a full  
study of the environmental  
impact of a dam and its flood  
mitigation effect. They say  
its ability to prevent flood-  
ing is not clear. Moreover,  
they say, there are demon-  
strated health risks in a  
large body of water lying near  
the town, as similar dams at  
Mt. Isa and Kununurra have  
shown.  

Clyde Holding, Federal  
Aboriginal Affairs Minister, was  
in Alice Springs the day the  
site occupation began. He has  
since written to Everingham  
calling for a postponement  
of work, and the establish-  
ment of a committee of the  
Federal government, the Terr-  
itory government and the  
traditional owners to look at  
alternatives.  

Meanwhile the traditional  
owners are calling for nat-  
ional support. "We particu-  
larly want support from Ab-  
original people from the  
whole Northern Territory and  
Central Australia and the  
rest of Australia too," said  
Thomas Stevens after a meet-  
ing at the camp site last  
week. "We want the National  
Aboriginal Conference to or-  
ganize a meeting of all Ab-  
original organizations in  
the Northern Territory to  
stop this dam.”  

The group is also calling  
for support from Aboriginal  
organizations and European  
sympathizers. Basil Stevens,  
another member of the group,  
said, "We need warm clothes  
for the kids and the old peo-  
ple, and blankets and ground-  
sheets. We also need a food  
safe, a two-way radio and a  
medical kit.“  

The struggle to prevent the  
lake poses big problems. The  
traditional owners have al-  
ready had to reveal much more  
about the site than they nor-  
mally would. They are endur-  
ing the cold and this week  
the rain with minimal shel-  
ter. They do not own a vehi-  
cle, and depend on support-  
ers for transport to and  
from town for supplies. Some  
of the old people are quite
