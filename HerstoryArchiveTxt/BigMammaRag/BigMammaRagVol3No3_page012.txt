Trichomonas: This is another vaginal infection caused by a tiny
one-celled animal that has little whip-like tentacles that help it
swim around.

Symptoms: Once again the vulva and outer vagina will itch and
become inflamed (sometimes the rectum will become inflamed
also). The discharge will be greenish-yellow and either slimy or
foamy and the smell will be rather odorous.

Treatment: The only cure that doctors have used thus far is a drug
called Flagyl or metronidazole which is taken orally. It is
expensive and causes uncomfortable side effects. Recent studies
have also shown that the drug may be carcinogenic (causing
cancer) when used on laboratory animals. In other words, as a
cure it leaves a lot to be desired. However, there are no other
known prescribed cures, and the only herbal cure I have heard of is
to use creosote as a douche. The Tribal Medicine Council
recommends creosote as an effective cure. (Another cute thing
about Flagyl is that it can kill off the normal bacteria of the vagina
too, and lead to a yeast infection.)

Non-Specific Vaginitis: This infection is caused by a certain
bacteria (not by yeast, trich, or gonorrhea) and is very tricky to
diagnose and get rid of. The bacteria causes trouble only when
something disrupts the natural chemical balance, like being sick
or run-down.

Symptoms: You will have an itchy inflamed vulva, and a white or
yellow discharge which contains cells and bacteria (under a
microscope) and may be streaked with blood. If the bacteria get
into your uterus, fallopian tubes, or bloodstream, you may feel
back pains and have cramps and swollen glands.

Treatment: Sulfa drugs are used in cream or suppository form
every morning and evening for ten days. Brand names are Vagitrol,
Sultrin, AVC cream. If you are allergic to sulfa drugs, get Furacin
Vag-15 suppositories or Betadine douche cream. All of these are
prescription drugs, and alas! I know of no herbal cures.
Hopefully, these descriptions will shed a little light on how
to deal with these damnable infections. Learning to effectively
diagnose does take time and practice, but basically it isn’t that
hard to do. If you have self-help classes that are being taught

where you live, go to them! You can learn a lot about yourself and
help break down the monopoly of power that the male-dominated
medical establishment has effectively kept us trapped with.
Self-determination!

Big Mama Rag Vol. 3 No. 3

Big Mama Benefit

Wine, Women, and Song
#1, Big Mama Rag’s first
benefit was held at the Oxford
Hotel Aug. 1. Attended by
over 200 people, we might
even go so far as to call the
benefit a smashing success.
Sue Isaacson and Judy
Sarchielli acted as moderators
for the benefit and also
entertained us with their skits
and general craziness! The
Raw Honey women’s band

which includes Judy Blair,
Chris Schmeltzer, Lorrie
Baun, Bean Hollander, and

Susan Nichols provided great
boogie music for everyone to
dance to (even in the streets)
and individual members of the
Motherfolkers heightened the
audience’s high energy for the
first part of the evening.
Casse Culver from Washing-
ton D.C. really helped to pull
the evening off with her
combination of voice, guitar,
harmonica and enthusiasm as
well as her politics. All the
members of Big Mama would
like to extend our special
thanks to all the women who
entertained and to all the
beautiful people who made
the evening so successful.
We’ll be having more such
events in the future and hope
to see you all there again!

An Evening With Eva

Shecat
Eva Freund was in town
Saturday night, August 10,

and no one took notes. For
one evening, this powerfully
dynamic Feminist shared her
energies with us, and the only
record is inscribed in our
consciousness.

The main thrust of what she
said concerned the dynamics
of Feminist group politics,
especially Lesbian interaction
with NOW and other organi-
zations. (Eva left the Gay
Activists Alliance to spend
more energies with women in
NOW on the National Lesbian
Task Force; she is no stranger
to struggle. The most com-
prehensive gay anti-discrimin-
ation bill in the country was
passed recently in Washing-
ton, D.C., under her leader-
ship.)

One of the most significant
ideas she shared was the
concept of power bases; she

emphasized the necessity of
forcing power downward
through the ranks of every
group to give equal leadership
among the members. One
reason this is necessary is
that there are too many things
to be accomplished in a
Feminist society to expect a
few to carry out the demands
of the many. Also, in order for
every woman to feel the joy of
accomplishment, every wo-
man must carry her share of
the responsibility. This also
helps eliminate the burnout
factor among the leadership.
Rotating the duties of coor-
dinator on a frequent basis
(every few months) helps
achieve this goal.

Another way sharing power
bases can be accomplished is
for a small group (such as
Lesbians) to be outrageous (in
a variety of creative ways) and
then use that to raise

consciousness. (Get the
group’s attention and then use
that power for positive
change.) No one is going to
validate Lesbians or straight
Feminists; we have to vali-
date ourselves, and we’d
better get busy.

Eva listened to our pro-
blems and our joys, shared
many valuable experiences of
Lesbian Feminist struggle,
and left us feeling positive
and strong. Eva Freund is
impossible to share with
others second-hand; she has
to be experienced.

Eva, if you read this, the
Colorado dykes you met love
you. We still have much to
share and much to give.
Please come back again.
