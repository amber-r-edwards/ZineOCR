ABORTION REFERRAL AND COUNSELING  
SERVICE OF COLORADO  

1400 Lafayette, Denver  

832-2293 24 hour phone line  

This referral service has been  
in existence for three years and  
operates from the belief that women  
should not be charged for their basic  
right to know.  

This abortion service is free and  
is working to eliminate their only  
charge of $5 for a pregnancy test.  
ARC is also exploring the possibilities  
of setting up a fund for women  
who cannot pay for their abortions.  
ARC is actively trying to change the  
situation where minors are refused  
abortions and where women have trouble  
getting their insurance companies  
to pay. ARC provides extensive  
support for women who call in need of  
abortion and is thoroughly knowledgeable  
on the abortion situation throughout  
Colorado.

a supportive group setting. They have  
sexuality counseling for heterosexual

although there are also some volunteers.

clinics, pregnancy testing, pre-natal  
clinic, VD clinic, general clinic and

DENVER HEALTH COLLECTIVE  
Becky 399-2886  
Romy 377-9754  

This group just started meeting this  
past spring. They first see themselves  
as a clearing house where information  
about health and the politics of health  
care can be shared. Eventually, they  
would like to rent a space and open up  
a women's clinic in Denver.  

This clinic would offer the usual  
range of services now being done at  
gynecological clinics, including pre-natal  
care, exams and treatment of infections, etc.  
They would also offer workshops on  
alternative methods of healing and self-help.  

The collective also intends to act  
as patient advocates for women who  
are utilizing existing health care  
institutions. They see themselves as  
applying pressure on the health system  
to meet women's needs.  
New members of the collective are  
welcome. Contact them at Woman to  
Woman 320-5972 or at 377-9754 (leave a  
message).

Woman to Woman is non-profit and tax

must agree with the points of unity

hours a week at the center. Also, they  
are required to come to two meetings  
a month - the first and last Sunday of  
the month at 7 P.M. Anyone can come

The library carries most of the  
books available in the store. Use of  
the library is free. Books can be  
taken out for three weeks at a time.  

There are no fines, but the point of the  
library is to keep the books circulating.

all subjects from auto repair to  
CR groups, lesbian literature, political  
study groups and socialism-feminism.  
They sponsor workshops on day care  
(setting up a care racism and

LILITH: WOMYN'S BOOKSTORE  
1743 Walnut St., Boulder

and children only, coffee and tea

every two weeks there is a new womyn's  
art show. There are full and new  
moon potlucks to give womyn a “sense  
of solidarity."  

Lilith sets up workshops, CR groups  
and classes. They will find traveling  
womyn a place to stay (usually at  
Lilith). In the fall, they hope to  
set up a library, and they are now  
setting up a work exchange for womyn  
who need jobs.  

There is a 20% discount for womyn  
who are on welfare. All the workshops  
are free, although the classes in the  
fall may have a sliding scale fee.  

Lilith is open Tuesday-Saturday  
10-6 and 10-8 on Thursday. On Sunday  
it is open when there are special  
events. Staff say “Please call anytime  
if you are in an emergency (which  
could be just feeling lonely)."  

When asked about their politics in  
our questionnaire, Emily wrote,  

“We only serve womyn. We started as  
radical dyke separatists and are becom-  
ing more separatist all the time.  

Our short-term goal is to get rid of  
all the men in the Denver/Boulder  
area and create a womyn's utopia which  
will swiftly spread over the entire  
universe. Our long-term goal is to  
convince all womyn of the political/  
emotional importance/joyousness of  
being lesbians.  

There is a two womyn collective  
(Emily and Cindy) who live at the  
center and make all the decisions.  
Emily is financially responsible  
for a mortgage on the building  
they are buying. Now there is a group  
of committed store staffers and there  
will be monthly meetings for womyn  
interested in staffing at the store.  

(Ed. note: We used womyn instead of  
women in this description because it  
is what Lilith notes about themselves.)

from a radical perspective on women's  
movement issues, equal rights, etc. RIP is

perspective and that the right approach
