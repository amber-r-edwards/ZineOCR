‘I am a black woman, born and
brought up in a rural area of
South Africa. Most men from
this area work many miles from
their homes in one of South

clean pungent aroma: of the
red ochre which the tribal
woman used to dress their
hair.

Although it was only 10 am
in the morning we had already
seen and treated about 30 pa-
tients. In the summer patients
arrived from 7 am onwards,
and surgery started at about
7:30 in the morning. The

clinic in South Africa

Africa's industrial centres.
The following story is very
much part of my own experience.

I trained as a nurse in the
Transkei and worked there for
three and a half years. I then
worked for a short time on the
Ciskei before training as a
midwife and working in this
field in Zululand for just
over a year. I spent a further
two years at a mission clinic
on the edge of a large African
Reserve in Mid-Natal running
a maternity clinic. I was also
a member of a mobile clinic
unit which served the arid
Reserve area, from which the
vast majority of the men were
away working in the mines
around Johannesburg. Finally,
I spent two years in a small
town Provincial Hospital in
North Natal working mainly in
the children's ward.

Thus I had in South Africa
experience of different geo-
graphical areas of the coun-
try, and also different envi-
ronments. I worked in rural
areas, in tribal reserves,
and in town. I had lived in
the countryside, where my
home is situated, in small
town ‘locations’ and in large
African townships.

‘Bring in the next patient
please!'

I moved away taking the
mother whose baby had just
been examined, explaining to
her the importance of giving
all the antibiotic to the
child even if he showed signs
of improvement before the
bottle of medicine was fin-
ished. As the mother left the
surgery, I poked my head into
the waiting room. There was
only one patient left, but
the waiting room still held a
familiar smell, a combination
of smoke from the open aloe
fires used for cooking in the
kraals which impregnated the
clothing of the local resi-
dents, together with the

surgery was part of a small
maternity clinic which admit-
ted, when full, 25 patients.
It was situated at the lower
end of the clinic area, the
dirt road used by traffic from
and to the village about a
quarter of a mile away.

"Woza ma' (come in mother)
I said in our language to the
woman who sat with her hands
under a blanket. It was a hot
sticky morning, especially in
the surgery where we kept
most of the windows closed in
order to keep out the dust
from the dirt road. I puzzled
as to how she could feel cold
to the extent of using such a
large blanket instead of the
usual small one used by the
women in the area. I conclud-
ed that she must have had a
nasty cold from which she was
recovering. Although the cli-
nic itself was specifically
for maternity patients, in

the surgery we were inevitably
consulted about everything.
With the next hospital four
hours' walk away, it had to
be so.

The woman stood up clumsily
still keeping her arms under
the blanket. Her face looked
drawn, tired and anxious, as
she sat on the chair facing
the doctor.

‘Uphethwe uini, Ma?' (What
is the matter, Ma?) I asked.

No, it is not I who am un-
well. It is the baby.' As she
spoke she removed the blanket
revealing an extremely de-
hydrated baby of about nine
months old. He was lying
limply in his mother's arms.
His eyes were closed and the
eyeballs sunken in his skull.
The breathing was shallow and
irregular. His skin too was
dry and hung loosely on his
dehydrated body.

The doctor started to ex-
amine the baby. Eventually
he looked up, his face red
and angry:

‘Staff nurse, ask her why

she kept the baby at home
for such a long time. Why
didn't she come earlier with
him?"

I hesitated, looking at
the mother who was trying to
force the breast between the
baby's opened lips. The doc-
tor was new to this field of
medicine having just joined
the clinic a month ago. Pre-
viously he had worked in an
all-white provincial hospi-
tal. Until his appointment
at the clinic he had had no
contact with Black people
and he knew very little of
the problems they faced in
their daily lives.

I knew the answer to his
question without even asking
the mother but I still went
through the pointless exer-
cise of asking the question
just so the doctor did not
think that I had made up an
answer. Her reply was as I
had expected:

‘The baby had not been ill
for a long time. He only
started yesterday. By even-
ing time he had vomited so
much and had had so many
loose stools that he had be-
come very weak and was re-
fusing the breast. If it
were possible I would have
come yesterday evening but
there is no transport from
our place at that time of
the day. Tell the doctor I
couldn't have come earlier
than today.'

As I translated the infor-
mation, the doctor shook
his head incredulously. He

did not believe what the
mother was saying. As I
finished he said:

‘Tell her that her baby
is very ill. He needs a lot
of water to replace the
fluid he has lost through
vomiting and diarrhoea. We
cannot give the water
through the mouth because
the baby is too ill to take
it, but even if he did
drink it at this stage he
would just vomit the whole
lot out again. The baby
must go to hospital. The
doctor there will put a
drip in the baby's vein and
replace the water directly
to the body whilst the
child is being given the
antibiotic to kill the in-
fection.

The woman listened with
no change in her expression.
When I finished she said
quietly:

‘I understand what the
doctor is saying. But I
can't take the baby to hos-
pital without letting them
know at home. I must go
home now and I will come
back with the baby tomorrow
perhaps.

The doctor was already
writing the letter of intro-
duction to the hospital. He
stopped writing when I told
him what the mother was
saying.

‘Tell her there is no
time for her to take the
baby home. If treatment is
not started immediately the
baby will die. There is a
chance to save her baby,
but only if she agrees to

international

taking him to hospital now.'

As I spoke to the woman
tears just rolled down her
face and she clutched her baby
to her breast.

"I don't want my baby to die.

Please God don't let him die.

I have waited so many years to
have him: Don't let him die."

The doctor's voice cut in an-
xiously:

‘What does she say?"

'She doesn't want her baby
to die.'

‘Of course she doesn't want
her baby to die. Neither do
we. That is why we want the
baby to go to hospital. That
is the only chance we have of
saving her baby.'

I just stood there saying
nothing. My mind was on pre-
vious occasions when we had
successfully persuaded women
to take their children to hos-
pital and they had died. How
could I tell this woman to do
the same? The doctor's voice
came through:

‘Aren't you going to tell
her what I have just said?" he demanded.

‘Why the hell not? You are
a trained nurse. Surely you
must know that the hospital
is the only place where this
baby has a chance of surviv-
ing.'

The doctor was a German
missionary and had done his
training in his own country.
During the month he had been
in the clinic he had shown
genuine care, and his treat-
ment of patients was humane,
unlike that meted out by many
South African white doctors.
It was precisely this back-
ground which encouraged me now
to speak quite openly to him.

‘If I knew that I would have
no hesitation in encouraging
her to take her baby to the
hospital and I am sure that
if we could guarantee that the
baby would be well in hospital
the mother would go now. But
we cannot be sure that the
baby will be cured in the hos-
pital."

The doctor was getting more
angry as he listened.

"Of course we cannot guaran-
tee that. It is her fault for
not bringing the baby here
earlier in the first place.
We are now offering her a
chance to save her child.'

‘It is not her fault and
what we are offering her is
not a chance of survival but
a graveyard.'

I was getting very angry
and my voice must have com-
municated my feelings to the
doctor. Looking at his con-
fused face I realised that he
had no conception of the prob-
lems facing the woman he want-
ed to help. I turned towards
him feeling slightly ashamed
for losing my temper. After
all he was ignorant about the
problem he thought he could
solve.

'I am sorry. I know I am
not making any sense but per-
haps I could explain if you
could spare a few minutes."
Turning to the mother who was
getting ready to take her baby
home I explained:

‘Can you please wait for a
few minutes. The doctor and
I are just discussing if there
is any other way to make the
baby better.'

Addressing the doctor I con-
tinued, 'The situation facing
you at the moment is only
part of the whole problem of
my people in this country.'

‘At the moment I do not
give a damn about the prob-
lem of your people. My con-
cern now is the life of this
baby in front of me. You ex-
plain to me why the baby
should not be given a chance
in hospital and I am willing
to listen.'

‘I do believe that you are
genuinely concerned about the
baby. But the fate of this
baby is the fate of a thou-
sand more children which you
are going to see in this clin-
ic, and the dilemma facing the
mother is the dilemma of all
the women you will be trying
to persuade to take their
children to hospital. Unless
you understand at least part
of the problem you will neith-
er be able to help this baby
nor many more who will be in
his position."

‘Well I have read a lot
about the system of separate
development and the Bantustans
but I still don't understand
what that whole problem has
to do with taking this baby
into hospital."

‘It has a lot to do with it.
Under the system of apartheid
women and children must re-
main behind in the poor and
arid reserve whilst husbands
spend months 300 miles away in
the mines in Johannesburg as
migrant workers. Although
women spend a lot of their
time planting in the fields
they get very little return in
food because the soil is very
poor. The money that husbands
send home is negligible be-
cause they themselves get very
low wages. The result is con-
sistent unremitting starvation:
The most vulnerable are child-
ren. Because they are already
weak from malnutrition any
disease they get hits them
very hard. A child who was
taken ill only yesterday looks
as if he has been ill for
months."

‘But why doesn't the mother
bring the child in as soon as
he gets ill -- on the same
day?' asked the doctor in some
exasperation.

"Most of the people who
come to the clinic are from
the top of that mountain,’ I
pointed out. 'The only bus
serving the area leaves at 7
am to arrive here at 10 am.
People who live across the
Tugela river must leave their
homes at 5 am in the morning
in order to catch the bus
before it leaves the terminus.
If the baby gets ill at 8 am
after the bus has left the
mother has to wait until the
following day to come here.'

‘Yes, I see the problem,‘
the doctor said musingly. ‘But
now she is here, why won't she
let the baby go to hospital?"

"Because in our custom, the
decision to take the child to
hospital is a family decision
which must be approved of by

Big

“S.A./L.N.S.

the father of the child. In
his absence his parents or
brother must be consulted. But
a lot of mothers would be pre-
pared to ignore this restric-
tion if they were sure that
their babies would get bet-
ter in hospital. There would
be less recriminations about
taking unilateral decisions
provided the baby got better."

’But there is a chance in
the hospital,’ the doctor
insisted.

‘It is not a chance that is
worth taking, I have worked
in that hospital. There is
only one children's ward in
which babies from one month
old are admitted with child-
ren of 14 years of age. Child-
ren with infectious diseases
cannot be effectively isola-
ted. The number of children
in the ward rarely falls be-
low 50; Babies share cots and
bigger children share beds
with little ones. There are
only four nurses to look after
all the children and, at
night, sometimes only two.
This baby will have no chance
at all. With the risk of
cross infection he is bound
to die of some other disease
even if they checked his gas-
tro-enteritis. Should the
baby die then the mother has
to face the problem of tak-
ing the body home possibly
