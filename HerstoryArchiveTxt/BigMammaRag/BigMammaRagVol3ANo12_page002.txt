One Woman's Story

IRS Taxes Woman’s Past Marital Status

Cristine Soliz

A recent show on ABC's 60
Minutes evoked the feeling that
the tyranny of the taxman was
pervasive in American society
and could be a truly harrowing
experience for some who are
confronted with it. Jon Hinz,
Public Affairs Officer for the
Internal Revenue Service in
Denver, believes the IRS gen-
erally makes an effort not to
abuse their power or violate any-
one’s rights; however, one local
citizen's recent experience with
them has her convinced to the
contrary.

One Friday afternoon, when
Kathleen Olson walked into
Joyce’s Submarine Sandwich
Shop, one of her two part-time
jobs, she unwittingly stepped
into the powerful clutches of the
IRS tax collector. She dis-
covered that without prior noti-
fication to her, the IRS had placed
a levy on her wages for back
taxes owed by her former hus-
band in Colorado Springs. Olson
said Don Dods, her employer,
told her he had explained to the
IRS that Olson was now di-
vorced and was legally separ-
ated in the year for which the
taxes were owed. The IRS then
asked Dods not to send Olson’s
wages directly to IRS offices but
to hold them back until they had
had time to check further into
the matter.

In 1974, Olson was legally sep-
arated from her husband. Her
estranged husband, self-
employed, apparently was in a
bind for deductions and had a
large sum due in taxes for 1974.
He asked her to file a joint tax
return in an effort to reduce his
taxes by claiming the real estate
tax deductions and interest on
her house. Olson, hoping to keep
her support checks out of jeopar-
dy, filed the joint return with her
husband, then forgot about it
until three weeks ago.

Forced Loan

Olson immediately phoned
the IRS to confirm what Dods
had told them. She kept the
appointment she made to see
Larry McGowan, Tax Collector,
who insisted she come the
following Monday at 2:30. But
all she found were two men
mopping floors — it was a holi-
day for government workers.
She called again the next day
and made another appoint-
ment. Olson said the IRS led her
to believe over the phone that

Censorship Charged

after they saw her financial
statement they would make
“restitution.” “But when I got
down there,” she said, “they hit
me with a levy and seizure.”
McGowan told Olson her ex-
husband's financial statement
showed he was incapable of
paying the $700 owed for 1974.
Olson said they wouldn't show
her his statement, but she was
able to see a portion of it which
revealed a monthly income of
$800. Olson and her two child-
ren, ages 10 and 6, are living on
her $360 monthly earnings from
two part-time jobs plus $160
child support. Hinz said he could
not speak directly about the
Olson case, but her assets of
house and car would have been
enough collateral to take out a
loan from any bank or loan com-
pany. He said if tax delinquents
have the ability to take out a loan, the
IRS requires that a Payment
Agreement be signed.

Wage Levy
and House Seizure

McGowan asked Olson to sign
a Payment Agreement. It stated
that she had been granted an ex-
tension of time for delinquent
taxes, and that if full payment
was not made within two days,
the IRS would, without further
notice, effect a wage levy and
house seizure. When Olson re-
fused to sign the Agreement,
McGowan reportedly threat-
ened they would seize her house
the following day and said the
results of such an act would
seriously damage her credit
rating. Olson argued that al-
though she signed the joint re-
turn, still, they were not her
taxes. Further, she said she
hadn't been notified, was un-
aware of her rights, and hadn't
had the opportunity to compre-
hend what was happening.
Olson said McGowan insisted it
was her husband's responsibil-
ity to inform her that these taxes
were owed. “Apparently,” Olson
says, “they gave him (Mr. Olson)
a full year of notices which I
didn’t even know anything
about.” She said McGowan told
her they had not notified her be-
cause they didn’t have her
address, although she has lived
at the same address for 12 years.
(A note attached to the Seizure
papers which Olson perused
said they had had her address
after all.) Hinz says the IRS ful-
fills their legal responsibility by
giving at least 90 days notice to
one of the parties on the joint re-
turn.

When Olson continued to
refuse to sign, McGowan then
reportedly said, “I know it’s a bad
deal, but either you sign today or
we'll be out tomorrow.”

Olson signed hoping to bor-
row the money somewhere, or
get her ex-husband to pay. Even-
tually her husband paid within
the allotted two days.

A local attorney, Richard C.
Lonnquist, stated he was not
familiar enough with the tax
laws to say whether her rights
had been violated but that he
“would never advise a client to
sign something that was a lie."
The Agreement Olson signed
reads “I the undersigned,
having been granted an exten-
sion of time for delinquent
taxes...” Hinz reiterated that
although he could not comment
specifically about the case, he
would have to say Olson's case
was unusual and that perhaps
she was a victim of circum-
stances. The IRS, he concluded,
however, acted within their legal
bounds.

Further Victimization

Olson feels her victimization
didn’t end there. After the taxes
were paid and Olson got a re-
lease for her wages, the IRS
apparently called Dods and in-
formed him he had violated the
law by not sending Olson’s
wages directly to the IRS offices,
apparently forgetting they had
asked him to hold the checks
until they were certain about
Olson's status. Olson was en-
raged they would continue to
hassle her employer so she
again went downtown in an
effort to have it stopped. Olson
said McGowan immediately
apologized and said someone
hadn't pulled the papers. She
said he then told her if she ever
needed her taxes done to just
call him or stop down for lunch.

Olson said she feels there are
still a lot of women who are into
taking care of their ex-hus-
bands, “but you find out it
doesn’t help them or you.” Hinz
said, “in divorce decrees the tax
situation should be resolved” to
avoid things like this happen-
ing. Olson said she could be
wrong, but she got the feeling
they wouldn't have hassled her
so badly if she had been a man.
She felt they had been more

Liberal/Radical Splits L.A. Lesbians

Woodwoman

The Lesbian Activists is a Los
Angeles group whose members
define their politics as “Liberal
Feminist.” The group describes
itself as dedicated to filling ‘the
void between the revolutionary-
minded Radical Feminists and
the conservative National
Organization for Women.”

In July this year, S/ster and the
Lesbian Tide (two nationally
circulated feminist newspapers
based in Los Angeles) both
refused to accept further
announcements and advertise-
ments from the group.

Strike

This decision arose out of a
strike at the local Gay Communi-
ty Services Center, a male-
dominated institution whose
hierarchical Board of Directors
fired 15 radical workers in May.
The workers (most of whom
were lesbians) were fired after
disputes over staff structure,
handling of funds, and efforts to
unionize. The fired workers and
sympathizers instituted a picket
outside the GCSC and called on
the gay community to boycott
the Center and support the
strike.

Although Lesbian Activists
professed neutrality on the
strike issue, members of the
group have actively supported
the GCSC bosses. An Activists
coordinator actually joined the
Board of Directors and
deliberately crossed the picket
line “to show solidarity with
GCSC.” Other members of the
group have also crossed the
picket line.

Sister's staff maintain that
they will continue to publish
letters expressing any opinion,
but stressed that they could not
“endorse recruitment (as ads
and announcements do) for
organizations which we feel are
actively trying to undermine the
politics and well-being of the
feminist community.” The Tide
took a similar stand.

In August, the Los Angeles
Women’s Center endorsed the
newspapers’ action by barring
“women who knowingly cross
the picket line (scabs) from
organizing, leading, or teaching
activities at the Center. (Both
Sister and the Tide are members
of the Women’s Center.)

This was not the first time that
Women's Center staff and
members had locked horns with
Lesbian Activists...

Censorship

In March, when television
entertainer Mort Sahl advocated
death for gay people, the gay
community was unified in its
outrage. Lesbian Activists’ ap-
proach was to write Sahl a letter,
in which they assured him that
they would not support any form
of censorship.

“We support your right to
open any and every show with
your declaration of hatred
toward women and gay per-
sons,” the letter said, and went
on to appeal for greater sensitivi-
ty in his future choice of
remarks. At that time, Women's
Center staff explained to the
Lesbian Activists why they felt
such an attitude was
“dangerous.”

Lesbian Activists now accuse
Sister and the Lesbian Tide of
violating their right to free
speech by censoring their
material. And the Women's
Center, they say, is dis-
criminating against women
whose views are deemed by
members and staff to be
“politically incorrect.” Sister, the Tide, and the
Women's Center feel that the
issues involved go far deeper
than that.
