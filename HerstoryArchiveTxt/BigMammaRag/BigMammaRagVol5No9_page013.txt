DAY UPON DAY a

Juliet Whitman, -  
production coordinator  
Performed Nov 2, 1977 at  
Colorado Women's College  

Bobbie  

The players, all prisoners at the  
Colorado Women's Correctional Insti-  
tute in Canon City, call themselves  
the “Pent-Up Players.” Juliet  
Whitman, the woman who sparked the  
project, and holds the production  
together, conducts weekly workshops  
at the Institute. The production of  
the play stemmed from those work-  
shops. The original play by Ms.  
Shephard was given to the women in  
prison who then took the idea and  
contributed about 90% of their own  
inventiveness to the production.  

Ten women participate onstage with  
one woman also functioning as assis-  
tant technician offstage.  

The first showing was in Boulder,  
considered by the coordinator and  
the actresses as a dress rehearsal,  
followed by a panel comprised of  
actress/prisoners, prison adminis-  
trators and humanists, as outlined  
in the grant that Ms. Whitman has  
received from the Colorado Fine Arts  
Commission. The second showing was  
in Denver, followed by the same com-  
position of people. This performance  
was their third.  

The play begins with Leanne Werner  
playing a new woman to the prison,  
just out of isolation. She speaks  
of the feelings of desolation in the  

courtroom when sentenced by a judge  
who didn't see her as a person,  
“...and he said '7 years' the way I  
would say ‘good day'.” She was numb  
the whole time in the courtroom  
and didn't comprehend what was hap-  
pening to her. Only afterwards did  
the impact of her sentence hit her.  
She hesitantly comes into the Day  

Room where other women are sitting.  
Stelia, played by Stella Young, is  
knitting. With her are Maria Casto,  
Bobbi LeBlanc, Haggar (Sharron Watson)  
and Sandra (Sandra Steele Mosley).  
Among talk of children and current  
happenings Leanne is introduced to  
the prison routine. She voices her  
fears of not getting to see her child  
and lesbianism.  

The women react by laughing and  
teasing about lesbianism, and their  
tone and words convey the message  
that lesbianism abounds in the pri-  
son.  

Outsiders appear, making a tour of  
the joint (Sharron Reynolds, Joni  
Anderson, Gail Noyes and Lois Cooper,  
Capt. Correction Super at CWCI)  
making stupid observations about the  
ease of prison life because they see  
a color TV. The women react with  
humored hostility. After they leave  
(a hurried exit), Haggar prepares to  
meet with the Parole Board, afraid  
to be hopeful that her parole will  
be granted. Sandra encourages her  
to be hopeful, pointing out that she  
has been “good” and hasn't been  
“written up.” While Haggar is dres-  
sing, Sandra and a guard, played by  
Evelyn Stewart, argue about Sandra  
being in the Day Room and not at  
work. Sandra, who has received per-  
mission to take the day off, mouths  
off at the guard and dares her to  
write her up. The guard, in a huff,  
backs down and goes out leaving  
Sandra alone to listen to a tape made  
by her husband. Alone on the stage  
with only the tape going, his voice  
tells her that he is hopeful that his  
love will help her survive and once  
out they can continue a life together,  
that he will be everything for her  
and fill her spoken and unspoken  
needs.  

The Parole Board as represented by  
Joe Minjarez and Bill McGregor, I  
think shows most clearly the U.S.  
criminal justice system's mentality.  
The men rake Haggar over the coals  
for her past activities and friends.  
Their sexist, paternal attitude  
changes her attitude. She goes to  
the Board with hesitancy but with a  

willingness to cooperate. They, by  
their prying and paternalism, make  
her defiant. They ask her about her  
“lesbian activity” and her writing to  
a male prisoner who is described as  
a troublemaker. They want to know  
if she is going to continue lesbian  
relationships once she gets out; they  
want her to stop writing to the man.  
She can't erase her past; she doesn't  
know if lesbianism is going to be in  
her future; and she's got to stop  
writing to the man as he is her man.  
They mention that in her folder there  
is a comment from someone inside the  
joint that she has a tendency to  
become violent; when she wants to know  
who made the comment, they hurriedly  
grab the folder and react with fear.  

They dismiss her briefly, have a  
fast whispered conversation and call  
her back, telling her “...that after  
consideration (they) have put her  
back for six months, at which time  
(they) will again review her case.”  
She is dejected and angry, and when  
she enters the Day Room, throws over  
a card table and tells Sandra of her  
setback. Sandra takes her in her  
arms to comfort her.  

Lesbianism in the play is treated  
as an alternative to heterosexuality,  
because there are no men around. In  
the panel discussion held afterwards,  
women said that if lovers are not too  
blatant about their activities the  
guards won't write them up. Every-  
one knows it exists, but it is best  
to be discreet. When, in the play,  
the women talked of "sister love"  
the women in the audience cheered.

Adrienne Rich Shares An Evening With Denver Women  

Sandia  

I spend the day waiting for her at  
my typewriter. Some of the words are  
directed at her, some to me. I know  
she might change my life again. Most-  
ly, I know I want to be sister to  
Adrienne Rich.  

At the church, I am struck by all  
the ironies that resonate here. This  
symbol of patriarchy that contrasts  
to the vital women who gather for the  
workshop and reading. The looming  
organ and high-backed chairs, behind  
Adrienne. She is short. We are all  
still reminded of our fragility in  
the phallic-centered universe.  

Wood introduces her--the South Af-  
rican accent partially blots out the  

tenor of the church. For the first  
few minutes Adrienne talks about Of  
Woman Born, her recent book describ-  
ing motherhood both as experience and  
institution, highlighting the salient  
points:  

--through motherhood, the full op-  
pression of women is perpetuated,  
--that women need to understand that  
what is usually a private burden can  
be seen in a larger context,  

---the mother/child relationship as  
the common denominator of all human  
experience is minimized and denigrat-  
ed by the “culture namers; the hero  
or father/son relationship is the  
subject of literature, the enviable  
myth, but where in the language are  
the words, the tales of the mother/  
daughter,  

---the only words are those that can  
be turned against women (we are de-  
scribed as non-mothers and the child-  
less woman is a non-entity or a dan-  
gerous deviant).  

Rich uses the phrase "powerless  
responsibility" to describe our fate  
as seen from the male perspective,  
from the male dispensation of abor-  
tion, of birth control pills, of male  
usurpation and seizure of the birth  
process itself from the hands of wo-  
men. Instead of accepting the insti-  
tution of motherhood as if it were a  
law of nature, we must begin sorting  
out what we actually feel, about our  
own mothers, about our relationship  
to our powers of production, to our  

Woman-hating & The Cinema Reunited In ‘Goodbar’  

gingerlox  

I do not consider myself a movie  
critic or reviewer, in the accepted  
sense. I am an avid movie-goer, ever  
on the watch for those few precious  
films that may reflect the beauty,  
strength, and potential of women.  
However, I feel compelled to write  
about Looking for Mr. Goodbar, starring  
Diane Keaton and directed by Richard  
Brooks.  

This film, given media hype along  
with Julia and The Turning Point,  
is supposed to be part of the beginning  
of a new attitude in film making to-  
wards women. The idea seems to be  
that meatier roles, despite the plots,  
will ensure this direction. There is  
also the hope that watered-down femin-  
ist themes and platonicized (not to be  
confused with circumcised) woman-to-  
woman relationships filmed in gauzy  
pastel tones will add to the new genre  
of “women's films.”  

Goodbar falls short of even this  
compromised mark. Basically, it is  
about a schizophrenic woman, Terry  
Dunn, who is a dedicated teacher of the  
deaf and blind during the day and a  
sex-obsessed singles bar cruiser at  
night. The basis of this plot is  
either too much of a long-shot to be-  
lieve or too true for anyone to want  
to believe. The 2½ hour film features  
a heavy dose of loveless heterosexual  
screwing, the disintegration of Terry's  

Irish Catholic family (featuring the  
all-new, imaginative concept of the  
father as Roaring Patriarch), and the  
sensational ending scene thrill seekers  
are flocking to see: Terry Dunn stab-  
bed to death while she is being vio-  
lently fucked.  

There is no question that Diane  
Keaton proves herself an excellent and  
versatile actress in this film. Her  
character runs the full gamut of emo-  
tions, evoking an uncanny and possibly  
unplanned audience sympathy for her  
pitiful vulnerability. Fondly, I re-  
member her as Annie Hall, showing a  
much more likable vulnerability and  
shyness. From that film and other  
Woody Allen ventures, I would welcome  
her as a kooky sister. From Goodbar,  
she is unsavable, and certainly not as  
her character says, "...my own girl  
with my own set of rules." From start  
to finish in this film, she is not only  
a lost woman, but a soulless one, con-  
fused and warped by a hopeless reality  
with no escape options.  

While some reviews of Julia spend  
a good deal of space assuring audiences  
that Redgrave and Fonda do not kiss,  
reviews of Goodbar have opted for de-  
tailing the artistic courage of the  
film. It fails to be mentioned that  
this is a cinematic thesis on hate: a  
woman's self-hate, men's hate for women,  
family's hate for independent female  
children, and societal hate (for every-  
one). We are given a voyeuristic view  

of one woman's heterosexual state: her  
only means of human validation is in  
the act of being fucked.  

This movie is objectionable, artis-  
tically because it is cliched, but more  
importantly, because there is no redeem-  
ing social value for anyone either in  
the intense concentration on hate or in  
the climactic ending. We are served up  
a heterosexual moral as if it were a  
pie in the face: a gay male masturbates  
himself to erection and then brutalizes  
Keaton as Dunn as the symbol of all his  
sexual torment. The adaptation to  
screenplay of Judith Rossner's book  
gives us a vehicle for the worst dis-  
play of homophobia and misogyny yet to  
hit the silver screen.  

It is possible that this film could  
serve as a potent warning to women with  
a similar focus to Terry Dunn's. For  
women with consciousness, such a  
graphic warning is unnecessary: we know  
it in our guts. But, I suspect the  
warning will be ignored by the very  
women it might benefit, in the typical  
“it couldn't happen to me" attitude.  

Looking for Mr. Goodbar is a film  
Anita Bryant would surely condone: no  
oral sex is featured (just a little  
ass-kissing), and a man who appears  
bisexual but whom audiences will inter-  
pret as a male homosexual, reveals the  
"true evil" of all homosexuals, by kill-  
ing Terry Dunn.  

I give this flick an "A" rating:  
Avoid at all cost.  

Then she turns the program over to  
us. With reticence, the mothers be-  
gin to speak. No one has asked them  
before. No one has taken them seri-  
ously. Single mothers. Married  
mothers. Lesbian mothers. Indepen-  
dent women. Seeking new models, ways  
to break the Freudian harnesses. Ex-  
changing insights, enough anger to  
change the world. Anger at our  
mothers, desire for our mothers, want-  
ing the ultimate healing conversation  
with them. In the background, Rich's  
tragic paradigm of the Chinese mother  
who binds her daughter's feet, know-  
ing that she condemns her to a life  
of pain so she can be marriageable,  
so she can survive.  

After dinner she reads again from  
different sections of Of Woman Born.  
The connection is there between our  
feelings, our poetry, our politics.  
No separations, only the yearning  
all of us feel who have come to sup-  
port the Rachele Yaseen Defense Fund  
sponsoring her. All the mothers. All
