Feminist Movement

By Andrea Gabriel

Women in Spain who have been
active in working class political
parties are leaving these parties
en masse to work in the independent
women's movement. One of the organ-
izations that has emerged from this
process is a Feminist Party which
was formed in the spring of 1979
and has bases primarily in Barcelona
and Madrid.

It is only since the death of
Franco five years ago that either
working class or feminist organiza-

tions have been able to operate legally

in Spain. Most working class organ-
izations are participating in parlia-
mentary elections. Those which have
gained the most votes are not militant
organs of class struggle, nor have
they given leadership to struggles
for women's rights, gay rights, or
the anti-nuclear movement. All work-
ing class organizations are supporting
these struggles at present, however,
and their leaders were conspicuously
present in International Women's Day
and Gay Pride Day demonstrations,
both of which drew tens of thousands
into the streets.

The new Feminist Party intends
to participate in parliamentary
elections and to utilize "all
available legal means" to raise
the consciousness of women around
feminist issues and to give a fem-
inist alternative to every social
and economic problem the country
faces. The Party's goal is to push
beyond the proletarian revolution
to feminist revolution, which would
mean gaining at least 51% of revo-
lutionary state power and present-
ing radical alternatives to the
traditional family structure, which
they see as the source of our
oppression as women historically.

In Spain women have been system-
atically barred from entering the
paid workforce ever since fascist
rule began in 1938. Their present
participation in the paid workforce
is 12%, perhaps the lowest in the
world. Women have had little

representation in working class
organizations, but left feminists
have not chosen to join the Wages
for Housework movement which origin-
ated in Italy. They feel the demand
of wages for housework is reformist
and counter-revolutionary in that it
re-enforces the ideology of women's
traditional role in the family.

Women's bookstores have existed for
only a little over a year in Spain's
two major cities. In Barcelona, a

women's press exists which publishes
books in both Catalan and Spanish.

The feminist movement in the Basque,
where a national liberation struggle
is underway opposing Spanish domina-
tion seems to be more closely linked

with this struggle than it is with
women in Spain.

A Feminist Manifesto

The following are excerpts from the
introduction to Partido Feminista:
Tesis, published in Barcelona, Spain,
May, 1979. A few editorial changes
have been made for clarity in present-
ing an abbreviated introduction to
the book for English-speaking readers.

Whether or not the women who wrote
Partido Feminista: Tesis succeeded
at the present time in uniting
Spanish women around the struggle for
feminist revolution, it seems to me

they have clarified for all of us our
place in history and our historical
responsibility as women.

Partido Feminista Tesis

That the most progressive women
have assumed a proletarian ideology
and struggles, together with men, for
the victory of socialism, doesn't
mean that they have attained class
consciousness as women. Marx and Eng-
els wrote of the birth of the prole-
tarian movement: "While a social class
still lacks force and consciousness
to elaborate its own ideology, it
assumes the ideology of the revolu-

tionary class which precedes it, that
which is rising to power. If anywhere
(the proletariat) unite to form com-
pact bodies, this is not yet the

consequence of their own active union,

but of the union of the bourgeoisie,
which class in order to attain its

own political ends, is compelled to
set the whole proletariat in motion,
and is moreover yet, for a time, able
to do so. At this stage, therefore,
the proletarians do not fight their
enemies, but the enemies of their
enemies, the remnants of absolute mon-
archy, the landowners, the non-indus-
trial bourgeois, the petty bourgeoi-
sie. Thus the whole historical move-
ment is concentrated in the hands of
the bourgeoisie; every victory so
obtained is a victory for the bourgeoi
sie." (Communist Manifesto)

Decades later the class struggle
repeats itself, with almost the same
conditions. While the proletariat is
a rising class, it brings women into
its struggle. And each victory gained
for the proletariat is not directed
against the enemies of women as women,
but against the enemies of the prole-
tariat as a whole: against the indus-
trial and financial bourgeoisie,
against oligarchies of all kinds,
against imperialism, centralism and
colonialism, against speculators and
landlords. In this stage the male
proletariat can mobilize women for
their own benefit, and convince them
that the struggle for socialism is
their own struggle. Once that victory

is attained and a proletarian revolu-

tion occurs, women remain in a second-
ary place in the society and continue

to be exploited by men in reproduction,
sexual life and domestic work.

Today our struggle has transformed
itself. The moment has arrived to
abandon our pleas, petitions and re-
forms by isolated groups of women or
by mass organizations whose only
object is to attain slight improve-
ments in our lot; our object today is
nothing short of feminist revolution.

We are no longer a sex, a gender,
wives, lovers, mothers nor "human
beings equal to men". We are a class
in struggles -- with all the suffer-
ing that such enlightenment brings.
Working men can no longer mobilize us
only to benefit themselves. And for
this reason they are beginning to
suffer the same contradictions that
the bourgeoisie suffered before them:
"Before having conquered their feudal
adversaries totally and eliminating
their influence, they had to contend
with a new adversary that began to
threaten their domination and to
transform bourgeois society -- the
proletariat; for this reason they
became conservative toward the prole-
tariat even before having completed
their revolutionary tasks." (Marx)

Are we not living today in the same
situation? Before the proletariat in
many countries has been able to com-
plete its revolutionary tasks, very
early in the struggle, in fact, in

Peruvian Women Build Teachers’ Strike

By Andrea Gabriel

More than 140,000 Peruvian teach-
ers, most of whom are women, have
been on strike since the beginning of
the “winter” school term (June 4th).
Support for the strike has grown
steadily, in spite of the govern-

ment's refusal to recognize the
teachers' union, which is led by
revolutionary Marxists.

The government has attempted to
settle the strike by negotiating with
the bogus union it set up, but this
has only discredited the "official"
union more than ever in the eyes of
teachers and by now nearly 100% of
the nation's teachers have joined
the strike under revolutionary lead-
ership. They are pointing out that
teachers with a bachelor's degree
and ten years of service receive less
pay than men who first enter the
country's military or police services.
Government propaganda says that mili-
tary spending is an “investment in
the country's future", while teachers
are "turning their backs on the
nation's children" by striking for
better pay and working conditions.

Teachers have been under severe
repression for years - hundreds have
been killed, thousands jailed - and
the union's president was assassin-
ated last February during a govern-
ment raid on the union headquarters.
Parent organizations all over the
country have come out in support of
the current strike and have organized
soup kitchens for the families of
striking and imprisoned teachers.

On July 19, a nationwide one-day
strike was called by all Left organ-
izations in support of the teachers,
against government repression, and
against a 30% increase in the cost
of living (devaluation of Peruvian
currency and lifting of subsidies
on basic necessities). The strike,
which successfully paralyzed pro-
duction, transportation, and commerce
in the entire country, was followed
by the arrest of hundreds of strike
leaders and new government deals
with the International Monetary
Fund, increasing the indebtedness
which is at the root of Peru's
economic crisis and subservience
to foreign interests.

Inspired by the example of the
Nicaraguan people, the Peruvian
Left is making progress in uniting
its forces to prepare for partici-
pation in promised elections and
to form a People’s Army to back up
its demands. In this process, women
are taking on more and more responsi-
bilities. Both within the political

parties and independent of them,
women are organizing to establish

a tactical and strategic program
relating to women's special needs
and problems. A demonstration

was held in Lima recently to protest
the sexual abuse of 26 women in a
textile factory who were forced to
take "medical examinations” in order
to retain their jobs. The women also
demanded the release of women pris-
oners, some of whose only "crime"
was organizing women’s meetings.

The politically active women of
Peru, most of whom have only recent-
ly emerged from traditional family
life, retain much of the strength
and dignity that they knew before
the conquest of Peru by Europeans
(and subsequently its domination by
North Americans). Their emergence

as a political force in a country
that is "ripe for revolution" will
be important to all women and to

the future of revolutionary move-
ments

in Latin America.

*Lolita Lebrón Freed;
‘More committed
than ever...

Susan Goding

Puerto Rican nationalist Lolita
Lebrón along with Rafael Cancel
Miranda, Irvin Flores and Collazo
are free after 25 - 28 years in U.S.
jails.

March 1st, 1954, Lebrón led an
attack on the U.S. House of Repre-
sentatives in protest of "Law 600"
which declared Puerto Rico a common-
wealth under U.S. jurisdiction.

Their release came out of an agree-
ment between the U.S. and Cuba in
which Cuba released four men held as
U.S. spies in exchange for the release
of Lebrón and her comrades.

According to U.S. government statis-
tics the Puerto Rican Nationalist
Party is supported by only 7% of
Puerto Rico. Yet, the four were met
at the airport in San Juan, Puerto
Rico by a tumultuous welcome of
throngs of people chanting, "Vive
Puerto Rico Libre".

Several unions were granted the
afternoon off and the mayors of at
least two municipalities - Guayanilla
and Lajas - gave municipal workers
time off to attend the reception.

When asked if she would take up
armed struggle again, after 25 years
in prison, Lebrón replied "I will do
whatever is necessary for a free
Puerto Rico. We are stronger than
ever, more committed than ever. I
hate bombs, but we may have to use
them."
