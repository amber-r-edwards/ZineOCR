Another Whitewash

The Kerr-McGee plant where  
Karen Silkwood worked until  
she was murdered was shut  
down early in 1975 with an  
uncontested record of radio-  
active hazards. Kerr-McGee  
officials say it is now  
"clean" enough to be reopened  
as a coal liquefaction re-  
search and development opera-  
tion. Silkwood trial testi-  
mony established that pluto-  
nium residue in the floors  
and walls has been simply  
painted over to contain it.

Polish Feminist

A group of women recently  
met at Warsaw University to  
form a feminist organization  
and draw up a list of demands.  
The demands included materni-  
ty leave for students more  
than 3 months pregnant, great-  
er responsibility of men for  
childcare and abortion, and  
equal status under the law  
for married and unmarried cou-  
ples. The group hopes to pub-  
lish a newsletter and to  
establish a women's theater  
and gallery. The new organi-  
zation welcomes contact with  
groups, send to Krystina Kow-  
alewska, Uniwersytet Warzaw-  
ski, U Krakowski, Przedmies-  
cie 24, 00-325 Warzawa, Poland.

One In Ten

Clerical and technical  
workers at Boston University  
have ratified a contract  
that has strict protection  
against sexual harassment on  
the job. The clause states  
that the university “agrees  
to post in all work areas a  
statement of its commitment  
to this principle." And to  
transfer an employee to an  
equivalent position if she  
feels unable to return to her  
job. This decision comes on  
the heels of a report that  
1 woman in 10 has left a job  
because of sexual harassment.

Save That Tree

A woman in Kingfield, ME,  
rescued a tree near her house  
from state highway department  
chainsaws by climbing it and  
refusing to come down. 31  
year old Jill Royall finally  
consented to descend from her  
perch after a town meeting  
was called at her house to  
discuss neighborhood object-  
ions to the felling of the  
century old tree.

Our Health & Lives

"Project Censored," a na-  
tionwide media research pro-  
ject conducted at Sonoma  
State University, selected  
the top ten 'censored' stor-  
ies of 1980. The 4th ranking  
‘censored' story was The Be-  
nectin Coverup. Runners up  
included Exploitation of  
Third World Women, Ghetto-  
izing the Elderly in America,  
The ‘Neurotic Woman’ Syndrome,  
and Oral Contraceptives Fal-  
sely Reported Safe. No comment.

Natives Deported

Police authorities in South  
Africa have arrested 1700  
Black ‘squatters’ living in  
tents outside Johannesburg.  
Most were women and children  
camped near the city to pro-  
test government policies  
which force wives to live in  
barren, distant homelands,  
apart from husbands who have  
jobs in South African cities.  
All were jailed, pending  
deportation to their tribal  
homelands (similar to reser-  
vations in the U.S.)

It Didn't Pay

Johns Hopkins, the first  
hospital to do sex-change  
surgery in the U.S., has  
stopped doing it. They say  
they've based this decision  
on a study that called into  
question the benefits of  
these drastic operations.  
The study found that—listen  
carefully—those who changed  
from female to male all  
earned MORE after surgery,  
but most of the male-to-  
female transsexuals earned  
a LOWER income after their  
change. Are they trying to  
tell us that it doesn't pay  
to be a woman?

Collectives Clean Up

In Scotland, cleaning women  
have organized two collec-  
tives to fight high unemploy-  
ment, low wages and miserable  
working conditions. Ranging  
in age from 30 to 79, the  
women now set their own wages  
and have almost abolished  
night work. The women said,  
“We know we were pretty well  
exploited before, but now  
we're getting our own back.  
Take heart and do what we  
did."

Foster Dies

Jeannette Howard Foster,  
author of Sex Variant Women  
In Literature, died on July  
26th. She was 87 years old.  
Foster began research on her  
book in 1937 and for the  
next 30 years moved around  
the U.S. taking whatever jobs  
would give her access to  
rare lesbian volumes. Her  
book, still the most thorough  
and readable bibliography of  
lesbians in literature from  
ancient Greece, the Bible  
to the 1950s, covering works  
in English, French, German  
and other languages will be  
reissued by Naiad Press in  
1983.

Congress Gets Food

During a Congressional Bud-  
get debate, Representative  
Henry Gonzales (D-TX) asked  
why food stamp programs for  
the poor were being cut while  
subsidies continued for the  
House and Senate restaurants.  
Representative Jamie Whitten  
(D-MS) had the answer, "On  
the basis that it is essen-  
tial and economical, econo-  
mical for the country and for  
the Congress to have food  
available around here." But  
not essential or economical  
for us, huh.

Toxic Tampons

Through research on patent  
applications of the 1970s,  
Women Health International  
found that manufacturers were  
apparently using substances  
such as acetic acid, polyvin-  
yl alcohol, ethers, methyl-  
cellulose and phenol among  
other chemicals. Phenol and  
acetic acid are listed by  
the Toxic Substances Control  
Sourcebook as possible toxic  
substances. When Toxic Shock  
Syndrome (TSS) erupted, it  
was suggested that carboxy-  
methylcellulose, used in  
Rely and other superabsorbent  
tampons, might well be the  
factor linked to TSS.

Profitable Findings

Ever wonder what chemicals  
are used in commercial sperm-  
icides and douches? Mercury,  
radium and boric acid, all  
toxic substances, have been  
used, all of which can be ab-  
sorbed by the body and can  
cause birth defects. As far  
back as 1918, there was evi-  
dence that the vagina was cap-  
able of absorbing toxins. On  
Jan. 19, 1981, the Council on  
Environmental Quality issued  
a report suggesting the same  
thing. It pointed out that  
less than 5% of the 55,000  
chemical substances in commer-  
cial production have been  
tested for their effect on  
reproduction. The 1981 re-  
port's conclusion—more re-  
search, our conclusion—we've  
heard enough.

Poor Get 4 Years

In Siskiyou County, CA, men  
and women between the ages  
of 18 and 35 who receive  
general welfare assistance  
are now required to try to  
enlist in the armed forces.

A good example of how "vol-  
untary" our (poor) peoples  
army is.
