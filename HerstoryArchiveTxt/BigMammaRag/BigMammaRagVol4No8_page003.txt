Poetry Missed

Hello:

In response to an item in a recent
issue of AMR, I would like to say that
I am the other woman, besides Choco-
late Waters, who misses poetry in the
paper. I understand that with the in-
creased amount of news your staff
must handle, space is at a premium,
but I still think that poetry and art-
work by local women is better than
obscure syndicated graphics and muddy
photos. Some of the staff have told
me the problems you have had in the
past working with women artists — it

Hi there,
I noticed you are having some pro-

blems—is there anything I can do from

Fort Collins to help? Unfortunate-
ly I am living up here and am ob-

viously limited in my helping capabil-
ities, but I will do what I can if you

have any suggestions. I have
written a couple of things for you in
the past and if that's what's needed
I'm willing.
Let me know if there is anything I
can do.
In solidarity,
Lee McDavid

is a drag trying to squeeze work out
of people, but surely you have enough
of a backlog of submitted poetry that
could be used in dead space until
time and money permits more art?

: Big Mama welcomes the artwork from a woman. The Woman to Woman School has been
in existence for almost a year now,

I’d also like to remind you that the
deadline for any submissions is the twelfth of the
month.

We are telling you this now so that you realize
that without a great deal of energy
input in the next few months the
Woman to Woman School will fold.

All of us involved in the school
(students, resource persons, collec-
tive members) have never really
gotten together to talk about our
school. Should we continue? Is it
really doing any good? Do we really
have the support of the women of
Denver?

You are all invited, welcomed, and
urged to come to a general meeting
of the Woman to Woman School on Mon-
day, September 13, 7:30 pm. The
meeting will be held in the basement
of the Woman to Woman Center. If
you cannot attend this meeting but
are interested in the School's fu-
ture, call and let us know what you
think.

Please understand that this meet-
ing is crucial to the future exist-

Dear Friend,

Politics and Culture

Dear women of Big Mama Rag:

I enjoy reading BMR a lot but have
trouble keeping up with it. I usually
miss two or three issues in a row.
So I have finally got it together and
am sending in for a subscription.
Please start it as soon as possible.
Also, if there are back issues avail-
able I would be interested.

A great concern of mine is the area
of politics and culture, performance
especially music. I like constructive crit-
icism of performers and music both
from a political and musical point of
view, although I haven't been able
to find much musical criticism/review
in the feminist press. I think there
needs to be a great deal more discus-
sion of these kinds of things.

Thanks,
Diane Gosier

Sado-masochism

To the BMR Collective:

Many lesbians are in a process of
self-definition, of their lives,
their names, their appearance, their
politics and their sexuality.

Lesbian-feminist s-m are the words
which go with one variety (many var-
ieties, actually) of sexual expres-
sion.

I wrote the articles which appeared
in Hera and R-f (“Coming Out On S-M",
Spring, 1976) because I wanted to
share with my sisters my experiences
and thinking in this area. The arti-
cle in Hera generated a lot of dis-
cussion in Philadelphia and I felt
that I had accomplished my purpose in
that women here were rethinking
their views on both the stereotypes
they had previously associated with
s-m and lesbian love-making.

I believe that when women talk,
when women touch, when women make
love, the act is different than the
same act performed with men. I use
the term s-m, rather than sado-maso-
chism because the latter and the pic-
tures it conjures up do not speak to
my reality.

I came out on s-m as an act of pol-
itical struggle; your treatise in the
June/July issue (ironically enough,
under the heading "Struggle") was an
analysis based on fear rather than
experience, a put down on women who
admit that their sexual tastes differ
from your prescriptions, and, in gen-
eral, erotiphobic.

Since the appearance of my articles,
I have come to the conclusion that

Big Mama Rag Vol.4 No.8

even the terms s and m are not use-
ful - they are merely springboards so
that my sisters and I can discover
together what it is that we are
talking about. I wonder if the our
collective insists on terms like
"cunnilingus" or “mutual masturba-
tion". Those are, after all, the
correct terms for some popular les-
bian practices.

I have no idea what post-revolu-
tionary love-making would be like. I
feel in my woman-soul that it will in-
clude things that we, as of now, do
not even consider erotic. Who can say,
perhaps it will exclude s-m. More
likely it will throw away the words
which have to do with shame and op-
pression, while holding on to the
transcendence.

My lover moved to Denver and attem-
pted to join the B.U.K. collective. She
was told that she could not be trus-
ted politically by B.U.K. unless she
disavowed s-m. This, sisters, is your
loss. Her radical feminist vision and
input would be an asset in any wom-
en's community.

Furthermore, what does it mean if
we will only work politically with
women with whom we totally agree?

In your treatise you protest sex
that is orgasmically oriented and
sex that is used to address personal
and interpersonal problems. Do you
screen prospective members of your
