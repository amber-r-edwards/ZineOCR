Proctor & Gamble On Trial

Deletha Dawn, an 18-year
old woman from Littleton, CO
and her parents sought $25
million in medical expenses,
actual damages, and punitive
damages in a suit against

national

Proctor & Gamble, makers of
Rely tampons. Throughout the
case presented in Denver Fed-
eral Court, Deletha tried to
prove she contracted toxic
shock syndrome in May 1980, a
few days after using Rely
tampons. She further contend-
ed that she suffered long
lasting physical and emotion-
al damage from the illness.
Her two-week case, which ended
with a guilty verdict against
the makers of Rely for negli-
gence and for selling a defec-
tive product, however, no cash
award was given to Deletha.
In spite of the unusual find-
ing, the jury made no comment
as to the hows and whys of
their verdict.

In spite of the fact that
the company had removed

Rely tampons from store shelves
in Sept. 1980 after the
National Center for Disease
Control in Atlanta, GA said
there was a statistical con-
nection between the illness
and the tampon; Proctor & Gam-
ble's defense was that Deletha
had the flu.

While both sides contend
that the decision was a vic-
tory, Deletha's lawyer has
filed a motion to at least re-
cover medical expenses, and
the Proctor & Gamble's lawyers
are considering additional
motions to obtain a complete
rather than the present par-
tial exoneration. Deletha's
case is the first of over 400
lawsuits, many of which in-
volve the death of women,
filed nationwide against the
Proctor & Gamble Co. of Cin-
cinnati.

Some Call Them Sanitary

I would like to be a waitress for a day,
and set the table at the restaurant
where the (all-male) Rotary Club holds its

monthly
luncheon, and put

to the left of each plate, just

so under the dinner

fork and the salad fork
instead of linen, at each
place a Kotex, twisted
steaming, and then stand
at attention, linen
folded politely over my arm, ~
and watch the fun

Death & Disease Coming Up

For all the good it will do
"warnings" have been issued
by various official medical
mouthpieces that the effects
of Reagonomics will be seen
in an increase in deaths of
infants of women of color and
poor women and a revival of
childhood epidemics such as:
polio, measles, rubella, teta-
nus, diphtheria, and whooping
cough. Estimates are that
over two million children who
would have been immunized
will be lost to federal cut-
backs. It has already been
documented that the incidence
of measles rises and falls as

federal grants to control the
disease are increased.

Twice as many babies are
born to women of color in the
U.S. who weigh less than 5.5
pounds than white women.
Birth weight is a primary fac-
tor in infant mortality, and
income levels largely deter-
mine pre-natal care and the
resulting birth weight. Another

face of genocide brought

to women of color and Third
World women and poor women by
the health care system, while
health care for building
lives is denied.

“Health Care” From I.N.S.

Health care is essentially
non-existent in the U.S. pri-
son system. This reality is
again pointed out in the
treatment of 62 Haitian women
who have been jailed at Alderson
Federal Prison in West
Virginia. These women are iso-
lated from all others...eat-
ing separately, they can make
no calls and receive only
calls from relatives. The wo-
men are counted five times a
day, twice in the night as
flashlights survey their
faces. Jailed for the "crime”
of being plain old "economic
refugees (just out to better
their own lot)" as opposed
to being "political refugees
(those out to escape politi-
cal oppression)" by the U.S.
government. Speaking for them-
selves, the Haitian women say
"We have fled from the 'Macou-
tes' (the Haitian national
security force), from a dicta-
torial regime, to take refuge
in a country where we thought
human rights reigned. On the
contrary, we have fallen prey
to the worst kind of execu-
tioner; we have fallen in the
mouth of the biggest wolves."

One woman has already at-
tempted suicide and others

threaten to do the same. Another
woman suffering from
"nervous seizures" is left, her
lips bleeding and her body
bruised. Others have been hos-
pitalized for stress, and
still others left untreated
for ulcers, migraine headaches,
and severe "depression." One
woman who was three months
pregnant miscarried following
an unidentified injection giv-
en her at Krome Koncentration
Kamp in Miami. After the mis-
carriage, she continued to
bleed and suffer from abdom-
inal pains.

Sources from Krome and Fort
Allen in Puerto Rico report
that all the women are given
what are believed to be abor-
tion-inducing drugs. The Im-
migration and Naturalization
Service is preventing Haitian
women from giving birth in
the U.S. as the children would
automatically have dual citi-
zenship in the U.S. and Haiti.
Racism all too clearly con-
trols who will and who will
not receive health care and
what kind.

Meeting on Health in Geneva

Over 500 women and organiza-

All the following is taken
