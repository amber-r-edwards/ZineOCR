Women Disrupt Feminist Concert

Verbal harassment, (lesbian) sep-
aratist rhetoric, physical violence,
racism, and theft were some of the un-
solicited side effects of the 11th
Annual Women and the Law Conference
held in San Francisco February 28 -
March 2.

A skirmish broke out at the March
1 concert, organized by the Conference
committee, when Ray Obiedo walked
on stage to perform with Mary
Watkins and Linda Tillery. Obiedo
had been hired to replace Jerene
Jackson. His arrival was met with
jeers, boos, and shouts of "Get the
fuck off the stage" and "Pricks
shouldn't play lesbian music."

Along with verbal threats, tobacco
butts, bottles, and tomatoes were
thrown at the performers. Shouts of
"Let him play" could be heard. A
crowd of 100 angry women, some pro-
testing Obiedo's appearance, others
protesting the disturbance, left the
Civic Auditorium for the foyer, where
Conference security volunteers and
uniformed guards tried to restore
peace and discuss the issues. Pro-
ducer Ellen LaCroix found herself sur-
rounded by a mob of angry women. "I
have never felt so physically intim-
idated by a crowd in my life," she
said.

While LaCroix and Conference organ-
izer Sally Kilberg were acting as
mediators, Kilberg was slapped in the
face by a woman protestor. The crowd
dispersed soon after that, still de-
manding refunds.

"I was really scared," said Confer-
ence coordinator Marilyn Endress.

"It was the first time in my life I
was physically afraid of being hurt
by a woman. These women were not
angry, they were more than angry."

It appears that the majority of the
audience, some 4,000 persons, thought
the actions of the disrupters wrong.
"I think the women yelling about
pricks playing women's music offered
an inappropriate form of criticism,"
said concert-goer Denise Wagner.
"I think we owe our women performers
respect, and if these women said it
was okay for a man to perform with
them I think we should trust their
choices."

"The action of these women was not
only disruptive," said producer La-
Croix, "but racist.” This was really
a black women's performance, almost a
first in the Bay Area. Whether inten-
ded or not, the disruption of this
event was racist and definitely anti-
feminist."

Linda Tillery, featured performer
at the concert, concurs. "It really
grossed me out to be a black perfor-
mer and to be heckled by white women.
It reminded me of stories Bessie
Smith told about the ropes of the
tent she was performing in being cut
by the Klan, who'd then lynch a few
niggers for fun." Tillery said she
felt no need to inform her audience
of the program change because she
"knew the concert was open to the
public."

"The concert was never advertised
as a woman-only event," maintains
LaCroix. But the Conference co-
ordinating committee still remains
split on whether to refund money for
the concert, though the official word
is no refunds.

A separatist in the audience who
was not involved in the fracas told
Plexus, "I believe there were women
who came to the concert intending to
disrupt it. I know several separat-
ists who simply left quietly when
they realized the show was not what
they expected." She worried that the
concert disruption would undermine
the politics and struggle of sep-
aratism: "I act out of love and sol-
idarity with women, not in reaction
to men or hatred of men. When a
small group disrupts a large event
and manipulates a mob confrontation,
we must examine exactly who benefits-
in this case, the actions were decid-
edly anti-woman and anti-separatist.
The real issue is racism, not sep-
aratism."

Besides the concert disruption,
the Women and the Law Conference was
robbed of nearly $4,000 from their
offices at the Golden Gate Univer-
sity. The major portion of the money
was in checks. Stop payments were
made when the theft was discovered
March 5 and new checks have been re-
issued by two major contributors.
But $520 was lost.

A report was filed with the San
Francisco police when the theft was
discovered Wednesday morning. At
this time, there is no suspect. “I
doubt the police are even investiga-
ting the robbery," said LaCroix. "If
they are, we haven't heard about it."

—— eo

We are writing to condemn the dis-
picable attack...(which) is a reac-
tionary and misguided political
stance, coming from the...premise
that men, not the system, are the
enemy. It concludes that there is no
other oppression but sexism, thus
ignoring racism, homophobia against
men, and class oppression...Would
white women have been subjected to
the same barrage of insults?

Karen Brodine

We are two people who were silent
at the concert...This letter is being
written in a spirit of self-criticism.

... There are definite racist im-
plications of a largely white audi-
ence heckling black performers...
why would people bring tomatoes to a
concert in the first place?

The events of the concert point
to the many deep and painful divi-
sions in our community; their ser-
iousness challenges all of us to be
aware of our actions, their impli-
cations and the need for continued
struggle.

Rape Study

Rape, according to popular miscon-
ception, is something that happens
between strangers, with suddenness,
violence, and sometimes sadism or
murder.

But according to evidence from the
first clinical study of convicted ra-
pists, reported by the New York Times,
rape between husbands and wives is
just like rape between strangers--
in terms of motivation, type of as-
sault, problems in completing the act,
and the personality of the rapist.

"There are more similarities than
differences," said A.N. Groth, dir-
ector of the Sex Offender Program for
Connecticut's Department of Correc-
tions in Somers. Groth, who has sum-
marized some of his findings in a
book, Men Who Rape, said that whether
the victim is a wife or a stranger, "the
psychology of the offender is the
same."

Groth reports that more than one-
third of the convicted rapists he
has spoken to (500 men) were married
and sexually active with their wives
when they committed their crimes.
Those who were divorced, separated,
or single reported sexual involvment
in at least one consenting relation-
ship. This observation bolsters the
view of rape as a crime of aggression
not passion or frustrated desire.

Groth says, "A man doesn't rape
for sex any more than an alcoholic
drinks because he's thirsty. Rape
is not the aggressive expression of
sexuality. It's the sexual expres-
sion of aggression.”

While only one of Groth's subjects
had been convicted of raping his
wife, others admitted that their
wives had been among their victims.
These men drew a clear distinction
between ordinary sex with their wives
and rape, which they viewed as a pun-
ishment, he said.

"The man who rapes his wife has
no sense of her as a person, or of
her needs," Groth said. "There's
not much mutuality, sharing, warmth,
or trust in such a marriage. The
wife is seen as property." He added
that rapists generally had shallow
relationships with women, tended to
feel threatened by them, and saw them
as privileged or extremely powerful
in all aspects except physical
strength.

"Retarded ejaculation has enormous
legal implications," Groth said.
"Women who say they have been raped
can't get others to believe them if
no sperm is found."

Groth's tape-recorded interviews
with rapists indicate that all cases
of rape can be grouped in three cat-
egories of motives--anger, power, and
sadism--and that the relative fre-
quency of these motives is the same
in marital rape as in the rape of
strangers.

The sadistic rapist, who may maim
and murder, is extremely rare, he
said. The angry rapist, who brutal-
izes his victim, leaving her with in-
juries, torn clothing, or other ob-
vious signs of attack, is more com-
mon. And the power rapist, who re-
asserts his masculinity by coercing
and subduing the victim, is by far
the most typical. The power rapist
is the hardest to convict, however,
because the cooperation he elicits
from the victim through threats may
later be misconstrued as consent.

In marital rape, the issues are
even more confused, Groth feels, be-
cause the offender has many meanings
to the victim and plays several roles.

Corrected text: Reveals Similarities

Since the concert I have been in
a state of shock...it’s not every day
that I have the dubious honor of wit-
nessing a fascist tantrum...

Although there are some who refuse
to accept it, SLAVERY HAS BEEN AB-
OLISHED!

I respect/support Tui & Mary's
right to work with whomever they want
& whenever they want! No one has the
right to dictate otherwise!

... those irrational acts of fasc-
ism brought the ever-present/unspoken/
ugliness out in the open & united
artists across sexual/racial/politi-
cal lines faster than anything in the
history of art as I know it! Every
artist everywhere was hurt, but made
stronger by the insanity at Civic
Auditorium that night.

We, the sisters of Zulema, feel
that the incident that took place
during the concert was deplorable.
To have a sister, who has been sup-
portive and very active as a Third
World lesbian feminist in the Wo-
men's community degraded, insulted,
and violated because she had a male
musician in her band is a total con-
tradiction of the theory of feminism.
We refuse to stand for this treatment
in the women's community.

The disruption was only one in
a series of confrontations between
Third World women musicians/artists
and the women's community.

Sojourner Truth's famous
"Ain't I A Woman" speech is a favor-
ite slogan of the women's community.
It appears that a Third World woman's
politics and slogans are fine if the
woman is dead but if she's alive it's
a different story.

Because of our history we cannot
afford to separate ourselves from
Third World men. Many white women
ignore the fact that as Third World
women we have to struggle against
racism as well as sexism. What hope
do we as Third World people have if
we are separated according to sex?
True, we struggle against sexism in
our various Third World movements,
but we also struggle against racism
in the women's movement. We do not
see masses of white women coming
forward to eliminate racism in this
society. To cut ourselves off from
Third World men and to turn our backs
on the problems of racism in this
society would be akin to suicide.

Zulema

Linda Tillery and Mary Watkins
perpetrated a deceptive, divisive act
on the very community of which it
was assumed they were a part...

Why didn't Tui and Watkins con-
tact a woman guitarist?...Now that
we have begun to establish control
over our art forms why invite males
into our space?...

(an) assumption that hundreds
of women would not have paid $6 to
attend a concert that included male
performers is, I believe, a fair one.

We certainly deserved an ex-
planation, a response to the vocal
protest that erupted...No explanation
was given...

Women's space is small enough...
To defile that space without prior
warning is to perpetrate an act of
violence upon one's sisters...Their
irresponsible act...remains a raw
wound in the breast of the women's
community.

Hannah C. Goldman

As organizers of the Conference
we would like to initiate a dis-
cussion about the disturbance...
Although we know and understand
the importance of a "woman's space,"
we were unable to provide one at
this event. At no time did we plan
or advertise this concert as a "wo-
men only" celebration. We regret
this misunderstanding...
What happened at the concert was
both shocking and disillusioning...
we do not wish to submit to
