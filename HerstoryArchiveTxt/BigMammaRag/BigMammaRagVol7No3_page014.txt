Know Your Rights... As A Renter

Leases

A written lease should protect both  
the landlord and the tenant. Most  
leases are either of six months or one  

year duration.

A standard lease form  

can be obtained from a book or stat-  

ionery store.

You can usually add  

special provisions to these forms to  
fit your special lease problems.

The  

least amount of problems  
will arise if both parties know  
and understand the terms of the  
lease. The landlord should  
explain these terms so that the  
tenant clearly understands them.  
If any portion of the lease is  
to be altered, both the landlord  
and the tenant should initial  
the change.

Both landlord and tenant should  

agree upon a ‘subletting’ pro-  
vision in the lease:

- Some leases specify that the  

security deposit can be re-  
tained by the landlord if clean-  
ing needs to be done by the  
landlord after the tenant va-  
cates. In such cases both par-  
ties must be aware of the Colorado  
Security Deposit statute,  
which states that, "no security  
deposit shall be retained to  
cover normal wear and tear." It  
also defines “normal wear and  
tear." Furthermore, this law  
states that if any provision of  
the statute for the benefit of  
the tenant is waived by the  
tenant in the lease or orally,  
it "shall be deemed to be  
against public policy and shall  
be void." (C.R.S 1973, 38-12-102  
103). It remains for the court  
to determine from the merits and  
facts of each individual case as  
to whether the “cleaning” per-  
formed by the landlord was for  
purposes beyond “normal wear and  
tear."

To avoid other common disputes  

the lease should contain pro-  

visions setting forth who is  

responsible for:

(a) All utilities.

(b) Repairs on appliances, plumb-  
ing, heating, etc.

(c) Yard care, trash, snow re-  
moval, etc.

The lease should contain a fixed  

due date for rent. If there is  
to be a grace period and late  
penalty fee, it should be spec-  
ified in the lease. Any late  
penalty fee must be reasonable.

Where the landlord or tenant  

agrees to do any work or furnish  
materials connected with the  
premises, it should be in writing  
and should fix a time for com-  
pletion. Also, the exact amount  
of rent reduction due the tenant  
for repairs should be fixed in  
writing and signed by both par-  
ties at the commencement of the  
lease.

If there is no written lease the  

tenant is normally holding the  
premises on a month-to-month  
tenancy, if the rent is paid  
monthly. If the tenant desires  
protection from a rent increase  
or eviction without grounds, the  
tenant should consider having a  
six-month to a year lease. How-  
ever, if the tenant moves out  
before the end of the term of the  
written lease, the tenant may be  
liable for the balance of the  
rent.

Landlord Liens

Where the landlord is due money for  

rent,  

he may assert a lien against  

the personal property of the tenant.  
(C.R.S. 1973, 38-20-102).

The landlord must obtain the  
property by “peaceable” means.  
If the tenant or the tenant's  
representative is present and  
objects, it is not “peaceable.”  
(C.R.S. 1973, 38-20-102, (3)(c))

According to Colorado statutes,  

the landlord cannot remove beds,  
bedding, small kitchen appli-  
ances, clothes, documents and  
personal effects. (C.R.S. 1973,  
38-20-102, (3)(a)).

The landlord must follow legal  

proceedings for lien foreclosure  
precisely as defined by statute  
or risk both losing the lien  
rights and entitling the tenant  
to damages.

Lien actions are generally com-  

plex and require the aid of a  
private attorney.

The law is not clear whether  

the landlord of a single-family  
dwelling is entitled to the  
landlord's lien. Although the  
statute does not provide for it,  
many judges allow this common  
law right.

Lockout By Landlord

The landlord may not "lockout" a  
tenant for any reason, unless the  
landlord first obtains a court order.  
Whether or not the tenant has broken  

the  

lease, a landlord is still inter-  

fering with a tenant's right to a  
peaceable possession until a legal  
court eviction.

If the landlord “locks out" a  
tenant without a court order,  
the tenant may re-enter with  
minimum damage to the lock, etc.  

The tenant may sue for damages and  
the landlord loses the right to  
exercise lien action.

If the landlord, in good faith,  
believes the tenant has vacated  
the premises, the landlord may  
enter for the purpose of pre-  
serving and safeguarding the  
property, or to clean it up to  
re-rent it in order to reduce  
any damages which the tenant  
may owe.

Evictions

THE LANDLORD MAY EVICT A TENANT FOR:

1. FAILURE TO PAY RENT ON TIME.  
The landlord must first give the  
tenant a written notice demanding  
that the tenant either pay the  
rent or move out within three  
days. (C.R.S. 1973, 13-40-104 (1)  
(d)).

(a) If the tenant fails to pay or  
move, the landlord may, on  
the 4th day, commence an  
eviction proceeding in county  
court (C.R.S. 1973, 13-40-  
110). The court fee is $9.00  
plus a few dollars, if the  
Sheriff serves these papers  
for the landlord.

These eviction papers will  
require that the tenant  
either file a response or  
appear in court within 5 to  
10 days.

(b) The tenant may contest the  
eviction if the tenant thinks  
there are legal grounds by  
filing an answer on or before  
the time set by the court.

If the tenant files an answer  
contesting the eviction, the  
case will be set for trial  
within approximately 5 days.

(c) If the tenant fails to answer  
or appear on the date indi-  
cated in the eviction papers,  
the tenant will then have 48  
hours to vacate or be forc-  
ibly removed by the Sheriff's  
Department.

2. BREAKING ANY TERMS OF THE LEASE.

If the tenant breaks any of the  
written or oral terms of the  
lease, the tenant may be evicted  
in much the same manner as non-  
payment of rent. (C.R.S. 1973,  
13-40-104 (1)(e)).

(a) In such cases, the landlord  
obtains the proper form  
which the landlord serves  
upon the tenant requesting  
the tenant to leave by a  
fixed time, specifying the  
grounds. Even if the tenant  
remedies the situation, the  
landlord may still proceed  
to evict the tenant.

(b) If the tenant fails to leave,  
the landlord must follow the  
same proceedings as above.

If a landlord wants  
to evict a tenant at the end of  
the lease period and follows the  
correct legal procedure, the  
landlord can do so without giving  
a reason. The landlord must give  
the tenant proper notice to  
leave,

Notice must be served on the  
tenant not less than the  
required number of days be-  
fore the end of the lease  
period. Unless the lease pro-  
vides otherwise, the required  
number of days is as follows:  
(C.R.S 1973, 13-40-107)  
1) Lease period of one year  
or longer: 3 months  
2) Lease period of six  
months up to one year:  
7 months  
3) Lease period of one month  
up to six months: 10 days  
4) Lease period of one week  
to one month: 3 days  
5) Lease period of less than  
one week: 1 day  

The length of the lease per-  
iod is determined from the  
language of the lease, and if  
the lease doesn't specify the  
length of the lease period,  
it will probably be deter-  
mined by the frequency of  
rental payments. For ex-  
ample, if rent is due each  
month, it is a month-to-month  
tenancy or lease.

The law is unclear in sit-  
uations where the original  
lease has expired. Some  
courts apply the notice re-  
quired by the expired lease  
while others base the notice  
period on a lease period de-  
termined from the rental pay-  
ments.

If the tenant fails to leave,  

the landlord, again, must fol-  
low the procedure set forth in  
Section 1, above.

Damage Deposits

Security (damage) deposits may be  
used to pay rent if the tenant skips,  
or fails to pay for any damages  
"beyond normal wear and tear" to the  

premises.

(See also discussion under  

Leases.)

Requirements:

The landlord must return the  
damage deposit or send an item-  
ized list of damages and costs  
of repair to the tenant's last  
known address within 30 days  
after the tenant vacates. The  
lease may extend this time  
period up to 60 days. (C.R.S.  
1973, 38-12-103).

If the landlord fails to send  

this letter within 30 days, the  
landlord loses all right to the  
damage deposit, even though  
there are damages. (C.R.S. 1973,  
38-12-103).

If the landlord withholds the  
damage deposit in violation of  
Section 38-12-103, the landlord  
may be liable for triple the  

amount wrongfully and willfully  

withheld plus attorney fees and  
costs.
