Molester Dies

Mother Defends Children

Yvonne Wanrow, a Colville
Indian (Lake Band) is appealing
the 25-year prison sentence she
has received for killing a man
who attempted to molest her
young son and had earlier raped

her babysitter's 7-year-old
daughter.
Wanrow is a 31-year-old

divorced mother of three
children living in Spokane. She
is an artist and writer and since
her arrest in 1972 has done
work at the local Indian
alcoholism center, helped to
establish a spiritual center for
Indians outside Spokane, and
taken in Indian children who are
unable to stay with their
families.

On Friday, August 11, 1972,
Yvonne Wanrow’s 8-year-old son
Darren was staying with a white
woman named Shirley Hooper.
Wanrow, her leg broken in a fall,
had seen her doctor and was
resting at home. Darren and the
babysitter's 10-year-old daughter
were playing outside when they
were approached by a man
named William Wesler, 62, who
lived two houses away from the

Hoopers. He enticed the children inside
his home, locked his door, and
picked up a knife. While the
other child struggled to get the
door open, Darren distracted
Wesler, sustaining severe
bruises on his arm before both
children managed to escape by
kicking through the screen door
with Wesler chasing them.

7-Year-Old Raped

Shirley Hooper called
police. While they were taking

the same man who had “done that
thing” to her. Several months
previously, Hooper had taken the
child to a public health clinic for
a vaginal itch; doctors had
diagnosed and treated her for
venereal disease.

Mildred was too terrified to tell
her mother who had raped her
until she saw the police talking
to her mother and understood
what had happened to her sister
and Darren. The public health
authorities themselves had shown
no interest in pursuing the
matter at the time of the medical
examination.

The police were not surprised.
They were familiar with
“Chicken Bill,” as they called
him; it seemed that he had been
arrested on previous occasions
for child molestation and had
spent time in mental institutions. Despite this
knowledge, and despite the
statements of three terrified
children, the police made no

Monday, they suggested she
spread flour outside her
bedroom window so that there
would be footprints in case the
man returned that night, and
they left.

Tension Mounts

Shirley Hooper called Yvonne
Wanrow, who suggested that
she bring all the children to her
house that night. Hooper refused,
insisting instead that Yvonne
come to her house and bring her
gun, a gun purchased some time
previously because of threats
from white neighbors who said
they didn’t want a “dirty Indian”
on their street. Reluctantly,
Yvonne went to the Hooper
residence.

The two women stayed up to
watch over their five sleeping
children. They could hear noises
coming from the Wesler
residence, and around midnight,
the tension mounting, Hooper
asked Yvonne's sister and
brother-in-law to join them.
They came, bringing three more
children.

At five o'clock Saturday mor-
ning, just as dawn was breaking,
Yvonne's brother-in-law left the
house, unknown to the three
women; and he forgot to lock the
front door. He went to Wesler’s
house and accused him of being
a child rapist and Wesler, infuriated and drunk, charged over
to the Hooper residence.
Yvonne's brother-in-law
remained behind, struggling
with a man who was with
Wesler, David Kelly, 26.

Wesler, 6'2", drunken and
wild-eyed, pushed past Yvonne
who was standing at the door
screaming for help, and into the
living room. He lurched towards
Yvonne, 5'4” tall, in a cast and
on crutches, drew her pistol
from the waistband of her pants
and shot point blank at her
attacker. Wesler fell and Kelly,
entering the room at that mo-
ment, was wounded and fled.
Police Withhold Rights

Hooper called Spokane Crime
Check; Yvonne, upset, unaware
that the call was being recorded,
said she had shot a man. The
police continued to interrogate
her, never mentioning her rights
or telling her that the conversa-
tion was being recorded, while a
car was dispatched to the
Hooper residence.

When the police arrived,
Yvonne was asked to give a
statement — again, she was not
read her rights and she, Hooper,
and the brother-in-law were
taken to the police station where
Yvonne was booked on suspicion
of murder.

The tape of the conversation
Wanrow had with the state
police was admitted as evidence
during the trial, despite defense
motions against its inclusion. It
was also replayed during the
second day of jury deliberation.
The prosecution made much of
the deceptively calm tone of her
voice on the tape to try to say that
she had planned to kill Wesler
and had lured him to the Hooper
house.

Since the trial, three women
on the jury have stated that the
tape was the deciding factor in
their verdict of guilty as charged.
The verdict was handed down on
May 13 by an all-white jury of
seven women and five men.

Evidence Restricted

Evidence concerning William
Wesler’s record as a sex
offender was not allowed by the
authorities themselves to be
presented during the trial. They told
Hooper to file a complaint on
Yvonne and started to grab her.

A Government memorandum in
connection with Patricia
Swinton’s trial has brought to
light positive evidence that Jane
Alpert did not inform on Swin-
ton.

The memorandum calls for a
pre-trial hearing to determine
whether Alpert and John
Hughey, both of whom appear to
have material evidence against
the defendant, and no legal
justification for refusing to
provide such evidence, will be
in contempt of court for refusing
to testify.

According to the memorandum,

Byrna Talks About Susan

Janet Cooper, from her “Dyke
Cooper” column in Gay Com-
munity News, Boston.

Byrna Aronson, a strong civil
libertarian and highly-respected
member of the Philadelphia
lesbian feminist community,
was walking hand-in-hand with
Susan Saxe at the time of her
arrest on March 27.

True Revolution

“Since Susan was arrested,”
she says, “the women in our
community have started think-
ing with renewed fervor about
the political implications of what
it means to be a lesbian without
any power in this country. We
have been thinking as well about
what it means to be a
revolutionary and what it
means to put your life on the
line. We have also been con-
sidering what it means to see
social injustice and not to do
anything about it. Of course we
are also concerned about people
getting harassed and going to
jail.”

She hopes “that other people
who have had contact with
Susan will feel the effect of her
reverence for what is right and
just, and her abhorrence of the
exploitation, murder and
destruction that Amerika brings
down upon its own people and
the people of the rest of the
world. Eventually, I hope people
will realize, as I have, that the
only way to fight back is to fight
wholeheartedly because a true
revolution is made up of the
actions that bring it about. The
only way to do this is to be true to
yourself and the only way to be
true to oneself is to be ready to
pay the price for what you
believe.”

Courage and Strength

Byrna values her relationship
with Susan highly. “I can never
repay Susan for the awareness
she has given me, both political-
ly and personally, or for the joy of
our sharing. I imagine that in the
last five years she has shared
her wisdom and strengths with
many women and all of us are
better for it. I am in no danger for
my association with her, since I
didn’t know who she was. Part of
the danger I am in is my
willingness to try to protect
Katherine Power and Susan,
and I am doing that of my own
choosing. The rest of the danger
to me comes from my own
personal beliefs that testifying
before a Grand Jury is morally
wrong and that not fighting back
is morally wrong.”

Byrna’s experience with
Susan has also helped her to see
more clearly than ever the
implications of the actions taken
by other people who have been
harassed by Grand Juries and
the FBI in connection with this
case.

“I had thought about the
issues connected with this case
long before the events happened
to me and I am grateful for the
courage and strength of my
sisters and brothers in other
cities who are my models.
Thanks to them, I have had the
time to think about all the
implications and my responses
to them.
