WOMEN IN PRINT CONVENE

Vicki Piotter, Peg Hickox, Clare  
Strawn, Kate Sharp, and Tea

One hundred thirty-two women, re-  
presenting eight feminist projects,  
met for a Women in Print conference  
August 30th through September 5th at  
Camp Harriet Harding, 20 miles out-  
side of Omaha, Nebraska.

The conference was designed for  
women working in all-woman groups in  
the areas of feminist newspapers,  
magazines, presses, publishing, dis-  
tributing, and bookstores. The pur-  
pose of the conference was to allow  
women in print to meet each other  
for the first time, share skills and  
information, and to work towards  
strengthening our feminist communica-  
tions network.

Four women, representing Diana  
Press, Daughters, Inc. (publishing),  
Quest: A Feminist Quarterly, and  
Plexus (newspaper), were instrumental  
in organizing the conference. Initi-  
ally, in February 1976, they mailed  
a questionnaire to women's newspapers,  
presses, etc., asking for interested  
women to submit suggestions as to  
what should take place at such a con-  
ference. Using as guidelines the re-  
sponses of each group, the organizers  
carefully structured the conference  
beforehand into practical skill  
sharing, business detail, and politi-  
cal direction workshops. Each group  
chose the workshops it wished to at-  
tend before arriving, being well pre-  
pared for a serious, working confer-  
ence.

The organizers were also responsi-  
ble for conference finances, finding  
the location, and making sure there  
was enough food for the week's dura-  
tion. They are to be commended for

finding a centralized location, which -  
allowed midwest groups to get together  
for the first time, and for keeping  
the conference fee to $40 per woman.  
Getting To Know Us

The first day of the conference was  
arranged so that all the women atten-  
ding could meet together as a whole.  
This general meeting clarified that

Feminist Newspapers Set Up Nationwide Contact

Approximately ten newspapers from  
across the country were present at  
the Women In Print '76 Conference.  
Both coasts were well represented and  
there was also some participation by  
the central and southern sections of  
the country.

Workshops for newspapers consisted  
of both technical and political dis-  
cussions. The technical workshops  
included such topics as mailing, lay-  
out, reporting, taxes, use of libra-  
ries as news gathering sources, edit-  
ing, and increasing distribution. A  
great volume of information was pass-  
ed on from person to person through-  
out the week.

Each newspaper shared its experi-  
ence, doubts, and accomplishments  
without sitting in judgment on any  
other paper. Most of the workshops  
were well facilitated, well attended  
and followed by a criticism/self-  
criticism of the meeting. Workshops  
on layout, reporting and increasing  
distribution seemed to generate  
especially eager and animated dia-  
logue.

Political workshops included such  
topics as the responsibility of femi-  
nist newspapers, politics of promo-  
tion and advertising, independence  
and relation to the feminist movement,  
descriptions and politics of struc-  
ture.

Aside from the strictly political  
workshops a good deal of political  
discussion also arose in technical

all the conference women were white,  
mostly lesbian, and widely varied in  
age.

At this time, each of the 80 groups  
was allotted 10 minutes to introduce  
itself, describe its project, its ac-  
tivities, and what it hoped to gain  
from the conference. This lengthy  
process showed a vast diversity among  
the groups: some groups have been  
active 7 years, while others are just  
getting started; some have 12 women  
involved, while others have one or  
two; some groups operate as collectives,  
some as partnerships; some place  
a priority on the business as-  
pect of the project, while others on  
the political function; some groups  
are paid by their project, while ot-  
hers cannot be or choose not to do so.

After the women and their projects  
had formally introduced themselves,  
the remainder of the week was spent  
utilizing the numerous workshops to  
best advantage. Primarily, the work-  
shops were divided according to proj-  
ect type: simultaneous workshops  
were held for publishers, presses,  
bookstores, newspapers, etc. in a  
number of areas. Some workshops were  
scheduled for cooperative arrangements  
between differing groups, as well as  
for writers, librarians, book reviewers,  
and special workshops on grants and  
taxes. A few workshops were added  
which hadn't been prescheduled.

Four Denver projects were represen-  
ted at the Women In Print conference:  
Big Mama Rag, Emerging Woman Press,  
Woman to Woman Feminist Bookstore,  
and the Feminist News Service. These  
reporters attended mostly those work-  
shops specific to our projects and  
did not get a thorough account of  
what happened with the publishers,  
magazines and distributors.

In fact, one major criticism of the  
conference was the lack of inter-  
related workshops. Many groups felt  
they didn't have the chance to estab-  
lish a working connection with other  
aspects of the feminist media.

Another criticism was the lack of  
personal space. One of the special  
workshops called during the week be-  
came a space for conference partici-  
pants to relax and become acquainted  
with each other as women and not as  
the projects that sent them. This  
workshop, facilitated by WomanSpirit,  
generated a tremendous sense of trust  
and was among the more heavily atten-  
ded. Participants felt this sort of  
workshop should be a definite part of  
the planned agenda of next year's con-  
ference.

Which Road Are We Traveling?

The degree of political discussion  
varied from group workshop to group  
workshop. The conference, as a unit,

workshops insofar as it related. A  
great deal of communication effort  
and respect existed between the pa-  
pers during the workshops.

The topics that were especially and  
extensively discussed were the issues  
of taking editorial stands, inclusion  
and rejection of material, and the  
politics of structure.

In the editorials discussion some  
women felt that it is a feminist  
newspaper's duty solely to print news  
articles and to avoid writing edit-  
orials because they might inhibit the  
readers’ autonomous thinking. Other  
women felt a need and duty to print  
editorials on issues of current im-  
portance to the movement so as to  
spark dialogue that might not other-  
wise happen or to contribute to al-  
ready existing dialogue. Still other  
women felt that either limited edi-  
torializing was called for, or else  
comments made by individuals and not  
material based on writing style.

did little discussion of political  
direction despite the many perspectives  
present. Some women felt the  
emphasis should remain on skill shar-  
ing and that discussion of differenc-  
es would interfere with this process.  
Other women saw the priority to be  
defining political direction and felt  
that not discussing differences inter-  
fered with information sharing: if  
our political basis and goals are not  
similar, does the same information  
apply?

All women believed we should work  
towards complete control of our com-  
munication network and to support  
each other in this process. However,  
the conference avoided mass discuss-  
ion of some questions which circulated  
among individual women: Is our  
goal to build a feminist literary in-  
dustry competitive with the male in-  
dustry? Does this goal alone ensure  
positive economic and social changes  
for all women? Is the goal to build  
our media into big business, provid-  
ing jobs for women? Are there inher-  
ent contradictions between feminism  
and capitalism? Is our goal to create  
a large propaganda network which  
pushes women toward overturning our  
present system of male economics and  
government? Is moving toward a cen-  
tralization of feminist communication  
a positive or dangerous step? Is re-  
gional diversity our biggest strength  
or is regional isolation our biggest  
weakness?

Despite the potentially explosive  
nature of these questions, the con-  
ference was well controlled and re-  
mained calm throughout the week. Un-  
like many recent conferences, a feel-  
ing of "sisterhood" and affirmation  
prevailed.

Racism  
The question of racism was very  
much at issue during the conference  
by the very fact that all the women  
attending were white. Participants  
who felt the need to formally address  
the issue called a workshop, which  
drew about 30 women. The workshop  
started out with great potential for  
honestly dealing with our own individ-  
ual racism and how it is reflected in  
the women's movement at large.

One woman from Hera (Philadelphia)  
presented information on an eastern  
regional conference on racism, invol-  

collectives so as to avoid setting  
up any newspaper as the "vanguard"  
yet still contributing to dialogue  
on important issues. No definite  
conclusions were drawn but it was  
agreed that different types of news-  
papers do and can exist to fulfill  
different functions.

A great deal of discussion occur-  
red around the issue of the grounds  
on which a paper should accept or  
reject material. Some women felt  
feminist publications should print  
only articles they agree with or  
which they collectively feel  
“affirms their struggle." Others  
felt that articles that are confus-  
ing or difficult to understand  
should be the only rejected ones.

It was pointed out that the as-  
sumption often exists that a paper  
agrees with everything it prints  
whether that policy is stated some-  
where within the paper or not. Yet  
some papers wanted to exist as to-  
tally open forums, while others  
wanted to have their papers' views  
reflected in their pages.

Some women said their papers make  
a habit of printing controversial  
articles with commentary that re-  
flects the collective's opinion as  
a way of making a compromise be-  
tween these two sides of the issue.

Another part of this same discus-  

sion involved talk about rejection  
or inclusion and the editing of

living both Third World and white women.  
She said people at this conference  
broke into small groups and were  
asked to answer the following ques-  
tions with stereotypes: How do peo-  
ple of color view whites? How do  
whites view people of color? How do  
women view men? How do men view women?  
The woman said this was a diffi-  
cult exercise for many but that it al-  
lowed consciousness raising and edu-  
cation around the issues. They came  
to the conclusion that the ways in  
which the oppressor groups (whites,  
men) viewed the oppressed groups were  
not based in reality, whereas the  
views of the women and people of co-  
lor tended to be more accurate analysis.

Following this presentation, our  
own workshop chose not to act upon  
this method of exploring racism.  
Instead, our struggle turned more or  
less into a contest of who could  
prove they were the least racist. The  
group's atmosphere was generally hos-  
tile to those women who would try and  
honestly discuss their insecurities  
and problems on racial questions. Had  
we broken into small groups perhaps  
we would not have been afraid to look  
closely at our own racism.

One blatant example of how we are  
not yet seriously dealing with racism  
occurred when women at the conference  
broke two national boycotts: non-un-  
ion head lettuce was provided for  
meal preparation and Coors beer was  
purchased and consumed. Both were  
unnecessary and showed we, as politi-  
cal feminists, still have a ways to  
go in developing our political con-  
sciousness.

Camp Concludes

Saturday night, the conference came  
to a close. When one group attempted  
to raise discussion around conference  
issues it felt important, most women  
objected and wanted to celebrate the  
ending of the conference as planned--  
with a party of song, skits and cele-  
bration. The feelings most women  
held for each other can best be sum-  
med up by a song a woman had learned  
as a Camp Fire Girl many years before.  
Women joined hands and sang, “I want  
to be a friend of yours, hum and a  
little bit more. I want to be a part  
of yours, hum and a little bit more.  
I want to be a prairie flower growing  
round your door. I want to give you  
all I've got, hum and a little bit,  
hum and a little bit, hum and a little  
bit more."

(Plans are in the making to publish  
a book from notes that were taken at  
individual conference workshops. Left  

over conference monies will go to fi-  
nancing its printing and publication  
and it will be made available at fem-  
inist bookstores across the country.)

The  

Very Important  
Question of  

Life Insurance

In today’s world no woman need  
settle for weak, ineffective financial  
planning. Developing financial  
independence and estate security for the  
future is as important for women as it is  
for men. Your Fidelity Union Life Field  
Associate knows that and can help you  
achieve a CollegeMaster® or other  
program which will meet your needs now  
and in the future.
