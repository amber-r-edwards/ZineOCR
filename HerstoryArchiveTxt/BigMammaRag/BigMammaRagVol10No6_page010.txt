Sisters Reach Out To Those In And Out  

Dear Sisters:  

Hope this reaches you in  
time! for the prison issue.  
I'm enclosing the booklet  
“Writing for Rights: Voices  
from Behind Prison Walls"  

survival  

that we compiled last year  
and completed this year. We  
originally had put out the  
word that we wanted to do a  
newsletter that would come  
out every few months. But so  
much came pouring in from  
sisters, articles, poetry and  
artwork, that we didn't want  
to leave anything out so we  
did the book instead. It took  
us several months to put to-  
gether, about six months to  
get it printed, then collat-  
ing 300 copies, so we are lo-  
ng overdue in getting it to  
all the sisters and brothers  
inside who asked for it. We  
want to thank everyone who  
wrote to us with all the po-  
wer, truth, support and love  
that keeps us going. Sisters  
of Inner-Connections was sta-  
rted by Sister Moving Cloud  
while she was in prison in  
Muncy, PA. She came home on  
Jan. 9 of '81 and we got to  
work on the book. We put out  
a letter in as many papers as  
possible to let people know  
we wanted to start actively  
hooking up people inside and  
outside for our survival and  
growth. Last year we focused  
on doing a lot of educational  
work in the Philadelphia ar-  
ea. Moving Cloud started a  
street vendor business, one  
of the few sisters in a most-  
ly male business here in Phi-  
lly. We set up the stand in  
communities all over the ci-  
ty, raising money for our wo-  
rk and wrote up literature on  
the prison struggle and es-  
pecially what is going on wi-  
th sisters. We passed this  
out on the stands and on the  
streets, buses, subway, any-  
where where we could rap with  
people. We want to start ho-  
oking up a way where we can  
sell work by women inside on  
the vendor stand, we know th-  
at there is a lot of beauti-  
ful craft and art, that way  
we could make some money for  
sisters inside to have and it  
would be a very effective way  
to raise people's awareness  
about sisters and prison. We  
want to do all we can to make  

the connections between wha-  
t's happening out here and  
what's happening behind the  
walls. We want to help get a  
support network started to  
break down the walls of sil-  
ence and invisibility around  
sisters. We want people to  
understand what is really go-  
ing on in the Kamps and work  
to oppose the divide and con-  
quer tactics that separate  
us. Last summer Moving Cloud  
went into the House of Cor-  
rections and had rap sessions  
with the sisters, this is  
something we want to get go-  
ing again. We'd like to get  

a house together that could  
be a support center for sis-  
ters coming out and where we  
could share survival infor-  
mation and share ways to un-  
derstand and fight against  
what is keeping us down.  
We've talked with groups in  
the community, such as drug  
centers, tenant's rights, Th-  
ird World political organiza-  
tions, women's groups, about  
being part of a support net-  
work. We could teach sisters  
what we've learned about st-  
arting a business of self-  
sufficiency on the vendor st-  
and, and what we've learned  
about using money to make mo-  
ney...information which has  
been denied those of us who  
never had much of it. We want  
Sisters of Inner Connections  
to be by and about women who  
have been through the system,  
those are the only "professi-  
onals" we want to be about.  
We want to keep in contact  
with sisters inside the walls  
with their ideas for directi-  
ons we should be moving towa-  
rds. We want to keep getting  

information flowing about our —  

mutual struggles. We put on a  
benefit last fall and it was  
real powerful. Sisters that  
Moving Cloud had not seen si-  
nce she was in prison, who  
had been inside with her, we-  
re there and spoke about th-  
eir lives and visions, and  
gave us beautiful music of  
blues, gospel and power. Mo-  
ving Cloud's mother and women  
from her church, and her sis-  
ter and young niece prepared  
a feast of food...chicken,  
potato salad, sweet potato  
pie, I mean we got down! We  
showed the film "Inside Wo-  
men Inside" and several peo-  
ple gave solidarity messages,  
such as from the American in-  
dian struggle, battered wo-  
men, grand jury abuse. Mostly  

women talked about our lives  
and about unifying. The even-  
ing ended with Moving Cloud's  
mother, a powerful apostolic  
woman, giving a blessing and  
joining us all in a circle to  
sing “You'll Never Walk Al-  
one". We've continued to do  
workshops at any event we can,  
such as International Women's  
Day, and we've traveled to  
conferences in other cities  
to tell the word about sisters  
behind the walls. There's so  
much we can see to do, and we  
will just keep coming together  
any and every way we can. We  
don't have any trouble getting  

Artist Unknown/Matrix  

support from people of color  
and low-income communities,  
almost all the help we have  
received is from people whose  
lives are the struggle. We  
still haven't been able to  
reach many women in feminist  
and lesbian communities. Over  
and over again we have felt  
the sting of rejection, the  
barbs of classism and racism  
from women who identify with  
the struggle of women, yet  
consistently remain untouched  
by the message of women who  
bear the brunt of the system's  
violence. For the most part  
our activities have been un-  
attended by women in these co-  
mmunities, and when we appro-  
ach them we are sick of being  
asked to write up a "proposal"  
of what we have to offer them.  
So at present our collective  

is two people--inspired by the  
spiritual and revolutionary  
force of Moving Cloud, and the  
sisters inside. I am a white  
working class woman. I have  
not been in prison, but I have  
been in the man's "mental pri-  
sons" hospitals and I am an  
incest survivor, which gave  
me quite a bit of experience  
in the "juvenile justice" de-  
partment, incarcerated for my  
oppression. We don't label  
ourselves in any one way pol-  
itically--we are about strug-  
gle for unity and growth in  
harmony with the natural for-  
ces and oppose what we feel to  
be non-conducive to life--the  
forces of imperialism, racism,  
classism, power-hunger, sex-  
ism, homophobia, capitalism,  
genocide--all forces of death  
culture opposing the life for-  
ce of the planet and freedom.  
Our sisters inside are being  
beaten, raped, drugged, ster-  
ilized, mind-fucked and bat-  
tered in every way, mentally,  
physically, emotionally, spi-  
ritually and psychically. Our  
sisters are screaming. There  
is no “creeping trend towards  
fascism", women and men are  
dying now, the kamps are here  
now. We must unite in commit-  
ted action now.  

we want to let anyone who  
wrote to us for the newslet-  
ter who did not receive a re-  
ply know that we are still  
here. We vastly underestimat-  
ed the time it would take to  
publish the book, so that si-  
sters inside who requested it  
may have been transferred or  
released. We certainly know  
that shuttling people around  
is one of the strategies to  
keep us isolated from one an-  
other and unable to know what  
is happening. Also, we still  
have very little money for  
postage. We want the book to  
go free to people inside, and  
ask people outside to send  
$2.50 to receive a copy. We  
urgently need donations for  
postage so that we can keep  
in contact and get the power-  
ful words in the book heard  
and shared. We have received  
some donations for which we  
offer thanks, but most of our  
costs come from our pockets  
and it is not even close en-  
ough. We're lucky to make $20  
standing at a literature tab-  
le all day, watching women be  
more willing to pay $15 for a  
feminist silver necklace or
