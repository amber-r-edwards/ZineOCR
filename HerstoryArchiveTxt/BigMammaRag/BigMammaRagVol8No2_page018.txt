Feminism And The Draft  

From Page 1  

The possibility of women being  
drafted and serving in combat has  
been sensationalized by the media  
and used to further divide both the  
women's movement and the country.  
Conservatives have spoken out against  
women being drafted; Liberals have  
been divided. While some have spoken  
out in favor of women being drafted,  
others find themselves totally opposed  
to the draft. Other liberals are in  
the ambiguous position of being both  
against the draft as a whole, but  
have adopted an attitude of "if-there-  
is-a-draft-women-better-be-equal ly-  
involved." Radicals have no choice  
but to totally oppose the draft.  
Pacifists and humanitarian groups  
also oppose the draft, but underplay  
the importance of racism and classism  
and see the draft as only a simple  
issue. They encourage people to file  
for a CO status.  

There has clearly been a split in  
the women's movement between liberal  
and radical feminists. While members  
of the National Organization for  
Women (NOW) are pushing for women  
to be a part of the draft, other fem-  
inists are strongly committed to total  
opposition to the draft. Pacifist  
feminists are joining broad-based  
groups doing outreach around ways of  
getting CO status and organizing in  
broad-based coalitions around ways  
of evading and protesting against the  
draft. The American Civil Liberties  
Union (ACLU) has threatened to sue  
the government if men are drafted  
and women aren't. Liberal feminists  
have argued that they won’t be draft-  
ed until the Equal Rights Amendment  
(ERA) is passed, while others say "let  
them draft us and then they will have  
to pass the ERA."  

Legally, the ERA has no effect on  
whether or not women can be drafted.  
The legislature would have to pass a  
bill specifically calling for women to  
be drafted. Even if such a bill were  
passed, there are other laws prohibit-  
ing women from being in combat. The  
word "combat" is very loosely defined  
and would most likely be interpreted  
to keep military women in supportive  
(sex-typical) roles away from any  
actual fighting. But that is not the  

Russian Roulette

not those who are oppressed who are  
creating division, but those who are  
the oppressors. The notion that wo-  
men must wait for complete freedom  
until after the revolution is bank-  
rupt. Socialist men have reneged  
on their debts too many times.  

--we must oppose the idea that it  
is cultural imperialism for western  
women to say that non-western women  
are oppressed by the men of their own  
class. This accusation is based on  
the belief that women have different  
potentials, wants, and needs than  
“other people” (men). So what  
"seems” oppressed might not really  
be oppressed. This is pure bullshit.  
It's the same as men saying that women  
really like being verbally harassed.  
If a man wants to do something ob-  
viously awful to a woman, he will  
usually justify it to himself and the  
world by saying that she really loves  
it.  

Anything that is oppressive to a  
human being is oppressive to a woman.  
We are not masochists who want to  
wear uncomfortable clothes and be  
illiterate. Any time a person's  
human potential is thwarted, whether  
it be by economics or patriarchy,  
that person is oppressed, regardless  
of their sex. To believe otherwise  
is to deny women's potential. Saying  

that woman is oppressed is the same  
as saying that a man is; all the  
same standards apply and culture  
doesn't have a single thing to do  
with it.  

The point is that women are  
not likely to be drafted and the sen-  
sationalist portrayal of women in  
combat is not a real issue. By over-  
playing the question of whether or  
not women will or should be drafted  
the major question of whether or not  
there should be a draft at all has  
far too often been overlooked. This  
can be seen as a divisive tactic by  
capitalists in charge to pass the  
draft and dilute the women's move-  
ment.  

We must totally oppose the draft,  
but must also be careful not to let  
our opposition to the draft cause us  
to put aside or compromise on real  
feminist issues and projects. By  
concentrating our outreach around the  
singular issue of opposing the draft,  
we find ourselves aligned with people  
who might otherwise be seen as enemies.  
Do we march with the moralist who is  
not only morally opposed to war, but  
also is morally opposed to abortion  
or homosexuality or women's rights?  
As radicals, can we align ourselves  
with pacifists who could in no way  
support revolutionary armed struggle?  
Do we work with and for the white  
leftist male who is sexist and offers  
a racist/classist solution? Do we  
align ourselves with alternative pol-  
itical groups who would repeal all rape  
laws or ones who consider homosexuality  
a "symptom of bourgeoisie decadence?"  
Reformism will not be our salvation.  
Radicals must, whenever possible,  
push our position around the draft  
and acknowledge the classist and  
racist options as being merely liber-  
al and reformist. We must also real-  
ize that the question of drafting  
women is a false issue that is un-  
related to the passage of the ERA.  

We must continue our fight against  
racism, classism, and sexism wher-  
ever we find them. We must not let  
ourselves be distracted. We must  
not compromise.

officer of the same sex as the ac-  
cused. In addition, a search warrant  
or written permission of a superior  
must be obtained if they are to exam-  
ine any body cavity other than the  
mouth.  

Colorado has no state law applying  
to the strip search of women under  
arrest, leaving that policy up to  
individual police departments.  

The Thornton Police Department  
claims that their strip search policy  
is not “routine." The strip search  
policy was instituted last November by  
Lt. Ron Straken who told officers to  
strip search anyone who was going to  
be jailed. However, according to a  
police spokesman, “It isn't enforced  
95% of the time. The apparent excep-  
tion is when the person in custody is  
a woman.  

The Thornton Police Department has  
admitted no wrongdoing in its hand-  
ling of Mildred Gibbs' arrest and sub-  
sequent strip-search. They dispute  
that a male officer looked on. How-  
ever, they have since announced an  
end to strip-searches where arrested  
persons are not suspected of carrying  
drugs or weapons and issued an apology  
to Gibbs saying they sincerely regret  
the incident. Regret they must as  
Gibbs said in response to the apology,  
"I can promise you that this won't be  
the end of it. I'm going to take this  
as far as it will go. I'll do any-  
thing and everything to let the public  
know the truth, no matter how humili-  
ating.”

What about women with children?  
Children have shot each other and  
themselves with their parents' guns.  
Even in a matriarchal household  
children will be exposed at some  
point to the gun glorification  
on T.V. and in the movies. I can on-  
ly say how it works for me and my  
nine-year-old daughter. She has  
always had access to the whole house  
and everything in it. The few things  

you everywhere and you realize that  
FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE YOU ARE NOT  
AFRAID--not when you sleep at night,  
not when you take a walk alone in  
the woods, not when you go to the  
corner store--then you almost begin  
to like that the male death machine  
which will protect your female  

life. Then it's not so weird to get  
excited about learning to shoot  
well-- and it's a real skill. And you  

vulnerable Res 10S  

I do keep off-limits, therefore, are  
pretty well-respected by her. I  
think if we raise our children as  
responsible, intelligent smaller  
people, and consistently treat them  
that way, we can reason with them  
about anything. Every parent-child  
relationship is different and the  
decision on what to tell your chil-  
dren about guns is best gauged by  
you. My daughter and I are in many  
ways partners. I have decided to  
let her know I have a gun. To let  
her become familiar with it, unloaded,  
of course. And to leave the option  
open to her about when and if she  
wants to learn how to use it. When  
she expresses the desire to me to  
learn more about guns, I feel real  
good about taking her out to a range  
and teaching her how to use it. She  
might be able to save my life some-  
day. She might be able to save her  
own. I am not advising all women to  
do it this way. You know your chil-  
dren best. This is just my way of  
dealing with a gun in the house.

never know what fear you've been  
living in until it's gone  

The first difficulty in obtaining  
gun consciousness is that most wo-  
men are taught that guns are out of  
their realm of reality -- like high  
paying jobs and self-respect. And  
that is part of the male propaganda-  
that women be afraid of guns -- be-  
cause men are afraid of women and  
a woman with a gun in her hand is  
indeed a wonderful fright.  

Until the last couple of decades  
(and still in most rural areas today)  
guns were as natural a part of  
someone's life as a screwdriver or  
a can opener. Everyone had one and  
knew how to use one, including many  
women. Guns were used for protec-  
tion and to get food. Once you get  
past the psychological hurdle of  
getting a gun, in most places you  
can walk into a store, order a gun,  
wait the legal length of time, and  
go home with a gun of your own --  

a gun of one's own.
