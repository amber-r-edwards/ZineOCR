California Prisoners To Be Denied Basic Rights

Big Mama Rag,

We have written 2 articles
(mailed to you & other sympa-
thetic publications) concern-
ing the issues you stated you
were interested in for your
May issue--apparently they
never left the institution,
nor have attorneys concerned
in several issues here been
allowed to visit although that
is a legal right.

There are so many issues,
so many outrageous injustices

and harassment in the whole
political system of CDC poli-
cies and treatments. We are
the legislature's guinea pigs,
society's outcasts & copouts
for their own failures & the
administration's key to power

& success.

I am enclosing a new memo-
randum being slowly initiated
in the prisons in California.
It in effect will deny 80% of
the prison population of their
basic rights under the guise
of privileges. We thought

Subject Standardization of Inmate

Work/Training Program Incentives

From: Department of Correction, Sacramento, Ca. 95814

Pursuant to the discussions and decisions regarding the
policy and principles agreed upon at the warden's and
Superintendents meeting on Nov. 24th, 1981 the following
standards are established as official policy for the

Department of Corrections.

Goals and objectives of the Department of Corrections are
that every able-bodied inmate will be required to parti-
cipate in a work or training program assignment for a
minimum of 8 hours per day on a 5 day per week basis.

To encourage continued inmate participation, a graduated
system of privileges is also being established. Considering
present institutional schedules, an inmate must
participate in a work/training program for a minimum of
3 hours per day, exclusive of meals, in order to be

thread throughout U.S. his-
tory. As far back as the be-
ginning of the century, pro-
grams to limit the fertility
of "undesirables" have been
popular with policy makers.
The eugenics movement in the
U.S. culminated in eugenic
sterilization laws in 30
states and Puerto Rico. These
laws covered the "feeblemind-
ed" (usually determined by
prejudicial IQ tests), alco-
holics, "insane", epileptics,
criminals and poor people.
Marginalized and in any way
anti-social individuals could
potentially fall victim to
these laws. The unemployed,
those who did not conform to
strict sexual norms, and im-
migrants were among those
sterilized under eugenics
laws. We must become familiar
with this part of our history.

you might find it interesting
& amusing if the irony is
apparent to you. This has not
been passed down to us "yet".
It is to be a surprise.

With the article enclosed
as well as fragments of our
existing rules (the ones we're
allowed to see) this memo
will help shed light on the
hypocrisy in the administra-
tion & its reasonings.
Remember in California basi-
cally we have one women's state
prison therefore most policies

are written in lieu of the
men's prison conditions &
problems.

Now let's hope you receive
this and we hear from you
soon.

eligible for group A privileges, and a minimum of 3 hours
to be eligible for B privileges.

All inmates will be assigned to one of four groups
identified as A, B, C, and D based on the following
criteria. Group identification/designation will be by

color-coded privilege cards.

Inmate designated by medical and psychiatric staff as
being incapable of participating in a full work/program
assignment will be eligible to receive privileges as

may be designated by institution classification committee.
Privileges as may be documented on CDC 128-G classifica-

tion chrono.

Primary purposes of this procedure are to:

BE
participation.

Reduce inmate idleness.

Provide incentives for productive work and program

Reduce institutional problems.

- Promote work ethic.

Cost avoidance will be realized through utilization

of inmate labor.

Some of the practices are be-
hind us, and Nazi eugenics
discredited much of the
rhetoric, but many of the
ideas have firmly rooted in
American culture. We see
them re-emerging in the form
of Sociobiology, Reagan's
culling of the "deserving" and
the "undeserving" poor and
research studies on the gen-
etic inferiority of women and
blacks, to name a few.

We must attack these con-
cepts wherever we find them--
whether it be a sister defend-
ing abortion rights by saying,
it's cheaper for a welfare
abortion than a welfare baby,
or William Shockley espousing
a program to sterilize wel-
fare mothers.

The slideshow and education-
al highlight some crucial
questions for feminists:

1) Who spearheads efforts
to limit population growth?
Where? Why? By what right?

2) Who are the targeted
populations and what charac-
teristics do they share?

3) What alternatives should
be available to the indivi-
dual in order to make choice
in childbearing a reality?

It also provides us with
tools to understand, identify,
and denounce eugenic and pop-
ulation control ideas and
practices. The future promises
a resurgence of these ideas
in growing trends to intervene
abroad and to cut off the
poor domestically.--As femi-
nists we have to begin to
educate ourselves and others
on the critical difference
between birth control and
population control.
