“FAULTLINE is a family narrative done to a
brilliant surreal turn. An American standup comic
masterpiece sired by Buster Keaton out of
Gertrude Stein, born on the San Andreas fault and
danced on the ceiling by a Black Fred Astaire.
How otherwise can you talk about the adventures
of a Lesbian mother with six children, three
hundred rabbits and a very relaxed attitude?
A laugh out of life at last.”
