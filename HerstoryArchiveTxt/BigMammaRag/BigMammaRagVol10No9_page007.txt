Activist Murdered

Ruth First, a leading mili-
tant of the Afrikan National
Congress and a long-time acti-
vist in the struggle against
the US-backed Apartheid regime
in So. Africa, was killed by a
parcel bomb Aug. 17 in Maputo,
Mozambique. The bomb came in
an envelope mailed from Wash.
D.C. which bore the return ad-
dress of the African Bibliogra-
phy Center, distributed widely
to "Black intellectuals".

It is widely felt that the
So. African secret police
would never have dared to put
this bomb in an envelope sent
from Wash. D.C., under a group
name whose major source of
funding is the US government,
without the express permission
of the CIA. US Imperialism
supports and profits from So.
African apartheid. The evi-
dence around the First murder
indicates that the US also
actively participates in its

campaign to kill its opponents.

New System Needed

600 women are on strike at
American Cyanamid. One striker
states: I never thought when
I came to the US as a Hungar-
ian refugee, that I'd see the
type of union busting as is
going on now. They're as bad
as any Stalinists. Reagan and
his men just hate labor. Rus-
sian-type Communism and our
English-type Capitalism are
the same thing. In America it
was first built up with a
slave system and it seems cap-
ital never got over that--

. they're still looking for that
slave labor again. The human
race has got to come up with
something different from these
two systems, capitalism/com-
munism.

United Way Is Not

Just as Reagan is launching
his media campaign for volun-
teerism, Reagan appointees
pervert the fundamental pur-
poses of the United Way Cam-
paign. The National Right-To-
Work (for less) Legal Defense
and Educational Foundation is
eligible to share in funds
from United Way.

The Legal Defense Foundation
is a labor-hating, union bust-
ing conspiracy backed by big
business and subsidized by
corporations. It exists for
the sole purpose of financing,
managing and participating in
lawsuits seeking to limit or
destroy union security agree-
ments and otherwise weaken
unions.

Jesus Says Shut-Up

A Colorado woman who defend-
ed sex education at a parent's
meeting has since received
personal threats such as: "Get
smart or get hurt. The lord
has spoken."

Women Not Real

Coca-Cola spokesman Edward
O'Reilly explains the different women leaders of
markets for the company's two
diet drinks: The new diet Coke
is for real people; Tab is aim-
ed at women.

Artist Unknown -

Pageant Protested

Two of twenty women in Peru
who were protesting the Miss
Universe pageant were arrest-
ed and brutally beaten as they
refused to get into a patrol
car. Leaflets distributed at
the protest pointed out that
"with beauty contests you don't
hide poverty," and "the money
spent in the contest should
have been invested in the ac-
quisition of equipment for the
maternity of Lima." The police
were not able to silence the
protests since all along the
course to the Plaza de Armas
a great number of leaflets
were thrown.

Sick Of Spray

When telephonists at the
Hampstead, UK Telephone Excha-
nge complained of flea bites,
their office was sprayed with
insecticide. The women were
not allowed to leave the room.
That afternoon, one woman be-
came ill and began vomiting.
Admitted to the hospital three
days later with dehydration
and half a stone weight loss.
She was three months pregnant
at the time. A second woman
developed severe headaches
and blisters over her body.

Through the Looking Glass

Video Death

Fresh evidence from Canada
is fueling fears that the use
of office computers could be
linked to infant abnormalities.

The coalition for the Medical
Rights of Women has discovered
that six recent pregnancies
among office workers at a Van-
couver hospital have produced
only one healthy baby. All 6
mothers work at video display
terminals.

Fraser Re-instated

Clara Fraser has insisted
for seven years that she was
fired in 1975 from her job as
Education Coordinator at Seat-
tle City Light for her sex and
political beliefs, wins her
job back plus $100,000! Manage-
ment had suddenly fired her,
under the guise of a budget
cut, after she became a leader
in an employee walkout, the
workers' representative on a
negotiating committee, and a par-
ticipant in the recall cam-
paign against Mayor Uhlman.
As a socialist feminist, she
has now won a decisive round
in her test case of Seattle's
Fair Employment Practices Or-
dinance, which forbids ideo-
logical discrimination.

Out of Control

In Seoul, South Korea, six
of the remaining trade unions
in the country were sacked by Control
Data, a U.S. multinational el-
ectronics plant. Control Data
is known for using lay-offs
and rehiring at reduced compen-
sation to reduce costs.

Strike action occurred, women
protesting salary discrimina-
tion and dangerous conditions
at the worksite. The strike
ended with a 19.5% wage incre-
ase. The women who were fired
are still trying to be reinstated,
the workers are conducting a
go-slow and an occupation of
some parts of the plant by off-
duty workers. The company has
responded by literally trying
to freeze them out by turning
up the air-conditioning.

Feminist Alert

In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
women have formed an umbrella
group 'Feminist Alert for the
Elections' to expose anti-wo-
man platforms and pressure oth-
ers into recognizing a program
which includes the legalization
of abortion and the right to
safe contraceptives as a choice
for all women (Brazil has had
various population control
programs where women have been
coerced into taking contracep-
tives and contraceptives for
the “western market" have been
tested on Brazilian women).
Also a reassessment of Brazil's
education policy to eliminate
racism and sexism, free creches
for all children under 6, and
an end to the law that makes a
husband's signature essential
for all business and commercial
agreements made by "his" wife.

Sugar Blues

A man who pleaded guilty to
beating his wife in Kansas
was "sentenced" to buy his wife
a box of sweets. What price the
murder of women?

Sex Addiction

The former director of a
federal education program has
been sentenced to nine months
in prison on misdemeanor sex
charges despite his claims
that he is mentally ill because
he is addicted to sexual gra-
tification. Lyon argued that
he should be placed on proba-
tion and allowed to perform
community service by working
in a nursing home. His addic-
tion to sex was supported by
testimony from his wife, his
ministers, and a psychiatrist.
