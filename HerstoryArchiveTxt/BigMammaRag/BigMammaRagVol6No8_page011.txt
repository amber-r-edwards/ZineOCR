On July 4th, 1978, one of the most  
important mobilizations to occur with-  
in the U.S. in the last several years  
took place in Plains, Georgia. It was  
an important mobilization because it  
was initiated by Black forces, clear  
evidence that the Black liberation  
movement, smashed during the 1960s  
by the infamous COINTEL program, is  
again assuming the leadership for its  
own direction. It was also impor-  
tant because it put forth, for the  
entire world to see, the hypocrisy of  
the U.S. government's attacks against  
socialist and "Third World" countries  
for so-called human rights violations.  
The July 4th mobilization to  
Plains was called by the National  
Committee to Defend Dessie Woods, an  
Atlanta, Georgia-based organization  
that was organized to defend Dessie  

Woods, a 32-year-old Black woman,  
who was found guilty of voluntary man-  
slaughter in connection with the  
death of a white man who attempted  
to rape Woods and another Black  
woman, Cheryl Todd, in June, 1975.  
Woods is currently serving a 12  
year sentence at the Georgia Women's  
Institute of Corrections. Supporters  
have charged that Woods did not re-  
ceive a fair trial and that she is  
being held in jail because she  
dared to resist a sexual assault  
by a white man.  

In a recent interview conducted  
by the Washington, D.C. Rape Crisis  
Center, Woods elaborated on this:  

"The whole trial was unjust.  

In the first place because it was  
proven from the beginning that the  
murder was self-defense. And be-  
cause I was a Black woman they  
brought me to prison. I had a  
chance not to come to prison be-  
cause they...turned me loose on  

The African People's  
Socialist Party is  
calling for support  
of the efforts of the  
National Committee.  
Contributions are  
requested to help  
community organizers  

in Georgia; and more

Dessie Woods case is

"...The United States government  
says that a Black woman does not  
have the right to self-defense."  

Although the support committee's  
request for a parade permit was  
turned down by Plains government  
officials, organizing for the  
march continued and supporters  
vowed to march anyway.  

At a recent meeting in New York  
City, Linda Leaks of the African  
People's Socialist Party and a mem-  
ber of NCDDW stated that the de-  
fense committee first was refused  
on grounds that it had not posted  
a $10,000 security bond demanded  
for the permit. Later, the commit-  
tee was told, Leaks said, that it  
could not hold a march in Plains  
because there is no public pro-  
perty there. According to Plains  
officials, all the property in  
the town is owned by the Carter  
family and two other people. The  
committee is appealing this issue  
in the Georgia courts.  

The African People's Socialist  
Party has been very excited about  
the possibilities of the Plains  
mobilization. Not only because of  
the reasons given above, but also  
because the African People's Soc-  
ialist Party has played a primary  
role in making it happen. Indeed,  
the National Committee to Defend  
Dessie Woods was organized by the  
African People's Socialist Party,  
and since Dessie Woods' arrest and  
imprisonment in 1975, the newspaper  

The Burning Spear has helped to  
make hers one of the best-known  
political cases in the U.S.A.

organizations as they see fit with no  
stipulations being put on the use of  
the monies by the committee.

Women’s Career Center:  
Just Another Game  

Phyllis Kadison  

The Denver Women's Career Center, a  
federally funded Manpower organiza-  
tion, advertises itself as an agency  
geared toward helping women find em-  
ployment suitable to their life's  
goals and values. 3/4 funded by Den-  
ver Manpower, the Women's Career  
Center serves many Title VI eligible  
women. (These are women who are deem-  
ed economically disadvantaged by  
federal guidelines and entitled to  
PSE jobs or manpower funded training.)  
The program at the Center consists of  
6 three-hour “counsel-teaching" ses-  

sions where a counselor-teacher moves  

you through the motions of "value-  
clarification and self-discovery".  
All this is done by filling out book-  
lets called "Self-Discovery for Life  
Planning" and through learning ses-  
sions. The class sessions are used  
for exercises such as listing charac-  
teristics of a good cook, or mountain  
climber, to discover skills applica-  
ble in all professions.  

When you complete these sessions,  
your homework booklets are evaluated  
by the counselor and you move on to a  
job developer. It all seems pretty  
smooth--discover what you really want  
and then learn ways to get that job--  
except for--just how the Center is  
really being run. Unfortunately,  
during the "life-self-discovery" ses-  
sions, that deal with emotions and  
values, the staff feels the partici-  
pating women really need to listen to  
the teacher rather than express emo-  
tions, especially raising those issues  
that challenge the philosophy of the  
Center.  

In a recent class the philosophy of  
women playing the game the way male  
corporate structure dictates was  
challenged and the Center staff re-  
sponded defensively that playing the  
game is a real option for women (them  
I assume). On another occasion a film  
that portrayed women trying to "get  
ahead" and how men view women's worth  

was shown. The examples given in the  
film were of women playing the male  
game and some getting ahead and some  
not. The question arose as to why it  
was necessary to view it and the lead-  
er responded that she knew it was a  
film laden with many sexist stereo-  
types and that she did not wish to  
discuss it further. The question still  
remains--why show a male-oriented  
film to women who are looking for  
jobs, when you are supposed to be in  
a supportive situation.  

During one session, a woman was  
told by the director "I don't think  
I want you back in my center" because  
the woman had previously expressed  
that she was offended by the sexism  
and challenged the methodology in  
programming women to accept tradition-  
al male arguments. Another woman  
challenged the director by saying  
that the Center is using women-oppress-  
ing-women tactics that are truly  
dangerous to our common cause. The  
director responded by saying to this  
group (that included many Manpower  
funded women) that "It seems to me  
that this group has a ‘gimme gimme’  
attitude, that the world owes you a  
living, and you deserve a Title VI  
job". This type of statement coming  
from someone funded to help Title VI  
women exposes the real attitude oper-  
ating within the Denver Women's  
Career Center.  

The Center, after five months of  
existence, appears to be but another  
government funded game masquerading  
as a genuine attempt to help all wo-  
men. With no minority women represen-  
tation on the staff in this "sorority  
atmosphere," one doubts that women un-  
like the staffers or those unwilling  
to accept their philosophy would feel  
comfortable in the program. Anyone  
interested in the Center should bypass  
the program and go directly to the  
well-documented job bank or to one of  
the job developers, as the other  
women staffers are patronizing to  
their own kind and uncomfortable deal-  
ing with "others".  

Sid King and Sexism  

Susanna Smith  

A sex discrimination suit has been  
filed against Sid King of Sid King's  
Crazy Horse Bar, a topless-bottomless  
Denver bar. Cynthia Logan was fired  
from her job as waitress at Sid King's  
because she is pregnant. The justifi-  
cation, according to Mr. King, was  
that she "didn't look good" and was  
"getting too big." Ms. Logan's state-  
ment to the media (handed out at her  
Aug. 7 press conference) says,  

"What constitutes beauty and sex  
appeal is a subjective matter. Cus-  
tomer preference and/or Mr. King's  
personal preference will not justify  
sex discrimination. Furthermore,  
firing for pregnancy where it is not  
necessary for health reasons consti-  
tutes sex discrimination. My doctor  
has assured me that there is no med-  
ical reason why I could not continue  
to work throughout my pregnancy."  

Ms. Logan had two persons speak in  
her behalf at her press conference  
outside of Sid King's bar. According  
to Rev. Arhart of the Metropolitan  
Community Church of the Rockies, a  
number of men find pregnant women sex-  
ually attractive. He supports Ms. Lo-  
gan because her firing is “a clear  
violation of her rights as a woman.”  

Karen Peterson linked discrimination  
against women to discrimination again-  
st gays, lesbians, and minorities, say-  
ing, "We are being denied our complete  
rights as human beings."  

Mr. King came out of his bar to  
speak to the media. He stated that  
he had not fired Ms. Logan, but told  
her to "take it easy" until after the  
baby was born. He was afraid she might  
trip and fall at work or get hit in  
the stomach. (Is hitting people in the  
stomach a common practice at Sid King's?)  

Ms. Logan is scheduled for an Ex-  
pedited Resolution Conference on Sept.  
18. She is requesting wages and tips  
lost, and reinstatement without loss  
of seniority and benefits.  

When questioned as to her marriage  
status, and whether her husband would  
help her with her suit, Ms. Logan  
replied that this was not pertinent.  
"All women have the right to work when  
they are pregnant, married or not,”  
she stated.  

"My struggle is not my struggle  
alone - but the struggle of all women  
as a class to have the right to work  
when we are pregnant."
