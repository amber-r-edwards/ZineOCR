Catch the minutes,  
collect the sunshine— eee roi reason, oer.  
the fun, the laughter, that I was up So early,  
catch it all: CHIANG-MAI was to take a shower, prepare  

Close your eyes,  

run through the fields with me.  

Feel the cool wet grass beneath our feet.  
Feel the heat of the sun.  

Try to remember the blue skies of early afternoon.  
Watch the sunset and wish you were an artist,  
dashing your brush across your canvas,  

capturing the greys, pinks and oranges.  

REMEMBER a _ love—  

her smile,  

her kind eyes,  

her warm soft hands.  

She held you against her breast.  

She winked and you thought your every bit of being  
would burst with happiness.  

Reach out with me,  

Really try to touch.  

You weren’t meant to touch it all  

but believe you can and you may.  

Get out of yourself now and share your happiness.  
Share your love  

2 your wealth.  

Believe in your sister.  

Give her hours of relief from pain, from worry.  
Give her love—understand.  

Touch her heart with all your caring,  

touch her mind with yours,  

Touch her soft body and be ever so gentle.  
Touch her -  

bring her face a smile in the morning sunlight.  

Touch her and hold her in the darkness of late night,  

her sweet breath will sigh before sleep comes.  
You'll feel her body come to a calm  
and you'll feel peace in your arms  

Sleep now Z  
be there again tomorrow,  

REALLY BE THERE ~-’.  
SHE'LL KNOW.

Fourteen hours  

And Burma-close  
Knapsacked  

backs  

From the Chao Phya  
by Jeep  

by elephant  

by hope  

And dream-come-true  
we were  
garuda-carried  

up three hundred  

red gold dragon steps  
blessed  

by the smiley eyed  
yellowed  
orange-robed  

monk  

underneath a bo tree  
the place of buddha’s birth  
a lithe Thai said,  

One wish  

to buddha  

on stone-chapped knees  
two cents per wish  
and mine a dollar  

just to be sure  
Siddhartha means  
every wish fulfilled  
One wish to gold-leafed  
Siddhartha  

One love wish  

for you and me  

and fourteen hours  
down  

to Bangkok.  

A postcard  

from you now  

and then  
Remembering,  
Laughing, when  

we were eagle-carried  
to a dream.  

There,  
And back again.  

Jeremy  

my body for the daily sacrifice;  

they pay me to sit at a desk  

for eight hours — food  

for hungry birds who pick  

me clean by five.  

So usually I don't crawl out  

until after sunrise, thickly protected  

with sleep like a cheap coat  

that unravels slowly as I dance  

on top of my brown, wooden  

desk and perform all kinds of marvelous feats for money.  
By five, I'm a bloodshot parody of myself.  
But, as I said, I rose early  

and turned on the radio — music  
morning jazz a woman's  

voice something about  

a sunrise and I opened my door  

and there was rose grey  

yellow blue  

thank you. —Jeanne Winer  

OUR MOTHERS—OURSELVES  

Last night I dreamed my mother stomped my guts into the floor  
With raging Army feet all cast in silver spurs and I threw up and  
over over everything I lay there waiting to be tramped again  
into the floor  

she only looked at me—the silver shining from her eyes  
gleaming Army boots inside  

When I was young she always listened  

fed herself into her young  

and never made a sparrow of a noise  

We tramped her in the living room  

Marched upon her in the garden, buried her with tulip bulbs,  
We pushed her down the stairs  

and stuffed her in the kitchen sink to drown.  

One time she came around  

brandishing a chair into our faces upside down  

A Lion Tamer pacing round and round  

jabbing at the air and stomping  

Stomping up and down until she cried  

she cried/ran down/slumped down upon the hardwood floor  
Last night I dreamed my mother stomped my guts into the floor  
The silver tears ran down her eyes  

Until I couldn't see her anymore/no more/ ‘  

no more...
