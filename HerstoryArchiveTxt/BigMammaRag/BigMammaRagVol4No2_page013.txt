Pray for the child who comes first  
Innocent, she does not know what awaits her  
She must be strong  
for the wear and tear of being  
broken down constantly.  
She bears a strength no other knows  
a sadness no one sees  
a hurt no one hears of  
She cries inside knowing  
there is an understanding,  
a love,  
a peace somewhere  
And it will be hers  
for she came first

September  

some afternoons  

the quiet is just too much.  
I echo inside myself, a small tiny  
pain;  

restless, waiting in my small-town chair,  
concentrating.  

quiet, the silence of the large blue sky,  
breezy, almost fall and no longer  
summer,  

shoveling imaginary snows  

thinking of the future  

the quiet, peaceful, slow pace of the  
end of summer, the lethargic days, too-cool  
nights, indicating winter.  

apple trees, fat and wormy red and green  
balls and ovals,  

the last of the hot afternoons,  

the smell of applesauce and jam  

and stewed tomatoes:  

preparations.  

how long did the summer last this year —  
was it as short as I remember?  

the frost came in August.  

and my zucchini died  

my bush beans wilted  

my hard-cultivated and prayed-over tomatoes  
rotted on the vine;  

somehow it seems not fair, that  

all that work  

could be murdered in a  

night.  

and so it goes;  

I sit here, single, reflecting on  
the empty space that lays  

before me,  

a small constant ache translating  
loneliness into sensation  

sitting in my gut,  

perched on my front porch,  

part of the landscape of my life.

Learning  

At first, odd messages  
In the winter grass,  
In the worn and flattened sky.  
Just an absence of footprint,  
A shallow sniveling in lieu of wind.  

Mother, where are you?  
I have questions.  

She would hold me, glass parrot,  
In the warm nest of her mouth.  
I found my name incised in her palm  
And sang it to her in the wet, wet dark.  
And we were a scent of wings,  
A wakening to all earth-stirrings.  
Mother, you did not name me.  
Now I am lost.  

When she was gone I did not know,  

And lay believing in my blind cowl  

Like a buried river  

For months.  
Until spring with its lime-sweet breezes  
And never, never again her shadow  
On the pear-crisp grass.  

Mother, I must live here.  

And you have birthed me  
Unprepared.

galaxy  

red-hot points of fire  
laced into a background of  
inky, frigid depths  
bisected by icy winds fingering  
debris of various sorts  

the fires swell in size while dying,  

then shrink and become white-hot  

so hot  
that you fear to acknowledge them in me  
who's so passive and dull.  
the debris floats and flutters,  
sometimes crashing and  
busting into millions of tiny bits  
the depths neither accept nor reject  

think about it...  

my first week  

in finish  

I learned it is wrong  
for a woman  

to remain  

single  

lifestyle,  

but it is proper  
(often mandatory)  
that a woman  

marry  
to become fulfilled  

refusing  

in finishing school  
I continue singing,  
unmarred  

Nancy Brizendine  

neither rejoice nor cry  

hotly, heavily, the fires dwindle,  
becoming heavier and denser, insatiable,  
passionately sucking  
all the debris and shattered particles  
and the depths remain  
constant  
until the fires go out,  
leaving the force  

with nothing  

over which to exert its influence except  
the depths  
until there’s nothing left of me  
but vibrant, pulsating  
force,  

swallowing everything that comes near to me  
absorbing until there's nothing left  

after I left you  

the full moon rose and confronted me  
as though I might never see her again  
but I was stiff with grief  

I turned my back and walked home.  

I walked home, it took me an hour  

hoping you were asleep  

sullenly refusing to ask questions  
darkness, when it came, was uncommitted  
like someone passing through  

passing the station I heard a man  

in a seedy coat play the mouth-organ  
thin, sad music  

it wasn't until then that my heart broke  
(o sweet hour of mercy  

deliver us)  

Woodwoman  

in school  

to be finished  

and I am a universe  
laced into a background of  
inky, frigid depths  
bisected by icy winds

Moonmind  

we've all got moonmind  
you can see it  

in our raging eyes  

our tears reflect it  

we eat up the night  

and grow strong  

as the waxing mother  

and yet  

they call it madness  
lunatics they say  

lunatics one and all  

well I say yes  

yes we are luna tics  

luna tics lunatics  

let us reclaim the word as ours  
our heritage is  

of witches and lunatics  
birdwomen and mothers  
and lunacy is  

only moongenius  

so call us lunatics  

bathed in cackles and tears  
wails and joyous shouts  
we will eat your words  

and sing out our own  
lunatics luna tics one and all.
