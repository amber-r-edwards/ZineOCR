Something to think about,  
ponder if you will: recently a  
woman was offered a freelance  
position with an organization and a sum was quoted  
which sounded good at first.  
But after several contacts and  
some soul-searching, she  
negotiated with a representative  
that her knowledge was  
invaluable, but intangible. The  
final result was that she was  
paid three times the amount  
first offered when she confronted  
the organization for  
more money.  

Do we as women underestimate  
our value to the business  
structure? Would it help us to  
be more self-confident and  
self-assertive? What would it  
hurt? We can only be denied.

THURSDAY  

On July 1st of this year, a  
women’s retreat opened in a  
gorgeous cabin located on the  

response to our letter in  
the August issue of  

and the varied needs  
expressed by women who have  
already attended the first  
indicate the need for greater  
facilities that would be controlled  
and owned by women. A 23-acre site has been found  
in the Adirondack forest in  
upstate New York. The  
property includes a large main  
house, several cabins, a  
converted barn, and a large  
pond.  

Because of the diversity of  
the facilities, we see the  
possibility of meeting the  
needs of many different  
women; women with children;  
women who want to be  
alone; women interested in as  
much interaction with other  
women as possible; women  
who wish to visit for a long  
time or just a few days. Space  
could be utilized as work-  
shops, shops, a coffee house,  
a feminist library, for women’s  
art.  

What is needed to make it  
all work is energy in the form  
of women with skills to share,  
women willing to invest  
money and/or time. OUR  
NEED IS URGENT! If you can  
help please let us know.
