WAVPMN Plans  
Conference  

Women Against Violence in  
Pornography and Media is gearing up  
for the first National Feminist  
Conference on Pornography. The  
WAVPM-sponsored Conference, "Femin-  
ist Perspectives on Pornography", is  
set to take place in San Francisco  
during the weekend of Nov. 17-19,  
and will bring together feminist  
activists from across the country  
who are concerned about the miso-  
gynist message of pornography.  

This working conference will  
combine informational and strategy  
workshops, speeches and a panel dis-  
cussion on the issue of pornography  
and the First Amendment. The focus  
will be on deepening our feminist  
analysis of pornography and on dev-  
eloping strategies to fight it, and  
we hope that activism against porno-  
graphy will spring from the energies  
and information shared at the Con-  
ference. WAVPM is inviting feminists  
who are, or would like to be, organ-  
izing around the issue, as well as  
inviting women who are working on the  
effects of media violence against  
women via forms of victim advocacy  
(such as rape, child molestation,  
battered women and incest).  

Committed women such as Andrea  
Dworkin, Susan Brownmiller, Dr. Diana  
Russell, Kathy Barry, and Judith  
Reisman have already agreed to parti-  
cipate; clearly the Conference will  
provide an exciting opportunity for  

all of us to exchange ideas, research  

and strategies, and to formulate  
thoughtful and effective plans for  
actions. We expect 350 participants  
for the full 3-day Conference, and  

will encourage an additional 500 local  

women to join us for the panel dis-  
cussion, major speeches and a big  
"Take Back the Night" march and rally  
through San Francisco on Saturday.  

WOMEN AGAINST VIOLENCE IN

Cafeteria  
Justice  

In Milan recently, 400 young  
women stormed a local high school,  
punching teachers and staff as  
they broke into a classroom,  
dragged out an 18-year-old boy  
and shoved him into the cafeteria  
where he was put on trial for  
raping his girlfriend. When his  
male classmates broke into the  
cafeteria, the police were called  
to quell the riot.

Women Reclaim  
the Night in  
Boston March  

More than 2000 women marched  

through the streets of Boston on the  
night of Aug. 26 to protest violence  
against women and to “reclaim the  
night". Women came from all over  

New England including Western Mass.,  
the Merrimack Valley, Rhode Island,  
and the Boston Metro area. Three  
small buses of elderly women followed  
the march.  

Marching behind the lead banner  
"Women Unite, Reclaim the Night”,  
women raised their fists in anger  
and in solidarity, yelled and chanted  
slogans including “Power to the women,  
power to the women right on", "No  
more Rape", "Yes means yes, and no  
means no, however we dress, wherever  
we go".  

The march and rally was organized  
by the Coalition to Take Back the  
Night, made up of groups working  
around the issue of violence against  
women. Demands of the coalition in-  
cluded women-run community shelters  
for women, community action against  
violence, Medicaid funding for abor-  
tions, access to self-defense classes,  
decriminalization of prostitution,  
more street lighting and the right of  
women to control their own bodies.

Rape  

Compensation  

A federal appeals court ruled  
last month that a woman raped in a  
Philadelphia subway station may col-  
lect damages from the Southeastern  
Transportation Authority for failing  
to provide her with adequate  
protection.  

The woman, a 22-year-old Cin-  
naminson, New Jersey, secretary, said in  
an August 1976 federal court suit  

against SEPTA that she was raped in  
a poorly lit subway station.  

A jury awarded her $18,000  
damages, but the trial judge over-  
ruled the jury's verdict, finding  
that SEPTA “had no reason to anti-  
cipate the criminal conduct of the  
assailant".  

A three-judge panel of the U.S.  
3rd Circuit Court of Appeals found  
however, “the record reveals that  
crime on SEPTA's high-speed lines...  
had been on the rise. Although steps  
had been taken to increase police  
protection, we cannot say as a mat-  
ter of law that this was enough to  
preclude SEPTA's liability".  

The justices noted further that  
a "utility is required to exercise  
reasonable care" and provide protect  
tion for its patrons.

Folks, it's Big Mama's annual (semi-annual?) CRISIS. We've got one  
new collective member, but are losing two this month. Four women is simply  
not enough to put out a good newspaper, particularly with full-time jobs and  
therefore not unlimited time and energy. We need new collective members to  
We need office staff and someone to do distribution.  

We also need a question answered. Down here in the Gaylord basement, a

Seattle's  
Initiative 13  

On November 7 Seattle voters will  
be deciding whether "SEATTLE'S FAIR  
HOUSING AND OPEN HOUSING ORDINANCE  
PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION  
BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION." This  
initiative is part of a national anti-  
gay campaign that picks up momentum  
every time an anti-gay initiative is  
passed (Dade County, St. Paul, Wichi-  
ta and Eugene, Ore. in the past year).  
In Seattle, Initiative 13 also eli-  
minates the enforcement powers of the  
Office of Women's Rights. Complaints  
of discrimination on the basis of sex  
or marital status would be transferred  
to the Department of Human Rights.  
This department is already over-bur-  
dened with complaints of discrimina-  
tion against racial and other minor-  
ities. In Seattle, as elsewhere, the  
anti-gay campaign is closely coordinated  
with other right-wing attacks on  
women and minorities.  

Women Against Thirteen (WAT) has  
been organized to: 1) defeat Initia-  
tive 13, 2) educate the public about  
lesbian and gay oppression, 3) educate  
the public and the lesbian community  
about the connections between the various  
right-wing attacks, 4) provide  
political experience for women. WAT  
is women doing counter-leafletting,  
training speakers, speaking to groups,  
doing theater, sharing skills, doing  
workshops, doorbelling.  

The money raised and donations re-  
ceived are being used to meet the costs  
of the work. Campaign costs are high  
and your help is needed to stop these  
right-wing attacks on the rights of  
us. If you wish to help turn it  
around in Seattle, please send your  
contributions and requests for further

Hawaiian  

Groups Fight  

Back:  

Wilbur Moyd, a New Jersey marine  
who was charged with rape, assault  
with an automobile, sodomy and kid-  
napping last spring in a widely pub-  
licized pretrial hearing in Hawaii,  
has been convicted of most of the  
charges.  

Last March, a Honolulu grand jury  
reinstated a rape charge against Moyd  
who had allegedly raped and sodomized  
a woman after running her down with a  
car and threatening her with a broken  
bottle.  

The rape charge had been dropped  
the previous month by Honolulu Dis-  
trict Judge Robert Richardson who,  
after questioning the victim in open  
court, decided the woman had not  
fought back and therefore was not  
raped because no force was used.  

The grand jury, however, reconsid-  
ered the charge after over 700 women  
held a demonstration in Honolulu to  
protest Judge Richardson's decision.  
Moyd was convicted last week of sod-  
omy, kidnapping, assault and failure  
to render aid.  

Richardson has since been trans-  
ferred from his job as a criminal  
court judge and is now presiding over  
small claims court.  

Several Hawaii women's groups, two  
newspapers and a television station  
have signed a petition which is cur-  
rently before the state supreme court  
demanding an investigation into Judge  
Richardson's fitness to serve on the  
bench.

Big Mama Rag Vol. 6, No. 9  

Maryland  
Woman Freed  

A three-judge panel in Prince  
George's County, Maryland, has sus-  
pended the sentence of Barbara Jean  
Gilbert.  
Gilbert last month was sentenced  
to serve eight years in prison for the  
April 14, 1976, manslaughter of her  
husband.  
Gilbert shot and killed her hus-  
band after 17 years of marriage which  
was reportedly marked by violent  
fights and alleged infidelity by her  
husband.  
Last May, after four hours of  
deliberation, jurors found her guilty  
of involuntary manslaughter, the least  
serious offense of which they could  
convict her.  
A probation report then recom-  
mended that Gilbert be placed on pro-  
bation because of mitigating circum-  
stances leading to the murder and her  
exemplary behavior since. Recom-  
mendations of the parole and probation  
board are followed in more than 80%  
of the parole cases in Maryland.  

In spite of this, Judge  
Meloy pronounced the maximum sentence  
for her crime, saying that “the court  
has the right to inflict pain and  
deprivation" on her because she had  
snuffed out a life.  

The three-judge panel of two men  
and one woman, however, disagreed  
with Judge Meloy's sentence, and said  
that Gilbert should be freed.

Snuff Film  
Trial  

A Southern California man who  
was charged with plotting to make  
"snuff films" in which women would be  
tortured to death, has been placed on  
three years probation.  

Fred Barre Douglas was scheduled  
to stand trial a second time on charges  
of solicitation to commit murder.  

He was, however, allowed to plead no  
contest instead, to a charge of con-  
spiracy to commit assault with a deadly  
weapon.  

Douglas was arrested last year by  
two undercover policewomen after he  
allegedly drove with them and an in-  
formant to a shack in the desert near  
Jacumba Valley. The informant said the  
plan called for her, after the women  
were chained and tied, to torture the  
women to death while Douglas filmed  
the killings.  

Superior Court Judge Mason Fenton  
told the court he did not think any  
jury would be able to decide whether  
Douglas actually intended to murder  
the women. The first trial ended in  
a hung jury.

“Sex - 78”  

Women in Stockholm, Sweden, have  
gone to the police over a series of  
billboards which recently appeared  
in the city's subways.  

The billboards - sometimes as many  
as six in a single station - depict  
a set of breasts with the words  
"Sex-78" written above them.  

A Swedish girlie magazine posted  
them to plug an upcoming issue.  

A spokesperson for the local women's  
union, called Kvinnofront, (pronounced  
Kwin-o-front), said the mammoth  
bossoms are highly offensive to any  
woman who has to pass by them. She  
added that the sight of headless,  
armless and legless torsos was also  
likely to shock the tourists.  

A police spokesperson said, however,  
that a court would probably not find  
these bosomy billboards offensive  
enough to convict the magazine.
