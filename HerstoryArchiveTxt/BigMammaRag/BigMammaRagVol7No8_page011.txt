On Friday, July 27, artist Tee Co-
rinne presented a slide show of les-
bian sexual imagery to an audience of
women at St. Thomas Church in Denver.
She was well-received. I am question-
ing.

didactic

First of all, I could talk about
the variety of slides in Corinne's
collection. Clearly, she has kept
busy collecting and researching. Then
I should mention her historical re-
marks which neatly divided the work
into categories of art made by men
(dating back as far as Ancient
Greece!) and by women (mostly from the
last century). She resisted comment-
ing on what she called the "obvious
differences" between male sensibili-
ty and female sensitivity towards
the subjects - almost always two wo-
men engaged in some kind of sexual
activity. Unfortunately, I had a
difficult time remembering whose
work I was seeing; the differences in
content were not so clear, and I
have always prided myself in being
able to discern a rat, or a pig as
the case may be. There simply was
not enough discussion of where (save
the vital statistics) the image or-
iginated, nor enough analysis of
what messages about lesbian sexual-
ity that each work conveyed.

Next, I could look at Corinne's
art, her own contribution to a grow-
ing, and increasingly bland body of
art made by, and for lesbians. But
I think I will save that for later...
And finally, I would discuss her
"Sapphocentric Love Story," a cute,
educational slide show animation of
two rag dolls who "do it" with a
starry eye and pearly clitoris. But,
despite all these should's, could's
and would's, I can respond only to
what I remember most clearly about

Tee Corinne's presentation. And that
is Tee Corinne herself.

deliberate.

On Friday, July 27, self-proclaimed
sex-educator Tee Corinne presented
a basic how-to primer to a locker-
room full of giggling, post-pubescent
lesbians. She was well-received. I
am confounded.

Somewhere along the way to adult-
hood, I had forgotten about the
painful self-consciousness that sur-
rounds the whole issue of sexuality.
This is true even, and maybe espec-
ially for lesbians. I had also for-
gotten how people tend to respond
when they are surprised, uncomfort-
able, or both. Throughout the pre-
sentation, there was a lot of aud-
ience participation - and not nec-
essarily the kind that indicates
enjoyment and delight. Much of it
seemed nervous, appropriate only as
it played into Corinne's delivery.

And her delivery was deliberate.
Flip, playful, calculating, Corinne
managed to demystify lesbian sex-
uality by making it seem like so
much fun. And of course, it is fun;
but it is, or should be, more. After
a while, when I realized that every-
thing on the screen was just a varia-
tion on the theme of women doing
something to each other, I grew un-
comfortable too. It was easier to
giggle and squirm than to question
the content, or absence thereof, of
what we were seeing.

While Corinne spoke against the
gross and misleading inaccuracies
of the Joy of Lesbian Sex, a sex
manual for lesbian women put out
by Simon and Schuster last year,
she did not acknowledge the parallel
emptiness of most of her slides. We
as lesbians are real sexual beings
(even Corinne admitted that we don't
always have orgasms) with real, and
complex sexual identities, and we
don't need to have old stereotypes
reinforced, especially by someone
as informed as Corinne. Had she
really discussed the images with us,
and developed a feminist context in
so doing, chances are that we all
would have been more comfortable
with what we saw. And ultimately
with ourselves,

Living with Reality

Fran Day

Mom, the Wolf Man, and Me
Norma Klein

Avon Books

$1.50/paper, for ages 10-14

The "me" in Mom, the Wolf Man and
Me is Brett who likes living alone
with her unmarried mother. Then the
"wolf man" comes along and the poss-
ibility of change looms. Brett's
mother, a photographer, continues
to be candid and open with Brett.
Tee (the wolf man) and Brett be-
come good friends but she continues
to resist the possibility of mar-
riage. Her life is further com-
plicated by her Grandfather's hos-
pitalization and a suicide attempt
by a friend's mother.

Norma Klein has written a number
of excellent non-sexist books for
children of several age levels. Many
of her books are about divorce and
single parent homes, and the adapta-
bility required of children. Klein's
children are not separated from ad-
ult problems and relationships; they
live closely with adults who are
real people - frank and open about
their emotions. Her characterization
of Brett as an active, imaginative,
independent person is excellent.

Minoo's Family

Before We Are Six

$2.75/paper, for ages 4-8

Minoo gradually adjusts to her pa-

rents' separation. She realizes that
everyone is happier with Mommie and
Daddy living in separate homes. Al-
though she misses her father and
feels angry at times, she knows it
is better this way because her par-
ents do not shout and argue the
way they did before.

Ladybugs for Loretta

Lois Wickstrom

illustrated by Francie Mion
Sproing Press, Denver
$2.00/paper, for ages 6-9

Loretta is a mischievous girl who
lives with her parents in a cabin
high up in the Colorado mountains.
She enjoys gardening and studying
nature. She became intrigued by la-
dybugs one day when she discovered
some hiding under a rock. She gets
very involved with collecting
ladybugs for her garden. With Loretta
the reader learns all about the life
cycle and habits of ladybugs.

This book presents Loretta as a
lively, independent girl who has
no difficulty entertaining herself
even though no other children seem
to live nearby. Her relationship
with both parents is warm and car-
ing. Although at one point her
father is involved with harvesting
and canning, her mother bears the
responsibility for cooking, washing
dishes, etc. I think the book should
have shown Loretta's mother involved
in her own activities (outside the
kitchen!), and her father doing some
housework.

Lullin

On Friday, July 27, temptress Tee
Corinne seduced an entire audience
of willing women watchers. I am
still wondering.

Probably the most distressing
part of the evening was Corinne's
manner, which made me doubt whether
we were experiencing a presentation,
or a grand-scale flirtation. Her
voice, her sensuous sighs into the
microphone (indicating her own in-
volvement with certain slides), her
open invitation to go dancing after
the show - it was difficult to go
home (if you did not follow her to
the bar afterwards, of course) re-
membering much about the production
except for Tee Corinne's charm.

Half-way through the slides, I
remembered that I had intended to
interview her for BMR. At once, I
was intrigued, but afraid that I
would be tongue-tied. Or literally
seduced. By the last slide, I was
intent on escaping with my integrity
intact. The jokes bouncing through
the audience about Tee Corinne's
sexual prowess, about her great
skills at procuring a dyke at every
dock did not seem jokes after a
time. Initially, I was embarrassed,
both for her, and for my own gulli-
bility; later, I realized that every
woman there had been exploited.

People who seem to know a lot about
sexuality (presumably their own, and
certainly everyone else's), attract
persons who are curious and want to
know more themselves. "Sex educat-
ors" can develop an aura around them
and they probably fuel a lot of fan-
tasies. This is especially true if
they are also artists (or writers,
or musicians, or anyone) whose cre-
ative work is based in sexual image-
ry. In many ways, these people be-
come role models; and this can be
healthy if they are committed to
offering positive affirmation of
individual sexuality.

However, if "experts" play into
others' fears of being sexually ob-
jectified, their influence is neg-
ative. And in many ways, I see Tee
Corinne fitting into this latter
category. As women, each one of us
has had to cope with overt sexual
come-ons and subtle flirtations
all our lives. As artist Eleanor
Antin states, “We women have had e-
nough love. Frank O'Hara once said
that he loved Marilyn Monroe. Pro-
tect us from such love!" We also
need to protect ourselves from les-
bian sexism. Corinne's manner,
while being superficially flattering,
plays into our negative self-images
and is clearly intimidating. She
has made herself inaccessible by
maintaining her mystique and keeping
other women at a distance. At once,
she enjoys her role as a voyeur (she
repeated several times that she is
available to photograph other les-
bians doing...whatever), and she
regards her subjects as conquests.

invisible
All this brings up the whole
question of Corinne's taste in art.

“Determining what is erotic is a
highly personal and subjective pro-
cess for each of us. But to accept
everything that is sexually explicit
as being erotic is as self-effacing
as denying our own sexuality. We
need to move beyond objectification
by integrating our sexual feelings
into our lives. Only then can we
affirm ourselves as we are, not as
we are told to be.

There is a lot more to lesbian sex-
uality than bodies and genitals, but
Tee Corinne seemed consciously ob-
livious to this. As I mentioned be-
fore, her non-committal approach to
some really offensive imagery dis-
turbed me. Granted, we have few
examples of art in which we see les-
bian activity - but that does not
mean that Corinne cannot be critical
of what there is. This is especially
important for work by women. If we
don't judge ourselves, we will never
move beyond the established sexism
of the past (and lamentably the pre-
sent) to create a new, feminist aes-
thetic. Rather than leading her au-
dience to consider individual slides,
Tee Corinne contributed to a rather
wondrous atmosphere of, "Gee, isn't
this neat! Bet you never knew stuff
like this was around!”

In many ways, her own art is simi-
larly lacking. We cannot possibly
identify with the subjects of her
slick technical achievements, for she
has guaranteed their anonymity.

It is hopeless to try to make emo-
tional connections with women who
look like photographic negatives of
themselves. (See the Sinister Wis-
dom poster as an example). Corinne
spoke of her ambition to make a monu-
ment to lesbian sexuality - a kind
of women's Sistine Chapel - in which
the images, it seems to me, will be-
come even more stylized and inaccess-
ible.

There were also problems with the
white-healthy-mainstream models
throughout the whole presentation.
Corinne has made an attempt to break
through these stereotypes - but
her efforts are feeble at best, again
mostly because the women portrayed
do not become real. One is literally
a doll ("Sapphocentric Love Story"
features one Black and one White
character); and the other is a
physically disabled woman who appears
in one of Corinne's photo series.
Ironically, the process is better
suited to animating the wheelchair
than the woman in it.

Finally, there is the dilemma of
who Tee Corinne, both as an artist
and a sex-educator, is trying to
reach. She mentioned outreach to the
straight media, letting THEM know
that WE are here. I feel ripped-
off by that tactic, as if someone
(another lesbian at that!) is trying
to make my sexuality acceptable to
the outside world. Furthermore, I
would rather that images of lesbian
sexuality not be widely available
to the general populace which is
unlikely to be sensitive anyway.

My main concern is for us as
lesbian feminists, who as women
deserve access to rich, varied, and
above all, non-oppressive expressions
of our sexuality. There was little
feminist grounding evident in Cor-
inne's presentation - in her analy-
sis, in her own art, and certainly
not in her “come hither" approach.
We do not have to accept what is
handed to us just because there is
not much to be given at this time.
Instead, we have every right to ask
for something better.

Actually, that is not only a right.
It is a responsibility.
