Another Prison

Dear Big Mama Rag,

I sent this letter to
Plexus:

I want to respond to the
article by Charlotte Krause
Prozan on feminist therapy.
She claims that much of the
criticism of feminist ther-
apy comes from a place of
envy, ignorance, and mis-
directed anger. She also
claims that "suicide and
homicide...may be the risk
of not hospitalizing a
severely depressed or dan-
gerously psychotic person.”

First of all, her use of the

oppressive word "psychotic"

illustrates what much of the

criticism is about: that
feminist therapists gener-
ally support oppressive
psychiatric notions of men-
tal health/mental illness.
The idea of the "ex-mental
patient" psycho killer is

a popular TV theme. But the
truth goes no farther than
the popular misconception.
Although I abhor crime
statistics for being racist
and classist, I do want to
say that mental patients

as a group commit fewer
crimes, violent and other-
wise, than any other group.
So incarcerating, poison-
ing, and torturing a per-
son because someone fears
she or he is dangerous is
another excuse to lock up
someone for the crime of
expressing anger and dis-
content. What about incar-
ceration in a mental insti-
tution to prevent suicide?
Most suicides I know about
have happened because some-
one was so physically weak-
ened, brain-damaged, and
treated like dirt, after
living through psychiatric
"treatment," that she/he
chose to end it all. Have
you heard the quote "it

was a brilliant cure, but
we lost the patient?"

Those are the words of
Ernest Hemingway, spoken
after having shock treat-
ments. He was telling a
friend how the shock treat-
ments had destroyed his
mind, his will.

Ms. Prozan calls herself
an "expert in mental
health," such an expert
that she passes off a tot-
ally oppressive concept of
psychiatric institutional-
ization.

I am an ex-psychiatric
inmate. I use this expres-
sion, rather than “mental
patient," because most
psychiatric "treatment" is
done against the patient's
will, even if she admitted
herself "voluntarily." Fem-
inist therapists are high-
ly respected within the
community as being experts
on the subject of the emo-

tional experience of women.
However, women who openly
come out as psychiatric in-
mates are shunned and a-
voided. Social conditioning
tells women to hide away
our pain, frustration, and
rage. Women who are willing
to share the reality of be-
ing tortured for resisting
that social conditioning
are treated with contempt
and/or ignored by most
feminists.

I was in therapy with
women therapists many years
back, after psychiatric
“treatments," like electro-
shock, landed me in bed for
three years. There isn't

-Madness Network News

space in a letter (due to
word limits) to say much
more than that the feminist
therapists I saw did a lot
of numbers on my head. I do
understand that a lot of wo-
men feel good about their
feminist therapist. Women
are struggling inside and
need to talk about all

the self-doubts we have
internalized. But the real
challenge is to reach out
to each other, to be open
about these so-called "neg-
ative" feelings. The worst
pain is the isolation of
not knowing that most women
suffer in this culture.

Most therapists have de-
grees in patriarchal insti-
tutions of "higher learn-
ing." Do you know the kind
of lies that are taught
in psychology courses about
so-called "mental illness"?
What about the issue of
money and class? Poor women
simply cannot afford $25 an
hour/$100 a month. A lot of
low-income women in therapy
simply spend their entire
income on food, rent, and
feminist therapy. When
I told a feminist therapist
eight years ago that I
couldn't afford $20 per
hour, she said, “Well, it's
a question of re-arranging
priorities."

Somehow if I talk about
my frustrations to a ther-
apist it's OK. Yet, if I
talk about those same frus-
trations to women I meet
(for frustration is just
as much a part of my life
as is creative satisfaction),
I am most often called
"negative." Can't you see
the revolutionary work of
women who are open about

their emotional struggles?
Can't you see that my ex-
perience is a 20th Century
equivalent of a witch being
tortured and burned alive
at the stake?

Is feminism going to grow
into a real alternative for
women? Is feminism going to
challenge the values taught
us by the ruling class? Do
we need an educated elite
to validate our feelings?
"Will it be different, or
just the same? How long can
we keep escaping into ano-
ther prison?" Marianne

Writing For BMR
Dear BMR,

I am once again impressed
with the sheer humanity and
informational content of
your paper. As you may know,
I've toned down my writing
activities this year except
for my recent article on a
prisoner named Lonnie Woods,
which I hope you are consid-
ering for publication. (see
Nov. issue BMR).

I spent most of this year
trying my hand at TV produc-
tion and have taken a break
from that for a lot of rea-
sons—mostly unnecessary
obstacles placed in my path
by others. It's hard letting
go of it because I was real-
ly getting good and start-
ing to feel more confident.
I really stopped the writing
because I was losing my
patience with dealing with
so many publications. It
reached a point where I
could either keep writing or
put the same amount of ener-
gy into correspondence with
editors who sometimes sat on
things for years, or lost
them, or agreed to print
them but never did.

Anyway, I did get published
enough to get whatever ego
satisfaction I needed but it
became drudgery and endless
frustration after a while.
Unfortunately, TV producing
was even more pressure
since I was so dependent on
the cooperation of others
both in front of and behind
the camera.

I have decided to resume

my writing work, with limita-

tions, on issues I feel are
important and not adequately
addressed, like the Lon-

nie article. But I would like

to limit my dealings with
publications to those I know
and trust and feel confi-
dence in. Big Mama Rag is at
the top of the list. You're
monthly and you're national.
Your record on 3rd world,
psychiatric, prison, and
international issues is out-
standing plus your publica-
tion is one that can boast
authentic commentary from

concerned individuals, not
the usual filtering of in-
formation and experience
through staff writers, which
has its pros and cons.

Anyway, what I'm writing
about is that I've identifi-
ed some of the key issues
I'm interested in writing
on and I would like to have
a relationship where I sub-
mit work to BMR first; if
it is not printed then I
could begin to look else-
where.

I would also like to be
able to contact interviewees
and identify myself as a
freelance writer doing a sto-
ry for a Denver feminist
monthly, namely BMR. I would
not have to identify myself
as a staff writer or indic-
ate that you were committed
to publishing the story, on-
ly that it is being written
with the expressed purpose
that it be submitted to BMR.

If that's all right so far,
I need to know your approx-
imate circulation, in numb-
ers and where. I assume you
have readers in every state
plus Canada? What about
the foreign countries? Mexi-
co and Latin America? Europe?

I need an approximate num-
ber to give people to just-
ify why they should talk to
me. This is a new kind of
writing for me. I did journ-
al writing and essays before
but I called the toll-free
number for Child-Find today
to try to get a story on
missing children and I think
I would have gotten further
if I could have identified
my publication. They're send-
ing me some written mater-
ial that I can quote from
but I really wanted an in-
terview. Also, when I called
the prison in Marysville,
Ohio to get information on
Lonnie Woods they sounded
like they didn't believe I
was a real writer, since I
didn't name a paper. Of
course, most straight sourc-
es have not heard of BMR and
I won't get the response I
would if I was from the N.Y.
Times, but I'd like to try.
Also, I need a one-page fly-
er I can show people on BMR
without sending them a whole
paper.

Also, I sent you a review
copy of ZA LUZ in March,
1982. Whatever happened to
that?

Juana

P.S. Lonnie informs me that
all overt harassment and
abuse have stopped since I
sent a copy of the article
to the prison authorities.

However, she is very dis-
appointed that an Oct. 18,
1983 parole board gave her
another year. Her next pos-
sible release date is Octo-
ber '84, with parole hear-
ing 60 days earlier.
