Cause I'm An Inmate Do I Have To Die?

Juana Marie Paz

As 1983 wore on I began to
lose my characteristic zeal
for writing and media pro-
jects and decided to look
for something more "meaning-
ful." I started a Prison

locked up

Reading Project designed to
meet the needs of incarcer-
ated Third World women, us-
ing the wealth of reading
material received by my
press. On Sept. 12, 1983 I
received a brief request for
prisoner rights information
from a woman who believed
her life was in danger.

I advised her to remain
sober at all costs, a-
void provocation, and send
me a detailed account of the
situation, giving names,
dates etc. The following
statement by Lonnie M. Woods
was written and sent to me
with the expressed purpose
that I transcribe and distri-
bute it in an attempt to fo-
cus public attention on her
situation. Lonnie is twenty-
seven years old and is serv-
ing a 4 to 25 year sentence
for armed robbery....She is
presently incarcerated at
the Marysville, Ohio Correc-
tions Facility and her
statement is dated Septem-
ber 22, 1983:

I was put on pills short-
ly after I came. Then I
started having epileptic fits,
placed on 4 different drugs
and used as a dummy. I didn't
know where I was half the
time or what I said. I
started going into deep de-
pression, with them locking
me up. I tried to hurt my-
self because of the drugs. I
slapped a white lady inmate
and was put in Administra-
tion Control, where I have
been for the last two years-
locked in a room and beaten
by the guards every week.

When I went to Superinten-
dent Dorothy Arn I was told
her staff wouldn't do that.
I was taken from A.C. to the
hospital a mile away butt
naked by Capt. Amis and se-
ven guards in handcuffs.

My family called Mrs. Arn...
I was moved 7/11/83 to a
State Hospital on grounds of
insanity. I was sent back

in less than 3 weeks, the
doctors saying nothing was
wrong with my mind and I
didn't need...drugs. I came
back on 8/3/83.

I then was put in a room
with nothing, no water,
nothing. I had to break a
light to get someone to come
give me water. I begged to
get it. I was moved to the
max. area after the guards
C.O.M. Fox and C.O.M.

Fagman broke the four win-
dows in my room. C.M. Nickole
told that I didn't break the
windows. Mrs. Arn came to
the max. area and said I
would be done right and I
had no reason to fear her
staff. After she left I was
moved back to this room. I
didn't break lights without
water again. C.O. Hicks said
she wouldn't give me water.
C.O.M. Fox wouldn't either.

I am of sound mind and
off all drugs since leaving
the state hospital...

I could feel being set up
for something, but what? I
asked C.O.M. Nell for water
and told him what happened.
He gave me water and a light
so I could smoke. He had
been told I didn't want wa-
ter. Half an hour to 45 min-
utes later C.O.M. Fox and
C.O. Hicks came to my room
to let me empty the pot I
had to use for a restroom. I
went into the restroom and
came out. C.O.M. Fox and
C.O. Hicks were standing
there as I was going into
my room.

Fox then knocked the pot
out of my hands. If I
would've been drugged I'd
have fought, but I was looking
behind me. I didn't feel
right...Fox tried to knock
me on the floor. I went down
on one knee keeping him off
me, looking back. He said,
"McKinnen." He came out of
one of the hospital rooms. I
could feel something was
very wrong.

I was dragged into my room
by Lt. McKinnen who said,
"Nigger, I'm sick of you." I
tried to say something. He
said, "Nigger, say one word
and I'm gonna bust your face
'cause you're gonna be dead
before 1984. You're gonna go
home in a box. We're gonna
kill you, nigger." I got up.

Sgt. Cardine, Capt. Amis,
Amis' daughter, Mrs. Palmer,
were standing laughing with
C.O. Hicks. They had been
there all along. I started
screaming to get to max. with
other women. I was taken

to max. from 8/8/83 to 9/18/83.

I was moved from max. area

to A.C. where Dorothy Arn's
right-hand man James Schotton
had the room with nothing in

it and three guards on my door.

On 9/20/83 Lt. McKinnen
called up and told Sgt. Cal-
ahan to tell me they wouldn't
be up tonight but very soon.
I am in need of help 'cause
just 'cause I'm an inmate—do I
have to die? Please help
me.

With this statement Lonnie
also included a letter to
Gov. Dick Celeste of Ohio
which I forwarded, adding my
own letter of concern. The
material arrived on Friday,

Page 4 - Big Mama Rag; November, 1983

Sept. too late for the
seventh anniversary of any fem-
inist monthly publication. I
called the prison on Satur-
day and talked to two women
who refused to identify them-
selves and assured me that
1) Lonnie is in no danger—
and 2) that she is widely
regarded in the institution
as a problem inmate whose
behavior is insane and er-
ratic. Clearly the attitudes

toward Lonnie are strong and
appear to be racially-
motivated. Readers are en-
couraged to contact both
Lonnie Woods #14217 and
Superintendent Dorothy Arn

at 1479 Collins Ave.

Lonnie Woods is not the
only incarcerated woman in
need of help. The following
information is compiled from
Women in Jail: Problems,
Programs, and Resources by
Marjorie Brown Roy, one of
the most reliable sources
on the subject. (Available

*over 200,000 women are in-
carcerated in this country
alone

*most are poor, undereducated
and young, usually under 30
*80% of incarcerated women
have children and 38% lose
custody

*12% of incarcerated women
are functional illiterates
*women's institutions typ-
ically have less programs
and facilities than men's,
with TV viewing sometimes
the only activity

*almost all women behind
bars will eventually be re-
leased and licensing re-
quirements bar ex-offenders
from about half the possible
jobs

*due to institutional resis-
tance women participate in
work-release significantly
less than male prisoners
*the priority of corrections
staff is security, not re-
habilitation

*half the crimes committed by
women are victimless and ec-
onomic

*as much as 80% of the real
crime may go unreported
*over 50,000 jail and prison
cells are over 50 years old.
*the yearly cost of incarcer-
ation is higher than tuition
rates at the most presti-
gious universities

*women do not adapt well to
regimentation and group liv-
ing; incarceration may be
harder for women than for
men

*the stress of incarceration
combined with starchy diet
and lack of exercise cause:
chronically undiagnosed gyn-
ecological and other un-
treated health problems
*since women do not have a
history of prison riots and
violence little public and
media attention has been
focused on them.
