EnerGizing the Feminine Principle Today

Linda Fowler

Women form the oldest and largest continually oppressed
group in the family of humankind, their subjugation dating from
the downfall of communal society and the rise of private
property. The oppression of women exists today at all levels of
social, economic, political, and psychological interaction.

At the social and personal
levels, women’s oppression is
manifested through a lack of
personal identity. Women are
recognized, not as individu-
als, but through their men,
i.e., fathers, husbands, or
family. Through discouraged
relationships with other wo-
men, particularly in groups,
women have grown up with
the idea that they did things
with women socially, only
when they could not have the
company of a man. Through
the frequent threat or actuality
of open hostility and physical
aggression, women are kept
“in line.” In the case of
Lesbians, who are sometimes
physically assaulted, this is
primarily because they do not
relate to men physically or
emotionally, and are not
dependent on them either
economically or psychologi-
cally—are not the property of a
man or men. In the case of
women, wife-beating is not at all uncom-
mon. When Women’s Aid (a

society to aid women who
suffer physical abuse from
their men) opened its doors in
England, fifty-four women
and their children appealed for
help the first day of operation.

“The origin of caste (and the
beginning of class) was the
subjugation of the female sex.
The struggle against the basis
of oppression is at a higher
stage of revolution than the
archaic strategy of the present
radical analysis. In a time
when nearly every American
male is economically capable
of possessing a household
slave or a pretty toy, we
consider women to be the
proletariat.” 1

Economically, women are
now and always have been the
most exploited members of
any working class. Women
receive lower pay for equal
work. In fact, U.S. Govern-
ment statistics show that
white women earn less pro-
portionately than black men
(one example of caste within
the system of class). The
housewife, working endless
hours in the home (99 hours
per week, according to a
Chase Manhattan Bank esti-
mate), is the chief source of
unpaid labor in this or any
country in the world. Without
her slave labor, the entire
economic system could col-
lapse. “The rationalization is
usually that women are
inherently altruistic, which
makes about as much sense
as Senator George Murphy’s
remark that Mexicans are
better suited to stoop labor
because they are ‘built low to
the ground.’ ” 2

All men, whether intention-
ally or unintentionally, have
benefited from the social
position of women, just as all
whites have benefited from
the social position of blacks.

Engels saw the middle-
class man’s woman as a
domestic slave, not a middle-
class person. He wrote: “The
first oppression that occurs in
history coincides with the
development of the antagon-
ism between man and woman
in monogamous marriage,
and the first class oppression
coincides with that of the
female sex by the male.” It is
no accident, Engels said, that
the enslavement of the woman
coincides with the rise of
private property; in fact,
woman (her labor and her
product) was (and still is,
psychologically) the most
valuable property that a man
could possess.

Political oppression until
recently has been total. The
right to vote was not granted
until 1920, many years after
the black man had received
this privilege. This fact is
testimony that all women,
regardless of the social
position of their husbands or
families, are members of a
caste which is considered
lower than that of any man,
whether he be black, white,
upper, middle, or lower class.
Even today women hold less
than 1% of elected offices in
the United States.

WOMEN’S IDENTITY

Although certain social and
legal adjustments can be
documented, mass consci-
ousness itself has not
changed accordingly. The
most severe oppression, and
the crux of all others, has
been and continues to be
psychological. Women suffer
extreme identity confusion,
lack confidence in their
abilities, have little sense of
self-worth, and experience
alienation from other women
and from their own feminine
principle.

They are apart from someone
else. Just as blacks live in a
world defined by whites,
women live in a world defined
by males. (The generic term
for human being is “man”;
“woman” means “wife of
man.”) Thus identified and
defined, a woman has little if
any sense of herself as an
individual entity. (We do not
suggest that there are no
women who have escaped this
situation; certainly, all of us
could cite a few obvious
exceptions. But the excep-
tional woman is not the
problem. The problem is the
situation of the vast majority
of women today.)

With little confidence and
almost no sense of self-worth
(impossible without a sense
of “self”) or the worth of other
women, she looks up to and
identifies with men, particu-
larly those to whom she is in
the closest proximity, i.e.,
those of her political lean-
ings, social position, or race.
For example, the black poet-
ess, Nikki Giovanni, was
quoted by the Denver Post
(Feb. 28, 1973), “The first
thing we must do as black
people, as black women, is
get power for black men.” And
Kathleen Cleaver in a San
Francisco Chronicle interview
stated she wanted nothing
more than a private life as
mother and housewife; that
she was only fighting to help
her man out, so he could be a
good father and breadwinner.

This socially conditioned
sense of altruism, coupled
with derogatory attitudes to-
wards women, and especially
towards Feminism, produces
in women a dislike of other
women, and thereby a hatred
of themselves.

THE FEMININE PRINCIPLE
As long as this abject image
of Woman remains intact,
women will have no incentive
to attempt a rediscovery of the
feminine principle. This re-
discovery of and reintegration
with the feminine principle is
the crucial point for both the
society and the individual.
The feminine principle of
life, nurturance, balance, and
harmony is the principle of the
earth itself. And it is this
principle which is being des-
troyed in the individual, in our
interpersonal relationships,
and in the earth which has
given us birth and continues
to give us life. The life-giving
energy manifest in the form of
woman, in the feminine
principle, is being destroyed
through the male principle of
power.

“It is no accident that the
second wave of feminism has
coincided with the interest in
the earth’s ecology. Our
ecology is in an almost
unbelievably perilous state.
Balance has been upset to the
point where all our lives are
threatened. The earth, the
eternally feminine, has been
brutally raped. Man’s desire to
“master” nature has become a
mastery of death-force.

This feminine principle—
that which is maternal,
materialist and peaceful (non-
competitive)—must, for the
survival of us all, be reassert-
ed at all levels of interaction.
It is woman, the biological
female, who can reaffirm this
principle through her own
self-knowledge.

THE POLITICS OF GROWTH

Woman in her present
condition does not know who
she is, through either her
history (almost totally de-
stroyed) or her identity, and
hence, cannot begin to
reaffirm what she is (the
feminine principle). The right
of every entity, indeed the
necessity, is to know who and
what we are. Without this
knowledge, no growth is
possible.

Men and women have
reached a point of combative
interaction at which all move-
ment stops. And with it all
growth. And with that, all life.

Both men and women must
assume responsibilities for
eliminating that combative
interaction—for seeing what
is happening at all levels of
interaction.

Presently, every sphere of
government and influence is
controlled by men. Personal
solutions or exceptional ad-
justments to political problems
are not revolution. The solu-
tion is found in uniting with
other women to assert the
integrity of us all. Conscious-
ness-raising is more than the
awareness of one’s condition;
it is the ability to move.

When a woman is just
beginning to establish her
own identity, to explore
herself as a full person in her
own right, rather than as an
appendage of some “other,”
she is on very shaky ground
personally—unsure of any-
thing. Previous to this point,
she has had some identity
(through men, family), if not
her own. Now, with nothing to
rely on, she is more easily
than ever intimidated.

Passivity has been woman’s
accommodation to oppres-
sion on all levels. Through
years of social conditioning to
be passive, it is now impossi-
ble for her to assert her
identity in association with
the male. She is so condi-
tioned to non-assertiveness in
association with men that she
cannot possibly get it
together to assert something
of which she herself is
unsure.

It makes no difference at
this point what the particular
attitudes of men may be,
either positive and encourag-
ing or negative and discour-
aging. She is so well-condi-
tioned and so insecure that
she cannot function in their
presence.

She does not know her
identity and needs her sisters'
parity and support to discover
it. Working together on
projects and in discussion
groups, women start to see
each other not as competitors
or inferior companions, but as
sisters in a common struggle.
Identity with other women on
all levels is the ideal for the
Feminist seeking equality,
self-realization, and reinte-
gration with her feminine
principle. She attains an
increasing sense of self-worth
in an atmosphere of real
equality in which no party has
the social advantage. This
atmosphere is created in
centers and groupings which
are specifically women’s. We
need places to encounter
ourselves and each other and
places to affirm our culture.

The feminine principle must
be reaffirmed by us all. It is
woman who is in touch with
this principle. She must have
a conscious awareness of
this, a firmly established
sense of personal being and
personal worth, a sense of her
own entity—she must know
who she is—before she can
meaningfully contribute to an
evolving society; before she
can effect social change. The
“feminist’s withdrawal as far as
possible from the source of
her oppression can in no way
be construed as a political
cop-out. On the contrary, it is
at this point that the conflu-
ence of the personal/political
(articulated but not sufficient-
ly explored by feminists as a
whole) attains the dimension
of imperative reality, . . .” 3
