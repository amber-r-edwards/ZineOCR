I No Longer Call Myself A Zionist  

and demonstrated there and  
still the horror in Lebanon  
continued, while women on  
the marches told me of be-  
ing forced to flee their  
homes in Palestine in 1948,  
and they talked of massacres  
by the Israeli army of Pal-  
estinian villages.  

I came away thinking, I am  
ignorant, I have been so lazy  
in my Jewishness that I have  
never bothered to study Zion-  
ism. I have always just ac-  
cepted this belief on faith,  
reacting from instinct and  
not from reason.  

So I set about to correct  
this situation with study,  
and someone gave me Our Roots  
Are Still Alive, and another  
loaned me Moishe Sharett's  
diaries, and Israel Shahak  
and Leah Tzemel's writings.  
From the library I found the  
writings of Ben Gurion and  
Begin which are quite indict-  
ing and show the early expan-  
sionist nature of many Zion-  
ists. On the marches there  
were Palestinian and Lebanese  
people to talk to and learn  
from. Perhaps what really  
reached me directly in the  
heart were the pictures taken  
by Jonathan Dimbleby in a  
book called The Palestinians;  
these pictures showed the  
suffering of the people, and  
they reached me more than  
words can. Till I read Sitt  
Marie-Rose that is, and then  
words, short of being in  
Beirut on the spot, were able  
to move me to such a point of  
clarity that I could never  
get to with all the factual  
stuff I had been reading, no  
matter what revelations I  
learned every day. Reading  
Sitt Marie-Rose is a sobering  
experience, for it teaches  
us just who are these mon-  
sters in Lebanon who are Is-  

rael's allies and who Israel  
has been supplying with free  

weapons and advice for many  
years. In fact, the Falange  
is a fascist term originally  
inspired by Hitler and Musso-  
lini.  

The back cover of Sitt  
Marie-Rose, a small paper-  
back, tells us--  

LEBANON ~

PRE-1948 PALESTINE  

PALESTINE  

UN PARTITION PLAN  

"This is a story of a woman  
abducted by militiamen dur-  
ing the Civil War in Lebanon,  
and executed. It reveals the  
tribal mentality which makes  
of the Middle East a danger-  
ous powerhouse...Etel Adnan  
is a poet and a writer well  
known throughout the Arab world.  
A painter and a tapestry de-  
signer, her works have been  
exhibited in the U.S., Eur-  
ope, and the Arab countries.  
She lives in California."  

So you get to know the end-  
ing of her story by reading  
the back cover, but that is  
unimportant. What is impor-  
tant is the power of art to  
transcend political pain in  
this tapestry of poetry that  
describes what has been cal-  
led the Lebanese Civil War,  
but is really not a civil  
war but a war between the  
haves and the have nots, as  
is happening right now in  
so many parts of the world.  

It is through Marie-Rose  
that we learn just who these  
masked men are, for one of  
her captors is her childhood  
sweetheart Mournir--  

"I would have to meet  
Mournir again, here like  
this...He was different from  
his friends. He was the only  
one among them who loved Syr-  
ia. He dreamed of going hunt-  
ing there. While the others  
believed that unless one re-  
sembled Europeans one was  
nothing, he spoke of Asia as  
an enchanted continent...  
Eventually though, his  
friends did have an influence  
over him, and he too made fun  
of Arab cinema and everything  
else that belonged to the re-  
gion. It was because they  
were taught by Jesuits who  
oriented them toward Paris  
and the quarrels of the  
French kings.  

These young boys were exal-  
ted by the Crusades. Mournir  
identified with Frederick  
Barbarossa because he was  
himself slightly red-haired.  
The Crusades excited all  
of them. Every year, those  
French priests led a proces-  
sion in which all the stu-  
dents of the Christian sch-  

ools were dressed in white  
tunics with square red cros-  
ses sewn front and back...  
They carried palm branches  
through the streets of Bei-  
rut singing, 'I am a Christ-  
ian. This is my glory, my  
hope, my support...' They  
dreamed of a Christianity  
with helmets and boots, rid-  
ing its horses into the  
clash of arms, spearing Mos-  
lem foot-soldiers like so  
many St. Georges with so many  
dragons...  

The Crusade which I al-  
ways thought was impossible  
has, in fact, taken place.  
But it's not really relig-  
ious. It's part of a larger  
crusade directed against  
the poor. They bomb the un-  
derprivileged quarters because  
they consider the poor to be  
vermin they think will eat  
them. They fight to block the  
tide of those who have lost  
everything, or those who have  
never had anything, and have  
nothing to lose. They have  
turned those among them that  
were poor against the poor  
"of others". They have per-  
verted Charity at the heart  
of its root. Jerusalem is  
the great absent. The city,  
founded a few thousand years  
ago by Canaanites, their an-  
cestors, where Christ died  

and rose--they've never  

been there. They don't plan  
to go. The spiritual Jer-  
usalem is dead, in their  
consanguineous marriage,  
under the weight of their  
hatred. It is no longer in  
the Middle East."  

And even under the worst  
torture the strength of  
Marie-Rose is an inspiration  
to us all and as frightening  
to her abductors as were the  
millions of witches killed  
in the Middle Ages as enem-  
ies of Christianity.  

"Marie-Rose frightens  
them. They have all the  
means in the world to crush  
her in a second, to subject  

her to all forms of dis-  
grace, to throw her, cut in-  
to pieces, into the side-  
walk, and register her name  
in their bulletins of vic-  
tory. But they've known  
from the beginning that they  
wouldn't be able to conquer  
either her heart or her  
mind. The more she speaks  
to them of love, the more  
they are afraid...finding  
themselves before a woman  
who can stand up to them,  
(they) are terrified. She  
breaks on the territory of  
their imagination like a  
tidal wave. She rouses in  
their memories the oldest  
litanies of curses. To  
them, love is a kind of  
cannibalism. Feminine sym-  
bols tear at them with their  
claws. For seven thousand  
years the Goddess Isis has  
given birth without there  
being a father. Isis in  
Egypt, Ishtar in Bagdad,  
Anat in Marrakesh, the Vir-  
gin in Beirut. Nothing  
survives the passing of  
these divinities: they on-  
ly loved Power, their Bro-  
ther or their Son. And you  
expect Marie-Rose to hold
