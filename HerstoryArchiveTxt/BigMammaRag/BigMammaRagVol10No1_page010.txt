clear that we must focus on
developing a movement that is
capable of building and de-
fending an underground abor-
tion network. At the same
time the emotional issues of
abortion must be addressed.
These emotional issues are
the claim by the right-wing
that abortion is murder, and
the charge in Third World
communities that abortion is
genocide. Not dealing with
these two emotional issues
has been a tremendous imped-
iment in the feminist abor-
tion rights movement.

To the charge that abortion
is murder, we must respond
with outright strength. Yes,

from page 10

abortion does take the life
of the fetus and a woman has
the right to do that. We can-
not afford mincing around with
statements like, "I don't
personally support abortion,
but every woman should have
the choice." The issue is not
"choice" or a woman's right
to privacy. The issue is a
woman's right to abortion, to
ending the life of the fetus.
The issue cannot be debated
in a moralistic or philoso-
phic vacuum, but must be
placed firmly in the context
of the concrete situations
women are facing in our lives
when we decide to abort.

To the charge that abortion

is genocide, white feminists
must not sidestep this issue
or deny the reality of geno-
cide. Instead, we should work
with Third World organizations
to expose those programs and
groups that advocate abortion
or birth control for racist
population control reasons.
At the same time, the femi-
nist demand for abortion and

I birth control, coming from

the necessity we, as women,

have to control our reproduc-

tion, cannot be labelled gen-

ocide.

Although the conference
concluded without any clear
direction or strategy, it was
an opportunity to build net-
works of communication and
share information about par-
ticular situations in our
different communities. The
presence of a visible, organ-
ized conference of women dis-
cussing these issues in the
southeast is significant.
Women from the Tallahassee
Feminist Women's Health Center
report that the local Talla-
hassee paper, The Democrat,
was printing about 3 anti-
abortion letters prior to the
conference. It has now drop-
ped off to almost none.

The conference concluded
with a laundry list of issues
and strategies ranging from
opposing the neutron bomb
and developing boycotts of
multi-national corporations
to making preparations where

necessary for underground
abortion networks to building
an anti-imperialist women's

movement. It seems clear that
we must share with as many
women as possible the skills
and information necessary to
provide abortion care. This
is an immediate need. At the
same time, the idea that we
can make any significant
reforms, in abortion law or
other laws, is an illusion.
This country is rapidly pur-
suing a fascistic direction.
For this reason we must build
organizations that are seri-
ous about their revolutionary
goals. We have no choice but
to make a major break from
this system. However, the
struggles and conflicts of
the white women's movement
reflect the contradictory
position white women are in,
as white women we receive
certain benefits while at the
same time suffering under the
system of male supremacy. Un-
fortunately, the white women's
movement in the U.S., cur- —
rently as well as the first
wave in the early 1900s, has
a history of allying with the
white male power structure to
achieve some reforms and a
bigger piece of the pie. It

is crucial that the white

women's movement break with
that history and take a firm
anti-imperialist stand in
unity with the oppressed peo-
ples of the world.
