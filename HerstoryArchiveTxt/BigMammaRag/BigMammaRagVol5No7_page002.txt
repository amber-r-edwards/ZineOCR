Denver Gays: ‘Unity’ is Questionable

Tea Schook

In recent months, the "Gay Ques-
tion" has become an ever-growing is-
sue of national importance. Attacks
on homosexual civil rights, the most
publicized being the Dade County,
Florida repeal of gay rights, have
had the effect of uniting the diverse
groups that comprise the gay "com-
munity." However, just how united has
the Denver gay populace become? How
real is the new rhetoric of "Gay Un-
ity?"

The first visible show of gays or-
ganizing in Denver occurred June 7th,
the date of the Florida repeal. A
hastily-formed "June 7th Committee,”
consisting of men and a few women,
called a candlelight march on the
Capitol. The parade route passed all
the major gay men's bars in town--
"Out of the bars and into the Streets."
This march drew several hundred gay
men and a handful of lesbians. A
small group of Bible-toting prayer
leaders also attended, mainly to con-
vert sinful sodomists.

The group of religious men, women,
and their pre-school children fol-
lowed at the heels of gay marchers,
quoting scriptures at appropriate in-
tervals and predicting rather hot,
uncomfortable futures for those who
were proud of their homosexuality.
Marchers replied in kind: one woman
who was rather persistent in her re-
ligious fervor was constantly being
called "bitch" by gay men--until a
lesbian threatened to castrate the
next male to exhibit sexism in her
presence. A black man was taunted
by the marchers--"Hey Boy." It was
no accident that so few parade par-
ticipants were third world or women.

Two weeks later, a symposium was
held June 18 on Contemporary Gay
Issues in Denver. The symposium was
organized by an independent coalition
of, once again, mostly men. The wo-
men who participated the most fully
in this venture were strong radical
women who pushed for and achieved
several lesbian-oriented workshops.

The men involved in the group were
very conscious of lesbian issues,
and made many attempts to make sure
there was greater outreach to women.
The emcee of the event was a woman,
as was one of the two keynote speak-
ers. Workshops on Separatism were
heavily attended by both sexes.

June 19th began Gay Pride Week.
Originally, the week's plans had con-
sisted of several drag shows in Den-
ver's sleazier bars. These fell
through and the only activities com-
memorating the week were ecumenical
services at the Capitol building
sponsored by the many gay religious
organizations in town and presided
over by Rev. Rhea Miller, "Gay Day"
at Elitch's Amusement Park, and a
march down Colfax Avenue on June 24.

Activity in Denver. One man was beat-
en and a woman's hair was torn out
when an attempt was made to render
the keg inoperative after it became
obvious that the majority of Gay
Pride marchers saw unity only in
terms of sexual preference.

During the rally at the Civic Cen-
ter, feminist lesbian concerns were
generally treated frivolously. One
woman spoke about the offensiveness
of drag queens to women and was im-
mediately mocked by the man who was
emceeing the affair, a professional
drag queen.

Events that occurred at the Gay
Pride March are worth noting due to
the controversy surrounding it. The
march itself was flawless--thousands
of women and men filling Colfax Ave-
nue from Cheesman Park to the Civic
Center. Gay Pride and Gay Unity
were the catchphrases of the day.

When marchers reached the Civic
Center, it was learned that two male-
oriented disco bars had graciously
and thoughtfully provided a keg of
beer for sale to the hot marchers--
Coors. A battle ensued when a group
of radical lesbians, joined by a
small number of men, protested the
sale of a beer which is being boy-
cotted nationwide. Coors is currently
the focus of labor and left ac-

The issue of serving Coors was
treated as purely an economic con-
cern. Coors is the cheapest beer to
serve by keg. The middle-class
white men who organized the rally
claimed a lack of funds determined
the beer brand. They had, however,
been warned very early in the plan-
ning to not serve Coors. They had
decided that it was an unimportant
issue in terms of unity.

More recently, a conference, tit-
led "National Gay Leadership," was
sponsored by the Metro Community
Church (MCC). Conference planners
purposely ignored the issues of
sexism and racism, although it had
been raised from the beginning also.
"Gay Leadership” really meant that

a handful of white middle-class men
were going to lead the gay movement
directly into the capitalist arms
that oppress all. Once again, a
group of lesbian feminists and gay
men organized a special non-sched-
uled workshop to discuss the issues
so pointedly deemed unimportant by
the white middle-class male planners.

The trend in the male gay commun-
ity is, as it has always been, to
ignore all other minority struggles
as irrelevant. There is no reason
for lesbians, third world, or wor-
king-class people to support the gay
male groups in town so long as white
middle-class gay men continue to
claim privilege over other minori-
ties. Can there, however, be coal-
itions on specific issues?

August 2, a fundraiser for lesbian
mothers' custody battles was spon-
sored by a coalition of radical les-
bians and gay men: The event was
successful, drawing money from two
very diverse communities, the les-
bian and gay male. This was due to
the composition of the group plan-
ning the benefit. Coalition worked
for this specific event.

There is one group in Denver that,
although predominantly male, is mak-
ing an effort to cope with class,
race, and sexism within its ranks.
This is the Gay Community Center of
Colorado (GCCC). The GCCC is a new
project and has yet to show itself
in terms of actual services. The
coordinator, Phil Nash, is taking
his duty to lesbians seriously and
has conferred often with lesbian
feminists for input and feedback.
The board of directors has a third
world man and woman who actively
raise sexism, racism, and class as
issues.

It must be mentioned that the men
who work on these coalitions and
fight their own sexism are always
the same handful. Many of the sym-
posium planners are involved in
GCCC and assisted in the lesbian
mothers' benefit and participated in
the protests. This is a handful out
of, if the Gay Pride march is any

Chicana Wins Release from State Hospital -

Deb Taylor

Cicelia Gonzales is a Chicana les-
bian who was sentenced to an indef-
inite stay in the State Hospital in
Pueblo four years ago due to a shoot-
ing incident in which her brother had
been killed. What actually happened
is not clear--the gun may have gone
off accidentally in a family quarrel.
Sis does not like to talk about it
except to say that she decided to
take the rap for the woman who was
her lover and also involved in the
incident.

Sis never had a trial; her attorney
advised her to plead temporary insan-
ity, probably because of her age at
the time (17). She spent six months
in a county jail and one month at
Colorado Psychiatric Hospital where
one doctor decided that she was le-
gally "insane." She was then sen-
tenced to incarceration in Pueblo
State Hospital.

For two and one-half years, she
tried to get her release, but did
not really know how to go about doing
it. Staff agreed that she did not
belong there, but they would not
fight the hospital bureaucracy. Fi-
nally, in May 1976 she escaped and
moved to San Francisco with her
lover, Chery.

Sis lived in San Francisco for a
year before she was extradited to
Colorado. During that year, she
proved that she could survive on her
own. She got a job, shared an apart-
ment with her lover and even got a
Federal grant to go to school. She
built up a strong circle of support
and friends within the feminist com-
munity, also.

In March 1977, authorities extra-
dited her, and her friends in Cali-
fornia contacted a feminist attorney
and BMR in Denver. These contacts
gave Cicelia the support she had
lacked previously to get the legal

process moving toward her release.
After months of waiting and work
by her Denver attorney and the De-
fense Committee which had formed to
raise money on her behalf, a sanity-
release hearing was scheduled for

August 5th. Two weeks before this
hearing, two doctors at State Hospi-
tal determined that Sis was sane and
should be released. Her friends were
overjoyed at the certainty that she
would be released within days.

One week before the scheduled hear-
ing, the District Attorney in Pueblo
said that he would not release her
unless she agreed to see the doctor
who had originally declared her in-
sane. This meant a delay of several
months unless she agreed to take a
felony on her record because of her
escape from the hospital. (This is
what District Attorneys’ Offices
refer to as "making a deal.") A fel-
ony would remain on her police record

by Deb Taylor

and make it difficult for her to ac-
quire employment. Neither offer by
the D.A. seemed tenable.

At the last moment, however, the
D.A. agreed to release her with a
deferred judgment on the felony es-
cape charges. Under this proposal,
Sis would plead guilty to the felony,
but the sentencing would be deferred
for two years. In other words, if
she does not get into any trouble
with the law in the next two years,
the felony will be dismissed from her
record and she will never have to
serve any time for it.

It was expected by Cicelia's sup-
porters that she would finally be
released on August 8, 1977. All
that was required was that she enter
a plea of guilty to the escape
charges. This procedure normally
takes but three minutes in Court.
However, the judge decided that he
did not have the time to hear her
plea. He postponed her plea entry
for another three weeks until August
26th.

This means that Sis will have to
spend three weeks of her life incar-
cerated in a state hospital simply
because a judge would not spend three
minutes of his court time. This is
a good example of how the legal sys-
tem hurts people in this country and
ignores their needs.

Sis says, "The hardest part about
being locked up is not knowing what
is going on and having people make
decisions when they don't know any-
thing about you. You never know what
to expect."

She is planning on staying in Colo-
rado Springs for a month or so to
earn money for her return to San Fran-
cisco. Chances are she will not get
SSI or welfare disability money be-
cause she has been declared sane.

She is penniless, but has refused
offers from friends in San Francisco
to pay her way back. She says that
it is due to her "working-class ego"
that she wants to go back through
her own power and work.

Sis’ situation is only unique in
that she was able to have so much
outside support and publicity. Thou-
sands of women like Cicelia spend
their lives rotting in hospitals be-
cause they do not have the contacts
to help them. The mental health in-
dustry punishes the powerless "mis-
fits" in this society (women, third
world, etc.); incarcerated patients
need outside power and support to
fight it.

Eventually Sis wants to go to law
school so that she can help others to
be released from institutions like
Pueblo State Hospital. She realizes
that she has been extraordinarily
lucky to have so much outside support.
This outside support helped her to
survive her ordeal; “everybody being
concerned about me--women in San
Francisco and Denver, getting letters
from all over the country and my love
who visited me nearly every day. I
tried not to listen to what the peo-
ple had to say in the hospital. I
listened to the people I knew and to
myself. I got a lot of support from
other people.”

The Defense Committee still needs
money and Sis still needs emotional
support. Write her at Ward 67, Colo-
rado State Hospital, Pueblo, Colorado.
