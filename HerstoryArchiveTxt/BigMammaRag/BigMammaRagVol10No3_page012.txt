Spirituality

Hexes To Holy Wars - Nonpolitical

Kim Womantree

When you are rejected, de-
jected, and suspected; Un-
employed and unenjoyed; Out
of control, trying to get

on the dole; Eating, breath-
ing, watching, reading,
smoking, drinking junk;

voices

anything to postpone or deny
the pain... when that doesn’t
work, screaming, crying,
walking down the street
talking to yourself, alone...
striking out at the people

you love, fantasizing brutal
murders of people you hate...
and saying yeah at the look

one

in people's eyes, pitying,
disgusted, yeah, I'm crazy
and PROUD of it....stomping

to punk music...
When your politics becomes

words and more words: oppres-
sion, repression, depres-
sion, supercapitalist-

patriarchy...and
you've stumbled through a
jungle of tangled oppression
with no way to pull anyone
out without hacking through
the whole thing... and tie
tendrils are woven clear
into your brain and your
heart.

Until somewhere in the mid-
dle of this finally a pre-
sence, warm, calm, amused
says: My dear, must you be
so dramatic?

And again you remember it
didn't always used to be
like this...there was a time
and a place where my mind was
quiet, where I acted from
center...when I knew for cer-
tain I was a part of all that
lives and that the pattern
was not meaningless.

But remembering too it took
effort to get there and to
stay there.

You have to confront and
swallow and deal with so much
pain, grasp both live wires
of so many contradictions to
try to resolve them in your
own severely shocked experi-
ence. And yes, to stay there
...discipline, taking respon-
sibility for your own life.
Two phrases I cringe at and
always hang there haunting.

The balance is not natural
but an act of will
concentration, like threading a
needle, combing lice from a
kid's hair, walking a tight-

and con-

rope, playing a good game of
pool.

And you can't hide; can't
ever escape really. Not skin,
not money, not looks or charm
will shield you from the big
exhaust fan, loaded with shit
and ready to go, straight a-
head, around the corner from
where you're walking.

There are so many mistakes
and set-backs on the way --
so many excuses for not doing
it right.

The benefits are obvious and have been
stated many times by others;
calm, peace of mind, more
energy, ability to cope with-
out a breakdown, and having a
sense of belonging, to name

a few. Better health physical-
ly.

What about the benefits to
movement? Isn't spiritual-
ity contradictory to what re-
volution is about? We are sup-
posed to look only at the
Material plane. Concrete Con-

So, remembering all this,
you might just decide to
ignore that voice, that calm
presence, the pool of energy
always there if you can reach
for it. You might just decide
it's not worth the trouble
and go ahead and be dramatic
and self-destructive. Split
up your work group, alienate
your lover, abuse your pets,
wreck your health--why not?
You deserve it, you're a mis-
understood genius, after all.

You're getting impatient?
You want me to explain my
spiritual path? I'm trying.
So what would make it worth-
while for your basic revolu-
tionary person to go through
all this to be "spiritual"?
And can't a person be spirit-
ual without suffering, to get
there? Well I hate to sound
like a priest, but no, I
don't think a revolutionary
can go on any smooth path to
spiritual growth. What makes
it worthwhile?

The benefits to an individ-

ual are obvious and have been
stated many times by others;
calm, peace of mind, more
energy, ability to cope with-
out a breakdown, and having a
sense of belonging, to name

a few. Better health physical-
ly.

What about the benefits to
movement? Isn't spiritual-
ity contradictory to what re-
volution is about? We are sup-
posed to look only at the
Material plane. Concrete Con-

ditions. Everything is econ-
omics. Religion is the opiate
of the people. Isn't it
wrong -- a middle-class
luxury to spend time and
energy on one's spiritual
development.

Ok, answers. The key word
here is “one". That is, if
you see your Spiritual Quest
for what it will do for you,
then that's just where the
benefits will end -- with
Numero Uno. And no, kiddies,
this is not politically
correct. But -- if you are
consciously looking for a
way to be more useful to your
union or community -- a
better team worker, a
stronger fighter, a clearer
strategist -- then your Quest
might just be of benefit to
your movement. Don't preach
though -- anarchists teach
by example.

If you are out for yourself
alone--as all our training
says we should be--no, there
is no way any type of medit-
ation or prayer will help
your group get on with the
work. But if you're just out
for yourself, your collective
or whatever should have dis-
credited you or thrown you
out long ago anyway.

All religious and spiritual
disciplines have a politics
attached. There is no such
thing as "pure" spirituality.

For example, most Christian,
Jewish and Islamic traditions
have relied on the oppression
of women. It's right there at
the foundation of the belief
system. That's politics.

Also, 99% of the churches in
this country accept the pres-
ent capitalist system and
think the concept of private
property is A-OK (They own a
lot of private property.)
That's politics. Of course,
this is also true of the Moon-
ies and the Guru Maharaji
People and the Krishnas. Al-
though individual members of a
sect may have given up all of
their worldly goods, (great
for working capital) the corp-
orations that run the sects
buy land, start businesses,
etc., are very much into Get-
ting Ahead and pushing US
imperialism abroad and explo-
iting people here at home.
That's politics.

If your spiritual path is
one of the above, it will seem
quite natural and forgivable
for you to be out for #1.
Examples:

In Denver, Pastor Blair
of Calvary Temple a few years
back financed and ran a huge
real estate scam that ended
up taking large chunks out
of many old people's pensions
and savings. There was a
scandal, Blair said it was
all a big mistake--without
refunding the money--and now
the congregations at Calvary
Temple continue to grow.

Sonny Scapini, a Denver
woman, practicing ceremonial
magician and con artist sup-
reme, got thousands of dol-
lars together for a Tree of
Life Seminar that never hap-
pened. There was a scandal
Ms. Scapini said it was all a
mistake--without refunding
the money--and got forgiven,
and today people flock to the
Metaphysical Mansion for Sca-
pini's aura classes, among
other things.

And that's politics.
Some of the “progressive"

spirituality
“Pure” Spirituality Has Never Existed

churches think imperialism
goes a little too far. So,
they support El Salvadorean
refugees and send money to the
reservations. Understand, I'm
not knocking those contribu-
tions--but the belief behind
them is that the system is
basically OK, it just gets a
little out of hand sometimes.
That's liberal politics.

A major part of the Cath-
olic Church in Latin America
has a politics--anti US imp-
erialism and its lackeys.
The Catholic Church in Poland
has a politics--anti Soviet
imperialism. Now, neither
one of these has an anti-sex-
ist politics. Women in these
countries will have to deal
with sexism outside of the
church, most likely.

The women's spirituality
movement in this country has
a politics--definitely anti-
sexist, and all flavors of
Left in between "get ahead by
wise investment" to (a min-
ority) of anti-capitalist/im-
perialist pro-revolutionary
covens. Also, spiritual move-
ments have radical politics
attached to them, depending
on what country they orig-
inate from, and who's running
the church or cult.
There are many examples of
this--white Jesus in Black
and Brown countries, relig-
ious justification of slav-
ery, "holy wars", etc.

Feminist spirituality tends
to use white goddesses because
it comes from the European,
Celtic and Greek traditions.

So the biggest myth around,
that both spiritual and po-
litical people go for, is
that spirituality is "a-pol-
itical." It's always been
political; it's a tool that
can be used to help or hinder
political movements. It can
go either way, to the right,
the left. What makes it go
to the left?

1) A commitment to collec-
tive growth -- the needs of
the whole instead of your
little part.

2) A commitment to working
on the material plane for
heaven on earth. No more
pie in the sky when you die.
No more “karma" and if you
exploit and oppress it’s OK
because you'll get yours in
your next incarnation. No
more casting hexes and then
not confronting oppressors

face to face.

Spiritual energy reinforces
your concrete work. And the
work provides a structure for
the spiritual energy.

When these elements are not
present, the spiritual path
is reactionary and strength-
ens the present ruling
class's power over people.

This is the crux of the
classic stand-off between
"politicos" and “mystics."

Spiritual souls say, "Oh,
but you're so un-mellow, so
hard, so despairing, so vio-
lent, such a downer. Your
vibes stink."
Politicos say, “Get thee

away from me, you spaced-out
fool! I want facts, hard
facts to deal with here!

You blind people to the suf-
fering around them and bliss
them away from struggle!

How can I care about my aura
when people are being killed,
raped and starved? I can find
Peace when I find Justice.
When this system is over-
thrown, and not before."

And both are right. Your
basic hard-core revolutionary
is often irritable, over-
worked, unbalanced and swing-
ing wildly between hope and
despair; full of love for
the distant masses, but un-
able to deal with the needy
whiny individuals around them.
Their auras are often dim,
dull and dusty from junk food
and exhaustion.

And it is very silly to
think it is possible to have
a loving, just or peaceful
world when the multinational
corporations which now con-
trol people's lives and lands
all over the world are allow-
ed to continue their blood-
sucking. And for sure the
corporations, the armies that
back them, are not going to
be melted away or mellowed
out of existence by prayer,
meditation, chanting and
hexing.

There are two things that
prayer, meditation, group
chanting and energy circles
do: 1) strengthen the group
bond. Holy wars, the civil
rights movement, women's en-
ergy circles before antiporn
actions--this tactic is as
old as history. 2) And this
one starts from the individ-
ual but doesn't end there:
by a process of calming,
centering, feeling a part of
the life energy of the

universe, one is able to
become more patient and
loving, less irritable, less
randomly violent (directing
rage where it belongs in-
stead of at whomever's
closest). One is able to
recharge energy when it
dwindles from exhaustion and
overwork. These are goals,
and a means to goals.

My particular spiritual
path makes use of yoga, pagan

spells, womancraft, self-
hypnosis, stuff I make up,
fragments of prayers--bits
and pieces from all over,
whatever I can use. I prac-
tice by myself--I have not
found any coven or group I
feel comfortable with poli-
tically. The ones that are
pagan and anti-sexist are not
anti-capitalist.

I do not try to “let go of
my ego" or become more self-
sacrificing. That is a slide
backwards for me. I've work-
ed too hard for my self-re-
spect, and my flamboyance is

a survival tactic--I have to
rise above the shit, laugh
at it, not be defeated and
ground down by it. That's
politics--pagan politics.
One more thing I want to
say is that political work,
and revolutionaries who do it
are more often than not
"spiritual" anyway. Although
they might spit in your eye
if you said so to them.
There is a bond that grows

T.O. Sylvester/The Advocate

between people who share
work and risk everything
they have. There is a deep
spiritual decision in saying
"I am alive NOW and I am
going to take this life and
combine it with all the other
lives on the line NOW for a
chance at the survival of
the race, and a world of
freedom and justice and no
rich folks. As Che Guevara
said, “let me say, at the
risk of seeming ridiculous
that the true revolutionary
is guided by great feelings
of love."
