If we were to limit our de-

ity to a commitment to fem-
inism on its deepest levels.
It must be responsible to all
women. The question then be-
comes, What is a woman's is-
sue?

Clearly whatever affects
any woman's life. This goes
much further than issues that
affect all women or affect
the majority of women. What
I speak of here are issues
that are the everyday strug-
gles of women who are not of
the dominant race and class,
the women who don't usually
have access to print.
The realities of our lives as
poor and working-class women,

tina, Native, Jewish and mul-
ti-racial women, as lesbians,

poverty, it is only just to
mention that 1 in 3 families
headed by women live below the
poverty line--as opposed to 1
in 18 headed by men. Another
poverty issue is the fact that
“foster parents (in most sta-
tes) receive more money for
taking care of children than
do women on welfare supporting
their own flesh and blood.
Raising the level of payments
made under the Aid to Families
with Dependent Children pro-
gram to the amount paid to
foster parents might be a good
organizing tool for keeping
the family together." (Quoted
from Ms. Magazine, Jan. 1982,
p. 37, and words to the wise.)
One last word concerning de-
finitions and Reagan linguistics
--which middle-class Amer-
ica seems to have, indeed
bought: "The Truly Needy."
Comparing the needy to "the
truly needy" is like comparing
the pregnant to "the truly pre-
gnant," the alcoholic to "the
truly alcoholic," and the dead
to “the truly dead." It is com-
paring the hungry to "the
truly hungry" and the home-
less to "the truly homeless.”

reproductive freedom of cho-
ice, sexuality and violence
against women (all of which
are essential survival is-
sues) we would be defining
women's issues as only those
that relate to our gender and
genitals. This excludes the
many other facets of our rea-
lity. We cannot only view
what we have in common and
ignore our differences, nor
can we only focus on our dif-
ferences. It would be fruit-
less to view only one kind of
oppression without under-
standing the web of oppressions
that were designed to prevent
us from believing that we can
work with any movement, so
that we remain isolated. Iso-
lation is the old conquer and
divide method which also per-

one wonders if Reagan and his
henchmen are sitting in over-
stuffed chairs with their
yardsticks, waiting to dis-
tinguish malnutrition from
“true malnutrition.” And pro-
bably just as important--this
bit of linguistic legerdemain
implies that poor people are
liars.

One questions when EACH dol-
lar spent by the "Defense
Dept." will be fine-tooth-
combed by American citizens—
to see if $200,000,000,000 per
year goes to "the truly defen-
sive" . . otherwise, honestly
call it the "War Department"
or the "Butter or Bombs and
Covert Activities Nucleus."
Where can we get a break-down
(journals and ledgers and bal-
ance sheets) of expenses? Re-
ceipts? Verification? Signa-
tures under penalty of perjury?
(Just like welfare people
are made to sign every month.
. -Not to mention privacy-in-
vading questions like: 1) Have
you had a vasectomy; 2) Has
your daughter had an abortion;
3) Has your mistress had a mis-
carriage; 4) Is anyone else
staying in your house--pre-

mits each of us to relate to
some form of being an oppres-
sor and creates those hier-
archical barriers.

When women are silenced by
not being printed or not be-
ing given an opportunity with
encouragement to be printed,
then the women and the str-
uggle is made invisible. The
fight against that which is
not given access to become
known is in some way destroy-

Women's publications cannot
deal with the oppression of
women without dealing with

sumably being parasitic and
getting laid, etc.) why not
make captains of industry and
their families sign these
forms every month also; after
all, their subsidies are wel-
fare, too. We want to make
sure they are “truly needy
millionaires."

Let me pose a question:
When a gas company employee
comes out to an elderly man's
house (who can't pay his gas
bill) in the middle of winter
and shoots him, the result is
that the man is dead. If the
same employee comes out, for
the same reason, and turns
off the elderly man's gas in
the middle of winter, what is
the result?

If the owner of a cereal com-
pany mugs you in the alley--
you are out $50. If the owner
of a cereal company plots with
owners of other cereal comp-
anies to regulate prices, you
are (at the end of a year) out
$50.

The answer, of course, is
that powerful capitalists can

do anything they damn well
please to you, and do it le-

The

the oppressions of all people
because we are all people and
amongst us experience all
oppressions.

Accessibility to print has
been dominated by those with
material privilege (money).
The women's presses and pub-
lications are often a reflec-
tion of the hierarchies
(power relationships) of the
dominant (enemy) culture. In
other words, white women with
money write to white women
with money about whatever it
is that concerns white women
with money. So where do women
behind bars fit in with all
this?

Women in prisons, jails and
mental institutions are igno-
red because of class and race
and culture. These are not
the women who can come to
meetings and let their lives
be known. To most women of
privilege, the women locked
up are the unknown women,
the strangers (certainly not
a part of "their movement").
This makes the women locked
up invisible--in this way the
prisons are succeeding!

gally. There is no real dif-
ference between an auto-maker
(corporation) which will not
re-call a model of car which
it knows, conclusively, will
have its steering wheel fall
off, or engine catch fire, in
significant circumstances--
and a hit man. A hit man kills
specifically; an auto-maker
kills at random. And the bot-
tom line is a callous disre-
gard for human life specifically
for the profit motive.

Consensus values of "crime"
and "democracy" may work in a
small tribe or society, but
they do not in America. There
is no way to get a consensus
because of economics, class,
race and sex prejudices, big-
otries and special interests
(powerful churches and organ-
izations.) The best that we
can hope for is a social-de-
mocracy in which laws are
founded on concern for the
welfare of the poor and dis-
advantaged without the sus-
picion that the poor are li-
ars, cheats, and criminals--
all the qualities which the
upper classes, the powerful,
see in themselves.

Responsibility

sons and mental institutions
is to lock away the angriest
--the most radical--the most
oppressed--and often the most
righteous people to keep them
from influencing others. The
out of sight, out of mind type
of philosophy. A perfect ex-
ample of this is the segre-
gation or solitary units where
some inmates are locked away
from other inmates because
they are dangerous. Since
prison conditions show us
that prisons have no regard
for inmates' safety, we can
be assured that it is the
thoughts and/or feelings of
the inmate in segregation that
the prison attempts to protect
the other inmates from. Drugs,
shock, lobotomy and behavior
modifications are used when
the thoughts are so dangerous
that the prisons believe that
they need to protect the in-
mate from herself/himself.

The only danger the prisons
perceive is danger to the in-
stitutions and the system
they are created to protect.

Another tactic to invalidate
people locked inside is the
creation of fear of the crim-
inal and the crazy. They are
stereotyped as bad, wrong,
different, irrational, not to
be identified with--certainly
not to learn from or to share
and grow with. These preju-
dices are so deeply instilled
that we deny the depths of
ourselves and destroy our
movements.

Because the women's move-
ment comes from our experience
my guess is that most upper
and middle-class women don't
make an association with wo-
men in prison, and in fact
fear them because criminals
may be a threat to their pro-
perty. Some women believe the
it's their own damn fault at-
titude. Whereas the threat of
prison for poor and working-
class women who have managed
to stay outside can feel a
barrier with our sisters in-
side who haven't managed to be
so lucky.

It is a large risk for a
woman inside to write. Any
step a woman locked up takes
risks retaliation by the pri-
son. The retaliation isn't
guaranteed and can take a va-
riety of forms. Any connection
with those outside is seen as
a threat to the prison system.

head from letters leaving Bed-
ford Hills Women's Prison in
New York State).

Many of us know the anger
we feel when we organize and/
or participate in a large de-
monstration and the media does
a total whiteout of the event,
so only those who participated
are aware of its existence.
The risks of women inside who
write are far greater than our
demonstrations outside. When
their material is edited out
of existence or found to be
irrelevant, too lengthy, or
a little late and not printed,
it is an act of invalidation
and destruction of these wom-
en's lives. There is NO EXCUSE

There are some rare women
in prison who do get attention
in feminist and/or leftist
publications. Usually they are
some star political prisoner
(All prisoners are political--
why else would the state be so
compelled to control them?). 
For the most part women inside
are ignored by all publications
--even the prison movements’.
When "No More Cages" (which
publishes page after page of
women in prison's pleas for
support) got banned in Ohio,
nearly every feminist and
leftist publication published
something about the ban. We
appreciate all of the concern

Cages" is valid to those out-
side only because our collec-
tive is women who are not now
in prison.

For women's publications to
publish advertisements for
jobs in the police or military
is an outright attack on the
lives of oppressed women. To
carry such an ad is seen as
an endorsement of those doing
the work for the state. The
question becomes clearly,
whose side are you on? When
we push for greater employment
opportunities we need to work
also against the backlash of
any advance. For example,
when Title IX was approved
and some women did get access
to jobs they were previously
denied, men got jobs as guards
in women's prisons which re-
sults in an increase of rape
of women prisoners. Backlash
always falls on the most
oppressed.

There are many things pub-
lications and individual women
inside can do to support wo-
men locked up.

1. Publishers can connect with
women inside and solicit their
work.

2. Subscriptions can be sent
free to women in prisons and
mental institutions, and can
be sliding scale to women
without money.

Women in prisons, jails and
mental institutions are vital
to the women's movement. Gen-
uine concern and commitment
can only come from within
oneself. As women who work on
publications gain the consc-

of all women, the publica-
