The Canvas Prison is not on-
ly a good read, but also a
highly revealing tale of mo-
dern psychiatric terrorism.
A left-leaning San Francisco
based private-eye tries to
rescue film star Frances
Farmer from “Auschwitz on
the Puget Sound" - a lunatic
asylum. Along the way, he
uncovers some harsh truths
about the American mental
health system, which radicals
together with practically
everyone else have too long
ignored. --Leonard Frank, The
History of Shock Treatment,
Network Against Psychiatric
Assault (NAPA). Ask for the

Amy Crancer (ex-psychiatric
inmate) has been working on
a long-term nationwide pro-
ject concerning the effects
of mental institutionaliza-
tion from the inmates'/pa-
tients’ perspective is in
progress.

The literary documentary
will be based on the respons-
es from those who fill out
special questionnaires she has
prepared along with her own
running commentary. Question-
naires are treated confident-
ially and respectfully. Amy
would like to quote anony-
mously (or with initials)
from these forms, but only
with the respondent's expli-
cit permission. Advice as
well as signed articles from
participants concerning spec-
ial issues are strongly en-
couraged, for this is a
group documentary, not just
Amy's.

Individuals and groups may
write to: Project Surfacing
POB 4433, Ann Arbor, MI 48106
(Please specify how many
questionnaires are desired and
whether return postage can be
paid, 40¢ each).
