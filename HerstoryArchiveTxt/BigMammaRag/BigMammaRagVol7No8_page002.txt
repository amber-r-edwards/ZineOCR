A female manikin, wrapped like an  
Egyptian mummy, appeared in the window  
of the Hyde Park Jewelry Store in  
Denver's Tamarac Square shopping  
center. The manikin, wrapped in  
gauze with only heavily made-up eyes  
showing, was laying prone with long  
gold necklaces draped over her body.  
Placed next to her was a recent Cos-  
mopolitan ad that read: “American  
women belong in chains.”  

Denver feminists called the store  
and also confronted the owners and  
store personnel objecting to the  
window display.  

When the feminists tried to discuss  
what the display implied, the only  
answer, and it was hostile, they re-  
ceived was that it was "ART." The  
ad was taken out of the window but  
the manikin remains. As more women  
complained, the store owner's attitude  
became more hostile and they asked  
one of the women who came in if she  
was gay.  

Lesbian Conference  
Community  
Meeting Held  

Judy Barlow  

A community meeting was held on  
Thursday, August 9th at 7:30 pm in  
the First Unitarian Church library to  
discuss the upcoming conference “Les-  
bians, Colorado, Our First Gathering”  
which is scheduled for September 28-  
30 at the Landmark Inn in Denver.  

The meeting began with presentations  
by Ann Daniel, Linda Fowler, Jane  
Hoback, Carol Lease, Deirdre Reilly  
and Wood, the six members of the plan-  
ning committee.  

The planning committee was formed  
last fall. Outreach started in March,  
1979. The committee's purpose was to  
find ways of identifying Colorado les-  
bians in order to learn "who we are,  
where we live, what we do, and what  
interests and needs we have in our  
communities." They established goals  
for the conference which include  
“establishing networks to meet inter-  
ests and needs, to affirm lesbian  
identities through culture and assoc-  
iations with each other, and to in-  
crease the visibility of lesbians as  
a group in society."  

Kathy Bougher presented a list of  
possible workshop topics. Topics  
range from lesbian mothers to polit-  
ical feminism to working with the  
male-dominated gay community. Kathy  
stressed that if no one was found to  
facilitate a workshop in a particular  
area that these particular workshops  
will not be covered at the conference.  
The planning committee has already  
determined which workshops they would  
like to see presented and know what  
thrust that particular workshop will  
have.  

A question was raised as to why the  
word "feminist" was almost non-exist-  
ent in pre-conference literature.  
Members of the planning committee  
said that although each of them con-  
sider themselves radical feminists as  
well as lesbians, they have purposely  
omitted the word “feminist” because  
they did not want to alienate lesbians  
who are not yet feminist. One com-  
mittee member said that feminism is  
only one of many issues facing les-  
bians.  

The question was raised as to what  
the planning committee was doing to  
include minority and third world  
lesbians in the conference. The  
planning committee, all white lesbians,  
said that they are now trying to fig-  
ure out ways to reach minority women.  
There was criticism from some women  
present about the policy issued by the  
committee stating that female child-  
ren could attend the entertainment  
but that male children must remain in  
childcare during the entertainment.  
That policy has since been changed.  
(See adjacent article). One woman  
present at the community meeting said  
that as a mother of a male child she  
would not be able to attend the con-  
ference because she had worked too  
long and hard, raising a non-sexist  
child to bring her son to a conference  
where it was set up to direct anger  
at male children. Other women crit-  
icized the policy for separating  
male and female children because they  
felt that it would be alienating to  
women who have both male and female  
children.  

Woman to Woman Feminist Bookcenter  
celebrated her fourth birthday with  
a day-long celebration on Saturday,  
August 11. The birthday party feat-  
ured free food, a sidewalk sale, and  
many store-wide bargains on feminist  
books, posters, and t-shirts.  

The sales for August 11 were among  
the highest ever for Woman to Woman.  

Happy Birthday! We wish you many  
more!  

Planning Committee for "Lesbians -  
Colorado, Our First Gathering  

Almost from the beginning, a  
great deal of controversy has sur-  
rounded part of the childcare poli-  
cy set by members of the planning  
committee for “Lesbians-Colorado,  
Our First Gathering,” concerning  
male children at the lesbian con-  

Because this part of the policy  
has been the subject of so much mis-  
understanding, it is important to  
make clear the original policy. The  
policy states that free quality  
childcare will be provided during  
the entire conference for children  
as well as teenagers of both sexes  
under 16 years old. Children 12  
and under are discouraged from at-  
tending workshops and--until now--  
female children were invited to  
attend entertainment functions.  
However, in response to concerns  
expressed by women who think male  
children are being discriminated  
against, we, as members of the con-  
ference planning committee, have  
decided to reconsider that part of  
our childcare policy that deals with  
children attending entertainment.  
Now, the second part of the policy  
has been changed to: ALL CHILDREN  
ARE INVITED TO ATTEND WORKSHOPS AND  
ENTERTAINMENT. MOTHERS AND GUARDIANS  
ARE ENCOURAGED TO MAKE FULL USE OF  
THE CHILDCARE PROVIDED DURING  
CONFERENCE ACTIVITIES.  

It is important that the lesbian  
community realizes our original pol-  
icy was never meant to be the defin-  
ing policy because this is a lesbian  
conference.  

A picket line was formed by about  
30 Denver feminists and some men at  
the Centre Theatre, objecting to the  
movie "X and Violence." The movie  
portrays a woman being beaten, raped,  
pissed on and other forms of brutal-  
ity done by 2 gay men and one hetero-  
sexual man.  

The picket lasted about 1½ hours  
on a Saturday afternoon. The thea-  
tre is located in the downtown area.  
Over 400 leaflets were handed out to  
passers-by and the media. The gen-  
eral mood of the people walking by  
ranged from mildly interested to out-  
right ridicule. About 20 people  
went into the theatre, mostly sorry-  
looking men and some young men with  
young women with them. Two middle-  
aged, middle-class gray-haired  
women went in together.  

The picketers tried to get the  
manager to speak with them but the  
male assistant manager and the fe-  
male manager-in-training shielded  
the manager and would not call him  
or give his name to picketers.  

The picketers were demanding that  
the Mann Theatre chain, owner of  
the Centre Theatre, close down the  
movie.  

Lesbian Conference  
Group Seeks  

Childcare Compromise  

We hoped our policy would facilitate  
the goals and needs of as large a  
number of lesbians as possible.  
Simply, our priority was--and is--  
lesbians.  

On the other hand, we tried to  
listen carefully to those women who  
were so opposed to the policy that  
they decided they could not attend  
the conference. Their arguments  
helped convince us that a policy  
change would better serve our prim-  
ary purpose: to present a confer-  
ence that will be beneficial to the  
largest number of Colorado lesbians.  

We are, of course, fully aware of  
the trade-offs involved in the  
change. An unfortunate repercussion  
of this difficult compromise is the  
exclusion of female children from  
entertainment. From our discussions  
with women in the community, the  
male privilege inherent in this  
issue was neither recognized nor  
discussed. This privilege, whether  
reinforced by women or by men,  
should not go unchallenged.  

We also think it is important to  
respond to other comments about the  
childcare policy made at the commun-  
ity meeting August 9th at the  
First Unitarian Church.  

The childcare policy was called  
racist because, according to some  
women, the exclusion of male child-  
ren from entertainment would make  
women of color reluctant to attend  
the conference. As we understand  
it, the argument was that women of  
color bear more children and, as a  
result, are more likely to have  
children of both sexes. In addition,  
women of color were said to be more  
family-oriented and would be less  
willing to separate their male and  
female children than white women  
would.  

This policy affected all women.  
It also could be construed as racist  
to assume that the policy would not  
affect all women equally.  

Constructive criticism is diffi-  
cult. And when the charge of racism  
is made randomly, it can be used to  
silence further discussion of impor-  
tant issues.
