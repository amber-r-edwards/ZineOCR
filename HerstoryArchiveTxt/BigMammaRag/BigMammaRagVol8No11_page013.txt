Realities.

vegetarianism and get used to eating
meat and junk foods again, because
after all, I may never have as much
choice in my lifestyle as I do now.
I'll have to learn to survive as
best I can - which, in some ways, I
have done for years anyway. But, as
I am well aware, survival is already
starting to have new meanings - for
all of us.

And, I have at times longed for
invisibility, and this has made me
incredibly uncomfortable with my-
self as a feminist. I have felt
insecure, weakened - doomed if I
speak out, damned if I don't. In-
tellectually, I know that to give in-
to this fear is to give in to the
right wing. I will also buy into
the myth that somehow this is all
my fault. I keep hearing my mother

saying to me that I should expect
to encounter "problems" (like
rape, violence, even housing and
hiring discrimination) because I
am a woman, an unmarried woman,
a lesbian, and most significantly a
feminist. That each of us should
have a right to live our lives free
from violence and exploitation is
a feminist tenet - one that we will
all have to fight like hell for in
upcoming months.

Another thought that has haunted
me lately is the horrible feeling
that feminist organizing has missed
its mark. At times, I can't help
but wonder if things would be better
if we'd been better organizers all
along. I do not mean organizers in
electoral politics, but organizers
who have helped to focus people’s
discontent in a revolutionary, ra-
ther than a reactionary direction.
Reagan was elected because people

Boston Clinic

are frustrated with the system,

and because they are looking for
solutions in the wrong places. The
public has been manipulated away
from the roots - instead of becoming
radicals, they have been moved even
further to the right.

As terrifying as the thought seems
at times, it is more important than
ever to speak out, to make sure that
the connections are being made some-
where and that, as the contradictions
heighten, so does public awareness.
We know that the problems of oppres-
sion are inherent in the system -
no matter who sits in the White
House. And we have a responsibility
to share that knowledge - with
everyone we possibly can. We can
make connections at the workplace,
and in our feminist work; and we
must not forget that numbers of wo-
men, some of whom even call them-
selves feminist, have supported
Reagan. Their support has made a
difference; but as we have to under-
stand, our resistance can make a
difference, too.

And, it is important to share our
deepest fears with each other, not
just to bottle them up inside. In
a lot of ways, our powerlessness
seems more real at this point than
our power - and it's going to be
an uphill battle just to maintain
any balance. As I said in the intro-
duction, the image of women giving
birth to ourselves almost seems
irrelevant now. Feminism can no lon-
ger afford the luxury of "warm sis-
terhood." We'll have to fight just to
keep the movement going, to make the
political connections between our
lives and the lives of all oppressed,
and endangered people.

as well as more flexible part-time
jobs. We also hope that self-help
groups can evolve and function on
their own with the health center as
a coordinating center.

These changes have been necessary
for WCHC to continue to exist and we
hope are reflective of realistic long
term planning that will result in a
better workplace, a sounder financial
base, and maintenance of important
services. We will eventually build
up to a full-time health center with
a larger staff and more services. We
expect this will take about a year.

We appreciate any reactions to
these changes. An open community me-
eting is planned, to share details,
and hear from you more directly.
Participation by the women of our
community has always been essential
to our survival. The meeting is
scheduled for Thursday, Oct. 30 at
7:00 p.m. at Redbook, 136 River St.,
Cambridge.

We are pleased to report that wom-
an-controlled self-help health care
is still available in Boston, and
realize that it will take a lot of
work to keep it here. Thank you for
your continuing support.

We would like to take this opport-
unity to inform you of a new and
dangerous law which has been passed
in Mass. and will affect every woman
seeking an abortion. The constitut-
ionality of a combined minors con-
sent and informed consent bill was
recently upheld by U.S. District
Judge David Mazzone. The informed
consent bill requires every woman
seeking an abortion to sign a con-
sent form 24 hours before her abort-
ion. This form includes information
regarding a physical description of
the pregnancy at different stages,
and is clearly designed to influence
women not to choose an abortion.
Furthermore, a minors consent law
requires women under 18 years of age
to obtain parental consent to have
an abortion. These laws will go into
effect Oct. 6 unless an appeal or
stay is successfully obtained before
that time.

Since abortions were declared con-
stitutional in 1973, they have be-
come less and less accessible to
women. Beginning with attacks on
Medicaid abortions and abortions for
state workers, laws such as the above
attack every woman's right to safe,
legal abortion. We must work to-
gether to fight such attacks. For
more information about the laws and
how to get involved, please call the
Civil Liberties Union of Mass., WCHC
or other groups working around abor-
tion rights in your area.

Thank you again for your support.

Sincerely,
Women's Community Health Center
Boston, Mass.

jobs are harder to find, and the gap
between what we are being paid and
what is paid to men is increasing. But
at the same time there is an up-
front attempt on the part of U.S.

imperialism to organize white women

to support the system. Killer cops
who are behind the drug plague and
arson in Third World communities and
who kill Black and Puerto Rican peo-
ple with impunity are painted as our
friends. We are urged to support
them through block patrols, rape
crisis centers and battered women's
shelters. The draft is hailed as a
forward step in the struggle for
women's equality as it mobilizes peo-
ple to support war against national
liberation struggles around the world
and in the U.S. But it is the Black
Liberation Movement that has always
spearheaded the challenge to white
supremacist empire. It has led and
continues to lead the fight against
killer cops and imperialist war.
This is a decisive point in history
for us to build an anti-imperialist
women's liberation movement, and we
urge all women to take up this chal-
lenge. The struggles of Zimbabwean
women and Black women here in the
U.S. have been critical to us in our

efforts to build such a movement.

Through their struggles we have un-

derstood that women will never win
their liberation until U.S. imperial-
ism is defeated. They have also shown
us that white women cannot build an
anti-imperialist movement without
taking on the struggle against white
supremacy. The Women's Committee
Against Genocide is committed to
following this leadership.

We believe that the National Camp-
aign in Solidarity with the ZANU
Women's League is an important part of
building an anti-imperialist wo-
men's movement. It is a way for women
in this country to show solidarity
with the women of Zimbabwe, to support
their full participation in the strug-
gle to reconstruct their nation, and
to support the development of Zimbabwe
as a rear base for supporting libera-
tion struggles in Southern Africa. We
urge all women and women's organiza-
tions to become sponsors of this cam-
paign.

time that the radical movement

Expensive Pope

The visit of Pope John II to the
U.S. last year cost the six American
cities on his tour an estimated $7
million.

Among local governments, New York
City spent slightly more than $3
million. In Chicago, city officials

set the figure at close to $1 mil-
lion.

Philadelphia estimated its expen-
ses at $700,000.

That figure did
not include $196,000 for an altar
platform that was the subject of a
lawsuit by the American Civil Lib-
erties Union.

The city governments of New York
and D.C. announced they were seeking
federal reimbursement for part of
the costs. They maintain that the
Pope is a foreign dignitary and the
federal government is responsible.

In any case the taxpayers, inclu-
ding non-Catholics and non-believers
have to foot the bill.

Fairness Doctrine Tested

A holy war is raging in television,
and its outcome could very well
change the entire industry. The bat-
tle is between the fundamentalist te-
levision ministers and members of the

gay community. In March, the atten-
tion of both sides focused on Char-
lotte, N.C., where a station gave
time to a lesbian minister to re-
spond to a sermon by a fundamentalist
Rev. Charles Sustar. Part of his
sermon was on homosexuality, and he
was making it clear that he considered
the condition nothing short of
offensive, degrading sin. The gay
community demanded equal time for

a response, under the Fairness Doc-
trine.

The Fairness Doctrine is an FCC
regulation that requires licensees
to provide reasonable opportunity
for opposing sides to debate contro-
versial issues on the air.

The station pre-empted Flames of
Revival, starring the Reverend Sus-
tar, turning the time over to a les-
bian minister, free of charge. The
station then began screening Sustar's
programs more carefully.

A scheduled Flames of Revival was
again pre-empted, this time by a
travelogue about the Caribbean. A
formal statement by the station said:
This action was made necessary be-
cause of Rev. Sustar's continued
discussion of one side of an issue
that in the station's judgment has
been adequately and fully covered
on previous broadcasts." Two weeks
later all early morning religious
programming was replaced by special
children's programming.

Decisions like this have rallied
the forces of fundamentalists, and
they plan to make their numbers known
at the polls, in the courts, and at
the FCC. This country was founded
on the teachings of the Bible, James
Robison contends...and now it seems
to be against the law to teach the
Bible.

However the preachers are not just
sitting back and taking it. They
are planning to use the Fairness
Doctrine as it has been used against
them. Don't be surprised if you sit
down to watch Soap one night and
hear a booth announcer informing you

Dear Mama.

I hope in the future you will try
to avoid using terms like "right to
life" in your reporting. "Moral
Majority," to designate a minority,
is another insidious example of what
I'm talking about. I believe the
words used structure our thoughts in
very subtle ways.

In advertising it had been custom-
ary not to mention the name of the
competition; hence, "BRAND X." 
Whether or not this was a matter of
law, it has always seemed obvious to
me that, in using the name of
another product, one runs the risk
of paying for an ad which can make
the name of the opposition more fam-
iliar. As a politician said, "I
don't care what they say about me in
the paper, as long as they spell my
name right."

When we enter the arena to do
battle about women's rights to deter-
mine the outcomes of their own preg-
nancies, we must watch our language.

program. Indeed, the war is on.

info from TV Guide, Nov. 15, 1980

It is a tactical error to describe

our opponents with their own labels,
which promote their vision of them-
selves in the public mind. Moreover
it is essential to address them with
designations which reflect our view.
Compulsory pregnancy, mandatory mo-
therhood, and anti-choice are effec-
tive and descriptive labels. A lit-
tle brainstorming may produce some
of even more merit. I think the
most creative one I've heard came
from a report about a man who was
bringing suit to try and close down
a small clinic. He was described

as having appointed himself "legal
guardian of all the unwanted fetal
tissue" in that town!

In a verbal struggle, the language
used can be as persuasive as the
arguments. Remember, a “you know
who-er" by any other name would have
to stand on the issue, not on some
dubious moral image. Let's call an
anti-choicer, an anti-choicer!
