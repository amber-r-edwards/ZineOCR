Inmate Talks Candidly About Prison Life

Sherilyn Brandenstein

Earlier this summer, I visited Colorado Women’s Correctional
Institution in Canon City and interviewed Ronelle Lee, an inmate
at CWCI. Most of the women there are serving time for relatively
“light” crimes (dealing with dope, prostitution, passing bad
checks, etc.). In some cases, they were engaging in illegal
activities in order to survive and keep their families going. Ronelle
gave us the following descriptions of her experiences in prison.

Zak Rombakis

BMR: Could you talk about
what happens when you first
came here to CWCI?

RL: Okay. When you come
into the prison, you have to
stay in isolation for two
weeks. This is where they're
supposed to run all their tests
on you. They run a physical
exam and they find out what
you're allergic to. They find
out if you're a dope addict.
There’s a whole battery of
tests they run on you. Like the
CAT to see what your grade
level is.

When I got to the prison,
driving up there, you say,
“Hey, this is a beautiful

building.” You think you can
do the time in a nice place.
You sit up there in the control
room and wait for the officer
to come down. Here comes
someone in a white uniform
taking all your personal things
from you.

BMR: Who brought you here?

RL: The Denver
Department, two men.
No women guard at all.

So next I went to the isolation
or hospital. Well, when I first
went out the door, she told
me, “Don’t look around. Look
straight ahead or keep your
eyes down.” In other words,
don’t look at the people that
are already in here. I will see them
when I get out of isolation.
'Cause one girl that was there I
knew on the streets. And then
I found that there were a lot of
them I knew on the streets.
You go in the isolation
ward...you know, you don’t
know what to do anyway.

They take me downstairs and
say, “Pull off all your
clothes.” So I start pulling
them all off and they put me
on the table. Ran their fingers
all up in my butt and stuff to
see if I brought anything in.
Then they spray you...bug
spray. Wherever you have
hair, that’s where they spray
you. And it stinks.

Okay. After they sprayed me
and gave me a towel to dry off
with and gave me a pair of
pajamas to put on (no shoes
to put on), I got a shower.
Then they gave me ten
cigarettes. I was in a room in
the Lower South for Thursday.
Then on Friday they took me
out of there and took me to
the hospital for a physical
examination from the so-
called doctor. He’s had a heart
attack and he’s still a doctor.
This girl who was down there
in isolation has a number
that’s almost like mine. My
last number is 7 and hers is 6.
So I'm giving him all my
information to go in my chart
and he fools around and
writes it on her chart. Okay.
He took my blood and put her
name on it. I stayed in
isolation for one month
because of that. They had to
keep repeating the blood test
because they kept saying that
something was coming up in
the blood. Then I said, “Are
you sure that you have the
right name from the blood you
took in the beginning?” They
said yes. I said, “You must
not, because the blood that
has all this in it isn’t any of
mine.” Later they found out
that this girl was really sick.

Women's Prison in Canon
City Sued by Inmates

Carol Lease

Late last spring a civil
action was filed in the United
States District Court against
the Warden of the Colorado
State Penitentiary, the Asso-
ciate Warden of the Colorado
Women’s Correctional Insti-
tution (CWIC), the Director of
the Department of Institu-
tions, the Chief of Corrections
for the State, the Parole Board
and the Physician for the
Colorado State Penitentiary,
on behalf of all women who
have been confined at CWIC,
are presently being confined
there, or who will be confined
there while the suit is pending
in court.

Among the violations to the
Constitution stated in the
complaint are that “the
conditions existing at CWIC,
from the physical arrange-
ment of the prison to the
degrading treatment of pri-
soners by the personnel,
subject (the women inmates)
to unequal and inferior treat-
ment on the basis of their sex,
violates their rights to equal
protection and in the totality
of the circumstances consti-
tutes cruel and unusual
punishment, all in violation of
the Eighth and Fourteenth
Amendments to the Consti-
tution;

that women prisoners have
been deprived of their rights
to free speech, to free press,
their right to political associ-
ation and religious freedom
guaranteed by the First and
Fourteenth Amendments to
the Constitution;

that inmates at CWIC have
been denied due process of
the law by being punished and
penalized for violation of
unwritten rules in an “arbitrary
and capricious manner;”

that the actions of the
wardens have violated the
Equal Rights Amendment of
the Colorado Constitution.

The complaint also cites
denial of access to the Courts
and to judicial process in
violation of habeas corpus and
due process as guaranteed by
the Fifth, Sixth and Four-
teenth Amendments to the
Constitution.

Class Action

This class action suit began
when husbands and wives
who were both confined to the
Colorado State Penitentiary
visited each other and com-
pared notes on their treat-

ment. It soon became obvious
that the women prisoners did
not have the same opportuni-
ties that the men did and were
treated more like children than
adults. One male prisoner was
a jailhouse lawyer and the
legal action was initiated, on
behalf of the women inmates.
Although there is an extensive
law library at the men’s
maximum facility, the initia-
tors realized that they needed
help from people outside the
prison walls. Help came from
the National Lawyer's Guild

and the Law Collective in
Denver. Later the court ap-
pointed Frances Olsen as the
attorney.

The Law Collective is
currently compiling affidavits
from women inmates and has
sent sets of “extensive”
questions to the Warden Alex
Wilson and Associate Warden
May Gillespie. “They are
required to answer all ques-
tions,” according to Joan
Tempko of the Law Collective.
“If the answers given aren't
sufficient we will resubmit
them. They have to answer all
our questions whether they
are admissible in court or not.
If they don’t cooperate we can
get a court order and then if
they don’t they'll be in
contempt. But I don’t think
that will have to be done.”

After this stage is com-
plete, any person concerned
in the case can be deposed in
front of a court reporter or a
tape recorder. “We'll probably
talk to Ms. Gillespie a couple
of days,” and others too says
Ms. Tempko. “The whole
thing could take a year...Up to
a year ago there was no
contact like this with CWIC.
Then the Minority Women’s
Caucus and the University
Without Walls Teacher Corps
Program and the lawsuit all
became involved with the
women’s prison.”

According to Ms. Gillespie
the lawsuit is a “fad...we’re

And they were giving me all
these nerve pills which really
freaked me out. I would take it
in the morning and an hour
later I'm knocked out. That
was four times a day. So
finally I took myself off of it,
because I don't take nerve
pills as it is and I didn't want
any.

There I am walking around,
not knowing anything. I was
really spaced out, so they
bring all these tests for me to
take. I'm sitting up there just
marking anything down. My
mind couldn't function with
what I was doing. There are
500 questions on it. Ques-
tions like, “Do you like tall
women?” “Who do you like
best out of your family?” or
“Do you lie very much?”
During the whole time I was
taking the test I'd just go
down the NO column and
draw a straight line.

When I took the CAT
test...now I have a high
school education and I've
been to college...then they go
telling me I can’t function in
the institution on showing
people how to do things
because I’m not qualified to
do it. The reason they say this
is because of the fact that
they don’t actually know what
a person can do and what she

After being locked up in
isolation, you have to go talk
to the warden. This is how the
interview goes with the
warden:

“I am the Warden here. My
name is Miss Gillespie. This

Woman as

Prisoner

Chocolate Waters

“Lord, help me this day to
learn to keep my big mouth
shut.” The plaques were
round and multi-colored and
also the very first things we
saw upon entering the Canon
City Correctional Institute for
Women. They had been
hand-made by the women
prisoners, who it would seem
from our visit, had learned the
lesson well. After all they had
to survive in this system while
doing their time and it was
obvious that keeping their
mouths shut was about the
best way to accomplish this
survival.

One thing must be made
perfectly clear at the outset:
all women, living as we are in
the patriarchal world—one run
by, on, and for the interests of
the other half of the species—
are living in a kind of prison.
The prison institutions, them-
selves, however—the way they
are run and the way women
inside are treated—are a
glaring example in miniature
of all women’s status under
the patriarchy and capitalism.
Women’s prisons confirm in
concrete how the male-dom-
inated world views all women
in general.

This confirmation takes on
a variety of forms and sexism
and capitalism are at the root
of most of them: how women
are treated differently within
the courts and the flaws, the
kinds of crimes women
commit and for what purpos-
es, the way women are
controlled and indoctrinated
with “typical feminine” attri-
butes while in prison, the
kinds of “vocations” taught in
prison and the sparsity of
education and employment
programs for prisoners and
ex-cons.

Because of our economic
system, which is capitalism,
it is generally true that the
prison population of both
sexes is composed mostly of
the poor. Although studies
have told us that the average
urban resident commits ten
felonies a year, each punisha-
ble theoretically by a year or
more imprisonment, the ma-
jority of these people will
never see the inside of a
prison (not to mention our
ex-president). The people who
do not have access to money
and know-how are usually the
first to be incarcerated.

In a survey on court and
correctional services for wo-
men, the American Associa-
tion of University Women
found that 80% of the women
surveyed were unemployed
when they were arrested and
also that Blacks and Chicanas
were arrested more frequently
than Anglo women in com-
parison to their respective
ethnic communities.

Nevertheless, other than
being non-white and poor, the
similarities between women
