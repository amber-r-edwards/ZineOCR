Working.

worked with men and I have
worked with blueprints and
I've signed up for all these
classes. I mean I gave it my
whole shot and he said "No, we
don't hire girls." I was really
angry and when I get really
angry I cry, so I started to
cry and after I walked out I
thought I've proved to him
that he shouldn't hire women.
BR: What kind of work did you
do when you couldn’t get the
drafting job?

BETTY: I got a job with a
commercial photographer and
the pay was like nothing, I
didn't make as much in a month
as I had in a week at the de-
fense job, it was a big drop.
I enrolled at DU (University
of Denver). Then I got a job
at Denver Dry (a large depart-
ment store in Denver) but the
pay was not that much more
than I had been making, excep-
t I thought I had a real
good opportunity there. My
major had been advertising
and I saw myself as someday
being the advertising manager
then I found out that women
didn't become advertising
managers.

BR: After you found that you
couldn't get a drafting job,
went through the mill of low
paying jobs, went to school--
how did you feel, were you
angry? —

BETTY: Yes I became very ang-
ry. I developed a real thing
about authority figures and

it showed up in my marriage.
We were divorced. We finally
agreed that the only reason
we had gotten along all those
years is that we worked dif-
ferent shifts and never saw
each other. And then I had
helped him get through train-
ing for body and fender work
and when I said "Now it's your
turn, I want to go to school,"
he said, "Why do you want to
go to school? Who do you think
you are?"

BR: When you moved to Denver
from Greeley there were Black,
Chicano people living here

and certainly Indians living
in the region. Did it strike
you and your co-workers as odd
that you weren't seeing In-
dian, Chicana or Black faces

in the defense industry?
BETTY: Yes, we talked about
that and what we were talking
about was the fact that we
knew they were in the armed
forces and see, where I had
grown up was around Brighton

Long, Hard Hours from page Nine:

This woman worked in a steel mill in Gary,
mixing sealing mud for casting iron. Many defense plants
were unhealthy and dangerous.

-Office War Information,

(CO) so my Chicano classmates
had gone off to war and then
the Japanese students I had
gone to school with had gone
off to war. And they were
harassed so much when I was

in high school that I couldn't
believe that they had actually
signed up. But they told me
they were going to prove their
honor and their loyalty.

BR: Did you know about the
concentration camps where
Japanese-Americans were im-
prisoned?

BETTY: Yes, I went to school
with children whose parents
and grandparents were in those
camps and they were sent to
Brighton to stay with relat-
ives or friends to go to
school. And I watched how they
were treated. The school ad-
ministration never did any-
thing about the harassment or
abuse that was dealt to those
children.

BR: All the time you were
working for the war effort
and being patriotic, how did
you feel knowing that people
of color were not getting

good jobs in the defense in-
dustry and that they were not
being treated any better, and
in some cases, being treated
more blatantly worse than

you as a panman,

Riveter

before?

BETTY: No, I knew it was un-
fair and I knew they couldn't
get jobs, but of course, they
hadn't been able to get jobs
before. The kids I went to
school with couldn't get jobs.
The Japanese-American students
I mentioned who had gone off
to war, they were later call-
ed the Purple Heart Division,
their casualties were like
80%. (See BMR, book review,
Farewell to Manzanar, June,
1982, Vol.10-No.6)

BR: What happened out here in
Colorado after the war, did
the status of Black, Chicano,
or Indian people change?
BETTY: No, the people I knew
were doing the same kind of
work they had before. There
were very few Black owned
businesses in the Black neigh-
borhoods and when I went to
DU and worked at the Denver
Dry there was a Black student
who had been in service and
who was working at Denver
Dry and he was a janitor.
BETTY: My husband, who was on
a special crew doing the
final modification, told me
after the A-bomb was dropped,
that he remembered a plane
with a device in the bomb bay
that he had never seen pre-

viously. He was physically ill
at the thought that he might
have worked on the Enola Gay
(the bomber that dropped the
Atomic bombs on Japan). My
level of awareness was so low
that I felt relieved when my
questions about that partic-
ular plane determined that
I had not worked on it. The
propaganda of newsreels and
movies of that era was very
effective; it took some time
for me to realize my role in
building weapons of war that
did attack civilians. My
awareness of racism was sharp
enough for me not to be sur-
prised when the horrible dev-
astation of the A-bomb was
wreaked on the Japanese, not
the Germans.

Later on community involve-
ment led to a job as a "grass
roots organizer" with the
Model Cities Program. Before
and during this job, I worked
with individuals and groups
viewed as "militant" or "rad-
ical". Countless people on a
local and national level
worked for change through re-
form politics and on single
issues. Any changes won were
altered by concessions requi-
red until the original was
unrecognizable or ineffect-
ive. The oppression coming
down on the militants and on
my neighbors--I lived in a
Black community--shocked me
into reality. Reformism is
not possible under imperial-
ism.

After "dropping out" for
some time, I returned to pol-
itical involvement--there is
no way for me to do political
work except in a group. For
a while, during my search for
a way to work, I was into re-
form politics again. It was
as if I had never left! No-
thing had changed. For me, it
was not where my head was--
reform politics could not
change the material basis of
people's lives or the quality
of any of our lives. My self-
definition is as a white anti-
imperialist woman, and my
political work is in that
context.
