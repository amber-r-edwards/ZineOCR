"Upfront”

Dear Sisters and Supporters,

Special greetings from the
Upfront Collective. We are
in the final stages of lay-
ing out our first issue of
Upfront, a progressive

publication

Black women's newspaper.
Many of you receiving this
communication have heard of
our efforts, some have made
financial pledges of sup-
port, a few have sent us
contributions and many have
not. This letter is both a
reminder and an appeal.

We know that Upfront is an
ambitious project that is
dependent on your continu-
ous support and our deter-
mination to make it a suc-
cess. The theme of this ap-
peal is to make Upfront a real-
ity. We need money to meet
our publication date of
October 15.

We are appealing to you
to send in your contribu-
tion and subscription as

soon as you read this letter.

No doubt there is a serious
need for what Upfront repre-
sents.

Upfront is an advocate of
Black women's human rights;
it's an open forum for wom-
en who would not ordinarily
have an avenue to publicly
express their ideas and
views; it is a training
vehicle for women interested
in learning journalism

skills.

More specifically Upfront's

objectives are:

African Women's Committee
For Community Education

Joseph Waller represents
the criminal element within
the Black Liberation Move-
ment whose practices have
the same objective results

confrontation

as the white racist capital-
ist oppressors.

In April, 1980, Joseph
Waller was expelled from
the African People's Social-
ist Party (APSP) for physi-
cally brutalizing two Black
women. In an effort to av-
oid expulsion and the con-
sequences of expulsion,
Waller submitted his resig-
nation to the Central Com-
mittee.

Shortly after his resig-
nation and subsequent ex-
pulsion, Joseph Waller
plotted with Penny Hess of

* providing an open forum
for African (Black) women to
share our strengths and
weaknesses, our joys as well
as our sadness, our strug-
gles and our victories, our
desires and our accomplish-
ments, our unity as well as
our disappointments.

* eradicating hostility
and antagonism among Black
women and promoting unity
around our common oppres-
sion.

* sharing experiences on
being independent and self-

the so-called African Peo-
ple's Solidarity Committee
and his other white confi-
dantes to organize a coup
d'état of the legitimate
APSP. Since that time Wal-
ler and his white comrades
have been struggling des-
perately to build the illes-
itimate APSP. After the
coup, the majority of the
membership withdrew rather
than work with an unprin-
cipled person.
Historically, the Afri-
can People's Socialist
Party has been used to per-
sonally benefit Joe Waller
and other dishonest male
members. Consequently,
APSP has gone from one
cause to another, never
staying with one issue long
enough to make any prog-
ress. We demand that Joe
Waller end his hypocritical
lip service to the libera-
tion struggle of Black

reliant human beings.

* providing a Black femin-
ist analysis of issues per-
tinent to Black women.

* persuading, soliciting
and recruiting women into
an organized movement for
our liberation as women,
and for the betterment of
the lives of our children
and men.

* establishing an ongoing
and viable network system
which will provide informa-
tion on the availability of
housing, employment, low-

cost nutritious food, phys-
ical and mental health as-
sistance, sisterly support,
etc.

Upfront needs your support.

people.

- Publicly Joe Waller de-
nounces the welfare system
as dehumanizing—yet he re-
fuses to support his own
children, thereby forcing
them to depend on welfare
for their survival. (Our
movement is filled with
these so-called leaders who
don't participate in the
care and raising of their
children. We must end this
practice.)

- Publicly "APSP" advo-
cates an end to the oppres-
sion of women—yet Joe
Waller physically brutal-
izes Black women. (The
criminal beating and rap-
ing of Black women in our
movement must be stopped
immediately.)

- Publicly "APSP" advo-
cates Black self-sufficien-
cy—yet Joe Waller and some
other "APSP" members refuse
to work, choosing to ex-

ploit the labor of women
and guilt-ridden white
folks.

- Publicly "APSP" claims
leadership in the Black
Independence Movement—
yet Waller uses his sup-
posed "prestige" as a
means to sexually and econ-
omically exploit African
women, regardless of
their age.

Finally, we support the
legitimate struggle around
Reparations—in all its
forms. However, we do not
support any efforts by Joe
Waller to opportunistically
use the reparation issue to
build his illegitimate or-
ganization.

We vigorously support re-
paration for the mothers
of Waller's six children
who struggle along to pro-
vide financial and emotion-
