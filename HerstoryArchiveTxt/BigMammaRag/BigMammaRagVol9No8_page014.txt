I wanted to pay special at-
tention to the herstory of
the German Women's movement.
There are fascinating and in-
structive parallels between
that movement and the current.
But, as with so many of the
stories of women in different
cultures at different times,
history has been precisely
that - his - and it wasn't
until quite recently that the
German Women's movement was
mentioned with any signifi-
cant depth in books concern-
ing 19th and 20th century
Germany.

From the latter years of
the 19th century the German
women's movement developed
within the context of fight-
ing for rights in several
basic areas, many of which
women continue to struggle
for today - abortion and
birth control, lesbian and
gay rights, divorce and the
right to work at "male" jobs,
abolition of state-run pros-
titution, the vote and inter-
national peace.

Several factors combined to
crush the effective political
struggle by the radical
groups within the movement.
Briefly, the four major fac-
tors which silenced the wo-
men's movement in its strug-
gle for change in the defini-
tion of women's place in
society were:

1) The First World War and
the consequent demand for a
population increase.

2) Germany's defeat in the
War, which heightened and ac-
celerated the already exist-
ing movement towards the
right of the political spec-
trum.

3) The shambles of the eco-
nomy after the war; incredi-
ble inflation meant that
pounds of money (literally)
were necessary to buy a stick
of butter.

4) Other women. Along with
the rest of the country, many
if not most women actively or
passively (by their silence)
accepted the four stranded
ideology which would soon
lead to fascism: militarism,
nationalism, imperialism/
racism/anti-Semitism, and
the marriage of corporate

interest and the state.

The Bund Deutscher Frauen-
vereine (BDF) was an umbrella
organization and it acted as
the major voice for all of
the smaller women's organiza-
tions (ranging politically
from conservative to liberal)
that belonged to the BDF. The
BDF was one of the most ac-
tive participants in the pro-
cess of shutting out and si-
lencing the radical women's
groups who would not accept
the sexual status quo.

In fact, the BDF, which ap-
pealed to large numbers of
women, had already done a
good deal of the Nazis' work
before they came to power in
1933. Why? First, the women
of the BDF were as infected
by the romantic myth of Ger-
manic nationalism as anyone
else. By 1919 for example,
the BDF was fighting against
abortion rights in the inter-
ests of repopulating the mil-
itary machine. Second, the
BDF membership was for the
most part white and middle
class, and as such was fairly
insensitive to the needs of
the lower class, many of whom
like the bored University
students would become ardent
supporters of the Nazi Party.
The women of the BDF were
continually coerced into mis-
believing in their quest for
human rights by extremely po-
tent propaganda persuading
them that their true "femi-
nine nature" could only find
fulfillment through repopu-
lating the state and caring
for its men. Finally, the
women of the BDF were incre-
dibly anti-Semitic. They were
fearful of the damage that
the label "Jew-Lover" could
do to their political strug-
gles, as well as being thor-
oughly infected by the German/
European cultural heritage,
that heritage of hate towards
the Jewish people who had his-
torically been the anti-
Christ, the stereotypic mon-
eylender, etc., responsible
for the ills of Eurocentric
Christian societies.

This again is perhaps par-
alleled by the white middle
class nature of the contem-
porary American women's move-
ment and its difficulties in
confronting homophobic, rac-
ist and classist assumptions.

work among the factions of
the left. The war resulted in
a brutalization of white Eur-
opean consciousness and it
brought racist, sexual and
sex-role frustration to a
head.

An extensive homosexual
rights movement and a flour-
ishing lesbian culture also
existed in Germany during the
first quarter of the 20th
century. This also vanished
when the Nazis came to power
and enforced existing anti-
homosexual legal codes. Re-

cently, a bill prohibiting
the use of government funds
to promote, defend or protect
homosexuality passed the
House of Representatives by
157 votes.

The Nazis also campaigned
strenuously against abortion -
when it was women of "pure
blood" who sought them. In
the Weimar era the penalty
for abortion - getting or
giving one - was 40 marks.
The Nazi courts enforced a
6-15 year imprisonment in
concentration camps as a pen-
alty for giving a "truly Ger-
manic" woman an abortion.
Because Jewish women and wo-
men of the (Nazi-designated)
"lesser races" were inferior
and hence expendable it was
acceptable to the Nazi mind
to murder women during a hor-
rific series of experiments
designed to develop fast, ef-
fective sterilization and a-
bortion procedures so that a
slave labor population could
be maintained. Any German
woman who miscarried often
had to prove that she had not
had an abortion. This night-
mare could be a very real
consequence of the HLA (Human
Life Amendment) - surveillance
on our wombs could become a
reality if the dictates of

Nazi propaganda directed at
women included an intense me-
dia campaign of images of the
blond, blue-eyed mother sur-
rounded by children
fostering racist paranoia
through the use of stereo-
types, and motherhood medals -
bronze for three children,
silver for more than five,
and a gold for more than
eight. "Aryan" women were to
be the soldiers fighting for
German racial purity on the

homefront. Heinrich Himmler,
chief of the S.S., once made
the statement: "Every war in-
volves a tremendous letting
of the best blood. Many vic-
tories won by the force of
arms have been a shattering
defeat for a nation's vitality
and blood...it will be the
high duty of German women and
girls of good blood to become
the mothers."

As already mentioned, there
was very little organized re-
sistance by women during the
1920s when the Nazi Party
built the structure on which
it would make its grab for
control of the country. German

society had been extremely
hostile to the women's move-
ment from its inception. In
addition, the BDF had begun
moving towards a rightist
ideology before World War I.
By the end of the war the
most radical women's organi-
zations had disintegrated.
One of the clearest reasons
for the end of feminism in
Germany during this period
of time was that it focused
on issues that were prima-
rily of interest to white
middle class women. The mem-
bers of the movement gave
