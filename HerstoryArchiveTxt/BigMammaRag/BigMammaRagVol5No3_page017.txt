This is our typesetter to be.

If our friends help us out.

Please send us part of your tax refund.

FOR A LONG TIME WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THE NEED TO BE TECHNICALLY INDEPENDENT IN ORDER
TO BE SELF-SUPPORTING AND SURVIVE. PHOTOTYPESETTING WILL BE NEATER AND MORE VERSATILE,
LOOK BETTER AND COST LESS IN THE END THAN OUR CURRENT METHOD. OWNERSHIP OF THIS MACHINE
WILL ALSO BE AN ASSET TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE BOTH AS A TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCE AND AS
A MONEY-GENERATING PROJECT.
