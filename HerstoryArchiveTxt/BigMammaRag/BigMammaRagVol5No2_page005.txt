**Senin Year Brings Some Change**  
**Feminist Therapists Convene**  

By Kathy Riley  

The Women's Institute of Alternative  
Psychotherapy (WIAP) held its  
second annual conference in Boulder  
Jan. 28-30, drawing nearly 450 women  
for a weekend of workshops, topped  
with a concert by Cris Williamson,  
Jackie Robbins and June Millington.  

This year's registration surpassed  
last year's turnout of 350 primarily  
because 100 participants received  
reduced fees or bartered their admission  
for services at the conference.  

Fees were a key issue last year.  
(See March, 1976 Bur). At that time,  
WIAP was criticized for adopting a  
rigid $40 across-the-board fee which  
made the conference inaccessible to  
paraprofessionals and non-salaried  
women doing political work around  
feminist therapy.  

According to a printed WIAP budget  
sheet distributed to all participants,  
the $2,000 in surplus funds from last  
year's conference covered reduced  
fees for 49 women. Another 30 bar-  
tered services for the fee.  

WIAP Coordinator Marilyn Webb said  
women who sought reduced fees were  
given what they asked for—"and most  
needed the full fee." However, women  
were not asked about their economic  
circumstances; therefore, it is not  
known how many of those who received  
reductions were paraprofessionals or  
political workers.  

Webb also said that after the  
$2,000 surplus was used up, partici-  
pants were offered a barter rate of  
$4.00 per hour for a variety of con-  
ference work, such as conducting  
workshops, videotaping, child care  
and office work.  

To ALL Women IN Prison:  
We have heard that some women in prison who subscribe to Ain't Mama Rag  
are not getting the paper.  

One of the criticisms made last  
year by the Boulder Women's Health  
Group, whose members were denied  
free admission in return for preparing  
a workshop, was that bartering  
was accepted only through the “traditional female role” of childcare.  

Like last year, the conference  
produced a profit this year—this  
time from ticket sales to the Satur-  
day evening Cris Williamson concert.  
Ticket prices were included in the  
$45 registration fee for conference  
participants, but the concert was  
also well-attended by Denver and  
Boulder women who paid $4.00 to $4.50  
per ticket.  

Webb said that WIAP made $2,900  
on the concert, which will be put back  
into the conference and the school;  
the WIAP membership will decide what  
happens to that money, but no deci-  
sion has been made yet.  

The concert drew some criticism  
at a Saturday plenary session, when  
several participants questioned why  
WIAP had paid $2,600 to Cris William-  
son, when other speakers received  
$200 honorariums plus travel expenses.  
A WIAP representative at the ses-  
sion said that the Williamson fee  
covered about eight people—the  
musicians and their co-workers in

Prison authorities have officially banned  
all gay publications from federal prisons, and evidently they are labeling us a gay newspaper.  
Do you know any women who aren't?  
Thank you.  

Are you receiving your paper?  
Please write us and tell us any information you have.  
We need all the information to be able to fight this.  

Where we're at right this moment is several inches off the AM floor.  
A woman gave us a huge donation for the typesetting machine, and now,  
as you can see on the back cover, we are over halfway there. Many  
women have given us money, but of course, we still need more to make the  
machine a reality.  

As the back cover suggests, maybe you could send us your tax refunds or rebates for the cause.  

We have nothing but thanks  
for all the women who have given us money in this effort.  
We asked for feedback on the last issue and got tantamount to nothing.  
Now, we're serious; we want to know what your thoughts are about our  
double issues.  

This issue is crammed with features for International Women's Day.  
We want to know that our effort does not go into a void.  

With the typesetter becoming evermore a reality for us, we are more and  
more inspired to give you higher quality.  

We want to give you all the  
best we can; we cannot know how we're doing without your comments, however.  

Things are indeed looking up for us.  
If you are interested in joining the collective,  
and a better quality paper for you, dear reader,  
give us a call or come on down.  

A book of articles, poetry and graphics exploring the lives and thoughts of women who are  
incarcerated in one of the most repressive prison systems in this country. The authors want this  
book to be used to show the people of this country how it is for women behind bars, now, and to  
inspire us to change not only the intolerable conditions that characterize prisons, but the society  
that allows them to exist.  

All profits from the book go to the women who wrote it.

**Ain't Mama Rag Vol. 5 No. 2**  

**Film Tells Battered Wife’s Story**  

Theresa Schook  

Concern over battered wives is be-  
coming more and more evident in the  
media. Channel 4 recently did a half  
hour special report on them. More  
and more articles are being printed  
in feminist papers throughout the  
country. Mary Hartman's best friend  
Pat is facing charges of murdering  
a husband who beat her.  

In keeping with this trend, a local  
group, the Western States Film Insti-  
tute, is presently working on a pro-  
ject. Western States is the newly  
reorganized film center of Sebastian  
House on York Street. Its main  
founders are Bonnie Trumbule, Gerald  
Trumbule, and Sheila Fortune. They  
first became interested in doing the  
film when they were approached by  
people from the York Street Center.  

Caught by the idea, Bonnie Trumbule  
remembered a woman she had met sever-  
al months earlier who had told her  
about being beaten. This woman had  
finally left her husband and made an  
entirely new life for herself. Bonnie  
got in touch with the woman, and the  
three sat and taped several hours of  
conversations with her. The film is  
a dramatization of her life.  

They obtained funding from the Co-  
lorado Humanities Program to write  
their script. This grant paid for  
the research and full-time writing  
that went into the project.  

The film is titled "Gloria," a 16mm  
color film that lasts one half hour.  
The basic plot of the story is the  
twenty-four hours before she finally  
leaves forever. The beatings and  
past are told through flashbacks.  
They plan on actually showing the  
violence involved, rather than hav-  
ing someone tell about her broken  
bones.  

The original woman left her home  
knowing nothing about how to support  
herself and with extremely low self-  
image. She came to Denver, went to  
welding school, and is now a profes-  
sional welder. It is a success story,  
and Western States Film wants to  
emphasize that success.  

Bonnie is very excited about the  
possibilities the film offers. They  
plan on using it as a tool for local  
organizing around the issue. They  
have discussed the possibility of  
taking the film to areas where tele-  
vision doesn't reach, small towns  
throughout Colorado and showing it  
to women who would not otherwise see  
it. They would like to show the  
film on daytime television, to reach  
the women who need to be reached, the  
women whose husbands' fists control  
the television set at night. They  
hope the film will inspire action in  
the community (Denver has no battered  
wives center).  

Actual filming has not yet begun;  
the funding wavered, however more  
money seems to be coming through.  
The projected end of filming is some-  
time near the end of March, with all  
processing finished by June.  

It is a large project and they are  
committed to inciting community ac-  
tion. Why not start organizing be-  
fore the film is available?  

**Single Mothers To Fight Rent Increase**  

Therese de Leary  

The women who live at Warren Village,  
an apartment building for single par-  
ents located in Capitol Hill, are  
currently faced with a rent increase  
that could force many of the women to  
move.  

Many of the residents are taking  
action against the Warren Village  
Board of Trustees in order to stop the  
rent hike and keep Warren Village a  
place for low to moderate income, one-  
parent families.  

In June of '71 the trustees of Warren  
United Methodist Church donated land  
between 13th and 14th avenues on Gil-  
pin to the non-profit, non-sectarian  
corporation for construction of Warren  
Village. The entire structure was fin-  
anced under the provisions of the 1968  
Housing Act. Thus, the mortgage inter-  
est rate is subsidized by the US Dept.  
of Housing and Urban Development,  
providing rents “somewhat" below con-  
ventional rates. (The corporation  
currently bases a substantial amount  
of its income on grants and donations.)  
Warren Village is governed by a Board  
of Trustees comprised of "interested"  
business, religious and neighborhood  
"leaders."  

The apartments themselves are com-  
prised of 96 1, 2, and 3 bedroom apart-  
ments with singly-headed families  
ranging in size from 2 to 5 people.  

The Learning Center houses the bottom  
floor of the building to provide oppor-  
tunity for the residents to seek em-  
ployment or continue education and, at  
present, is licensed to care for 100  
children. Tuition varies according to  
income and eligibility for Social  
Security assistance; scholarship assis-  
tance is also available on the basis  
of need.  

To move into Warren Village one must  
be a single parent, making 95% of the  
residents women. You must apply either  
through welfare or social services to  
Warren Village. An income statement is  
necessary along with a personal inter-  
view. The results of both of these is  
submitted to an apartment committee  
and you are either accepted or reject-  
ed. Rent is determined in compliance  
with the Federal guidelines; 236 pro-  
jects are subject to income which, if  
not on welfare, can be as much as, or  
more than, conventional housing with  
all the stipulations of the complex.  

The purpose of Warren Village as  
stated is "to create a setting in  
which low-moderate income, one-parent  
families can develop or re-develop  
their capabilities for productive and  
rewarding participation in the main-  
stream of our society. To provide  
services to one-parent families so  
they may move from public dependency  
to becoming economically self-suffi-  
cient families." It was once stated that  
“Warren Village ran under the auspices  
of a half-way house for women in  
transition."  

Presently there is a dilemma which  
could force a good number of occupants  
to move to sub-quality housing and/or  
projects. The Board of Trustees has  
proposed and instituted into this  
year's fiscal budget a rent increase  
of 5% to be effective July 1977, one  
year exactly after a previous substan-  
tial increase. In dollars and cents  
this would mean anywhere from approx-  
imately $5 to $10.  

To women here on a fixed income  
this could mean having to move, chan-  
ging Warren Village from what it was  
meant to be into middle income housing  
with stipulations (single-parents).  
To be a single woman with children is  
not easy in itself as is being a  
woman in a male-oriented world, but  
to combine the two can provoke a frus-  
tration bordering hopelessness. The  
circumstances for this rent increase  
have been labeled “an increase in  
operational costs pinpointing it to  
utilities. An interesting point to  
note is that enshrined in the budget  
is an executive director's salary  
and expenses that amount to $41,000,  
a director whose main purpose for  
being is to raise money.  

About the only avenue available to  
prevent this from happening is to  
submit personal complaints to the  
Federal Housing Authority/Housing and  
Urban Development at 909 17th St.,  
Denver. They must approve the in-  
crease. Most of the responsibility  
lies on the residents of Warren Vil-  
lage, but public opinion could help.  
All will be appreciated.
