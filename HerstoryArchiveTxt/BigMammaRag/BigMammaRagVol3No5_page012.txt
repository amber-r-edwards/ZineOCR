While we wait.

Linda Fowler

We are hanging on for dear life to the tail of a rampaging
tiger. And right now I wouldn’t be into taking any bets on the out
come.

Big Mama has grown faster than we, the staff, and our
resources have. She has become Denver's feminist communica-
tion institution and one of the major feminist publications in this
country. The amount of work coming into this office increases
every day. More letters, paperwork, phone calls - half the time you
can’t work for answering the phone. (This is one of the few places
Denver women can get information and help they need; would
someone please organize a feminist switchboard?)

The women’s movement in Denver is mushrooming.
Keeping up with happenings that need to be covered is
impossible. Writers! We need writers! If you can write, or think
maybe you can write, or want to learn and can do something on
assignment - cover a story, work on researching and writing a
feature - call us and do it.

Maybe you don’t want to write, or don’t have time to write,
or don’t want to be a big part of BMR, but you still care about the
paper. Well, if you don’t mind shit work, there is plenty. Come in
for an hour and file - the backlog will amaze you. Take a mailing to
the post office. Do a little typing. Stay at home and clip articles
from newspapers for our resource library. Help put up posters.
Ask a store you know to sell the paper.

Money! Oh woe! Our money situation is so questionable
that we don’t often know for sure if the next issue will come out.
We need $1,000 a month to publish this paper. And rest assured
no one is getting rich on it. The two paid coordinators get $125
per month each. That's less than $1 per hour for a forty-hour week,
a luxury we rarely get. It’s impossible to make it on that kind of
pay without a little help from your friends. Big Mama needs about
five full-time paid staffers to do the job right, PLUS lots of
contributors. To everyone who has ever said Big Mama is a good
newspaper and you're glad she’s here, we are saying please, put
your money where your mouth is. If every woman who reads this
paper gave $1 a month we would not have money problems. For
that $1 a month you can give something to an awful lot of sisters.
Make a pledge. Do it!

When you’re moving as fast as you can go, and there is
always more work to do, and you get more behind, and you
wonder who cares you can start to get depressed. That's bad for
the soul and it doesn’t do Mama any good either.

Lady, your Mama’s here, and she loves you. And she
needs you. Take care of her. Won’t you?

Workshops:

From Guilt to Responsibility

Carol Lease

Sexuality is a part of
women's lives that has been
denied and repressed to serve
the needs of the dominant
economic, cultural and social
system. The sexual revolution
has been a fraud, especially to
women, but the experience of
women has raised serious
questions and exposed needs
and women are now doing
something about it. One place
in Denver that a woman can
deal with her sexuality is at a
Human Sexuality workshop
conducted by Jean Fortier, a
member of the staff of the
Gestalt Institute in Denver.

“A lot of what happens to
women is that we grow up like
child-women and not like
adults,” Fortier says. “Women
must realize that they don’t
need permission to be angry
and that they don’t have to
spend the rest of their lives
hating men.

“Women are sexual beings.
We have to realize that it is
alright to say no, to have
orgasms, to know about our
bodies.”

Fortier feels that many
women, whether homosexual
or heterosexual, are centered
around making the other
person feel good instead of
making joy for the self. “It
may be that women don’t feel
worth, and hence won’t allow
themselves pleasure.” It isn’t
hard to understand this since
women grow up with such an
enormous amount of myths,
some of which deal with
menstruation, beauty, the “joy
of martyrdom,” self-sacrifice,
passivity.

The participants in the
sexuality workshops share
what each has learned about
sex while growing up and
“reparent” themselves with
positive sex attitudes. They
also need to get in touch with
and become responsible for
their sexuality, says the
therapist. “Giving people the
permission to talk about their
sexuality gives them permis-
sion to talk about who they
are.” It is also important to
show people that “they are not
responsible for their feelings
but are responsible for what
they do about their feelings.
It's OK to get turned on by
someone or something. What
matters is what you do about
it.”
The sexuality classes will
hopefully begin to be held in
the community so they can
help para-professional or pro-
fessional people deal with
their sexuality and therefore
their clients’. The Institute is
now working on a form to
send to Denver area sex
therapists to find what their
values are and make that
available to the community.

An example of the resist-
ance displayed toward the entire
idea of sexuality discussion
has been shown by Denver
General Hospital, according
to Fortier. Sexuality work-
shops are being held at DGH
for staff people of the Family
Planning Clinic. It seems that
the clinic works with family
planning and nobody knows
about sex. An important
aspect of the workshop is for
each staff member to be able
to bring a “significant other”
to the workshop. But the
administration said no and so
by not allowing this bond,
sexuality and work are kept
separate, says Fortier. “This
creates a compartmentaliza-
tion of their existence,” and
the program would then seem
to be at a disadvantage.

Jean Fortier is involved in
the humanistic approach to
self-growth. She works with
women's Gestalt and human
sexuality groups. She can be
reached at the Gestalt Insti-
tute, 831-7731.

Side Effects
of the Pill

The most serious side ef-
fects of the pill include:
thromboembolism, or blood
clotting: Estrogen in the pill
may cause unnecessary clot
forms within a blood vessel,
obstructing the flow of blood
and starving body tissue.
Thromboembolism can have
serious and even fatal con-
sequences.

Strokes: Estrogen in the
pill causes blood pressure to
increase in susceptible wo-
men. High blood pressure
increases the chance of a
stroke, which is the rupture of
a blood vessel leading to or
from the brain. Severe, debili-
tating headache is a stroke
symptom. If severe headache
is experienced when taking
the pill, a doctor should be
consulted to rule out the
possibility of stroke.

Women should NEVER take
the pill if they have or have
ever had thromboembolism,
thrombophlebitis, pulmonary
embolism, a stroke, retinal
thrombosis, heart disease or
defect, severe endocrine dis-
order, recurrent jaundice of
pregnancy, or any form of
cancer.

Nuisance effects of the pill
are many. They include
nausea, fluid retention,
weight gain, giant freckles on
the face, excessive vaginal
discharge, changes in facial
or body hair, mood changes,
fatigue, oily scalp and skin,
breast enlargement, break-
through bleeding, yeast or
fungus infections, and other
metabolic side effects.
