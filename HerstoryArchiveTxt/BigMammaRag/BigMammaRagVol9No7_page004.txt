local

Feminist Bookcenter To Deal With Its

member must agree with this
priority.

4) The store must immediately
become the hub of the women's
community. This can be accom-
plished by: 1) being open at
least 6 days a week, 2) ini-
tiating events representative
of all groups, 3) being a wel-
come and supportive place for
all women, 4) offering a for-
um for various ideas, 5) pur-
suing a vigorous outreach
program ... (or in other
words) .... becoming "visible."

5) Each member of the collec-
tive must join in the strug-
gle for a definition of fem-
inism that includes rather
than excludes. Feminist
thought must include radical
feminists, socialist femi-
nists, Third World feminists,
and liberation struggles if
it is to incorporate all
women.

6) Woman to Woman must serve
the women's community by
ensuring: continuity of in-
formation sharing and ser-
vices. This can be accom-
plished through: 1) maintain-
ing a closed collective which
a) requires a time specific
and consistent commitment
from members, b) provides
training and support to po-
tential members, c) and ac-
tively searches for members
from groups now excluded.

2) Communication could be en-
hanced by the active empower-
ment of women of color on the
collective. 3) Effective and
consistent communication must
be carried out in order for
the Center to become a dy-
namic force in the women's
community. Continuity in
providing services could best
be accomplished by the avail-
ability of paid staffers.
This continuity would also
be enhanced by requiring two
staffers at all times and
three telephone lines.

The paid staffers would
facilitate the implementation
of these demands. The women
hired would know that there
would be an evaluation of
this policy at the end of six
months. If the goals put
forth in these demands have
not been addressed, then
another policy may need to
be implemented. The employed
staffers would be members of
the collective and would
know, on a continuing basis,
the feelings and attitudes
of the entire collective
concerning this policy.

The jobs of the paid staf-
fers would be rotated through-
out the community with equal
opportunity being given to
women of color and Jewish
women. In order to ensure
equal opportunity it may be
necessary to give priority
to women of color and Jewish
women until such time as the
Center becomes an actively
welcome place for these
women.

7) Committees or work groups
formed from collective mem-
bers should be organized on
a power sharing basis. If
only one person is on a work
group the whole collective
should recognize that this
is a dangerous situation for
the collective as well as the
community. One person in a
work group will by nature,
either consciously or uncon-
sciously, exclude and inval-
idate different women's ideo-
logies. The job of any work
group is just too big, too
complex and touches too many
women's lives to be the res-
ponsibility of one woman. We
therefore need to actively
solicit members to join the
work groups. Major work
groups should be:

A) OUTREACH (soliciting in-
formation from other groups;
providing lit tables; re-
questing groups to order and
review books; bring informa-
tion from outside groups in-
to the bookstore, and pro-
viding information in the
store about what other groups
are doing).

B) PUBLICITY (public service
announcements, newsletter,
space for meetings - letting
people know the services we
offer).

C) FINANCES (providing infor-
mation about financial pol-
icy, providing reports to
the collective and the com-
munity about the financial
status of the store, paying
bills, and maintaining under-
standable financial records).

D) SOCIAL ACTIVITIES (initi-
ating activities such as
films, discussion groups,
support groups and other
social activities which can
bring women together).

E) MAINTENANCE (maintaining
a clear, inviting environ-
ment, and ensuring that re-
pairs are made).

F) ORDERING (NON-BOOK) (mak-
ing a rational policy, open
to the public on what should
be carried in the store, then
ordering and maintaining
those items).

G) BOOK ORDERING (see #8 be-
low). H) LIBRARY

I) CLOTHING EXCHANGE

8. Book ordering procedure.
A) There should be a com-
mittee to order books. This
will allow different views
and ideas to be represented.
B) Books should cover a wide
range of topics relating to
women's issues. These should
include positive images of
women and children in the
areas of sexuality, culture,
work, fiction, psychology,
biographies, sociology, pol-
itical theory, lesbian mot-
hers, family, creativity and
the arts, self-help, contro-
versial issues, law, poetry,
philosophy, women of color
and Jewish women. We should
try to concentrate on the
issues that isolate women
from each other thereby pro-
viding support for each other
in our individual yet common
struggles.
C) The shelf list should
represent - equally - the
struggles of all women in
various aspects of their
lives.
D) The books should be inte-
grated throughout the shelves.
Women's lives and struggles
are not segmented as currently
represented on the shelves.
Books relating to Third World
people need not only be on a
Third World shelf.
E) The review policy should
be changed to involve the
community. Books would be
put on the shelves without
necessarily being previously
reviewed by collective mem-
bers. We would solicit women
from the community to help
us review the books. This
would enable the community
to be an active part of the
bookstore and would not all-
ow the bookstore to become
stagnant and narrow-minded in
its book ordering.
F) Censorship in the areas of
racism, sexism and classism
would continue. A section on
controversial topics would be
maintained and we would soli-
cit response from the com-
munity on whether to keep them
in the store. We should not
discourage women from obtain-
ing information that is per-
tinent to their lives.
G) Books should be ordered be-
cause of the information they
contain, this may necessitate
that we order books written
by men. Some subjects are so
important that any informa-
tion is welcome and having
them missing from the store
hurts us all.
9. The store must become
accountable to the community
by: 1) holding open monthly
meetings; 2) ordering and
mail ordering books requested
by women; 3) providing a
newsletter; 4) searching for
a cleaner, larger site; 5)
providing published points
of unity; 6) having a shelf
list; 7) providing reviews
and information about the
books we carry; 8) making
accessible financial and book
ordering information; 9) pro-
viding set business hours;
10) conducting the store like
a business; 11) searching out
and providing accurate infor-
mation about other groups
and activities including
community activities, libera-
tion struggles, jobs, etc.

Racism And Anti-Semitism

12) being consistent by ad-
hering to our points of uni-
ty; 13) responding to our
correspondence.

10. Other services should
also be provided to women.
These include: a) a switch-
board which provides accurate
information; b) networking
information and c) resource
exchange information.

All women present discussed
the issues that were presented
in the paper and demands. They
went through the points and
at Point 6 they decided that
two groups of women should
meet immediately afterwards;
one group to deal with an al-
ternative to a paid staffer
and the other group to prepare
a budget to find money for
paying a staffwoman. Another
meeting was scheduled for
June 18.

On June 18 the meeting was
chaired by a woman of color
who requested that everyone in
the room talk about what they
were feeling. Most everyone
there said that they thought,
on the whole, it was necessary
to acknowledge that changes
had to be made so that the
center would be a real place
for women to come and not feel
left out or put down and that
the changes, as listed in the
demands, for the most part,
would be supported. Point 6,
the issue of a paid staffer,
was by far the one that most
women were upset about and the
group that wrote the paper on
alternatives read that paper.

The paper on alternatives
was heard and denounced by the
women present. The paper it-
self, the women felt, was ra-
cist. Criticism was made that
the wording, which referred to
women of color, but did not
mention Jewish women was a ra-
cist, anti-Semitic act unto
itself. Women were angry that
the group who wrote the alter-
natives had a hand-written
paper that was not distributed
around the room. The women
said that had happened because
they were pressed for time.
They apologized for not in-
cluding "Jewish women" when
they addressed women of color
but it was pointed out that
they never addressed Jewish
women throughout the paper and
that women of color and Jewish
women who wrote the paper had
made a point of having typed
copies of both their paper and
their demands available for
everyone to have and they too
had been pressed for time.

The paper, which made frequ-
ent use of the word empower-
ment sounded as if white women
would give power, let women of
color learn how to function in
positions of power in the cen-
ter. The alternatives present-
ed in the paper was the struc-
ture that already existed at
the center but explicitly in-
cluded women of color. One
section dealing with outreach
would have had women of color
as the group that would do the
outreach and women of color
felt that, again, they would
have to do the work of white
women to combat their racism.
Also mention was made of the
time that the center funded
some women of color to attend
a conference in San Francisco.
This was denounced by women
of color and Jewish women who
felt that the women were very
minimally funded and that
hassles occurred when the women
returned from the conference
and the racism of that had
never been dealt with.

Women of color and Jewish
women felt that having a paid
staffer was not the best al-
ternative to have in order to
keep the center open, but it
was the only practical method
that they could think of. Oth-
er women did not come up with
anything better and women who
fought against the idea be-
cause of political experience
didn't have any suggestions.
The politics of such an act
was discussed but in the end
it was decided that money would
have to be raised to pay a
staffer and give the plan a
chance. Pledges were made by
many women, not only to give
a monthly amount but also
for fundraising.

Women who would have staf-
fed the center said they
couldn't do so, because as
things stood, they didn't
know the politics of the
center, and many women felt
the center should be closed
temporarily until the group
had formed and could put the
politics out for the commun-
ity to see. Other women, re-
alizing the need for money
felt the center should stay
open, also feeling that wom-
en in the community had come
to depend on the services and
would be let down if those
services weren't available.
Women of color and Jewish wo-
men felt that those services
weren't made available to
everyone. It was decided that
the center would be closed
for one week, hopefully.
Meetings were scheduled for
Saturday and Monday through
Friday to work out the nec-
essary politics.

As of press time, the group
of women meeting plan to open
the center on July 1. Local
women are urged to call the
center to make sure, call
320-5972.

Analysis

Woman to Woman Feminist
Bookcenter was opened nearly
six years ago by a collective
of a small group of rad-
ical feminists. Over a per-
iod of time the center had
evolved from radical femin-
ists as a collective who had
points of unity to larger
collectives that did not re-
quire women to identify
themselves as feminists, al-
though the word was used in
the title and in ads. Some-
where along the way the
points of unity were dropped
and it was a laughable sub-
ject if you were considered

bmr: where we're at

will miss them. Now the good news, Bobbe has rejoined the.

In this issue, we devoted a lot of space to "local" pro-
jects and the conflicts we're going through here. The iss-
ues of racism, anti-Semitism and collective process in fem-
inist projects affect us all. By airing them in the paper,
we hope we can get dialog going nationally around how other
projects have been working and share strategies for creating
a poly-cultural, anti-racist, anti-classist movement.

Appropriately, next month we are having the "State of
the Women's Movement" as our theme. Deadline for submis-
sions is July 15. In August we are taking a leave of ab-
sence so you won't be receiving a September issue.

Also, you may notice that there is no "Resources" page
this month. Due to space limitations, lack of money to
print more pages and poor planning we didn't have room. How-
ever, next month "Resources" will be back in the paper.

We have some good and some bad news this month about
BMR. First the bad news, Connie and Vicki have changed
their mind and have decided to move away from Denver. We

collective. She was on the paper a couple of years ago, and
has finally decided, after working as a supporter for most
of those years, to jump into the thick again. Production

isn't that bad, is it Bobbe?

We completely remodeled the front room of the office this
month (read rearranged the furniture). What an improvement,
not only in efficient working space, but in our morale and
comfort. While cleaning the office, we decided to reduce

the number of back issues we keep, so if you want a speci-
fic back issue, such as “Women and Work", "Dependences",
the 2 "Health" issues, better send for them while
Back issues are $1 each.

Last month at the People's Fair a good time was had by
all. BMR managed to earn a little money to help out the
ever-increasing financial morass. Much of our success at
the fair was due to the work of Dona Calacone, who got the

t-shirts together for us. Thank you Dona.
