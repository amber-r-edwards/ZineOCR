Anti-Semitism In Women's Movement

Women Against Imperialism

Recently, there has been
much discussion in the wo-
men's movement and the wo-
men's press all over the
country about anti-Semitism.
We are an organization of an-
ti-imperialist women; many of
us are Jewish. We are very

disturbed at the growing ten-
dency to use the issue of an-
ti-Semitism to justify Zion-
ism and the colonization of
the Palestinian people. We
disagree with the way the op-
pression of Jews in America
is being equated with the op-
pression of Black, Puerto Rican, Chicano-Mexicano and Native American peo-
ples. We want to address
these issues because we think
the women's movement must
take a stand in solidarity
with the Palestinian revol-
ution and with the national
liberation struggles of col-
onized third world people in-
side the United States.

Today anti-Semitism is gro-
wing along with the rise of
the right. During the 1940's,
genocide was committed aga-
inst 6 million Jews. As Euro-
pean fascism systematically
carried out one of the worst
crimes in history, most of
the world watched, silent and
inactive. These facts are ab-
horrent and very real--but we
feel that the conclusions
many people are drawing from
these experiences are wrong
and dangerous.

There is a growing tendency
in the women's movement to
say that Jewish women are
"Third World" or at least not
white. This ignores the fact
that Jewish people in Ameri-
ca, despite anti-Semitism,
are part of a white suprema-
cist social order that holds
down Black, Chicano-Mexicano,
Native American and Puerto
Rican peoples. The basis of
American society is that the
US, like South Africa, is a
white settler colony, founded
on genocide and theft of Na-
tive American and Mexican
land and on the forced labor
of Black people in the South.
From the beginning, coloni-
zed third world peoples have
been subject to a system of
laws, police, prisons, educa-
tion, health, and white su-

colonized people who have
been here for hundreds of ye-
ars are held perpetually at
the very bottom.

Today we are seeing an up-
surge in white supremacy. The
US's worldwide empire is in
crisis, having lost power and
resources from Iran and Zim-
babwe. The US imperialist
strategy is to force third
world people to bear the bru-
nt of the crisis, which tran-
slates into astronomical ra-
tes of unemployment, infant
mortality and so on in third
world communities. This white
supremacist strategy is being
enthusiastically supported by
large sectors of the white
population, which is why we
see mass reactionary moveme-
nts around issues like crime,
the death penalty and tax
revolts. When colonized peo-
ple resist, the police, the
Klan, and the law and order
movement are there to keep
them in their place. This is
why colonized people are be-
ing put in concentration
camps (prisons); why revolut-
ionary leaders of the Puerto
Rican, Chicano-Mexicano, and
Black liberation movements
are being interned through
Grand Juries; why 2000 third
world people were murdered by
the police in the last five
years; why Black peoples'
homes are shot into and their
children murdered by the Klan.
The goal is to contain the
development of national lib-
eration movements struggling
for independence, socialism,
and human rights--the strat-
egy is genocide. For Jews and
for all of us who know that
genocide is not just a word,
it is critical to recognize
that it is colonized people
not Jews who face genocide in
the US today.

America's general shift to
the right is also showing up
in the Jewish community, des-
pite a tradition of leftism.

Thousands of Jews are joining
anti-busing organizations
like BUS-STOP, or voting for
Reagan because of his support
for Israel. On the far right,
the JDL is patrolling Jewish
neighborhoods against Black
youth with guard dogs and
guns. Progressive Jews who
oppose these developments can
take our place in the strug-
gle for liberation not by
pretending we are third world
people, but by taking an ac-
tive stand against white
supremacy.

In the women's movement,
equating anti-Semitism with
white supremacy has led in
practice to putting more en-
ergy into the issue of Jewish
oppression than into the much
more basic question of sup-
port for third world liberation str-
uggles. Look at the number of
conferences, meetings and
articles being focused on

anti-Semitism compared to what
has been done on the is-
sues of killer cops, the Klan,
or support for Puerto Rican
or Black POWs. Very often
women say, “those issues can't
be my priority, because it's
not a women's issue." If we
recognize that we as white
women are part of a nation
that is colonizing people in
the US and around the world,
then how can we say it's not
our responsibility to act?

OPPOSE ZIONISM: SOLIDARITY
WITH PALESTINE

Progressive Jewish women
and the women's movement as a
whole must take a stand on
the question of Palestine and
Israel. We can't cop out by
saying it's just too confus-
ing. The issue must be taken
head on, without allowing
charges of anti-Semitism to
cloud our view of what Zion-
ism is really about.

Zionist "Israel" was carved
in blood from the homeland of
the Palestinian people, who
were displaced in the mil-
lions through a process of
terror and genocide. Since
the beginning of the Israeli
colonization, the Palestinian
people have fought to regain
their land and destiny as a
nation. The Zionist state of
Israel could not exist with-
out the backing of US imper-
ialism, which has built Is-
rael into a bastion of white
supremacy throughout the
world. The Jewish settlers in
Israel play the same role as
whites in South Africa. Is-
rael gives military aid to
South Africa and the fascist
junta in Guatemala; it sup-
ported the Somoza regime in
Nicaragua, the puppet regime
in South Viet Nam, and sup-
ports Pinochet's rule in
Chile. This situation cannot
be brushed off by blaming the
right wing policies of Isra-
eli Prime Minister Begin. It
is not the particular admin-
istration that is in quest-
ion, but the basic right of
Israel to exist. As long as
Israel's right to exist is
accepted, so is the coloniz-
ation and genocide of the
Palestinian people.

Many Jewish women and other
leftists hold the view that
Zionism can be humanized,
that "the Israelis and Pales-
tinians just need to work out
their problems." This view
ignores the reality that the
Palestinians have the only
legitimate claim to the land
and that the Israelis invaded
