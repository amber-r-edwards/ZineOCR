New Afrikan Movement & Its —"

is very small and most of
its actions have been of a
propagandistic nature, but
they represent the potential
of revolutionary struggle.
The existence of the BLA

is a daily reminder of the
necessity of revolutionary
violence if we are going to
win. The existence of armed
clandestine organizations
poses, at this point in
history, an ideological
threat to U.S. imperialism
because they are the living
representatives of the only
road to liberation.

The Strategic Importance of
the New Afrikan Independence
Movement

The existence of the New
Afrikan Independence move-
ment challenges the reality
of the United States as one
nation. Joining with the
Puerto Rican independence
movement, the struggle for
the reunification of social-
ist Mexico, the struggle for
sovereignty of Native Ameri-
can nations, this movement
is demanding an end to U.S.
imperialism and self deter-
mination for New Afrika. Na-
tional liberation is the cry
of all oppressed people in
the world. El Salvador, Pal-
estine, Lebanon, and a number
of other nations are engaged
in this life and death bat-
tle today. This world-wide
movement has spread to the
territorial United States
and represents a fundamental
challenge to its continued
existence as we know it.
The forces of national lib-
eration are currently small,
its impact amongst the New
Afrikan people is also small.
This should not be used to
underestimate or to misjudge
its future, for we find our-
selves at the beginning of a
great historical development.

The political activation
of the masses of oppressed
nations within the U.S. will
set in motion a revolutionary
process that will deter-
mine all of our futures. This
is the promise and threat
that the New Afrikan Inde-
pendence movement holds for
U.S. imperialism.

The Role of the Anti-Imper-
ialist Movement

The presence of anti-im-
perialist freedom fighters
Judy Clark and David Gilbert
and political prisoners such
as myself in both the Goshen
and RICO trials is a reflec-
tion of the anti-imperialist
commitment in our movement.
The participation of white
revolutionaries in solidar-
ity with the struggle to

free New Afrika is an ex-
pression of our commitment
to the principle of self-
determination for all opp-
ressed nations. Self-deter-
mination, the right of a
nation to seize control of
their destiny, to free them-
selves from the yoke of im-
perialism, to take back con-
trol of one's natural and
human resources, is a demand
that we must make our own.
Given the presence of inter-
nal and direct colonies of
the United States, respect
for the principle of self
determination is at the core
of our anti-imperialist
struggle. When we built the
anti-war movement, when we
demonstrate in solidarity
with the struggle in Central
America and the Caribbean,
when we support the freedom
fighters in Namibia and
Azania, we are putting into
practice proletarian inter-
nationalism. The recognition
on the part of our movement
that what unites us with the
struggling nations of the
world is our resolve to de-
feat U.S. colonialism and
our rejection of any alli-
ance with the ruling class
based on common identifica-
tion of interests as "Amer-
icans."

We are building a movement
which is not interested in
reforming America. Our move-
ment wants to establish a
new identification, a revol-
utionary ideology that draws
on the history of struggle
of the proletariat of the
world. Our goal is socialism
and that means a rejection
of U.S.
turning of the bourgeoisie
and the liberation of all
oppressed and exploited
people. In this context the
participation of women is
crucial, to ensure the total
mobilization of the white
working class and other re-
volutionary sectors and to
carry out our responsibility
to transform the lives of
white working-class women.
Our liberation is a central
issue for the anti-imperial-
ist movement and must be
raised from the beginning.
We as white women have also
the responsibility to uphold
the same principles that
apply to all movements. Res-
pect for self-determination,

anti-imperialism are not out-

side the struggle for the
liberation of women but
determine the relationship
of our movement to the na-
tional liberation struggles.

Counterinsurgency - the
Strategy of U.S. Imperialism
and Revolutionary Counter-

imperialism, an over:

offensive.

After the attempted expro-
priation on October 20, 1981
the U.S. launched a nation-
wide offensive against the
Black Liberation Army in
particular, the New Afrikan
Independence movement in
general. Rooted in counter-
insurgency, it utilized the
use of the legal system,
both the Grand Jury and Jury
trial; it had a military
component carried out by the
Joint FBI/NYC Police Dept.
Terrorist Task Force; who
for example assaulted 200
strong, a farmhouse in
Birdtown, Mississippi to
arrest 3 New Afrikan adults
and 9 children; used trait-
ors to testify against the
movement and find out its
infrastructure; interrogated
hundreds of people nation-
wide in an effort to dis-
cover not only members of
the BLA but to uncover its
support apparatus, it used
laws originally passed to
prosecute organized crime
such as the Racketeer Influ-
ence and Corrupt Organiza-
tions Statute to convict
captured freedom fighters
and revolutionaries, it
furthered the use of anony-
mous juries and anonymous
witnesses, and used torture
against members of the BLA
to turn them into traitors.

At the heart of counter-
insurgency is the destruc-

tion of a movement. This can
only be accomplished both by
immobilizing the organiza-
tions that are part of the
movement by imprisoning or
assassinating its leader-
ship, as in the case of
Comrade Mtayari Shabaka
Sundiata murdered in cold
blood on October 23, 1981,
demobilizing the membership
and isolating the movement
from its base of support.
This last point is particu-
larly important because no
movement can survive with-
out the continued involve-
ment of people, the support
and encouragement they re-
ceive in the community.
Calling those of us on trial
"thugs" and "cold-blooded
murderers" and the portrayal
of us as "criminals" was for
this purpose. If the revolu-
tionaries are portrayed as
terrorists then any repres-
sion that the enemy uses
becomes justified. There is
nothing new about this - it
has been used by U.S. Imper-
ialism in Vietnam, Zimbabwe,
Namibia, El Salvador, and now
Grenada. The oppressor is
transformed into the liber-
ator and the freedom fighter
becomes by definition the
enemy of the people. Every-
thing is done to emphasize
this view: the media is used,
the issues are ignored or
suppressed, and a climate of
fear must be created. Then

liberation
