We must be relentless in  
exposing business interests  
that succeed in splitting our  
ranks by bribing certain  
women, offering them pro-  
fessional status in return  
for loyalty to the system.  
In societies where race and  
ethnic divisions are strong,  
we must confront these head-  
on within our movement, not  
pretending to unity where  
little unity exists.

If we do a good job in ex-  
amining the attitudes and  
actions of the various social  
groupings with whom we are  
engaged in struggle, both in-  
side and outside our own  
ranks as women, we will be  
prepared for all-out action  
against the state. Lenin  
constantly reminded the  
workers that their goal was  
the destruction of the state  
and the establishment of  
soviet power, power of the  
workers over their adver-  
saries. Agreements and  
concessions won at the work-  
place, or at various lower  
levels of government, were  
regarded only as stepping-  
stones to a complete take-  
over of the means of produc-  
tion and the forces of social  
control in the society.  
Without the kind of global  
vision Lenin gave to those  
who were engaged in strikes,  
sit-ins, demonstrations,  
and mutinies, the popular  
uprisings in Russia would  
only have ended in massacre.  
The global vision enabled

eral articles which Plexus  
did print. We then were for-  
ced to engage the editors in  
serious struggle as a result  
of their unilateral, highly  
political editing of the  
anti-racist content of our  
articles. Plexus protested  

at that time that "space" and  
not politics was the issue,  
just as they now claim that  
Haydee's article was refused  
because it arrived two days  
after their deadline. In fact  
it arrived at precisely the  
date they had previously sp-  
ecified--and evidently in  
time for some of its con-  
tent to be lifted for their  
blurb.

Typically, Plexus rejects  
criticism as to the politi-  
cal content of their actions  
and their paper. "Form" and  
"process" are their ration-  
alizations for all their de-  
cisions. But this is a sham

workers to build a revolu-  
tionary organization uniting  
the various components of  
popular struggle, and pro-  
viding an alternative to rule  
by the Tzarist regime (and  
later, by the Kerensky  
regime).

As feminists we must either  
seize control of existing  
proletarian (working class)  
organizations or construct a  
new organization espousing  
proletarian feminism. Lenin  
once said rather bluntly, "We  
argue, and we threaten to  
walk out." We might aspire  
to more sophistication than  
that.

Our attempts to build  
collective process into our  
organizations are one thing  
that sets us apart from Lenin  
and from Leninism. We have  
gained skills in giving each  
person a share of responsi-  
bility and power in decision-  
making. Nevertheless, we can  
gain something by example  
from Lenin's unwillingness to  
be all things to all people.  
At times we can work with  
men and at times we can't.

At times we can work in  
coalitions and at times we  
can't. But we must always be  
building toward higher levels  
of organization, both open  
and clandestine, being un-  
afraid of struggle and of  
temporary defeat in the pur-  
suit of a revolutionary goal.

Lenin reiterated constantly  
that the emancipation of  
workers must be the act of

--a flimsy excuse at best,  
and in fact, an all too fa-  
miliar excuse for refusing  
to take responsibility for  
the objective content, poli-  
cies, and role of the paper.  
This is all the more in-  
defensible in light of the  
fact that virtually every  
other major women's paper in  
the country has taken seri-  
ously that the Puerto Rican  
Independence Movement, along  
with the Black Liberation  
Movement and Native American  
and Chicano/Mexicano struggles  
are not only important, but  
are leading forces in all  
revolutionary struggle, in-  
cluding the liberation of  
women. Through the Looking  
Glass, Matrix, No More Cages,  
Off Our Backs, Big Mama Rag  
and others are critical voi-  
ces in the women's movement  
precisely as a result of  
their effort to support and  

the working class itself,  
while stressing also the  
necessary role of intellectual  
activity in service to that  
class. Feminists have been  
very reluctant to recognize  
and legitimize studying and  
theorizing as activities  
integral to our movement.  
This is perhaps because we  
have not built into our move-  
ment specific ways that peo-  
ple who do these things can  
be held to their role as  
servants of our class. Un-  
fortunately, Lenin didn't do  
this either, so that the  
examples we have of "revolu-  
tionary intellectuals" are  
those who were only too will-  
ing to take power unto them-  
selves. Our goal should be  
to encourage each other to  
the maximum in the develop-  
ment of intellectual skills,  
to give careful attention  
to theory, and to maintain  
the closest possible relation  
between theory and practice.  
Lenin did not attempt to  
provide an answer for all  
time to questions of human  
existence. He saw himself  
as the servant of the pro-  
letariat, which was, in his  
estimation, the ascendant  
class in Russia and in Western  
Europe during his lifetime.  
Feminists are not the "final  
saviors of the world." It is  
not our job to plan the  

future of the human race, or  

of the planet. We have an  
historical role to play in  
the service of women.

unite with these struggles.  
Plexus, however, stands not  
only to the right of these  
other women's papers, but  
quite evidently outside the  
progressive tendency and the  
movement that these papers  
speak for and to and reflect.  
As the Bay Area's only  
women's paper, Plexus has  
received the critical support  
of very many women in the  
area for a long time. We  
think the time has come to  
reevaluate and question this  
support. We think that on-  
going support should require  
some bottom line of agree-  
ment. We feel that Plexus  
not only prints primarily  
trivial or reactionary ar-  
ticles, but steadfastly  

Whether men survive our fury  
or not is up to them, too; it  
is not possible for us to  
make any promises about how  
we will conduct our struggle.  
But we must conduct it, as  
best we can, without viola-  
ting our concern for the  
future of human life and our  
concern for the future of  
life on our planet.

Lenin said, in a typical  
admonishment to his  
comrades, "Saying we are the  
vanguard is not enough. Are  
the representatives of the  
other contingents such fools  
as to take our word for it  
when we say we are the  
‘vanguard'? I say No, we are  
not such fools. That's why  
we are stepping forward as  
women. We are willing to  
fight for ourselves. And we  
intend to do it intelligently,  
with or without your help.  
We are learning all we can  
from you, and now you will  
have to watch out for us.

(auth. note: I would be inter-  

ested in giving a course on  

Lenin and Leninism for read-  
ers of BMR (including some  
men, providing they have dem-  
onstrated a commitment to  
feminist activity). Reading  

of Lenin would be optional  

(no use in everyone getting  
headaches). I will be in Peru  
during June and July and would  
probably be able to offer such  
a course in the fall.)

refuses to change or strug-  
gle about this.

The politics Plexus en-  
dorses, compounded by such  
entrenched unwillingness  
to change, make Plexus a  
force against and not for  
seeking out the nature and  
causes and overturning of  
human oppression; against  
and not for the liberation  
of women. As such, we call  
on individuals, organiza-  
tions, and publications to  
withdraw support from this  
paper; cancel your subscrip-  
tions; force them to either  
change, or surrender their  
press and resources to more  
principled and revolutionary  
minded fighters for the lib-  
eration of women.
