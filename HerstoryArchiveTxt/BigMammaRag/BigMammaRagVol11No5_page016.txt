BMR Responds from pgs

ple fact of letting my emotions out.

I was not being dangerous to myself.

I was not hurting anyone... Women in
the states pretend they are open to
other cultures and imitate them. But
when they really have inside their
circle, someone from a different cul-
ture, they put these people into men-
tal hospitals because they act dif-
ferently from their "norms"... repea-
ting the same patterns as the domin-
ant culture organized by the patri-
archy." What is it that really went
on at Michigan last summer? It was
politics that took Carmen off the

land and there must be political
struggle and change, to change what
happens at the festival. You have got
to say that no woman will ever be gi-
ven to the psychiatric system again.
You have not even bothered to educate
yourselves to ex-inmate controlled al-
ternatives. I don't think you have any
trust in the work of ex-inmate women
unless there is a "professional"
keeping watch over her shoulder.
You have got to take the responsibi-
lity to educate yourselves to the
issues and the political analysis

of the women in the Mental Patients
Liberation Movement. You have to take
seriously the criticism of racism
raised by Carmen in her letter. Your
letter discounts the realities of ra-
cism by simply (for you) not respond-
ing. It is so easy to make a "crazy"
Third World woman invisible. The term "care
facility" discounts the voices of ex-
inmates who have suffered and died in
your so-called “care facilities" (psy-
chiatric institutions). That term is
so offensive--you need to hear this
and never use it again--you need to
hear and understand why. It comes as
no surprise that your search for "pos-
sible care facilities that we could
trust in" came up empty. And it would
feel... all the more frightening to me
if you had found one. Leads us to think
that all we have to find are a few good
“mental health professionals and a
few good mental hospitals"--that we
can make the “Mental Health System"
treat us right, cure us. Bullshit!!!
Therapy for all of us to adjust to an
unjust society. Learning to live with

oppression gracefully.
It's such a bunch of classist shit! I

know as an ex-inmate one of the things
I learned that I thought was real exci-
ting is how powerful and amazing peo-
ple's minds are. Psychiatry has trained
us to be frightened of ourselves and
our feelings. Psychiatry works to keep
us away from any real understanding of
intense emotions and feelings, our in-
tense responses to oppression and ex-
ploitation. For instance when we see a
“bag lady", homeless, living in the
streets and talking to herself we can
think... see the effects of "mental ill-
ness", rather than seeing the effects
of poverty and isolation. How do you
respond to the idea of folks talking

to themselves? Think of the old joke:
"Talking to yourself is all right as

long as you don't answer back... then
you're 'crazy'." We must have a new vi-
sion of ways people have of surviving

in this world. When we talk about sui-
cide, we buy into the psychiatric analy-

sis of violence, the violent "mental
patient". For me suicide was always an
attempt to have power and control, an
end to pain when everywhere I looked
there was no end in sight. When I was
certifiably "mad", I feel that my mind
had been protecting me from pain I
couldn't take anymore. My mind devel-
oped a system of defenses that the psy-
chiatric system could only see as symp-
toms of "mental illness". This buys
right into class structure/mobility.
Part of the base of class structure is
the assumed right of the ruling class
and its professionals to information,
power and wealth that is kept out of
the grasp of the mass of people.

This same hierarchy exists in therapy
relationships where the "doctor knows"
what the "patient" can only be told.
There is no chance that the "mental pa-
tient" could understand enough to de-
fine her own experience and what her
needs are.

Such narrow, narrow boundaries define
"normal" behavior. Boundaries defined
by the psychiatric system are not based
on an understanding of the lives of peo-
ple; but are tied into profit making and
social control based on racist, classist,
sexist, and culturally chauvinistic ideo-
logies. Women are locked up for "pro-
miscuity", for "depression", for lesbi-
anism, for failing to serve her man pro-
perly. We can't only half support the
psychiatric systems and the "junior

shrinks" (i.e., mental health workers, fe-
minist therapists, social workers, Ges-
talt therapists, Re-Evaluation Co-Coun-
selling professionals, etc.) that act
on the assumptions and attitudes estab-
lished by the psychiatric system. And

as always, we have to realize that the
back-up system to all the "psychiatric
alternatives" is psychiatric institu-
tionalization. The kind of thinking evi-
dent in the actions at the festival buys
into the "foot standing on our necks".

I am tired of it, feel beaten.

You have to cut the shit. Not just wo-
men who come to Michigan and the women
in power there, but also for instance, you
must confront the cover-up of Carmen's re-
moval from the land in the body of the
feminist press. When I think of how many
reviews I have seen on the "stars" of
Michigan. Again, from Carmen's letter
in Oct's BMR she challenges the sanc-
tity of the stage and the "star system".
"How can there be such a separation be-
tween music, public singers, workers,
and women? Why do we need guardians in
a woman's land?"

What do women performers think of the
separations challenged by Carmen? I
want to know the response of the women
on stage to Carmen's removal from the
land. I have not been able to tolerate
“women's music" since all this happened
nearly a year ago now. And then to get
this letter that is so vague, really
shares no information, and is really of-
fensive.

Changing the way we live our lives,
the "culture" we would come together
to build, is politics. You can't relegate
politics to anywhere at the festival--
except on the stage or in the “Womb".
It's too late, they are already part of
the performance. Might as well address
what is, not what is not. Your letter

evades the issues of ex-inmates
and psychiatric assault.
