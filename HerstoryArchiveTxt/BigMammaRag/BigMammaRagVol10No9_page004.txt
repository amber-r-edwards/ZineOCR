Positive Energy

Dear BMR:

You'll find my money order
for a year subscription to
BMR, including the cost of a
sample copy already sent.

I'm impressed, wommin! I
like your vitality, the top-
ics you write about, your ap-
proach to feminism/lesbianism
and especially the bits and
pieces of poetry laced
throughout BMR.

Living in a backwoods sort
of place I devour anything
about wommin and marvel at the
strength and courage that oth-
er wommin radiate. It's sad
that my community doesn't of-
fer relief or outlets for
lesbians or feminist conscious
wommin; however, we are slow-
ly seeking one another out,
which enables the wommin's
network to grow regardless of
the anti-wommin and criticism
from most people in this area.
Your newsletter will be passed
to other sisters, hopefully
increasing your sales.

For now I would like to
submit a couple of poems for
your consideration of print-
ing in BMR. They may be useful
in other issues.

Thanks for your positive womon
energy. I'll keep in touch.

Education Wanted

Dear Sir or Madam:

I am writing to your organ-
ization with a plea for help;
not only for myself, but also
for some other very determined
and deserving women. I am in-
carcerated at Colorado Women's
Correctional Facility. Since
we are a relatively small in-
stitution, housing less than
100 women, we often do not
have the availability of edu-
cational opportunities which
are afforded to individuals
incarcerated in larger insti-
tutions.

We have several women who
are qualified to attend col-
lege courses. However, funds
are lacking to pay either
tuition or fees. If funds
were made available, these
determined women could then
attend a college class every
eight weeks at a cost of ap-
proximately $20 per week or
$160 (inclusive of text books)
per class.

What we are asking you and
other organizations is to
sponsor one woman per class
every eight weeks or to make
a donation to the CWCF (Colo-
rado Women's Correctional
Facility) College Fund.

Serving time need not be
synonymous with wasting time.
Therefore, won't you please
help in this worthwhile en-
deavor so that we might be
better able to help ourselves.

Please address your return
correspondence to: Mr. Walter
Roche, Academic Coordinator,
Colorado Women's Correction-
al Facility, P.O. Box 500,
Canon City, CO 81212.

Thank you so much for your
consideration in this matter.

Madness Needs $

Dear Friend,

These last few months have
been busy and exciting ones
for us.

First of all, in May three
of us attended the Tenth
Annual International Confer-
ence on Human Rights and Psy-
chiatric Oppression in Toron-
to. The highlight was our oc-
cupation of the lobby of the
Sheraton Centre to protest
the American Psychiatric As-
sociation's Annual Meeting
which was being held there.
Sixteen of us were arrested
for trespassing. But more a-
bout this and other outstand-
ing events at the conference
in our next issue.

Putting out Madness, like
virtue, is its own reward,
but knowing that our work is
appreciated certainly enriches
the experience. But in spite
of our best efforts, the suf-
fering and dehumanization
caused by the psychiatric
system continue unabated and
may even be increasing. This
tragedy weighs heavily on our
hearts and minds. Awareness
of it is perhaps the strong-
est incentive we have to
carry on our work.

But we can't do it alone.
We need your assistance. We'd
like our readers to send in

1724 Gaylord St.
Denver, CO 80206

Page 4 - Big Mama Rag, October, 1982

more articles, letters, poems,
and graphics. We'd like you
to encourage friends and ac-
quaintances to subscribe to
Madness, and when possible
send them gift subscriptions.

Most important, we'd like
to ask you to make a contribu-
tion to Madness at this time
(contributions are tax-deduc-
tible). Our last issue--40
pages and much bigger than
usual--together with the costs
of moving our office almost
emptied our bank account. In-
flation also has hit us hard.
It seems like all our expen-
ses are soaring. In addition,
we've had a policy of free
subscriptions to psychiatric
inmates and subscriptions to
prisoners for one dollar.
This is an important service,
which we want to continue,
but it has become a drain on
our limited resources. For
all these reasons, we don't
have enough money to produce
our next issue.

So there's the picture--
bright in some regards, not
so bright in others. Please
help us in whatever ways you
can. Be assured that it is
necessary and will be greatly
appreciated.

In struggle,

Leonard Roy Frank, for the
Staff of Madness Network
News, P.O. Box 684

San Francisco, CA 94101

Marian Reid Isolated

Dear BMR:

I was glad that you used
Marian Reid's article on in-
carcerated mothers, but there
is a correction. You mention-
ed she was at Muncy Prison,
but she is at the Maryland
Correctional Institution for
Women, P.O. Box 535, Jessup,
Md. 20974. (People often
assume we're a Muncy Prison

newsletter since the energy
for it came from the sisters
there, but in fact we print
stuff from women all over). 
Marian has been confined in
a 5 by 8 isolation cell for
4 years, totally isolated
from the rest of the popula-
tion in a special caged sec-
tion designed just for her,
reinforced by steel, with no
windows or ventilation, only
about a foot of space left
after her cot and a toilet.
Try to imagine a tall strong
sister in a 5 by 8 cage with
thick bars and no light for

4 years! Most of the time

she doesn't get out for exer-
cise, showers or visits.

They want to be sure the
other women get the message,
should they have any ideas
about resisting the behavior
modification program, or have
any ideas of their own, esp.
political. Marian is a power-
ful revolutionary Black les-
bian woman who refused to be
broken. The wall of silence
around her has been incred-
ible. There was an organizing
effort around her case 2
years ago, but every attempt
on her behalf came up a blank,
be it contact with lawyers,
legislators, women's groups,
what have you, we just could-
n't generate any support or
concrete action on her be-
half. The state has her in an
iron grip and went to great
lengths to publicize to any
supporters who protested her
treatment that she is a "dan-
gerous criminal and a security
risk to the institution". Too
many people went for this
line, and her support dwindled
--leaving her in isolation
alone and brutalized. She
stopped writing after that
(other writings by her from
that time can be found in
Writing for Rights), her last
article was in No More Cages
