Sue ’em

A Federal Court of Appeals ruled
on July 30 that a woman harassed
on the job because she refused the
sexual approaches of her boss can
file a civil rights lawsuit. The
recent ruling involved the case of
Paulette Barnes. Barnes charged her
boss at the Environmental Protection
Agency with seeking an “after-hours
affair." After she refused him, her
job was eliminated and she was assigned
to another part of the agency.

“Total led Woman”

"I'm getting pretty bored with
Marabel Morgan's endless platitudes
about marriage—what makes her such
an expert anyway?" A housewife asks.

The 39-year-old “total woman"
admits that her ideas stem partly
from her childhood view of a marriage
in trouble. "I never saw a happy
marriage when I was young," she says.
"I grew up amid a lot of fighting. My
father left when I was three. We did
not have a car. We never had vaca-
tions. I don't ever remember coming
home to a good meal. I never tasted
steak until I was 18, when a boy
friend took me out to dinner."

Tampons Unsafe

Tampons have been found to be
hazardous to your health. They are a
possible carcinogen (cancer causing)
due to a high content of asbestos,
lubricants, and chemicals used to keep
the cotton from becoming flaky. An

An alternative to tampons are cos-
metic or art sponges which are inserted
in the vagina like tampons, removed,
washed out, and reinserted. It is a
good idea to have several sponges,
using clean ones each day. They should
be boiled between uses.

Sponges can be bought in art stores
for about $1.

Rights Backlash

With Anita Bryant's recent publicity
and mandate in Florida, legislatures
in many states have taken this
opportunity to give vent to their

homophobic, anti-human rights feelings—

In California and Florida, a bill to
ban same-sex marriages was passed.

In Pennsylvania, the Senate passed
a bill which would ban gays from
"sensitive" state jobs, including
law enforcement and mental health
positions.

In Arkansas, penalties have been
reinstituted for same-sex sexual
relations when only two years ago they
were removed.

In New Hampshire, a bill which would
prohibit gays from “consorting in
public" is now before the legislature.

The U.S. House adopted an amendment
that would prohibit the use of federal
legal assistance funds in gay rights
cases.

In Texas, a bill in the House would
ban homosexual organizations from
state-supported universities.

Battered Wife Kills

Roxanne Gray, a black 25-year-old
student nurse from New Jersey was
charged August 11 with the murder of
her husband after a night during
which he brutally beat her.

During the last two years of mar-
riage with Blenda Gay, a 6'5" defen-
sive lineman for the Philadelphia
Eagles, Roxanne had called the po-
lice more than 20 times for protec-
tion from her husband's brutality.
“Whenever they called back, they'd
discuss football with him,” she said.

On December 20, after a night's
violent quarreling and beating, she
stabbed her husband with a kitchen
knife as he was resting. "He pro-
mised to finish me off when he got
up;" Roxanne will argue that she
acted in self-defense.

Gay is presently being held in the
Camden County, New Jersey jail. A
defense committee has formed to gain
national support for her and all
battered women. To send donations

T.V. 7.5 hours a day:

A recent 181-page report by the

78.7% were white males. Only 9.9%

Women Losing Jobs

In the current economic crisis,
women have lost 10% of the unionized
jobs in heavy industry they won
through affirmative-action programs
over the last decade. Now women hold
a total of these jobs, down from 38% in

1973.

Also for the first time in fifteen
years, there has been a decline in
overall union membership, produced
in great part by layoffs of women
workers. Four hundred thousand of
the 767,000 workers no longer in the
unions are women.

Americans Jailed

Out of every 100,000 U.S. citizens,
215 are in prison. That's the high-
est imprisonment rate in the world:

Also, U.S. prisoners serve the harsh-
est sentences in the world (except
for some political prisoners in totally
fascist states) according to a report
in Crime and Delinquency magazine.

Not surprisingly, the U.S. states
most likely to imprison their resi-
dents are those with large non-white

Lambda Wins!

Lambda Services Bureau, Inc., a pro-
gram for lesbians and gays in Colora-
do Springs has been reinstated as a
tax-exempt corporation by the Inter-
nal Revenue Service. This ruling re-
verses an IRS practice of denying
tax-exemption to lesbian/gay groups
who would not agree to state that
homosexuality is abnormal.

BMR is still appealing IRS for tax
exemption.

Female Circumcision

The Women's International Network
(WIN) reports that the mutilation
of female children is still wide-
spread throughout most of Africa. At
least 30 million girls and women are
presently mutilated through the pro-
cess of infibulation or female cir-
cumcision.

Infibulation involves the removal
of the whole clitoris and the closing
of the vagina except for a small open-
ing posteriorly to allow passage of
urine and menstrual blood. Infibula-
tion is often accomplished with
thorns or catgut and the child's legs
are tied together for several weeks
until the wound is healed.

To have intercourse and bear chil-
dren, women are cut open, but after
the birth of their children, if the
husband wishes, they are again sewn
up. WIN reports that all efforts to have
the United Nations look into the prob-
lem of the genital mutilation of
girls have been unsuccessful.

‘KKK to Houston

The grand dragon of the Mississippi
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK)
is going to Houston for the November
convention of the International Wo-
men's Year (IWY). George Higgins Jr.
has been active in a coalition of
right-wing forces which has been at-
tempting to take over state IWY con-
ventions. Members of the Klan's
ladies' auxiliary will act as voting
delegates at the IWY convention to
“oppose what's going on." Klansmen
will also be at the meeting to "pro-
tect our women from all the militant
lesbians who will be there."

Rapists Encouraged

In a judgment handed down at the
end of July, the California Court of
Appeals voted unanimously to set free
a man convicted of raping a woman he
had picked up in his car. In a
written decision, Judge Compton wrote
"The lone female hitchhiker in the
absence of an emergency situation,
advises all who pass by that she is
willing to enter the vehicle with
anyone who stops and in so doing
advertises she has less concern for
the consequences than the average
female. (BMR italics) Under such
circumstances it would not be unrea-
sonable for a man...to believe that
the female would consent to sexual
relations."

This decision was in regard to the
rape case of Chris Tobias who submitted
to sexual acts for fear of losing
her life. Her case was dismissed.

This is an outrage!

Hormones. Dangerous

The Food and Drug Administration
finally ordered on July 20 that estro-
gen and progestin hormonal drugs carry
warnings as of September 21. These
drugs are prescribed to more than
5 million women annually.

Estrogen is prescribed to menopausal
women to reduce menopause-related
symptoms and to retard aging. The war-
nings will inform women that use of
the drug is related to cancer of the
uterus.

According to two national medical
surveys, the incidence of cancer of
the uterus has skyrocketed since 1970,
mirroring the simultaneous growth of
estrogen treatments.

Progestin is prescribed to prevent
miscarriages and for pregnancy tests.
However, "When taken in early pregnan-
cy, it can increase the risk of birth
defects. Also, it has been found to
be ineffective in preventing miscar-
riages, and there are safer and more
rapid pregnancy tests."

The drug companies are upset. In
1973, for example, sales of estrogen
brought them $69 million.

Better Workers —

A recent survey has found that
female employees work longer and har-
der on the job than do male employees
when both are assigned equivalent
tasks to do.

The Institute for Social Research
in Ann Arbor, Michigan recently sur-
veyed the work habits of men and wo-
men in selected companies doing the
same kind of work. This study shows
that the average man spends 52 min-
utes of each working day not working
versus 35 minutes for women, and wo-
men worked harder during their work-
ing time.

Petty Procedures

Protesting humiliation and lack of
respect on the job, Cleveland Women
Working recently ran a contest to pick
the "pettiest office procedure."

The first prize went to a law firm
where a senior partner requires a
secretary to keep on hand a fresh sup-
ply of carrots. Second prize went to
a company where women secretaries are
not trusted around the telephone. To
make sure they won't be used for per-
sonal calls, desk phones in that of-
fice have no dials.

Another secretary complained about
having to “count and roll the coins
from the boss's child's piggy bank.
