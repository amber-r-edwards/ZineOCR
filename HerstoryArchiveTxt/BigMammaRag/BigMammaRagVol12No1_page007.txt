Bus Boycott

A 4-month-old bus boycott  
in the South African bantus-  
tan of Ciskei has unleashed  
one of the harshest rounds  
of government repression in  
recent years. According to  
a recent report by a lawyer  
working inside the country,  
about 90 people have been  
killed and over 1000 others  
detained since the boycott  
began on July 18.

Ciskei is part of the 13%  
of South Africa which the  
government has declared the  
rightful "homeland" for the  
republic's black population.  
The 72% black majority are  
to be stripped of South  
African citizenship and in-  
stead deemed citizens of 10  
separate tribally defined  
areas known as bantustans.  
These "homelands" include  
the country's most barren  
wasteland.

The struggle in Ciskei  
was kicked off when resi-  
dents refused to accept an  
11% bus fare hike. Workers  
now walk up to 20 miles a  
day to avoid using the  
buses. Soon after the boy-  
cott was announced, police  
and vigilantes physically  
assaulted commuters. Dozens  
of police were positioned  
at railway stations to pre-  
vent people from using the  
trains as an alternative  
means of transportation.

Ciskei authorities even-  
tually cut the fares, but  
by that stage the gesture  
was inadequate. "Five cents  
will not bring back the  
dead," said one boycotter.

Stop Fascism

A shop in Brighton, Eng-  
land, called Nasty's, had  
repeated complaints over  
their selling of fascist  
T-shirts. They didn't stop,  
so recently their windows  
were broken. A statement  
read, "We will not tolerate  
the sale of the Holocaust.  
The shop will have its win-  
dows broken over and over  
again until it stops sell-  
ing the glorification of the  
death of 6,000,000 Jews."

Peruvian Gays

Peruvian gays have esta-  
blished a gay liberation  
movement in their country.  
The Lima organization,  
Movimiento Homosexual de  
Lima (MHOL) issued a mani-  
festo last March that de-  
nounced rigid gender-based  
sex roles and demanded an  
end to the persecution and  
oppression of gay people.  
MHOL has recently been joined  
by a second group, Accion  
Para La Liberacion Homo-  
sexual (APLHO).

Fight Back

Over 1000 women, men and  
children marched through  
the city of San Juan, Puerto  
Rico to the Capitol build-  
ing on Nov. 29, chanting  
and talking, carrying gaso-  
line flares and banners,  
pushing baby strollers, to  
demonstrate their refusal  
to remain silent about the  
problem of violence against  
women. The first march ever  
to proclaim "No More Vio-  
lence Against Women" was  
held last November. The  
marchers shouted, "No te  
quedes escondida/Grita,  
lucha por tu vida!" (Don't  
stay hidden/Scream and fight  
for your life!)

Moving On

Dow Chemical announced it  
will stop selling the herb-  
icide 2,4,5-T in the United  
States. The chemical, which  
has been linked to increased  
risk of miscarriages, will  
still be manufactured in  
Dow's New Zealand plant,  
however, and will be market-  
ed in that country and in  
neighboring Australia.

Sari Squad

Afia Begum, a 19-year-old  
Bangladeshi woman and her  
one-year-old daughter, have  
been under threat of deport-  
ation (from England) since  
January of last year. She  
had been given permission to  
come and live with her hus-  
band but in July '81 he died  
in a fire at his home. The  
responsibility for his death  
rests at the hands of the  
Tower Hamlets Council who  
refused to provide him with  
proper housing, and proper  
central heating. As a re-  
sult, he was forced to use  
a paraffin heater, which in  
the end killed him.

A group of Asian women  
calling themselves the Sari  
Squad was formed in order to  
take direct action after  
Afia was issued with her  
fifth deportation order. On  
Aug. 15 they chained them-  
selves to the railings out-  
side the house of Leon Brit-  
tan to protest against her  
deportation. They were arr-  
ested and taken to the po-  
lice station where they were  
strip-searched and forced to  
stand in front of male po-  
lice officers just wearing  
bras and slips.

The Sari Squad doesn't  
want to change the racist  
Immigration and Nationality  
Acts but to abolish them  
completely. For more infor-

Breaks Clocked

Women who work in a whisk-  
ey factory in Glasgow, Scot-  
land have been on strike  
because their management  
has been monitoring the  
amount of times they go to  
the bathroom. The women  
walked out after their su-  
pervisor began clocking them  
in and out of their visits  
to the toilets. The company  
claims that the women were  
taking time off to use the  
toilets for "a smoke and a  
chat." Workers at the fac-  
tory said the management  
tried to set a figure on  
the amount of times the wo-  
men visited the toilet,  
saying that a medical certi-  
ficate should be sought by  
those wishing to go more  
than three times a day!

"Squeal Rule" Dead

The Reagan administration  
has decided to drop its  
legal fight for the contro-  
versial "squeal rule" desig-  
ned to force federally funded  
family planning agencies to  
notify parents of teen-age  
girls who receive contracep-  
tives. Justice Department  
Attorney Jerry Ganzfried  
said that the department  
will not appeal to the Su-  
preme Court lower court ru-  
lings that the Health and  
Human Services Department  
exceeded its authority in  
issuing the rule.

In a related issue, the  
National Coalition to Stop  
the Family Protection Act  
announced with glee that it  
is disbanding because the  
FPA is dead!

Video Screens

Televisions, computers and  
video games all give off  
low-level radiation. Video  
screens are basically just  
modified X-ray machines like  
the ones doctors use. Which  
is why doctors are so reluc-  
tant to admit that TV sets  
cause cancer and impotence  
and are rapidly increasing  
the number of miscarriages  
and birth defects.

Though video screens could  
be made that don't give off  
radiation, there are none on  
the market. Manufacturers  
don't want to admit that  
there's a problem; they are  
afraid of lawsuits and having  
to recall all TVs, video  
games, word processors and  
computers.

Children are much more  
vulnerable to radiation be-  
cause they're still devel-  
oping, yet they are spending  
their time and money in ar-  
cades with 30 or more video  
war games.

Fences Destroyed

On October 29, about 2000  
women took down several miles  
of fence around the Greenham  
Common Air Force Base (Eng-  
land), despite over 100  
arrests. Women around the  
country formed themselves  
into "affinity groups,"  
brought wire and bolt cut-  
ters and worked out their  
own strategies. It was part-  
ly this method of organiza-  
tion that left police and  
soldiers confused and unsure  
of what was going on.

More and more women are  
staying at Greenham Peace  
Camp to welcome the Cruise  
Missile, which is due to  
arrive soon.

Experiment On Gays

The top elected official  
in Maricopa County, Arizona  
said recently that he won't  
resign despite the furor  
created by his "facetious"  
remark that homosexuals  
should be used to replace  
animals in medical experi-  
ments.

The Arizona Republic news-  
paper called for Hawley At-  
kinson to step down as chair-  
man of the County Board of  
Supervisors and local gays  
threatened to try to recall  
him after he said last week  
that "homosexuals and les-  
bians from San Francisco"  
should be used in experi-  
ments instead of animals  
from the pound.

Stink Bombs

About 3000 people were  
evacuated from the huge "C"  
concourse at Stapleton Air-  
port (Denver) to avoid  
fumes from stink bombs  
placed near the Continental  
Airlines boarding area.  
About an hour later, a sim-  
ilar evacuation took place  
in Houston's Intercontinen-  
tal Airport.

Continental Airlines is  
being struck by pilots,  
flight attendants and ma-  
chinists since the airline  
declared bankruptcy and is  
“reorganizing” in order to  
bust the union and lower  
wages and benefits.
