Silicon Suit

Two San Carlos, California  
women are asking for $10 mil-  
lion in damages for illnesses  
they say were caused by expo-  
sure to hazardous chemicals  
at a semiconductor manufact-  
uring firm.

Alexandra Edrich, 42, and  
Nancy Alaura, 30, charge they  
have suffered a breakdown in  
their natural immunity sys-  
tems as a result of working  
with xylene, cyanide and oth-  
er chemicals used in the pro-  
duction of semiconductors.  
The two women have suffered  
disabling headaches and ex-  
treme sensitivity to common  
chemicals. The symptoms have  
forced both to take medical  
leaves from their jobs as lab  
technicians at Farinon Elect-  
ric Co.

Other defendants in the  
case are Shipley Co. Inc., and  
Kodak, manufacturers of the  
chemicals and Macronetics  
Inc., manufacturer of machin-  
ery used at Farinon.

Numbers Game

Statistics from San Juan,  
Puerto Rico: 213,000 people  
unable to find work; 21,000  
jobs lost in one month; an  
official unemployment rate  
of 21.1%. In the past 4 mos.  
17,000 jobs have disappeared  
from the public sector, 6,000  
from manufacturing and 8,000  
from agriculture.

These are the predictions:  
an official unemployment  
rate by the end of the fis-  
cal year of 24% to 25%, a-  
bout 250,000 people out of  
work, not counting the tens  
of thousands who have given  
up looking for a job and  
dropped out of the labor mar-  
ket.

During the darkest days of  
the Great Depression in 1933  
the unemployment rate in the  
U.S. was 25%. Puerto Rico may  
soon meet that mark.

Police: Nuts So Bad

Police in St. Louis, Miss-  
ouri apprehended a really  
vicious criminal recently.  
Fifty-one year old Emma Ruth  
Harris was arrested for eat-  
ing salted cashews on a city  
bus. Harris faced a $500  
fine if found guilty, but the  
case was dismissed by the  
city counselor's office which  
stated: "It was too embarras-  
sing for everyone involved.  
They got their point across.  
No one will eat on buses any-  
more." At last report, the  
St. Louis bus system has been  
made safe for cashews. Not  
people, cashews.

Kitchen Table

For the first time in the  
second wave of the Women's  
Movement, an autonomous Third  
World feminist publishing and  
political movement has been  
established.

Kitchen Table Women of  
Color Press, and the Third  
World Women's Archives, along  
with their involvement in all  
aspects of women's publish-  
ing, bookstores, periodicals  
and their own writings give  
testimony to their autonomy.

Because these things exist,  
it means they no longer have  
to be put in a tokenized pos-  
ition in a white-dominated  
feminist movement.

Financial contributions are  
of course welcomed. Please  
make checks or money orders  
payable to Kitchen Table  
Press and send to P.O. Box  
592, Van Brunt Station,  
Brooklyn, NY 11215.

Release Nawal Now

Before the assassination of  
Anwar Sadat, Egyptian author-  
ities, on his orders, arrest-  
ed 1,536 people in a massive  
crackdown. Among those arrest-  
ed was Nawal El Saadwi, auth-  
or of The Hidden Face of Eve:  
Women in the Arab World.  
Nawal Saadwi was arrested on  
6-9-81 under the "Code of  
Ethics." She can be jailed  
for five years and up to one  
year with no recourse to le-  
gal remedy. Even if she was  
freed, she could be forced to  
live in a restricted area,  
have her passport withheld,  
her property confiscated, and  
her bank account frozen. Be-  
fore this arrest, Nawal's  
feminist and socialist views  
had led her to being banned  
from Egyptian radio and TV  
and printed media. Join the  
international protest for her  

release; write Kumari Jayawar-

Hair Raising

A shop manager at the  
Glamour Beauty Academy in the  
Minneapolis-St. Paul area may  
be regretting his comment:  
“Hair dressers are nothing  
but cunts.”

The Glamour Beauty 4, teach-  
ers in a beauticians' school,  
walked out on strike in April  
1981, seeking higher pay and  
better benefits, and an apol-  
ogy for management's insult-  
ing behavior. Working condi-  
tions at the Academy prompted  
the 4, all older women, to  
walk out even before they had  
contacted any union for sup-  
port.

Track Revolt

Japanese women are begin-  
ning a minor revolt on com-  
muter trains. The Kyoto  
News Service reports that a  
15-year-old recently grabbed  
the arm of a man who was  
fondling her, began yelling  
and hauled him out of the  
train when it stopped at the  
police station. Another wo-  
man who was molested was re-  
ported to have grabbed the  
man's briefcase and scatter-  
ed his papers all over the  
railroad tracks.

Hospital Hazard

A comparison of 1,000 low  
risk births, 500 in a tradi-  
tional hospital and 500 in a  
home-like "birthing unit” in  
California, showed that in the  
hospital ‘failure to progress’  
in labour--labour that takes  
a very long time, or even  
seems to stop--was twelve  
times higher. Forceps were  
used five times more, and  
three times more Caesarian  
sections were done. Infants  
had five times more central  
nervous abnormalities, jaun-  
dice and scalp infections.

In The Interests Of White Supremacy

Members of the Chicago John  
Brown Anti-Klan Committee, as  
part of their “Stop Killer  
Cops Campaign!” have become  
involved in a campaign to  
get the armed security guards  
off campus and fight white  
supremacy at Northwestern  
University. This is in re-  
sponse to increasing repres-  
sion and attacks directed  
against Third World and pro-  
gressive students.

In the last month, Irma  
Romero, a student Chicana  
activist was expelled after  
a frame-up on charges of pus-  
hing an administrator...  
brought before an administra-  
tive hearing where adminis-  
trators were judge, jury and  
witness. Another incident =

Witchcraft

In Mexico City a mob stoned  
and beat a woman who was ac-  
cused by her husband of using  
witchcraft to cause the at-  
tempt on the Pope's life. The  

involved a woman who was se-  
cretary in the Criminal Jus-  
tice Dept. on campus. She  

was first forbidden to speak  
to students who came in the  
office about the armed guards  
campaign and even further  
banned her speaking in any  

of her classes on the issue  
of white supremacy. Shortly  
after that she was fired--the  
stated reason?--Her interest  
in human rights issues and  
her involvement with the John  
Brown Anti-Klan Comm. would  
conflict with serving the in-  
terests of the students.
