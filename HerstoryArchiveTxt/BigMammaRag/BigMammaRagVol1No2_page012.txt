being, up from chaos  

To be, do we need the biz-  
arre skeletons, Christian-  
Judeo see-through closet walls.  
Skeletons impeding Flights of  
Female human Lesbian Freedom,  
Love, Fantasy realities scarier  
than Pain and Suffering.  
We've got skeletons in the  
closets we came out of--  
dangling Bony Fingers, grasping  
at our violent wrenching  
departures, lingering here or  
there, this time or that.  

Esoteric bridal veils the  
Lesbian Nation. Let us be safe  
in our familiar intellectual  
wombs. Our provocative fanta-  
sies a reality, wind without  
tangibility. Tingling,  
Tangling in our necessary  
existences.  

What do we do with the next  
40 years? Do you have 40  
years? Do I? Will over 60  
ever be sexy and sensuous?  
Wisdom--is it appealing? Can  
it be packaged? Can it sell  
cars? Was Whistler's Mother  
masturbating under her knitting?  
Have I no sense of sanctity?  
Nothing is sacred or should be.  
Churches are the opium dens of  
orgasms.  

Rejoice with me --  
I feel spring kicking in the  

belly of the earth  

being human carries a higher priority than ever  
and birds in the morning still sing in the snow  

Weep with me --  

the oceans gasp for breath;  
war stimulates three economies  

What is behind a large ego?  
How do they slip detection on  
our social assembly lines?  

How dare a Woman of all crea-  
tures possess one? The main-  
stay of self-assertion, the  
crimp in the conditioning. The  
anomaly of 1984 and reality now.  
LESBIAN EGO MANIACS DESTROY  
CHAINS AND BUILD LOVE BONDS.  

All I want is the oppor-  

tunity to carve out my own  
existence the way Michelangelo  
chiseled his statue of  
David. I want a Masterpiece  
of humanity, a life with the  
balance and symmetry of a sea-  
gull in flight. I want to  
see 365 sunsets a year, I  
want every day to be like the  
Last day, like the First day,  
vivid impressions, colors,  
textures. I want the sea, I  
want the mountains. I want  
the Earth to receive once  
again, the sane sanctity of  
Woman. To grow of the wisdom  
we generously sow and reap in  
and out of its folds. I want  

and canaries no longer  
fly against the bars of their cages  

Shout with me --  
SAVE THE EARTH:  
CONSIDER YOUR FROZEN WINGS  

RESPECT YOUR FEELINGS:  

UNTIL YOU GUESS THEIR MEANING:  

And when you have caught your breath  

relax a little  
wrap up in an afghan  

rest your feet on a handmade footstool  

sip hot cider mulled over sandy embers  

make love in the morning  

sleep in the afternoon and  

before your next trek  

into the snows of indifference  

Rejoice with me --  

in this season  
let's make the time  

you to bubble with the joy of  

discovering your own beauty. I  

want you to read this and smile  
somewhere within yourself,  

(*WOMAN, by definition is  
Woman, without man, defined and  
spelled on her own terms.  
Sounds like womb.)
