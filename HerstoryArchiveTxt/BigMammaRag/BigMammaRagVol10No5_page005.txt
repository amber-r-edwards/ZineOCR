End Of The Line?

Two members of the provi-
sional wing of the IRA were
arrested by the U.S. Immigra-
tion agents when the pair at-
tempted to cross the Canadian
border to invest their group's
funds in an IRA account in Am-
erica. Both have vowed to fast
until they're released or
reach the age of 59 1/2.

Censorship

The last issue of Through
The Looking Glass was banned
from Purdy, Washington's only
women's prison. Reasons be-
hind this action were the in-
clusion of "plans for escape"
and that "the information
which, if communicated, would
create a clear and present
danger of violence and physi-
cal harm to a human being."
Reading their last issue lets
you know that such claims are
ludicrous. Certainly the pri-
son officials have never car-
ed about violence or harm to
folks, and censorship in the
prisons still is on the rise.
In addition, certain issues of
TTLG have been banned from
other state institutions.

And in Washington, Red Dra-
gon, a Marxist-Leninist news-
letter from Walla Walla has
been banned from another Wa-
shington men's prison.

Fire Pig

The Madison, WI Police and
Fire Commission has suspended
for one week a Fire Lieutenant
who, while on duty and with at
least one woman firefighter
near, proclaimed: "Cunts do
not belong in the fire depart-
ment." The more enlightened
Fire Chief immediately took
disciplinary action and re-

iterated the department's poli-

cy around harassment and dis-
crimination. The Police and
Fire Commission put the off-
ender on suspension... Right
On!

No Strip

Yet again, the US Supreme
Court has reaffirmed a lower
court decision that the strip
searches carried out in Ar-
lington, Va., on everyone ar-
rested there, were unconsti-
tutional violations of priva-
cy (4500 people strip-searched
in 1980 alone). This case
may set a precedent for other
communities where strip-sear-
ches are still used to harass
and degrade prisoners, in
particular women prisoners.

Shut Down

One third of the USA's nu-
clear power plants were shut
in February, many of them vic-
tims of problems including a
hydrogen explosion and various
equipment failures leading to
radiation and water leaks. Of
the 72 US nuclear plants with
operating licenses, 24 are
shut down temporarily, and
three others—Dresden 1 in
Morris, Ill.; the Humboldt Bay
unit in Humboldt Bay, CA; and
Three Mile Island in Harris-
burg, Penn.—are closed down
indefinitely for major repairs
and may never reopen.

Kiddie Fun

The Hasbro Toy Company is
resurrecting its popular doll,
G.I. Joe. Denying that it has
anything to do with an increa-
se in the US defense budget
or the general atmosphere of
increased militarism, a spoke-
sman said, "The kids don't
know anything about that. The
kids really flip for it and
the parents are very open to
it." Accessories for G.I. Joe
include: an attack vehicle,
laser rifles, jet-propelled
backpacks, a tank and a motor-
cycle with sidecar and machine
gun.

Columbian Matriarchy

Complete political control
by women in Tibasosa, Colombia
ended recently with the resig-
nation of the town's mayor. De
scribed in El Espectador of
Bogota as "the longest-lived,
most peaceful, and most pro-
fitable matriarchy in Colum-
bia," the town earned a repu-
tation for solving problems
without violence during the
years of rule by women. In
addition, it set an example of
cleanliness and developed a
calm lifestyle to match the
town's limited resources.

Schlafly Spoofed

Women in the Boston area
donned their finest attire to
give Phyllis Schlafly a spe-
cial reception when she came
to town recently. A local
chapter of Ladies Against Wo-
men (LAW), described in leaf-
lets as "a natural branch of
the Ladies' Non-Movement,"
was organized especially for
the visit.

Chants included "Fifty-nine
cents is to-o-o much!", "Keep
our nation on the track. One
step forward, three steps
back!", "Take away more of
our bread, our bosses are un-
derfed!"

Myth California

The Preying Mantis Women's
Brigade is at it again! The
Santa Cruz-based organization
poured 15 vials of blood onto
the steps of the civic audi-
torium to protest the Miss Ca-
lifornia Beauty Pageant. "The
blood was poured as a reminder
that a woman is raped every
three minutes." The Brigade
held a "Myth California" coun-
ter pageant with contestants
such as: "Mis-Ogyny," "Miss
Directed" and "Miss-Informed."
The 1981 Myth California,
"Miss-Chevious," began her
reign of havoc by refusing
to cover her breasts at a
state beach. Nikki Craft recei-
ved two citations, and was la-
ter arrested. "Just because
certain men happen to sanctify
mammary glands doesn't seem a
rational justification for me
to wear a shirt on a hot day."

Cruel And Usual

Federal Judge Juan Burciaga
in Las Cruces, N.M. agreed, in
October, that "past, present,
and future" prisoners at the
Radium Hot Springs Center for
Women can be represented in a
suit filed against the prison.
The suit charges “the totality
of the conditions at Rad-
ium Springs falls beneath the
standards of human decency,
inflicts needless suffering on
prisoners and creates an en-
vironment which threatens pri-
soners' mental and physical
well-being and results in the
physical and mental deteriora-
tion and debilitation of per-
sons confined within. The
cruel and unusual punishment
at RCSW should be ended by
closing the institution.’

Union Busting Fails

A settlement reached this
month between the California
Nurses Assn. and three of the
four struck hospitals—San
Jose, Good Samaritan, and Al-
exian Bros.—fell short of
winning comparative wages for
equal work, but is seen by
the nurses as a partial vic-
tory. The hospitals failed
to bust the three and a half
month strike, the union is
now back in, and the settle-
ment includes improvements in
wages and conditions for the
1,500 striking nurses. The
nurses were demanding a 30%
wage increase to bring their
incomes up to the level of
the hospital pharmacists.
