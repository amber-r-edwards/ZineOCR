Society tries to imprison all women and is generally
successful in doing so through its imposition of the
social-cultural-psychological-political-economic bars around us.
Some of us are less privileged than others and are often sucked
into penal institutions to do “time.”

A society sets up its own standards for crime and creates its
own conditions to encourage crime. So the criminal will inevitably
exist. And the treatment of a woman who commits a criminal act
in a patriarchy will be an exaggeration of her usual treatment in
the society. She is treated as a child, given no responsibility for
her life.

At the Denver County jail, women who are either awaiting
trial or serving time have to or are encouraged to sew uniforms for
the men’s section of the jail. Women have to work or their
privileges are taken away from them, and they are not given “good
time” that will shorten their sentences. The men do not have to
work because there simply isn’t enough work for them. So why
can’t the men sew their own clothes?

At the Colorado Women’s Correctional Institution at Canon
City, women sew shirts for other state institutions. The prison as a
source of cheap labor is a self-perpetuating system.

It seems that the ultimate idea behind the lawsuit against
the women’s prison is not exactly to provide women with the same
opportunities that the men have, but to stimulate serious
attention, research, and thought about the position of women in
the penal system. There are, however, individual changes that can
be accomplished to alleviate inequitable situations and Rudy San
Fellipo, the Director of the Department of Institutions, sees such
“administrative changes” as possible solutions to some
problems.

The prison psychiatrist at Canon City refers to women as
“junkie bitches.” The warden of the women’s facility refers to the
inmates as “my girls” as if she were running a finishing school.
She readily admits that a woman who has been institutionalized
for over two years will be harmed by being in the institution any
longer. But up to that time, she feels that the “structured program
with a busy schedule with lots of things to do” is effective.

Indeterminate sentencing that is prevalent in courts today
places the decision for release on the prison officials and the
parole board. This gives tremendous indiscriminate power over
people’s lives to state officials who basically believe that as long
as there have to be institutions “we're proud of the ones we have.”

This penal system perpetuates itself. It will not make
decisions that would seriously jeopardize its existence. So any
impetus for real community corrections as an alternative to
isolated, alienating imprisonment that offers no rehabilitation and
is dehumanizing and alienating will have to come from individual
groups or a coalition of groups that are committed to prison
reform.

Women’s prisons are the ultimate oppression in a
patriarchy. The majority of women who are confined there are
guilty of victimless crimes, bad check writing, and drug-related
offenses. They got caught while using survival tactics that many
women find necessary to exist in a society where women have little
power and are economically dependent on men.

Community corrections half-way houses must be
established in Denver and other communities for women to
“serve” time in. Then the prison could be turned into a museum so
the guards would have something to do. - C.L.

Out of Prison, Female
and Unemployed

Carolyn Agosta

You’re a woman...there’s
strike one against you...you
have just been released from
Canon City on a charge of
conspiracy to commit a
burglary. While in Canon City,
you were taught to sew, wash
dishes, and file. Now what?
Where does a woman turn for
help - finding a job, or
receiving training, finding a
place to live and food to eat,
clothes to wear and still keep
herself out of prison while not
having to resort to the old
habits that got her arrested
and sentenced to Canon City
in the first place? After speaking
with both private and com-
munity agencies that are
involved with ex-convicts, I
realized that a woman, just
out of prison and looking for a
job has little, if any help
available for her.

There are approximately 60
women and 1,250 men incar-
cerated in Canon City at the
present time. According to
Roger Lauen of the Teacher
Corps Program, “Women
should not be incarcerated for
the types of offenses typically
committed by women.” But
women are jailed and how
they are dealt with as convicts
and ex-convicts will either
“make” them or “break” them
as self-respecting and self-
willed human beings.

In the prisons today, very
little is being offered to a
woman as hope for the future.
Once she is released there is
no more hope than when she
was in prison. Every person
that this writer spoke to
admitted that the conditions
in prison were worse for
women than men and that her
opportunities for any form of
rehabilitation were far less
than for men.

Discrimination

Sandy Carruthers of Better
Jobs for Women reports that
their agency is in the
“exploring stages” working
with other programs to dis-
cover what is already available
for women and what is the
“most viable plug-in” for their
agency. She states that she
hopes to have a referral
system set up by this fall.

Employ-Ex, which receives
funding from LEAA (Law
Enforcement Assistance Ad-
ministration) can only deal
with “high-impact” crimes,
which are burglary, robbery,
assault, and rape. Only 1% of
all women imprisoned qualify
for help from this federally
funded program. George Ben-
ningfield, assistant director of
Employ-Ex, stated, “It is a
built-in discriminatory prac-
tice, since very few women
commit these types of
crimes.” He further reports
that since December of 1972
less than 10% of the convicts
they have assisted have been
women. The program is
supposed to help ex-convicts
to “become self-reliant.” They
are taught to “fill out
applications,” they receive
four hours of intensive coun-
seling to get them ready for
job interviews. They also
receive food, clothing, and
tools for a job and bus tokens.
There is no counseling to help
the ex-convict readjust to
family life and to the
community.

The Pinto Project, accord-
ing to Chuck Padilla, is just
beginning to take steps
toward assisting women who
have been in prison. They
have just met with a “major
business” to have them hire at
least two women who had
been in prison. Mr. Padilla
stated that it is “more difficult
to place women than men”
and to “combat the stigma of
her having been in prison.”
Their program concentrates
on what they feel are the three
major needs of a person just
out of prison: education,
employment, and counseling.
Padilla also said that he felt
their program was “not highly
geared to help women” at this
time. But by October they will
have the funds to hire a
woman, preferably an ex-con-
vict to work with women in
prison. He further stated that
presently they “focus (their)
main attention on men, but
must gear it to women.”

The organization began at a
“Council of Unity” in January,
1971. People behind the
prison walls contacted Chi-
cana organizations asking for
their help so that they (the
inmates) could help them-
selves.

A staff of 17 was involved
with the program at the
beginning, but a drastic cut in
funds left barely enough for a
skeletal staff of 5. At the end
of October, the Department of
Labor will be able to see its
way to funding the program
$292,000. Mr. Padilla says
that he has high hopes to then
develop the staff to its fullest
to meet the needs of both
women and men.

Vicki Romero of the Com-
mission on Community Rela-
tions had much to say
regarding women in prison:
“When she gets out, there is
not too much available to
her...women have it unusually
bad...there is no one to help
them.” One important point
that she brought was the
concern that women in prison
have for their children. An
agency that Ms. Romero
works with, Las Valentinas
(literally, the brave ones) tries
to help women by contacting
their families and children and
taking messages back to the
women, lessening some of
the pain and apprehension.

Her job with the commis-
sion allows Ms. Romero to
work with various groups such
as Las Valentinas, Minority
Women’s Caucus, Colorado
Caucus of Black Women, and
Cooperative Endeavor #4 to
help identify community
needs, the greatest of which is
penal reform.

College Program

There may be a small ray of
hope in the form of the
University Without Walls Na-
tional Teacher Corps. This is a
two-year program which has a
year to go. It involves 19
convicts and ex-convicts, only
two of whom are women due
to the ratio of men and women
in the penitentiary.

The women, one who is still
in Canon City and one who is
out on parole, have the
opportunity to earn a B.A. in
two years in non-traditional
working and teaching situa-
tions. The inmate is allowed
to leave the women’s facility
with minimal security once a
week for meetings; the
parolee lives in Denver and
checks in with the Teacher
Corps office to meet with
instructors. According to
Roger Lauen, the director of
the project, the program is
quite effective. There has not
been one drop-out. One
aspect of the program utilizes
the students as community
workers and crisis interveners
in assisting people with
problems. It is estimated that
over 2,000 people have been
aided through this aspect of
the program.

Some of the people at the
Teacher Corps have hopes
for an alternative to incarcera-
tion, that is a community
corrections program. This
would be a place where a
convicted person would sleep,
eat, and receive on-the-job
training and counseling. A
program to meet her total
needs from within the com-
munity.
