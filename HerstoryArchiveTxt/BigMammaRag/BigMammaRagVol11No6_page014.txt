was - they hate the FBI.

GJ: I noticed that you have
acquired quite a few ideas
and concepts that are part
of Indian culture.

MIS: Yes. When I came to
Oklahoma as a child, it was
an Indian nation. We were a
minority race. The majority
of people I went to school
with were Indian, and they
were the first non-Puritans
I ever met. They were a comm-
unal society that has influ-
enced the USA a lot uncon-
sciously. The pueblos are the
only matriarchies left in the
world, where the child and
its inheritance goes down
through the mother's clan.
White feminists are just be-
ginning to study it all! So
I was living with them when
I was eight years old, esp-
ecially the young girls. I
picked up that feeling they
instinctively had about the
land, with what was happening
to the environment. Their
philosophy is one of the
great, profound philosophies
of the earth. It's interest-
ing now that their struggle
is becoming closely knit with
the USA struggle against nu-
clear power. It turns out
that their barren reserva-
tions are rich in uranium,
even more precious than oil.

They were considered by my
grandmother to be savages who
would be saved by her and

I feel that it is much eas-
ier to talk about racism and
about sexism in the Indian
movement than it used to be
years ago. But there is still
a real need for feminism.

I'm so sick of the way men
often view women in our move-
ment. It's like: "We're hap-
py that you're here. Make
food, watch the kids, and
that’s it."

On my reservation women
still have to struggle, and
we are getting stronger about
it. We had a tribal meeting
last November, a very impor-
tant meeting to consider what
to do about the government's
offer to settle the suit we
brought to get back the
Black Hills. But they didn't
want women in the meeting.
Then they said women could
come to it, but only men
could vote.

I was opposed to accepting
the government's money offer,

other Christians. My great-
grandmother was an Indian,
but the family never accepted
her. She married a white
teacher, who brought her back
to his village. When I went
there, I understood why she

said that the day he died,

she would die too. She could
never have lived with her
anger. He died one morning,
and she never spoke again.

She was buried with him. When
I went to see my cousins there
a couple of years ago, they
regarded her as a virago. When
we went to the graveyard, her
grave had fallen in; I suppose
nobody had taken care of it.
My cousins said she'd escaped
from the grave. I said, "Well,
if I were her, I surely would
escape from this Protestant
WASP cemetery myself."

GJ: How do you feel about
the women's liberation move-
ment of the last ten years
and how it's changed things?

MIS: I think the women's
movement is remarkable. We
didn't have any histories of
women, but over 15 years,
whole anthologies of women
telling their own histories
have developed. I wouldn't
have any audience for my work
without the women's movement,
women's bookstores and pub-
lishing houses. It's had
splits and still does, and
there are things I don't agree
with, but on the whole it's

and I wrote a letter about
it. But they said women's
votes shouldn't be considered
because when the Fort Laramie
treaty was signed in 1868,
only men could agree to it.
That was the way it was neg-
otiated then, so they said
that was the way it should be
considered now. Many women
protested and they had to let
women participate. The offer
was turned down and we are
still demanding our land back.
Actually one of the most
important parts of our move-
ment today is in Central A-
merica. I just finished read-
ing Guatemalan Revolution-
aries Speak. It was so excit-
ing, so impressive, to see
what the Indian people have
done in Guatemala to organize
themselves and rise up a-
gainst oppression. Very few
people on the reservations
today know about this. I wish
they did. It made me want to

good. My mother was a femi-
nist, but she was an ‘economic
feminist.' She wanted equal
rights with men, and equal
pay, but she didn't like women
in general. My mother didn't
know anything about sex, that
wasn't part of feminism. They
fought drinking in men, and
violence, but there was no-
thing about the consciousness
of women. I've learnt a lot
from the young Women's Move-
ment, they've been the ones
who have actually dug me out
of the grave.

GJ: How does that feel,
being rediscovered?

MIS: Oh, it's amazing! I
used to think that in 2020
there'd be a social structure
that would bring back worker
writers, and people would
want to read my things. It's
very creative, being redis-
covered; it's caused me to
write more and differently,
knowing somebody wants to
read it. And then they give
me back images, too. It's
just an amazing experience,
full of love. I was used to
criticism by men - you know,
"pretty good for a woman."
And now a woman’s done the
first critique of my entire
published work (Ripening,
published by Feminist Press,
USA), including what was hap-
pening socially at the time,
in between my work.

Black women have said that

be in Guatemala and see it
for myself. What they did,
bringing 22 Indian nations
together is what we need now.
We have learned to join to-
gether with other aboriginal
people around the world, but
we still can learn more from
Guatemala. I would say that
ten years after Wounded Knee
there is still a long way to
go for us to be free in our
own country.

numbers of children to look

strength is growing and news

The Girl is racist, because
there are no Black women in
it. At first I was surprised,
but it's true. There are no
Black women in it. At the
time, if a Black person came
down to Nicola Avenue, they
were arrested. There wasn't

a Black person who dared to
come downtown. When Paul Robe-
son was hired by the univer-
sity for a concert, there
wasn't a hotel that would take
him in, unless he rented the
entire floor and went up in
the freight elevator. And
that was after the Second

War.

The paperbacks that have
been published of my early
stories could have been pub-
lished yesterday - it's a
sad thing to say. I'm not
interested in past work; I've
got enough present things to
write about. I didn't publish
these early stories; a group
of young writers from Boston
came to see me, and said,
"We're xeroxing some of your
stories to pass around, could
we make an anthology of them?"
I wasn't interested in going
over my old subject matter,
but they were, so they came
to my daughter's house, went
down to the basement where
my stories had been lying for
years, and made up the anthol-
ogies. So I call myself Mrs.
Lazarus; I was really dug up
from the grave by the young
women. I think the last 15
years are so fantastic;
they've raised a whole con-
sciousness. You never can
kill it, never can fit it
back into the bottle.
