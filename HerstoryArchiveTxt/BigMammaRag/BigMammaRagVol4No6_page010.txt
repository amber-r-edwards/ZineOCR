Women’s Radio Programming  
KFML, 13.90 AM, Sun. 2:00 pm  
KCFR, 90.1 FM, Fri. 7:30 pm  

There are presently two  
regular weekly women's radio  

programs broadcast in  
Denver.  
One is a weekly feminist  

news program aired every  
Sunday afternoon at 2:00 pm  
on KFML, 13.90 on the AM  
dial. This 15-minute show  
(called Women Everywhere)  
features local, national, inter-  
national news, interviews and  
occasional editorial comment.  
News topics covered have  
included health, employment,  
childcare, welfare, prison,  
lesbianism, education, wom-  
en’s conferences, sports and  

much more.  

The five-woman collective  
which produces the show is  
looking for additional women  
prepared to make a serious  
commitment to feminist radio.  
Any interested women can be  
trained in production, inter-  
viewing, radio news writing,  
radio reading style, etc. If  
interested, contact women  
working on the show by calling  
388-9085. Also, any possible  
news leads would be appre-  
ciated. Women Everywhere is  
sponsored by both Big Mama  
Rag and Woman to Woman  
Bookcenter.  

The other weekly feminist  
radio show (called Women  
Alive) is aired over the  

University of Denver’s station,  

KCFR, 90.1 FM. This hour-  
long show is broadcast every  
Friday evening at 7:30 pm.  
Produced by two women, this  
show features documentaries  
on issues of importance to  
women and women’s cultural  
broadcasts. In the past, the  
Women Alive show has in-  
cluded such things as an  
interview with Meg Christian,  
a discussion of the history of  
International Women’s Day  
and local events planned for  
the day, women’s poetry  
readings and music, readings  
from non-sexist children’s lit-  
erature, and a discussion of  
the concepts of women’s self-  
health. KCFR can be  
contacted by calling 753-3437.  

The Three Sisters Bar  
3358 Mariposa (at 34th)  
458-8926  

The Three Sisters is the only  
women’s bar in Denver.  
Woman-owned, it provides  
alcohol, food and music from  
4 pm to 2 am daily (open at  
noon Saturdays).  

There is a fairly well-stocked  
jukebox (expensive, though,  
at $.25 a tune), a pool table,  
and a pinball machine.  
There’s enough of a dance-  
floor to move on except on  
weekends, when it tends to  
overcrowd (It is the only show  
in town, unless you want to go  
to a mixed bar). You can  
check your coat for a quarter.  

Happy hour is from 4-7 pm  
daily and bottled beer costs  
$.60, draws $.25 and liquor  
$.70. The rest of the time beer  
is $.65/bottle & liquor ranges  
from $.90 to $1.30, depending  
on how fancy your tastes. For  
the teetotaller, a glass of  
orange juice will cost you $.50.  

Food is available at all times:  
hamburgers, cheeseburgers,  
hot dogs and the like. Nothing  
remarkable, but then the  
prices are pretty low.  

The Three Sisters has an  
excellent relationship with the  
women’s community. It offers  
specials and freebies on such  
occasions as St. Patrick’s Day  
or the bar’s birthday (decor-  
ations celebrating every con-  
ceivable event adorn the cei-  
ling and walls). Big Mama  
has held several successful  
benefits at the Sisters, and  
occasionally such performers  
as Holly Near and Raw Honey  
(a dance band) appear there.  

The atmosphere on quiet  
nights is that of a neighbor-  
hood bar. Although one might  
see two or three men on a busy  
night, the clientele is over-  
whelmingly female. You will  
be carded, so be sure to bring  
your I.D.

Denver Community  
Video Center  

1459 Ogden St.  
Denver, CO  

The Denver Community  

Video Center is a non-profit,  
tax-exempt, volunteer-run  
center designed to meet the  
video communications needs  
of the Denver community by  
making video tapes for com-  
munity use and offering very  
inexpensive video classes.  

For women, the kinds of  
video tape uses are boundless.  
We can tape the interactions  
between women in conscious-  
ness-raising groups, we can  
tape documentaries on issues  
of vital importance to us, we  
can tape women’s groups in  
action to try and solicit  
community support, we can  
tape concerts or dramatic  
pieces by women, we can tape  
conferences and programs for  
women who could not attend  
them. We can make tapes for  
classes, meetings, confer-  
ences, television, nationwide  

distribution or home use. The  

potential is mind-boggling.  

Also for women, video tape  
expertise helps break down  
the mystification surrounding  
such things as electronics,  
machinery and technical  
equipment. Knowledge is  
both power and self-confi-  
dence. Video tape experience  
can help open new job oppor-  
tunities for women within a  
male-dominated field.  

The Video Center offers  
three inexpensive weekend-  
long workshops. One is basic  
Porta Pak, a $30.00 workshop  
in the use of the basic piece of  
video recording equipment  
known as the Porta Pak. The  
second workshop the Center  
offers is Basic Production,  
costing $50.00. This workshop  
includes both Porta Pak and  
editing experience and in-  
volves the participant in actual  
production of a complete video  
piece. The third workshop  
offered is editing. It costs  
$40.00 and is a workshop in  
which the participant becomes  
involved extensively in the  
creative process of editing.  

Women at the Video Center  
are presently toying with the  
idea of offering all-women  
video workshops. One option  
they are considering is to offer  
a course through Woman to  

(303) 572-4906  

Woman School. They are  
planning to participate in the  
Feminist Propaganda Work-  
shop at the school this semes-  
ter. The Video Center has in  
the past offered free one  
evening introductions to video  
for women in an effort to  
solicit additional response  
from women in Denver.  

Another project of the Video  
Center is known as Video  
Voice (Voice being an acronym  
for Video Organizing in Com-  
munity Efforts). Video Voice  
involves itself with using video  
as a tool for the community.  
Presently Voice is planning to  
do four video tapes for four  
community groups to be  
shown at a future community  
showing. The four groups will  
pay $15.00 a piece for Video  
Voice to produce a short tape  
of either the group itself, an  
issue the group feels strongly  
about or an event the group is  
sponsoring. The tapes will  
later be shown at a  
community meeting. Video  
Voice is planning to produce a  
tape about Woman to Woman  
Feminist Bookcenter for use in  
this project.  

Another spin-off of the Video  
Center is a group called Black  
Lagoon. Black Lagoon ex-  
plores the creative potential of  
the electronic image. Black  
Lagoon's efforts are artistic  
rather than documentary.  

The Video Center is actively  
producing and accumulating  
tapes for a video tape library,  
including a section of women’s  
tapes. Tapes already in the  
women's library include a tape  
of the 1974 Women's Festival,  
a tape called Women's Self  
Health, a tape of an Elizabeth  
Cotten concert, a tape of Betty  
Dodson, and miscellaneous  
unedited tapes on Women and  
Aging.  

Members of the Video Center  
can use video equipment at a  
reduced rate. Persons can  
become Video Center mem-  
bers after three months of 12  
hr. a week volunteer commit-  
ments to the Center. Also,  
tuition waivers can be nego-  
tiated on the basis of volunteer  
work hours. The Denver  

Community Video Center is by  
far the most inexpensive and  
supportive video training pro-  
gram available to women in  
the Denver area.  
Center can be  
reached at 832-3603.
