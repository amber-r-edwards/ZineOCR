Diana Press  
From page 25  

We have also heard that there has  
been some speculation that we did the  
vandalism ourselves in order to gain  
sympathy and rip off our insurance  
company. For us personally, it seems  
impossible that anyone could entertain  
the thought that we vandalized our-  
selves. Imagine how you would feel  
if someone destroyed much that you  
had worked to build for the last six  
years. The feeling that we were  
hated by someone, and that we would  
always be that vulnerable was terri-  
fying. It seems incredible for us to  

that was so devastating to us. As  

to the assertion that we financially  
gained from the vandalism, it has  
no basis in fact. For us to have  
sabotaged the publishing of eleven  
new titles after we had ordered the  
supplies and paper would be the  
height of self-destructiveness and  
financial folly.  

We appreciated the donations and  
goodwill of people who have supported  
us throughout the last two years hav-  
ing faith in our integrity even in  
the face of articles to the contrary.  
We also appreciate those who have  
read the articles knowing that there  
must be another side to the story  
and understanding that making mis-  
takes is not a sign of bad will. We  
hope that women will continue to read  
Diana Press books, that the second  
two volumes of True to Life Adventure  
Stories are able to come out and that  
we continue to exist a year from now,  
and longer.

Dissolution  
From page 9  

The newspaper has the subscriptions and the money to go on in the same  
way for a long time. But this community could be helped a lot if it had  
a good newspaper, good communication. If BMR was really serving the  
community, it would make a big difference.  

Sandia thinks someone should write an article about this discussion  
on BMR, but others are reluctant to criticize them. Jackie would like  
to include them in a conversation and see how they feel. Janet would  
be willing to talk to them. Sandia doesn't want to drop a bomb on them,  
but in discussing a sense of community, we need to bring out the point  
that one of the things missing here is news of what's going on: "Maybe  
we are lacking some sense of community and the paper could provide that  
for us."  

Other discussion included ideas about structure for the paper—that  
maybe the paper should have a board of directors or an advisory council  
like the credit union—to help out, provide some expertise, have a say  

Sharon Crigler  
From page 3  

Crigler asked the Tacoma Appellate  
Court that her conviction be overturned  
and the charges dropped. It was  
after Sharon's conviction that the  
Washington State Supreme Court ruled,  
in a landmark decision known as the  
“Wanrow Instructions," that a jury  
must take into account the physical  
and psychological differences when a  
woman must defend herself against a  
man in this society.  

The Circuit Court judges have yet  
to decide to overturn her conviction.  
Even if she wins her appeal, Crigler  
expects to be retried. “They have too  
much at stake to let me win,"  
"If I win it might open up a lot of  
other cases here and around the count-  
ry which are based on similar situa-  
tions."  

BMR Ruling

to free and honest disagreement con-  
cerning issues that affect women. It  
is true that we will not publish arti-  
cles which are anti-feminist. But  
church publications are not required  
to present the case for atheism and  
scientific publications are not re-  
quired to publish articles which  
praise voodoo and magic.  

We are seeking tax-exempt status  
so those that donate money to BMR can  
claim a deduction on their income tax  
and so our monthly mailing costs will  
be cut substantially. An appeal to  
the Circuit Court for the District of  
Columbia will be filed by our attor-  
ney in Washington, D.C.

WAVAW Disbands  
From page 17  

Or is it because we feel the anger  
often enough but don't know what to  
do about it? Because our collective  
privilege separated us from women most  
victimized by the violence we oppose?  

One can, of course, analyze some-  
thing to death. But I wonder whether  
at some point, the whole process of  
a group dissolving—which for WAVAW  
seemed to drag on forever—doesn't  
set up a dynamic of failure. Things  
become extremely hard to turn around,  
even while good ideas are there. The  
psychology of failure sets in—and be-  
sides, there are so few of you left  
anyway. Might as well dissolve.  

In writing this article, I tried to  
put the experience of this group, and  
the pitfalls I've observed in others,  
into some kind of reminder list for  
myself next time I participate in a  
group. Here it is—  

1. Make the purpose clear from the  
beginning. Although the march to re-  
claim the streets was WAVAW's only  
really successful action—in my  
opinion, I think it probably wasn't  
a good choice for a first project.  
Because it covered so many issues,  
it gave us a false sense of unity.  
On the other hand, we could have  
agreed to form as a work group to  
do a march—without the assumption  
that we would continue meeting as  
a group afterwards.  

2. ALL action of service groups should  
unashamedly be a study group at the  
beginning. This process should last  
as long as it takes to feel comfort-  
able and knowledgeable about working  
together.  

3. Find ways to help potential new mem-  
bers get into a work situation that's  
good for them and old members. In  
every group I've ever been in, "new  
feminists" in a group for the first  
time usually have very different needs  
from the women already in it. If a  
group decides it wants to welcome new  
members, the structuring of orienta-  
tions is very important; on the other  
hand, helping new women start their  
own groups is necessary sometimes.  

4. Find a political project that suits  
your time/growth needs of the moment.  
Part of my frustration in working with  
WAVAW was that I had returned to school  
part-time and was also working full-  
time. I literally had only one evening  
a week, but none of the projects I  

could think of could be done reasonably  
well crammed into that kind of time  
slot. In retrospect, I should have  

confined my political work to a project  
with a definite beginning and ending  
date, or I could have applied my polit-  
ics more to my school/work situation,  
or possibly simply acknowledged that  
for the time being, I would use my  
extra time for reading, thinking, etc.  

5. Know when to stop torturing yourself.
