Southeastern Women’s Health Conference Presents Varied Views  

Judith Jones  

Over 200 women from all  
over the country met in  
Gainesville, Florida for the  
3-day Southeastern Women’s  
Health Conference, April 1-4.  
The conference, which was  
extremely well organized by  
the Gainesville Women's  
Health Center and other area  
groups, was designed for the  
sharing of ideas and skills in  
all fields of mental, physical,  
and social health.  

The gathering was a unique  
example of the possibilities of  
diversity and unity within the  
current women’s movement.  
The Feminist Women’s  
Health Movement was represented  
by large contingents from  
California and the Midwest as  
well as from the Southeast.  
This alone made the conference  
unique; the South has been  
incredibly slow in joining the  
women's movement although  
Southern women are rapidly  
changing their lives in response  
to feminist activism in other  
parts of the country.  

Two Thrusts  

A surprising degree of sharing  
and exchange occurred between  
the two apparently divergent  
groups at the conference: the  
feminists whose major concerns  
were the nationally defined  
political issues of the women’s  
movement—rape, abortion,  
health, and the economic and  
institutional distribution of  
wealth and power; and a large,  
varied assortment of women  
simply concerned with the  
personal, social, and economic  
problems of women. The titles  
of the 85 workshops reflected  
the dual focus of the conference.  
They included such human-potential  
type groups as “Surviving  
Widowhood,” “Hypnosis,” and  
“Body Work for Women.”  
Another category of workshop  
had a feminist orientation but  
maintained a generally educational  
purpose: “Starting a CR Group,”  
“Growing Up Female,”  
“Feminist Therapy.” The  

most politically feminist aspects  
of the conference, however,  
were centered in the Feminist  
Women’s Health Movement,  
especially in terms of its  
significance for women and the  
contrasting rejection by the male  
medical establishment.  

Health Movement workshops  
emphasized the effects on  
women of loss of power over  
our bodies and included sections  
on “The Politics of Birth  
Control,” “Organizing Health  
Care Workers,” “Consumer  
Controlled Health Care,”  
“Birth Control and Abortion,”  
and “Women in Female Health  
Professions.”  

A number of workshops and  
an informal caucus dealt with  
the problems and perspectives  
of black women. Among them  
were “Black Women and  
Birth Control,” “Black Woman:  
A Psychological Perspective,”  
“20 Years as a Black Public  
Health Nurse,” “The Black  
Woman as Health Consumer,”  
“Black Mothers on Welfare.”  

All the groups were feminist,  
at least in theory, and the  
leaders of some of the self-improvement  
sessions were quick to  
point out the inherent differences  
between humanistic psychology  
and feminism. Where the former  
emphasizes the importance of  
self-awareness and individual  
growth, collective effort and  
collective maturation are  
essential to feminism. As  
Pauline Bart said in making  
the same distinction, there is  
nothing innately good about  
growth. “Even cancer grows.”  
Feminism is a particular kind of  
personal growth which involves  
political growth.  

Difficulties  

There was some grumbling on  
the first day of the conference  
over the combination of  
awareness training and politics  
represented by the workshops.  
A woman from a California  
Feminist Women’s Health Center  
who objected to the apolitical  
nature of some of the sessions  
said, “I’m a good lesbian, but  
I don’t think ‘How to be a  
Good Lesbian,’ or ‘Nutrition  
and Exercise’ is feminism.”  

The other extreme was reflected  
in the words of a young therapist  
from the state mental hospital  
at Jackson, Mississippi who,  
when asked if she was learning  
things that would help her with  
her work, said, “No, I don’t  
think so, but I'm learning a lot  
about feminism.” She went on  
to say that because feminist  
therapy seems to be based on  
restoring to women the right  
to choose and act, she didn’t  
see how it could help women  
in institutions, who really have  
no choices. By the end of the  
first full day, however, the  
polarization seemed to have  
been reconciled, or at least  
accepted, although a certain  
amount of physical and social  
separation remained.  

What conflict there was at  
SWHC centered around the  
problems that arose in the  
workshops. The titles of two  
of the sessions were sharply  
and deservedly criticized for  
being influenced by derogatory  
sexist images of women.  

One of the groups on aging  
was called “Growing Old  
Gracefully,” a phrase most  
women objected to because it  
describes the male “suggestion”  
that we “be quiet and get  
out of the way when they’re  
finished with us.” Similar  
criticism was directed at the  
use of the word “dysfunction”  
in the description of a workshop  
on sexuality.  

Male Presence  

Another area of conflict was  
the decision to allow men,  
many of whom were humanist  
psychologists, to attend the  
conference. There were complaints  
that the presence of men  
distracted the groups from the  
tasks for which they were  
designed. Many women said  
that it was always de-

energizing to deal with women’s  
problems in a group that  
included men.  

One Alternative Therapies  
workshop spent the whole  
session trying to find definitions  
of humanism and feminism that  
would satisfy both sexes!  
Unfortunately, too, it still seems  
necessary for a group of fifteen  
women to exert an inordinate  
amount of energy in order to  
prevent one verbal male from  
dominating the scene.  

By Saturday, men were being  
barred from some workshops  
and it was the consensus of  
most of the participants that  
men should not have been  
admitted to the conference.  

Politically, by far the most  
significant aspect of SWHC  
was the education and exchange  
of ideas surrounding the  
nationwide Feminist Women’s  
Health Movement. Many women  
at the conference were previously  
unaware of the movement and  
its profound implications for  
feminism. On Saturday, Carol  
Downer, one of the founders  
of the Los Angeles Feminist  
Women's Health Center (FWHC),  
explained the history and  
philosophy of self-help and  
the women’s health care movement.  

Downer’s speech emphasized  
the significance of the  
identification we automatically  
make between our bodies and  
our selves. She told how in  
the early days of the women’s  
movement, women began to  
share ideas and experiences  
which led them to realize that  
women were being oppressed,  
alienated from themselves,  
and rendered helpless by male  
usurpation of their bodies and  
health practices.  

Abortion  

She told the dramatic story  
of how this early awareness  
caused women to begin to  
discover, demystify, and reclaim  
their reproductive organs by  
the simple technique of examining  
their own and each other’s  
cervices and vaginal walls.  
They soon realized that  
abortion, which had become  
unnecessarily brutal and  
complicated, could usually be  
performed simply, without  
sophisticated medical techniques  
or aftercare.  

Through the practice of self-help  
the Los Angeles group discovered  
a simple method of menstrual  
extraction which enabled women  
to perform uncomplicated  
abortions for each other. Then  
in September, 1972, Downer  
and other members of the group  
were arrested for practicing  
medicine without a license. But  
the Center survived the months  
of legal harassment and its  
survival was one of the early  
victories of the women's  
movement.  

The victory was, however,  
the victory of defensive survival,  
and soon the Los Angeles women  
began to act more aggressively  
and to travel around the country  
talking to women about self-help  
and women-controlled health  
services. Ultimately they realized  
that working at a local level  
was futile because health care  
was being controlled by an  
international monopoly.  

This led them to begin a  
massive campaign to prevent  
the oppressive use of new  
techniques for birth control  
and health care. At this point  
the Supreme Court made the  
Abortion Ruling; now women  
could use the knowledge they  
had gained in self-help to open  
and operate abortion clinics.  

Soon the feminist health  
movement had the money to  
buy equipment, to travel, and  
to communicate internally. By  
1975 it had begun directing its  
efforts at the bureaucracy in  
Washington and found again  
that irresponsible national and  
international powers controlled  
the reproductive lives of women  
all over the world, making  
apparent the need for a Women’s  
Health Lobby which is now  
being established.  

Other successes of the  
women’s health movement  
include the publication of the  
bestseller, Our Bodies, Ourselves  
and the establishment of Health  
Right, a national journal of  
women’s health.  

Downer concluded her speech  
with a plea for more aggressive  
action in the women’s movement  
and used as a positive example  
the present offensive legal action  
being taken by the Tallahassee  
Women’s Health Center against  
seven local doctors.  

Florida Activism  

Downer’s workshop was followed  
by a presentation by Linda  
Curtis, director of the Tallahassee  
FWHC. Curtis told how on  
September 30, 1975 the Center  
had filed a suit charging a group  
of doctors, whom she said had  
coerced the doctors who served  
the clinic into withdrawing  
their services, with violating  
federal anti-trust laws. She said  
that the doctors were boycotting  
the Center in an attempt to  
eliminate competition and thus  
maintain their monopoly on  
women’s health services in the  
community. The suit charges that  
the defendants, seven doctors  
including the Chairman of the  
Tallahassee Memorial Hospital  
gynecology and obstetrics staff  
and the Executive Director of  
the Florida Board of Medical  
Examiners, conspired to restrain  
competition and made false  
charges against the Center. It  
asks that the defendants be  
prohibited by court order from  
interfering with the operation of  
the Center and seeks in excess  
of $100,000.00 in damages. By  
using the services of a non-local  
physician the Center has been  
able to maintain full operation.  

Curtis discussed the unique  
political background of the  
South and said that the  
southern part of the United  
States had always been a  
Colony; before the Civil War  
white male supremacist plantation  
owners exploited black slaves  
and since then white male  
supremacist industrialists have  
exploited the South’s working  
class.  

Curtis quoted Lynn Heidelberg  
who sees the racism of the  
South as a product of the  
tactics of the white male  
power structure which benefits  
economically from pitting  
elements in the working class  
against each other. Curtis  
described the feminist struggle  
in the South as part of the  
struggle of the oppressed  
classes against white male  
colonizers and called for the  
elimination of regional bias in  
the women’s movement.  

She said that the control of  
industry in the South by white  
male supremacists has made  
the South the bastion of the  
American Medical Association’s  
monopoly on health care.  
Because Tallahassee’s health  
system is a “microcosm of the  
pervasive system” which attempts  
to control every doctor in the  
country, the Tallahassee suit  
has national significance.  
Winning the suit would also set  
a precedent toward making the  
professions subject to the  
same anti-trust controls as the  
rest of the economy.  

Curtis urged women to learn  
to use offensive techniques in  
their own behalf in order to  
break nationwide monopolies  
which are strongest in the South.  
The Tallahassee suit has now  
been joined by the Southern  
Poverty Law Center which has  
provided a grant for some of  
the court costs. The SPLC  
recently won a case in Birmingham,  
Alabama in a similar attempt  
by the medical establishment to  
prevent the staffing of a  
women’s health facility there.  
A hearing for a preliminary  
injunction to halt further  
interference in the operation  
of the clinic is due this month.  

Power is Health  

The need for cooperation among  
women for the development of  
technical and strategic power  
also dominated the keynote  
speeches by Rita Mae Brown,  
Barbara Ehrenreich, Pauline  
Bart, and Phyllis Chesler.  

Brown’s speech on the “Tyranny  
of Structurelessness” which  
began the conference on  
Thursday night was enthusiastically  
received and set the tone for  
the weekend. Brown urged women  
to direct the movement toward  
gaining the trust of the masses  
in order to effect real political  
and social change. She then  
described some of the current  
problems in the movement which  
are interfering with its  
effectiveness as a revolutionizing  
force.  

She said that women’s  
accomplishments have been limited  
because we are still reactors  
in the enemy's territory, not  
actors; the movement has been  
weakened by its tendency to  
concentrate on a few issues  
that leave too many women out;  
women have not yet learned  
how to accept power and be  
accountable for their own  
actions. The movement, she  
contended, has limited itself  
by romanticizing a self-defeating  
kind of downward social mobility  
that has made affluent, gifted  
women ashamed of their talents;  
it has denied itself the  
leadership necessary to the  
accomplishment of its goals by  
rejecting leadership and confusing  
being governed with being  
dominated.  

She called for solutions which  
involve the knowledge and use  
of strategy, the utilization of  
all the power resources and  
tools of women in society, and  
the development and training of  
a hierarchy of leadership that  
works, is able to act in the  
movement’s behalf and to accept  
responsibility for its actions.  

Friday, Pauline Bart spoke on  
“Demystifying Depression,  
Unalienating Abortion and  
Restoring Rape Victims.” Bart  
began by pointing out the  
possibility of cooptation inherent  
in the kind of social involvement  
Brown advocates. She sees in  
the joining of women’s goals  
with those of the establishment,  
the constant danger of the  
women’s movement being legitimized  
and swallowed up in the un-
