letters to mama

Revolutionaries Struggling

Dear Big Mama,

Just dropped in to see how you were
doing and noticed that no one wrote
home to mama this month with encourag-
ment or comment. So here is a letter
to fill that sad blank space.

The other day three well-known Dar-
ing Denver Dykes, who will not be men-
tioned by name in case their mothers
are reading, went to the Denver Sym-
phony Orchestra in the parks with their
elegant picnic of wine, quiche,
and Italian salad. After spreading
out the blanket they ate dinner among
the happy het couples and nuclear famil-
ies. After dinner they toasted and
kissed all around and got comfy in
typical dyke fashion (not dissimilar
to all the romantic hets around).
After listening to music awhile, snooz-
ing and making out a bit (after all,
the sun went down) they began to notice
out of the corners of their eyes,
that people were gradually shifting
positions and deciding to leave early.
After the enjoyable out-of-doors even-
ing of culture (made educational by

I have received your letters of
encouragement and I greatly appreci-
ate your interest in my case. Due
to the circumstances of my incarcer-
ation, trial and organizing activi-
ties, I have been unable to keep up
with the volume of mail received and
personally answer all of it until
now. Thank you for your concern in
my ongoing struggle.

My second trial for self-defense
against rape will begin October 4,
1976 in Monterey County, California.
I still need encouragement, assis-
tance and money to continue the
struggle in this most important case
which affects our lives and the po-
litical struggles of all oppressed
peoples.

dykes were packing up to leave a lit-

and indignantly congratulated them
on their ability to entirely clear
out the surrounding area. Of course
they proudly thanked him (he had scur-
ried away by that time) and congrat-
ulated themselves on another day's
revolutionary struggle well done.

Hope this cheers you up, it's true.

Love always,

Alabama Cheer

Dear Big Mama,

Good luck with your referendum in
November. We in Alabama will be wat-
ching for the results, which as we
all know are important to all women.
New York and New Jersey were real
downers, but I think you'll do a lot
better.

Sincerely,
Mary B. Weidler

A Growing Rumor

Dear BMR,

Rumor has it that your back room
has contracted a disease common to
many radical publications known as
creeping back-issueitis.

Those six stacks that reach the
ceiling will soon become seven, you
know, and more with your monthly
gestation and labor.

So, all you well-meaning supporters
out there who never get around to
supporting, this is your big chance
to pick up a few (hundred) copies
and spread them around to your laun-
dry mat, welfare office, food stamps
doctors or shrinks, how about a few
in the snack bar at Denver General.
Of course, no one would know if you
kept a few to fill in the missing
months of your own private collection.

From one mama lover to another, it
really wouldn't hurt to call her in
the a.m. at 322-2010 and offer to
spread the word.
see ya ‘round,

Clare.

But Seriously, Folks...

Dear Sisters,

Feminists are still accused of be-
ing humorless. We know that isn't
so. No political movement can last
without a sense of humor. It dist-
ances us from problems, so we see
them in truer perspective. It dis-
entangles us from suffering suffic-
iently for us to remain sane.

So, send your jokes and stories--
be they true, untrue, or in-between--
to: Gloria Kaufman

Contributors will be acknowledged
in print (unless you stipulate other-
wise). You need not be a skillful
writer, since material will be edi-
ted. If you have a good anecdote,

Pack The Court Room!

The "Women's Strip Search" suit
comes to trial October 5, 1976 at
the U.S. Court House in Denver, 1929
Stout Street downtown, in Judge
Finesilver's courtroom.

The suit arose out of the United
Farmworkers’ picketing of Applejack
Liquors in November of 1974. Among
the 18 picketers arrested were 3
women, who allege they were strip-
searched in the presence of men, af-
ter being illegally arrested.

Patricia Madsen, Chairperson of the
Women's Committee of the National
Lawyer's Guild, a group which has as-
sisted in the case, stated to BMR:
"The women in this case need a demon-
stration of community support. The
Court needs to know that this case
is important to the people of Denver.
I urge everyone concerned with the
right of women, of the farmworkers,
of everyone to be free from harass-
ment when they are exercising their
right to free speech, to attend the
trial".
