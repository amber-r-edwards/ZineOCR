The Case

Andrea Gabriel

For the past eight years I  
have been doing battle with  
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin and I  
am finally ready to come out  
of my heterosexual closet and  
seek support from other women  
in facing up to the enigma  
that Lenin has been in my  
life.

My admiration for Lenin  
began during the 1967 Black  
rebellion in Detroit and was  

struggle

consolidated during the 1973  
military coup in Chile. Dur-  
ing this time I gave up a non-  
violent tradition that had  
been bred into me growing up  
as the daughter of an organi-  
zer of rural cooperatives in  
Kansas (cooperatives which  
later became a multi-million  
dollar capitalist enterprise).

My admiration for Lenin grew  
when I discovered that he pre-  
ferred walking in the woods  
with Krupskaya, who was many  
years his senior, to hanging  
out with their bohemian  
friends, whose definition of  
"free love" he called into  
question. I was also delighted  
to note that he had the  
good sense to stay on the  
sidelines at the International  
Socialist Women's Congress in  
Stuttgart even though he was  
dying to put himself in  
charge of it.

It was through personal  
encounters with Lenin, how-  
ever, that I came to realize  
that in spite of his good  
intentions and his sometimes  
passionate defense of women's  
rights, he was in fact a  
species of class enemy.

I was living with a young  
Peruvian man, whose discovery  
of Lenin was at least as  
enthusiastic as mine had been.  
One day he purchased a large  
cloth portrait of Lenin, the  
one from the People's Republic  
of China that best displays  
Lenin's authoritative and  
righteous demeanor. He  
placed the portrait above our  
bed. At this point in our  
lives, Pablo (my compañero)  
was as identified with Lenin  
as any human being could be,  
had even lost interest in  
doing street theatre because  
it was unbecoming of a young  
man on his way to being the  
first Socialist President of  
Peru.

Of The Crumbling Pedestal:

I was unhappy with Lenin as  
the patron saint of our bed-  
room and suggested we hang  

his portrait on the other  

side of our room (the kitchen).  
What ensued was two hours of  
heated discussion and debate  
that I imagine left an in-  
delible political mark on my  
9-year-old son, who witnessed  
it all. Neither Pablo nor I  
would budge, so he moved out  
with his portrait of Lenin and  
found himself a room of his  
own up the street. We lived  
apart for about three months,  
during which time he displayed  
Lenin above his kitchen table  
as proof of his love for me.  
He also pinned to Lenin's  
lapel a farmworker badge, in  
recognition of the fact that  

I was working with a farm-  
worker's union (I was accused  
of romanticizing the country-  
side and not properly appre-  
ciating the leading role of  
the urban proletariat in  
socialist revolution).

Our reconciliation came when  
Pablo read Krupskaya's bio-  
graphy of Lenin and decided  
that I was going to be his  
Krupskaya and therefore it  
would be worth his while to be  
faithful to me and cultivate  
my loyalty. Krupskaya brought  
hundreds of books to Lenin  
when he was in prison, follow-  
ed him into exile, where she  
copied down his speeches as he  
paced up and down their room,  
brought her mother along to  
cook and keep house for them,  
and managed all the details  
of maintaining contacts and  
arranging escapes for them  
when they were banished from  
one country to another. In  
return he took care of her  
when she was sick, and even  
agreed to live for a time in  
an elegant Swiss chalet, at  
her expense, so that she could  
recuperate from a serious ill-  
ness.

I was not enthusiastic  
about the reasons for Pablo's  
newfound devotion to me, but  
I wasn't having much fun as  
a single woman either, so we  
lived together for another  
while and fought daily. In  
our moments of deepest camer-  
aderie he told me I was Lenin  
and he was a mere Trotsky,  
vacillating and weak. Then  
one day he discovered that I  
had written comments in his  
copy of a Lenin speech on  
slavery in ancient Greece. The  
speech had evidently been re-  

was

of statement.

vised by the political organi-  
zation that had published it  
in Peru, so that references  
to women's lowly status in  
ancient Greek society were  
left out. My comments were  
mostly in the nature of  
corrections. I had been pre-  
paring a feminist critique of  
the organization, and was also  
battling with Pablo over his  
habit of leaving our village  
on communal workdays to attend  
meetings in the city, leaving  
me to represent our family in  
the digging of ditches and  
the hauling of water.

Pablo told me I was not  
authorized to criticize Lenin,  
that I was nothing but a  
petty bourgeois feminist and  
had no place in his revolution.

That was the day I decided to  
leave him, at last.  
I've been grieving about the matter ever since,  
and so has he in his own  
way, but struggle has its  
limits.

I have purposely trivialized  
my problems with Lenin up to  
now as a way of getting off  
the ground in making some kind  
Actually, the  
consequences of the worship of  
Lenin in revolutionary move-  
ments have been extremely pain-  
ful for me to witness, as have  
the consequences of the lack  
of attention by revolution-  
aries to the lessons of Lenin-  
ism that are so important to  
the success of revolution.  
What I did with all this pain  
and anger, on returning to  
the United States, was to  
bury myself for nearly a year  
in the reading of Lenin, all  
45 volumes. I did this at  
great cost to my health (I  
had recurring headaches dur-  
ing this entire period and  
was unable to discuss what I  
was doing with any of my  
friends because feminists  
would have thought I was  
wasting my energy on a man  
and Leninists would have  
thought I was out to destroy  
their idol). Several years  
have passed since I completed  
this monumental task, and I  
am just now distancing myself  
enough to draw some conclu-  
sions from it.

I may never have felt the  
need to share these conclu-  
sions with other women, but  
recently I received copies  
of a new feminist publication  
from Peru, edited by some of  
the women I knew there, all  
of whom worked within or close  
to Marxist-Leninist organiza-  
tions (i.e. organizations  
that proudly display an "M-L"  
after their names). The  
women now call themselves  
Mujeres en Lucha (Women in  
Struggle), M-L. (emphasis  
mine) Even my Marxist-Lenin-  
ist older son admits the  
"hidden" message in the  
women's definition of them-  
selves is a significant one.

An earlier publication by  
some of these same women put  
forward reasons why Marxist-  
Leninist groups should en-  
courage the formation of  
women's sections dedicated to  
the pursuit of women's emanci-  
pation, drawing on the writ-  
ings of Lenin to justify their  
demand. Their new organization,  
Mujeres en Lucha (M-L.), reflects  
I think, the struggles they  
have had with men in their  
organizations in gaining  
acceptance for prioritizing  
women's concerns, and re-  
flects that they no longer  
need to call on Lenin to  
justify women's cause.

Women's cause is its own  
reason for being. And our  
cause requires us to learn  
what we can from Lenin, to  
criticize him where necessary,  
and to refuse to be subjected  
to male domination in his  
name.

My critique of Lenin, which  
follows, is intended as a  
critique of the deification  
of Lenin by revolutionaries.  
Those who correctly recognize  
the importance of his leader-  
ship in the Russian revolution  
too often excuse him from all  
responsibility for the debacles  
that followed, and try to keep

No More Domination In Lenin's Name

"their" women stuck in defining  
women's emancipation in Lenin-  
ist terms. There are no small  
number of women who, as a  
price for working within move-  
ments for national liberation  
and movements against imperial-  
ism, are forced to accept  
these definitions. The  
question is not a trivial one,  
and deserves the attention  

of feminists who are not them-  
selves suffering such contra-  
dictions. Leninism is far  
from irrelevant in today's  
world. We must deal with him,  
with it, both in their posi-  
tive and negative aspects, and  
come to terms with our need to  
move ahead out of Leninism and  
not over, under, or around it.

When making criticisms of  
his political enemies, Lenin  
often used sarcasm, sometimes  
drawing on negative images of  
women to make a point. Lashing  
out against a newspaper for  
eulogizing a landlord who  
dies, he called its editors  
"old women." He compared  
dissidents within the Party to  
“quarrelsome wives," admonish-  
ing his comrades to handle  
them so as to not lose power  
when under attack. He accused  
those who were not firm in  
their actions of following the  
“soft ox zigzag line, or the  
female line, as certain wits  
call it, and not without  
reason.

Lenin's insensibility to  
women is revealed in his  
defense of the Soviet govern-  
ment when it was under attack  
by reactionaries during the  
first years after the revolution  
and could not provide for  
the physical needs of the pop-  
ulation. "It is quite possi-  
ble that for some old village  
women the development of his-  
tory during the past 10 years  
is summed up entirely by the  
fact that formerly there was  
bread and now there is none."  
He called his personal friend  
and comrade, Inessa Armand,  
the "Holy Virgin" when she  
disagreed with him, (In this  
case, the only instance of  
self-criticism I encountered  
in reading Lenin, he did later  
offer an apology for having  
used that phrase.)

Lenin gave an impression of  
being always correct and self-  
assured in addressing himself  
to questions of political  
line. No doubt his training  
as a lawyer set him up for  
such conduct. At any rate,  

Lenin

when he did change his views  
under pressure or because of  
hindsight, he did so without  
making a self-criticism, thus  
setting a negative example for  
generations of revolutionaries  
who follow his "style" in an  
effort to duplicate his  
success as a leader. His con-  
tempt for women, who typically  
lack such "self-assurance," is  
only overcome when he addresses  
himself specifically to the  
question of their emancipation.  
In other words, he sees little  
to admire in women, especially  
poor women, tending to see  
them primarily as victims,  
dulled by the monotony of  
housework into totally un-  
thinking creatures.

Lenin shows a lack of pre-  
cision in using the term  
"patriarchy," sometimes talk-  
ing about “primitive patri-  
archal society" while at the  
same time indicating that  
women in primitive society en-  
joyed a status equal to that  
of men. "There were no arist-  
ocrats." He often used the  
term "patriarchy" interchange-  
ably with "feudalism," noting  
that “all forms of personal  
dependence and patriarchalism  
disappear with the growth of  
industry." At one time he  
said that domestic slavery  
was bound to disappear under  
capitalism.

In his studies of the trans-  
ition from feudalism to capi-  
talism in the countryside,  
noted that while female  
labor predominates on feudal  
farms, male labor predominates  
on capitalist farms, that the  
countryside provides the labor  
force for urban industry, and  
that every historic period  
has its own laws of popula-  
tion growth. But he never  
analyzes the importance of  
these observations for women  

or for the revolution, nor  
does he make them precise.

The division of labor  
between women and men was not  
seen by Lenin as an aspect of  
women's oppression. He only  
saw oppression in the condi-  
tions under which this divi-  
sion occurs, i.e. dependence  
or slavery. Lenin is often  
quoted for his assertion that  
“the success of a revolution  
depends on how much the women  
take part in it." One of his  
most inspired statements  
about women is the following:  
"Unless women are brought to  
take an independent part not  
only in political life gener-  
ally, but also in daily and  
universal public service, it  
is no use talking about full  
and stable democracy, let  
alone socialism." This state-  
ment is, however, immediately  
followed by defining women's  
"police" functions as "care of  
the sick and of homeless  
children, food inspection,  
etc.," jobs that will “never  
be satisfactorily discharged  
until women are on equal foot-  
ing with men, not merely  
nominally but in reality."

Women are to realize their  
"equality," it seems, by  
being accessories to men.  
Lenin says women should  
“assist the army to see that  
it is being looked after, that  
solicitude is being displayed."  
They should take over men's  
jobs temporarily so men can  
work in the army and in trans-  
portation services during  
crises.

Lenin thought that large-  
scale farming and large-scale  
catering would eventually  
replace the individual domes-  
tic economy, that women would  
eventually be incorporated  
fully into the paid workforce,  
where they would continue to  
carry out traditional "social  
services." He saw no need  
for their immediate political  
representation in the soviets  
(states) as housewives.

Perhaps Lenin's greatest  
blindness regarding the  
interests of women was evi-  
denced by his failure to  
recognize and combat male  
chauvinism in the Social  
Democratic Party (later, the  
Bolsheviks or Communists),  
and among the proletariat.

He attributed protests to  

“hurt feelings" or "personal  
nonsense." He even opposed a  
law requiring the listing of  

ethnicity, skill, sex, etc.  
of workers for purposes of  

representation, saying it was  
calculated to disunite work-  

ers.

At one time, when speaking  
on the second anniversary of  
the revolution, Lenin criti-  
cized those who speak of  
"freedom and equality" while  
trying to cover up exploita-  
tion. “Education, culture,  
civilization, freedom -- all  
these high-sounding words are  
accompanied in all the capi-  
talist, bourgeois republics  
of the world by incredibly  
foul, disgustingly vile,  
bestially crude laws that make  
women unequal in marriage and  
divorce, that make the child  
born out of wedlock and the  
‘legally born' child unequal,  
and that give privileges to  
the male, and humiliate and  
degrade womankind." This  
speech is sometimes used to  
show that Lenin understood  
that men (not only capitalist  
men) oppress women. However,  
the main point being made was  
the defense of the Soviet  
government when it was under  
attack for loss of bourgeois  
freedoms. He used the legal  
advances made for women in  
the USSR (many of which were  
never implemented, and some  
of which were later rescinded)  
as justification of the Party  
when it was under attack.

While Lenin favored the  
separate organization of  
women, under Party control,  
he never advocated the  
elaboration of a Party pro-  
gram calling for revolutionary  
changes in the structure  
of family life. In fact, he  
advised comrades to refrain  
from discussions about sex-  
uality at women's conferences,  
and to limit themselves to  
programmatic demands of a  
reformist nature. His analy-  
sis of the peasantry led him
