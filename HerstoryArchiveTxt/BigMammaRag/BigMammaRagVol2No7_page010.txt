down from “faggot.” although both imply you are not playing your
socially assigned sex role... are not therefore a “real woman” or a
“real man.” The grudging admiration felt for the tomboy, and the
queasiness felt around a sissy boy point to the same thing: the
contempt in which women—or those who play a female role — are
held. And the investment in keeping women in the contemptuous
role is very great. Lesbian is the word, the label, the condition that
holds women in line. When a woman hears this word tossed her way,
she knows she is stepping out of line. Lesbian is a label invented by
the Man to throw at any woman who dares to assert the primacy of
her own needs.

Divides Humanity

“Lesbian” is one of the sexual categories by which men have divided
up humanity. While all women are dehumanized as sex objects, as
the objects of men they are given certain compensations... Should a
woman confront herself by confronting another woman, there are
fewer rationalizations, fewer buffers by which to avoid the stark
horror of her dehumanized condition. Herein we find the overriding
fear of many women toward being used as a sexual object by a
woman, which not only will bring her no male-connected compensations,
but also will reveal the void which is woman's real situation.
This dehumanization is expressed when a straight woman learns that
a sister is a Lesbian; she begins to relate to her Lesbian sister as her
potential sex object, laying a surrogate male role on the Lesbian...
For women, especially those in the movement, to perceive their Lesbian
sisters through this male grid of role definitions is to accept this
male cultural conditioning and to oppress their sisters much as they
themselves have been oppressed by men.

Women in the movement have in most cases gone to great lengths to
avoid discussion and confrontation with the issue of Lesbianism....
But it is no side issue. It is absolutely essential to the success and
fulfillment of the Women’s Liberation Movement that this issue be
dealt with. As long as the label “dyke” can be used to frighten a
woman into a less militant stand, keep her separate from her sisters,
keep her from giving primacy to anything other than men and family
— then to that extent she is controlled by the male culture. Until
women see in each other the possibility of a primal commitment
which includes sexual love, they will be denying themselves the love
and value they readily accord to men, thus affirming their second
class status. As long as male acceptability is primary — both to in-
dividual women and to the movement as a whole — the term Lesbian
will be used effectively against women.

... It also should be said that some younger, more radical women
have honestly begun to discuss Lesbianism, but so far it has been
primarily as a sexual “alternative” to men. This, however, is still giving
primacy to men, both because the idea of relating more completely
to women occurs as a negative reaction to men, and because the Les-
bian relationship is being characterized simply by sex, which is
divisive and sexist. On one level, which is both personal and political,
women may withdraw emotional and sexual energies from men, and
work out various alternatives for those energies in their own lives. On
a different political/psychological level, it must be understood that
what is crucial is that women begin disengaging from male-defined
response patterns. In the privacy of our own psyches, we must cut
those cords to the core. For irrespective of where our love and sexual
energies flow, if we are male-identified in our heads, we cannot
realize our autonomy as human beings.

Self-Hate

...The consequence of internalizing this role (of male-defined sexual
and family functions) is an enormous reservoir of self-hate. This is not
to say the self-hate is recognized or accepted as such; indeed most
women would deny it. It may be experienced as discomfort with her
role, as feeling empty, as numbness, as restlessness, as a paralyzing
anxiety at the center. Alternatively, it may be expressed in shrill
defensiveness of the glory and destiny of her role. But it does exist,
often beneath the edge of her consciousness, poisoning her ex-
istence, keeping her alienated from herself, her own needs, and
rendering her a stranger to other women. They try to escape by iden-
tifying with the oppressor, living through him, gaining status and iden-
tity from his ego, his power, his accomplishments. And by not iden-
tifying with other “empty vessels” like themselves. Women resist
relating on all levels to other women who will reflect their own oppres-
sion, their own secondary status, their own self-hate. For to confront
another woman is finally to confront one’s self — the self we have
gone to such lengths to avoid. And in that mirror we know we cannot
really respect and love that which we have been made to be.

...It is very difficult to realize and accept that being “feminine” and
being a whole person are irreconcilable. Only women can give to each
other a new sense of self. That identity we have to develop with
reference to ourselves, and not in relation to men. This consciousness
is the revolutionary force from which all else will follow, for ours
is an organic revolution.

For this we must be available and supportive to one another, give our
commitment, and our love, give the emotional support necessary to
sustain this movement. Our energies must flow toward our sisters,
not backward toward our oppressors. As long as Women’s Liberation
tries to free women without facing the basic heterosexual structure
that binds us in one-to-one relationship with our oppressors,
tremendous energies will continue to flow into trying to straighten up
each particular relationship with a man, into finding how to get better
sex, how to turn his head around — into trying to make the “new man”
out of him, in the delusion that this will allow us to be the “new
woman.” This obviously splits our energies and commitments, leaving
us unable to be committed to the construction of the new patterns
which will liberate us.

... It is the primacy of women relating to women, of women creating a
new consciousness of and with each other, which is at the heart of
Women’s Liberation, and the basis for the cultural revolution... We
see ourselves as prime, find our centers inside of ourselves. We find
receding the sense of alienation, of being cut off, of being behind a
locked window, of being unable to get out what we know is inside. We
feel a realness, feel at last we are coinciding with ourselves. With
that real self, with that consciousness, we begin a revolution to end
the imposition of all coercive identifications, and to achieve maximum
autonomy in human expression.

We would again like to re-emphasize that both Lesbians and straight
women are in different stages of consciousness at different times.
Consciousness raising must be done with this difference in mind,
remembering that there are countless ways to reach the objective of a
woman’s culture and all women’s efforts should be encouraged in this
direction.
