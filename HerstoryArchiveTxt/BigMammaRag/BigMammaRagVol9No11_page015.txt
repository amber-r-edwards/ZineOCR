All The World's A Stage; Who's

Kitty Tsui

Imagine my delight. There  
I was, a month past my last  
unemployment check, waiting  
for news of an NEH grant  
with the word out about the  
administration's proposed  
50% cutback in both NEA and  
NEH funds, when I was told  
of a paying acting gig.

Lilith, a Women's Theatre  
was auditioning for their  
next production, a musical  
about maids.

I am a writer. I had  
played the conventional role  
of any actor only once, in  
Paper Angels, produced by  
the Asian American Theatre  
Company in 1980. Prior to  
that I was on stage as one  
of Unbound Feet, a collective  
of six Chinese American women  
writers who perform original  
material.

But a musical for one who  
only sings privately in the  
shower or to her lover would  
be a challenge!

For my audition piece I  
chose a dialogue from our  
Unbound Feet material and  
"Soaring," a song by Cris  
Williamson.

In a dream that night I  
was my grandmother embracing  
my grandmother. We were mir-  
ror images of the way she  
looked at fifty, beautiful,  
strong, and full of dignity.  
In "Soaring" are the lines:  
meeting myself/in the mir-  
ror,/finding myself/getting  
much clearer. . .

In mid-February I started  
working with a company that  
has a following and a repu-  
tation in the women's commu-  
nity. It advertises itself  
as "the voice of today's  
woman" and states as one of  
its goals, "to define the  
responsibilities of the  
liberated woman and affirm  
the power of every woman to  
make our world a better  
place."

Great. A job. Getting  
paid to create and act and  
sing. A play at the end of  
the road. And with a women's  
theatre company.

As yet the play had no  
script. The four actors were  
to do improv to create the  
characters and the play.  
One of the actors was to  
write a script from the improv  
work. When it was

clear she was unable to pro-  
duce one, the director took  
on the role of writer. To  
her credit she turned out a  
script in four days. Howev-  
er, it was an ordeal for me  
to read it. My character,  
Jenny, the ‘quiet one' had  
minimal lines. When she did  
speak it was to tell for-  
tunes from the wrinkles of  
a sheet. Speaking in verse  
like this: these wrinkles  
mean new beginnings from old  
roots.

Sound familiar? Heard it  
before? Charlie Chan or Fu  
Manchu? Fortune cookie say,  
Confucius say trinkets  
lining the shelves of shops  
in Chinatown, Japantown,  
Fisherman's Wharf. But in  
the Women's Building re-  
hearsing for a feminist  
play about the lives of  
four maids?

Instead of exploring the  
issues of why women and  
women of color, foreign  
born and American, are oft-  
en forced into work as  
maids, a figment of fantasy  
that distorts, trivializes  
and makes a mockery of a  
woman's work is presented.  
I tried to explain my ob-  
jections but the assistant  
director shrugged them off  
with a flippant "Gypsies  
tell fortunes, not Asians."  
Rather than attempt to un-  
derstand my criticism and  
struggle with it, she in-  
sisted on her own narrow  
view.

Outside of the Asian Am-  
erican Theatre Company  
there are few roles for  
Asian American actors in  
the theatre. Therefore it  
is of crucial importance,  
especially for a company  
that boasts of ". . .the  
development of non-stereo-  
typic characters" that they  
be characterized as real  
people, not ludicrous cari-  
catures. And it is our re-  
sponsibility as artists, as  
activists, as feminists to  
put a stop to racism, sex-  
ism, class oppression and  
homophobia whenever and  
wherever the monster  
rears its head. Especially  
when it is in our midst.  
The show cannot just go on.

The writer/director main-  
tained that the sheets were  
a technique to show Jenny  
as a spiritual/wise woman/  
shaman (reading wrinkles in  

sheets=spirituality?) and  
it was not until after a  
lengthy discussion and fur-  
ther explanation that she  
reluctantly agreed to give  
Jenny, a veteran maid of  
twenty-five years, other  
work. They were so insistent  
on keeping this ‘exotic ac-  
tivity' that it was written  
in later with a Cuban maid  
doing the honors.

Anxieties and emotions  
were high. There was rewri-  
ting, reworking, cutting,  
and shaping to be done. It  
was not an easy road. From  
the first when I spoke out  
against the racist charac-  
terization I had been alien-  
ated from the rest of the  
cast. I was branded a 'crit-  
ical writer.' They wanted  
to sing and dance and get  
on with the show. Though  
they felt my politics were  
right on they resented hav-  
ing to take the time and  
energy to make the needed  
changes.

As a feminist activist I  
am committed to doing art  
with a message and working  
in a group with democratic  
principles. Clearly to have  
stuck with the play through  
hell and high water demon-  
strated my dedication. But  
to speak out against major-  
ity opinion was seen as  
threatening, hostile and  
subversive to their inter-  
ests.

Stereotyping has long been  
used by mainstream media as  
a tool to oppress and exploit  
on the basis of race, sex,  
class and sexuality. But to  
find stereotypes perpetrated  
and people so resistant to  
change in a “woman's theater"  
in our own midst is alarming.  
As feminist activists we must  
take the responsibility of  
speaking out against images  
that abuse and distort who  
we are even at the risk of  
being silenced.

Later a meeting was called  
to hand down a "core group  
decision based on feedback  
from the cast." It concerned  
"Kitty's personal problems  
and her relationship with  
the company." It was stated  
that because of my “problems”  
it would not be "right" for  
me to go on a scheduled tour.

I was in a state of shock.  
The show had opened to good  
reviews. I had not let per-  
sonalities hinder my perfor-  

Directing?

mances. After 2½ months of  
working on my character and  
contributing to ensure that  
the play had content of sub-  
stance as well as songs and  
one-liners, I had been fired.  
But fired for what? Even  
hired help have the right to  
know.

Problems? I was fired be-  
cause of whose problems? I  
had spoken out against the  
unreasonable characterization  
of a working-class immigrant.  
If this is seen as having  
"personal problems" let me  
quote poet Mitsuye Yamada:  
"As a child of immigrants,  
as a woman of color in a  
white society and as a  
woman in a patriarchal so-  
ciety, what is personal to  
me is political."

But to get back to the ba-  
sic issue, why was I not  
told that people were having  
"problems" with me? Surely  
it is the responsibility of  
those working in a closely-  
knit group who see problems  
to bring them to the floor  
so that issues of concern  
can be addressed. The group  
conveniently dismissed me to  
avoid confrontation and  
debate.

This article documents  
some of the behind-the-  
scenes events at a "femin-  
ist" theater production.

The show must go on. Yet, we  
performed to capacity au-  
diences in San Francisco,  
Berkeley and Sacramento. But  
at what cost?

We live in too precarious  
a time to not speak out or  
take action against injustice  
in our political or personal  
lives. As women we have been  
oppressed because of our sex,  
as women of color we have  
been oppressed because of  
our sex and our race, as  
lesbians of color we have  
been oppressed because of our  
sex, our race and our sexual-  
ity; we cannot afford to  
isolate issues or each other.  
We must understand and act  
from a multi-issue base. Equ-  
ality, growth and achieve-  
ment can only come about by  
all oppressed groups working  
together to break down stere-  
otypes, challenge traditional  
roles and activities, begin  
dialogue and promote under-  
standing.

dare to win."
