concept of women's develop-  
ment and strive to extend  
the unfinished revolution  

of Algeria by emphasizing  
that just as Algeria was  
once a colony for the French,  
so women remain a colony  
which exists for the good  

of men.  

M'rabet points out that,  
"The bourgeoisie in pretend-  
ing to maintain the oppres-  
sion of women seek in reali-  
ty to perpetuate the oppres-  
sion of other men." All of  
which, she adds, "takes  
place under the cloak of  
Islam or its variants, 'sa-  
cred tradition,’ ‘glorious  
PSSE! ewe  

In her quest for a theory  
of revolution, she rejects  
the concept of "evolution"  
of women's role in the con-  
text of the Islamic society,  
“which one has never taken  
the trouble to define, but  
had on the contrary tried to  
obscure..."  

Rather than relegating the  
struggle for women's libera-  
tion to the day after the

smile on us. We would do it  
again however. Alix Dobkin  

is a fine performer and work-  
ing with her was a real joy.  

Do Sage members get paid?  
Actually the question that  
gets asked is "How much do  
Sage members get paid?" No.  
Sage members do not get re-  
imbursed for their labor.  

If the number of hours spent  
on each production, outside  
of the 10-14 hours on actual  
concert day, were totalled  
for all eight members and  
then multiplied by the cur-  
rent minimum wage, an addit-  
ional thousand would easily  
be added to the budget creat-  
ing an approximate rise in  
ticket price of about $3, or  
$10-$12 tickets. No, Sage  
members do not get paid.  

Sage members donate 4 or 5  
times the ticket price for  
each production in both  

labor and money.  

We have talked about paying  
ourselves a share of the pro-  
fits when a concert does  
make money. The sum that  
would be paid to each member  
would be nominal and would  
not begin to reimburse us  
for our time and expenses.  
That bit from each member,  
would make a substantial  
amount for Sage which is used  
for everything from lower

socialist revolution, or  
speaking of a narrow femin-  
ism within the bourgeois  
context which strives for  
the advance of women without  
at the same time pushing to  
change society as a whole,  
she speaks of revolutionary  
feminism, saying, "Women's  
liberation is not a problem  
which can be viewed in isola-  
tion. It is part of the  
whole in which it is implica-  
ted and which in turn condi-  
tions that whole."  

The stopping of the revo-  
lution and the re-veiling of  
Algerian women, opened a new  
chapter in women's struggles  
for liberation. In 1965 more  
than 15,000 women demonstra-  
ted against the enforcement  
of the veil. A spirit was  
kept alive, whether we look  
at the large mobilization of  
women who organized sit-ins  
in universities to protest  
the adoption of the retro-  
gressive family codes in  
1972, or today, as women  
continue to participate in .  
public demonstrations and  
strikes to protest both

ticket prices to a fund for  
buying our own sound equip-  
ment, owning the means of  
production, instead of con-  
tinually handing money over  
to the man for rental fees.  
This being our collective  
conclusion, we do not pay  
ourselves.  

Anytime we as women deal  
with money, we deal with  
class. While it is true that  
many women can easily afford  
a $6 ticket for a Sage prod-  
uction, it is also true that  
there are many women who can-  
not. We offer work exchange  
for half and full ticket  
price, on the theory that  
time is money.  

This is a halfway measure.  
It is the best compromise we  
can reach between the class-  
ism inherent in having some-  
one work because they cannot  
pay and in our need to have  
Sage remain financially sol-  
vent.  

But what about women who do  
not have any time due to long  
work hours nor can afford a  
ticket? Does Sage deny  
women's culture to those who  
cannot pay? It would entire-  
ly undermine our political  
raison d'être to do so:  
Hypocrisy is not our policy.  
We could not and wouldn't  
deny a woman entrance to an  

class exploitation and sex-  
ism.  

In a leaflet which was  
distributed at the Universi-  
ty of Algiers, and which was  
addressed to the Iranian  
women who were challenging  
the enforcement of the veil  
on March 8, 1979, the Alger-  
ian women wrote, "We are  
disturbed by what is being  
done to Iranian women. These  
women raised their voices in  
revolt, but now the new  
government is trying to sil-  
ence them. Algerian women  
also fought: as guerrillas  
in the streets, in the fire  
of the colonial army. After  
independence and for the past  
17 years the patriarchal  
power has been working to  
silence them. This is being  
done in the name of the thous-  
and-year-old religious prin-  
ciples, in the name of the  
so-called priorities of a  
developing nation...in the  
name of revolution!!! Alger-  
ian women join their voices  
to the cries of Iranian wo-  
men, who refuse the fascist  
utilization of an Islamism  
that is trying to suffocate  
them..."

Movement in the Middle East  

event because she truly could  
not pay anything.  

Another way in which we try  
to offset costs for women is  
in providing childcare.  
Childcare is not free. It is  
part of the ticket price;  
every woman who buys a ticket  
helps to pay for childcare.  

We also try to secure con-  
cert halls which are in the  
downtown/Capitol Hill area,  
to make concerts more easily  
accessible to women. We  
are not always successful in  
this, but we try.  

Sage has a commitment to  
spreading women's culture to  
as many women as possible.  

We therefore have an interp-  
reter for the hearing impair-  
ed at most concerts -- is the  
message only for women who  
can hear? We try to get  
halls that are remodeled to  
accommodate wheelchairs for  
the physically challenged.  
Many times, this is not pos-  
sible. When we have to use  

a hall that is not accessible  
directly, we have strong wom-  
en on hand to assist with  
carrying. Women's culture  
and the experience of a  
women's concert shall not be  
denied to any woman because  
she cannot hear or walk or  
see or afford to pay a ticket  
price.  

It is significant to women  
that all work in producing a  

has reached a most critical  
point, whether we are deal-  
ing with the women of Iran  
or Algeria who have experi-  
enced a revolution and have  
a land of their own, or  
whether we look at the Pal-  
estinian Movement where, as  
we witnessed at the Copen-  
hagen conference, the whole  
women's liberation question  
was completely evaded.  

It is precisely because  
revolutionary feminism is  
not fooled by a change in  
leadership, or forms of pro-  
perty ownership--whether  
private or nationalized--but  
rather, seeks new human re-  
lationships, this essence of  
Marx's Marxism, where the  
development of each is the  
necessary precondition for  
the development of all, that  
we must fight in the battle  
for our own freedom, the day  
before, the day of, and the  
day after the revolution.  

Indeed we would not only  
not achieve our liberation,  
but would in fact leave the  
whole revolution unfinished,  
were we not to insist on the  
liberation of women in the  
very struggle for national  
liberation. Our struggle  
must continue,  

concert is done by women:  

the fact that women can han-  
dle sophisticated electronic  
equipment, that we can de-  
sign a strong show without  
using any male "assistance"  
(read interference), that we  
do not need, want or have any  
men working with us. We as  
women are strong; working to-  
gether, we are stronger  

still. We produce good cult-  
ural events.  

Our concerts are an import-  
ant link in the creation of  
a women's cultural community.  
Without a community, we in-  
dividually will not survive  
in the patriarchal world. It  
is in all our interests to  
support each other. As Sage  
puts effort into fostering a  
women-defined culture, so we  
must the women of the com-  
munity support Sage by at-  
tending these events. We are  
nothing without each other's  
support.  

Sage women are members of  
the community. We are acces-  
sible for any women's feed-  
back. Walk up to us after a  
concert and tell us what you  
liked and what you didn't  
like. Talk to us in the book-  
store, on the streets. We  
feel our responsibility to  
our community strongly and will  
be accountable. Call us at  
320-6762 for more information  
about our upcoming events.
