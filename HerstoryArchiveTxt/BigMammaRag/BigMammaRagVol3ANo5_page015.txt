BMR Interviews Feminist Comedienne

Laughin’ With Lily

Kathleen O’Brien

“The day I have to spend ten  
years in college to appreciate a  

comic...” “I hope Lily’s better  
than he was...” “I didn’t get any  
of that...” These were only a  

few of the comments I overheard  
following Edward Morris's per-  
formance as the warm-up  
comedian preceding Lily  
Tomlin, the main attraction at  
the Warehouse last week.

There was polite laughter at  
his all white menu:— clam  
chowder with chicklets, cocaine,  
and skim milk and the inside of  
oreo cookies for dessert. Nervous  
tittering at his reference to  
Jewish-Egyptian decor, and  
downright confusion when he  
fractured a classical piece a la  
Victor Borge. A few of us did  
appreciate his droll sense of  
humor, his fey wit and deadpan  
charm. But Edward Morris was  
above most of the Denver  
audience. The fault is not all the  
audience's however; Morris may  
just be accustomed to more  
sophisticated receptions. His  
was a problem of inability to shift  
gears but a mediocre entertainer  
he is not.

Lily Tomlin on the other hand  
pulsates, radiates, energizes,  
and electrifies on multi-levels.  
Those who came strictly to see  
Ernestine or Edith Anne, were  
not disappointed. But Lily Tomlin  
is a woman with a great deal to  
say and much of the laughter  
she provokes leaves one  
wondering exactly what is so  
damn funny anyway? She pokes  
and probes and while tickling  
your funnybone with one hand,  
rams home a stinging insight  

with the other. (“You're in the running for  
second best audience of the  
week.”) she titillates, she shocks  
(“I don’t worry about being a  
success in a mediocre world.”).  
But most of all she touches that  
secret place in so many of us that  
we thought no one else knew  
existed. (“I feel sexually  
threatened every time I see a  
Yield sign on the highway.”)  
(“Do you chew the sticky off of  
scotch tape?”)

She does about ten characters  
from different races, varying  
walks of life, all with keen  
perception and incredible in-  
sight. On stage she is a master  
puppeteer taking her audience  
through all the paces — inno-  
cent laughter, pathos, shock,  
self-awareness, political insight.  
Above all her characters are all  
strong, self-respecting people  
who enjoy being who they are.

Lily Tomlin is worth any ad-  
mission price. If you missed her  
this time in Denver, watch for  
her return. You won't be disap-  
pointed. Ms. Lily Tomlin was  
gracious and generous after the  
show, granting Big Mama Rag  
an enjoyable and stimulating  

interview.

BMR: Is there any truth to the  
rumor that you're a feminist?

LT: What can I say? I’m never  
quite sure what people mean by  
that. But of course I’m a feminist.

BMR: What was your attitude  
towards feminism in the late  
60's when you were on Laugh-In  
and so much of the humor was  

sexist?  
LT: Yes, it was sexist and  
racist too. If they gave me  

something sexist to do, the most  
I could do was say, “No, I can’t do  
that,” and then they just gave it  
to somebody else and it got done  
anyway.

BMR: So much of your humor  
is social comment. Did you get  
into comedy as a vehicle for your  
views or strictly as entertain-  
ment?

LT: That's hard to pinpoint  
because I think we're talking on  
two different levels and on an  
unconscious level I always  
wanted to do my own work. I  
never wanted to be dependent  
on anyone. I wanted autonomy,  
stature, and I wanted to make  
money. I was an inner city kid  
from Detroit who grew up in a  
typical blue collar family. Daddy  
totally dominated and he also  
controlled the money. My  
brother and I were not shielded.  
We were aware of all the  
worries. Mother was supposed  
to manage everything but rent  
on $40.00 a week and I never  
wanted that kind of dependence.  
When I flash back and view my  
comedy now, though, I knew  
there were strong women  
around me as I grew up —  
women in authority who were  
dignified and had strong self  
respect.

BMR: A lot of feminist ad-  
miration for you dates back to  
the time you walked off the Dick  
Cavett Show because of Chad  
Everett. Looking back would you  
have done it differently?

LT: Well, at the time there was  
a build up before that show that  
you have to understand. I'd been  
doing all the talk shows within a  
ten day period and there was a  
thread running through them all  
by the time I got to Cavett. It  
started with David Frost who  
dealt with me as a comedienne  
for about thirty minutes. Then a  
couple of male guests came out  
and they virtually turned their  
backs on me and began discuss-  
ing ‘important’ things, male  
things. Well the show was going  
downhill rapidly and Frost would  
turn to me during the commer-  
cials and say, ‘Do a little Edith  
Ann when we come back to liven  
things up.” I finally did get into a  
slight confrontation with Chet  
Huntley about the environment  
but the real confrontation was  
the acknowledgement that I was  
being excluded, treated in a  
different way. The next day I was  
on the Mike Douglas Show with  

two actresses and a very pom-  
pous English actor. When the  
actor came out he was not only  
patronizing but rude. He turned  
his back on us and dealt with  
Douglas. The other two women  
were acting cute and girlish and  
he kept saying things like, ‘“Set-  

tle down now girls. Calm down,”  
coer if ai ALE ’  

(all actresses are children, etc.)  
he was elegantly taking his leave  
of us and shaking hands all  
around. Well, the show was over  
and my guts were turning over. I  
said, “I wouldn't shake your  
damn hand. I've never been  
treated in such a low way.” He  
twisted his face up and hissed,  
“What's wrong with you, you got  
sex problems?” Then came the  
Johnny Carson show. I was no  
sooner seated when Carson  
asked, “You're not married are  
you?” When I said no he asked,  
“Don't you want to have  
children?” Well, I've never been  
able to lie and I vividly remember  
the emotional experience of my  
heart pounding wildly because  
here I was on national television  
and I had to say, ‘No, I don’t care  
if I never have a child.” This  
illustrated to me how bad the  
culture really was that I would be  

victimized that way so I had to  

turn it around somehow. So I  
commented on the fact that after  
his divorce he didn't have his  
children. So by the time I got to  
the Cavett show later in the  
week I had gone through the  
purge. Those successive shows  

were a total evolution for me.  
Well, Cavett and I had been  
talking and I'd put in my plug for  
women mentioning that my  
Grammy winning record was the  
first winner produced by a  
woman. Then Chad came out  
and talked about his animals,  

two horses, a dog and his most  
insipid comments. I said out of such insidious  
stupidity that I just stood up and  
said, ‘Oh, I gotta go.” It was a  
totally honest reaction, maybe  
the purest moment in life. When  
the production people started  
squeezing my arm and pushing  
me around I got a little nervous.  
I'm glad I didn't go back. They  
would only have patted my hand.  
Chad tried to make some snide  
demeaning remark about my  
sexuality something to the effect  
“my wife likes a man to take  
care of her.” There’s been a lot of  
talk about whether or not I  
should have stayed but in the  
final analysis I don’t deserve the  
credit or discredit for anything  
more than having a totally  
spontaneous reaction.

BMR: So many comediennes’  
humor is of that dumb  
housewife or self-effacing varie-  
ty. Yours never is and all of your  
characters seem to like them-  
selves. Would you comment on  
that?

LT: I never considered doing  
anything on stage just for accep-  
tance, it’s too repugnant to me.  
I prefer doing people who like  
themselves, people who are  

strong, self-assertive. But  
women have a lot to work  

through; there’s a long history of  
equating unattractiveness with  
being funny. I've always con-  
sidered myself beautiful, in-  
telligent and funny. I worked in a  
review with a woman once who  
projected a totally vapid, un-  
interesting, girly quality on  
stage. Back stage she was salty,  
gutsy, perceptive. I would en-  
courage her to do some of that  
stuff on stage and she’d pull up  
and say, “Oh no, I don’t want  
anybody to think I'm unattrac-  
tive.” Women are not supposed  
to be funny. They're not en-  
couraged to do comedy. I realize  
that feminists cannot embrace  
or acknowledge a lot of stuff  
being done by women but  
hopefully there are more young  
women coming up doing comedy  

with perception and intelligence.

BMR: One of the major  
criticisms of the Women's  

Movement has been its lack of  
humor. Do you feel that’s a valid  
criticism?

LT: I think that's true of any  
movement in its first stages; it  
takes a little time. I don’t know  
why the Women’s Movement  
has to be singled out and labeled  
though. Talk about no sense of  
humor! Have you ever been out  
with three or four women and  
tried to ignore a couple of guys  
who were making comments?  
“Hey little ladies, what's  
happening? Buy you a drink?”  
They go nuts, God forbid if you  
said something, you might get  
your face smashed. And if you  
just ignore them they say, ‘Hey,  
you too good for us? What's a  
matter, queers? Lesbians?” So  

BMR: What prompted you to  
do a benefit for Joanne Little?

LT: Several reasons, one  
being the rape issue itself. The  
others are simple — she ob-  
viously needs money and people  
I respect asked me to do it.  
Margaret Sloane is a friend of  
mine and she and Gloria  
Steinem will be speaking. I'll be  
there as well as a young black  
singer with Olivia Records. It will  
be in my hometown of Detroit.

BMR: Do you see the  
separatist tactics within the  
Movement as necessary?

LT: Separatism at this point is  
not acceptable to me personally  
But it's possible that I haven't  
been radicalized yet. I know I  
can't see out of hand rejecting  
half the people of the world yet I  
completely understand and  
relate to women who hold that  
view. It’s the same way I can  
understand very militant blacks;  
I think you need all those voices  
and that kind of extremism on  
one end of the continuum so it all  
shapes out. I’m not in that place  
myself but who knows what I've  
got a lid on. Maybe one day I'll  
strictly play women’s bars.

the prosecutor. Why won’t you  
tell us?

— “Three hundred years ago  
they burned 9 million of us and I  
guess we got a little scared,”  
said A.

— "Your honor I object,” said  
Buckley. “This should not turn  
into a heresy trial.”

In the summation, the  
prosecutor hammered away at  
one theme: Z was telling for-  
tunes for money and not as part  
of a religion. The defense  
witnesses were all biased, she  
said, because they were Z's  
friends. The prosecution  
witnesses, the police officers, on  
the other hand, were not biased.  
If Z were really a religious  
leader, she said, where were  
her followers (ignoring the long  
line of people waiting each day to  
share the 25 seats in the cour-  
troom)?

The defense summation  
charged the jury to deal with the  
case as a religious issue. After  
deliberating for four and a half  
hours, the jury returned the  
guilty verdict.

According to defense at-  
torneys, the jury decided the  
case on the letter of the law and  
not necessarily because they  
disbelieved Z. The law itself, the  
attorneys feel, is un-  
constitutional. They plan to  
appeal on several grounds:

1) that the municipal code  
violates the establishment  
clause of the Constitution in that  
it requires a person to come into  
court and put her religious  

beliefs on trial.

2) that it is an abridgement of  
freedom of religion.

3) that it is overbroad and  
vague, in that (for example) a  
person has the right to be put on  
notice if she is violating the law.

4) that it is a violation of  
freedom of speech.

5) that it is subject to the  
doctrine of preemption in that  
the city law makes illegal what  
the state law does not.

The appeal process, if it goes  
all the way to the U.S. Supreme  
Court, could take up to two years  
and considerable money. Funds  
are desperately needed to con-  
tinue this fight. Send your con-  
tributions to WOMANSOUL

Blvd., Venice CA 90291.

By shifting some responsibility and work to the core group we have  
been able to reduce our salary expenditures which will hopefully help  
contribute to BMR’s eventual self-sufficiency. For the specific women  
responsible for these positions, call the office (322-2010). To get  
involved in the core group, call the office before coming to any meeting.  
Office hours are from 9:30 to 4:30 with a break for lunch, Monday thru  
Friday.

The “friends” part of the paper is women who have other priorities in  
their lives but still want to work with the paper. There are approximately  
20-25 members in this group. This group is also always open to new  
women. Many writers, production workers and distribution women are  
here. A system of checks and balances exists between the “core” and  
“friends” group through the open core group meeting the first Monday  
of the month.

The core group has been functioning for about three weeks and has  
been a real “upper” for BMR. The office is alive with the energy of  
women working together to get the job done so that a few don't get  
burnt and burned out. It looks good and it will surely take lots of work  
and a commitment to confrontation and change to make BMR an  
integral part of the present and future of feminism.
