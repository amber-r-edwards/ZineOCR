Big Mama Oasis

Dear Big Mama; hello!

Finding your publication at King  
Soopers in Boulder was like finding  
a shady oasis in the desert...WHEW!  
Thanks. Very impressed with your  
March issue, especially the article  
"The Politics of Self-Defense” (Ed.  
note: which BNR repainted per  
Northwest Passage) and now I want a  
subscription. Enclosed is my check  
for $6.

Keep up the good work!!!

Keep Those Cards  
And Vacillations  
Coming In

Dear BMR:

Thank you so much for the years of  
contact with Women that you have pro-  
vided. I have moved from rural Ohio  
to San Francisco and am immersed (the  
best of all hot tubs!) in the women's  
community here. I am not reading  
Big Mama Rag--I'm living it now!  
Because I'm also poor, since I'm not  
finding time to read, I'm hereby can-  
celling my subscription. My best  
wishes to you.

P.S. I'm experiencing pangs of dis-  
loyalty by cancelling...

Dear Big Mama Rag Staff:

Please disregard my request to  
cancel Big Mama Rag. I've changed  
my mind: it is a source of informa-  
tion that must be read, even in San  
Francisco.  
tion for another year ($6).

You're Welcome

Dear BMR:

Thank you so much for your moving  
review (see BMR, May, 1980). Yours  
is the first review that I've re-  
ceived since the book came from the  
printer a month ago and I've been  
sitting on pins and needles ever  
since. Your response was more than  
I'd dreamed of and it made me cry--  
happy tears.

Thank you again,

Heather

Non-White Lesbian Metalsmiths

Dear Friends,

I am a lesbian writer/researcher  
who has written feature articles on  
lesbian history and culture which  
have appeared in Lavender Woman, Dyke  
Magazine, and Sinister Wisdom.

Currently I am gathering informa-  
tion and material for an article on  
lesbian metalsmiths in the United  
States in the 1970s. My informants  
so far have been white lesbians.  
Therefore, I am wondering if you  
might be able to help with the  
following query?

Do you know of any Native Amer-  
ican, Hispanic American, Asian Amer-

Windhaven Problems

Dear Sisters:

Enclosed is a copy of a letter I  
sent to one of your advertisers, the  
publishers of Windhaven, a feminist  
science-fiction journal. I believe  
you would want to know the problems  
encountered by readers who respond to  
ads in your publication.

Sincerely,

Dear Women:

WHERE ARE YOU????

On November 10, 1979, I sent you a  
check for $6.00 for a subscription to  
Windhaven. After waiting 2 months  
for a magazine or some word from you,  
I wrote, threatening to notify the  
publication where I had seen your ad  
if I did not receive my magazine. On  
February 13, I received a copy of the  
magazine with a letter of apology and  
was satisfied.

I loved the magazine. So on Feb-  
ruary 14, 1980 I sent a check for  
$7.80 for copies of the first 4

American, or African American lesbian  
metalsmiths practicing this art in  
the United States during this past  
decade? I would be very appreciative  
of any contacts you could pass on to  
me. I do most of my interviewing

cassette tape for those who choose to  
speak rather than write. There is a  
questionnaire which I send to all

I thank you.

APOLOGY

The BMR Collective would like to publicly apologize to the  
Our Backs Collective for failing to credit  
them for the story "Woman  
Is Charged For Reporting She Was Raped"

(we should have said that it was reprinted  
from OOB, and though we picked it up from Liberation News Service  
we will try to see that such oversights do not happen in the  
future.

Again I waited 2 months, re-  
ceiving nothing but my cancelled  
check (which had been cashed by DAY  
MOON DESIGNS on February 28th).

On April 11, I wrote to describe  
what had happened and to ask that  
someone find out what had happened  
to my order for back issues. Again  
I heard nothing.

It is almost 2 months, and I am be-  
coming impatient. Since November of  
last year I have sent IKESDATTER  
PRESS a total of $13.80 and have re-  
ceived one magazine. Since February  
I have received nothing at all, not  
even the courtesy of a response to my  
letters. Please send me the maga-  
zines I have ordered and long since  
paid for, or return my money.

In order to protect other readers  
of the feminist and lesbian press, I  
am sending copies of this letter to  
those publications in which I have  
seen ads for Windhaven. I love to  
support women's ventures whenever I  
can. I love your magazine and the  
concept behind it. However, I do ex-  
pect at least a minimum level of res-  
ponsibility and professionalism in  
return.

Sincerely,

Mary Ellen Clinton

Editor's Note: Sisters, even though  
the above letter seems to indicate a  
lapse of some sort on Windhaven's  
part, we have had them as advertisers  
for over a year and this is the first  
complaint of any kind that we have  
received. Feminist publications,  

Big Mama included, usually function  
without a single paid staffer--and so  
our level of efficiency is usually  
something less than that of the  
Ladies Home Journal, or other  
"straight" publications. When a pub-  
lication only has a few women to do  
everything, some things sometimes  
don't get done, especially if those  
women are employed full-time else-  
where, which is usually the case.

We would like very much to pub-  
lish a reply from Windhaven, and to  
know if other women have had problems  
getting response or otherwise, from  
Windhaven, or from us, for that  
matter.
