Millington's song, "We're gonna get
it, I can tell," which followed,
sparked her voice to produce some
nice highs, and the lyrics written
by her do strike a feminist note,
"Run, Where you gonna go?... Foolin'
with nature is the ultimate burn..."

"Ship of Fools," by Williamson,
also had lyrics wide with promise,
"Sail on, Sweet Dreamer, sail on/
Don't let them take the wind out of
your sails."
Especially here made these lyrics ring
true - her voice is tinged with sil-
ver reminding one of Stevie Nicks,
female vocalist.

Nearing the end of the second set,
Williamson took up a guitar and joined
Millington, Robbins and Davis in
a ‘60s medley. “Mama Didn't Lie,"

"Do You Wanna Dance?" and "Mr. Postman"

Well they got women prison guards,
but I still ain't satisfied
With so many still behind bars
I still ain't satisfied,
I don’t plead guilt, I don't want no bum deal
I ain't asking for crumbs, I want the whole meal,

They liberalized abortion,
but I still ain't satisfied
‘Cause it still costs a fortune,
and I still ain't satisfied.
I'm singing about control of my own womb,
And no reform is going to change my tune.

They give out pennies here and there,
but I still ain't satisfied

To set up centers for child care
and I still ain't satisfied,

And while we work at slave wages

They brainwash our kids at tender ages.

I did decide that halfway won't do.

Well they got women on TV,
but I still ain't satisfied,
‘Cause co-optation's all I see
but I still ain't satisfied.
They call me Ms., they sell me blue
They call it "Women's Lib," they make
it sound obscene.

And I still ain't satisfied

And I still ain't satisfied

I got some pride, and I won't be lied to.

Williamson compares herself to a
horse running free inside fences, who
is still allowed to show spirit. She
adds that she does not want to give
instructions on how to be free to peo-
ple who already think they are.

"They" who are not free, she says,
are those people who are held in by
limited minds that want to label things.

On labeling she says that she doesn't
know if "women's music" could be
written by a man, that the "women's
movement" is characterized by needless
criticism and wasted energy - and the
end result of all this is that the ma-
gic there is gets picked apart.

However, there is the need to label

The women's movement is characterized
