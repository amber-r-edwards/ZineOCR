African women. We believe in
the absolute, unequivocal,
political, social and econo-
mic equality of African wo-
men and men. We believe that
a fundamental test of the
progressive revolutionary
character of any organiza-
tion, party, movement or
society is its commitment,
confirmed in practice, to
the destruction of the spe-
cial oppression of women and
the elevation of women to
their rightful place as
equal partners and leaders
in the forward motion of the
development of human society
and as leaders, makers and
shapers of human history.

As the pamphlet says:

The Party's position on
this question is substantial
and it has been continuous.
Nor is our position simply
one of words, although words
are important. The words
represent a contract between
the members of the Party and
between the Party and the
people. The words are a
statement of principle that
the Party as an organization
holds its membership to and
voluntarily calls on the
people to hold the Party to.

the first time to North
American people for revolu-
tionary internationalism
through a strategic rela-
tionship under the leader-
ship of the APSP. Since
then, through the practice
of solidarity, and through
struggle from the APSP, we
have deepened that under-
standing and strengthened
the strategic accountability
necessary to overturn oppor-
tunism. We have developed
the politics of material
solidarity which is our res-
ponsibility as part of the
affluent North American
working class toward the
re-distribution of wealth
and payment of reparations

to the anti-colonial struggle.

In the past seven and half
years, many members of the
solidarity work have been
women who had first parti-
cipated in the feminist
movement but rejected the
analysis that men are the
enemy, the narrowness of a
movement without a class
analysis or an international-
ist world view, the stagna-
tion and opportunism which
has engulfed the movement
in the absence of a revolu-

It is Chairman Omali that
has developed the APSP ideo-
logically and as an organi-
zation which is strong in
its leading participation
of African women. It is also
Chairman Omali Yeshitela
that has struggled for poli-
tical breakthroughs in
building a principled rela-
tionship for North American
solidarity with the black
movement. Starting from the
analysis that the struggle
is against colonialism
rather than racism, and that
North American people do
have a material class in-
terest in the end of imper-
ialism and capitalism; the
APSP founded a North Ameri-
can solidarity committee in
1976, opening the doors for

tionary strategy and rela-
tionship to the anti-colo-
nial struggle of African
people. Ajowa Ifateyo and
the other two African women
making the current attacks
were our leadership in dev-
eloping the politics of
material solidarity with

the African struggle. They
struggled for policies such
as the understanding that
interpersonal relationships
between Party and solidarity
members were against disci-
pline because there is no
personal solution to colo-
nialism and because of the
kind of slander on the pol-
itical relationship that the
personal relations would
open up. Yet it is these
same women who have rejected

the anti-colonial struggle
and reverted to bourgeois
feminist politics. It is
these same women who refer
to solidarity as "guilt
ridden white folks," and
who, when challenged poli-
tically by African women in
the APSP lied that Chairman
Omali sleeps with white wo-
men. To substantiate this
charge they published a
photo clipped from The
Burning Spear showing Omali
Yeshitela in a comradely
embrace with Christina
Vasquez, deliberately cut-
ting off the caption which
identifies her as a leading
member of the Colombian rev-
olutionary movement on tour
with the APSP to build the
unity of the two struggles.
The APSP and the Committee
in Solidarity With African
Independence, while recog-
nizing and fighting against
both the colonial oppression
of African women and the
oppression of North American
women in this society, are
not feminist organizations.
We believe that the best
interest of both African
and North American women,
as well as the oppressed
and working peoples through-
out the world, are served by
building the movement and
organizations of African
workers which will see the
destruction of U.S. imper-
ialism from within. And that
the immediate liberation of
women is gained through ac-
tive participation and lead-
ership in making those
struggles and building the
movement.

We suggest all persons
serious about building a
revolutionary movement buy
and discuss The Black Work-
ing Class Vs. The U.S. Gov-
ernment - Building the Off-
ensive Against Slander and
FBI Counter Intelligence
(send $1.95 plus 75¢ postage
to Burning Spear Publica-
tions, 7622 MacArthur Blvd.,
Oakland, CA 94605), because
the implications of renewed
FBI activity are significant
to the whole movement.

We want people to take a
stand against the genocide
of black people in the U.S.
by supporting the genocide
watch being organized by the
African National Reparations
Organization (ANRO). The
World Tribunal on Repara-
tions for Black People in
the U.S. mandated ANRO to be
that body monitoring U.S.
treatment of black people.
The genocide watch is part
of the Reparations Campaign
and the campaign to force
the U.S. to ratify the U.N.

Convention on the Prevention
and Punishment of the Crime
of Genocide as well as some
other human rights treaties
which the U.S. has refused
to ratify since 1946. The
genocide watch will have a
toll-free, 800 number so
that black communities all
over the U.S. can report
genocidal attacks to ANRO.
In this way the isolation
of the black communities
will be broken and the
struggle internationalized.
To support the genocide
watch and ratification cam-
paign make a monthly pledge
or send a check to ANRO at
the above address.

CSAI and the APSP invite
you to experience the prac-
tice of solidarity work
first hand. Twenty years
ago, in 1964, was the Miss-
issippi Freedom Summer, when
hundreds of North American
students went to the south
and actively defied Jim Crow
laws and gave solidarity to
the Civil Rights Movement.
It changed their lives and
laid the basis for the North
American movements in the
60's. This year CSAI is call-
ing for the Oakland Summer
Project '84 - a chance for
North American people to
come to Oakland and make
history building the soli-
darity movement of the 80's.
We suggest all people sub-
scribe to The Burning Spear
newspaper to follow the
political and theoretical
developments of this move-
ment and to get an analysis
of world events from the
perspective of the black
working class. (Subscrip-
tions are $10, checks to
The Burning Spear to the
above address.) CSAI in-
vites all comments and dis-
cussion stemming from this
paper.

STAND ON THE FORWARD SIDE!
