WOMEN’S  
HEALTH SERVICE  
CLINIC  

W.A.R.N. (Women Of All Red Nations) is organizing on a  

massive scale. They are in need of funds to print informat-  

ion, to travel, and pay for legal litigations they are in-  
volved in. As women, we must stand together in the struggle.  
All donations are greatly appreciated.  

Also available—T-shirts!!! These T-shirts are beautiful  
screened with the W.A.R.N. Woman on the front, and the say-  
ing, "A nation is not conquered until the hearts of its wo-  
men are on the ground."  

The T-shirts, 100% cotton, are yellow & come in sizes small,  
medium, large, and extra-large. The cost is $8.00 plus $2.00  
mailing fee. Send donations. Send requests for further inf-  
ormation and T-shirt orders to: Stephanie Autumn - W.A.R.N.
