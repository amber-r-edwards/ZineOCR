Dessie Woods

The legal struggle to free  
Dessie Woods, a black woman  
sentenced to 22 years for de-  
fending herself and a friend  
against a would-be white rap-  
ist took another turn on Feb.  
26, when the U.S. Court of  
Appeals in Atlanta heard a  
habeas corpus petition filed  
by her attorney.

The appeal is based on sev-  
eral rights violations which  
occurred in Woods' trial, one  
of which is the fact that  
there was no evidence of arm-  
ed robbery for which Woods  
was convicted on Feb. 2, 1976  
along with manslaughter.  
These are two contradictory  
verdicts since a conviction  
of manslaughter would mean  
that the shooting was done in  
the heat of the moment, where-  
as armed robbery implies a  
planned action.

The issue of the Special  
Prosecutor which the Horne  
family (the attempted rapist)  
hired to make sure Dessie  
got convicted will also be  
challenged. The Special Pro-  
secutor, although legal in  
most states, is legal in  
Georgia if he is under the  
control and direction of the  
district attorney. Dessie's

Rita Silk Nauni Update

Rita Silk Nauni, a Sioux  
woman charged with first-de-  
gree murder and shooting with  
the intent to kill, has been  
serving a jail term since  
Sept., 1979 (see BMR Vol. 8,  
No. 5, page 7).

Approached by Oklahoma City  
airport police for littering,  
she and her son ran away.  
They were chased, grabbed,  
and the police officer began  
to handcuff the boy, causing  
a struggle which resulted in  
Rita shooting and killing  
the officer and wounding the  
other.

Rita had been sentenced to  
50 years in prison and her  
bail had been set at $100,000.

Some good news—the money  
has been raised for Rita's  
bond ($64,000 and she will be  
bonded for the remaining  
$40,000). Also, on January  
20, 1981, the Oklahoma State  
Court of Appeals ruled that  
Rita is entitled to a free  
copy of the transcript (pre-  
viously she would have had  
to pay $7000). She should  
be out very soon!

The defense committee,  
which is made up of 8 women  
(7 American Indian and one  
white woman) has set a ten-  
tative appeals budget of  
$19,000. Attorneys in sev-  
eral states are working on  
the case.

Sasha Cady Not Guilty

Sasha Cady, a Seattle  
woman, came to the aid of a  
woman who was being battered  
on the front porch of the  
apartment building in which  
she lived. While sheltering  
the woman in her home, Sasha  
was attacked by the batterer  
inside her own apartment and  
she shot him in self-defense,  
wounding him.

Five policemen responded  
to Sasha's phone call of the  
incident. They took turns in  
her apartment reading the  
titles of her leftist and  
feminist books and studying  
the posters on her walls. A  
Sgt. Hunt, in charge of the  
investigation told Sasha, "The  
question is whether or not to  
book you." He then pointed to  
a "You Can't Rape a .38" poster  
and said to Sasha, "You’re the  
kind of people we like to get.  
You're the opposite of a rap-  
ist." He then ordered the  
posters on her walls photogr-  
aphed as evidence, claiming  
it was to show the dimensions  
of the room.

Sasha was held in King Coun-  
ty Jail for 5 days and char-  
ged with first degree assault.  
Originally bail was $5000 but  
she was able to get out on her  
own personal recognizance.

No charges had been filed  
against the batterer. Sasha's  
charges were dropped to sec-  
ond degree assault with fire-  
arm. If found guilty the  
charge carries a minimum of  
5 years.

A defense committee had been  
formed doing publicity, fund-  
raising and outreach.

The case came to trial in  
March, the jury was made up  
of 8 women and 4 men. The  
trial lasted for 5 days and  
the judge would not allow  
Sasha's expert witnesses to  
testify. Sasha took the  
stand as did the man who did  
the battering. The woman who  
Sasha protected also took the  
stand and testified against  
Sasha. A woman who was ident-  
ified as a friend of the bat-  
tered woman also took the  
stand stating she had been to  
a meeting of the defense com-  
mittee and lied about  
statements Sasha had made.  
Another witness reputed her  
testimony.

The jury deliberated for  
14 days and found Sasha Cady  
NOT GUILTY.

The Womyn's Defense Commit-  
tee will continue to function  
as there are 3 more cases in  
the Seattle area of women  
who have upheld the right to  
self-defense. For more info
