New York -  
Child Pornography

Women Against Pornography

Since 1977 N.Y. State had  
section 263.15 of the Penal  
Law, making it a crime to  
promote sexual performance by  
a child. On May 12, 1981, in a  
5 to 2 decision, the N.Y.  
State Court of Appeals over-  
turned 263.15 on the ground  
that profiting from the sex-  
ual exploitation of children  
“infringes rights guaranteed  
by the First Amendment. Only  
if such material is judged  
"obscene", ruled the Court,  
would the promotion of such  
films be illegal.

Women Against Pornography,  
Assemblyman Howard Lasher,  
(Demo-Brooklyn) author of  
263.15, Florence Rush, social  
worker and author of The Best  
Kept Secret: Sexual Abuse of  
Children; Laurie Woods, att-  
orney at the National Center  
for Women and Family Law; Jayet  
O'Hare, a member of N.Y.  
Women Against Rape, and Tru-  
dee Able Peterson, former  
counselor at Covenant House  
and author of the forthcoming  
book Children of the Evening  
were all present on June 1,  
1981 at a press conference  
speaking out against the  
Court's decision.

It appears that the Court  
has distorted the intent and  
value of 263.15, which deals  
not with obscenity and First  
Amendment rights, but addres-  
ses the issue of sexual abuse  
and the exploitation of chil-  
dren. Assemblyman Lasher  
states: "It is irrelevant to  
the child whether or not the  
material is obscene or has a  
literary, artistic, political  
or social value." The Child  
sex industry is a multimil-  
lion dollar industry. It's  
estimated that over 300,000  

children under the age of 16  
are engaged in child porn  
alone. The New York Times  
reports that as many as 264  
different porno magazines  
featuring sexual acts invol-  
ving children as young as  
3 years of age are sold nat-  
ionally. Before 263.15 was  
enacted, films as well as  
magazines and other publica-  
tions portraying children in  
actual or simulated sexual  
intercourse, bestiality or  
sado-masochistic abuse, were  
readily available. Manhattan  

District Attorney Robert M.  
Morgenthau said that the sta-  
tute had a “significant de-  
terrent effect" on child por-  
nographers and that in "ta-  
king one weapon away from us,  
it will make it more diffi-  
cult to prosecute."

"Freedom of expression" is  
often paid for at the physi-  
cal and psychological expense  
of children. Dr. Helen Rod-  
riquez-Trias, a pediatri-  
cian who has treated hun-  
dreds of victims of sexual  
abuse, reports that “in all  
cases...there was profound  
harm... At best, the child  
suffers only from an im-  
paired self-image...At worst  
the child is shattered, dri-  
ven to self-destruction or  
has life-long dysfunction  
leading to delinquency, pro-  
stitution and drug abuse."

Can a society that really  
cares about the welfare and  
well-being of its children  
say -- as the Court has  
said-- that the act of rap-  
ing and the filming of the  
rape of an eleven year old  
is illegal, but the promo-  
ting and profiting from  
such a film is legal? Can a  
society that has long held  
that children must be pro-  
tected from exploitation  
now say that a child of  
four or fourteen can give  
"consent" to his/her appear-  
ance in a commercial sexual  
exploitation film? To call  
this an issue of "freedom  
of speech" for pornograph-  
ers is to ignore the rights  
of children to be protected  
from such commercial ex-  
ploitation.

California -  
Lesbian Custody

The following is reprinted  
from Mom's Apple Pie, the  
Newsletter of the Lesbian  
Mothers' National Defense  
Fund,

A lesbian in a rural Cali-  
fornia town decided she want-  
ed to raise a child. She opt-  
ed for AI (Artificial Insem-  
ination) and began looking  
for donors. She met a gay  
man through some friends who  
agreed to be a sperm donor.  
The donor made clear that he  
did not want to have any re-  
sponsibility around financi-  
ally supporting the child and  
a verbal agreement was reach-  
ed that he would not be a  

significant person in the  
child's life, would not have  
visitation or any other  
rights to the child. The mo-  
ther did agree to letting the  
donor see the child after  
birth. She assumed the donor  
would respect her wishes and  
that he being gay made it  
less an issue that there  
would ever be any problem  
with custody. However, as the  
woman became more visibly  
pregnant, the donor began  
telling people he was the  
father of the child. He app-  
arently got positive rein-  
forcement for this and even-  
tually told his family of  

his fatherhood. The woman  
gave birth to a son. She no-  
tified the donor and he  
visited the child. Shortly  
after he began making demands  
stating that as the father  

he was entitled to rights.

-Yvonne Indart

He eventually got a lawyer,  
partially financed by an  
older couple who raised him.  

The case is still being  
heard. The motion to dismiss  
was denied by the court. A  
temporary custody hearing  
came up--but at the same  
time the district attorney  
intervened in the case sta-  
ting that if the donor is  
declared father he will be  
charged for back child sup-  
port payments since the mo-  
ther has been on AFDC. Since  
this action, the donor has  
backed down somewhat. He is  
not being allowed visitation  
now until the next hearing  
(court date is late summer).

So far the judge has deemed  
“this is not a regular custo-  
dy case." The courtroom has  
been closed during all trials  
and names sealed per the  
father's request.

The mother has a local at-  
torney and, of course, needs  

any and all financial support.  

She is also being helped by  

the Lesbian Rights Project  
in San Francisco, California.  
The position of the attor-  

ney at LRP regarding AI is  
that women have to be  
extremely careful if they are  
not using totally anonymous  
donors. No matter if the  
donor is gay, political, or  
sympathetic. She also stress-  
ed the necessity of written  
agreements and feels if they  
had a written agreement, they  
might never have gone to  
trial.

California -  
Midwife Victory

The office of Governor  
Jerry Brown contacted Delia  
Burns attorney offering ex-  
ecutive clemency upon receipt  
of 5,000 supportive signa-  
tures.

Delia Burns, midwife from  
Redesa, Orange County, CA  
was recently convicted of  
practicing medicine without  
a license. She was sentenced  
to 30 days jail, 3 years pro-  
bation, same treatment for a  
felon. The conviction set a  
precedent against the prac-  
tice of midwifery in Calif-  
ornia,

However, the Governor re-  
sponded by supporting the  
statement that "in times  
when it is unsafe to walk our  
streets, the crime rate at  
unparalleled levels and our  
jails are overflowing, it is  
an outrage to prosecute and  
jail a young mother for the  
practice of midwifery, a  
helping profession."

The overturning of this  

conviction could mean a pre-  
cedent setting victory for  

the practice of midwifery in  
California. Also, the State  
of California has mandated  
the sanction of three pi-  
lot projects to train mid-  
wives. This could lead to  

a uniform training and lis-  
censure of lay midwives in  
California.

For now, $7,000 is urgent-  
ly needed to pay Delia  
Burn's lawyer. Send money  
to:
