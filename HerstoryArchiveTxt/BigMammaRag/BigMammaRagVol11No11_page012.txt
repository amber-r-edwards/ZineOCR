In May of this year I bor-  
rowed money to fly to Syra-  
cuse New York to go to the  
11th Annual International  
Conference For Human Rights  
and Against Psychiatric Ov-  
pression, a gathering of ex-  
psychiatric inmates. I had  

Meanwhile, ex-inmates, pri-  
soners, the young in juven-  
ile jails and "foster ho-  
mes", the old in nursing  

homes, the homeless all cry  

out against their oppression.  

And we like best to call  

"crazy" and shock and lock  
and drug and shut them up  

so that their cries are not  
heard...I know about this  
too. I say, I know--I know  
because right now as I write  
I do not want to know that  
another horror again inter-  

em  

us feel better about it.  

In Syracuse we spent days  
demonstrating against the  
psychiatric system. We spent  
nights and days in support  
of each other. We spent days  
to define politics that  
identify the enemy as psy-  
chiatry and drugs and alco-  
hol--not the person still  
seeing their doctor, not  
the person hooked on dope,  
not the alcoholic, not  
those in recovery. We spent  
days to continue to build  

mental patients liberation movement  

been thinking that I could  
not afford to go--but could-  
n't afford not to. I fled  
towards the political/per-  
sonal company of other ex-  
inmates. Some kind of survi-  
val mechanism. Before I left  
Denver, it seems like I was  
fighting with all my best  
friends and political allies  
centering around political  
issues raised by the Mental  
Patients Liberation Movement.  
How hard it is to unlearn  
the "medical model of mental  
illness, the myth of mental  
illness."  

When I first got to Syra-  
cuse the conference started  
with a party. My friend com-  
es up to me and says how  
great it is to be in a room  
full of deviants. Because of  
our shared experience in  
psychiatric institutions  
and our shared experience  
with "madness" and "visions"  
and "hallucinations" and  
pain and fear and rage and  
loss of humanity, our degra-  
dation...I say I know--I  
know.  

This doesn't mean that  
everyone at the conf. had/  
has the same politics. But  
the relief of struggling po-  
litically/working with/being  
with people for 4 or 5 days  
...where the stigma of being  
a mental patient loses its  
power is great, is so impor-  
tant to me. Taking power  
back through our understand-  
ing of how psychiatry oper-  
ates for social control. To  
organize against how they  
would have us think and how  
they would have us behave.  

About 150 ex-inmates from  
across North America spent  
days struggling over the fu-  
ture of our movement. Racism,  
classism, sexism, anti-Semi-  
tism-issues that we have to  
attack in our movement and  
also in the "Mental Health  
System"/in psychiatry. To  
understand how different  
oppressions come into our  
experience with and under-  
standing of psychiatry. Psy-  
chiatry says your problem  
is your mother (now yours).  

rupts the flow of life. No  
more rapes, no more batter-  
ing, no more dead children,  
no more shock treatment, no  
more incest, no more geno-  
cide, no more talk of not  
being able to keep going on,  
no more US in El Salvador,  
no more psychiatry, no more.  

And sometimes I cannot  
bear to hear all of this--I  
know that I am not alone in  
this--and I create a great  
silence around me. And I do  
not answer the phone and  
sometimes I am frightened  
to leave my house. And as  
much as I see this withdraw-  
al as an act of survival, I  
also think it could kill me.  
I say this because I think  
that it is in opposition to  
all my politics. Psychiatry  
tells us that there is a li-  
mit to how and when friends  
and relatives can “help" a  
"mentally ill" person, and  
after that point a trained  
expert is needed.  

My politics tell me that  
this is no time to shut  
down all ties to my friends  
so that all I am left with  
for "help" is the psychia-  
tric system...and I wonder  
maybe I do need to be in  
the "hospital". Psychiatry  
and medicine have us well  
trained. Powerless to heal  
as we can--and care enough  
for friends in such pain  
and rage as we can. We don't  
believe it's possible. We are  
too frightened. We are too  
frightened that we might  
not be able to take life  
any more. We are too frigh-  
tened to begin to feel our  
anger--we wonder if we can  
ever stop. Where will it all  
end? And yet our choice to  
fight or not is no choice at  
all because as ex-inmates we  
are so vulnerable to being  
trapped and tortured by the  
shrinks that we must contin-  
ue to act against the psy-  
chiatric system. And in do-  
ing that, against all systems  
that push genocidal politics  
toward people, for psychia-  
try supports them all. And  
then works with us to make

groups to be with and ways  
to live that could keep peo-  
ple--us--me, out of the psy-  
chiatric system.  
Many of us participated in  
a Civil Disobedience action  
to demand an end to shock  
torture (I never had shock  

not want to arrest us--said  
there wasn't enough room in  
their jail.  

We did have some contact  
with the inmates inside Ben-  
jamin Rush--yelling at each  
other through the windows.  
Eventually all the curtains  
were drawn and the staff  
tried to keep the inmates  
from speaking with us. The  
action ended in a compromise  
with a press conference be-  
tween ex-inmates and the  
head shrink of the institu-  
tion. There were inmates who  
yelled their names to us  
that wanted to speak to the  
press too. Those inmates  
were denied access to  
the press conference "for  
their own good"--that in  
their "mental illness" they  
might say or do something  
they might later regret. One  
of the inmates we had the  

most contact with ended up

but lived with women on the  
ward who were being shocked)  
outside of Benjamin Rush Psy-  
chiatric Center. It was an  
old 2 story motel turned in-  
to a "mental hospital"--they  
‘re everywhere, they're ev-  
erywhere. The cops didn't  
want to arrest us and we ended  
up "sitting in" there over-  
night...Blockading one or 2  
or 3 doors at a time to es-  
calate our harassment. A  
support committee brought us  
food and blankets: and helped  
us keep in communication  

with each other at the dif-  
ferent doors. The cops did  

in seclusion that night--  
staff telling her that she  
was "too upset". Inmates  
told us that the morning  
ward meeting between staff  
and inmates was spent ex-  
plaining why we were wrong  
and "crazy" and they were  
right. My friend doing the  
action with us had almost  
been killed twice in the  
same week inside Benjamin  
Rush Psychiatric Center--a  
"side-effect" of "sleep the-  
rapy". They overdrug you and  
keep you locked in seclusion.  
It's also called somatic  
"therapy" which implies
