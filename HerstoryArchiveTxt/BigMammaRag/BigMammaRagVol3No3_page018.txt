extra for the guards to worry
about. So we got to have it.
During the picnic someone
took a tennis shoe and started
running around. We are never
allowed any horseplay but
when we all started running
around playing none of the
guards moved. This was when
the associate warden was
under pressure during the
investigations and I guess she
thought it would be better not
to do anything. And believe
me, there could have been
scores of male guards from
the medium security prison
that is just over the hill there
in a second if she wanted
them.

Getting It Together

When you first go down
there they give you education
tests. I got a high enough
score on the tests so that I
could take the GED. I had two
weeks to study for the test. At
first most of it is just
refreshing your memory. It
had been twelve years since
I'd been to school. Then
things got rougher academically
but I had this friend who
was my backbone. She would
help me when I got into a rut.
And with the help of Pam I
made it. She badgered me into
doing it.

Then I talked to the
counselor over at minimum
security and he showed me a
pamphlet by the University
Without Walls people who

~ program over at Metro
Heights College in Denver. I
was thinking of going to
Metro or Community College
but he told me about
scholarships for this program
so I applied. I got one of two
scholarships for women. I had
made it. It blew my mind. I
must have grinned for about a
week.

Things were happening to
me so fast. I was so full of
b.s. inside from the prison
that when this happened I felt
that I was really floating
around and it turns out to be
the best thing that ever
happened to me.

There is an inside team and
an outside team in the UWW
program. The inside team is
still in prison and the outside
team is people who are on
parole. So at the first session
of the whole program everybody
was together at Camp
George West which is in
Golden for classes. The other
woman who was in the
program and myself were
housed at Montview Girls’
School. I used to go back to
Montview at night with a
headache from absorbing so
much. I was learning at a rate
that I just couldn’t believe.

Since I grew up in the
streets I would respond
negatively and physically to
everything and everyone. Now
I was learning that I could
change things just by using
my head and that there were
resources available to me that
were dynamite and that gave
me the confidence that I
needed and the book learning
I needed.

When the session was over

and I had to go back to the
prison environment it was
really hard. The first time I
went to the prison I didn’t
know what was going on but
this time I did and it was so
hard for me and especially for
my family.

When I was back in the
structured environment one
thing that hit me was that if all
the inmates didn’t start
working together we wouldn’t
get anything done. Up until
now people were on a racial
trip. In the TV room the Blacks
would be together and the
Chicanas would be in a group
and the whites would stay
together. They would all
intermingle but it was an
obvious thing that they were
separate groups. So I became
aware (and so did some
others) that we were so busy
hassling each other that we
were going to stay in the same
rut.

Inmate Council

So some of us were elected
by the population to be in the
inmate council. At first we
wrote up a really formal thing
introducing ourselves to the
administration and trying to
get a better attitude going
between the guards and the
women inmates. The guards
tend to be really close-minded
to a lot of things - there is no
room for change with them.
They have set patterns they
stick to.

You start to act like a robot
here and before long you're
responding to buzzers to eat,
to sleep. That was basically
the rapport between the
administration and inmates.

So we started with menial
things, small rule changes
like being allowed to have
more clothes and picnics in
the yard. The associate
warden pretty mellow

ea es as

. 0 " we
came up with the idea for a
work-release program.

Everybody participated in
this proposal. I don’t think
that it ever happened before
that the whole prison popula-
tion participated in the same
thing and supported it and
really got behind it. Everyone
recognized the need. Espe-
cially the women who had
children and the women who
were federal prisoners who
were a long way from their
families or anybody who
could visit them.

The jobs that we had in the
prison were useless and
meaningless. You are just
working for the state making
shirts for the men in prison
and for patients at the state
hospitals. How much incen-
tive can a person get by
earning 15 to 40 cents a day?

We wrote up the proposal.
We had everything covered
down to where the partici-
pants would put their clothes
and what kind of transporta-
tion could be used. We
figured that the money we
made would be split up three
ways: one-third to the state
for our maintenance,
one-third to savings, and one-third
to the woman for her family.
We gave the proposal to May
Gillespie, the associate ward-
en. We gave her time to read it
(about two days) and waited
for an answer. We waited and
waited. We met with her but
she hadn’t read it yet. So we
waited another two weeks
and then hit her up with it
again. She had to say
something now. She said that
she was all for work-release
but that, you know, girls can
get pregnant. That was it. We
were stunned. I can’t recall
anyone’s expression because I
went into shock that she
would say that.

I think that for a long time
after that I thought “where’s
this lady's head at?”

Gettin’ Out

The inmate council was
getting a lot of things together
and I applied for parole. I kind
of knew that if anybody had a
chance I did since I was
starting to get my head
together and responding to
things like the UWW program
and I don’t think that Ms.
Gillespie was comfortable
with that. To tell you the truth
I think that it scared the shit
out of her when she realized
that the inmate population
had a chance of getting it
together.

During that time I’m sure
she was under pressure
because the warden of the
prison had been suspended.
Oh that was the final reason
for no work-release program
because a permanent warden
hadn't been appointed. But
Alex Wilson has been the
warden for some time and I
still don’t see any work-re-
lease program for the women.

Anyway, I met with the
parole board on a Friday. It
usually takes about two weeks
to hear if you got it or not.
There's a lot of red tape to go
through and a lot of anxiety to
experience. But I got my
answer on Saturday the next
day and the board doesn’t
even work on Saturday. They
took me down to Canon City
to buy my clothes on that
Monday and on Tuesday I was

on my way to Denver. And,
what a coincidence, on the
next day (Wednesday) the
Grand Jury was down there to
talk to a lot of people. All I
know is that I would have had
a hell of a lot to say to them if
I would have been there.

When I got out it was really
a strange trip. I had been in
there 8½ months and my head
was pretty messed up. I love
my family very much and we
had always been close phy-
sically - hugging type people
and after I got out I would
really feel awkward every time
anyone would put their hands
on me. Sometimes I would
even pull away. I never
thought how important it is to
be able to touch somebody.

Right after I got out I started
school and I would be at the
school for an hour and then I'd
get this damndest insecure
feeling and I would have to go
home and sit there for a while.
There would be no reason for
this. I just needed to go home.
It took me a while to be able to
hug somebody and to be able
to let somebody kiss and hug
me or show some kind of
affection. I’m really glad that
I’m over that now.

It’s a good feeling to be able
to touch somebody. It’s part
of what we're about - feeling
and loving and caring.

Thoughts From

Francis Howerton

We are trapped and weak
being consumed and set apart
from all other realities. One
may detect a sort of elated
atmosphere among us, but let
not your conceptions be
misdirected, my people: we
are restless and non-content
and merely exercising attri-
butes of our womanhood.

For we are the Queen
Mothers of this world, the
womb from which all civiliza-
tion emerged, and engulfed by
an ignorance so monstrous as
this system that the very
nature in which we were
created is denied us.

Some of us here now are

thoroughly pacified with the
systematic programming
methods of madness that this

instituted. Yet, many are
rebellious in their humility
and will not allow themselves

prophesized demons who
have altered our course with
mixtures of concrete and steel
and such a terrible shade of
gray.
