are paid and the rest, along with  
supporters in our local community,  
provide Quest with almost a third  
of its funds. We have no grants, no  
and no university  
We depend  
the feminist  

Quest's survival depends in part  
on maintaining our Second Class  
mailing privileges. Without this  
permit, the cost of subscriptions  
would be too high. To keep it we  
have to mail out four issues a year,  
but our move last year got us be-  
hind schedule so that we have to  
produce and mail three more issues  
by Oct. 31, 1978. The production  
costs to do that total over $20,000.  
We are working to raise that money  
through fundraisers and direct mail  
campaigns, but we cannot raise the  
money and publish three issues with-  
out help.  

Many people have advised us to  
raise our subscription prices but  
we want to avoid that if possible.  
So institutions will now pay $25.00  
per year for Quest but you'll still  
pay only $3.00.  

Editorial from pg.4  

We need you to help us through  
this difficult period. Can you send  
a donation, renew early, or become  
a sustaining subscriber? Could you  
hold a fundraiser in your area,  
sponsor a Quest discussion group,  
or visit bookstores and libraries  
to ask them to carry Quest? If you  
do any of these, you help us put out  
our next three issues and keep our  
Second Class mailing privileges.  

We've been publishing Quest for  
almost five years and we want to go  
on for at least five more. With  
your help we will. If each sub-  
scriber sent us $5.00 we would have  
$10,000, half-way to our goal!  

If you cannot spare any money to  
help us, perhaps you can send us  
the names of people you know who  
might like to subscribe to Quest or  
buy a sample copy. We'll be happy  
to send them our brochure and we'll  
appreciate your support.  

Help us keep Quest in the mail!

‘In Conclusion  

June Arnold, Barke Bowman, Charlotte Bunch and Bertha Harris did not con-  

duct the interview with the New York Times well. We need more discussion on  
how to effectively use the straight press. Our processes in dealing with the  
establishment media and learning from each effort with them must be a forward  

progress. Feminists must continue to try to use the establishment media and  

we must all learn from and share criticism. We must be willing to learn from  

each other's experiences.  

Marina Franchild's style of criticism was irresponsible. And our process in  
printing her criticism was irresponsible. However, Franchild brought up many  
issues which we of the feminist community and presses must deal with.  

BMR will continue to provide a forum for further discussion of all issues.  
We do not view the Franchild article or this editorial as an end. We encour-  

age women to send us their ideas, strategies and criticism for publication in  

BMR's struggle column,

Dear Sisters,  

The 5th Annual Colorado Women's  
Festival will be held Saturday, Sept.  
9th. No other decisions have been  
made regarding the festival. Present-  
ly some women from Diana's Grove and  
Virago as well as other interested  
women are involved in the planning.  
Meetings are being held every Tues-  

day at Woman to Woman, 2023 E. Colfax  
at 7:30 pm. Meetings are open to par-  
ticipation by all interested women.  
Files from previous years’ festivals  
are available for planning assistance.  
An agenda is prepared in advance, but  
is open to additions at the beginning of the meeting. At  
any given meeting the decision-making  
body is composed of the women at  
that meeting. We are working as a  
collective and all decisions are made  
by consensus. Current subjects under  
consideration are:  

1. location  

2. beginning publicity campaign  

3. contacting local performers  

4. general festival layout  

If you are interested in having a  
booth or performing or participating  
in other ways please contact Virago

“I Wanted Help”  
from pg.10  

"When you leave the institution,  
they give you maybe $35 worth of  
clothing and $100 to walk on, and  
$100, you know, is not gonna get you  
an apartment and it's not going to  
get you enough groceries to last un-  
til you can get a job. Halfway houses  
are trying to help but it's another  

pressure that a person has to take  

because it's half freedom and half  
lock-up."  

“We need people to set up a few  
jobs for people who are already get-  
ting out; or furloughs so that they  
can try to find something to do when  
they get out, so they can support  
their families. That's what I mean by  
help because that's what I needed.  

"A lot of people are not there just  
for doing the crime for nothing, for  
drugs. They're there because they  
wanted to survive."  

“Correctional industries, which has  
just come into the institution itself,  
Maximum Security and CWCI, is arrang-  
ing positions for some but they can  
only do so much because they only  
have that much manpower."  

Furloughs  

"Once you've been at the institu-  
tion and you've maintained a grade  
point average of 2.7 or above, plus  
if you have an indeterminate sentence,  

Baba Yaga  
from pg. 16  

But the most important element in  
Baba Yaga's dynamics is their indivi-  
dual commitment to music. Each woman  
is essentially a musician and while  
her involvement with the band may  
seem all-consuming at times, she is  
primarily committed to learning more  
about music, to expanding her own  
perceptions and skills. This makes  
the collective special-- while func-  
tioning within a group the women are  
all rewarded in their own way. As  
Patti summed it up: "Somehow, we all  
get what we want."  

Baba Yaga's record is entitled On  
the Edge. I could go into the meanings  
of that title as it is related to  
jazz, or to the collective process;  
but I have a different sense of those  
words. Each woman who is exploring her  
own potential to fulfill herself as  
an individual is on the edge of self-  
discovery. And I am convinced that  
the edge is defined not by collectives  
or movements alone, but by a primary  
commitment to one's own interests.  
And for Baba Yaga, that interest, and  
that energy, is unmistakably music.

and if and if and if, and if you can  
find a sponsor, a friend or a relat-  
ive or what-have-you, the institution  
has the probation department in what-  
ever town you want to furlough to,  
check out your sponsor, make sure  
their background's clean. Then the  
institution allows you fifty hours  
per month furlough, which is just  
leaving the institution for fifty  
hours unsupervised, in the custody of  
your sponsor."  

The Daily Routine  

“Under correctional industries  
we're set up to where everyone works  
an eight-hour day, and those who come  
into the institution without a high  
school diploma attend the G.E.D.  

classes four hours a day and a work  

detail the other four. We always have  
breakfast at 6:45, lunch at 11:30,  
supper at 4:30.  

On Tuesdays, we have a physician's  
assistant come in, who prescribes  
medication for those who need it. On  
Wednesday a dentist comes in who does  
any dental work. Then on Thursdays we  
have a regular M.D. come in who sees  
only persons the nurse deems neces-  
sary and she's not even an R.N. We  
have an L.P.N. strictly on 24 hours.”  

"Basically all your extra-curricular  
programs are after 4 p.m. Then af-  
ter supper, say 5:30, 6 p.m., they  
open the recreation room which has  
pool tables, a portable basketball  
net, a roll-about volleyball net,  
and a hula-hoop. But you just have so  
little time allotted to just recrea-  
tion, per se.”  

“You have to wait till they open it  
(the rec. room). You can't just go  
down when you want to go down."  

"You're graded on everything from  
personal hygiene to whether you at-  
tend mandatory meals on time to whe-  
ther you attend your work detail on  
time, how you get along with your  
boss, if you use your spare hours  
wisely, just everything. And if you  
fall below a 2.7 average, you're not  
eligible to move from one wing to the  
next until you bring your grades up."  

Custody Case  
from pg. 7  

to hear, yet I was also afraid to  
hear it. He did say that he was so  
impressed with the children that he  
and his court reporter had argued  
over which one of them would take  
them. Finally, he said it. In the  
best interest of the children he  

ruled that they should remain with  

their mother. I just sat there  
frozen. I wanted to ask my lawyer  
if he really said it. When we got  
home and told the kids they were  
ecstatic and yelled all over the  
neighborhood,  

So, here we are -- a two-year bat-  
tle ended. The stresses do take  
their toll, of course. I still don't  
know how to live without that con-  
stant fear that was always there. We  
are trying to tie up the loose ends  
now and begin living again.  

The most important lesson in this,  
I believe, is that my ex-husband's  
"group" took on an elitist position.  
They demonstrated racial bigotry, re-  
ligious prejudice, and were going to  
take the children away from this  
trash. That attitude is what we are  
all fighting. That attitude prevents  
us from being -- whether it is be-  
cause of our color, creed, sex, or  
affectional preference. That is why  
we must stand together whatever our  
own differences may be.  

How can we demand that we be ac-  
cepted as persons in a heterosexual  
environment if we refuse to recog-  
nize and accept our own differences  
among ourselves?
