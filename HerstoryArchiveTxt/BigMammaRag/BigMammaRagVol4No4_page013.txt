Boycotts: How Women Can Utilize Their Collective Power  

Deborah Taylor.  
As part of our socialization  
process, we women are trained  
to be consumers; we are res-  
ponsible for buying goods to  
keep the family going, for finding  
the lowest possible prices and  
“best buys.” Women are the  
passive agents of consumption  
while men are the producers.  

Advertising takes advantage  
of the despair and helplessness  
in our daily lives by channeling  
our frustration into buying  
things we don’t need. A new  
book or dress or skis gives us the  
illusion of a new identity: “we  
are what we own.” We often go  
shopping to avoid going home to  
“our empty apartments and lives.”  

The products we have to  
choose from in the market are  
not designed to meet our real  
human needs, but to make a  
profit and serve as a substitute  
for the fulfillment of these  
needs.  

We all know of the enormous  
profits business makes from  
shabby, unhealthy goods for  
sale. It is revealing in this society  
that the pleasure of eating an ice  
cream cone is readily available  
to women whereas meaningful  
work is not. Good jobs, nice  
apartments and cooperative re-  
lationships are hard to come by,  
and so we have to make do. For  
example, a poor family would  
undoubtedly rather have a de-  
cent apartment than a new TV,  
but since there are no apart-  
ments available, what is to be  
gained by not getting the TV?  

Political Shopping  

Despite these limitations,  
shopping does have the poten-  
tial to become a political and  
positive act. We can buy selec-  
tively according to principle  
rather than whim. We can buy  
things that meet our needs  
rather than the manufacturers’;  
money is power and we can use  
it consciously and deliberately to  
take advantage of all the op-  
tions open to us.  

For example, instead of shop-  
ping in supermarkets and sup-  
porting the development of pro-  
fits and poisons by the big food  
industries, we can shop in food  
co-ops, buying clubs and health  
food stores. There are food co-  
ops in most large cities; in  
Boston 20,000 people shop in  
neighborhood buying clubs and  
food co-ops where the food is  
fresher and cheaper. (In Denver  
check out the Common Market.)  

When we patronize health  
food stores we invest our money  
in healthy foods and ourselves,  
rather than in poisons and  
processing. Aside from food, we  
can also take advantage of all the  
feminist businesses, banks and  
services and the women and  
companies who advertise in Big  
Mama and other radical publica-  

Another way we can use our  
buying power is to support boy-  
cotts that are being carried on  
nationally against particular pro-  
ducts and companies. Boycotts  
are particularly effective in  
changing company policy be-  
cause they put pressure where it  
hurts in this money economy.  
Boycotts give us a means of  
challenging the exploitation of  
workers by big bosses.  

It Works  
The boycott of Farah pants  
was successful when the  
Chicana workers won many of  
their demands after 22 months  
on strike. The United Farm  
Workers have organized an ex-  
tremely effective boycott since  
1968 against table grapes, head  
lettuce and Gallo wine.  

A recent Harris poll showed  
that millions of people are now  
supporting the boycott: 17  
million no longer buy head let-  
tuce, 14 million will not buy table  
grapes and 11 million have  
stopped buying Gallo wine. In  
1975 table grape sales dropped  
33%; 100 liquor stores in the  
Denver-Boulder area no longer  
stock Gallo wines, and this is  
true for many other parts of the  
country as well.  

Now, after years of struggle,  
the farmworkers have gained  
the right to join a union: the Agri-  
culture Labor Relations Act has  
been in effect in California for  
the past 8 months. This bill gives  
workers the right to collective  
bargaining and to allocate  
money to settle legal hassles  
and set up the machinery for  
union voting.  

In February this year, how-  

ever, the money budgeted for  
this bill ran out and the big  
growers in the legislature are re-  
fusing to allocate more because  
the U.F.W. has been winning 3  
to 1 against the Teamsters in  
union elections. In response, the  
U.F.W. has initiated a boycott  
against Sunmaid Raisins and  
Sunsweet Prunes and Dried  
Fruit, because this company is  
one of the major opponents to  
the bill.  

Since only 10% of all head let-  
tuce is union picked, there is a  
boycott on head lettuce. The only  
store in Denver that carries  
union lettuce is the Atalante  
Market at 7th and Santa Fe.

implantation on the wall of the  
uterus. Yet the idea of abortion  
still remains “nationally un-  
acceptable.  

The speaker stressed that  
abortions are not damaging in  
themselves, but that most abor-  
tions available to women are bad  
abortions. The slow and clumsy  
approach to dealing with un-  
wanted pregnancies also tends  
to cause women guilt.  

Ms. Greer advocated leaving  
women’s health untampered  
with, “rather than be medicated  
all the time, or walk around with  
bits of copper, loops, etc. inside of  
our bodies.” She suggested that  
women discover our “own  
sexuality and fertility without  
contraceptives, and focus in-

Boycotts  

Current boycotts include:  

1. Coors Beer. Coors is the fourth  
biggest beer producer in the  
country. The reasons for the boy-  

cott are (a) their discrimination  
in hiring, especially against  
minority women; (b) the use of  
polygraph tests in hiring to ex-  
clude homosexuals, activists  
and people who have used  
drugs; (c) the Coors Company's  
financial support of weather  
modification programs in Cali-  
fornia to increase grain yield,  
which at the same time have  
destroyed small farmers’ vege-  
table crops, and (d) Joseph  
Coors’ support of the John Birch  
Society and other reactionary  
groups.  

2. Kraft Cheese. Kraft has been  
cutting out small farmers in  
Canada in a ruthless manner  
over the past year.  

3. Head Ski. Head now has scab  
laborers and the strike is over,  
but the boycott continues be-  
cause of their discriminatory  
hiring practices, unhealthy  
working conditions and anti-  
union practices of withdrawing  
benefits and intimidating union  
organizers. This boycott has  
been successful: of 40 stores in  
the Boulder-Denver area, all but  
one have removed Head Skis  
from their stock.  

4. Russell Stover Candies. The  
Bakery and Confectionery  
workers have just started strik-  
ing, and need our support.  

5. Safeway Stores. Safeway is  
the biggest food chain in the  
country, a huge multi-national  
whose Board of Directors is  
made up of Rockefellers and big  
California growers. They have  
been the most unwavering  
against the farmworkers and are

weather, or suffering wetness to  
the knees if she did, what she ate  
— boiled mutton when she could  
afford it, potatoes when she  
could not, who she read — Rous-  
seau, Cowper, Sterne, Richard-  
son. As the biographer of a small  
part of an age, Detre also gives  
us a window through which to  
view some of the greatest minds  
of the turn of the century, and to  
witness the effect of one of the  
most important events in all of  
human history, the French  
Revolution.  
The effect of the French  

Revolution upon the reader is  
dramatic. Dramatic, too, is the  
focus on the last year of Woll-  
stonecraft's life. The reader  
knows that Wollstonecraft will  
die; she herself does not sus-  
pect it. The journal ends with a  

letter to Godwin on August 30,  

the day that the daughter  
who was to become Mary  
Shelley, author of Franken-  
stein, was born. Wollstonecraft  
tells him that she has sent for  
the midwife, who assures her  
that she will have a safe delivery  

after an operation to remove the  
recalcitrant afterbirth.  

The tragedy does not end  
there; Wollstonecraft's older  
daughter, Fanny, was a bouncy,  
high-spirited child, beloved by  
her mother. One of Wollstone-  
craft's most fervent hopes was  
that her daughter would grow up  
free and untrammeled, un-  
afraid of her own body and  
intelligence.  

Fanny was three when her  
mother died, and without her,  
she grew up to be a very differ-  
ent sort of girl than the happy  
child Wollstonecraft describes in  
her journal. Eleanor Flexner des-  
cribes her as “dutifully anxious to  
please and serve, deeply intro-  
spective, and sad.” She commits  
suicide at the age of 19.  

In the end, any stuffiness  
about factual inaccuracies is  
eclipsed by the vivid authentic-  
ity of Detre’s prose. Rivalling  
Wollstonecraft herself, it is con-  
sistently precise, evocative, im-  
passioned. It is through her  
prose that Detre has recreated  
the personality of Wollstone-  

Wollstonecraft died 10 days  
later of an infection which set in.
