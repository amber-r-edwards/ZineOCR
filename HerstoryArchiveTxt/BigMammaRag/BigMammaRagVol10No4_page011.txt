This is the autobiography
of a woman who was an obedient
wife and mother in the

book review

Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter Day Saints (Mormon)
until she was introduced to
feminism. Such a Pilgrim's
Progress story is especially
pertinent to all women and
the women's movement precisely
because Sonia Johnson faithfully
tried for over 40 years to
follow patriarchal
authoritarianism with all

her “heart, soul, mind, and
strength." When this type

of woman breaks from the patriarchal
mold, she does so with a deep
experience of all the issues
involved. She knows firsthand
what ramifications are present
in the system.

Developing her story by
means of anecdotes which portray
family, church, and community
attitudes, Sonia relates common
religious patterns plus some
specifically Mormon ones (e.g.,
testimony meetings involving
witnessing concerning paranormal
occurrences). She speaks indirectly
of some important changes
which could occur if women
were allowed to take part in
temple ceremonies (temple
rites are secret and men perform
all the blessings and
priesthood functions). Sonia
also describes her own healing
from arthritis by means of a
faith healing process of the
laying on of hands.

Sonia's field and emphasis
is politics and social activism
rather than theology, yet
her account of the Mother God
is powerful and important.
Students of theology might be
interested to know that the
Mother God in Mormon doctrine
is not a feminized Holy Spirit.
The Mormon Trinity is not
"3 in 1", but 3 separate
personages: Father, Son, and male
Holy Spirit...But the Mother
God is the wife of Father God.

Mormon missionaries advised
me, in 1966 (before the women's
movement hit Mormon country),
that God's wife is not
mentioned publicly nor prayed
to, so that Mormonism would
not seem too foreign to potential
converts. Sonia states that
she was advised that both
non-mention and non-prayer
are to "protect" Mother God.
Whatever the reason, Sonia is
surely correct in stating that
the psychological reason is to
keep women from feeling that
they have an ally in Heaven.
Sonia's account of church
politics and covert political

maneuvering is crucially important
for several reasons:
1) Women, especially, and
many men, too, are naive
and unknowledgeable about
church politics, the flagrant
abuses of separation of church
and state and the wealth and power
of all large church bodies.
Women generally have a
mindset that churches
are "spiritual" institutions,
and by using compartmentalized
thinking, often rationalize that
their favorite priests,
preachers, and denominational
leaders simply would not stoop
to use political and secular
tactics. This mode of
thinking greatly jeopardizes
clear insight into
abuses of church powers.
Sonia's refusal to be hoodwinked
and cowed by her bishop
and her heresy trial is a
superb act of courage and a
model for all women to follow.
Such courage provides necessary

2)

checks and balances to
patriarchal and authoritarian
power.

The book concentrates on
the Mormon church's political
lobbying against the ERA.
Fascinating details are given,
together with the comical
well-known story of the counter-activity
of flying banners. As additional
proofs of Sonia's charges about
anti-ERA lobbying: in 1976
I was present at a Relief Society
meeting (a Mormon Ladies
Aide Society) in Boulder,
Colorado. The president of

the group, a young mother of

2 or 3 children, advised:
"The ERA principle sounds so
reasonable. I'd like to vote
for it if only our bishop
hadn't told us to vote against it." 
In Safford, Arizona,
previously, at both Relief
Society and Sunday School
types of meetings I heard
people being advised to vote
against passage of the ERA.

Sonia keeps the lives of
her children very private.
The story of her marriage is
more open and centers around
feminist concerns of equality
and support. All women who
have had the heart-wrenching
experience of lost love will
be affected by Sonia's account
of her divorce. Her desperate
and illogical belief
and trust in the face of her
husband's obvious perfidy are
too typical of most women.
Yet, Sonia is fair and speaks
of his support of her consciousness
raising and her own
educational pursuits (Sonia
has a master's degree and an
Ed.D. degree).

The above support is the

only place the book falls
short of being a model and
guide for many other women
who need support and encouragement
to become or remain feminists. The majority of
struggling women, I fear,
have not had the relative
financial security when her
children were small, nor the
advantages of 2 advanced degrees,
travel, and a loving
and supportive mother and actively
caring and involved friends
in the ERA movement.
Most of the Mormon or Fundamentalist
women I knew in the
Mormon and Fundamentalist
communities in which I lived
were either the Phyllis Schlafly
type with money and of
course did not want the ERA
or else they wanted equality
but had 4 to 6 children, no
money, no emotional support,
and a chauvinist husband.
Thank Goddess that Sonia had
a modest amount of money,
education, and emotional support
so that she had the means
and courage to fight the
entire Mormon church and come
out a heroine! Yet, may the
day come when women without
money or decent husbands or
emotional support may be able
to fight courageously for
their rights.

Religion, Dorothy Riddles’,
Politics, Spirituality and
Models of Change, which again
argues for a nonviolent "consensus"
revolution.

People who want a “how-to”
book for developing spiritual
strength and skills, or
to find specific rituals &
meditations, will have to
plow through a lot of theory to
find the fragments in this
book. Look elsewhere--Starhawk's
The Spiral Path, is
good.

But people who want an
intellectual understanding
of the roots and politics of
"women's spirituality"--its
strengths, weaknesses, contradictions--and what these
women mean by "fighting patriarchy"--will find this
collection very useful.
