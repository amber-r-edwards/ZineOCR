be corporate exploiters. To
force us into these molds, more
and more violence is being
brought to bear: anti-lesbian
and anti-gay legislation and
propaganda, the anti-abortion
movement, legislation pro-
tecting the sacred right to
wife-battering and child-beat-
ing. A woman in America is
raped every eleven seconds,

and one out of four of our dau-
ghters is raped, molested, or
attacked through incest before
she turns 18! Rising male su-
premacy is NOT a separate pro-
blem, but an integral part of
America's build-up for war.
Reagan's "Advisor for Women's
Affairs” sums it up very well
when she says: "Women are so
good at giving and serving, and
this is what America needs."

We say that what the American
system needs is to be over-
thrown! The only way to win
peace is to fight the material
causes for war, and to defeat
a system that lives on vio-
lence. The U.S. war machine
does not exist because of a
bad administration, a mistaken
foreign policy, or patria-
chal attitudes in the minds of
men. A vampire must have blood
to live, and vampire America
lives on chrome and gold from
Africa, on bananas, and coffee

from Central America, on oil
from Mexico and the Middle
East. Vampire America lives
on the stolen land and labor
of hundreds of millions of
colonized Third World people,
not just far away across the
oceans, but right here in the
U.S.A. Domestic Colonialism is
the reason that the infant
mortality rate in the Black
community of Detroit is as
high as the infant mortality
rate in Honduras, the poorest
country in Central America.
Our relatively high standard
of living is built on all of
this, on a white supremacist
system of jobs, education,
housing, prisons, etc. A sys-
tem like this can never re-
form itself or convert its
priorities to "jobs, not war."
The U.S. resorts to counter-
insurgency war wherever its
power is threatened by people
fighting for freedom. To op-
pose the U.S. war machine, we
have to target the whole sy-
stem of U.S. imperialism.
Everywhere around the world
it has been revolutionary
struggle--protracted liber-
ation wars--that have deliv-
ered the most serious blows
to U.S. domination. This is

why we support those who make
war on the warmakers,

from

the FMLN in El Salvador to the
PLO in Palestine. Equally do
we support colonized Third
World nations in the U.S. who
are fighting for independence
and socialism here in the
belly of the beast. We support
freedom fighters not because
we like violence, but because
we hate violence and want to
be very honest with ourselves
about how it will end.

As women, we take our ex-
ample from the revolutionary

women of the oppressed nations,
who are transforming their
societies and themselves
through their full participa-
tion in their nations’ strug-
gles. In all liberation struggles that
women are most dramatically
changing their lives and win-
ning real power. To give just
one example: in Nicaragua,
just four years after the re-
volution, virtually all of the
children are immunized and the
exploitation of women's bodies
in advertising has been out-
lawed. There are no utopias,
but there are examples of what
can be won through revolution-
ary struggle and sacrifice.
We have a vision of what is
possible, and we want this
vision to come true for our
children and for all children.

It is within the nation-

women's demonstrations
working on guerrilla theatre;

We want independence for op-
pressed nations inside and
outside the U.S., we want an
end to the white supremacy.
We want socialism and women's
liberation, and an end to the
oppression of lesbians. We

won't try to create quiet is-

lands for ourselves within the
system because to do this means:
accommodating ourselves to an
order that destroys everything
human. We have a sense of ur-
gency about our work because
the U.S. is rapidly heading
towards fascism and war. We
intend to take our experience
as women, and turn it around,
struggling together with the
oppressed people of the world
to defeat this imperialist
power. JOIN US!

GET INVOLVED!

Women Against Imperialism
is planning a series of
posters, stickers, and other
art work; and on a film series
about women in revolutionary
struggles. The whole campaign

will lead up to International
Women's Day, 1984, to be co-

ordinated with women around
the U.S. and Europe. Please
give us a call to talk about

how you can get involved!
