and occupied it. The only ba-
sis for peace in the Middle
East is the PLO's goal of a
secular Palestinian state
"where Jews and Arabs can
live in peace." It is the he-
ight of white supremacy to
use the Holocaust to claim
Palestine for the Jews. Who
bears the responsibility for
genocide against Jewish peo-
ple is not the Arab people of
Palestine, but European fas-
cism and imperialism. And it
is only in the revolutionary
struggle against fascism and
US-led imperialism that anti-
semitism and all other forms
of oppression will be des-
troyed forever.

As Palestinian revolution-
aries have long made clear,
these goals can only be ac-
complished through people's
war. In the face of a con-
stant barrage of imperialist
and Zionist propaganda por-
traying the Palestinians as
a nation of terrorists, it is
time we stood up and expres-
sed our support for this
fight.

house once or twice that week
while we were "sitting shiva"
(mourning). My dad was going
around gathering all the men
to go into the living room to
say prayers with the rabbi.

It is essential that there

are ten bar mitzvahed men gat-
hered before praying begins.
In fact in synagogue the holy
ark cannot be opened until ten
men are gathered. It's called a
"minion." So my Dad brought
me into the living room with
all the men, stuck a yarmulke
on my head and a prayer book
in my hand, (although I don't
read Hebrew.) He wanted me to
be included in these prayers
for my mother. It touched me
very much that he wanted to
include me, but I left the
room anyhow. I wasn't into it
at all. I felt my Mother had
returned to the Goddess, and I
spoke to her in my heart. I
wanted to go to Hebrew school
when I was younger, but my
family couldn't afford to send
me. There was never any ques-
tion that my two brothers
would go to Hebrew school, be-
cause a boy had to be bar
mitzvahed.

A few years back I started
going to meetings of Jewish
lesbians. A lot of the women
were from families that were-

women's oppression,

We as women do not confront
some separate structure of
oppression, but the same im-
perialist system whose bed-
rock is the oppression of co-
lonized nations inside the
US and around the world. If
we want to participate in
fundamentally changing this
system, to be part of build-
ing a society where genocide,
anti-semitism and class exploitation
can no longer exist, then we
need to actively side with
Palestinian, Black, Chicano-
Mexicano, Puerto Rican, Na-
tive American and all nation-
al liberation struggles which
are leading the fight to take
this empire apart.

n't very absorbed in Jewish
culture and they were very
excited about discovering
their Jewish identity. I main-
ly joined because I knew so
few Jewish women and I wanted
to meet more. We had dinner

on Friday night, but since I
don't eat meat or sugar, there
wasn't much for me to eat.
(I'm used to that.) Before the
meal we were supposed to all
sing the Sh'ma together. Of
course, I didn't. When I ex-
plained why I didn't sing the
Sh'ma, a lot of the women
thought I was really awful. So
I stopped going to the meet-
ings. Then the next year I
tried another meeting of Jew-
ish lesbians, but again they
wanted to start off by singing
the Sh'ma. Again, I explained
my feelings about giving pow-
er to a patriarchal, anti-
pagan meditation, and again I
got criticized. So I stopped
going.

When I was a kid, my parents
taught me that above all else,
I was a Jew. There will always
be a strong sense in me that
the Jewish people are my peo-
ple. I used to fantasize that
my family died fighting back
in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising
and not in the death camps of
Treblinka, which was close to

they don't personally oppress
blacks. While our kids are
getting beat up, can't get
jobs, can't get health care,
can't get self-respect, can't
get nothing. They won't see
what's going on in their own
backyard. They don't want to
see because it might make
them feel less safe in their
own comfortable cocoons." 
Donna Awatere, another
black woman, wrote, "The re-
lationship between black and
white political groups will
in the long run depend on
how well whites can identify
and work against injustice to
black people. Very few will.
Yet racism is a global pheno-
menon, not particular to one
country and it must be fought
globally, wherever it is.
And it is here... But anti-
racism isn't fashionable like

feminism, or full of intrigue
like anti-capitalism, al-
though it includes both
feminism and the class strug-
gle. Emotionally, fighting
overseas racism must be
easier to cope with for
whites: attending meetings;
writing letters;...the occas-
ional visit or tour.. Domes-
tic racism is every day.
Every day in the streets. Ev-
ery day in the classroom, the
courtroom, the factory,
plunket rooms, welfare homes.”

"Feminism without a class
analysis or an anti-racist
commitment has gone long
enough and we're all getting
a little weary of the self-
indulgent sort of nonsense
that's been passing for the
women's movement for the past
ten years."

our village. I would like to
be able to talk with other
Jewish women about my exper-
iences of the sexism in the
Jewish religion and why I id-
entify as a witch, without
being criticized and treated
as though I've ceased to be
Jewish. In Europe before the
War, not only were women not
allowed to "doven" (pray)
with the men, but the women
had to bathe in ritual clean-
sing baths during their men-
strual periods, for their
blood was considered un-
clean. In my synagogue boys
and men wore special holy
scarves, called "tallit" and
special skull caps, called
“yarmulkes," because males
had a holier, more important
position than females. I don't
feel that silencing my exper-
ience of this is the sensitive

way to deal with anti-semi-
tism.

I was so absorbed in my
religion when I was younger.
Also, except for two friends
in sixth grade, the only Gen-
tile people I had contact with
were teachers and a few ac-
quaintances in school. All my
parents' friends were Jewish.
In fact, until I was eighteen
and went away to college, I
didn't have one non-Jewish
friend.

I am really concerned that
my anger against the religious
messages of Judaism not be
taken as an attack. I think
it's important for me to look
at what I love and what I
can't stand in my Jewish
background. What I have tried
to do is to express openly
the many feelings I have in
my heart.
