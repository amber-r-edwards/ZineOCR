Psychiatry And The Criminal Injustice System: "How

(The following statement
by Sally originally appeared
in Vol. 4, #5-1978 of Mad
ness Network News. Since then
she has been fighting to put
Rosen out of business. The
boxed update on page 15 is
edited from the current is-
sue of Madness - Summer 1983.)

Sally Zinman

I was placed in the custody
of Dr. John N. Rosen in Jan-
uary of 1971 and remained his
patient until February 1973.

I was 34 years of age and

the doctor to return to the
treatment unit that evening.

When Rosen arrived, with no
warning he tore off all my
clothes except my underpants,
threw me on the bed, and with
an aide holding me, he beat
me with his fists on the face
and breasts.

I was left with a black eye
and bruises. (I was kept in-
side the house for several
days until these bruises
cleared up.) After the beat-
ing, I was placed on a bed in
only my underpants (no cover),

psychiatric atrocities

there was never at any time
a legal commitment, nor was I
ever adjudicated incompetent.

I went first into Rosen's
custody by subterfuge and in-
timidation. First, there was
a preliminary interview with
a psychiatrist, an associate
of Rosen's, named Dr. Harvey
Corman who came to my apart-
ment. (1) The interview was
unannounced. (2) The "Doctor"
was introduced as a friend of
my father's and the chat was
miscellaneous small talk. (3)
It was not presented as an in-
terview that was to determine
my future.

Two aides of Rosen's, one a
large male and one, a female,
my mother, father, and sister
arrived unannounced at my a-
partment in New York City one
day after the "Doctor's" vis-
it. They helped me pack, tell-
ing me I was going to Florida
with them (where my parents
have a home) to see a psych-
iatrist friend of theirs. I
thought I was going to live
at my parents' house and see
a doctor as an outpatient.

I was flown on a private
plane, with Rosen's two aides
standing guard, to Boca Raton
(accompanied by my mother),
where I was placed in one of
Rosen's treatment residences
at 340 N.E. Spanish Trail in
Boca Raton, Florida.

The first month passed un-
eventfully except that I was
attacked by Rosen and an aide,
thrown to the floor and held
tightly on the floor for sev-
eral minutes, all without an
explanation or any forewarn-
ing.

The "therapy sessions" with
Rosen were useless. One morn-
ing I asked to be an outpa-
tient; Rosen agreed. But when
I was ready to leave, the
aides asked me to wait for

and tied hand and foot. I was
only untied to go to the bath-
room. Both male and female
aides kept watch over me for
the next 24 hours, watched me
even in the bathroom. I was
given no food or water for
the 24-hour period.

After this 24-hour period,
the man who had held me down
burst into my room at least
once and searched it, dumping
the contents of the drawers -
my clothes, personal posses-
sions - on the floor, where
he left them.

I then began to try to es-
cape Rosen's custody. I es-
caped from this treatment fac-
ility in Boca Raton, once the
guard on me was relaxed, call-
ed my parents and told them
about the beating, begging
them not to put me back into
Rosen's custody.

Because I wanted a physical
examination, my parents made
arrangements for me to fly to
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
where I was to have a physical
examination by a family phys-
ician.

When I got off the plane,
Rosen's aides greeted me,
pushed me, screaming, into a
waiting car, with my father
attending, and drove me -
screaming all the way - to
Rosen's Bucks County treat-
ment facility.

After a week in one of the
residential treatment units
there, I again escaped. (This
time I did not call my par-
ents!) I was found by two of
Rosen's aides and a person
identified by them as a de-
tective. The Philadelphia
Police aided this recapture
by bringing me to the police
station in a paddy wagon. At
the station, I was given over
to Rosen and his aides.

Because of the police inter-

vention on Rosen's behalf, I
felt from then on that I must
have been "committed" without
my knowledge. When we arrived
at Twin Silos Farm, I was put
into a cellar security room
where I was to live for the
next two months. Rosen person-
ally threw me across the room
and locked the door, barring
it on the outside with a two-
by-four.

The room was built inside
the basement, about 10 feet
from the furnace. It had no
windows, but there was a small
grilled opening, perhaps 12"x
12" high on the wall which
looked out onto the outer
basement. The room was about
8'x10' with a small alcove

like a closet with no door.

My furniture was a mattress on
the floor and a bucket in the
closet for a toilet.

The urine was emptied only
at mealtimes (my food was
brought to me by two aides
who then watched me eat). The
fecal matter was emptied im-
mediately, when I knocked -
if someone was upstairs to
hear the knock. Sometimes,
however, on weekends, no one
was in the house and the fecal
matter stayed in the small,
closed room for an afternoon.

Periodic, unannounced
searches of the room and of
my person were conducted
throughout the two months.

There was no outside exit
from the cellar; the only
exit was at the top of the
stairs on the first floor. No
windows in the outer cellar
were ever opened and the door
leading from the cellar to
the first floor was also
closed.

On occasion, the house gar-
bage was stored for the week
in this cellar.

If heat was on upstairs, it
was suffocatingly hot in my
"zoom," and if it was not on,
it was very cold. I was placed
there in mid-March. I had no
clothes except a bra and pan-
tyhose, so to keep warm when
the heat was off - which was
most of the time - I kept a
blanket wrapped around me.

I was taken upstairs for 45
minutes each morning to shower
and use the bathroom, watched
closely by two aides (1 male,
1 female) even in the shower
and on the toilet.

During this two-month per-
iod, I was ill twice. Once
with diarrhea and once, more
seriously, near the end of my
imprisonment, I had a high
fever, accompanied by chills,
and was in bed for three days.
I did not see a doctor or
nurse but was given aspirin
after my fever got high.

Toward the end of this
nightmarish imprisonment my
face broke out into a rash
and I was only able to get
"convalescent" foods - soft
cereals and baked potatoes.

Many ‘Patients’ Must Be Abused, How

This was due to the lack of
fresh air, the smell in the
room (a combination of dung
and Lysol disinfectant spray)
and the lack of exercise, as
well as the demeaning effect
of my imprisonment.
When Rosen came back to

Twin Silos Farm, this last
week, he would come down to
the room, slap me often, and
verbally abuse me on his
daily visits.

I was finally released from
the locked room in May of
1971 by Rosen.

Incidentally, when my per-
sonal possessions were re-
turned to me, I was not given
some $300 that was taken from
me at the time I was kidnap-
ped by Rosen's aides, and,
with the help of the police,
returned to Twin Silos Farm.

After the security room
incident, I was so completely
intimidated and frightened of
Rosen's reactions, as not to
try to escape his custody,
even as an out-patient.

Even then, I was afraid to
tell my story to anyone of
official capacity or connected
with the "establishment" for
fear of being returned to
Rosen's custody and so pun-
ished again, or worse. In
fact, for two or more years
after this experience in the
security room, I could not
talk about it, even to close
friends.

When I finally did leave
Rosen's custody, although he
gave me his permission and
encouragement to do so, he
was, at the same time, sur-
reptitiously trying to con-
vince my parents to legally
commit me to his custody. He
said I was self-destructive,
was unable to take care of
myself, and sexually "acting
out" in a dangerous way, and
that I had contracted VD.
These statements were all
lies.

The Crime----

I “woke up" with amnesia
in October, 1970, the morn-
ing after (maybe) attending
a rock concert in New York
City. I was 33 years old. I
didn't remember the night
before at all. I felt com-
pletely disassociated from
the past. Although I remem-
bered the past, I somehow did
not believe it was my past.
At the beginning of the per-
iod, I thought I had lost 2
years of my life somewhere.

Soon after I was sure my
whole life was a lie. The
present was, and continued
to be, intact. I was never
out of contact with present
or future reality, everyday
normal objects, situations,
and conversations. My pro-
blem, in other words, was
contained in the area of my
past identity; in all other
areas I was functional. I

knew everything except my
past and my name.
At the hospital the pro-

blem took on an added dimen-
sion. At first I simply did
not know my name, a loss of
identity. Now, the counter-
part, in the hospital and
under constant barrage from
the doctor, I began to search
for an identity; I became
desperate to find a name,
any name, think of someone,
to stop the abuse. (If I
could come up with who I
was I could get out.) So I
began to make guesses (mostly
privately) of who I might be
or what could have happened
to me - though I never could
accept any of these possibil-
ities, names, professions,
accidents, diseases, in short
pasts.

I was told my ticket to get
out of the "security room"
was to say my name was Sally
Zinman; after two months in
the room, I said my name was
Sally Zinman; I lied to get
out.

I still felt I had amnesia,
and I still felt I didn't
know any name and my parents
weren't my parents. I just
lied to get out. (Incident-
ally, I never played my iden-
tity loss out publicly. I
always used the name Sally
Zinman in public. It was only
with the psychiatrist and my
parents I wished to discuss,
that is, deal with, my loss
of identity.)

I continued for four years
after leaving the doctor not
knowing my past identity,
with amnesia (or a form
thereof), the exact problem
I went to the doctor with.
Now, however, it was worse
because now I had to keep
its existence hidden, like
a broken leg I couldn't go
to the doctor with and had
to move around on, for fear
of being punished, or worse.

The New

Government
Pastime

John Rosen surrendered his
medical license March 29,
1983 in Harrisburg, Pennsyl-
vania. His license was re-
voked forever. Mr. Rosen sur-
rendered his license in a
deal with the Board of Medi-
cal Education and Licensure
of the state of Pennsylvania.
He avoided a lengthy and pub-
lic hearing on multiple
counts of sexual and physical
abuse, 102 violations of the
state Medical Practices Act
involving the abuse of 11
patients, by pleading guilty
to three of the violations
and surrendering his license.

John Rosen was psychiatry's
wonder boy in the late 40's
and 50's. He hailed himself
as the founder of a new cure
for "schizophrenia": "direct
analysis" which involved ver-
bally assaulting the so-
called psychosis. He claimed
he could talk people out of
their alleged psychosis. His
patients included the names
of the rich and famous - 
Sternbury, Rockefeller, Lina-

Jeanne Dimont (in background), Judi Chamberlin, and Sally

Zinman at the 11th Annual Conference For Human Rights and
Against Psychiatric Oppression - Syracuse, NY 1983.

I recounted being fondled by Dr. Rosen, breast and va-
gina. I was fortunate. John Rosen has
since been charged, in a law suit filed in 1981 by Janet
Katkow, with multiple sexual assaults, forcing Ms. Katkow
to submit to sexual acts with him, with other patients of
both sexes, and with friends of his. Other patients and
therapists have also accused John Rosen of forcing them to
submit to sexual acts as part of therapy. All of my charges,
supported by aides of Rosen's, were submitted in a packet
of information to every psychiatric regulatory agency in
Pennsylvania and Florida, where Dr. Rosen practiced. One of
these agencies was the Pennsylvania Board of Medical Educa-
tion and Licensure. The year was 1977.

-Sally Zinman/Madness Network News, 1983.

He wrote books and art-
icles about his method; arti-
cles were written about him
as well as a book of fiction,
The Savage Sleep by Millen
Brand. He trained many others
in his methods, including the
infamous Albert Honig of the
Delaware Valley Mental Health
Foundation.

Mr. Rosen is now 79 years
old. Since 1977 a patient of
his, Claudia Erdman, was
beaten to death by two Rosen
aides (Dec., 1979). Officials
have been aware of Janet Kat-
kow's as well as others’ com-
plaints of sexual abuse since
at least 1980. How many "pa-
tients" must be abused, how
many killed, before a psych-
iatrist loses his/her li-
cense? Justice is indeed im-
perfect. A public hearing of
someone of Rosen's stature
would have been an example
and a warning to all psych-
iatrists. It is a justice
which is too little and too
late.
