Racism In A.R.M.

sleep on his park bench with  
all the lights and noise of  
the rally. Fourteenth Street,  
the pornography district in  
D.C., is in a poor and Black  
neighborhood targeted for  
"clean-up." One Black woman,  
a long-time resident of the  
14th Street area, put it this  
way: She doesn't like the  
drug pushers, the porn shops  
and the prostitutes in her  
neighborhood, either. But,  
she knows that they are all  
that stand between her and  
those forces that want to  
move her out of the city too.  
In New York City, the 42nd  
St. Development Corporation  
actually donated office  

Space to the feminist group,  
Women Against Pornography.  
When a march consisting mostly  
of white women marches  
through the pornography dis-  
trict chanting, "Hey, hey,  
ho, ho, pornography has got  
to go," and “What do we want?  
Safe streets. When do we want  
them? Now," it becomes clear  
how simply this movement is  
co-opted by the forces that  
are working to push Black  
people and poor people out of  
“our nation's capital" or  

any other prime real estate  
area in the inner cities. Al-  
though the march organizers  
in many cities are aware of  
these issues, and have strug-  
gled within their groups to  
take a clear position against  
condominium conversion, real  
estate speculators, and oth-  
er forces of displacement,  
the message of the march re-  
mains unclear and open to  
misinterpretation. The bottom  
line in all liberation strug-  
gles is control over the land.  
In the cities, the forces  
that own the land are so much  
more powerful than us that  
our efforts are easily co-  
opted.  

When feminists are talk-  
ing about issues of violence  
against women such as rape  
and women abuse, our rela-  
tionship to the police must  
be discussed immediately.  
White women and Black women  
have a totally different his-  
torical relationship to the  
police. As white women we  
are trained to see the police  
as our friends and protectors.  
Black women live with the con-  
stant reality of the police  
as an occupying force in  
their communities. While to  
many of us it is obvious that  
the police are no answer to  

male supremacist violence,  
groups like the Law Enforce-  
ment Assistance Association  
have provided funding to  
many rape crisis centers,  
thus co-opting the women's  

movement and pitting femin-  

ists against the struggles  
in Third World communities.  
These are a few examples  
of the racism in the women's  
movement. I discuss them not  
to berate the feminist move-  
ment, but rather because I  
think our movement is at a  
crucial turning point. If  
the movement continues to al-  
ly primarily with the needs  
of white middle-class women,  
it could, at worst, become  
a force of reaction, and at  
best, sink into a slow death  
of irrelevancy, while its  
gains come at the expense of  
the poor and women of color.  
As I stated in the beginning  
of this article, it was no  
coincidence that this con-  
ference did more work on ra-  
cism than on abortion. Nat-  
ional liberation movements,  
increased military spending,  
and our failing economy  
threaten the relative priv-  
ilege and security white  
people experience living in  
the most powerful imperialist  
nation in the world. A ma-  

tional liberation struggles  
in El Salvador, Namibia and  
around the world. We won't  
be co-opted!  

The most significant work  
on abortion was done in work-  
shops where we discussed ways  
women can take care of the  
problems of unwanted preg-  
nancy ourselves when and if  
abortion becomes illegal. A  
workshop was done with a  
woman who worked with the  
Jane Collective, an under-  
ground abortion service that  
started in Chicago in the  
late 60's and folded in 1973  
when some of the women were  

arrested. They were acquitted  

when abortion became legal.  
This workshop was particular-  
ly significant because for  
many years women in the Jane  
Collective have not talked  
openly about their experi-  
ence. Now, with the Hatch  
Amendment proposed in Con-  
gress (another Constitutional  
Amendment restricting abor-  

tion) individual states could  

pass amendments making abor-  
tion illegal if it passed.  
The workshop presented a  
step-by-step picture of the  
process of running an abor-  
tion service. The Jane Coll-  
ective got its name because  
"Jane" was used as the code  

word. If you were seeking an  
abortion, you would call the  
phone number and ask to speak  
to “Jane." An initial health  
history was taken over the  
phone. A counselor was then  
sent to the woman's home. In  
addition to explaining the  
abortion procedure, and how  
to take care of herself  

from page 9  

afterwards, the counselor  
would stress that abortion  
was illegal, and that she  
should talk to no one about  
it. The women were then taken  
to a "front" that served as  

a central transportation  
point to and from the sites  
where the abortions were be-  
ing done. Initially, the  

Jane women did not do the  
abortions themselves. A  
chiropractor and paramedic  
were hired to do them. The  
Jane women provided all the  
supportive services from the  
counseling to the pelvic  

exam to determine the length  
of pregnancy. They sterilized  
the instruments, injected the  
local anesthesia into the  
cervix, collected the fee  

and coordinated the trans-  
portation. They did every-  
thing, but stopped short of  
inserting the instruments  
that actually did the abor-  
tion. They realized that this  
"division of labor" reflected  
traditional doctor-nurse  
roles. Around this time Carol  
Downer and Lorraine Rothman,  
two women from the self-help  
clinic in Los Angeles, came  
to visit and discussed men-  
strual extraction, a simple  
aspiration method that can  

be used for early abortion.  
Following this visit, the  
Jane women decided to begin  
doing the abortions them-  
selves. They had observed and  
assisted in hundreds of abor-  
tions and knew it was a sim-  
ple procedure.  

During their operation, the  
Jane Collective provided  
abortion care to 10,000 women  
with no major complications.  
They had a vast network of  
referral sources including  
the Chicago police. The work-  
shop provided a practical per-  
spective on what it was like  
to run an underground abor-  
tion service in Chicago in  
the late 60's and early 70's.  
It is not possible for a wo-  
man who has done that kind of  
work to romanticize the sit-  
uation, as others of us who  
are younger and have not  
lived with that reality may  
tend to do. The opportunity  
to learn directly from the  
Jane Collective is invaluable  
given the situation we are  
currently facing.  

In conclusion, the confer-  
ence did develop some speci-  
fic mandates for the abortion  
rights movement. It seemed
