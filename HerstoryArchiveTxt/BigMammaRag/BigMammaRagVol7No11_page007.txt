Thousands Demand Free Choice

Nancy Hoch

Tens of thousands of women and
male supporters participated in over
500 rallies, teach-ins, forums, and
other activities Oct. 21 - 29 to
mark national Abortion Rights
Action Week (ARAW).

The week came in response to the
continued erosion of women's right
to abortion. National and local
legislation has tightened guidelines
to the point that in many places, it
is near-impossible for a woman without
significant financial resources
to obtain an abortion.

Just as ARAW was getting underway,
Congress voted the tightest restric-
tions yet on federal Medicaid funding
for abortions. Although the vote is
not final, activists fear the lan-
guage will be incorporated in the
ultimate legislation. Since an
estimated 580,000 women seeking
abortions were unable to obtain them
in 1977, before any congressional
funding restrictions went into
effect, the numbers are certain to be
much higher now and in the future.

Aside from legislation, so-called
right-to-life forces have launched
a campaign of intimidation, picketing,
occupying, and fire-bombing abortion
facilities. In addition, they have
pressured 15 of the necessary 34
states to call for a constitutional
convention specifically to prohibit
abortion.

The right-to-life movement had set
a strategy of promoting an emotional
single-issue debate. But as the
success of the ARAW had shown, more
women are recognizing the anti-
abortion drive as an attack on the
rights of all women. There are in-
dications that the fight is broad-
ening in character, an absolute
necessity for beating back the right
wing.

In over 225 cities, union women,
third world women, and many others
came together to uphold reproductive
rights. Some 50,000 pro-choice
signatures were presented to a group
of legislators on Capitol Hill to
cap the week Oct. 30. This presen-
tation followed a week of petition-
gathering and rallies organized by
a coalition of 21 groups.

In an Oct. 27 New York City rally
of 1,000 people at the UN, author
Robin Morgan told demonstrators, "I
brought my son today to show what
we mean by pro-choice."

Charging that 24% of all Native
American women have been sterilized,
in many cases without their consent
or knowledge, Pauline Haines of
Women of All Red Nations (WARN) said,
"No man sitting up there in an office
is going to dictate to us who, where,
and how we will have children."

A series of forums in Chicago cul-
minated in a downtown rally Oct. 27.
Keynote speaker Alice Peurala, pres-
ident of United Steel Workers Local
65, told 200 people: "It's no acci-
dent that the same forces which deny
women their freedom of choice would
with their right-to-work laws deny
workers a safe and healthy workplace."

In Boston, events occurred almost
every day. They included a forum
on law and abortion, 10 radio talk
shows and a traveling slide show on
sterilization abuse.

A rally of 165 in San Diego heard
a speaker from Emancipacion, a
Mexican organization working around
abortion rights. She announced that
similar rallies and marches were
being held during the weekend in
Mexico and other Latin American
countries.

In other cities, there were tours
of abortion clinics and many campus
activities, including one at Wash-
ington, D.C.'s Catholic University
where the right-to-lifers proved so
disruptive that police had to be
called in.

In Detroit, one fair brought out
200 teenagers, a group severely
affected by abortion cutbacks but
notoriously hard for the pro-choice
movement to reach.

Mainstreaming, Homogenization

In general, ARAW organizers found
much of the public unaware of abor-
tion restrictions such as the Hyde
Amendment, passed in 1977, which
prohibits the use of federal Medicaid
funds for 99% of abortions.

The ARAW actions took place amid
a backdrop of ever-more restrictive
federal legislation on abortion.
Until Nov. 20, when a vote will be
retaken, only women whose pregnancy
endangers their lives or is the
result of rape and incest will be
eligible for abortion funding. This
is the strictest guideline on fed-
eral funding since abortion was
legalized in 1973.

"It's temporary," said Janet
Beals of the National Abortion Rights
Action League (NARAL), "But it's
precedent-setting. It's the first
time restrictions have been this
strict...There's a good chance that
the Labor-HEW appropriations bill
will end up with this wording."

The Hyde Amendment, the right-to-
life movement's greatest victory, cuts
off most federal funding for abor-
tions, but gives the states the
option to use their own Medicaid
to take up the slack. Only eight
states, however, are voluntarily
funding all or most abortions.
Fourteen others are under court
orders to do so.

In Illinois Oct. 30, the state
legislature voted an even more
repressive measure than the Hyde
Amendment, giving the father rights
to block abortions and including
other restrictions. A court chal-
lenge to the measure by the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is
expected.

Since the major providers of Medi-
caid -- New York, California, and
Washington, D.C. -- are among the
areas continuing to fund abortions,
the full brunt of the amendment to
the 300,000 women a year who receive
Medicaid abortions had not yet
been felt.

According to Dr. J. Gold, abortion
surveillance officer at the Atlanta-
based Center for Disease Control
(CDC), only 10% of all public hos-
pitals perform abortions. Overall,
including private doctors' offices,
he estimates there are only 2,000
abortion providers nationwide.
Beyond limited access, the attack
on abortion includes:

--Ordinances passed by seven
states and several municipalities
that seriously inhibit the abortion
process. These ordinances, modeled
on the Akron, Ohio, Comprehensive
Ordinance, include requirements
such as: an illustrated lecture
on fetal life, and a mandatory wait-
ing period of 24-48 hours. Some of
the ordinances require a funeral
for the fetus. All these ordinances
are under court challenge by the
ACLU.

--The firebombing and vandalism
of 14 abortion clinics in the past
two years and the constant harass-
ment of countless others. Some
clinics have been picketed every
Saturday since their opening in
1973, and guards at the entrance to
clinics have become common practice.

--Congressional curtailment of
payments for abortions for Peace
Corps workers and civilian and mil-
itary employees of the Department
of Defense and their dependents.

--Congressional action prohibiting
the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
from directing studies on abortion
rights.

--Legislation under the Legal
Services Corporation Act preventing
legal service attorneys from rep-
resenting clients fighting restric-
tive abortion laws.

--An amendment to the Pregnancy
Disability Act, passed last spring,
allowing employers to exclude ab-
ortion from disability and health
insurance.

NOW Holds National Convention

Fran Day

The National Organization for Wo-
men held its 12th annual convention
in Los Angeles during the weekend of
October 6. What happened at that
convention has been termed by some
as "vicious and brutal." Del Martin
and Phyllis Lyon, coauthors of
Lesbian Woman, according to one re-
port, were so shaken that they plan
to "let their memberships in NOW ex-
pire." Del Martin stated, "NOW is no
longer a feminist organization...NOW
is trying to overpower its members
rather than empower them. This is
male-type politics, an inability to
struggle with disagreement."

"The setting was as complex and
as overpowering as the politics which
took place. When the largest femin-
ist organization in the women's move-
ment brings its annual convention to
a luxury, 30-story, glass-belted tu-
bular hotel with $50 menu items, you
know the Women's Movement has gone
establishment.

Indeed, out-of-the-revolution and
into-the-mainstream was the story of
the weekend...NOW moved to the right
and abbreviated feminism in the name
of efficiency." (Lesbian Tide)

What actually happened at the con-
vention to create such controversy?
Most of the conflict centered around
the way the elections race was han-
dled. How did it happen that NOW
swept out of office its only open
lesbian incumbent, denied office to
the only woman of color running and
refused re-election to a politically
radical officer?

President Ellie Smeal and Execu-
tive Vice President Judy Goldsmith
were unopposed in their bid for re-
election, so the focus was on the
offices of Action Vice President,
Secretary and Treasurer. Smeal,
breaking with a decade's tradition,
formed a cadre of five (alternately
referred to as "The Team," "The Slate"
and "The Machine") which excluded the
only lesbian (Arlie Scott) and the
only woman of color (Sharon Parker).
Here then, was a NOW president, for
the first time in the organization's
history, openly campaigning for a
slate. In explanation, Smeal told
the delegates, "This (backing a slate)
is the most difficult thing I've done
for NOW...the challenge that lies be-
fore us is so difficult that we must
have as our leadership the strongest
possible leaders...this group of of-
ficers is strongest and I seek active-
ly for their election. My duty is to
tell you how I feel." When asked if
she could work with whoever was elect-
ed, Smeal replied, “If that happens,
a tough job will be tougher...and I
will find that I am out of touch with
the membership."

“In what many perceived as a stun-
ning abandonment of NOW's principles
of Affirmative Action, Smeal defend-
ed her slate saying, 'I believe we
must go for qualifications. For too
long we've had token representation
in this organization.' She noted
that the members of the slate initially
began as independents, and said,
‘I did not go out to find people of
all combinations of the human race.'"
(Lesbian Tide) Allegations of "in-
competency" and "friction in the home
office" added to the case against
Scott.

When the polls closed later that
day, the NOW delegates had given
their president what she wanted. Her
slate had won by an almost two-thirds
margin. The newly elected leadership
of NOW is made up of five straight
white women.

Do these new leaders possess the
expertise to deal with a wide range
of issues? Will the “homogenized
monolith," as one member described it,
be able to reach out to women of color
and speak credibly about affirmative
action and NOW's commitment to a
visible lesbian rights campaign? (see
box) Or will NOW, as Ellie Smeal
described it, become a "mainstream
civil rights organization"?

Feminist historian and NOW member
Marilyn Murphy warned, "To get the
vote in 1920, the Suffrage Movement
sold out the immigration question and
Blacks...What's happening now is--
give us ERA at any price. NOW is be-
coming respectable and is paying the
price of sisterhood."

A group of disillusioned lesbian
and straight feminist delegates who
called themselves "Appalled Women"
met late Sunday to discuss their
frustrations. It appeared that
Smeal's campaign tactics may have
taken their toll on a number of com-
mitted NOW members. Although some
had decided to leave NOW, others want-

The National Organization for Wo-
men, at its 12th annual convention,
overwhelmingly passed the strongest
lesbian rights resolution ever acted
upon by NOW. The resolution calls
for the hiring of a full-time staff
person to work on lesbian issues, the
promotion of a national campaign for
lesbian rights and the expenditure
next year of $25,000 on lesbian/gay
issues.

ed to form a Feminist Caucus within
NOW; others discussed the possible
publication of a NOW Free Press.

"It is clear that the results of
the 1979 NOW elections raise serious
questions for the organization's fu-
ture. There are no women of color and
only two open lesbians in NOW's top
27 posts (board and officers). All
five officers are straight and white,
three are from a single geographic re-
gion (mid-Atlantic), with the top two
coming from the same state. The top
three officers have a primary commit-
ment to the ERA and their backgrounds
are heavily weighted to that one is-
sue." (Lesbian Tide)

The question for radical lesbian
and/or women of color feminists in
NOW is the same as it was for many
of us in past years: Do we stay in
NOW and fight to pull the organiza-
tion to the left or do we leave and
let NOW continue in its movement to
the right?
