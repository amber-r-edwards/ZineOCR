Redstockings Re-Emerge

Gloria Steinem Accused

Woodwoman

The Redstockings, a New York
feminist group, has recently
reorganized after several years
of dormancy to release a press
statement accusing Gloria
Steinem of past and continuing
collaboration with the CIA.

The Redstockings are: Kathie
Sarachild, a founding member of
both New York Radical Women
and Redstockings, editor of the
now-defunct political journal,
Woman's World, and currently
working as a film editor; Carol
Hanisch, also a founding
member of NYRW and initiator of
the 1968 Miss America protest,
at which women protested the
degrading and oppressive con-
cept of beauty contests; Barbara
Leon and Colette Price, both
editors of Woman's World and
active in radical feminist
politics.

The Redstockings was one of
the first groups to evolve a
comprehensive political analysis
of women’s oppression. In the
Redstockings Manifesto (see
Sisterhood is Powerful, ed.
Robin Morgan, Random House,
1970), they define all men as
oppressors and women as an
oppressed class defining their
“best interest as that of the
poorest, most brutally exploited
woman.”

Two-pronged Attack

The substance of the
Redstockings’ press release can
be divided into two parts: on the
one hand, they document
research into Gloria Steinem’s
directorship, 1959 through
1962, of the Independent
Research Service, which Ram-
parts magazine exposed in 1967
as a CIA front organization. They
allege that she has attempted, in
later years, to play down and
even to conceal her involvement.

Forced Sterilization

in the organization. The press
release also presents facts and
speculations about Ms.
magazine's funding, implying
that the magazine might itself
represent officially-inspired anti-
revolutionary and corporate in-
terests. The Women’s
Action Alliance, a women's
informational clearinghouse, of
which Gloria Steinem is
chairperson, is also implicated.
The second part of the press
release is devoted to an analysis
of Gloria Steinem’s and Ms.
politics, which the Redstockings
see as co-optive and conse-
quently harmful to the Women’s
Movement. They present
evidence that the CIA has been
actively engaged in keeping tabs

on the international Women’s
Movement since as early as
1962, and they suggest that Ms.
and the Women's Action
Alliance are not unconnected
with the CIA’s continuing sur-
veillance of feminists and
feminist bodies.

As Big Mama Rag goes to
press, there has been no official
response from Gloria Steinem,
although we are told that she
and Margaret Sloan (a lesbian
feminist, active in founding the
National Black Feminist
Organization and a staff member
of Ms. until June 1974) are
working on a statement. Majority
Report, a New York feminist
newspaper, contacted the Ms.
offices and talked with Joanne

Edgar, one of the magazine's
editors. According to her, Gloria
Steinem had not read the
Redstockings’ press release at
that time (mid-May). Her staff at
Ms. had allegedly advised her
that to do so would be “a waste of
time.” Ms. Edgar replied to some
of the charges leveled by the
Redstockings, but their response
compared with the 16-page
tabloid press release, was
sketchy and far from complete.

Uncomfortable

Big Mama Rag is currently
engaged in extensive investiga-
tion of all aspects of a story. We
are not entirely comfortable with
the press release, partly because
the news of Gloria Steinem’s
connections with the CIA was
made public by the New York
Times in 1967, and has never
been denied by her. We aren't
sure what ends are served by
raking it up again. While we
agree with the Redstockings that
“the Ms. editors should come
forward with more information
about their unusual
stockholders,” we feel that their
method of combining attacks on
Ms. finances with attacks on
the magazine’s and Steinem’s
politics, comes dangerously
close to smear tactics. We are
somewhat offended by the tone
of the press statement, which
slants the information it
presents in such a way as to
make certain conclusions in-
evitable, rather than presenting
the facts and leaving the reader
to reach her own conclusions.
Finally, we are uncomfortable
with the amount of space given
in the press release to adver-
tising for the Redstockings’
forthcoming journal, Feminist
Revolution.

Authorities Abuse Mother Right

Almost 50 Native American,
community and civil rights-
related organizations have
launched a campaign this spring
on behalf of Norma Jean Serena,
a 37-year-old Native American
woman who was sterilized
against her will. She is seeking
damages from hospital and
welfare officials in Armstrong
County, Pennsylvania for order-
ing the sterilization, and for
illegally removing three of her
five children from her.

The medical reason for the
sterilization of Serena, a welfare
recipient, was officially stated as
“socioeconomic,” and the prime
reason for the removal of her
children, says the Norma Jean
Serena Support Committee, was
her association with Black peo-
ple.

Children Removed

It was early in 1970 that the
Child Welfare Services first
interfered with Serena, a Creek-
Sawnee from Oklahoma. The
agency had received reports
from an unidentified person that
Serena was associating with
Black people, and that it was
dangerous for neighborhood
children to be “coming and
going when Black men were in
the vicinity.”

Caseworkers removed the two
young children, Gary and Lisa,
from Serena’s custody by forcing
the three to accompany them to
the Children’s Hospital in
Pittsburgh, claiming “it is the
law you must go along.”

A doctor who examined the
children found them in good
health. Caseworkers, however,
told Serena that the children
were seriously ill, and the
children were “voluntarily”
placed in foster homes.

Although the mother was told
that foster care would be only
temporary, the foster parents
were told the placement was
permanent and that they would
later be able to adopt the two.
“In this way,” wrote the
Norma Jean Support Com-
mittee, “two of Mrs. Serena’s
children were taken from her
through fraud, without any legal
procedures at all.”

A third child, Serena’s son
Shawn, was also sent to a foster
home immediately after birth in
August 1970. The Child Welfare
and the Board of Assistance
authorities persuaded Serena to
give up her child because she
was “ill” and exhausted from
experiences in the hospital.

After repeated but un-
successful attempts to visit her
children and have them returned
to her, Serena resorted to legal
action. Finally - with the aid of
the Council of Three Rivers
American Indian Center in
Pittsburgh, Serena received a
favorable court ruling in 1973,
ordering that her children be
returned.

But the return was inten-
tionally delayed by Armstrong
County Child Welfare
authorities for almost a year,
reports the Support Committee,
“until the threat of contempt of
court proceedings led to the
return of the children,” in
March 1974.

Involuntary Sterilization

The second part of Serena’s
suit seeks damages for an in-
voluntary sterilization performed
on her immediately after
the birth of her last child in
August 1970. She was on
medication and exhausted from
delivery at the time the operation
was performed, and didn’t learn
of it until the next day when she
was convinced to sign a consent
form.

Welfare officials told Serena
prior to the difficult delivery that
she “had had enough children”
and that there was a danger that
any subsequent pregnancies
might result in the birth of
retarded or deformed children.

One out of seven Native
American women of childbear-
ing age are sterilized, reports the
Medical Committee for Human
Rights, a member of the support
committee. “The Serena
family’s nightmare may sound
incredible,” the committee added,
“but for Black, Indian,
Spanish-speaking and poor
women, they have become
terribly familiar.”

Richard Levine, the
Neighborhood Legal Services
attorney serving as Serena’s
counsel, called the case one of
the most incredible civil rights
cases ever to be filed in the
United States.

“The most difficult thing about
the case,” said Levine, “is
getting people to believe it... At
least we have documentation of
the racism and unethical decep-
tion practiced by these agen-
cies,” he continued.

About 25-35 percent of all
Native American children are
separated from their families
and placed in foster homes,
adoptive homes, or institutions,
according to studies done in
1969 and 1974 by the Associa-
tion on American Indian Affairs.

For the case to come to court,
the Norma Jean Serena Support
Committee explains, nationwide
support and funds are
desperately needed.

Big Mama Rag Library
Expanding Rapidly

Judy Miller

The Big Mama Rag Library is
growing by leaps and bounds. It
offers a good selection of
publications, many of which are
not available in most schools or
libraries in the area. The women
of the library are proud of our
growth and would like to see
more women take advantage of
it. Offerings range from self-
health manuals to general works
on feminism to radical feminist
publications to novels and
poetry.

We'd like to thank the in-
dividual sisters and
organizations which donated
money or publications to the
library. Without their help we
would have little to offer.

More women are needed to
help the library grow. If you're
interested in working with the
library, contact the Big Mama
Rag office.
Donations of publications
(books, magazines, anything
librarable with a feminist slant
or created by a woman, as well
as second-hand books we can
trade for feminist ones) and
donations of money are needed
and can be brought to the Big
Mama Rag office from 10 to 4:30
Monday to Friday or contact the
office at 322-2010 and we will see
that your donations are picked
up.
