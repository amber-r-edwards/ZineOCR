stored their applications so  
they would adhere to govern-  
ment regulations. In a recent  
test case, the Home Office  
interpreted immigration law  
to mean that any person in  
this position is an "illegal  
entrant" under the 1971 Im-  
migration Act. That agents  
deceived women and frequently  
altered their papers is ir-  
relevant to government offic-  
ials. The women have been  
made legally responsible for  
any deception, all acts of  
malfeasance, and this, the  
Home Office declared, "is the  
case even if the misrepresent-  
ation was effected without  
the person's knowledge.

Last winter, hundreds de-  
monstrated in support of the  
200 Filipinas and began a  
campaign urging local Members  
of Parliament to sign a mo-  
tion allowing the women to  
remain. About the same time,  
another protest was underway,  
also involving the struggle  
of third world women in Bri-  
tain. On November 15, 1980,  
500 people marched through  
Rochdale to support Anwar  
Ditta, a Pakistani woman of  
British birth, in her effort  

to bring her three children  
to live in Britain.

appears to be about one wo-  
man's battle with British  
bureaucracy, is only one ex-  
ample of how far immigration  
control will go to keep non-  
whites out of the country.  
Six years ago, Anwar Ditta  
and her husband reentered the  
country through the wrong  
procedure - a technical slip-  
up with no obvious consequen-  
ces to their status as right-  
ful residents of Britain. Yet  
the procedural error seems to  
have triggered the wheels of  
immigration control, which  
reached high gear when Dit-  
ta's application for her  
children came under consider-  
ation. Despite having ample  
and adequate proof of their  
births and parentage, the  
Home Office maintained that  
these were not the legitimate  
children of the Dittas. Af-  
ter a six year legal battle,  
the case was finally decided  
in the spring of 1981. Ditta  
was denied permission to  
bring her children to the

A London Anarchist,  
Recent riots in many parts  
of London and other English  
cities are leading some peo-  
ple to draw parallels between  

riots

the developing situation there  
and that of rioting in North-  
ern Ireland. I will, for the  
purpose of this article, be  
using Brixton as an example  
of the situation in England;  
this being the area I feel  
most qualified to write about,  
as I have been involved in  
the work of a Bookshop there.  
Riots in Brixton have had,  
exclusively, a spontaneous  
beginning, usually as a re-  
sult of a particular incident  
involving over policing on the  
streets, or following the  
examples of police harassment.  
There is no doubt that the  
massive force of police de-  
ployed in Brixton (ostensibly  
to try to cope with a soaring

country to live and was ult-  
imately refused any right of  
appeal.

At no time has the govern-  
ment openly disputed Ditta's  
own right of residency. Since  
she is a British born citizen,  
not a permit holder or a set-  
tler like the Filipinas who  
are subject to immigration  
control, challenging her cit-  
izenship directly would be  
terribly awkward both nation-  
ally and internationally. In-  
stead, Ditta is given the  
bitter option of remaining in  
her own country and thereby  
"deserting" her children or  
returning to Pakistan which  
is neither her country of  
birth nor her home.

Currently a new National-  
ity Bill is being rushed  
through Parliament by the  
Tory government to "solve"  
the problems of immigration.  
For 20 years, British offic-  
ials have been talking about

crime rate), is a source of  
great anger and frustration  
within the community there.  
Not only are the sheer numbers  
seen as an unnecessary harass-  
ment, but also the methods of  
questioning and intimidation  
have led some people to des-  
cribe the area as one of occu-  
pation by a force that is  
neither trusted nor wanted. The  
riots are certainly not racial  
in nature, nor are they in  

any way engineered by outside  
tacticians, as some media com-  
mentators would have their  
public believe. If one was  
pushed to describe the nature  
of the riots, assuming that  
one could come to a conclusion,  
one would say that they are,  
broadly, anti-authoritarian.  
People, in clashes with the  
police, are saying that they  
want control of their own  
streets and are gaining the  
confidence generally to rebel  
against all that oppresses  
them. All places or people  
seen as authoritarian can be  
the subject of attacks in the  
rebellion that follows. Looting  
has been seen partly as an  
attack on consumerist values  
and as an attempt to get  
essential goods which many  
people cannot afford.

iving "the British way of life"  
and of not being "swamped by  
people with a different cul-  
ture." Very soon, under a  
system that will redefine  
citizenship by establishing  
different categories of cit-  
izens, thousands of third  
world women will be forced to  
live like refugees in their  
own country, denied access to  
social and political benefits.  
Others will face repatriation  
to countries in which they no  
longer have homes or cultural  
ties.

The Nationality Bill sig-  
nifies the systematization of  
repression which has been  
present in piecemeal fashion  
in earlier immigration laws  
but was not yet codified.  
Targeted against immigrants  
in general, the bill has spe-  
cific implications for women.  
The plan underway is to con-  
struct three categories of

ford. Unemployment, bad hous-  
ing, creaking social services  
and racial discrimination,  
provide an undertow of dis-  
content, but no single factor  
can be called the root cause  
of rebellion.

Police tactics in riots can  
be seen to have developed  
quite quickly and a familiar  
pattern of isolation, dispersal  
and ultimate containment has  
followed, plus a familiar series  
of raids and arrests in at-  
tempts to continue the process  
of intimidation and control.  
Various shades of political  
organisations (not involved  
in the riots nor instigators  
of them) have sought to capi-  
talise on the situation after  
the event, but have in the  
main been met with the scorn  
that they deserve. Countless  

media persons and politicians  

have stalked the streets look-  
ing for good copy and each way  
the people lose out and their  
voice goes largely misunder-  
stood or ignored, or re-inter-  
preted to serve various vested  
interests.

Black, Disabled Lesbian Takes A Stand

(reprinted from Workers  
World)

Gin T. Loy

When Reagan describes the  
cutbacks, he talks in terms  
of statistics, not people.  
Sometimes he, and other fig-  
ures in his administration,  
try to justify the social  
service slashes by broad  
generalizations, slandering  
the poor and oppressed.  
"Welfare cheats," he says,  
"Food stamp black market,"  
we hear. But never do the  
Reaganites talk about the  
individual people, their un-  
ique lives and needs, who,  
under the Reagan budget are  
being denied the most basic  
means to meet these needs.

Gwen Elliot is such a per-  
son. She is a Black lesbian,  
sightless and diabetic. She,  
and many other disabled from  
around the country, attended  
the All-Peoples Congress in  
Detroit last month. They made  
it clear exactly what the ef-  

fects of the Reagan cutbacks  
will be for many people.

Her food stamp allowance of  
$63 a month was recently cut  
to $10 a month. Because she  
is diabetic and has specific  
nutritional needs, this cut  
becomes an even greater hard-  
ship. Her Supplemental Social  
Income (SSI) barely amounts  
to $350 a month. Gwen was  

forced to move because funds  

for subsidized housing were  
frozen by the Reagan prog-  
ram.

“I am very angry. I have a  
right to be angry. I'd like  
to take the power they took  
away from me back," said  
Gwen. It isn't the sightless-  
ness to which she is referr-  
ing. The disability is not to  
blame for the inhumanity and  
lack of genuine human servic-  
es in this country. Her story  
is “too uncomfortable for  
most people to hear. But peo-  
ple need to know about all  
oppression. My political  
statement can help others,"  
she says.

Like thousands of premature  
babies in the 40's and 50's,  
Gwen was left in an incubator  
for two to three months. It  
caused her sightlessness by  
overexposure to oxygen,  
which destroyed the optic  
nerves. “We were very poor  
and very Black. We didn't  
know how to sue, and my par-  
ents were just glad I was  
alive," said Gwen.

“When you are in high  
school you must report to  
the New York State Commission  
for the Blind. You have two  
options. You fit their stan-  

dards and go to college, or  
you go on SSI. In both cases  
you have to see a psycholog-  
ist appointed by them. Any  
problems you have, you are  
made to feel it is a failure  
to adjust to being blind,  
rather than the oppression  
you have to face."

Gwen has a biochemical im-  
balance resulting in an en-  
otional disability for which  
she was hospitalized. "I  
couldn't take dealing with  

food stamps, no doors were  
open, no place to live. I  
didn't want to go back to the  
state therapists and their  
degradation. They were pump-  
ing me full of drugs. It was  
oppression that put me in the  
hospital," said Gwen.

Gwen has now secured an ap-  
artment in a building for the  
sightless, the only one in New  
York City. However, there are  
problems here as well. "In  
order to live here you have  
to sign an affidavit as to  
why you aren't working. They  
don't accept if you've been  
hospitalized in a mental in-  
stitution. This is being  
fought now," she explained.

In addition, "they monitor  
who goes in and out, suppos-  
edly for security,” she said.  
But a gay man is being ha-  
rassed for being gay when-  
ever he receives financial  
assistance.

"In therapy you learn not  
to say you are political, not  
to say you are a lesbian be-

Of Anger,

seemingly waiting retribution  
of various sorts, or seeking  
to make something out of new  
found confidence--police raids  
and arrests have created un-  
ease and unrest leading to  
anti-social acts of mugging  
and threats between various  
distinct sections of the com-  
munity. In some cases, minor-  
ity groups feel more vulner-  
able and unless steps are  
taken quickly to improve com-  
munication and understanding  
the situation can only get  
worse.

From this brief outline, we  
can begin to draw certain par-  
allels between recent events  
in England and some in North-  
ern Ireland. Similar patterns  
of spontaneous rioting  
against an occupying force  
emerge. Details of weapons  
used--bricks, petrol bombs,  
sticks, barricades, make twin  
lists. However, it should be  
noted that the enemy in Nor-  
thern Ireland is a much more  
directly identifiable one,  
and its powers far greater,  
its weaponry more sophistica-  
ted, its tactics seasoned  
with practice. Indeed, the  
campaign of resistance to the  
enemy in Northern Ireland is  

Raids, Arrests And Oppression

fought consistently on many  
fronts, as it has to be, and  
riots are often an uncoordin-  
ated expression of frustra-  
tion and anger rather than  
concerted attacks by blacks  
on whites in Brixton, where  
one group is singled out for  
attention if it appears to  
be more privileged or part of  
the system of oppression.

The Irish, at war against  
what is regarded as a foreign  
occupation, have a long trad-  
ition of the use of violence  
to ensure that their voice is  
heard. Violence, and often  
only violence, has been ef-  
fective in achieving progress.  
Violence is a reflection of  
the failure of politicians  
and all those who seek to con-  
trol our lives. Brixton, Bel-  
fast, Bristol, Toxteth, have  
all shown the determination  
of some to rebel against and  
to resist a common enemy. No  
one can predict what the like-  
ly outcome of general rebel-  
lion would be, but it is  
unlikely that people having  
tasted first progress and  
gained confidence on their  
streets will rest content to  
sit in apathy from now on and  
not take long term decisions  

for their own lives.  
Rioting is a spectacle--it

draws attention to a minority  
of a community who exhibit  

anger, courage and determina-  
tion in the face of crushing  
odds. Concentration on the  
spectacle in the streets, how-  
ever, ignores the existence  
of those whose streets are  
being defended and who feel  
powerless and without a  
voice behind closed doors,  
largely forgotten, and for  
whom the prospect of taking  
on, unarmed, an armed police  
force, is frightening. Pic-  
tures of riots show largely  
young and male participants.  
Those people on the fringes  
of disturbances and who take  
advantage of the disorders  
to loot shops and other pre-  
mises, can be seen as coming  
from wider sections of the  
community, and feature the  
young and old, male and fe-  
male, black and white. There  
are signs, on both sides of  
the sea, that people are mov-  
ed to take what they need in-  
stead of waiting for or allow-  
ing an authority to make de-  
cisions for them. Anarchists  
certainly have a great con-  
tribution to make in the  
creation of a new life, once  
demands are fulfilled and  
once freedom from occupation  
is ensured.
