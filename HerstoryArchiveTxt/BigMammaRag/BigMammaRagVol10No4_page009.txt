Of, Contradictions In, Solidarity Union

included in the organizational
expression of the movement,
that it was not separated from
its political, i.e., democratic
character.

The form of organization Sol-
idarity was opposing was the
Communist PZPR (Polish United
Workers Party), which has tri-
ed to rule by enforcing the
one "cure" it has for the ail-
ing economy: raising food pri-
ces. When the government an-
nounced, in July, 1981, that
it would need to raise food
prices by as much as 400 per-
cent (which they are now try-
ing to enforce again), the wo-
men were the first to oppose
it. Women in Lodz sat in with
massive wildcats and dared to
hold street demonstrations.
Over 10,000 women, including
children and grandmothers, with
a cordon of men around the
outside for protection, demon-
strated for a week. Their ban-
ners proclaimed "Hungry of the
world, unite!" thus both ex-
tending and deepening the slo-
gan that has marked the East
European revolt ever since
the East German workers first
demanded both "Bread and Free-
dom" in 1953.

That revolt has continued
for almost 30 years. In 1956
it became actual revolution in
Hungary. In 1968 the demand in
Czechoslovakia was for "Social-
ism with a human face." Pro-
tests and massive strikes er-
upted in Poland in 1970 and
again in 1976.

It was in the wake of the
1976 Polish revolt in Radom
and Ursus that a new link be-
tween workers and intellec-
tuals was forged when a new
organization arose called
KOR--Committee to Defend Wor-
kers. After all of the impri-
soned workers were freed, KOR
continued its activity, pub-
lishing its own uncensored
bulletins and helping to pub-
lish Robotnik. (For reprints
from Robotnik and other arti-
cles, see Today's Polish Fight
for Freedom, a bilingual pam-
phlet which I edited. It was
published by News & Letters in
the spring of 1980 before ev-
ents exploded in Poland.) When
Tygodnik Solidarnosc (Solidar-
ity Weekly) interviewed them,
here is what Irena Woycicka
had to say about working out
that relationship: "To help
the Radom and Ursus workers
financially and legally was
relatively easy. But to under-
stand each other, to get in-
formation--that was much more
difficult.”

By working out, on the basis
of workers' own stories, such
documents as the Charter of
Workers' Rights, the intellec-
tuals who edited Robotnik
helped lay the ground for the
future development of Solidar-
ity.

The uncensored press prolif-
erated, the ideas of "social
self-defense” spread over Po-
land. When the government in
the summer of 1978 introduced
a new retirement tax for far-
mers, the peasant women took
social self-defense in their
own hands. First they chased
off the tax collectors. Lis-
ten to this report:

"On 25 June in Gorny and Os-
trowek there appeared a tax
collector who took property
from the boycotting farmers...
When he came to Kowalski's
farm he saw women from the
whole village at the doorstep.
They didn't look at him all
too favorably and there was
some talk about some sickles
which each household has. What
happened is not exactly known,
but what is known, is that
though the tax collector got
there, he never entered...
(Glos--Voice--Aug.-Sept. 1978.
Glos was one of the uncensor-
ed papers published in the
aftermath of the 1976 revolt.)

Then, to make sure the gov-
ernment heard how angry they
were, they organized a milk
strike--they refused to deliver
milk to the state collection
points. The strike was entire-
ly successful and only after
that did the women go to their
local priest asking him for
help in organizing the social
self-defense. The peasant
movement, crowned with the
recognition of Rural Solidar-
ity, had its beginning in the
activity of those women.

Modeling their activity on
KOR's "flying university,"
where the intellectuals would
go and deliver lectures,
wherever and whenever it was
possible, on subjects frowned
on by the government (such as
history), the Farmers' Self-
Defense Committee decided to
set up the People's Universi-
ty in January, 1979. It was
accomplished with the cooper-
ation of intellectuals from
Warsaw, particularly Marzena
Gorszczyk-Kecik, who was a
major power behind the init-
iative and subsequently was
charged with organizing the

meetings of the university.
Rural Solidarity, built on
these foundations, has never
lost its relation to the wor-
kers, so that after the dec-
laration of martial law, they
brought food to the workers
in occupied factories. That
aid to the resistance was
given despite the church's
repeated calls for "calm."

But then, some opposition
to the church has always ex-
isted in the workers' and
particularly women's activi-
ty. In October, 1981, the wo-
men textile workers in Zyrard-
ow refused to follow the
church's advice to postpone
their demands and end their
strike. They struck because
there was no food--a strike
the government declared "po-
litical" and therefore ille-
gal. The women refused to re-
cognize any distinction be-
tween political and economic
despite threats from the gov-
ernment and the church's ap-
peal that they go back to
work. They even defied their
own leadership, which, fear-
ful of the consequences, had
advised them to stop their
strike.

With the tremendous activi-
ty of women there also had
arisen the beginnings of a
Women's Movement. Sigma was
the first of Poland's femin-
ist groups, organized in Nov-
ember, 1980. They intended to
publish their own newspaper,
telling the history of women
and their ideas. Their deman-
ds included equal pay, devel-
opment of social programs for
women and increase in men's
responsibility for their chi-
ldren. As for abortion, Krys-
tyna Kowalewska, one of the
founders of Sigma, puts it
clearly: "Many of our demands
conflict with the position
of the Church. For example,
abortion. The Church has
clearly spoken against it. We
can't accept that." (Connex-
ions, May 1, 1981.)

Abortion has been used as a
political weapon between the
church and the state with
complete disregard for women’s
freedom. The Church opposes
abortion, while the state
does not allow any other for-
ms of birth control, forcing
women to go through an end-
less series of abortions. The
Russian feminists' descrip-
tion of abortion clinics as
"mince-meat machines" is also
true in Poland. The feminists

made the question revolution-
ary by making it a question
of human choice, opposed to
both church and state manipu-
lations.

Although the appearance of
so fledgling a group as Sig-
ma is by no means a pivotal
point in the Polish events
today, it is another sign of
the new revolutionary force
women represent, and appears
minor only if we forget his-
tory so completely that each
time something arises, it
appears to be for the first
time. The truth is that wom-
en in Poland have been both
revolutionary force and Rea-
son throughout their whole
history. That is seen not
only in the fact that the
1863 war against Russia was
known as the "Women's War",
("In the 1863 insurrection...
women proved to be skilled
conspirators and comrades-in
arms... For two decades the
vestals had been turning in-
to warriors; they demanded
recognition not only of their
womanly virtues but also
their ability to think and to
work... two of the first mass
strikes in Warsaw erupted
after women laborers and
prostitutes had been ordered
by the czarist police to
undergo identical hygienic
checkups." See Elzbieta Ettin-
ger, Comrade and Lover; Rosa
Luxemburg's Letters to Leo
Jogiches, Cambridge: MIT
Press, 1979) but in the life
and work of such magnificent
Polish women as Rosa Luxem-
burg--one of the greatest of
all revolutionary internat-
ionalists. It was she who so
appreciated Mass Strike that
she made a category out of it
after the 1905 Revolution.
And it is her dimension as
feminist which has first now
been disclosed. (A new work
by Raya Dunayevskaya, avail-
able now only in manuscript
form, explores the integral-
ity of Luxemburg's dimensions
as revolutionary, as feminist,
as thinker, and its signifi-
cance for our movement. Rosa
Luxemburg, Women's Liberation
and Marx's Philosophy of Rev-
olution will be published in
Fall, 1982 simultaneously by
Humanities Press in the US
and Harvester in Britain.)

The same kind of blinders
that keep some from seeing
the importance of Luxemburg's
