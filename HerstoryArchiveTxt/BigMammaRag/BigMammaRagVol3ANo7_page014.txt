groups of sixty. Each week we
had a task to work on, and had to
experience working on different
kinds of tasks in different sized
groups.

The first task was: assume our
group wants to develop a project
which will help others as well as
ourselves. What will we
develop? A low-priced food
store? A newspaper? An employ-
ment agency? A credit union?
Which one, and why? What are
the goals of the project? How will
we structure it internally? What

criteria will we establish to
determine if we have been
successful or not?

How To

Maintain the Group

The second week the task was
to deal with a political split —
lesbian/straight, working
class/middle class, or with a
disruptive member who was
taking too much time away from
the group's focus on the task.
Ironically, by the second week
the majority of the groups had
dissolved themselves.

The third week the groups
combined to work on a question
of political strategy in a
hypothetical situation: You are a
well-organized feminist group
which is strong in the communi-
ty. A new factory comes to town,
which has agreed to a strong
affirmative action program. But
the factory is polluting and has
threatened to discontinue the
affirmative action program if
your group pushes for en-
vironmental action. What
strategy does your group use in
this situation?

The fourth week the class was
to work as a whole on the
problem of choosing whether to
form a third party, to take over
the Democratic Party, to form a
National Feminist Union, or to
develop an alternative form of
government. Which of these
alternatives is best at this time in
history? Who will you make

——_———Salient signs with and under certain
conditions? How do you

challenge this system while
taking care of your own people?

In addition to the above tasks,
developed by Rita Mae Brown,
Medvec gave the small groups
the task of defining and develop-
ing a woman-defined economy,
with the goal of feeding the
largest number of women with
the best possible food and with
the least consumption of energy.

How to
Make Theory Practical

For many women these small
groups provided the space
within which to work out the
practicalities of the theories they
were studying. Many of the
small groups were unable to
complete their tasks; others
refused to do certain tasks
because of the energy required.
However, several groups were
successful in completing their
tasks and presented oral and
written reports to the class on
what they had done. The fourth
task which I described above
was tackled by some 20-30
women who worked day and
night over the last ten days at
SAGARIS to create, not a
hypothetical example, but real
organizations based on the sur-
vival needs of many women. The
Task Force Towards Building a
United Feminist Front presented
its plans and recruited workers
for grassroots organizational
work (See story this issue, p. 6).
In addition, the National Lesbian
Feminist Organization an-
nounced its beginnings and its
18-month plan building toward a
national convention.

Relaxing and Centering

Many women at SAGARIS
expressed the feeling that their
most sane moments and least
energy-draining experiences
happened in the body develop-
ment courses. Karate, taught by
Thomasina Robinson, and T’ai
Chi, taught by Harmony Ham-
mond, provided a structure
within which women as
individuals could feel their own
body/mind power. Thomasina
and Harmony, both experienced
in the meditative as well as the
physical aspects of their arts,
influenced us to relax, to keep
centered amidst the turmoil, and
to understand the political im-
portance of being physically

strong.

There were four elective
courses at SAGARIS: Alter-
natives, anti-taught by Margaret
Fielder, The Psychodynamics of
Minority Group Membership,
taught by E. Kitch Childs, Jour-

nalism, taught by Blanche Boyd
and Joan Peters; 

Writing, taught by Bertha Harris.
Since I actively participated in
only one of these courses,
Creative Writing, I will describe
what happened there.
Bad Girl Makes Good

Bertha Harris, head of the
Women's Studies Program at
Richmond College, Staten
Island, N.Y., organized a class of
45 women, most of whom were
new writers or women who had
never written before. The class
met weekly for a lecture and

twice a week for small group
readings and discussions of
individual work. By the third
week the class was down to
twenty women.

Harris’s lectures focused on
the connections between
political ideology and the art of
who we are as lesbians. Our
delight in our differentness as
lesbians, our erotic sense of
specialness is the impulse of the
lesbian imagination. Literature
is not made by good girls; we
need to clean up the circle jerk of
sweetness and light in the
women’s movement. We must
bring our differences up front
and be direct in our conflicts or
we will inevitably settle down
into a status quo mentality.
Harris believes we must identify
with the badness men have
bestowed on lesbians — that it is
the source of our energy. It is
dangerous and taboo to be both
smart and sexy, and lesbians are
both. There is a political reason
why certain subjects are taboo in
literature — it serves
patriarchal interests that they
are taboo. The class created
works on the forbidden subjects
of going down on a woman,
other/daughter relationships,
incest, cannibalism, sexuality as
children and with children. The
class presented its work to the
SAGARIS community later in
the session, and is making plans
for publication sometime in the
next year.

Awaken the Lesbian Brain

Harris discussed the idea of
the lesbian brain, of the connec-
tions between sexuality and
our thinking. She believes that
the lesbian’s sexual organ is the
brain — that we fall in love with
each other’s minds. Writers
must demystify romantic love,
and in so doing, will bring a
reality to our lives and to our art.

answers. Some women
protested during the reading
that they wanted to talk, not be
read to. The two collective
members read their statements
through. They then said they
were all going to leave, and they
wanted us as a group to take a
vote on whether or not Sagaris
should continue. They would
take a vote of second session
students, and if we decided
Sagaris should not continue,
they would shut down. They said
they hadn’t had enough time and
that they were very tired. Then
they all got up and left.
Fierce, then more and more
moderated discussion followed.
Some women wanted to know
what was happening. Others
said it was useless for us to sit
here since they said in their
statement that student par-
ticipation was not a priority at
this time, and they had the
power, and the power had just
walked out the door. Some said,
they are organized, we are not.
We should get organized and do
something. Others said they
didn't like confrontation politics
and that if the collective hadn't
walked out, Sagaris would have
fallen apart. Others said that
Sagaris must not be important to
their survival if they were so
willing to let it go without a fight.
Others said that the “powers-
that-be” may have planted an
agent in our midst to disrupt us.
Others said fuck you.

The Honeymoon Was Over

One thing was clear — the
honeymoon was over. They had
walked out the door and we were
left, like abandoned lovers, to
beg them to return or to get
ourselves together and face the
future. Some of the thirty
women who stayed to discuss
what happened told me later
that they saw what happened as
a lesson in what we had been
learning at Sagaris all along.
Control over our institutions.
Power. Being direct about
criticism. Getting organized.

Many women were up late
that night. Group meetings in
the dorms. Long talks. Tears.
Talk of going home. Wanting to
get away from it to think about it.
A couple of women decided not
to stay for second session. Talk
of finding a community to work
in. Of looking forward to the UFF
re-convening next April.

There were no more classes,
no more mealtime an-
nouncements, no more
meetings. Just packing up, say-
ing goodbye, looking forward to
time alone.

One Reporter’s Opinion

By the time I left three days
later, the collective seemed to be
standing by its decision of

Socialist...

From Page 11

without “feminism, or of a
feminism without socialism . . .
in the Marxist map of the social
world, human beings are dis-
tinguished as workers,
capitalists, or peasants; not as
men or women, gay or straight...
Feminism, on the other hand,
has specifically addressed itself
to the place of sex and sexuality
in human life, and is developing
a critique of human sexual
arrangements .. . But just as
Marxism does not provide a
complete map of the social
universe, neither does
feminism. It is as foolish to argue
that the relationship between
men and women is the source of
all oppression as it is to claim
that the relationship between
capital and labor is the cause of
all human discontent . . . We
need a movement which
recognizes and fights to abolish
all sources of human degrada-
tion, be they racism, sexism,
capitalism, imperialism, or
fascism. We need a movement
which will articulate socialist
politics within the women’s
movement, feminist politics
within the left.” (from the Les-
bian Caucus statement.)

Wednesday night. I told one of
them I thought they had made a
big mistake in walking out on a
group of politicized feminists.
Many of these women had been
through this struggle before in
the movement or in student
power days. Or were women
who have been in the collec-
tive’s shoes — of being made to
be accountable for their
leadership. Who understand the
struggle of sharing power and
responsibility, and who also
recognize that politically, it is
necessary for institutions to do
so.

Control over Sagaris than possi-
ble through personal ex-
pressions on an evaluation form
or the consumer's choice of
whether or not to attend Sagaris.
I, for one, wanted Sagaris to be
structured in such a way that
students would have equal
power and responsibility with
the administration in order to
directly influence the direction

of that institution. No more
“working solutions” which
bypass the very political

decisions Sagaris needs to face.

The collective has stated that
it wants to be the ‘most valuable
and relevant program possible.”
Valuable to whom? Relevant to
what? It wants it to be a “forum
within which the major issues
and theories of feminism can be
analyzed from different radical
feminist perspectives.” Who
decides which are the major
issues? And who is a radical
feminist?

To me, these statements say
almost nothing. Running any
institution requires making
choices every day. If Sagaris
survives this summer, it will still

have to face the issues of
lesbianism, class, minority
women, mothers, hidden

leadership and accountability,
and students’ demands for
power. It will also have to face
harder questions: who will teach
at Sagaris? Who will be accepted
as students? How much will it
cost? What is a feminist institute
like Sagaris for? An alternative
to women’s studies programs? A
training ground for organizers?
In many ways, general
descriptions can disguise more
than reveal what a program
really is. We need to know by
what criteria these choices will
be made. Creating criteria will
require taking a political direc-
tion, and those criteria must be
developed so that the politics of
radical feminist education will
relate to the survival of us all.
