NEW MODEL OF LOVE

Society has long defined  
and imposed a clear-cut model  
of the expectations and roles  
between two persons who say  
"I love you." This established  
and time-tested model  
(i.e. marriage and the nuclear  
family) has served for centuries,  
but the present high  
divorce rate, the numerous  
teenage runaways, and the  
women's rights movement all  
attest that the old model  
for love does not function  
efficiently in today's social  

cultural realities. Real-  
ities such as the high  
geographic mobility, the dis-  
persing interests  

are now possible,  

and  

surely the usual  
relationship which requires  
stability, mutuality  
and emphasis on the  
pronoun "I." The old model mono-  
gamous primary relationship  
is restrictive, despite its  
advantages of security and  
comfort. It is far too easy  
to lose one's identity and  
interests and creativity,  
and eventually that magical  
spark of love which makes  
the restrictions and the  
sacrifice worthwhile.  

Many women have forsaken  
the old model of a permanent  
monogamous relationship in  
favor of serial monogamy —  
a series of intense, one-  
to-one relationships. Others  
have refused to be drawn  
into an intense relationship  
with one person and develop  
instead a group of persons  
to whom they feel close and  
involved, a non-monogamous  
non-primary model. Each model,  
it seems to this writer,  
has serious weaknesses and  
lacks much as a way of life  
to be comfortable with for  
a long period of time.  

Any form of relationship  
must be able to cope with  
basic interaction problems,  
such as: dependency which  
interferes with self-esteem  
and initiative; doing every-  
thing together which encour-  
ages giving up activities  
that the other isn't inter-  
ested in and not meeting  
the need for "alone time;"  

losing the sense of self;  
viewing the other person  
as a possession with the  
resultant jealousy. Relation-  

ships are traditionally expected  
to fulfill all of one's  
needs and this is perhaps  

the greatest weakness of the  
permanent monogamous model.  

The monogamous model and  
the serial monogamous model  
for love both encourage depen-  
dency, possessiveness, jealousy  
and suffocation of individual  
growth and of self-initiative.  
The non-monogamous non-primary  
relationship model develops  
self-initiative but makes  
it difficult to meet intense  
emotional needs and is in  
some ways a defense against  

the vulnerability of opening  
up to another.  

The new model which more  
nearly nurtures that essence  
of love and adequately  
deals with the basic problems  
has not yet been tested by  
time. But we are forced into  
experimenting and creating  
by the pressures of today's  
realities. It would seem  
that a synthesis of serial  
monogamy and the non-monog-  
amous non-primary relation-  
ship is a solution. The new  
model would have as its center  
a primary relationship - an  
intense one-to-one love rela-  
tionship - surrounded by  
a circle of close secondary  
relationships who supplement  
the missing aspects of the  
primary relationship.  

The amount of time and  
energy spent with the second-  

ary persons would vary with the  

degree to which the primary  
relationship is fulfilling  
the various needs of the  
couple. The degree of ful-  
fillment would never be 100%  
(since the couple would then  
just lock themselves in their  
home and never emerge again)  
and obviously if the degree  
of fulfillment were very low  
the couple would break up,  
but most relationships fall  
somewhere between those two  
extremes and fluctuate over  
time.  

To live this proposed  
model, the individuals must  
be willing to face problems,  
communicate their needs and  
feelings, and be willing  
to grow. The freedom in this  
model is threatening, but  
if the joys of growing, of  
exercising creativity and  
meeting new people are shared  
openly between the couple,  
then all things add to rather  
than subtract from the rela-  
tionship. The couple live  
closer to the hurt of split-  
ting up, because each day  
is a new decision, another  
affirmation of 'I want to  
live with you,' but this  
keeps a freshness to the rela-  
tionship which is lost in  

the old permanent monogamous  
model. There is fear that  

if one loves many persons,  

the meaning and intensity  

may be lost, but this does  

not seem to be the case. The  
object of the model is not  

to have sex with as many  
persons as possible, but rather  
to feel free to interact  
freely and warmly with others,  
to share and grow, and, if  
appropriate, include sexual  
sharing with another.  

This new model is not  
yet tested by centuries of  
experience, but the present  
divorce rate and the emphasis  
on individual identity and  
growth is forcing many to  
consider ways of relating  
intensely and sexually with  
one special person without  
suffocating and stagnating  
as so often happens in the  
traditional monogamous marri-  
age model. Implementing a  

non-monogamous primary rela-  

tionship surrounded by close  
secondary relationships re-  
quires great inner strength,  
inner security and very good  
communication between partners.  
The partners must support  
each other in their weakness  
and must celebrate together  
their strength and their  
growth. It is in this model  
that the greatest rewards may  
be found.

plored in struggle and joy in  
lesbian relationships by Nancy
