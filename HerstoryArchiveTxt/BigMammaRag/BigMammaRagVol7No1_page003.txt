Army Pains

Sisters:

Next week I will have completed my
three year obligation with the United
States Army: Super Pricks (24 Nov '78)
and am now awaiting a determination
from the Physical Evaluation Board
(PEB). On two occasions I have suf-
fered the ramifications of clear cut
malpractice and, being an active duty
service member, I have no legal re-
course (thank the Goddess for Con-
gressional Investigations - but still
they are not legal, only administra-
tive). First, 6 Jan. '78 in an eight
to twelve minute urological surgical
procedure, they managed to rupture a
disk in my lower back (L-5/S-1). Then
21 Sept '78, due to my back I fell
and injured my ankle and split my
eyelid; upon being examined in the
emergency room, I requested an X-ray
be taken of my ankle. This request
was denied. Three and a half weeks
later after constant pain and my com-
plaints unheeded, I was finally re-
ferred to podiatry where I was casted
immediately as I had torn a ligament.
There now is a possibility of perma-
nent damage to my ankle. These shall
be only several of many incidents
that I am documenting for a future
book United States Army: Super Pricks.

Moving on . . the reason I am
writing you all is that upon being
discharged I plan to relocate to the
Boulder/Denver area (some time after
the first of the year). I am interest
ed in learning how Big Mama Rag press
is set up and if you would be able to
include a ready and more than willing
to work sister into your collective.
I tried to get in touch with you, tel-
ephonically, while I was at Ft. Car-
son, Colorado Springs, for several
days at the end of October, but was
unsuccessful. (ed. note: BMR 46 not
known for its regular office hours
we hope to get regular hrs. set up
in January)

. . I am pleased to report that
while stationed in Germany through
our concerted efforts my sisters and
I were instrumental to the Fifth Army
establishing a Women's Advocacy Board
- dealing primarily with rape, ass-
ault and wife abuse. We also played
a part in convincing the US Army,
under the auspices of the University

of Maryland, to offer assertiveness
training for military women during
duty hours and at the army's expense.
Still we as military women are being
fucked over by the super pricks. Pol-
itically if we will organize a women's
network within the military our clout
could be used to realize some revolu-
tionary changes; the volunteer army
needs women to maintain its strength
quotas - the very means to political
power! Well, so much for Uncle Sam
and Aunt Samantha.

- In closing, I am looking for-
ward to hearing from you all. Thank
you sisters for any consideration
you are able to extend to me.

Women’s Priorities

Dear BMR and Clare Strawn,

My favorite part of Big Mama Rag
is your Struggle columns. I also
agree with Clare Strawn that we need
to develop a clear idea of what our
goals are and who we are fighting.

However, I sure wish someone would
write a struggle column describing
some strategies!

The only strategy that I could
find in Clare's column was that women
should align themselves with nation-
alist struggles. While it is import-
ant that we support these struggles,
it is imperative that we do not end
up "taking care" of, or trying to
get a "piece of the pie" of these
social changes. Women are oppressed
in a way that is unique to women.

Clare, you said that “many women's
political development has brought
them only as far as the feminist
community in the first place." There
is no political community where the
same could not be said for most of
its members.

It is very upsetting to me when a
woman puts her primary political
energy into struggling for someone
else, someone whose struggle is safe-
ly not her own. Who is active with
the Coors or J.P. Stevens boycotts
and never attends her own union's
meetings, who writes the local paper
or BMR in protest of South Africa's
atrocities yet, remains passive to
stories of abuse of women in a local
nursing home.

Perhaps you have more faith than
I do. I cannot see any strategy for
revolution in the US at this time.

I can only keep myself ready for it.

By struggling for or "creating wom-
en's space" and fighting for all
feminist reforms I can. Something
will happen to create an atmosphere
for revolution, of that I have faith.

In the meantime, some of these re-
forms will have, hopefully, developed
a history as a basic right for women
that will facilitate their inclusion
in the new social order, will have
made women's living situations a bit
more tolerable, and help develop the
organizational and confrontational
tactics to create feminist change.

This can only be done when women
make struggling against their own
oppression their first priority.

In Sisterhood,
Phyllis Rutherford
