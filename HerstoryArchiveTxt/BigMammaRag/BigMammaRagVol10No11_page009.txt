(Collective note: Reprinted

at the Independent and

Nuclear Free Pacific Confer-
ence in Suva, Fiji, recently,
Darlene Keju of the Micronesia
Support Committee talked about
the American nuclear testing
in the Marshall Islands. Peta
Joyce sent this report.

"Come choose your own para-
dise island," the advertise-
ment says. "Miles of golden
beaches untouched by human
foot, and the most beautiful
coral reefs in the world." The
tourist literature inviting
you to holiday in the Marshall
Islands conjures up all the
usual images of a Pacific Par-
adise, and indeed the Marshall
Islands are beautiful, but
danger lurks beneath the cry-
stal clear waters, lies wait-
ing on the sun-washed beaches.

Since 1946, over 180 atomic
and hydrogen bombs have been
detonated in the Pacific
region, by the United States,
Britain and France, and 66 of
those were in the Marshall
Islands. These tiny islands in
the North-West Pacific, admin-
istered by the United States
as a United Nations Trust
Territory since 1947, were the
first to experience nuclear
testing. In 1946, just six
months after the first atomic
bomb was dropped on Hiroshima,
United States Navy officials
chose Bikini Atoll as an
“ideal” testing site. Its
population of 167 people were
moved 125 miles east to unin-
habited Rongerik Atoll. Be-
cause the Americans told the
Bikinians that they would be
able to return to their island
when the tests were over, they
chose to go to Rongerik even
though it had meagre land
and lagoon resources compared
to Bikini. Meanwhile, two
atomic bombs about the size
of that dropped on Nagasaki,
Japan, were exploded at Bik-
ini, and the United States
Navy decided that Enewetak
Atoll would also be used for
testing. The 145 people who
lived on Enewetak were taken
to a much smaller atoll,
Ujelang, and testing contin-
ued on Bikini and Enewetak
Atolls for several years. In
1954 a series of tests in-
cluded "Bravo", a 15-megaton
hydrogen bomb blast, which
contaminated all the islands
east of Bikini with radio-
active fallout. Within hours
of the blast, a "gritty white
ash" began to fall. On
Rongelap the ash was two
inches deep, and by nightfall
the people began to experi-
ence severe vomiting and
diarrhoea. At no stage were
there any official warnings of
the test, nor any notifica-
tion of precautions to take.
More than 48 hours after
their exposure, 28 United
States Air Force and Army men
stationed at a weather moni-
toring station on Rongerik
were evacuated along with the
64 people on Rongelap. In all,
264 people were eventually
evacuated to the Kwajalein
Navy base. They experienced
the symptoms of severe rad-
iation exposure; itching and
burning skin, vomiting and
diarrhoea, skin burns and
loss of hair. A United
States Brookhaven National
Laboratory report stated that
"The habitation of these peo-
ple on the island will afford
most valuable ecological rad-
iation data on human beings.”
The United States concluded
its nuclear testing programme
in the Marshall Islands in
1958, but more was to come.
In 1959 Kwajalein was chosen
as the testing site for nu-
clear missiles...

Apart from the immediate
effects of nuclear testing,
the Marshall Islands people
have suffered in other ways.
The Bikinians, concerned
about the meagre resources
on Rongerik, made the first
of many requests to return
home just two months after
their arrival. Two years and
many hardships later, they
were moved to a temporary
camp for seven months before
being resettled on Kili, a
fertile island but with no
lagoon or safe anchorage. The
Bikinians, like other island-
ers who were hurriedly
resettled with little time
to establish housing and gar-
dens, and to make fishing
equipment, became dependent
on the infrequent and unre-
liable Trust Territory supply
ships. Many times people were
left for months without basic
supplies, having to eat the
copra which was their only
source of income.

With a long history of
protests and lawsuits behind
them, the Marshallese are
still fighting for adequate
compensation, or the return
of their ancestral lands, and
for the right to be treated
as equals in their own coun-
try. Some will never be able
to return home; a 1978
Northern Marshalls radiolog-
ical survey, forced by a law
suit in 1975 by the Bikinians,
reveals that "Bikini Island
could not be used by the peo-
ple of Bikini for at least the
next 30 years and possibly
the next 60 years". Meanwhile
the Bikinians are still
searching for a satisfactory
place to live.

There is one thing the Mar-
shallese cannot fight for;
their health. Four years after
their exposure to radioactive
fallout, the rate of still-
births and miscarriages among
Rongelap women rose to more
than twice the rate in unex-
posed Marshallese women.

There were problems on other
islands too; Minji Kel from
Utirik Atoll: "...Several of my
babies who were healthy at the
time they were born died be-
fore they were a year old...
Altogether I lost four babies.
My son Winton was born just
one year after the bomb, and
he has had two operations on
his throat for thyroid can-
cer." Nine years after their
exposure in 1954, the first
thyroid tumours began appear-
ing among the Rongelap people,
and there was a higher than
normal incidence of growth
retardation in the young. By
1966, 52% of the 29 children
who were under 10 years
in 1954 had developed thyroid
abnormalities. Furthermore,
the body levels of radioactiv-
ity of Rongelapese who were
not exposed in 1954, but who
had moved back to Rongelap
in 1957, were found to be the
same as those who were ex-
posed, which indicates the
level of contamination on the
island. In 1976, a medical
report showed that 69% of the
Rongelap children under 10
years old, and 35% of the
total population exposed in
1954, had developed thyroid
tumours. However, the people
of Utirik, whose original
exposure was less than one
twelfth of the Rongelap
Peoples', suddenly showed a
higher rate of thyroid can-
cer. A Brookhaven Laboratory
medical report pointed out
that the Rongelap children
received doses of radiation
high enough to kill many
body cells, whereas at lower
doses, as in the Utirik peo-
ple, "a greater number of
cells would be spared for
malignant transformation".
In 1978, 20 years after the
nuclear testing stopped, the
Department of Energy revealed
that 10 other islands (of
about 1600 people) were con-
taminated with radioactive
fallout.

Unlike most Marshallese,
who have never been told about
the effects of radiation on
themselves, their children,
or their environment, Darlene
Keju knows that the whole of
the Marshall Islands is
contaminated, because of the
health problems that her
people are experiencing. Two
years ago she returned from
her studies in Public Health
in Hawaii to investigate, and
found many problems never
before experienced in the
Islands. Apart from health
problems such as sores, tu-
mours, thyroid disorders,
stillbirths, miscarriages and
deformed babies, staple crops
such as arrowroot and bread-
fruit are dying out or are
difficult to grow. The women
told her that they had many
miscarriages at seven months,
or, if the baby was full term,
"something" was born; "...it's
moving, it's breathing, but
there are no eyes, there are no
arms, there is not even a body
there." The women call them
"little ones." Sometimes
the doctors won't even let
them see their babies. Darlene was born on Ebeye,
an indigenous labour camp for
Kwajalein workers and their
dependants. 8000 people live
on 66 acres of land, in sub-
standard housing, with no
recreational facilities except
for a basketball court and a
baseball field, and a poorly
equipped, maintained and
staffed hospital. There is one
Trust Territory and one vol-
unteer doctor. Nearby Kwajalein has a population of 3,000
Americans, with air-condi-
tioned housing, a high school,
tennis and handball courts,
swimming pools, parks, a golf
course, bowling alley, teen
club and free movies. There
are seven American-trained
doctors. On Ebeye Darlene
has to obtain a pass to get
to Kwajalein, and she was
forbidden entry once to see
her brother even though she
had obtained a pass. Marshall-
ese cannot shop for the
cheaper goods on Kwajalein,
nor send their children to
high school even though Ebeye
doesn't have one.

Darlene was seven years old
when she first experienced
a nuclear bomb. She was at a
birthday party, and the min-
ister who was just about to
bless the child and the food
when the bomb went off, told
them it was the end of the
world. The whole island
glowed orange and red as Dar-
lene ran home to find her
parents. She wanted to know
if they were going to heaven
or hell. Now, 23 years later,
Darlene has had one tumour
removed from her shoulder,
and still has three others in
her body.

The Americans still say that
the islands are "safe", and
that there are no problems
for those not directly affect-
ed by the radiation. Darlene
points out that these problems
occur all over the Marshall
Islands, including areas that
the Americans claim were not
contaminated. "So what does
this mean to a Marshallese?
Not only that some of our
bodies, some of our relatives,
some of our friends, have
gone, but also it means to us
that we are now dying out
slowly. We know that there is
no cure for us."

The Marshallese have limi-
ted health care; once a year
the Department of Energy
carries out a medical sur-
vey of the Islands. Those
needing treatment are sent to
Hawaii or the United States.
The doctors tell them "...
there is nothing wrong,
nothing to worry about, your
ticket is paid for, we have
a translator waiting for you,
have a good time on the main-
land." Darlene's statement is
backed up by Reuben Merliss,
an American doctor who visited
the Marshall Islands in 1980.
"The people...have no great
faith in these (Dept. of
Energy) physicians...I am
also impressed with the fail-
ure of the physicians to com-
municate findings and prog-
nosis to the people... These
basic rights of a patient
have been in a large part
ignored...I found very few
Marshallese who were ac-
quainted with the nature of
their pathology. I reject
firmly the thought that the
people were too primitive or
uneducated to absorb such
information, since I have
found this not to be true."
The Marshallese have made re-
peated requests for an inde-
pendent medical survey. In
1971 a Japanese medical team
was prevented by the Americans
from travelling to Rongelap
and Utirik because of "visa"
problems.

Although over 200 million
dollars have been spent on
"clean-up" operations, Dar-
lene believes that this is
not to make the islands
"safe" to live in, but so that
the Marshallese will return
to their own homes to provide
human data on the possible
effects of nuclear war. The
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory
study on Bikini stated that
"Bikini may be the only global source of data
on humans where intake via
ingestion is thought to con-
tribute the major fraction of
plutonium across the gut wall
after being incorporated into
biological systems."

Darlene is fighting for
awareness of the problems of
the Marshall Islanders, and
of other Pacific peoples.
“The time has come for Pacif-
ic Islanders to come together
and fight like hell. I'm tir-
ed of having outsiders coming
in and treating me like a
guinea pig ... of lawyers and
anthropologists representing
me ... It stinks, but they
do it because we give them the
power. Stop depending on
outsiders, they will screw
you like they have screwed
us. Sooner or later I will
disappear," says Darlene "and
in 20 or 30 years from now
the Tahitians will face the
same problems. We must learn
from each other." Meanwhile,
in 1981 the Marshall Islands
Government was approached
by the Japanese about the
possibility of using Bikini
Atoll to "store" nuclear
waste. The tourist agencies
are keen to continue the
exploitation; come pick your
own island ...

Marie-Therese Danielsson
confirms that there is already
an unusually high rate of
thyroid problems in Tahiti,
but there are no official
figures; the French stopped
all health statistics before
the bomb tests started, and
there has been no information
since. But she knows that
large numbers of Tahitians
are sent to France, Australia,
and New Zealand every year
for medical treatment. If
these problems are already
appearing in Tahiti, what
about the rest of the Pacif-
ic? As Darlene says, “If our
area of the ocean is pollut-
ed, the whole Pacific is pol-
luted."

The New Zealand National
Radiation Laboratory figures
show that New Zealand recei-
ved both tropospheric (highly
radioactive, short-lived
fission products in the low-
er atmosphere, including
iodine 131), and stratospher-
ic radioactive fallout (long-
term fission products in the
upper atmosphere, including
