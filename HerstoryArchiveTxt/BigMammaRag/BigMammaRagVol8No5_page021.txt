Books That Helped Us Understand Class Struggle

Constructive Criticism

Gracie Lyons  
Issues in Radical Therapy Collective  
$2.95/paper  

In Constructive Criticism, Gracie  
Lyons provides invaluable guidelines  
to an invaluable tool—criticism/  
self-criticism. She develops a skill  
that is at the heart of political  
growth, especially for groups of  
people working with internal process  
as well as external issues, whose  
goals are to combine revolutionary  
theory with a commitment to advancing  
the whole—the whole group, the whole  
organization, the whole working class.  

The principles of constructive  
criticism are based on dialectics:  
that 1) everything changes; 2) change  
is caused by contradictions; 3)  
change is not smooth or steady; 4)  
everything is connected. The purpose  
is to separate right ideas from wrong  
ideas, not to separate one person  
from the other. And through her  
step-by-step instructions (teaching  
how to 1) be concrete, 2) describe  
feelings, 3) state wants, 4) explain  
purpose, 5) paraphrase, and 6) pre-  
vent and handle defensiveness), Lyons  
shows what it means to do criticism  
with good intentions; that is, to  
protect and educate to strengthen all  
of us for class struggle.  

She also provides concrete means  
to examine the class origin of feel-  
ings, to help identify the thought or  
value behind a feeling. While she  
says that the denial of feeling plays  
into the exploitive power imbalances  
in relationships, she emphasizes that  
we must take those feelings somewhere.  
We must recognize, arouse, and col-  
lectivize the emotions of people  
through political channels without  
using bribery or guilt-tripping, but  
by educating people to see how change  
will benefit the whole.  

Lyons also points out that the pro-  

cess of criticism takes equal partic-  
ipation, and that at some points, it  
is wise to decide that a basis of  
unity between people/groups is not  
strong enough to make it worth the  
struggle. This is fundamentally dif-  
ferent than the avoidance of conflict  
("sisterhood" at all costs) that plun-  
ges individuals and groups into lib-  
eralism.  

The thrust of Constructive Crit-  
icism is to strengthen ourselves for  
class struggle, to identify what is  
and what is not in the best interests  
of the working class. When applied  
to feminist organizing, Lyons' model  
helps women to define struggles in  
terms of class; and it also leads us  
to define our unity as feminists, as  
women who are to work primarily with  
other women.  

Constructive Criticism is written  
clearly and well-illustrated with ex-  
amples. The process Lyons explains  
is not an easy one to "live"—she  
admits to years of struggling with it  
herself. But, making it work for  
ourselves is an important goal that  
not only changes our lives and per-  
ceptions (this is not a therapy pro-  
cess that preserves the individual  
solution), but also can alter the  
face of our movement as we seek to  
strengthen our politics and our  
process.

Second Class, Working Class is an  
anthology of 30 short articles on  
international women's struggles in  
both Third World and industrialized  
nations. The articles and/or the  
information for them have been taken  

from European press. The editors  
wanted to provide information on  
women... unattainable elsewhere in  
English" and felt it was important  
"to be informed on how working women  
in other countries deal with their  
conflicts and problems." (Quote from  
the book's preface.)  

The booklet is divided into three  
sections: Women changing the face  
of the Left—political parties and  
unions, Strikes and resistance, and  
The other side of unemployment:  
prostitution, discrimination, and re-  
productive rights. Each section has  
a short introduction which gives a  
general overview of the articles in  
that section and points out some of  
the similarities and differences  
between women's struggles in specific  
industrialized nations and Third  
World nations, as well as in both  
pre- and post-revolutionary cultures.  

The booklet deals with issues such  
as birth control, abortion, childcare,  
prostitution, women's roles in the  
left and unions, job equality, educa-  
tion, household work, sexual stereo-  
typing, religious oppression, and  
women as a man's property. The book-  
let does not deal with other inter-  
nationally important issues such as  
lesbianism, genital mutilation, forced  

sterilization, or rape.  

Although some of the articles seem  
too short and leave the reader want-  
ing more information, each of the  
articles includes the sources of the  
information (Much of the informat-  
ion is not available in English.)  

While most of the articles are  
good and thought-provoking, other  
articles lack a clear analysis,  
particularly an interview with  
Carmen Castillo, a member of the  
Movement of the Revolutionary Left  
(MIR) in Chile. In the interview  
Castillo says that Beatrix Allende's  
(activist daughter of Salvador  
Allende) suicide was a political  
act resulting from her inability to  
reconcile her roles as a militant  
and a woman. “The split in two  
finally made her crack... So she had  
to die when she became a woman. It  
(her suicide) is the final action of  
a militant destroyed in her condition  
as a woman."  

Second Class, Working Class is a  
valuable source of information for  
political women. Its weaknesses  
are ones of omission rather than of  
commission—areas not covered or lack  
of enough information to draw a clear  
analysis. As the editors say in the  
preface, the booklet does demonstrate  
that “as much as women might start out  
with different ideas, they ultimately  
find themselves fighting against the  
same oppression and for the same  
rights."  

Lessons From The Damned  

The Damned  
Times Change Press  
$3.25/paper  

Lessons From The Damned is a pri-  
mer on the subject of class struggle  
in the black community. It details  
through numerous short to medium-  
length essays, by community members,  
their struggle against petit bour-  
geoise values and goals.  

Stating that "The traditional left  
turned us off... (because they do) not  
want to break down the big issues in-  
to the smaller issues of daily life,  
inside the families of workers and  
the poor. They call themselves  
Marxists, yet they contradict it by  
forcing a separation between inner  
life and outer life, or what they  
call personal and political." (sen-  
timents that most feminists would  
probably agree with) they endeavor  
to inspect many aspects of their  
personal feeling and their community  
life from a political perspective.  

Referring to upwardly mobile mem-  
bers of their community as "strivers,"  
they analyze these people's goals and  
actions—making determinations as to  
whose interests these people are  
actually serving.  

In readable style and language,  
they detail struggles and their be-  
lief in the importance of struggle.  
They tell us of their feelings and  
conflicts. They examine themselves  
and the society at large. In these  
areas the book is extremely good.  

The book, however, is far from  
perfect. Published in 1973, it is

Hidden Injuries Of Class  

Richard Sennett & Jonathan Cobb  
Vintage Book/Random House  
$2.45/paper  

This book examines, through con-  
versations, how working class men  
view themselves in relation to their  
jobs, families, and the attitudes of  
society that have isolated them, and,  
as the title says, have injured them.  

The book speaks directly of work-  
ing class men only, which is a huge  
drawback, but for the single parent  
who is a woman, some of the same  
pressures and feelings apply when it  
comes to providing for the kids. A  
woman co-worker, Claire Stiegelbaum,  
has written a companion volume deal-  
ing with first-hand experiences of  
working-class women but its title or  
publisher is not given.  

Both writers are college-educated,  

and the book is a we/them situation  
with the authors acknowledging (and  
at times, apologizing) for the con-  
descending attitudes.  

There are times when you have to  

push through this book. It often is  
repetitious and very dull. It is so  
male-oriented that at times I put it  
down, wanting much more to read of  
working class women's feelings, but  
it is still a very helpful book if  
you stick with it. The book does  
help working-class people identify  
feelings that many probably felt  
only happen to them, when, in real-  
ity, it is society's class attitudes.
