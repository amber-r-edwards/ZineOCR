The Impossible Mutation Or Why  

Cypress  

(Author's Note: This arti-  
cle was originally intended  
to be a literary review of a  
book I was so moved by, I  
felt compelled to write some-  
thing. But what came out was  
not a critique of the book  
Sitt Marie-Rose by Etel Adnan  
(Post Apollo Press), for I  
felt the book to be flawless,  
and there was nothing I  
wished to criticize. What  
came out was a personal  
statement on why I no longer  
call myself a Zionist.)  

Why would a Jewish woman  
from a working-class Yiddish  
culture of New York City be  
so moved by this book? A  

mid-east  

woman who was raised with the  
belief that Zionism is the  
only hope for Jews, and in  
order to avoid another holo-  
caust, Jews must have their  
own state. A woman who lived  
two years in Israel, who saw  
the horrible changes of the  
1967 war, yet still has lit-  
tle understanding of who the  
Palestinian people were and  
where they had been living  
before 1948. What were the  
steps, what were the progres-  
sions that led to the disso-  
lution of the "Beautiful"  
Lie? What rivers washed clean  
the layers of Zionist brain-  
washing and left in its place  
the clear and purifying wat-  
ers of the Truth. What led  
to this overpowering yearning  
for Yiddish and Arab cultures  
to come together in under-  
standing as the morning star  
on the horizon of the Middle  
East, arising anew like the  
phoenix from the ashes of all  
those who died unwilling vic-  
tims of those seeking to im-  
pose their own Culture, a  
Death Culture. What led to  
"the impossible mutation" as  
Sitt Marie-Rose's captors de-  
scribed her "defection" to  
the Palestinian Resistance?  
Those two years I spent in  
Israel in the sixties were a  
beginning. Not so much in un-  
derstanding the land ripoff  
of the Palestinian people,  
for that was hushed up and  
kept underground. We found  
ourselves face to face with  
so many sad survivors of the  
holocaust, while at the same  
time being flooded with Zion-  
ist ideology. No, what I re-  
ally learned well in those  
two years was the racist way  
non-European Jews were treat-  
ed by the European majority.  
I had been living in Paris,  
so when I arrived in Israel,  
and I didn't know Hebrew, I  

continued speaking French  

and the people who speak  
French in Israel are the Mor-  
occan Jews. I saw how poorly  
they were treated compared to  
the European Jews who got  

good jobs and nice apartments.  
So my first lessons occurred  
in the rundown shacks of  
Beersheva where thousands of  
Moroccan Jews lived, duped by  
Zionist agents who came to  
them in Morocco promising a  
land of milk and honey, but  
when they finally arrived en  
masse, the milk had turned  
sour and in place of honey  

was vinegar. And so the ra-  
cism in Israel toward Arab  
Jews immediately became appar-  
ent, almost as soon as I step-  
ped off the plane and passion-  
ately kissed the Earth, for  
that is what I was raised to  
do.  

Because I was a flower  
child of the sixties, I  
couldn't get behind war and  
military preparedness, and I  
wanted to love my neighbor  
which is what Judaism is sup-  
posed to be about. Needless  
to say I soon clashed with the  
Israeli authorities and later  
the university authorities,  
and after seeing the treatment  
of Palestinians in the newly  
occupied territories, I left  
Israel never wanting to go  
back. The Zionist dream I was  
raised with half dead in me.  

In 1969 when the Vietnam  
anti-war movement was at its  
height, I came back to the  
states and quickly became edu-  
cated as to what imperialism  
was, and more immediate, what  
was police brutality towards  
dissenters. After People's  
Park where women were raped,  
feminism came to me like the  
newly burst buds of the  
spring trees, and the whole  
issue of Zionism and being  
Jewish took a back seat to  
the exalting process of lib-  
eration from male thought  
and domination. Everything  
and anything was possible--  
one could dance, sing, write,  
act, dream, love and above  
all be political, for sister-  
hood was powerful.  

But alas came the cooling  
off period, for not only was  
sisterhood powerful, it was  
also proving to be plagued  
with racism, anti-semitism,  
classism and ageism, to name  
a few isms. And so women of  
color sought out and found  
each other, and Jewish women  
sought out and found each  
other, and oh so much warmth,  
caring and understanding for  
awhile, but this was not to  
last, could not last, for we  
were living under the "Beau-  
tiful" Lie, and that "Beau-  
tiful" Lie was Zionism.  

In the late 70's we see

hypocrite Carter cut off di-  
rect weapons sales to human  
rights violators, esp. in  
Central and S. America. And  
we see the Israeli government  
moving in to do the U.S.'s  
dirty work for it, in fact  
becoming a major weapons man-  
ufacturer employing over 300,  
000 Israelis, through its  
weapons sales to Somoza's  
Nicaragua and the military  
juntas of Argentina, Guate-  
mala and El Salvador. The  
heroic people's struggle in  
these countries touched our  
hearts, yet we made a clear  
distinction between the  
Guatemalan and Salvadoran  
guerilla fighters and the  
PLO. And there too is Israel  
selling weapons and becoming  
a nuclear partner to apart-  
heid South Africa and in its  
own "occupied territories"  
using these same weapons for  
export against any and all  
resisters, while moving in  
new settlers to armed camps  
encircling ancient Palestinian  
villages. Many of these new  
settlers are American Jews.  

Well, this was all bad en-  
ough, horrendous in fact, yet  
those layers of brainwashing  

were so deep, that I still  

called myself a Zionist and  
I still thought of Israel  
with a certain tenderness I  
reserved for no other coun-  
try. But when we had our  
first Jewish Feminist Con-  
ference in San Francisco,  
and over 1000 women attend-  
ed, the dominant mood of  
the conference was that an-  
ti-zionism equals anti-  
semitism and to criticize  
Israel was anti-semitic, I  
then knew something was  
terribly wrong with our  
Jewish women's movement,  
and I came away very frust-  
rated, not knowing what to  
do next.  

The most tragic events  
decided for me. It must have  
been less than a week after  
the conference that Israel  
invaded Lebanon and the  
whole world seemed to fall  
apart. The bombings never  
stopped, the amputations  
never stopped, and finally  
the massacres. The murder  
never seemed to stop, and  
some of us in the Bay Area  
felt this enormous pain al-  
most as if we were in Leb-  
anon. And we marched here
