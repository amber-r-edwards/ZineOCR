Until recently, the sub-
ject of women in Latin Ameri-
ca has not been considered
interesting enough to get
much space in Latin American
history books. Female names
in the text more often refer
to ships or islands than to
women.

Since the days of Spanish
colonization, Latin American
society has respected women
with great honor as spiri-
tually strong, self-denying,
and long suffering, the hol-
ders of morality. The ex-
tremely powerful Catholic
Church has played a consis-
tent historic role in rein-
forcing the strength of this
ideology by teaching that
women's God-given role is to
be the mainstay of the fami-
ly--an ever-nurturing mother
and an obedient wife.

The especially virulent
brand of sexism--machismo--
that is so deeply embedded
in Latin cultures further
rigidifies sex roles for
both men and women. Extreme
forms of superior, aggressive
and authoritarian behavior
by men are not only tol-
erated but admired. For wo-

Saysose Paname

men, machismo means accept-
ing their inferior lot with
self-effacing patience, com-
pensated for by moral super-
iority.

The effect of this has
been to severely constrain
the lives of women as com-
pared to men. Most are un-
trained and unable to get
work, thereby strengthening
their economic dependence on
men. They are usually not

even independent in making
decisions about what is sup-
posed to be their own sphere,
the home. Thus, for example,
women of poorer classes, who
want to attend a community
meeting on health services,
water problems, etc. must
often first ask permission
from their husbands. And
despite the supposed respect
of women's spirit, wife
abuse and rape are common.

On August 11, Edward Souza
Rocha, a 34-year-old Belo

Horizonte (Brazil) land-
scape architect, killed his
30-year-old wife while she was
dressing one afternoon. Com-
plaining that his wife
smoked, drove about the city
without a chaperone, was not
around to welcome him when he
returned home from work and
watched television shows
that displayed people "kiss-
ing passionately." Rocha
said he murdered his wife in
an unthinking moment when
she said she wanted to leave
him for another man. In an-
other case, a wealthy con-
tractor was absolved after
he killed his wife, Jo, when
she attempted to leave him
for another man.

According to a Rio de Ja-
neiro lawyer, the macho men-
tality in Brazil allows a
man everything, but punishes
a woman who does not agree
to total submission to her
husband. If women decided
to kill all husbands who
were unfaithful, commented
a Rio de Janeiro sociologist,
it would probably mean the
end of the species.

Regardless of a woman's
class, her life is circum-
scribed by virtue of being
female. The legal structures
in most Latin American coun-
tries strictly buttress the
status quo of women's role,
leaving them very few mech-

men.

iven’ Roles: The

anisms of control over their
lives.

Birth Control

A woman's right to control
her own fertility is perhaps
the most important element
in her life. Being unable
to prevent, schedule or ter-
minate pregnancy means that
she is captive to the cycles
of procreation. Her lack of
control over this most per-
sonal of decisions reflects
the bondage of women to their
primary social role as re-
producers.

Women's reproduction has
been used as a political
football by all persuasions
in Latin America. The left
has often equated all birth
control programs with imper-
ialist control and abuse.
The right usually relies on
a pro-natalist position, in-
cluding smatterings of moral-
ism such as the opinion that
the pill leads to sexual pro-
miscuity for women and there-
fore the disintegration of
the family. Both fall back
easily on the nationalistic
rhetoric: “Honduras needs
more Hondurans. Honduran
women--Don't ruin your health
participating in the Birth
Control Program. It is a
gringo trick to depopulate
our beloved country in favor
of the Salvadorans.

But the fact that women's
lives are at stake is not
really at issue. Rather
women are simply encouraged
to fulfill their primary
function of populating their
countries and are denied the
freedom to choose. Their
bodies are essentially mani-
pulated for political ends.

This does not deny that
the legacy of population
control programs, generally
instituted by international
or U.S. agencies, in cooper-
ation with local governments
is dismal. They have been
just what the name implies,
programs to control popula-
tions. Their clinics have
gained a sordid reputation
for testing and marketing
unsafe contraceptives and
forcing sterilizations on
poor women who have no other
options besides these public
facilities.

The most common forms of
prescribed birth control are
the pill and IUDs. Dalcon
Shields were distributed by
AID to third world countries

through agencies like Plan-
ned Parenthood, despite
knowledge of their dangers,
until they were banned in
the United States in 1974.
AID still uses its channels
to dump high estrogen con-
tent birth control pills for
drug companies that have
found their U.S. market re-
duced. And depo-provera, an
injectable contraceptive,
known to cause myriad harm-
ful side effects, including
cancer, can be bought over
the counter in Central Ameri-
ca and parts of the Caribbean.

The methods by which birth
control is dispensed not only
ignore the critical social
factors, but do not encour-
age the women to take con-
trol over their lives. Cur-
rently in Mexico, for ex-
ample, the government is
strongly advocating family
planning; television com-
mercials show men talking
about how "we" are trying to
control births. This is fur-
ther underscored in the cli-
nics, where women are com-
monly asked if they are mar-
ried and if their husbands
approve.

Marriage and Divorce

In Chile, Ecuador, and El
Salvador, the husband owes
protection, and the wife
obedience. Until 1975 in
Mexico, it was the wife's
legal obligation to take
care of the home.

Divorce is rare in Latin
America. In those countries
that permit it at all, di-
vorce is typically costly
and thus available only to
the rich, while the poor re-
sort to separation. Divorce
is illegal in Brazil and
Colombia, and allowed only
under exceptional circum-
stances in Argentina. In
Chile, only annulment can
break the marital bond. In
all other countries, the
basis for divorce differs
for men and women.

For example, adultery is
grounds for divorce in most
countries that permit di-
vorce, but nowhere is the
hypocritical double standard
of morality more flagrantly
applied. Frequently the
husband's activities must be
associated with concubinage
(a woman living with a man
without marriage bonds), public
scandal or desertion, where-
as for women, adultery is

adultery no matter the cir-
cumstances.

Abortion
Abortion is illegal
throughout Latin America,
and the Catholic Church re-
presents a powerful impedi-
ment to all attempts at
changing the situation. In
Mexico, for example, it has
flagrantly propagandized and
terrorized its constituents
by lining its churches with
photographs of dead fetuses.
The church has also shown
its strength by organizing

“Robyn Conway/Broadsheet

sizeable counter-demonstra-
tions to pro-abortion ral-
lies on short notice.

The legislators, like rabid
dogs, fight over legis-
lation on abortion. Once
more, they want to use our
bodies, to decide about them.
They make me laugh; the whole
thing is so absurd, like
everything else that happens
in this country. Our child-
ren can hardly breathe since
the air is so polluted. Co-
lombian children die of hun-
ger in the streets every
day. They make me laugh.
What kind of life are they
defending?

Despite this psychological
warfare, women in Latin
America continue to seek ab-
ortions in massive numbers.
While exact figures are ob-
viously unobtainable, the
yearly estimate in Mexico
is 800,000, in Colombia it
is 280,000--a figure indica-
ting that one in five preg-
nancies is terminated by
abortion. In Argentina the

figure is one in four.

Legally, governments
throughout Latin America
have the power to inflict
strict penalties on both
abortionists and those who
abort. In Colombia, a wo-
man can get from one to four
years in prison; in Mexico
from one to five. But in
both cases, societal morali-
ty intervenes in a discrimi-
natory fashion. Colombian
law states that when an
abortion has been induced to
save one's honor or the hon-
or of a member of the family
the sentence can be reduced
or pardon granted. In this
case then, a man has the
right to impose an abortion
on a woman, even against her
will, in order to save his
good name and that of the
family.

The conditions under which
abortions are performed are
far from safe. In Colombia,
54% were done by abortion-
ists, 15% by nurses, 3% by
midwives, 2% by druggists,

Movement In Latin America

4% by doctors, 8% by the wo-
men themselves and 13% by
other means. It is not sur-
prising that 54% of all ma-
ternal deaths are attributed
to abortion complications.
For Latin America as a whole,
30% to 50% of all maternal
deaths result from improperly
performed abortions.

Women and Work:
Stereotype Going

The social attitude toward
married women or women with
children working outside the
home has not changed much
despite the increased number
of employed women. It is
viewed as a negative reflec-
tion on the man's ability to
fill his role as provider.
In many countries, a husband
may challenge his wife's
right to work in court, on
the grounds that household
responsibilities are being
ignored. Although rarely
enforced, they are a formal
indication of the power rela-
tions in the family.

Keeping the

The Maquila Women: Global Assembly Lines

The exception to women's
marginal role in industrial
production is the recent phe-
nomenon of the "global as-
sembly line." Multinational
industries such as electron-
ics and apparel, in which
the production process has
been broken down into dis-
crete operations, have trans-
ferred the most labor-inten-
sive, low-skill procedures
to the third world in order
to take advantage of cheaper
labor costs. The prolifera-
tion of export-based manu-
facturing has been bolstered
by changes in U.S. tariff re-
gulations, and attractive in-
vestment incentives offered
by the host countries, which
may include tax breaks, in-
vestment credits and even the
guarantee of non-unionized
labor.

While havens for multina-
tional investment exist in
countries like the Dominican
Republic, El Salvador and
others, the most extreme ex-
ample of this kind of pro-
duction is on the Mexican-
American border, where hun-
dreds of foreign firms--"ma-
quiladoras” (Maquilas are as-
sembly plants which are
either directly-owned subsi-
diaries or sub-contracting
firms of U.S. based transna-
tional corporations.)--are
now in operation.

The Maquiladora work force
is 75% female. These indus-
tries provide the most bla-
tant illustration of the ways
in which gender socialization
(sex roles) is exploited by
capitalist enterprise. The
mythology that women are the
most suitable for the repe-
titive, detailed tasks of
sewing, or the minute assem-
bly of semi-conductors, is
widely espoused. However,
it is not "female" dexterity
that is at issue, but rather
the docility and submissive-
ness into which women have
been conditioned. This so-
cialization, combined with a
lack of working experience,
means that women are less
likely to organize or make
demands. As one personnel
manager explained, not only
are they cheaper, but "Girls
are educated to obey at home.
It is easier to get their
confidence. They are loyal
to the company. It is not
so with the men."

A combination of other ele-
ments adds to women's passi-
vity. The lack of other em-
ployment opportunities in the
area makes women--especially

Big Mama Rag, April, 1981

single heads of household--
more vulnerable to loss of
job security. Also, despite
the terrible working condi-
tions, these jobs are gener-
ally the best paying availa-
ble. Furthermore, the no-
tion that women's income is
secondary, even when it is
not patently true, makes it
easier to pay women less than
men. Finally, women are a
more flexible work force.

If in response to market
fluctuations (prevalent in
these industries), massive
layoffs are called for, the
social disruption from firing
women will be less than if
they were men.

The following info, from
an illustrative study on
the social impact of maquila-
doras on women workers was
conducted by Patricia Fer-
nandez Kelly, a social an-
thropologist. Patricia lived
with maquila workers in Cui-
dad Juarez for six months,
carrying out extensive inter-
views.

After she was deserted by
her husband of only two
years, Rosario went to live
with her mother Mariana. Her
young brother, Gerardo, and
