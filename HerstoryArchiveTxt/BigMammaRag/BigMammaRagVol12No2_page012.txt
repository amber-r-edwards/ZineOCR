The Sense Of Urgency, To Pour It All

Published anonymously at
author's request

author's note: This article
was written (dare I clarify
it to "capture on paper")
during one intense sleepless

night. The psychiatrists
would probably call this a
"psychotic episode". I was
close to committing suicide;
I picked up a pen instead.

I have not added anything
later. I did edit somewhat,
and correct the spelling.
The most intense moments oc-
curred when I was "spaced
out"--they are lost forever.

I am extremely embarrassed
by parts of this, but I must
leave it intact as it was
originally written. I share
this because of my desire to
destroy the psychiatric sys-
tem. We must learn to talk
to each other, to be honest
with each other, instead of
running to the professionals.
If this frightens you, be
honest about it. This is
dedicated to mad women
everywhere.

I would be locked up in a
second if they heard me now,
or saw me even--I look a
mess; my clothes have not
been changed for days, my
hair is unbrushed, I haven't
been sleeping. Since I first
started writing I haven't
been able to stop really.
The sense of urgency, to

pour it all out at once felt

uncontrollable. I've only
just realized it is uncon-
trollable and so am I.

Something is about to hap-
pen. That is my reality now-
my only reality. I feel that
it is external. They--gover-
nment, family, psychiatry
or police--are about to do
something awful. I can't
tell whether it's to be at me
only, or not. And I'm aware
it may be only inside. The
voices inside me are growing
louder. They are not merely
"hallucinations" though,
please try to understand
this. I feel all the cells
in my body. It is as if all
my senses are activated. Not
only sight, smell, touch,
taste, whatever else we
learn, but other senses that
have no name, as yet. I feel
in strong communication with
Karen Silkwood; there are no
words, only feelings.

I am having to fight very
hard to not go away inside
me. That could be what's go-
ing on too, the sense of ur-
gency. They would label it

madness.

Many
schizophrenics speak the
truth. Listen to what they
say. There is also a lot of
what we would consider "gar-
bage" talk. It's meaningless
to those not on that level
of intensity, it doesn't
seem to make any sense. They,
themselves (We, ourselves)
may not be able to ever ex-
plain or understand it eith-
er. It doesn't really matter.
Between that which is un-
decipherable, is a lot of
truth.

I now feel heavy sadness,
I can barely hold the pen.
I feel that I am collapsing
inside. I feel my cells
shrinking, my bones dissolv-
ing. I am dying from the
inside out. I space out
easily on the silence of
the world. Then I hear and
I'm frightened. Are they
here to get me? I meant to
say "hear a car" and I did-
n't. It makes more sense to
me to leave it out anyway.
Can you understand that? I
ask you that and I'm laugh-
ing. "Crazy" people laugh
a lot, usually at "inappro-
priate" times. That word
"affect" has something to do
with it all too but I can't
quite grasp that at the mom-
ent. I used to know it. It
doesn't matter, it's their
word anyway. I return your
word to you on a silver
platter Doctor. Lift the lid,
it is cut into a million
pieces. There is blood every-
where. It stains your hands,

it squirts into your eyes.
I am laughing because I see
your fear. I have full pow-
er, full control. Not in
the way we come to know,
that but inside of me, in-
side my head I have full
control. Except externally
I have no control. I cannot
control my behavior, my ac-
tions, what I say. But in-
side my head I do. I shake
my head in despair because
I know you probably can't
understand that. Oh well,
now I laugh again. I laugh
at your bewilderment. I know
what I am saying. It doesn’t
matter that you don't. It's
all very funny, can you see
that? Probably not, oh
well...

Sorry, I spaced out for

a while there again. I came
back to tell you something.
I am now so full of rage, I
could kill. I could murder.
Yes, in cold blood. My story
before, about the word. (I
pause to point out that were
I actually talking to peo-
ple, I would have no sense
who I had told before about
this. I would assume that
whoever I was now talking to
was the person I talked to
before). About the word,
what I meant by that. The
psychiatrists--all of them,
all therapists--any one of
them. That word “affect" or
any other it doesn't matter.

It was cut into a million
little pieces to represent
the million little people
that you destroy. To rep-
resent the million little
pieces who you make me be-
come, in order to put me
back together again. Doctor
dear, dear doctor (you have
to do that in sing-song) I
hate to tell you this, but
you never put those pieces
back together RIGHT.

I had to stop and hide the
rest of the article. I don't
feel impending doom. It
would be easiest to say a
voice told me to. But it's
not that actually. It's my
own voice, it's an internal
discussion, but it's not the
"me" that we come to learn
about. It's not the "me" that
I know. It's internally external. Oh
well I can only laugh again
at your bewilderment. It
doesn't matter.

The least you can do dear
therapist/doctor is to num-
ber the pieces as you go. Or
do a dot to dot system. That
way you'd know where all my
parts went when you put me
back together. I could easi-
ly start drawing dots all
over myself, or writing num-

bers. My only reason not to
is 'cause I have to keep writ-
ing. But I'm doing the num-
bers in my head and I would
physically be doing it were
I just sitting around. It
would look like I was doing
a very "crazy" thing. But
indeed it would be the abso-
lute most logical thing in
the whole wide world. Now
you know that. I laugh again
("hysterically") because--
before I finish my sentence
I must tell you this. I am
furious that I put that "H"
in the corner. (note: I was
numbering my handwritten
pages as I went) Why the

hell do I still know the
alphabet? Well yes so I can
still write, but no, I don't
want to know the proper or-
der it goes in. You taught
me that alphabet (you being
anyone I was talking to; I'd
be convinced it was you who
had done it) You taught me
too many evil things. How
can I trust anything you
say? You taught me that
Starvation is a part of life
in the big city. It's no-
body's fault. That people
starve to DEATH, and you sit
here eating 2 pieces of cake.
(I would joke and laugh
about jelly beans now too,
referring to R. Reagan) You
taught me about starvation/
it can't be helped, you also
taught me this silly alpha-
bet. I see your lies. I don't
want your damned alphabet.

Right now, in the middle of
anything I was doing, what-
ever I or you were saying--
this whole dialogue would
have probably gone on inside
me--I would jump up and try
to destroy anything connect-
ed to an alphabet. I could
easily become terrified of
the alphabet, "phobic" if
you will. I would lose the
connection, which in this
situation is starvation and
