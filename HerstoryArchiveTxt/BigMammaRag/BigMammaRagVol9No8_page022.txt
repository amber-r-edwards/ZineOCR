New Wave Music

referring to men whose music
has grown out of the streets
of working class England,
men like Joe Strummer and
Mick Jones of the Clash, and
the more “artsy" types like
Brian Eno and David Byrne of
Talking Heads, and the Irish
band Stiff Little Fingers.
Unlike most male pop musicians,
these men make music
from politics, and vice versa—
because, as Strummer says,
"There are enough love songs
in the world." Like the wom-
en's music I mentioned above,
the strength and raw-edged
energy of these political
groups appeals to me a lot.
They are not protected in a
left-wing ivory tower the
way many "activist" men I've
known are - their lyrics and
sounds come from real life
and a new sense of account-
ability.

Rise Of Fascism

little support to the Social
Democratic party who were
the only voice in pre-Nazi
government consistently
speaking out for women's
rights, gay rights and anti-
authoritarianism,

The most radical women's
groups were small, making
them extremely susceptible
to isolation. The ultimate
aim of the more radical
groups was a restructuring
of society in a liberal in-
dividualist model rather than
a socialist one. The women
of the suffrage union and
the Bund Für Mutterschutz,
for example, fought to se-
cure the self-determination
of the individual woman.
They argued that women
should have the same rights
as men, and also rejected
the patriarchal thinking
implicit in the state's con-
trol and interference in the
private morality of women.

The membership of the va-
ried groups belonging to the
BDF continued to shift far-
ther and farther toward the
right in ideology and in
practice after W.W.I. The
women tended to see their
struggles as issue specific.

For example, the concept of
equality for women was often
dismissed as being no more
than a leftist political
slogan.

Gertrud Baumer, president
of the BDF between the
years 1910-1919, excluded
women's groups from the BDF.

early punk and new wave is
rooted in rebellion, resis-
tance, and strong class con-
sciousness. In some cases,
the anger has gone askew
and been badly misdirected
(an example being the fatal
excesses of the Sex Pistols
and the resulting fatalism
of groups like Public Image
Ltd. and Joy Division); and
I can never reconcile the
self-indulgent, sado-masoch-
istic implications of some
punk/new wave lifestyles.
Except for an understanding
of how these implications
grow out of rebellion and
turn against the wrong
people, I have not yet work-
ed it all out. But, I strong-
ly believe that this mu-

sic is not "cock rock" -

nor is it inherently misogy-
nist or destructive. In-
stead, I am convinced that

this spirit was manifest in
motherhood which was the
essence of femininity. She
banned the publications of

of Schlafly. She also said
that "female sexuality finds

bear an eerie resemblance to

Schlafly's more recent assert-
ion that good women don't get

vocative ones who ask to be as-
saulted and raped. Baumer also

potential because it is an-
gry, accessible, and relevant.

For me, new wave picks up
where women's culture fails.
I will defend aspects of
political feminism (meaning
feminists who choose to
work politically with other
feminists) until my dying
day. But I am not satisfied
by cultural separatism (mean-
ing women choosing to live
their lives in a "bubble"
of isolation - doing every-
thing from worshipping a god-
dess to refusing to deal
with men on any level at all).
In fact, this kind of separa-
tism is a "phenomenon" that
seems dangerous because it
removes women from the real
world in which we can
effect more change for more
people.

Not only do we set up un-
real expectations of each
other to meet every need we
have - from political theory
to art and music - we become

agreed with the Nazis'
statement that the desire
for liberation was due to
a malfunction of the sex
glands.

Lack of organization, in-
adequate ideology, ineffect-
ive tactics and structure
and the overpowering force of
a society in the process of
going mad had completely si-
lenced the German women's
movement by 1929. The BDF was
dissolved by the Nazis on
the 15th of May 1933. The
BDF's magazine "Die Frau"
was permitted to continue
circulation and was even gi-
ven an extra ration of paper
by the Nazis. The magazine
eventually became an instru-
ment of propaganda for the
fascist state, refraining en-
tirely from political commen-
tary and focusing instead
on Christian, Aryan mysticism.

In conclusion, the roots
of fascism find very soil in

I fear, in silence, and in spi-

ritual homelessness.

I think that we must be on
the offensive against the
subtle "friendly" fascism of
Joe Coors, Alexander
Haig, and Jerry Falwell
who are all working very hard to
brainwash us into believing
that the right American way
to live is passively accept-
ing the voice of authority—
whether that be the grin-
ning face of Bonzo's pal
Raygun, the economic insen-
sitivity/insensibility of the
trickle down theory, the
Bible or the great all-Ameri-
can tradition of "free"

politically ineffective. We
deny the struggles all of us
are forced to confront as

we function out in the world.
Instead of reaching out for
all women, we close our-
selves off and become irrele-
vant.

In the last year, I have
integrated new wave music
into my life. As a working
class feminist, I am strong-
er and angrier than ever.

I have stopped apologizing
for the changes I am ex-
periencing and reflecting—
in my art and writing, my
lifestyle, my appearance,
and most of all my politics.
Feminism is more important
to me than ever because

I am truly functioning in
the real work-a-day world
every day of the week - and
I am reaching people I
might never have known if

I had remained a cultural
separatist. I hope to be
more effective.

enterprise.

The struggle against the
onslaught of the right wing
will be difficult, disheart-
ening and crazymaking. Being
on the offensive means diffe-
rent things to different
people, but perhaps the most
crucial lessons we can
learn from the herstory of
the German women's movement
are that 1) authoritarian
structures in the organiza-
tions we belong to can hin-
der rather than increase
political effectiveness and
2) the ideas, tactics, and
the lives that we develop
cannot be watered down in
the interests of diplomacy
3) We must continue to be
skeptical and struggle
against the lies of govern-
ment and corporate propa-
ganda. 4) We need to build
strong support systems for
each other and coalitions
so that the struggle against
the lies can be sustained
and strong
5) If white and non-Jewish,
one of our major struggles
must be that against the ra-
cist and anti-Semitic assump-
tions in our minds—assump-
tions which, because it is the
"easy" thing to do, manifest
themselves in our actions and our words
and all too often discount
the realities and the lives
of people of color and Jews.
