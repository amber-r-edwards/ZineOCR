Risher & Foreman

Lesbian Moth

Katherine Davenport

On December 23, 1975, a 10
man, 2 woman jury in Dallas,
Texas awarded custody of a 9
year old boy, Richard, to
Doug Risher because his ex-
wife, Mary Jo Risher, who had
custody of the child since their
1971 divorce, is a lesbian
living with another woman.
Mary Jo and Doug were
married for 14 years. Doug is
now remarried.

Ann Foreman's ex-husband,
Michael, and his wife both
testified that Ann and Mary Jo
provided a good home for the
children. Michael Foreman
testified that he had had his
daughter tested to make sure
that she was in no way badly
affected by her mother's
homosexual relationship with
Mary Jo, and he and the psy-
chologists were satisfied that
Judie Ann was growing nor-
mally and happily, and that it
was a good home.

The judge overruled a mo-
tion made by Mary Jo to keep
the issue of homosexuality,
and hence the sensationalism,
out of the trial. It was Doug
who had requested a jury trial
knowing that the jury would
likely be prejudiced against
Mary Jo's homosexuality. The
judge also allowed questions
about the sexual preference of
the jurors and the witnesses,
including the expert wit-
nesses.

The jurors stated that none
of them knew any homo-
sexuals or knew anything
about homosexuality. During
the trial, the Bible was fre-
quently cited by the attorney
for the father as a good source
for learning about homo-
sexuality.

The following interview with
Mary Jo Risher and Ann
Foreman was held on April
11th in Denver, Colorado:
BMR: Tell us something about
your backgrounds.

Foreman: I'm an assistant
auditor at a bank right now.
We're in the process of start-
ing a business, a painting
contracting business. I've
been a good mother, I've

Texas has never
heard a case on
lesbian rights or
homosexual rights
or a child custody
case.

taken care of the children
properly. My ex-husband sup-
ports us and realizes that we
are good parents, but Mary
Jo’s probably the one who has
the most fabulous background
for being a “perfect mother.”

Risher: Gee thanks! Well, I'll
start with being generally a
good mother, meeting all of
the needs of Richard, his
medical, physical, educational
and his emotional needs. To
me that’s the most important.
The background has been set
as far as his needs being met.
As far as strengthening myself
as a parent, I have, in the
past, been a Sunday school
teacher in the Baptist church
for junior girls, I am a train-
ing union teacher for junior
boys and girls, I am past
president of the Dallas County
Council of the PTA which is
made up of seven communi-
ties in Dallas County and is
made up of thirty-three
schools. I am past chaplain of
the Order of the Eastern Star
and my life has been centered
around strengthening myself

BMR: Under what conditions
would that happen?

Foreman: The State Supreme
Court could refuse to hear our
case which is a big possibility

as a parent. I have been on a
Dallas County Library board
and my sole function there
was to prepare summer activi-
ties for encouraging boys and
girls to use the library. My life
has pretty well been centered
around making things better
for the young boys and girls of
our community to live in.

BMR: How long have you
been members of NOW?

Risher: Ann and I have been
members of NOW ever since
September of '75. Actually,
when we were in discussion
with members of NOW about
our case we had not yet been
to one of their meetings nor
really even knew much about
their policies. When we were
invited to one of their meet-
ings to let the NOW members
know what Ann and I were
going to face in the court and
what the issue was going to
be, in meeting these women
we realized that it was an
organization that both Ann
and I felt we could identify
with and so at that time, after
the meeting, we discussed
whether we would be joining
and we did and we're NOW
members. And we're very
happy, not only because they
have generated their desire to
help us, but also, it has put
Ann and I in the position of
voting members so in case any
issue involving women comes
up we have an opportunity to
have a voice.

BMR: Where do you stand
now in terms of your appeal?

Foreman: Within 90 days
(from April 11th) we'll be in
the Civil Court of Appeals in
Dallas, Texas and from there
we'll go to the State Supreme
Court. If we lose on that level
we'll go on to the U.S.
Supreme Court. There is also
a possibility that we can by-
pass the State Supreme Court
and go directly into the U.S.
Supreme Court.

as Texas has never heard a
case on lesbian rights or
homosexual rights or a child
custody case. So there’s a big
chance we may not make it,
but we might because of all
the publicity that’s been gen-
erated.

BMR: If you do make it and it
goes on to the Supreme Court
what impact do you think this
will have for lesbian mothers
throughout the country?

Risher: We feel that on any
appeal level a precedent set-
ting situation is going to arise
and on the Civil Court of
Appeals level we do not look
for a reversal in the decision
but as it goes further up this
gives judges all over the
country an opportunity to cite
a certain case and in this case
it would be Risher vs. Risher
which involves a lesbian
mother who has lost her child.
We feel that if, indeed, judges
are able to cite this case and
you have other lesbian
mothers who are in a local
court and we still have not had
that decision reversed from
the local court and the deci-
sion hadn't been reversed by a
higher court judges can say
you're a lesbian mother and
Risher vs. Risher did not let
this woman, this lesbian wom-
an, keep her child. So Ann and
I feel that our home was good,
that our background should
stand for something and we
felt that we were lesbian
mothers, true, but we shouldn't
be put in a category — that
of being a lesbian per se and
us being judged as a group of
people. And that is what they
did when the decision came in
which left me with lack of due
process as an individual be-
cause they judged me as a
member of a group, that being
lesbian women.

BMR: There has been some
controversy within lesbian
communities over male child-
ren; have you had any feed-
back from separatists about
your case?

Foreman: No.

Risher: When Ann and I first
received the citation we called
some lawyers, not knowing
which one to call. One lawyer
that I talked to over the phone
asked if the child involved was
a boy or a girl, and I asked
why and he said, “There's a
big difference.” I said, “What
do you mean?” And he said,
“Well, if it is a boy your
chances are going to be better
in the courtroom to keep him.
If it's a girl it will be harder.”
And I said, “Why?” I didn’t
get any sympathy from him so
I never considered him again
but he did say that since there
were two lesbian women in the
home there was always the
possibility that my lover would
try to seduce my daughter or
even a mother try to seduce
her daughter. So he said that
we had a little better chance
since it’s a boy.

In talking with professional
people, psychologists and psy-
chiatrists we have learned and
been assured that this is mis-
information that people have
picked up on and passed on
from generation to generation

that these are things that
happen (which in essence
really do not happen). If
you're going to go into how
people will seduce young
children, child seducing rec-
ords will prove that most of
this is done by heterosexuals.

BMR: Have you been getting
any support from gay groups?

Foreman: We've had some
support from the Daughters of
Bilitis in Dallas and there are
several college gay groups in
the Texas area that have done
a lot. The Denton Gay Alliance
has done a considerable
amount for being a new or-
ganization. And the gay com-
munity in general, in the bars
and clubs and other places has
always been very supportive
and done as much as they can.
I'm sure it’s extremely hard
for the gay community to jump
out in the open whereas a
feminist can at that particular
point, because they [gay peo-
ple] have their own problems
and their own things to lose
over it.

Risher: I'd like to make a
comment on the gay commu-
nity. We have found that
Dallas is very sympathetic and
we can get the undertone that
they want to jump out and
help us but a lot of people
have to understand that this
is where the action is, and these
people are afraid. Sometimes
we might even get the idea
that they're afraid of us for the
simple reason that we're
known lesbians now. And if
we're seen in public anyone
seen with us can also be
labeled a lesbian even if it’s
not true. But we're finding
that Ft. Worth which is just 30
miles away has generated
more enthusiasm towards
helping us within their gay
community. And in Houston
we're finding that the gay
people away from the center
are wanting to step out and
help more and the only reason-
ing I can see for this is that
this is where it all happened
and this is where we live and
there's a threat that these
women and men that have
children realize that it was the
judges of Dallas County that
did this to us and if they did it
to us in Dallas County it can be
done to them. And I feel like
that’s what has happened.
They are supportive but not as
much so as what we're re-
ceiving from other commu-
nities.

Foreman: The National Gay
Task Force is supporting us
and so is the Texas Gay Task
Force which are very im-
portant gay organizations.

BMR: How are they going
about it?

Foreman: Right now they're
doing a lot of publicity and
fundraising and they’re doing
a lot of direct mailing and
mailing through their news-
letters which is very helpful.
The Texas Gay Task Force did
give us some money during
their conference last year
before the trial started and
they're trying to generate
publicity throughout Texas.
Even though it’s just getting
started I think it will be a big
help in the future and they will
probably be very strong allies.

BMR: Tell us something about
the Friends of Mary Jo Risher.

Foreman: I'm the President
of the Friends of Mary Jo
Risher.

Risher: She's the President
but I don’t think she's on the
board.

Foreman: No, I'm not. It's an
umbrella organization in Dal-
las that was created by NOW
members, by D.O.B. mem-
bers, by some of the gay
community who are not mem-
bers of any organizations and
by a lot of heterosexual
couples who happen to be
supportive of us. It's a good
thing to see all these people
working together, putting
their heads together and work-
ing collaboratively without any
problems between each other. To
me, a very wonderful and
moving situation.

BMR: How has the trial and
the publicity surrounding it
affected your lives?

Risher: Well, it's taken a lot of
privacy from our lives. Not
just Ann’s and mine, but the
lives of our children I'm sure.

Ann and I have always been
pretty much home people. We
like working and building
towards goals and we like
coming home and being able
to relax and watch TV and just
talk and communicate with the
children and have our suppers
at home and if we wanted to
go out to a movie we did and if
we wanted to take the children
out to eat this is what we used
to be able to do. This is no
longer our way of living — we
have our jobs but when we
come home we have a lot of
phone calls from throughout
the country, mail we receive
that has to be answered; meet-
ings of organizations through-
out Dallas County, the Friends
of Mary Jo Risher which
usually meets once a week,
NOW which meets every two
weeks, the D.O.B., and indi-
viduals who want us to speak
at small gatherings. Our lives
have been changed pretty
drastically. In a way the one
person I feel the sorriest for is
Ann's daughter. My two boys
are with their father and prob-
ably living fairly close to what
Richard had been used to,
hopefully — he’s not where he
wants to be but at least it's a
pretty routine thing, he does-
n't have to worry about the
phone ringing all the time day
and night. Ann and I can pretty
well cope with the routine we
have to live but Judie Ann has
been put in the situation
where we no longer have all of
our meals at home and if we
do have meals at home either
Ann or I is receiving a phone
call. We don’t have the oppor-
tunity to go to the movies and
things like that because,
frankly, the funds are just not
there. Our finances have been
exhausted and we're not able
to go out much anymore. We
do try to go to Richard's
favorite restaurant on one
night of his visitation. So
Judie Ann, the eleven-year-
old girl, is the one whose life
has been disrupted most.

Foreman: I might add though
that she's probably the
world's youngest feminist by
going to all the organizations.
She's one of our biggest sup-
porters.

BMR: You've mentioned that
the trial has exhausted your
personal finances, what has it
cost you in terms of money?

Risher: Up to this point we've
spent over $7000 on the first
trial. In ninety days we'll be
going to the Civil Court of
Appeals where we'll be spend-
ing a minimum of $4000. At
the state level I believe it’s
another $6000, I'm not really
sure, it's variable at that
point. But if we have to go the
entire route clear up to the
U.S. Supreme Court we will
spend approximately a mini-
mum of $35,000.

Within ninety days we need
a minimum of $4000 for legal
fees, attorneys fees, court
costs. Most of it will be in
attorneys’ fees this time. They
have a great deal of research
to do and will spend a whole
lot of time working on it. One
of the SMU attorneys whose
expertise is in custody cases
and constitutional law is
donating his time. So it's not
as bad as it could be and Doug
Risher will probably spend a
lot more than we will; but it’s
still a large amount.

BMR: Could you tell us about
your child support payments?

Risher: The first Monday of
January the judge and my two
lawyers, my ex-husband’s
lawyer, and the court appoint-
ed attorney for Richard, and
the judge, Oswin Chrisman,
met and worked up what they
felt was a working agreement
that all parties could live by.
At that time I was to pay $68 a
month in child support to
Richard Calvin and it was to
go into a trust fund until he
reached eighteen. I was to get
every other weekend for visi-
tation, and the weekends that
I did not get Richard, on every
other Thursday evening I was
to be able to pick up at 5
o'clock in the afternoon and
keep him until 8 PM. That
would give us an opportunity
to possibly go out for dinner
and just see one another. This
young man had been with me
ever since he was one month
old, some people don’t realize
that Richard is adopted but I
have cared for him since he
was one month old. They felt
that I would possibly need to
be seeing him every week for
some period of time for his
own development. They felt
that completely taking him
away and letting me see him
just every other weekend after
all these day-to-day things
that I had been doing for him
for his whole life might have
some emotional effect on him
at a later time. So I read the
agreement and I felt that I
would rather have him with
me all the time but I could live
with that up until I could get
him back, and I felt that he
would be better off with that
kind of working agreement.
But Mr. Risher, my ex-hus-
band, wasn't satisfied with
that. So around January the
12th or 13th I received a cita-
tion telling me to again appear
before Judge Chrisman on
Jan. 20th. At that time I found
out why. Mr. Risher was not
satisfied that I had the visita-
tions that I had, he was not
satisfied that I was going to be
paying only $68 a month and it
was to go into a trust fund. On
the stand Mr. Risher was
asked, “No matter what the
money Ms. Risher pays for
child support, would you mind
if it went into a trust fund for
Richard?" In the previous trial
Doug had mentioned that he
made quite a bit of money and
that he could support all mem-
bers of his family including
Richard
