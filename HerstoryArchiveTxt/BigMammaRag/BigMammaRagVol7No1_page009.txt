Discrimination Suit

Six long-time women employees of  
the Del Monte Corporation have filed  
a sex discrimination suit against the  
canning company.

The six have accused Del Monte and  
the International Longshoremen's and  
Warehousemen's Union of failing to  
defend them against sex discrimination  
at the company.

The women contend that male fruit  
sorters at Del Monte canning plants  
are allowed to transfer whenever one  
plant is temporarily shut down from  
seasonal work.

All female sorters are denied this  
opportunity, they say. By refusing  
women equal transfers, the class action  
complaint maintains, the female  
employees are effectively denied seniority  
and promotion benefits because  
they are hired and laid off each season.  
The women also complain that,  
instead of hiring women who have been  
laid off because of seasonal work  
schedules, the company often hires  
people "off the street" at lower  
wages to do the work.

Sterilization  
Guidelines

New guidelines for sterilizations  
paid by Medicaid were announced November  
7 by the Department of Health,  
Education and Welfare.

Incorporating a demand fought for  
by women's rights supporters, the new  
rules require a thirty-day waiting  
period between consent to sterilization  
and the operation itself. The  
old regulations required only a three  
day wait. The longer waiting period  
is designed to prevent women from  
being coerced into the operation.

The new rules also forbid sterilizations  
in prisons and mental hospitals.

Lesbians and Gays  
Denied Entry

Windsor, Canada - During recent  
months, a number of lesbians and gay  
men have been denied entry into the  
United States because US immigration  
officials suspected them of being  
homosexual. As a result, Windsor Gay  
Unity is compiling documentation on  
border turn-backs to be used in support  
of a public call for an end to  
such discrimination.

GPU News

The most recent case involved Bruce  
Miller, a Windsorite serving as an  
interviewer for the show Gayly Speaking  
on Detroit's public radio WDET.  
Miller was refused admission to the  
US when he admitted that he was gay  
to border officials. Miller contacted  
the Canadian Immigration officials to  
see if that action was legal, and was  
told that not only can the American  
authorities bar known or suspected  
gays from their country, but that  
the Canadian immigration act which  
removed homosexuality from the list  
of prohibited types of aliens.

In a similar case, women traveling  
to the Michigan Women's Festival in  
late August reported that they were  
refused entrance to the US. The women  
were asked if they were lesbians  
and they all said no. Then according  
to Sibyl Frei, "They searched our van  
and found a small amount of gay literature.  
We were informed that we were not to  
be allowed to enter the United States  
because the border guard suspected we  
were homosexuals.”

Anyone who has experienced similar  
trouble entering the United States or  
Canada is requested to contact Windsor  
Gay Unity. Please get the name  
and badge number of the official responsible  
for the refusal. Travelers to the US  
are advised not to admit their gayness  
to the immigration officials unless they  
are prepared to be turned back.

Equal Benefits

Washington, D.C. - The U.S. Labor  
Department has proposed new policies  
designed to make sure that employers  
do not discriminate against women in  
pension funds, health plans, and  
other employee benefit programs. One  
of the proposals would change the Department's  
interpretation of the Federal Equal  
Pay Act to require parity in both  
benefits and contributions for male  
and female employees.

Texts Censored

A high school vice principal in  
Dumont, NJ has cut photographs of  
sex organs out of a textbook. Vice  
Principal Edward R. Fisco of Dumont  
High School said he does not believe  
young children should see pictures  
of male and female sex organs. He  
also cut out a picture in the same  
seniors' textbook of a woman giving  
birth.

Fisco said one reason he took his  
action was because he did not want  
the pictures falling into the hands  
of the seniors' younger sisters and  
brothers. He contended he was not  
acting as a censor.

Fisco's action was apparently  
touched off by a student prank. Last  
March, a student removed one of the  
photographs from the text and pasted  
it on a gym locker along with some  
graffiti.

"The problem was a few students  
writing on the pictures and turning  
human sexuality into smut," said  
Fisco.

Minority Athletes

The Association for Intercollegiate  
Athletics for Women, the major governing  
body for women's intercollegiate  
athletics in the United States,  
has formed a Commission on the Status  
of Minority Women.

The association reports that while  
there were 17,000 women athletes in  
the association's institutions, a  
mere 1,400 of them were minorities and  
only 1,000 were black.

The association says that money for  
lessons and equipment, the lack of  
role models, and the lack of facilities  
and childcare were the reasons  
why so few minority women end up  
playing sports.

The Commission on the Status of  
Minority Women is expected to be  
making recommendations to improve  
the situation.

Male Guards  
Still Allowed

After nine months of deliberation,  
a decision was finally handed down  
November 22, in a class action suit  
filed by 11 inmates at the Bedford  
Hills Correctional Facility for women  
in upstate New York, against the  
institution's use of male guards in the  
living quarters. The judge ruled that  
male guards should be prohibited from  
working the night shift, from being  
present at the morning count at 6:30  
A.M. and from being in the shower  
area.

"The women were thoroughly disgusted  
with the decision," a woman from  
Women Free Women, a lesbian prison  
activist group told LNS, "Although  
parts of it might be considered favorable  
to the women, the overall effect of  
the decision will not be very dramatic -  
in effect, the male guards are free to  
wander up and down the corridors, peek  
into the cells and harass the women -  
in other words, business as usual.”

Male guards were first brought into  
Bedford Hills in July 1976, as a  
measure to eliminate “discrimination”  
in employment. At the same time,  
women were hired as guards in male  
prisons. But typically, while men  
now make up more than one third of  
the staff at Bedford Hills, women  
constitute less than 10 percent of  
the staff at New York's men's prisons.

At Bedford Hills, male guards were  
first assigned to the housing blocks  
in early 1977. And in April of that  
year, the women filed suit. They  
charged that the men invaded their  
privacy - watched them in the showers  
and toilets, pulled down the curtains  
blocking their cells from view,  
and terrorized them.

While the suit was in court, an  
injunction prohibited male guards  
from entering the housing units.  
Since the judge ruled that the women  
can take measures to ensure their  
privacy, guards are allowed to enter  
women's housing facilities during  
the day. There are also provisions  
in the ruling that allow for male  
guards to be stationed in the housing  
units whenever the administration  
deems it necessary.

The women plan to appeal the  
decision.

(Letters of protest can be sent  
to Richard Hongisto, Commissioner  
of Corrections, Albany, NY.)

Books Banned

Halifax - A bookstore here has been  
told that lesbian books cannot be  
imported into Canada. Red Herring Co-  
operative Books, an alternative bookstore  
specializing in socialist, feminist,  
gay and minority publications, ordered  
a number of books from Diana Press,  
a California lesbian feminist publishing  
house. On October 4, Denise Roberge,  
a member of the co-operative, went to  
Canada Customs to collect the parcel  
and was told by the official on duty  
that the books were banned.

Barry Mitchell, Superintendent of  
International Mail for Revenue Canada -  
Customs in Halifax, has denied  
any knowledge of a ban against the  
books. According to him, all incoming  
books are examined to determine whether  
their importation violates Customs  
Tariff Item 99201-1 which prohibits  
the importation of "immoral, indecent,  
treasonable or seditious" material.  
Suspect titles are referred to Ottawa  
for a ruling. If a book is banned, the  
importer is supposed to be notified  
in writing of the right to appeal the  
decision.

Lou Anne Meloche, a member of the  
Board of Directors of Red Herring,  
has stated that the Co-operative will  
re-order the books from Diana Press.  
“If a problem arises, we'll certainly  
not hesitate to take legal action to  
get the books.”

More “Auntie Porn”

Police in Perth, Australia believe that  
a gang of "anti-pornography fanatics"  
is responsible for a series of recent  
film thefts. Reels for "In the Realm  
of the Senses" and "Snow White and the  
Seven Perverts" were carried off from  
a suburban theater.

The picture on the Industrial Telephone  
System billboard was of a bikini-clad  
woman. The caption read, “The businessman's  
alternative to Ma Bell." Believing that  
this implied that a woman's body was  
available rather than a telephone, a  
coalition of women's groups in the Bay  
Area demanded that the company change  
its advertising. It did - shortly after  
someone defaced the billboard with the  
message, "Exploiting women will stop."

In Boston last year, a gallery called  
Photoworks carried an exhibit called  
"Dead Women." Some women calling themselves  
the Valerie Solanas commandos stole and  
burned five of the pictures, returning  
the charred remains by mail. Then they  
called in death threats. After one day,  
the exhibit came down and stayed down.

In Rome, Italy recently, women firebombed  
the apartment of an obstetrician who  
had been opposed to changes in the  
country's abortion law. (There were no  
injuries.) Around the same time, two  
boutiques were firebombed in the northern  
city of Bergamo. (Again, no injuries.)  
According to the Associated Press, one  
clothing store "was assailed in a note  
by the women's ‘proletariat’ which claimed  
responsibility for the explosion for  
“taking advantage of our bodies." The  
other boutique was renowned for the live  
topless model in its display window.
