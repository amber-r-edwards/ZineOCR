present another possibility, but
also create new problems, and
certainly don't free up time.

The problem for women, as of
all oppressed classes, is that we
have always had to make a
choice: love or work, children or
career, and now, surrender or
cynicism.

We have 2 dual, almost mutually
exclusive obligations, to make a
sexual revolution which will es-
tablish a society that will allow
us freedom of sexual expression
and to begin to implement our
ideas. Now we can spend
most of our time in “struggle
sessions” with our sisters or
lovers trying to work out the
complexities of multiple
relationships, jealousy,
possessiveness, etc., or we can
spend the major portion of our
time in effective political activi
ty.

Ellen Chambers, “Coming Out in
the Women’s Movement,” Se
cond Wave. V. 1, No. 3, pp. 34 &
85.

The majority of women active
in the women’s movement lack
outside support in the
traditional form of a husband. In
an economy which offers little
remuneration for revolutionary
activities but always has need of
cheap labor, we can support
ourselves through deadening,
dead-end jobs which sap our
energy. The work of challenging
the patriarchy through theory
and action is unpaid, and
because so few of us have the
means to do it full-time, it ex
pands to take as much of our
after-work time as we can give.
The dilemma of whether to
spend ourselves working to
create a new system which
would ultimately better our
lives, or using energy on per-
sonal relationships that can
make us happier now, is
agonizingly clear to the feminist
who can criticize the individual
solution, only to feel guilt on top
of inaction when the im-
mobilizing effects of a love affair
hit.

The solution to the problem
doesn't follow lines of sexuality,
either. Lesbians can feel less
fragmented by being able to
work with and love women
without experiencing the pull-
ing apart of the straight woman
with commitments to both the
women’s movement and to in-
dividual men. But while women
involved with other women start
with a certain mutual un-
derstanding and avoid the
problems of sex-role assump-
tions, this doesn't automatically
erase jealousy, distraction, or
the tendency to share with one
person to the detriment of a
group. In areas like Boston, with
an active women's community,
Lesbians often must work within
small incestuous groups, which
can feel very limiting when

everyone knows everyone else's
business.

For a woman determinedly
self-supporting, the economic
motivation for marriage may
seem odious, but the mobility of
the feminist who operates
within a lifestyle of
childlessness, cheap or used
clothing and furniture, group
meals and living, etc., ignores
the reality of the woman who
may need to support a child or
dress in a certain way to keep
her job.

Feminism has made a
difference in the personal lives
of women involved in the move-
ment. We need to extend this
influence to our economic lives, if
we are serious. Women who are
quick to realize that they are be-
ing oppressed as
wives/lovers/friends by men
have not begun to organize as
oppressed consumers. Part of
the reason the feminist move-
ment must constantly struggle
against fragmentation and
abandonment by its experienced
members is poverty. Too
many women of no independent
means must squeeze the
political and the personal into
after-working hours; too many
women of comfortable incomes

Women: A Journal of Liberation

continue to pursue the lux-
urious life, supporting in-
stitutions and industries that
oppress women. Women who
are vocal in their support of
feminism, but continue to con-
sume unnecessarily and don't
contribute what they can,
probably have a queasy reac-
tion to the concept of actual
economic changes which
would involve their losing
something: Romance as in-
dividual glorification plays a
role in salving these women's
consciousnesses. The idea of
the penniless, glamorous ur-
ban guerrilla, the underground
fighter supported by her sisters,
is just lovely if you're into
reading the diary of Che in your
well-heated, paid-for home.
The point is not to trash
women for not giving the move-
ment what's not really there:

were not utilizing what we do
have, largely because in-
dividualism and the personal
solution prevent women from
communalizing their economic
resources in order to free up
time for political work. Unfor-
tunately, wealth and radicalism
in the movement, as outside,
seem mutually exclusive. The
two most comfortable women’s
groups, NOW and Ms magazine,
avoid radical analysis with the
alacrity of a cat faced with a
bath. Small groups cranking out
newsletters on a mimeo are
more in touch with the issues
than these so-called
spokeswomen for the move-
ment, but they lack the means to
reach more than a tiny number
of women.

The fragmentation of
economic resources, in yet
another compromise with
capitalism, keeps the woman ac-
tive in the movement on her
toes. Either she works at a
secure job which takes most of
her time, or she has free time
because she is scraping by with
a shaky, marginal source of in-
come. Only in the traditional
family grouping is it assumed
that money will be pooled and
one partner will help bail the
other out. The precariousness of
many women’s incomes just
adds an insecurity to the
numerous ones automatically
attendant on a radical revamp of
one’s learnings.

Real social change will not
happen through accumulated
small changes made in the in-
dividual lives of those who are in
a position to make them.
—Statement for meeting to
found Boston feminist
newspaper.

Juggling one’s priorities, ex-
perimenting with “alternate”
lifestyles, and “open”
marriages, pursuing careers in
male professions that won't be
overthrown by a few token
women, all this becomes wear-
ing and isolating. Perhaps the
women in communities have
found a certain peace, but a
solution based on the exception
must spend a great deal of
energy simply maintaining itself.
And the solution that ignores the
problem cannot last. The power
is still out there, in the hands of
Ford and Rockefeller, Exxon and
the Army, and any time they
choose not to like these peaceful
communities, they can destroy
them.

Whether there is a solution in
a different society is hard for us
to know; we can look at other
cultures but the differences in all
areas are so great that it is im-
possible to tell how new ideas
could work in industrial Western
civilization. There is no solution
in our society.

Exploring Lesbianism, the
Past and Present —

A Lesbian History Exploration
is scheduled to take place from
the 2nd to the 4th of May in a
“beautiful secluded camp” out-
side Los Angeles.

The purpose of the exploration
is to share and compile informa-
tion about Lesbian herstory in
written, oral and visual form.

Among sources to be used will
be first-hand reports by women
who have participated in the ma-
jor events that have shaped the
recent Lesbian movement; per-
sonal testimony about the varie-
ty of ways that women have lived
as Lesbians — our triumphs and
our struggles to survive;
historical fantasy, mythology,
folklore, re-creation of our Les-
bian past; stories about the lost
women: women who should
have been Lesbians, women
who were “cured”, women who
committed suicide.

To participate in the con-
ference, or for information, write
to the Lesbian History Collective,
Good Taste Productions, P.O.
Box 1564, Santa Monica,
California 90406. The registra-
tion fee for the weekend is $35
or $65 depending on financial
status. It is the responsibility of
each woman to determine which
fee is more appropriate for her to
pay. The exploration is in need of
funds, so donations are in order;
any amount will be of great help.

All Lesbians are invited to
come. A great historical
endeavor is in the offing and the
participation of all Lesbians is
needed.

On March 30th there will be a
combined meeting of the
Speakers Bureau of the Lesbian
Task Force, the Gay Coalition,
Metro Gay Alliance and any
other interested groups and in-
dividuals to share contacts, in-
formation and improve relations
between the lesbian and
homosexual community and the
community-at-large.
