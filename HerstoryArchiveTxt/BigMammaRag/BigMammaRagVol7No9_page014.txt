A Quiet Subversion - Racism and Sexism

Luisah Teish

In comparison to pressing issues
such as South African Liberation,
Infant Mortality, and the slow death
of Affirmative Action; pornography
may seem a "low man" on the totem-
pole of black feminists’ priorities.
But just as the right-wing moves like
Bakke and Anti-abortion laws serve
to reverse the gains of the Civil
Rights struggle; the media is
quietly pressing forth dangerous
images of black women, a reverse of
our cultural development and self-
image.

Hints of Aunt Jemima, Bubbling
Brown Sugar, and the Tragic Mulatto
stereotypes can be seen on bill-
boards, t.v., and magazine covers.
But today's version of those stereo-
types have gained the dubious addi-
tion of black leather and a small
space in the porno market.

It is important that the images of
women born out of the Black Women's
Liberation Movement be realistic
images. Pornography serves to distort
our image.

The history of America is largely
one of the systematic symbolic and
physical exploitation of the black
woman's body.

On the slave ships and plantations
she served as an easy target for the
slave owners' carnal pleasures. At
any time and without provocation
the black woman could be raped and
beaten, without defense. In addition
to being the white man's concubine
she was also mated to the "black
buck" in order to produce the best
"stock" for next year's slave sale.
Again, she had no choice in the mat-
ter.

Through historical stereotyping
there has developed a myth that the
black concubine was a privileged
"house nigger" who wielded power
in the “big house” while others work-
ed in the field. More often than
not the women worked in the field
like other slaves, were raped at an
early age and bore children to the
white man, without compensation. Al-
though a few black women earned
their freedom or that of their chil-
dren, the inheritance left them was
not enough to give any significant
number of black people anything
even slightly resembling advantage
in this country.

What it may have left us with is
an inherited sense of abandonment
and powerlessness. With black men
unable to defend their women under
penalty of death, it soon became
a part of the slave culture for him
to stand by with only a prayer.

Today, we see vestiges of that in-
heritance in the exploitation of
women's bodies through the denial
of reproductive rights, prostitution
and two-bit pornography.

The stereotype of the big black
mammy, who wants nothing more from
her life than a job in the big house
and a shack full of pickaninnies,
has helped to make black women
victims of birth control experiment-
ation and sterilization abuse. Ne-
cisions are being made for them by
doctors who sterilize them without
their consent; and by slave values
that, coupled with economic condi-
tions, lead them to choose sterili-
zation. There are no statistics on
the number of black women who con-
sent to abortion and/or steriliz-

Living on the Edge

Dudy Barlow

Teetering on the edge. The edge bet-
ween upper middle class and lower up-
per class. Too much to be a part of
the middle class, but not enough to be
upper class. Alone, locked out.
Telling myself that I didn't need
friends because they did not want me.
Buying what love I could.

I was aware of class differences
very early in my life. I grew up in
a small town (1000 people). Most were
working class. There were a few old
families with a lot of money, but they
were mostly farmers. They didn't act
like they had money--lived in old
houses, wore old clothes. There were
a few families on welfare, but most
worked.

Dad likes to brag about his money.

How far he has come. His mother and
father came from Italy without a cent.
Small town butcher. Saved money. Put
it in the right place at the right
time. Now, a banker. Loves money.
Likes to count it. To feel it. To
touch it. Crisp and green. Security.
Securities.

I guess one might say that my family
was upwardly mobile. Big house and
big car, but I suspect that the family
was cash poor and rich only in the
amount of property and possessions
they had. My father was always trying
to get ahead--to get more and better
possessions, to be visibly wealthy, to
make a good impression. He may have
gambled by buying more than he could
afford, but it worked out for him.
Whenever things got tight financially,
something would happen like one of his
stocks would double or a steel company
would want to build a new factory on
one of his properties. He would glory
in the amount of profit he made and
include the family in his private
celebration--a weekend vacation, new
wardrobes, or a new car.

Outcast.

Dark-haired brothers.
Then, we were mutants. Seven years

older than him--a baby. No place to
belong. Loving the Italian extended

family, food and more food. Homemade
pasta hanging all over my Grandmoth-
er's kitchen. The smells of anise
and baking bread and spicy tomato

sauce. Dago ned. Comfortable home.
Womb. Eat. Too bad you are not thin-
ner. So many nice clothes. Here,

have some more ravioli.

I give you this background inform-
ation to show you just how out of
place our family really was in this
small town. We were too "up-town" to
fit in with the wealthy farmers and
too money-oriented to fit in with the
mainstream of the community.

-Emergency Librarian

Waiting up Saturday nights for Dad to
come home. Empty his pockets on my

dresser. Nickels and dimes. Quarters
because he loved me.
Bedspread, curtains, and dressing tab-
le all matching.
All because he loved me.

No erector set. Guess he didn't love me that
much. Brother had one. Even let me
play with it sometimes. But it was

his. Trucks too. Don't cut the hair
off that doll or you won't get any
more. Costs money. Snip. Snip.
Twenty of my dolls. All bald.
Don't cut her hair off or you won't
get any more. Cost money. I'll buy
you one because I love you. Have
some more money. I love you.

I was taught to look down at kids
in school who wore old clothes or were
not clean and shiny every day. I was
told that I was better than they were.

ation due to these factories. We
only know that approximately 30% of
America's married black women have
been sterilized. Far too many tele-
vision comedy shows portray black
families without fathers, and the
mothers on these shows are Aunt
Jemima-looking women with a shack
full of pickaninnies. Our children
watch these shows and absorb the
projected values.

Prostitution has been called a
"victimless crime." But the fact
that the number of black “working
girls” on Prostitution Row is dis-
proportionate to our number in the
society bespeaks an economic and
cultural crime. With the increase
of discrimination in education, jobs,
and federal aid, some poor black wom-
en have been forced to the streets.
Here they sell interracial fantasies
to suburban businessmen, Friday Night
in the Ghetto. And here they are ex-
ploited by the Pimp, the Peddler, and
the Police.

-Women in the Struggle for Liberation

Young black girls, through the med-
ia and environmental reinforcement
can be led to believe that their on-
ly choices are Aunt Jemima or Bub-
bling Brown Sugar. That media
images have significant bearing on
the life choices of many young Black
Americans is evident.

During the "Black Power Movement"
much cultural education was fo-
cused on the black physique. One
of the accomplishments of that per-
iod was the popularization of the
African hair-styles and the Natural.

dren's books present Madeline as a

The Witch of Blackbird Pond
Elizabeth George Speare

Delacorte Publishing Co.
$1.50/paper, for ages 12 and up

Orphaned Kit, luxuriously raised
in tropical Barbados, comes to live
with her Puritan relatives in Con-
necticut in 1687. The difference in
backgrounds between Kit and her
pious cousins results in a number of
conflicts. Kit flouts local custom
in many ways, most seriously by ma-
king friends with an old Quaker wo-
man, Hannah Tupper, who is the sus-
pected witch of Blackbird Pond.
Kit's daring climaxes in her own ar-
rest, imprisonment and trial for
witchcraft.

Kit's independent spirit, rejection
of bigoted values and her strik-
ing courage at a time when women
were burned for witchcraft, are to
be admired. However, the book is
marred by the emphasis throughout on
the standard question: "Whom
shall Kit marry?" Furthermore, most
of the other female characters are
unfortunately portrayed as staid,
pious, coy, submissive, or obnoxious. @
