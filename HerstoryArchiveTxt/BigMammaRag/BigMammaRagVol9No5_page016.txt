Every once in a while a  
book of fiction comes along  
that arouses your imagination  
to the point of dreading the  
final page. Once the book is  
finished, you know there will  
be another long drought of  
stories that have nothing to  
do with your experience as a  
woman, speak to what you know.

WOInK 4 A.J  
tempts to change and make  
change was. Ruth Geller's Seed  

Of A Woman. In  
her showed a respect for her  
characters and an understand-  
ing of the process that led  
many of them into the women's  
liberation movement. Ruth Gel-  
ler has given us another book  
that deserves our attention;  
this one is not all about the  
women's movement, but what the  
women's movement is all about.

Pictures From The Past is a  
collection of twenty short  
stories that are at once  
beautiful and disturbing, and  
undeniably authentic. Geller  
writes to involve the reader  
in what's going on with her  
characters. I liked that about  
Seed Of A Woman and she suc-  
ceeds time and time again  
with the stories in Pictures  
From The Past. Sometimes her  
stories leave you winded,  
wondering what it was that  
provoked your emotions so.  
The characters in Pictures  
are very accessible; they are  
not larger than life and they  
do not display a false hero-  
ism that has tarnished many  
books written about women  
confronting a sexist, racist  
and classist society.

Geller does not put her  
women through living out fan-  
tasies of how we might want  
the world to be, although  
there is definitely room for  
us to decide how the women  
might resolve their conflicts

down the line. The characters  
aren't perfect, don't know  
what the answers are, some-  
times to questions they have  
not even asked yet, and the  
problem(s) facing them are  
frequently unresolved. In  
fact, the only story in this  
volume that doesn't work is  
Drekula, because it is the  
only story with a tight fin-  
ish to an unrealistic situa-  
tion. What Geller does, and  
does well, is tell the story  
of women on the verge of hav-  
ing to face those "things" in  
their lives that are making  
them powerless. And this alone  
does not explain why the book  

is a good  
In The Gas Station Caper,  

is a widow after 34  

years of marriage and  

humiliation in to  
get fixed by a mechanic,  
"Knowing absolutely nothing  
about cars, convinced that  
mechanics could spot her com-  
ing a block away." And as in  
many of the other stories,  
The Gas Station Caper deals  
with women's relationships  
with each other - this time,  
the unresolved conflict be-  
tween Rose and her "hip"  
young daughter who has no  
sympathy for her mother's  
sudden "freedom" and subse-  
quent responsibilities.

In The City Of Our Hearts,  
Naomi is on a long train ride  
to visit her parents, from  
whom you sense there is great  
distance in more ways than  
one. She wears her “End the  
War in Vietnam: Bring Our  
Boys Home" button with delib-  
eration. A group of men  
take over the cafeteria on  
the train, making comments  
about all the women who pass  
by, entertaining the male  
passengers and making the  
women uncomfortable. In this  
context, Naomi and the older  
woman seated next to her take  
comfort in conversation with  
each other. The story could  
end with women as diverse as  
Naomi and her neighbor coming  
together around their common  
disgust of sexist male be-  
havior, but for our benefit  
it doesn't. The conflict oc-  
curs when Naomi learns the  
woman's son was killed in  

Vietnam, and the woman eyes  
with hatred Naomi's button,  
and for the duration of the  
ride “her neighbor's close  
physical presence only re-  
minded Naomi of the distance  
between them."

Another unforgettable story  
is Her Date With the Rich Kid  
which exposes the many ways  
women practice denial to get  
societal acceptance and male  
approval. Sally is pleased  
when Rodney, a rich kid  
forced by his parents as pun-  
ishment to finish his senior  
year in a public high school,  
asks her out on a date. She  
waits anxiously for him to  
pick her up, wanting to leave  
right away so he won't have  
to meet her family or see how  
she lives. Her grandfather is  
watching a television docu-  
mentary on the Nazis' exterm-  
ination of the Jews. At the  
same time she is horrified  
by what is on the screen and  
horrified that Rodney might  

discover her Jewish heritage.  
The way this conflict is  
dealt with the remainder of  
the story is powerful and not  
at all predictable; there is  
no clean ending, but there's  
definitely a sense of move-  
ment beyond the story. Sally  
may not affirm herself at  
the end of the story, but  
Geller tells us enough to  
know that Sally is well on  
her way.

Not all of Geller's women  
will become the women we'd  
like them to be. Some, like  
the woman in “The Island,"  
will remain trapped in their  
loneliness and frustration  
that is all too familiar. All  
together, however, these  
stories are believable  
triumphs and affirmations of  
women's experience and more  

- probably than not, you will  

find included a few of your  
own pictures from the past,  
or ones that haven't even  
been taken yet.
