Women Must Control

Own Medical

Barbara Hume

The other day I picked up  
Milestones in Midwifery  
expecting to find this book  

filled with all sorts of wonderful  
things about those women  
throughout history who have  
given so much of what little  
medical care there was. Instead,  
once again, I was face to face  
with the reality of life as a  
woman. This 1967 book from  
England, a country where  
females still play a central role  
in midwifery, is by a man about  
men. Why does this book  
mention only two women? What  
can we do about it? And what  
implications does this hold for  
the Women's Movement in  
general? The answer to why this  
book is so male oriented is  
subtly provided by the author,  
Walter Radcliffe, himself. Both  
surgical techniques and  
education were the carefully  
guarded rights of men only  
historically. Of forceps,  
Radcliffe says, “...the young  
surgeons who wanted to be in  
the fashion by taking up  
midwifery...wanted to know all  
they could about the new  
forceps, which gave them a  
skill—and a weapon—which the  

midwives could not claim.”  
Though forceps and other  
surgical techniques certainly  

reasonably

played a crucial role in barring  
women from the changing field  
of obstetrics, such a simple  
explanation alone does not  
satisfy why Radcliffe can claim  
all the milestones for men.  
Women were excluded from  
education at all levels. This  
meant that most midwives could  
not read or write, and so could  
not communicate their learning  
to the educated world of men.  
Thus Radcliffe is able to claim  
the use of ergot as a milestone  
for men though the female  
midwives had been using it for  
centuries before some man  
finally noticed and published his  
“new” discovery.  

No Credit  

Ergot is a parasitic fungus which  
grows on grain and in its refined  
forms is still one of the most  
important drugs in obstetrics. It  
hastens prolonged labors and  
helps the clamping down of the  
uterus after delivery to slow  
hemorrhage. Even Radcliffe  
admits that German midwives  
used it in prolonged labor, but  
he gives the credit not to the  
women who long saved lives  
with it, but to the man who  
wrote about it. We can help put

women back into their properly  
central role in the care of their  
bodies by correcting these two  
still existent problems. This  
century has seen no increase in  
the number of women in  
medical school. Sometimes I  
think this is because women are  
too intelligent to submit  
themselves to the inhumane  
atmosphere of medical  
education today. However,  
reality dictates that as long as  
the doctor is the power  
possessor in the medical world  
instead of one member of a  
good team, we need female  
doctors—lots of them. We need  
female doctors to help reverse  
the servant roles now so much a  
part of the hierarchy. We need  
female doctors who know the  
feeling of uterine cramps as  
directly as male doctors who  
know the ache of a scrotal  
injury. We also need male  
nurses. What of that majority of  
women not in medicine? There  
is nothing which keeps medical  
personnel more alert than a  
well-informed patient who asks  
intelligent questions.  

Publish or Perish?  

The what to do about  
“publish or perish” is clearly  
important in the female-male  
battle as well as in the more  
strictly academic world.  
Education is fairly open to us  
now. Individuals and women’s  
groups can use this tool to  
rewrite the history books and to  
research more effective and  
humane techniques in women’s  
medicine, and medicine in  
general. Barbara Ehrenreich and  
Deirdre English have begun to  
counter the male version of  
history in their pamphlet,  
Witches, Midwives, and Nurses.  
This extremely important bit of  
historical research reveals, for  
instance, that at the time  
midwives were outlawed in this  
country, it was not as we have  
always been told, because these  
uneducated women were less  
competent. In fact, a study by  
Johns Hopkins professor in 1972  
indicated that most American  
doctors were less competent  
than the midwives. Not only  
were the doctors themselves  
unreliable about preventing  
sepsis and ophthalmia, but they  
also tended to be too ready to  
use surgical techniques which  
endangered mother or child. If  
anyone, then, deserved a legal  
monopoly on obstetrical care, it  
was the midwives, not the MDs.  
But the doctors had power the  
midwives didn’t.  

The self-help groups  
around the country;  
groups of women putting out  
such fine materials as Our  
Bodies, Our Selves; groups  
lobbying for less restrictive  
legislation of nurses, midwives  
and other paramedics; groups  
like the La Leche League who  
daily combat questionable  
obstetric and pediatric  
practices—these are the primary

up registration packets. The  
keynote speaker, Ms. Mamie  
Moore, Assoc. Director of  
Women and Minority Affairs  
of the Day Care and Child  
Development Council of  
America, began half an hour  
late and took an additional  
ten minutes to tell us about  
the gas lines in the East,  
(perhaps she thought there  
are no newspapers or  
televisions here in the West).  

Wrong Place?  

When that ended, my  
group was told we were in  
the wrong place. A  
messenger from the  
organizers came running in  
to assure us that, no, we  
were not in the wrong place,  
and if we would stay put we  
would be entertained/educated with a  
movie. Except there was no  
sound for the movie. And  
when they got sound, it was  
so scratchy we could only oc-  
casionally understand it. If I  
were just a bit more cynical  
than I already am, I would  
have deduced that those  
stereotypes are right: women  
really are incapable of run-  
ning things.  

The morning/afternoon  
discussion groups that I  
either participated in or  
heard reports about ran the  
gamut from the ludicrous to  
the boring. Again, my more  
charitable side says that  
some people, women and  
men, may not have ever  
thought about stereotyping  
and its concomitant problem  
of discrimination. I didn't  
happen to run into any of  
those people.  

The day’s highlight, and  
only bright spot, was Rep. Pat  
Schroeder's lunchtime ad-  
dress. Congresswoman  
Schroeder is a delight to  
listen to, for her boundless  
enthusiasm and energy if no-  
thing else. Congress is one of  
the more stultifyingly serious  
institutions around. To hear  
an actual participant joke and  
laugh about it, while also  
learning about the position of  
pro-women legislation, was  
gratifying.  

Point for Trying  

The conference  
deserves some points for try-  
ing. Coordinators, Jules  
Loventhal and Dr. Sara G.  
Zimet, obviously put a  
tremendous amount of work  
into planning: some twenty-  
one local, state and national  
organizations “provided  
either or both financial and  
moral support.” We were  
given some helpful pamph-  
lets on Denver resources in  
overcoming stereotyping and  
on the national laws on dis-  
crimination in educational  
institutions. A couple of dis-  
cussion groups on dis-  
crimination and the law held  
some promise, although I  
was unable to find anyone  
who attended them. Twice as  
many people (more than  
600) attended than had been  
expected. Yet on the whole,  
the conference was a crush-  
ing disappointment.  

The Women’s Defense Com-  
mittee was formed on January  
12, 1974, at a meeting held at  
the Gay Community Services  
Center in Los Angeles. Activities  
on the committee include mem-  
bers of the Tide Collective,  
National Organization for Wo-  
men, Westside Lesbian Femin-  
ists, The Gay Community Ser-  
vices Center, and the Gay  
Sisterhood at UCLA.  

The purpose of the WDC is to  
raise money for court cases  
dealing with Lesbian and Femin-  
ist oppression, and to build  
public support toward these  
causes.  

The committee is presently  
working on two separate cases.  
Lynda Chaffin has lost custody  
of her two daughters, ages 11  
and 13, to her parents because  
she is a Lesbian. Marie Nunes  
lost her job because she could  
not maintain her security clear-  
ance when it was discovered she  
was a Lesbian.  

Support is needed in the form  
of money, publicity, and women  
who can give their time. Anyone  
interested in donating money,  
please send checks made payable

tee, 373 No. Western Ave., No.

Women interested in working on  
the committee, or who have any  
helpful suggestions, please write
