Filipino Domestic Workers Protest Exploitation

(Collective note: CARDWO is
the Committee for the Advance-
ment of the Rights of Domestic
Workers, c/o 728 East 37th
Ave., Vancouver, B.C.

The below article was in
CARDWO's first newsletter,
dated February 1982. The Com-
mittee was created on May 17,
1981 and came together through
the joint efforts of domestic
workers, the International
Association of Filipino Patr-
iots, and concerned individ-
uals.

Women migrating to new lands
always find the lowest paying,
worst conditioned jobs in the
workforce. Newly migrated
women of color are usually
treated as indentured serv-
ants not only in the US but
in other imperialist countries,
and the history is the same
as the present.

A good and interesting book
to read is Immigrant Women,
edited by Maxine Schwartz
Seller, Temple Univ. Press,
Philadelphia, PA, which is
the history of many immigrant
women from before the turn of
the century to the 40's.

We have carried two art-
icles in the recent past:

There are approximately
10,000 domestic workers in the
whole of Canada. These people,
largely women, come from dif-
ferent parts of the world: the
West Indies, England, Scotland,
New Zealand, the Philippines,
etc.

They are able to enter Can-
ada on temporary work permits
and on the basis of a valid
passport from their country of
origin. The very nature of
their legal status in Canada
exposes them to blatant ex-
ploitation in this country.

As a more concerted effort
is being waged today to end
this discrimination, more and
more domestic workers are com-
ing out in the open to regis-
ter their specific complaints
and problems.

Like most others, Filipino
domestic workers are also be-
coming aware of the need to
fight for their basic rights.

But unlike most others, Fil-
ipino domestic workers not
only have to deal with the
lack of justice in Canadian
law in relation to themselves,
but they also have to deal
with the representatives of
the Philippine government who
are trying to prevent them
from coming out to speak about
their unfair working condit-
ions.

Take for example the case of
Angie Ola-O. She is a member
of the coordinating committee
of CARDWO and is a very vocal
spokesperson for the domestic
workers. She has spoken at
public forums and demonstrat-
ions. She has appeared on
television and has been quoted
in newspaper articles. In short,
she wants Canadians and non-
Canadians alike to learn about
the sad plight of domestic
workers in this country.

Can you imagine what the Phil-
ippine consulate officials are
doing to her?

“They call me up in my
employer's home and tell me
if I don't stop speaking up, I
will be deported," Angie nar-
rated. "When that did not seem
to work, they hinted at what
I will be faced with when I
return to the Philippines."

This is in reference to the
fact that the Philippines is
under a dictatorial government
and the people are actually at
the mercy of what a military
mentality brings with it.

These calls came on 2 dif-
ferent occasions. And both
times Angie told them, "I know
my rights. I am not doing any-
thing wrong."

She even emphasized: "You
cannot export your martial
law terrorism here!"

The harassment did not end
there. On Jan 14th '82 Angie
went to the consulate offices
to renew her passport which is
due to expire in March of this
year. As soon as they realized
who she was, they confiscated
her passport without any expl-
anation except to tell her to
come back four days later.

When Angie returned on the
specified day, another CARDWO
member was with her. The con-
sulate officials immediately
realized that CARDWO knew
what they were doing and "they
panicked," described Angie.

"They scampered around--not
quite sure how to react to us.
Then they told us to wait and
later told me to come back
the next day."

Angie again was accompanied
by another CARDWO member when
she returned to the consulate
offices. And again, they were
made to wait.

When the officials managed
to get Angie alone in one of
the private offices, they
practically screamed at her,
asking her why she has to
have somebody with her every-
time she goes to the cons-
ulate.

"Is anything wrong with
that?", Angie retorted back.

"She is with me, she must
be here (inside the private
office) with me!"

Then Angie demanded an ex-
planation of why they didn't
want to give her passport
back. They said there was no-
thing wrong with it.

After some more waiting,
they handed it back--with a
2-year extension.

To understand why these
people are as brazen as they
are, one must understand the
whole Philippine situation.
Every time a Filipino domestic
speaks up, it is inevitable
that the worsening economic
and political conditions in
their home country become ex-
posed.

Just as the people in the
Philippines are being brut-
ally prevented from protest-
ing the injustice in their
country--so are representat-
ives of that government com-
mitted to preventing exposure
of that injustice here.

Angie, however, emphasized:
"We cannot allow them to
frighten us. If we do not
speak up--who will?"

POLICE

On Aug. 17, the US Senate
passed the "Immigration Re-
form and Control Act of 1982."
The most ominous feature of
the bill is that it lays the

national

groundwork for the early es-
tablishment of a national
identity system under which
every worker--immigrant and
citizen alike will be requi-
red to carry an ID card.

The law would require immi-
grants to swear under penalty
of perjury that they are "le-
gal" to work in the US. Em-
ployers will become "deputi-
zed" to enforce immigration
laws. The further authoriza-
tion of local police agencies
as immigration enforcers will
only heighten police racism.

The Bill sets a firm ceil-
ing on the number of immi-
grants allowed to enter the
US legally. The bill further
shortens the time period for
filing requests for asylum,
allows the INS to act as
judge and jury on asylum and
deportation cases. An amend-
ment to the bill declares
“the English language is the
official language of the US."

While US businesses are
free to go anywhere in the
world to set up operations
and plunder at will, workers
are prohibited from having
that same freedom to cross
the US borders and come to
this country. The majority of
undocumented workers are re-
fugees from Latin America,
where US corporations have
taken control of much of the
best land and resources.

The creation of a national
ID system would open the door
to an even more extensive sys-
tem of government controls,
abuses, and intimidation. In
this time of building fascism
in this country we must see
clearly how the capitalist
class is using the issues
of undocumented workers to
maintain divisions between
oppressed peoples on the ba-
sis of race, class, and sex.
