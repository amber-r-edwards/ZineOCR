Play their music at the
Coffeehouse. There's such a
hassle to get requests played
that women of color don't
feel welcome; they try to

be friendly to some of the
white women, and it's really
hard.

Eleanor: How do you integrate
your identification with the
Black culture with your strong
woman identification? How do
the things go together for
you?

Kim: Well, in terms of this
image about women, I wasn't
brought up with this image
that men were superior, and

I didn't have this long path
to get to where I am now, I
didn't have that far to go.
My father helped around the
house, he fixed dinner, he
bathed and clothed us, he
shopped for us when my mother
was working, and when he was
working they switched off.

My mother wouldn't have called
herself a feminist, but she
was. I mean, my mother
worked as an airline mechanic
during World War II. And my
mother said that all the
daughters leaving her house
would know how to cook and
sew, but they'd also know
how to use a hammer and saw,
and I do, and my brother
knows how to cook and sew.

In fact, he’s an excellent
cook. He sews his clothes,
he knows how to clean, he
knows how to do things that
were labeled for women. My

mother brought us all up to
be very self-sufficient and
independent, and that has
stayed with me.

And I have to say that
within the Black culture
there is a lot of emphasis
put on women, women do take

the initiative. Now I
didn’t come from a family
where there was no father
in the home, my father was
there. And he always treated
us equal. It wasn't that
my brother got away with
stuff because he was male,
it was all very equal.

In the Black church I
was raised in, African Meth-
odist Episcopal, most of the
key positions in that church
were held by women. As far
as I was concerned, my
culture and feminism went
hand in hand. The only
time I was ever told I
couldn't do something be-
cause I was a woman, was
usually by white people.

It wasn't by anybody Black.
I had to deal with that
when I did tech work in
theater, and the white women
would all be making the
costumes, and I would be up
on ladders and get dirty.

I never realized it was any
different until I went to
white school, (I am a pro-
duct of busing). And when

I wanted to work stage crew
in high school, they wouldn't

let me on, because I was a
woman. I even appealed to
the principal about it. If

now that we have
a movie star in the
White House

are you ready for
a radical film magazine?

that had been a Black high
school, I don't even think
it would have happened.

A discussion was had a-
bout the women's movement
and Kim's identification
with it. Eleanor made a
comment about Kim's being
regarded as an important
part of the women's commun-
ity in Minneapolis.

Kim: Well, that surprises me
very much because when I'm
dealing with racism, I'm

not just doing it for Black
women, I'm doing it for Black
men, too, who are discriminated
against just as much, if not
more. I feel that if I made
that clear in the women's
community I would get a lot
of negative responses from
separatists. But I as a min-
ority woman, I cannot afford
to be a separatist. I cannot
afford to not count my male
counterparts in. And if
someone said, "Well, Kim,
you've got a choice, you can
either go on working polit-
ically with women, or you can
work in a Black group that
includes men," I'm sorry, I'd
go with the Black folks.
Because I know that when
things come down at least I
have my people to turn to,
whereas these women over
here may forget who I am. My
mother used to say when I
was in school, "If it came
right down to it, how many

of those little white

friends would be there?" So
I learned early to be caut-
ious and not trust white
folks too far. So I don't

consider myself part of the
women's movement.

Eleanor: Is there anything
else you'd like to say?

Kim: I just hope that the
community here in Minneap-
olis—that some questions get
raised, and that people aren't
afraid of questions, whether
it be their best friend or
lover or whatever. Because I
know that on the whole people
are afraid of change, because
they don't know what that en-
compasses. I just hope people
start raising questions and
saying, "Hey, what are we doing
here?" or "Hey, that doesn't
sound right to me." And "Hey,
you really need to deal with
some of the stuff you're say-
ing and some of the things
you're letting happen." We
need to police each other be-
cause that's the only way
this stuff is going to stop.

We have to be examples for
one another because I really
believe that people are in-
spired by other people, it can
be the smallest thing. I'm so
inspired by people who have a
lot of compassion, and it
gives me something to go on
with. So I hope the community
starts dealing with a lot of
problems, because it's not go-
ing to get any better, it's
going to get a lot worse,
especially during economically
bad times, racism always crops
up in such times in history
because we become the scape-
goats for the problems. So I
just hope that people start
dealing with it.
