GYPSY WOMEN on stage

this: Even if it could be
proven that there was damage
done to the womb prior to

her birth, Rita was not en-
titled to the rights of a
persecutee of the Nazi reg-
ime. One needs to discern be-
tween those who are indirect-
ly victims and those who are

direct victims. In this
case, only the mother was di-
rectly damaged and therefore
entitled to compensation. The
daughters, however, were not
the targets of persecution
since they were in the womb.
When we moved back to Ger-
many from the U.S., we asked
how the suit for Rita's com-
pensation was going. They
said they needed more records.
Then they couldn't find the
records I had given them.
We've been fighting this
thing for too long. Then in
1979, after we had estab-
lished The Committee of the Gyp-
sies, the organization got
directly involved. We told
them that we would demon-
strate in front of the Office
for Reparations if we did not
get a clear response soon.
Again we went to the office.
I demanded a copy of the re-
jection. They dared to say,
"Well, you already received
it in 1960!" But I didn't
get anything. I asked them to
please find out who they sent
it to and who signed the re-
ceipt, and they had the nerve
to tell me that there was no
signature; the mailman signed

Like the Committee of the
Gypsies, other Sinti organi-
zations are fighting discrim-
inatory laws. Towns still put
up signs forbidding vagrants
from staying on their prem-
ises, and campgrounds refuse
Gypsies access to their prop-
erty. Now, more subtle forms
of discrimination have joined
these traditional ones.

With the arrival of the mod-
ern welfare state, Gypsies
are faced with the intrusion

of social workers and other
agency representatives who
create new problems of dis-
crimination for them. Melanie
Spitta, a Sintezza in Germany,
speaks out on this issue:

I want to talk about new
forms of discrimination,
which are much more subtle
but nevertheless just as dan-
gerous because they occur un-
der the guise of selfless
support for the Gypsies.

I am talking about discrim-
ination perpetuated by "well-
meaning" social workers, civ-
il rights activists, and Gyp-
sy "specialists" in the press.

Unfortunately, only a few
of these people know at which
point their help becomes su-
perfluous. When aid is not
aimed toward self-help, it
easily produces new forms of
dependence.

I will give you an example
that occurred in 1980 during
the Sinti hunger strike at
the former concentration
camp Dachau. It marked the
first of many Gypsy civil
rights actions. We were
striking for public recogni-
tion of the injustices done

to the Sinti and the Roma
and for acceptance of and
respect for our culture.

"The evening before the
hunger strike in Dachau, the
Sinti women conferred with
the men about whether we
women, who had also been in
concentration camps, should
strike with them. Some of
our women were determined to
strike. But we decided, as
did the older men, not to
take part in it. Since there
was only one room available
for the hunger strikers, one
of the older men advised us
to abstain, the argument be-
ing that the men would not
want us to see them in this
condition--just as we would
not want them to see us this
way. We agreed and supported
them from the outside. One
of the strikers put it this
way, “We know you are with
us in your hearts."

"Then something incompre-
hensible happened. We heard
that a German woman had
joined the men on the hunger
strike. A social worker from
Munich, not a Sintezza, not
a Sinti woman. She took over
a role that the Sinti women
would never have accepted.

At the same time, another
woman, a smart, liberated
woman who was fighting for
women's rights and whose
work the Sinti women had
watched with interest and
support, ignored us. She came
to Dachau in order to do a
TV feature that was later
well-received. But this
journalist did not give us
a single chance to voice
our opinion, to explain our
motives. Without asking us,
she discounted us because we
opposed the social worker's
interference. Instead, this
TV editor and the social
worker thought they had to
defend themselves against
those “repressed, jealous
Sinti women." With all our
problems, do we now have to
take on the social worker
syndrome as well?

Of course, we are grateful
for any help, suggestions,
and support. This help be-
comes fatal, though, when it
does not respect our history
and tradition, when the
helper begins to introduce
her/his own value systems.
This way we become dependent
on the helpers.

For instance, we had to
submit to sterilization dur-
ing the Third Reich. Today
they practice this in a more
"modern" fashion. Social
workers inundate us with

contraceptives as if they had
to preserve the interests of
the pharmaceutical industries.

Another example: you can be
sure that as soon as a group
of Sinti agree on an issue
dear to them and lay it down
on paper, a functionary of a
civil rights organization will
show up. S/he will have an
opinion on the issue and im-
pose it on us. For example,
s/he will decide that the
traditional cultural differ-
ences between Sinti and Roma
should be settled, and then
will proceed as if they had
been. Or a Sinti will be pub-
licly told off because s/he
only wants to speak on behalf
of the Sinti and not on be-
half of the Roma as well.

I am talking about persons
and organizations who trans-
gress the borders between so-
cial work and us, who style
themselves unconsciously or
consciously as Gypsies and
who lack any sensitivity for
the feelings, the delicacy
of another culture.

Often I ask myself why the
Sinti become the object of
the social worker's care.
This is not necessary for
self-help. Why do they seek
recognition for themselves in
the work for (or better, ag-
ainst) ethnic minorities?
Don't they have problems to
deal with in their own cul-
ture? Any real help has to
be based on the understand-
ing that we Sinti have always
abstained from forms of org-
anizations that are larger
than our families or kin.

We are a radically anar-
chistic people entitled to
say that we never suppressed
another people.
