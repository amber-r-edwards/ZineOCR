Letters Home To Mama

Validity of Funding  
Dear Big Mama Rag:

We thank you for trying to  
deal with some issues about  
money in the April issue, but  
so many of the same old myths  
that keep us powerless were  
reported as truth in the  
“Cooptive Dangers” article  
and in a very confused manner  
in the ‘Struggle’ column,  
that it was very distressing.

Let’s look at some realities  
about grants. There is a vast  
difference between govern-  
ment contracts and private  
foundation grants. There is  
also a vast difference between  
the practices of the several  
thousand active foundations.  
It is grossly inaccurate to jump  
all grants into one category, as  
did the Woman to Woman  
Bookstore Collective, and  
fear-tag them as inherently  
dangerous.

Government contracts do in-  
volve a great deal of reporting  
requirements and program  
restrictions. If your work is  
going to involve activity which  
confronts the city, state or  
federal government in any  
way it is not wise to run that  
program on government fun-  
ding. However, foundation  
money and, believe it or not,  
some corporation grants, are  
no more inherently cooptive  
than a gift from your grand-  
mother is. It all depends on  
what you’ve proposed to do  
with it and how you use it.

There is a national Network  
of Change Oriented Foun-  
dations. One foundation  
makes grants to grassroots

organizers who are doing  
research and conducting ac-  
tions to change oppressive  
public policy of public institu-  
tions. Some have made grants  

to projects such as the  
Women’s Action Training  
Center, Oakland, California  

and Women’s Health Forum  
in New York. There are  
hundreds of foundations that  
are willing to make grants to  
programs which can be  
important steps in our revolu-  
tion.

Rarely are there any  
“strings” to a foundation  
grant other than that you do  
what you told them you were  
going to do and you account  
for the money by giving them  
a financial report at the end of  
the year. They need this  
financial accounting to protect  
their tax-exempt status. If  
they wish to change your  
proposed program in any way,  
they will propose their idea to  
you before approving the  
grant. You can negotiate with  
the foundation staff. You can  
also say no to the grant if they  
are interested in a program  
other than what you want to  
do. If you have your priorities  
straight, there’s no reason  
why you can’t be in control. If  
the Feminist Press (mentioned  
in the “Dangers” article) really  
didn’t want to do the nonsexist  
curriculum program, they  
didn’t have to accept the  
money.

In concrete ways that you can  
point to, how does the cash  
received from a foundation or  
corporation for a program you

have proposed, actually  
change the politics of your  
organization if in fact you are  
still carrying out the project in  
the way you wanted to do it?

Now if you weren’t prepared  
and hadn't planned well  
enough how to conduct your  
program and how to spend  
that money, and the presence  
of the money causes division  
among your group, whose  
fault is that? We must stop  
pointing to master planners  
plotting against us when in  
fact a mishap or blunder was  
due to our own failure. We  
will never be in a position of  
strength if we expect to be  
victims.

OK. Some factors that will  
determine whether a grant  
becomes a useful resource to a  
feminist project or a divisive  
threat are 1) how clear and  
concrete the immediate pro-  
gram goals are, before raising  
the money; 2) how solid the  
group’s decisions about how  
to spend the grant money are,  
before receiving it; 3) how  
together the group is in group  
decision making during the  
process of the program and  
most important; 4) how well  
rounded the group’s total  
funding strategy is (e.g. rais-  
ing money from many  
sources, including grassroots)  
so as not to ever be totally  
dependent on one grant. It is  
only when you've become  
dependent (either materially  
or psychologically) on a parti-  
cular grant that it could begin  
to influence the political cor-  
rectness of your work. As long  
as you’ve got nothing to lose  
but that money, how can you  
be coopted? So why not use  
that money to further our  
goals if we can?

My partner and I regret that  
Eileen and Kate did not state  
in the beginning of their  
“How to” article that it was  
very editorialized. The article  
was not an accurate report of  
the material presented in our  
workshop. Much of the  
factual material was correctly  
reported, but the tone and the  
interpretations of the material  
reflected the reporters’ philo-  
sophies and emphases—not  
ours. The main correction we  
would like to make now is in  
their statement that the grant  
seeker should research the  
foundations first, then plan  

what to ask them for. This is  
dangerous, you should know  
exactly what you need the  
money for and how you’re  
going to spend it before you  
choose any funding sources.  
Doing it the other way around  
is what can lead you to doing  
programs that only the foun-  
dations think are needed and  
not what you know is needed.  
If there is a “herstory” of  
grants being disruptive and  
cooptive, it is indeed largely  
our story on why and how we  
have not been able to plan  
strong programs and be in  
control of the money we raise,  
rather than let it control us.

with Stella Alvo of upcoming

How to Raise and Use Grants  

P.S. We would be willing to  
write an article on how to  
utilize grants.

To the women of the Big  
Mama Rag collective:

Please renew my subscription  
and change my address. I am  
enclosing old address label  
and a check.

I feel this surge of joy from  
the sheer energy of typing  
this change of address—feels  
good to be moving back west.  
Big Mama has taken care of  

me during the last year of  

graduate school exile, not only  
keeping me informed of poli-  
tical climate in the west but  
also giving me some good  
instructional material for  
courses in women’s literature  
and in political writing. I have  
used articles from BMR as  
examples of good radical  

run by women

journalism. By good, I mean  
that I rarely see you relying on  
empty political jargon to make  
your points—you have a good  
blend of analysis, reporting,  
and criticism, a blend which  
contrasts sharply with most of  
the “radical” papers pub-  
lished around Binghamton,  
NY. (In case you missed my  
compliment, somewhere in  
that last sentence is the  
highest praise I give to  
political journals.)  
Concerning the story you ran  
a few months past on the  
Grand Jury abusement, did  
you happen to catch a three-  
part article in the April New  
Yorker, on the Fifth Amend-  
ment and the Grand Jury. The  
series starts with the report of  
two Connecticut women who  
were harassed by the FBI and  
Grand Jury process and the  
Fifth Amendment. The series  
is tightly written, carefully  
researched, and cogently ar-  
gued. If you haven’t already  
seen it, I think it’s essential  
reading for every person who  
has any connection with the  
women’s movement and ne-  
cessary reading for every  
American (my Bicentennial  
plug). The man who re-  
searched the article makes  
some special points about the  
ways in which the women’s  
movement has freaked out the  
FBI.

Well, thanks for changing  
the address and extending my  
subscription. Your periodical  
is the only one which has  
inspired me to write a note  
with the address change. Says
