More Genital  
Mutilation  

An Ohio gynecologist says that  
"millions of American women" are  
ideal surgical candidates for a  
"vaginal reconstruction operation”  
he calls the "Mark Two.”  

Doctor James Burt of Dayton says  
that he has performed some 4000 oper-  
ations on women--at a cost of about  
$1500 each--in efforts to “reconstruct  
the vagina to make the clitoris more  
accessible to direct penile stimula-  
tion."  

Burt claims this operation "enables  
women to have more frequent and more  
intense orgasms." He says he has  
performed the surgical procedure  
on his own wife and that she is  
“demonstrable proof that the opera-  
tion works."  

The doctor reports that his "Mark  
Two product" is achieved by relocat-  
ing the vagina, lengthening it and  
then severing a major muscle in the  
genital area.  

Seven Days magazine reports that  
Burt is so overjoyed about his "pro-  
duct" that he's hired a public relat-  
ions firm to help spread the good  
news.  

Not everyone is ecstatic about the  
“Mark Two," however.  

Diane Fordney, Associate Professor  
of Gynecology at the State University  
of New York at Stonybrook, charges  
that the operation is a "sexist,  
woman-reducing process suggesting  
that women should arrange their  
anatomy to meet a male-induced and  
male-desired goal."  

Seven Days says that no male physi-  
cian has yet suggested surgery on  
the penis to help increase its possi-  
ble contact with the clitoris.

Nurses May Sue  

Two Philippine nurses who had  
stood trial last year for the bizarre  

poisonings of patients at a Michigan  
veterans' hospital, say they may file  
suit against the hospital.  

The nurses were convicted last  
summer of injecting Pavulon, a power-  
ful muscle relaxant, into the intra-  
venous tubes of six patients at  
the veterans hospital in Ann Arbor.  

The judge, however, last December,  
set aside their convictions and  
ordered a new trial for Filipina  
Narciso and Leonora Perez, saying the  
nurses had been the victims of  
"circumstantial evidence" presented  
by the prosecutors. The judge  
accused the government of “persistent  
misconduct" in presenting the case.  

Following demonstrations in support  
of Narciso and Perez, and expressions  
of outrage by the Philippine govern-  
ment, the U.S. government decided  
last February to drop all charges  
against the two nurses. U.S. attorn-  
ey James Robinson said he believed  
any evidence presented at a second  
trial would "continue to be circum-  
stantial."  

Perez and Narciso say they have now  
asked their lawyers in Manila to look  
into filing a possible suit against  
the Ann Arbor Veteran's Hospital for  
personal damages resulting from the  
lengthy trial.  

The two nurses have charged the  
hospital failed to provide proof that  
the poisoning even resulted from  
Pavulon injections. They are also  
charging that the hospital's effort  
to single them out as being responsi-  

“ble for the deaths of the patients  
were both racist and sexist.

Hustler’s Self-Parody  

Several anti-violence groups have  
lashed out against Hustler magazine,  
claiming that the publication's re-  
ported attempt at "self-parody" has  
failed.  

The cover of the June issue of  
Hustler portrays a picture of  
a naked woman being fed head-first into  
a meat grinder and turned into ham-  
burger. The caption under the pict-  
ure is a quote by the magazine's  
owner Larry Flynt saying “We will no  
longer hang women up like pieces of  
meat."  

A Berkeley group called “Women  
Against Violence in Pornography and  
Media" does not view the meat  

grinder image as a change in Hustler's  

previous violent treatment of women.  
The group is currently picketing San  
Francisco Bay Area stores which  
carry the magazine.  

Paul Krassner, who edited the June  
edition said that picture is meant to  
be a self-parody of the magazine  
"making fun of the past history of  
Hustler when women were treated like  
pieces of meat," before owner Flynt's  
conversion to Christianity. Since  
Flynt's conversion, Hustler has  
professed to be changing its attitudes  
toward women.  

Immoral or  
Scandalous  

The Patent and Trademark Office  
of the United States Department of  

Commerce rejected an application to  
register the name "Gaysweek" be-  
cause the proposed trademark was  
“immoral or scandalous."  

"It is remarkable that anyone,  
even the federal government, could  
find the word ‘gay’ to be immoral  
or scandalous in this day and age,"  
said Michael Lavery. "Certainly  
Gaysweek intends to challenge this  
medieval attitude.”  

The examiner found the proposed  
trademark acceptable in all other  
respects but requested “one complete  
issue of the publication from which  
the specimens (of the proposed  
trademark) filed were obtained."  

Alan Bell, Gaysweek publisher,  
said, "I'm surprised, but again  
I'm not. You can't take anything  
for granted."

Slap His Hands  

Two University of Arizona students  
have been placed on one year's  
probation after they pleaded guilty  
to conducting a panty raid in which  
several women claimed they were "Sex-  
ually abused."  

The women charged that some 20 men  
from the Sigma Alpha Epsilon  
fraternity entered their sorority  
last fall, pulled women from their  
beds, and threw them fully-clothed  
into showers.  

Several women charged that some of  
the men had torn clothing off them  
and fondled them during the panty  
raid.  

As a result of the raid, the Univer-  
sity filed charges of disorderly and  
indecent conduct, trespassing and  
violating visiting hour restrictions  
against four of the students.  

Two of those men have subsequently  
left the school. The remaining  
students pleaded guilty to a mere  
violation of visiting hour restrict-  
ions. All other charges against them  
were dropped for lack of evidence.

Another group called Women Against  
Violence Against Women in Rochester,  
New York, is staging a protest.  

Other protests have already taken  
place in Los Angeles.  

Krassner, meanwhile insists that  
the picture was simply intended as  
a "grotesque, humorous extension of  
where Hustler had been." Krassner  
says he apologizes to anyone who was  
"hurt by the image."  

Laura Leger of Women Against Viol-  
ence in Pornography and Media, reports  
the picketing of Hustler outlets will  
continue in an effort to reduce the  
distribution and sales of a publication  
which she says encourages assaults on  
women by “showing the most brutal  
violence against them."

Making Time  

Colorado's Supreme Court has ruled  
that District Judge Dean Mabry was  
wrong last fall, when he freed a man  
charged with sexually attacking a  
woman. Mabry had said that alleged  
assault sounded to him like an attempt  
to "make some time."  

The victim had told the court the  
defendant, John Montano, broke down  
her door, pushed her against a wall,  
and climbed on top of her. She  
said he then broke the zipper of her  
pants and put his hand inside.  

Judge Mabry, however, termed the  
behavior more like "an attempted  
seduction" than a sexual assault.  

The judge said, “while there may  
have been a slight confrontation of  
some kind and perhaps a feeling out  
by the defendant as to whether he  
would make some time with the  
victim...nevertheless, after a very  
short interlude and upon the request  
of the victim...the defendant did  
leave."  

Judge Mabry then acquitted Montano  
of the sexual assault charge.  

The High Court, which heard the  
case on appeal, disagreed. Without  
criticizing the judge's comments, the  
state Supreme Court said Mabry should  
have left the question of Montano's  
guilt or innocence up to a jury to  
decide.  

The High Court's decision won't  
affect Montano, however. Under the  
U.S. Constitution, no one can be  
tried twice for the same crime, so  
his acquittal stands.

Dangerous Crossing  

The Texas Farm Workers Union (TFW)  
and the U.S. District Attorney for  
the southern district of Texas have  
called for an F.B.I. investigation  
into the death of a documented Mex-  
ican worker named Maria Contreras.  

Contreras died of a heart attack  
while being interrogated by the  
Immigration and Naturalization Ser-  
vice at the Texas border town of  
Progresso last month.  

Contreras, who was eight months  
pregnant at the time of her death,  
was reportedly returning to the U.S.  
from Mexico with a young woman she  
had hired as a housekeeper.  

She allegedly stopped for a rout-  
ine check at the border station in  
Progresso where she was then detained  
and accused of trying to smuggle  
the young woman with her into the  
United States. Contreras' papers  
were confiscated and immigration  
officials threatened her with  
deportation.  

Despite the fact that Contreras  
was eight months pregnant and visi-  
bly suffering, immigration officials

Exotic Robbery  

A North Carolina man was reportedly  
robbed of $1,400 by prostitutes last  
month, according to Denver police  
reports.  

Earl Holt Johnson, Jr., 34, of  
Charlotte, N.C., told police he and  
two women went to his hotel room,  
where he was robbed of his wallet  
and gold wrist watch.  

"She tied me in the chair to do  
all kinds of exotic things to me,"  
said Johnson. “She and her friend  
turned off the lights and that is the  
last I saw of her or my money and  
watch."  

The two women were being sought by  
Denver police for investigation of  
robbery.

Concealed  
Weapons  

Denver Police Chief Art Dill has  
the authority to keep secret the  
names of persons he has authorized  
to carry concealed weapons, a judge  
ruled last month.  

Denver District Judge Flanigan  
ruled that the names and addresses  
of persons with permits to carry  
weapons don't have to be released  
upon request, despite the Colorado  
Open Records Law which makes most  
governmental documents available for  
inspection.  

Dill testified that at any time  
about 400 persons in Denver--mostly  
lawyers, judges, bankers and business-  
men--have a permit to carry concealed  
weapons. Dill is the sole Denver  
authority to decide who gets the  
permits.  

According to Dill, about 10 per-  
cent of the persons who have permits  
asked for them after their lives had  
been threatened. Some threats are  
under investigation, Dill testified,  
and said that revealing the names of  
persons who had been threatened might  
impede the investigations or subject  
them to another attack.  

Women, the usual victims of violent  
attacks, are consistently refused  
permits. One local feminist inquired  
about a permit after being attacked  
by a man who broke into her apart-  
ment and assaulted her with a butcher  
knife. The police replied that  
they don't issue permits to many  
people because too many people do not  
know how to safely use weapons.  

--Denver Post  

allegedly accused her of “faking”  
when she became ill, and ignored  
pleas to call an ambulance for her.  

An ambulance was finally summoned  
some 45 minutes after the onset of  
Contreras' illness. She was pro-  
nounced dead on arrival at the hos-  
pital. Her baby also died.  

In the wake of Contreras’ death,  
The Texas Farm Workers Union has  
organized marches and demonstrations  
to "demand justice not only for  
Senora Contreras, but to protest  
all that the workers have suffered  
at the hands of the Immigration  
Department."  

The only investigation so far has  
been conducted by the Immigration  
Service itself. That investigation  
resulted in the transfer of Ruben  
Gonzales, the official in charge of  
Contreras' interrogation, to another  
border station. However, Gonzales  
is now back at his old post in  
Progresso.
