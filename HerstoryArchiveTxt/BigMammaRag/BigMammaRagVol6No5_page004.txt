Kentucky and the ERA

A long-time backer of the Equal  
Rights Amendment, Lieutenant Governor  
Thelma Stovall vetoed the Kentucky  
Legislature's effort to rescind its  
passage of the E.R.A.

Kentucky's state constitution allows  
a lieutenant governor to act in the  
governor's place when the chief exec-  
utive is out of town.

Aides to Kentucky's Governor Julian  
Carroll have denied that Carroll left  
town so that Stovall could ax the  
anti-E.R.A. measure in his absence.

Stovall claimed in vetoing the re-  
solution that the legislature lacked  
the legal power to take back its ear-  
lier ratification.

Kentucky initially ratified the  
Equal Rights Amendment in 1972.

E.R.A. opponents in the current leg-  
islature say they plan to go to court  
to contest Stovall's right to veto a  
constitutional resolution.

Stovall isn't too worried, however.  
She told The Los Angeles Times that  
hundreds of thank-you telegrams are  
pouring in from E.R.A. supporters all  
over the country.

“Daddy Grabbers”

Alaskan Legislators are vowing to  
slash funds for an Aid to Dependent  
Children program (ADC).

The Child Support Enforcement Agency  
commonly known in Alaska as "daddy  
grabbers," has come under attack be-  
cause of certain questions it asks  
unmarried welfare mothers in order to  
determine the paternity of their child-  
ren born out of wedlock.

Among the questions asked on the  
form given to women applying for ADC  
are questions relating to the number  
of times a mother had sex with the  
child's father, where and when sex  
took place, and whether or not she had  
sex with anyone else.

The lawmakers charge that the quest-  
ions violate rights to privacy under  
that state constitution. As a result,  
the legislators say they are planning  
to channel some of the agency's money  
into other areas.

Women on the aid program are not  
entirely happy with the legislators’  
solution, however. Some say that ADC  
is often the only way they can feed  
their children. They charge that the  
lawmakers could find a better way to  
deal with the invasion of privacy  
problem.

Sperm Causes Cancer

Each year in this country about fifty  
thousand women develop cervical  
cancer. The curious thing is that vir-  
gins, lesbians, and nuns rarely deve-  
lop it. Some studies show that women's  
risk of getting cervical cancer in-  
creases with the frequency with which  
they have intercourse. One theory  
says that all sperm cells contain an  
enzyme whose job is to pierce through  
and enter the cell wall of the egg  
(conception) and start growth and preg-  
nancy. The trouble is that the sperm  
cannot distinguish between cells that  
are eggs and the cells of the cervix.  
During certain phases of a woman's  
hormonal cycle, a regeneration of cer-  
vical cells occurs and the new cell  
walls are thin. At this time the  
sperm enzymes can more easily pene-  
trate the cells, causing some to start  
dividing, resulting in abnormal cell  
growth and possible cancer.

Karen Silkwood

A key witness in the $160,000 dam-  
age suit brought by Karen Silkwood's  
family has died suddenly of a heart  
attack, just shortly after he was ser-  
ved with a subpoena to give evidence  
in the case.

Thomas Bunting, the head of the  
Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation, died  
unexpectedly of a heart attack last  
February, just three days after he was  
served with a subpoena to appear at a  
preliminary court hearing in the Silk-  
wood case.

Bunting, age 44, had no history of  
heart trouble. Despite this, however,  
no autopsy was performed on the former  
bureau chief, and he was quickly bur-  
ied the day after his untimely death.

Silkwood was killed in a 1974 auto  
crash while she was driving to meet  
with reporters and a union official  
over safety problems at the Kerr-McGee  
nuclear plant at Crescent, Oklahoma.  
Her family has sued Kerr-McGee, the  
F.B.I. and others, charging that they  
conspired to cover up the circumstan-  
ces behind Silkwood's death.

Bill Davis, an investigator with the  
Silkwood family, reports that Kerr-  
McGee attorneys have threatened to go  
to court, if necessary, to prevent  
Silkwood attorneys from interviewing  
Bunting's family about his death.

Others who are scheduled to give  
evidence at the preliminary hearing  
are James Herbey, the head of Bell  
telephone security for the Southwestern  
region; William Bettor, the head of  
intelligence for the Oklahoma City  
Police; and Jacque Srouji, a former  
F.B.I. informer and newswoman involved  
in the case.

Racist Pigs

New York State Prison Guards can now  
openly join the Ku Klux Klan, accord-  
ing to a New York State Supreme Court  
ruling last November. Many prison  
guards and police around the country  
have long been members of the Klan,  
the Nazis, and other violently racist  
organizations. Up until this ruling,  
however, government officials have  
exerted pressure on guards to keep  
their membership secret.

Idiots and Lunatics

The attorneys general of Missouri  
and Nevada filed an unprecedented  
anti-trust suit in Federal court this  
month in efforts to stop the apparent-  
ly successful boycott by the National  
Organization for Women of states which  
refuse to ratify the Equal Rights  
Amendment.

The Missouri and Nevada attorneys  
general contend that the campaign  
constitutes a "boycott" which they say  
is a restraint of trade in violation  
of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.

In light of this action, it is inter-  
esting to note the legal precedent  
for this suit, according to the attor-  
neys general for these two states.

The lawyers purport to bring their  
lawsuits as "parens patriae, trustee,  
guardian and representatives of its  
citizens and the economy of the state."

Justice William O. Douglas has ex-  
plained that the “royal parens patriae  
power" stems from an early English  
"royal prerogative” which was exercised  
by the "King in his capacity" as "fat-  
her of the country" and "as the gener-  
al guardian of all infants, idiots  
and lunatics."

Body Politic Raided

On December 30, 1977, the office  
of Body Politic, a gay-feminist-  
socialist newspaper, was raided and  
effectively shut down by the Toronto  
(Canada) police. Several members of  
the collective were arrested and  
charged with “use of the mails for  
... transmitting anything that is  
obscene, indecent, immoral, or  
scurrilous."

The police seized twelve crates of  
“evidence” from the Body Politic  
offices, including the complete sub-  
scription lists, manuscripts, corres-  
pondence, papers, and books offered  
for sale by Pink Triangle Press.

The raid was apparently a result of  
an article dealing with pedophilia  
entitled "Men Loving Boys Loving Men."  
The Toronto police cited anti-obscen-  
ity laws and raided the paper when  
"child pornography" was a topic of  
great interest and crusades.

Rotary Women

The Rotary Club of Duarte, in Los  
Angeles, has been ousted from Rotary  
International because its leaders re-  
fused to get rid of female members.

Rotary International spokesperson  
John Giles described Rotary as an  
international service organization of  
business and professional men, and  
said that the Rotary constitution for-  
bids the group from opening its doors  
to women.

Doctor Richard Key, the president of  
Duarte Rotary, had told the Internat-  
ional board that there was "no way"  
the women members would be asked to  
resign.

The Duarte Club says it will appeal  
the case to the California Supreme  
Court.

ducing a 16-year-old busboy employed  
in the same restaurant. On the same  
day, a man convicted of raping a 12-  
year-old girl was sentenced to one  
month in jail.

Trouble-makers

Judith Pierce, who is black, single,  
and a lawyer, charged in New York's  
Manhattan State Supreme Court that  
she was denied the right to rent an  
apartment on account of her race and  
marital status. The landlord, however,  
claimed that the reason he wouldn't  
rent to her was because she is a law-  
yer, and consequently, too knowledgeable  
about her rights. He preferred tenants  
who were more passive and less inform-  
ed. The judge ruled in favor of the  
landlord, commenting that landlords  
are legally free to discriminate again-  
st people because of their occupations  
and can legally refuse to rent to  
“intelligent persons, aware of their  
rights, who may give him trouble in  
the future."

MS. and  
Communist Folksingers

MS. magazine has been banned from  
the bookshelves of Nashua, New Hamp-  
shire school libraries.

The school board voted five-to-three  
to ban the magazine after one board  
member, Alan Thomaier, objected to its  
advertising.

Thomaier said the ads “encouraged  
young ladies to send away for things  
such as contraceptives, and materials  
dealing with lesbianism and witch-  
craft."

In addition, Thomaier said young  
minds were exposed to ads for "records  
for children made by known-Communist  
folk singers."
