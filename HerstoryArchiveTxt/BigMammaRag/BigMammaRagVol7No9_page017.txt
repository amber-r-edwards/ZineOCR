Puerto Rico Libre!

I have been asked who has had the
most influence in my life. I would
have to say Lolita Lebrón, not only
as a Puertorriqueña, but as a woman.
Her recent publicity has nothing to
do with my choice; I've admired her
ever since I found out what it is to
be a Puertorriqueña.

Lolita Lebrón is a woman who stands
alone in the history of Puerto Rico
(Borinquen). She had the guts to de-
fy and defeat man, culture, and es-
tablishment.

In order to understand Lolita Le-
brón, first you must understand that
in the Puertorriqueña culture, women's
sole purpose is to bear children.
Even nowadays if you have no child-
ren, there is something wrong with
you. All in all Lolita comes from a
male-oriented and dominated culture.
But she had an ideal—to see our
homeland free from exploitation and
invasion, free to choose our own gov-
ernment and allies, to use our land
as we see fit, for the benefit of
all our people without outside influ-
ence.

So, she stood up to fight for what
she believes in, with everything a-
gainst her, sacrificing 25 years of
her life in prison. My admiration
for this woman, Lolita Lebrón, is
great, for in the 25 years in prison

Cause &

The First Sex, by Elizabeth Gould
Davis was clearly a revelatory
point in my life. I vividly remem-
ber reading late into the night when
I first got it, my mind reeling
and spinning, soaring with anger,
feeling ripped off for all those lies
I'd believed for so many years. I
started the long process of releas-
ing myself from religious and edu-
cational propaganda, and began to
feel a power within myself for the
first time.

she kept the struggle alive, she pol-
iticized prisoners and refused the
pardon offered to her under the con-
dition that she would never be in-
volved or take part in the struggle—
to pledge her allegiance to the rap-
ist of our nation.

Lolita Lebrón is now "free;" un-
beaten, unbroken, stronger and more
beautiful than ever, ready to sacri-
fice what's left of her life for her
country and ideals.

Viva Puerto Rico Libre,

MARCH 1, 1954: PUERTO RICAN NATION-
ALISTS LED BY LOLITA LEBRÓN ATTACK
CONGRESS IN AN EFFORT TO CALL ATTEN-
TION TO PUERTO RICO'S COLONIAL STATUS.

Effect

My first memory of a book that
influenced me was A Tree Grows in
Brooklyn. It was one of the few
books that I either remember or
actually finished. Later I realized
that this was so because the story
was told through the eyes of a
young girl. She felt the things I
felt and I could find through her
an entry point into a story of
deep human relationships and the
struggle to love and grow in very
hard times.

The one thing that I can think of, off-hand, that has influenced me
and my life culturally, was the Women in Print Conference in Omaha. That
conference was the first time that I began to realize that I did have po-
litics, that my thoughts and ideas were both valid and valuable, and that
the criticism of my ideas or actions was done from caring and growing ra-
ther than a cut telling me I was shit.

The women from NannyGoat were sup-
portive of my artwork. Other women who were there helped me to define my
politics and really begin to understand the feminist concepts of crit/
self-crit and “sisterhood,” things that had only been catchphrases before.

Woman-Consciousness

After many years as a “happy house-
wife," I returned to school to be-
come credentialed as a college teach-
er. My first job after graduation
was a one-year appointment as lec-
turer in the department of sociolo-
gy at the University of Michigan. I
was assigned full-time teaching duties
plus supervision of all senior theses,
a demanding job, especially consider-
ing that I had three children at home
(one a tiny baby) and had to commute
40 miles to work by bus. Several
young single men who did not yet
have their Ph.D.'s (I did) taught
only one or two courses ("to give
them time for research"), had no
extra duties, and were hired in per-
manent positions.

By the end of the year, I began
to understand that the department
did not intend to rehire me; even
though I had by then published sever-
al articles in "reputed journals" and
had good rapport with students, I
felt that I had failed somehow and
was even hesitant to tell others
(including students) that I had
not been offered a contract for the
following year. However, a group of
students figured out that I was
suffering discrimination as a woman,
that the prestigious department
had never hired a woman as anything
other than "temporary help." On
complaining to the department
staff (40 men), the students were
told that since many of the staff
had wives with Ph.D.'s in sociology,
all hell would break loose at home
if another woman was hired in the
department on a regular basis. At
this point, my woman-consciousness
grew by leaps and bounds.

Although we were unsuccessful in
breaking through the barriers to
employment of a woman at Ann Arbor
that year, I accepted a job at a
smaller school on condition that I
be allowed to initiate a course
in "sociology of women," something
that was unheard of at that time
(1967).

My identity as a woman. Wow! I
never thought about it really. I
mean my identifying myself to woman-
hood as such . . . not until to-
day, actually! I guess I always
spaced it out (when possible) - my
being a girl/woman that is. As a
child I always fought it - did my
damndest to be “one of the guys."
And usually succeeded. As child-
ren the boys would usually accept
me (or a girl) readily if I (she)
was as good or better than them.
But the adults! My mother! Constant-
ly reminding me that I was a girl,
therefore I should not be a jock,
should not deliver papers, should
not ride motorcycles, should not,
should not. . should not!! I al-
ways wondered why a set of nuts
and a penis had such power! They
had all the fun.

Why was I being punished - born
a girl - the most gross (grossest)
minority on earth! It wasn't fair.
I was mad! I fought it! It was
a losing battle - or so I thought.

After graduating from childhood
to womanhood (I'm not sure when),
I began to discover that women
were actually stronger than men -
physically (they are made to be
able to withstand more because it is
a necessity if they wish to bear
children), and emotionally (probab-
ly the same reason). If we want
the muscle power (ability to build
up large muscles) that men have,
we can have it! Simply go into
the lab and whip up a synthetic hor-
mone, and inject it, and bingo -
muscles! We can have what they
have and more - well almost! But...
can they inject a chemical into
their systems and be able to pro-
duce babies?

I never realized it until today,
but bearing children was the one
thing that influenced my identi-
fying myself as a woman. I loved
it - all of a sudden being a woman
was worth it all - the pain, the
hurt, the defeat. I wouldn't have
it any other way now. The whole
reason for my existence on this

A New Life

plane, in this dimension of time
was suddenly so obvious that I
no longer envied the amoeba or
earthworm for being asexual. I was
a woman and no man could ever ex-
perience the beauty of childbirth.
How sad!

I would probably have 20 child-
ren if money were no object and if
I didn't have to spend nine months
working up to each new life. But
I am satisfied now, and that's
what did it - the births of my beau-
tiful, very much loved and wanted
children.

In "their" reality I am a woman,
I can perceive that idea now, and
live it.

A poem

A new life - a new breath

In all its innocence!

So pure = So simple.
Seemingly in such a rush

to achieve - only to

fight the encounter

once it has reached.

And yet such a delicate grace
And naked radiance -

Such as I have never

dared to imagine

in all my wildest dreams

I could never conceive

the plain and simple beauty
of the very real and natural
birth of my very own child,
