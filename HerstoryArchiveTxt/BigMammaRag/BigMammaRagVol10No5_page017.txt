Laura Carlsen is a member of  
TERRA, a Denver feminist  
group which has 3 focuses of  
work: Native land rights, wo-  
men's reproductive issues,  
and anti-uranium industry.

On January 9-10 Women Organ-  
izing Women (WOW) of Kansas  
City, MO sponsored an educa-  
tional conference on sterilization abuse  
and population control. Des-  
pite Kansas City temperatures  
of 15 below, about 35 repre-  
sentatives of women's groups  
in the region attended. Most  
were members of the Reproduc-  
tive Rights National Network,  
(R2N2), including three reps  
from TERRA in Denver. The ed-  
ucational afforded the oppor-  
tunity to discuss Population  
Control programs, domestic  
and foreign, and began to  
analyze the threat they pose  
to women's reproductive  
rights and to the survival of  
targeted populations world-  
wide.

A slide show entitled "Room  
in the Circle: Sterilization  
Abuse and Population Control"  
provided the focal point of  
the educational. The show has  
been produced as an R2N2 pro-  
ject, funded in part by the  
Network and in part by pri-  
vate outlays. Pat Rush, a co-  
producer of the slideshow  
with Carole Travis, came to  
present the show and to field  
questions and hear comments.

The slide show runs 55 min.,  
includes hundreds of slides,  
and is the result of months  
of research. Originally, R2N2  
decided to produce a show  
that could be used to expose  
domestic sterilization abuse  
practices. It was to be one  
step in demonstrating a real  
commitment to the right of  
women to have children, often  
denied poor women, institu-  
tionalized women and women of  
color. The network felt a  
strong need to differentiate  
their politics from single-  
issue abortion rights activity.  
Increased public awareness of  
sterilization abuse continues  
to be important, despite the  
positive impact of the inform-  
ed consent regulations in the  
past few years. The regula-  
tions came about as a result  
of massive public outcry fol-  
lowing research and exposure  
of the issue by feminist  
groups and Native American  
women, in particular, Women  
of All Red Nations. Some pol-  
icymakers have indicated that  
they feel the regulations are no  
longer necessary and that  
they are a hindrance to upper  
class women who are seeking  
sterilization. They may soon  
come under attack and it will  
be necessary to defend them.  
The slide show represents a  
major step forward in our  
analysis of sterilization  
abuse and population control.  
Research into the issue re-  
veals a far more systematic  
and targeted program than the  
term "sterilization abuse"  
alone implies and points to  
the need to develop a global  
perspective. Feminists have  
come to understand that ster-  
ilization abuse in the U.S.  
predominates among the most  
powerless women. Reasons of-  
fered are myriad and only  
loosely connected: doctors  
seeking to make an extra buck  
through unnecessary surgery,  
or using poor women to teach  
more complicated procedures--  
whether warranted or not.  
Other factors include strong  
beliefs that a woman is too  
poor to be allowed to have  
more children--or too dumb,  
or too black, or whatever.  
These beliefs add up to the  
racist and classist motiva-  
tions of the guy holding the  
knife and the knowledge that  
they can act with relative  
impunity. Lack of pre- and  
post-natal health care, com-  
bined with government poli-  
cies which pay for steriliza-  
tion costs but not childrear-  
ing or abortion are also sig-  

Sterilization Abuse & Population Control

nificant factors that chan-  
nel women into sterilization  
"decisions".

The case studies of Native  
American women and Puerto  
Rican women presented in the  
slideshow cast a new light on  
the issue. By 1976, 25% of  
all Native women and 35% of  
all Puerto Rican women had  
been sterilized. Examining  
their history, demographic  
statistics, and U.S. imperia-  
list aims elucidate an under-  
lying motivation to decimate  
a people. These women are not  
only powerless as individuals  
--they are victims of geno-  
cidal attacks on their cul-  
tures.

Let me back up to define  
terms. When we use the term  
population control we are  
not simply talking about lim-  
iting the numbers of a given  
people. P.C. programs are  
planned, funded and carried  
out by the United States  
government, and others at  
times, and private founda-  
tions, without the consent of  
the people, often without  
their being adequately infor-  
med of the drugs or proce-  
dures being used, and without  
alternatives. Coercive prac-  
tices may range from the  
black woman who enters the  
county hospital for an appen-  
dicitis and leaves with a  
hysterectomy, to the Thai wo-  
man who is offered a chicken  
to feed her family “in return  
for" a shot of Depo Provera.

To say that these women are  
victims of population control  
policies implies that "the  
Powers That BE" (and exposing  
these is a major emphasis of  
the slide show) have an over-  

all plan for their lives and  
their property. This is amply  
proven in the case of both  
Puerto Rican and Native Ameri-  
can people. Native Americans  
hold vast mineral deposits  
which are becoming more and  
more coveted (e.g., 44 uranium  
claims on the Black Hills) by  
the U.S. government and ener-  
gy corporations. U.S. plans  
for Puerto Rico include divid-  
ing the country into mining  
and manufacturing districts--  
a plan which demands very  
little labor. U.S. officials  
are very open about the role  
of population control in pro-  
tecting national security  
(ours) and "stabilizing"  
oppressive regimes abroad.

Few of us would condone  
such practices, but many of  
us have a favorable reaction  
to the idea of population  
control. Suffocation of the  
planet under an ever-increas-  
ing burden of human beings,  
desecrated wilderness, deple-  
ted resources and catastro-  
phic world wars are the apo-  
calyptic consequences we often  
associate with overpopulation.  
Few of us would deny that  
sheer population growth is or  
could be a problem for the  
planet. However, consider  
that although a white couple  
may decide to have their 2.1  
children as a personal com-  
mitment, programs to limit  
childbearing are invariably  
aimed at the poor and women  
of color. They are considered  
a "self-help" stipulation on  
foreign aid oftentimes. But  
why are these people poor?  
Because there aren't enough  
resources to go around? This  
contention is highly debate-  
able. Furthermore, in a  
country, typical in Central  
America, for example, where  
a few families own up to 50%  
of the arable land, the ques-  
tion is irrelevant. Consider  
also how many people could be  
fed with the money of a Rock-  
efeller, or a tiny fraction  
of a 1.5 trillion dollar de-  
fense budget. Fears of a  
"population explosion" mask  
problems caused by the mal-  
distribution and misuse of  
resources under capitalism.  
The slideshow illustrates  
much of how the ideology and  
practice of P.C. serves an  
oppressive status quo, both  
here and abroad.

This is nothing new. Eugen-  
ics and population control  
ideas run as an unbroken .
