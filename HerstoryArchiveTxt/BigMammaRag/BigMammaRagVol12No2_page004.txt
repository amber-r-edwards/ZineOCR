odd visit from clergymen  
and Thursday night Bingo,  
which I find boring.  

My personal clothing was  
forcibly taken from me when  
I was admitted. I have worn  
pyjamas, housecoat and slip-  
pers for 18 days now. This  
is considered a form of  
punishment.  

Although mouthwash, tooth  
cleaner and denture recep-  
tacles are available, I've  
never seen any of them used -  
night, morning - or any other

"As a geriatric, it's as-  
sumed that you have lost all  
interest in living and have  
lost the capacity to think.  
Using age (alone) as a cri-  

time. Maybe three patients  
(out of 45) can and do take  
care of their own mouth and  
teeth.  

Patients are ushered to  
the dining area, always well  
before the time of meals. At  
the other end of the stick,  
trays are removed from pati-  
ents while they are still  

drugging of the elderly  

criterion is extreme discrimin-  
ation," says Evelyn, a 73  
year old widow with numer-  
ous readmissions to psychi-  
atric institutions.  

Judged incompetent by psy-  
chiatrists to handle her  
finances, Evelyn was admitted  
as a voluntary patient to  
the psychogeriatric ward at  
the Queen Street Mental  
Health Centre in Toronto.  
The staff refused to inform  
her of her legal status and  
rights. No help was given  
by her doctors, ward nurses,  
or the Ontario government to  
obtain the legal and medi-  
cal aid she requested.  

Excerpts from a diary she  
kept during 1978-79 while  
institutionalized follow:  

Patients are handled, fed  
and moved about roughly...  
pushed and forced to walk  
faster than they normally  
are capable of doing...for-  
cibly placed in their chairs.  

Many are spoon-fed. In  
some instances, this consists  
of staff pushing full spoon-  
fuls of food into the pa-  
tient's mouth and not all-  
owing time to chew or swal-  
low.  

The patients’ rooms are  
locked at 6:30 a.m. and not  
opened until 8:00 every  
night... Patients are herd-  
ed like sheep into two sit-  
ting rooms for thirteen  
hours. There is nowhere to  
go to escape violent or ver-  
y disturbed patients to re-  
lax, read or write letters  
or just be quiet.  

Being on the geriatric  
ward means: no reading mat-  
erial, no newspapers, no  
books, no games, no hobbies  
or crafts. We have no vol-  
unteer visitors or enter-  
tainers, except possibly the  

eating. Some patients are  
spoon-fed, others have their  
trays taken from them without  
having had a bit of food.  

I'm usually awakened at  
11:00 p.m. by the ruckus  
and noisy behaviour of staff  
at shift-change. This parti-  
cular morning I was awakened  
at 2:20 a.m....one staff  
member opened my door and  
shouted, "Aw, shit!", then  
closed it.  

I saw my psychiatrist to  
try to find out my legal sta-  
tus in the hospital. When I  
asked him, he told me he did  
not know.  

I learned that while "in-  
formal" (voluntary), I should  
not be on a locked ward and  
should have "out" privileges  
at all reasonable times.  

Now I'd like answers to  
these questions.  

1. Why was my name not placed  
before the legal aid inter-  
viewer at a much earlier  
time? Eleven days elapsed  
between the time I first  
requested legal aid and when  
I received information on  

how to proceed. I have com-  
plied by stating my financial  
position and submitting the  
names of three lawyers.  

2. Why am I being held on a  
locked ward if this is not  
consistent with my status?  

3. Why am I not receiving  
medical assistance (for an  
arthritic condition and  
swollen foot)?  

It was only due to her  
personal struggles, and the  
help of a law student when,  
appearing before the Review  
Board, that Evelyn was able  
to leave the institution  
with her competence rating  
re-established.  

An unpublished Canadian  
study by Edison Sussman (A

cal student working under  
the supervision of Dr. Hurst  
of Mt. Sinai Hospital) re-  
veals that the tranquilizers  
routinely given in nursing  
homes are the ones most like-  
ly to cause damage to seniors.  
Sussman says that tardive  
dyskinesia (a generally  
permanent and irreversible  
condition of the nervous  
system characterized by awk-  
ward and restless involun-  
tary movements of the face,  
hands and sometimes the  
whole body) occurs with a-  
larming frequency in older  
people who have had pro-  
longed (6 months) treatment  
with phenothiazines, the  
most common psychiatric  
drugs...he expresses concern

those who suffer from Parkin-  
son's disease.  

A 1980 study published in  
the American Journal of Pub-  
lic Health found consistent  

misuse of psychiatric drugs  

in nursing homes. Reviewing  
prescriptions in 173 nursing  
homes in one state, the stu-  
dy found that 43% of all pa-  
tients received major tran-  
quilizers and 9% of this  
group received them every  

day of the year. 81% of these  
anti-psychotic drugs were  
prescribed by general prac-  
titioners with a large num-  
ber of nursing home patients.  
The larger the home, the more  
mind-altering drugs were pre-  
scribed. Chemical control  
keeps costs down by requiring  
fewer staff to interact with  
difficult patients. This  

problem especially affects  

women, since they live long-  
er and make up about 3/4 of  
the nursing home population.  
Thus the tendency of women  
to receive about twice as  
many mood-changing drugs as  
men throughout their lives  
continues in the nursing  
home. In addition, an adver-  
tising campaign has been  
launched by the major drug  
companies, who have a big

One woman's experience, as  
told to the House Select  
Committee on Aging in the  
United States, was published  
in June 1980 by the New York  
Times.  

In May 1974 Esther Stanley,  
who was then in her late se-  
venties, in good health, and  
self-sufficient, fell and  
fractured her pelvis. She  
was admitted to a nursing  
home in California and placed  
on a daily regime of medica-  
tion that included tranquil-  
izers, an anti-depressant  
and a sleeping pill. In less  
than a month, Mrs. Stanley's  
condition had deteriorated  
to the point that a medical  
report described her as  
"confused", "paranoid" and  
"not capable of being left  
alone." She was declared  
mentally incompetent. Mrs.  
Stanley's daughter decided  
to take her out of the nurs-  
ing home, away from the med-  
ication. Mrs. Stanley, who  
has recovered her physical  
and mental health, now lives  
in her own apartment and is  
active in community affairs!  

The committee was told by  
numerous witnesses that the  
amount of drugs prescribed
