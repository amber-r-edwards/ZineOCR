One Woman's Way Of Fighting Racism

(Collective Note: The fol-
lowing interview is reprint-
ed from the November, 1981
issue of The Lesbian Insider
Insighter Inciter. Kim Hines
is a Black playwright, di-
rector, actor, graphic ar-

women's heads. I decided that
I would use the book or parts
of it in the show and do it
through the context of this
white woman taking a class
in Women Studies on racism in
America. And her feelings and
other people's feelings with-
in the class, and there's only

tist, typesetter in Minnea-
polis. Her play, Just Remem-
ber My Name, was performed
recently at At the Foot of
the Mountain Theater in
Minneapolis.)

Eleanor: I know you're di-
recting a play that's going
to be at A Woman's Coffee-
house in November based on
writings from This Bridge
Called My Back. . .

Kim: Partly. I've used the
book as a springboard. When
the book came out, when it
hit Minneapolis, all these
women were reading it and
saying, "Hey have you read
this book, you've got to
read it." And then Amy Lange
from the Coffeehouse read
the book and called me up

and said, “Say why don't you
do a show on that and pre-
sent it at the coffeehouse."

Well I still hadn't gotten a
copy of it. We'd go to places
and it would be sold out of
the book. And someone gave me
their copy and I read it and
said, "Yeah, this is a mar-
velous book, and for once
third world women are being
portrayed as intellectual

and being able to portray
their views and feelings

very well.” And I read the
book, liked it a lot, and
then started thinking, "How
could one go about present-
ing this to a white audi-
ence?" I mean I don't want to
sound as though I think white
people are stupid or anything
like that, but unless you've
had experiences of being a
minority, or experiences of
being discriminated against
all your life, living with it
every day, you don't under-
stand the subtlety of racism.
So this whole book is the
epitome of subtlety in ra-
cism. I wouldn't be able to
do just a staged readers
theater type of thing. Be-
cause I think the gist of
what these women are talking
about would go over the white

going to be two Black women
in the class.

I think this is very rep-
resentative of the number of
minority women who take those
kinds of classes at a univer-
sity, most of the time there
aren't any at all. So it's
going to be very interesting.
I've solicited writings from
people asking them for their
experiences as far as racism
goes, and I'm going to in-
corporate them into the
script. And I've incorporated
a lot of my feelings and ex-
periences that have happened
to me.

Eleanor: What are your feel-
ings about the fact that a
white Lesbian asked you to
present this to what will
probably be primarily a
white audience? It feels
like you're doing a lot of
educating of white women.
Kim: That's very true. The
funny thing about this, Amy
Lange is Jewish. I don't con-
sider Jews white. That's my
thing because that's the
way I was brought up because

they were discriminated ag-
ainst because of their be-
liefs and because of their
features too, so I've never
thought of them as being
white, some of them anyway,
which is a strange phenomenon
to me. It is educating a lot
of people, but it's also a
soapbox for me to get a lot
of my feelings across because
I've dealt in the women's
community now for 2-1/2 years
and sometimes I get so frus-
trated with some of the stuff
that goes down that I don't
want to have anything to do
with any of the women. And
sometimes I'll get into dis-
cussions with white women and
I just have to shake my head
because some of them are so
ignorant and insensitive to
people of color. They keep
pointing their finger at
their male counterparts and
keep talking about how op-

pressive they are. And they
don't realize how oppressive
they are. So there are so
many things that just anger
me, and I figure at least af-
ter I get it said people
can't say "well you didn't
say anything." I'm just using
a form in which to get it
across. And it's got to be
the most painless way of get-
ting it across other than
burning down cities and phys-
ically harming people, which
is what I feel like doing.
Sometimes I feel the ignor-
ance is so deep.

Eleanor: The educating pro-
cess must take a lot out of
you. Does it feel worth it?
Kim: Sometimes. When someone
comes up to me afterward and
says "you know, after seeing
your show I have to admit I'm
really aware that I do that."
It isn't much, but at least
I've made them aware of the

problem, and you have to be
aware of the problem before
you can do something about
it. If you don't know it

even exists, then how can you
remedy the situation? If
you're hurting you've got

to speak up and say that
you're hurting because peo-
ple can't read your mind.
That's something I've found
out. Just because I'm Black
doesn't mean they automati-
cally know how I feel. I
have to make that known.
That's my responsibility.

You get tired of that espec-
ially when they don't listen,
or they listen to my show
which lasts an hour and a
half and that's all the lis-
tening they're going to do
for the whole year. I mean
they listen an hour and a
half on one day and forget
about it the whole rest of
the year. You have to keep
reminding people, all of our
society is like that, you
have to keep reminding peo-
ple that there are people
that are way down here, we're
not all way up here. Look at
the government. They keep
making decisions that are
definitely affecting low-
income minority people and
just forgetting that we even
exist. I think that's a real
good example of the deroga-
tory word for Blacks--"spook."
We're invisible, you can't
see us.

Eleanor: Do you get support
from the women of color
around here for the things
that you're doing, do you
get energy back for the ener-
gy you're putting out?

Kim: Yes I do. The first night
we did "A Soul's A-Comin" (a
staged reading compiled and
directed by Kim about Black
Lesbians and their rela-
tionships with white women-
ed.), there were two Black
women in the whole place

and the place was packed.

Through Education, Action And The Arts

The second night the first
2-1/2 rows were women of
color. And gosh was that
ever a nice feeling. It was
a wonderful feeling. They
were Black, Native American,
a couple of Asian women,
there was a woman from India,
Hispanic women, and I felt
real good about that. Just
the way they responded to
certain sections of that
speech "Whatchou Mean We,
White Girl," everyone could
relate to that.

People were coming up to
me afterward and saying "girl
I know what you was talking
about because that happens
to me all the time, they're
always coming up to me and
wanting me to be their little
token on this committee or
that committee, and then when
I start telling it like it
is, the white girls--" You
know it's real strange but I
think within the Black com-
munity we don't necessarily
think of white women as women
because a lot of them are be-
ing taken care of by husbands
or this and that, and also for
such a long time white women
didn't have to work. And it's
like when Black women went in-
to the white women's homes to
cook and clean and cater their
parties and watch their kids,
hey it was like taking care
of a child. And I'll listen
to my relatives talking about
whites and they'll say, “Oh
you know that white girl" and
I'll think they're talking
about a teenager and they'll
be talking about someone 30
or 40 years old. So when you
think of that concept being
juxtaposed with one of the
Black men always being called
boys when they were anything
but, you know.

Eleanor: I know at the Take
Back the Night March a lot

of third world women felt
very alienated. Could you
talk about your experience
there?

Kim: Well they brought me in
on the march real late in the
session. They had gotten a
group of women together to
sing. And they knew that
their little contribution to
the rally was going to be on
international oppression,
dealing with oppression all
over the world. And one of
the workers that worked in the
fields, tobacco plantations
or whatever they're called,
and the other songs they
hadn't picked and they had
like eight minutes to fill. A
couple of women asked if I
wouldn't mind coming and di-
recting and picking a couple
of other songs. So I said,
"Since this program is on
women working in rural coun-
tries, working in the fields,
I'll throw in a West African
work song," and the other I
felt they should do was a
modern Black spiritual called

“This Storm is Passing Over.”
And it talks about being in
the thick of the storm, and

the next morning when the
light appears and you've weath-
ered the storm.

The groups didn't seem to
object to any of the music
and we learned it all, and
then a week before the rally,
some members of WAVAW came
and saw our program to crit-
ique it and tell us if it was
too long or too short, and
they heard this song and
they wanted it out. Basically
because of this word "God."
The line was: "Thanks be to
God/The morning light ap-
pears." One woman was talking
about how it was going to
offend the women out in the
audience; now I assume she
was talking about white
women. And I didn't say a
whole lot except, "So what
are you suggesting here?" and
a couple of women said that
they wanted the word changed
to Goddess. A couple thought
we could drop the word comp-
letely, and some thought we
should drop the song entirely
and I got to thinking about
it and I said that if they
were going to drop the song
I wouldn't be a part of it,
and I wouldn't change the
word to Goddess or drop the
word because it messed up the
line of the song.

So the week of the rally I

met with this other commit-
tee and we talked about it,
and there were six or seven
women, and all of them had
read the words to the song
and they said it didn't

bother them, all except the
two women who said they

didn't want the song

many women, and this meeting
lasted about an hour and I
didn't say anything about the
first 45 minutes and I wasn't
asked directly to say any-
thing.

And one other Black woman,
a Jewish woman and a white
woman came from our group.
And the Jewish woman and I
had talked about it prior to
this and she said she could
understand why I didn't want
the song cut, and that if the
song was cut I didn't want to
be a part of it. I said "This
is not a religious issue,
this is a cultural issue."
She could understand that
beautifully because she's
Jewish and their culture is
very much wrapped up in their
religion. That's what kept
them going. Same with the
Blacks here. Our religion
kept us going in America. I
can't imagine too many Black
people growing up here and
not knowing what church is
about.

What finally spurred me in-
to talking was when one woman
yelled at me, “I refuse to
worship some little white
boy." And I thought to myself
we have really hit rock bot-
tom here, this is too typical.
So I said very calmly, "I

didn't make you go to church,
and I had nothing to do with
your experiences. And you
didn't have anything to do
with mine. We had two diff-
erent experiences from two
different cultures. What makes
you think God was a white
boy? It is through God that my people have sur-
vived, it is God that brought
us through. You want me to
call it like it is; this is
racism. You-all sitting up
there and saying that white
women are going to be
offended by the word God.
Well honey, I don't care.
I'm offended by the fact that
you don't have any Black wo-
men on your committee. I'm
offended that you're asking
me to change and rearrange
myself to fit your conception
of what this whole thing
should be about. How can I be
in a program about oppression
and be oppressed at the same
time? It doesn't make any
kind of sense."

And they started thinking
about it and decided, yeah it
might be racism. And one wo-
man said, ‘Your experiences
of God must be a whole lot
different than mine, just
from talking to you,' and I
said, "What I've been
through is different."
