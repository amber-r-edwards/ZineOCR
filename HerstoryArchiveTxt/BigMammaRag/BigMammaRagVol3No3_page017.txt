Woman As...

and men prisoners practically
end here and this ending is
directly due to the sexism of
the patriarchy.

Laws themselves are based
on two different standards of
morality and behavior and
these built-in sex biases
determine the kinds of crimes
a woman is sentenced for and
the length of her sentence.
For example, a woman may be
prosecuted for prostitution
while her male solicitor is
rarely if ever taken to task.

In an article by Marie-An-
dree Bertrand entitled, “The
Myth Of Sexual Equality
Before the Law,” she con-
cludes that women are treated
more severely or more leni-
ently according to the social
value threatened by the
offense. A teenage woman,
for example, may be prose-
cuted for a crime such as
promiscuity while a young
man may often be charged
with crimes against property
such as vandalism or car
theft. He is prosecuted for an
offense against capitalism.
She is prosecuted for an
offense against the patriar-
chy.

Oftentimes, a woman will
be sentenced more harshly
than a man would be for the
same offense because the
misbehavior of women with
regard to certain crimes (such
as burglary or murder) is
considered more serious.
She, being a woman and the
so-called guardian of the
threatening the
entire fabric of society when

she behaves as violently as
men do. (Consequently, she is
locked up to relearn her
woman’s role which she has
stepped out of in this way.)
The kinds of crimes which
women do actually commit
most often are usually direct-
ed inward at themselves. In
the FBI’s Uniform Crime
Reports these crimes are
listed as theft, forgery,
prostitution, narcotics,
drunkenness, and disorderly
conduct. “Not only are these
the more subtle (more “femin-
ine”) forms of criminal behav-
ior, they are also the least
destructive of other persons
and property. Four of these
crimes are also referred to as
“crimes without victims”—
other than the doer. Women
are socialized to be passive,
to direct their energies in-
wards, towards themselves.
Therefore women, instilled
with a negative sense of self
(or no sense of self at all)
often turn to drugs and
alcohol for escape. For this,
women are either locked up in
a prison or more frequently
confined to mental institu-
tions.

Once a woman has been
sentenced for any crime,
however, she is incarcerated
in an institution whose
primary purpose centers a-
round imposing and reinforc-
ing her typical feminine role.
What the outside patriarchal

world thinks she should be is
carried out as law within —

the institution itself. Also,
because there are fewer

women in prison than men
and because it is generally
considered more important
that men be “rehabilitated,”
the little money which is
available for institutions us-
ually goes to the men.
Consequently, financial aid
for women’s programs is
relatively sparse.

The money which is availa-
ble to women’s prisons often
goes toward teaching the
women certain vocations
which reinforce her stereo-
typed role and also are
practically useless to her in
surviving once she does get
released. At both Canon City
and the Denver County Jail,
for example, the women learn
(as if they didn’t already know
in the first place) to work in
the kitchen or in the laundry,
to sew, crochet, and knit, and
to do each other's hair! At
Canon City, women may also
learn clerical skills and there
is opportunity to get a high
school education, but at

Denver County the opportuni-
ty to get a high school degree
is sporadic,

depending on

whether a volunteer (from the
Opportunity School) is availa-
ble to teach the women.
Classes for women are few at
Canon City and non-existent
at Denver County.

At both prisons (and they
are by no means atypical of
women's prisons all over the
country) the emphasis again
is on reinforcing passivity.
Women are always referred to
as the “girls”—symbolizing
powerlessness, child-like
qualities, dependence etc. ad
nauseum.

Description and analysis of
women’s prisons and the
attitudes surrounding them
has been necessarily abridged
in this article because of
space limitations. A lot more
thought and action needs to
be focused on this area and in
the future BMR hopes to be
running more articles about
women in prison.

As Rhetta Alexander stated
so well in her article on
“Women of the Convicted
Class,” in a society which, in
addition to being racist and
exploitative, is sexist, the

laws, courts, and prisons
must be examined and chal-
lenged... Let me briefly
remind the reader that the
question of who will act is
crucial and is what has led to
the formation of independent
autonomous movements for
liberation. Everyone can talk
about oppression, but only
those most immediately af-
fected and committed will
actually seize the time and
know how and when to move
on their own liberation.”
