Prison Lawsuits Allege Discrimination

Woodwoman

Two separate lawsuits have
been filed by inmates and cor-
rection officers at the Bedford
Hills Correctional Facility, New
York State's only women's
prison. The lawsuits allege dis-
crimination against women.

In mid-October, five inmates
charged the State Department of
Correctional Services with fail-
ure to provide community-based
work-release facilities equal to
those available to men. New
York State prisoners may enter a
work-release program when
they are within one year of
parole eligibility.

NYC or Bust

The inmates' suit charges that
the only work-release facility for
women is located in New York
City, whereas there are nine
such facilities for men dis-
tributed throughout the state.
Thus women who wish to take
advantage of the program may
only do so if they are prepared to
relocate to New York City. The
women are all upstate residents.

The second suit was filed by
17 provisional correction of-
ficers at the prison. They said
that the Department of Cor-
rectional Services had dis-
criminated against female cor-
rection officers by not allowing
them to take an examination
which would qualify them to be-
come permanent employees.

Men Only

In their class-action suit, the
officers claim that they were not
allowed to take a Civil Service
examination because it was
available to men only. As a re-
sult, they remained on a
provisional list until June, when
they received lay-off notices
from the State Department of
Correctional Services. They say
that they took the same training
course as male officers, and that
four of them took a Civil Service
examination in January and
received high grades.

The State Supreme Court
granted a temporary restraining
order, and in October a pre-
liminary injunction was issued,
enjoining the state from dis-
missing the women.

Birth Control Advocate Fired

New York (FPS/LNS) 
Rebecca Dawson, recently nam-
ed Maryland's ‘newspaper ad-
visor of the year,’ was removed
from her position as advisor of
the Snow Hill student news-
paper, ‘The Eagle,’ after articles
on birth control and teenage
pregnancies appeared in the
paper.

Dawson, who also teaches
French at the small Worcester
County school, was replaced be-
cause of what the school prin-
cipal described as ‘a great deal
of reaction’ to the controversial
issue of the paper. The principal
said that if he had seen the
reports on students' surveys on
contraception before they were
published, he would not have
approved them.

Sex Discrimination Suit Won

New York (LNS) — A woman
who was fired from her position
as a magazine managing editor
when she refused to double as a
switchboard operator was
recently awarded $2000 in com-
pensatory damages.

Bonnie Leighland, 26, began
working in February 1974 as a
managing editor trainee for the
Universal Publishing and Dis-
tributing Corporation of New
York City. Three months later
she was named Managing Editor
of “Galaxy” and “Worlds of If,”
two science fiction magazines.

Later that year, the com-
pany’s Vice President cir-
culated a memo stating that
Leighland would be required to
operate the switchboard in addi-
tion to her other respon-
sibilities. Leighland refused to
comply on the grounds that male
employees in the company in
similar positions were not re-
quired to operate the switch-
board. She was fired on
September 6, 1974.

The New York State Division of
Human Rights investigated
Leighland’s case and judged in
her favor. Before the case was
scheduled for a public hearing,
Leighland settled with the com-
pany for a compensation pay-
ment of $2000, and agreed not
to seek further employment with
Universal.

Heart Attacks Linked to Pill Use

(Majority — 
New York Report/LNS) — Oral contracep-
tives may significantly increase
the chances of fatal heart at-
tacks among women over 40, ac-
cording to two recent British
studies. The risk is four times
greater for pill users compared
to non-pill users.

It is already known that the pill
causes increased blood clotting.

The U.S. Food and Drug Ad-
ministration has said that it will
recommend that women over 40
years old be urged to adopt other
forms of contraception.

Of an estimated ten million
American women who use the
pill, the number of over-40 users
is unknown.

domination over women so
deeply embedded in the system
that it will take more than super-
ficial reforms to change it. She
criticizes liberals who won't
tolerate “nigger” jokes which
perpetuate the degrading myths
of black inferiority, but who at
the same time maintain that the
hatred and contempt of women
expressed in obscenity and
pornography are valid exten-
sions of freedom of speech.
She feels that having more
women on police departments
will help oppose a masculine
ideology of rape, and that laws
which reflect a “female reality”
will help eliminate crimes of
sexual violence. But, she con-
tinues, the last line of defense
will be our female bodies and our
female minds. Women need to
be more aggressive, to
strengthen their bodies and thus
their minds to resist the “dis-
torted masculine philosophy of
aggression.” But, I feel, part of
that philosophy of aggression is
intrinsic to human sexuality —
heterosexuality, that is — and
that is a subject that requires
another 472-page book.
