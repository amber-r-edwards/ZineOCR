Greyhound May Owe You Cash

If you applied in recent years
to be a Greyhound bus driver and were
rejected, check with the company to
see whether you have any money coming
to you in damages. A class action
is being brought against most western
divisions of Greyhound on behalf of
all women who have been turned down
for driving jobs in the last few
years. The company has agreed to
settle out of court, by paying
compensation to women who were affected
by discrimination and by enforcing
quotas in their training programs.

imagine That!

A panel which investigated the
FDA's procedure for approving or
disapproving drugs has recommended
that a special investigator be given
the task of conducting yet another
study. The issue arose when FDA
scientists testified before a Senate
Subcommittee on Health that FDA officials
harassed and punished them
when they recommended disapproval of
a drug, while accepting without
question approval of a drug.

Dykes Hit Churches

On July 4, 1976, Dykes for an
Amerikan Revolution (a lesbian feminist
organization born of the Philadelphia
group Dyketactics) staged
demonstrations at churches in wealthy
Philadelphia neighborhoods, to protest
against the church and state for
their role in the oppression of lesbians
and all women. The protests
incorporated guerilla theater, slow-
motion walking, witch rituals and the
reading of the Lesbian Feminist Declaration
of 1976, a document written

crimes against women and proclaiming
international women's solidarity.

Bookstore Vandalized

EMMA, the Buffalo women's bookstore,
was attacked late in August.

believes the attack to be the
work of people who are threatened by
the women's movement and by people's
liberation struggles generally. The
women are asking their supporters to
help defend the bookstore against
further attacks. EMMA is located at
2223 Fillmore Avenue in Buffalo

Betty Friedan told a Women's
Equality Day rally in Boston that the
women's movement must move to a new
stage - away from symbolic marches
and rallies and into “hard political
action."

Northwest Passage, Bellingham, Wa.

Despite laws against sex discrimination,
“open housing" still isn't open
to women, according to a recent report
funded by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development. Housing discrimination
against women “historically has
been overt," says the report, but
“today it is increasingly subtle,
disguised by ruses, or hidden behind
superficially neutral criteria such as
marital status."

will have on nursing babies.
