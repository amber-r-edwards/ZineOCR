Three Sister Smear

Three sisters who say they  
were seized by “sunshine and  
the Holy Spirit" were arrested  
in Lansing, Michigan last  
month. The women stripped  
naked, smeared themselves with  
mustard and relish and drove  
off in a United Parcel Service  
van. Officers located the  
women in front of the police  
station in the United Parcel  
van which had been reported  
missing a short time earlier.

The three were charged with  
indecent exposure and joy  
riding.

Biting Birthday

An Ohio man has been sen-  
tenced to 10 days in jail and  
fined $250 for biting a woman  
on the thigh in a bar last  
December. Witnesses testified  
that Patrick Culhane, a senior  
at John Carroll University,  
bit Claudia Steckler on her  
left thigh. Culhane testified  
that he had been drinking  
heavily in celebration of  
his 23rd birthday and did not  
knowingly injure the woman.

Project Intercept

In an effort to cut the  
welfare rolls, the Reagan  
administration has proposed  
a new program called "Project  
Intercept." Project Intercept  
is a child support enforcement  
program that proposes with-  
holding the tax refunds of  
parents who are delinquent in  
making child support payments.  
A parent's failure to make  
support payments can result in  
the government paying welfare  
benefits, Medicaid and other  
costs. Under this program,  
the Internal Revenue Service  
would be given the power to  
withhold certain refund checks.

Reagan budget director,  
David Stockman says that the  
key element of the program is  
that taxpayers' fear of the  
IRS would prompt them to pay  
child support.

Diplomatic Porno

Sir Peter Hayman, former  
British high commissioner to  
Canada was identified by a  
member of Parliament as the  
diplomat involved in a child  
pornography scandal.

Neighbors and business  
colleagues of the 66-year-old  
said they were stunned.

Conservative Party members  
demanded to know if the na-  
tion's security had been im-  
paired by Hayman's interest in  
pornography and his links to  
a pedophilia group campaigning  
to legalize sex with  
children. However, "a full  
investigation...revealed  
nothing to suggest that secur-  
ity had been prejudiced."

Police found 45 diaries  
cataloging 6 years of "sex-  
ual fantasies" with children  
and activities with prosti-  
tutes. When police confronted  
Hayman, he "broke down and  
cried."

Upright Christians?

Two men convicted of stomp-  
ing on and killing a lesbian  
in an effort to "exorcise"  
her sexual preference have  
been sentenced to three  
years each in prison by a  
court in London, England.

The court changed a murder  
charge to manslaughter in  
the killing of Beatrix  
Rutherford, on the grounds  
that the two had not meant  
to harm her. The judge in  
the case referred to the  
accused as "two upright  
Christians" and sentenced  
them to three years each on  
the lesser charge.

Hot Fertilizer

Remember Kerr-McGee, Karen  
Silkwood's employer? Now the  
uranium mining corporation has  
been using atomic waste to  
fertilize cattle feed. The  
corporation is reportedly plan-  
ning to market this radioactive  
fertilizer commercially.

Kerr-McGee has been using  
the waste from its Sequoyah,  
Oklahoma, uranium processing  
plant which has a high-nitro-  
gen content to fertilize grass  
fodder. A spokesperson said that  
salt is added to the waste to  
reduce the level of radioac-  
tivity. The company maintains that  
the fertilizer is safe be-  
cause tests on some of the  
slaughtered animals gave them  
a “clean bill of health."

Toronto Gay Raid

On February 5, more than 150  
police raided every major gay  
bath in Toronto, Canada,  
arresting 286 men, wreaking hav-  
oc with sledgehammers and crow-  
bars, beating people and sub-  
jecting them to fascist taunts  
such as "Too bad the showers  
weren't hooked up to gas."

The following midnight, 3,000  
protestors took to the streets  
in militant protest, confront-  
ing squads of police and bat-  
tering down the doors of the  
Ontario legislature.

Senior Saints Say...

Members of the Senior Saints,  
an affiliate of Jerry Falwell's  
Thomas Road Baptist Church,  
have been drafting legislation  
that will call for motels lo-  
cated on interstate highways  
to rent rooms only to those  
couples who are legally mar-  
ried.

“Nobody has the right to  
fornicate in the face of the  
Lord!" one of Falwell's people  
reasoned.

The plan is for the Depart-  
ment of Health and Human Ser-  
vices to issue marriage cards  
that will be shown to motel  
clerks, much as voter regis-  
tration cards are shown at pol-  
ling places.

One member of the Senior  
Saints said recently, “High-  
way motels just give out rooms  
to anyone who comes in off the  
road, people walking in like  
two stray dogs in heat... If  
two men walk in and sign the  
register, that's all right,  
too. If two women come in and  
want to use the bed together,  
that's fine. Doesn't anybody  
care about it? God hates homo-  
sexuality!"

Straight Military

The Department of Defense  
issued a revision of its  
exclusionary policy towards  
lesbians and gay men. The  
new policy makes discharge  
for homosexuals mandatory,  
thereby targeting the small  
number of precedential suc-  
cesses established in the  
cases of Matlovich, Berg,  
and Ben-Shalom.

In the future, all ex-  
clusions and discharges solely  
on the basis of sexual orient-  
ation will be classified as  
honorable and “homosexual  
identity will no longer be  
determined by so-called  
homosexual mannerisms or  
through guilt by association."

Little ERA

The Miami Beach City Commis-  
sion unanimously approved an  
ordinance which gave their  
tourist-dependent city its  
own "Little ERA."

Although the commission  
cited the "evils of sex-  
discrimination," they also  
admitted that the city could  
lose $150 million worth of  
convention trade during the  
next seven years because of  
groups boycotting Florida  
over the ERA issue.

Making Gay Men

Novelist James Michener is  
claiming the women's movement  
is driving young men into join-  
ing homosexual communities.

Michener told an interviewer  
for Redbook magazine that he  
supports the feminist movement,  
but that he sees feminism hav-  
ing some unfortunate side  
effects. According to Michener,  
men are thinking twice about  
marrying liberated women, and  
are instead opting to live with  
other males.

Michener says, "I live on the  
edge of what might be called  
a homosexual capital--New Hope,  
Pennsylvania...but I'm not sure  
that they are all gay." "I've  
talked to a lot of them and  
the decision was often not a  
homosexual decision but the  
feeling that marriage had be-  
come too complicated to handle.  
I think women have made the  
marriage bit into a hoopla a  
lot of men see as phony and  
want no part of, and it means  
that a lot of fine young wo-  
men are not going to have  
husbands."

Bare Protest

Members of the University  
of Wisconsin women's crew  
team were not able to get  
their own dressing room  
until they staged a protest.  
The women changed their  
clothes outside of the  
University's Athletic  
Director's office to call  
attention to their problem.  
Their protest was covered by  
all three Madison TV stations.  
The women now have their own

Poverty-Stricken

Widows who lose their hus-  
bands while in their 50's  
are the most likely people to  
face sudden poverty in this  
country and the least likely  
to receive any financial  
help from the government.

According to Karen Bottar,  
a doctoral candidate in soc-  
ial sciences at Syracuse  
University, middle-aged  
widowhood can mean a 2/3  
drop in income. Black women  
experience the greatest fin-  
ancial change, with 42% of  
them reaching the poverty  
level upon widowhood. Stat-  
istics show that one in every  
two black women and one in  
every three white women become  
widows before age 60.

Bottar adds, "The problems  
facing widows are not likely  
to disappear under the Reagan  
Administration. Previous to  
this administration, there  
were a number of advisory  
reports, and all of them re-  
commended increases in social  
security for this younger  
widows' group."

Beauty Hazards

Despite the clean and  
safe image, beauticians and  
hairdressers face a number of  
significant hazards on the job.  
These include varicose veins  
from standing on your feet all  
the time as well as chemical-  
related illnesses.

Chemicals are found in  
permanent dyes, bleaches,  
aerosol sprays and permanent  
wave solutions and other pro-  
ducts. The most common health  
effects among beauticians are  
respiratory problems and skin  
problems. Some chemicals have  
more serious long-term effects.  
Coal tars found in hair dyes  
are known to cause cancer, as  
well as the asbestos in some  
hair dryers. Add to this the  
fact that beauticians face  
reproductive problems, such  
as high rates of miscarriage.

Toxic Shock Info

Women concerned about toxic  
shock syndrome can now get a  
free booklet on the disease  
from the Food and Drug Admin-  
istration.

The booklet, Toxic Shock And  
Tampons can be obtained from  
the Consumer Information Cen-  
ter, Department 6363, Pueblo,  
Colorado 81009.

16 Strikes A Day

Many people do not realize  
that every day there are work-  
ers on strike in the U.S. In  
1980, there were 4,000 strikes  
involving 1.4 million workers,  
or an average of 16 strikes  
every working day. Didn't  
hear about them in your daily  
news, did you?

Pill-Pushing RNs

The California State Board  
of Registered Nursing has  
taken an unprecedented move by  
declaring that nurses can pre-  
scribe medicine.

The landmark stand allows  
nurses to enter a realm that  
traditionally has been re-  
served for doctors. Under the  
new policy, the Board said that  
nurses will be allowed to  
prescribe medicines such as  
birth control pills and anti-  
biotics. The list of drugs  
they will be able to prescribe  
is expected to grow with time.

The move comes at a time when  
California is experiencing an  
unprecedented shortage of nur-  
ses.

Obeying The Lord

"I was obeying the good  
Lord's will. Down in my heart  
I don't think it's right," was  
the comment of Judge Felix  
Felton of Tuscumbia, Alabama  
when asked why he refused to  
issue a marriage license to a  
Black man and a white woman.  
A U.S. Attorney has accused  
the judge of contempt of  
court and seeks a citation  
against Judge Felton.

Brownie Mary

Mary Rathbun, known as  
"Brownie Mary" to the  
San Francisco police, has pleaded  
innocent to 10 felony counts  
of possessing and selling  
narcotics. Police say she  
put marijuana, hashish and  
psilocybin into brownies and  
sold them to supplement her  
income. A “Brownie Mary De-  
fense Fund" has been started  
by residents of Rathbun's  
neighborhood.

Kiddy Cosmetics

The toy industry is gearing  
up for big profits from kiddy  
cosmetics. At a recent Ameri-  
can Toy Fair in New York, at  
least half a dozen companies  
were showing make-up for child-  
ren. The companies said that  
the kiddie make-up was being  
targeted towards girls, ages  
7-9, who had outgrown dolls  
and needed something else to  
play with.

Sit By Your Man

Female country-western  
singers are no longer urging  
their fans to "stand by your  
man."

The New York Times reports  
that vocalists including  
Roseanne Cash, Carlene Carter,  
Emmylou Harris, Lacy Dalton  
and Dolly Parton are all sing-  
ing "progressive" ballads  
which challenge the subser-  
vient roles women have trad-  
itionally played in country  
music.

Roseanne Cash describes  
her new album as "the story of  
a woman whose man isn't treat-  
ing her right but who refuses  
to be a victim."

According to the newspaper,  
Emmylou Harris credits 50's  
singer Kitty Wells for helping  
open things up for female  
country singers. Says Harris,  
"By getting out there and  
singing about real life, Wells  
opened things up for women and  
here we all are today."

Armpit Of This  
Perverted Movement

Calling San Francisco "the  
Sodom and Gomorrah of the U.S.  
and the armpit of this pervert-  
ed movement," a coalition of  
fundamentalist groups says it  
will spend $3 million on a  
media campaign attacking gay  
people. The coalition will  
attempt to build anti-gay  
feelings in the community and  
persuade homosexuals to give  
up their lifestyle.

"I agree with capital  
punishment and I believe homo-  
sexuality is one of those that  
could be coupled with murder  
and other sins," said Dean  
Wycoff, a spokesperson for the  
Santa Clara Moral Majority,  
one of the groups involved in  
the campaign.
