ing day and told him about her  
self-examination,  
that what she had seen was a  
possible irritation of the cer-  
vix. He was freaked, but pro-  
ceeded to examine her and he  
was surprised (we weren't) to  
find that she did have “cervi-  
citis" (any irritation of the  
cervix). This would have a  
large effect on the bladder in-  
fection or could be a sign of  
some more serious infection  
such as gonorrhea. So although  
we cannot diagnose or prescribe,  
we teach each other awareness.  
There is a second reason we  
believe doctors are threatened.  
They need to maintain the eli-  
tist barrier between patient and  
physician and uphold their mys-  
tic powers. It is essential for  
them to hoard and guard their  
knowledge and to keep us ignor-  
ant. We've been told so many  
times "it won't hurt", "you  
can't really feel that way",  
"it's not serious", etc. that we  
begin to doubt ourselves rather  
than the doctor. They see us  
gaining power over our lives;

power which we must take from  
them. It's simply not supposed  
to be our jurisdiction to know  
or care about our own bodies.  

This kind of paranoia clear-  
ly shows in the recent bust at  
the L.A. Feminist Women's  
Health Center. Two women were  
arrested for teaching self  
health to other women. It is  
incredible that these men could  
try to stop us from taking con-  
trol of what should naturally  
belong to us.  

When we begin questioning  
what have been traditional  
practices for generations (such  
as forced sterilization or un-  
necessary removal of reproduc-  
tive genital organs) and when  
we begin demanding gentleness,  
knowledge and control (self  
help, patient advocacy, abor-  
tion on demand) then they show  
us with force (i.e. arrest)  
that it will not be tolerated.  

Women must show solidarity;  
we must continue to learn more  
about all areas of our own  
health; we must teach each other  
whatever skills we learn. We  
in Colorado Springs are ready  
to do whatever is necessary to  
spread the word. The L.A.

The concept of self-help  

stresses SISTERHOOD that  

makes possible the bene-  

fits from collective know-  
ledge, collective exper-  
iences, collective train-  
ing, and especially the  

sisterly concern for one  

another. When it is nec-  

essary to travel for more  
extensive experiences or  
information, we do.  

Lastly, the self-help con-  

cept emphasizes competent  

medical back-up and the  

use of safe equipment at  

all times.  

We want to hear from sisters  
in the Rocky Mountain Region.
