New Childcare Collectives: They Do Work

Jane Hope

Several years ago, The Dialectic
of Sex proposed several alternatives
for raising children collectively.

At the time I thought they were in-
teresting. I also remember thinking,
with the jaundiced eye of someone who
has watched too many parents trying
to raise too many children, that it
will never really work. After all,
look how confused parents were just
trying to deal with more traditional
(and what looked like simpler and
more “natural") families. Last year
I read Marge Piercy's solution to
parenting in her sci-fi fantasy Woman
on the Edge of Time. Again, I found
the ideas interesting—by this time

I thought they might even work—but
only in another society, still far
distant in the future.

This year I ran into a phenomenon
modestly called “childcare collect-
ives" which are putting into practice
many of the more "Utopian" childrear-
ing theories. To my knowledge, the
concept of collectives, as I am going

to describe it, has only been fully
developed in one city. There are
currently six formal childcare col-
lectives, although more are in the
process of being formed. The child-
care collectives in existence at this
time are comprised mostly of lesbian
feminists, although one gay man, one
straight man and one heterosexual
couple are also involved. Although
the collective members come from
varying class backgrounds which is
reflected in many ways in the differ-
ent collectives, all of the people
involved in the collectives are pre-
sently active in radical politics and

have an active commitment to feminism.

Most of the collectives have been
operating for about two years; the

longest has been operating four years.

LOGISTICS

Each collective has between 6
and 8 adult members, although a few
members in each group are considered
“primary parents." Each collective
has responsibility for one child in
the community. The children raised
by childcare collectives range in
age from 3 to 8 years. Most are fe-
male. Childcare collectives gener-
ally meet every four to six weeks to
arrange for the child's care during
the next month.

The level of commitment varies
within and between collectives—i.e.,
the amount of time each parent spends
with the child, how the economic
support of the child is divided, long
term responsibility, etc. At least
two of the collectives are sharing
economic support for the children.

A number of parents in different
collectives have made major decisions
such as whether to move to another
city or not because of their commit-
ment to their childcare collective.

One distinct difference between
these childcare collectives and
earlier attempts at collective child-
rearing is that the "parents" in the
collective do not live in the same
house, so that each child has 3 or 4
separate households where they have
their own bed, clothes, toys, etc.
Although the concept of several
households has some heritage in ex-
tended family patterns in certain
Native American tribes and, for econ-
omic reasons, in poverty areas in
the black community, these concepts
have never been formalized. In most
other attempts at collective child-
rearing, the biological mother (and
sometimes the father) live in a
collective household where the other
people in the house “help out" with
babysitting, etc. The role most
frequently adopted by other members
of the household is that of "friend"
or "relative." Even in the more

serious attempts at collective child-
rearing, where there is a real at-
tempt to share time and money respon-
sibilities, either one or both of

the biological parents is “available”
24 hours a day and usually ends up
being responsible for any major emo-
tional or physical crisis in the
child's life. Although most of the
new childcare collectives are real-
istic about the legal responsibility
and cultural pressures in the current
society and the fact that the biolo-
gical mother still has primary res-
ponsibility for her child, most of
the children raised in childcare col-
lectives spend at least half the week
in households other than their pri-
mary household. This arrangement
frees both the biological mother

and the other parents from the 24
hour a day-seven days a week burnout.
It also frees the parents to be par-
ents if they choose while living with
other adults who may not wish to make
parenthood their primary focus. At
the same time, collective members do
admit that having at least three

separate households creates a new set
of problems in terms of cohesion—i.e.,
continuity of emotional support, con-
sistency in methods of childrearing,
logistical communication between
parents.

Another aspect of the childcare
collectives which is unusual is that
there are eight parents to one child.
This inverse ratio to the normal fam-
ily pattern of several children and
one or two parents may only develop
at this time in a lesbian feminist
community where the percentage of
children to adults is very low. It
may, however, increasingly provide a
model for other technologically ad-
vanced societies where the ratio
of adults and children is changing.

As far as "smothering" the child-
ren, this does not seem to be a prob-
lem, as each child only relates one
or two days a week to each "parent"
and the parents have other priorities
and time commitments away from their
child. The children also get "peer"
support through daycare, interactions
with other “collective children and
neighborhood playmates.

THE MORGAN COLLECTIVE

The Morgan Collective is the old-
est of the childcare collectives.
June always knew she wanted to have
a child but after one bad marriage,
she knew that she never wanted to
remarry or have a close "family" re-
lationship with the father of the
child. At the time June decided to
have a baby, she was living collect-
ively in a radical political commun-
ity. A gay man, John, expressed a
similar interest in raising a child
and they decided to have the child
together. Following their initial
decision, it took them two years
to convince their respective collect-
ive households that it would be a
good idea. During this period, June
began relating more and more to women
and one of her primary lovers, Susan,
also became a primary parent. During
the year that June was pregnant and
for the first six months of Morgan's
life, the economic and social parent-
ing responsibility was split between
two collective households with John,
Susan and June as primary parents.
When the collectives broke up over
a political split, the three primary
parents moved with the baby to another
city. Mary, a lesbian feminist,
joined the collective at that time.
Mary and John lived in one collective
household and June and Susan lived
in another collective. Childrearing
was again split between the two
houses. Between Morgan's second and
third years, the relationships be-
tween all four parents changed and

one parent moved to a separate house.

These changes solidified as parents
individually related to Morgan in their
roles as primary parents. Since that
time the four primary parents have
operated as the base of Morgan's child-
care collective and they continue to
share economic and time responsibili-
ties.

Morgan. Morgan herself is now four
years old. She currently spends 3

days and 4 nights at June's collect-
ive, two days and one night with
Mary's collective, two days and nights
at John's household and one weekend
day at Susan's house. During the
week she spends five hours a day in
daycare and also visits with other
parents in the collective. Each
household has different "rules" and
attitudes toward childrearing. John's
household is loose and does not pro-
vide much structured time for Morgan.
Mary's household operates on a fairly
"formal" structure of "time for the
children." While these differences
have caused some tension between the
parents, Morgan seems to accept the
idea that adults are separate people
with their own space and that she
has to operate differently in each
household. She knows that she cannot
have meat or sugar at Mary's house,
but that at June's she can. While
recognizing that she has to give
other people space, she also feels
comfortable demanding space for her-
self (i.e., scolding Mary because
Mary left "their" room in a mess).

Morgan continues to identify June
as her "Mom," Patrick as her father,
and other parents as “special friends."
She does, however, identify all of
her primaries as her "parents." In
this sense, she is more “collectively"
oriented than most of the other child-
ren reared by childcare collectives.
This may be because she is the only
child who has been collectively
reared since birth.

For the past two years, Morgan
has attended a daycare center with
traditional values and the effect of
"peer" pressures has been noticeable.
Morgan does not discuss her family
relationships at school (both in
terms of the lesbianism or her “col-
lective!”), yet she is more conscious of other children's

nourishes us.”

traditional family patterns. There
is ambivalence in her feelings. She
describes her ideal family as three
"moms in three houses," but when
she describes the family she will
have when she grows up, she says that
she will have three kids and that
they will only have one parent (her).
Two years ago the Morgan child-
care collective increased in size
and her time was divided among more
and more "parents." When Morgan
finally refused to spend time with
so many “parents,” the collective
reevaluated the situation and de-
creased the collective size.

For "peer" relationships, Morgan
lives two days a week with Seline
(another collective child) and iden-
tifies several friends from daycare,
both female and male. As far as
sexism goes, Morgan has stated that
when she grows up, she wants to be
a daycare worker or a nurse (June
works in an alternative clinic and
Mary is a daycare worker). Many
of her interests still seem typically
female channeled, much of which is
felt to be the result of peer pres-
sure and her daycare activities. She
talks about playing house and playing
with her dolls a lot at daycare. At
the same time, Morgan can talk com-
fortably about her period at age 4
and will not face many of the hassles
of growing up female.
June and Mary, one of the non-
biological parents, has been in
Morgan's collective for four years.
Mary always wanted to be “more than
a daycare worker" and likes the
fuller responsibility of parenting.
She has thought of having a child,
but adopting is difficult for lesbians
and pregnancy was never a question
for her.

Mary feels that during much of the
four years her responsibility as a
parent has been equal to June's. The
primary difference is that June is
still the one parent with the legal
responsibility and, Mary admits,
probably the only parent who does not
feel free to consider "leaving" the
collective. Mary also pointed out,
however, that if she has no legal
responsibilities, she also has no
legal rights in raising Morgan and
must rely on the integrity of the
