Grace and Ruby (fruit) Salads

Women Open Restaurant

Woodwoman

Iowa City will have its own
women’s restaurant by mid-
September. The restaurant, to
be called Grace and Rubies, will
have a seating capacity of 80,
plus a lounge for rapping and
relaxing. Menus will be planned
to cater to strict vegetarians as
well as to meat-eaters, and the
restaurant is in the process of
applying for a beer license.
Hours will be from around 10 am
to 7 pm, six days a week, with the
building open after hours for
entertainment, meetings, or just
hanging out.

The restaurant is chiefly the
project of four local women:
Jean Bott, Sue Gibson, Vicki
Grafentin, and Ginny Blair. Vicki
and Ginny have some restaurant
experience, but for the rest they
and all the other women
involved are learning the
business as they go along.
Originally the women had
conceived of opening a women’s
bar, but after some investigation
they decided that a restaurant

would not only be less
complicated, it would also serve
the broader needs of the

women’s community. Basically
what they want to do is to
provide a space where women
can put their energy into other
women.

The four founders have
formed themselves into a non-
profit corporation. They feel that
to spread the responsibility over
more than four would become
unwieldy. They plan to staff the
restaurant themselves, as they
are wary of the problems similar
feminist projects have run into
around volunteer systems. They
hope, eventually, to draw
salaries, so that they can repay
the personal loans which have
gone to provide most of the
restaurant's capital. Because
they feel that the term
‘collective’ has been “tarnished
by misuse in the community”,
they prefer to call themselves
“an informal group with shared
responsibility”.

There has been a great deal of
support from the feminist
community. Women have

donated their skills, learning as
they worked, and amongst them
they've taken care of everything
except the plumbing, for which
men had to be hired. Several
women in the city have planted
gardens with the restaurant in
mind, and, once it's operating, as
much as possible of the produce
needed will be bought from local
women farmers.

The politics of the restaurant
are simple: it will be a space for
women, and no men will be
permitted to enter. The founders
are prepared to go so far as to
become a private club if there is
no other way to keep men out.
Although news of the
restaurant’s opening has been
spread only by word of mouth
and by handbills distributed at
carefully selected locations, it's
already spread far enough that
one man has threatened legal
action if he isn’t allowed to

AMAZON QUARTERLY

Lesbian Journal Folds

Amazon Quarterly, the only
national Lesbian Feminist
journal, has ceased publication.
Laurel Galana and Gina Covina,
Amazon Quarterly’s editors,
wrote a letter (reprinted in part,
below) explaining the causes for
AQ's demise.

“In Amazon Quarterly’s first
issue, we articulated our hopes
for the magazine’s future
direction: “Though we define
this as a lesbian-feminist
magazine we aren’t interested
solely in stories that tell of
lesbian love, the problems of
being a lesbian, or the joys. Most
of us who read this magazine are
quite familiar with all that on the
personal front. This is also a
place for lesbians to explore
whatever else is on their minds:
it may be a theme generically of
interest to lesbians or something
that might interest almost
anyone. The important factor is
that it be in some way a
launching out from all that we as
women have been before into
something new and uncharted. .
. We wanted AQ to assume a
woman-identified perspective
but to omit it from its focus. We
soon found, though, that a focus
on Lesbianism and feminism as
subjects was most needed.
Amazon Quarterly remained the
only national lesbian journal
throughout her three years, and

readers depended on her for an
affirmation which could be
found nowhere else. We began a
balancing act — a surprisingly
successful attempt to include in
AQ both the deepest concerns of
our hearts, which sometimes
were related to our lives as
lesbians and often were not, and
material specifically for those
many sisters more isolated and
less often affirmed in their love
for women than we.

To begin to answer the needs
for as many women as possible,
we began “Connections” and
published a nationwide directory
of women’s groups and
publications. In this way we
were able to serve readers’
immediate needs through
Amazon Quarterly and still
devote most of the magazine's
pages and our energies to
providing intellectual and
aesthetic sustenance.

Intellectual sustenance was
not easy to find, though, for two
reasons apparent to us: one
being that AQ‘s identity as a
‘lesbian-feminist’ magazine kept
women from sending us work
not centered around lesbianism
or feminism; and the other basic
reason being that so many of us
AQ's readers, lesbians,
women, — were dealing with
basic issues like isolation and
discrimination, not to mention

itself will not propagate any
particular political line. Jean,
Vicki, Ginny, and Sue feel that it
will be political enough “just by
existing”. Needless to say, it will
cater to all women.

Grace and Rubies needs cruets,
teapots, vases, posters, pictures,

rugs, books, and gift
subscriptions to women’s
publications. The founders

would like to hear from other
women who have run or are
running similar projects.

paying the rent and feeding the
kids, and had little energy
beyond these things.

Meanwhile, the importance of
the continual widening of AQ’s
intellectual and philosophical
outlook grew for us as we
realized that neither feminism
nor lesbianism comprises a
philosophy. They are ideas and
facts — important, essential but
not nearly enough to live by. The
implications and extensions of
feminism and lesbianism have
been explored in Amazon
Quarterly exhaustively and on
many levels.

With vol. 3, no. 2, AQ’s sexuality
issue, we formally said goodbye
to lesbian feminism as a focus
for Amazon Quarterly, and went
on to say: ‘We will continue to
take a lesbian perspective for
granted, but encourage our
contributors to write
about/create what passionately
interests you. This could be in
any area from poetry to physics.
Since our first issue we have
repeatedly said that Amazon
Quarterly is not about
lesbianism, that we take such a
basic fact of our existence for
granted. From that we must go
on to explore universal
questions about how we live.” We announced a large topic for
AQ’s next issue: Energy.

Struggle

a continuing forum
Peggy Hickox -

The term “liberal” has been used frequently in the radical feminist
movement as the ultimate putdown. Unfortunately, it has so often been
misused by the “more radical than thou” group (another form of
liberalism) that many of us are unclear as to just what “liberalism” is.
Liberalism stands for peace at all costs, even when that “peace” is at
the expense of feminist goals. Liberalism manifests itself in many
ways:

Letting things slide for the sake of peace and friendship when a
woman has clearly gone wrong, refraining from honest argument of the
same collective. Or to touch on the matter lightly instead of going into it
thoroughly so that you can keep on good terms. The result is that both
the movement and the individual woman are harmed.

Indulging in irresponsible criticism in private instead of directly
confronting them to their faces but to gossip behind their backs, or to say nothing at a
meeting but to gossip afterwards. To show no regard for the principles
of collective life, but to follow your own inclination.

Letting things drift if they do not affect you personally, saying as little
as possible while knowing perfectly well what is wrong, playing cool
and playing safe, to avoid blame.

Refusing to carry out a collective decision or assigned job because
you aren't sure it’s that important. Demanding special consideration.

Indulging in personal attacks, picking quarrels, being personally
spiteful or vengeful instead of entering into an argument against
unsound political views.

Hearing antifeminist views without rebutting them, but taking them
calmly as if nothing had happened.

Failing to express your feminist viewpoints when you are with people
outside the feminist community (at work, at a party, in the bars) or
failing to encourage these women to a feminist perspective, instead
behaving indifferently to such women, showing no concern for their
well-being, forgetting that you are a feminist and behaving like an
ordinary non-feminist.

Seeing someone harming the interests of women and yet not feeling
indignation, not dissuading them, stopping them or reasoning with
them, but allowing them to continue.

Working half-heartedly without a definite plan or direction; working
mechanically and muddling along. Choosing those tasks which can be
most easily performed and performing them in a non-thinking manner,
not thinking about whether this is the most effective thing you can be
doing in the movement.

Regarding yourself as having done your part in the movement, priding
yourself on being an old-time feminist, disdaining minor jobs even if you
are not equal to major jobs; being careless in your work, failing to keep
up with recent developments in the feminist movement.

Being aware of your own mistakes and making no attempt to correct
them; taking a liberal attitude towards yourself.

Are you a liberal? Do you want to be?

since then, and we have not
received enough material that is
both fine in quality and centered
around anything but lesbianism
or feminism in content (let alone

So here we are,

acknowledging that for us to
continue to work in the most

possible, we must end Amazon
