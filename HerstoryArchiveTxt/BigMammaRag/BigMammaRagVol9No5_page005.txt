Preparing Women

The Michigan Metropolitan  
Girl Scout Council and a local community health center in  
Detroit are offering self-  
defense seminars to Girl  
Scouts and their families in  
an effort to encourage aware-  
ness of child assault crimes.

The seminars included infor-  
mation on self-defense, sex-  
ual assault and how and where  
to get help. About 500 girls,  
ranging in age from 8 to 15  
are expected to take part in  
the program. Says Marsha  
Goode, manager of program  
development for the Scouts,  
the sexual abuse seminars fol-  
low the Girl Scout philosophy  
of "helping girls prepare  
themselves to become women in  
today's world."

2 Per Week

A statistic to point out  
the far-reaching effects of  
the drugs which have been  
foisted on us at the profit  
of the drug companies: Women  
are joining the class action  
suit against the manufactur-  
ers of DES at a rate of two  
per week; over 600 women  
have joined the suit already.  
DES causes cancer of the  
vagina in the daughters of  
the women who took DES. And  
to this day, DES is still  
being dumped on women in  
developing countries.

It's A Start

Approximately 20 women turned  
out for the first lesbian  
march in Japan last month.

Threadbare Wages

U.S. garment companies are  
employing more and more wo-  
men to do piecework at home.

Industrial home-work was  
theoretically banned in 1938  
under the Fair Labor Standards  
Act, but has since made a  
comeback. The home-work arran-  
gement offers employers all  
the benefits of running away  
to a Third World workplace  
without moving an inch. Many  
of the women did home-work  
because it is the only way  
they can work and provide  
childcare for their kids too.  
Other women are undocumented  
workers who are afraid that  
working outside the home will  
increase their risk of depor-  
tation.

Repel Rapel

A new product is being mar-  
keted in the U.S. and Canada  
that is designed to prevent  
rape. This product, Rapel  
Rape Deterrent, is being adver-  
tised with full-page ads in  
many magazines targeted for  
women such as Ms. Rapel is a  
14-inch long capsule filled  
with a sulfur-based product  
otherwise known as synthetic  
skunk oil. You wear it clip-  
ped to your body, and when  
in danger, release the li-  
quid by breaking the capsule.  
Your attacker then is sup-  
posed to flee in disgust/  
revulsion at the smell.  
Rapel's big selling point is  
that it's non-violent. It  
can't be turned against you.

Chimera, Inc., a women's  
self-defense organization  
tested the product to see  
how effective it is. Their  
findings: the smell was un-  
pleasant, but never reached  
the advertised vile, putrid  
smell. The "attacker," ever  
practical, breathed through  
her mouth to avoid the smell.  
About Rapel as a non-violent  
product, "No argument here.  
This stuff won't hurt anyone."

Laser Pap

Scientists in Shanghai,  
China may have developed a  
technique which would replace  
the traditional Pap smear in  
detecting cancer of the cer-  
vix. A dye in capsule form  
is placed in a woman's vagina  
and then scanned by a low-  
power beam. If the dye shows  
up as a concentrated fluore-  
scence on the cervix, it in-  
dicates that cancer is present.

Devi Escapes

Despite renewed efforts by  
India's police force, Phulan  
Devi has again escaped cap-  
ture. The former housewife  
is the leader of a gang  
that hides out in a tiger-  
infested area near Kanpur and  
has recently slipped through  
a dragnet composed of hun-  
dreds of police officers.  
Described as a "Robin Hood  
Bandit," she and her partner  
are said to have terrorized  
wealthy landowners in the  
6,000-acre territory, 200  
miles southeast of the na-  
tion's capital. A reward of  
$1,250 has been offered for  
her capture; may it never  
be collected.

Landmark Case

In what may be a landmark  
case for battered women,  
Shirley Hooker has been ac-  
quitted in the murder of her  
husband. On Sept. 2, 1980,  
after 10 years of being bat-  
tered, when Shirley's husband  
came at her with a metal  
chair, she grabbed a kitchen  
knife and stabbed him to  
death. What made this trial  
different is, this is the  
first time testimony on the  
battered woman syndrome and  
how it affects the woman was  
allowed to be admitted into  
the court.

More Vandalism

In another attack on a fem-  
inist bookstore, Emma, Buffa-  
lo Women's Bookstore was  
vandalized on April 18. The  
front, back and side windows  
were broken out. There is no  
evidence of vandalism to any  
neighboring stores.

Ring & Bag Pain

According to the Ontario Re-  
tail Council of the United  
Food and Commercial Workers,  
cashiers at grocery stores  
are suffering health problems  
since switching to new bag-  
ging systems. Ailments such  
as pinched neck nerves, head-  
aches and pain in the back,  
shoulder and elbow are in-  
creasingly common. Such pro-  
blems were rare when cashiers  
rang items and bagging was  
done by another worker.

The switch to "ring and  
bag" during the last few years  
seems to be the problem. Ring  
and bag is a system whereby  
cashiers use their right  
hand to ring and their left  
hand to pack the groceries.  
This system focuses physical  
stress in just one side of  
the body, resulting in injury.

We can only wonder what  
health hazards the new work  
speed-ups caused by the com-  
puter coding of package labels  
will cause.
