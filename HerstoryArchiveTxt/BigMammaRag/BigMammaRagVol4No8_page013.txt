12 Big Mama Rag Vol. 4 No. 8

poetry

We all feel it, our bodies somehow treacherous,  
inimical, not ourselves. Remembering  

mother's migraines, the grandmother or  

great aunt who succumbed with gentility  

after five years' cancer, I experience  

even spring with misgiving, suspicion impacted  
of every woman's mistrust. Somewhere  

in any city a woman proves us right  

by dying expensively and piece by piece  

at twenty-three. Her lover treats it  

THE HUNGER  

some hungers are of the body  

others, more searing, more undeniable,  
are of the soul  

I have such a hunger--  

as a joke in poor taste at his expense. I long to bend words to my will  
and to awaken heartbeats in mountains  
Jean Sirius to lay bare long buried frustrations  

hopes and sorrows  

yet words are not always pliable  
always willing to be fashioned  

sometimes words are like putty:  
to be molded, gently shaped  
into an image  
and more often words are like the Sirens:  
they beckon, they call your soul  
from your body, they fire your lust  
and, yet, they stay just  
out of reach  

Yvonne Stevenson  

I grab my breast  

curved and hard  

nipple against finger  

I want to feel  

much further deeper  

and grasp that  

tangled jungle, pull it  
out to the sun  

and feel what is  

hidden there.

WOMAN  

I didn't know her--  
She walked here many years ago.  
I feel certain her story is written on the willows,  
Her story  
Rippled in the sand,  
Swirled in the river  
and  
Carved on the rock.  
But I am blind to those stories...  
I demand more civilized evidence  
tools  
pots  
weaving  
WOMANHOOD,  
Perhaps it's just as well I didn't know her  
For she would have known me all too well.  
Time etched her saga on the aspens.  
When I lean against the rough bark  
I feel the beauty and strange pain  
as  
I search for the shadow of Woman  
In time gone before me.
