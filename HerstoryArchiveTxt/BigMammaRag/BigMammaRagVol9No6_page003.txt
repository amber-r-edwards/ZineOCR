Workfare Program

Susan Goding

On the principle that poor
people are poor because they
are lazy, the Senate Agricul-
ture Committee decided on May
7, 1981, to allow states the
authority to make able-bodied
recipients of food stamps
work in public service jobs.

In 1977, Congress ordered
the Agriculture Department to
experiment with making able-
bodied food stamp recipients
work without pay for their
stamps in seven pilot pro-
grams.

Workfare, as it is called,
requires that food stamp re-
cipients between the ages of
18 and 60 who are unemployed
and who are not caring for
children under 6 years of
age, to do service work for
a set number of hours each
month.

The formula for figuring
out the number of hours is to
divide the monthly dollar fi-
gure of food stamp benefits
by the minimum wage of $3.35.
For a family receiving $70
in food stamps, a woman head
of household would be requir-
ed to work 20 hours. For $128,
she would have to work 37
hours a month.

The Agriculture Department

set up seven pilot programs
initially which ended last
November, and have started
fourteen more. In the program,
food stamp recipients in the
workfare experiment who fail
to comply during a 30-day job
search period are disqualified
from receiving food stamps for
one month. They then may re-
apply. The administration es-
timates that if all states
took advantage of the workfare
option, as many as 2 million
recipients could be required
to work.

In the pilot programs, in
San Diego County, CA, 88% of
those required to work dropped
out, in Tazewell County,
VA, 40% refused to work.

The jobs people are requir-
ed to work in the program are
service work, some of which
is "menial" in that it would
be low paying no matter who
did it, and many of which
are skilled and would be
higher paying than the $3.35/
hour minimum wage. In Taze-
well County some participants
worked as heavy equipment op-
erators, creative sewing in-
structors, health clinic
aides, and vehicular mechan-
ics. One eligibility worker
in the San Diego welfare
office said, "The jobs are not men-

ial, people are doing skilled
work like sanding cabinets
and painting."

The Agriculture Department
did a study on the results of
the workfare program. Its
findings were that a workfare
requirement seems to decrease
the number of people on the
food stamp program.

One of the main proponents
of workfare is Senator Jesse
Helms (R-NC). Helms is the
chairman of the Agriculture

Committee which came up with
the workfare plan. Helms is
also a member of the Human
Life Amendment Committee,
which is pushing for an amend-
ment to give fetuses all
rights at the moment of con-
ception--outlawing all
forms of abortion and most
contraception. Helms argues that workfare
would drastically cut the
costs of the food stamp pro-
gram.

Women’s Zap Action Brigade Disrupts Congress

Women’s Liberation Zap Action
Brigade

On April 23, 1981, six women
were charged on a Federal Sta-
tute for "Disrupting Congress".

The women interrupted hearings
by the Senate Sub-Committee
on the Separation of Powers
under Senator John East of
North Carolina. The hearing
was a one-sided display by
anti-abortionists in favor of
Senate Bill 158, the so-called
"Human Life Statute" designed
to establish that human life
begins at conception. The wo-
men said, "Stop these hearings.
A woman's life is a human life!"
Spontaneous applause broke out
in support as they were led
from the room.

They were released on $100
bail each and face up to a $500
fine and/or six months impri-
sonment. The US attorney's
office has refused to reduce
the charges to Disorderly Con-
duct.

The six, calling themselves
the Women's Liberation Zap Ac-
tion Brigade, although complete-
ly opposed to the hearings,
acted from their belief that
because the Senate refused to
admit pro-abortion testimony,
women's voices had to be heard.

Extensive press coverage in
all major networks and news-
papers indicates the over-
whelming success of this action.
The women encourage others to
continue the new wave of mili-
tant feminist action in re-
sponse to the increasing at-
tacks on women by the govern-
ment, in the streets and in
the home.

The Women's Liberation Zap
Action Brigade urgently re-
quests contributions to cov-
er legal fees and the potent-
ial fines. Send donations to:
