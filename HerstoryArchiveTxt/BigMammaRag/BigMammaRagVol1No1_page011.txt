LESBIAN 0010 YOU ?

I said I would write an article
about "Gay Women" for Big Mama and
since I happen to be one, (a Gay
Woman that is) I guess that's ap-
propriate. What does the word
Lesbian do to you? I know what it
used to do to me. It would bring
to mind imagery and words such as:
women in men's suits, perversion,
butch, insecurity and a threaten-
ing feeling. It still means that
for many people. Actually, the
word Lesbian has a long history.
The word stems from an old myth
about a group of very fierce Amazon
women who saw nothing wrong with
loving one another and developed
strong primary groups without men.
Their culture glorified women
loving women. These women lived
on the isle of Lesbos and from
there we get the derivative
"Lesbian."

Now to get to the concept of
Lesbian as it is for me and as
other people see me as a Lesbian.
A good many of the straight women
I know who used to be warm and
friendly have become cool and a-
loof, and as uninvolved as possible
now that they know I'm gay. I
think that I might raise some
doubts in their minds about their
life-styles and relationships with

men. I, also at some point, have
felt bisexuality intellectually to
be the ideal way for people to
exist, but on the reality level, I
feel that it's about as realistic
as asking for Utopia in Hell. I
also feel that sexuality labels
are degrading and limiting, but
are very necessary for the ways in
which people relate to each other
at this point. I personally can't
stand labels: heterosexual, bi-
sexual, homosexual. It shouldn't
make a difference but unfortunately
it does, and that's the situation
we're forced to deal with.

Men who see me as a Lesbian see
me as a challenge. Liberal men
want to get down to my basic human
spirit, and want me to prove to
them that I'm not really a castrat-
ing bitch. They're perfectly will-
ing to give me the chance. Fuck
it, if you'll pardon the expres-
sion, I'm tired of explaining my-
self to men. I'm tired of apolo-
gizing for feelings of anger, rage,
pain and hatred, that were placed
in me by men. I'm tired of ex-
plaining the dehumanizing destruc-
tion of my soul, my inner being,
me, to men who exclaim, "Well,
Honey, that wasn't me, that was
some other male chauvinist pig,"

or, "It's not me, it's the power
structure. I'm just a working
class pawn...true, I'm more privi-
leged than you, but honest I don't
have a God-Damned thing to do with
the mess women are in." The same
men will turn around and mess me
over on perhaps just a higher in-
tellectual level than the rest of
the Male Chauvinist Pigs. I've
finally decided that I have to
focus my anger on the people who
deserve it or destroy myself. The
battle is not over yet, and, by
God, I intend to win.

I enjoy determining who I am,
what I want, and I enjoy having
support from Lesbian sisters who
understand where I'm coming from,
recognize the enemy, and no longer
have to spout lies and make ex-
cuses for men. I enjoy loving and
being loved by women spiritually
and physically. I'm beginning to
think that Lesbians are the only
non-masochistic women in our so-
ciety. How can you conquer an op-
pressor when you sleep with him
every night? Yes, I did say con-
quer, the only way women are going
to obtain liberty is to take it.
As long as we relate to men and
they maintain positions of relative
power, we will continue to enforce
their positions in the status quo.
No oppressor readily relinquishes

power to pleading, and attempts at
education. It takes riots and
mass uprising and strikes to hit
where it hurts, right in the balls
of male ruling class status quo
Capitalism. Every white man in
this country benefits from it, and
every woman, Chicano, Indian and
Black person suffers for it. How
long are we all going to let it

go on! Maureen Mrizek

PARK HILL WOMEN'S CENTER

Talked to a friend of mine
the other day. She told me I
should go check out EVERYWOMAN,
a women's center in Park Hill.
So off I trucked, finding myself
(once I got there) in the midst
of a morning tea, with crafts
being sold to raise money for
the center. Most of the women
at the center seemed to be
young mothers. The child-care
center took care of the little
ones. EVERYWOMAN seems to
be a women's center with great
possibilities. For more infor-
mation, call 377-0847. The
address: 2390 Birch.
