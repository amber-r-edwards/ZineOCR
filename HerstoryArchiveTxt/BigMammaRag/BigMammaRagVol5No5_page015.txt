recommend that if David would pay

for and arrange for instruction in
Judaism, that Rachele receive such
instruction.

That Ginny and Pam were able to
mount so comprehensive a defense is
attributable to the extremely active
and successful efforts of the
Rachele Yaseen Defense Fund. The
fund not only raised money necessary
for psychiatrist tests, plane fares,
but also did research, helped plan
strategy, and provided emotional
support.

The battle, which in all lasted 9
months, started when Rachele's father
refused to let her return home to
Denver after a two-month summer stay
with him and his wife in Springfield. Ginny quickly flew out to
Illinois and brought her daughter
back home. What she did not know at
that time was that David had obtained
a temporary custody order for Rachele
and filed his petition to amend the
Divorce Decree. (In the original
decree Ginny was awarded custody of
Rachele in an uncontested divorce.)

Ginny only became aware of the
temporary custody order making David
Rachele's guardian when she returned
to Denver and received a certified
letter informing her of the legal
proceedings.

came an inspiration to garment workers'
struggles that soon followed.
"In the black of winter in 1909
When we froze and bled on the
picket line
We showed the world that women
could fight
And we rose and won with women's
might
Hail the waistmakers of 1909
Making their stand on the picket

line
Breaking the power of those who
reign
Pointing the way, smashing the
chain"

a Mother's Day rally to defend women's
rights in front of the Colorado State
Capitol building.

The rally protested recent attacks
on women's rights nationally and loc-
ally.

Speakers protested health care cut-
backs, the hold up of passage of the
ERA, proposed legislation increasing
penalties for welfare fraud, and other
issues of vital importance to women.

At that point, with the preliminary
custody hearing in Springfield only
1 week away, with no money, and no
lawyer, Ginny and Pam were desperate.
Ginny flew to Illinois and retained
a lawyer, Mr. Panichi, and started
to prepare a defense. While she was
thrown in jail at that first hearing
for “abducting her daughter," she was
released when it was proved that she
had known nothing of the court order
when she had taken Rachele back to
Denver. At that hearing, David's
temporary custody of Rachele was
revoked and Ginny went back to
Denver, again, to work on the defense
for the main hearing scheduled for
only a month later.

The Rachele Yaseen Defense Fund
was put together by Denver feminists
Julie Robinson, Woodwoman, Jackie
St. Joan, and Donna Goode who were
committed to the rights of lesbian
mothers, and to Pam and Ginny as
individuals. Through benefits,
solicitation and wide media coverage
within the feminist community,
the fund raised over $6000
to enable Ginny and Pam to put
together a defense. Rita Mae Brown
did a poetry reading and auctioned
off personal items, an evening of
Jan Oxenberg films was shown, and
women were solicited for funds at
conferences and other feminist

gatherings.
Before the main trial which had

been delayed until April of this
year, an aggressive feminist attorney
Kate Dawes was also hired as
co-counsel. It was felt that it

was good strategy to retain Mr.
Panichi, at least in part because

of his access to the local "good old
boy's club." Kate, a new lawyer,
had had experience before working on
a lesbian mother defense case.
Ginny, Pam, and Rachele were back

in Denver when the Judge issued his
decision maintaining the custody

of Rachele with Ginny.

Ginny still owes both of her attorneys for their legal services.
The Rachele Yaseen Defense Fund is
still alive. They need approximately
$2000 to clear their expenses. If
you can send a donation, please do.

Defense Fund, P.O. Box 18628,

Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles,

Chicago and New York have been meeting to protest the Commission's new
recommendations.

Cutbacks

their money. In addition, it would
prevent people from moving to new
apartments since they would not receive
the rent money they need to
pay for another place.

A real corker is pending in the
Colorado State Congress. This bill,
if passed, would require AFDC recipients
to work in a state work program for at least 3 days a week.

This work would be compulsory and
without pay. Failure to comply would
result in the loss of some benefits.
(This does not apply to AFDC mothers
already working twenty hours a week
or who have children under the age

of 6.)

These bills can be passed. They
are being seriously considered. The
U.S. Senate has set a monetary ceiling
of 6 billion dollars for the food
stamp program, and they are determined
to fit into that budget. Some
members of Congress are talking about
a 4.5 billion dollar ceiling. Carter
says that 5 million people will be
cut from the food stamp program as
it tentatively looks and 20 million
people added to it. I would wager
that the figures are probably closer
to the reverse.

reform group in your community!

Mental Patients

She formed a strong circle of friends
in the feminist community. She got a
job and won a $1400 Federal grant to
learn a trade in school.

But eventually she was caught and
extradited back to the hospital in
Colorado from which she had escaped.
Now she is awaiting trial for her
escape and conviction could mean a
sentence of up to five years.

Nonetheless, escaping and living on
her own gave Cecilia a taste of free-
dom and confidence that will help her
survive the brutality of the hospital.
Now she knows what she is fighting for
and she has women fighting with her.

The Cecilia Gonzales Defense Committee
wants to broaden their defense
efforts to include other women in
State Hospitals who have not been as
lucky as Cecilia. They are asking
that women write to them about their situ-
ations and "treatment". They will try
to give support and information and
to educate the public about what is
happening to women in mental institu-
tions.

Letters of information, support and
donations can be sent to the Cecilia
Gonzales Defense Committee, c/o Deb
Taylor, 1458 Gaylord St., Denver,
Colo. 80206.

Ultimately what we need is

the total acceptance of homosexual relationships as a viable lifestyle.
In the meantime, fighting for lesbian custody rights will have to go on.
Hopefully, in the near future the US Supreme Court will decide a lesbian
mother custody case and write a favorable opinion which can then be cited

in all states.

Unfortunately, even this would not be a panacea.

Judges

can always make up reasons for what they do.
I can only hope that by fighting strong cases based on what we know are
our rights, we will continue to educate people while winning our cases.

Idealistic? Yes, but the alternatives are few.

We must make lesbian

motherhood a right and option to all: lesbians, not just a few.

Court any day now.
