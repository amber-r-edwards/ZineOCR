For the Women I go to school with

Like rancid water,  
their women's lives  
ripple over me  
and never quite allow me to forget  
that they are after all the reason.  
I'm looking down  
and up at them  
here in the locker room  
where their strength is at once  
raw and disguised  
and their lean bodies  
tremble with some hidden fire  
their swift, hard muscles  
move in the morning sun,  
their aspirations sow anger  
still they sigh when my voice  
(unattached, of course  
from the body of familiarity they familiarize  
with)  
rambles on about newspapers and  
pain and alternatives  
I wish I could open their flat, unseeing eyes  
for they look  
just past my life,  
their own imposed patterns  
submerge what is really there  
they stare neatly beyond  
my litany of change  
and see me smiling at them  
never knowing why  
I love and hate them both at once...

the breast of June

I am working it out

lifting weights like mammoth butterflies in the air in the wilderness

it is a cold April morning

By ee

October

new continuences flower

gold, like

glancing groves

dazzle sun spotted  
Warmth

maybe even love

is what I feel of

this cool-smiled  
Woman

(dark spruces

soak the sun greenly)

more than a tree  
Women blaze

all aspen suns in October  
We thrive

as evergreens endure winter.

Clare Strawn

in my dark bedroom

Bach's partitas for unaccompanied violin on my radio  
I am dancing

to the strength of my lover’s back  
the muscles in her hands & thighs

unafraid of the mice in my kitchen  
of the rat that runs the marathon inside my ceilings

it is the cruelest month, the cruelest month  
for my cruel mouth & unprotected heart

I wake dreaming of endless women poets flushed down  
like bloody tampax

I wake plotting to stick splintery broomsticks  
into the assholes of rapists

my mind is so refined  
I string bloody foreskins into Artemis’ necklace

meeting June in March

why should I  
think you got  
something be-  
hind that stilled  
voice, that your  
wounded mouth  
can form the  
words I’d want.

Again, I

open up

with the flo-  
wers of my  
hands, palms up  
to you, al-  

ways open.

Pat Wagner

this morning I want to twirl my tongue like a pinwheel in her ear

all day as the dogs in the next apartment die  
howling on their lust

my mind is so refined  
while I ascertain the tenderness in my breast

& think of the breast of June  
dreaming of our menstruations on the sheets

Sexual Poetics

The male poet is reading poems.

At his belt he wears a knife

in a leather sheath  
As he speaks  
he fondles it.

My poems are a cup

I offer you.  
You drink me straight.
