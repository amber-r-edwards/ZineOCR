International Planned Parent-
hood Federation and A.I.D.'s
“family planning" programs in
the Third World. A.R.M. in-
corporated this strong anti-
population control analysis
in its work. Not to say that
those of us who worked in
A.R.M. were completely non-
racist. I know all white peo-
ple internalized the vicious
racism of this society and
we must constantly struggle
against it.

BMR's retitling is inaccu-
rate in every respect. The
article does not focus exclu-
sively on the abortion rights
movement (and never mentions
the organization A.R.M.) Much
of the article discusses the
"Take Back the Night Marches"
as an example of a feminist
strategy that lacks an under-
standing of race and class.

The greatest power of inac-
curate journalism is that
once it is done it cannot be
undone. The papers cannot be
recalled. The words cannot
be unwritten. Bear minimum, I
expect this letter to be
printed in a prominent place,
with some explanation of
BMR's careless error. Should
I request that the retraction
be printed front and center
of the newspaper with the
same prominence as the er-
roneous title? I know there
is no way to undo the harm.

I hope that BMR attempts a
sincere, constructive and
non-sensationalist struggle
against racism.

“Language can be

responsibility for it.”

Dear BMR Sisters,

Crystos' cover poem was
wonderful and very penetra-
ting. I appreciate how well
you laid it out. It gave me
an idea to submit a poem
that I'll try to get in here
by the time I mail this.

Also, I have something of
a criticism regarding my
January letter that I hope
you can accept in the spirit
in which it is given—which
is hope.

By labeling my letter "On-
going Anger" you put a label
on me that I hadn't taken for
myself and also put me in
somewhat of a defensive posi-
tion.

I'm sure you've received
my Racism Statement by now so
I'd like to explain that a
real pattern in white/womyn
of color relations has been
the white sisters labeling
our feelings “anger" when we
complain about their oppres-
sive behavior.

Language can be manipulated
so that judgment is made
without taking responsibility
for it. For instance, if I
were to have a problem with
BMR editors, this situation
could be described in a num-
ber of ways:

“The white womyn are being
racist."

"Juana is angry at the
white womyn."

Each describes the same
situation while placing blame
in a different place. By lab-
eling my concerns anger
without explicitly validating
that anger, you can put out a
mixed message.

"Is this womyn righteous
in her anger or is she dump-

ing on/attacking the white
womyn?"

I won't explain this any-
more because I feel my racism
statement covers it ade-
quately. But I will tell you that
my surprise in seeing the word,
repeated, in your heading and
the white womyn's letter, was
that I never felt validated
enough in my humiliation to
feel angry. I was running
scared.

I thought I
some deep old
Letter and it
that the only
far have been from white wo-
myn who label these real
fears anger, thereby intimat-
ing that I am attacking the
white womyn again.

In any case, I'm sure this
was not your intention to
invalidate me and printing
it as you did, and so prompt-
ly was enormously supportive
of my old pain and fears, my
new validation of my anger
and also of my ongoing work
as a writer.

The edited version of La
Luz is almost finished. I got
right on it after the letter

was expressing
fears in that
concerns me
responses so

was printed. Also I'm circu-

lating some of my older writ-
ings—the racism statement
and poem to a white womyn—
plus I just wrote this new
book review—and I'll try to
enclose a poem.

I hope I'm not submitting
too much to your paper but
you're so open you're encour-
aging me to do new things all
the time.

As usual, print any of this
letter you choose, you might
feel some use of the word
“anger" needs to be cleared
up though my other letter is
so long that both might seem
redundant. I leave this to
your judgment.

If you haven't had my book,
La Luz, reviewed yet please
hold off till the edited ver-
sion is available, 4-6 weeks.
It's much more readable and
I included a lot of stuff
that was left out of the
first edition.

Love to you,

"Why not put an
editorial note?...”

Dear BMR editors,

I am really pleased by BMR's
continuing extensive coverage
of the issue of psychiatric
oppression. I was initially
pleased also that you reprint-
ed my article from Grassroots
about NAPA's (Network Against
Psychiatric Assault) protest
against ECT (Electro-convul-
sive Therapy) at Herrick Hos-
pital. However, after I read
your “edited" version, I
burst into tears.

It's true, I did send you
quotes by women about shock
and suggested you use them in
place of the quotes in my
Grassroots article by men who
had attended NAPA's demonstra-
tion, since then would have

more relevance for feminist

readers. I assumed you would
either put these quotes in a
box alongside the article, or
include them in the body of
the article, with an intro-
duction like, "Here is how
some women who have had ECT
describe the experience."
Instead, you printed the un-
truth that the women quoted,
Janet Frame and Georgia Jones,

were present at the demonstra-

tion in Berkeley. I was hor-

rified for a number of reasons.
One, I have a very strong emo-
tional allegiance to the truth,

having been forced to OD all my

life on the lies and disinfor-
mation of the media,
