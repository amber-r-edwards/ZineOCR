WOMEN’S
HEALTH SERVICE
CLINIC

We are concerned that women's/lesbian publica-
tions have often failed to reflect the experiences
and viewpoints of Third World, working-class and
older women. CONDITIONS includes work in a
variety of styles by both published and unpublished
writers of many different backgrounds. We wel-
come submissions from all women who feel that a
commitment to other women is an integral part of
their lives.
