Johnston/Schaef Psycho — Gymnastic Event

Women Coming Together.

And Splitting Apart

Sandia

A fine madness. That is what
the second program of WOMEN
COMING TOGETHER was all
about and what this write-up will
be.

Something about ex-
pectations. What we as women
expect when we pay money to
see a performance or to be
witnesses to an event within the
women’s community.

First expectation: nothing.
What happens when you put two
women together who have
never met before? Even if they
are both ‘feminists’. Even if
both in their own ways have
been guides for women along a
path that has not been clearly
mapped out by anyone and
certainly not on any historical
map of self-discovery we have
ever studied. Jill Johnston,
writer for the Village Voice and
author of Lesbian Nation and
Gullible’s Travels, believes like
many of us that much of the help
and support women should get
while working out personal
/social conflicts must come
from themselves and from the
women’s community. She bases
her views on her own ex-
periences with sanity, insanity,
inanity. Anne Schaef is a
therapist who has rejected
notions of sanity and validation
from a system that inherently
invalidates women; yet, she
subscribes to some formal
procedures because she feels
that the self-hate and rage that
women have must be dealt with
in safe surroundings.

Second expectation: women
came to hear them and be
entertained or enlightened. They
wanted a happening. Some left
when it began to happen. When
the content of the rap became
the very process and shape of
the program, or (for those
readers not present that night)
when the two speakers stopped
talking humorously and
objectively about the nature of
women’s therapy and began
actually getting involved in
working out some of their own
reactions and honest responses,

the stewards said they couldn't
protect us); was outspoken about
what a sell-out our ex-chief
steward is for becoming a
foreman (the same one who
hassled me and fired me); I was
very clear about the need for the
union to back up the black
workers in the shop especially
when the plant manager
threatened one black worker's
life.

I joined CLUW (Coalition of
Labor Union Women) at the same
time I joined the IVE and have
come to several meetings. I think
CLUW should fight for me not just
because a woman was diser-
iminatorily fired but because GE
went after a good unionist as
well.

I've filed a union grievance, but
because there is no arbitration of
a probationary worker's
grievance, all GE has to do is to
hold firm to their story; the
grievance has gone to its final
step. I have filed discrimination
suits with the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission and the Equal

Employment Opportunity
Commission, but that will take a
long time.

We must show GE that it can’t
get away with it, that women do
fight back.

— What She Wants, LNS

a lot of women in the audience
freaked out themselves.

Jill freaked because Anne was
coming on to her as a ‘“‘locker-
upper” not unlike what she had
experienced at Bellevue. Anne
was sitting across from her in a
white dress triggering all kinds
of associations. Only the night
before Jill had been lucid and
illuminating in Colorado Spr-
ings. Now in front of a crowd of
400 women who wanted the
stage mask and glibness, she
was getting into feelings from
the past that were pushing some
“not OK” buttons in her.

Anne, sitting on the throne
chair, was freaked out by the
church, one of the oldest
oppressors of the patriarchy.
Tired from two previous talks
already that day. Unable to
handle the associations Jill was
stirring in her. Begins to cry.
Both women were in tears. At
this point the whole tone of the
evening changed. 6th grade
basketball rally over. Clapping
done by bipartisans ending.
Morality chorus with thumbs up
or down gave way to some
women in the audience who
began fully participating rather
than judging. Down to some
“work.”

One woman stands and talks
about what she does to keep her
life in balance. Another woman
in the front row wearing a
striped shirt turns around and
maybe everyone wanted to hug
her. She says we, the audience,
were playing the locker-uppers,
keepers to these two women on
stage; deciding who was right or
wrong, sane or insane.

Finally all expectations gone.
After a momentary craziness of
our own, everyone begins
participating in the structure
that has evolved. If craziness is
other than the usual state of
mind (if free women are in
another state of mind than what
society expects) we are all
insane - and therefore no one is
insane. Boundaries shifting.
Expectations shifting.
My feelings about the

FOLKLORE CENTER

Katie O’Brien

“My complaints fill up the
universe.” This is one of Jill
Johnston's record book entries
from Lesbian Nation and while a
grandiose notion, her
complaints, childishness,
insecurities, and lack of pro-
fessionalism certainly filled up
the Unitarian Church the
evening of April 14th.

To admit to no expectations of
this evening is delusion at best
and ignorance at least. Jill
Johnston — author, feminist,
artist and above all the new brand
of woman many of us are either
comfortable with becoming or
still struggling with — a political
lesbian. Anne Schaef —
feminist therapist, committed to
women, working with women
and herself a person who
happens not to be a lesbian. Who
would have expected this
difference to split the seams of all
communication and turn a
receptive audience into
accusers, blaming themselves
and/or the women on stage? My
expectations were sky high. It
would be an evening to learn,
become excited, challenged.
Political lesbianism would show
itself in simple clarity. Feminist
therapy would be discussed as an
alternative to traditional modes
and methods of therapy. What
did happen was that Jill had a
tantrum and we learned that
women coming together as a
group does not necessarily of
itself make for positive learning
situations.

Jill made numerous
references to her status as
alienated and misunderstood
artist, a role she has embraced
and obviously enjoys playing to
the hilt. She also had trouble
sharing the stage with another
person. As long as Jill could
ramble on about herself, her past
mental states, her difficulties
with the system, she was fine.
Several questions were directed
to her concerning women,
music, and writing which she
dismissed as “irrelevant.”
Translation — ‘Don't bother me
with what you want to talk about;
I'm busy talking about me which
is infinitely more interesting.”
Anne, on the other hand, kept
trying to keep a rapport going
between the stage and the
audience but had her hands full
keeping Jill from fading in and
out. Consequently, more and
more queries were directed to
Anne who finally confronted Jill
about where she was. Jill then
whined that she had problems
dealing with the ‘Accredited
One” as she called Anne and
after all what did they really have
in common anyway? To which
Anne indignantly responded that
she was “pissed off” at being set
up. And rightfully so.

Jill's response in essence was
that we were a bunch of phonies
who talked about women being
permitted to be themselves and
here she was being herself and
we were coming down on her. Jill
Johnston needs to be called on
the carpet. She is an author who
cannot communicate; she is an
alienated artist who alienates;
and she is a lesbian who, in my
opinion, does not like women.
When asked why she bothers to
have these lectures, these tours,
her response was “Just for a
gig.” This hardly speaks to me of
commitment to women. I can be
“just a gig” to an employer, a
husband, any number of people
but I didn’t expect it from one who
claims to care about me because I
am a woman.

I've known too many lesbians
who cannot be called feminists
by any stretch of the imagination.
I've known too many lesbians,
like Jill, who emphasize
differences by “straight baiting”
and writing off potential sisters
who choose to relate to men
sexually. And I've received sup-
port from too many so-called
straight women to decide we
have no common ground
because of the differences in our
bed partners or lifestyles.

Jill said one thing which made
perfect sense and that was that
her first impression was that
Sisterhood was a warm fuzzy
blanket — an image that was to
be dispelled for her. Thank you
Jill Johnston for helping to dispel
it for me; no one bears it out better
than you.

The audience came in a flash as
I watched some leave (relatively
few considering those who had
to work and those who were
there till the end). A line from
Judy Grahn: We have left all our
lovers too soon to get the real
loving done. All women are our
lovers. Why did some of us leave
before the situation got worked
out? Progression from boredom
to insanity to chaos resolved into
some kind of — participatory
happening that involved us from
the guts outward. Women
Coming Together after splitting
apart. A psycho-gymnastic
event. Not ordinary for sure.
Some practical items: The
large turnout resulted in green
power for some local women’s
efforts. Anne used her share for
the Women's Institute for
Alternative Psychotherapy. Jill's
share went to Big Mama Rag.
Jane Dundee, one of the key
organizers, is allocating some of
the money toward the
anticipated Women’s Center.
WOMEN COMING TOGETHER,
which sponsored the event, took
some money toward the next
presentation, hopefully a visual
celebration of women. We hope
to show the video tape from last
summer's Women’s festival, a
product of much work by Elissa
Meyer and Judy Sarchielli. If you
