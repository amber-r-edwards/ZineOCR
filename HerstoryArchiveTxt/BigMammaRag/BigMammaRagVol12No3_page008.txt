When she was in New Zealand  
in August Madhu Kishwar,  
from India, talked to Papa-  
rangi Reid about Indian  

land rights struggles and  
the position of the tribals.

Can you tell us about the  
tribals? Who are they and  
what are their struggles?

The census lists about 7%  
of the 700 million popula-  
tion of India as tribals.  
They are still ethnically  
distinct and in many parts  
of the country they have  
preserved their separate  
ethnic identity. In some  
parts of the country there  
are distinct tribal pockets,  
where the tribals would con-  
stitute the subsistence  
peasantry. Regions such as  
the Charkan region covering  
the states of Bihar, Madhya  
Pradesh and Orissa in cen-  
tral India are now demanding  
a separate state for them-  
selves. That is one of the  
areas which is very politi-  
cally explosive.

What is the basis of the  
movements? Is it the land?

It is a lot to do with the  
land. It is also to do with  
forest rights, it is to do  
with oppression, with deman-  
ding a better deal for tri-  
bals. Though sometimes the  
way it is expressed is a  
little chaotic. The north  
hill regions also have sev-  
eral pockets which have sub-  
stantial tribal populations.  
There are similarly tribal  
pockets in the south of In-  
dia, in Andhra Pradesh and  
Tamil Nadu, but in many of these  
areas, for instance in Maha-  
rashtra, which is on the  
west coast, they have been  
overruled. They lost their  
land in the 19th century at  
the time of various settle-  
ment operations carried out  
by the British, so today  
they constitute the landless  
poor. Similarly, in large  
parts of Andhra Pradesh,  
the tribals would be the  
landless poor. So it varies,  
either they would consti-  
tute the subsistence pea-  
santry, the poor peasantry,  
even when they are in own-  
ership of land, or they are  
the landless poor, living  

was a tribal, 200 years ago,  
2000 years ago, and some  
5000 years ago. But in  
large parts of the country,  
the landless poor are what  
are called lower castes, or  
scheduled castes. Gandhi  
called them harijans, which  
means “Children of God".  
That was his way of trying  
to draw attention to this  
problem.

What are the problems of  
the landless poor and wom-  
en's role in that struggle?

In most parts of the  
country, the landless poor  
are usually organised  
around the struggle for bet-  
ter wages. They are often  
paid less than subsistence  
wages, less even than the  
minimum wage and women paid  
less than men. So you can  
imagine what that means.  
There are also semi-bonded  
conditions. The poor would  
be made to perform semi-  
compulsory forms of labour  
in the fields of the landed  
rich. Because they are so  
poor, very often they have  
to be indebted and if you  
are indebted and the rates  
of interest are exorbitant,  
in the countryside it is  
despairing even to think  
of. In some parts, it has  
been found that a man may  
have borrowed two bags of  
rice or a few rupees two  
generations ago, in return  
for which he had to become  
a bonded labourer. In the  
next generation and the  
next the interest kept pil-  
ing up. They could never  
hope to repay. The women  
would be particularly prone  
to sexual exploitation. They  
have to be made available  
in some parts of the coun-  
try, for instance, the tra-  
dition of the right of the  
first night. Or even, if  
the man's wife is pregnant,  
he expects to be supplied  
with somebody else. Or they  
would be kept as mistresses.  
Landlessness, indebtedness  
and sexual exploitation are  
so intertwined with each  
other, that you could hardly  
say where force ends and  
consent begins.

So whenever the landless

poor are organised, one very  
powerful rallying point  
invariably comes to be sex-  
ual exploitation by the ru-  
ral elite. The rural elite  
keep armed ruffians to  

crush the landless poor.  
They organise themselves in-  
to crop protection societies  
which are really bodies of  
armed hoodlums. These crop  
protection societies are an  
important way of terroriz-  
ing the rural poor. They use  
sexual assaults on women  
because they can use the  
pretext of searching women  
for stolen grain to sexually  
assault them. More and more  
these armed ruffians are  
using guns to settle the  
battles. And when the guns  
of these rural elite prove  
to be not enough, the police  
with their machine guns and  

are often sheer massacres by  
both the police and armed  
ruffians. So every little  
struggle is crushed. The mir-  
acle is, it rises again out  
of its own ashes. It really  
surprises me, considering  
how much repression there  
is, how much resistance  
there is. I find it very in-  
spiring that sparks should  
be constantly flying, that  
every struggle throws up  
another one out of its own  
ashes.

What are the issues in  
the tribal struggles?

One struggle I am famili-  
ar with is in the Charkan  
area. The tribals in this  
area were politically sub-  
jugated in the 19th centu-  
ry. Till then none of the  
chiefs had been able to get  

they have dug near a stream. The hole is dug so that the  
stoney ground may act as a filter for the water. Hundreds  
of thousands of villages in India are without potable  
drinking water. Women often have to walk miles to fetch  
water from often polluted sources. /Manushi 10, 1982/Surjeet.

their other repressive mach-  
inery move in. In rural  
areas, it is difficult to  
distinguish between an arm-  
ed ruffian and a policeman.  
They are very much the same.  
Of course the police have  
much greater powers at  

their disposal. A common  
form of crushing the move-  
ment is to register a lot  

of false cases against  

those who are organising,  
accuse them of robbery,  
theft, murder and arson. Who  
is going to be able to chal-  
lenge the police? So you put  
the poor behind bars and you  
gang-rape the women. There  

them under their political  
control. In the 1830s the  
British brought in a big  
military expedition and fin-  
ally, after a great deal of  
resistance and bloodshed,  
this area was brought under  
political control by the  
British. They introduced  
settlement operations. The  
tribal economy was large-  
ly forest-based but they  
were compelled to settle  
down, as sedentary peasants,  
for the process of revenue  
collection. That was a very  
important part of the eco-  
nomic mainstay of the reg-  
ion at this time. This is
