**Pornography and the 1st Amendment**

(Cont’d from p. 1)

can plead with the pornographers and  
pornography consumers until we are  
blue in the face, but the truth of the  
matter is they are concerned with  
their profits and sexual kicks. . .

“Women must learn how to get laws  
that will protect us. . . One example  
would be a law which states that peo-  
ple do not have a right to denigrate  
us as a class...

"That censorship will create a  
black market for pornography seems  
probable, but I think it is clear that  
we will never be rid of pornography  
totally until we are rid of the pa-  
triarchy. Better to have it under-  
ground than to see it flourish as an  
accepted part of our culture. Femin-  
ists must demand that society find  
the abuse of women both immoral and  
illegal."

Yet, there are flaws in that argu-  
ment too. To argue for a change in  
the law does not guarantee that the  
law will have a feminist perspective  
or be enforced free of the political  
and cultural biases of congressmen  
and cops. Politicians who can't find  
it in their hearts or wallets to pass  
the ERA are hardly likely to pass a  
law making it illegal to denigrate  
us as a class.

I like the point of view of Deb  
Friedman, of the Feminist Alliance  
Against Rape in Washington D.C. (also  
printed in the WAVPM newsletter):

"If we react only to our gut feelings  
in advocating censorship now, we may  
be faced with major contradictions  

in a short while. Promoting bans on  
pornography may give those who con-  
trol our political institutions more  
power over our lives than achieving  
it will give us control over our en-  
vironment.

"Just as we are seeking alterna-  
tives to the inadequacies of the crim-  
inal system for dealing with rapists,  
we should be attempting to develop  
anti-pornography tactics which go  
beyond the limitations of state con-  
trolled censorship. Developing an  
analysis of pornography which iden-  
tifies sexism as the source of vio-  
lence against women. . . is crucial  
to our choice of strategies. . . As  

long as women's needs are belittled  
throughout the rest of the culture,  

**Feminists Stop Snuff--filmed where ‘life**

By Kathy

Women calling themselves Feminists  
Against Violence Against Women were  
instrumental in preventing the S-M  
porn movie, Snuff, from being shown  
in Denver.

The movie, which depicts the rape,  
murder and dismemberment of Argentin-  
ian women, was originally advertised  
as made in South America "where life  
is cheap." It was scheduled to open  
Oct. 26 at the Evans Drive-In Theater,  
2705 W. Evans, as part of "bizarre  
Halloween entertainment” bill.

A group of about 10 women met the  
night before the opening to plan a  
phone campaign, picket and boycott  
of all four theaters owned by Frank  
McLaughlin. McLaughlin, who owns  
the Evans, the Oriental, Cinema 70  
and Village Square, told one woman  
he had seen Snuff and found "nothing  
wrong with it.”

But by the following afternoon,  
hours before the movie was due to  
be shown, he had reportedly agreed  

to remove it under pressure from  
Denver District Attorney Dale Tooley.

Tooley, who has been getting a  
lot of political heat over his poor  
record in enforcing the new state  
obscenity law, had gotten calls all  
day long from feminists and other  
groups asked to participate in the  
phone campaign. Tooley's office was  
also visited by two of the women in  
the Snuff protest, and the 10 p.m.  
Channel 2 news featured an interview  
with another woman involved in the  
group.

The movie did not open; however,  
women were on hand with leaflets  
and pickets to ensure that it would  
not be shown that night. The follow-  
ing day, Oct. 27, Tooley screened  
the movie and officially announced  
that it would not run because  

strategies for banning pornography  
will serve mainly as stop-gap meas-  
ures."

In Denver, pressure for enforce-  
ment of anti-porn laws has not been  
coming from feminists; it's been  
coming from community groups and  
moralists. Recently the Park Hill  
Improvement Association and the Den-  
ver chapter of Citizens for Decency  
Through Law started pressuring Denver  

District Attorney Dale Tooley to  
start enforcing the state anti-porn  
laws. Tooley claims he's not about  
to flood the courts with cases until  
the law itself passes a court test,  
(However, in the Snuff cancellation,  
Tooley's power was sufficient to get  
the Evans Drive-in theater owner to  
"voluntarily" withdraw it.)

As for the state of Colorado, ar-  
guments on the constitutionality of  
a new law began in early November in  
Boulder. The law is being tested in  
a case against the Pleasure Chest Gift  
Shops of Colorado, which opened a  
shop across the street from the sher-  
iff's office. The law basically para-  
llels the US Supreme Court ruling  
which says that an obscenity law must  
define obscenity as something that  

McLaughlin had "voluntarily" agreed  
to cancel it.

Feminists Against Violence Against  
Women does not plan to meet as an  
on-going group; however, they will  
remobilize should Snuff ever again  
come to Denver. Some of the women  
in the group are willing to put en-  
ergy into working politically around  
the porn issue. Anyone who would like  
to start such a group could write to  
BMR and we will put you in touch  

with each other.

Snuff has been stopped by feminist  

control porn movie houses were de-  
clared unconstitutional by a judge  
in March of this year.

A suit had been brought by Kitty's  
Cine Art Theater, 1912 S. Broadway,  
which had been facing a public hear-  
ing over the neighbors' objections  
to renewal of its city “amusement”  
license. Kitty's ducked the hearing  
by going to court first.

Judge Zita Weinshienk overturned  
parts of the ordinance that allowed  
the city to consider a neighborhood's  
reaction to a theater and to consid-  
er the reputation and background of  
the theater owner before granting a  
license. The judge said that the 1st  
Amendment can't be regulated by the  
neighbors of a theater, and that an  
owner's background couldn't be used  

groups all across the country since  
it was put on the market a year and  
a half ago. A month before the Den-  
ver protest, women in San Diego  
formed a coalition and managed to  
shut it down with strong community  
support. In their press release,  
they noted that Snuff doesn't even  
have an X rating anymore. Apparently  
"frontal nudity" scenes have been  
edited out, so that it now has an  
R rating.

In October, women in Rochester,  
New York picketed the showing of

couldn't control their environment  
totally.

So I realized that all of the invest-  
ment of my life can't go into them,  
and that I had better put some invest-  
ment into changing society where I  
can work in a long term sense. And I  
don't think it hurt the kids to see me  
change from a Super Mom to a political  
activist and they understand why that  
happened.

After I gave up trying to correct  
all this stuff, I tried to help them  
recognize that they're going to have  
some good things in school and they're  
going to have some bad things... and  
it's their responsibility to take what  
they can out of school that's worth-  
while and work around the rest of it.

Trudy: Thank you. I always felt  
guilty about not being active in my  
child's school.

BMR: If you had to do it over again,  
would you be a mother?

Trudy: I'd do it earlier. I had Jose-  
phine when I was 39. I'd do it right  
off the bat and get it done with. I  

would never feel that I need the exper-  
ience of being a mother to be a whole  
woman. I can't picture myself  
without some sort of association with  
children, but did it have to be this  
long?

Sarah: I'm real glad that I had chil-  
dren. I think it may have been a lot  

easier for me that I wasn't a feminist  

or very active politically when I  

first had them. It's hard for me to  

relate to your choice which is a  

different kind of choice than  
ad.

If I were back to an earlier stage  
of my life with different kind of com-  
mitments that I had then, I'm not  
absolutely sure that I would feel that  
necessity of having kids. There are  
other ways of having those kinds of  
experiences. Like you could help  
somebody else very seriously rear  
their children. That's another option  
where you could have some control over  
your situation where you wouldn't have  
to go through these 24 hour responsi-  
bilities.

to interfere with his right to free  
speech.

Another overturned section of the  
ordinance got the classic Catch-22  
treatment. It had said that any  
theater within 500 feet of a resi-  
dential area could not be licensed  
if it showed films into which per-  
sons under 18 could not be lawfully  
admitted. The catch was "lawfully  
admitted." Colorado law prohibits  
minors from seeing obscene films,  
but as of now there is no legal def-  
inition of obscene. (The standard  
GP through X rating system is not  
legally established; it's a voluntary  
guideline from the movie industry).

Whatever the eventual outcome  
from the courts, any feminist group  
choosing to enter the struggle for  
changes in the law will find itself  
next to some unlikely allies: moral-  
ists, whose argument is basically a  
puritan sexual ethic, and community  
groups who focus on property values  
and landlords’ "civil spirit." Ob-  
viously, neither touches a feminist  
perspective of porn.  

Community groups could make some  
good connections out of the fact  
that the proliferation of porn houses  
in inner-city and working class  
neighborhoods victimize those commun-  
ities and not the neighborhoods of  
the businessmen who support and pro-  
fit from East Colfax Avenue and  
South Broadway.

However, communities most likely  
to enter an anti-porn campaign are  
like the Park Hill community in Den-  
ver: a once comfortable middle  
class neighborhood now going through  
an economic decline. It is not like-  
ly to associate itself organizational-  
ly with communities that long ago  
had a decline forced on them; nor,  
as property owners, to make any con-  
nections based on a class analysis.

In any case, the portion of the  
ordinance that gave the city the  
right to "consider" their objections  
has now been swept away from them, as  
it has from any other political group  
that wanted to use the public hear-  
ing system for political purposes.

Clearly--with the possible excep-  
tion of child porn--the law is not  
going to be a promising area for  
feminists to work in. Other strate-  
gies need to be considered.

However, the action brought the ar-  
rest of four women who had allegedly  
broken a theater window and destroyed  
a Snuff poster. Legal support for  
the women is forming. They are being  
charged with 3rd degree criminal  
mischief, which is a felony. For
