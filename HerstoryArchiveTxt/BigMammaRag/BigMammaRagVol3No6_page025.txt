Beyond God the Father, Toward  
Philosophy of Women’s  
Liberation, Mary Daly, Beacon  
Press, Boston, 1973. $3.95  

Jacqueline St. Joan  

Mary Daly, as women's ad-  
vocate in the philosophical and  
theological forum, believes the  
Women's Movement is a  
spiritual revolution of being, and  
that women’s perception of  
reality will overcome male  
philosophical constructs which  
feed and reflect the power of the  
patriarchy. As some modern  
male theologians have also  
done, Daly has pinpointed the  
philosophical dualism  
(good/bad, right/wrong,  
male/female, high/low) of the  
Greek period as the starting  
point for the male distortion of  
reality. Her real argument, then,  
is with the mentality which  
produced an ideology of male  
supremacy by creating a  
philosophical interpretation of  
reality in which women do not  
exist. Unlike the male  
theologians, whom she both  
credits and skillfully dissects,  
Daly can live with the am-  
biguities of the future because  
she is open to its possibilities.  

In Beyond God the Father,  
Daly speaks of the need for  
women to uproot the prevailing  
sense of reality in the world.  
Women must create their own  
new space “on the boundary of  
patriarchal space.” To be on the  
boundary is essential —  
because it is dangerous,  
because it requires existential  
courage, because one cannot  
survive there alone and will,  
therefore, find community with  
sisters.  

The Courage to Be  
Daly speaks of the courage to  

be as a self and to be as a part,  
that is, the spirituality of the in-  
dividual and of the female com-  
munity cannot be separated. Re-  
jecting that Paradise is in the  
past, Daly says that “we have to  
learn to live now the future we  
are fighting for, rather than com-  
promising in vain hope of a  
future that is always deferred,  
always unreal. This creative leap  
implies a kind of recklessness  
born out of the death of false  
hope.”  

Daly maintains that feminists  
are “spiritual expatriates,” that  
many have rejected religion  
(justifiably) as the most demonic  
of all tools of male supremacy.  

However, radical feminists are  

also reaching for something  
beyond the opposition of  
male/female, and are searching  
on a spiritual level to discover  
the ultimate meaning of life. She  
says, “There is a remarkable  
radicalization of consciousness  
among these spiritual exiles,  
which often manifests itself in  
refusal to stop short at limited  
goals and particular issues . . .  
and constantly seeks to under-  
stand the deep implications of  
liberation.”  

Sisterhood as  
Cosmic Consciousness  

The changing of women's  
consciousness has given rise to  
the phenomenon of sisterhood.  
In individual women's journeys  
into being, they have met other  
women on the same route, and  
have formed a bond with those  
women. Daly calls this  
“Sisterhood as a Cosmic Cove-  
nant.” She believes that, in dis-  
covering this covenant, women  
are made aware of being, and of  
Being. This covenant among  
women is the dawn of the  
promise of the future in which  
we are both healers and  

prophets. “The covenant is a  
deep agreement that is present  
within the self and among the  
selves, who are increasingly in  
harmony with the environment  
that is beyond, beneath, and all  
around the nonenvironment of  
patriarchal splits and barriers.”  
This space of liberation, on the  
boundaries of the patriarchy, is  
sacred. It is the Anti-church. We  
are the Anti-christ.  

Women are the bearers of  
New Being — of the ultimate  
meaning and reality, which  
some would call God. The source  
of women’s energy is within us,  
and that center of energy is a  
moving space that requires  
communication, community,  
and creation. Women share in  
each other's power — in the  
“flow” of healing energy which  
is participation in the power of  
being.”  

Women’s Revolutionary  
Process  

In the battle against hierarchy,  
patriarchy, and the philosophical  
dichotomies that mind-rape  
humankind, Daly believes that  
women alone have the capacity  
to stop this rapism on all levels,  
and to move women and men to  
the state of androgyny. Her hope  
is based on the idea of attraction  
of people to what is good, since  
clearly women's process of  
revolution must be female-  
defined. Openness to diversity,  
to the uniqueness of individual's  
being, healing, celebration, and  
courage hallmark the female  
covenant. As Daly says, Being  
(God) is Becoming, which opens  
the doors to make us citizens of  
the future. The future is not  
hierarchical or dualistic. “If, as  
Nietzsche said, God is dead, ‘Is  
there any up or down left?’ Cor-  
rection: To the degree that God  
the Father is dead, swept under  

by the Living Final Cause (the  
women’s revolution), our move-  
ment is in all directions:  
backward, inward, sideward,  
forward, as is the case with life  
itself.”  

Daly demonstrates how men  
have set up the idea of the  
“Other” as a means of explain-  
ing reality and of justifying op-  
pression. The concept of the  
Other is the matriarchal mind  
too! which allows a person to  
define himself as good (or clean,  
or strong, or right), because the  
Other embodies what is bad, or  
dirty, or weak, or wrong. Thus  
women are the Other to men,  
Blacks are the Other to Whites,  
the poor are the Other to the  
rich, and so on. In her analysis,  
eventually all of these Others  
will affirm themselves and the  
oppressor will be confronted  
with himself.  

Man Faces the Horror  

Daly ends her book with an  
allegory of the point in time  
when men will be left without  
the support of the Others. She  
believes that when the Other  
refuses to be Other and says, "I  
am," that the patriarchal system  
will fall. She writes: “Dashing  
back inside, males would find  
other horrors: all of the Others —  
the whole crowd — would be in  
there, the lazy niggers, the dirty  
Chicanos, the greedy Jews, the  
faggots, the dykes, plus the en-  
tire crowd of Communists and  
the backward population of the  
Third World. Looking outward  
again, mirrorless males would  

ON THE WAY!  

be forced to see — people.”  
Where can he go? The ego mirror  
and the supports are gone. Kill-  
ing would be pointless because  
he knows the Enemy is Man  
himself.  

The foregoing is, of course,  
merely a brief overview of Daly's  
philosophy. Beyond God the  
Father includes many historical  
ideas which are especially in-  
teresting from her feminist  
perspective. For example, that  
the historical significance of  
Mary to the Catholic Church  
revolved around the refusal of  
people who had followed the  
“Old Religion” to be converted to  
Christianity without having a  
female symbol with whom they  
could identify; that while Mary  
was defined by the Church in  
relation to her son, there is a  
strong message of female  
autonomy in her meaning  
throughout history; that, as the  
Immaculate Conception, Mary  
was a woman who needed no  
savior; that Joan of Arc was seen  
by the people as God Incarnate  
in woman, and that she was  
killed because she signaled an  
escape from patriarchy. In addi-  
tion, Daly explores the ideas of  
ritual for women’s culture, and  
of Mothers’ and Daughters’ ris-  
ing up together being a Second  
Coming which will usher in a  
new age in the evolution of  
humankind. I must also add that  
her footnotes enrich the book  
greatly, and open new doors of  
inquiry for women who are ap-  
proaching a sense of Spirituality.

Toward a New Theology  

Jacqueline St. Joan  

Getting through this book re-  
quired a commitment of will  
power on my part. The language  
is condensed, the theories com-  
plicated, and Daly sometimes  
gets carried away with her own  
(quite good) imagery and  
vocabulary. I knew from reading  
the beginning pages, however,  
that this woman was not your  
basic reformist; and that she had  
a perception of reality that I  
wanted to explore. She has  
attempted to construct a female  
interpretation of the universe —  
a spiritual expression, a destiny  
in which we all share. She is not  
interested in settling for a  
“footing within the patriarchal  
space,” rather, she wants to par-  
ticipate in overthrowing male-  
defined methods of  
thinking/feeling/willing, of  
creating an entirely new  
spirituality which will overpower  
the structured evil of patriarchy.  
My criticisms lie more with what  
she omits than with what she af-  
firms.  

Men in the Covenant  

Daly is more optimistic about  
men than I am. She believes that  
as women form this covenant,  
removing supports from men,  
men will be forced to face  
themselves and will break down  
the walls within the male psy-  
che. They will see the promise of  
actually finding themselves and  
will desire androgyny and the  
covenant. Daly points out that  

this would mean the “loss of un-  
deserved privilege and prestige”  
for men, but does not explore the  
possibility that men will not  
relinquish their privilege.  
Perhaps it is my (male) leftist  
background, but need I point out  
that historically oppressors have  
never given up privilege in any  
more than a token gesture?  
Perhaps as women grow  
stronger, they will affect the  
consciousness of men, but  
patriarchy has been ingrained  
for thousands of years, so I can  
only assume that this con-  
sciousness of androgyny will  
take at least as long. Meanwhile,  
the earth will die, and if she  
doesn’t what form will the cove-  
nant take in the meantime?  

I believe the key to this ques-  
tion is to be found in Radical  
Lesbianism, and that Daly’s own  
consciousness is limited in this  
respect. Her book includes a  
two-page discussion of  
homosexuality (mostly discuss-  
ing how heterosexual women  
should respond to charges of  
Lesbianism), and she includes  
only one good paragraph raising  
the question of Radical  
Lesbianism, but offering no  
solutions. She says, “Women in  
groups are repeatedly asking  
whether, given our conditioning  
as women, we can ever wage a  
feminist revolution as long as we  
are psychosexually bound to  
men. There is no easy answer to  

such a question. It is important  
to repudiate the old dogmas con-  
cerning sexual behavior and it is  
also important to avoid setting  
up new ones.”  

Exploring a Non-dogma  
I am not interested in setting  
up new dogmas, but I do not  
think this question can be so  
lightly dismissed. The world is  
not made up of androgynous  
beings now (or if it is, they are all  
probably women), so that the  
patriarchal classifications of  
male/female, homosex-  
ual/heterosexual, still define  
political reality for us as  
feminists. If Daly is right, and  
eventually humankind will  
evolve into some kind of an-  
drogynous existence, the  
classifications of sex and sexual  
orientation would disappear.  
What Daly ignores is the  
wound that is currently festering  
in the women’s movement, and  
which is much in need of  
spiritual healing — the anger of  
Lesbians towards heterosexual  
women for continuing to spend  
their energies on men, rather  
than on the community of  
sisters, and the corresponding  
anger of heterosexual feminists,  
who don’t want to be “labeled,”  
or “defined by someone else.”  

Lesbianism as Spiritual  
Daly apparently sees  
Lesbianism as a “bedroom  
issue,” or who sleeps with  
whom. Lesbian Feminists re-  

spond that Lesbianism is a  
spiritual/political issue — that it  
is a totally integrated commit-  
ment to women. Perhaps we can  
get around what may sound like  
dogma (i.e., women should be  
Lesbians) by using the term  
“woman-identified.” Clearly, a  
woman cannot have a  
revolutionary consciousness if  
she is male-identified. The ques-  
tion is, however, if she is  
woman-identified, but is not a  
Lesbian, then how does she  
relate to men? Are they her sex-  
objects? Is that a revolutionary  
attitude toward men? Are they  
her “sons,” attracted to her  
strength? Are they feminists?  
How central is feminism to the  
lives of men? Or is she  
(passively) waiting for some  
woman to sweep her off her feet,  
so that no conscious act on her  
part is necessary (so maybe she  
can avoid the fear)?  

I submit that the evolutionary  
leap of consciousness to which  
Daly refers as necessary for a  
woman's becoming, eventually  
must include this choice of a  
total commitment to women.  
That the courage to be, that the  
risk taken, that the model-  
breaking model, that living on  
the boundary, must involve,  
once and for all, completely  
identifying and uniting with  
women. It is not only disturbing  
to be non-integrated, it is also  
unsatisfying and spiritually  

ON THE WAY!  

fragmenting to have one’s  
loyalties split. For many  
feminists, the experience of Les-  
bian community and love, has  
been a completion of that in-  
tegration.  

Sexuality and Consciousness  

We have all had enough of  
dogma, but our language and  
thought processes are still  
patriarchal, to some extent. I  
could reject the false categories  
of sexuality which the patriarchy  
has defined as meaningless  
dualities that prevent us further  
from conceiving our own  
perceptions of the world.  
However, in the feminist move-  
ment it has been useful to  
recognize the differing con-  
sciousnesses of male-identified  
women from women-identified  
women. These distinctions do  
not set up male-identified  
women as the Other, nor do Les-  
bian Feminists set up  
heterosexual women as the  
Other. But these distinctions do  
point to a lack of integration in  
her being, and a lessening of her  
powers of healing and of  
prophecy.  

While sexuality itself may ex-  
ist on some kind of continuum  
(Kinsey's 0-6 scale from ex-  
clusive heterosexuality to com-  
plete homosexuality), con-  
sciousness, or spiritual develop-  
ment inevitably requires a leap  
from being male-identified to be-  
ing female-identified. This ex-  
istential leap of one’s being in-  
volves the same kind of courage  
to face Nothingness and to em-  
brace what is reviled in this  
obscene society, namely  
women. Sexual relationships  
may or may not follow from such
