Chicanas Fight Welfare Injustices

Carol Lease

Chicana Welfare Rights is a
nationally organized, non-
funded group that functions
solely through the volunteer
work of welfare mothers, and
deals principally with welfare
injustice against the Chicano
community. The Chicanas
who founded this organization
had worked with the National
Welfare Rights Organization
which is, according to Patricia
Estrada who works with
Chicana Welfare Rights in
Colorado, “a predominately
black-interest group. One
reason we broke away from
NWRO was that they wouldn’t
recognize the need to have
forms printed in Spanish.”

The national headquarters
of Chicana Welfare Rights is
in Los Angeles with Alicia
Escalante as its head. Nation-
ally, the organization is in the
process of challenging the
Talmadge Amendment Public
Law 92-223 to the Social
Security Act which requires

those in need of public
assistance to register for
employment at the Depart-
ment of Employment or to
participate in the Work Incen-
tive Program (WIN). Locally,
the organization is primarily
fighting the inequities and
injustices of the welfare
system, and has become
involved in cases they term
“Parent Abuse” by the Denver
General Hospital, the Child
Welfare section of the Denver
Department of Welfare and the
Juvenile Courts.

The deaths of two children
earlier this year from child
abuse that wasn't recognized
as such or dealt with by
official agencies despite the
pleas of at least one parent
of one child and hospital and
social agency workers, has
created an “overreactionary
flood of suspected child
abuse and child neglect
cases,” says Ms. Estrada.
These cases have resulted in

Amendment

Wages

The Talmadge Amendment to the Social Security Act requires
all those in need of public assistance to either register for work
at the Department of Employment or participate in the Work

Incentive Program (WIN).
The Chicana Welfare Rights
organization believes that to
require people to work when
they need food, clothing and
shelter is in direct contradic-
tion to the philosophy of the
Social Security Act to help
people in need. The Talmadge
Amendment cannot help peo-
ple get off welfare. People are
required to register and to
look for work although jobs do
not exist. If they do find work,
they will work for their welfare
check and not for a minimum
wage. Supportive services,
child care and vocational re-
habilitation necessary to en-
able people to look for jobs
are nonexistent. Government
training programs have failed
to provide employable people.
The rights of women are
denied when a law forces a
woman to work outside the
home. It also ignores the right
of a family to stay together.
“Rider” Not Discussed
The Talmadge Amendment
was approved by both the
House and the Senate as a
rider to a bill which provided
burial payments to bereaved
relatives of deceased service-
men whose bodies could not
be recovered for burial from
Vietnam. Discussion — sur-
rounding the actual Amend-
ment arose from only one
Congressman, Mr. Byrnes of
Wisconsin. He felt that not
enough information nor dis-
cussion had been presented
about the bill. He also pointed
out that the bill had not been
totally printed more than a day
before presentation to enable
time to read and study the bill
- much less approve it.
Congressperson Gross
supported Mr. Byrnes in
stating he had mistakenly

thought he was approving
only a burial bill. However,
Congressperson Mills of Ar-
kansas replied that this was
the same bill Congress had
passed in 1972, but due to
disagreements (not identi-
fied), it was not approved.
Therefore, the only change
required would be to change
1972 to 1973. He also
reasoned that since the
session soon had to adjourn,
there was insufficient time to
explain the bill.

Byrnes withdrew his objec-
tion and the Talmadge A-
mendment was passed unani-
mously by 326 Congressmen
with 105 members absent.

The Chicana Welfare Rights
Organization hopes to call to
the attention of the taxpayers
the fact that most Congress-
men did not even know what
bill they were passing, al-
though they voted on spend-
ing millions of the taxpayers’
dollars. In addition, the
Chicanas are asking for indi-
vidual responses from Con-
gress members as to their
stand on the Talmadge A-
mendment in order to call
their attention to what can be
done.

At present, the Talmadge
Amendment is in its registra-
tion phase in Denver. In the
surrounding rural area, it is
being implemented through a
demonstration project called
the Public Service Employ-
ment (PSE). To date, the
program has been considered
a “success” in lowering the
welfare rolls because people
have not registered. The low
number of registrants is
played up as though welfare
recipients had been placed
into jobs.

PSE Required

The purpose of the Public
Service Employment is to
assist registrants to become
job-ready by giving them the
opportunity to learn new
skills, gain valuable work
experience, and to develop a
work history. Participation is
a requirement for welfare
eligibility. The registrants do
not receive a wage for their
PSE activity. They merely
work for their welfare check.
Another problem is that actual
employment opportunity does
not exist.

PSE participants do not
qualify for union jobs, nor for
unfilled vacant positions if
they are “established” job
positions, or jobs advertised
in the newspapers. PSE
participants qualify only for
“useful public services jobs
not otherwise accomplished.”
Such jobs need not be
full-time either. In other
words, PSEs qualify for the
jobs which don’t exist and are
trained (?) for undefined jobs.

Each registrant is required
to conduct an adequate job
search. If she discourages the
employers to hire her, has a
negative attitude, or in her
personal appearance is unac-
ceptable to employers, she is
considered to have conducted
an inadequate job search and,

therefore, is ineligible for
welfare.
Thus, if she does not have

the money to dress in an
appealing manner for the
employer's eye, she is out of
luck. If she tells the employer
that she does not like the job,
and that she could do
something better for a better
wage, she is out of luck. If she
complains about the condi-
tions surrounding her em-
ployment facilities, she is out

of luck. Her actions will be
considered as discouraging
the employer, and as a
negative attitude. In other
words, she neither has the
right to choose her employer,
nor her working conditions.
Neither does she have the
freedom to dissent, nor to tell
the truth.
WIN Program a Failure

The WIN program is regarded
by many as a failure. Only
11% of 223,302 people en-
rolled were placed in jobs.
Many programs offered meet-
ings and pep talks instead of
training. Fifty percent of the
frustrated, disappointed en-
rollees dropped out of the
programs as a result. Others
were discouraged due to bu-
reaucratic breakdowns which
slowed, or stopped financial
aid. Although many could
have taken advantage of more
meaningful programs out of
WIN, such programs would
not be sanctioned for sti-
pends. Only 40% of those
people placed in jobs are
receiving an annual income.
These jobs still require fami-
lies to stay on welfare. The 67
million dollars spent in the
