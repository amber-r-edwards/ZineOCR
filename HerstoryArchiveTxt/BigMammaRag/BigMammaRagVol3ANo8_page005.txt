Action for Forgotten Women

Prisoners Lay Seeds of Unity

Women

Jackie St. Joan

The following are excerpts
from an interview with Brooke
Whiting, one of the organizers of
Action for Forgotten Women, the
community group which supports
the inmates at Raleigh’s
women’s prison.

BMR: How did you become
involved in women’s prison
organizing?

BW: A couple of years back, I had
my first contact with women’s
prison. I was working with
another sister (Celine Chenier)
here in Durham in a drug
program for heroin addicts. We
hooked up with still another
sister who was running a drug
group therapy session within
women’s prison for women who
had drug-related crimes. So,
originally we went in to deal with
the women in terms of their drug
habits. But what we found out
was that the majority of them
were not dealing with drugs any
more, and they were not interested
in talking about drugs. But they
were very interested in talking
about some of the

problems they were encountering
inside the prison itself.

Prison Encourages Racism

They were talking about the
prison conditions, especially the
laundry (an issue raised on June
15) and decent medical care.
What we also found was a very
very strong underlying racial
division within the group. The
black women did not want to
have anything to do with the
white women, and the white
women did not want to have
anything to do with the black
women. The prison administration
used the technique of giving
white women more privileges
when it came to job assignments,
in order to divide the women
against each other. Like when it
came time for placement in the
laundry, which was considered
the worst job on

the camp, it was almost all black
inmates who were assigned. I
believe there was one white
inmate in the laundry. This was
done by design by the officials.
So in talking with the women
we had to talk to them about how
that technique was being used
to take the attention away from
the real problem, and the real
enemy in that situation. On
June 15, the unity was incredible.
They were all sisters struggling
towards the same goal, and that
perhaps was the most beautiful
thing — that they had overcome
that amount of racism. But it was
not without a lot of hard work. It
was in a mixed group all along
that we had tried to lay the seeds
of unity, in talking about it over a
period of two years.
BMR: How did you keep working
with the women after the drug
program stopped?
BW: After the drug program, we
continued to correspond with
the women, still stressing the
same points in the letters — the
connections between their
struggles inside and people
struggling outside. And about
the nature of society. And as the
women grew in political awareness,
more and more unity was
achieved on the camp.
BMR: What are good organizing
techniques for working with
women’s prisons?
BW: Face-to-face contact is
undoubtedly the best, but what
you find so frequently is that the
prison administration will not
allow you to have that face-to-face
contact. We tried many times to
become community volunteer
sponsors, which would allow us
to take women out of the prison
on pass, but few of us were able
to do this. Letter-writing has been our most
constant means of communication.
BMR: How was Action for
Forgotten Women formed?

BW: We got more and more
impatient with the problems the
sisters were having. So the two
of us who were basically doing
the thing finally decided we
needed more support. So we
organized a demonstration last
November outside the gates of
women’s prison. Now the basic
purpose of the demonstration
was to organize a working body
of people who would be willing
to deal with the problems — in
terms of research, to try to find
out where the problem actually
was. We were under the impression
at the time that the problem
was a budgetary one, because
we had done some research and
found some differential types of
budgetary allocation between
men’s and women’s prisons. For
example, a comparable-sized
men’s prison had a medical
doctor allocated to it — the
women's prison did not. The
men’s prison had more
counselors, more programs, and
so forth. So we're going to go to
the legislature to encourage
their support of bills to help
women’s prison. We did do some
of that.
AFW Attacks Attitudes

In addition, we had to deal
with the general attitude that
because someone has gone to
prison, they basically don't
deserve to have human needs
met. And the attitude that most
prisons emphasize order and
security, rather than rehabilitation
and meaningful job training.
We had to communicate inside
the prison about these attitudes
and in our dealings outside.

The group (AFW), in addition
to doing legislative support, also
did some supportive services for
the inmates — sending money,
stamps, some recreation
programs, like softball and
dances. We organized some
legal services for the sisters, but
could do so only on a minimal
basis.

Arizona Women Create

Nourishing

Woodwoman

“Total nourishment is how we
take responsibility for our
individual and collective growth —
physically, emotionally, mentally,
and spiritually. Learning about our nourishment process
is learning how we energize or
drain ourselves, learning how
we empower or disempower
ourselves, learning new ways to
create our revolution.”
— (from Information on the
Nourishing Space for Women)

A woman in Arizona has
purchased 160 acres of land
about 25 miles southeast of
Tucson to be a women's
nourishing space.

Kittu Riddle has trained as a
nutritionist and as a group
process person. Over the last
few years, she has been working
on the concept of total nourishment
of living systems. Her idea
for the nourishing space is that
women and children will live
there collectively, relating to the
land and to other living species;
and that out of their experience
and questioning will come

creative concepts about
nourishment, and new political
visions and strategies.

The land is in a canyon in the
southern part of the Rincon
Mountains, near the Coronado
National Forest. Kittu will retain
ownership until it becomes
feasible to turn it over to a
collective land trust. Meanwhile
she will continue to meet half
the monthly land payments (she
has already answered for the
deposit), and the rest, $500 a
month, will be covered by “rental” money, paid by the women
who live there.

The space will be developed by the
women who live there — so far
they include respect for ecology
and for other women; a belief
that decisions should be made
by those who are affected by
them; a belief that unequal
access to money does not buy
unequal privilege; a commitment
to developing the concept
of nourishment and to the
concept of a space apart for women
only. Goals and terms will,
however, be in constant process,
and will clarify themselves in
interaction with the land and
with the larger feminist community.

Limited housing space is
available, and there is plenty of
room for permanent tipis,
campers etc. Women who stay
for only a short time will be able
to contribute “rental” on a daily
basis.

The nourishing space needs
women to donate or lend money,
women to contribute skills,
women to hike or camp or live
there, and contribute their rent
money to the development of our
own space.
