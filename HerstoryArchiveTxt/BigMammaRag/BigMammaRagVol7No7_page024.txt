Putting People Before Profits

Terra

Besides the fight for jobs and for respect on the job, there is another battle being waged in the workplace by women workers -- the fight for safe and healthy working conditions.

Women have been fighting for safety and health in their jobs ever since they began entering the industrial and office workforce. However, most women work in unorganized jobs where it is more difficult to apply pressure on employers and on government to protect workers from health and safety hazards. And the special problems of women -- physiological and psychological, such as the stress of being a housewife and employed outside the home -- are just becoming recognized and studied by researchers and government authorities.

HAZARDS OF WORK

Sources of illness and injury exist in practically every occupation. Almost all workers are exposed to noise, dust, fumes, heat, stress, vibration, radiation, and poisonous chemicals of some sort on the job.

In 1970, annual figures on job health and safety included:

- Job-related accidents accounted for more than 14,090 worker deaths.
- Nearly 2.5 million workers were disabled.
- Ten times as many work-days were lost from job-related disabilities as from strikes.
- Estimated new cases of occupational diseases totaled 300,000.

The vulnerability of women due to their potential or actual pregnancy has been and still is often an excuse to exclude women from traditionally male jobs. And it is cheaper and easier for industry to exclude women rather than study dangers or make conditions safe. For example, a few years ago, at a General Motors lead battery plant in Oshawa, Canada, women working with lead were given a choice of sterilization or the loss of their jobs. Dow, Esso, and Dupont followed suit.

Of tens of thousands of chemical products produced, only a few have been tested for safety to a fetus or a woman's fertility. Research in Eastern Europe has shown that pregnant women working in the plastics industry and exposed to formaldehyde are at risk. In Italy, a state commission found a scandalous 20% of pottery workers had aborted or prematurely given birth. Many birth defects may be due to chemical exposure.

The need for many more studies, both general and women-oriented, is obvious. When the National Cancer Institute completed a study in 1978 on the relationship between cancer and occupation, they found that from 21-38% of all cancer cases in the U.S. may be traced to toxic substances and industrial poisons workers were exposed to on the job. This refuted previous estimates often cited by industry groups that only 1-5% of all cancer could be attributed to occupational factors.

Substances cited by the study were:
Asbestos - 17% of all cancers annually for the next 30-35 years.
Arsenic, benzene, coke oven by-products, and vinyl chloride - 1-35%.
Chromium, lead oxide, nickel, and petroleum distillates - 3-18%.

Highest risk occupations found were leather and shoes workers, coke oven workers, cadmium production workers, and metal miners.

An example of a less obvious threat is noise. Noise can affect office workers, cocktail waitresses in noisy bars, and factory workers to name a few. Too much noise can damage hearing as well as the rest of the body. This can include temporary hearing loss, permanent hearing loss due to continuous or extreme sudden noise, increased blood pressure and heart rate, and potentially serious illness of stress which also adversely affects fetal development.

WHAT IS ENERGY

Workplace safety has been a low priority of industry where profit comes first, and government where industry comes first. As George Meany, President of the AFL-CIO noted, Congress approved $135 million in 1976 for a swine flu epidemic that never occurred. "Yet, while 100,000 men and women die each year from occupational diseases, OSHA had a budget for fiscal 1978 of only $136 million. If an epidemic swept this nation killing 100,000 Americans, Congress would spare no expense to find a cure. Why, then this nickel and dime approach to making the workplace healthier?"

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) was created within the Department of Labor in 1970 to fight the negligence and ignorance concerning workplace health and safety. They have authority to set standards and enforce them and record job-related injuries and illnesses for research purposes. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is the government research source for OSHA.

LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND RIGHTS

According to OSHA regulations, it is the employee's responsibility to:

- Read the OSHA poster at the job site.
- Comply with all applicable OSHA standards.
- Follow all employer safety and health rules and regulations, and wear or use prescribed protective equipment while engaged in work.
- Report hazardous conditions to the supervisor.
- Report any job-related injury or illness to the employer, and seek treatment promptly.
- Cooperate with OSHA compliance officer conducting an inspection if he or she inquires about safety and health conditions in your workplace.
- Exercise your rights under the ACT in a responsible manner.

Employee rights include:

- Review copies of any of the OSHA standards, rules, regulations, and requirements that the employer should have available at the workplace.
- Request information from your employer on safety and health hazards in the area, on precautions that may be taken, and on procedures to be followed if an employee is involved in an accident or exposed to toxic substances.
- Submit a written request to the NIOSH for information on the potential toxic effects of substances used in your workplace and (upon your request) have your name withheld from your employer. The NIOSH address is: NIOSH, Dept of HEW, 5600 Fisher Lane, Rockville, MD 20852.
- Request in writing the OSHA director to conduct an investigation if you believe hazardous conditions or violations of standards exist in your workplace.
- Have your name withheld from your employer, upon request to OSHA, if you file a written and signed complaint.
- Be advised of OSHA actions regarding your complaint and have an informal review, if requested, of any decision not to make an inspection or not to issue a citation.
- File a complaint to OSHA within 30 days if you believe you have been discriminated against, discharged, demoted, or otherwise penalized because of asserting an employee right under the ACT, and be notified by OSHA of its determination within 90 days of filing.
- When an OSHA compliance officer comes for an inspection, an employee representative may accompany her or him, and any employee may respond to questions by the compliance officer and request a closing discussion with the officer following an inspection.
- Observe any monitoring or measuring of hazardous materials, as specified under the ACT.
- Object to the abatement (correction) period set in the citation issued to your employer by writing to the OSHA area director within 15 working days of the issuance of the citation.
- Be notified by your employer if he or she applies for a variance from an OSHA standard, testify at a variance hearing, and appeal the final decision if you disagree with it.
- Submit information or comment to OSHA on the issuance, modification, or revocation of OSHA standards and request a public hearing.

A source of information specifically for women is the Women's Occupational Health Resource Center (WOHRC), housed in the American Health Foundation, NYC. It has been organized to collect and interpret scientific information concerning occupational health of women, and to inform occupational health organizations of activities that focus on women’s issues.

The WOHRC has also developed a Personal Protective Equipment Information Bureau to help women workers find the proper protective equipment to suit their specific needs.

Their newsletter and further information can be obtained at: WOHRC-American Health Foundation, 320 E 43rd Street, New York City, NY 10017. Phone is (212) 953-1900.

Syndrome” Dying?

Lt. Governor Nancy Dick cited the familiar statistics of women earning 59¢ to every dollar a man earns (down from 63¢ in 1956), of the 14 million women who are heads of households and of a projection that 3/4 of all women will be in the labor force by 1985. The purpose of the conference, she said, had to be to “free women of economic bondage."

The diversity of the women present seemed enormous. Many were dressed in the latest fashions and referred to each other as "girls" or "gals," and seemed most concerned about learning the rules of the game played by “the boys" in order to succeed. "Games Mother Never Taught You," a book on corporate gamesmanship for women, sold out within the first few hours. (See book review in BMR, February/March, 1979).

On the other hand, I was impressed by the inventiveness of many of the women there. Several wanted to open businesses that provided for needs that have either been ignored or exploited by men.

One 66-year-old woman, for example, is starting a business designing and manufacturing clothes for people who are confined to wheelchairs. Others talked of organizing a childcare center downtown for women who work there.

I also felt a real sense of common purpose and mutual concern develop during the two days of workshops, meals, and discussions.

When Rep. Pat Schroeder, after citing the contributions of Mary Goddard, Harriet Tubman, and other women of our history, called on the women to see themselves and their own contributions as linked with those of the women in the past and the women of the future, she drew a long round of applause.

For many of the women, the conference seemed to be a consciousness-raising occasion. I heard several say how they had never known they could enjoy the company of women so much. One woman cried. She said she was used to being taken seriously.

I left the conference wondering... will these women develop new ways of providing for human needs in this capitalist system? Will they be able to take from traditional businesses the organizational expertise needed, while leaving some of the dehumanizing features behind? If some women acquire power in the system, how will they use it? Could the queen-bee syndrome be dying out?
