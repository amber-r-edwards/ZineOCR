is not listed as an active corporation
but California Feminist Corp. is
active. Cal-Fem was set up to manage
the health center and to legally siphon
off its profits. The Secretary
of State's Office had no listing of
officers for Cal-Fem.)

I have interviews with former staff
members, one of whom was promoted to
director. Let them speak for themselves.

Hiring

Nancy K. Eng worked at OFWHC for a
year and a half. When Nancy was hired
the rules at hiring were 1) you had to
give one year's commitment; 2) you
could not be in therapy; 3) you could
not be a socialist; 4) you could not
be in school. People were told that
no matter where they were, they repre-
sented the OFWHC--so they were not to
talk about the center, even to their
lovers, unless they were one of the
few people qualified to represent it.

When Nancy was hired she was not a
feminist and was straight. She now be-
lieves she was in favor because she is
Asian. They promoted her to director
in three months. She had never run a
business, was not politically astute,
could not make business decisions.
After a while they realized their
error and stopped asking her questions.
She was busted down to staff, to con-
tract worker, back to staff, and finally fired.

Medley, former staff member at OFWHC,

"I called to volunteer, was hired...
I had one week to graduate, but I quit
school (a requirement of hiring). I
went hook, line and sinker for their
line: feminism, love, growth, support,
sisterhood, I was ready to do anything
to work there and I did: 60-70 hours
a week in the name of feminism.

"I made a year commitment, and I was

fired after four months with one
hour's notice. It was not a recipro-
cal commitment. I thought it was me
that was wrong. If you've been
searching for something to do, and
you're getting paid for doing what
you've been searching for, it's a pri-
vilege. They suck you in with that
privilege."

Margaret Sloan: "They offered me
$2,000 to come out from Michigan to
speak. I came out and they ended up
paying me $200. I was impressed with
Laura's vision. Laura said ‘We could
give you a salary of $110 every week
and you could work on your book.’ So,
I moved here.

"I was told I couldn't start working
on my book until I learned about abor-
tion clinics...then it was an unusual
time and they needed the help and I
ended up working many, many hours and
getting called to fill in on my time
off.

"All my mail was opened before I got
it, and I only got it if it was con-
sidered all right to give it to me.
I was told ‘You belong to the Health
Center now.'"

Wages, Working Conditions

Nancy K. Eng: “The work week was 60
hours, 6 days. The salary began at
$110 base pay; but trainees got 80%
of that. Sometimes people got 50, 60,
or 70% of what they should get, depend-
ing on the finances of the Center.
So people sometimes got 50% of 80% of
$110, or $44 for a 60-hour week."

"After a year you could become a di-
rector--if you were qualified. Quali-
fications were determined arbitrarily
by Barbara and Laura."

Mary Farrell, a pseudonym for a
contract worker who doesn't want
her name used. She was hired through
the work-study program at the univer-
sity (contract workers could be
students). She feels disillusioned
by the OFWHC.

"I wouldn't say don't join forces
with them, they're terrible people.
I was turned on by them in a lot of
ways, especially the self-help
classes."

She thinks that if some new blood
came into the organization, it might
help; praises the OFWHC women for
struggling and working hard. When
they let her go, they told her she wasn't assertive enough, and afterwards
she thought maybe they were right,
maybe it was her fault. However, she
was fired at the same time as she
graduated from school--the work-study
program was paying 70% of her salary
of $2.50/hr. and when she graduated
that money wasn't coming any more.

Racism

The Health Center was structurally
racist insofar as the directors and
staff were predominantly white and
the contract workers were predomin-
antly minority women. Third World
women, like Nancy Eng, Roberta Chiang,
and Margaret Sloan were hired as win-
dow dressing in order to bring more
Third World customers into the Center,
or to lend the appearance of an anti-
racist policy. However, they were
never allowed real power and their
political beliefs and cultural differ-
ences were discounted and dismissed.

Margaret Sloan: "When racism was
mentioned, the easy way out was ‘We're
working on racism.' When I would
call something racist; they would say,
‘The Health Center does not support
racism! Give us something specific.'"

"Roberta Chiang: "As a Third World
woman I am very concerned about the
economic roots of oppression. There
was no room for that kind of analysis
in the OFWHC: by inference, men
seemed the only enemy."

"Shoshana," a pseudonym for a woman
who didn't want her name used: “One
of the requirements of the job was to
work whenever she was told. She asked
to be excused on Friday night in order
to celebrate the Sabbath. Laura re-
plied by saying ‘How could you want to
do something so patriarchal and sex-
ist? You work when we tell you to or
quit.'" Shoshana felt that Laura's
attitude was contemptuous and anti-
Semitic.

Finances

I believe that the weekly income
report presented to staff was doctored
in order to conceal the actual amount
of income, and provide the excuse for
underpaying employees. Where did the
money go?

Laura and Barbara, together with any
employees who were in favor at the
time, took frequent trips around the
country to do "political work", to
help set up other health centers and
hold self-help demonstrations. I have
no quarrel with self-help demonstra-
tions, cross-country tours, and set-
ting up health centers.

My beef is that the staff was
deceived, they were ripped off--for
no purpose other than to consolidate
power in the hands of a few. Laura and
her favorites monopolized the posi-
tions of power and the "plum" jobs,
the speaking engagements and contact
outside the Health Center.

A lot of money simply disappeared,
and there is no way to account for it.
A lot of it went into the FEN project
in Detroit--again, without the con-
sent of the people who earned it.

Where did the money come from?

Nancy gave me the figures on the
abortion fees. The scale was from
$160 to $235. Now the base rate has
gone up to $185. The charge was based
on family income; if you were a single
woman without dependents making less
than $650 a month it cost $160. A
woman's work was always taken in this
matter--no profit. A pre-emptive abor-
tion cost $85.

Of this money, $116 was for the
doctor, lab costs and equipment. The
rest went to rent and salaries. The
abortions in best estimates were
from 7 to 20 a week. Other money came
in from donations, the GYN clinic,
speaking honorariums, and government
grants, Title XX money, and Medi-Cal.

Nancy Eng: "The GYN and abortion
clinic were the money-makers, but they
were considered shitwork. The politi-
cal work was done by the directors,
which included travel and long dis-
tance calls. The phone bill was often
$1,000 a month, which was considered
a sign of how much good political
work was being done. When Laura
or Barbara were on a trip, they got
whatever money they asked for."

Where did the money go? In a tele-
phone discussion, Laura Brown admitted
to me that Cal-Fem was set up to
evade the non-profit laws (the Health
Center is non-profit). I want to state
for the record that I don't care
whether the Man's "law" is broken--

I do care where money comes from and
how it is used.

I interviewed "Felicia Bond," a
pseudonym for an ex-contract worker
who is a full-charge bookkeeper. She
fears retaliation. She helped shift
to the "management" contract with
Cal-Fem, the dummy corporation set up
to divert Health Center funds to FEN.

"Felicia" says the books were in such
a mess that lots could have gone
on. She showed me a financial state-
ment for the year 1975 which lists
$30,437.34 in “allocated overhead
costs"--this does not include rent
or phone. She says she couldn't
figure out what the money went for.
The statement she showed me was a
xerox of a computer printout, and
she said that errors can be fed into
a computer and never caught. After she
left, she believes Joanne Parrent
came in and fixed the books.

"Jane Ev" (a pseudonym) worked
as the accountant for the OFWHC. “I
read an internal memo discussing plans
for setting up a CPA firm via a loan
arrangement, in order to have the
OFWHC and FEN books audited by a
friendly person. The CPA firm could
not be owned directly by FEN accord-
ing to law, because the Securities
Exchange Commission requires that a
CPA firm not be linked to the firm it
is auditing.

Medical Care

The abortions performed at the OFWHC
were basically safe, in line with
standard medical practice.

The politics of the OFWHC and the
women's health movement began with the
idea of consumer control of health
care; of breaking the medical monop-
oly; of putting knowledge and deci-
sion-making power into women's hands.
However, the OFWHC has perverted these
aims--control is in the hands of the
directors of the center, not the con-
sumers of the GYN workers.

Physicians were treated as techni-
cians, as contract employees in order
to break the power of the medical
professions and put it back in the
hands of women. While I agree with
this aim, I do not agree with the
methods that were used at the OFWHC
because they resulted in inadequate
patient care.

Physicians were not permitted to
talk to patients or staff, only to
directors.

Mary Farrell (a pseudonym). She
told me that male partners of women
seeking abortions were discouraged
from coming to the clinic, even if the
women wanted them there. They were
made to wait in the other room if
they showed up.

"Roberta Chiang" believes that the
care was good. “The only allegiance
I had to the OFWHC was that the clinic
was one place where women could get
quality health care at affordable
prices. That was my main reason for
working there, plus of course being
unemployed."

The Berkeley Women's Health Collec-
tive keeps files on doctors and clin-
ics, in order to help them make refer-
rals. Women are asked to complete
forms and drop them in the mail with-
out signing their names. Feedback on
the GYN and birth control clinics of
the Health Center was entirely posi-
tive. Some comments were "the staff
is pleasant, informative, relaxed and
friendly." Pap-smear and self-help
classes were commended.

Feedback on the abortion clinics
was entirely negative. "Very bad."
"Insensitive." "I had a very painful
abortion and a very bad recovery,"

"I really wanted something for the
pain."

A current supporter of Laura Brown in
a private conversation with me: “Laura
tells me it is the policy of the OFWHC
‘to make abortions difficult, not a
soothing experience. They don't want
to be patching up the messes left by
men, making it easy for the women to
come back over and over again. They
want to give the women incentive to
not come back. I think this is a very
radical idea."

Means of Control

How do these women manage to control
the staff, to isolate and intimidate
everyone who comes into contact with
them? Why is it that people are afraid
to talk to me, ashamed of telling their
stories? Why do people work at the
Health Center if conditions are so
awful?

Part of the answer is that we are in
a time of recession. Jobs are hard to
find, particularly for women without
skills, Third World women and overt
lesbians. People will put up with
horrible conditions if their liveli-
hoods depend on it.

Control was achieved by isolating
women from outside influences, by keep-
ing them at work in the name of "fem-
inism" until they were too exhausted to
do anything else. Women in the Bay
Area who didn't support the Health
Center were described as “downwardly
mobile hippies; jealous because our
Center can pay salaries and they can't,
lazy fuck-offs who don't work as hard
as we do.

One of the most effective devices for
control was the policy meeting, which
was compulsory for staff members. It
consisted of Laura and Barbara deliver-
ing lectures to a terrified staff.

Here are descriptions:

Nancy Eng attended a rape conference
on her day off. Laura and Roseanne
spoke up at the conference. She was
expected to speak up in support of
their position, though she wasn't
aware of that expectation. Later,
Laura and Roseanne walked out of the
conference. Nancy was lambasted for
not speaking in their support and for
staying at the conference after they
left.

"Roberta Chiang": “Laura was always
the exception to the rules she made.
One rule was one cigarette at a meet-
ing, except Laura. She would say
‘Always give credit where credit is
due.' And credit was always due to
Laura. She would say ‘Do you know
what it's like to be a genius in a
roomful of assholes?'"

Firing

What happened to women who got
fired? How were they fired? Here are
some stories. They remind me of
Communist Party purges.

Margaret Sloan: “After I was fired,
people treated me like a leper, and
that reinforced my feelings that it
was all my fault. Even after they
fired me, I got Gloria Steinem to do
a benefit for them. I made $1,400
for them. Gloria asked me ‘How come
you're not on staff?’ I said I was
writing. I didn't tell anyone. I
thought I was wrong, and I thought the
answer was to kill myself. I thought
I'm not enough of a good feminist.

The place was hypnotic."

"Shoshana" and four other women sub-
mitted a list of demands. They asked
that the maximum work week be 45 hours
for full-time staff and 25 hours for
part-time staff; and that the opinions
of women who worked fewer hours be
treated with respect--as much respect as
was given to those working longer hours.

The response was:

"If you are willing to accept this
form of commitment and can live with
it without being self-centered and
destructive to those of us that are
building a better world for all of us,
we hope you will stay. If not, we
are sorry to see you get off the pot.
As soon as you become less constipated
you are welcome to come shit with us.”
(OFWHC memo)

Nancy Eng was fired twice, the first
time over personal business. The
second time she and Judy Koretsky were
asked to leave by the staff at Laura's
