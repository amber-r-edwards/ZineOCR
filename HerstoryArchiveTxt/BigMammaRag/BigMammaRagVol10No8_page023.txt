asking support for the cause
of a group of striking in-
surance workers in Ottawa.

insurance company is trying
to bust their union and has
replaced the striking work-
ers with scab labor. You can
send money and letters of
support to the strikers at
Local 225, OPEIU, c/o Mich-
elle Plouffe, 150 Blvd
