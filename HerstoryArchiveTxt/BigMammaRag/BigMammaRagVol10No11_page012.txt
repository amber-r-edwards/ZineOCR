The Rapist Who Pays the Rent  
is more than a timely pub-  
lication that makes the  
definitive case for the crim-  
inalization of marital rape.  
To make that case, the book  

book review  

breaks the silence between  
Black women and white on many  
levels and clarifies in the  
process crucial questions of  
the anti-rape movement: the  
question of rape and race and  
the question of the respon-  
sibility of the State for the  
crime of rape.

test: Rape and Race,”  
Wilmette Brown of Black  

Women for Wages for Housework  
writes: Racism, in selecting  
whom to prosecute and convict  
as rapists, conspires with  
the legal invisibility of  
rape in the family to hide  
white rapists and white rape  
victims: 10% of men in the  
USA who are Black cannot be  
committing more rape than the  
90% who are white. Nor can  
the South African police hide  
Apartheid: where rape is the  
prerogative of the white  
master over his white wife  
and his Black servants, woman  
and man....We have no reason  
to believe that police sta-  
tistics are published to  
protect us...Police rape  
statistics attack Black men  
in the name of rape victims  
to undermine the power of  
Black and white women to  
fight rape together.  

Wilmette Brown concludes that  

‘the Evidence by WAR verifies  

what Black women already  
know: that white women cannot  
fight rape without challeng-  
ing the legal Establishment.

that turns any of us into  
niggers, and that the issue  
of rape cannot be separated  
from the total predicament  
Black women are fighting."  
This is the second document  
I know of which confronts the  
legal Establishment on the  
responsibility of the State  
for the crime of rape (Every  
Woman's Handbook on Compen-  
sation for Rape, by the Rape  

Action Project, 1981). While  
the State claims that its  
primary function is to pro-  
tect its citizens, "it is  
perfectly clear that indi-  
vidual men rape individual  
women and girls in all kinds  
of circumstances...and it is  
finally beginning to be  
accepted that most rape and  
violence against women and

IS A CRIME  
AGAINST HUMANITY  

-Phoenix Rising  

Dear BMR,  

Sorry none of us have got-  
ten it together to write an  
article about an amazing vic-  
tory.  

“On Nov. 2 Berkeley voters  
passed Measure T which banned  
electroshock within the city  
limits. The APA (American  
Psychiatric Association) poured  
$20,000 into the cam-  
paign against Measure T and  
hired a slick public relat-  
ions firm.  

With a total budget of  
$2,000, the Coalition to Stop  
Electroshock won easily with  
60% of the vote (about 25,000  
people voted yes on T).  

The anti-psychiatry move-  
ment here has been fighting  
electroshock for the past  
ten years and holding demon-  
strations in Berkeley since  
1974.  

In the last year many other  
organizations joined the  
struggle, including the Berk-  
eley Free Clinic, Berkeley  
Support Services and Berkeley  
Citizens Action, the radical  
political party.  

Measure T received the en-  
dorsement of Mayor Cris New-  

port, Congressman Ron Dellums,  
City Council Member Flo-  
rence McDonald, and most of  
the feminist and left commu-  
nity. The initiative has recei-  
ved a tremendous amount of  
national media attention, in-  
cluding several articles in  
the New York Times, an art-  
icle in Newsweek, and nation-  
al TV and radio programs.  
However, in the Times article  
the editorial is mistaken in  
saying that patients must  
consent before they can be  
given electroshock.  

In California a patient may  
be declared incapable of gi-  
ving informed consent and a  
relative may sign for the  
procedure.  

It's also unfortunate that  
they view the National Insti-  
tute of Health as an objec-  

tive body.
