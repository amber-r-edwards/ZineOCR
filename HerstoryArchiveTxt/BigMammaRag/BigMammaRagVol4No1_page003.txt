Letters Home To Mama

Emily Harris

Greetings, Sisters & Brothers,

The media speak of my locked
down status and my rage and my
disrespect for this system of in-
justice as if it were unique. They
ignore the thousands of angry
sisters like me who refuse to
lead poor butchered half-lives. I
am one among many women
who are building for a revolu-
tion in this country. I am one
among many women locked
down in the jails, prisons and
mental hospitals for refusal to fit
the mold of passive femininity.
All of us mean to survive on our
own terms, building a revolu-
tionary people’s culture as we
fight the terror, genocide, rob-
bery, decadence and despair of
U.S. imperialism.

Like many other sisters, I see

that women must provide
leadership on all levels of strug-
gle — legal and clandestine,

armed and unarmed, peaceful
and violent — all fitting together
as part of a coordinated strategy
for our total liberation as
women. Sexism is rooted in the
very foundations of U.S.
imperialism. I can feel the brutal
oppression of the whole system
by looking at one small fraction
— my own experience. I can see
the traps that were set for me
(and for every woman) at each
step along the way from child-
hood to womanhood. I see many
attempts to neutralize my ag-
gressive tendencies, define me
in terms of men, isolate me from
other women. In terms of work, I
was always underemployed,
underpaid and expendable. I
was brainwashed to have as-
pirations toward a monoga-
mous marriage in which I would

provide a lifetime of unpaid
labor. As a white woman I was
supposed to feel honored that I
was given the ultra-fem position
of being more fragile and there-
fore more respectable than my
Third World sisters. From this
position I learned the un-
natural, repressive sexual atti-
tudes that deprived me of the
warmth and honesty of human
emotion shared between friends
and lovers alike. As a revolu-
tionary woman I have always
been motivated by a sense of my
own experience, not because I
feel my oppression, present or
past, is more intense than that of
other sisters and brothers; but
because my true anger surfaces
around things that have hap-
pened to me, not things I read or
hear about. My solidarity with
other oppressed people in this
country and throughout the
world grows from sharing a
common experience — we are
under the life threat of a
common enemy. None of us can
be free until we are all free!
Too often whites discount the
messages of their own life and
interpret the so-called “privilege
of white skin” to mean that their
experience must be solely that of
oppressor rather than oppres-
sed. It is clear that the contra-
dictions of society are the most
viciously blatant to those who
are the most oppressed; how-
ever, no one is immune. If we
can have the courage to look be-
yond the consumer flea market,
beyond the network of phoney
privilege and false divisions, be-
yond the corrupt brainwashing
of the media and our educa-
tional system; then we can begin
to understand the true set of cir-

cumstances we find ourselves in
where a ruling elite attempts to
use the rest of us as pawns in
their international power game.
As women we fight for a
society where all women can be
proud of their strength and in-
dependence; where women are
not forced into subservient posi-
tions; where women’s recogni-
tion is not based on a charade of
appearing weak, fragile and “not
too smart;” where the pleasure
of being with our children is not
destroyed by the overburdening
responsibility of raising them
alone; where spheres of work
are not restricted by a person's
sex, with women often forced on
welfare because their labor is
considered expendable; where
women do not have to exist
under the constant threat of rape
and involuntary sterilization;
where love, unity and coopera-
tion among women has the op-
portunity to develop and grow to
its highest potential; where
women and men are forced into
confining stereotypes based on
sex that weaken and divide them
one from the other; where all
people can lead meaningful
lives, engage in productive work
and have adequate
clothing, housing, medical care
and education; where the joy we
can give to each other is not des-
troyed by the cruel desperation
of competing for survival
crumbs.
I see that these aspirations
will remain futile hopes and
dreams unless our goal be-
comes the revolutionary over-
throw of this imperialist/fascist
society. Anything less would
necessarily give openings to a
few token individuals while
others are starved, locked up or
shot in the back. Anything less
would never root out the sexism,
racism and classism which lie at
the very foundation of our op-
pression as women.
I have worked in the under-
ground to develop the guerrilla
front because I see armed pro-
paganda as an essential comple-
ment to mass organizing in
building for revolution. At this
time the guerrilla front height-
ens contradictions as in the
Hearst kidnapping where the
wealth of the enemy ruling class
was seen in sharp contrast to the
hunger of poor people. A further
objective of the guerrilla front is
to heighten the tactical level of
struggle whenever it becomes
clear in our communities that
peaceful methods will not meet
our needs, as when the BLA at-
tacked the occupying army of
police in the Black community.
The long-range goal of the guer-
rilla front is to build the well-
trained nucleus of the future
people's army. I see the strategy
of armed struggle as the means
by which we ensure our victory
over U.S. imperialism. The
leadership of women on all
levels of this struggle is the
means by which women ensure
that our interests are fully re-
presented and fought for at each
step along the way.
I feel strongly that women
cannot delay in developing and
supporting the guerrilla front be-
cause if we do not learn to pro-
tect and defend ourselves we
will always be caught unpre-
pared as the monster we are
fighting continues to throw our
sisters and brothers up against
the wall. The fascist beast has
already tried in vain to lock up
the fighting spirit of Marilyn
Buck, Susan Saxe, Assata
Shakur, Lolita Lebron, Safiya
Bukhari and many other strong
sisters who are defined as a
threat to society because they
would accept nothing short of
their own freedom and self-
determination. But to the beast’s
dismay, the beautiful reflection
of these dragons is magnified a
thousand times on the streets
through the work of many more
struggling people whose love
and rage will culminate in the
death of the old order and the
birth of the new. Until that day,
there can be no peace without
food,

&

freedom.

There is much more I would
like to say but mostly I would like
to hear from y’all.

Love and Rage,
Your sister in struggle,
Emily

Support for Fat Women

Dear Sisters:

Feminists have been too slow
to support their fat sisters
against persecution, and, as
often as not, have added their
strength to that persecution, so
that we fat women are de-
moralized within the feminist
movement and without it.

I'm writing to tell you how
excited and happy I was to read
in your December issue your
policy of support for fat women,
in your boycott and criticism of
anti-fat material, The Ripening
Fig, by lesbians Martha and Lucy
Van Felix-Wilde. I hope that the
important medical and political
issues of fat women’s liberation
will be discussed in BMR. The
more women read about it, the
more we will re-unite fat and
non-fat women, and do away
with the prejudices that weaken
our collective power.

According to the review of The
Ripening Fig, its authors defend
themselves against the charge
of anti-fat bigotry by saying that
“the characters and situations
were all people they knew or had
heard of. They knew only ob-
noxious fat people, so their fat
people were obnoxious.” But
there’s a point to be made here:
Aren't feminists considered ob-
noxious by sexist, chauvinist
men? Uppity oppressed people
usually seem obnoxious to those
who oppress them, or who
benefit (by getting to feel
superior?) from their being op-
pressed.

Furthermore, I think that the
experience of oppression maims
some people so badly that they
cannot be expected to be gra-
cious, friendly, “beautiful” — or
even pleasant — “souls.” May-
be all the fat people who Martha
and Lucy knew really were ob-
noxious — so what? They were
certainly persecuted enough.
We have to take a radical stand
for liberation, and not limit it to
being a reward for having a
“beautiful soul,” as many les-
bian feminists I know tend to
do.

Also, I want to commend you
for the article on the
liberal/radical split among Los
Angeles lesbians. As a staffer of
the Women’s Center, I’ve felt in
the middle of a storm. How
validating to get support from
sisters 1000 miles away!

And, Blue’s article on the
Politics of Health was just ex-
cellent! I'm eager to read the
articles that will follow on this
subject.

In sisterhood,
Aldebaran

The “Fig” is Sincere

Dear Sisters,

We are writing regarding your
statement in the December
issue (vol. 3A No 12 page 4)
“One of the responsibilities of a
radical feminist is to follow
through on the political stances
with which she identifies.” We
believe this to be true. We also

<Kardeeh

believe that as ‘Feminist Press”
we have the responsibility to be
open and responsive to all our
sisters and to present the
various sides of relevant issues.
The review of “The Ripening
Fig” was one with which we dis-
agreed — we found the book to
be important and valuable and
one that we would wish our sis-
ters to read — we respect the
right of sisters to disagree with
(and to criticize) but we must not
attempt to “rewrite anyone
else's reality.” Fig is a sincere at-
tempt to portray things the way
they were, are and can ul-
timately be. We do not all en-
vision the same utopia but to
deny access to Feminist media to
authors of this caliber cannot be
the correct way to deal with dif-
ferences in ideals and goals.
We urge Big Mama Rag to
read Fig and their statement
again and give a great deal more
thought to censorship as a viable
means of building the future — we hope you will come to see
that this is the first step in the
wrong direction. Surely, we can
find some other way to ul-
timately decide whose brand of
feminism is/will be the one way
(if we are to be forced to ever
come to such an exclusive view),
or to express our views without
denying the views of our sis-
ters.

Reading Fig was like taking a
trip through my past (and the
past of many of my sisters). A
past filled with disillusion and
disappointment, a present filled
with hope and anticipation and
finally, coming to a new place.
I'm too jaded to envision myself
entering the ‘new land” with my
sisters but it brings me great joy
to know that my sisters are
writing of it and if Martha & Lucy
Van Felix-Wilde are the femin-
ists of the future, nothing has
been in vain.

In love and sisterhood,
Stacey M. Franchild

Cohen Clarifies Analysis

Dear Sisters at Big Mama Rag,

I appreciate having had the op-
portunity to state my position on
Sagaris in BMR. I am disturbed,
however, by the BMR state-
ment that “much of the basis of
the split that occurred second
session is discussed in (my)
letter.” The, perhaps uninten-
tional, implication is that I sup-
port the analysis of the August
7th Survival Community. In fact,
I disagree with many points in
the Survival Statement, parti-
cularly the position on the col-
lective’s acceptance of the Ms.
grant. My analysis and that of
many of the dissenting session 1
participants, is different from
that of the Survival Community.

The Survival Community’s use
of the Ms. grant as an issue,
