Getting blue-collar jobs with
good training and advancement potential is not an easy, instant process
for women. Patience and perseverance

are required—both to get skilled
trade and to keep one. Being the
only woman, or one of very few women
employed in a non-traditional work

setting where resistance toward the
individual's selected occupational
direction is high can pose

serious problems. Stated quite simply, the resistance may range from

verbal abuse to physical and sexual
assault. Women entering trade work
need to get to know other women em-
ployed in blue-collar jobs and then
provide each other the power of mutual
support.

As women choose to exercise new
employment and training options in
the skilled trades, the issue of negative
attitudes toward working women
is accentuated. Many people have negative
feelings about women who work
outside the home for pay. It is also
not surprising, then, to find that
there is hostility directed at
women who venture into previously

male occupations.
Nevertheless, women are beginning
and will continue to demand equal em-

ployment opportunities. Occasionally

Industry, labor, and apprenticeship
sponsors strongly opposed the
adoption of hiring goals for women
based on the premise that there
were few qualified women available
and that hiring goals would force
them to hire unqualified workers.
Thus qualified men would be forced
off the payroll. Women's groups
strongly endorsed the new regulations
stating without the specific affirmative
action steps, particularly the
goals and timetables, very little
would be done to increase the partic-
ipation rate of women in the skilled
trades.

we hear about a woman carpenter, or
a woman ironworker, or a woman plasterer. Unfortunately, as long as
these women are classified as “the
new breed," “extraordinary women,”
"super women," we can be sure things
are not quite equal or not quite
right. These women are not some
"non-traditional species;" these
women are simply persons seeking
equal access to equal work and equal
earnings. The women choosing blue-
collar work are ordinary but extra-
ordinary expectations and challenges
are placed upon them for stepping
beyond the traditional

ROSIE the RIVETER
HAS DAUGHTERS

Rosie, the Riveter was the symbolic
name given to female war workers
during WWII. Romanticized as the

middle-class housewife who answered
her nation's plea for female workers
needed to move into the highly paid,
unionized manufacturing jobs left

vacant by men going into service; in
reality she sought the factory work
for reasons besides patriotic zeal.

Demand, good pay, seniority rights,

union benefits, and advancement opp-
ortunities lured these women from
their previously held low-paying
and insecure positions in service
occupations. Three million "Rosies" joined
the workforce during the war and
practically as many left their jobs
afterwards.
But no choice, for after the
war, these “home front" soldiers were
systematically laid off or else
denied their seniority rights and
forced back at
lower wages. The even less fortunate
women found themselves once again back
in the restaurants, laundries, or
small shops from which they'd escaped
or worse yet, onto unemployment com-
pensation or welfare.

The question remains—
Where are today's “Rosie the Riveters?

Today, Rosie the Riveter has been
replaced by Pam the Carpenter, Debbie
the Mechanic, Dikka the Cabinetmaker,
and Karen the Painter. More and more
women are moving into non-traditional
jobs and many for the same reasons
Rosie had—better pay, advancement

into “women's jobs"

meet with other women and talk
about everything from what to wear
to work to feelings towards our
male co-workers. Whatever the topic
we all enjoy the camaraderie and
fellowship. It's fun to meet other
women in non-traditional jobs.
