alleged distribution, by LOH, of
leaflets to children in the
schools. LOH, it seems, denies
this. It also seems that some
people present at the meeting
knew of instances of children
bringing such literature home
from school. Someone remarked
that it was going to be a dirty
fight. It has been up until now:
Schefellin’s success in ex-
cluding pro-ERA testimony dur-
ing his “investigation” is well
remembered.

As far as anyone knows, LOH
is not formally affiliated with any
of the other repressive-
conservative groups gaining
momentum in this area, but they
are far from being alone. The
membership, beliefs and aims of
LOH, Citizens Against
Neighborhood Schools, and
local Right-to-Life groups are all
similar or the same. Ms. Menard
mentioned the recent success of
these groups in getting certain
books banned in the Aurora
schools, including a pair of
modern classics on growing up
(but hardly on a conservative
model), The Bell Jar and The
Catcher in the Rye. She added,
by way of a somewhat gloomy
joke, that so far these groups
were only going in for banning
books, not burning them — yet.
She may be right: unstopped,
these groups could let the coun-
try in for another era of Mc-
Carthyism, a period of political,
social and cultural repression
remembered all too well by older
members. Anti-ERA women
have gone much further than
feminists in emphasizing this
aspect of the ERA fight, as a
major battleground in this
chronic socio-political split,
perhaps because they have the
wholehearted support of like-
minded men, whereas feminists
do not.

Logic Not Enough

Conference

The development of systems
to communicate these needs,
and of business alliances
between presses to support and
protect each other, are issues
needing further discussion. A
women's press and com-
munications conference is
tentatively being planned for
the end of this summer. For
more information, women in-
volved in the communications
organizations should write to
June Arnold at Daughters, Inc.

Menard on the effectiveness of
the NOW ERA campaign were
the results of a study by a DU
graduate student on the
effectiveness of materials
presented to the public by NOW
and LOH. The study was based
on the premise that three fac-
tors, logic, rhetoric and psy-
chology, determined the effec-
tiveness of such material. The
conclusion of the study was that
NOW material excelled in logic,
whereas the LOH material ex-
celled in rhetoric and psy-
chology. The conclusion Ms.
Menard drew was that NOW
must also work on levels other
than appeals to reason.
Women’s equality is a violently
emotional subject. There are no
rational reasons for the subjec-
tion of women; the “reasons,”
so effective in anti-ERA
propaganda are all extra-
rational. There are also extra-
rational reasons for women to
reject it, as demonstrated by the
speed with which a number of
those present came up with
“some of them for future use.

Another point made by Ms.
Menard was that the ERA is a
legal test only. It will not change
social custom. Once it is incor-
porated in the Constitution, it
will not, in the example she
gave, “clean up Social Securi-
ty,” but it will subject to review
those regulations that are dis-
criminatory against house-
wives. NOW, she said, needs to
reassure the people that their
lives will not be overturned; the
ERA does not apply to social
custom. In view of the fact that
unquestioned subjection of
women is the emotional basis
for the narrow but seemingly
secure system that anti-ERAites
are trying to re-build, one may
hope that such reassurances
will not be another logical futili-
ty.

Dr. Stephen Hersh, an assis-
tant director for children and
youth programs at NIMH has
commented that “as soon as I
heard of the legislation I started
seeing Hutschnecker — night-
mares.”

Arnold Hutschnecker, Richard
Nixon's personal physician,
created a controversy in 1970
when he proposed nation-wide
mental testing of six to eight year
olds, with detention camps for
children judged to have
“criminal potential.”

overcome sexism. If, however, men do not allow women this
separation, our only alternative is to develop such tools as viruses
which afflict only the male species and cause them to fall off the face of
the earth.

By this time it should be apparent that this type of separatism only
leads to the same fascist politics men have practiced on women for
years.

Conclusion

From city to city each community has developed its own specific set of
problems. We believe the problems discussed in this article to be the
most common and have yet to see any feminist separatist community
immune from them.

Individual women working from a separatist perspective have been
reluctant to acknowledge aloud that problems do exist. However, now
that feminists are beginning to learn the importance of mutual and self
criticism, hopefully we are discovering that the process does not
threaten our strength, and is necessary, if not imperative, for an
effective movement.

Ed. note: the two women who wrote this article are lesbian feminists
who have been active in the separatist community for several years.

Because of vastly increased postage rates, we have

been forced to raise the cost of some copies and sub-
scriptions. Big Mama will now cost 55¢ out of state,
and subscription rates have changed as follows: Can-
adian subscriptions now cost $8; overseas, $10; and
institutions, $12.
Copies sold in Colorado and individual U.S. sub-
scriptions remain the same as before.

As a sample of the rhetoric
and psychology used
successfully by LOH and similar
groups, a portion of a tape made
during the hearings of the
Scheffelin committee was
played. The speaker was one
Lottie Beth Hobbs, whose soft
Texas voice promised nameless
disaster if “good Christian peo-
ple” did not take action against
“Women's Liberation,” which
she characterized as “the work
of Satan” among other
diabolical things; a very effective
translation of conservative fears
in times of rapid change and
economic instability. The
listeners were warned by
women who had been at the
hearings that Lottie Beth had a
professional presentation and a
fashion magazine appearance,
as well as her expertise as an
author, publisher and business-
woman, despite the line she
was taking.

Ms. Menard wrapped up the
meeting by enumerating some
of the mistakes NOW had made
in the faded ERA campaign in
New York. The first mistake
was the NOW assumption that
the ERA would pass; again, they
had assumed that no one would
listen to the often wildly illogical
anti-ERA propaganda. When
NOW did go to the people, they
sent lawyers and professionals,
not the many housewives who
support the ERA. Colorado’s
own Housewives for the ERA
organization will be of
assistance in the fight here.
NOW also failed to make people
understand that the ERA does
not apply to social custom.

More people are needed to
help in the campaign for the
ERA. If you are interested in

ERA Not Insured

“can assure you that we have
a high batting average killing
bills we don't want and passing
ones we do,” warned William
Perkins of Continental Insur-
ance Corporation in the fall of
1975. His target: the Equal
Rights Amendment.

If passed by thirty-seven state
legislatures, the constitutional
amendment would, among other
things, outlaw the practice of
charging up to 50 percent more
for women's health insurance
premiums than for men’s.

A principal anti-ERA lobbying
group receiving insurance com-
pany money is Pro-America, a
conservative women’s organiza-
tion. Many of Pro-America’s
lobbyists are wives of execu-
tives of Mutual of Omaha and its
affiliates.

W. Clement Stone, chairman
of the Combined Insurance
Company of America, has been
one of the big contributors to
Pro-America’s anti-ERA cam-
paign.

groups and individuals are trying
to deal with. I see the women’s
movement as being in a crisis
right now — either it will con-
tinue intellectualizing, in the
path that Ms. magazine has
taken, or it will become more
honest and more in tune with
feelings. And if intellectualizing
is the main road taken, the
women’s movement will die out.
What about black feminists, and
black feminist groups?

V: Again, that’s an intellectual
thing, or most of the groups are.
The greatest feminist organiza-
tion I know of, that had some
black women in it, was the Wel-
fare Rights Organization. They
were out bustin’ down folks’
doors, saying, “Hey, we want
some food!” None of this
pseudo-intellectual bullshit. To
sum up, to be a feminist, as it is
now, would be for me to be a
racist.

K: A lot of feminists will read
that and be hurt by it. How would
you suggest they deal with it?
V: Hell, just deal with it! Look
here. You read a lot nowadays
about is the feminist movement
going to fail. Well, it will fail, as
you said, until white women stop
doing the same things white
men do! White men, honey, can
look you right in the eye and talk
bullshit all day long! Until they

from women. “We feel we save
lives here. The woman’s life is
the most important thing to us.”
She went on to state that these
people cannot understand digni-
ty for women or wanting women
to make their own choice con-
cerning their bodies. “They can't
talk on our level, and we won't
talk on theirs,” she said.
Women come to Boulder
Valley after much soul-
searching. They have already
made their decision when they,

get over their fear of emotions
and stop talking in abstracts, nobody’s going to be communicat-
ing.

Another thing is that white
people have got to stop feeling
threatened by black solidarity.
For example, when I’m at a party,
and there's some of my black
friends there, and I go talk to
them, I get looked at funny and
people start whispering about it,
whereas if I just talk to my white
friends, nobody thinks twice
about it. And you can see that
happening within the women’s
movement too. ... I think the
best thing white people can do
right now is just to be them-
selves. Don’t try to be hip. Don't
break your neck trying to fit in
with my culture. Don’t deny who
you are. If you're an ignorant
white person, then be an ignor-
ant white person. For me, I'm
gonna decide for my damn self.
I've got to the point of being tired
of being pulled from both sides.
I'm just not gonna even deal with
percentages any more — am I
spending more percent of my
time with whites or more
percent with blacks. I'm just gonna
be me.

I am black. I am a woman, and I
would no more expect you to ig-
nore that than for you to deny
your being white and a woman.

Pa. Legislators Seek to Repress Gays

Woodwoman

Since Governor Shapp vetoed
Senate Bill 196 (see Hot Briefs,
January issue), resulting in the
bill being sent back to com-
mittee, the attention of Penn-
sylvania lawmakers has turned
to an almost identical piece of
legislation, Senate Bill 743.

SB 743 seeks to prohibit “any
homosexual or individual con-
victed of a sex crime from serving
on the police force, as a state
correctional employee, or in a
position which would bring her
into contact with the mentally ill
or the mentally or physically
retarded.

No Refuge in the Closet

In the words of the bill,
“homosexual” means one who
is inclined to or who practices or
engages in sexual or erotic
activity with a member of one’s
own sex.’ This, as one legislator
puts it, “covers the covert type,
who's underground.”

The Pennsylvania House
Labor Relations Committee met
in mid-December to discuss the
new bill. Some quotes reported
from that meeting:

“I think it's best not havin’ ‘em
(homosexuals) nowhere. Let's
get rid of ‘em. They make you
feel uneasy.” (Rep. Ralph Gar-
zie, D-Delaware)

“By the nature of ‘the job,
they're in a position where they
can take advantage of people or
use psychological force.” (Rep.
Raymond Lederer, D-
Philadelphia)
Whose Vote?

Among those in favor of the
bill, interestingly enough, is
Senator Jeanette Reibman, a
member of the State Women’s
Commission. Senator Reibman
is reported to be wooing the
women’s vote in pursuit of Hugh
Scott’s senate seat, and has
sought endorsement from
various women’s groups, in-
cluding N.O.W.

The aim of those legislators
who endorse Bills 196 and 743
is to keep introducing similar
bills until the State Justice
Department no longer finds
them unconstitutional.
