E.C.T. Hearings Held By Berkeley City Council  

Jenny Miller  

On January 26, city council  
member Florence McDonald pre-  
sented a motion that the cou-  
ncil hold hearings on the  
subject of electro-convulsive  
treatment (ECT) at Herrick  
Hospital. The majority of co-  
uncil members, who belong to  
the All Berkeley Coalition,  
rejected her motion, citing  
such considerations as the  
council's lack of medical ex-  

women in cages  

pertise, and the city's inab-  
ility to change state regul-  
ations. The four members of  
the council who belong to  
Berkeley Citizens Action, in-  
cluding Mayor Newport, voted  
in favor of the proposal. A  
substitute motion, proposed  
by ABC member Andrea Wash-  
burn, that the subject be  
turned over to Assemblyman  
Tom Bates's mental health  
subcommittee, also failed to  
pass. (Several observers at  
the meeting wondered why Tom  
Bates has allied himself with  
the more conservative council  
members on this issue, which  
seems to belie his reputation  
as a "progressive" politi-  
cian.)  

In order to understand the  
complex issues involved in  
this controversy, one must  
take a look at the history of  
institutional psychiatry and  
the enormous power it has wi-  
elded. Most people are aware  
that millions of people--  
Jews, gypsies, gay people,  
political prisoners--were  
killed by the Nazis in con-  
centration camps. It is less  
well known that this extermi-  
nation was preceded by the  
killing of hundreds of thou-  
sands of mental patients in  
psychiatric hospitals. The  
techniques of mass extermina-  
tion were developed and inst-  
ituted by the leading psych-  
iatrists in Germany, and it  
was they who supervised the  
later killings in concentra-  
tion camps. Frederic Wertham  
has documented the killing of  
mental patients in his book,  
A Sign for Cain. Children as  
well as adults were gassed,  
poisoned, and starved to dea-  
th, under the supervision of  
doctors. The Czech War Crimes  
Commission and the Nuremberg  
Trials agree with Wertham's  
estimate that 270,000 pati-  
ents were murdered in the  
state hospitals. Wertham no-

tes the now well-established  
fact: "The psychiatrists...  
acted on their own. They were  
not carrying out a death sen-  
tence pronounced by somebody  
else. They were the legisla-  
tors who laid down the rules  
for deciding who was to  
die..." On the occasion of  
the killing of the ten thou-  
sandth mental patient at the  
Hademar psychiatric institu-  
tion, a big celebration was  
held, with free drinks for  
the doctors, nurses and at-  
tendants.  

Only in 1941, two years af-  
ter the slaughter of mental  
patients began, did Hitler  
remove the killing centers  
from the complete control of  
psychiatrists. The centers  

were then used to train the  
SS in techniques of slaughter  
for concentration camp in-  
mates. Five psychiatrists  
were the first to enter Da-  
chau for the purpose of sel-  
ecting inmates for political  
extermination. A typical  
"diagnosis" was: "inimical  
attitude toward Germany." A  
typical “symptom” was  
membership in the Communist  
party. The psychiatrists responsi-  
ble, such as Werner Heyde,  
were in many cases permitted  
to continue practicing in  
their field in Germany after  
the war.  

Support for the idea of the  
elimination of "useless eat-  

ers" was not limited to Germ-  
any. In 1935, Dr. Alexis Car-  
rell, a French-American Nobel  

Prize winner who had been on  
the staff of the Rockefeller  
Institute since its incept-  
ion, published his book, Man  
the Unknown. Carrell recom-  
mends that the so-called crim-  
inal and mentally ill should  
be “humanly and economically  
disposed of in small euthan-  
asia institutions supplied  
with proper gases." (In that  
same year in Spain, a man na-  
med Egaz Moniz invented lobo-  
tomy, which is the surgical  
destruction of healthy brain  
tissue, for which he, too,  
won a Nobel Prize. And three

Forty years after the Amer-

endorsement of the mass mur-  
der of children, the issue  
remains--whether or not peo-  
ple labelled as "mental pa-  
tients" have the right to  
control their minds and bod-  
ies, or whether all such de-  
cisions are best left to the  
psychiatric "experts." In  
Berkeley there is a coalition  
of organizations--the Network  
Against Psychiatric Assault,  
the Free Clinic, the Center  
for Independent Living, Ber-  
keley Citizens Action's men-  
tal health group--as well as  
numerous individuals, who ha-

city council investigate the  
practice of brain mutilations

years later Ugo Cerletti in  
Italy came up with the idea  
of using electrical convulsi-  
ons to shock people consider-  
ed to be strange back into  
"normality.") In 1942 the jo-  
urnal of the American Psychi-  
atric Association printed an  
article calling for the mass  
killing of children labelled  
retarded, with an editorial  
endorsement by the American  
Psychiatric Association. (See

(ECT) at Herrick Hospital.  
Florence McDonald began the  
discussion at the Jan. 26th  
council meeting by pointing  
out that the city council has  
often passed resolutions op-  
posing and supporting legis-  
lation. If, as a result of  
hearings on ECT, the council  
decides that changes are nec-  
essary in the law, they can  
communicate those changes to  
the legislature. Also, the  
council will be notifying  
Herrick Hospital that they're  
being watched. Council member

A Past & Present History of Psychiatric Atrocities  

Burn responded by saying  

that as a former social work-  
er she was concerned about  
this issue. However, as a re-  
sult of her discussions with  

as~  
in investigating  
subject to approval.  
felt that action by the  
city council would set a pre-  
cedent for other community  
governments to regulate "pri-  
vate medical decisions" such  
as those relating to abort-  
ion and contraceptive advice.  
One wonders if Washburn would  
also abhor government "inter-  
ference" in mass steriliza-  
tion programs of the kind so  
common in Nazi Germany and  

in this country until recent-  
ly. (Records kept by the  
Dept. of Mental Hygiene in-  
dicate that approximately  
20,000 inmates in California  
were sterilized, accounting  
for one-third of all steril-  
izations nationwide, between  
the years 1909 and 1960, when  
they claim the practice was  
stopped.) Although Washburn  
was opposed to the Berkeley  
government interfering in th-  
is "medical issue," she se-  
emed to have no such reserva-  
tions about interference by  
the state government, whom  
she felt should investigate  
such areas as informed con-  
sent and involuntary/volunt-  
ary consent, and whether pat-  
ients are "properly evaluat-  
ed."  

The next speaker was coun-  
cil member Sweeney. He felt  
the current laws regarding  
ECT are adequate and well-  
written, but that there might  
be a problem with enforce-  
ment. He said that the Wel-  
fare and Institutions code  
provided that "there has to  
be a waiting period that is a  
review procedure, requiring  
2 additional doctors besides  
the treating doctor. If in-  
formed consent is the issue,  
a patient attorney or public  
defender has to be appointed  
to determine capacity before  
consent is given." Sweeney  
neglected to mention that in  
some instances shock may be  
administered without the pat-  
ient's consent. Either the  
patient's attorney or the at-  
tending shock doctor may file  
a petition of incompetency in  
Superior Court. It is up to  
the court, not the attorney,  

to decide if  

the capacity  

decides  

does not have  

ive may  

ach more likely that the co-  
urt will pay attention to the  
psychiatrist's professional  
evaluation than to the pa-  
tient's claim of competency.  
And since it is often a par-  
ent or spouse who has the pa-  
tient committed in the first  
place, due to conflict within  
the family, it cannot be as-  
sumed that the relative al-  
ways has the patient's best  
interest at heart. Represent-  
atives from the Network Aga-  
inst Psychiatric Assault (NAPA)  
do not feel that the law  
is adequate either in regard  
to patients who give "volun-  
tary" consent. They say the  
coercive environment of a lo-  
cked ward and the lack of co-  
mplete information given by  
hospital authorities (as to  
the risk of pain during tre-  
atment, possibility of death  
or permanent brain damage)  
makes "informed consent" a  
joke. At one point council  
member Sweeney slipped and  
said "conformed consent" but  
quickly corrected himself.  
Council member Denton spoke  
next in favor of council hear-  
ings as opposed to assembly  
hearings. He said the latter  
were "a kind of a shuck." Leo  
Bach brought some unintent-  
ional comic relief to the  
proceedings by saying that co-  
uncil members were not  
"competent to deal with such  
matters." Amidst the laughter  
greeting this remark, one  
member of the audience was  
heard to say, "Maybe he needs  
a psychiatric evaluation!"  
Bach said groups like the Na-  
tional Institute of Mental  
Health, the American Medical  
Association and the American  
Psychiatric Association were  
the groups that were compe-  
tent to make recommendations.  
Bach seemed to be suffering  
from the delusion that all  
patients in California have  
the right to refuse shock tre-  
atment, and expressed concern  
for the patients who might  
want ECT. He expressed oppo-  
sition to either local or  
state hearing. At that point  
McDonald exclaimed with great  
passion, (among other things),

there are the books  
that guarantee that there

have a public hearing on dis-  
crimination! How do you find  
out about enforcing the law  
if you don't hear from the  
people who've been in the  
hospital? And that's what I'm  
asking for!" There was loud  
applause from the audience.

Since the city council maj-  
ority is going to such great  
lengths to suppress the words  
of former shock victims, per-  
haps this is a good place to  
let them be heard. This is  
how Jane Gotkin, in her book  
Too Much Anger, Too Many  
Tears describes the treatment  
which Herrick claims is pain-  
less:  

‘There's nothing to be sc-  
ared of,' a man says...'I'm  
Dr. Raymond. Try to relax.  
We're going to give you a  
shot. Count backward from 10.  
You won't feel anything'...A  
pinch in my arm. Ten, nine,  
eight. I am feeling warm, a  
sweet warmness suffuses my  
body. I am floating. Seven,  

six, five. I fight against it.  

I want to know what they are  
doing to me. I don't want to  
sleep. But it is sweet, this  
floating on a bubble; four,  
three...Darkness. I awoke on  
a pillowless bed in a room  

that smelled of old urine.  
Where was I? In an attempt to  

2 more of  

the pain  

bomb-  

ea that was my brain.  

my head down on the  
As the pain subsided for an  
instant, I began to feel my  
body. It must have been numb  
before. Now as I felt it, I  

knew one vast continuous ache  
from toe to thigh to chest  
and elbow. Had I been put  
through a grinder? Over the  
wheel? My bones and muscles,  
every cell and fiber, con-  
nective tissue and neuron was  
a point in the continuous  
network of pain that was my  
body. Yet it was almost a  
dull sensation, this body-  
hurt, compared to the elect-  
ric agony of throbbing pain  
that was my head...Toast and  
coffee. I ate, numbly, un-  
aware of anything but pain  
and the fear that was concen-  
trating, focusing, into a  
black funnel of terror in my  
mind...What was being well  
anyhow? Well was being on an  
unchanging plane of placidity.  
Well was never saying the  
world sucked. Well was saying  
this hellhole was a hospital  
and thank you for giving me  
shock treatment. Well was  
crazy...  

NAPA and other groups in  
Berkeley will be continuing  
their fight against shock  
treatment. A nationally-known  
attorney in the field of pa-  
tients’ rights, David Ferle-  
ger, has agreed to assist the  
coalition in researching the  
legality of stopping shock  
on a local level.
