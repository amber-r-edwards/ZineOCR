The First Victim?

Last year's radiation accident at  
Three Mile Island may have claimed its  
first victim. Suit has been filed a-  
gainst the nuclear power plant's own-  
ers, operators and manufacturers for  
the stillbirth of Perri Kick's daught-  
er last August. The mother lived just  
over three miles from the plant and  
was four months pregnant when the rad-  
iation leak occurred. Doctors did an  
extensive autopsy to try to determine  
the cause of death. “Everything within  
the child was normal, but it all just  
stopped at once," the mother said. The  
suit charges the company with deliber-  
ately concealing information about the  
extent and seriousness of the accident.

Triple-Whammied

The British House of Lords has rec-  
ognized Islamic divorce. In a recent  
ruling, the House declared that the  
so-called Talaq divorce, in which the  
husband merely has to declare, “I div-  
orce thee, I divorce thee, I divorce  
thee," is valid, as long as the hus-  
band flies to Pakistan to do it. Crit-  
ics of the ruling say the decision may  
result in hard times for women among  
Britain's many Muslim immigrants. Un-  
der English law, a woman can't seek  
financial support from her former hus-  
band unless the divorce case has first  
been heard before a British court.

Bombs or Babies

Women in the West German region of  
Lower Saxony are staging a "birth  
strike" to protest nuclear armament  
and nuclear power plants. 1000 women  
have taken a written pledge not to bear  
children "as long as the ruling powers  
are not ready to give up nuclear weap-  
ons and plants." The pledge reads in  
part: “No future without children, no  
children without a future," and calls  
for an end to "the (nuclear) insanity."

Agent Exposed

A key witness against Astrid Proll  
has turned out to be secretly on the  
payroll of the West German Criminal  
Bureau. Proll, who has received  
wide support from German feminists,  
is currently being tried on two counts  
of attempted murder and one of at-  
tempted robbery in connection with  
her alleged membership in West Ger-  
many's Baader Meinhof revolutionary  
group. Karl Heinz Ruhland, who has  
been called as a prosecution witness  
about 100 times in the course of  
West German trials of revolutionaries,  
was shown in court to have received  
regular payments from the German  
Criminal Bureau. After Proll's law-  
yers produced the documents, Ruhland  
told the court he didn't want to tes-  
tify again against Proll, because  
it was possible he might “again say  
something false.”

No Danger Here?

Iranian lesbians and gay men who  
face deportation under orders from  
President Carter may be able to use  
their sexuality as a defense to re-  
main in the United States. "They have  
been executing gays right and left in  
Iran," says Susan McGrievy, attorney  
for the American Civil Liberties  
Union. Because of these executions,  
openly gay Iranians may assert that  
they would be in danger by returning  
to Iran.

Sexism, Scottish Style  
Christine Main of Ayr, Scotland was  
awarded only $1.00 maintenance for her  

daughter born out of wedlock in 1977  

because she had not used the Pill. In  
the contested action, Ayr Sheriff  
Court ruled that Christine had been  
negligent in becoming pregnant. "In  
my opinion," Sheriff Neil Gow said,  
“in this day and age, when a young  
girl knows about contraception and  
has a supply of contraceptive pills  
available for her use and regularly  
embarks on a course of sexual rela-  
tions with her boyfriend, she must be  
taken in law to have voluntarily as-  
sumed the risk of falling pregnant.”

Unlawful Intercourse

In a California case involving a  
17 year old male and a 16 year old  
female who engaged in sexual inter-  
course, the state Supreme Court re-  
cently ruled that the "unlawful inter-  
course" law, formerly the statutory  
rape law, is legitimate even though  
it protects only females and prose-  
cutes only males. After rejecting  
the argument that the female must  
be held equally responsible, the  
court said, "The minor female who  
engages, however willingly, in sexual  
relations is subjected to risks and  
adverse consequences far greater  
than those which may befall her male  
counterpart."

Give Us Shelter

The New Jersey Department of Human  
Services has placed homosexual teen-  
agers with behavioral problems in  
foster homes headed by lesbians, ac-  
cording to a report in the New York  
Times. Ann Burns, an officer of the  
agency, said such placements were  
made only for children who identify  
as gay and are considered such by  
social workers, and whose parents are  
unwilling to care for them-- and then  
only after careful review.

Nursing Forward

Members of the Gay Nurses' Alliance  
of New York were reported in “visible  
attendance at the recent New York State  
Nurses Association convention. Together  
with the New York Black Nurses' Associ-  
ation and the Philippine Nurses' Assoc-  
iation, they submitted a proposal re-  
questing the establishment of a Human  
Rights Task Force, to be charged with  
the responsibility of analyzing issues  
related to culture, ethnicity, and al-  
ternate lifestyles of nurses and con-  
sumers of health care in order to  
effect high quality health care.

They also called for the nondiscrim-  
ination clause in their contract to  
be expanded to include sexual orientation.  
Both proposals passed without opposing  
debate.

Dump the Whole Book

Delegates to the Mennonite General  
Assembly in Ontario recently discovered  
that a page had been ripped out of  
their songbooks. In its place they  
found a gummed label informing them  
that "Hymn 91 had been removed from  
this book because of the publisher's  
oversight in including a stanza poten-  
tially offensive to users." Hymn 91  
began, "Praising God is the privilege  
of all: Black and white, straight and  
gay, young and old..."

Is There Pee After Sex?

Do you pee after sex? If you do you  
are eight times less likely to get cys-  
titis, a urinary infection, than some-  
one who cuddles up under the covers  
putting off the moment of relief. Cys-  
titis sufferers are often advised to  
pee after sex and many have been  
miraculously cured of persistent urin-  
ary infections as a result.

Holding Our Breath

"Class Struggle" is an ingenious  
board game with a political message,  
however, Eaton's, a large department  
store in Toronto, has another word  
for it-- subversive. And so, just be-  
fore Christmas, Eaton's banned “Class  
Struggle" (which had been selling  
briskly) from its shelves. The develop-  
er of the game, Professor Goldman, was  
quick to capitalize (if you'll pardon  
the expression) on Eaton's folly, and  
issued the following statement: "Class  
Struggle, Inc., takes full responsib-  
ility for the fall of the Conservative  
government in Canada. Subversive games  
tend to do things like that, if you  
don't watch out. And if you think  
bringing down the government was a  
difficult trick, wait till you see what  
we can do once the game has been around  
a little longer.”

Make It Safe

The Occupational Safety and Health  
Administration has proposed a $10,000  
fine against American Cyanamid for a  
policy requiring that women employees  
be sterilized so that they could con-  
tinue working in certain areas of the  
firm's Willow Island, WV, chemical  
plant. In issuing the citation, OSHA  
said it was their view that the haz-  
ard, not the employee, should be re-  
moved.

Welders Win

Three women shipyard welders recent-  
ly won more than $7000 in disability  
pay for time lost at work due to preg-  
nancy. The women won their case against  
General Dynamics Shipyard in Quincy,  
Mass., one of the largest naval yards

with federal and state laws requiring  
that pregnancy be compensated like any  
other disability. The three women be-  
lieve they are among the first female  
hardhat workers in the country to win  
full coverage for pregnancy.

Viva Sanchez!

Celia Sanchez, a heroine of the  
Cuban revolution, died in Cuba January  
11th at the age of 52. Celia, as she  
was widely known, had helped to organ-  
ize the underground against the Batista  
government, fought with Fidel in the  
Sierra Maestra and after the military  
victory participated as a leader in  
the difficult tasks of creating a new  
life for the Cuban people. She was  
buried in the olive green uniform of  
the Cuban army in Havana after a day  
of national mourning.

Property Rights

for “passion killing," which lays down a  
sentence of three to seven years in  
jail for the death of his marriage  
partner, daughter or sister “whoever  
causes in the moment in which he discovers an  
illegitimate carnal relationship," is  
currently under attack. Socialist and  
Communist Senators claim the law is a  
leftover from the conception that looked  
upon women as “objects owned by  
men," -and pointed out that "the courts  
are now bound to put a murderer on the  
same level as a man who steals a chick-  
en."

What a Difference  
A Dyke Makes

Terri Levy recently completed a  
study at the California School of  
Professional Psychology in which she  
had 106 practicing clinical psychology  
interns view a 20-minute videotape  
of a therapy session. The interns were  
told the woman client had sought ther-  
apy because she had just ended a rela-  
tionship. Instructions to the interns  
were identical, except one group was  
told that the woman had just broken up  
with a man while the other half was  
told that she just broke up with a  
woman and identifies herself as a les-  
bian. Interns who thought the client  
was heterosexual "found her way above  
normal" in all characteristics. Levy  
says the interns were impressed by the  
way the client (as a heterosexual)  
handled the stress of breaking up.

Interns who were told the client was  
a lesbian, however, gave her an over-  
whelmingly negative rating and saw her  
as having a significantly low personal  
adjustment, negative personality  
characteristics and poor self-control.
