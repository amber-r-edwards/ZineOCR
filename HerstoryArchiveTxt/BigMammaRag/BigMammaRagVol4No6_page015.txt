with you.
Another real interesting inci-
dent about this case—Veron-

-ica was approached by the FBI

on a Monday. Two agents
came to her home and asked to
talk to her. She exercised her
right, which everybody has,
not to talk to the FBI. She
said, “No, I don't want to talk
to you. Please, go away.” So,
they went away, and the next
day they reappeared with this
subpoena—the next day! So it
appeared to us that it was an
attempt by the FBI to circum-
vent the fact that they do not
have subpoena power. They,
themselves, cannot force
somebody to talk to them—but
they get the US Attorney to
bring somebody in, in front of
the grand jury, and talk there,
and that circumvents the fact
that Congress did not give
them subpoena power. The
grand jury is not supposed to
be used as a tool of the FBI.
It’s not supposed to be used to
just do the FBI’s work. The
grand jury has a very specific
purpose in our legal system—
it’s supposed to be the group
that decides whether there’s
probable cause to believe that
somebody did or did not
commit a particular crime. It’s
supposed to be the deciding
body that prevents the gov-
ernment from initiating pros-
ecutions when they don’t have
enough evidence to make it
fair for a person to have to go
through the whole effort of a
trial, which is a very expen-
sive, long effort and exposes
people to the fact that they've
been accused of being crim-
inals, even if they win, and so
forth. So, it was initially a
protective body, that was
supposed to protect the citi-
zens from the government.
Instead, it has turned into
exactly the opposite. It has
turned into a very abusive
kind of thing.

The last of our major issues
in the initial situation with the
court—no, it wasn’t the last,
there were a couple of
others—one of them was that
this young lady was a Chicana,
a woman, and young. And all
those groups are under-rep-
resented in the jury pool in the
federal courts. The reason for
that is because they're basic-
ally drawn from the voter
registration lists, and voter
registration lists tend to not
include a fair cross-section of

Police Screening

Lesbian Comedy Film Banned As “Porn”

Police officials prevented a
showing of Jan Oxenberg’s
lesbian satire, “A Comedy in
Six Unnatural Acts,” at a
women’s bar in Provincetown,
Massachusetts, April 24.

“Concerned citizens com-
plained that the film might be
obscene,” police chief James
Meads told an owner of the
bar, warning her that should
the film be shown, the police
and someone from the state
attorney general's office and
alcoholic beverage commis-
sion would come to the bar
and “find something wrong.” The movie was one of three
of Oxenberg’s films scheduled
to be shown at the bar. An
advertisement in a local Prov-
incetown paper which appar-
ently prompted the police
visit, described the movie as
“A loving satire of various
stereotypes of lesbians, includ-
ing such old favorites as the
wallflower, child molester,
and seductress. Each scene is
also a takeoff on a different
style of Hollywood film, from
which we get so many of our
stereotypes.” The film has
been widely shown to
women’s movement audiences
and has also received notice
outside of the movement.
Oxenberg submitted the film
to the American Film Institute
and received a grant on the

Strength of it.

the community, as far as
minorities go. We had
challenged the fact that the
jury was drawn from some-
thing other than a fair cross-
section of the community,
which would include a fair
proportion of Chicanos, wom-
en, and young persons.

The other issue was that the
court should instruct the
grand jury on their rights and
responsibilities and those of
the witness. Basically, as I
say, the grand jury was
initiated as this body to
protect the citizen, and at this
point most people who would
be called to be on a grand jury
would have no idea of that.

They'd have no idea that
they’re supposed to be the
ones to decide whether they
want to call the witness or
release the witness. That
they're the ones who decide
whether they’re going to
pursue something or drop it.
That they're the ones who are
going to decide to return the
indictment or not to return the
indictment. That they're the
ones who are going to decide
what questions to ask, etc.
They can ask their own
questions—anything that they
want. But they usually don’t
know that, and we had asked
the court to instruct them of

Office Workers Protest

Women office workers
around the country marked
“National Secretaries
Week,” a time in which bosses
traditionally give roses to their
secretaries, with protests and
rallies in late April.

“Respect, Rights, and
Raises—not Roses” was the
theme of two noon rallies for
women office workers held
April 21 and 22 in Manhattan.
The street rallies were organ-
ized by Women Office
Workers (WOW), a New York
group which renamed the
week “Women Office
Workers’ Week” to focus
attention on the common
problems of all women clerical
workers, such as low wages,
lack of promotional opportun-
ities and discriminatory treat-
ment. The rallies demanded
“real improvement in our
working lives all year round”
instead of the token recog-
nition of roses, from the boss.

WOW’s first rally was held in
mid-town Manhattan in front
of the Time-Life Building; the
second outside the New York
Stock Exchange on Wall
Street. Posters at the rallies

described statistically the gap
in earnings between minority
women and white women, as
well as between women and
men in office work.

Obscene irony

Filmmaker Oxenberg called
it “ironic and insulting that
this film, which is a
women-loving film, could be
put in the same
category—obscene or porno-
graphic—as films that rou-
tinely degrade women.”

“I was particularly disap-
pointed about this cancel-
lation,” she said, “because
I’ve been wanting to show my
film in bars so I can reach
women who don’t necessarily
relate to the women’s move-
ment and women who have
felt excluded because they’re
working class, third world,
so-called ‘old gay’ and so on.
It seems to me that
may be particu-
larly relevant for women in the
bar culture because I think
they’ve been even more dir-
ectly affected by the stereo-
typing of lesbians than women
who have come out through
the women's movement.”

After being informed of the
film’s cancellation, Oxenberg
called the Provincetown police
department, described the
film, and offered to show it to
them. They responded that
even if the film weren’t
obscene, “the title made it
sound like it would be,” and
stated for the first time that
the bar lacked a license
required to show films. When
she asked who a license could

parable positions.
National Actions

Public actions around the
“Roses are not enough,”
theme were held in at least
five other major cities across
the nation during “Women
Office Workers’ Week.” The
group “9 to 5” in Boston
held a noon rally around a
giant typewriter. Women
Organized for Employment
(WOE) in San Francisco ral-
lied downtown and marched to
the offices of Federated Em-
ployers, an association of 418
employers whom WOE ac-
cuses of wage-setting prac-
tices. Cleveland Working
Women held downtown activ-
ities including mass leaflet-
ing. In Chicago, Women
Employed (WE) celebrated
“200 years of working
women,” held a “Petty
Office Procedure” contest,
and distributed helium bal-
loons to women at a noon
rally. And in Ohio, Dayton
Women Working distributed
balloons demanding “More
Rank, Less File.”

be obtained for a showing of
the films scheduled for May
15, Oxenberg was told that
Board of Selectmen, in charge
of issuing such a license,
wouldn’t be meeting before

then.
Films Cleared

On May 15 Oxenberg
brought her films to Province-
town where she had to screen
them for the police before
being allowed to show the
films at midnight in a local
movie theater. The police
found no grounds for banning
the films.

Present at the police scree-
ning was a Provincetown
businessman who local women
thought was probably respon-
sible for the original trouble.
“He seemed very disappoint-
ed that there was no ‘sex’ in
the films,” Oxenberg stated,
“though if there was you can
be sure I wouldn’t have let
him see it. After he got over
his initial disappointment he
ranted and raved for a while
about how some former police
chief wouldn’t have let these
disgusting films be shown in
Provincetown, etc.” Prov-
incetown women planned to
boycott the man’s businesses.
Oxenberg is hoping to resche-
dule a film showing at the
women's bar where they were
originally scheduled and is
looking into legal action on the
grounds of “prior restraint.”

Not Only Down, But Off—Marin Scott Milam, editor of Playgirl
magazine, recently appeared on a talk show with Gloria
Steinem. Asked what she thought of Playgirl, Steinem is
reported to have said, “All in all it's good to see the ruling class
with their pants down for a change.” (Elizabeth Rhodes in the
Charlotte Observer)

Beat Me, Beat Me, I Love It—To Jeanne Moreau, being a
“liberated woman” (as if there were such a thing) simply
means “having the freedom to choose the man to whom I will
become a slave.” (Jeanne Moreau, talking from somewhere
other than her mouth, People magazine, Mar 22)

Trauma at the Airport or “It Must Be Hard...” — Carol and
Linda were saying goodbye at the airport, publicly expressing
their affection for each other—you know, kissing and
smooching and all that good stuff. An older woman, who had
been watching the proceedings with interest, approached Carol
as she was waving her last goodbyes to Linda. (Her tears were
streaming down her face and her chocolate bunny had long
since melted in her hands.) “This is a hard time for you, isn’t
it?” consoled the older woman observer. Carol nodded, still
blubbering. “Yes,” the woman continued, “it must be really
hard to leave your mother.” (!*?**!)

Will the Real Fossil Please Stand Up?—Tennessee state
senator, Fred Berry, introduced a bill proposing that Tennessee
name an official fossil, an official rock, and an official gem.
Sixty-three-year-old Berry withdrew the bill when his
colleagues voted to make him the official state fossil. (Free For
All, Mar 23-Apr 8) I'm sure this is somehow ageist, but you
gotta admit it's funny!

Most-Offensive-Bad-Taste-Hilarious Publication of the Year
“Award—Goes to Albatross the purported radical-lesbian-fem-
inist satire magazine. The Albatross, say the editors in a reprint
from the Standard American Encyclopedia of 1937, is a “genus
of birds...with a very long bill which is sutured, robust, thick,
straight...and terminates in a large hook which is apparently
articulated herewith.” The editors themselves stress that “the
voice of an albatross is a harsh disagreeable cry, which has been
compared to the braying of an ass.” Here’s a sample of what
the critics have been saying about the mag: “not funny or
witty...” (Lesbian Voices); “often weird...” (Lesbian Tide);
“frequently offensive...” (Chicago Women’s Graphics Col-
lective); “funniest thing I’ve read since Mathematics
Made Difficult...,” (Witch and Chameleon).

Albatross is all of these and less, but if your sense of humor is
as low-level as mine and you're not “tight-ass,” Albatross may
be just the mag you've been looking for and will be sorry you
found. It should be read only in your own company, behind
closed doors so that none of your right-on radical feminist
friends will hear you laughing and disown you. Their cartoons
include the Betty Frypan Funnies, the Adventures of Phyllis
Shitfly, and the Roommates. The latter is my favorite. (Picture
of two very chic young women complete with long hair and
dangly earrings): Says the first, “I wish you'd stop using that
vaginal deodorant spray!” “Why?” asks the second. “Because
if I wanted to eat a gardenia I'd go out to the garden!” So-o-o,
for those of you who pride yourselves on having absolutely no
respectable sensibilities, you might want to bray with Albatross
at the “exorbitantly high price” of $7 a year (Box 112, 111 S.
Harrison, East Orange, New Jersey, 07017).

P.S.:—Some of you may or may not have noticed that I’ve
been out to lunch for the past four months. Nevertheless, the
column is continuing and will probably be called “Scraps from
Mama’s Table.” My graphics designer friend, however, has
also been out to lunch (no comments or innuendoes please) and
so, there is no logo to accompany the new title (hint, hint).
Special thanks to the title's originator, Susan H., who will be
sent a free sub or a free hug or a combination of the two.
