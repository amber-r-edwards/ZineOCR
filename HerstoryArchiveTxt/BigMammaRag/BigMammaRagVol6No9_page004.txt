On Their  
Way Up  

A team of American women has  
arrived in Nepal on the first leg of  
a journey they hope will end at the  
top of Annapurna, the world’s 10th  
tallest mountain.  

If they succeed, they will be the  
first all-woman American team to  
conquer a mountain more than  
28,000 feet high.  

While Japanese, Chinese and  
American women have yet to reach that mark.  

--Her Say  

Whatever  

The American Bar Association  
House of Delegates, which repre-  
sents more than half of the nation’s  
450,000 lawyers, went on record  
as being against an extension of the  
deadline for ratification of the  
Equal Rights Amendment. Only  
seven of the 375 delegates are  
women.  

When A.B.A. President-Elect  
S. Shepard Tate was asked by re-  
porters why there were so few  
women among the A.B.A. dele-  
gates, Tate responded, “More and  
more ladies are going to law  
schools. About a third of all stu-  
dents in law schools are ladies,  
women, girls or whatever...so I  
think there will soon be more wom-  
en in the House (of Delegates).”  

A motion put forth by the Nat-  
ional Association of Women Law-  
yers also was voted down by the  
mostly male delegation. The  
A.B.A. claimed that the motion,  
which called on the legal group to  
refuse to convene its meetings in  
states that had not adopted the  
ERA, would probably constitute a  
violation of U.S. anti-trust laws.

This booklet is intended for anyone in the market  
for a good sound system, no matter what the cost or  
where you intend to buy it.  

Read it carefully. We'd like you to benefit from  
our years in the business as audio professionals.  

Naturally, we’d like you to buy from us. But even  
if you don’t, we think this booklet will help you get a  
better sounding music system for whatever price  
you want to pay.  

So come in and see us, even if it’s just to talk. We  
like to talk but we'll happily mail the booklet to you if  
you prefer.  

We don’t think the fact that you aren’t a profes-  
sional musician should keep you from getting the  
best system your money can buy.
