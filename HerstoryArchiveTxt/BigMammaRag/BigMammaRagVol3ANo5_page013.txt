The Awful  
Rowing Toward God  
Anne Sexton  

Carol Hille  

The Awful Rowing Toward  
God, Anne Sexton's last book,  
suggests internally that she  
intended it to be her final state-  
ment, and that she expected,  
and looked forward to death.  
God has taken over the core of  
this work: only God could save  
Sexton, and he could only be  
reached through death. Once in  
an early work, All My Pretty  
Ones, she said of him, “Now he  
is large, covering up the sky/like  
a great resting jellyfish.” In The  
Awful Rowing Toward God, he  
really has covered up her sky.  

This last book is significantly  
different from Sexton’s earlier  
work. The autobiographical  
material that was her province  
and her field of creation has all  
but disappeared. Her material is  
still her internal life, but with  
much less reference to external  
factors, past or present.  

There are changes, too, in the  
technical aspects of the poems.  
Sexton was one of the few poets  
who could work in the traditional  
forms, particularly with end-  
rhyme, without being in any way  
trite. She used rhymes that  
would have turned a purist to  
stone, with - wildly - original  
results. That too, has dis-  
appeared from this last work.  
Her imagery, on the whole,  
seems somewhat less dense,  
bizarre and evocative than in the  
earlier works, although she is  
still quite capable of saying of  
the angels, “They push the  
moon around like /a boiled  
yam.” One has the feeling that  
she may have hurried past the  

Loving Women:  
Nomadic Sisters,  
$3.50; paperback  

R. Snake  

Loving Women is, very clearly  
and simply, a guide to sexual  
pleasure for and with women. It  
is an open-minded book about  
what feels good physically. The  
focus is sharing pleasure with  
women: making someone you  
love and/or yourself feel good.  

Written in straightforward and  
honest style, Loving Women  
deals with the entire range of  
sexual stimulation, from  
masturbation and foreplay to  
artificial stimulation and oral  
sex.  

I was somewhat put off by the  
opening paragraph of the book,  
which refers to heterosexual  
lovemaking. It is an explanation  
of why the book isn’t heterosex-  
ual. Is this really necessary, I  
wondered. Why is it so hard to do  
our own thing without referring  
to men or apologizing to them?  

Fortunately this beginning  
approach does not carry  
throughout the book. Nomadic  
Sisters move on to discussions  
of sex that are strictly female  
oriented.  

Up-Down Glossary  

The Up-Down Glossary  
provided by Nomadic Sisters at  
the beginning of the book offers  
a very good start for getting your  
head into the right place to read  
this manual. It clearly exposes  
the sexist and heterosexist at-  
titude toward lovemaking, as  
reflected through dictionaries,  
written by men, of course.  

The word “clitoris” is a fine  
example. The Down glossary  
(taken from the Random House  
Dictionary of the English  
Language) defines the word  
thus: the erectile organ of the  
vulva, homologous to the penis of  

poetry in some cases in order to  
make her statement.  

If some of her earlier themes  
have disappeared, others have  
come to the center of attention in  
a very painful way. Her loss of  
faith:  

“I saw only the little  
white dish of my faith  
breaking in the crater.”  
— The Sickness Unto Death  

Her frightful sense of polluting  
evil in herself comes to the  
surface as it never has before:  
“When I tell the priest  

I am full of bowel  

movement, right to the  
fingers, He shrugs.  

Because to one, shit is  
a feeder of plants,  
to another the evil  
that permeates them.  
— Is It True?  

The search the book relates is  
for God, who can take this evil  
away. Since Sexton was Chris-  
tian and Catholic, this God is  
God the Father, and possibly the  
husband, too. In “The God  
Monger,” she says,  
“I... went in search  
it could be said,  
of my husband (i.e. the  
one who carries you  
through).”  

A few moments of gladness of  
a sort stand out in this celebra-  
tion of death. In one poem, called  
“Welcome Morning," she gives  
thanks to God for his presence in  
the vividly apprehended details  
of a day beginning in her  
household. In another (“Not So.  
Not So.) she denies the  
presence of God in material  
creation:  

“He is in the graves  

of the horses.  
“He is in the Swarm,  

the frenzy of bees...”  
Then,  

“Heaven replies,  

Not so! Not so!”  

the male. The Up glossary,  
composed by Nomadic Sisters,  
gives this definition: the erectile  
organ of the vulva which is  
usually stimulated to produce  
orgasm.  

The word “love” also serves to  
illustrate the point. While the  
Down glossary defines it in  
terms of affection for a member  
of the opposite sex, the Up  
glossary is not so narrow in  
scope. It focuses on the qualities  
of love, “warm personal attach-  
ment,” rather than on the object  
of the emotion.  

Getting in Touch  

The body of the book begins  
with a section on masturbation  
— a proper beginning. With a  
positive attitude toward this  

God and hope can be reached  
only by shedding the body. In  
some ways, reading The Awful  
Rowing Toward God is like  
watching a woman walk over a  
cliff after illusory peace and  
security over the brink. In an  
equivocal poem called “The  
Wall,” she says,  

“Take off your life  

like trousers,  

your shoes, your underwear,  
then take off your flesh,  
unpick the lock of  

your bones.  

In other words  

take off the wall  

that separates you  

from God.”  

The word “trousers” catches  
the eye after the initial impact of  
the statement. The thought  
suggests itself to this reviewer  
again, as it has in the past, that  
Sexton spoke to men; the Father,  
the Husband, the Priest, the  
Psychiatrist. Did she ever speak  
to women? For all her suffering  
as a woman, she was not  
strongly feminist at any time,  
even though many feminists  
seem to have identified with her.  
Here at the last, she is looking to  
deified man to save her from the  
evils that dogged her, internal  
and external.  

The last poem in the book,  
“The Rowing Endeth,” is a  
fantasy of finding God. She and  
her god play poker on the shores  
of the island that is Him. She  
wins with a royal straight flush.  
God wins more with five aces.  
God’s wild card. Cosmic  
laughter. God's protective cer-  
tainty of winning, without which  
he cannot save or secure.  

Even if Sexton’s greatest poetic  
excellences were in her earlier  

The Awful,  
God is worth reading both for its  
poetry, and for the final record of  
the fate of a woman of genius in  
a world that still belongs to men.  

activity, the object is getting in  
touch with one’s own body and  
how it works. This section sets  
the tone for the entire book,  
which is that sex is fun, that the  
senses are to be enjoyed.  

It is also the part of the book  
hardest to totally agree with due  
to the recommendation of using  
dildos for both self and partner  
stimulation. By comparing the  
definitions of the dildo in the Up  
and Down glossary we get a  
better idea of where Nomadic  
Sisters are coming from in their  
approach to the subject. They  
see the dildo not as a penis  
substitute but as an object for  
vaginal stimulation.  

But I think most women find  
this concept distasteful at best. If  

Willie Tyson:  
Full Count  
Lima Bean Records  

Lorrie Baum  

There is a new feminist record  
label based in Washington D.C.  
The label is Lima Bean Records,  
and its first album is Willie  
Tyson's Full Count. Lima Bean  
plans to use the profits made on  
Full Count to produce an album  
by Washington D.C. — based  
singer-songwriter Casse Culver.  
Further plans include the  
production of an album of  
children’s songs, sung by Ginni  
Clemens of Chicago.  

Willie Tyson is originally from  
Florida, and has lived and per-  
formed in Washington D.C. for  
1½ years. She sings, writes,  
plays 12-string guitar, piano and  
synthesizer. She composed and  
arranged all the selections on  
Full Count. The style is basical-  
ly folk, with a slight country  
sound on some of the cuts. It is  
easy listening music. Ms.  
Tyson's voice is clear and strong,  
with a fairly heavy vibrato. She  
acknowledges Bob Dylan as one  
of the main influences on her  
music.  

This reviewer feels Ms. Tyson  
has more potential as a  
songwriter than is evidenced on  
this album. Most of the cuts are  
not terribly exciting, either  
musically or lyrically, although  
some very sound writing is  
involved. “Beautiful” and “Die  
Smiling Blues” are lyrically  
intricate and clever. “Willie  
Tyson's First Easy Piece” is  
simple on every level, but has a  
Joan Baez — type emotional  
quality which is missing in  
most of the other cuts. “Time” is, in my  

opinion, the only truly exciting  
piece of music on the album.  

women did not associate the  
dildo with the male penis, it  
might be possible to take a more  
positive view of its use among  
women. But try as we might,  
most women are pretty much  
saddled with that association,  
making the idea of its use non-  
appealing.  

Beyond that aspect is the  
question of artificial stimulation  
of any kind. Why use it at all?  
Because it feels good? Perhaps.  

Yet I think I would rather be  

touched by something warm and  
real than by something literally  
man-made.  

Variety and Spice

Meg Christian:  
I Know You Know  
Olivia Records  
Woodwoman  

Meg Christian is a singer,  
songwriter, guitarist, autohar-  
pist, feminist and lesbian. Olivia  
Records is a national women’s  
recording company, committed  
to making music accessible to  
women on every level. Together,  
Meg and Olivia have come up  
with I Know You Know, the first  
album to be produced on the  
label, and it's great.  

The blending of poetically vivid  
and politically meaningful lyrics  
is a rare art, and on this album it  
has been achieved. Running my  
eyes over the lyrics enclosed  
with the record, I was struck first  
by the fact that these songs  
speak to me, they speak about  
my experience as a woman and  
especially as a lesbian.  

Five of the ten songs on the  
album were written by Meg  
herself. These vary from the  
solid beat of “Song to My  
Mama,” about the agonies of not  
being able to come out to her  
mother to the lyrically delicate,  
musically intricate “Scars” (“I  
am still caught unawares /by  
ghosts lurking in my nightmares  
/ that mock our revolution”).  
“Ode to a Gym Teacher,” based  
on true experience, is a very  
funny account of that almost  
universal crush, with a sing-  
along chorus. This song, record-  
ed live at the Full Moon  
Coffeehouse San Francisco, is  
preceded by a fairly lengthy  
background story, which  
somehow still hasn't grown  
stale, despite the fact that I must  
by now have heard it at least a  
dozen times. “Morning Song”  
and “Valentine Song” are gentle  
and moving love songs that  
succeed better than most in  
combining poetry and melody.  

Meg’s voice is agile, and her  
material is well chosen to highlight  
both her singing and her  
considerable skill as a guitarist.  
She plays both classical and steel  
string guitars on the album, and her  
classical training is evident in  
the ease and dexterity of her  
accompaniment. She also  
arranged all the songs on the  
album, and she has a fine bunch  
of musicians working with her.  
Using a diverse collection of  
instruments including piano,  
bass, synthesizer, cello and  
saxophone, she has evolved a  
background of sound which,  
while rich in its own right, never  
imposes on her voice or on the  
sense of the song. A good  
example of this is Linda Lewis's  
song “Goodbye Joanna,” one of  
my personal favorites on this  
record.  

Technically Olivia has  
succeeded in producing an  
album of exceptionally high  
quality, despite a series of set-  
backs which delayed release.  
Having listened to I Know You  
Know, I’m left with a feeling of  
pride that a record as fine as this  
one should have come out of our  
movement. It's one of the best  
I've heard. Hear it.  

physically and how to improve  
on such a good thing. Each topic  
(setting, foreplay, manual  
stimulation, oral sex) is dealt  
with in an open and detailed yet  
sensitive way. Suggestions are  
offered for a great many  
positions for intercourse and a  
variety of techniques. Most of  
them seem appealing. The at-  
titude of the authors is that sex  
should remain interesting and  
new, “Even with something as  
exciting as sex we must  
remember that repetition could  
be limiting or even become  
boring,” they say.
