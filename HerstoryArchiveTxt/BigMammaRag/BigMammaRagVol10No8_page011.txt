A Call To Resist Imperialism Fascism And  

19 times to lead hundreds of  
slaves to freedom. Many others  
took up arms in the Civil War.  

After the war, African peo-  
ple realized they couldn't  
be free without land but the  
white supremacist organiza-  
tions along with the southern  
plutocracy conspired to keep  
them from controlling their  
land.  

Rape was used as a tool of  
repression. Historically it  
has always been used to break  
the spirit of the conquered.  
The men who sought to defend  
their women were lynched.  
Lynching was exposed as the  
political tool it was through  
the efforts of groups like the  
Universal Assn. of Ethiopian  
Women in the 1930s.  

New African women have a  
rich history of struggle.  
Assata Shakur is a beloved  
example. She took up arms in  
revolutionary violence against  
the U.S. government. She was  
caught and incarcerated. On  
Nov. 2, 1979, she was libera-  
ted by the Black Liberation  
Army (BLA). Chinganji then  
read a quote from Assata in  
the underground, "Sisters,  

Black people will never be  
free unless Black women parti-  

cipate in every aspect of  
struggle and every level of  
struggle. I think Black women,  
more than anybody on the face  
of this earth, recognize the  
urgency of our situation. Be-  
cause it is we who come face  
to face with the institutions  
of our oppression ... Sisters,  
we have been abused economi-  
cally, we have been abused  
physically and we have been  
abused sexually. We have a  
long and glorious struggle  
on this land, this planet.”  
She then went on to describe  
the special oppression New  
African women face from the  
abortion propaganda that is  
bombarding their communities  
from radio and billboard ads.  
There is much more concentra-  
ted advertising of abortion  
and abortion clinics in the  
Black neighborhoods than that  
in the white. "You have to ask  
yourself why." When the state  
is waging a genocidal war  
against their nation, why is  
abortion pushed so hard? "We  
have to question whether the  
slogan, women controlling  
their own bodies, is something  
we can do when we don't have  
control of our nations or our  
lives." So her group is waging  
a campaign against the propa-  

Black women in South  
Africa  

have been involved  

in prolonged struggles often  

political and social.  

ganda not because they feel  
women shouldn't have a choice,  
but that kind of propaganda  
doesn't give them a choice of  
all alternatives. Her group  
also takes an active stance  
against rape by offering a  
martial arts program.  

She finished by saying "As  
women of the Afrikan commun-  
ity our primary goal is the  
liberation of all Afrikan  
people. We are a colonized  
nation held captive in the  
confines of the U.S. We don't  
control our political/econo-  
mic destiny and resources. We  
are therefore vulnerable to  
acts of genocide from the  
colonizing nations. The fem-  
inist movement does not re-  
present the issues or goals  
that are most vital to the  
New Afrikan woman or the New  
Afrikan community. Ours is a  
struggle for our people for  
land and self-determination.  
New Afrikan people must rule  
themselves politically, econo-  
mically, culturally, spirit-  
ually, and in every other  
manner. For our total liber-  
ation, we see the need for  
the creation of independent  
institutions, new value sys-  
tems, the control of our  
lives and the land on which  
we live.

A discussion followed the

Magubane--South Africa/Connexions  

women panelists. The workshop  
was maybe half and half Third  
World women and white women,  
and ended up being a dialogue  
between them, for the most  
part. Several issues were  
raised during this time.  

The following is a partial  
account of the discussion  
that went on, and at the end  
there is a list of the resol-  
utions that were generated  
by the workshop.  

Early on, it was asked by  
one white woman, "What, in  
your experience, has proved  
to be the best way to deal  
with sexism among the male  
comrades: 1) person to per-  
son, 2) group to group, 3)  
writing a letter, 4) refusing  
to work or 5) doing more work  
than anyone else?" Chinganji  
Akinyela, from the women's  
organizing committee of the  
Republic of New Afrika, rep-  
lied, "I think we would use  
a combination of all of those  
tactics....other than refus-  
ing to work. Because it is  
only through the working re-  
lationship are we able to  
deal with it. It would be  
ridiculous for us to say that  
we are not confronted with  
these things, because we un-  
derstand that we are confront-  
ed with it....it depends on  
the situation. We wouldn't  
necessarily wait for a coll-  
ective meeting or....whatever  
it is something that has  
to be dealt with on every  

level....every level... .until  
it is eradicated."  

Priscilla Falcon from El  
Comite added, "I just want to  
put an added perspective on  
that....it is not so much a  
problem within the political  
organizations as it is with  
people outside of it. In the  
community, people you see on  
a day to day basis, and this  
is where you might want to  
use another kind of tactic."  
She also said (not exact  
words), that feminists often  
don't see Chicanas in the  
forefront of struggle and so  
tend to see them as backward.  
“But this is from your own  
internal perspective....it's  
not the way we see it." She  
said the concept of La Fami-  
lia is a valuable one in pol-  
itical organization and that  
it has helped her people to  
survive all these years. She  
added that people organizing  
with La Familia as a model  
are not going to change to  
please feminists.  

The issue of abortion came  
up first as an extension to  
the question brought up by  
Chinganji in her presentation  
that propaganda pushing abor-  
tion in Black communities is  
genocide. The question was  
asked, Where are these abor-  
tions being done? Chinganji  
replied that they are done in  
women's clinics, in private  
clinics and that what their  
research is showing is that  

national  

&  

Colonialism, Support National Liberation  

many of these are "just but-  
cher shops," where the women  
come away from the $100 abor-  
tions with their insides so  
mutilated that they would  
require extensive (and ex-  
pensive) reconstructive sur-  
gery before they would be  
able to have children again.  
So it is being used as a  
form of forced sterilization.  

There was more discussion  
on the issue of forced ster-  
ilization, with Puerto Rican  
women and men bringing up  
statistics from their homeland  
and their lives: that 35% of  
Puerto Rican women and 27% of  
Puerto Rican men have been  
sterilized, that in 1981, as  
a result of the United States  
2p/20 Plan (a long term plan  
by government and corporate  
leaders to transform Puerto  
Rico into an industrial park,  
remove the population to the  
center of the island or to be  
cheap labor in New York, to  
completely exploit all the  
mineral resources of the is-  
land and pave a lot of it  
over. These goals are to be  
accomplished by a combination  
of military, economic and  
genocidal “population control"  
programs.) 5 towns on Puerto  
Rico's coast had zero popula-  
tion growth. Another woman  
reminded us that, 10 years be-  
fore birth control was widely  
used in the United States, it  
was widespread on the island,  
using Puerto Rican women as  
guinea pigs.  

A Black woman from New York  
said, "I want to talk about  
the question of abortion, es-  
pecially in relation to the  
white women's movement. What  
I see in New York is that  
the white women in New York,  
on one level they say we  
should fight against sterili-  
zations, which it is clear  
that we should. But they also  
encourage us as Black women to  
have abortions because we  
can't afford to have children  
- there's a contradiction in  
these two stances. You cannot  
fight for abortion for us and  
then say that you are against  
us having children so we can  
have control of our bodies.  
We don’t control our bodies.  
And then I wonder why white  
women are so interested in us  
having abortions - so we can  
take control of our bodies.  
We don't control how we eat,  
where we live, where we sleep  
- so how can we control our  
bodies....kill ourselves, kill  

our children.  

A white woman from Women  
Against Genocide proposed a  
counter demonstration against  
the Right to Lifers and the  
Moral Majority when they gat-  
her in Cherry Hills, NJ on  
July 17. She brought out that  
the opposition to the right to  
life rally now is single iss-  
ue - pro abortion. She wanted  
a demonstration that supported  
the national liberation move-  
ment freedom fighters, was  
against forced sterilization  
and against genocide. She  
wanted an endorsement from  
the women's workshop at the  
conference for this counter  
demonstration.  

This generated more discus-  
sion on whether or not this  
was an issue the Black, Puerto  
Rican, Chicano/Mexicano women  
and national liberation move-  
ments wanted to endorse. One  
Puerto Rican woman said, "As  
Third World women, abortion  
is not our major problem. Our  
problems are that the police  
are shooting our 8 and 9 year  
olds." Another woman said,  

"If you want to go demonstrate  
go ahead and demonstrate. Just  
don't ask us to go ahead.  

Several Third World women  
kept making this point - that  
abortion is not a priority  
issue for them. But this whole  
section of the discussion  
group got swallowed up: trying  
to make this point, while  
white women pushed the topic  
further.  

A Puerto Rican woman said  
then, on the issue of taking  
leadership from Third World  
women, "I'm getting a real  
paternalistic feeling from  
white women on what should be  
done....especially on the  
issue of abortion. One of our  
Puerto Rican compañeras al-  
ready said, 'While those  
things are important to us,  

Women In Response  

Susanna Smith  

I attended the National  
Conference Against Repression  
and am writing some of my  
responses to that conference.  
My responses come from my  
perspective as a 29-year-old  
white lesbian feminist.  

I went to the conference  
because I want to make links  
with other groups that I see  
as having a common enemy with  
me - the white male ruling  

they are not of the major  
issue.' The Black compañera  
here talked about why it is  
important for us to have chil-  
dren, and yet on and on the  
discussion continued. And peo-  
ple kept trying to bring up  
their own little things. and  
that stems from....a paternal-  
istic attitude of white women;  
this feeling that...we don't  
know what we want, or that  

we can't handle what we want.  
But we know what we want, and  
do know how to solve these  
problems. As Priscilla said,  
it is all based on our poli-  
tical view. Our problems are  
solved politically.  

Another issue that provoked  
discussion was that of child-  
rearing. A New Afrikan woman  
said, "I want to say I think  
it'd be a very good idea for  
some of you to read the lit-  
erature on Revolutionary  
Morals by Santucho. He goes  
into the question of rearing  
children....If we continue  
in this struggle and if we  
are going to be equal partners  
in this struggle, there's go-  
ing to have to be changes....  
We're not giving up our child-  
ren and we're not giving up  
having our children, but in  
terms of the kind of arrange-  
ments that are going to have  
to be made, in terms of revol-  
utionary combatants, there's  
going to have to be a differ-  
ent kind of relationship. A  
child might not have their  
quote 'natural mother', I  
mean the example is very  
clear, of the daughter of  
Judy Clark, who was named  
after Harriet Tubman, she  
does not miss her mother in  
the sense of having one per-  
son...I mean that is a privi-  
lege and a luxury to be my  
child, you understand?"  

“The fact that Harriet seems  
to feel secure with whom Har-  

class. I think that in order  
to effect change in this  
world, we will all need to  
be able to work together, to  
educate and learn from each  
other about how we oppress/  
are oppressed and how each  
of us works toward a vision  
of a more humane world.  

One workshop I attended  
was on Prisoners. People  
talked of both their first  
and second hand experiences  
of being in prison and deal-  

Big  

riet is with is the most sig-  
nificant factor for Harriet  
and any other child. The re-  
lationships are going to have  
to be changed. We are going  
to have to start our extended  
family networks again. And  
they might not be our blood  
family - they might have to  
be our revolutionary families.  
But they have to be because  
we are not going to have gen-  
ocide in any of our nations."  

The following are resolu-  
tions that were passed from  
the workshop on women and  
repression.  

Be it resolved that the  
white women's movement not  
be collaborators in the abor-  
tion of Chicana/Mexicana,  
Puerto Rican or New Afrikan  
women, because they become  
partners in genocide of Third  
World people.  

That the Third World Nation-  
al Liberation struggles deve-  
lop regional strategies that  
help increase the active par-  
ticipation of women and child-  
ren in National Liberation  
wars.  

Resolved, that the family  
structure be redefined in  
order that the responsibil-  
ities of childrearing and  
nation building be the res-  
ponsibilities of the total  
movement.  

The panel of speakers at  
the workshop developed this  
resolution:  

Be it resolved that we dev-  
elop and distribute slide  
shows and printed material  
that emphasizes the full  
participation of women in  
all the National Liberation  
struggles.  

That we should reject fem-  
inism and that our struggle  
should evolve from within the  
revolutionary organization as  
opposed to being separated.

Becoming more and more pre-

of isolation: and behavior  
modification - rewarding peo-  
ple for "good" behavior and  
punishing them for "bad" be-

ting with the system.  

People also talked about  
non-collaboration, which is
