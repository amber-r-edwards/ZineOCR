One Feminist's Battle Against Cancer ...

Janet Sergi was diagnosed
last summer as having
brain cancer, more specific-
ally a large brain tumor
called an astrocytoma. She
subsequently underwent sur-
gery and radiation treatment.
Janet, a longtime Denver les-
bian feminist, school bus
driver, activist and writer
(frequently for BMR) talks
here about her experiences.

Interview by Clair Kaplan

BMR: Do you want to start
talking about what happened
when you first got sick?

JS: I was getting sick for
about 6 months before I had
actual visual signs. I had
broken up in a relationship
and I tended to blame the

health

kind of sad feeling I had on
that. But then as I thought
about it - that really wasn't
it. So then I went to thera-
py, trying to see where this
sadness and feeling of loss
and also being unable to
control my emotions in any
way; where this was coming
from. So I went to a thera-
pist and dealt with the
emotions, but still I was
crying all the time. I just
couldn't control myself. As

I found out, I had this gi-
gantic brain tumor, and my
ability to reason, to walk,
to think, to move - was
slowly disintegrating. And

I just couldn't believe
that a broken relationship
could do this.

I was going to get some
tranquilizers in a local
health clinic, and I reali-
zed that I couldn't even
sit up, and someone took me
to the hospital and almost
instantly they diagnosed a
large brain tumor.

So, then I was in the hos-
pital. I remember I had
some Italian food, and then
I was having all these tests
and then the next thing I
knew I was in the hospital
in the recovery room. I
guess I was in the recovery
room. Who knows where you
are when you're in the hos-
pital? And I survived. I
was determined that I was
going to live, and I did.
And I think that was the
strangest thing. Everybody
was sure that I was dying.

That I was going to die.
And they told the doctor
and they told my sister and
they told my brother that

I would die, and to prepare
for that. I told them not
to worry, that I would live-
that it takes a long hard
time to kill a Sergi.

So then the next thing I
remember was being in the
hospital and like I predict-
ed - I was still here. I was
really spunky at that time,
but drowsy and tired. I
kept feeling my bandage!
Those huge bandages. And
then one time at night I
tore the bandages off so I
could see - so I felt my
dented head. And I was told
that I would lose part of
my sight - that I would ne-
ver have real good peripher-
al vision. In fact they warned
me that it was very
likely that I might lose my
sight - so there was great
joy in being able to see.

At that point I didn't know
if I could walk or not. All
these basic things. Another
thing is just the joy of
coming out of this, and also
the scariness. Would I ever
be able to walk? And I was
very confused. Would I ever
get my emotional thing to-
gether?

The hospital itself with
very old people would remind
me of mortality and my fear
of death, and so every time
I saw an old person I would
get scared.

So they put me in a pri-
vate room. I had so many
visitors, all women, and
sometimes I would remember

them coming, and sometimes
I wouldn't. And I let go of
a lot of hostility towards
people. I would give short
curt answers, or just be
incoherent and have tremen-
dous rage.

BMR: How do you think your
friends have held up under
some of your hostility and
rage?

JS: I think pretty well.
(Laughter). Some people can-
not deal with it and so they
just do not choose to see

me. Some. But the majority
are good troopers, I think.
Also, I still can't control
some of this rage. I can
just blow over, over the
littlest thing. And I'm work-
ing very hard on that, be-
cause it isn't other peo-
ple's responsibility. Also,

I fluctuate between rage and
sadness. Sadness for myself
for the predicament I'm in.

I try and weigh my personal

predicament and everyone
else's. Since I'm still go-
ing to outpatient, I see all
the other people who are
still sick in the hospital,
and it reminds me how close
you are to that sickness,
and also how much I want to
get well.

BMR: Do you remember how
in the recovery room after
surgery you were telling
me, "It's all mind over
matter and my mind will not
allow my body to die." And
you were saying things like
"Dykes don't give up, Dykes
don't die."

JS: I don't remember that
particular point in history,

but I do know that I said
similar things, and I say it
every day of my life; that no
matter how hard it is, I'm
not going to let this thing
beat me. And you have to keep
saying that to yourself, even
at the pits of despair. You
have to know that life is
kind of like a gift, and you
just can't throw it away.

BMR: So, do you think that
being sick made you stronger?

JS: Oh yes. As a human be-
ing. Sometimes I think that
with my hard head - I had to
have a huge brain tumor and
surgery to get some things
into my head.

Life is not easy and yet
at the same time it is very
easy. At the same moment
there is a contradiction
there, that the easiest way
is just to be alive, and the
easiest way is also to let
yourself fall into the depths
of despair and not be able
to move. Physically and men-
tally.

BMR: How old were you when
you got sick? You're pretty
young for such a serious ill-
ness. How did you feel about
that?

JS: I'm 33. I had very few
illnesses, I was a very hea-
lthy person, and that probably
helped me a great deal in the
cancer. My job was driving a
school bus - pretty demand-
ing. Those little devils. I
liked the kids though, no
matter how bad they were. I
think you have to like some-
thing, no matter what you're
doing.

Anyways, getting cancer so
young, I felt really ripped
off. “Why me?" - that's what
every cancer patient says.
And then the answer is, "Why
not you?" It's a terrible
disease, and I don't know
what will happen. Hopefully
it will be eliminated. The
cost and the torment it
wrecks on a person's life.

BMR: And there's other wo-
men, basically young women,
in our community with lots
of serious illnesses. Women
in their 30's.

JS: I find it real strange
that we have these kinds of
old diseases in our 30's. I
think that there's some kind
of environmental factor here,
but I don't know what it is.
I never had any cancer in my

voices from our lives

“Living, That Is The Frightening Thing”

family, especially a serious
one like mine. So, it seems
a little odd to me. You know,
I do question that. Why are
there so many of us younger
people now having these
terrible diseases?

BMR: So, then what happen-
ed when you got out of the
hospital and you had to deal
with where and how you were
going to live? Probably most
people get out and have
families, a marriage,
social that's set up to
take care of them. And you
came out as a single woman,
and a lesbian, and without
a lot of money. How did all
that affect what happened
from there?

JS: Right after the hospi-
tal, there were a lot of
people to take care of me.
There was someone to stay at
night for a while. Different
people took turns. And then
I was slowly able to stay up
by myself at night, but that
was a terrible transition -
not to have someone here. And
then comes when you're get-
ting better and people feel
they've done their duty, and
I guess they have. And so the
loneliness comes in. And that
is something I fear at this
point - to be alone.

BMR: But you're alone a lot
now.

JS: I have to be. Most
at work. I can't
be at this point.

BMR: So, do you feel like
you've both gained and lost
some people?

JS: I think yes, for what-
ever reason. Some people are
not here for me. Sometimes I
get very bitter, and some-
times I say that if they do
not understand or want to be
with me, then what can I say?

BMR: Do you think people
are afraid of their own death?

JS: Yes. I think so. I'm not
the old sarcastic fun person
that I used to be. I'm usually
more solemn than I’ve been be-
fore. But some people I know
are able to have sorrow in
their lives. Like this per-
son I met who was blind for 6
months, and I was able to have
a kind of, not instant comm-
unication, but understanding
of that. Not that I'm blind,
but I don't think I would
ever have thought about blind
people before my surgery. Now
I understand a little how it
is to have your complete
functions. Not to be a happy
person running around with
just our little problems that
everybody has.

One of the main things that
I want to say is that it's
not death that's frightening,
I think it's really living.
It's living that's the fright-
ening thing. All the choices
you have to make to be an
ethical and loving person.

BMR: When you were having
all those symptoms - you
couldn't drive and you were
having a hard time remembering
things, and if you went out
for a walk you couldn't find
your way back - no one ever
thought of anything physical
being wrong. Everyone was just
concentrating on emotional
stuff. Do you think that's a
blindness in our community,
always thinking that problems
are emotional?

JS: Yeah. Right. I mean I
was acting silly. Not silly,
but rather incoherent. But
people always assume that a
woman is a mental case if
you're crying and stuff. I
cried because I had a brain
tumor. And I'm still recovering
from a brain tumor. And I
cry a lot.

BMR: Yeah, people always
assume that women are emotion-
al wrecks. I mean, if a man
all of a sudden was having
the problems you had and
couldn't drive his bus any-
more, he'd probably go in for
a physical check-up right a-
way. We always go to psychia-
trists.

Actively Participating In Our Own Medical Care

Jeanette Horrell

"You have a lump in your
breast." What an impact these
words have had on my life in
the past year. Even though
the lumps appear not to be
cancerous, the fear of the
possibility is always there.
Even with that, the conseque-
nces of the discovery have
been much more far reaching
than the actual physical pro-
blem.

The original shock with a
week wait for any news gave
me plenty of time to think--
too much in fact. What was it
about breast cancer that
scared me so much? I had to
come face to face with the
fact that despite my declara-
tions of being a feminist, I
was as frightened of the
thought of losing my breast
as of the cancer itself. My
image of myself was wrapped
up in my sexual appeal to men
And how can anyone compete
with the Playboy bunny com-
plete with no marks, no scars,
no signs of having lived in
her body at all without any
breasts? The absurdity of the
whole situation was a rather
dramatic way to begin to see
the truth. I wish that I

could say that in the last
year I have overcome all of
those feelings, but I haven't.
At least now I can choose to
fight against them. And every
battle won makes the next one
easier.

The actual problem turned
out not to be cancer, but
fibrocystic breast disease.
It means I have a lot of lumps
in my breasts which need to
be watched constantly for
the possibility of cancer.
It has forced me to take a
more active role in my own
medical care. Over this time
I have needed a lot of infor-
mation and had to make de-
cisions on how to handle
different problems. I was
lucky to be dealing with a
clinic run for and by wo-
men. The professionals
there were willing to ans-
wer questions, to explain
their reasons for choosing
certain actions, and to
allow me room in the deci-
sion making process. I
learned the benefits of be-
coming an active rather
than passive participant in
my own health care. At times
I still feel really frustra-
ted when decisions have to
be made basically on the

doctor's opinions. When a
mammogram was ordered as a
diagnostic tool, I was hesi-
tant. I knew many consider
them dangerous and possibly a
cause of the cancer they are
supposed to detect. Was the
risk worth the information
the doctor wanted? I didn't

know. In the end I had no
choice. I simply don't have
enough information. I had to
trust her opinion. Although
I know that is what they are
trained for, I guess I've
had too many lousy experiences
to ever really trust doctors,
women or not. I do think
that being a more active par-
ticipant removes a lot of the
fears.

One of the saddest things I
learned through all of this
was how isolated from each
other women allow themselves
to become. When I started to
talk I found all kinds of
women with similar problems.
Yet none of them had ever
mentioned it. Fear had kept
us from communicating with
our greatest source of stren-
gth--other women. Somewhere
during this time, I read a
short article about a woman
who had had a mastectomy. She
had photos taken throughout
for a book about her exper-
iences. What courage it takes
to face it all--in color
prints. We all have that kind
of strength, but too often
we try to face it all alone.
We must all learn to spread
it out, to take it and to
share it with each other. If
there is one promise I have
made to myself out of this,
it is to keep building commu-
nication bridges with women
all the time. Silence and
isolation are the perfect
tools of the oppressors in
every walk of life. We must
never stop reaching out for
each other.
