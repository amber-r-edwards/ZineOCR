Reoccupy Land

Lyn: I've been identifying  
tremendously with the black  
women as women. One of the  
big things for me at Bas-  
tion Point was that the lead-  
ership was women.  
Sandra: Does that make you  
trust them more?  
Lyn: Yes. It was the same at  
Waitangi. I would have had  
trouble participating to the  
extent that I did if the  
leadership had been male.  
Trust is a big issue. I know  
what my sisters will do,  
black or white, but you never  
know with men.  
MAORI SURVEY ON THE WAR

Over the years the Maori  
have been subjected to a  
great deal of investigation  
which has produced a forest  
of statistics. Often the in-  
formation, although accurate,  
gives only a part of  
the picture. For the first  
time in their history, a  
Maori organization, the Maori  
Women's Welfare League, is  
conducting a scientific sur-  
vey on the health of Maori  
Women: This month the survey  
is being conducted in South  
Auckland after the first  
phase of field work in the  
Bay of Plenty.  

The interviews are being  
carried out by voluntary  
workers all of whom are Maori

women, trained by members of  
the Society for Research on  
Women. The data collected so  
far gives unique and inter-  
esting information which  
would never have emerged  

in an ordinary survey.

The Maori Women's Welfare  
League has always advocated  
self-help and helping each  
other and the research dir-  
ector, Mrs. Elizabeth Mur-  
chie of Rotorua, a past  
national president of the  
League, describes it as "the  
most exciting thing to happen  
in 20 years." Apart from the  
scientific value the results  
will have, many respondents  
have said how much they en-  
joyed being interviewed by  
other Maori women with so  
much interest in their well-  
being. We await the results  
with great interest:

BASTION POINT

Bastion Point is a piece of  
disputed Maori land in Metro-  
politan Auckland. In 1869  
Judge Fenton, a native land  
court judge, declared 700  
acres of Orakei inalienable  
forever. In 1982 as a result  
of land grab legislation,  
only a third of an acre re-  
mains in Ngati Whatua owner-  
ship--the cemetery. In Jan.  
1977 descendants of the Ngati  
Whatua tried to stop govern-

ment subdivision of the land  
by occupying Bastion Point.  
The trade unions placed a  
green ban around Bastion  
Point, forbidding workers to  
take part in any subdivision  
work. Joanne Hawke died in a  
fire during the occupation.

506 days later the army and  
police evicted 222 people.  
Lengthy and time-consuming  
court case battles forced the  
State to drop 180 of the  
charges.

A High Court decision ruled  
that Bastion Point is Crown  
land. The government handed  

ISIS

over the disputed land to the  
Housing Corporation. Four  
years later the Housing Corp.  
reopened the controversy when  
it opened Bastion Point for  
private tender (sale).  
Marches, tender of pots, pans  
and blankets and group  
arrests of 12 women and  
later 117 people, forced the  
Housing Corp. not to accept  
any tenders.

At this moment we do not  
know Bastion Point's fate.  
People's power has stopped  
the government's plans over  
the past five years.
