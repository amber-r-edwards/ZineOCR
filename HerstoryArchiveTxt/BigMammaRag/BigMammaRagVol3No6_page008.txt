Psychic Power -

New Advantage  
for Woman?

Nancy Boyd

Knowledge is worthless un-  
less it can be used in a person's  
life, integrated into a meaningful  
totality, a wholeness. All of us  
have within us the power to be  
who we want to be, yet much is  
lacking. Part of the problem is  
that we do not use what we  
have. Sometimes that is  
because we do not KNOW what  
we have or who we are.

This is particularly true of the  
area of our lives we sometimes  
call the psychic. This can cover  
everything from intuition to ESP,  
to dreams, to astral projection, to  
complete unity with ourselves  
and all things. It can be as simple  
as walking into a roomful of  
strangers and instantly liking  
some while disliking others, for  
no apparent outward reason, or  
as complex as seeing a vision of  
the future that later comes true,  
of going into astral projection. I  
believe every person has  
“psychic experiences,” even if  
they are not aware of it.

No matter what  
happens to you during  
this week, consciously  
keep your thoughts on  
positive things and  
watch what happens.

Religion Vs. Science?

It is a sign of our times that in-  
terest in parapsychology,  
spirituality, and mysticism are  
growing, at the same time that  
scientific ‘proof’ of psychic  
phenomena is abundant. For  
“them that needs proof,” it's  
here or on the way. For “them  
that’s always known,” it’s a time  
of deeper discovery and change.  
The longstanding war between  
science and religion can  
probably soon be laid to rest as  
both approach each other  
cautiously on the middle ground  
of parapsychology, in discover-  
ing that ‘esoteric’ and ‘scientific’  
truths may be one and the  
same (a fact now admitted by  
both sides). Some good source  
material on this subject can be  
found in Psychic Discoveries  
Behind the Iron Curtain and in  
Supernature, both available in  
paperback.

This apparent truce between  
science and religion opens the  
way for the discovery of different  
ways of perceiving ourselves  
and the world that is our home.  
Even the question, ‘What is  
parapsychology?’ cannot be  
answered so simply as in the  
past, when it was defined as  
phenomena that had no scien-  
tific explanation. As for religion,  
many ‘traditional’ churches are  
now opening their eyes and their  
doors to such things as psychic  
healing and the philosophy of  
reincarnation, a position that  
would have been unheard of  
even five years ago. And yet, in  
the early phases of most major  
religions, most of what we call  
parapsychology today was in  
common practice. Perhaps what  
parapsychology is about now  
and in the future is to synthesize  
all discovery creatively into  
human existence, moving  
towards wholeness instead of  
fragmentation.

Women and the Psychic

As wholeness is also the  
milieu of the feminist move-  
ment, greater awareness is  
necessary within the movement,  
of all aspects of our lives. It is just  
possible that in our socio-  
economic-political impatience,  
we have neglected the most im-  
portant thing of all: our own  
wholeness and unity with  
ourselves and with the creative  
principles of the universe, which  
are essentially feminine in es-  
sence. They are regenerative,  
restorative, spiritual; they can be  
explained through experience  
only, and not very well in words.  
It is this experience which is es-  
pecially (and painfully) lacking in  
the feminist movement.

There are many reasons why  
we in the movement are where  
we are today with para-  
psychology. One explanation is  
the socialization of women and  
men. We have grown up in a  
culture that teaches us that men  
are supposed to be strong,  
aggressive, and unemotional.  
Women are supposed to be  
weak, passive, and emotional.  
This socialization extends to all  
we do, think, or say; we have  
been culturally conditioned to  
accept, reject, or adopt whatever  
values and attitudes best serve  
the society we live in. All of  
society has been conditioned to  
disregard the psychic areas, and  
psychic phenomena have been  
trashed for hoaxes (because of  
lack of scientific proof and  
because of out-and-out frauds  
who keep showing up all the  
time), shrouded in the Magick of  
religious structure, or denied  
outright. The main reasons most  
people don’t know anything  
about the psychic lie in our  
heritage from the past; religion  
has cloaked it in mysticism and  
secrecy (often for reasons not  
clear to us now), science has  
claimed it doesn’t even exist,  
and together, religion and  
science have helped create a  
culture that considers para-  
psychology a taboo subject. To  
most people today, the psychic  
world is still suspiciously  
foreign, and that is not as it  
should be. How can something  
which is part of our beings be  
foreign to us?

Women As the Psychic

For women, this alienation  
from ourselves is tragic.  
Everyone knows about  
“women’s intuition,” but it has  
been more of a joke than a  
respectful consideration of  
womanpower. A man will say it,  
for example, in a tone of voice  
which shows that what he really  
means is, “See what ODD  
creatures women are.” We as  
women are culturally oriented to  
sensitivity and emotional  
response, but only within our  
strictly confined roles. In our  
culture, a psychic woman is as  
nearly out of place as a  
transvestite, unless she  
happens to be a “religious” per-  
son or a scientist, either of which  
would give her more validity.  
Then there is always the unfor-  
tunate stigma of witchcraft that  
can be thrown at a psychic  
woman to further compound the  
guilt/fear complex of stepping  
out of bounds. We are thus  
denied the seeds of our psychic  
creativity, socially cut off from  
the seeds of our own  
womanhood. Even the law holds  
strident barriers against the  
practice of most areas of the psy-  
chic, and women, true to form of  
the patriarchy, feel its effects  
even more than men do.

Probably the main reason  
parapsychology has been re-  
jected by feminists is that we are  
still in combat with the two  
structures which work with it:  
science and religion. It would be  
difficult to say which structure  
has done more damage to  
women: technology or the  
Church. However, if we are to  
seek our own sources of  
wisdom, why should we “throw  
the baby out with the bath  
water”? In our frequent (and  
justifiable) rejection of  
technology and traditional  
religion, we should be careful to  
distinguish between that which  
is man-made and that which is  
man-raped, as even para-  
psychology has been. Neither  
science nor religion created psy-  
chic vision in human beings, and  
this should be clearly un-  
derstood. All of us have psychic  
potential, and women should  
begin to understand that to  
develop their psychic abilities  
does not mean that they have to  
espouse the two power struc-  
tures that have been working  
with it; women can develop their  
own alternatives in this as in all  
things. Why should we allow  
patriarchal structure to divide us  
off from our real power: our own  
wholeness?

Untapped Power

Basic to this discussion is the  
belief that wholeness includes  
psychic awareness. In the psy-  
chic world, and within our will,  
we have the creative power to  
change our lives. It is not  
mystical. It can be proven scien-  
tifically. I submit that the power  
of thought is controlled by the  
will, and that thought-power can  
literally create life-  
circumstances. And if we can do  
that, we can make ourselves  
whole. Without psychic  
awareness, we just sort of muddle  
through, hoping for the best.  
But why should we do that when  
we can control our cir-  
cumstances?  
This hypothesis can be easily  
demonstrated in several ways.  
First, think of the worst  
moments of your life. Then think  
of what you were thinking of and  
concentrating on during that  
time. (If you are honest with  
yourself, you will see your own  
negative thoughts.) Then think  
of the best moments of your life.  
Think of what your thoughts  
were during that time. It is more  
than chance that your thoughts  
will have been positive. A second  
demonstration is to examine  
your thoughts NOW. Are they  
positive or negative? Try an ex-  
periment. No matter what  
happens to you during this week,  
consciously keep your thoughts  
on positive things and watch  
what happens. When you feel  
yourself slipping into negative  
thoughts, change them. You  
have the power to do that, and  
you'll be surprised at the results  
when you do.

Now, there is a “scientific” or  
psychic law behind all this talk of  
positive thinking: like attracts  
like. We are what we think! Our  
thoughts have energy, and we  
are always attracting what we  
are thinking about because of  
the energy connected to and  
generated by these thoughts. In  
general, we attract to ourselves  
that which is necessary for our  
growth. (If we are advanced, we  
may do it consciously; if not, we  
do it unconsciously, without our  
full awareness, and wonder how  
we got into such a mess.) We are  
thus continually confronted with  
the same situations until we are  
able to resolve them. Observe  
the patterns of the events in your  
life, and seek their meaning. Did  
you learn and progress, go on to  
new experiences, or has there  
been a sameness? What has not  
been resolved? Creative thinking  
is creative living, and we all have  
the power to do that.

These are just some ideas of  
the overwhelming practical  
applications of parapsychology.

The main benefit is that we have  
to discard values and attitudes  
that we have been socialized  
into, if we are to perceive truth;  
that in itself is a cleansing ex-  
perience.  
Psychic Survival Skill

But why should we as women  
learn to develop our psychic  
potential and awareness? The  
first reason is to become whole.  
Other reasons, which may be of  
varying importance to each in-  
dividual, are that it is a tool to use  
in surviving the destructive  
energies of the patriarchy; it is a  
power that can be used not only  
in defense of ourselves but to  
build creatively the sort of world  
that we must build; and it is the  
key to personal and direct know-  
ledge of all the universe; it is a  
way to grow, to become, to learn.  
It can be both means and end. It  
has no limits, and it is potentially  
the most powerful force  
feminism may ever hope to con-  
ceive.

To continue, entrance to the  
psychic world can be different  
things for different people. It can  
include astrology, Tarot,  
telepathy (ESP), dream analysis,  
memory, clairvoyance (seeing or  
knowing the future), psy-  
chokinesis (moving physical ob-  
jects with the mind), astral pro-  
jection (soul-travel, or out-of-  
body experiences), healing,  
visualization (use of imagination  
and concentration to attract  
what one wills), and more. A per-  
son may develop her psychic  
awareness in many ways, in-  
cluding yoga, meditation, mar-  
tial arts such as T’ai Chi, reading,  
taking classes, or direct ex-  
perimentation in any psychic  
field.

How would you begin? An an-  
cient saying applies here:  
“There is no way to peace; peace  
is the way.” Every woman will  
have her own way to wholeness.  
Many have found theirs, and it is  
time we all begin to seek for  
ourselves the unity and  
wholeness within, including, and  
most especially the awareness  
of our psychic selves. When we  
become whole, we will then  
have the power and the wisdom  
to create our life-vision, to bring  
it into being, to nourish its  
growth, and finally thereupon  
to fulfill our potential as women.
