As others have pointed out,  
BMR is an important part of the  
women’s community. Some  
women are not able to travel to  
hear women speakers and it is  
important that the coverage of  
those events be informative and  
not just personal feelings. (You  
should write an editorial if you  
have such strong feelings.) Or,  

there should at least be more of a  
balance between the personal  
and the “objective”.  

Sincerely,

A post-script to the layout  

person-  

I feel the layout for the J.J. ar-  
ticle was artistically “nice” but a  
waste of space. I'm sure that at  
least 1% - 2 more columns could  
have been fitted on that page. I  
don't think the article was good  
enough to warrant the impor-  
tance given to it by the layout.  

Dear People,  

I am in prison, have no money  
and would love to read your  
paper. Could you turn me on to  
it? Also if you have a letter ex-  
change would you put my name  
on it, for I am also one of the  

forgotten. I really thank you,  
In struggle,  
Love

Dear BMR,  

I was delighted a few months  
ago to discover your magazine.  
As a “local” woman I appreciate  
the possibilities of being printed  
in my own part of the country.  
Best of wishes from Colorado  
Springs!  
Sincerely,  
Linda Bohe  

Dear BMR;  

I read with tremendous in-  
terest the article “A Working  
I was born into a millionaire’s  
household in Germany 52 years  

ago. We were Jewish, so in -  

1939, we fled Hitler with $4 in  
our pockets. We first went to  
England where we lived for a  
year, supported by friends. We  
came to this country in 1940. My  
father - a college professor —  
found a marginal job in research  
which kept us in food and a small  
apartment. I went to college on  
scholarships, gifts and hand-  
me-down clothes. The year after  
I graduated from college, my  
father died of a heart attack after  
a 9 months illness, and my  
mother and I were alone in the  
world. I had a job, but I was ill,  
partly as a result of the German  
experience. From 1945-1950 I  
struggled to keep my job in spite  
of illness, we could not find  
suitable living quarters because  
of the war and because we were  
two women alone, and we often  
were not sure where our next  
meal was coming from.  

In 1950 I started to live with  
the woman who is still my life  
companion. For the first time in  
many years I felt SOME security  
in my surroundings. I was able to  
get help for my emotional condi-  
tion (there were NO social ser-  
vices for that sort of thing at the  
time), and finally my mother  
received some reimbursement  
from the German government.  
Today, I live communally with 3  
other women (more about that  
later), my mother is well-off, but  
does not help me financially, and  
I work full-time for my sisters  
without compensation as a Les-  
bian peer counsellor.  

My experience is unusual, in  
that I experienced both great  
wealth, considerable poverty,  

and now comfortable middle-  
class status. I would like to com-  
ment on the effect it has had on  
me.  

In contrast to the sister who  
wrote the article, I grew up in  
wealth, which meant — among  
other privileges — that I always  
had plentiful and good food, and  
learned to communicate. The  
latter was of little use to me,  
however, since English was a  
foreign language to me when I  
came to this country, and it took  
me many years to be able to use  
it on a mother-tongue level.  
Knowing what CAN be available,  
the total absence of available  
services when dad died was a  
source of terror to us. Even while  
dad was ill, we had no way to pay  
the doctor, who (again — past  
social position was in our favor  
then) told us that he would not  
charge us for his services.  
However, as soon as dad was  
gone, no one was interested in  
our background, and when I  
needed medical help, none was  
available, and no physician or  
therapist offered help for free.  
What therapy I finally received I  
had to pay for out of a meager  
salary. Non-acceptance by  
others never much bothered me —  
so the fact that I did not have  
the “right” clothes, was NOT a  
source of particular pain. I suf-  
fered far more from the fear of  
what would be if I could not con-  
tinue to hold my job — we had  
NO savings, NO money in the  
bank, and lived hand-to-mouth —  
a situation we had, of course,  
never known in the past. Mother  
and I were fucked over by  
landlords, merchants, you-  
name-it, because it was obvious  
that we were two women alone  
and “unprotected”. Employers  
also took advantage of my  
foreign status, and underpaid  
me as a foreigner and a woman.  
My rage was more against the  
impotence of helping myself,  
than against any one single facet  
of my helplessness.  

In 1950, when I met Jinny, I  
furthermore realized that I was a  
Lesbian, and I have no idea how  
much this realization added to  
my development as a woman  
with radical and revolutionary  
attitudes — I was a feminist all of  
my life, however, and being a  
Lesbian probably did more in a  
quantitative than a qualitative  
way.  

After working for somewhat  
more than 10 years with my life-  
companion in a number of jobs  
for various money-grabbing  
large companies, I left my  
profession in 1962, and since  
then have devoted my time to  
working in the radical “move-  
ment” — Black liberation,  
women’s liberation, Lesbian and  
Civil Liberties. Since 1971 my  
life companion and I have lived  
communally — at first with one  
other woman — one of my  
counselees from a working class  
background (her father has 5th  
grade education and works as a  
laborer in the coal-mining area  
of Pennsylvania), and now with a  
second woman, from the coal  
mining area of West Virginia  
(totally accidental) whose  
background is working class,  
with both parents having had  
6th grade education. My life-  
companion comes from a  
ranching background — Iowa  
and Colorado— from a basically  
middle-income family  
background. So, we are a mixed  
group, and find little difficulties  
in getting along with each other.  

In my dealings with the National  
Organization for Women, I find  
their classism probably their  
worst feature. As the  
anonymous author states — we  
cannot have an effective  
women’s movement as long as it  
is composed of middle-class  
white women, who work  
because it is “liberating”, who  
look down on women with un-  
fashionable clothes and dirty  
hands, who cannot tolerate ANY  
differences among themselves  

— be they of color, social class,  
or sexual orientation. I suppose  
that it must be difficult for  
privileged white middle-class  
women to relate to the oppres-  
sion of less privileged peoples,  
but unless they come to terms  
with it, the “movement” will go  
nowhere.  

My own political development  
has led me through sincere  
liberalism, into extreme  
radicalism and revolutionarism.  
We try to be non-consumers as  
much as possible in our com-  
mune, partly because our in-  
come is limited — 2 have a good  
income but pay prohibitive taxes,  
one has a barely marginal in-  
come, and I have none. Having  
lived on both sides of the fence,  
I have SOME appreciation what it  
means to be powerless because  
one is poor. I could never have the  
full appreciation of one who  
grew up with not enough food on  
the table, but Georgette (of our  
commune) has had this ex-  
perience, and thus we have the  
advantage of her experience  
among us.  

The anonymous sister goes  
into details about the cruelty she  
experienced as a child, at the  
hands of other children and their  
parents. This is, I feel, part of the  
capitalistic “ethic” — to look  
down on those who do not have  
money and power, in order to  
destroy both their bodies (insuf-  
ficient food) and their spirits. It is  
deliberate, and the present men  
in power are once again  
demonstrating this tactic, by  
playing the poor and marginal  
income groups against their own  
wealth and status — causing un-  
employment in order to  
safeguard their vast fortunes.  
Also, the “rugged individualism”  
of this country preaches self-  
reliance at the expense of others,  
so middle-class children not only  
see this in the lives of their  
parents, but are also taught early  
on to look out for themselves  
“because no one else will look  
out for you”. I often wondered how  
this was compatible with their  
supposed “Christian ethic”!  

I am delighted that BMR is  
opening the subject of working  
class vs. middle and upper class  
in the women’s movement. I  
hope some good will come out of  
the discussion. I found the  
anonymous sister's account  
much as I had always felt it was  
— though my experience was  
very limited indeed — and I feel  
that she need not have apologiz-  
ed for telling it as it is. Those who  
can be alienated by an account  
such as hers, are not worth hav-  
ing as allies in any event. And  
those who can understand her  
oppression might be helped to  
work WITH working class  
women to a more united and  
more viable women’s move-  
ment. I hope the exchange of  
opinions will continue for a long  
time, and that it will help all of us  
understand each other better.  

In sisterhood,  

Julie Lee  

Dear BMR,  
I think that the main  
reason I’m writing is to  

compliment you and all the  
folks at BMR on the last  
issue. It was really interest-  
ing. I keep the BMR’s in a box  
by the potty to read at  
appropriate moments. I got a  
ring on my fanny that lasted  
for two days from the last  
issue because I read most of it  
in one sitting -- how’s that for  

Love
