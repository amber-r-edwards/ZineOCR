excluded from in high school
and later on in college. And
it was run by mothers. The Boy
Scouts was like a fraternity
and run by fathers. Radine
(the blond girl) and I were
both maturing early. The boys
in the band loved having us
out there in front of them all
the time, bending back and
stepping high, in our snug sa-
tin outfits and short skirts.
Their dads, mostly navy men,
loved it too. At that age I
was too young to consciously
use my sexuality or to under-
stand how an Oriental female
can fascinate Caucasian men,
and of course far too young to
see that this is usually just
another form of invisibility.
I knew intuitively that one
resource I had to overcome the
war-distorted limitations of

my race would be my femininity.

Many years later, in 1966 I
met a Caucasian woman who had
worked for one year as a pho-
tographer at Manzanar. I could
scarcely speak to her. I des-
perately wanted to, but all
my questions stuck in my throat.
This time it was not the
pain of memory. It was simply
her validation that all those
things had taken place. Some-
one outside the close comm-
unity of Japanese Americans
had actually seen the camp,
with its multitude of people
and its swarm of buildings on
the plain between the mount-
ains. Something inside me op-
ened then. I began to talk
about it more and more.

In 1972, thirty years after
her internment, after going to
college, marrying out of her
race and with 3 kids, she went
back to Manzanar with her fam-

ily. The desert had reclaimed
the camp, trees that people
had planted and a small grave-
yard and a few foundations of
buildings still remained. I
had nearly outgrown the shame
and guilt and the sense of un-
worthiness. This visit, this
pilgrimage, made comprehens-
ible finally, the traces that
remained and would always re-
main, like a needle. That ho-
llow ache I carried during the
early months of internment had
shrunk, over the years, to a
tiny sliver of suspicion about
the very person I was. It had
grown so small sometimes I'd
forget it was there. Months
might pass before something
would remind me. When I first
read, in the summer of 1972,
about the pressure Japan's

economy was putting on Amer-
ican business and how a union
in New York City had printed
up posters of an American
Flag with MADE IN JAPAN writ-
ten across it, then the needle
began to jab. I hear Mama's
soft, weary voice from
1945 say "It's all starting
over." I knew it wouldn't. Yet
neither would I have been
surprised to find the FBI at
my door again. I would resist
it much more than my parents
did, but deep within me some-
thing had been prepared for
that. Manzanar would always
live in my nervous system, a
needle with Mama's voice.

I was 13 when World War 2
began and even at that age I
could see the different at-
titudes that the movies show-
ed when it pictured Japanese,
Germans and Italians. Films
about the Japanese were hid-
eously brutal in their char-
acterization of the people,
regardless of their military
rank or if they were civil-
ians--the message was that no
Japanese were our type of hu-
man being. The anger, hatred,
fear of an unknown culture
and ridicule that was pic-
tured on the screen for al-
most four years paved the way
for the atomic bombs. Orient-
als, like Black people, had
always been shown on the
screen as stupid, sly or
comic "creatures"—inscrutable.
But war-time movies changed
that and while the Japanese
were all the bad words, “our
boys" walked around with
halos and showed no prejudice. 
It was devastating to
watch as a white child, to a
Japanese American child it
must have cut through brutally.

To this day, many white Am-
ericans still feel the drop-
ping of the A-bombs were nec-
essary to end the war ...it
saved the lives of American
boys and shortened the war...
The bombs could only have been
dropped on Japan. Too many
white Americans had not only
blood ties to Germany and It-
aly, as well as the captured
European countries, but those
cultures and world treasures
were linked to the Anglo-
heritage and to destroy them
with A-bombs, along with the
people, was unthinkable to
U.S. military and government
leaders. And like little boys
with a new toy, they had to

use it—regardless of what
that meant to the world at la-
rge. Japanese, on the other
hand, were of another race and
Japan had never been shown to
the American public as hav-
ing a culture or art—only un-
til after the war did we learn
about the beauties of Japanese
culture, art, architecture and
history. After the war people
decried the USA's devastation
of Dresden, Germany, a non-
industrial city noted for its
beauty which the US Air Force
bombed almost out of existen-
ce. But seldom was there heard
the same cry for Hiroshima
and Nagasaki except by the
left and the anti-nuke groups
for either the death of a
city or the devastation of
human life.

Today we hear that Japan
has stolen the auto and elec-
tronic industry from the U.S.
BUY AMERICA is the slogan,
no mention is really made in
the straight press that U.S.
imperialism has left the
American worker stranded in
the unemployment lines and
taken their factories to oth-
er countries where they don't
have to fight unions and can
pay any wage that is profit-
able to the corporations as
well as influencing those
countries' political policies.

Racism is again openly mar-
ching. The fallout is not on-
ly how this country views the
Japanese in Japan but how the
Japanese Americans are view-
ed. The Japanese Americans
are being more visible, cases
are in the courts trying to
get recognition for the past
injustices the people have
suffered.

To combat racism, whites
have been repeatedly told to
educate themselves. As fem-
inists it is in our own best
interests to know that we
have to fight racism.

Recently the movie Hito
Hato: Raise the Banner has
been shown on Denver TV. Pro-
duced in Los Angeles, its
story is of an Issei (first
generation) and his life,
ending with his battle of
survival as an elderly man on
a low income. The cast, writ-
ers, technicians etc. is
mostly all Japanese.

In Colorado the Japanese
Americans have the Issei His-
tory Project, 1947 Lawrence
St., Denver 80202. The project
is trying to reach Issei and
families of Issei's for oral
histories which will then be
produced as a book. The Issei
men were usually 10-20 years
older than their wives and
many have died, leaving the
wife to tell the story. Any-
one interested please contact
the project. Similar projects
have been done in San Jose
and San Mateo, CA.
