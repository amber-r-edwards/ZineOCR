ITCAW Testifies Against Patriarchy

Kathleen MacKenzie

On March 4, the first Inter-

national Tribunal on Crimes
against Women (ITCAW) be-
gan in Brussels, Belgium.
Over 2,000 women from 32
countries participated in the
four-day conference, ending
on International Women's
Day.

The idea for an International
Tribunal on Crimes Against
Women was conceived at
Femo, an international femin-
ist camp in Denmark, in
August of 1974. Feminist
workshops and meetings later
that year in Frankfurt and
Paris gave shape to the
Tribunal and a Coordinating
Committee was formed.

Simone de Beauvoir opened
the tribunal with these words:
“Speak to one another, speak
to the world, bring into focus
the shameful truths that half
of humanity tries to mask. In
itself, the tribunal is an act. It
announces many others. I
greet the beginning of a
radical decolonization of wo-
men."

Unlike the International
Women’s Year Conference in
Mexico City last summer, the
Tribunal was organized and
financed by feminists. Ac-

cordingly, the topic of the
Tribunal was the oppression of
women. Women attending
the Tribunal, reports Diana
Russell, a member of the
Coordinating Committee of
ITCAW, came to denounce the
crimes perpetrated against us
by the male-dominated nat-
ions in which we all live, and
develop strategies to combat
these crimes, not to integrate
into these patriarchal societies
as was the case in Mexico.
The countries participating
were Australia, Austria, Bel-
gium, Brazil, Canada, Chile,
Denmark, England, France,
W. Germany, Greece, Holland,
India, Ireland, Israel, Italy,
Japan, Korea, Luxembourg,
Mexico, Norway, Portugal,
Puerto Rico, Saudi Arabia,
Scotland, South Africa, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, Syria,
and the United States.
Crimes about which prepared
testimony was given included
forced motherhood, medical
crimes, economic and legal
crimes, and violence. The two
crimes chosen by the U.S.
Committee were femicide (the
murder of women and girls by
men) and the over-represen-
tation of women in poverty in

Prisoners Protest Behavior

LNS

Over four hundred women
— nearly the entire prison
population of the California
Institute for Women at Fron-
tera, California — have signed
a petition opposing the con-
struction of a behavior modifica-
tion center at Frontera.

The proposed center, known
officially as the Alternative
Prison Unit, was one of many
grievances that sparked off a
prison-wide insurrection at the
California Institute for Women
in which 300 women partici-
pated in December, 1975.

The plan has also run into
opposition at public hearings
recently held by the California
State Assembly.

According to the California
Department of Corrections,
the purpose of the center
would be “to provide more
structure, control and special
program attention for those
residents who have difficulty
adjusting to general rules,
guidelines and expectations at
the prison. The program will
be designed primarily to ac-
commodate residents who rep-
resent a threat to safety,
security and good order of the
institution, if left in the
general population.”

Women identified by the
Department as “disruptive,
with disciplinary problems,
or who have negative influ-
ence on cottage residents”
will be isolated from the rest
of the prison population and
be denied, in part or whole,
visiting, dining hall, canteen,
library and work privileges.”

Once assigned to the Alter-
native Prison Unit, women can
regain the privileges one by
one, by working through
phases according to their
behavior. These women “are
expected to maintain a posi-
tive attitude and a desire to re-
program back into the general
population.”

The petition signed by 405
women prisoners stated, “We
see the Alternative Prison
Unit as a threat to us all in that
we can be isolated arbitrarily
by the police without breaking
any rule.”

The prisoners explain, for
example, that 50 of the 300
women who participated in the
December rebellion were sin-
gled out for felony charges
and were put in isolation for
eight days over the Christmas

Spontaneous testimony cov-
ered some of these crimes and
many more including crimes
in countries not present at the
Tribunal, such as clitoridec-
tomy and the recent decapita-
tion of several women belong-
ing to a harem for attempting
to escape. There were work-
shops on most of the crimes
about which prepared testi-
mony was given.

An International Feminist
Newsletter will be published
every three months from
information collected at ISIS
(cas postal 301-CH1227-Car-
ouge, Geneva, Switzerland).

An International Feminist
Network will be formed to fa-
cilitate the mobilization of wo-
men's movements on an inter-
national scale when such
mobilization could be of help
to sisters in need of such
support in different countries.
The coordinator of this Net-
work is Nicole Van de Ven, 165
Boulevard General Jacques,
1050 Brussels, Belgium.

The proceedings of the Inter-
national Tribunal on Crimes
Against Women will be pub-
lished later this year.

holidays. In addition, the
women say the unit is a par-
ticular threat to prisoners
given an indeterminate sen-
tence, the length of which is
decided by the parole board.
The women opposing the
behavior modification unit em-
phasize that one’s behavior
and attitude are prime con-
siderations of the parole board
when it evaluates prisoners for
parole. Parole Board member

Virginia Lees, for example,
told one prisoner that she
wouldn't be paroled “until she
found Jesus.”

“We want an end to this
unit,” the petition concluded.
“It puts us in double jeopardy
and in triple jeopardy when we
have to face the [parole]
board.”

New York Prostitutes Claim
Sweep Arrests Discriminatory

LNS

New York City’s longtime
policy of conducting “sweep
arrests” of suspected prosti-
tutes was challenged in fede-
ral court March 9, in a class
action suit filed by the Legal
Action Center and the New
York Civil Liberties Union.

“The sole purpose of sweep
arrests,” the complaint alleg-
es, “is to intimidate, harass
and punish women who fre-
quent thoroughfares of Man-
hattan and are suspected of
being prostitutes.” The suit
further charges that the policy
is unconstitutional and dis-
criminates against Black and
Latin women.

The complaint names as
defendants Mayor Abraham
Beame; Michael Codd, Com-
missioner of the New York
Police Department; Sidney
Baumgarten, Assistant to the
Mayor and Chairman of the
Midtown Law Enforcement
Coordinating Committee; the
New York Police Department;

and two police officers.

Under the sweep arrest pol-
icy, Manhattan police make
round-up arrests of “suspic-
ious looking” women solely on
the basis of their “known”
status as prostitutes—not be-
cause of any criminal conduct.
Those arrested are charged
with disorderly conduct and
held for hours—sometimes
overnight—until, lacking evi-

dence for a prosecution, the
District Attorney dismisses all
charges.

Suspected prostitutes are
swept from the streets in this
manner, the suit notes, until
“the number of women col-
lected exceeds the capacity of
the detention facilities.”

Police and public officials
have admitted that sweep
arrests are probably legally
indefensible. Speaking at an
East side community meeting
in October, 1975, defendant
Baumgarten admitted that
“there is no legal way we can
sustain these ‘sweeps’. They
only serve the purpose of
cleaning the streets from
6:00 pm to 2:00 am. If we get
stopped by federal authorities,
we're finished.”

The charge of discrimination
is based on the plaintiffs’
observation that men who are
on the street in search of
prostitutes “are almost invar-
iably let alone,” and similarly,
that men frequenting the
streets to promote prostitution
are not harassed.

The complaint further
charges that the sweep arrest
policy is directed at a group
which is “disproportionately
Black and Hispanic” as com-
pared with the group of men
seeking prostitutes, who are
disproportionately white.

can be directed into some-
thing then you have long term.

BMR: That's a really good
example of how music is a
political tool. Is there anything
else you would like to bring
up?
Relating Struggles

HN: Well, one of the things
that has become more and
more clear to me is I’ve
learned some of this on the
women’s tour, some from the
work I’ve done in the anti-war
movement, some from being
around some just real good
women who have challenged
me and other women—is the
importance of bringing to-
gether anti-imperialist strug-
gle, working against racism,
working against the contra-
dictions of class, and working
against sexism and homo-
phobia. Any one of those
struggles, without being re-
lated to the others, I think
somehow doesn’t fulfill the
requirements. We have to find
some way that women can
focus on one or the other. For
sure, you can have one of
them be a priority but if any
one of them happens in isola-
tion apart from the other,
there is a weak link in there
somewhere. Many women
have come into the women’s
movement out of their own
need for liberation which is
certainly valid, but if they
bring with them the failings of
their past, which might be the
class they come from, if they
come from upper class or
middle class, it may be the
failings of their race if they are
white, if they bring any of
those things which lead to the
kind of patriarchal society
that we live in now, then
somehow feminism is not
taking on the depths that fem-
inism has to have in order to
be complete. It is very, very
difficult to say things to
women who are working in the
anti-imperialist movement,
like, in the anti-war movement
and any kind of global work we
have got to start to understand
that there must be feminist
input, there must be woman
identification in those strug-
gles. There must be support
and consciousness that within
one global struggle or another
there are women and there are
lesbians and there is patri-
archy. Finding some way, you
know, to get an autonomous
women’s movement that in-
cludes all of them I think is a
real challenge to us all. It has
to come from people who are
in a place and a privilege to
have the time to struggle with
those things. I mean you don’t
go to a black woman who is
working in a black community
and say how come you aren’t a
feminist. Why should she
initiate a support group with
white women when white
women have never given black
women support? White wom-
en have to figure out how
they're gonna offer that sup-
port and struggle with their
own racism.
