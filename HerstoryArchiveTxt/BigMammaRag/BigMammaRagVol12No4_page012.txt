gle to end all oppression,
as is the case with Waller
and the illegal APSP?

When are white people go-
ing to stop being so afraid
to take a stand for what you
believe in (especially when
black groups are involved)
without becoming paralyzed
with fear of making a mis-
take? Don’t you think for
yourselves? Right is right
and wrong is wrong, I don't
care who is involved. Just

Waller is in the business
of coming up with great
sounding political theory
and can halfway organize a
quasi political formation,

because

does not mean he is not
capable of beating women and
committing other male-privi-
leged, dominating and ter-
roristic acts. By no means
have black men escaped sex-
ist indoctrination. To re-
sist this indoctrination is
a constant struggle for us
all -- even for conscious
women.

As it regards this being
an "internal struggle;"
this struggle has not been
"internal" since Waller, in
an attempt to maintain un-
principled control of the
APSP apparatus, had the APSP
cut off funds to the natio-
nal office when he learned

claiming that "people have

so-called "independence")

You are certainly correct
when you state that so-called
"internal struggles"
need to be publicized to learn from
them and for ACCOUNTABILITY
-- which is what we are at-
tempting to do by continuing
to publicize Waller's hypo-
crisy. Personally I hate the
thought of him exploiting any-
one else's energy for his
own self-aggrandizement ~-
valuable energy that can be
utilized to find answers to
our continued oppression.

When we tried to make Wal-
ler accountable to the Party,
he used the guilt-tripped
white women of APSC to inter-
vene in the struggle, to be
the first ones to publicly
intimate that we were agents
of the state, and to pri-
marily lead struggle against

that the Central Committee
was treating his brutaliza-
tion like the crime it was
and was preparing for dis-
ciplinary hearings.

Penny Tess, (who along
with others are now masqu-
erading as the Uhuru House
Solidarity Committee), a
supposed "feminist," called
me (I was leading Central
Committee member at the
time) proclaiming that there
was “no way APSC would sup-
port any disciplinary action
against “such a great lead-
er“ and trying to lessen the
criminality of the attack by

those of us who saw a need
to let the movement know
what had happened and espe-
cially to warn other people
who may also be victimized
by Waller in the future. It
was APSC's blind allegiance
to black male leadership
that made it impossible for
the membership to make
Waller accountable. (We see
more and more of these white
organizations, which are pre-
dominantly white women, who
claim to "follow the leader-
ship of the Black Movement” ~~ they mean Black men --

» and creating disruption and

a leap backwards for the
Black Movement.) APSC is a
continuing problem with the
movement learning from Wal-
ler's betrayal of his his-
toric duty. It was through
their money, resources, and
blindly leading the struggle
against us that helped Waller
be able to continue his ex-
ploitation of the movement

I think it is good you are
questioning your responsi-
bilities in dealing with

national liberation struggles.

At the same time I also be-
lieve that white groups have
the responsibility to strug-
gle with each other over
their interventionist stands
against national liberation
movements. I believe that
since APSP firstly made the
issue public and talked about
APSC's role, then it was okay
for other folks to become in-
volved -- at least to the
degree of understanding what
was happening. Seems to
me APSC's motives need to
be questioned: so-called
feminists taking a stand a-
gainst black women, so-called
lesbians participating in
lesbian baiting!, and on top
of that calling us -- the
victims -- agents of the
state -- all in the name of
supporting national libera-
tion. What else can further
the interest of the state
than to attempt to squash
principled struggle?

While I would never advo-
cate white people trying to
make decisions on what's in
black folks' best interest,
you certainly need to try to
do that as it relates to your
involvement with black and
other national liberation
movements, otherwise, as is
often the case, you end up on
the side opposing the inte-
rest of the women in these
movements and ultimately
stifling the movements. You
have to be able to decide
regardless of political ex-
cuses or smokescreens, that
it is wrong for a man to beat
a woman regardless of color
and even worse when the man
makes claims to be pro-woman,
a "great" leader, etc. And
on top of that-- as is the
case with Waller, we were his
"comrades"! .

Seems to me that white fem-
inists and progressives need
to explain how it is that
your comrades (other white
feminists and lesbians) sup-

port an anti-black woman

and lesbian-baiting attack
in the name of "supporting
national liberation," espe-
cially in light of the women

of the organization (APSP)
and the majority of the or-
ganization refusing to? How
can this be justified poli-
tically?

It is my opinion that you
make a mistake when you view
these groups/movements as
composed of homogenous poli-
tical positions, or when you
only accept male views and
leadership. By virtue of wo-
men being in these organi-
zations there will be diver-
gent views and struggle --
it is ours to resolve,
which we can if we are allow-
ed to do so by our own natur-
al process. It is not your
place to be involved in our
internal struggle, but once
that struggle has been opened
up, then I believe it is es-
sential that you take object-
ive looks at what is happen-
ing, especially at the role
so-called progressive whites
are playing.

There are no pat and easy
answers and each struggle
will have to be dealt with
on its own merits, but there
has to be a beginning. There
is already distrust and sus-
picion on the part of black
folks of white "supporters"
anyway, and incidents like
APSC's stand against the
struggle of the Party mem-
bership to make Waller ac-
countable certainly doesn't
help matters. We certainly
are curious about their mot-
ivations. And objectivity is
necessary. I'm sure when the
so-called APSC woman criti-
cized you for not checking
out the charges she certain-
ly didn't mean checking with
me:

which

‘I hope that I've at least

given you more information

and given you something to
think about and to struggle
around. One key means of
support of white progres-
sives is to avoid stifling
and interfering in national
liberation struggles by the
kind of intervention that
APSC was/is responsible for.
Their actions, I believe,
sincerely hampered the strug-

gle of black women to deal with

the sexism in our movement
and community. But the strug-
gle continues and there's no
doubt that justice for black
women will prevail.

In closing, I want to
thank you for having the in-
stinct to print our leaflet
with or without the "infor-
mation;" and relying on your
gut feelings. Usually they
will have you on the right
track. I also appreciate
your honest attempt at prin-
cipled struggle. Keep up the
good work. If you need any
further information, I'd be
happy to oblige.
