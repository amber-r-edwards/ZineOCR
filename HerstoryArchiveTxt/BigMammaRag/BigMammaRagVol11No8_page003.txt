Supporters Needed

Dear BMR:

I am told that your organ-
ization can print ads and
help us find women like our-
selves who would support our
cause. We are trying to find
ways to help women who are
released from prison to have
a place to go, friends to
help. We have a prison news-
letter, but because of lack of
funds and support it's been
hard to keep our project go-
ing, especially since the
prison administration does
not support our goals.

Please could you print the
following ad in Mama Rag.

Underground prison feminist
group needs your help in
finding supporters and spon-
sors for feminists who need
help upon release from pris-
on. We need supporters for
our prison newsletter; any
donations are acceptable.
Please only serious-minded
feminists reply, because of
prison administrative resis-
tance to the feminist cause
please DO NOT MENTION in
your response on donations
that we are a feminist group.
Donations must be in the form
of money orders only, payable
to:

Welfare Woes

Dear BMR:

Just a note to praise Gudrun
Fonfa's poem Welfare Was My
Husband (July-Vol 11-7). This
piece encapsulates four years’
worth of my feeling world,
and I would give her a prize
for a medicinal wallop of
artistry that I pray will
have purged my system of the
social service syndrome for
good.

I got on welfare as soon as
my daughter was born; she is
four years old now and I have
just "given it up" for the
third time. Trying to cure my-
self before, teary farewells
and fuck-you's to case work-
ers, I've always got sucked
right back into the ADC add-
iction, tail between my legs,
whipped, workless and willing
enough to perjure myself to
the hilt once again. There

needs to be a support group
for Ex-Case Numbers like us.

Gudrun Fonfa: and, reading
your web of words tacked on

my wall, I can feel the first
strand of the net that shall
keep me from falling into
those welfare husband's arms
this time around. I fantasize
this support group sitting
around swapping smarmy mem-
ories of how it was on welfare.

I wait for my turn to tell,
say: My Best Experience as a
Case Number was when case
worker 42 took his job and
shoved it after I, falling to
pieces, told him my inches-
thick dossier in his filing
cabinet was chock-full of lies.
I practice patience, say, for
the day I can trade my two
bits on the subject "What I
Would Do Different If I Had
Welfare To Do Over": If I had
welfare to do over, the first
time the question of the
baby's paternity ever popped
its head, I would pertly
fill in the blank: Not App-
licable/Apparent Partheno-
genesis. Oh, if wishes were
horses, I'd stampede the
portals of HRS and ride to
the place where money is Un-
touchable, where waking up to
one's life daily is labor
enough.

Revealed Anger?

Dear BMR:

I'd like to respond direct-
ly to Vivian Mayer, whose
letter appeared in July's
issue:

If it weren't too horrific
an experience to wish on any-
one, I'd like to see you try
getting put in a mental inst-
itution and still have the
gall to plea "Where is the
will to communicate?" Where
was Lisa Vogel and her
group's will to communicate
at Michigan? "What was the
purpose of so much revealed
anger?" you ask. Is anger more
suitable when not revealed? A

lot of us are angry and find

ourselves spitting involunt-
arily whenever the word
"Michigan" is heard. A per-
fectly good word like “fest-
ival" has taken on a brave
new world of connotations,
gut-clenching connotations. I
went to the Michigan Festival
once (May the Goddess strike
me dead). The whole intent of
the gathering, supposedly is
to let womyn's spirits soar:
take off your clothes, run,
sing, shout...Just not on

the stage, if you please, for
that is reserved for our
superstars, our money in the
bank. Better that one should
be tipped off at the ticket

booth:
Sister, but tell it like we
want to hear it, and for
Chris' sake, speak English."
And you ask, “What do you

want to accomplish?" I, for
one, would like to see a pub-
lished letter from the Fest-
ival Board of Directors con-
fessing that we are all can-
didates for psychotic cages
if any least one of us is.
You say if you'd received such
a blast of pure hatred you'd
run away screaming. Don't do
that: you might get locked up.
You say you'd run so far that
the movement would never hear
from you again. (Now that may
not be such a bad idea...) Of
course, there's always the
option of deciding to be made
of stronger stuff. Not the
stronger stuff of your idols,
but the stronger stuff of
Everywoman and her pedestrian
truth. Strong enough to re-
cuperate from being "sad, sick
and scared" to being remorse-
ful, rectified and resolved.

In closing, Lori Bradford,
this is for you: Thanks for a
right-on response to Lisa
Vogel. Your consistently art-
iculate articles make me glad,
gutsy, and grateful.

In shithead schizophrenic
sisterhood, I'm sure
