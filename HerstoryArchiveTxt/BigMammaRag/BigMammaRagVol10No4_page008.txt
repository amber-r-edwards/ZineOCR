The celebration of Interna-  
tional Women's Day this year  
may not, on the surface, ap-  
pear to be directly related to  
the momentous events in Poland,  
on which the eyes of the en-  
tire world are focused. Yet it  

is precisely the revolutionary  
activity of the Polish women that  
both illuminates the depth and  
power of Solidarnosc as a  
movement striving to achieve a  
whole new society of "Bread and  
Freedom"—and, at the same time,  
reveals contradictions that need  
to be faced by calling into  
question whether these women  
have been recognized as the  
great revolutionary force they  
are. Indeed, none have focused on  
the women. Yet they have been  
crucial to the struggle from  
the very beginning, and remain  
so in the unyielding resistance  
to the counter-revolution that  
began the moment martial law  
was declared. The general  
strike in the Lenin Steelworks  
Plant in Cracow at the end of  
December was led by Andrzej  
Chudaszek and Halina Bortnow-  
ska—and that it was carried  
through to the end was attri-  
buted mainly to her. At the  
Wujek mine in Silesia, where  
one of the bloodiest confronta-  
tions occurred, the miners  
had been given an ultimatum to  
vacate the mine in one hour.  
Women immediately blocked the  
way, some lying down in front  
of the advancing army tanks.  
When they were swept away by a  
water cannon, other women pic-  
ked up tear-gas grenades and  
threw them back at the police.  
In Gdansk, 3,000 women armed  
with flowers and Solidarity  
bulletins faced the tanks ready  
to crush the Lenin Shipyard  
gates. In Katowice, women blo-  
cked the way outside the occu-  
pied steel mill. And in the  
underground, Alina Pienkowska  
and Joanna Duda-Gwiazda remain  
among the leading activists,  
calling for continued resis-  
tance and describing events in  
the detention camps—such as  
the hunger strike of Anna  
Walentynowicz. (The Washington  

Post, Jan. 17, 1982, has an eye-  
witness report of the events  
at the Wujek mine. For a de-  
scription of the most recent  
events in Poland, which also  
brings out the new forms of  
resistance, see “Counter-rev-  
olution drives the revolution  
underground; the resistance  
continues" by Raya Dunayevsk-  
aya, News & Letters, Jan.-Feb,  
1982.)  

If we follow the dialectic  
of the events, we will see  
that, from the beginning of the  
movement, it is not only as  
sparkplug or as leader, but as  
masses in motion that the wom-  
en have been integral to this  
revolution—both as workers  
and intellectuals, and both as

Joanna Duda-Gwiazda immed-  
iately started organizing  
support for strikers from  
people around the city: fina-  
ncial help, food, blankets,  
distribution of information.  
In a textile town, the first  
act of solidarity was organ-  
izing help for the many sin-  
gle mothers, taking care of  
children while the women were  
striking, recognizing finan-  
cial difficulties of single  

mothers and organizing mater-  
ial help, establishing co-op-  
eratives of women taking  
turns standing in store lines.  
In the universal demands  
formulated in Gdansk, not  
only did the workers demand  
the right to organize free  
trade unions, the right to  
strike, the end of censorship  
and freeing political prison-  
ers, but also included better  
working conditions for health  
personnel (almost all women)  
as a way of assuring full  
medical care for everyone, ad-  
equate space in day-care cen-  
ters and kindergartens, and  
the institution of three  
years paid maternity leave.  
These demands echoed across  
the country, and often were  
expanded upon. In Swidnik,  
women demanded that the water  
pressure be increased so that  
water would reach up to the  

fourth floor (it currently  
stopped at the third floor).  
In another small town they  
demanded that the railroad  
schedule be changed to acco-  
modate shift changes in the  
factory so they wouldn't  
have to wait more than an  
hour for the train. Outraged  
women not only exposed cor-  
rupt party officials and de-  
manded their punishment, but  
also took over their villas  
for day-care centers. They  
challenged the spread of pol-  
lution in the cities, and  
questioned why day-care cen-  
ters and schools were placed  
next to the factories produ-  
cing toxic wastes.

Polish Women Shipyard Workers, Gdansk  

Force and as Reason,  

The birth of Solidarity in  
1980 was sparked by a strike  
at the Gdansk shipyards over  
the firing of Anna Walentyno-  
wicz, a crane operator who,  
each year, had placed a wreath  
at the gates where the workers  
were killed in the 1970 revolt.  
Throughout the course of the  
Gdansk strike which created  
Solidarity, women took part in  
all the activities.  

Alina Pienkowska "thought  
of everything. She got the  
rubber stamp, issued passes,  
collected food from people,  
opened a place to accept gifts  
and made sure the Strike Com-  
mittee had access to the bro-  
adcasting center. In a word,  
she took care of the adminis-  
tration of the strike"

working out one of Solidari-  
ty's most urgent questions:  
the form of its own organiza-  
tion. The concept is now  
known as “horizontal solidar-  
ity," and includes all emplo-  
yees from a particular geo-  
graphic area. The first known  
instance of horizontal soli-  
darity happened in Swidnik  
where the women health workers  
in the local clinic took their  
demands to the helicopter  
factory workers saying: "Since  
we're too small to strike—  
and those who would suffer  
the most are the patients—  
include our demands with  
yours." The workers did, and  
in the process discovered  
that there are a lot of issu-  
es people raise which affect  
more than just a particular  
plant. Thus horizontal soli-  
darity was a way of ensuring  
that the whole of society was
