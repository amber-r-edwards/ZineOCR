Rita Silk  

Rita Silk (Nauni) is a  
Lakota Sioux woman who was  
convicted in Oklahoma of  
first degree manslaughter  
and attempted murder. While  
attempting to defend her son  
from assault by 2 police, she  
shot and killed one and  
wounded the other. She was  
sentenced to 150 years by her  
trial judge, Cannon, who  
stated, "If it were up to me,  
I'd give her more." Judge  
Cannon has been disqualified  
from the case for violating  
the judicial Canon of Ethics.  
The defense has moved for a  
new trial on the basis of 36  
errors in the first trial.  
Rita was released from prison  
on $100,000 bond on April 30,  
awaiting her appeal.  

Due to harassment, threats  
on her life and the stress of  
being labeled a "convicted  
murderer," Rita Silk had a  
mental breakdown in the be-  
ginning of September. She is  
now back in the custody of  

ries an automatic life sen-  
tence, with no possibility  
of parole. Juanita, a black  
woman with five children, was  
convicted by an all white  
jury. She is in prison in  
Michigan, pending appeal of  
her case. She now has a diffs  
erent lawyer, as the state  
attorney who originally hand-  
led her case, really mis-  
handled it.

Each of these cases is an  
example of the injustice of  
the American justice system.  
The 2 black women and 1 Na-  
tive American woman had al-  
most no chance of a fair,  
unbiased trial in this racist,  
sexist society. White peoples’  
standard of living is main-  
tained on the backs of women  
and people of color, both  
within and outside of U.S.  
borders. Women of color are  
especially objects of use and  
abuse and have no right to  
defend themselves or their  
children, according to this  
judicial system. Support and  
pressure from many organiza-  
tions and individuals won  
Dessie Woods her freedom -  
we can do the same for Juanita  
Thomas and Rita Silk.  

Here is an old tired gay  
bar scene...very tired. You  
hear more womyn called 'man'  
than men called 'men.' I  
mean if you're a dyke then  
you must want to be a man,  
right? And besides most womyn  
do relate to men on the  
street & are only looking for  
a substitute. Of course dykes  
don't have to let other womyn  
do this to them but it's so  
much more easy & perhaps pro-  
fitable to do so. We are even  
still so fucked over that  
some of us have yet to real-  
ize that we really ain't sub-  
stitute men. So they call us  
bull daggers...whatever in  
the fuck that means...& we  
answer cuz we know who they  
talking to. Sometimes we  
question the term & sometimes  
we talk about all this shit  
& we always say we understand  
but then we don't do shit  
about it. After all we'll be  
back on the streets in a lit-  
tle while so we'll just do  
what they want us to do to  
get over while we're here...  
forget today...It is a mean  
problem. But, if we don't  
deal with today how can we  
ever hope to have a better  
tomorrow??  

Somewhere between 70-80  
percent of womyn here are  
womyn of color - mostly  
Black. At least 50 percent of  
staff are male & overwhelm-  
ingly white. All sorts of in-  
cidents occur subtly & not  
so subtly to remind us all of  
our positions in this game  
of doing time. The lone white  
womon on a bus of new admis-  
sions is the only one staff  

quicksilver  

White womyn are usually the  
ones who get financial sup-  
port from the street. This  
financial security allows  
one to work at lesser paying  
jobs which often mean lesser  
hassle jobs. No prisoner here  
makes much over $100 in any  
month out of which she must  
buy cigarettes, cosmetics,  
tampax, toiletries, food  
items & attempt to support  
her children. The jobs are  
very traditional: garment  
factory, ADP (keypunch),  

DDR (kitchen), hospital,  
clerical & small mechanical  
crews (plumbers, electricians,  
etc.). Education is also pre-  
dictable: ABE, GED, cooking,  
sewing, cosmetology, secre-  
tarial skills, a couple of  
college classes that WE PAY  
FOR & limited apprenticeship  
programs in mechanical areas.

outlet since art programs
