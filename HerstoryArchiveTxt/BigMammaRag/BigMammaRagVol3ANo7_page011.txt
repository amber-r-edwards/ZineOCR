2,000 Women Attend

Socialist-Feminist
Conference Disrupted

Kim Womantree

Over the weekend of July 4, 5,
and 6, more than 1500 hard-line
socialists, lesbian separatists,
Marxist-Leninists, anarchists,
feminists, workplace organizers,
communist sympathizers,
witches, agents, and assorted
agitators descended upon An-
tioch College in Yellow Springs,
Ohio, for the expressed purpose
of having a Socialist Feminist
Conference.

Limiting the Conference

Nobody really expected the
conference to be as massive as it
was. Limiting of attendance and
restructuring of format was
done in late June. On or before
July 3, several hundred women
were turned away. Some, who
had traveled thousands of miles
and learned of the limiting too
late, hung around although they
were not officially conferees. A
strange class division was
created — women with
nametags and women without.
Tensions and bad feelings were
mounting when, on Saturday
morning, registration was
thrown open to everyone on the
site, including members of sec-
tarian groups previously banned
from the conference. The
problem, then, was to provide a
chance to really discuss their
theory and practice, to share
skills and experiences.

The Set-Up

To help solve this problem,
conference activities were
scheduled on two time shifts and
divided into four formats. Panels
gave presentations on socialist
theory and the economy to the
conference as a whole. There were
many small special interest workshops on
everything from witchcraft to
waitress organizing. Time was
set aside also for playing, sing-
ing, dancing and having fun.
Many good films were shown,
many fine poets, musicians,
dancers, and actresses brought
energy and joy to the conference
in their women’s cultural
presentations. Also, third world,
lesbian, Marxist-Leninist, older
and Jewish women caucused
separately.

The sense of the Berkeley
Oakland Women’s Union collec-
tive statement on class analysis
is that society is controlled by a
ruling class that exploits work-
ing people. This working class, in
order to get their needs met,
must overthrow the ruling class
and set up new systems of
production and government that
meet human needs instead of
production quotas and profit
margins. This is pretty much
traditional socialist theory, ex-
cept that “working class” is
defined as including
housewives, welfare mothers,
those on unemployment and
social security income. Barbara
Ehrenreich calls for a
“totalistic” approach to revolu-
tion. “We know,” she says, “that
transforming ourselves and our
personal relationships is part of
the revolution.” Many orthodox
Marxists call this “bourgeois
thinking”; transforming
ourselves can wait until after the
revolution. Ehrenreich rejects
this stageist belief. She
emphasized, however, that
“personal solutions,” alternative
lifestyles, working out
relationships with one woman
or man, is not enough either.
Our central task, she says, is to
unify the working class as
revolutionaries, and to unify
ourselves as women and in-
crease our own class con-
sciousness. “We have collective
problems,” she says, “and we
must work on collective
solutions to our social ills.”

Racism and You

The panel of third world
women brought out some issues
that needed airing. One of these
was the difference in how most
third world women and most
feminists see the family. One
Puerto Rican woman said that
the family was essential to the
cultural and economic survival
of her people. Other Black and
Chicana women agreed with
that statement. The lesbian
caucus debated this for a long
time. In partial reply, their state-
ment said, “Many lesbians
cannot accept the family for
ourselves and do not see it as an
option open to us. Yet we
recognize that the family has
served as a haven for the people
of many oppressed groups. But
we must reevaluate alternatives
to this haven and the reasons
why it is the only option for many
women.”

A criticism of the conference,
voiced by members of the panel,
was that there were so few third
world and working class white
women at the conference (100,
maybe, out of 1500). A proposal
was made and adopted by
several groups to raise funds for
the next conference to allow
women who otherwise could not
afford it to come.

On what basis can third world
women and white socialist-
feminists make an alliance? Said
one panelist, “We will be allies
not because you pay lip service
to our struggles but because we
see you fighting side-by-side with
us on issues of importance to our
lives.” Some of these issues: day
care, welfare rights, school
bussing, and forced sterilization.
Of this a New York community
organizer, Helen Rodriguez,
said, “When you hear a lot about
population control, ask yourself
who is the population that has to
be controlled?”

One panelist said that the
“International Women’s Con-
ference in Mexico is a mirror
image of our own struggles,”
and added that women’s libera-
tion issues are different for
women in third world countries.
Since over ¾ of the women in
the world live in third world
countries, it would be wise to
pay attention to these
differences. Equal pay for equal
work is not quite the issue
when your man is only earning
ten cents a day in a U.S. factory,
and free abortion on demand is
not an issue that Puerto Rican
women are going to mobilize
around while many of them are
being forcibly sterilized by U.S.
foundations.

The women on the lesbianism
panel talked about being in the
closet, about their dissatisfac-
tions with the conference,
heterosexuality as an oppressive
institution, outreach and
organizing for “non-political”
lesbians, and lesbianism as a
revolutionary force. Lesbian
mothers, like poor and third
world mothers, often get their
children taken away from them.
Some criticisms of the con-
ference: too much talk about
ruling class and capitalism, not
enough discussion about how
patriarchy and heterosexuality
oppress women. As Charlotte
Bunch says, “It is not okay to be
queer in patriarchy and the last
thing we want to do is to make it
okay.”

When a panelist said, in essence, “Keep on trucking,” the hall of 600
women went wild with delight,
cheering, whistling, and clap-
ping for about five minutes. That
was the first time I got a sense of
what ‘International Solidarity’
means. The victory of the Viet-
namese people was in a real
sense a personal victory for
these women, because they had
worked hard for it, organizing,
marching, and leafletting for
years. It is an inspiring example
that the American machine can
be challenged and that we
are strong enough.

Unfortunately, many of the
same folks who cheered so
loudly in support of these
faraway sisters, booed and hissed
when women in the same
country and movement, sup-
posedly fighting the same
enemy with the same basic end
goals, came out with statements
that were considered “counter-
revolutionary,” “bourgeois,” or,
worst of all, “reformist” by
Marxist-Leninist standards. I
played with the idea that the
hissers and booers were CIA
agents whose job was to disrupt
and divide us, but I came sadly to
the conclusion that they were
just ordinary political women
who had been hanging around a
lot of male radicals and had
picked up on rhetoric, shouting,
haranguing and trying to con-
vince people that they have the
most perfect and pure analysis,
the strategy, to lead the working
class to revolution, as the only
way of making themselves
heard. I felt intimidated and
alienated, and I think a lot of
other women did too.

Strength In Diversity

A large part of the alienation,
confusion and chaos of the
conference came from the fact
that there were 1500 very
diverse women at the con-
ference trying to form an in-
tegrated theory of revolution, a
synthesis of socialism and
feminism, in three days. I believe
our diversity can be our strength,
if we can recognize that we have
different life experiences and
experience our oppression in
different ways, and that our
priorities and our strategies
must be different, though coor-
dinated, cooperative, and
simultaneous. Many of us here,
both lesbian and heterosexual,
came to the conference out of the
conviction that the time has
come to develop a synthesis of
socialism and feminism. We
came to find a place of reason
somewhere between Lesbian
Nation and the Revolutionary
Union. We came because we
feel deeply critical of a socialism
