Strip Search By Thornton Police

Vicki Piotter

What started out as a routine
arrest on a misdemeanor traffic
violation turned out to be "the
most humiliating experience of my
life" for Mildred Gibbs last month,
at the hands of the Thornton Police
Department. Gibbs, a Thornton res-
ident, was arrested February 10th,
and taken to the Thornton Police
Station by Patrolman John Bevel for
not having a permit to drive her
rented car. Already upset over
the rough treatment she received
from Bevel when he slammed her
against the hood of her car as he
handcuffed her during the arrest,
Mildred Gibbs was shocked to
learn that Bevel ordered Gail Skuckes,
a civilian dispatcher, to strip-
search her once she was behind bars.

"A policeman watched through the
jail cell window while she (the
dispatcher) took my clothes off me
and made the search," said Gibbs, who
was further outraged. "To be search-
ed is humiliating enough. Not only
was I watched, but I was threatened
with having male officers take over
if I didn't keep quiet and quit pro-
testing."

Feminism

Since the incident, Mildred Gibbs
has announced she will not “keep
quiet" and intends to take her case
as far as it will go in the courts.
This is not the first time in Denver
that women have brought suit against
police for their abuse of women once
they are in custody. In October of
1977, three women, Arlene Irlando,
Michele Hobart, and Margie Stewart
won a civil suit against Jefferson
County as the result of their treat-
ment by law officers after they were
arrested at a United Farm Workers
picket in 1974. The women had been
arrested for violating an injunction
against picketing Applejack Liquors
for selling Gallo wine. Upon arrival
at the police station, the three
women were thrown in solitary cells
and held down by male guards while a
matron searched their body cavities.
While the three women were glad for
the victory, Arlene Irlando made the
comment at the time their suit was
won, "It was no victory that most of
the blame was put on the matrons.
The blame should have fallen on the
higher-ups."

One strip search case that the
higher-ups worried about broke open
last summer after one victim came for-
ward to press charges. As a result
of her refusal to keep silent, the

An Analysis

Judy Barlow, Lori Bradford, Bobbe Ross

Radical (from Latin, radix, mean-
ing root, one who goes to the root of
things) feminists must vehemently
oppose the draft, develop a politi-
cal analysis around this issue, and
present that position whenever poss-
ible. We must examine all of the
alternatives to induction and decide
on an appropriate response.

In the past the Selective Service
has been used in a classist and racist
manner. There are only four alter-
natives to induction once a Selective
Service Act is passed: 1) obtaining
conscientious objector (CO) status or
deferment, 2) leaving the country to
evade the draft, 3) living underground
in this country while trying to evade
authorities, and 4) going to prison
for refusing to register or be draft-
ed.

Points Of Unity

1) We oppose the draft for all people, women and men.
We oppose the draft because it is racist.
Those killed in Viet Nam were minority men.
We see Carter's current push to register women as a cynical attempt to
kill two birds with one stone:
"equal representation," and stir up so much controversy over drafting women that people
forget the real issue--whether drafting anyone is right or necessary.
2) We will not prepare for or fight a war to protect the interests of the
multinational corporations.
Registration is a preparation for the draft which is a preparation for war.
We will not fight to protect oil fields overseas.
3) Our priorities are on feminist issues.
Why should we go overseas to fight when there is a war against us here?
4) We will see the draft as a feminist issue.

the sons of
middle and
upper class
families
were able to
obtain mili-
tary deferr-
ments. Most
of these
successful
draft evaders
had the money
available to
them to at-
tend college,
thus getting
educational
deferments.
Others had
the money and influence to obtain CO
status. If these methods failed, they
had the money to leave the country
to evade the draft. During Viet Nam
many sons of privileged families fled
to Canada. How many sons of working
class or poor families could afford
any of these alternatives? CO status,
educational deferments, and leaving
the country all have one thing in
common--it takes money and/or influ-
ence to pull it off. These alternatives
are classist and/or racist in
that they are only available to a
privileged few.

In order to obtain CO status, poten-
tial draftees must fill out forms ex-
plaining their moral opposition to
military service and to all war. It
is ultimately necessary to have public
officials, clergy, or other prominent
citizens testify that the candidate
for CO status is in some way unable
to serve in the military because of
strong moral convictions. In a
capitalist society such as ours, the
moral convictions of those with
money and power are seen as being
more valid and important than the con-
victions of poor or working class
people. Because our society is rac-
ist, Blacks, Chicanos, Puerto Ricans,
Native Americans, and other minorities
are at a disadvantage financially and
politically when it comes to proving
a moral conviction that would grant
them CO status.

Minority men have the added pressure
of having to prove just how patriotic
and masculine they are. In times of
war minorities have been challenged
to prove their patriotism not only
by complying with the Selective Ser-
vice, but also by being encouraged to
enlist in the military. They are
given the “opportunity” to prove that
they are truly patriotic Americans.
Many Black soldiers have returned
from war only to be lynched in the
name of the democracy they fought to
protect. In other words, those who
are most oppressed and have the least
to lose in the advent of the overthrow
of the present government are tricked
and coerced into putting their lives
on the line to protect the system that
oppresses them, while their white
brothers are buying their way out of
military service.

Opting for CO status is a classist/
racist alternative. Even if massive
outreach was done to encourage minor-
ities and poor and working class peo-
ple to file for CO status, the system
itself would continue to be racist
and classist. As long as the society
itself is classist and racist the
enforcement of its laws will continue
to be done in a classist and racist
manner. No amount of reformist
activity will change this.

Leaving the country to evade the
draft is not a viable alternative
for many people. Eighteen to 20-year-
olds without job skills or money or
the means to get them will not bene-
fit much by leaving the country. This
alternative is also beneficial for
only a privileged few.

The other alternatives of either
going underground and evading auth-
orities or going to jail are the only
real choices that radicals have. To
do otherwise would only serve to re-
enforce the racism and classism in-
herent in the other alternatives.
