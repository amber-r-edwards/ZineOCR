make the deadline for this issue.

Women in Transition (WIT) is  
keeping on keeping on. New  
staff members (Barbara and  
Karen) have taken over respon-  
sibilities at WIT, together with  
several other volunteers.  
However, WIT desperately  
needs community support to pay  
for phone bills, food for women  
and children without resources,  
etc. WIT also needs more  
volunteers. If you are interested  
in working at WIT, call Mona  
(433-8127). For those readers  
who are not familiar with the  
work of the WIT house, it is a pro-  
ject that provides concrete help  
to women who are attempting to  
change their lives. The house  
receives up to 40 phone calls a  
day from Denver women seeking  
help, and provides temporary  
residence for anywhere from 2  
to 20 women and children at a  
time. Kathy Disilets, who is leav-  
ing for Oregon soon, has been  
staffing the house almost entire-  
ly on her own for the past several  
months. BMR salutes her for the  
important work she has been do-  
ing in Denver, and wishes her  
much happiness in Oregon.  

BMR is looking for the artist who  
drew the “Creating the Un-  
iverse” graphic in our May issue.  
We would like to give you credit  
for your work and discuss a  
future project with you. Please  
contact us at 322-2010.  

Life in this society being, at  
best, an utter bore and no aspect  
of society being at all relevant to  
women, there remains to  
civic-minded, responsible,  
thrill-seeking females only to  
overthrow the government,  
eliminate the money system,  
institute couple automation and  
destroy the male sex. — Valerie  
Solanas, Scum Manifesto.
