. . . AND HERE’S TO YOU, MRS. ROBERTSON

:

My first response to Mrs.  
Robertson's article is anger  
mixed with a little sadness, too,  
that another woman would write  
such a sugar-coated, dogmatic,  
sentimentalized, and destructive  
guide to how other women should  
define their existence.

I am a doctor's wife. I do not  
consider it a "career" to be  
one. It is a relationship that  
I have with another person who  
happens to be a doctor. As a  
separate individual with my own  
needs, (to grow, to be dedicated,  
to contribute to the community),  
I resent anyone telling me to de-  
fine myself in terms of another  
person and his needs. Mrs.  
Robertson says that I must "make  
an adjustment" to my husband and  
the life he has chosen, and that  
that "adjustment" will determine  
the kind of life I will lead.

No, thank you, Mrs. Robertson.  
I have my own needs, my own life  
to choose and to create; my life  

is not a series of adjustments in  
my husband's direction. Rather I  
see our life, ideally, as an e-  
qual experience of sharing—of  
giving and taking, and part of  
that sharing is the protesting to-  
gether the medical system that  
denies my being a person in my  
own right and denies my husband  
the same thing.

The medical power structure  
has set it up so that a doctor is  
considered “public property.”

The conflict that the individual  
doctor feels between his public  
life and his private needs stems  
from the irresponsible attitude  
of the medical profession which  
maintains a shortage of doctors  
and a hierarchical structure of  
roles within the medical system  
in its own interest. By mini-  
mizing its responsibility to the  
community, the medical profes-  
sion puts the responsibility on  
the individual doctor who feels  
isolated in this conflict and  
powerless to resolve it. This  
idea that a doctor is public prop-  
erty is part of the mystification  
of what a doctor is—that doesn't  
allow him feelings in dealing  
with his profession, or the choice  
of making his private life as im-  
portant to him as his public life,  
or allow him to make a mistake,  

to admit uncertainty, to deal in  
a human way with the human beings  
he is serving.

Mrs. Robertson, you give me  
three "qualifications for being  
a good doctor's wife." Unself-  
ishness is the first one. Like  
most women, I have been raised  
to be unselfish—to put others'  
needs before my own. I have  
found that it is not a virtue to  
be unselfish at all times, es-  
pecially around this issue of  
being a doctor's wife. It is this  
"unselfishness" that separates  
women who are doctor's wives and  

keeps them from openly sharing  
the pain they experience because  
they and their husbands have been  
indoctrinated into thinking, as  
you say, that “whether you like  
it or not, he belongs first to  
his profession." No. He belongs  
first to himself and he can de-  
termine the priorities in his own  
life. By accepting this defini-  

tion of medicine being a doctor's  
entire life, we cannot trust our  
own feelings and protest when our  
husbands, as interns and resi-  
dents, are forced to work 100 out  
of 168 hours in a week—when we  
see them exhausted physically and  
emotionally by the pressures of  
work—or when they have invested  
so much time and energy into their  
work that they lose interest in  
other people or even in question-  
ing the very system which is de-  
humanizing them. Perhaps this is  
why so many doctors are seen as  
cold, uncaring, unable to deal  
with their own faults and feel-  
ings. It must be hell to be ex-  
pected to be perfect, dedicated,  
to play God, when you know in-  
side that you are only a human  
being like everyone else.

I want to join with other  
people (doctor's wives, doctors,  
students, other health profession-  
als, etc.) in demanding that a  
doctor's training be a human ex-  
perience—that he and I be given  
time and space to grow in the  
directions we choose for our-  
selves, and have the right to de-  
fine for ourselves what is im-  
portant in our lives at any given  
time. .

Mrs. Robertson, you say I must  
also be "patient" to qualify as  
a "good" doctor's wife. . I am  
patient with my children; I am  
also aware of my impatience with  
them, an impatience which stems  
from knowing that I carry most of  
the responsibility for raising  
them. But I will not lie to them.  
I will not tell them that it is  
my husband's "dedication to do  
good" for others which keeps him  
away from them, when I know he  
would rather be sharing his life  
more fully with them—knowing  
them as I know them. I will  
teach them to be impatient with  
the system that makes too many  
demands on their father's time  
and energy. That denies him his  
own needs as a human being. The  
justification for overworking  
doctors is that there is a short-  
age of doctors. True, there is  

a shortage of doctors, but it is  
the medical power hierarchy which  
maintains and encourages that  
shortage in its own interests.

I will also teach my children  
that.

Third, Mrs. Robertson, you say  
that I must be self-reliant.

Part of the strength of being  
self-reliant is knowing what your  
limits are, where your resent-  
ments begin, and what you need as  
a person. I will not "discipline  
my emotions" as you suggest, ac-  
cepting without question the role  
of a doctor's wife. I will trust  
my emotions as good indicators of  
what is wrong with the expecta-  
tions that are being made of me.  
Any rebelling against these ex-  
pectations and the system that  
created them, I consider a sign  
of mental health.

I would like to rewrite your  
last paragraph: As a person in  
my own right, my first responsi-  
bility is to myself—to under-  
standing and dealing with my own  
needs and feelings. Only after  
that can I deal honestly with  

anyone else. I will rebel a-  
gainst the structure of the medi-  
cal profession which denies both  
my husband and myself the possi-  
bility of defining ourselves and  
creating our own lives. I see  
my role as a doctor's wife in  
supporting and getting support  
from my husband against that sys-  
tem. What more could I ask than  
to be my own person first, and to  
share that with the people  
closest to me?
