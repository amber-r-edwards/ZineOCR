Demonstration At California Shock Shop

(Edited from Grassroots/
Berkeley's Community Newspaper)

On Wed. Nov. 4, fifty mem-
bers of the Network Against
Psychiatric Assault (NAPA)
demonstrated in front of Her-
rick Hospital in Berkeley, CA
to protest the use of electro-
convulsive treatment (ECT) at
that hospital. Although most
of the shock treatments ad-
ministered there are “volun-
tary," NAPA believes that

what lightbulb. The result

is a grand mal convulsion id-
entical to an “epileptic fit."
The recommended number of
treatments for people labeled
depressed is 6 to 12 and for
those labeled schizophrenic
15 to 35. Many patients have
more than one series perfor-
med on them.

What does it feel like to
have shock treatment? Here's
a statement written by one of
the participants in Wednes-
day's demonstration, Janet
Frame: There is no escape.

psychiatric assault

Patients on a locked ward are
in an inherently coercive sit-
uation, where free choice is
not possible. In addition,
NAPA claims that the prospec-
tive recipients are not fully
informed of the very destruc-
tive effects of the treatments
including permanent brain da-
mage and memory loss.

According to the latest
statistics from the Californ-
ia Dept. of Mental Health, on
the average someone is shocked
at Herrick every 18 hours
and 40 minutes. Herrick gives
more shock treatments than
any other institution in the
East Bay.

The use of ECT was origina-
ted by Ugo Cerletti in Italy
in 1938, when Mussolini was
in power. According to Cer-
letti's journals, he observed
that hogs being taken to
the slaughter were first giv-
en an electric shock through
the temples. They fell uncon-
scious and were shaken by
convulsions. While in this
state of epileptic coma, they
did not resist having their
throats slit. Cerletti's
first human victim was a va-
grant who had been arrested
for riding the train with-
out a ticket. After the first
shock of 80 volts, the va-
grant, who until then had
been incoherent, said clearly
"Not another one! It's dead-
ly!" Although Cerletti's col-
leagues urged him to discon-
tinue his experiments, he ig-
nored them, applying 13 “treat-
ments" in all to this ori-
ginal victim, at even higher
voltages.

Today a usual shock treat-
ment ranges from 70 to 150
volts, with a current of 500
to 900 milliamperes, about
the power consumed by a 100-

Soon it will be time for ECT
---At the last minute there
is a final outbreak of scream-
ing and panicking... (After
the shock treatment) I rise
disembodied from the dark to
grasp and attach myself like
a homeless parasite to the
shape of my identity and its
position in space and time.
At first I cannot find my way.
I cannot find myself where I
left myself, someone has re-
moved all trace of me. I am
crying.

Although most hospitals now
use a sleep-inducing barbitu-
ate and a muscle-paralyzing
agent such as Anectine to su-
press the outward symptoms of
the convulsion, a Berkeley
neurologist, John Frieberg,
says; "These 'improvements'
are like the flowers planted
at Buchenwald... The muscle
paralyzer can cause prolonged
failure to breathe and cardi-
ac shock. The paralysis may
also intensify the horror of
the patient's experience...
While barbiturates make for a
smoother trip into unconscio-
usness, they also increase
the chance of death by cho-
king. Although they do not pro-
duce sleep, they do not bring
a complete loss of feeling."

One woman, Georgia, reported:
The shots were even more fri-
ghtening. They stop your
breathing, and the last tho-
ught I had before passing out
no matter how many times I
had it, was that this was the
end...the ultimate in torture."
Who receives shock treat-
ment? According to statistics
from the Cal. Dept. of Mental
Health, two thirds of those
receiving ECT are women. As
with other brain-damaging psy-
chiatric treatments (such as
lobotomy and the use of power-

ful phenothiazine drugs), wo-
men are the primary victims
because the resulting passive
state (some call it vegetable-
like) is seen as particularly
desirable for women who are
rebelling against or failing
to live up to culturally de-
fined roles. Most people re-
ceiving ECT are middle-aged
housewives, but according to
Bay Area authors, Alan Sche-
flin and Edward Opton, black
people also receive a dispro-
portionate amount. (See The
Mind Manipulators, Paddington
Press, 1978).

While Herrick's press re-
lease at the demonstration
claims that shock treatment
prevents suicide, NAPA main-

tains that the number of peo-
ple who commit suicide follow-

ing shock treatment is quite
high. The poet Sylvia Plath
wrote bitterly about her exp-
eriences with ECT shortly be-
fore she committed suicide. In
Letters Home Sylvia writes
from McLean Hospital "I need
more than anything right now
for someone to love me, to be
with me at night when I wake
up in shuddering horror and

fear of the cement tunnels
leading down to the shock

room."

In addition to their press
release, Herrick representa-
tives also handed out a re-
print from Nov.'s Cosmopolitan
(Said one ex-ECT recipient,
next they'll be quoting Seven-
teen to back up their scienti-
fic judgments!). The reprint
describes ECT in glowing terms
making it sound almost like a
new beauty treatment: "After
the 10th treatment, Rene says,
'I suddenly felt great'...To-
day Rene is 25 pounds lighter
and a loving wife again."

Despite all the evidence
that ECT causes severe brain
damage, why is the psychiatric
establishment so enthusiastic
in its support? One clue is
found in The Mind Manipulators
“In Calif., where psychia-
trists were billing $40 to $50
for each shock treatment in
1975, those who used ECT heavily were reported to be earn-
ing $100,000 to $200,000 year-
ly as contrasted with less
than $60,000 for psychiatrists
who did not. In Quebec, where
the payment for ECT has been
lowered to $5 to $10 per treat-
ment, the use of the technique
is said to have dropped preci-
pitously... It seems safe to
say that what the government
and private insurance compan-
ies agree to pay will have an
important influence on the fu-
ture of ECT.
Not all of the psychiatric pro-
fession is united in promoting
shock treatment. At the Nov.
4 demo, two psychiatric nurses
expressed their opposition to
the practice. One, Judy Car-
roll, a former staff nurse at
Herrick who had assisted with
shock treatments there despite
their repugnance, said she
would have been fired if she
refused. Another nurse testi-
fied about seeing children
dragged out from under beds to
be given ECT in the hospital
where she worked in NYC.
NAPA's next step is to de-
mand that the Berkeley City
Council ban shock treatment.

they'll send you a packet of
information on shock treat-
ment. Books to read are those
mentioned in this article and
also: The History of Shock
Treatment, by Leonard Frank.
Frank was committed by his
parents, and with a court or-
der was administered 85 insu-
lin and electro-shock treat-
ments. The main symptoms of
his "mental illness" were his
vegetarianism and refusal to
shave his beard. Makes for
excellent reading! Another
excellent book is the incredi-
ble autobiographical account
of Jean Gotkin's life at the
hands of the psychiatric sys-
tem, Too Much Anger, Too Many
Tears/A Personal Triumph Over
Psychiatry by Jean Gotkin and
Paul Gotkin.
