This, Marge Piercy’s second  
novel, follows the lives of two  
women—Beth and Miriam—in  
finely drawn portrait mini-  
atures blown up generation  
size. For in their lives, as they  
move through the paroxysms  
of the 60’s and into the 70’s,  
weaves the thread of our own  
lives from childhood to  
womanhood. For some of us  
the process of growth and  
radicalization stops as it does  
with Miriam; for others of us  
it has been a constant renewal  
as with Beth.  

Beth goes through a famil-  
iar pattern: she marries, she  
despairs, she flees the mar-  
riage. Once in Boston, she  
begins an odyssey of self that  
eventually defines her as  
outlaw. Though the paperback  
cover intrigues us with the  
suggestion that she will end  
up in the arms of another  
woman, it is purposeful that  
the theme of woman loving  
woman does not develop until  
late in the story.  

The length of the novel has  
been subject to some critici-  
sm, but in order to appreciate  
Beth’s transformation, as well  
as Miriam’s stagnation, it is  
necessary as the title sug-  
gests to witness incident by  
incident, mind by mind, the  
stages of change that indeed  
we all go through. Beth’s  
relationship with Wanda real-  
istically comes as it does with  
so many women in this  

society only after the expect-  
ed things are done, only after  
the assaults on our dignity,  
and that final “click” that  
suddenly puts things in  
perspective.  

Miriam, who begins as the  
stronger female figure of the  
two, is the portrait of near  
disintegration. Her back-  
ground is no less familiar  
though the details of her  
Jewish upbringing in New  
York are superficially different  
from those of Beth. She goes  
from fat Miriam Berg to  
sensual Miriam Stone only to  
find that her marriage to the  
“exceptional” man, Neil, can-  
not give her what she truly  
needs. Neil’s characterization  
underlines an important truth:  
men, while chasing, hunting  
the free spirits that women are  
before they are wives, are  
loving, undemanding, able to  
give. These same men, once  
the prize is now property,  
become not only insensitive,  
but blind to the needs and  
space that all growing crea-  
tures require. The whole  
process of marriage leaves her  
less free than ever and her  
entrapment includes a whole  
series of rationales she uses  
to justify her life. What we see  
as readers that Miriam sadly  
cannot, is that while Beth is  
undergoing small changes  
that eventually add up to  
some kind of identity, Miriam  
continues to take more and  
more shit. Each layer piles up  
as she is forced to lose more  
and more of her spirit, until  
finally we see she is actually  
sitting on a large dung  

heap—only the tragedy is that  
Miriam may never see it for  
what it is and recover the lost  
notion of herself. Although  
she helps Beth and Wanda  
kidnap back Wanda’s child-  
ren, it is an exciting momen-  
tary identity she shares with  
the women; she cannot  
understand the total com-  
mitment to women that Beth  
makes.  

The men, while easily  
recognizable as types, are not  
lacking in dimension either.  
Jackson is the sardonic cynic,  
the austere ascetic. For him  
women are always sitting  
across from him in some  
social chess game. And he  
knows he can call mate at any  
time. Love with him is  
friction, conquest.  

Phil, the lost poet and  
ever-present child, at first he  
seems to come on as the  
sensitive young man who  
initiates Miriam, but he too is  
also devoid of any ultimate  
empathy. One incident in the  
book makes this so clear. He  
goes and screws Laverne, the  
wife of Ryan. Ryan had  
“raped” Miriam at a business  
conference. In his logical  
male mind, Phil was using  
Laverne to even the score and  
announces this matter of  
factly to Miriam as though  
Laverne were just anyone's  
pawn—some object in some-  
one else’s arena.  

It is against these men who  
filter out the feminine in us  
that the strength and beauty  
of Wanda emerges. She is  
glimpsed early in the novel  

as the wife of Joe Rosario (or  
more aptly put, Joe’s old lady)  
leftist revolutionary. She is  
bedraggled, seen as a burden  
to Joe’s activities. As his wife  
she has no character. As  
Wanda, the leader of a  
women’s theater, she is fiery.  
She nearly becomes the  
goddess incarnate in her  
sense of the eternal feminine.  
Her dialogue and comments  
are at once the most inspiring  
and the most controversial.  

When Wanda is subpoe-  
naed by a Grand Jury  
investigating Joe even though  
she had not been with him for  
three years, she refuses to  
answer any questions despite  
the threat of imprisonment.  
To answer one question is to  
answer them all, to destroy  
“the whole web of connec-  
tions in the movement.”  
Wanda is at that stage of  
consciousness where the  
movement that she identifies  
with includes the boys on the  
left, third world people, liberal  
women. Her explanation to  
Beth is that she won't carry  
Joe on her back any more, and  
further, “he isn’t my worst  
enemy.”  

For Wanda the enemy is  
still the state who makes war,  
the corporations who poison  
the earth for profit. The  
system. She doesn’t see the  
system as men, for she  
praises Joe for having made it  
in the white man’s world  
without seeing Joe as part of

The first KOA television  
special on women, one of the  
programs local groups had  
fought the station so hard for,  
was aired on Channel 4, Sept.  
29. The hour-long program  
called “Women in the Media,”  
was for the most part as  
unimaginative as its title.  
Even the technical aspects of  
the program were monoton-  

ous.  
Almost totally lacking in  
continuity or thought, the  
show’s basic premise seems  
to have been, “Well, let’s go  
find some women in the  
media and talk to them.”  
Actually, the special ran more  
like a public relations release  
for KOA and other local  
stations than a program  
dealing intelligently with wo-  
men in the media.  

Perhaps the most discour-  
aging aspect of this show was  

the complete lack of discus-  

sion or analysis concerning the  
issues of women in relation to  
the media. Even the recent  
battle with KOA to win a small  
amount of air time went  
unsaid and most of the  
women who spoke were eager  
to point out how wonderful it  
all was, how few problems  
they had, and how pleased  
they were to be there at all.  
There was no anger, no life,  

no controversy and no one  
willing to say very much about  
anything. There was little  
discussion about the strug-  
gles of women in the media,  
how they were treated as  
women or what special things  
women themselves could do  
with the power of the media.  

Questions about what wo-  
man’s function could be in  
one of the most powerful  
male-dominated fields in the  
world were not even raised.  
Just the fact that “a woman's  
function in” needs to be said  
at all is revealing; women  
certainly do not control or  
even influence the media very  
much.  

On the program, however,  
the role of women in the  
media simply became a matter  
of changing the projectionist.  
Nauseatingly enough, the  
only real point which the show  
made was that women could  
indeed become a part of the  
media if they worked hard and  
“weren't too radical,” as  
Rosemary Barnwell said. That  
a few women can be success-  
ful is not even a point. A few  
women can, but so what?  
Limited individual achieve-  
ment has nothing to do with  
women gaining any power in  
the total construct.  

Same Old Way  

We’ll still have shows that  
are violent, racist, and sexist  
and we'll still have commer-  
cials that are as repugnant as  
the ones that were inserted in  
this very special on women.  
Only now we'll have women  
who call themselves “camera-  

men” doing the shooting,  
women writing the violent  
scripts about men killing each  
other and raping women, and  
women broadcasting the news  
that men make about them-  
selves. How very wonderful  
that women can do the same  
things that men do and in the  
very same ways. How very  
disappointing.  

The next upcoming special  
will be dealing with women in  
sports and women in the  
National Organization for Wo-  
men. I only hope that they will  
show more consciousness,  
more vitality, and more  
controversy than this one did.  
I also hope that the programs  
will not be both directed,  
produced, and engineered by  
Manny Cantu and Sam Hous-  
ton or any other such  
unimaginative people. I feel  
that one of the biggest  
reasons this first special on  
women was so dull was  
because men with no real  
interest or knowledge of  
women and women’s issues  
were in such key positions. I  
had the overwhelming feeling  
that the show was just put  
together because there had to  
be a show about women. A  
we-have-to-do-it-so-here-it-is  
kind of attitude. These spe-  
cials are for and about  
women; they should be the  
products of many women and  
many women with a feminist  
awareness!

The problem. The point that  
Wanda—and Piercy—miss is  
that Joe is the system also.  
That it is not only our politics  
but our sex which is at issue.  
Joe is part of the total sexist  
oppression as his actions  
toward Wanda make clear.  
This section is the strongest  
political statement of the  
book, and Wanda’s position  
becomes one of confronting  
the system with our bodies if  
necessary. A fine leftist  
statement, but not a feminist  
solution.  

Wanda is one of the most  
vivid portraits in all Lesbian  
literature, but with important  
differences. In contrast to the  
previous treatment of Lesbi-  
ans in literature, she and Beth  
are not solely viewed in terms  
of bedroom issues. Piercy has  
created a novel which tran-  
scends the usual structure in  
American literature of one  
male hero who confronts the  
violence around him and  
extracts from that some ideas  
about the meaning of life.  
Small Changes with its  
collective persona distills our  
perceptions through the eyes  

of several characters. Wo-  
men’s love for women be-  
comes a part of the total  

vision, and hopefully Piercy  
and other women will contin-  
ue to refine the possibilities of  
art in that direction.
