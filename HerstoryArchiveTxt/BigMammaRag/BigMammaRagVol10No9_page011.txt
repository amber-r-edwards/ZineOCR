Gladman Electro-Shock Atrocity on Trial

Jenny Miller

On December 22, 1975, a 17-
year-old black woman named
Lynette Miller died from a
cardiac arrest at Napa State
Hospital in California. Until

cinations. The next day,
Lynette told her mother that
her arm hurt and she couldn't
move it. Not having been in-
formed of any possible adver-
se effects of the drug, Sel-

her first psychiatric incar-
ceration, 134 months earlier,
she had been an exceptionally
capable, talented, and out-
going high school student,
with no history of medical
problems. In August of 1981,
Lynette's mother, Selina
Miller, won a default judg-
ment of up to 7.8 million
dollars in a wrongful death
suit against Gladman Hospital.
Gladman, located in Oakland,
was the site of Lynette's
first incarceration, where
she had received electro-
shock treatment and massive
doses of phenothiazine drugs.
A jury trial to determine the
exact amount of damages was
held the week beginning July
6, 1982. Since it was a de-
fault hearing, Gladman Hosp-
ital was not permitted to
present testimony. On July
12, after several days of
testimony by witnesses for
the plaintiff, Judge Barber
declared a mistrial, based on
what he termed his own bias,
his suspicion that the wit-
nesses "lacked candor," and
his lack of medical expertise
with which to evaluate the
testimony.

During the trial, Selina
Miller, who is currently em-
ployed as a bus driver, spoke
about the nightmarish series
of events which began in Nov-
ember of 1974, when she was
notified by school authori-
ties that Lynette was ill
with nausea and stomach pains.
Selina took Lynette to a doc-
tor who diagnosed the problem
as stress from overwork, and
suggested that Lynette take
the rest of the week off from
school. At the suggestion of
one of the teachers, Selina
also took Lynette to see a
psychiatrist, who failed to
find any serious problems,
but who prescribed Mellaril,
"to calm her nerves." Mell-
aril is a powerful phenothi-
azine drug which has a long
list of unpleasant "side-
effects," including muscle
cramping, impaired speech,
thought and movement, uncon-

Selina assumed it was a symptom of
the illness, and arranged for
Lynette's grandmother to ac-
company her to the family
doctor, while Selina went to
work. During her visit to the
doctor's office, Lynette re-
portedly had a hallucination
and tried to jump out the
window. The doctor immediate-
ly had her committed to Glad-
man Hospital, where she was
again given large doses of
phenothiazines.

Selina described the changes

that came over Lynette after
she was admitted to Gladman:
"The second day I saw her she
could hardly walk. I called
her name. She looked right at
me and didn't respond. I
shouted, ‘I don't know what
the hell you've done, but my
daughter doesn't know me!"

I ate lunch with her at the
hospital. She'd been feeding
herself since she was a year
old. All of a sudden she
couldn't feed herself. It was
four o'clock when the doctor
appeared. He said drugs were
necessary to prevent her from
escaping because she couldn't
run on drugs. The doctor said
the reason she couldn't talk
was due to the drugs. He did-
n't mention any long-term
effects. Lynette had always
excelled in English and was a
good student in French and
Spanish. Now all she could
say was 'Yes' or 'I don't
know.' She couldn't control
her movements, was constantly
jerking."

After two weeks Selina re-
moved Lynette from the hospi-
tal against the doctor's ad-
vice. Intimidated by the doc-
tor's warning that without
the drugs Lynette would be
harmful to herself or others,
Selina continued to give her
the huge prescribed doses of
Thorazine and Stelazine. Af-
ter a few days at home, Lyn-
ette started to go outside
and run. Her mother described
her running "like someone with
infantile paralysis." Selina
brought her back to Gladman
because she was afraid she

would get hurt running in
that state. "The doctor said
the condition of taking her
back was no interference at
all from me. Dr. Sklar said
electro-shock therapy was
what Lynette needed to 'snap
her back to reality." He said
it was her only hope. He re-
ferred to it as a ‘treatment’ -
I took it to mean a one-
time thing. He didn't tell me
until they were through that
it was a series of thirteen
treatments. Dr. Sklar noti-
fied me that they'd done

everything they could, and I
brought Lynette home. She was
quieter, then she started
passing out. She would just
fall to the floor. She tried
to help out. She would only
be able to wash one or two
dishes. She couldn't straigh-
ten the bed. She never went
back to school. She never
combed her hair again. She
never brushed her teeth again.
She couldn't remember her
classmates - some she'd seen
every day - we'd lived there
5 or 6 years."

While Lynette was at Glad-
man, she was visited by Rev-
erend Thompson of the Berke-
ley Mount Zion Baptist Church,
who had been her minister
since she was 7 years old,
and was a close friend of the
family. Reverend Thompson
testified that Lynette had
been a leader in her Sunday
school, and from an early age
had been one of the small
group selected to teach the
other children. In some cases,
Lynette was teaching children
older than herself. She had

been very gifted musically,
and often sang solo in the

church choir. When he visited
her in Gladman Hospital, he
found Lynette tied to the
bed in four-point restraints
(hands and feet). She told
him the staff was going to
electrocute her with some
kind of machine because she
had tried to escape. After
her release, he testified
that she seemed to be in a
"zombie-ized" state; which
was very different from her
