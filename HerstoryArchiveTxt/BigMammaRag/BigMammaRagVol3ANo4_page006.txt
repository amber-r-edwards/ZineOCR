DFU.  

BMR: Will you tell us  
something of your background?  

PP: My parents always  
encouraged me to get a good  
education, and they made sacr-  
ifices for me. That's what the  
dedication in Child of Myself is  
about: my father had wanted to  
be a farmer, but he gave up that  
idea so we could have the things  
he wanted for us. I had a pretty  
strict upbringing.  

BMR: Were you ever married?  

PP: Twice. My first husband  
convinced me I was a fuckup —  
he was a writer too, and  
although I was writing prose at  
that time, his writing was always  
more important than mine. He  
criticized my prose, so I got to  
writing poetry instead. After that  
I decided to get rid of the  
husband, not the writing.  

BMR: Are you a separatist (a  
woman who does not work  
socially or politically with men)?  

PP: No, I could never be a  
separatist. Black and 3rd World  
men suffer some of the same  
oppressions I do. I don’t have  
much energy for men, but  
they're in the world and I don't  
think it’s realistic to pretend  
they're not. It’s like racism — it's  
not the blacks’ job to teach the  
whites about their racism. It's  
not the women’s job to teach the  
men about their sexism. Men  
have to do that themselves. But  
when they get it together, I'll talk  
to them, sure.  

BMR: How do you see your  

involvement in the black  
community?  
PP: I was involved in the  

Panther party in the 60's. Now  
we're doing a 3rd World  
women’s group called Gente  
(pronounced Henta). In the late  
60's we had a black women’s  
group that grew out of the  

Parker Talks  

Panther convention in D.C. You  
know, the official line was that  
the men were dealing with their  
sexism, but it doesn't work.  

BMR: Do you see a conflict  
between your feminism and  
your commitment to the black  
power movement?  

PP: There are political  
problems. A lot of folks say  
feminism is a divisive tactic in  
the black movement. I had  
doubts about that myself at one  
time.  

BMR: Could you tell us more  
about Gente?  

PP: We're a group of women  
trying to deal with racism as a  
feminist group. Gente grew out  
of the bar scene in San Francisco  
— we all get together and form  
basketball teams and play each  
other. The bars are run by white  
women, and they're just trying to  
make money. We formed our  
own 3rd World team, and then  
the shit hit the fan. Black people  
feel unwelcome in the bars —  
they don’t cater to us, even the  
music on the jukeboxes is white  
music. When we come into a bar  
together, a group of black and  
3rd World women, they assume  
we're going to make trouble. So  
far we've been playing  
basketball and softball, but  
we're starting a theatre group  
too. We want to take the  
emphasis off sports. We've been  
together about a year now, 25 or  
30 of us.  

BMR: Could you tell us  
something about the  
development of your poetry?  

PP: Well you know, first I  
wrote like they tried to teach me  
in school. You try to make it as  
obscure as possible. I think  
that’s pretty crazy, but some  
people still try to do that. Then I  
got into writing love poems, but  
I was making them sound like  
they could be for a man. Finally I  
stopped trying to be so damned  
universal. I write out of where  
I'm at. Since I came out, most all  
my poems deal with racism and  
me or sexism and me — and love  
poems for women.  

BMR: Do you consider your  
poetry a vehicle for your politics?  

PP: I write about what I feel. I  
don't hold back from saying what  
I think because of the audience.  
The way we publish a book (at  
the Women’s Press Collective) is  
political. Not holding back is

Anti-Abortion Groups Are Anti-Life  

Barbara A. Lavinio  

Assorted anti-abortion  
lobbying groups are at this  
moment proposing measures  
and amendments that revise or  
reverse the Supreme Court  
decision of 1973 that legalized  
abortion across the nation.  

After the gain various  
women’s groups have  
accomplished, and in spite of the  
fact that this gain is  
representative of the majority  
viewpoint, (64.3 Gallup Poll):  
“Right to Life” organizations are  
trying to take away a woman’s  
freedom to control her body.  

Why do these anti-abortion  
advocates call themselves  
“Right to Life”, when a more  
fitting name might be ‘Right to  
Existence’? We all know that  
there is certainly a great  
difference between mere ex-  
istence and life. Unwanted  
children are often barely able to  
exist. Those battered and burned  
or psychologically scarred by  
unprepared, emotionally  
distraught parents are not  
leading much of a life in the All-  
American sense or any sense of  
the word.  

Why do those critical of  
abortion look at it as an ex-  
clusively negative solution?  
Garret Hardin stated it well in  

Gold Flower, a Minneapolis,  
Minnesota newspaper when he  
said, "A woman who aborts this  
year because she is in poor  
health, neurotic, economically  
harassed, unmarried, on the  
verge of divorce, or immature,  
may well decide to have some  
other child five years from now  
—a wanted child. If her need for  
abortion is frustrated she may  
never know the joy of a wanted  
child.”  

Anyone who feels that  
abortion is a private matter of  
choice between a woman and  
her physician should write to his  
or her Representatives and  
Senators voicing this opinion.  
Anyone who feels there must be  
a complete separation of Church  
and State, and that the religious  
beliefs of a minority must not  
influence the laws which govern  
the majority should voice this  
opinion to the legislators.  

In the future there will be  
more pressure from “Right to  
Life” supporters with the  
backing of one of the wealthiest  
institutions in the world; The  
Roman Catholic Church. The  
illegitimate use of tax exempt  
monies by the Roman Catholic  
hierarchy i.e.: The National  
Council of Catholic Bishops, to  
further efforts to overturn the  
Supreme Court decision show  

political. You live politics. I  
hadn’t really thought of my  
poetry as political.  

BMR: Will the Collective  
publish any woman's work?  

PP: Some criterion is needed  
for what to print. Junk is junk.  
It’s not fair to a woman to print  
her work if it’s not good. Some-  
times it’s not time to print your  
stuff. It’s not good to print  
something just because a  
woman wrote it. It’s like going  
out too early and doing a  
reading. You can really get  
destroyed if people applaud  
when you’re doing pure crap.  

BMR: How do you deal with  
the question of standards?  

PP: All standards seem to  
exist to obscure meaning. I just  
want to say what I mean. Poetry  
has been controlled by men for  
so long. They’ve set the  
standards, the criteria for what's  
a good poem. It's all a bunch of  
shit, academic wanderings.  
Children are still being taught  
that that’s what they're sup-  
posed to write, and that makes  
me really angry. It’s a matter of  
where the control lies. There's  
so little poetry for us because  
look who sets the standards.  

BMR: Has your writing  
changed now that you know you  
have an audience?  

PP: Star tripping can really  
hurt you as a writer. But you  
can't help writing for an  
audience. That’s what it’s all  
about, communication.  

BMR: Does the composition  

of the audience make a  
difference to you when you  
read?  

PP: Yes, I feel different when  
it’s all women. I get higher when  
I read to them. When there are  
men, I make assumptions that  
they're not going to like where  
I'm coming from. I try to blow  
them out of the room.  

BMR: Why do people go to  
your readings?  

PP: Because I'm advertised as  
lesbian poems, fuck poems, kill  
the whites poems. Sometimes I  
feel I'm not angry enough to be  
billed that way.  

BMR: How do you respond to  
those labels?  

PP: I guess I play with them  
more than anything. If I'm  
advertised as a black poet, I'll  
read dyke poems. When the  
audience is women, they're  

how unworthy of respect or trust  
these leaders are.  

Many rural Catholic hospitals  
which are the sole health  
facilities of some areas refuse to  
allow doctors to perform  
abortions, thus imposing their  
religious dogma on everyone in  
those given areas.  

Completely ignoring the facts  
that since the legalization of  
abortion; 1) fewer women are  
dying during pregnancy and  
childbirth, 2) Criminal and  
dangerous attempts at self-  
abortion have declined greatly,  
and 3) fewer infants are dying in  
the first year of life, the Right to  
Life organizations have  
relentlessly harassed many  
doctors who perform abortions.  

United Methodist Bishop  
James Armstrong, testifying  
before the Senate Committee  
Hearing on Abortion charged  
that the attempt to amend the  
constitution (to declare a fetus a  
person) was an attempt to “write  
the views of a particular  
community into the law of the  
land.” He also said, “a church  
that proclaims celibacy to reflect  
the highest level of excellence  
and that takes the dimmest  
possible view on scientific  
methods of birth control is not in  
a logical position to impose its  
views on abortion on the  

there just to hear the poetry.  
Sometimes when I'm reading  
with male poets, they'll try to get  
me to read first, so that they can  
be the main show. I play their  
game, I know the game. I can be  
a very hard poet to follow on a  
program. I blow them right off  
the stage. They don’t know it, but  
they help me do it, they make me  
so angry. I read best when I'm  
angry.  

BMR: Are you planning to  
publish again soon?  

PP: Yeah, I'll have another  
volume of poems out soon,  
Womanslaughter. The title  
poem’s about my sister, who  
was killed by her husband. I'll be  
getting a novel to the press  
pretty soon, too.  

BMR: You're working on a  
novel? Will you tell us something  
about it?  

PP: Yeah, I can go back to  
prose now that my lover's a  
musician . . . it's going slow,  
though. I guess I'm lazy. It’s a  

remainder of  
(Plagenz 1974)  

It seems very difficult for the  
male membership of the Church  
hierarchy to identify with an  
economically desperate, un-  
prepared, pregnant woman.  
Most compulsory pregnancy  
amendments drastically affect  
poor women. Many amen-  
dments, (such as the recently  
defeated Bartlett amendment)  
are aimed at restricting the use  
of Federal money for abortion. This is absolutely ridiculous.  
What do we want, more children  
on welfare, or more children  
brought into families prepared  
for them? Children, who with a  
secure economic base, and love,  
can learn for themselves the  
great value of human life.  

The interested and involved  
can do something. Generate  
letters, mailgrams, and or  
telephone calls to the legislators  
of your home state. Ask them for  
a specific commitment to vote to  
defeat any future amendments  
to reverse or revise the Supreme  
Court decision on abortion.  

These Federal funds are  
largely Medicaid, but the impact  
of restricting this money would  
extend to every program which  
provides federal subsidy for  
health and social services, for  
professional and paraprofessional training and for  
research. It would also interfere  
with much of the research done  
on preventative medicine and  
birth defects. Who would suffer  
most if this funding were  
restricted? The poor, not those  
who could afford an abortion at  
any cost, legal or otherwise.
