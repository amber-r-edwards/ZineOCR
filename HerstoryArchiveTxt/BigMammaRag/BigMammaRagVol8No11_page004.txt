Dessie Woods Beaten By

Acting Warden

Dessie Woods, the black mother of
two who has spent the last five-and-
a-half years in prison for success-
fully defending herself and a female
companion from a would-be white rap-
ist, was beaten by the acting warden
at the Georgia Women's Institute of
Corrections in Hardwick, Ga.

The unprovoked attack by Acting
Warden Mark Martin occurred at a dis-
ciplinary hearing in early November
and took place in the presence of
other prison officials. Martin, who
had to be pulled off Woods, left her
face badly swollen. Woods was denied
medical treatment and was placed in
segregation.

J.P. Stevens

After 17 years of organizing ef-
forts and 4 years of a national boy-
cott campaign, the Amalgamated Clo-
thing and Textile Workers Union (ACT
WU) won their first contract at ten
of J.P. Stevens' seventy plus plant
sites.

Textile workers in the South parti-
cularly are the least unionized of
all American industrial workers. Im-
portant issues, besides the lack of
pensions and low wages, were those of
health and safety, and racial and sex
ual discrimination. Stevens was infa-
mous for maintaining a good safety
record--on paper--by forcing injured
workers back on the job or by firing
the injured. Another campaign grew
around occupational safety, especial-
ly lobbying to protect workers from
byssinosis--brown lung disease--
caused by the inhalation of textile
fibers.

The new contracts include strong
and arbitrable provisions regulating

In other developments, Woods was
denied parole November 4, allegedly
because of the nature of the offense,
her "attitude," and disciplinary
record.

Woods was convicted in January 1976
by an all-white jury and was senten-
ced to 22 years in prison after tak-
ing a gun away from Ronnie Horne, a
white insurance man posing as a po-
liceman, who attempted to use it to
rape Woods and her friend. Since her
imprisonment, Woods has been constant-
ly drugged, beaten, and attempts have
been made on her life.

directorates--the board members sit

forming a network of mutual support
between manufacturing, banking and

various giants through bad publicity

J.P. Stevens, which had come to rep-

that a firm could commit, was con-

The national J.P. Stevens boycott
began in 1976 and proved to be one
of the most effective and hard-hitting
boycotts ever, aimed not only
at Stevens' consumer sales and pub-
lic image, but also their corporate
connections. Only about 30% of Stev-
ens' products show up under their
label at the marketplace.

have been disabled for years now know
that it was the inhalation of fibers
that caused their lung problems, ra-
ther than bronchitis or too much
smoking as suggested by the Southern
Textile Industry. But this first
contract with Stevens is a beginning,
proof that a victory can be won over
a blatantly anti-union firm, lodged
in the Southern right-to-work-for-

solidarity with one another and take
careful aim in attacking all corpora-
tions on as many economic levels as
possible. All power to the people.

Ann Arbor Women Fight Back

A group of Ann Arbor women took ra-
dical action toward rape awareness
last night, November 12, 1980, by
spray painting the slogan, "A Woman
Was Raped Here" at approximately 150
sites where women have been sexually
assaulted.

To locate sites we could not rely
solely on newspaper accounts, but had
also to solicit personal testimony of
assault victims. A significant pro-
portion of rapes go unreported be-
cause of fear of reprisal and public
humiliation. Rapes are underreported
in the press because of police reti-
cence to “alarm women," and because
of the pervasive attitude that vio-
lence against women is not newsworthy.

Some may argue that our action will
engender even more fear among women,
but we are merely documenting the

reality that, even in Ann Arbor, wo-
men are terrorized every day by a cul-
ture that encourages violence against
women. We are calling attention to
the fact that, under Michigan's Crimi-
nal Sexual Conduct Statute, any forced
sexual conduct is a prosecutable of-
fense.

In their private fear, women stay
home at night and leave the street
to their assailants. In our united
public effort, we are urging women
to organize, to protect each other,
and to take back the streets.

There are a number of groups in Ann
Arbor organized to combat violence
against women. None of these is re-
sponsible for our action. We urge

women to join a group or form one
today.

FIGHT BACK!

Male Guard on Trial for Assault

of Oakalla Woman

Yvonne Chesimard

The struggle for justice around
the incidents of last December at
the Oakalla Women's Unit continues.
These incidents all involved the use
of extreme disciplinary measures--
women removed from the general popu-
lation and placed in solitary con-
finement cells; denied legal atten-
tion; their water turned off; taken
to their court appearance in pajamas;
forcible stripping and assaults--
caused the anger of all women there
to build up and riot on New Year's
Eve.

The riot is over but the fight con-
tinues. Geraldine Ferguson brought
a charge of assault against one of
the male guards in response to an
incident on the isolation unit Dec.
4. Geri Ferguson was assaulted and
stripped by Don Stevenson, supposed-
ly brought in in case of violence.
Stevenson was transferred to the
men's unit in January, but is limited
to working in the supply stores,
because the male prisoners have pro-
mised to get even with him.

Geri was in an isolation cell when
three male staff members and four
female staff members entered her cell
and told her to strip and move to
another cell. They justified their
presence in her cell as an "emergen-
cy" because a fire had been lit in
one of the adjoining cells the night
before, and they were searching
for fire-lighting materials.

A guard testifying to witnessing
the assault on Geri by Stevenson
agreed on the following: Geri was
standing on her bed backed into the
corner when Stevenson grabbed her
legs pulling her down on the bed
causing her head to slam into the
wall. Continuing to struggle, Geri
was forced off the bed onto the floor
where she received more injuries as
her head hit the metal frame of the
bed. The male staff then held her
down, stripped her pajama top off
and handcuffed her; he struck her
in the face with his fist as she lay
handcuffed. As he struck her he
said, “this one's for hitting Johan-
sen" (referring to the assault on the
Oakalla nurse that Geri returned
to Oakalla to do a forty-day sentence
for). The punches produced visible
injuries to her face.

Geri was then dragged into another
cell where Stevenson held her face
down on the floor while a matron
pulled off her pajama bottoms. She
was locked and handcuffed into this
cell, and left naked with no bedding
for over 24 hours. The guard who
testified in the proceedings has

Prisoner

since left the prison as her life was
in danger.

As for Geri, there is no "easy out."
Geri has been back inside since the
first day of the trial, and the staff
tried to break her. Threats of re-
percussions from this trial were
always present. After being released
in August, she has been intimidated
by cars parked outside her house,
being followed around the city by
people, and having her home broken
into in an obvious attempt to make
her feel vulnerable.

Geri has been more than brave, in
her belief in the need to expose
conditions inside. Geri kept try-
ing to bring in other incidents in
which this guard is known to
have assaulted, abused and manipu-
lated women prisoners...the judge
brought down the legal axe which
requires her to stick to the facts
of this charge alone. The court
attempts to break the common spirit
and common cause because they know
it particularly strengthens both
this case and Geri herself. They
can't abide the idea of a prisoner
charging a guard--it's contrary to
all norms and rules.

The trial was almost laughable
with the blatancy of the lies from
the prison staff and the obvious
collusion between the prison and
the state legal arbitrators. When
both the prison system and the court
system are so bound up together,
each keeping alive the existence of
the other, and when both have the
same employer--the state--you can't
really expect any justice when you
are prosecuting one of their people.

Geri's role has been more than
symbolic; she's got them sweating
because when someone resists their
power and refuses to be passive
their morally illegal system gets
exposed to the whole population and
encourages others to resist.

It is important to remember when
the decision comes down that Don
Stevenson is guilty, and he certainly
is guilty of it, that he is also
guilty of being the perpetrator of
an inhuman system, and it is the
prison system that is to blame and
must be destroyed. The male guard
assaulting women is an enemy but the
warden, Marie Peacock, gives the
approval, the orders, and the behind-
the-scenes control. Geri's fight
is for every woman who has been
through this treatment or may go
through it in the future.
