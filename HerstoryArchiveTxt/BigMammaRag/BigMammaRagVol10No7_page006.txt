Useless Bucks

The Ontario government has
ended its fiscal year with
$3.66 million left unspent
in its daycare budget. The
money was part of a much-
publicized $10 million in-
crease in funds to daycare
services in that province
last year.

Either municipalities
could not afford or did not
want to pay their 20% share
of increased salaries ($1
million had been slated for
that purpose), or they rea-
lized that if salaries were
increased, fees would have
to go up. Most parents
couldn't afford the increase.

Algerian “Reforms”

Women in Algeria have just
defeated an attempt by the
government to introduce a new
family code, aimed at trans-
forming women's status and
reducing their legal rights
(the "reforms" would have re-
duced women to the status of
legal minors and placed them
under the control of their
nearest male relative).

Under the socialist inspir-
ed constitution, drawn up af-
ter independence in 1962, wo-
men had equal status under
the law.

There have been several de-
monstrations outside the Na-
tional Assembly, with women
chanting, "No socialism with-
out women's participation!"

Koch Kriminal Kamp

New York Mayor Edward Koch
recently announced plans to
establish work camps for peo-
ple convicted of what Koch
calls "quality of life"
crimes (writing graffiti, try-
ing to ride the subways with-
out paying, running three-
card monte games on the
street, and small-time drug
dealing).

Those in the program will
live on Hart Island, and work
to construct and maintain
housing for themselves and
future prisoners.

Koch wants to make sure
that judges sentence more
people to jail terms for "low-
level crimes" instead of fin-
ing them. The work-camp pro-
gram in effect has the potent-
ial of replacing programs
like CETA, which are suppos-
ed to train and at the very
least pay youth for their
work, with a virtual slave-
labor program.

One day in 1977, students in La Paz, Bolivia painted this scene on a prison wall immediate-
ly abutting a city street. Within hours the scene had been whitewashed away, but not before
this photograph had been taken -- Red Dragon

No Rights Here

Carol Baldassarre, a 36-
year-old Boston woman who
has suffered eye problems,
family difficulties, emot-
ional strain, and who has
spent time in various hos-
pitals and institutions, is
fighting for her rights to
tenant protection. In 1980,
she was selected to live in
a shared apartment managed
by Lindemann Mental Health
Center. She and the two oth-
er women who shared the ap-
artment were promised they
would live in the community
on the same footing as the
people who had never been
mental patients. In July,
1981, Carol was evicted by
the police at the direction
of the mental health manag-
ers, after there had been
problems among the roommates.

Carol and her lawyer have
filed a class action suit
seeking damages and stand-
ard tenant protections for
residents of such programs.

Resist

Thousands of young Poles--
barred from wearing the red
and white "Solidarity" but-
ton--wear tiny electrical
resistors, attached to wire
hanging from their necks,

that look like colored beads.

Define Adequate

The Supreme Court recently
ruled unanimously that "men-
tally retarded" people com-
mitted to state institutions
have a constitutional right
to be protected from harm
and free from bodily re-
straints. The court also de-
cided that "mentally retard-
ed patients" have a right to
"minimally adequate training"
in many circumstances, part-
icularly if the training will
help assure their safety and
freedom from physical re-
straints.

Disruption Day

In hospitals all over Eng-
land, Scotland, and Northern
Ireland, nurses and ancillary
workers joined together in
a day of disruption. Their
wages have declined by 18%
since 1974. They are asking
for 12% increases; the govern-
ment is only willing to give
them between 4% and 6.4%.

Senior management and sen-
ior nursing officers have
tried to sabotage organizing
efforts. But at the hospitals
even some patients joined the
nurses on the picket lines.
The Day of Action on May 19th
was a united and effective
action!

Homework

The Greater London Council's
Supplies and Contract Services
sub-committee has approved a
new deal for people who do

aid work at home. These are
mainly women who are low-paid
and rarely receive sickness
and other benefits. A code of
practice based on nine guide-
lines will be applied to all
contracts made by the council
or its committees. If effect-
ive it will strengthen the po-
sition of women homeworkers
who, due to their isolation,
have little contact with wid-
er union activity.
