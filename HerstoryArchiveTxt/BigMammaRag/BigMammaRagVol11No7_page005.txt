Computer Busts

The American Civil Liberties  
Union in New Orleans has filed  
a class-action suit against  
the city, charging the police  
and sheriff's offices with  
falsely arresting several hun-  
dred people because of compu-  
ter foul-ups.

Shirley Jones, a black mo-  
ther of three, has been  
booked twice in the past  
year and jailed once as a  
result of computer foul-ups.  
She was reportedly arrested  
because her name was used as  
an alias by a woman who was  
sought on theft and forgery  
charges. She was imprisoned  
for 18 hours, despite the  
fact that she was born on a  
different date, is six inches  
shorter and many pounds  
lighter than the other woman.  
The sheriff's office said the  
computer was "a little off."

INS Raids

Recent raids by the Immigra-  
tion and Naturalization Ser-  
vice are just a pre-view of  
what's in store if the Simp-  
son-Mazzoli Bill is to pass  
this summer. Levi-Strauss in  
San Jose, CA interrogated  
workers about their residency  
status and turned the info  
over to the INS. The info led  
to arrest warrants for 51 wor-  
kers, a raid was held and  
most picked up. INS announced  
that the purpose of the raid  
was to create jobs--that they  
would conduct a raid a month  
in the San Jose area. In the  
next two weeks the Printed  
Circuits Technology, in Mili-  
pitas; and at Ozuna Tortilla  
Factory in Santa Clara.

Boys Preferred

Ronald Ericsson, a US scien-  
tist, has developed a techni-  
que that would make the chan-  
ces of conceiving a boy child  
3 to 1. Private clinics have  
been set up in SF, CA to per-  
form this service. The service  
involves using liquid albumin,  
a common protein found in the  
blood to separate sperm carry-  
ing male Y chromosomes from  
that carrying female X chromo-  
somes. The Y chromosomes swim  
to the bottom of a test tube,  
are collected, and then arti-  
ficially inseminated. One ar-  
gument in favor of pre-selec-  
tion is that couples are more  
likely to stop having children  
after the first boy; it might  
limit the size of families!

By the Catholic Church it is  
hailed as a lesser evil than  
abortion. Power to the Boys!

Swearing In

A sixty-four year old man  
was found not guilty of sex-  
ually assaulting his 12-year-  
old granddaughter because the  
judge presiding in the case  
wasn't convinced the victim  
understood the significance  
of taking an oath on a bible.

In London, Ontario, a judge  
questioned the victim at  
length on her religious back-  
ground in an attempt to dis-  
qualify her from being sworn  
in. He was successful. The  
victim was the Crown's only  
witness and because the judge  
determined she could not be  
sworn in, there was no evid-  
ence to corroborate her tes-  
timony.

The girl was unable to re-  
member when she was last in  
church and when asked what  
would happen if she lied un-  
der oath replied, "I believe  
God would be mad."

Active Dead

Some 180 undertakers from  
around the country attended  
a seminar in Cincinnati on  
the proper handling of radio-  
active corpses. Dr. Clarence  
Lushbaugh of Oak Ridge, Tenn-  
essee, an instructor, ex-  
plained, "In time of some  
big disaster or some big  
spill, you have to have peo-  
ple who know what they're  
doing."

Right To Refuse

The right of involuntary pa-  
tients to refuse drugs was  
granted by a federal court  
order on May 13 in San Fran-  
cisco, the result of a five  
year class action suit. The  
decree provides for three ex-  
ceptions to the adult inmates'  
right to refuse: “emergencies,  
"substantial deterioration"  
of the inmate's condition, or  
in cases where a conservator  
has been judicially empowered  
to consent for the inmate--  
he or she may be drugged upon  
an independent reviewer's de-  
termination that the drugs  
are necessary. The consent  
decree does not apply to min-  
ors. We hope that the court  
action will result in less  
forced drugging in some cases  
and more complete information  
about drug side effects. How-  
ever, this is no time to be  
trusting the state to comply.  
We must maintain our advocacy  
for the women and men locked  
up, and to include minors in  
the battles for the "right  
to refuse"--"for informed  
consent."

Puerto Rico, U.S.A.

Atari's cartridges can reach  
New York in just 3½ air cargo  
hours. On 26 flights daily.  
Some manufacturers wonder how good  
Puerto Rico is about getting goods to  
market.

Not Atari. This video games giant  
opened shop here with 35 em-  
ployees in April, 1981. The aim was to provide  
faster and more efficient coverage of  
the entire U.S. Atlantic Coast, Euro-  
pean, and South American Markets.  
It worked. Beyond anybody's  
expectations. Fifteen  
months later, Atari had 1000  
employees producing about 30% of the company’s  
world-wide output, not to mention one  
half of the huge U.S. market.

Puerto Rico is served by 1000 air  
cargo flights weekly. Thirty-eight steam  
ship lines call here. We're only 3½ air  
cargo hours from New York. Container  
ships sail the 1600 sea miles in 60 hours.

Europe is only 8½ air hours from  
San Juan. And we get things cracking  
in Caracas in 60 minutes; Rio takes just  
eight hours.

In Puerto Rico, we're closer than you  
think to your important markets. Our  
workers also add more value per dollar  
of production payroll than mainland  
workers —$5.58 vs. $3.72. Puerto Rico  
workforces are well-schooled and eager  
to do a good job. Absenteeism is low.  
Job terminations for cause are rare.

So for the people of Puerto Rico,  
Atari's the latest of 2500 business suc-  
cess stories. In Puerto Rico,  
we get things done.

Corporate Genocide...Brought To You By--

This corporate ad appeared  
in a glossy magazine called  
The Business Month. The 2020  
Plan to turn the island of  
Puerto Rico into an industri-  
al park is operating in full  
swing. This ad reflects the  
US colonialist/racist poli-  
tics in its promotion of  
Puerto Rico as the "Ideal Se-  
cond Home For American Busi-  
ness.” The ad gives an image  
of the Puerto Rican people--  
"well-schooled and eager to  
do a good job." Happy with  
their low wages--eager to  
work for corporate America.

The reality is that who is  
happy, for one, at least--  
is Atari. While in CA they  
continue to blame undocumen-  
ted workers for unemployment,  
Atari has recently shut down  
its plant in Santa Clara, CA,  
to move to Taiwan and Hong  
Kong--eliminating 1700 jobs.  
The people of Puerto Rico are  
militantly resisting the geno-  
cidal presence of the US,  
both here and on their island.  
The US state has responded  
with force using grand juries  
to lock up political acti-  
vists, creating gun battles  
that leave freedom fighters  
dead in the streets.

FREE PUERTO RICO!

On April 26, in the middle  
of the night, Puerto Rican  
prisoner of war Haydee Torres  
was snatched from her cell at  
Pleasanton Federal Prison in  
CA and transferred back to the  
Metropolitan Correctional Cen-  
ter (MCC) in San Diego. The  
transfer is part of the gov-  
ernment campaign to harass  
and terrorize the 11 Puerto  
Rican POWs--Haydee's health  
is again in danger (she had  
been denied medical care for  
a serious and possibly pre-can-  
cerous condition). To protest  
this transfer write: Warden,
