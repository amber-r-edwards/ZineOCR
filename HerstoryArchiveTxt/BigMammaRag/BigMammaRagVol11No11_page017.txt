Oppressed Group In The World - Indigenous Women

have distinctly different
women's culture. Of course,
in third world countries we
have entirely different
priorities because, perhaps,
we already have a distinct
and separate women's commun-
ity and culture.

It's like the thing about
spiritualism that's become
such an important concern in
the western world. So many
Anglo/white women are turn-
ing to ancient goddesses.

If I really wish to pursue
that, I could worship Kali
or Lakshmi - goddesses that
are part of our religion

and culture right now. So
that means that the sub-
cultural context that we're
in is so very much shaped by
and reflects Anglo, middle
class ways - just look at the
comedy, the humor, the kind
of entertainment and the bar
scene.

If you're from a language
and cultural background
that differs from that and
you're living in a place
like Australia - a first
world country - coming out as
gay means that when you are
perhaps establishing your
independence and breaking
away from your family,
family may be your only cul-
tural reinforcement, or even
support system within the
racist environment you live
in. Now at first it's won-
derful to find other gays
that you can be with! But
it's another step to then
turn around and recognize
that, in fact, the gay
sub-culture may not fulfill
all your needs. And you then
may have to settle, in some
ways, for second best; dress
to be like everyone else and
accept the entertainment and
social scene that's there,
even if it does nothing for
you!

One of the things I've
really enjoyed in the cross-
cultural groups that we
have succeeded in creating
is that we can share each
others' festivals and cele-
brations. We're able to in-
volve ourselves in each
others' cultures, but be-
cause of our feminism we
can change our own rituals
and celebrations for our-
selves. For example, in my
case, take the festival of
Cicali which is usually
celebrated with family and
friends. Because a large
part of the ritual has to
do with women and Lakshmi
worship, I always celebrate
it only with women.

One of our battles has
been the fact that feminist
and gay media is only in
English. But for the first
time this year at Interna-

your

tional Women's Day in Syd-
ney we were able to trans-
late the speech that we,
the Black, Immigrant, and
Third World Women's Alli-
ance, wrote into 14 differ-
ent languages. We then
proceeded to deliver this
speech, one after another,
in these languages. It was
a terrific learning exper-
ience, especially to mono-
lingual women - to have to
sit there and listen - and
not understand a word
that's been said to them!
It's something I'm sure
many of them never think
about, not even feminist
activists! Within the speech
we talked about other op-
pressed groups including
lesbians. Lots of our wo-
men didn't have a word for
lesbian in their language,
so we simply translated it
to "women who love women."
And that in itself was
quite an interesting com-
ment on some of our cul-
tures.

Most third world women
have always had lots of in-
volvement with other women.
It's hard to say to you
western women that what hap-
pens is our sexuality is
sublimated, and that we may
not have that strong desire
for sexual stimulation, i.e.
genital sex, that you seem
to have, or at least prior-
itize. Maybe one reason
that this is so for us is
because what we're getting
is physical stimulation in
other ways: from the food,
from the affection, from
the close body contact with
other women. Women loving
women is much closer to our
idea of what you label as
"lesbianism" than purely
sexual lesbianism. I keep
saying, it's not a genital
lesbianism.

The non-western women
that I've had the honor and
privilege of living,
laughing, loving and work-
ing with would most probab-
ly back me up when I say
that in our cultures we
have relationships of all
kinds with people around us,
and the people around us
are women, and they're
the ones who give us emo-
tional support, they'll
feed us, they'll nurture us,
they'll care for us, and so
we have incredibly deep
emotional ties with each
other. That has always been
how it is and hopefully will
continue to be so in the
future.

I think to myself, now
where does that leave some-
thing like clitoral orgasm?

The Goddess of the belly-laugh, indecent gestures and lewd jokes. Like most
ancient goddesses, a big, round woman. When she saw Demeter weeping, Baubo
lifted up her skirt, showed her cunt to Demeter - and made Demeter smile.

I don't know. We all have
to recognize and acknow-
ledge that what we quite
often are dealing with are
concepts that simply do not
exist for some the way they
do for others. Am I making
myself clear? Do you under-
stand what I'm desperately
trying to communicate to
you?

Our group has been very
careful that we're not
identified as a lesbian
group because lots of our
women are working in the
community. Our work is most
often at the grassroots le-
vel. So that means if you

are, for example, a Turkish

woman and you're working
with the Turkish community,
the last thing you want is
for people to know that
you're associated with les-
bians or are a lesbian,
because the doors may all
close on you. So there are
times you can come out and
times you don't come out -
that's all there is to it.
If my coming out as a les-
bian meant that I didn't
have access to the women

in my community, I can tell
you, I'm not going to come
out. And people have got to
really recognize that there
are different ways of oper-
ating.

Because there were abori-
ginal women and Black-iden-
tified women who wanted to
work together, whose main
commitment is to the women
of the land - on their terms,
we recently came together
to form the Sydney based
Black Women's Group. We
are a tightly knit, totally
supportive group. We see
ourselves as accountable
to aboriginal women and to
each other. It means that
we challenge ourselves and
each other. We employ
political tactics that are
very different to that of
many other women in the
women's liberation move-
ment in Australia. But we
feel that this is vitally
necessary for we are fight-
ing for the liberation of
the most oppressed group in
the world - indigenous women.
Yes, in that group we have
lesbians and heterosexual
women, but there is
no disharmony. Not that we
ignore the issue of sexual-
ity. It just means, that for
us, we have succeeded in
creating a space where at
last it is no longer an
issue among us. And after
all, isn't that partially
what the women's liberation
and gay liberation move-
ments are trying to achieve?
