Cleaning Up

Overseas Citizens - and en-
titles only British Citizens
to full protection and bene-
fits of the state. This will
establish a rigid hierarchy
of first and second class
citizenship which assures the
white population of its own
supremacy.

With the bill's passage
into law, all people now "pa-
trials" of Britain and its
colonies shall automatically
become British Citizens. Pa-
trials are those immigrants
not covered by the Immigra-
tion Acts of 1962 on, plus
Commonwealth Citizens with a
British parent, notably mil-
lions of white Commonwealth
Citizens who are not them-
selves Citizens of Britain.
As “true Brits" they will be
protected from deportation.
They will also have the right
to leave the country for any
period of time and return
freely. "Settlers," the de-
signation given millions of
women from the New Common-
wealth and non-Common Market
countries, have no similar
securities. Their status
gives them no automatic guar-
antee against deportation,
and should they be out of the
country longer than two years
or take frequent short trips
abroad, they will lose their
right to return to Britain.

But Britain is not merely
leaving the door open so its
immigrants can be hastily
turned out. It is making it
difficult for non-whites who
stay to take advantage of the
National Health Service, hous-
ing, education, social secur-
ity and employment. The effect
of the bill will be to make
present, often arbitrary dis-
crimination far more system-
atic, in part through a com-
puter inter-link between wel-

she continued. But despite
the fear that her assistance
will be cut, Gwen like many
others is "taking a stand."
"To keep things in persp-
ective you have to look at
these so-called "democratic
rights." You are not a per-
son if you receive financial
assistance, if you're poor
or Black. You are not a per-
son if you're working class,
either. They're taking the
money that could be helping
all poor people and getting

fare services, hospitals and
the Home Office. As it is
codifying racism, it is also
systematizing sexism. "The
Nationality Bill says that a
British citizen's wife cannot
acquire... citizenship if they
get divorced or separated,”
explain Lena and Parita of
Brent Action Against State
Racism. "And a black British
woman citizen who has a child
born here or who is expecting,
cannot claim free National
Health Service treatment if
the husband is abroad."

Part of this logic is to
prevent so-called “marriages
of convenience" in which a
person marries to acquire
citizenship rights. Virginity
tests at ports of entry have
been central to the Home Of-
fice's campaign against such
marriages. In 1978, it became
public that virginity tests
were being given to women en-
tering the country as depen-
dents or as fiancées of
British citizens. Evidence of
the test came to light when a
35-year-old schoolteacher,
who arrived from India to
join her fiancé, was subject-
ed to a pelvic exam and sub-
sequently complained about
the procedure to the Indian
WOMEN'S Association. The
Home Office defended itself
against public outrage by
claiming that virginity tests
helped them identify depend-
ents (16 and younger) and
bona fide fiancées (assumed
to be virgins) with the legal
right to enter the country,
versus women who are not de-
pendents or virgins and,
therefore, illegal entrants.

To date it is difficult to
know how many women have been
subjected to these virginity
tests since the Home Secretary
denies any knowledge of such

ready for war, building up
the Pentagon arsenal," Gwen
said.

She talked about some
changes that could be made.
All buildings should have
braille elevator symbols,
as should all bus signs, and
at accessible height. Food
store shelves should also
have braille symbols with
available personnel to
assist. There should be hand-
les on buses, guide railings
in all buildings. Subways
are almost totally inacces-

“the man’s country,

tests being performed. Yet the
tests are pivotal to the gov-
ernment's process of selecting
women to enter Britain, and
there is every indication that
they are continuing. In its
complaint lodged with the U.N.
Human Rights Commission, the
Indian government said that
similar indignities were oc-
curring at British High Com-
mission Offices in New Delhi,
Bangladesh and Pakistan. Vis-
itors to Britain from Africa,
Asia, Latin America and Car-
ibbean countries were also
said to have been subjected to
the exams.

This fall the government
also plans to put a total ban
on foreign husbands entering
Britain. However, men can and
will continue to have the
right to bring their wives to
Britain, and this goes to the
heart of the government's du-
plicity. Enoch Powell seemed
to be speaking clearly for the
state when he said, "I regard
the transmission of national-
ity by the male as correct,
logically correct."

Like shadows following, as-
suming and responding to the
shape of the object they re-
flect, women are expected to
take their identity and their
legal position from men and
children. Immigrants, said
Merlyn Rees, Minister of the
Home Office, “Should live in
not the
woman's."

This is not just wishful
thinking. Section 5 of the
Immigration Act already pro-
vides for women's deportation
when their husbands are re-
moved from the country, al-
though men are not similarly
constrained to follow their
wives into banishment. It is
perhaps not surprising then
that a woman has no legal
right to transmit her nation-
ality to her children if they
are born abroad, while a Brit-
ish man's children automatic-
ally assume British citizen-
ship regardless of their
birthplace.

The bitter irony is that
as “dependents", immigrant
women magically cease being
workers in the eyes of the
government. The reality and
the truth cannot so easily
be dismissed. All the hotels,
restaurants, private homes
and hidden cottages that have
breathed the sweat and labor
of these women have also been
sustained by them, as the
country has. No one knows this
better than the women them-
selves whose voices are being
raised in protest across the
island. In Brent they are
marching against deportations,
fighting the Nationality Bill,
tackling local problems. Black
women in Brixton are campaign-
ing against state brutality.
They are fighting "sus" laws
and operating a center for
black women. In the Organiza-
tion for Women of Asian and
African Descent (OWAAD) women
are engaged in feminist and
anti-racist campaigns. Across
Britain, settlers, patrials
and women classed as British
citizens are lighting fires
beneath the false promises
of the state and cracking the
brittle edifices of racism
that have followed Britain
through centuries of colonial
rule.

She spoke about the All-
Peoples Congress, and its
mandate for national days of
resistance against Reaganism
to take place April 24-May 2.
"The Days of Resistance means
mass resistance every day, in
whatever areas, whether it's
in the cutbacks or racism or
war. I'm willing to fight
back whatever way I can. It's

who were at the Congress who
can do it. We were all the
oppressed fighting together.

She said, with quiet dig-
nity and strength, at the
Congress, “for once in my
life I didn't feel just like
a ‘blind person.' I'm a blind
person with something to say
and to learn from others. I
have a strong sense of strug-
gle, to be free. Strength
comes from the oppression and
all of us fighting together,
with mutual respect and
support."
