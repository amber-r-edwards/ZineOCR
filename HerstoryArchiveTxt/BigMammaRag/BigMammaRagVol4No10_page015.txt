Boulder Center Begins  
Job Training Project  

The Boulder County Women's Resource  
Center is one of two agencies in the  
western region which has been provided  
funds to initiate a new and unique em-  
ployment project, it has been announced  
by WRC director Rosalind Alleman.  
The Center will provide intensive  
skills training, including supportive  
services, to 150 women in Boulder Coun-  
ty and place them in jobs.  

“This type of project has never been  
undertaken before," says Claire Larg-  
esse, WRC employment counselor. "It  
is unique in that we will go beyond  
merely training women and placing them  
in jobs. The program will emphasize  
supportive services during training,  
will deal with the particular problems  
facing women in the working world, pro-  
vide follow-up services after placement  
and concentrate on women seriously in  
need of employment," Largesse explained.  

The pilot project has been made pos-  
sible by a grant from the U.S. Depart-  
ment of Labor, with the WRC serving as  
subcontractor for the Boulder County  
Division of Employment and Labor.  

Disadvantaged Women Sought  

The first phase of the program will  
be to provide an employment workshop  
for 70 women this fall. Department of  
Labor guidelines stipulate that parti-  
cipants must have been unemployed for  
over 30 days, or are underemployed  
(working part-time or earning a very  
low income), or must be economically  
disadvantaged (poverty level income or  
below). The WRC is particularly inter-  
ested in working with women who are  
single parents, over 40, displaced  
homemakers, discouraged workers, minor-  
ities or are on public assistance.  

Participants will be paid a stipend  
of $3.00 per hour during the program.  

Help with other supportive services, in-  

cluding child care and transportation,  
will be available.  

From the applications received before  
October 29, 70 women will be selected  
for the fall program. Fifty of these  
women will receive intensive job train-  

ing, employment counseling and support  

services prior to being placed in a job.  
Twenty women will concentrate on a reapplication of management skills in a work/training pro-  
gram.  

WRC counselors will maintain con-  
tact with the women following job  
placement, explains counselor Janet  
Heimer. “The follow-up aspect of the  
program is of prime importance. It  
is very difficult for women who have  
been out of the job market to adjust  
to the working world. This is not  
because they lack capability, but is  
due to personal and emotional prob-  
lems which must be dealt with.  

The 20 women who are placed in a  
work experience program will concen-  
trate on brushing up their skills  
and learning new skills in the areas  
of management, supervision, and per-  
sonnel. These women will be placed  
in entry-level jobs with the poten-  
tial of upward mobility. The WRC  
grant will pay half their salaries  
for a six month work experience per-  
iod.  

Second Phase in January  

The project, which will begin a  
second phase in January with a train-  
ing program for another 80 women,  
is under the direction of Alleman.  
Largesse and Heimer will serve as  
counselors and job developers.  

Due to the fact that the WRC em-  
ployment component will be focusing  
on the implementation for the Depart-  
ment of Labor grant, it will no lon-  
ger be accepting new clients for  
job counseling and placement. The  
component (formerly Womanpower, Inc.)  
will continue to provide services  
to clients already enrolled in the  
program.  

Alleman noted that the WRC would  
appreciate receiving comments on the  
project and its various aspects from  
Boulder County employers and other  
interested people. Contact the WRC  
employment component by phoning

ties before them have. Discrimina-  
tion, however, keeps them from oc-  
cupations that have existed for a  
long time.  

"Our study shows many women in new  
jobs, such as computer programming  
but few in engineering, middle ma-  
nagement, and the skilled trades,"  
she said. "When women do get tradi-  
tional male jobs they are paid less  
and there is less chance to be pro-  
moted."  

Job titles often reflect this pre-  
judice, Prof. Gerner said. A man  
doing office work may be called an  
administrative assistant while a wo-  
man is called a secretary. The ad-  
ministrative assistant is paid more  
and can move up to middle management  
but the secretary -- even an execu-  
tive secretary -- is denied such ad-  
vancement.  

also be no refunds for at least a  
year."  

It is theoretically possible  
not to pay any dividends. The  
expectation is that enough women will  
save without that incentive, to keep  
the Credit Union operating.  

CFFCU board members are expected  
to prepare for their meetings. De-  
spite carefully timed agendas,  
meetings have been known to run as  
long as 6 hours, until 2 am. It  
seems to me not unreasonable to ex-  
pect Credit Union members to prepare  
themselves likewise, and to give  
the board time to include them on  
the agenda. Board members must them-  
selves submit agenda items in ad-  
vance of meetings.  

Minutes of board meetings are ac-  
curately kept and are open to peru-  
sal by any CFFCU member. Further, a  
monthly community meeting is open  
to all women.  

Accountability doesn't mean being  
available to everyone at their con-  
venience. It means structuring for  
reasonable access and making sure  

Only A Door  

Linda Rechter  

The “Only A Door" women's center,  
located in the basement of the Park-  
hill Community Bookstore on 4620 E.  
23rd Ave., has been going strong  
since May 22. Catering to middle-  
class family women in the Parkhill  
area, the center provides a refuge  
for women seeking the energy, poli-  
tics, and talents of other women.  

The spark of the center, Ann Ewing,  
originated “Only A Door" as a part of  
a doctoral project. She became in-  
terested in women's activities as a  
result of the isolation of her marri-  
age. "Loneliness," Ann explains, “is  
one of the main issues of the center.  
Women have been cut off from each  
other through marriage and child-rear-  
ing, or have been recently divorced  
and are now faced with being alone.  
Women here feel limited in that all  
their education has just gone towards  
being housewives; they have a lot of  
pain and anger, and this is a place  
where they can come to be radical or  
non-radical, or just be mellow.”  

Different workshops have been pre-  
sented, as well as consciousness-  
raising, Gestalt, and literature  
groups. In previous workshops women  
have dealt with feelings on mother-  
hood, sexuality, male socialization,  
religious myths, and growth as women.  
People also meet at the center to jog  
every morning, and hike in the moun-  
tains on Fridays. Workshops include  
"The Inner Fashion Experience" and an  
"Exploration of Lesbianism." The fa-  
shion workshop dealt with women's  
feelings about and self-expression  
through clothing. The lesbian work-  
shop plans to look into myths and  
stereotypes, homophobia, and the com-  
ing out process. It is planned for  
November 6, 9-5, at a cost of $12.  

A workshop for children ages 13-17  
facing divorce started on October 20  
and will continue for 5 more sessions  
on Wednesdays from 4:30-6:30. Child-  
ren will discuss reactions to their  
parents' divorces as well as learn  
their own legal rights.  

~ A benefit for “Only A Door" will be  
held on Saturday, November 13, from  
2:00 to 4:00 pm and will be open to  

Saxe Interview...  
From Pg 8  

Cookie: The thing that comes to my  
mind is something Shoshana (Pat Swin-  
ton) said when she was talking about  
Susan. After knowing Susan, she said  
we need all the Susan Saxes we can  
get in our communities. That's very  
much the way I feel. Others who  
have come to know her feel the same  
and will stay with her through a  

BMR: The defense committees have  
obviously done a lot of work toward  
educating people about Susan Saxe  
and about her trial. Would you like  
to say something about the financial  
work you've done to raise money for  
the defense?  
Cookie: We need $30,000 just for the  
Boston trial. That's not counting  
the legal costs of the Philadelphia  
trial. We've raised a substantial  
amount of money, but we have lots  
more to raise and we'll be doing  
that after the trial is over. We  
were fortunate because Susan is a  
poet and her poetry has given people  
a sense of who she is. We printed  
some of her earlier poems, “Talk  

the Womenfolk", and the Defense  
Committee is selling it for $2.00.  
People can order it through us if  
they want to. Contributions, dona-  
tions, whatever can be sent to the  
Susan Saxe Defense Committee, PO Box  
39, West Somerville, Mass 02144.  

Resource Book...  
From Pg Tf!  

There are going to be some essays  
scattered throughout the book. A  
section on corrections tells about  
Esther Freds and six other women in  
Pueblo who help women being released  
from jails and prisons with their  
reentry into society. The most poig-  
nant editorial, suggested Auer, is  
the cover photo of the woman in the  
shadows.

creative dance, a celebration of life  
and will be taught by the Jubilante  
dancers or Heather Keen Wing. There  
is a $2.00 donation asked (35¢ for  
children) and it will be held at the

The name "Only A Door" was taken  
from an Adrienne Rich poem that of-  
fers a door, on the other side of  
which lies self-realization and in-  
sight. “We don't promise salvation  
here," Ann warned, "like the poem  
says, this is only a door.“  

NOW Takes On  
Channel 7  

The Colorado National Organization  
of Women (NOW) recently filed a sex  
discrimination complaint against  
KMGH-TV Channel 7.  

The third party complaint was  
filed October 12 with the Denver  
office of the US Equal Employment  
Opportunity Commission. It charges  
that:  

1. Females are not recruited and  
hired in the same manner as males.  

2. Females are paid lower wages  
than similarly situated males.  

3. Females are not provided train-  
ing as are males.  

4. Females are not promoted in the  
same manner as males.  

5. Females are not upgraded into  
management positions as are males,  
thereby segregating them into the  
lower job classifications.  

6. Females are required to per-  
form additional duties at the station  
beyond their job descriptions,  
thereby forcing them to work over-  
time. Similarly situated males are  
not subject to these conditions.  

7. Females are not afforded any  
type of grievance procedure as are  
males.  

8. Females in professional posi-  
tions are required to perform their  
own clerical duties, whereas similar-  
ly situated males are provided with  
clerical support.  

The NOW Media Monitoring Task  
Force studied the statistics  
provided in their public inspec-  
tions file pertaining to full-time  
employees and found that 83% of ma-  
nagerial positions are filled by  
males, 100% of sales positions are  
filled by males, 93% of technical  
positions are filled by males, and  
that females occupy 100% of the  
clerical positions at the station.  

The position of Colorado NOW and  
the Media Monitoring Task Force is  
that such hiring practices are fla-  
grantly against the law which states  
that women may not be discriminated  
against in employment. National NOW  
Media Monitoring Task Force Coordi-  
nator Kathy Bonk, in Washington, DC,  
has stated that “NOW is planning to  
carry out similar proceedings a-  
gainst other major media corporate  
conglomerates across the United  
States." KMGH in Denver is owned  
and operated by McGraw-Hill Broad-  
casting Company.  

The Denver Chapter of NOW, as part  
of its chapter goals, stresses full  
and equal employment of women in the  
media in its quest to improve the  
image of women in the media.
