In the early days of the
women's movement, concern
over the conditions of im-
prisoned women ranked near
the top of the feminist ag-
enda. One of the most dramat-
ic victories of the young

movement, for example, was
the closing of the notorious
Women's House of Detention
in New York City. Articles
and books on the subject of
women in prison brought the
plight of poor and minority
women keenly into focus for
all women and kept the move-
ment in touch with women
whose idea of liberation ex-
tended beyond an equal shot
at a seat on a corporate
board.

But in the 1970s, the ini-
tial concerns for women so
different from the movement's
middle-class base faded as
feminism became “respect-
able." The movement did, how-
ever, retain an interest in
the plight of women who found
their way into the criminal
justice system, but this in-
terest was focused on the
woman as victim.

Originally, even concern
for the female victims of
crime was the exclusive pre-
serve of grassroots femin-
ists. The system's unstated
assumption was that women who
were the victims of physical
assault or rape had probably
brought it upon themselves.
Hence, the first rape crisis
and spouse abuse centers were
organized by women's groups
without much formal support,
and sometimes, in the face
of official hostility. How-
ever, interest in this social
problem, unlike the concern
for women offenders, was of
substantial appeal to cer-
tain elements of the estab-
lishment. Quickly law enforce-
ment and social service agen-
cies allied with liberal hos-
pital administrators and the
more conservative women's
organizations to move into
the area of “victimology."

comfortable to the liberal
paternalists. They could now
shower their regard on the
proper kind of woman, the
helpless, plundered waif,

and simultaneously make in-
roads into the troublesome
women's community. Confusion
in the feminist ranks over
how best to respond to agen-
cies suddenly willing to
spend money on the woman vic-
tim (money which has always
been desperately short for
women's services) aided in
the paternalist takeover. The
success of this strategy has

been so complete that the wo-
men's movement has lately been
very quiet about abuses within
the criminal justice system.
This silence is particularly
ironic as the '70s signaled
a dramatic deterioration in
the situation of the woman
offender. Despite the fact
that women's crimes are typi-
cally neither serious nor
violent: larceny, forgery

and drug offenses, and the
fact that the percentage of
women convicted of serious
crimes has gone down (con-
trary to popular myths), the
number of women sent to prison
has increased fivefold

during this period.

Some explained this in-
crease by suggesting that
these women were simply gain-
ing illegal equality just as
their sisters were seeking
legal equality, but, of
course, nothing could be fur-
ther from the truth. Most of
the increase in female crime
has come from changes in law
enforcement practices rather
than female behavior. For
example, stores are now more
willing to prosecute shop-
lifters and states are pur-
suing welfare fraud more as-
siduously.

Hawaii's situation paral-
lels the mainland. There has
been a dramatic increase in
the number of women in pris-
on. In the late '60s, the
state had so few women sen-
tenced to prison that they
were simply shipped to the
mainland. Now, on any given
day there are about 35-45
women under lock and key in
Oahu's largest prison (euph-
emistically known as Oahu
Community Correctional Cen-

'J. Vogelsang/ LNS

ter). About a third of these
women are pre-trial detainees,
another third are serving
short sentences which are in-
creasingly given out with
"probation," and the final
group are sentenced felons.

The typical woman in OCCC
is not, then, incarcerated

for a serious offense. More
often than not she is a petty
property or drug offender
with a history of prostitu-
tion. If she is imprisoned
for a violent offense, it

was often the murder of an
abusive spouse. Despite their
minor criminal records, how-
ever, the women in OCCC do
very hard time. This ironic
situation is a product of the
prison administration's exces-
sive concern with the preven-
tion of sexual expression.

To prevent male and female
inmates from any interaction
which might conceivably re-
sult in this dread event, the
prison has essentially de-
prived women inmates of ac-
cess to the woefully small
number of programs currently
available at the facility.

Women inmates at OCCC have
no access to the prison's
two vocational programs, no
access to the prison's work-
lines (except janitorial
work in the women's visiting
area), no ability to enter
the prison's furlough prog-
ram, no access to the large
recreation yard, no access
to clubs such as Ike Na Paa-
ho (Stay Straight), restricted
access to religious ser-
vices and community excurs-
ions, and no voice on the in-
mate council. When they go
to school (their one genuine
program opportunity), they
must be escorted by a matron
(male students come to class
on their own). Women have no
free movement in the facili-
ty while many male prisoners
move about with passes. The
prison's obsession with sex-
uality is a form of Blue Co-
llar Victorianism that ulti-
mately blames the women pri-
soners for "turning on" the
men and this logic is then
used as justification for
curtailing female access to
prison programs.

Unfortunately, this con-
cern about sexuality does
not prevent the sexual abuse
of women prisoners by prison
staff. In the recent shake-
down, women prisoners were
forced to march naked out of
their cells and down long
corridors in front of fully
clothed male staff (some of
whom were holding attack
dogs). Women who were menst-
ruating were allowed no san-
itary devices. More serious-
ly, there have been persis-
tent reports from prisoners
of sexual harassment and
rape by male guards.

Harassment and victimiza-
tion is essentially all these
women have ever known. For
many, their involvement
in crime often grew out of a
life on the streets that was
not so much a choice as a ne-
cessity. They ran from fath-
ers, or step-fathers who ra-
ped them into the arms of o-
ther men who were equally
predatory. Yet through all
of this, they possess a res-
ilience and warmth. They are
deeply interested in women's
issues and frequently ask a-
bout local women's organiza-
tions. They often wonder if
these women's groups could
help them secure their rights
in the prison and even attem-
