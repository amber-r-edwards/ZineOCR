Hurry Tomorrow is a docu-  
mentary about life on a locked  
psychiatric ward. Filmmaker Richard Cohen spent two  
weeks at Metropolitan State  
Hospital in L.A., just ob-  

movie review  

serving, before filming be-  
gan. In a recent interview,  
Cohen told the following  
story about this period:  
"One day I was perched on  

the radiator near the pool  
table when a group of psych-  
iatric technician students  
fresh out of high school wan-  
dered in for their first  
exposure to what they had  
been told was the toughest,  
craziest ward in the city.  
Several nervous young women  
came and sat around me. I  
guess I looked like the  
craziest or the most harmless  
patient. Then one shyly  
turned to me and asked, 'How  
long have you been here?' I  
answered, ‘About half an  
hour.' She turned away.  
There was another long pause,  
then she asked, 'Why are you  
here?' I answered, 'I'm mak-  
ing a movie.' There was an-  
other momentary pause, then  
she and the other students  
got up and quickly moved out  

of the dayroom, probably to  
analyze my delusions. This  
experience clued me in to  

the problems of the attitudes  
of the staff. First it ap-  
pears that most of the staff  
are afraid of the patients.  
The second thing is they  
don't respect what the pa-  
tient says ... we could have  
reacted the same way as the  
student. A belief in psych-  
iatry and mental illness  
could have trapped us ... but  
I was determined to search  
out the patients' experi-  
ence."  

And search out the pat-  
ients' experience they did,  
in 14½ hours of luminous and  
devastating cinema, shot over  
a period of six weeks on the  
ward. If we didn't know this  
was a documentary, we might  
think the screenwriter had  
gone too far in showing the  
idiocy and brutality of the  
staff. Consider this ex-  
change between the ward  
psychiatrist and Craig, a 19  
year old black patient:  

Doctor: Why do you keep going  
back to jail?  

Craig: I guess poor people  
always have a tendency to  
keep going back to jail be-  
cause we can't get the things  
we need.  

Doctor: You've been reading  
ALL the wrong literature.  
Craig: Reading? They wrote  
literature about me. Ever  
had mayonnaise sandwiches for  
lunch? Watched everybody  
else eat apples, cupcakes  

about the cover artist  

Constance Perenyi is a  
fiber artist living in Den-  
ver, CO. Her work ranges  
from functional pieces like  
backpacks, purses, and vests  
and other wearables that  
are pieced and stitched in  
vibrant, abstract patterns,  
to explicitly political wall  
hangings which are rich and  
powerful responses to the  
conditions of her/our world.  

Throughout all of her  
work is a sensitivity to the  
potential gut-level effect  
that color and form and  
pattern create. In the Life  
During Wartime Vest, the  
image of the vest, the tar-  
get, and the spattering of  
metallic paint give a  
strong, unfiltered feeling  
of tension, danger, and a  

basic fight for survival.  
Connie has recently been  
titling all her pieces  
(packs and vests as well as  
hangings) after new wave  
songs. Her understanding of  
new wave music has really  
gone hand in hand with the  
development of her art.  
"The strength and raw-edged  
energy of these political  
(musical) groups appeals  
to me a lot--their lyrics and  
sounds come from real life  
and a new sense of account-  
ability. I am convinced  
that it has true revolution-  
ary potential because it  
is angry, accessible, and  
relevant." That same emot-  
ion and energy is certainly  
there in Connie's work as  
well.

and bananas?  
Doctor: When I was little we  
had bacon grease sandwiches.  
Craig: So you stole, right?  
Doctor: Sometimes you sound  
just a hair grandiose...  
You're in sort of a miserable  
situation. You just  
sit here like a  

king. (To nurse:)  
Records show pat-  
ient gets angry  

when he is hungry.  
Nurse: He gets an-  
gry a lot. When he  

is hungry, when  

he's locked up...  
Doctor: (To Craig)  

Do you think we can  
help you in any way?  
Craig: Let me out.  
Doctor: I'm not real-  
ly clear about his  
legal status. Nor am  
I clear about his  
mental status. Let's  
call him an anti-  
social personality  
disorder 301.7 with  
dissocial behavior.  

cal impaction, bladder para-  
lysis, liver damage, impoten-  
cy, abnormal lactation, cere-  
bral edema, restlessness,  
drowsiness, eczema, lethar-  
gy. And more--some patients  
develop tardive dyskinesia,  

As a result of  
this interview  
Craig, who has al-  
ready spent 25  
days in jail for  
the crime of trespassing on  
his mother's property after  
she had barred him from the  
house (she was away when the  
crime occurred), has his sen-  
tence in the psychiatric hos-  
pital continued indefinitely,  
now with the added benefits  
of psychiatric "care"--we see  
him strapped tightly on a bed  
with leather restraints, re-  
covering from a massive in-  
jection of Thorazine, given  
because he refused to take  
his “medication.”  

Later we see the monthly  
meeting of the drug company  
salesmen and doctors. Says a  
Dow Chemical salesman, "Nap-  
alm, that's in the past.  
We're out of the war business  
now. We're in the health bus-  
iness." The truth of his as-  
sertion becomes somewhat dub-  
ious after we hear Wade Hud-  
son, a member of the Network  
Against Psychiatric Assault,  
describe the effects of the  
most commonly-prescribed psy-  
chiatric drugs, such as Thor-  
azine and Prolixin. Quoting  
from the literature of the  
drug company (in this case  
Squibb): hypertension severe  
enough to cause fatal cardiac  
arrest, induction of a cata-  
tonic-like state, asthma, fe-

an irreversible condition  
characterized by involuntary  
rhythmical movement of the  
jaw, face, mouth, and tongue.  
"Sudden and unexplained dea-  
ths have been reported."  

We meet other patients such  
as Jack, a fireman forced in-  
to early retirement due to a  
heart attack, who is now in-  
voluntarily incarcerated be-  
cause his wife says he's "de-  
pressed." And a young Chicano  
man barely able to stand up  
as a result of the drugs. His  
main symptom is that he thinks  
the hospital staff is  
trying to kill him. Luckily  
the hospital staff was unsuc-  
cessful in their attempts to  
have the film banned when it  
was first released in 1975.  
Showings of the film through-  
out California sparked a much  
publicized investigation of  
patient deaths in the state  
hospital system, leading to  
the inevitable whitewash by  
state officials. Although  
conditions shown in the film  
haven't changed, I left it  
feeling inspired rather than  
sad. Moments of caring bet-  
ween inmates and their flash-  
es of rebellion against a  
system set up to strip them  
of all humanity gives the vi-  
ewer a renewed sense of the  
possibilities of resistance.
