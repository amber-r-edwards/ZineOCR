New Seeds

Dear BMR,

The more I read of the Mich-
igan Women's Music Festival,
the more it sounds like a
monotone. I'm thankful I
haven't attended in the past,
and in reading a piece reject-
ed by Madness Network News on
emotional advocates at the
next fest, I'm sure as hell
glad I won't be there in the
future. The planned arm-
banded freak-out seekers
frighten me more than the
leather restraints I wore in
the 60's. (Though I wasn't
labeled "depressed" like
thousands of other women,
they called me "psychotic"
like millions of other vis-
ionaries.)

It seems that all that will
be lacking in Michigan with
this health police patrol are
dogs and helicopters to sniff
out deviants. How sad that
even the boys' cock rock con-
certs have a broader range
of alternatives to drugs and
cages than the Michigan ex-
periment. I don't understand
why feminists' visions fall
so short of possibilities. I
do know it takes more than
hugs and herbs and good in-
tentions to create non-
oppressive alternatives to
the therapeutic state.

On the same note, I found
the "woman of passion speech"
in your March issue shallow,
yet thought-provoking. I won-
dered what its author thought
we who choose to give our

love and energy to the psych-
iatric inmates liberation
movement are giving up. I'm
certainly giving up the pos-
sibility of getting locked up
or finding myself in a simi-
larly oppressive alternative
by sisters I work and love
with. I'm giving up being
thought of and addressed with
labels of psychopathology as
well as hearing the thriving
psychobabble so familiar in
other political movements.
I'm giving up having to ex-
plain what it feels like to
live in a cage to women who'd
prefer to hear about my ex-
periences from a therapist
in book form, who further
wish I'd visit the local fem-
inist shrink center for
"help" with my anger. And
I'm especially giving up
being nice and begging for
understanding and sensitivity
from a group who, with some
exceptions, froze their ide-
ology around 1972 when Women
and Madness hit the stands.
What I wish I could have
given up also are the con-
stant struggles within the
movement I love. These have
to do with racism, classism,
heterosexism, sexism, and
personality clashes. I admit
that I don't get along well
with classist ex-inmates who
continuously remind me of
their "impressive" publica-
tion history or their prior
status in Who's Who. I'm po-
lite enough not to boast of
my prior store clerk career
and how many clothes I folded.
And how about those who
think that the verbal skills

they picked up at Harvard
entitle them to speak for us
all on public radio, while
they dismiss thoughtful cri-
ticism as trashing? I have
trouble with the ex-inmate
opportunist who drops by the
movement for coffee and do-
nuts and thinks she has in-
tegrated our ideology enough
to write a PhD on the stig-
matization of identity poli-
tics. I resent it when a loud,
dominating, self-centered
male thinks it's my lesbian-
ism rather than his relation-
ship to lesbianism in general
which prevents us from effec-
tively communicating. I con-
sider such behavior “inap-
propriate." This considera-
tion has nothing to do with
“internalized oppression,”
but rather the external
oppression we experience as
politically active ex-inmates.

It's difficult working in
any movement for social
change. I'm where I feel the
most useful and respected.
The psychiatric inmates lib-
eration movement is certain-
ly no place to hide, but
rather a place to expose
atrocities. At times this
involves going public about
who we are and where we've
been in an effort to change
consciousness and influence
legislation. And some days
this work is not that attrac-
tive—for there is the pain,
the frustration—even hope-
lessness while the shock,
poisons, and psychiatrically-
induced deaths continue each
moment hidden behind locked
doors.

The rewards for many of us
outweigh the struggles. To be
part of a huge demonstration
against shock torture in
Berkeley, or against the
American Psychiatric Associa-
tion in San Francisco is
exhilarating. To hear from
sisters and brothers strug-
gling with similar issues in
the Netherlands, Zambia, Fin-
land, Argentina, England,
Australia, and North Dakota
reinforces my belief that
this work has importance,
that an autonomous movement
is necessary, and that we
continue to protest. And
though the in-fighting can
detract from the joy I feel
as we move one tiny step
closer to the human dignity
and freedom we demand, there
is still this underlying
unity. There is this connec-
tion reminding us we're not
alone, that the labels, cages,
poisons, and electrocutions
will cease, the therapeutic
state crumble (including the

sorry excuses for alterna-
tives we're not witnessing),
and that out of our individ-
ual and collective outrage,
negative as it appears to
onlookers, will come new
seeds of possibility.

Sincerely,

Sisters -

Your April issue is amaz-
ing, challenging, informative
and truly inspiring!! I espec-
ially appreciate Lois Anne
Addison's article "Politically
Correct Lesbians Make Connec-
tions to Many Peoples' Fights"
(ed. note: actually, it's
"Politically Concerned Les-
bians...") - it is clear, free
of rhetoric, and very encour-
aging. I am following several

of her suggestions.

Articles on psychosurgery,
especially the educational
one by Jenny Miller affected
me deeply—I found myself
shaking with rage and horror.

I've not even finished
reading the entire issue—
wanted to write and say—
thank you for all the work
and energy you sisters put
into BMR!

Bright Blessings,

Dear Big Mama Rag:

Jalna Hanmer, Diane Hudson
and Sheila Saunders are three
British women who, along with
their children, form a house-
hold in West Yorkshire (Eng-
land). Two are educators; the
third is a social worker.

They are members of the Bri-
tish Sociological Association
and of Women's Aid (a shelter
for battered women and child-
ren). They have been outspoken
about what they believe is a
disregard on the part of lo-
cal police for domestic vio-
lence and its victims.

On February 9, after two
previous incidents of harass-
ment, six members of the West
Yorkshire police force enter-
ed and searched the women's
home. They interrogated the
women about their lifestyle;
political and religious views;
