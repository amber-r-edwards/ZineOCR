Women

of Iran

Returning to Islamic Nationalism

Judy Barlow

During the last several months
women in Iran have lost most of the
rights they have gained during the
last 30 years.

*There has been a news blackout
around women's issues in Iran.

*Women have been asked to return
to a mode of dress that was pop-
ular 1000 years ago.

*Women newscasters have been re-
placed by men.

*Kate Millett was forcibly ejected
from Iran, presumably because she
is not an Iranian and is an advo-
cate of women's rights.

The loss of women's rights in Iran
is more of a religious and political
issue than it is a feminist issue.
In order to understand the true sig-
nificance of what has happened to
women in Iran, one must examine the
Shah's overthrow and subsequent Is-
lamic government of the Ayatollah
Khomeini and Prime Minister Bakhtiar
has meant to Iran.

Although the Shah's monarchy was
guilty of many gross violations of
human rights, women gained much dur-
ing his regime. But it was more as
a result of Western influence than
the will of the Shah that women's
position was elevated. Many women
shed their traditional dress (com-
plete with veils) in favor of less
confining (Western) clothing. Many
women took jobs that had tradition-
ally gone to men or had previously
(before Western influence) not
existed.

Rally Held

Fran Day

A rally to support the women of
Iran was held Friday, March 23 at
St. Cajetan's Church on the Auraria
Campus. Convened by Congresswoman
Pat Schroeder and co-sponsored by
C.C.S., the rally was attended by
about 30 people. The event provided
an opportunity for three distinct
positions on the current status of
Iranian women to be presented.

Pat Schroeder's position was inher-
ent in her two requests: an end to
all violence in Iran and support for
women's rights in Iran. Schroeder
had earlier proposed that a petition
be addressed to Patricia Derian,
Assistant Secretary for Human Rights
and Humanitarian Affairs (a part of
the Agency for International Devel-
opment).

Picket signs and chants vehemently
expressed the second position: "De-
fend Women's Rights--Get the U.S. Out
of Iran!" Led by the Socialist Work-
ers Party, this group communicated
its views through leaflets, talking
to individuals and later through use
of the mike. They feel that American
supporters of women's rights can show
their solidarity with their Iranian
sisters by pressuring the U.S. gov-
ernment to stay out of Iran. Iranian
women and men will then be free to
determine for themselves the course
of their new society. U.S. govern-

ment intervention presents a threat
to the Iranian women's struggle for
equality. The U.S. government has
never supported women's rights in
Iran (or in the U.S. for that mat-
ter). It is U.S. business interests
and military bases in Iran, not the
rights of Iranian women, that deter-
mine the direction of U.S. inter-
vention.

The third position presented at the
rally was that held by a group of
Iranian male students. This position
was later clarified through an inter-
view of an Iranian woman who is a
student at CU. This position holds
that Iranian women are now free and
equal; they currently have more
rights than men. There are three
explanations for the women's demon-
strations in Iran. First, the women
who are marching are a small minority
and do not represent all Iranian
women. Secondly, a few women were
benefited by the Shah's reign; these
women want to make Khomeini look bad
by creating a disturbance. Third,
the U.S. media distorted the demon-
stration in order to discourage hope
that revolution works. This dis-
tortion included not only over-em-
phasizing the Iranian women's pro-
tests but also overlooking a larger,
peaceful demonstration of support for
the new government.

It is important to note that not
all women in Iran benefited from the
upward mobility of some women. Rural
women and those without money or in-
fluence gained little or nothing dur-
ing the Shah's reign. It appears
that only those who supported the
Shah and were of the upper class ben-
efited. Therefore, fighting to re-
gain women's rights in Iran would be
synonymous with restoring the rich to
power.

The rich in Iran were the allies of
foreigners who have dominated and ex-
ploited Iran. Revenue increased be-
cause of the vast deposits of oil in
Iran. The Shah's tyranny increased
proportionately with the increase in
his oil income and his increase in
U.S.-supplied armed forces.

The Shah's regime oppressed both
Moslem activists and members of the
Tudeh, Iran's communist party. The
world will probably never know the
extent of inhumanities and tortures
used against his opposition. Many
died in torture chambers or were ex-
ecuted while protesting in the
streets.

What is important to note is that
the Shah's gross inhumanities were
seen as a result of Western in-
fluence.

In Iran, women's rights are seen as
an extension of Westernism. That is,
women's upward movement was seen pri-
marily in larger cities where Western
influence was greatest. Along with
women's rights, Western culture pro-
vided Iran with imperialist exploit-
ation, weapons, and torture prisons.

The Ayatollah Khomeini has spoken
out against both capitalism and com-
munism (both of which are seen as
Western) in favor of Islamic nation-
alism. Islam provides a means not
only for political activism, but also
a chance to show disillusionment with
communism (which so far has promised
more than it has delivered) and cap-
italism, which many believe has
brought moral decadence.

The doctrine of Islam is the Koran.
The Koran was given to Mohammed 1300
years ago as the word of Allah. It
dictates not only how Mohammed's fol-
lowers should behave, but also estab-
lishes laws and even their just pun-
ishments. The Ayatollah has promised
a government which is dictated by the
Koran.

The fourth chapter of the Koran is
entitled "Women." Here basic ine-
qualities between men and women are
illustrated.

“Men have authority over women
because Allah has made the one
superior to the other. Good
women are obedient. They guard
their unseen parts because Allah
has guarded them. As for those
from whom you fear disobedience,
admonish them and send them to
beds apart and beat them."
Koran, 4:34.

"If any of your women commit
fornication, call in four wit-
nesses from among yourselves
against them; if they testify to
the guilt confine them to their
houses till death overtakes them
or Allah finds another way for
them."

Koran, 4:11.

"A male shall inherit twice as
much as a female."
Koran, 4:11.

This passage alone shows that for-
eign involvement (both capitalism and
communism) will not be tolerated by
the government of Iran.

The Ayatollah has accused American
feminists such as Kate Millett and
Gloria Steinem of behaving like imper-
ialists for trying to force their
beliefs about women's rights on the
people of Iran. If the women of Iran
are to achieve a higher status within
the confines of the Islamic state, it
must come from changes within Iran.

An understanding of the Islamic
state and of women's position within
it is very important because similar
overthrows of western-style govern-
ments in favor of Islamic nationalism
are possible if not likely throughout
Africa and Asia.
