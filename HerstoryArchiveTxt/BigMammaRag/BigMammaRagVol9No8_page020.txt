Letting Go: Invest No More In Patriarchy

Evelyn Green

As a black radical lesbian
feminist, I have long felt a
need to express myself on
the non-issue of racism in
feminism. I feel it is nec-
essary to lovingly admonish,
but nonetheless admonish,
feminists:

-white feminists who con-
tinue to include ethnic, pat-
riarchal, cultural rituals
in order to be perceived as
liberal and non-racists, and
to appease their own interna-
lized guilt, (e.g. This Sep-
tember the Planning Committ-

Struggle

ee of the Women Against
Violence Conference changed
around a major part of the
schedule to include Yom
Kippur worship celebrations;)

-feminists of color who are
still using white patriarcha-
lly owned guilt as a tool to
manipulate their white sis-
ters, (i.e. Audre Lorde who
reviewed and endorsed an ar-
ticle written in Sinister
Wisdom discrediting Mary
Daly's book, Gyn/Ecology,
as racist.)

I would begin by saying
that the attitude of racism
is a patriarchal cultural
phenomenon. That is, racism
is an aspect of the complete
disrespect for the diversity
of the earth. It is in its
genocidal form, the homogen-
izing of the earth (e.g.
sterilizing third world wo-
men, killing the many spec-
ies on the earth, etc.) In
an environment in which the
power and fertility of the
Mother Goddess Earth is re-
cognized, then also her many
diverse and splendid crea-
tions are respected and rev-
ered. Therefore, any woman
who calls herself a feminist
but continues to be racist
on any deep level, is not
a feminist. These two ways
of being are incompatible. A
feminist either rejoices in
the female, in her many div-
erse forms, colors, experi-
ences, perceptions; or is
non-feminist and does not.
This applies to White, Black,
Asian and Chicana feminists.

When a woman is raped,
whether that rape happens on
her father's posturpedic mat-
tress, in a cotton field in
Alabama, in a Harlem alley
or in a migrant labor camp,

it is still rape.

When rape happens to a wo-
man, she is brutalized on ma-
ny levels. On the physical
level she is often beaten
or mutilated, as well as be-
ing forced into intercourse
by the male rapist. On
a psychic level, she is bru-
talized for she cannot know
this will never happen again,
and it often does. There is
no room in a patriarchal so-
ciety for the protection of
women. She is brutalized on a
spiritual level for we all
know that within the context
of the patriarchal spiritu-
ality, rape is always the wo-
man’s fault. When a woman is
raped, no matter which patri-
archal clan (read "culture"),
she "belongs" to, then as a
culture of women, we are ran-
ped. (When I speak of culture
here, I don't speak of the
patriarchal anthropologists’
culture which studies the br-
oken pots of broken cultures
in which women have died at
the hands of their patriar-
chal forefathers. I do spe-
ak of the living, being, sp-
eaking culture of women that
must live and recreate each
moment, each day, in spite of
the worldwide culture of pat-
riarchy).

We have manifestations of
rape of our culture on all
levels. The psychic manifes-
tation of this rape is the
fear that women have in walk-
ing the streets, both day
and night. In the collective
sense this psychic rape man-
ifests itself in the fear of
"nuclear war." The physical
manifestation of this rape
is women not having control
over their own bodies (i.e.,

unhealthy means of birth con-
trol created by men, anti-
abortion laws and being tau-
ght we can only be touched in
a limited way and that way
includes having intercourse
with men.) Finally, on a sp-
iritual level the rape mani-
fests itself in the continual
rape of matriarchal divinity.
There are many more deep lev-
els of the cultural rape of
women, the above are but a
few.

Considering the gravity of
the world situation of women,
(i.e., veiled, genitally mut-
ilated Muslim women, Indian
sutee, the practice of west-
ern gynecology, See Mary Daly,
Gyn/Ecology, Beacon Press,
1978), it would appear that

an attitude of racism held
by a feminist deflects her
much needed energies away
from her sisters and herself
into that mass of misogyny;
i.e., governments, KKK, pol-
itical parties, "right to
lifers," the church etc.,
which seeks to destroy her.
We must remember that no
matter what color the "man"
is he is the oppressor. Just
as white male patriarchy fe-
eds on the lives of oppressed
peoples, so the world culture
of patriarchy feeds on the
lives of women. I have trav-
eled extensively abroad and
no matter what color the man
is who is in power, he cont-
inues to oppress women. He
or they do this through the
oppression of women in their
personal life; which is LIFE.
Male revolutionists wish to
replace the male in power and
become the new director of wh-
ere and to whom women's en-
ergies should be spent. Never
do they consider returning the
power of our lives to our fe-
male selves. National liber-
ation struggles and the role
and position of men is anoth-
er article. The main point we
are making is that men (even
in national liberation move-
ments) take women's lives
over which is life. Remember,

gy. She writes: It is axio-
matic for Amazons that all ex-
ternal/internalized influences,
such as myths, names, ideo-
logies, social structures,
which cut off the flow of se-
lf's original movement should
be pared away.

What can we as feminists do
in order to separate from our-
selves that which keeps us in
the grip of men? There are se-
veral ways; first for white
feminists:

-Stop alienating other fa-
cets of your female selves
by insisting on white patria-
rchal structures and proces-
ses in your organizations.
White feminist organizations
continue to follow a strict
decision-making process using
Roberts Rules of Order, pre-
pared agenda items and uncom-
promising timetables. Such
processes split women off from
their emotions and invalidate
a woman's emotional self.

The above is certainly not
the decision-making process
for many women of color. Rath-
er than following "Roberts
Rules of Order" in a meeting,
they may sit, and argue and
discuss many sides of an is-
sue for several hours, maybe
even days. In such a process
they educate other women ab-
out the truth of their posit-
ion. These discussions may be
heated and emotional rather
than practical and logical.
-Start learning to share
differently. It goes without
saying that white feminists
have reaped a certain amount
of material benefits as well
as status for being the same
color as white males. Wh-
ite feminists continue to in-
vest their money in the pat-

riarchy, i.e., banks, mortg-

shelters for only two
women, alcohol, cigarettes,

every man is promised, if not
the presidency, management,
directorship etc., the right
to be "king" in his home and
to own a vagina and the prod-
ucts of that vagina.

There are many ways in which
racist behaviors on the part
of feminists can be separated
from themselves. Even though
as children we are taught an
attitude and grow up to find
it false, the behavior resul-
ting from the learned attit-
ude may still continue. Mary
Daly speaks of the movement
away from patriarchal behavior
into our own life, living,
being, in her book Gyn/Ecolo-

conferences, "women's busin-
esses," women's banks, etc.
This is not supportive of a
feminist-female way of being-
becoming.

Some areas white feminists
could begin to invest in are:
women's land trusts, sponsor-
ing tribal/spiritual gather-
ings, feminist schools for
girls, natural food co-ops and
collective parenting, to name

a few. Feminist schools
implies developing environ-
ments where our daughters
won't be injured as we were
by the patriarchy. It is the
end of the sacrifice of the
