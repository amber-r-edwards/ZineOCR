Nestle Boycott

While the passage of the  
World Health Organization  
(WHO) code is a victory,  
there is no way to enforce  
its standards. Nestle has re-  
fused to change its practices  
voluntarily to abide by the  
WHO Code. (Nestle claims to  
agree with the code's broad  
aim but refuses to follow  
the specific requirements of  
its provisions.)

For the past 34 months,  
Nestle has refused to meet  
with INFACT and its support-  
ers. It is clear that Nestle  
and the Reagan administration  
put profit before people, and  
will be most effectively at-  
tacked by a continued boycott  
campaign which will hit them  
where it hurts the most - in  
sales.

Conference

psychiatrists. Issues of  
leadership at the conference  
were muddled in a confused  
objection to "professional-  
ism". More defined objec-  
tions to the participation of  
trained shrinks and social  
workers, especially those who  
work in or administrate in  
locked ward situations, were  
confused with how we felt  
about ex-inmates involved in  
advocacy work and other "lay  
professional skills.

Lots of work was done (both  
personal and political) in  
furthering the political  
growth of our movement against  
psychiatric oppression. I  
took part in my first demon-  
stration against the very ex-  
istence of psychiatric insti-  
tutions, which really felt  
good...to be on the outside,  
screaming in. The final full  
day of the conference brought  
the participants into Cleve-  
land, to the state university;  
for a press conference, a pub-  
lic tribunal, a speakout, and  
a picket and demonstration  
at Fairhill, an Ohio psychia-  
tric institution.

Workshops struggled with  
the pressures that people who  
were still in therapy, or  
still making some use of psy-  
chiatric drugs, were feeling  
to abandon these last ties  
with psychiatry. And yet we  
were determined to build a  
movement that supports any  
current or ex-inmate, what

the three U.S. baby formula  
firms (American Home Products,  
Bristol Myers, Abbott Labs)  
which lobbied the Reagan Ad-  
ministration to oppose the  
WHO code, and which have pub-  
licly denounced the code.

The Nestle Boycott seeks  
to stop the company's aggre-  
ssive marketing and promotion  
of infant formulas especially  
under conditions of poverty.  
The world health community  
agreed that such promotion  
persuades women to abandon  
breastfeeding and thus leads  
to infections, malnutrition,  
and even death of millions  
of infants, especially in  
developing countries. Nestle  
controls between 40-50% of  
the estimated $1.72 billion  
Third World infant formula  
market.

ever their needs are now.  
Working in coalition with  
other movements and working  
on our own racism and sexism  
in our own movement were the  
subjects of workshops. There  
are already strong bonds be-  
tween some ex-inmate organi-  
zations and the differently  
abled movement and the anti-  
prison movement. Making fur-  
ther coalitions which shared  
certain issues with us were  
tactically discussed. It  
seemed that the best way to  
make contact is around econo-  
mic/survival issues. Our own  
racism, for example, was  
thought to be best attacked  
by first giving support to  
the Black Liberation Movement  
around their own issues, con-  
necting through survival issues.  
While simultaneously recogni-  
zing the necessity of con-  
fronting racism in ourselves.  
Sexism was raised as ano-  
ther priority issue (with  
racism) amid cries that there  
was no sexism in the movement.  
The issue of sexism was a  
more invisible issue, only  
because it was obvious how  
little women and men of color  
give input into the movement.  
There were lots of  
women at the conference. One  
man asked me at the workshop  
if I would go back to the fe-  
minist movement and make the  
issue of psychiatric oppres-  
sion a priority. The re-

There is no gymnasium &

making a priority of feminism  
in your ex-inmate organiza-  
tions. The struggle is on.

So here I am back at BMR,  
overwhelmed by struggles go-  
ing on in the feminist com-  
munity (racism, anti-semitism,  
professionalism). Wondering  
how the hell I integrate my  
feminist struggles with the  
demands from the conference.  
Not that the demands from  
feminism and anti-psychiatry  
are in opposition to one ano-  
ther (demanding the right to  
control our bodies and minds),  
in fact it seems like the two  
movements should be very close.  
Except for the unfortunate  
fact that feminism has not  
generated any support for  
psychiatric issues as present-  
ed by the Mental Patients Lib-  
eration Movement.

I want to be with ex-inmates  
and I want to be with femi-  
nists; and in Denver right  
now, as in the feminist com-  
munity there is just no easy  
way to fill these needs. But  
I am not giving up. The po-  
tential alliance between femi-  
nism and Mental Patients Lib  
feels so natural to me. Move-  
ments need to be able to learn  
from one another, something  
we haven't done enough of.

The fact that ex-inmates are  
running inmate controlled al-  
ternatives to the "mental  
health system", seems like it  
could say something to femi-  
nists on the subject of esta-  

“about the  
cover artist

Faith Ringgold (b. 1934)  
is an artist interested in  
capturing "the conceptual vi-  
sions of the Black image in-  
herent in the sculpture and  
masks of African art".

Ringgold has long been in-  
volved in the struggle for  
equality for women, and she  
feels that her most profound  
artistic contribution has  
been in women's art: "My art  
is for everyone but it is  
about me (my sisters)." In  
Aunts Edith and Bessie, from  
her Family of Women series,  
Ringgold shapes soft, pliable  
materials into life-sized hu-  
man figures; the open mouths  
of these two subjects are  
meant to symbolize the need  
for women to speak out for  

themselves.  
There will be a show of Faith  
Ringgold's work at the U. of  
Colorado at Boulder in early  
October. She will be in town  
and will do a Mask perform-  
ance. Call the U. for more

women, just as for instance. I  
challenge the feminist movement  
to learn about psychiatric  
oppression through the voices  
and experiences of ex-inmates,  
to take responsibility for  
educating yourselves on the  
issues, and for confronting  
attitudes and behaviors that  
oppress women and men who  
have been used and abused by  
the system of psychiatry.
