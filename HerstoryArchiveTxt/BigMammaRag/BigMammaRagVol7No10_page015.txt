X-rays are discovered.  
(X, it is explained, is a  
symbol for the unknown.)  
Radium is isolated. (It  
is observed that one gram  
of radium creates one hun-  
dred calories of heat in  
one hour: the sun radiates  
light; it will burn itself  
out much more slowly.)  
Radioactivity is explained  
as the disintegration  
of the atom. The atom, it  
is agreed finally, is not  
immutable.

Time divides and measured.  
Time marked by events.  
As in history. As in the  
history of its events. As  
in the Battle of Thermopy-  
lae. As in the First Pu-  
nic War. As in the Pelo-  
ponnesian Wars. The Sack  
of Rome. The Norman Con-  
quest. The Conquests of  
Charlemagne. As in the  
Crusades. As in the Hun-  
dred Years' War. The War  
of the Roses. The Thirty  
Years' War. The Seven  
Years' War. The American  
Revolution...

In defense of this opera-  
tion, to cut away the moun-  
taintop (one hundred and  
five tons in the bucket of  
the steam shovel) to re-  
veal the seam of coal (the  
cliff exposed, like an un-  
finished road, like a wash-  
board, topsoil carried away,  
slate and pyrite exposed)  
they cited a vital contribu-  
tion to this nation.

In defense of this opera-  
tion, to cut into her womb  
(an incision made diagonal-  
ly under her navel, across  
her abdomen or vertically  
under her navel to her pu-  
bis, or vertically to the  
right and below her navel)  
they cited his eternal  
soul. In defense of this  
decision (hemorrhage from  
the uterus into the abdomi-  
nal cavity, severe pains,  
severe shock, infection of  
the wounds) they mentioned  
charity over justice.

The meson is discovered,  
the lambda, the sigma, the  
eta, the muon, pion, cas-  
cade, kaon, are discovered.

Thirty kinds of elementary  
particles are discovered.

It is suggested that the  
elementary particles may  
not be fundamental. Man's  
notion of nature is again  
threatened. Her face is  
changing, it is said. And  
it is suggested that a  
structure invisible to  
measurement is beneath the  
particles.

It is said that from what is known of the nature of matter, there is no way Vol. 7 No. 10  
to make a picture, no image is possible.

And it is written that the idiosyncrasies of a mental life cannot be pic-  
tured.

(That the nature of the universe is not accessible to the untrained mind,  
nor the nature of the psyche to the uninitiated.)

Under the gaze of science, it is said, all the basic units of matter shed  
their substance.

It is declared that it is absolutely and forever impossible to determine the  
position and velocity of an electron at the same time. (That the observer  
changes what is observed.)

Thus it is clear that science will never know the position of all the part-  
icles in the universe and that science cannot forecast the history of the  
universe for all time.

WHEN YOU SAY “T Y TRANSMISSIONS,”  
IT'S SAFE.

BUT WHEN YOU SAY “MICROWAVE,”  

EVERYONE JUMPS.

Space Divided by Separations, as in separate corridors  
(are provided for the guards and the prisoners) or each  
floor is separated from the other floor, or there are eight  
separate cell blocks, or the dining room has two separate  
entrances (so that the classes of inmates may be kept  
separate) or there are several separate cottages (a cottage  
for colored girls, a cottage for the younger girls, a  
cottage for the older women, a cottage for the women on the  
honor roll, a cottage for women being disciplined, a cottage  
for the incorrigible), or as in separation is enforced (in  
the Auburn system by a rule of silence, and because the in-  
mates must keep their eyes downward and walk in lockstep.)

The scientists are in a  
box. There are no windows.  
Nothing tells them which  
side is up: The walls are  
empty. The ceiling and  
the floor are the same.  
They are standing in a per-  
fect cube. Every surface is  
a square. This they mea-  
sure and prove with their  
rulers.
