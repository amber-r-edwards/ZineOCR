Genital Mutilation of Somalian Women

Judy Barlow

"The Somalian government has given
women equal rights," said Ambassador
Abdirozak Haji Hussein of Somalia.
Nevertheless, millions of women and
girls (including the ambassador's
wife and daughters) suffer genital
mutilation at the hands of their own
families. Most of these operations
are done in the home. A few are now
done in government hospitals. Over
75% of rural African women have been
victims of these surgical procedures.

In one operation, clitorectomy, the
clitoris and adjacent tissue is re-
moved. In infibulation the whole of
the clitoris and labia minora, and at
least two-thirds of the labia majora
are removed. The two sides of the
vagina are stitched together with
silk, catgut, or thorns.

Infibulation of women in Somalia is
not “much less than universal," said
Dr. R. Cook, a regional World Health
Organization (WHO) advisor.

Infibulation in Somalia is usually
done in the home under much less than
sanitary conditions. Most victims
are female children between 4 and 8.
The surgery and subsequent care are
usually done by older neighborhood
and family women.

"I didn't know what was happening,"
a Somalian woman named Fatuma, who
now lives in England said. "They
pulled my legs apart and held them
open. A big old woman sat down
facing me. She took out a knife,
grabbed hold of my clitoris, and
started cutting me. I tried to free
myself and screamed and screamed.
The last thing I remember was blood
all over spurting from between my
legs. Then I passed out.”

After the surgical procedure, the
girl is tied down and must remain
motionless until the wound heals,
closing off the vagina except for a
tiny opening to pass urine and later
menstrual blood.

The results of these mutilations
are frequently heavy bleeding and
infections such as tetanus often
result from the use of dirty tools.
Most of the operations are not done
under anesthesia, and sterile instru-
ments are uncommon. Deaths due to
infibulation are not recorded.

If the wound does not heal properly
or if the opening is not small enough
(it must not be larger than a kernel
of corn), the child is cut again.

The older women insist on it.

In Somalia, a female's only purpose
in life is to marry and bear children.
In order to marry, virginity must be
visibly proven. The woman is inspec-
ted by the female relatives of the
man who has purchased her as his
wife. The smaller the opening, the
higher the price of the woman is.
When the wedding takes place “it
is usually necessary for the bride
to be cut open--usually with a knife,
sharp stone, or razor--because no
man can penetrate the artificial
barrier." Intercourse takes place
at once and then frequently to keep
the wound from closing again. Bloody
sheets are hung from the window to
show the neighbors that the bride-
groom got his money's worth.

In Somalia, as in many other
African and Moslem countries, genital
mutilation operations are considered
necessary for the preservation of
the family. The clitoris is regarded
as a vile attribute that allows women
sexual pleasure. After infibulation,
sexual relations are not only un-
pleasurable, but are also often quite
painful.

Part of the midwife training in
Somalia is learning to cut open the
women so they can give birth. The
cut made to allow intercourse is not
large enough to allow childbirth.
Without medical assistance during
childbirth, both the mother and
infant die.

After childbirth, the woman is
usually sewn up again--frequently at
the husband's request because it
makes intercourse more pleasurable
for him. Wives sometimes request
these repair operations as the alter-
native is frequently divorce. When
a woman has another child, the whole
process of cutting and sewing begins
again.

Polygamy is the law in Somalia--that
is a man may have as many as four
wives. Only by having children does
a woman achieve some sense of securi-
ty. If a woman is unable or unwill-
ing to have children, her husband
does not even have to file for divor-
ce. The marriage is annulled. To a
woman, divorce means the loss of her
children, her home, and total dis-
grace.

Equal rights for women in Somalia
seem to include only the right to an
education. But, even here, the decis-
ion is not the woman's, but rather
her father's if she is unmarried or
her husband's if she is married.

It appears as though the Somalian
government has granted women “equal
rights" as part of a ploy for getting
U.S. government aid under President
Carter's human rights doctrine. The
Somalian government has outlawed
tribal feuds and blood revenge
(destructive customs that affect men)
and has taught women to read. But
mutilation of the women's genitals
and the position of women as men's
personal property continue. Women's
education does not include the fact
that only a very small percentage of
the world's women are infibulated.
Women all over Africa who were inter-
viewed by a reporter from Women's
International Network News were con-
vinced that these mutilations are
essential and are practiced world-
wide. They laughed when they were
told that this is not so.
