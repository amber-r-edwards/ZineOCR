Lifestyle “Poor Judgement”

Lesbian Mother Loses Son

Woodwoman

Mary Jo Risher, a 38-year-old
nurse, was denied custody of her
9-year-old son Richard in
December last year, after he had
lived with her for almost four
years.

In a Dallas, Texas Domestic
Relations Court, a jury com-
prising ten men and two women
decided that a ‘material and
substantial change’ had oc-
curred in Risher’s home, which
warranted the removal of
Richard from her custody. That
change was her homosexual
relationship with Ann Foreman,
a 29-year-old bank auditor.

The case has aroused national
interest because this is the first
time in American jurisprudence
that parental fitness has been
predicated on the issue of sexual
preference alone.

Risher had had custody of her
two sons since her divorce from
Douglas Risher in 1971. In 1973
she and Ann Foreman began
living together. Foreman’s 10-
year-old daughter lived with
them.

The following year Risher's
eldest son Jimmy, now 17, left
home and went to live with his
grandmother. Jimmy, who has
since moved into his father’s
home, claims that he left be-
cause he was embarrassed by
his mother’s lesbianism. This
testimony contradicts his earlier
statement, at a hearing, that her
homosexuality was “not rele-
vant.” Risher contends he was
seduced away by his father’s
promise of a car she couldn't
afford to buy him.

Lesbianism Admissible

Shortly after Jimmy’s leaving,
Douglas Risher threatened Mary
Jo: “The world is going to know
what you are... I’m going to
see to it.” Not long after that, he
instituted legal proceedings to
win custody of Richard away
from her. Allegations of beatings
and malnutrition were dropped
after investigations proved them
groundless, and at an early
hearing, the issue of homo-
sexuality was barred as a basis
for the immediate transfer of the
children.

Later, however, Judge Oswin
Chrisman ruled in Dallas
Domestic Relations Court that
any act, circumstance or event
dealing with children or any life-
style likely to affect children
could be entered as evidence.
This ruling made Risher’s
lesbianism admissible evidence
in the ensuing custody battle.

Even before the legal wrangl-
ing began, Risher had sought
professional guidance to en-
sure that her home was a
healthy environment for her
children. Psychiatrists and psy-
chologists who evaluated all
members of the family unit
found it secure, stable and
loving. Richard was examined
and found to be healthy and well
cared for. Three psychologists
testified that Risher is an exem-
plary mother, that Richard’s
home environment was satis-
factory in every way, and that to
move him would be likely to
disturb him.

Father's Argument

Douglas Risher has re-
married, and contends that
Richard would be better raised in
his home, where he would have
a male model and a stepmother
who “could be there to attend to
his needs 24 hours a day.” He
admitted, under cross examina-
tion, that he had been convicted
for drunken driving in 1971; that
he had broken Mary Jo's nose
during a marital argument; and
that, before remarrying, he had
paid for an 18-year-old woman's
abortion when confronted by her
father.

Mr. Risher’s attorney in-
troduced as witness a Baptist
minister (the population of
Dallas is over 50% Southern
Baptist), who condemned homo-
sexuality along with smoking,
drinking, dancing and sex out-
side marriage.

A court-appointed psy-
chologist called Risher’s sexual
preference “poor judgement.”
He feared that Richard was
being adversely affected by her
lesbian relationship because he
had appeared for appointments
wearing jeans and a jacket
belonging to Foreman’s
daughter, and a YWCA t-shirt.
Although he admitted that such
androgynous clothing was not
especially remarkable on a 9-
year-old boy, the psychologist
asserted that “Mary Jo was a
lesbian and should be more
sensitive to the appearance of
Richard wearing such items.”

Jury’s Reasoning

After the jury returned its
decision that Richard should live
with his father, the foreman said
that “it was a lifestyle of a
lesbian that most jurors felt
affected the trial” (at the time of
jury selection, members had
sworn that they had no know-
ledge of, or would not be pre-
judiced towards a lesbian life-
style). “I felt we were taking him
out of a good home just to put
him in a better one,” he con-
tinued. “Not having a man there
all the time had an effect on the
decision.”

Risher’s attorneys are appeal-
ing the decision. Should the
Supreme Court rule, its decision
would clarify for once and for all
the law regarding homosexual
parents and custody.

The National Organization of
Women’s National Taskforce on
Lesbianism and Sexuality has
been organizing fundraising and
publicity efforts around the
Risher case. Contributions
should be sent to Mary Jo Risher
Fund, c/o Dallas County N.O.W.,

CU Affirmative Action Plan Lagging

Andrea Monk

Affirmative action is not work-
ing because it is not yet being
taken seriously.

Recent studies have shown
that private industry performs
best in regard to affirmative
action, state governments are
next, while educational institu-
tions have the poorest record.
But the sleeping educational
giant is stirring in Colorado, as
the University of Colorado
begins to change its affirmative
action policies.

Universities have historically
been reluctant to relinquish
their “ivory tower status”
enough to take seriously the
social reforms that their
scholars analyze. The people
who run colleges and univer-
sities see them as places where
students can peacefully pursue
knowledge for its own sake.

Attempts to regulate univer-
sity practices, including hiring
policies, are viewed as danger-
ous assaults on professional
standards.

No Quotas

For instance, at the University
of Colorado, each academic
department is entirely respon-
sible for its own hiring. Al-
though, as an institution re-
ceiving federal monies, the
University is technically re-
quired to draw up and follow an
affirmative action timetable for
the hiring of women and
minorities, none of the depart-
ments follow any quotas in their
hiring. Recently, women's
groups have been protesting the
fact that the University of
Colorado Law School has only
one (part-time) female faculty
member.

According to one long-time CU
faculty member, “The depart-
ment decides who it likes and
then tries to decide how they can
hire him.” This professor also
says that the department chair-
man exercises great power in
deciding who is hired.

In most CU departments,
hiring is done by a committee
elected by the members of the
department. Since most depart-
ments have few women or
minority faculty members, this
procedure insures a vicious cir-
cle — department members are
not eager to have socially-con-
scious women or minorities
“causing trouble” in their
department.

Power

If a minority or woman from
outside the department is al-
lowed on the committee, he or she is
only an “advisory” member,
with no voting power. Last fall
the black male ex officio member
of the Admissions Committee of
the CU School of Law resigned,
because, according to the
Colorado Daily, he did not think
his recommendations were be-
ing taken seriously.

The only curb on the academic
departments’ power is the
University of Colorado's
Affirmative Action Office, which
may be getting more power.

A new regulation which be-
came effective in December, re-
quires departments’ faculty
search committees to report to
this Office whenever there is a
faculty opening, and requires
each committee to include both
minorities and women, even if
they must be recruited from out-
side of the University.

Negative Inaction

Whether these regulations
will do much good is question-
able. The Affirmative Action
Office does not have the staff or
funds to monitor each depart-
ment’s hiring practices in de-
tail. Nor do they have access to
information that would help
them decide whether a can-
didate is being discriminated
against on the basis of sex, race,
or political beliefs, owing to
University regulations regard-
ing confidentiality of personal
information. In absence of close
monitoring by the Affirmative
Action Office, department chair-
men may choose to simply
ignore the rulings.

But the new regulation is a
step in the right direction. The
University may be recognizing
that “neutral” policies that
merely prohibit discrimination
are anything but neutral — they
perpetuate society's existing in-
equalities.

Women’s House
Endangered

Kim Womantree

Women in Transition House,
1895 Lafayette St. in Denver has
been a women’s space for three
years, and the house is for sale.
Since 1973, when it was pur-
chased by the She/Life land
trust to be used “for women’s
purposes,” the house has shel-
tered hundreds of battered
women and children, “women in
transition,” a few women's com-
munes, a crisis/referral line, a
Lesbian Center, a community
newsletter, and has provided
meeting space for various
feminist groups.

Background

Over the years, the house has
had its financial ups and downs
— mainly downs. It has been the
most stable when defined pri-
marily as living space for
women’s communes, and least
stable when defined as pri-
marily crash space for women
“in transition.” Various com-
binations of the above have been
tried, with the inevitable result
of staffers of the crisis center
getting burned out, and renters
moving to more peaceful spaces.

In January of 1974, the shel-
ter house project received fund-
ing for salaries, and She/Life
turned the house over wholly to
the Women in Transition pro-
ject, in the hopes that the house
would at last become financial-
ly stable through outside fund-
ing and charging crashers
“rent.”

This did not happen, and in the
face of mounting debts, the
W.I.T. Board of Directors de-
cided to rent the house tempor-
arily, and sell it when possible to
pay the debts. In January of
1976, five women moved in.
They will move out if the house is
sold.

What Can Be

The house can still be saved as
valuable women’s space. It is
large, old, beautiful and the
structure is basically sound. The
five women living there pre-
sently are interested in keeping
the house as a land trust “for
women’s purposes,” with the
priority being private, rented
living space for women, and
using extra space for
meeting/office space needs of
feminist groups.

What is needed:

1. $3000 maximum to clear
the old debts and make repairs
on the house.

2. A feminist with good credit
and financial stability to sign the
remaining $12,000 mortgage on
the house.

3. Input from women’s groups
interested in using house space.

The house is presently on the
market. If a buyer is found it will
be sold. If the space is to be kept
in this community, finances
have to come together fast. If
interested, or if you want more
information, please come to
1895 Lafayette St, Tuesday
March 16 at 8:30 pm for a com-
munity meeting.

Ob-Gyn’s Oppose
NYC Laws

A group of obstetrics and
gynecology professors in New
York City is currently challeng-
ing in federal court the progres-
sive regulations created in the
last three years to control the
widespread sterilization abuse
which has affected millions of
black, Mexican, Native
American, Puerto Rican and
poor white women in the United
States.

The lawsuit, filed in New York
City on January 5, seeks to
abolish federal, state and New
York City guidelines for steriliza-
tion procedures. The case was
prompted by the implementa-
tion on November 1, 1975 of
strong local guidelines for New
York City municipal hospitals.

The New York regulations are
designed to protect women’s
basic rights to full information
on all birth control alternatives
whenever an elective steriliza-
tion — for contraceptive pur-
poses — is requested. The
guidelines require a 30-day
waiting period between the time
a woman consents to undergo a
sterilization operation and the
time when the operation is
actually performed (compared to
only 3 days under federal and
state guidelines).

Specific counseling

Sterilization
procedures are also required in
addition to the minimum federal
prohibition against sterilization
of women under 21 and people.

According to the New York
based Committee to End
Abuse, “documented sterilization abuse of
women by the coercion of doc-
tors and social service agencies
together with the mass steriliza-
tion program in Puerto Rico
(where 35% of all women of
childbearing age are already
sterilized) require strong guide-
lines to ensure that truly in-
formed consent is given for the
sterilization operation.” Until
women’s health rights and
community groups pressed for
guidelines in New York City,
there was no assurance that
women were informed of facts
such as the irreversibility of the
operation.

Since 1970 there has been a
three-fold increase in female
sterilizations performed in the
United States. One million
operations are performed a year,
many without proper consent.
Of these, the majority are done
on black, Native American, Mex-
ican and Puerto Rican women.
