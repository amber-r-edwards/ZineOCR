Meridel le Sueur--A Radical American

(Reprinted from Spare Rib, a
women's liberation magazine
from London.)

Meridel le Sueur's book
The Girl has recently been
published by the Women's

interview

Press (England). A lifelong
socialist feminist, she based
the book on the lives of wo-
men she lived with in a derelict warehouse in Minneapolis
during the Depression. Some
of their stories also appear
in Women on the Breadlines,
published by West
Press.

In the Foreword, she writes,
"I did not write these stor-
ies. I recorded them. They
are the words of women who
are now dead, or lost, incar-
cerated in prisons or asylums,
who forgot their names from
shock treatment or lobotomies,
who went from racism
or rape. Not stor-
ies but epitaphs marking the
lives of women who, in wars,
depression or holocaust are
at the bottom of the social
strata, are trampled on, leave
no statistic, no record, obit-

or remembrance of the
women and girls who told me
these stories, only one and
myself are visible and alive."
Now 83, Meridel le Sueur is
still writing, still active.
Gay Jones talked with her
about her life and writing.

GJ: When I was a child,
women and children were 'pro-
perty' in most of the states
of the USA. As women had no
rights, a man could take his
children away from his wife.
In Texas, where we lived un-
til I was eight, women couldn't
own land; everything a
woman had went to her husband.
If a woman had a job, the sal-
ary was paid to her husband,
just like she was a horse or

a cow. My mother inherited
eight farms from my grand-
mother, but when she married
they all went to her husband
who drank them away. We were
impoverished; he was an alco-
holic, but you couldn't get
a divorce very easily - a man
could, but it was almost im-
possible for a woman. So my
mother took us over the bor-
der - we fled in the night to
Oklahoma, just north of Texas.
My father could not extradite
us, that we went
to court, and we children
could choose where we would
stay. This was very, very

which meant

radical! After her divorce in
Oklahoma, and getting custody
of the children, which she
would never have done in Tex-
as, my mother married a so-
cialist.

Because we were poor and I
had no training, I only had
the choice of being a whore
or getting married - and in
Oklahoma City, the brothels
were full of girls from the
countryside who had no choice.
So young girls of 12 and 13,
a lot of them Indian, got sip-
honed off to the big cities,
to the brothels, even kid-
napped. The New York City
brothels were filled by Minn-
esota farm girls. It was a
real trade, called the Minne-
sota Strip; they'd be kidnap-
ped and forced into prostitu-
tion. Maybe it still exists.

GJ: How did you come to
meet Emma Goldman?

MIS: My mother sent me to
New York when I was 15 to be-
come an actress. She had want-
ed to be an actress, and I
was to fulfill her! I stayed
at the anarchist house, as my
mother was a friend of Alexan-
der Berkman, Emma Goldman's
lover. I didn't really like it
as it wasn't a collective
place - Emma Goldman was the
leader. I had thought anar-
chists were some 'future' peo-
ple, and the anarchist house
quite shocked me. I didn't
think they were highly devel-
oped at all. Well, of course,
you don't suddenly become fu-

ture beings. Theoretically,
it was a collective, and there
was a can where everybody was
supposed to put their collec-
tive money, but I didn't ever
see anybody put their collec-
tive money in there except
Emma Goldman, who raised the
money for everything. Not only
would she raise the money, but
everybody would be sitting
around waiting for her to come
back with money and groceries,
and to cook supper! So I did-
n't get a good impression of
the collectivity of anarchists.

GJ: And she allowed it to
happen?

MIS: Well, yes. She was a
very motherly person, she al-
ways wanted to have a child,
but she was also the only one
who knew how to raise money,
which she did, from upper-
class women who supported her.

-Layle Silber/Spare Rib

She'd give lectures on Ibsen,
and she brought the Yiddish
theatre here; she was a re-
markable woman and very com-
mitted to culture. Her auto-
biography's one of the great
writings by women; she tells
the truth about herself and
about her sexual life. All her
anarchist friends hated one
of her lovers, Ben Reithmann.
He was really an American
trickster, but he was crazy
about Emma Goldman, and she
was crazy about him. She'd
say, "Well, you know, he's
really good sexually, although
I know he's not developed pol-
itically..." He really was a
bastard! There's a cemetery
in Chicago where some anar-
chists are buried, including
him and Buma Goldman, and I
had an obsession for a time
that he should be taken out
of there! In her book, she
writes about her lovers and
her feelings about them, and
about wanting to have a child.
It's a great and very honest
book, no romanticizing; women
don't often look at themselves
like that. She doesn't say she
did all the work, which is al-
so very much part of women,
being the martyr. But she was
remarkable.

I went to Hollywood when I
was 20. I think I could scien-
tifically prove that the basic,
primary wealth of Hollywood
was based on the trade in Mid-
western beautiful young girls.
They used to go there to get
into the pictures, like I did.
I had been on the stage a bit
in New York, and I didn't know
how to make a living except
through the theatre or the
movies. You had to go down to
a shape-up, where there were
all these young girls who'd
be prepared to do anything.
They'd arrived with nothing,
and they'd be starving. Hund-
reds of people would meet in
the hiring hall, and the dir-
ectors would come down, and
lift up our skirts to see if
we had good legs - as if they
were buying a mare. Then they'd
look in our mouths and at our
teeth, and finally say, "You
and you and you and you..."
to whoever would have work
for that day as an extra. Then
we'd have to sign a form say-
ing that they weren't respon-
sible if we were killed; we'd
have to bury ourselves. But I
could make $25 a day, which
was a small fortune then.
That's how I began to write,
working for three or four days,
and then writing for a couple
of months, living very spare-
ly. I began to think of myself
seriously as a writer then,
although I didn't make any
money at it.

GJ: Did you already think of
yourself as a socialist at
that point?

MIS: Oh yes, I was a social-
ist from the age of ten! Before
the First World War, there had
been an enormous socialist
school in Kansas, one of the
biggest workers' schools ever
in the USA. My mother taught
English there. But the war
destroyed everything - social-
ists, progressives, even lib-
erals, every organization,
the trade unions.

But people are more radical
now, I believe. We have Third
World radicalism which also
educates us. Then we had no-
thing. Britain was the ruler
of the world, but we didn't
know anything about colonial
countries. Here there was ex-
ploitation in the mines, but
we knew nothing about Africa.

GJ: How did men who were
writers on the Left react
when you became established
as a writer?

MIS: We had a big struggle!
At first, the Socialist Party
was backward in relation to
women. Women who were good
orators, like Kate Richard
O'Hare, and my mother, were
trashed in the socialist move-
ment. And the Communist Party
wanted to trash all 'lyrical'
literature for being 'middle-
class.' My work was published
in the Old Masses, the left-
wing paper, with an apology
beside it. Their comment about
one story was, "This is a very
moving story about women which
we're printing because it's
about the suffering of women,
even though it's defeatist in
attitude" - because I didn't
end by saying "Join the union
movement or Communist Party."
Writers on the left were just
supposed to write pamphlets.
I'm not an intellectual and I
don't write diatribes, so I
just kept writing my poetic
or lyrical work. It wasn't
any virtue on my part; I just
didn't write good leaflets!

The real cultural movement
in the USA was the IWW (Inter-
national Workers of the World,
a socialist/anarchist move-
ment), because they believed
in poetry. I knew some of them
in the West and they influen-
ced me a lot. They prepared
for jail by learning poetry
so that they could yell it at
each other in the cells! The
orthodox trade union movement
hated them.

GJ: In the 30s, you had a
male editor. Was that with a
commercial publishing house?

MIS: Yes, in 1926 or '27,
by some kind of fluke, I was
published in The Dial. It was
the only cultural, liberal,
middle-class magazine, and
for a time it actually had
two women poets as editors.
They published my story "An-
nunciation" about the birth
of a child. Anyone published
in The Dial was courted by all
the publishers. So for about
three years before the Depres-
sion, I had a spurious love
affair with the bourgeois
press wanting to prostitute
me right away. They were lurk-
ing to pick out any kind of
radical or working-class wri-
ter, and ruin them.

My editor wrote and said
that my story about a woman
giving birth was very moving,
but couldn't I write more like
Hemingway? So I wrote back
and said, "Sure I would, but
fishin', fuckin' and fightin’
aren't the things I know
most about."

But then the Depression
came, with a real collapse
of the whole system. We were
all penniless. The richest
families probably had some
kind of money tucked away
somewhere, but Wall Street
simply collapsed in one day
in 1929. My mother was over
70 and we had to get a room-
ing house; she did the wash-
ing and ironing for 20 rooms.
Oh, it's really hard to des-
cribe the entire collapse of
an economy.

GJ: How did you start liv-
ing in the warehouse?

MIS: Well, there was no
food on the farms, and the
farm women poured into the
twin cities of Minneapolis/
St. Paul (a third of the small
farms were taken over at the
beginning of the Depression).
There were soup lines, started
by churches, where blocks and
blocks of people would stand
in line to get fed, but women
never went on them. No one ever
said they shouldn't but the
lines were all men, and these
shy farm girls just lived
underground. There wasn't much
in garbage cans even. One of
the first demonstrations we
had was people in bathing
suits walking down the fash-
ionable street, skin and
bone, with signs. Women faint-
ed in the shopping district
because they were starving.

Then they began to sterilize
women en masse. The cops would
come and accuse women getting
warm in the bus station of so-
liciting, and they'd net lit-
erally hundreds of women. Then
they'd take them to the women's
reform house and sterilize
them. We actually had laws
against sterilization; you
could ask for a lawyer and
demand an intelligence test,
but most women didn't know
that, and you did have to ask
for it. Then they began to
sterilize radicals too. My
stepfather was a lawyer, and
got involved with two radi-
cals who were threatened with
sterilization, so I went down
to be arrested with them and
find out what the procedure
was, taking my father with
me! So we began to fight this
mass sterilization.

All these women were sleep-
ing in parks, and so that's
when we got this warehouse
where we lived all winter.
We'd build a fire with any-
thing handy on the top floor,
and when it burnt through
that floor, we moved down to
the next. We burnt all the
railings and everything that
was inside the warehouse. Fin-
ally a radical old timber-
worker brought us an axe;
we'd been tearing at things
with our raw hands. In the
evening - we were hungry most
of the time - we'd start tell-
ing our stories to each other,
and writing them down. That's
where The Girl comes from.
The part where she goes back
to her father's funeral is
exactly one woman's words.

I have enough for a whole
book from what she wrote.
She's lost and dead now.

GJ: What happened to you
when the McCarthy era started
in the late 40s?

MIS: Like hundreds of wri-
ters, I was completely sup-
pressed, blacklisted, made
invisible. It was an attempt
to begin fascism. You had to
sign a loyalty oath to stay
in the universities. The in-
tellectuals collapsed; they
were terrified; they even gave
away their own books before
there was a Hitler telling
them to. I had about five
children's books that I made
my living from, and they were
banned, although the publisher
was the only one to put out a
statement demanding that their
authors should be free from
political persecution. But I
lost my living. I had a book
out about Abe Lincoln when he
first discovered slavery and
the Milwaukee Journal wrote,
"This shows how low a radical
writer will fall, to write
such beautiful prose to se-
duce our young." I made some
of my living teaching writing
in Minneapolis.

GJ: You were allowed to do
that?

MIS: No! I had been teach-
ing writing, but everybody in
my class would come to me and
say, "I can't come to your
class any more, the FBI has
visited me, my husband will
lose his job, I'll lose my
job..." So I thought I'd have
a correspondence course. I put
ads in independent socialist
and liberal papers, and got a

box number. I got quite a
response - and within three
months, everybody on my cor-
respondence course had been
visited by the FBI! They'd
opened my mail, so that was
that. I couldn't even get a
job as a waitress. I worked
as a bartender once, for a
couple of weeks, until the
boss said, "You're OK, but
the FBI's been here. I'll
have to fire you." I was in
good company - in fact, if
you weren't investigated by
the FBI, it means there was
something you hadn't done!

GJ: Were you ever called to
testify?

MIS: Yes, I was subpoenaed,
and so were my daughter and
her husband, by the Unameri-
can Committee. But I was down
south and they never found
me. They came to villages
where I was hidden by the
Chicanos and the Indians,
and nobody would say where I
was.
