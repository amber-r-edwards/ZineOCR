THE POMO BASKETWEAVERS 1983

CALENDAR has just been published - Radical Feminist Analysis

and has received rave re-
views. Pomo Basketweavers have
long been recognized as some
of the premier basketmakers in
the world. Their baskets are
extraordinarily beautiful and
cherished works of art. The
calendar features striking
contemporary photographs of
the weavers as they gather
their materials, weave their
baskets and use the finished
pieces. With each month is al-
so a description of native
foods and basket materials
gathered at that time.
