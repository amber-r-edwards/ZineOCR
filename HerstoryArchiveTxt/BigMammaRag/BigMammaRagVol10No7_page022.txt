HOW WILL BOOKS BE SELECTED FOR THE DENVER FEMINIST LIBRARY

GENERAL BOOK SELECTION POLICY:
(Priorities for Selection and Specific Policies are Available from the DFLC.)
I. This is a feminist library --
Books will pertain to women and be of use to women. They will depict positive
images of women of various cultures and backgrounds. They will provide
alternatives to traditional role models.

II. Whenever possible select books by women --
Books by men will be included in the collection if they are the only source of
information on a topic, are of exceptional quality, and meet the general
requirements for book selection.

III. Books will provide women with the tools/information necessary to improve their
lives -- both physically and spiritually.

IV. All books will be reviewed to make sure they do not promote the existing power
structures, whether sexist, racist, classist or anti-Semitic. When there are
complaints about a book in the collection it will be further reviewed. If it has
some merit the book will be kept with a critique of its positive and negative
qualities. If found to be without merit it will be discarded.
