My name is Mary Louise  
Aragon. On March 4, 1973 I  
was sentenced to the Colora-  
do Women’s Correctional In-  
stitution. My crime was  
aggravated robbery and my  
sentence was indeterminate  
to 10 years. This action ended  
a crime and drug experience  
that had drawn itself out to  
almost ten years of my life.  
On March 6, I was transported  
to CWCI to start paying my  
debt to society.  

My encounters with the law  
by that time had been many  
and I remember thinking how  
degrading and inhumane the  
conditions were in the city  
and county jails. The toilets  
and showers are in plain view,  
giving no privacy at all. Some  
people might say “What the  
Hell?” but when you think  
about it put yourself in that  
position trying to use the  
toilet with a room full of  
people watching your every  
move. So far the conditions  
are minimal compared to what  
a woman is subjected to at the  
prison.  

Upon arriving I was greeted  
by a cold, fenced building that  
was isolated from the town at  
the end of a normal rural  
street lined with typical single  
family wood framed houses.  
The guards all wear white  
uniforms with name tags. The  
name tags show only the last  
name with the initial of their  
first name. That told me that  
they were to be referred to as  
Ms. or Miss or Mrs. Although  
they knew that my name was  
Ms. Aragon they called me  
Mary, which automatically  
tells me that they place  
themselves at a higher posi-  
tion than the inmates. I was  
officially accepted at the  
prison as I signed some  

papers. Up to this point prison  
was just a word to me but now  
I was led through electrically  
controlled doors which  
slammed behind me. From  
that point on I knew I was in  
prison although I can recall  
times when it was comparable  
to a concentration camp or  
even a nursery.  
Prison as Medicine  

Never having been in prison  
before I was somewhat fearful  
of what might happen to me. I  
had heard many stories about  
prison and the physical abuse  
that one might receive while  
being there. But the building  
was fairly new and very clean  
and it was almost like being in  
a hospital. Well to my surprise  
there was very little physical  
abuse. But in its place were  
far more dangerous methods  
of abuse, dehumanization,  
physical and sexual depriva-  
tion, loss of identity, and  
failure identification.  

My first day in isolation  
(where all new prisoners go)  
was spent in awe of my  
environment. My personal  
feelings at that time were of  
resentment, anger, loneliness,  
fear, and alienation from the  
whole world - and a good deal  
of self-pity. I had never placed  
any emphasis on just being  
able to touch another person  
but during the next two weeks  
the only interaction I had with  
another human being was when  
I was given tests by the doctor, or  
the guard. Often the guard  
would give medication that  
only a qualified nurse was  
supposed to give.  

I reflected a lot on my past  
and my family and I can say  
that at that time I desperately  
needed to talk to someone. I  
really needed a feeling of  
some kind of self-worth. But  
unfortunately there was none.  
So, consequently, by the time  
that I got out of isolation I was  
more than ready to accept any  
member of the prison peer  
group who would at least  
listen to some of my frustrations.  
I needed to tell someone that  
just because I broke the law I  
was still a human being and  
not some kind of an animal to  
be caged up and forgotten.  

As I said earlier, my  
involvement with the criminal  
justice system had been  
extensive, but one of the  
things that has bothered me  
most is that in spite of all the  
classifying, testing, and diag-  
nosing no one ever asked me  
why I did what I did. I guess  
that’s not part of what  
correction is about.  

After two weeks in isolation  
I was given a room in the north  
wing. I was now upper north 3  
- number 41654. By this time  
my nerves were at a breaking  
point. I spent a lot of time in  
my room which is identical to  
isolation rooms. The only  
differences were a small throw  
rug, bedspread, a small desk  
like table, a closet, and the  
door was only locked from  
10:00 pm to 7:00 am.  

The Rules  

I was given a small book  
which supposedly contained  
rules of the prison. I remem-  
ber thumbing through the  
book and landing on a page  
that said something like no  
moustaches or long side  
burns. Then I realized that the  
book was probably for the  
men’s prison. Then I found the  
page that related to the  
women's institution. The rules  
on that page seemed to be  
relatively simple and per-  
tained mostly to mail, and  
visiting rules.  

But as the days dragged on  
I found that there were many  
unwritten rules that apply to  
some of the people some of  
the time and to some of the  
people all of the time. All in all  
I’d say that there were more  
than 200 of these unwritten  
rules and they are changeable  
on a day to day or shift to shift  
basis. One rule is that you  
can’t have bananas or cucum-  
bers. Another is that you can’t  
go into anyone else’s room at  
all. You can’t hold hands with  
visitors. At the men’s visiting  
room they can hold hands.  
Dumb rules that you never  
know if you’re breaking or not,  
but if you do they'll write it up  
and put it in your file and then  
when you come in front of the  
parole board they'll read all  
this “bad girl” stuff and you  
don’t get parole.  

One of the things impressed  
on the women at CWCI is that  
they are ladies and are expected  
to act like ladies. But every day  
I would hear a guard tell a grown  
woman “you know that’s a  
no-no.” Sometimes you would  
get put in lock-up for breaking  
a rule in addition to being  
written up. Lock-up is being  
locked in your room after  
supper and not getting to  
watch TV. I used to get to the  
point where I’d say rules,  
rules, rules, there must be a  
rule for everything in this  
place and if there’s not one,  
believe me, one would be  
made up.  

Stomach Nerve Pills  

Almost all of the women  
take some kind of medication  
there. Of course it’s all  
prescribed legally but is often  
given by a matron who might  
not know what she's doing.  
You almost have to have  
tranquilizers to cope. Living  
there is a constant, constant  
bullshit thing with the same  
people 24 hours a day. You  
worry about your kids. Lots of  
people aren’t the easiest  
people to get along with. A lot  
of vulgarity goes down and  
lots of time you feel like  
hauling off and punching  
someone, but you know if you  
do you'll be put in the hole.  

The hole is underneath the  
isolation area. It's in the  
basement of the basement.  
There are three small cells:  
Two have toilets and matres-  
ses with three solid walls and  
one wall of bars. The third one  
just has a hole in the floor -  
nothing else. No one was ever  
put in there while I was there.  
But I heard that two women  
who tried to escape in 1970, I  
think, were put down there for  
30 days.  

One of the most strictly  
enforced rules there is no  
body contact. YOU CANNOT  
TOUCH ANOTHER PERSON  
FOR ANY REASON. Even  
when you hear that you are  
going to get out or when  
another woman needs to be  
comforted. I'd be told “Mary,  
you know that’s a no-no” they  
treat you like a two-year-old.  
To people on the outside it  
doesn't seem like anything  
not to be allowed to touch  
another person, but for a  
person to feel the impact of  
what I’m saying try going for  
a whole day without touching  
another person or showing  
your feelings physically. And  
then multiply that by months  
or years and you would know  
what a rule like no body  
contact does to you.  

While I was there I worked  
on the yard crew. I got to mow  
the grass and sometimes I’d  
be on this little tractor cutting  
the lawn and I would go crazy  
driving like a nut making hand  
signals. It would help me to  
forget where I was. You know,  
a woman is made up of many  
things and one of the heaviest  
things is emotion. If it is  
suppressed it just surfaces at  
another time.  

The recreation is not very  
good. They have hula-hoops  
and ping-pong tables and you  
can play baseball but there is  
no gym to really let off steam  
and keep yourself in shape  
from the starches you eat. But  
once we really had fun. It was  
on Labor Day when we asked  
to have a picnic in the yard.  
We were going to do all the  
planning and all the work so  
that there would be nothing
