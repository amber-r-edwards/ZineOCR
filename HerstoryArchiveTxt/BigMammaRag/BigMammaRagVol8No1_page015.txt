Feminism/Marxism: Strained Bedpartners

The Curious Courtship of Women's
Liberation and Socialism

Batya Weinbaum

South End Press

$4/paper

Ingrid Hughes

Batya Weinbaum's Curious Court-
ship traces the difficult relations
between Marxists and feminists from
the time of the nineteenth century
feminist movements and Marx and Engels
to the present, in an attempt to un-
derstand and bridge the gap between
the two sorts of revolutionary move-
ments.

Weinbaum is a feminist who feels
that it will never be possible for
people to have full freedom until we
have a socialist revolution, but it
must be a socialism that understands
better than any now existing the
problems of women.

The Lilith Summer

Hadley Irwin

Feminist Press

$7.95/hardback, for ages 10 and up

Twelve-year-old Ellen tells this
story about the summer she spends
as a companion to a 77-year-old wo-
man named Lilith. At first, Ellen
is motivated only by the fact that
she is earning money to buy a ten-
speed bicycle. Similarly, Lilith is
being paid to “watch" Ellen, money
which she intends to use for porch
screens. Gradually, through weeks
of shared experiences, the two
come to love and respect each other.
With Ellen, the reader grows to un-
derstand the concerns and feelings
of older people. Loneliness, inse-
curity, alcoholism, and death are
dealt with in a caring, insight-
ful way.

The Lilith Summer deserves praise
for its well-developed, strong
characters. Lilith, with her wis-
dom, energy, and independence, is
remarkable. Ellen is a typical
twelve-year-old; she is unique only
in her natural inclination to learn
the lessons her wise companion of-
fers to teach her. (The only flaws
in the book come when Ellen becomes
confused about the meanings of words
Lilith uses, words a bright twelve-
year-old like Ellen would under-
stand.)

cent literature and Annabelle Irwin
has published several juvenile no-
vels. They plan to continue their
collaboration and are working on
several new manuscripts.

Ageless Companionship

The first of Weinbaum's two dis-
tinct contributions to our under-
standing is focused mainly on the uncon-
scious male chauvinism of Marxists,
and is both new and very important to
those of us who see socialist revo-
lution as vital, and would like to
make use of Marxist heritage without
being trapped in its sexist tradition.

Weinbaum points out that women's
feminism and men's class conscious-
ness often derive from the same
source: the early stages of industri-
alization, which radicalize men and
give women employment outside of the
home.

An element in men's revolutionary
zeal that has been overlooked by
Marxists is the unconscious jealousy
that working men feel when the women
they consider their property are
taken from the service in the home
into the employ of the much more pow-
erful patriarchs of industry. Wein-
baum illustrates the point with many
historical examples. But when the
working men's movement begins to
have some power, either through the
trade union movements or by seizing
the state, as in the Soviet Union
and China, women fade from the unions
or the party, their needs are pushed
from sight, they are called ultra-
lefts or deviationists; Marxists and
feminists go their separate ways.
Once men begin to get control of
their women back they don't want
to see women's needs.

The many examples Weinbaum gives
from both leftist political liter-
ature, as well as art, of the ten-
dency to dwell on women's victimi-
zation accumulate to leave me at
least thoroughly convinced that these
men use our exploitation as a way to
both titillate themselves and arouse
their rage against those more power-
ful men who are their antagonists.

This book shows "all kinds of
mommies doing all kinds of work",
including secretarial, ranch, ra-
dio repair, store clerk, dancer,
writer, teacher, doctor, bank
cashier, bridge builder, television
director, train conductor, astrono-
mer, telephone operator, librarian,
scientist, car mechanic, airport
control tower directors, tightrope
walker, and factory worker.

Although this book is a great im-
provement over those that picture
women involved in household tasks,
it could have been even better if:

1) The illustrations would have
shown the women being more actively
involved in their jobs,

2) The women in the illustrations
would have been the focal point of
the illustrations, drawn larger and
near the center,

3) More minority figures had been
included,

4) Some women who are not mothers
had been included,

5) A different ending had been
chosen. The book ends with "and all
mommies loving the best of all to
be your very own mommy, and coming
home to YOU!" This ending puts the
emphasis back on the motherhood
role.

This sexual jealousy is not un-
conscious; Weinbaum takes pains to
explain that she feels that an uncon-
scious revolutionary motive does not
invalidate conscious ones, nor is
her intent to attack the integrity
of workers or their Marxist leaders.
Rather, she is providing a bridge
that might enable those feminists
who see capitalism as one of the
sources of our oppression to join the
most important forces fighting it.

For the theoretical basis of her
observations on unconscious sexism
in the Marxist traditions, Weinbaum
calls on Freud, without asking her
readers to accept any of his ideas
except those that can be used in the
feminist interest. In particular,
she discusses his myth of the rebel-
lion by the fraternal band of men
in the primal horde against the
patriarch who controlled their
access to the women. In rebelling,
they killed the dominant father, but
their guilt moved them to erect im-
ages of a paternal figure to concili-
ate these images, and to become the
father. Weinbaum sees this dynamic
acted out in the revolutions of
modern times. "Some become...patri-
archs in the new social institutions;
others...obey the new patriarchal
order with great fervor" born out
of guilt. Examples are "the Chinese
masses waving the Little Red Book;
the huge posters of Stalin, Lenin,
and Marx that adorn every Cuban fac-
tory.

fresh tyranny until we find new forms
for the family.

Dinnerstein, like Weinbaum, insists
that an understanding of the uncon-
scious is essential to changing the
world; in addition, she shares her view
of women as a more revolutionary
force than men. Both authors must be
read for a good understanding of this
subject.

The second contribution that Wein-
baum offers derives from her recog-
nition that Marx and Engels failed
in particular when they abstracted
away from age and sex differences
to see the average worker as a man.
Their blind phallocentrism caused
them to miss, as have their heirs,
an analysis of "the sharing of sur-
vival resources...via marriage and
the family among kin." (Italics in
the original.) To satisfy both the
feminist need to examine the family
and the economist's need to under-
stand the functioning of family mem-
bers in each part of the whole econ-
omy, Curious Courtship offers a new
tool: a definition of the household
as "the economic basis of the social,
emotional, and psychological rela-
tions developed in the family struc-
ture." The kin categories Weinbaum
names for household members will fa-
cilitate better comparative studies
of women to women, women to men,
older women to younger women, and
so on, and she believes, make a way
to imagine the end of the economic
basis for the household, a precon-
dition for women's liberation. Here
Weinbaum has made a leap that needs
elaboration. I think she is suggest-
ing not just an analytic tool, but
an ideological one: if we start
thinking of the family as a household,
and then break that down into its
members in their peer kin groups
(sisters, brothers), rather than
their families, and thus change
our consciousness. Unfortunately,
the writing here (as throughout the
book) is not clear, and my last sen-
tence is a possible implication,
not an explicit statement of the
authors.

South End Press deserves to be
faulted for the distractingly poor
proofreading of Curious Courtship.
In addition, the book could use an
index, considering the many histor-
ical, national, and personal refer-
ences. It is a book based on much
thought and deserves the care from
its publisher that it will get from
its readers.
