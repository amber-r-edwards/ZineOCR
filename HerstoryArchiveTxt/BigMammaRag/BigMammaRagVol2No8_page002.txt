Millions for Salaries—Pennies for Daycare

Boulder Students Unite for Quality Daycare

Jan Throndson

“A group of men, women and children have just taken over the
Alumni Center...the university police are on their way to oust them
unless we go to show our support."

Standing in the fountain area of the Colorado University
Memorial Center, the young Feminist student shouted through a
bullhorn to 24 demonstrators, who had gathered in the cold, drizzling
rain of Monday, April 26. The demonstrators who had come to
rally at the fountain for better daycare (and who were unaware
that there was to be a building takeover) moved abruptly toward
the northwest corner of campus to lend their solidarity.

Why the drastic action? The history of the struggle for more quality
daycare on University of Colorado’s campus tells the story.

In 1971, student, faculty and
staff women at CU requested an

improvement and expansion of

existing daycare facilities, which
had changed little since they
were first established at the
close of World War II.

Baily Report

With this pressing request,
the regents, the governing board
of the university, commissioned
a study by the experienced and
widely respected educator, Bill
Baily. A year later, “The Baily
Report” was completed and
filed.

In his study, Baily documented
a need for daycare for 350
children, and recommended a
budget of $345,000. He proposed
a unique program of decentralized
“daycare homes”—private houses where
small groups of children could be
taught and cared for. Backed by
daycare professionals and
members of Boulder’s Task
Force on Women and Children,
“The Baily Plan” also sought a
central facility where children
could benefit from a preschool
atmosphere and where trained
adults could work in the daycare
units.

The study, costing approximately $25,000, was disregarded by the regents, and Baily’s contract was never renewed.

A second proposal was made
by the CU administration—the
“Taber Proposal.” This reaffirmed the need for childcare for
350 youngsters and proposed a
budget of $200,000.

It was not until April of this
year, after members of the CU
Women’s Liberation Coalition
(WLC) and other concerned individuals marched at Regent's
Hall, that the Board of Regents
appropriated funding for childcare. A total of $89,000 to
provide daycare for just 60
children was allocated.
Members of the WLC have taken
issue that this compensatory
move will do little more than bring the same inadequate childcare a bit closer to campus.

Women and Children Hold
Office
Throughout Monday afternoon and evening, the
demonstrators inside the Alumni Center persisted in holding
down the director of University
Foundations, Inc., Dwight
Roberts’ office, while outside a
constant number of nearly 40
demonstrators persisted in the rain.
Not only were
protestors from the WLC, but
also from CU's United Mexican
American Students, Vietnam
Veterans Against the War, Gay
Liberation and the student
government—the UCSU.
Numerous unaffiliated students,
faculty and staff members joined
with student organizations during the entire Monday and Tuesday 32-hour takeover.
By Tuesday noon, the adults
occupying Roberts’ office felt that
the children should not remain
cooped-up any longer, and at
that time the children were escorted out by the adult
demonstrators, all the time under
the watchful eye of the university
police.

Day Care is Our Right

In a prepared statement, read
from Roberts’ window to the
demonstrators below, Ms.
Jeanne Winer, member of the
WLC and staff secretary of the
UCSU, said, “...the time for
serious action has come. No
longer will we beg on our knees
for what should be ours by right.
The university is ours. We pay
for it.”

Winer continued, “Our
children are the human
resources of the entire society. It
is the responsibility of that society
to provide collectively for their
care and education. Too long has
this social duty been forced onto
the shoulders of individual
women at the expense of our
own health, careers, education,
economic well-being and personal lives... Too long have
children been confined to individual homes and limited
resources of single families. The
bonds between mother and child
should be bonds of love, not
chains of slavery.”

Winer, claiming that the
regents’ action was “criminally
inadequate,” said that the
center proposal for $89,000 will
at best provide for one-sixth of
the present daycare need and
that operational costs had not
been adequately considered.
She also stated that in the
regents’ proposal, women will
still be expected to bear the
monetary burden of childcare
costs through increases in their
housing fees.

“Individual expenses,” Winer
said, could amount to “the tune
of $81 per child per month.”

Interestingly enough, the
daycare demonstrators selected
Dwight Roberts’ office in the
Alumni Center, because it is the
“University of Colorado Foun-
dations, Inc.—one of the several
sources from which funding
could be found for childcare.”
This office solicits funds from
donations for specific projects,
such as the law and pharmacy
buildings, and the business
library, but at no time has it ever
made daycare a priority for funding.

Insensitivity to Women

Citing this as an example of
administrative insensitivity to
women's needs, Winer said,
“There is no reason why a university with an annual budget of
over $600,000,000, that can afford to pay its figurehead president
$50,000 a year plus benefits, can’t provide $345,000 for adequate childcare.”

It was also emphasized that
there would be no need for an
increase in student fees or a
decrease in student benefits to
provide for childcare.

Various speakers on
Tuesday's bright, sunny afternoon expressed several views in
support of a better quality
daycare program.

One spokeswoman from Kiddie Kampus, the present CU
childcare facility, said she per-
sonally had been working for
change for three years. Speaking
from experience in working
with low-income families, she
said, “Try living on $300 per
month and try to spread it evenly
among two adults and a
child...you can’t live reasonably
well when 27% of your income is
going to pay for childcare.”

“Besides this,” she said, “that
27% for childcare expenses
leaves nothing for the child's
medical insurance.” She was
speaking to the issue that
besides the need for high quality
childcare, the care should be
low-cost.

Ann Markusen, assistant
professor of economics at CU,
addressed the Tuesday afternoon
crowd of nearly 100, on the
importance of daycare, as a
necessity of Women’s Liberation.

“Childcare enslaves women
to the home, especially lower in-
come women...the necessary
conditions of Women’s Liberation are economic conditions.”

President Claims “No
Authority”

During the entire 32-hour
dramatization for childcare, the
participants encountered
numerous difficulties with the
university police and regents’
non-responsiveness. While the
building was being held, the
inside demonstrators and CU
student body co-presidents, Cyndy
Calkins and Anita Sanchez,
made countless attempts to
mediate with the regents and
police.

Detrimental to the outcome of
the demands of the group was
the fact that all the regents were
out of town (some in New
Orleans at a university banquet)
and were impossible to reach in
order to talk out the demonstrators’ demands. After
a telephone session with
recently-dismissed President
Thieme, whose term lasts until
June 1, the mediators reported
that Thieme said he had no
authority left to call the regents
back for a meeting with the
demonstrators.

Later, Tuesday night at 8:30,
Thieme rediscovered his
authority, and ordered the university police to oust the oc-
cupiers of Roberts’ office. Earlier
notified by Dean of Student Af-
fairs, James Quigley, that they
had to be out by 5:00 pm, or they
would be issued summonses,
the demonstrators left two and a
half hours later, charged with
“interference with faculty, staff
and students in an educational
institution and failure to leave
the building after being ordered
to leave.”

Day Care Demands

The list of ten demands stated
by Ms. Winer, and left unmet by
the regents were whittled to two
demands after the first few
hours of the demonstration. The
two major demands included
amnesty for the inside
demonstrators and a guaranteed
meeting to discuss the daycare
problem with the regents.

Amnesty was granted for those
who left before 5:00 Tuesday
evening; however, a daycare
meeting with the regents was
never guaranteed.
Among the list of demands,
the following were included:
— That Sept. 1, 1974 be set as
the completion date for the $89,000 housing units for Kiddie
Kampus, passed on April 25,
1974, by the regents.
— That operational costs for the
daycare center be added to the
$89,000.
— That operational costs for the
daycare center be added to the
$89,000.
— That there be no increase in
married student housing living
costs to get funds for childcare
expenses.
— That the regents call a
meeting devoted solely to the
issue of committing themselves
to the demands.
— That total and unconditional
amnesty be granted to all people
inside Dwight Roberts’ office.
The Silver and Gold Record, a
CU faculty and staff newspaper,
reported that, “The only childcare facility is Kiddie Kampus, a
perpetually underfunded
program, housed currently in
ramshackle buildings...and
staffed by persons who rarely
make more than $2 per hour.”
In fact, in the past the program
was housed in World War I-vintage quonset huts and frequently staffed by work-study
students at minimal wages.
Kiddie Kampus Inadequate
Daycare professionals have
reiterated that the high turnover rates at Kiddie Kampus and
the use of barely-trained
students could increase the
problems of young children,
already burdened with the stress
of low incomes and broken
homes.

It is a widely-known fact that
some CU parents find it
necessary to bring their children
to classes with them.

After the unsuccessful
attempt on April 29-30, daycare
demonstrators again marched
on Thursday, May 9.

An educational drive is now
underway to inform all students,
faculty and staff of the inadequate daycare facilities. A survey is being taken by the daycare
committee to find just exactly
how much the need for childcare
has increased since “The Baily
Report,” and how many people
would support the drive for more
quality daycare.
