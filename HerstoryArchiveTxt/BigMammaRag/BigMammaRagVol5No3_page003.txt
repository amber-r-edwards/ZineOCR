Fan Letter

Dear Big Mama Staff:

Ever since you published that plea
for moral support in one of your more
recent issues, I've been meaning to
send off a note of some kind.

The Women's Line (492-8910) in
Boulder is a subscriber and fan of
yours, and we do know what it's like
to work hard and wonder just a bit
sometimes if anyone cares.

Don't give up! So many rely on you
for support and information--
including our whole staff.

We often refer women callers to you
who are lonely/bored/energetic and
looking for support/work/involvement
with other women. Do hope some end up
volunteering their time for you.

Anyhow, consider this a letter of
support and affection. (Wish our budget
could include a donation).

Sincerely,
Patrice Inglis (for
all 30 or so of us)

To BMR Staff,

I just finished reading your Jan-Feb
issue of BMR and am greatly disturbed
that it was devoted to Socialist Fem-
inism as a viable political position
for women. One of the main reasons
Feminism as a Movement is having such
trouble developing is that women con-
tinue to fall into the role of dil-
uting, compromising and doubting the
potential of Feminism for radical
change. You, like so many other indi-
viduals and groups, refuse to recognize
in Feminism the implication for a total
change of society--basically the elim-
ination of power, exploitation and op-
pression that would go far beyond the
changes in an economic system that we
see in the attempt of present Social-
ist Patriarchies.

A Feminist world would necessarily

A non-exploitative economic
system, but would go far beyond this
in eliminating exploitation in all
areas of human interaction. You and
I and all women must stop subverting
this potential of Feminism by seman-
tic or ideological allegiance to
patriarchal/male ideology. Of course,
the economic system must change--so
must the institutions of racism, mar-
riage and heterosexuality--but as an
extension of eliminating all patriar-
chal (male supremacist) values.

There are few periodicals that con-
sistently reflect the struggle for an
independent Feminist Movement. Our
need for these periodicals is great.

I regret that I no longer see
one of them. I want my subscription
cancelled immediately. I am not wil-
ling to receive or support a news-
paper that is undermining the fight
for a radical feminism.

P.S. It is ironic that you includ-
ed a picture of Stanton and Anthony
on the cover of the Jan-Feb issue of
BMR. They, particularly, were clear
about the danger in diluting a Women's
movement by incorporating the goals
of male ideologies.

(Editors' Note: You got us wrong.
We strongly support an independent
women's movement and consider our-
selves part of it. However, as radi-
cal feminists, we confront many of the
same questions as does "the left":
racism, economic exploitation, the
nature of power--as well as patriarchy.
If and under what circumstances we
can work with the left are valid
issues for feminists; we definitely
consider socialist feminism a viable
political position for women.

The interviews in the Jan-Feb
issue presented a range of experience:
three of them were with women who had
