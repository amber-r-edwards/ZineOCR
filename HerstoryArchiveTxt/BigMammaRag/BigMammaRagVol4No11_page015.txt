of other social activities, you might
begin to broaden your interests a
little outside of the home, and see
that you had more potential.

Now women are trying to get jobs in
the mines. There are 16 women working
there. They're beginning to speak
out more, so the lessons that were
learned at Brookside weren't lost.

LNS: What's happened to you since
your involvement in the strike?

LOIS: Well especially when the coal
operators saw that we were going to
continue with the paper and that we
were going to come out real strong
against the plan, they just started
terrorizing us, they framed Bessie
Lou with a kidnapping (see BMR, Feb.,
1976). :
BESSIE: A woman named Kathy Ball -
a Klansman's wife - had taken out a
warrant for me (saying I “kidnapped
her). We learned later that her hus-
band told her that he'd kill her if
she didn't get a warrant for me. He's
a known gun thug in the county and
he's still working at the Highsplint
mine. + * -
Three days after my arrest, David
Duke, the head of the KKK from Louis-
iana, came to Harlan County. He
brought a troop of Klansmen with him
and they burned a 30-foot cross and
they talked about the paper and how
bad it was. ane (
Had it not been for the people in
the county and some outside publicity,
I probably would have been framed and
sent to jail for 20 years or whatever
it is for that kidnapping charge. But
people began passing out petitions to
get me out of jail, calling the gov-
ernor and the jailhouse. The jailer
told me the second day that I was in
there, he said, “you're getting more
phone calls than an executive."
And before that, the courts took
my son away from me, right after the
strike. They brought in state police
to testify that I was a violent per-
son because I had beat up scabs on
the picket line. .
And they testified that the paper
had a staff who was black and white
and I was associating with “niggers"
- this is all in my divorce case - and a person like that isn't fit to

ceded from view. In the past year as
Mao's death became imminent and the
leftist faction realized it would —
be overpowered by the Center without
Mao's help, Chiang became more active.

The Center has scapegoated Chiang
Ching because it wants to keep the
leftist faction immobilized in this
time of turmoil. To be fair, how-
ever, Premier Hua and the Center gov-
ernment have also been criticizing
the rightist factions. The aim ap-
pears to be to stabilize the country
so that it can recover from the earth-
quake of this past summer and from
Mao's death.

Premier Hua is beginning to carry
out the Fifth Five Year Plan which
would dramatically increase produc-

tion by 15% a year which is an in-
credible amount for any country, but
especially an underdeveloped one.

They will have to export a lot in
order to import the necessary tech-
nology. This will mean that the needs
of the people will have to be sac-
rificed to production goals.

We will have to wait and see if a
new repressive Stalinist phase occurs
in China. Hopefully the people would
resist this since they have been study-
ing Mao for years and he supported
rebellion and the Cultural Revolution.
The current leadership also says that
they believe in "letting 100 flowers
bloom” which means that they believe
a diversity of opinions is good.
Hopefully Chiang Ching and the left-
ists may yet again return to a posi-
tion of power.

We had printed an article about
fascism, and about how these coal
operators, their actions were getting
worse and worse after the strike.

And about how the same thing happened
in Germany, that they tried to divide
people and put out the idea that one
group of people was superior to the
others.

During my court proceeding, this
lawyer brought out the paper and said,
"are you against fascism?” And I
said, "I certainly am. You know,
people fought a war against fascism."
And he said, “are you going to teach
your son to be against fascism?"
And I said, "I certainly will."
The lawyer said, “Well, there you

And

have it. This woman's going to teach
her son to be against fascism." And
they took my son away from me. It's

been a year since my divorce decision
and the whole bit lasted two years.

LNS: What do you think was gained
from the strike? © —

BESSIE: Like the civil rights move-
ment won a lot of concessions for

all workers. It brought a better way
of life for people - less segregation.

But it still didn't mean there was
full equality and we still have to
carry it forward. If you let down
your guard and you don’t keep up the
fight or keep struggling, they can
take away all the gains you got.

And that's why it needs to be pointed
out that the Ku Klux Klan is around
to take away the things we won during
the strike. -

The strike in Harlan County and
the reform movement within the miners
union was a very concrete example
of how the leadership of the move-
ment of miners - or any worker -
comes from below.

One of the Tiredness Cycle poems
is actually a longish prose poem
written originally to explain why
she couldn't write what she wanted
to write (which was the second Tir-
edness poem), and then it goes into
descriptions of staying home with
a sick child and how hard that makes
any kind of creative work, with the
incessant demands and drains on the
mother/poet's time....and sanity.

She concluded by reading two ex-
cerpts from her work in progress, a
philosophical/lyrical/prophetic/ex-
ploratory essay on the relation be-
tween women and nature. She began
by making the point that men regard
women and nature in similar ways--
something to be used and exploited
without any concern for replacing
what they've used - and that women
and nature have a natural affinity
because of this.

The book has two sections, so far,
the historical part where she deals
in the patriarchal-dominated past
and writes in a “masculine” factual
tone; and then the visionary sec-
tion wherein she fantasizes for the
future, which is written in a mys-
tical, emotional, and very moving
style. It was exciting to be in
on the birth process of a new book,
and to see the obvious gleam of
affection in her eyes for this lat-
est child of hers.

Letters To Mama...

This includes rulings of the Judge
on matters of procedure and conduct
of the trial. As a lawyer, I am an
officer of the Court and am duty-
bound to do no less.

The previous trial in June, 1976
resulted in a mistrial based upon
a defense witness' testimony which
the Judge attributed to my seeking
out through my questions of the wit-
ness. He indicated he thought I
was in contempt of court at that
time but would not so rule. In-
stead, he assessed court costs for the
mistrial against me. I fully ex-
pected and prepared for another
heated trial on November 3, 1976.
The statement of the leaflet put me
in an impossible dilemma. If I
were to be held in contempt of
court, then the statement could pos-
sibly be used against me as proof
that I was planning to defy the
Court and to violate my duties as
an officer of the Court. Thus, an
irreconcilable conflict of interest
arose - my own interest to be very
careful not to be held in contempt
of court (in the face of court rul-
ings which the Judge stated he
would repeat at the second trial)
and that of Ms. Lallo's - to have a
strong defense presented on her
behalf, that I would be uninhibited
by fears of possible contempt. Rather
than enter a trial where thoughts
of being held in contempt of court
would interfere with my duty to Ms.
Lallo in mounting an aggressive de-
fense, I was compelled to ask the
Judge to allow me to withdraw from
the case. The lawyers' code of pro-
fessional responsibility required
me to take this step. The Judge
granted my withdrawal.

Kathy Bonham had graciously of-
fered her services and will repre-
sent Ms. Lallo. I wish to thank
the members of the defense team
for their beautiful and unfailing
support.

A lesson for the community - the
publicity for a political case
should always be analyzed for its
possible repercussions to the per-
son on trial. Generally, as a law-
yer works as an officer of the
court and under the code of profes-
sional responsibility, the most
well-intentioned gesture may re-
quire a lawyer to withdraw from a
case. While freedom of speech and
opinion should be exercised and ex-
pressed to the fullest, care should
be exercised that things are not
said which would adversely affect
the defense of the case at trial.
Check it out with the lawyers and
defense team first.

Sincerely yours,
Gerald A. Gerash

Dear Big Mama:

In your article on the Women in
Print conference (Oct., 1976, Vol.
4, No. 9), you referred to an “east-
ern regional conference on racism,
involving both Third World and
white women." That conference was
sponsored and organized by Sagaris
and National Black Feminist Organ-
ization. It was an extremely suc-
cessful conference dealing with
racism in the woman's movement, the
interrelationship of racism and
sexism, and coalition building.
Sagaris will be having a two-week
session on Racism/Sexism/Classism
this coming summer. It will be
part of its 8-week summer institute.

Yours truly,
Joan Peters
for Sagaris.

dual Chicanas, and ways in which
white men and women have contri-
buted to the oppression of Chica-
nas historically.

In the afternoon, Rita Mae Brown,
lesbian writer and theoretician,
addressing a mixed straight/lesbian
group, began her lecture by discus-
sing the political importance of
lesbianism. However, she and the
audience were more interested in
discussing class; and clearly mon-
ey, rather than sex, was the sub-
ject containing the most political
dynamite. Challenging women in the
audience to “put your money where
your movement is,” Rita received
her own challenges from the audience
as to where she personally puts her
own money. She replied, with hardly
a ruffle in her feathers, that
half of the money she earned last
year went to her mother and she
lived off the other half. In addi-
tion, she said she contributes to
the Feminist Writers' Guild, a pro-
ject with which she is personally
involved. While Rita's style and
content clearly pleased and encour-
aged many women, her examples of
women's inability to deal with mon-
ey - "Where are our feminist stock-
brokers?" and her own personal pre-
ference for “one Rolls Royce” rather
than “ten tacky Ford Mavericks"
raised some political comments (and
eyebrows), which Rita did not ade-
quately defend. Rather, she backed
into her role as an artist-novelist,
claiming she didn't have all the
answers, but wanted to raise the
questions.

On Sunday morning, Clara Fraser,
long-time socialist and leader of
Radical Women in Seattle, discussed
her own experiences with political
organizing and called for a "united
front" among women and between wo-
men and other oppressed groups. She
voiced some support for Rita Mae
Brown's talk of the day before, in-
dicating that, coming from a working
class background herself, she under-
stood and agreed with the analysis
of class attitudes and behavior
which Rita had been trying to con-
vey. Clara noted that both the
downward mobility trend in the
movement and reverse racism were
reactionary results of middle-class
leadership. In particular, she ad-
dressed lawyers in the audience to
use their skills to help change the
system, and gave examples of the
important educational aspects as well
as the limitations of political
legal battles.

At the criticism/self-criticism
session Sunday afternoon, about 200
women discussed the successes and
failures of the conference in an open
atmosphere. The University of New
Mexico participant committed that
school to sponsoring the conference
next year, and for the first time:

a regional newsletter network was
established for women in the legal
field to begin to create an on-going
system of communication to combat the
political and personal alienation of
working in the legal system itself.
