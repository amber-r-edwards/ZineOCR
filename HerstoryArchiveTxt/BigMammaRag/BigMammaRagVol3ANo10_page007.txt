Misogynistic “Snuff” Films

Murder is Entertainment

A macabre set of porno-
graphic movies — which
culminate in the actual murder
and dismemberment of the
actress — have been the object
of a nationwide investigation by
police and FBI agents in recent
weeks.

Called “snuff films” or
“slashers” by pornography con-
noisseurs, these films are
reportedly available to a select
clientele for private viewing at a
cost of $1500 for a collection of
eight reels.

“I am quite convinced that
these films exist and that a person
is actually murdered,” said
Detective Sgt. Joseph Horman of
the New York Police Dept.’s
Organized Crime Control
Bureau. “I suppose you could
say they are the ultimate in
obscenity.”

Horman bases his belief on
“extremely reliable underworld
sources.” So closely guarded are
copies of the films, police here
complain, that two months of
constant effort have failed to yield
any prints.

Similarly, an investigation by
the FBI has so far not turned up
copies of the films.

“There are allegations that
these films exist,” FBI spokes-
man Tom Harrington said in
Washington. “We have an active
investigation going to determine
if they exist and if there is a
federal violation involved.”

That investigation has in-
volved FBI offices in Los
Angeles, Miami and other cities
— but the New York bureau has
so far not played a significant
role in the search.

Most recently, the Miami FBI
office entered the case when
agents received reports from
informants that “snuff films”
were circulating in that area.
According to Miami special
agent-in-charge Julius Mattson,
his office investigated the matter
a few weeks ago but was unable
to locate a copy.

Despite these difficulties,

some details of the bizarre
movies have been obtained from
underworld sources.

— There are apparently more
than one sex and murder film
circulating. The films are dis-
tributed by pornography mer-
chants associated with organized
crime, and they are offered
only to trusted customers.

— One film sources are
familiar with is said to have been
made in a Latin American na-
tion, possibly Argentina. The
film has been divided into eight
sequences. They are available
for home viewing on 8 mm. color
reels at a retail cost of $1500 for
the set. (The wholesale price is
said to be $300).

— The sequence reportedly
begins with an assortment of sex
acts between an actress and one
or more actors. But soon a knife
is produced and the horrified
woman, clearly unaware of the
true nature of her role — is
stabbed to death and then
savagely dismembered.

— Within recent weeks, a
private showing of the film was
reportedly held before a small
discreet audience at an undis-
closed location in New York City.
The purpose of the showing was
to sell the movie, and the
viewers were charged $200
each for the mere privilege of
witnessing it.

“Let's put it this way: There
are many, many rumors cir-
culating regarding snuff films,”
said Sgt. Donald Smith of the Los
Angeles police vice squad.

“So far, we don’t know of any
individual who possesses one,
but then — if there is such an
item in circulation — there are
probably a very small number of
them and they are closely guard-
ed.”

Moreover, difficult as the
investigation of the case has
been, police and FBI agents
suspect prosecution will be even
more problematical.

“The only law we have to use
against this thing is the law
which prohibits interstate trans-
portation of obscene material,”
one federal official complained.

In addition, he said, if such a
case came up “the defendants
would claim that the woman
was not really murdered and
that the film was really an art
form.”

The term “snuff film” itself
dates to the days of Charles
Manson and his family. It was
Manson who frequently used
the word “snuff” to mean
murder. And the phrase “snuff
film” came into being when it
was reported after Manson’s
arrest that his clan had filmed
ritual murders committed during
the late 1960s.

California police searched for
the films at the tumble-down
movie ranch near Los Angeles
where the Manson family lived
but found nothing.

One well-known porn-film
director here said reports circu-
lated recently that a producer
was looking for an actress to
take part in a murder flick.

“I heard rumors about six
months ago that a producer
offered a large amount of money
to someone who would be
murdered on film,” the porno-
grapher said. “Hopefully,
nothing came of it.”

The market currently abounds
with films depicting staged sex
rituals.

Bizarre and Violent

A recent survey of the peep-
shows offered in the Times
Square area indicates an in-
creasing number of films are
devoted to bizarre, violent rapes
and assaults — some complete
with simulated blood and dis-
figurement.

“Charlotte,” a recent X-rated
offering by director Roger
Vadim, told the story of a woman
who realized her fantasy of
being murdered in the midst of
erotic ecstasy.

Jury Acquits Pat Swinton

New York (LNS) — Patricia
(Shoshana) Swinton, accused by
the government of being the
chief propagandist of a 1969
bombing conspiracy during the
Vietnam War, was acquitted of
all charges September 26, after
a one-week trial and seven
hours of jury deliberation.

Loud cheering and applause
erupted in the courtroom as the
clerk read the not guilty verdicts
on the three conspiracy counts,
and Swinton rose and applauded
with her supporters as the jury
left the courtroom. Some of the
jurors later said they thought the
government's case had been
weak from the start.

Swinton was indicted, along
with three others, in 1970 on
charges of conspiring to bomb
federal buildings in Manhattan
in September and November,
1969. Two of her co-defendants,
Sam Melville and David Hughey,
pleaded guilty and were
sentenced to jail. Swinton and
another co-defendant, Jane
Alpert, jumped bail in 1970 and
went underground. Alpert sur-
rendered to police in November,
1974 and Swinton was captured
last March.

Through the trial, Swinton’s
attorney Frederick Cohn main-
tained that she was on trial
“because she was a
revolutionary.” “An innocent
person caught in a web of
circumstances got terror-
stricken and fled,” Cohn stated
in his summation. “An innocent
person can fear being
humiliated in going through a
trial.”

United States attorney David
Cutner, unable to show any
direct evidence of Swinton’s
involvement in the bombings,
built a circumstantial case based
on the testimony of 21
witnesses.

Jane Alpert and David Hughey
were called by the prosecution
but they refused to testify and
were cited for contempt of court.
“My conscience does not allow
me to testify,” stated Hughey,
who was immediately sent to
jail. Alpert, who had earlier
talked at length with the FBI,
also refused to testify and was
cited for contempt.

The government's key witness
in the trial was George
Demmerle, a member of the
John Birch Society and the
Minute Men before he infiltrated
several anti-war organizations,
including Sam Melville's group,
for the FBI.

Demmerle claimed that
Melville had told him that Swin-
ton had written press com-
muniques after the bombings.
Hearsay such as this is ad-
missible evidence under the
conspiracy law.

However, under cross-
examination by Cohn,
Demmerle admitted, “I never
saw Pat Swinton engaged in an
act of violence,” and also ad-
mitted that he had no knowledge
of her actually participating in
bombings. With apparent reluc-
tance, Demmerle also admitted
he helped Melville “build a
bomb.”

Another government witness,
New York City detective Jack D.
Godoy, testified that he had
infiltrated several leftist
organizations, including the
Revolutionary Contingent to
which Swinton had belonged.
Under cross-examination by
Cohn, Godoy admitted he helped
organize the group.

In the government's summa-
tion to the jury, Cutner sar-
castically stated that the
evidence showed Swinton “just
happened to leave with a man
who pleaded guilty to the bom-
bing conspiracy.” Cutner told the
jury to use “common sense” in
considering the evidence that he
claimed showed Swinton’s guilt.

In his summation to the jury,
defense attorney Cohn stated,
“This is not a case of common
sense,” but one to which the
rule of law must be applied to
prove guilt “beyond a reason-
able doubt.” The defense did not
present any witnesses.

Denver Women’s
Resources

Where can women in Denver
go for written information
sources oriented to women? If
you're looking for current infor-
mation, easily accessible, one of
the best places is the Denver
Women’s Resource Center
(222-0879), located downtown
at 25 E 16th, where there are
huge bulletin boards dealing
with 20 different woman-
oriented subjects. Newspaper
articles, notices and information
sheets are tacked up through-
out the room. Another source of
current information is a subject-
divided file cabinet at the
Virginia Neal Blue Resource
Center for Women (399-8303)
in Pulliam Hall #6 at Colorado
Women's College. The file has
been developing since 1973 and
women are welcome to use the
materials within the center. A
Xerox machine is nearby. The
Research Center on Women
(936-8441 ext. 290) located at
Loretto Heights College also has
a subject-divided file and it is
good for the years 1965-1970. If
your information needs go back
further in time, try the library at
the Rocky Mountain News (892-
5000). It has kept files of their
articles on several women-
oriented topics (such as women
athletes, women’s rights,
women’s liberation) since 1951.
If you need even more historical
information the Western History
Collection of the Denver Public
Library (673-5152 ext 245) can
help.

National Information

The above sources are good
for local information on women,
but if you want to go on an
information search nationwide
in nature then you have a couple
of options. One of them is at the
library of the C.U. Denver Center
(892-1117 ext. 227), which
holds a microfilm copy of hun-
dreds of women’s journals and
periodicals originally collected at
the Women’s History Library in
Berkeley. The title index for
these is a book in the reference
collection, call #HO 1410472.
Unfortunately, this collection is
not subject indexed, but there
are women working on such a
project. Another option is to get
up to the Archive of Contem-
porary History, at the University
of Wyoming in Laramie ($10.90
for a round trip bus ticket). They
have the most complete
holdings of the entire Women’s
History Library which used to be
in Berkeley, but has since dis-
banded. Much of the collection is
subject indexed. The Women’s
History Research Center, 2325
Oak St. Berkeley, CA 94708,
sells microfilmed copies of what
used to be in the Women’s
History Library. You can write to
them for catalogs of what they
have or send a donation. We
need to keep women-oriented
information sources alive!

Colleges

Most of Denver's academic
communities have begun some
sort of Women’s resource
center. Arapahoe Community
College Women’s Resource
Center (794-1550 ext 356) has a
100 book collection, indexed by
author and title. Denver Univer-
sity Women’s Center (753-
3511) has a small unindexed
collection.

The public libraries are
another possibility, but probably
the most enjoyable place to learn
more about women via the
printed page is the Woman-to-
Woman Bookcenter (320-5972)
at 2030 E. Colfax. There is a
reference library, browsing is
welcome, and there are comfor-
table chairs. The entire store’s
stock is author indexed, but most
of the staff can help you find
things on a particular topic.
