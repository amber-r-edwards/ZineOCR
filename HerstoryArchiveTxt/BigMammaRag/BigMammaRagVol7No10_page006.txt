Balancing the Ball

A federal judge has ordered Michi-
gan State University to provide the
same meals and room allotments for
members of its women's basketball
team as it does for its men's. The
University acknowledged that there is
a "slight imbalance": $13,500 for the
women's team, and $120,000 for the
men.

Playing the Field

Crystal Fields, 11, became the first
girl to win a championship in the an-
nual Pitch-Hit-Run competition spon-
sored by the major leagues for little
leaguers. An outfielder for the Cumb-
erland Phillies, Crystal outpointed
seven boys in the final of her age
division; she has an impressive bat-
ting average of .528 and wants to be
a major league baseball player when
she is older.

Miniscule to Tiny

The Project on Equal Education
Rights' report on female participa-
tion in three traditionally male
areas of school life shows that in
vocational education, women now num-
ber one in ten in traditionally male
courses. Seven years ago, before pas-
sage of Title IX, women were one in
17. Less than 2% of students in
"male" vocational courses in Delaware
are women, putting that state in
last place; other states on the bot-
tom-- Idaho, Kentucky, Arkansas, and
Hawaii-- hover around 5%. Michigan
comes in first with 20% female enroll-
ment. In sports, 49% of Iowa's inter-
scholastic athletes are girls; in
Alabama it's 15%. The national aver-
age of 33% participation by girls is
nearly double what it was in 1972.

While information about women's
rights movements is no longer used
for comic relief in US history books,
women still skirt the edges of his-
tory as it is currently presented,
according to a recent study by the
Feminist Press. In 1974, one out of
every 500-800 pages of US history
was devoted to women; new books spend
an average of 14 pages on women.
Calling for a redefinition of “his-
tory," the report, "Women in High
School US History Texts: Where Are
the Changes?" points out that new
texts still ignore or gloss over sub-
jects like childcare and the birth
control movement, concentrating in-
stead on political and military
events, the traditional domain of
white men.

Policing Sexuality

An attempt to close a runaway child-
ren's shelter which employed a lesbian
counselor has failed. A Houston police
officer "out to make a name for him-
self," according to the shelter's dir-
ector, arrested Sue Bennett after
learning of her lesbianism and charged
her with sexual indecency with minors.
The jury took only 20 minutes to acquit
Bennett after learning the girl in-
volved in the case had been pressured
into making false accusations. Said
Bennett, “I think the jury realized
that you would have to look far before
you find abuse of a child by a les-
bian. The real issue involved is
whether or not gay people have the
right to work counseling children."

Break That Wing

Margo St. James, founder of the
prostitutes union, Coyote, is quoted
in a letter she wrote to French fem-
inist Simone de Beauvoir, which ap-
pears in a recent issue of New
Women's Times: "The small right wing
faction (in the US) has become very
vocal against abortion and the Equal
Rights Amendment, for the death pen-
alty and prohibition, against welfare
and taxes, for the military and the
draft, and all in the name of saving
the children, not the planet. I am
sure they would agree with Professor
Lewis Smith of Ireland who recently
said that women, i.e., wives, working
outside the home endanger marriage
by developing lesbian tendencies.
They are the capitalists who claim
it is God's Way, and since God's name
is imprinted on our money, it makes
it easy. But woe to the women who try
to get any of it."

Warding Off Sexism

In October, the government charged
in US District Court in Phoenix that
Montgomery Ward and Co. illegally
paid some women employees less than
their male counterparts. It asked a
federal judge for a nationwide in-
junction to halt the practice.
Ward's is a subsidiary of Mobil Oil.

Uniroyal Deflated

Uniroyal, the nation's third larg-
est tire manufacturer, agreed Oct-
ober 23rd to pay $5.2 million to
more than 750 women in a sex discri-
mination case that had kept the firm
from getting government contracts.
The settlement, which makes Uniroyal
eligible for federal money again,
will affect current and former women
employees at Uniroyal's Mishawaka,
Indiana plant.

Prove-It-On-Me-Blues

At first glance, the recent deci-
sion of the US Supreme Court on min-
ors' rights appears to be a victory
for women's right to abortion. The
Court upheld the right of a minor to
an abortion without parental consent.
As part of the same decision, however,
the Court upheld a Massachusetts law
which requires a minor to convince
a judge that she is “mature” enough
to choose to have an abortion. If the
judge decides the abortion is not in
her "best interest," he may prevent
the abortion and involve her parents.

The ruling states: “If the minor
satisfies the court that she has at-
tained sufficient maturity to make a
fully informed decision, she then is
entitled to make her abortion deci-
sion independently." The National
Abortion Rights Action League asked
in a recent newsletter: "How indepen-
dent is she if she must ask permis-
sion from a judge?"

Fetus Fetishists

Six people accused of staging a
sit-in and bodily blocking the area
between a physician's waiting room
and medical procedure room were acquit-
ted of trespassing charges recently
in St. Louis. The Missouri Circuit
Court jury acquitted them under the
“doctrine of necessity" which permits
civil disobedience if the people com-
mitting the act believe that a life
is at stake. This is the first time
a jury has accepted such a defense in
an abortion clinic invasion case.

Sit On It

From an Associated Press
"Women should be serving in many com-
bat posts now restricted to men in the

Jeanne Holm (Ret.), former Director of
Women in the Air Force. For example,
she told a Congressional hearing, men
are not uniquely qualified to launch
nuclear missiles.”

Win a Woman

An Italian television station is of-
fering a woman as top prize in an on-
going TV quiz. The weekly Saturday
night show, called “Wild Nightshirt,"
is offering the winner of their "Eros

one of the show's female cast members.
They didn't say if the prize remained
the same for a female winner of the
contest.

Beauty Shopper Sham

The multi-million dollar Shoppers
Drug Mart drug store chain, under the
guise of promoting women's “beauty”
as being in the same league as health
and fitness, wants to suck $100 million
out of the hard-earned pocketbooks of
women by the end of what Shopper's
president Murray Koffler calls "The
Beautiful '80's." The message from
Shoppers is if you don't wear blood
red polish, the wet-look lipstick and
gobs of gunk on your face, you're not
attractive, and the company is camo-
flaging the trite hype under the ban-
ner of "fitness." To quote Koffler,
"It will be a glorious day when we will
know that beauty has joined the basics
of health and fitness for which Shop-
pers Drug Mart stores have always been
known, and we will become the communi-
ty center that protects and maintains
the health, fitness and beauty of all
its citizens."

Suburbanite Takeover

A federal policy designed to "de-
concentrate” the poor from inner-city
areas is drawing increasing fire from
community activists throughout the US.
The activists charge that the program,
administered by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD),
is just another way to remove poor
people from their neighborhoods in
favor of rich whites who are anxious
to move back into inner-city areas.

{UD Unleashed

After six years of experimenta-
tion on 2 million women outside the
US, the Searle Company received per-
mission from the Food and Drug Admin-
istration to market a new intrauter-
ine device (IUD) called the Tatum-T,
or the Copper-T. Searle reports that
like the most widely prescribed IUD
in the US, the Copper-7, the Tatum
is smaller than standard IUDs.
Its contraceptive activity is "en-
hanced" by the release of copper in-
to the uterus; it is not known how
the presence of copper in the womb
prevents conception.

Tying Up Testimony

A Board of Inquiry planned by the
government to consider whether a
controversial birth control shot
should be marketed as a contraceptive
in the US could act to “cover up"
vital data, a national patients-
rights group recently charged. “The
manufacturer of Depo-Provera, UpJohn
Company, would much rather have a
panel of scientists rummaging through
dog studies than a courtroom packed
with women who could testify that
they have suffered chemical sterili-
ty through use of the drug,“ said
Barbara Halstead, director of the
Institute for the Study of Medical
Ethics.

Fan Their Flames

Six Los Angeles firemen, including
a Captain, have been sued for sexual
harassment by Sally Ann Byrne, a para-
medic. Byrne charged the firemen in
Superior Court with forcing her to
perform an unnamed degrading sexual
act, and threatened to strip her and
shave off her pubic hair if she failed
to comply.

Gift-Wrapped Genocide

With the advent of Western medicine
and practices, many Indian mothers on
Canada's reserves have switched from
breast to bottle feeding their ba-
bies. A study just completed among
Indians in two isolated communities
in Northern Manitoba shows this
change as one of the main contribu-
tors to sickness and death among In-
dian children. It was found that ful-
ly bottle-fed babies were in hospit-
als with infectious diseases 10 times
more frequently the first year of
life than breast-fed babies. Just as
in Third World countries where Nest-
lé has been guilty of pushing form-
ulas instead of breast feeding, hos-
pitals give Indian mothers a gift-
wrapped parcel of various baby form-
ulas when they are discharged after
childbirth.
