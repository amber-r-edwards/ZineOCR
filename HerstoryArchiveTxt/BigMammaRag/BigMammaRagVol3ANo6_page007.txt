NATIONAL

Feminist Credit Union

A Feminist Credit Union is
being formed in the San Fran-
cisco Bay Area by a coalition of
women’s groups. A credit union
is an alternative financial in-
stitution. A feminist credit union
has the potential to meet some
immediate needs and build a
base for working out longer
range solutions. There are
already feminist credit unions in
Detroit, Washington, D.C., San
Diego, and New Haven, Conn.
The Detroit Feminist Credit
Union, in operation the longest
(a little over a year), now has
assets of a quarter of a million
dollars, acquired from the
women's community.

If you wish to pledge an
investment, or if you wish to help
organize the credit union, con-
tact the Bay Area Feminist
Federal Credit Union, 63 Brady
Street, San Francisco, 94103.
Telephone (415) 431-1180.

Waitress Files Suit

Judith Quist, a waitress fired
from a Sommers, Connecticut,
restaurant, the Plaza, because
she refused to shave her legs,
has filed a sex discrimination
suit against her former
employer.

North Carolina Rape Law.
An 1864 North Carolina deci-
sion that boys under 15 are
physically impotent has led
North Carolina judge Gordon
Gentry to dismiss the case of the
rape of a 12-year-old girl,
allegedly by a 13-year-old boy,
who would have been charged
with second degree rape.

Feminist Filmmakers

To expand the opportunities
for feminist filmmakers and
viewers, Iris Films is organizing
a nationwide series of film
showings called the National
Women's Film Circuit. In order to
select films for the circuit, a film
festival is planned in
Washington, D.C. this summer.
The festival will last as long as
there are women’s films to
show. Filmmakers who are
interested in the festival should
write to Iris for information. All
entry forms must be sent in by
July 1, 1975. Films are due on
August 1. The best of the festival
films will be sent on tour across
the country. This will be the first
package of films to travel around
the National Women’s Film
Circuit which will include twenty
cities. The circuit will expand in
the future and each city included
will receive a new film package
about every six months.
Proceeds from the film showings
will be divided among the film-
makers, Iris Films, and local
producers for the circuit in each
city.

Iris Films is the newest among
a growing number of feminist
businesses which are
succeeding beyond our wildest
imagining of a few years ago.
They need to hear from women
with films for the festival; equip-
ment to loan or give away; skills
of all kinds to share (filmmak-
ing, legal, financial,
promotional). And, of course,
they also need money. Tell them
what you can offer and what you
would like to see them doing.

Women’s Music Festival

A women’s music festival is
being planned in San Diego,
Calif., for September 5-7.
Everyone is urged to bring their
instrument (or spoons and
bottles) even if not planning to do
a gig on stage, as playing around
the fire at night is planned.
Childcare will be provided, and
women will be selling good,
inexpensive food, though
everyone is welcome to bring
their own. No dogs will be allow-
ed.

$5.00 per person is being
asked for the three days to cover
the costs of land, sound systems
and women to work on them,
licenses, insurance, chemical
toilets, etc. Also, the organizers
want to pay at least the bands’
gas expenses. Any extra money
would be appreciated for the
inevitable unexpected expenses
and to balance the fact that in
these hard times of unemploy-
ment, some women may not be
able to pay the whole amount.

If you are planning on atten-
ding please contact: San Diego
Women’s Music Festival, 4884
Del Mar Street, San Diego,
Calif, 92107, no later than
August 15. Be especially sure to
indicate if you are coming with
children so that good childcare
can be provided and/or if you
plan on doing a workshop. To
save on mailing costs no tickets
will be mailed back, but names
will be filed at the gate so that
the women working can give out
tickets when you arrive. Make
checks payable to Alicia Neff.

Musicians are asked to in-
dicate what kind of music you
play, how long you intend to
play, what your financial situa-
tion is, and if you'll need any
equipment or props.

New York Women Protest
Administration Of Cancer
Detection Program

(LNS) — “Do it our way or not
at all,” the New York Cancer
Society has ordered the Con-
cerned Citizens of Canarsie, a
Brooklyn group sponsoring a five
day breast cancer screening
program.

The source of the dispute is
the community demand that
women be pre-registered and
appointments be made to avoid
“herding them like cattle.”

“If we can serve only 140
women a day, there's no reason
to have 100,000 people
in line,” stated the chairperson
of the Canarsie group. “We'd
rather do it with decorum and
make the women feel like peo-
ple, not cattle.”

But the Cancer Society dis-
agreed and the Brooklyn field
representative has said “As far
as I'm concerned, Canarsie has
already been canceled.”

Southern Feminist
Connection

A new Southern women's
publication, Southern Feminist
Connection, began publication
in May. Subscription cost is
$2.00 per year. Those interested
in subscribing or contributing
may contact Sandye Mullins, 87
Woodcroft Place No. 5, Stone
Mountain, Georgia, 30083.

Women Prisoners
Should Be Domestics

Oklahoma Corrections Board
Chairman Irv Ungerman
suggested on May 30, that
prisoners in the Oklahoma City
women’s prison be trained and
employed as domestics.

“In talking with my friends at
several recent social
gatherings,” the wealthy Tulsa
attorney said, “they have men-
tioned that there is a great lack of
good domestic help.”

From Page 1

at the pre-trial hearings, they
were denied access to the
chambers until the last moment,
made to sign their names and
show identification before they
were permitted to enter, and
photographed without their per-
mission from behind locked
glass doors. When they were
finally directed to the courtroom,
fifteen minutes before the
arraignment was scheduled to
begin, they found the room
already three-quarters filled
with white men in suits and ties,
none of whom had been stopped
or checked in any way at the
entrances. Whose privilege?
Within a few days of Susan’s
arrest, the FBI moved in directly
beneath the apartment she had
shared with Byrna Aronson,
where Byrna still lives. They
have approached Byrna’s
friends and peripheral acquain-
tances, and sometimes even
their employers as well, in an
attempt to secure information.
Women in Philadelphia, dis-
tributing leaflets informing in-
dividuals of their right to remain
silent in the event of FBI
questioning, were harassed for
hours into the early morning by
police who failed to inform them
of their rights, or even to tell
them whether or not they were
under arrest.

The point is not that one of us
has been found out committing
crimes against property. The
point is that the feminist move-
ment constitutes a threat to the
patriarchy, and the patriarchy
will do everything in its vast
power to put us down. Susan
Saxe, like Jane Alpert, is a
conspicuous individual, easy to
pick off. The Grand Juries are a
method of linking individuals in
such a way as to smear and
threaten us all.

in the back of the paddy wagon
with Susan, I realized that those
issues I had thought about for so
long meant the woman I loved
and knew as Val. Of course there
is strength that flows from her to
me. Now I know about those five
years of running, of giving up her
family and friends. I am grateful
to her that after she has been
through so much, she still had
time to share, to give, to teach
me. How could I not be strong
when she has to spend the rest

Today, if Byrna had the oppor-
tunity to know Katherine Power, she would.
“There's still a sister at large. If
you find the opportunity, offer
her refuge, be strong. Such
action is one alternative to
armed struggle for those people
who don't believe in the system.
What happened to me may
