Childhood

Fran Day

Most children's books portray women
in a limited range of occupations. It
is crucial that young girls read about
women who work a wide variety of jobs.
The following books, available at Wo-
man to Woman Bookcenter, show females
as doctors, pilots, presidents, fire-
fighters, and tractor drivers.

Girls Can Be Anything
Norma Klein
E.P. Dutton & Co., Inc.
$1.95/paper, for ages 5-10

Marina's best friend is Adam; they
enjoy playing together. Marina seeks
accurate information from her parents
to contradict Adam's claims that her
role is limited. He tells her, for ex-

ample, that she must be the nurse and
he the doctor. Marina's parents consis-
tently reinforce the idea that she can
be anything when she grows up. The two
children eventually work out an arrange-
ment where they share equally the
high-status pretend roles and the auxi-
liary ones without regard to gender.
Marina imagines herself as a doctor, a
pilot, and the president of the United
States. Even though we as yet have had
no female president of the U.S., the
statement of possibility is important
and the expectation of eventual real-
ity must be imparted to young readers.

Annette learned how to drive a trac-
tor when she was a little girl living
on a farm. Years later when she was
job hunting, she applied for a job
driving a Cat to build freeways.
In spite of the foreman's doubts she
easily passed her driving test and
got the job; her assignment was to
teach other women to drive tractors.

This book has space for the young
reader to draw her own illustrations.

Sheilah Yin and a firefighter named

tual fire, and got a job at the local
fire station.

Give Me Your Good Ear
Maureen Brady
Spinsters, Ink.

$4.50/paper, at Woman to Woman

Sharon M. Cornwell

Maureen Brady's first novel begins
with Francie Kelly's description of
that childhood game, crack-the-whip.
The game is the outline for the story
to follow. You've heard, or lived,
stories like this. Grandmother, mother,
daughter, selecting, adjusting to,
passing on, and finally trying to break
out of roles dictated or made expedient
by what once existed, reinforced by
what is. Francie Kelly's mother learned
too well the role of kneeling, ad-
justing, and self-effacing from her
mother, Francie's grandmother. Francie
caught it like a disease that attacked
her stomach first, making her feel like

throwing up. But seeing isn't the same
as eliminating the parasite, and the
adult Francie finds herself stuck in

a relationship that mows her down but
she is unable to break away.
With skill, Brady introduces Francie
and simultaneously unwinds the story
that made her who she is. The ten-year-
old angrily snapping the dishrag to
punctuate her righteous indignation
at being forced to labor out of turn,
the girl with the knot tightening in
her stomach, the woman committed to
work that isn't so much a career as
an integral part of her life, the lover
of a tiresome man who demands a lot
but doesn't give anymore back--all
Frances Catherine Kelly. Brady lets
Francie herself tell us about her life
and she does so with an irony cognizant

of the interacting webs of exper-
ience that go into making a human be-
ing.

Like people we know ourselves, Fran-

cie sometimes delights us when ex-
plaining to Megan, her older sister,
that she need not fear lightning be-

cause if it did in fact strike the old
tree, making it fall, it was more in
line with her bed than Megan's while
realizing that she herself wasn't
afraid because after all, if the light-

ning did hit the tree, it “would be
an event... It would change our lives.
They'd have to come with a crane to get
it out and Megan and I would have to
sleep somewhere else." Other times,
Francie makes us chafe with frustration
at the strictures that bind her, at
passivity, and deep-rooted hesitations.

SPINSTERS, INK.

But Francie stumbles sometimes for-
ward, sometimes back, in an attempt
to unlearn the lessons of her child/
adulthood: keep a man, any man; living
alone is bad; care about women, but not
that way; smile, be nice. She is trying
to break the chain that transmitted
messages like an electric shock from
generation to generation, trying to
release the anger that originated high-
er up in the chain, to deal herself
with what happened the night of the
storm.

A role picked up by grandmother,
passed on to mother, is paralyzing Fran-
cie now. Why was it learned and why did
it stick, and why did what happened
happen, and why wasn't it talked about?
Francie, at the end of the whip, trans-
lating the learned responses into
seventies behavior, runs faster to
keep up and maybe to break through in-
to something better. She faces the past
surging, full force forward and some-
thing has to snap.
