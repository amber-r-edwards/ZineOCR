ELEANOR GISH CROW

Back to do graduate work before  
it was fashionable and with  
criticism from many women. I  
am anxious to let women see the  
ways in which male chauvinist  
philosophy permeates our world  

so that they too can do  
something about it. I believe  
that I brought up my two  

daughters to be Feminists, or at  
least to value their importance  
as individuals, and to plan  
careers for themselves. My older  
daughter is just finishing law  
school at CU. My younger  
daughter graduated from  
Oberlin College last May and is  
now studying violin seriously in  
New York City with the goal of  
a musical career. My husband  
has accepted some role reversals  
- having volunteered to take over  
the washing and ironing. He is  
now partially retired, which has  
brought about some other  
changes in my attitudes towards  
traditional roles.

I think that the priority for  
the future must be to open up  
the employment world fully so  
that women will no longer be  
“cheap labor” and exploited.  
This requires that back-up  
services be provided for women  
with young children - day-care  
centers and innovative methods  
of allowing two persons to share  
one full-time position.

CAROL HOUSE

I have been involved in the  

Women’s Movement for a few —  

years now, and during that time  
my activities have changed a  
great deal. My goal, in terms of  
women’s rights, is to obtain full  
economic, political, and social  
rights for women. Two years ago  
I thought that the Women’s  
Movement was a revolutionary  
vanguard movement. I saw  
sexual oppression and sex  
discrimination as the primary  
oppression that was common to  
the masses of people in this  
country and the world. I called  
myself a Radical Feminist.

Since that time, I have moved  
away from active participation  
in many women's groups,  
including Big Mama Rag and am  
now working mostly in mixed  
political groups. I still believe  

that the end to sex  
discrimination and the  
attainment of full democratic  
rights for women is in the  

interests of the broad masses of  
the people, but I do not think  
that the present Women’s  
Movement can attain these goals!  

Although the women’s movement has  
been instrumental in raising the  
issue of the oppression of  
women as a group, the  
over-emphasis on such issues as  
“sexual freedom,” abortion, and  
an anti-male/anti-marriage/  
anti-family attitude has turned  
away many third world and  
working class women who are  
concerned primarily with issues  
which concretely affect their  

lives - such as equal pay for  
equal work, their double  
oppression as Third World  

women, day care, welfare rights,  
housing issues, etc. - I no longer  
see that sexual oppression is the  
primary oppression which  
women suffer. I see that our  
society is a class society and that  
therefore all working people  
suffer economic oppression. The  
major contradiction is not  
between men and women, but  
between workers and capitalists.  
Sexism is only one of the tools  
that the capitalist (or ruling)  
class uses to oppress people who  
have to work for their living.  
Another glaring example is  
racism. These methods are  
employed to create divisions  
between workers and pit one  
against another. I see sexism as  
part of a larger class struggle in  
which all working people, men  
and women alike, must join  
together for the betterment of  
all. This is not to say that  
women should push aside issues  
of sexism, but that sexism must  
be dealt with in a constructive  
way, keeping in mind who the  
enemy really is. The enemy is  
not men in general, it is the  
economic and political system  
which encourages and practices  
racism and sexism.

I think that the Women’s  
Movement must speak to these  
issues more forcefully and more  
persistently, and must learn to  
speak to the concrete,  
immediate, and practical needs  
of working women. In addition  
the Women’s Movement must  
learn to develop an overall  
political and economic analysis  
of this society.

1. I am a woman who has carried  
a sense of the way the world  
should be from a very young  
age. I have never enjoyed the  
inferior status relegated to me as  
a girl or as a woman. I have  
always been a rebel, a tomboy, a  
“cocky bitch,” because I have  
never accepted the role my  
family and culture have prepar-  
ed for me.

I had been searching for many  
years for a word to describe the  
ideas and feelings I've had. After  
two years in the left, fighting for  
primarily male-dominated  
causes, I joyously discovered the  

word Feminism.

I found strength and stimulus  
in other women who were  
coming to the same realizations  
as I, and we formed one of the  
first women’s groups in Carbon-  
dale, I. We were primarily a CR  
group, but because of the  
political upheaval on the South-  
ern Illinois University campus  
that spring, we had to learn to  
trust each other in crisis situa-  
tions. Experiences such as riots,  

MAUREEN MRIZEK

a police raid, tear gas bombings,  
and even jail forced me to really  

depend on and trust other  
women.  
After moving to Denver, I  

found that some Feminists here  
had not undergone the same  
kind of “shock” program I had.  
Although the intellectual theo-  
ries we shared were similar, the  
gut feelings and the trust in one  
another were very restrained.

Nevertheless, I sought out  
women who were acting to  
express their guerilla theatre and  
found that to be a very invigor-  
ating experience. My activism  
produced such an incredible  
amount of energy and enthusi-  
asm that I became involved in  
many different Feminist acti-  
vities. One of the most note-  
worthy is this newspaper. Big  
Mama Rag has been and will be  
a source of pride and encourage-  
ment for me.

2. Feminism is responsible in  
many ways for the way I view  
myself and other women. I am  
proud of being a woman, proud  
of the potential I’ve developed  
and the potential I see in other  
women. I enjoy being with  
women, I think we’re beautiful.  
I love the energy and intensity  
women create with each other.  
Feminism has opened my eyes  
to the possibilities of seriously  
pursuing a career in law or  
music, or both. And when I say  
serious, I mean that; a half-assed  
attempt will not do for me  
anymore. Feminism has made  
me take myself seriously.

Feminism affects the way I  
relate to other women because  
I have learned to analyze the  
dynamics of a relationship and  
hopefully move toward an egali-  
tarian goal. Being a Lesbian, I  
find my Feminism both a  
positive and negative force.  
Many Lesbians do not under-  
stand, or care to understand,  
Feminism and tend to relate to  
women in the same ways men  
relate to women. This evokes  
the same anger in me that  
sexism coming from men does.  
On the other hand, my Femin-  
ism — when I relate to other  
Lesbian/Feminists, helps clear  
the way for a more progressive  
type of relationship.

3. As for future priorities I  
think we should institutionalize  
Feminism. No, not in a mental  
ward; we should create our own  
institutions which will enable us  
to develop and be the most  
complete and creative people we  
can be. When I say institutions,  
I mean things like a Feminist  
Savings and Loan Association, a  
credit union, educational funds,  
medical programs, maybe even a  
Feminist church, using Feminist  
doctrine and drawing upon mat-  
riarchal history. I want us to be  
here to stay and have the most  
force and impact we possibly  
can have on the culture we're  
here to change.

FERN GAPIN

I have been politically active  

since 1969, when I became  
chairwoman of the Boulder  
Student Mobilization  

Committee, the largest anti-war  
group in Colorado. In 1970, the  
year that I joined the Young  
Social Alliance (YSA), I was  
active in the Boulder Women’s  
Liberation Coalition, and helped  
to found “Coloradoans Against  
All Abortion Laws,” which later  
became the Mountain States  
Women's Abortion Coalition  
(MSWAC). In 1972, I ran on the  
Socialist Workers Party ticket  

for U.S. House of  
Representatives in District 1.  
Presently, I am an active  
member of the Student  
Women’s Coalition and the  
Farmworker’s Support  

Committee at Metropolitan  
State College, where I am a  
student. I’m also on the  
Executive Committee of the  
Denver Young Socialist  
Alliance. When I realized that the  
goals of Feminism could not be  
achieved in this society - that  
capitalism, with its  
overwhelming drive for profits  
and its built-in exploitation,  
actually requires the oppression  
of women - I became a Socialist  
as well as a Feminist. I joined  
YSA, a revolutionary socialist  
youth organization, and two  
years later, I joined the Socialist  
Workers Party. My political  
activity is the most important  
part of my life. Changing this  
society into a humane, socialist  
society where women, and all  
other oppressed groups will be  
able to achieve real liberation  
has top priority for me. I see  
myself being involved in  
Feminist activities up until,  
during, and after the socialist  
revolution.

There are certain priorities  
which have risen organically out  
of the Women’s Movement  
demands for 24-hour  
community-controlled child  
care, equal job and educational  
opportunities, and women’s  
control of their bodies. I think  
one of another of these demands  
will be at the center of my  
struggles that develop with a  
Feminist focus. Right now, the  
fight for passage of the Equal  
Rights Amendment is very  
important, requiring active  
support from the entire  
Women’s Movement. A very  
exciting “new” development,  
which is really the continuation  
of past, unfinished struggles, is  
the organization of trade union  
women. A new, younger,  
Feminist leadership is now  
stepping forward in the union  
movement. I am certain that we  
will see developments like this  
occurring on a massive scale in  
the future.

KAREN MARINIACE

I have worked as a social  
worker and a therapist in  
Colorado for over six years.  
Most of the time I live with  
John Marinace and our  
five-year-old son, David. I have  
been involved in the Women's  
Movement for 3½ years and  
involvement has been both  
personal and political... I don't  
believe I could separate the two.

In my first real CR group, I  
learned that I could care about  
other women, and began really  
caring about myself. I made  
demands in my marriage which  
allowed me more freedom and  
recognition for my strengths.  
Personally, I have felt a rebirth  

process in which I became more  

free to be myself. Politically, I  
have spoken on women’s issues  
to groups of students, ministers,  
church women, social workers,  
and psychiatrists. I entered my  
son in a Feminist day care  
effort, which grew into the Lucy  
Stone Cooperative, in which we  
worked together to raise our  
children in a non-sexist setting.

Feminism became an impor-  
tant part of my activities in the  
radical therapy movement.  
Another woman therapist and I  
started a Single Mother’s Group,  
composed of young women who  
had decided to keep their  

babies, rather than to give them  

up for adoption.

I have always supported the  
activist part of the movement,  
and have taken part in  
demonstrations, speak-outs, and  

courtroom activities. I believe,  

however, that real political  
change begins within each of us.  
People begin to listen when  
discarding sex role stereotypes  
means freedom for both sexes to  
become persons. I find it  
important to confront even the  
smallest put-down or stereotype.  
Therapists must learn to treat  
their clients as persons, not as  
roles.

Sometimes it’s easier to  
maintain my own personhood at  
work or in casual relationships  
than it is at home. John and I  
have found that to be really  
separate persons sometimes we  
have to physically separate.

One of the challenges I see for  
the future is raising children in a  
nurturing non-sexist  
environment. Traditional  
marriage proves to be stifling for  
adults and children. All of the  
priorities of the Women’s  
Movement are important for  
me: women taking power,  
changing the media,  
consciousness-raising, supporting  
our sisters. The most significant  
priority for me in the future is  
to find ways for people to live  
together - big people, little  
people, men and women -  
without denying the needs or  
personhood of any.
