voices from our lives  
‘I Feel I Can't Win... I Can't See How  

we're fighting against is so  
powerful.  

It was hard for me to read Saralinda  
excerpts from her journal  
written just before she died.  

Dear Big Mama,  

voices from our lives  
I Can Live My Life Without Compromising  

I am sending you a page  
from the Special Women’s  
issue of Madness Network News,  
which came out in the sum-  
mer of 1977. You will find  

some writing by Saralinda  
Grimes, a Native American,  
ex-psychiatric inmate. I met  
Saralinda once or twice back  
then, but I started think-  
ing about her when I noticed  
that the North American In-  
dian Women's Issue of Sinis-  
ter Wisdom, called "A Gath-  
ering of the Spirit," was  

dedicated to Anna Mae Aquash  
and Saralinda. (Ed.'s note:  
Addresses for these publica-  
tions can be found in the  
ads section.)  

"A Gathering of Spirit" is  
a collection of writing by  
Native American women, edi-  
ted by a Native American  
woman, Beth Brant. I read  
most of it. (Having had  
electro-shock I find it dif-  
ficult to get in the mood to  
focus sufficiently to read.)  
I loved the short stories  

and the letters from women  
in prison. These women are  
being very honest about  
their struggles and about  

their feelings on the geno-  
cidal warfare and cultural  
annihilation the U.S. gov-  
ernment has been putting  
down on native people. There  
is an interview with a wo-  
man named Winona LaDuke,  
which details the incredi-  
ble nuclear contamination  
of Native American lands.  

I would copy for you this  
one poem I love so much  
by Alice Bowen, but I'm not  
sure about copyrights and  
all.  

My only disappointment is  
that none of Saralinda's  
writing was published in  
the issue, even though I  
know her writing was sent  
to Ms. Grant. I am not say-  
ing this as a criticism. I  
don't think I, as a non-  
Native American, have the  
right to criticize. I would  
love to see Saralinda's writ-  
ing published, so I'm send-  
ing it to Big Mama. I hope  
women support this issue by  
spending $6 on this deep  
book. I also hope that wo-  
men who read Saralinda's  
writing send it to other fem-  
inist publications. You see,  
Saralinda took her life in  
Berkeley, California in 1976.  
Her writing talks about sui-  
cide. I know it's a very scar-  
ey subject, because so many  
of us from time to time hov-  
er on the edge, thinking  
about leaving this oppres-  
sion, and most of us want to  
be pushed in the direction  

of writing, because her think-  
ing was so clear, so to the  
heart of it all. I almost  

died in a car accident and  
later I came very close to  
death during a suicide at-  
tempt, and I believe it is  
my destiny to stay here and  
keep struggling. I hope wo-  
men can learn to respect  

those who take their own  
life. I think if the women's  
community was more open to  
support each other honestly  
in our emotional and physi-  
cal struggles, deep, beauti-  
ful women like Saralinda  
would still be here struggl-  
ing with us.  

In sisterhood and  
struggle,  
Rose  

P.S. Thank you for the arti-  
cle on Gypsy women in the  
July, '83 issue and the story  
by Sue Doell about the lega-  
cy of psychiatric torture  

in that same issue.  

(Reprinted from Madness Net-  
work News.)  

Saralinda was a member of  
Women Against Psychiatric  
Assault who committed sui-  
cide last July (1976). Below  

Page 6 - Big Mama Rag, November, 1983  

We are reprinting them in  
the hopes that other women  
who share these feelings  
will know that they're not  
alone, that these feelings  
are valid; and in hopes that  
all of us who sometimes share  
Saralinda's desperation can  
support each other enough  
that we can find a better  

solution to problems she was  
so starkly confronting.  

I can't see how I can live  
my life without compromising.  
I don't want to live my life  
that way. If I try to live  
my life that way without  
compromising, then I know I  
will be defeated. Straight  
male money values are very  
powerful. I feel defeated  
before I begin.  

I want to fight, but feel  
so pessimistic. I feel I  
can't win. I feel alone  
because I'm not in touch  
with any women who are com-  
mitted, who are willing to  
put their lives on the line.  
I feel being alone will hurt  
me more than if I didn't  
continue to live another day.  
It would be more comforting  
to be with a group of women  
who feel as I do, but I  
think we would still end up  
dead. Eventually. What  

I don't want to go back to  
the hospital because it  
won't let me get away un-  
destroyed. If it was unable  
to force treatment on me,  

if I could do what I wanted  
to do in there, I could find  
support from more people,  
because being where I am I  
will be destroyed before I  

reach the people who could  
support me.  

I know I am down and not  
seeing some things. My feel-  
ings are very strong and  
real and it's going to kill  
me sooner or later. I am so  
bitter, angry, and frustra-  
ted. It is not "all in my  
head;" my feelings are due  
to this society.  

Some people expect me to  
fight this society instead  
of killing myself (let The  
Man destroy me). But why  
do these people demand it  
of me when they aren't even  
fighting? They are compro-  
mising. That's not for me.  
My feelings are too strong.  

I am a Lesbian. I am a  
Feminist. Why shouldn't I  
live my life as one without  
constant repercussions?  

Why should I live? I don't  
hate myself. I love myself  
enough to know I shouldn't  
stay here another day.  

I don't want people to  
grieve and mourn over me  
when I'm gone. I want them  
to be happy for me, not  
disappointed that I didn't  
just stay and fight or  
compromise, but be proud  
that I had the courage and  
intelligence to get the hell  
out.  

People say once I've done  
it, there's no coming back.  
I am sure as hell glad. What  
makes you think for one sec-  
ond that I should stay here?  
I see no solution for all  
this mess. Nor do I see an  
end. Too many and I mean  
too many people are used to  
compromising. A handful of  
people have stopped compro-  
mising, but they have been  
or will be destroyed. I  
don't want to give The Man  
that satisfaction. I want  
to save myself from any  
more torture. Stuart (a  
patient) always says "Stop  
torturing me." But they  
never do and never will un-  
til he's gone.  

I want to tell someone  
all this and have them  
convince me this isn't true,  
but I don't think anyone  
can lie to me that well.  

Not anymore.  

(Saralinda submitted the  
following letter to Speak-  
Out, an Albany, N.Y., femi-  
nist newsletter. It appeared  
in their March, 1976,  
issue.)  

Dear Sisters in Albany,  

It has been almost a year  
since I have left Albany,  
yet it seems longer than  
that for I have gone  
through many changes. This  
letter is very frustrating  
to write because I want to  
say so many things. It all  
started when I had reached  
the point where I was too  
frustrated to deal with  
this oppressive patriarchal  
system any longer. I took  
all the pills I could get  
my hands on, which included  
a bottle of Librium, Valium,  
and Darvon. I ended up on  
E2 at the Albany Medical  
Center for two weeks. I  
can't tell you what happen-  
ed there because I can't re-  
member much due to the  
"medication therapy" they  
gave me. But I do want to  
tell you about my struggle  
to survive through six  
months of being locked up  
in McLean's Hospital in  
Belmont, Mass., and close to  
one month of being in Hud-  
son River State Hospital in  
Poughkeepsie, N.Y.  

I want to tell you about  
my efforts to validate my  
feelings of anger and des-  

peration, of the oppression  
the society has placed on  
me, being a deaf eighteen-  
year-old Native American  
lesbian feminist.  

I want to tell you how my  
feelings were turned around  
and put back on me as being  
"paranoid," "inappropriate,"  
"over-reacting"—assumptions  
which in turn have made me  
feel isolated, alone and  
crazy.  

I want to tell you what  
happened when I tried to  
fight this system. The times  
I was carried off to seclu-  
sion (which is usually  
called the "quiet room" be-  
cause in order to get out,  
one has to show they are  
calm; or in other words that  
they have been silenced) by  
thirteen men, shot up with  
200 mgs of Thorazine,  
locked into an usually over-  
heated or under-heated room  
with one bare mattress,  
four walls covered with  
holes and chipped paint, a  
dented steel security screen  
covering the window and a  
door with no doorknob. But  
there was a little window  
which was used by the staff  
members to peer through to  
check on me, in order to  
make sure I hadn't managed  
to somehow kill myself to  
escape the torture.  

I want to tell you about  
the other women I saw become  
institutionalized and slowly  
destroyed. How they were  
constantly being sent back  
to the environment that sent  
them to the hospital in the  
first place. That is if they  
were ever discharged. The  
women in these hospitals  
were constantly told it was  
their fault and their prob-  
lem that they ended up  
where they were and that  
they must compromise.  

I want to tell you about  
how I became "institutional-  
ized." I laid out in the  
left lane of Route 128 in  
Mass. the night my hospital  
insurance ran out and McLean's  
planned on keeping me until  
they could find some "after-  
care" program that didn't  
cost me at least five hun-  
dred dollars a month, mean-  
while charging my parents  
five thousand dollars a  
month. I was sent to Hudson  
River State Hospital as a re-  
sult. I ran away after three  
weeks.  

I want to tell you about  
trying to make it on my own  
after spending five intense  
months in mental hospitals.  
How I found very little sup-  
port because I had to hide  
my feelings. People couldn't  
handle my feelings, which  
weren't all that much dif-  
ferent than before I first  
entered the hospitals. People  

were uncomfortable with me  
and my feelings because I  
had just gotten out of being  
in mental institutions. I  
found myself more isolated  
than ever. I felt so incom-  
petent by this time. The  
combination of the lack of  
support I was getting and  
all the incorporated fears  
of myself I had gotten from  
the previous five months  
caused me to end up in Mc-  
Lean's again for another two  
months. There was no other  
place to go and McLean's is  
supposed to be one of the  
best hospitals in the coun-  
try. I want to tell you of  
my determination to leave  
this world of oppression.  
How I then ended up in Max-  
imum Security.  

I want to tell you of a  
staff member who saved my  
life. A woman who gave me  
back my strength and cour-  
age to keep fighting, by  
recognizing my feelings and  
experiences as being very  
real. She introduced me to  
other lesbian feminists  
living in the Boston area.  
She gave me the in that pre-  
vented me from having to  
experience the pain new  
women usually have when try-  
ing to be accepted by lead-  
ing lesbian feminists. I  
watched her lose her job as  
a psychiatric nurse because  
she helped me learn the  
psychiatric system to use  
it against itself, so I  
could get out without being  
destroyed. She was the only  
woman within that system  
who felt I and other women  
in McLean's were important.

"St. Patrick's Day"  

Donna  

I dropped out of school when Paula told me you died.  
While you were coming home from your honeymoon, another car  

skidded in the rain,  
slammed into you.  
Separated me from you.  

I couldn't stop thinking about the look in your eyes the  

last time I saw you.  

Life felt too short to go on living what was expected of me.  
I sent my drawing portfolio and application to the art  

school,  

and left for California  
with a friend and a boy who advertised for riders.  
Thinking all the time about you, how  
At the pre-nuptial party the night before your wedding, we  

were wild and silly,  

just like nothing was changing between us.  
But at the wedding party you avoided me all night, until  

right before you left.  

You looked at me long and hard, such a strange look.  
And I swear, I felt you saying, "Rose, I'll never see you  

again."  

Between life and death,  

Feeling stunned and empty, on my way to California.  
The driver wouldn't stop to sleep or even let us drive.  
He crashed into a tree at Barstow.  

A truck driver pulled me from the wreck.  

Broken bones in my left leg and face, stitches, badly  

bruised ankles.  

Was Fate considering sending me to you?  

I miss you,  
of course.  

Wish I could call you and my mother on some satellite tele-  

phone connection  

to the other side.  
I've been through Living Hell.  

Still trying to get my strength back after  
the shock treatments and prolixin and lithium,  
even after so many years.  

Still living with the terror of the locked ward.  

After you died, Donna, I couldn't push the pain down anymore.  
I couldn't pretend that everything was alright anymore.  
I had to let myself feel the things going on in my mind.  

And I'm stronger for it.  

I miss you most every St. Patrick's Day.  

Donna, my most favorite friend forever:  

Kelly green paper and shamrocks on your bulletin board.  

You really loved being Irish!
