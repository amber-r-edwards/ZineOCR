Survivors

Four hundred women gathered  
at Stern College in New York  
recently at a conference for  
survivors of the Holocaust of  
World War II.  
The women shared their ex-  
periences and answered ques-  
tions about the work they did  
inside Nazi prison camps, the  
relationships they formed  
with each other, and the re-  
sistance efforts they con-  
ducted on the outside. Many  
of those in attendance said  
women often took the more  
dangerous assignments, such  
as smuggling people from one  
country to another or carry-  
ing weapons, food and docu-  
ments to those in hiding.

Fight Back!

An 18-year-old Broomfield,  
Colo., woman, who was being  
held at knifepoint, twisted  
two fingers of her attacker  
while she was being raped  
and he ran away.

An Arvada, Colo. woman  
staying in a motel room, was  
awakened by two men who broke  
into her room. While choking  
her, one of the men told her  
she would be raped and warned  
her not to scream. The woman  
told the attackers she inten-  
ded to fight. The men left.

When an intruder broke into  
the home of Paige Akers in  
Grand Rapids, Mich., when she  
was sleeping, Paige tossed  
the bed covers over him,  
wrestled him into the kitchen,  
punched him and slammed his  
head against the floor. Dur-  
ing the fight her roommate  
Debbie Marshall arrived home  
and helped subdue the man.  
Another roommate awakened and  
the three tied the man's  
hands behind his back, con-  
tacted the police, and handed  
him over to be arrested.

Sooo Secret

A new bill in Canada will  
create the Canadian Security  
Intelligence Service and le-  
galize many now illegal re-  
pressive methods and surveil-  
lance techniques. The opera-  
tions of the Service are so  
secret that a person could  
be jailed for 5 yrs. for iden-  
tifying one of them in public.  
The Service has been given  
blanket approval to "monitor  
activities in support of...  
acts of violence...for the  
purpose of achieving a poli-  
tical objective within Cana-  
da or a foreign state". No-  
where does the bill say that  
the activities have to be un-  
lawful.

“Crazy" Talk?

In 1921 in Philadelphia, Ka-  
terina Yasinchuk was stopped  
by the police, because she was  
wandering the streets in tears.  
She did not respond to English;  
her speech was incoherent to  
them and they took her to a  
mental institution. She be-  
came a ward of the state. For  
six years she continued to  
speak, but in 1927 stopped  
talking and only walked about  
or stared at the walls.

It wasn't until 48 years la-  
ter that hospital officials,  
reviewing her commitment,  
discovered that the words she  
made were in her native lan-  
guage--Ukrainian--that she had  
been despondent over the  
deaths of her husband and  
baby at the time of her incar-  
ceration. She died Monday at  
86 in a nursing home, 13 years  
after being released from the  
state hospital at Byberry.

Asbestos Cell

A group of inmates at Mass.  
Correctional Center Institu-  
tion have recently filed a  
civil lawsuit against the  
state; fighting to clean up  
the asbestos contamination  
they live with daily. The in-  
mates are seeking medical ex-  
aminations from time to time  
relative to asbestos related  
diseases. The inmates have  
also asked for an injunction  
to prevent prison employees  
from harassing, threatening,  
or retaliating against the  
plaintiffs because they  
brought this action.

Plug-In Probation

Albuquerque has a new pilot  
program that will allow pro-  
bationers to be imprisoned in  
their own homes. The "electro-  
nic handcuff" is a small  
transmitter, the size of a  

cigarette pack around the pro-  
bationer's ankle. It emits a  
signal that's picked up by a  
receiver attached to the  
person's phone which in turn  
relays to a computer. The  
computer printout will show  
probation officers if the per-  
son strays farther than 200  
feet from the receivers. If  
so and it is not on the proba-  
tioner's approved work sche-  
dule the officers check to  
see if terms of probation are  
violated. The Pres. of NIMCOS  
Inc., who developed the de-  
vice said it would unclog  
jails...because people who  
aren't a threat to society  
could serve time at home...  
and be charged $70 a month  
for the use of equipment.

Spoils Of War

Nearly 170 women were arres-  
ted in Sydney, Australia in  
an anti-rape demonstration.  
The march was dedicated to  
the memory of all women in  
all countries raped in all  
wars. Organizers defied a  
court order barring the demon-  
stration and the women were  
arrested as they walked along  
the route. A lesbian marcher  
who said she felt nervous  
about defying the court order  
to march on a day set aside  
for men who died in war,  
said, "However, it is also a  
day of male bonding and glori-  
fication of male war exploits.  
Few are prepared to look clo-  
sely at the other aspect being  
highlighted by this march...  
that on both sides, women  
are the spoils of war." The  
march was held on Anzac Day,  
like Veteran's Day in the US.

Invisible Workers

In Buffalo, New York, nine  
waitresses and restaurant em-  
ployees all between the ages  
of 41-58 claim that they've  
lost their jobs with Holiday  
Inn, Inc., because of age dis-  
crimination. Shirley V. Rock,  
age 56, had worked at the  
downtown Buffalo Holiday Inn  
for 17 yrs. After the Buffalo  
Motel Corp. took over the fran-  
chise, her hours were cut--she  
could only work banquets. "I  
felt as though I was always  
invisible," she stated. "They  
fired me for no good reason.  
Several of the women were told  
the motel wanted to "go youth-  
ful" and had plans for the  
waitresses to wear “Wonder  
Woman" and other fantasy cos-  
tumes.

Whose Interest?

Advertising bigger--but bet-  
ter? Classified advertisers  
of MS magazine received this  
letter:

"Dear MS advertiser: 1982  
marked the 10th anniv. of the  
magazine...making publishing  
history...MS has increased  
Liquor, Beer, and Wine ads by  
more than 40% and now carries  
more alcoholic beverage ads  
than any other "women's" maga-  
zine except Cosmopolitan.  
Drugs and remedies show a  
nearly 50% gain."

MS publisher and editor-in-  
chief can boast about helping  
alcohol and pharmaceutical in-  
dustries whose interests do  
not lie with our good health...  
especially the health of women  
and the elderly.

Witch Hunts

Gena Spero, 19, a lesbian  
who says she did not commit  
the murder last January of  
her lover, Gina Sindoni, has  
been judged mentally incompe-  
tent to stand trial. She has  
been committed to Danvers  
State Hospital for 6 months,  
at which time she will be re-  

evaluated. A number of les-  

bians in Northampton, Mass.,  
where the two women lived,  
have formed Medusa, a de-  
fense committee for Gena,  
stating she is "the perfect  
target for a witch-hunt...a  
lesbian of color with a her-  
story of drug and alcohol  
abuse and involuntary incar-  
cerations in mental institu-  
tions."

Man Bites Dog

A man in Columbus, Ohio be-  
came enraged when he caught  
his four-year-old Pomeranian  
dog engaged in an unspecified  
homosexual act with another  
dog. The man attacked "Elmo,"  
the Pomeranian, twisted his  
neck nearly from his body and  
bit him so severely the dog  
required 43 stitches.

Deaths In Iran

Iranian women about to be  
executed by firing squads are  
being raped or married against  
their will first. Islamic be-  
lief forbids the execution of  
virgins, hence the women must  
lose their virginity before  
they die.

Iranian authorities have  
hanged 10 women belonging to  
the Bahai faith for refusing  
to convert to Islam. The wo-  

men had been imprisoned since  
last Nov.
