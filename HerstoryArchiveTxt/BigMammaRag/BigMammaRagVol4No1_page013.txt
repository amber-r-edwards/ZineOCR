Feminist Economic Conference...

From Page 9

that we live with is provincial-
ism — that is whether you are
talking about a CU that is isolating
itself or a health worker that
loves to do pap smears and
doesn’t care about feminism. I
don’t think you can separate true
education from making money. If
we're talking about a real mass
movement, we're going to have
to be working from a huge power
base of money to connect with
every woman in the world. The
aspects of education and finan-
cial power base have got to be
connected. I recognize, how-
ever, that if there are women
who are not ready to go in that
direction, that there is nothing
we can do.”

Debra Law (Oakland FWHC):
“The Bylaws Committee said
that maybe within a year's time
you'd be ready to have feminist
enterprises other than CUs in
the organization. Is that really
the issue? Because in nine
months, there are not just going
to be these many CUs, but three
or four times these many. Why
are you going to be any more
ready to include feminist busi-
nesses then?”

Susan Osborne (Conn, FFCU):
“Because we want to organize
on a regional level first. We want
to have grassroots represen-
tation and strong participation
so we can collectivize our ener-
gies on a regional level, rather
than a national level. Some CUs
are not even paying dividends
yet, and most are not paying
staff. We want to put what
limited resources we have into
our own growth and helping
sister CUs to organize.”

Businesses Other Than CUs
Ame (Columbus Women’s Ac-
tion Collective): “I have heard no
one from anything other than a
CU speak about whether they
want to be part of FEN or not.”
Co Harper (FFCU of
Detroit): “There are women in
workshops, in fact, many leading
the workshops from enterprises
other than CUs. I think the fact
that women are here from other
feminist enterprises shows that
they want to be members.

“As for whether we want a
centralized structure or input
from every level, I think the two
are not exclusive. Every CU in
the room, if the people feel they
have the time, could participate
in the central organizational
level. Those who didn't have the
time certainly wouldn't be re-
quired to. But if they have the
time, they certainly should.”
Unknown voice: “But the
Detroit by-laws didn’t reach that
question.”

Connye: “I’m sorry if they
weren't clear.”
Unknown voice: “They were
very clear!”
Donna Good (Colorado FFCU):
“The criteria for the Board of
Directors were really frighten-
ing to me — the selectivity of it.
Coming from a lower class back-
ground, and reading the by-
laws, I realized that working
class women or mothers
couldn't possibly have been
included, because we can't
afford to work for feminist
institutions for three years and
still support the children and
work for a living.

Laura Brown (Oakland FWHC):
“Are we going to talk about this
all day? I really feel that people
know where they are. We could
spend three weeks fighting over
points that everyone doesn't
like. Why keep gnawing at each
other? There is a group that
knows what it wants. I would
suggest that they meet with
women from all groups and
decide what to do. We have a
room full of people who know
where we're going and why
trash each other? I'm sick of
having to answer a bunch of
arguments that have been
answered before. Why don’t we
just move on? We know where
we are!”

Connye: “Is that the consensus
of the group?”

Group: (Confused talk — mostly
NO!)

“I Want to Listen”

Mary Forst (California FFCU):
“This is the first time we all have
had a chance to be together as a
group. Laura, you may know, but
we've been meeting in work-
shops all day and haven't had a
chance to discuss what happened in the By-laws Com-
mittee. I don’t know what the
points are. And I don’t hear any
trashing. What I hear is people
trying to explain different points
of view. To me it is very vital; I
don't want to miss it. To say at
this point that there are two
groups with no hope of re-
solving these things, is unfair to
me. I would like to spend this
time with everyone all together
hearing what we have to say, so
we do know. Laura, you may
know. I don’t know.”

The above discussion lasted
about 30 minutes, after which
about 20 women from Detroit,
Washington, and the FWHCs,
led by Laura Brown, walked out
of the plenary meeting, and left
the area for the rest of the
evening.

FEA Organizes

The two-thirds of the group
left in the room reached a con-
sensus that it had to get its own
program together as a group,
and that input from the group
that had left was impossible,
given the walkouts in both the
By-laws Committee, earlier that
day, and from the plenary
meeting.

These 50 women, using the
Connecticut by-laws as a model
for the group's structure, met
Friday night and all day Satur-
day to develop an organization
that would meet both its short-
range and long-range goals.
From that group came the
Feminist Economic Alliance
(FEA), which is described in its
own words on P. 8 of this issue.

FEN Ratification Meeting

On Saturday morning, 50
women met in one room (FEA),
while 25 women (FEN) met
across the hall. Barbara Hoke
(Oakland FWHC) and Connie
Harper (FFCU of Detroit) chaired
the FEN meeting, which was
called to ratify the Detroit by-
laws for FEN.

A proxy vote on the ratification
of the Detroit by-laws was
brought into the FEN meeting by
a representative of the seven
CUs which were meeting across
the hall to form FEA. The repres-
entative claimed that these
seven CUs had paid dues, which
qualified them to vote on the
ratification of the FEN by-laws.
All seven of the dues-paying
CUs, plus two credit unions
which are just organizing
(Florida and Colorado) voted
against ratification of the Detroit
by-laws. There was nervous
laughter in the room as the votes
were read, but no one in the FEN
group took the vote seriously.

To set the tone of the vision of
FEN, Connye Harper read a letter
which had been sent earlier that
week by FFCU of Detroit to the
other CUs, along with a copy of
the Detroit by-laws. This parti-
cular letter was a point of con-
troversy itself at the conven-
tion. Women from the other CUs
said they had received this letter
with the Detroit by-laws only
days before the convention, and
that it was the first time they
knew Detroit was also writing
by-laws. In addition, the letter
requested that the CUs ratify the
Detroit by-laws by mail, in order
to save meeting time at the con-
vention.

Not a Political Sorority

The letter which was read
explained that “FEN is not a do-
nothing political sorority, un-
like most feminist organiza-
tions.” Rather FEN is a business
“designed to increase the
chances of success by emulating
the positive structural aspects of
other successful feminist enter-
prises. Under these by-laws, the
Board of Directors of FEN, as in
any viable enterprise, has the ul-
timate power and authority to
determine FEN's future.” The
letter continued, “It is impor-
tant for us to rely on the women
(with whom we agree politically)
who have the most experience
and energy to assume the extra
time and commitment that run-
ning FEN will require, especially
in the beginning. Also, we need
their expertise. We believe that
only women who have demon-
strated their commitment to re-
placing patriarchy by founding
and operating viable feminist
institutions and enterprises
should make the crucial busi-
ness decisions that will deter-
mine FEN’s future.”

The letter described in broad
terms how FEN's Board will
implement its vision. “FEN will
make employment contracts with
its staff and purchasing con-
tracts with suppliers. FEN will
borrow money from feminist
CUs and loan money to all
feminist enterprises. FEN will
have subsidiaries — the FEN
Institute and FEN Corporation.
The FEN Institute will have
primary responsibility to imple-
ment our education and training
projects and sponsor FEN’s Little
Women (a kind of feminist Girl
Scouts) program. FEN Corpora-
tion will be a profit-making cor-
poration, wholly owned by FEN
Association. It will implement all
of FEN’s economic and finan-
cially oriented purposes and
goals.

Objections to FEN Raised

Some women from feminist
enterprises other than CUs
found themselves in a difficult
position at this meeting. Re-
presentatives from Diana Press,
New Moon Communications, and
FWHCs favored the Detroit by-
laws for FEN. However, repres-
entatives from the Columbus
Women’s Action Collective and
from Quest opposed both the
Detroit and the Connecticut by-
laws, but for different reasons.
They disagreed with the non-
representative structure of the
Detroit by-laws, yet were not
allowed voting membership in
FEA. (They later persuaded FEA
to their point of view, however,
and joined FEA as voting
members.)
On Saturday, these three
women participated in the FEN
Ratification meeting to try to
resolve their conflicts with FEN.
Tempers ran pretty hot in the
discussion, and the women
finally were discouraged from
expressing their objections,
since discussion in the ratifi-
cation meeting was allowed as
to clarification of the language of
the by-laws only. Caroline
Sparks explained later, “We
stayed in the FEN ratification
meeting to fight out our differ-
ences. When the first purpose of
FEN was proposed — that FEN
“accept financial leadership for
the feminist movement — we
objected to the group being able
to do that. We were voted down,
so we left.”

Credit Unions Object

Three women from the Lan-
sing Branch Office of FFCU of
Detroit did not participate in the
FEN ratification meeting. They
explained, “We don't know what
we're going to do. We came late.

Conference Perspective...

From Page 9

to evaluate the implementing of
FEN goals — as an educational
tool to help evolve feminist
policies — to make suggestions
and add expertise to FEN
member organizations. They ex-
plain that the value auditor will
help, not control, a member
organization. Is this really just
“peer pressure”? How will a
value auditor evaluate a poten-
tial member who is likely to be an
investor in FEN? How will she
evaluate a potential borrower?

The FWHC and FEN represent,
in effect, a potential political
party within the women’s move-
ment. Their bases are institu-
tions which reach a broad base
of women, often women in
crisis, with a valuable service.
Consequently, women develop a
great deal of loyalty to the
institution.

Both organizations are run by
women who make that job their
lives, and gain a great deal of
respect in the community for
doing so. Some Detroit women
told me: “How can we criticize
what they're doing when they
work so hard? And they're the
only ones willing to make that
kind of total commitment.” The
community is depending on
these women not only for the
service they provide, but also for
the information they control. The
Detroit women said: “They're
the only ones who really know
how to run the credit union. The
rest of us are involved in our own
projects and personal lives.”

The politics of FEN and
FWHC have a quality of des-
peration — an urgency to get the
job done now. They see their
politics (what their values are
and how they implement them)
as essential feminism — without
influence from the right or
from the left. But is it really? Are
they really creating something
different than other political
groups, or does it merely have a
different name?

In the future, feminists are
going to have to ask themselves
these questions because they
are going to have to deal with
these women.

They are totally committed
and they are not going away.
Right now, the organizational

There’s only one of our mem-
bers in the ratification meeting.
She agrees with FEN’s struc-
ture, but we do not. But Lansing
doesn't have its own charter, so
what can we do?” In addition,
representatives from the cur-
rently organizing Chicago FFCU
(which was planning to open as
a branch office of FFCU of
Detroit) left the convention early,
in disgust at all the politics going
on.

At the FEN ratification
meeting itself, the Washington
Area FFCU was the only
independent CU whose mem-
bers were supporting FEN. The
women from Washington ex-
plained: “We want to work with
you, but we object to your by-
laws.” After hours of discus-
sion, and some minor compro-
mises, the Washington Area
FFCU eventually ratified the FEN
by-laws, but the Washington CU
contingent was partially split as
a result. Two of the Washington
women left the convention that
day; others said they wanted to
work with Detroit because
Valerie and Joanne were going
to help them go on data proces-
sing. Andrea Hull from
Washington said, “I'm support-
ing Detroit because I heard those
other women in the meeting last
night saying we're too weak,
that we can't do it. I'm sick of that
kind of talk. I want to talk about
what women can do!”

FEN Sowing Circle

After opposition to the pro-
posed by-laws waned, the re-
maining 15 women in the FEN
ratification meeting voted to
ratify the Detroit by-laws for FEN
and elected its Board through a
self-selection process. The
Board members (now called the
FEN Circle) are: Debra Law
(FWHC), Laura Brown (FWHC),
Joanne Parrent (FFCU of Detroit),
Lolly Hirsh (New Moon Com-
munications), Henri Norris
(Washington Area FFCU),
Adrienne Ingrum (WAFFCU),
and Florence Bayard (WAFFCU).

A convention was planned for
spring in Missouri, tasks were
divided up, and priorities were
set. The first priority of FEN is to
make personal contact with
feminist enterprises. On Sun-
day morning, FEN discussed in-
come-generating projects, while
FEA women packed to go home
(See p. 8 for FEN’s own state-
ment.)

The convention ended on
Sunday, with no coming
together again of all of the parti-
cipants. The convention agenda
had scheduled: “9:00 a.m.
Sunday-Breakfast/Adjourn-
ment/Hugs & Kisses.” Need-
less to say, few arrived for break-
fast, and even fewer for hugs &
kisses.

The success of FEN depends largely
on the decisions of the Detroit
and Washington FCU Boards of
Directors as to whether they will
become members of FEN or not,
on the resources of FCUs and the
FWHCs to support their women
in working for FEN, and on
whether newly forming feminist
credit unions and other feminist
businesses choose to become
members of FEN or FEA, or re-
main unaligned in this struggle
to develop a financial base for
the feminist movement.

** The convention, in effect,
was not open to all feminist busi-
nesses, because publicity for the
convention was circulated only
among feminist CUs. There were
only five feminist businesses re-
presented. Apparently there was
no outreach to other feminist
businesses before the
convention.

** There was no other feminist
press represented at the con-
ference. I was attending as a re-
presentative from the Colorado
FFCU, and also reporting for
