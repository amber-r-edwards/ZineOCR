Legislation To Close Women’s Prison

Sherilyn Brandenstein

Beginning in 1974 with
passage of Senate Bill 55,
Colorado adopted a new concept
of corrections for criminal
offenders. Essentially, Senate
Bill 55 authorized and provided
funding for pilot projects to
demonstrate the validity of
“community corrections.” In-
stead of transferring offenders
to isolated prisons far from ur-
ban areas, they would be placed
in or near their own communities.*
More importantly, Senate Bill 55
set a policy for placing all but the
most consistently violent con-
victs in small open housing units
staffed by persons specifically
trained in counseling and com-
munity liaison skills. The pre-
sent methods of rehabilitation
(drudgery work; watching
television; training for low-skill
jobs) will be replaced with oppor-
tunities for valid job training or
higher education. Obviously, the
emphasis will change from
isolating offenders from the
community to establishing them
as viable members of the com-
munity.

Why Senate Bill 55? Because
if anything has become standard
in the history of the penal
system, it is the high record of
recidivism (return) for its in-
mates. When persons have no
other skills except illegal ones it
is hardly surprising that they use
them again in order to survive.
Given the choice between work-
ing in a laundry at a minimum
wage and streetwalking at $100
a night, a single mother of four
cannot be blamed for returning
to prostitution, although it will
probably send her back to prison.
Senate Bill 55 was created to
begin to break that kind of cycle.

Largely Unaffected
However, despite the im-

provements this bill could poten-
tially instigate in the state cor-

rections system, its short-term
effects for female offenders
would be minimal. There are
about 50 to 60 inmates in
Colorado Women’s Correctional
Institution (CWCI) compared to
1,900 prisoners in the state
men’s institutions. Because the
bill authorizes only a few model
projects to begin with, the
number of women allowed to

participate would necessarily be
extremely small.

Enter House Bill 1445. In
March, Rep. Arie Taylor of Dis-
trict 7A (Park Hill, Denver) in-
troduced this bill to authorize the
closing of Colorado Women’s
Correctional Institution as of
July 1975. It calls for the
holding, for no more than two
weeks, of convicted women
offenders in local (usually coun-
ty) facilities for professional
diagnostic examination. Depen-
ding on the individual diagnostic
results, the Colorado Depart-
ment of Institutions staff would
then arrange for the most ap-
propriate community placement
of adult female offenders in the

best possible community correc-

tions program. Women would
be placed as close as possible to

their home communities, close
to community treatment
programs, or both, depending on
their needs. Some examples of
locations where women might
“do their time” are community
treatment centers, mental
health centers, college cam-

puses, or any public or private
agency that obtains approval
from

the Department of In-

stitutions to provide quality ser-
vices designed for women in-
mates.

Community Corrections

There are two other important
aspects to the bill. It requires
that community correctional
staff be hired in adherence to the
federal and state equal oppor-
tunity laws. Also, it authorizes
termination of contracts
between the State of Colorado
and the Federal Bureau of
Prisons or other states. Thus,
women from outside Colorado
would no longer serve time in
CWCI as they do now. If the out-
of-state women were allowed to
stay, the prison administration
would probably try to justify
leaving CWCI open for that
reason alone.

Expected to support H.B. 1445
in the House of Representatives
are Reps. Smith, Webb, Kopel
and Gaon. In the Senate, it
should draw support from
Senators Groff and Sandoval.
The bill can be defended on
grounds that it would provide a
more realistically helpful
rehabilitation for women, who
are consistently convicted of
“light” crimes. They could ob-
tain training and counseling and
life experiences that would more
adequately prepare them for
supporting themselves upon
release. It would allow women to
be close to their families and see
them often. Also, it would force
communities to start dealing
with their “people problems”
locally, instead of sending them
away.

Men Protest Closing

Certain to fight H.B. 1445 are
Sen. McCormick and Rep.
Robert Shoemaker, both from
Fremont County where CWCI is
located. They are sure to protest

the loss of jobs caused by the
closing of the women’s prison.
They are convinced that CWCI,
with its new building, secretarial
courses and rural staff, is ser-
ving the people of Colorado in an
exemplary manner. Because
these men are powerful and
legislatively astute, they can
mount an ardent campaign
against the bill.

Colorado citizens should
watch H.B. 1445 carefully in the
coming months. If passed, it
could guarantee women
offenders the more in-
dividualized treatment en-
couraged in Senate Bill 55.

voice your opinions or questions
about the bill.

* 73% of Colorado's prisoners come
from the Front Range cities, but
Colorado's primary correctional in-
stitutions are located in Canon City
and Buena Vista in an unpopulous
region of the state.

Use of Shock Treatment
Protested by Women.

SAN FRANCISCO (LNS) — As
part of a continuing drive against
the use of electro-convulsive
therapy (ECT), Women Against
Psychiatric Assault (WAPA) is
protesting the portrayal in a TV
soap opera of shock treatment as
an effective and painless cure
for problems.

In recent episodes of the
American Broadcasting Com-
pany’s (ABC) popular continuing
drama “All My Children,” the
main character, Erica, is un-
dergoing shock treatment. Ten
to fifty million viewers, the
overwhelming majority of whom
are women, watch the program
daily.

The events that led to the
character's institutionalization
“epitomize stereotyping of
women’s madness. ABC
presents Erica as a woman hav-
ing delusions instead of a
woman with real and warranted
pain.”

Erica is portrayed as
powerless and unable to make
any decisions regarding her own
life. Labelled incompetent, the
power to consent to her treat-
ment is turned over to her hus-
band.

“We think it is potentially
damaging to all women
watching to see ECT used as a
solution to real problems as well
as it is destructive for them to
witness a woman overwhelmed
and who needs her husband to
take control of her life,” explains
WAPA.

The episodes show a woman
desperate to fulfill herself
through marriage and childbirth.
Her marriage came about
because of her pregnancy. The
subject of ECT comes up when,
after a miscarriage, she has
doubts about her role when she
is no longer able to produce a
child to cement the relationship.

“Soap operas have always
centered around the idealization
of marriage and the family,
shown amidst an endless flow of
personal crises. When the crises
cannot be resolved, it is usually
the female character who can-

not cope, who takes the blame,

and goes ‘crazy.’

WAPA has written letters to
ABC protesting the program,
complaining that the millions of
women who watch it are being
led to believe that ECT is
harmless and can solve
problems.

The San Francisco Mental
Health Advisory Board ruled dur-
ing recent hearings that shock
treatments are experimental, as
there is no empirical data prov-
ing its effectiveness. In contrast,
says WAPA, the data that is

available shows ECT to be
dangerous, causing brain
damage, retrograde amnesia,
permanent and irreversible
memory loss, and has even
caused death.

“Whether or not a person dies
from them, a part of the person
dies afterward when they no
longer remember parts of their
personal history but are left in-
stead with a vague sense of pain,
the cause of which is now un-
known,” writes WAPA. “Others
must relearn the names of their
children, or how to make their
way around the town they lived
in for years; some can no longer
do the job they used to do.”

In addition, shock treatments
are administered mostly to
women. While 72% of people
treated with shock are women,
according to a 1972 study done
by a group of Berkeley women,
99% of doctors administering
shock treatment are men.

“Shock is used in mental in-
stitutions and in prisons as a
mechanism of control and
punishment and exemplifies the
use of psychiatric technology as
a tool of repression. Often the
dread and fear of shock
treatments is enough to make
someone conform,” writes
WAPA.

In order to rectify some of the
damage already done by the
television program, WAPA is
demanding a script change in
which Erica will refuse elec-
troshock treatment. “Erica must
be presented as a woman who is
aware of the possible dangers
and chooses to discontinue
treatment. Because she was
voluntarily committed by her
husband, it will be necessary to
show him also making changes
in his decision.”

WAPA admits that the script
change they are demanding is
rarely the situation in real life,
however. According to WAPA,
what usually happens is that
“women are imprisoned against
their will and often left to rot in
back wards of mental hospitals
throughout the country.”

WAPA asks people to write to
the ABC daytime program direc-
tor and the author of “All My
Children” to demand changes in
the program. Author: Agnes Nix-
