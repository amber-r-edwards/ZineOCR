Women's Community Houses Sought

Bill to Close Prison
In Senate

An important bill in the area of
prison reform has recently passed
the House and is under
consideration by the Health,
Education and Welfare Committee
of the State Senate. H.B. 1445
provides for moving women
prisoners from Canyon

City to community-based
programs where maximum
security is not deemed

necessary.
Director of

Rudy Sanfilippo,
Corrections, estimates that at least
90% of the women in prison could
be immediately released to residen-

tial, work, and educational
programs. Special psychiatric
facilities would serve the
remaining 10% who need

secure supervision.

About 74 women are presently
incarcerated, primarily for
property-related, non-violent
offenses such as forgery and
embezzlement. Further, most
criminal homicide offenses are
situational and will never be
repeated. Yet women remain
locked in Canyon City, an
isolated rural community which
— like the prison — has no
meaningful programs designed
to teach women skills that will
enable them to maintain

themselves in the community.
Women prisoners average 3.5
children per person, and must
work to support themselves and
their family after release. If H.B.
1445 passes, prisoners would
be able to maintain family con-
tact and move toward economic
independence if based in their
own communities for rehabilita-
tion purposes.

Denver Has Services
Services already exist in
Denver and metropolitan areas,

including drug and alcohol
programs, volunteer support,
counseling, and university

programs. In addition, residen-
tial facilities include Walden
Community Treatment Center in
Denver, Adult Forensic Service
in Colorado Springs, and Weld
Mental Health Center in
Greeley. Work release centers
include Camp George West,
Delta Honor Unit, and others.
Use of these and other com-
munity services in lieu of im-
prisonment works! Recent
statistics reveal a 60-80% return
rate for those released from
Colorado prisons, while Adult
Forensics reports only a 15%
rate, and South West Mental

Health reports a 21% rate.
Women Ignored
A special bill mandating com-
munity corrections for women is
required in this state because
women prisoners have been

ignored by corrections and
public alike. For example,
despite a much-publicized

change in policy last January
admitting women to work
release programs, only two
women are participating.
Further, there is no half-way
house for women offenders.
Equal protection of the law must
be mandated for women via H.B.
1445! Please help us pass this
bill before the legislature ad-
journs. Call, write, or visit your
state senator!
What You Can Do

1. Immediately contact your
state senator and urge his or her
support of H.B. 1445 mandating
community corrections for
women.

2. Contact these Senators
from the Health, Education and
Welfare Committee, and urge
their support: Sen. Ted
Strickland, Westminster; Sen.
Joseph Schieffelin, Lakewood;
Sen. Vincent Massari, Pueblo;
Sen. William Hughes, Colorado
Springs; Sen. Regis Groff,
Denver; Sen. Dennis Gallagher,
Denver; Sen. Harold McCormick,
Canyon City.

3. Call the state capital (892-
3055 or 892-9911) to find out
when committee hearings will
be held. Plan to attend and speak
in favor of the bill.

Remember: a personal visit to
your senator has greater impact
than a call, but, by all means,
write, call, or visit as soon as
possible! For questions, contact
Karen Ringsby, 758-0957. Many
thanks from PRO-WOMEN, Un-
itarian Universalist Service

Women’s Bookstore
To Open This Fall

Carol Lease

A new women’s bookstore is
being planned and nurtured by
three feminists who will open its
doors to women in early
September. It will be the first
women’s bookstore in Denver
since the Woman's Voice closed
last August.

The bookstore will be not only
a place for women to buy the
latest in feminist books and
periodicals but will also serve as
a place for women to talk to each
other in a comfortable at-
mosphere and see women’s art
displayed. Among services the
store hopes to offer the women’s
community are a telephone
information line for women’s
services, a bulletin board for
announcements, meeting space
for women, and a mini-coffee
house.

The three women who are
working in the bookstore operate
as a collective in terms of
responsibility and decision mak-
ing. They are open to more
women who would like to get
involved in the store and want to
know what women would like to
see stocked in the bookstore,
such as books, magazines, but-
tons, posters, graphics, records.
The collective presently consists
of Jane Dundee, Peggy Hickox,
and Vicki Piotter.

Jane Dundee has been in-
volved in the gay rights and
women’s movement in Denver
and helped organize the Jill
Johnston/Ann Schaef
“happening” and has been
working in a women’s center for
the city. She feels there is no
place for women to have fun and
that the bookstore will be the
beginning of a space for women
to get together. A feminist
restaurant is just one thing
Dundee feels can come from
women’s energy getting
together.

“A bookstore will be an easier
way for a woman just getting
into feminism to get involved.
Walking through the door of a
women’s center takes a certain
degree of involvement, whereas
a bookstore is safe. A woman
can go in and pick up a book, put

it down and leave with no
commitment,” she says.

Peggy Hickox and Vicki Piotter
are from Seattle where they
were involved in the Lesbian
Feminist Radio Collective for
over 2 years. “We had a strong
collective in Seattle, so instead
of hanging on we wanted to get
out and make other things
happen,” Hickox says. They
came to Denver to keep from
getting fixed ideas and help get
other projects going in other
women’s communities.

The women intend to es-
tablish the bookstore as a com-
munity resource. They plan

SAIE Speaker

Feminists Downed
Rapist Supported

Carol Lease

In mid-May a rapist was
invited to address the third
meeting of the Sexual Assault
Information Exchange (SAIE), a
group formed to facilitate com-
munication among groups and
agencies concerned with rape in
the Denver area, and of which
this paper is a member.

At a previous meeting of SAIE,
some women wanted to know
the profile of a rapist (there is
none — he looks like every man
you meet) and Dr. Harry Chap-
man who works with an offender
treatment program was to be
invited to speak. According to
Kim Garrett, a staff person at the
Capitol Hill Storefront, Chapman
couldn't make it and she invited
a rapist to speak to the group
instead.

At the meeting the fact that a
rapist was asked to address the
group and was present to do so
was protested by women from
Big Mama Rag. A full statement
was read and given to all present
explaining why the women were
outraged at the invitation. The
two illustrious Denver dailies
chose to ignore the statement
and to focus their stories on the
“poor rapist who wasn't given
the opportunity to speak” about
his crimes against women. In
the interest of letting readers
know the full position of this
paper the statement has been
reprinted in full.
See page 4 for text of state-
ment.

Structure as Political

It is important to understand
that what happened didn't
happen because there wasn’t an
adequate structure to facilitate
communication among the
groups that compose SAIE.
What happened shows the lack of
consciousness that exists con-
cerning rape. Inviting a rapist to
address a group that is trying to
eradicate rape is indicative of the
liberal attitude towards rape and
the distortion it creates. This
attitude tends to see rape as
isolated acts of “sick” or malad-
justed people. It doesn’t see rape

as a part of the way a society views
women and keeps them in their
place through threats, intimida-
tion, and fear. If there were an
adequate structure in the group,
there would still be disagree-
ment because most groups see
rape as an isolated, personal
incident.

The SAIE hasn't formed any
type of governing board as of this
writing, despite the insistence of
doing so from the women who
started it. This seems to be
because member groups either
could not help to make a working
structure due to a sense of
individual powerlessness or
would not do so because of
personal, i.e., group-identified,
motives.

Those groups who can’t act
out of individual powerlessness
haven't seen the importance of
having a strong structure. They
can easily fit into something
already existing but can’t help
create one or take independent
action unless their particular
agency, the media, or the “guide
book on how to deal with rape”
tells them how to do so.

“Of Course I'm
Not Jealous”

There is a better description
for the reason that the latter
group would not help make a
good, working structure. It is
called the “wolf in sheep's
clothing” tactic. These groups
graze around in the SAIE doing
little to make it viable because
they didn't initiate the idea first.
Then when the membership
drops (and it was obvious that
was beginning to happen at the
last meeting of the exchange),
they lead the remaining groups
into their own organizations.

As you are reading this the
first organizational meeting of
the exchange will have taken
place. Hopefully, all the original
groups will have taken part in it
to make it work, and not given up
because some groups involved
do not share their opinions.
Unfortunately, this cooperation
has not been the history of

Brother Bell Down

Defense Benefit
June 8 — Oxford

The fifty Mountain Bell
women who have filed sex
discrimination charges with the
Equal Opportunity Commission
are being called back to work by
the company. According to Evon
Stith, one of the laid-off in-
stallers, they are not being called
back in order of seniority. Also,
they are expecting to be laid off
again in October and November.

At this point they are waiting
for permission from the EOC to
sue AT&T. When they get the
approval they will have 90 days
to bring suit against the largest
employer of women workers in
the country. At least two thou-
sand dollars will be needed at
the time they file for briefs,
depositions, and filings.

Attorneys of the Women’s
Law Co-op, who are members of
the Lawyers Guild, have donated
their services. Sixteen law
students and several legal aides
are working on the research for
the case. They received a $100
donation from the local NOW
chapter in February and will
have a booth to sell shirts and
buttons at the NOW State Con-
ference at Regis College June 7-
8. Their booth at the Capitol Hill
People’s Fair brought in $200.

Their actions have received
the endorsement of several
organizations including Better
Jobs for Women and Colorado
Workers Unity. Shirley Chisholm
is also a supporter and con-
tributor to their cause.

But there is still a long way to
go before the two thousand
dollar goal is reached. A benefit
for the defense fund will be held
June 8th at the Oxford Hotel.

Have fun and help out your
sisters at the same time by
attending. Tax-deductible
donations should be made
