and discussion of them. Those of
us sleeping with men might
learn something if we could stop
being defensive! Though in
danger of being exploitative,
isn’t there even any curiosity in
exploring what it means to have
a total lesbian experience???
Radical feminists cannot dis-
miss this as a revolutionary
choice.

I, too, was disappointed that
my expectations of what was
going to happen that night were
not realized, but what transpired
and the issues raised make that
seem inconsequential. Or
maybe should serve to point out,
once again, that feminism is not
a performance. Jill's struggle to
define her own space and identi-
ty, her refusal to entertain us,
her refusal to go through her
“tricks” on demand, is a per-
sonal statement worthy of con-
sideration and respect.

Well, this is off the top of my
head and I’m rambling. I was
frustrated that my ride wanted to
leave before working through to
a resolution — if that was
possible — and even more
frustrated that I wasn’t able to
discuss what happened and my
feelings about it with someone
who had been there. The people
I was with had different reac-
tions than mine and weren't too
interested in discussing it. So,
I'm looking forward to the May
issue to see what Big Mama
might do with this confrontation.

Keep up the good work.

Sagaris Response
Dear Big Mama Rag,
Thank you for your article on

Sagaris. We'd like to clarify
some points you made, and
explain others.

You labeled our criteria for
admitting students as “loose.”
The criteria are actually very
clear; we want women who are
feminists. By this we mean
women who are aware of their
oppression as females and are in
struggle against it. We en-
courage every woman who is
interested in Sagaris to apply
regardless of her financial situa-
tion. She should apply for finan-
cial aid if necessary.

You also misunderstood what
the contingency fund in the
budget is for. It is not for special
lectures, it is essentially for costs
that were not accounted for in
the budget. We were advised to
add a 10% contingency fund. We
already realized that we
neglected to include insurance
and transportation in the budget
which the contingency fund will
cover. There are undoubtedly
other items we've omitted and
aren't yet aware of.

There is a special lectures
allotment of $6,000. If we don’t
get enough money for financial
aid, a substantial amount of this
fund will be redirected towards
scholarships.

Day care is provided for no
extra cost to mothers, but we felt
it would not be fair for women
without children to have to pay
room and board for other
children. Children over eight
years old (not six) have to pay
the full $300 room and board
fee. Children who don’t take up a
bed don't have to pay the room
fee of $140.

Some of us in the collective
were concerned that having the
option of camping open to
students had classist im-
plications. Women with money
would be able to live in dorms,
while women with less money
would have to live in tents. We are
still discussing this issue, but
the fact is that the $90 saved by
camping enables more women
to come to Sagaris.

Regarding food costs, it is not
possible that Lyndon State
would change its position on
that. People living off campus
have the option of using the
cafeteria services or not. Those
who are tenting (as well as those
living in the dorms) must use
the cafeteria.

At the time we set faculty
salaries (which was two years
ago), we based it on what faculty
in other private institutions
earned, and then lowered it from
that. We are not emulating
capitalist private institutions,
but we needed some idea of
what a fair salary might be. At
that point, we were counting on
receiving foundation grants. At
this time, we realize that the
salaries are too high in relation
to what students are earning.
We can do no more than request
the faculty to reduce their
salaries, which most have
agreed to do. We have made an
agreement, and the faculty have
made plans according to the
salary they were promised. It
would be simplistic to label this
capitalism. It is not our aim, nor
is it the faculty's, to make a profit.
All of us deserve to make a living
wage. The real force behind this
situation is that not only should
this kind of program be state
funded, but that women with
privilege should share that
privilege with others. Some of
the burden of responsibility lies
with those of us who do have
money. Sagaris is operating
within an unequal system at
best, and is trying to rectify some
inequalities. The majority of the
students are full paying. A
percentage of their tuition is
directed towards scholarships
for other women.

We are hurt and angry when
people assume that we are not
trying to do everything possible
to lower costs. The collective has
been working for two years
without pay. We have, in fact,
often subsidized Sagaris out of
our own pockets. We have tried
our best to make Sagaris a
positive force in the women’s
movement. Lowering costs is
our highest priority. Since the
beginning, we have spent most
of our time trying to raise money.
Right now, there is a good chance
that Sagaris will receive
“emergency funding” from some
foundation to subsidize the
summer sessions, all of which
will go toward financial aid. If this
funding comes through, we will
have sufficient financial aid for
many women. If it doesn’t come
through, we will continue to try
new ways to get money, up until
the day Sagaris opens.

We want criticism and
suggestions about Sagaris from
other feminists. We've changed
some aspects of the program
based on previous input and will
continue to do so. We share
many of the criticisms we've
received and are struggling to
deal with these issues in the
best way possible.

Joanne Little

Defense Fund
Dear Friends,

The Joanne Little Defense
Fund, Inc. would like to
acknowledge your sincere ef-
forts to help in the struggle to
seek justice for Joanne Little.
Your humanitarian efforts —
including organizing, educating,
spiritual uplifting, as well as
financial contributions have been
proven very successful by the
fact that together we have been
able to reach so many people.

We have received responses
from all over the United States,
as well as Sweden, Canada and
England. Several Joanne Little
Defense Committees have been
established in cities throughout
the country.

From April 14, 1975, through
May 1, 1975, pre-trial motions
were argued before the Superior
Court in Beaufort County
(Washington, North Carolina).
The Judge denied most of the
motions including a motion to
quash the indictment; however,
on May 1, 1975, a motion to
change venue was granted. The
trial will be held in Wake County,
Raleigh, North Carolina which is
also the capital of North
Carolina. The trial date has not
yet been set.

Joanne is doing well con-
sidering the daily pressures to
which she is subjected. She has
been making a few public
appearances at rallies given in
her support, the most recent one
being in Washington, D.C.
Joanne extends her deepest
gratitude to you for the way you
have supported her.

Again, we thank each of you for
your cooperative efforts. We

Inez Garcia

Demonstrators
Dear sisters and friends,
Thirty-eight people in San
Francisco were arrested on
February 7, 1975 for
demonstrating in support of Inez
Garcia and other political
prisoners. Inez still remains a
political prisoner at the Califor-
nia Institute for Women. Neither
her case has disappeared nor
the ideals for which she and
many women have struggled —

that is, a defense for Inez that
supports her and all women in
their attempts to become self-
determining.

Inez will not be forgotten. Her
strength and righteous con-
fidence have inspired thousands
of women throughout the coun-
try.

Those arrested in San Fran-
cisco were charged with
trespassing, a misdemeanor
carrying a maximum penalty of
six months in jail. Christa
Donaldson, one of the thirty-
eight defendants, was brutalized
by the police in two separate
incidents and then subject to a
frame-up of two charges —
resisting arrest and assaulting
an officer. The charges originally
were made as felonies and later
reduced to misdemeanors,
carrying a maximum penalty of
two years. During one of our
visits to the “Hall of Justice,”
another defendant, Stacey
Foiles, was assaulted by an
officer and then falsely arrested
by him for battery.

Both women are victims of
the terrible injustices daily im-
posed on many people, especial-
ly Third World, gays, women,
and other oppressed groups.
Their arrests also are part of a
deliberate effort by the police to
make the consequences of this
demonstration more serious.

In fighting all of these charges,
we intend to make this case help
win justice for Inez; however, to
continue our struggle in the
courts, we need contributions to
our defense fund. Please
demonstrate your solidarity and
send money to:

Rape Action
Dear Big Mama Rag,
As a contributor and general
supporter of the paper, I wish to
register my disappointment with
the recent action taken at the
meeting of the Sexual Assault
Information Exchange. I am
referring to the publicized state-
ment released, that stated that
BMR and others saw the invita-
tion of a rapist to speak at the
meeting as an insult to women.
The media gave the public
statement much attention.

My understanding of why this
action was taken is that it was
intended to solidify the Informa-
tion Exchange and move the
participants to take united action
in the support of women, par-
ticularly rape victims. Apparent-
ly, some productive discussion
was generated by the incident,
after the press had left the
meeting. And the BMR staff
seems satisfied that the action
was a positive one.

I feel, from a perspective
outside of the Exchange, that the
incident was a destructive one. It
hardly seems positive that a
person who was invited by some
part of a group to speak to that
group, should then have been
asked not to speak by another
part of the group, upon arriving
at the meeting. The whole affair
has caused a number of Denver
people to question the credibility
of the Exchange, as well as of
BMR.

Up to this point, a number of
offenders in Colorado have felt
that BMR was sensitive to and
supportive of their efforts to seek
rehabilitation in the community
and to communicate with all of
the community. Whether or not
this result was intended (I'm
sure it wasn't anticipated), BMR,
in taking this public action, has
destroyed the links it has built
with many offenders, and it
serves as another example to
them of rejection from the com-
munity.

I guess all of this is to say that
I understand why it was done.
And perhaps it created some
internal cohesion and action in
the Exchange. But I don’t think it
was worth it, and BMR may need
to think beyond the immediate
situation before taking such
actions in the future.

Sincerely,
Sherilyn Brandenstein

A Call to Action
BMR:
The state of imprisonment
within/without PaaS women
becomes clearer with each
issue that confronts us. Joanne
Little, Jane Alpert. The
differences are myriad, but the
common grounds are glaring
and unmistakable. Women, for
varying reasons, have become
enemies of the state instead of
wards and chattels. The system
succeeds in dividing women
themselves about the rightness
and wrongness of each woman,
each case distracting us with the
differences. It does no good to
argue the correctness of
Joanne’s actions and seem
united, then to polarize over
Jane. The points not to be
missed are: 1. Women by their
very attempts to assert
themselves, to be free according
to some personal definition or by
some politically astute definition
still run into the true jailer. 2.
The Women's Movement must
do more than analyze the nature
of imprisonment. In this year of
the woman, the anger of our
bonded state must begin to bring
about some concrete changes,
for the anger is turning within
rather than effectively altering
our social conditions.

I would like to suggest one
concrete action that women all
across the country can make: on
the day that the Joanne Little
trial begins (July 14), women
gather at that place. On that
same day I propose a silent vigil
outside the prison in Muncie,
Pennsylvania — not to appear
