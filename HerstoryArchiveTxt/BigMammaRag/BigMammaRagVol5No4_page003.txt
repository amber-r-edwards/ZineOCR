SOCIALIST POLITICS  
Dear Sisters,

I'm relieved to say the least—to read  
your recent issue on feminism and the  
left. I can't help but feel sad by  
statements like Alix Dobkin's that  

all this socialist politics is a  

waste of women's energy. I want to  
say, Tell that to the millions of  
women who can't piss more than twice  
a day, if that, in their factories  
and offices; tell that to women who  
don't have money to adequately house  
and feed their children; tell that  

to women whose deepest pain has been  
manifested by alienating, intolerable,  
racist/sexist working conditions; tell  
that to women who cannot get decent  
health care because it is mostly  
available to white middle-class  
Amerika.

Let's talk about how foolish so-  
cialist politics are after these  
women—millions of them—who don't  
even have their basic needs met.  
Sometimes I get the feeling all of us  
radical lesbians—myself included—  
will continue blending ourselves to  
the current historical time we are in,  
and those with enough privilege can  
buy the state of California and leave  
the remainder of women in the USA and  
the world struggling for their basic  
survival. I say this with anger and  
self-criticism for all our indulgences  
(which) in many ways keep us from  
doing the necessary organizing which  
is clearly needed in order to allevi-  
ate the intolerable conditions most  
women live under in this country.

In Solidarity,  
Micky Duxbury  
Keep up the good work.

STERILIZATION  
Next month BMR will do a special  
report on sterilization practices in  
Colorado and nationwide. We would like  
to talk to women who have been steril-

DENVER FRIENDS  
Dear Big Mama Rag,

Recently we came here from San  
Francisco to do some promotion for  
a women's film series that our  
group is doing at the Ogden. We  
came into town knowing no one and  
within a day had space to stay in  
a woman's house, a car had been lent  
to us, and women have overwhelmingly  
responded to us and the series.  
We would like to thank the Denver  
women's community for its incredibly  
warm response and all the help  
and affection that women here have  
extended to us.

In solidarity,  
Trisha Case  
Linda Mayo  

Big Mama Rag apologizes for the  
quotation improperly attributed to  
Ruth Buechler, a lawyer associated  
with the Mountain Bell installers’  
sex discrimination suit.

Ms. Buechler declined to be inter-  
viewed due to the ethical restrictions  
on publicity by attorneys.

No opinions or information were  
properly attributable to her.

FOCUS EXPANDS  
Dear BMR,

We would like to express our ap-  
preciation for your article on our  
collective in your April issue. There  
are some facts we would like to clar-  
ify.

Our coffeehouse has not yet sprout-  
ed. Although our original concept was  
limited to a coffeehouse, our focus  
has since expanded to a womyn's center

We would also like to de-emphasize  
any connection between the former  
Lesbian Task Force of the Denver N.O.W.  
and Diana's Grove. There are several  
women who are involved with Diana's  
Grove who were members of L.T.F., but  
that is the only connection.

A reminder—look forward to our  
next fundraiser, "The Return of Gloria  
Gaywoman."

We thank you again for your support.

STATES:  
Federally funded women's confer-  
ences are scheduled to be held in  
your states in and around  
this year to “examine the barriers  
women face and to make  
proposals for their elimination at  
both the state and national level." So far,  
none of the workshops (on child care,  
health, education, media, etc.)  
deal with women and sexuality.
