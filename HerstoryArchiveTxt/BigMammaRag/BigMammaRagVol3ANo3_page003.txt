Letters Home to Mama

Keep it Together  
Big Mama Rag  

I am a convict at Soledad  
Prison and have been locked up  
over four years. And just until to-  
day, finally read your mag.,  
which I found very good, and  
well put together. If at all possi-  
ble would like to receive it, and  
from time to time I could donate  
poems, articles, different art  
work and etc. to add to your  
paper, that's if you want them.  
I am at the lock down side of the  
prison so your paper sure would  
help me do this time easier. If not  
a reg. subscription, maybe some  
old copies, cause I do enjoy your  
work very much.  

Whatever you can do for me  
sure would be appreciated.  
Waiting to hear from you.  

Yours truly  
Jay J. Atkinson  

P.S. Keep it together and stay  
light as a feather!  

Helping Jo Anne  
Dear Big Mama Rag,  

I happened to pick up the Feb.  
issue of BMA here at the hospital  
lobby and noticed two things.  
The Joanne Little article and that  
Feb. is % price month. Since I am  
tight on the $’s right now it  
seems only logical to subscribe  
to BMR and give the other $3  
I would normally pay to Joanne  
Little’s case.  

Perhaps others have done  
this. I hope so.  

Thank you for enabling me to  
do both.  
Pamm Vinicombe  

What’s In A Name?  
Dear BMR:  

In reaction to February's book  
reviews and Julie’s letter,  
“Credit Graphics”:  

Despite the merits of the in-  
dividual woman's drive for per-  
sonal recognition and the need  
for successful, creative role  
models, I hope that the feminist  
press will not abandon “freedom  
of the given name”.  

To require use of a father-  
oriented or husband-oriented  
surname would seem to demand  
surrender to patriarchal conven-  
tion from the start, overshadow-  
ing everything a woman says  
with the very domination from  
which she must escape. A male-  
dominated ethic may see the  
given-name/nickname custom  
as irresponsible or cowardly, but  
it actually offers the only way in  
which a woman can shape her  
expression of individuality, com-  
munality, and resistance to  
divisive status labels to an iden-  
tity that she can truly call her  
own. And such a statement rides  
on the value of what is said, not  

inside BMR

the status and credentials at-  
tached to a surname. I think  
there is some value in that, so  
long as the publication is  
protected from printing  
statements that are scurrilous or  
untrue.  

I can’t dismiss the notion of  
women’s voices as a kind of  
chorale, whose soloists are ex-  
citing, and whose members —  
anonymous in concert — blend  
individual distinctions into one  
sustained complexity that says,  
“I am who I am, and I am part of  
all of us who tell you, ‘This is  
Woman, and we (I) want...’ ”  
Perhaps the “first-name-only”  
usage beckons a woman toward  
this chorus and away from social  
fantasy, to make a world with  
room for real women, different  
from one another as they — and  
their lifestyles — may be.

but my grandmother used to say,  
“The colonel, lady and Judy  
O'Grady are sisters under the  
skin’’!)  

Love Sugar  
Dear “Big Mama Rag” People:  

We'd like to take advantage of  
your special March offer and  
order a subscription for $3. Your  
paper keeps us in touch with  
ourselves and our other sisters.  
Enclosed you will find a check for  
the appropriate amount.  

We also wanted to thank you  
for your part in the International  
Women's Day Dance. Love that  
B.S. Sugar and Co.!

Sisters in the Mines  
Big Mama —  

Just received your latest issue  
— love it! It’s so good to read  
about other feminists and the  
movement. There is so little of  
that happening here — although  
the percentage of women  
miners is rising at Climax, we  
still struggle against the sexism  
which we must face every day.  

I will be changing crews in a  
few days and that will be a par-  
ticularly hard time for me — fin-  
ding out how many of the men  
on that crew accept women (or  
don't accept) as miners or as  
equals.  

Anyway — you always give me  
moral support and strength in  
sisterhood.  

Keep on coming!  
Love you  

Jan Rodriguez  
Climax, CO.  

Taking Advantage  
Dear Mama,  
I'm taking advantage of your %  
off subscription price to send my  
mother and my sister Big Mama  
Rag. I know they'll both benefit  
from it. I wrote you before, and  
you asked where I worked that  
we got news about Joanne Lit-  
tle. I work at The Locksmith at  
3371 So. Broadway as a  
hairstylist. The Southern Pover-  
ty Law Center has been sending  
us literature. There are 6 women  
and one man who work here and  
we are all interested in anything  
we can do to help our sisters and  
ourselves. Your articles are real-  
ly getting good because they are  
getting down to basics and to  
ideology and concrete things we  
can work toward. Also I lost my  
issue on Spirituality. Could you  
send me a back issue? There  
were a lot of articles that I didn’t  
have time to read and others I  
want to read again.  

Also do you have sources or  
places you can suggest for infor-  
mation on Chicanas and their  
history? My man is Chicano and  
very into his history but he has a  
hard time telling me about the  
women’s part except in a subor-  
dinate role. Again my apprecia-  
tion,
