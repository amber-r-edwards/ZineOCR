A Socialist Feminist View:

Feminism Or Socialism Alone  
Will Be Ultimately Reactionary  

(The following is an interview  
with MR, who got her start in poli-  
tics with the Left. Since that time  
she has worked with a variety of  
women's movement projects, and has  
been an effective community organiz-  
er. The interview was conducted by  
Vicki Piotter.)  

BMR: How did you get involved in  
Left politics?  

MR: I actually got involved in left  
politics through my family. In many  
ways I was very fortunate during the  
Fifties when most Americans felt  
that socialism and communism were  
the biggest evils imaginable. A lot  
of kids grew up with the ideas of  
American democracy; I grew up under-  
standing that socialism and commun-  
ism were very practical and neces-  
sary systems for the future. Part of  
this came from the fact my parents  
came from European backgrounds—they  
were German immigrants and there's a  
much stronger history of socialism  
and communism in Europe.  

They also gave me a strong union  
background. My dad was a tool and  
die maker and helped organize unions  
for that trade. I always accepted  
the concept of organizing on the  
job, and fighting together, to get  
better working conditions.  

While we would have dinner table  
conversations discussing politics,  

I never really got fully involved  
in politics until the late Fifties  
and early Sixties when the Civil  
Rights Movement came up.  

BMR: How were you active in that?

Be Overhauling The Whole  
System...  

MR: A Black woman who lived in the  
same dormitory was very active in  
CORE (Congress On Racial Equality).  
One day she was trying to get every-  
one in the dorm—almost everyone  
was white—to go to a demonstration  
protesting the deaths of three Black  
children in Birmingham. It was a  
campus demonstration, one of the  
first, and I went to watch it. I  
was being very individualistic and  
was not planning to participate.  
There were some socialist banners  
in the demonstration, and another  
woman from my dorm who thought I was  
participating told me to be careful  
of who I associated with because  
many of the people involved were  
"socialists." I realized I was not  
so concerned with what label they  
put on themselves so much as if they  
were doing the right thing and got  
my armband and started marching.  
After that demonstration I got  
actively involved and also got in-  
volved with the anti-war movement.  
At the beginning I remained an inde-  
pendent radical: that is, I didn't  
affiliate with a particular party  
in the left. I affiliated with two  
or three New Left groups, briefly,  
but frankly was not a New Left type.  
There seemed to be a lot of grandi-  
ose romanticism; there'd be a small  
collective led by some super-honcho  
with a rock star image of himself.  
This was in the mid Sixties. At that  
time I didn't think of myself as a  
feminist, specifically, but did feel  
very strongly that I was an indepen-  
dent woman and I wasn't going to get  
into a groupie thing. Later on, after  
I dropped out of politics for a  
year...  
BMR: Why did you drop out?  
MR: I think it's very difficult to  
remain active as an independent rad-  
ical because you just don't get  
deeply enough involved. You can work  

on a specific action or a specific  
incident, but there isn't any real  
continuity in your work. That's why  
I finally joined the SWP (Socialist  
Workers Party). I joined it for very  
pragmatic rather than "principled"  
reasons as they were the group most  
active in the anti-war movement in  
the city I was in at the time. I  
wanted to do more than organize a  
few actions a year. I felt like there  
was deeper work to be done.  

I felt it was really vital if this  
country was going to survive at all,  
on pragmatic or human levels, to  
help build that kind of movement.  
That included making people aware of  
how our anger with the war tied into  
all the problems with racial inequal-  
ity and how it tied in most certain-  
ly with the rich and the poor. At  
that point I was also conscious of  
myself as a woman and how it tied  
into the role women have in society.  

After I joined the SWP I asked to  
be put on the women's fraction,  
which was working on women's issues.  
At that point the SWP was working  
for legalizing abortion. There was  
a big fight in the Women's Movement  
over how the SWP was trying to de-  
fine the Women's Movement goals,  
and trying to control it. That was  
my first big split with the party,  
over the abortion conference.  
(WONAAC conference, 1971).  

Unfortunately, the party line at  
that point on women's liberation  
centered mainly around abortion. A  
number of demands that the rest of  
the movement was beginning to make,  
such as being open towards lesbian-  
ism, had not yet been accepted due  
to their party line. The SWP was  
very instrumental in blocking new  
demands both in the movement and in  
the party.  

Now, the SWP has changed its posi-  
tion on lesbianism, but earlier it  
caused a lot of problems, just like  
it did for NOW, just like it does  
in society in general.  

Within my group there were a great  
many women who had been long time  
political activists. They were very  
seriously concerned about themselves  
and their rights as women. They were  
not just being led. There were a  
number of fights around the abortion  
conference and related women's issues  
that ultimately caused a number of  
us to leave the SWP. Some of that  
split was very bitter; many women  
felt betrayed. Women also started  
leaving the CP, the New Left, and  
various parties. Between 1969 and  
1972 a lot of different women from  
the left started coming together,  
individually and independently, and  
the Women's Movement had a new group.  

That's how I got into the Women's  
Movement, but I haven't said exactly  
why, which I think is important.  

(IT'S BEEN ONE OF THOSE  
ALL * NOUN;  
Days.  

I had been active politically for  
quite some time. I considered myself  
an independent woman; I didn't marry  
right away after school; I knew I  
was going to be successful at what-  

ever I attempted, etc. After I got  
out of school, where I had this  
illusion of great freedom, I found  
that many jobs that were available  
to me, if I didn't want to be a  
teacher or nurse, were phony white  
collar jobs. They would have minor  
titles, but no pay, and were often  
glorified secretarial jobs. The "can  
you type" question became very much  
a reality. It takes a lot of swallow-  
ing of pride to say this because you  
always think you are the exception.  

When I finally got married I felt  
the societal pressures categorizing  
me with my husband and putting me  
into a secondary position. That's  
when women's issues became real for  
me. It reminds me of an article that  
Judith Hole wrote on why the Women's  
Movement did not start with the  
women in the radical left, but start-  
ed with the middle-aged woman, or the  
women over thirty. They were the  
women who had no more illusions. They  
had the three kids, they weren't  
young "beauties," they were stuck.  
They were unable to get jobs, or  
got low paying women's jobs. They  
couldn't kid themselves anymore that  
they were going to be the exception.  

BMR: Considering your past politics,  
why have you remained a feminist  
separatist?  

MR: For any woman, the exploitation  
is very real and deep, though it is  
sometimes subtle. I think any talk  
of a socialist or communist state  
without dealing with the oppression  
of women will defeat any revolution  
in the long run.  

BMR: For the past eight years women  
have been throwing around the word  
"revolution." With all the women  
that you've worked with, how real do  
you think the process of revolution  
is for active feminists today?  

MR: That's a very difficult question  
to answer. I get very upset when I  
go to a meeting and hear women talk  
about Amazon Nation and use the most  
revolutionary rhetoric, only to  
discover that many of these same  
women will refuse to strike at work  
because they're afraid of losing  
their jobs, or will break a picket  
line because that strike includes  
men and they are not concerned with  
"boys" as they put it. I find those  
attitudes difficult to understand.  

The times I feel the revolutionary  
process most strongly are when the  
things I'm working on affect my own  
survival needs, like when I organize  
for better working conditions. As  
a lesbian, I'm going to be working  
for the next thirty years; I don't  
have any illusions in the back of  
my head of getting married and having  
somebody support me.  

Whatever the issues are for each  
woman, they have to be connected to  
her survival in some way.  

BMR: How do you resolve conflicts  
with women in the Women's Movement  
who are reform oriented?  

MR: The obvious reason people start  
as reformers is that revolution is  
overwhelming and people feel power-  
less. Most people's first reaction  

is "let's see if we can do this an  
easier way—let's see if we can't  
fix up what we already have." Radical  
feminists have to point out to women  
why reforms won't solve the problems.  
Why we are wasting our energy on  
band-aid programs when we should be  
overhauling the whole system.  

Revolution, to most people, implies  
physical violence and is very fright-  

ening. But we also have to consider  
the very real physical violence that  
the current system we live under per-  
petuates. The number of lives lost  
in racism, the health care system,  
Vietnam, and the number of people  
who die from malnutrition in the US.  
There is some confusion, however,  
as to what is radical and what is  
reform. One segment of our movement  
seems to believe that anything taint-  
ed by contact with this society  
couldn't possibly be radical, for  
example, if you use the courts or  
work for changes in working condi-  
tions. The fact is, short of revolu-  
tion itself and until after the  
revolution is successfully won, there  

is no way we cannot interact with  
the existing society. None of our  
actions are going to be that pure.  
That kind of purity, which some  
people call radicalism, is what soc-  
ialists call utopian. That means we  
try to pretend we've already won and  
live as if we were in the perfect  
post-revolutionary state right now.  
If we try to do that in this society,  
we are going to isolate ourselves  
and lock ourselves into a little  
dream world. We may call ourselves  
radicals, but we are not going to  
affect any change.  

Questions Surrounding The  

Family And Heterosexism  
Have To Be Recognized And  
Acted Upon...  

Besides, this “dream world" option  
is only open to those privileged  
enough who don't have to worry about  
working to pay the rent. The dis-  
tinction here is not whether or not  
we interact with the existing soci-  
ety, but whether or not we create  
demands that have a radical seed.  

If you simply demand that abortion  
be legalized, that is not in itself  
a radical demand. It can be achieved  
in the existing society and it can  
also, by itself, be used in very  
reactionary ways. (There are many  
people who would like to use abortion  
against Third World women as a form  
of genocide.) The demand for control  
over our own bodies, however, which  
includes a reform demand for changing  
the abortion laws, is a radical  
demand because there is no way the  
existing society will give us control  
over our own bodies.  

Whenever we work in a reform situ-  
ation, we have to bring in the under-  
lying demand that we're working to-  
ward.  

Daycare is another example. While  
we are currently working to get  
limited daycare programs or to pre-  
vent cutbacks in childcare for wel-  
fare mothers, the issue behind these  
actions has to be the demand for full  
daycare for every child in the  
country. In fact, there is no way
