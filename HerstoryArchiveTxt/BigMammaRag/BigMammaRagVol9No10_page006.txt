Free Rapists

The Mass. State executive  
council has begun an investi-  
gation of a judge who gave  
suspended sentences to five  
men who admitted to gang-rap-  
ing a woman. Judge Herbert  
Abrams had earlier attempted  
to redeem himself by switching  
the suspended sentences to  
a prison term after a storm  
of protests from women's  
groups. Defense attorneys  
for the five men say their  
clients ought to go free be-  
cause the judge, they allege,  
ordered the second sentences  
illegally.

Buck you!

A California man has sued  
the Los Angeles County Fair,  
charging he was deprived of  
sexual relations with his  
girlfriend after she was par-  
alyzed by a broken neck when  
she was thrown from a mecha-  
nical bucking bull.

Radicalism In NOW

Charging that the San Fran-  
cisco chapter of the Nation-  
al Organization for Women was  
being co-opted by the Social-  
ist Workers Party, the presi-  
dent and four other officers  
of San Francisco NOW. There  
are eight known members of the  
SWP among the almost 800  
members of the NOW chapter.

The conflict has been brew-  
ing for three years—center-  
ing over differences around  
the issues of civil disobe-  
dience (SWP opposed it),  
ties with labor groups (SWP  
favors stronger ties), and  
involvement in electoral po-  
litics in addition to mass  
actions.

Take A Leap

A prowler who awakened a  
woman (also in Wash.) made  
a flying exit. He fell from  
a second story balcony, a  
deputy said. The woman said  
she heard a noise and went  
to investigate. She spotted  
a tall man, apparently in  
his 20's inside her apart-  
ment. When she yelled, he  
fled and leaped.

Defective Drug

A Vancouver scientist has  
found that diazepam (more  
commonly known as Valium),  
given in high doses to mice  
and rats at the time in their  
pregnancies when fetal lips  
and palates are forming,  
causes cleft lip and palate  
deformities in their babies.

Cleft birth defects are  
one of the most common de-  
formities known to us, oc-  
curring in 1 of every 800  
babies born.

Thai Get Abortions

A proposed bill to legalize  
abortion is expected to become  
law in Thailand.

The legislation, which has  
passed the lower House of  
Parliament, and is being de-  
bated in the Senate, would  
grant abortions on demand to  
women.

If enacted, Thailand will  
be a pioneer in most of South-  
east Asia, where abortion is  
widely illegal. There are some  
exceptions in cases of rape  
or where the woman is endan-  
gered by pregnancy. But abort-  
ion advocates claim that at  
least 10,000 women die annual-  
ly out of a million who seek  
illegal abortions at the hands  
of untrained doctors.

Graphic Tactic

Rochester Women Against Vio-  
lence Against Women (RWAVAW)  
has claimed responsibility  
for 1000 copies of a self-  
defense poster depicting a  
clothed woman and a naked  
man which were posted around  
Rochester in late August.

The "public service announce-  
ment" gives advice like:  
trust your instincts, react  
quickly, loudly and force-  
fully, and imagine your punch  
going straight through the  
attacker.

The graphic points out wo-  
men's body weapons (i.e. head,  
hands, knees, etc.) and men's  
vulnerable spots with suggest-  
ions of a variety of physical  
tactics (kick, knee, punch,  
grab, yank, and bite).

Police are described as  
furious. Their first react-  
ion was to curtail the "ob-  
scenity" of the poster by  
scraping off the penis area  
from the posters, then later  
the whole posters were scrap-  
ed down.

Fight Back!

A Washington mother scared  
off a would-be rapist who  
menaced her with what she  
believed was a knife held  
at her throat.

The woman told police she  
was sleeping in a back room  
with her two young sons and  
awakened to see a man bend-  
ing over her who told her  
if she did as he ordered,  
he would not hurt her.

Instead of doing as he  
said, she screamed and began  
to bang on a wall that led  
to the other half of her du-  
plex. In response the attack-  
er tried to choke her, then  
fled so fast that he ran  
through a closed screen door.

Police Priority

Peter Sutcliffe, the man  
accused of being the York-  
shire Ripper, has been found  
guilty of the murder of 13  
women in the period from 1975  
to 1981, in northern England.

Feminists in the Yorkshire  
town of Leeds pointed out  
that in the early stages,  
the police had been almost  
reluctant to pursue the in-  
vestigation into the murders  
of several prostitutes. By  
the time he was finally ar-  
rested, Sutcliffe had been  
interviewed nine times by the  
police. His car had been seen  
about sixty times in the  
area where the killings oc-  
curred. Yet, he was not ar-  
rested until he started in-  
terfering with men's pro-  
perty by killing "respect-  
able" women.

Wives Arrested

Striking air traffic con-  
trollers and their supporters  
blocked auto traffic into  
the San Francisco airport for  
nearly two hours on Friday  
evening, Sept. 25. The 300-  
strong demonstration drew  
supporters from four Bay Area  
labor councils and more than  
65 unions and labor organi-  
zations. At least three pick-  
ets were injured when they  
were hit by a speeding car  
that tried to ram through  
the union line. Another act-  
ion to support the strike  
was held in Minnesota, where  
23 wives of air controllers  
were arrested for picketing.  
They were charged with vio-  
lating a city ordinance for-  
bidding picketing by anyone  
other than a striker. This  
violation of Constitutional  
rights is being challenged  
by the women.

Brothers Won't Clerk

Five senior officials of  
the Canadian Brotherhood of  
Railway Transport and General  
Workers, fired because they  
refused to do the work of  
locked-out clerical staff,  
are meeting to consider tak-  
ing legal action to get their  
jobs back.

Four department heads and  
the union's executive assist-  
ant were fired after they re-  
fused to open and distribute  
mail—tasks normally done by  
the union's clerical staff,  
locked out by union officials  
in a contract dispute.
