women in cages

way women are treated here in  
the depths of delta Mississippi.

I am here as a political

prisoner because I am a woman,  
because I choose to live with  
a man to whom I am not mar-  
ried. (I don't believe in  
marriage and won't ever! That's  
another prison), and because

I smoke marijuana, like 60  
million others, I could be  
railroaded here. I am a first  
offender and am serving a 5  
year sentence plus a $5000.00  
fine in the so-called worst  
penitentiary in the USA, for  
3 joints six years ago. I  
have been called a witch by  
the so-called judge who says

I deserve 20 years and that he  
will never let me out. I'm  
not worried about him, as I  
can get around him and I will  
be out soon. What worries me  
is the condition of my fellow  
convicts. I just moved into  
an “honor" camp, and I moved  
from a place of living hell.

I was in unit 16, where no  
one sleeps and psychopathic  
"guards" see how they can  
move human beings around like  
pawns in a chess game in hell.  
There is one "dorm" that they  
like to put the really dan-  
gerous mentally ill ones. And  
then they see how someone who  
is not mentally ill can take  
it. Luckily this didn't hap-  
pen to me, although I had to  
live by my wits for only 6  
weeks (that's how long I have  
been here), but some people  
have 20 years, 75, 100, life,  
and they will be there until  
they die, which hopefully for  
them will be soon.

Many have long sentences for  
drugs (using, not selling).  
One friend who is 24 years old  
has 75 years for forging  
scripts and checks. They put  
her in the dorm with the men-  
tally unstable, and she was  
attacked by 6 people with  
shanks, and the guards threw  
her in the lock-up when she  
cut her wrists to get out. So  
you can see it's best to get  
a job, but they are hard to  
get, and are only for those

by the ad-

at the men all day when they  
are not sleeping, and they  
stay up all night and yell at  
you are not  
crazy when you go in, you soon  
will be, myself included, even  
though I got a job right away  
and know that I don't have  
long to do. Most of them get  
out and return over and over.  
It seems to be such a waste  
because they all could do so  
much if they were allowed.  
They put lists of those who  
wanted to sign up for cooking  
and baking, welding, plumbing,  
etc. And when everyone signed  
up, that was the last we  
heard of it. The attitude  
here is that if you are a  
woman who is in prison, you  
are automatically a criminal  
and should be treated as  
such. Men here can do all  
sorts of things, but not  
women, and the women think  
that's the way it should be  
as they are afraid and brain-  
washed. We need publications  
that tell it like it is in  
other states because I know  
I don't have to tell you  
about Mississippi--it is a  
national joke. Any books or  
papers that you have would  
be greatly appreciated here.  
Everyone here is extremely  
poor, except me, or they  
wouldn't be here, because  
unless you have a very un-  
usual case, money will get  
you out pretty fast.

Thanks again for your  
letter.

In our struggle,

each other. +I

Sweet Mama

She grew up being beaten and raped.

Left with aunts and foster homes

and uncles who weren't related but

showed her how easy it was.  
She stole to keep her sanity  
Loved anyone who would let her

Touched everyone who would let her

and called herself Sweet Mama.

They put her in a 5X8 cement hole when she couldn't  
stop stealing at the women's prison.  
Put her in a mausoleum, a tomb where

she wasn't dead, where

she couldn't steal and give things away and

no one loved her.

All the drugs didn't help so

she set herself on fire, burning dreams,  
and nearly killed other women who had been  
raped and beaten and stole to stay alive

To keep their sanity  
They wanted to kill her  
Wanted the bitch to be put away.

Who the fuck did she think she was

To nearly kill them, interrupting dinner and cards.

They put Sweet Mama in an isolation  
Cell where they took her clothes and blankets  
But that didn't stop her. She tore a strip of

Mattress and hung herself.

And dawn is breaking, five  
months out of prison, and I  
wonder how I made it when  
Sweet Mama didn't

Assaults On Dignity

Dear Sir

I just happen to see one  
of your articles that you  
sent to one of my friends  
and I would like for you to  
print a story for me.

I've been in prison since  
the beginning of 1980. I was  
sentenced to 6 years in pri-  
son for forgery and I was an  
excellent prisoner and got  
out in 1 year and a day. I  
got out in February of 1981  
and things just went all  
wrong when I got home. I  
had gotten into more trouble,  
more forging checks and ag-  
gravated assault. The only  
good thing that did happen to  
me is that I married a very  
good man. I had al-  
ready gotten into trouble but  
he's stood faithfully by me  
through it all. I love him  
very much. I was sentenced  
November 6 to 15 years on  
one count of forgery under  
the habitual act. Which means  
the only possible way I can  
get out is through the  
Governor.

Since I've been locked up,  
I'll start with the Forrest  
County Jail, Hburg Ms. 39401.  
It was just continuous har-  
assment. I really tried to  
get along with the deputies  
that ran the keys but some-  
times it was just more than  
I could take so of course I  
told them just what I thought  
and several times they tried  
to lock me down but I would  
get a message to my husband  
and he would get them to un-  
lock the doors. I find that  
most of the jail personnel  
like to push their authority  
further than they really have  
the right to:

While I was in jail I heard  
one of the juvenile males  
hollering for the guard to  
come and help him because one  
of the other male juveniles  
were raping him. After the  
guard allowed him to go down-  
stairs and tell that he had  
been raped, he then allowed  
the juvenile who raped him  
to beat him up.

We had one officer who  
would go with one of the fe-  
male prisoners. I actually  
saw that because I was on  
the phone talking to my hus-  
band and it was taking place  
in a room around the corner  
from where I was using the  
phone.

Once when or rather at sev-  
eral times when I was down-  

stairs I saw at least 5 or 6  
deputies beat up the drunks  
when they would bring them  
in.

I think the thing that  
really upset me most is when  
one of the girls had a mis-  
carriage and it took the jail  
1½ hours to get help up there  
for her. We yelled and beat  
the bars till we just gave out.  
The Sheriff and Herbert Hart  
the head jailer just almost  
refused to let help come in  
for her.

After I was sentenced I  
just made up my mind that I  
had to get out of that jail.

I was transferred from the  
jail to Parchman on November  
24, 1981.

Just more harassment and  
here you really don't even  
have the right of freedom of  
speech. There's all types of  
punishment if you don't just  
jump at their every command.

At one of the women’s camps  
here which we have two, there  
are 48 private rooms and 2  
dorms which house 10 women in  
each. There is A, B, and C cus-  
tody. You have to start off  
in C and work like hell to  
get to A custody. Once you

Looking at the face of my daughter  
Peering at the eyes of my child

I feel the pain of a long-ago hope  
And the crash of a dream gone wild

My baby, my life and my heart  
and I love you

it's me,

I think you've forgotten who I am  
It's been such a long long time

Since I touched and caressed you  
And promised you'd always be mine

My baby, my life and my heart  
it's me, mama, and I love you

I keep telling myself they're good people  
Who condemn me and praise Jesus

They tell me you no longer need me

"It's only your need, believe us"

My baby, my life, and my heart  
it's me, mama, and I love you

Know I never wanted to leave you  
And I'll never stop fighting to get home  
To you, and Michael and Krista

So you'll know without hearing a poem

My baby, my life and my heart  
it's me, mama, and I love you
