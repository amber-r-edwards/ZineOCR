‘Internal Desert

Dear Sisters,

Picked up a copy of your newspaper
in Womansplace Bookstore in Phoenix
and didn't get but a few pages into
it before it became quite clear that
I would have to subscribe. I've en-
closed a check for $7.75, that's $6
for subscription plus $1.50 for a De-
mands of Women poster plus .25 for
postage.

It is so refreshing and energizing
to read words that make real sense
instead of all the usual crap that is
handed out in this state. There seem
to be so few true feminists around
here—it’s a desert in more ways than
one.

Thank you for all you're doing for
us—Hope to hear from you soon.

Robin

P.S. In reference to your poster,
does assorted colors mean that there
are assorted colors in each poster,
or assorted colors to choose from?
(if so do you have it in red or green?)

ed. note: Assorted colors means that
there are red, green, tan, white, or
orange posters—all with black ink.

Women Inside

To Whom It May Concern:

I am an inmate at the North Carol-
ina Correctional Center for Women
(NCCCW). Here we have very little
access to any kind of outside newspa-
per. I managed to get hold of one of
your papers from a fellow inmate, and
I enjoyed reading it very much. I
found it very interesting. This fel-
low inmate said you would send pris-
oners your paper free of charge. I
don't have any kind of funds coming
in and if it is possible could you
please place my name on your mailing
list? My sister is also here, and I
know she would also enjoy it. We
would both share the newspaper if you
could send it to us.

Thank you for your time,
Sincerely, Libby

ed. note: Big Mama Rag is available
to all women in prisons or institu-
tions free. We encourage women in
prison or institutions to respond
to, and send in articles for BMR.

Dear Sisters,

Enclosed please find a check for a
one year subscription. I read Big Mama Rag
at a friend's house recently and was
very impressed!

Points Of Unity

Big Mama Rag,

Re the article "What's all the
noise about points of unity?" by Kate
Sharp. I feel very sorry for anyone
who needs rigid rules concretely spelled
out to function correctly. And I
feel even more sorry and rather con-
temptuous of anyone who assumes
others will act incorrectly without
rules to spell everything out.

I don't want to write my own arti-
cle. I don't have the time to refute
all the incorrect logical sequences
in Ms. Sharp's writings. However, if
some group members are unwilling to
struggle, points of unity aren’t go-
ing to fight for themselves. As any-
one who has ever crossed a street
against the light when no cars are
present knows, the lights aren't go-
ing to jump up and stop them. Rules,
points of unity, need people to en-
force or represent them.

I would never say points of unity
are unnecessary. But the movement for
political, social, and educational
equality between women and men (femi-
nism) ought not be rigidly defined if
we intend to include all women. And
we must understand that all women
are not at the same level of politi-
cal awareness.

Yours in struggle,
Susan Alaine Beamon

Response: I certainly don't assume
that women will act incorrectly with-
out points of unity. But on the
other hand, I am equally unwilling
to assume that women will act cor-
rectly without points of unity.
Points of unity give us a better
framework from which to evaluate our
decisions and actions than does no
framework.

Certainly, points of unity do not
enforce themselves. That is our
responsibility. Through a commitment
to serious political evaluation, crit-
icism/self-criticism and collective
structure it becomes the group's re-
sponsibility to uphold the group's
shared points of unity. Points of
unity are not developed for the sake
of "enforcing something"—they are
used to give our work direction.

I think your last paragraph, for
two reasons, illustrates the need
for points of unity. First, do we
in fact, "intend to include all wom-
en"? Certainly, none of us would be
foolish enough to include in our
group someone who directly opposes
and actively works against our goals
(for example) someone who does not
oppose Capitalism in an otherwise
Socialist group. Without those
goals being stated and agreed upon by
all, that person could conceivably
and substantially disrupt or co-opt
the group. Secondly, I agree that

"all women are not at the same level
of political awareness." And yet,
obviously, we need unity of purpose.
What better way to help one another
develop the political awareness
needed for unity than to, together,
construct, uphold and constantly
evaluate those political priorities
we call points of unity?

Dear Sisters,

Please send me one Demands of Women
poster—black ink on yellow and one
sticker "Don’t Agonize Organize."
Enclosed is three dollars (.25 post-
age).

Living in Alaska, sometimes I feel
isolated from what other people are
doing. Big Mama Rag is one link that
I have to the world "outside" Alaska.
Thanks for being.

Blessed Be,

Our Senses Intact

AN OPEN STATEMENT FROM THE DISABLED
LESBIAN ALLIANCE

We need all events in the lesbian
community to be accessible to the
disabled. What does that mean? It
means different things for different
wimmin. For example, for a womyn in
a wheelchair, accessibility means no
steps to the event or bathroom faci-
lities and wide doorways (30-32"
min.). For deaf wimmin, accessibili-
ty means having programs and announ-
cements in braille. For partially
sighted wimmin, good lighting can
make all the difference in making an
event accessible. Sometimes when a
disabled womyn asks if a hall is
wheelchair accessible, she is told,
"Oh yeah, it's accessible, there's
only a few steps." WRONG! That's
not accessible. It is not accessi-
ble. It is not acceptable to offer
to carry someone up and down steps
as a means of access. For one thing
it's dangerous. What if there is a
fire—who will be responsible for
getting the disabled person out?
What if that person is dropped?

Many people become disabled in the
first place because they are dropped
or they fall. What about the strain
on the back of the person or people
doing the carrying? What if they
slip and hurt themselves? Besides
being dangerous, carrying keeps the
disabled person feeling powerless,
and strips her of her dignity and
self-respect, because it robs her
of her independence. It makes it
difficult for a disabled womyn to
want to be in attendance at an event and hard for

her to relax when she does go, be-
cause she has to worry about being
carried in and out.

Even when events are accessible,
many disabled lesbians cannot attend
because public transportation sys-
tems are inaccessible. Able-bodied
lesbians must take responsibility
for assisting lesbians with disabili-
ties to and from events in order to
equalize our opportunities for parti-
cipation in the community. For each
event a phone number should be list-
ed on the flyer that able-bodied les-
bians can call to offer rides and
that lesbians with disabilities can
call to get rides.

Publicity on all events should in-
clude specifications such as: number
of steps if more than none, location
of bathrooms (main floor, etc.),
whether there are sign language in-
terpreters, if braille programs are
available, and lighting conditions
for visibility and safety. The Gay
and Lesbian Switchboards should be
kept up to date on all events, so
blind wimmin can find out what is
going on. When special arrangements
such as designated areas for lesbi-
ans need to be made, no limit should
be placed on the number of able-bod-
ied companions/friends allowed to
sit with them, because we are oppos-
ed to segregation. Also, disabled
lesbians who require attendant care
should not be required to pay addi-
tional admission for their atten-
dants.

We don't want to have any more in-
cidents like what happened at the
recent lesbian pride concert, where
arrangements were not made ahead of
time to make the concert accessible,
or have it sign language interpreted.
When many disabled lesbians protested,
the women's music productions found an “accessible” entrance a
day before the concert. This en-
trance proved to be a three block
long tunnel, the temperature of
which was 120 degrees. After one
disabled lesbian nearly fainted,
the rest opted to be carried up and
down the steps, at great personal
risk to all. The women's music pro-
ductions were also unable to find an
interpreter since they did not plan
ahead to have one. This was a seri-
ous mistake. It is wrong to assume
that not enough deaf lesbians will
come to warrant an interpreter. The
fact that a deaf lesbian might come
is reason enough. The fact is there
are many deaf lesbians who would
like to become part of our communi-
ties, but do not because there are
no interpreters at most events. At
the Sweet Honey in the Rock concert,
where there was an interpreter,
there were at least eight hearing-
impaired and deaf lesbians that we
knew of who attended. As performers
