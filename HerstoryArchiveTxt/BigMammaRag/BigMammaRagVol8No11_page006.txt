Beginnings

"It just seemed like my load wasn't  
as heavy today as it had been," said  
Maurine Hedgepeth on her first day at  
work protected by a union contract.  
When the historic agreement between  
the JP Stevens textile company and  
the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile  
Workers Union was ratified October  
19th, few of the 2800 Stevens workers  
in Roanoke Rapids, SC were more joy-  
ful or relieved than Hedgepeth, who  
was a member of the negotiating team.  
"Sure, it's a new beginning, but I  
don't know what to expect from here.  
I feel like we almost have decent  
wages, but you know, it will be a  
long time before we really get decent  
wages." But the contract offers more  
than a badly needed wage hike; it  
offers protection, something Hedge-  
peth can especially appreciate. Back  
in 1965, after 15 years with the com-  
pany, Hedgepeth was fired for her  
union activities. It took a fight of  
over four years to get her job back.

Curious Godfellows

The Metropolitan Community Church  
of Columbia, South Carolina was mis-  
takenly invited to a fundamentalist  
"Love America" rally. These rallies  
are organized by Jerry Falwell and  
blame homosexuality, feminism, and  
abortion for the decline of the US.  
MCC's Rev. Nancy Radcliff attended  
the rally and was introduced to the  
audience with the rest of the minis-  
ters. When asked why they partici-  
pated in the rally, one MCC member  
exclaimed, "We love America, too."

Triangle Times

Lucia Valeska, of the National Gay  
Task Force, recently read a memo to  
a Portland, Oregon audience that the  
NGTF had received anonymously. The  
sender of the memo claimed it came  
from within the Reagan camp. The  
memo, which Valeska pointed out, was  
“unsubstantiated,” purported to de-  
scribe a meeting between Reagan and  
Jerry Falwell at which the two men  
agreed that if Reagan is elected  
President, Falwell will urge Rep.  
Larry McDonald (D-GA) to introduce  
legislation into Congress which  
would require known lesbians and gay  
men to file federal registration  
reports on the grounds that the les-  
bian and gay movement is a national  
subversion. Valeska told Gay Commun-  
ity News that the NGTF staff thought  
the memo was a “political ploy," but  
that it raised important points about  
the New Right.

New Wave

A survey by the Women Employed In-  
stitute finds that unionized clerical  
workers earn 21% more than their non-  
union counterparts. The figures are  
part of a report that argues that  
unionization is the most promising  
strategy for improving the conditions  
for women workers in the future.  
"Congressional and regulatory agency  
action have won us gains," says the  
report, “but unionization is the  
wave of the future." Only a small  
percentage of women office workers  
are currently organized into unions.

On the Rag?

The Emma Goldman Clinic for Women,  
one of the oldest women's self-help  
clinics in the US, has suspended  
sales of sea sponges as an alterna-  
tive to tampons. The clinic said  
that sales would be discontinued un-  
til more information is gathered on  
the possible potential health haz-  
ards of the sponges. Their decision  
to suspend sales of sponges came af-  
ter a report was released by state  
researchers warning that sponges con-  
tain sand, bacteria and other poten-  
tially harmful substances. Sales of  
sea sponges have increased dramatic-  
ally since the Center of Disease Con-  
trol issued a warning that tampons  
may cause toxic shock syndrome.

Two Time Zapper

A Massachusetts company is out  
with an anti-rape device called the  
“Zapper” that will temporarily stun  
an assailant with an electric shock.  
Kinecept Company says its Zapper,  
which is worn like a watch, is bat-  
tery powered and contains a pair of  
electrodes. Upon contact with an at-  
tacker, the electrodes activate an  
electrical current which generates  
enough voltage to break down the as-  
sailant's skin resistance. A weaker  
current is then directed to the sen-  
sory nerves, stunning the assailant  
for a few minutes, allowing the in-  
tended victim time to escape. The  
Zapper will zap you for a pretty  
penny, though. It's being sold for  
about $50 by Kinecept.

Young Feminists

In Switzerland, seven girls have  
been fined and made to pay court  
costs for refusing to attend domes-  
tic science classes, obligatory under  
state laws. They've been boycotting  
the classes, which they call “sexist  
and discriminatory."

Legalized Rape

A British government appointed com-  
mission of judges and lawyers has  
suggested that the government drop  
certain incest laws. The committee  
considered relaxing the law on in-  
cest, making it legal for members of  
a family above certain ages to en-  
gage in sex with each other. The  
legal “experts" suggested that a man  
could have intercourse with his  
daughter or a brother with his sis-  
ter, if the woman were above a cer-  
tain age, perhaps 16, 18 or 21.

They’ve Got Rhythm

The Republic of Ireland's contro-  
versial new family planning act ap-  
pears to be a near total failure, be-  
cause pharmacists are refusing to  
sell contraceptives. The act re-  
stricts sales of contraceptives to  
married couples who must have a med-  
ical prescription in order to buy  
them at registered pharmacies. The  
act also carries a “conscience  
clause" that allows doctors and  
pharmacists to choose not to sell  
contraceptives on moral grounds. A  
survey showed 50 to 80 percent of  
pharmacists were refusing to stock  
contraceptives.

Greek Feminism

The Greek Women's Committee for the  
Struggle to Change the Family Law has  
been organizing protests against the  
draft for a new Family Law. According  
to the 1975 Greek Constitution, Greek  
women have equal rights and responsi-  
bilities with men-- all laws which  
relegate women to a lesser status  
must be changed before December 31,  
1982. However, the government has  
made no effort to change the laws.

To protest this situation, women's  
groups since 1979 have been holding  
meetings and demonstrations in Greek  
cities. At the demonstrations women  
are demanding "the abolition of all  
discrimination against women and the  
abolition of male leadership, specifi-  
cally the patriarchal style of fam-  
ily; the buying and selling of women  
via the dowry; the prison of the  
house; the paternal authority; and  
the distinction between legitimate  
and illegitimate children."

Sterilized Surprise

Eight women "sterilized" at New-  
market General Hospital in England  
last year are now pregnant. The meth-  
od that failed was laparoscopy-- heat  
sealing the fallopian tubes. It's  
the most modern form of operation,  
and the fastest. But it also requires  
a lot of skill, and there are many  
women who have suffered from severe  
peritonitis (infection of the stom-  
ach lining) from a misrouted laser  
beam. In this case, the problem was  
a machine that didn't heat to the  
proper temperature, so that the tubes  
remained open. Another 50 women had  
this operation at Newmarket last  
year. What will happen to them?

Fallopian Funding

Feminists and advocates of Puerto  
Rican independence are objecting to  
the recent appointment of a pro-ster-  
ilization official as director of ob-  
stetrics and gynecology at New York  
City's Lincoln Hospital. The doctor,  
Antonio Silva, was formerly assistant  
secretary of the Family Planning As-  
sociation, which is the major steril-  
ization agency in Puerto Rico. Femin-  
ists have long protested the high  
rate of sterilization in Puerto Rico,  
which is widely viewed as a third  
world testing ground for population  
control ideas. Some one-third of all  
Puerto Rican women of childbearing  
age have been sterilized. Most of  
the patients at Lincoln Hospital are  
people of color, many Puerto Rican.  
Activists cite an economic reason for  
Silva's appointment: state Medicaid  
funding for abortions may soon be  
cut from city hospitals; steriliza-  
tion, however, will remain 90% Medi-  
caid funded. Increased rates of ster-  
ilization of women can provide a  
source of income for public health  
facilities.
