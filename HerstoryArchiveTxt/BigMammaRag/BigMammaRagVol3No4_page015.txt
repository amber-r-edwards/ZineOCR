Working Woman’s Account...

for others. Sometimes when
people would tell me that they
were broke, that meant they
were down to $50 in their
checking accounts, but they
still had fat savings accounts
and fat parents at home to
send them money, and I
didn’t. I tired of explaining
this to people and tired of
being embarrassed when they
acted like they were feeling
sorry for me but never once
offered to help me out in any
way.

People I knew in college
with money (which was
almost everyone else) seemed
to act as if money really didn’t
matter to them...they would
spend a lot of it all the time,
and that seemed so wasteful. I
grew to hate their casualness
and their easy assumptions
that everyone they knew must
be “like them” somehow, and
I think it came as a great
shock when they found out
differently. They got uncom-
fortable, didn’t know how to
treat me, and usually ended
up avoiding me.

This was about the time
that hippies began to get a lot
of publicity and illogically to
me, it was their style of dress
and their manners that be-
came popular as a result.
Hippies were supposed to
look like bums, yeah, but you
were either an “in” hippie or
not. The other kids would BUY
their clothes. Their clothes
didn’t get raggedy from wear,
and they also had a choice
whether to wear raggedy
clothes or not. I didn’t. It was
an “in” thing to look as poor
as possible, but only in a
stylish way. So this whole trip
still left me outside the rest of
the world as far as I was
concerned.

People would poormouth all
the time and try to rent cheap
apartments and cut down on
their spending, etc., but they
did that only because it was a
cool thing to do and not
because there was any real
need to do so. It made me so
mad because that cut down on
the places I could rent and
that I had to rent because of
the amount of money I had to
spend (or didn’t have); and
then too, when enough
middle-class people decided
to always rent cheap places,
that left only higher-priced
places for me, which I
couldn't afford at all but had
to struggle with anyway. It
was terribly unfair and there
was absolutely nothing I
could do about it except be
angry. Another thing that
made me furious about that,
was when these people did
rent cheap places, they would
spend hundreds of dollars
fixing them up with expensive
furnishings I never would have
dreamed of (nor could I
possibly afford), and I again
was not “in” because my
place was never as nice as
anybody else’s.

College made me angry
because I was encouraged at
every turn to make it my life’s
work perpetuating the mid-
dle-class system, which I not
only was excluded from but
which had victimized and
shamed me from the start.

But the absolute worst
thing that happened to me in
college was that these mid-
dle-class pressures and val-
ues became so strong that I
found myself selling out to
them. I conformed, in order to

~ be accepted. I spent money I
shouldn’t have and went
hungry so that I could have

some clothes that were
reasonably in style. I drank
beer and went out to eat. I
adopted some of the attitudes
of my so-called friends, in
order to become a part of their
group, although that kind of
total integration was never
really possible. I began to
think of myself as middle
class, and then, after a while,
I decided that by virtue of my
new knowledge of some of the
attitudes, manners, and
styles, that indeed now I had
become a middle-class wo-
man. That got me into some
circles where before I would
have been excluded. But I was
always trying to be like
everyone else and I was
completely miserable doing it,
because I just did not have the
same background they did
and never got the hang of
about % of the necessary
things that come naturally to
middle-class people. So in
many ways I was still an
outsider no matter what I did,
with the exception that now I
had people to talk to, and
since that had been a major
part of my goal in the first
place, I felt I had made some
real progress.

There were other people in
college from poor families,
too, but instead of making
friends with them and sharing
our common bonds, I had sold
out completely enough that I
now turned on them and used
them as objects of ridicule as
fervently as I had once been
oppressed. The middle class
was a place I wanted to be so
badly that once I felt a taste of
it, I was not about to give it up
for anything. It was a part of
looking out for myself, but at
the expense of trying to
completely negate and deny
all that had been a part of me
for twenty years of my life.

And then it was suddenly
over. I was out in the world at
last, my future seemingly
secure, with my past safely
buried behind four years of
hard work and a degree and
my newly-adopted middle
class consciousness. But I
soon discovered, to my
horror, that my past would not
lie still in its grave. The
feelings I grew up with did not
vanish into oblivion, and no
glorious life awaited me
simply because I held a magic
piece of paper in my hands.
No mere golden fleece was a
ticket to wealth and fame, and
I think I knew that deep down
inside all the time I was going
to school. I was torn between
despair and the still-urgent
desire to make a financially
secure life for myself.

I was caught between a rock
and a hard place. I had arrived,
I thought, at the gates of
middle-class heaven and had
not exactly been turned away
but there were not all that
many open arms, either. And I
was also being confronted
with my past, the same as
always. How was I going to
take this shy, sensitive,
still-imaginative woman, with
all her luggage of dreams,
needs, and unfulfilled desires,
to the promised land safely?
How could I ever get there
with all my fears, when I
couldn't even say things to
other people the way I really
meant? How could I reconcile
all those new things in myself
that didn’t really belong there,
attitudes I allowed into my
consciousness just because
other people told me they
were good? If I didn’t think
about it long and hard, I knew

it was going to destroy me. I
had met the enemy and
instead of fighting back, as I'd
always planned, I made
friends and took the enemy
within. I still felt more
strongly than ever that there
was something wrong with
me, that I was still somehow
not as good as other people. I
still carried a cloak of shame
around my shoulders, and this
time for some good reasons.

After agonizing over
thoughts like these for several
years, it occurred to me finally
that maybe, just maybe, there
was nothing wrong with me at
all. I'd accepted that judgment
for so long that it was like a
rut, and not so easy to get out
of. But just thinking about it
that way started to make me
feel good about myself for the
first time in many years, and
the more I thought about it,
the more free I felt, free to be
whoever I want and free of the
invalid, crippling judgments
of others, free of a false and
damning class identity and
more certain of my roots,
roots that were real, would not
go away no matter what I did,
and which were every bit as
valid as anyone else’s.

I do not know if I will ever be
totally free from feelings of
inferiority of “not being good
enough”...I think that even if I
had a million dollars in my
pocket, in my heart I would
still feel like an 11-year-old
child sweating in the fields at
the bottom of everything; I
would still feel poor. Any
dignity I have claimed I have
fought for, just as I have
fought for material security,
and I have paid a terrible price.

The pain and suffering and
humiliation I have lived
through, many women will
never know, except third
world women and working
class women, many of whom
have just plain given up. I
think in many ways I was
lucky, because I had enough
incentive to keep going. A lot
of us didn’t make it, and in
working class words that
means death. I am sorry that
for a period in my life, I didn’t
help; if I bear any legitimate
shame today it is for that
alone.

My story is far from unique.
What I feel as a result of my
working class background I
share with millions, especially
third world women. The
reason I have told it is to get
to the gut issues, to try to say
(in what words I have) how it
feels to grow up being used by
society for what it can get out
of me and damn near bled dry.

The point of all this is that
no middle- or upper-class
woman can relate to my pain
until she can feel some of it
herself. I know in my guts if a
woman is from a working
class background, and I can
spot middle-class values
coming at me from a mile
away. I’ve learned to depend a
lot on my gut-level feelings;
they warn me who is liable to
fuck me over the worst and
who is sensitive to my pain
and anger.

My anger about being
fucked over for my class and
caste is ABSOLUTELY INTOL-
ERABLE when I feel it coming
from women who think of
themselves as feminists, and I
feel it more and more strongly
every day.

To be a little more specific,
these are some of the things
that middle-class women still
do to rip me off, put me down,

responsible for her father's
Cadillac. In other words, a
working-class woman's pain
was countered by a middle-
class woman's guilt.

Guilt is a seductive tool to
manipulate and mask another's
pain and oppression. By
changing the focus of atten-
tion from another's real,
experienced pain and social
oppression, to a personal
mind-state such as guilt, a
middle-class woman justifies
in her mind the status quo,
i.e. her supremacy. She thinks
her guilt is more painful than a
working-class woman's entire
life of objective pain, (i.e. not
eating well, the necessity of
working at menial jobs etc.)
An uneasy conscience does
NOT equal a life of poverty.
Middle-class women must
begin with this understand-
ing. They must stop and listen
to the life experiences of
working-class women and
note the significant difference

between a working-class
world and their own. We are
responsible to listen and
change those of our actions
that continue to oppress other
women from different life si-
tuations. Likewise, men are
responsible to change their
attitudes and actions that are
oppressive towards women.

Once middle and upper
class women are aware of a
working-class woman's real
pain, they are responsible to
change their attitudes and
actions. Guilt does not
change the real conditions of
poverty. Guilt produces ac-
tions like Christmas food
baskets that make the poor
objects of pity, rather than
people responsible and capa-
ble of changing the conditions
of their own lives. A classist
person, who out of guilt
doesn’t want to be classist, is
like a racist or sexist person
trying not to be racist or
sexist. A guilty classist
person, in a hurried and
careless manner, will rush
about trying to collect work-
ing-class friends. A racist
analogy is the movie, “Guess
Who's Coming To Dinner.”
Oppressive attitudes and
manners don’t change out of
guilt. Sidney Poitier is de-
humanized in the artificial
gaiety of Spencer Tracy's and
Katherine Hepburn’s happy
liberal home. A change in
consciousness is needed, not
tokenism.

Working-class women are
angry. Anger is a creative
emotion when its true roots
are understood. Through that
understanding, a creative vi-
sion of a newer world is
developed. Right now, in
Denver, we are in the basic
anger/guilt stages of con-
sciousness. Working-class
anger is met with middle-
class apologetic guilt. What is
needed is that higher con-
sciousness of a woman’s
world. A woman, in a
woman's world, will have both
the virtues and strengths of
both working and middle-
class experiences.

A creative, open and honest
discussion of classism is
needed in our present wo-
man’s community. Here are
some of the points that have
been brought up, but need
much more thought and work.
Readers are encouraged to
write in their reactions to this
issue. Come to the Big Mama
Rag office for the discussions
on class that will continue

SOME IDEAS TO EXPLORE

1. Love is bought and sold
in different ways in different
classes.

2. The women's Movement
is class conscious for the last
three or four years unlike
society in general.

3. We are checking out our
roots and seeing if they have
validity.

4. When you get to
professional levels, you don’t
necessarily have to adopt the
value system of that level.

5. In thinking about
revolution, middle and upper
class women see only materi-
al loss, not the potential
freedom from being alienated
from their bodies, their ener-
gies, and their strength.

6. Men don't like women
and treat them like a piece of
shit; working-class people are
“women” in the eyes of upper
class men (i.e., subservient,
“under control,” inferior, “us-
able.")

7. I. Women are an inferior
caste in the patriarchal sys-
tem. The classes of the
patriarchy are stamped into
women's consciousnesses,
and that criteria for determin-
ing worth is carried over into
our dealings with women. We
bring to our experiences with
other women our socialized
values of caste first (lack of
intrinsic worth as women) and
then class value judgments.
We tend to value women
according to the type of class
background they seem to be
coming from. The lower it is,
the less value we attribute.

7.11. As new issues of
feminism arise, we create
sub-castes (which is exactly
what we are “programmed” by
the patriarchy to do.) This
prejudice and discrimination
is based on the principle that
anything that threatens the
status quo is evil--i.e., the
system must remain intact at
all costs.

8. The difference between
class & caste is that in a class
system there can be mobility
and in a caste system there
cannot. What determines a
person's values is not the
present class or caste level; it
is the values one was taught
while growing up--how you
see yourself, other women,
the world--what kind of
support you got for what kind
of things.

9. I. “The cause of much
violence in America lies
within the process of allowing
and keeping one third of a
nation poor. This is obviously
linked to the institutionaliza-
tion of social, economic and
practical inequality.” Thomas
Rose, Violence in America

9. II. The caste system is
artificial because it imposes
predetermined values on us
without allowing us to
choose. Society says what our
values should be; not what
they can be.

10. The higher the caste
level, the more resistance to
change.

11. The working caste is
important to any higher castes
only because they provide the
labor to keep the system
running, not because they
have intrinsic worth as indivi-
duals.

12. The heroism of hard
work is not a social value.
Example: the 75-year-old
cleaning woman does not
