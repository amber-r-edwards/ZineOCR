While sitting in an Annap-
olis courtroom waiting for my
trial to begin, I had occa-
sion to observe the sentencing
of a Euro-American woman who

mothers

had been convicted of welfare
fraud. The judge sentenced her
to one year, causing her law-
yer to leap to his feet and
announce that his client had
two small children so the
judge, after giving her a long,
searching, compassionate look,
suspended the sentence and ex-
tended her an opportunity—a
three-year opportunity—to
make restitution. The faces of
several women flashed before
me as I sat there mouth agape
—women doing three to five
years for the same identical
charge and who not only had
several small children at home
but who in many cases were
visibly pregnant when they
were sentenced!!!

The only difference between
my friends and this woman who
had so graciously been allow-
ed to remain with her child-
ren was race. African women
caught up in the judicial pro-
cess in America are involved
in a game whose rules are
aptly described by the tails-
they-win, heads-you-lose
statement. Incarcerated Afric-
an mothers have lost but fort-
unately nothing good or bad
remains the same and the time
has arrived to demonstrate to
all interested parties that a
number of African women here
in America bred true; and that
in spite of the lack of posit-
ive feedback from the so-call-
ed dominant culture and a lot
of times from our own sub-
culture; we have been, are and
remain women among women. Most
of us who are incarcerated
are incarcerated for survival-
related crimes which is to
say, attempting to procure
those items that would ensure
a well-nourished future gen-
eration. If I didn't know that
America had theorized us out
of the human race, then watch-
ing this judge bend laws to

return this white woman to her
children, while ignoring laws

in order to make sure I wasn't
returned to mine, would cert-

ainly have dispelled any ill-

usions.

The increase in the numbers
of African mothers entering
prisons can be directly attr-
ibuted to the loss of many of
our male companions to the
Viet Nam "conflict," police
bullets and to prisons...
warehoused in prisons because
their manhood would not allow
them to beg for ill-paying
jobs available, or jump on the

target-city bandwagons, being

drawn through the ghettos in
an attempt to cool off the
notorious long, hot summers.
The bellicosity of Western
Europeans, Euro-Americans and
adverse economic trends con-
spire to strip a large number
of African women of our comp-
anions and left us with babes-
in-arms in a lot of cases.
Legitimate opportunities to
earn a living wage are not
plentiful for African women
and have never been—growing
African children do not stop
requiring food for growth be-
cause the system fails to re-
cognize and establish instit-

utions to serve their needs;

African mothers are not blind
to the needs, desires and pain
of our children because we are
forced to exist in shabby ten-
ements—Motherhood and all the
instincts it evokes is alive
and well in the hearts of Afr-
ican women in America. The
desire for the best for our
offspring will not crawl off
and die merely because the
system we live under does not
see fit to offer us legitimate
opportunities to satisfy it.

There's definitely more than
one way to skin a cat...even
a Cheshire cat.

When women in prison get
together to discuss children
the discussion seems to al-
ways end with the statement:
"I wouldn't be so worried if
I had all boys." In our case
it doesn't signify sexism or
simple glorification of males
—it's a recognition of the
tremendous and numerous
threats our women-children
must face alone in their
highly vulnerable formative
years. ALL African children
are struggling against in-
credible opposition, but wo-
men-children are hardest hit
and more totally destroyed
mentally and physically as

they are fighting on several
fronts simultaneously. Amer-
ican culture is a hybrid of
European culture, so though
our men are penalized for be-
ing dark, the possession of

a penis triggers various fa-
vorable responses also...being
designated as 3/5 human is no
cause for celebration, but

the African woman was not
even accorded that slight re-

cognition. And no, I am not
another Michelle Wallace...I
am merely looking at certain
facts. I hope no African man
will insult my sincerity by
writing me defensive letters
that in the final analysis
affirms more than they deny.
So how does it feel to be
sitting in prison for trying
to feed/clothe your children
and being slapped down with
the statement "Well if you
cared so much about them you
wouldn't have committed a
crime," by singularly unin-
formed persons. Here's your
classic damned if you do—
damned if you don't situation,
you can squat in your "proj-
ect" and suffer with them or
you can procure them some
comforts and be taken away
from them. Oh, but there's
welfare...besides being en-
tirely inadequate to assure a
basic living standard—there
is pride. Yes, as quiet as
it's kept African women have
Pride. Incarcerated men are
instantly understood when
they say "Man I couldn't keep
begging those people for that
little bit of money" but peo-

ple go blank when incarcer-
ated women indicate that they
too possessed too much pride
to lay their whole life,
personal and otherwise, open
to some assimilated Negro for
the sake of a few bucks.

I'm hoping that 1981 will
see more people attempting to
learn more about prisons/pri-
soners period—women prison-
ers in particular—we have
been ignored far too long
and have been the victims of
"assumptions" based on re-
search conducted in male
prisons; our problems are
unique mainly because we have
been and are laboring under
a three-fold oppression...
color, sex and poverty...and
also because most of us are
mothers and no amount of
work with incarcerated males
will reveal the intense an-
xiety incarcerated women

feel in relation to our

children. The well-being of
children does not seem to be
utmost in incarcerated men's
minds—the men of Pontiac
are the first that listed a
grievance centered around
children.

Dessie Woods, an African
woman sentenced for killing
a would-be rapist in Georgia,
has been soliciting funds
for the past year in an at-
tempt to prevent her children
from being sent to foster
homes. The $$ Jesse Jackson
spent to go "rap" to the PLO
would have enabled Dessie to
devote her energies to the
legalities of her case. And
remember that Jesse Jackson
is the man who has rhapsod-
ized on African parents as-
suming responsibility for
their children and sharing a
strong enough interest to
"push for excellence"...well
Jesse in Hardwick, Georgia
there is an African woman who
does want to resume her res-
ponsibilities, who will push
for excellence and who needs
some of that money you want
us to give to the PLO. Assata
—a wonderful, dynamic Afri-
can woman who was held in
solitary confinement in a
Men's prison in New Jersey
for nearly three years, has
anyone stopped to think of
the psychological effect
coming to a Men's prison to
see their mother had on her
children??—let alone the
psychological/emotional ef-
fect on her.
