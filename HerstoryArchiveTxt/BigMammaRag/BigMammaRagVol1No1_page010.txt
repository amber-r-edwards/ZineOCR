changes in my body and to fantasize  
about the growth of a human being  
going on right inside me. I felt  
for the first time in years that my  
body really looked beautiful, and I  
got positive feedback about that  
from friends. It was a happy and  
exciting time for David and me.  
When I look back I can see some  
things I was blind to. What I  
thought was sharing being pregnant  
wasn't really sharing at all.  
While the baby was going to be ours  
in a real way, I was the one who  
desperately needed another woman to  
talk to. I was the one avidly read-  
ing pregnancy books. David read  
sections I suggested in various  
books, but he didn't feel the ab-  
sence of an expectant father to  
share with. When you get down to  
it, I, not we, was biologically  
pregnant. When the Third World and  
People's Park crises came, I stayed  
home to protect the unformed child  
inside me and David did battle in  
the streets.  

When I was seven months pregnant  
we moved into a house in Oakland  
with another couple and a single  
woman. We wanted to live communal-  
ly and literally took the plunge—  
barely knowing the other people.  
But dare to struggle, dare to win,  
and after all, we could always  
split if things didn't work out.  

About two weeks before the due  
date we waited in a time feeling  
that is very definitely one belong-  
ing to pregnancy—a feeling of days  
being epochs—a time feeling Doris  
Lessing captures so well in A Prop-  
er Marriage. At last labor began.  
It was slow and long. I spent a  
day at home and we kept saying, "Is  
it really happening now?"  

I was well trained in the pro-  
cess of natural or prepared child-  
birth, and David and I made a very  
good team of breather and coach/ti-  
mer. He was really there for me,  
helping me keep in control of the  
wave of each contraction. We are  
both excellent students and had  
learned our lessons well.  

The whole birth experience was  
one of joy and pain. It was a  
physical and emotional high unlike  
any I had ever experienced. "Pain  
and pushing and feeling relieved,"  
I wrote in my journal. David got  
tears in his eyes when I was final-  
ly dilated and started to push; I  
was totally involved in the physi-  
cal process with no energy to re-  
flect. How rare for me not to al-  
ways be watching and analyzing with  
my inner eye. David and I felt we  
were sharing a unique and loving  
moment.  

For many reasons the hospital  
stay was a downer. Mainly because  
immediately after the birth, I was  
separated from David. Once I knew  
Amanda was a girl who was perfectly  
formed physically, my main desires  
were to be with David and share our  
news with family and friends. But  
I was left alone in a crowded hos-  
pital. The nurses were hassled  
and bothered. I saw David three  
hours in total during the two days  
before I finally got rooming-in.  
After great protest and maneuvering  
I was put into rooming-in with  
three other women. Rooming-in  
means the babies and fathers are  
with you all day. My one night  
there I felt isolated from the oth-  
er women. They said things I  
couldn't identify with, which  
freaked me, like "I was my hus-  
band's bride, now I'm his son's  
mother." Discussions about endless  
shopping for the perfect crib and  
clothes went on. They told how  
being pregnant was their secret and  
how each decided the right moment  
to let her husband in on it. They  
each told their stories not really  
listening to the other women,  
waiting for the polite moment to  
relate their trip. I had enough  
consciousness then not to blame or  
put down those women. What this  
experience was for me, I wasn't  
sure; I was clearer about what it  
was not.
