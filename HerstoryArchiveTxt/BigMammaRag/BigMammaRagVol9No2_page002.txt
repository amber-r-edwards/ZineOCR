Safehouses in Denver

An Open And Shut And Open Ordeal

By Kathy Riley

With several fundraising efforts  
still underway, Safe House has col-  
lected most of the $100,000 it needs  
to re-open its shelter for battered  
women. However, another major prob-  
lem still exists: as of Feb. 1, the  
staff will no longer have a building  
to house the shelter.

According to staff member Debbe  
Warner, the building Safe House has  
rented since its inception was sold  
recently, and the new owner wanted  
a year's lease as a condition of  
Safe House remaining there. The  
board decided against it, since the  
$100,000 fundraising goal covers  
only a six-month budget, and in any  
case, the rent on the building has  
doubled in the past year.

"We're committed to re-opening as  
soon as we get the money, but we  
need a house," Warner said in an  
interview a week before the Feb. 1  
deadline. She said that while the  
search continues, the shelter's pos-  
sessions will be stored at the state  
mental health facility at Ft. Logan,  
and the staff will use office space  
in a garage owned by the YWCA. No  
one will be paid after Feb. 1, Warner  
said.

In the weeks following the Dec. 8  
press conference at which Safe House  
announced its closing, $79,200 was  
raised through a combination of TV  
and radio spots, corporate donations  
and a city-wide phone-a-thon. Another  
$15,800 is due to come in through  
pledges.

In addition, two major benefits  
are scheduled during February. On  

Sunday, Feb. 1, Victoria Station, a  
Denver restaurant, will sponsor a  
benefit between 1 p.m. and 9 p.m.  
Part of the proceeds and all of the  
gratuities will be donated to Safe  
House by the restaurant. Celebrities  
and politicians will be the draw,  
with a list including Congress-  
woman Pat Schroeder, Colorado's First  
Lady Dottie Lamm, City Councilman

Names under which DES has been marketed.

Another Denver woman has developed  
cancer which may have been caused by  
the drug DES. Lori Lynne Roebuck,  
whose mother took DES to prevent a  
miscarriage, has sued manufacturers,  
Foremost McKesson Inc., Eli Lilly and  
Co., E.R. Squibb and Sons Inc., the  
Upjohn Co., and Abbott Laboratories.  
Roebuck's suit does not specify the  
particular manufacturer of the DES  
her mother took, but contends the  
companies' "collective efforts and  
concerted activities via promotional  
techniques” resulted in distribution  
of a dangerous drug.

DES was used from the late 1940s to  
1971 to prevent miscarriages. Now  
the female children of women who took  
DES are showing abnormal cell con-  
figurations in the vaginal walls  
near the cervix. Some of these women  
will develop vaginal cancer, others  
experience a heavy, constant discharge.

CLUW Chapter Forms

The third of three required meet-  
ings to form a chapter of the  
Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW)  
was held on January 14th. To form  
a chapter of CLUW three meetings  
must be held with at least 25 card  
carrying members of at least 5  
different unions present at the  
third meeting to sign the charter  
application. 

The January 14th meeting was attend-  

ed by over 70 women representing  
20 different unions. The next meeting  
will be held on February 4th. At that  
meeting members will begin to map out  
the direction CLUW will take in the  
labor movement in Denver. To become a  
member of CLUW a woman must be  
a member of a union; non-union women  
can join as associate members. The  
meeting will be held at 7pm at  
360 Acoma St.

King Trimble, attorney Penfield Tate,  
Safe House, the only long-term  
shelter for battered women and their  
children in the Rocky Mountain re-  
gion, has suffered from financial  
problems since April of last year.  
At that time the Denver Dept. of  
Social Services refused to fund the  
shelter and chose instead to fund  
one crisis shelter for victims of  
family violence. Soon after, the  
shelter received $75,000 in court-  
ordered donations from two oil com-  
panies convicted of pollution vio-  
lations. Those "donations" plus  
each night calling others in the  
community requesting support for  
Safe House. Many individuals re-  
sponded with pledges of $1 to $20  
and more; others pledged monthly  
contributions for over the coming  
year. For information about pledging  
call 388-4268 during business hours,  
or send donations to P.O. Box 18014  
Denver, CO 80218.

Reservations for the dinners,  
which cost between $13 and $16, may  
be made by calling 321-4242.  
A second benefit is scheduled  
for Friday evening, Feb. 13, at the  
Denver Center for the Performing  
Arts. The play is "Misalliance",  
and tickets can be bought through  
Safe House. (Prices will be regular  
theater prices, but Safe House got  
the tickets at a discount. If you  
buy them at the door it won't count.)  
In addition, more money will be  
coming in from the Colorado Associa-  
tion of Pushcart Vendors. Carts,  
which are located downtown and in  
Cherry Creek North, will be dis-  
playing "Support Safe House" posters  
and will donate 5% of their proceeds  
to the shelter during January.  

A successful fundraising response over  
a three-day period brought in $37,500  
in pledges. More than 75 volunteers  
spent three hours each night calling  
others in the community requesting  
support for Safe House. 

International Women’s Day  
As you may know, March 8th is Inter-  
national Women's Day. The history of  
International Women's Day dates back  
to 1856 when, on March 8th, women  
in the garment industry marched  
from their sweatshops on New York's  
Lower East Side protesting terrible  
working conditions. On this date in  
1908, women workers again marched  
in the streets of New York City,  
still demanding an end to sweatshop  
conditions and child labor and the  
right to vote. In 1910, the Interna-  
tional Socialist Congress held in  
Denmark passed a resolution declaring  
March 8 International Women's Day.  

This year in the U.S. rallies,  
marches and other events are being  
held to pay tribute to working wo-  
men. In Denver, a day of celebration  
for the struggles of working women  
will be held at the Inner City  
Parrish, 910 Galapago from 10am to  
10pm on Saturday, March 7th.  

Recent reports state that DES was  
later found to be ineffective. In  
1956, it was proved to cause cancer  
in laboratory rats, but it was still  
prescribed through 1971. The drug  
was also used to stimulate growth  
in cattle, but was banned by the  
Food and Drug Administration last  
year because of its cancer-causing  
qualities.  

Over six hundred women nationwide  
have DES-induced cancer. In Lori  
Lynne Roebuck's case, treatment of  
the cancer will require a hysterec-  
tomy and a vaginectomy. A law  
firm which is handling a class-action  
suit on behalf of over 600 women  
states that it will probably be  
ten years before any kind of settle-  
ment will be reached with the  
drug companies.  

Workshops and discussion will be  
going on throughout the day. These  
will include workshops of general  
interest such as fighting racism  
and the direction of the labor  
movement. There will also be work-  
shops that may be of specific inter-  
est such as issues for parents,  
welfare rights and lesbians. The  
schedule for workshops and discussions  
are in the tentative stage of plan-  
ning.  

The ever-popular Still Ain't Satis-  
fied Feminist Singers will be perform-  
ing and there will be a time slot  
for international folk dancing.  
Big Mama Rag will be providing food  
for sale as a fundraiser. A wide  
selection of hot and cold food will  
be available for purchase.  

The committee planning International  
Women's Day celebration formed at  
a community meeting held at Woman  
to Woman on January 14th. Seven  
women attended that meeting and have  
planned the day thus far. Women are  
still needed and welcome to join the  
committee, and should call Sue at  
322-2847 or Susanna or Kathy at  
722-1032. The meeting nights are  
Wednesday at 7:30 at various women's  
homes so call for the location of  
the next meeting.
