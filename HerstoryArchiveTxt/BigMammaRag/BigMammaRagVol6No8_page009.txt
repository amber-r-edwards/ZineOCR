Dykes  
Against Dexter  

PHILADELPHIA, PA. (LNS)--PhiladelphiO  
women are gearing up their fight  
against the Philadelphia Daily News  
for columnist Pete Dexter's attack  
on women organizing against rape.  
Puerto Ricans in the city are protest-  
ing the writer's racist use of the  
pen against them.  

Women have been protesting recent  
columns written by Dexter where he  
makes light of rape, ridicules women's  
fight against it, and slanders lesb-

jans. Of a May 15 speakout on viol-  
ence against women, which Dexter was  
asked to leave because it was for  
women only, he wrote (in an article  
entitled ‘The Only Place Men Are  
Powerless to Enter’): "If they were  
looking for rapists, there were a  
couple of their own people who looked  
more experienced than I did."  

The protesters are also outraged  
by his insulting references to “hyst-  
erical lesbians" and sexual innuendos  
passing for humor in his description  
of meeting participants.  

Women took the fight to the streets  
on June 9 and picketed, with the sup-  
port of several men, in front of the  
Philadelphia Daily News offices. The  
demonstration resulted in a meeting  
with news editors June 21, where the  
women presented their demands: 1)  
Pete Dexter must be fired; 2) the  
paper must provide a page devoted to  
women's fight against rape and viol-  
ence; and 3) women must be paid for  
the work of producing this page.  

The newspaper conceded to print an  
apology for one line in Dexter's  
June 7 column. However, editor F.  
Gilman Spencer repeated his position  
that the columns should be read "with  
a sense of humor" and that Dexter  
would not be fired because the columns  
were not offensive enough to warrant  
his dismissal.

Woods & Hoon Free  

NEW WESTMINSTER B.C., CANADA--Prison  
activists Gay Hoon and Betsy Wood  
won an important victory June 22 when  
all charges against them in connect-  
ion with a recent breakout attempt at  
the British Columbia Penitentiary  
were thrown out for lack of evidence.  
Provincial court Judge Lorne Clare  
ruled at the conclusion of a two week  
long hearing that the prosecution  
had failed to make a credible case  
in alleging that Wood and Hoon had  
assisted the five prisoners in the  
breakout attempt.  

The prosecution had tried to prove  
that Wood and Hoon had rented an  
apartment and stocked it with cloth-  
ing and food prior to the breakout;  
that Wood had rented a car and driven  
to the B.C. Penitentiary on the day  
of the incident. It also alleged  
that Hoon had brought a gun into the  
Pen's visiting area that day, although  
no evidence of this was presented  
at the hearing.  

The preliminary was held to deter-  
mine whether Wood and Hoon should be  

Joan Little  

RALEIGH, N.C.--Joan Little pleaded  
guilty to escape charges stemming  
from her unsanctioned departure from  
a Raleigh, N.C. prison where she was  
serving time. She is expected to  
receive a six months to two year  
sentence.  

New York attorney William Kunstler  
was arrested on charges of obstruct-  
ion of a criminal proceeding when he  
tried to serve Judge James Pou Bailey  
with a change of venue. Kunstler had  
previously been banned from taking  
part in the defense. Charges against  
Kunstler were dropped as court had  
been in recess at the time he attemp-  
ted to serve Judge Bailey.  

It has been four years since Joan  
Little became the focus of national  
media attention by her successful act  
of self-defense against the sexual  
attack of a white prison guard in a  
North Carolina jail.

committed for trial on charges, which  
included attempted murder (a guard  
was stabbed by one of the prisoners).  
But they're not out of the woods yet:  
The prosecutor, obviously shocked by  
the unexpected turn of events, is now  
hinting that he may proceed by direct  
indictment against the two--bypassing  
the judge's decision and asking the  
Attorney General to sign papers com-  
mitting them to trial.  

Letters of protest are urgently  
needed to be sent to the Attorney  
General of B.C., Garde Gardom, at  
the Legislature Buildings, Victoria,  
B.C., Canada--demanding that further  
prosecution of Betsy Wood and Gay  
Hoon be stopped.

Mary Worlds  

TAMPA, FLA.--Mary Worlds, a 29-year-  
old Black woman with two children,  
was recently convicted by an all white  
jury of a crime she claims never occ-  
urred. She began serving a three year  
sentence for aggravated battery on  
Monday, July 11, 1978.  

Worlds was convicted of burning a  
patient with a cigarette while she  
worked as a supervisor at the Mariana-  
Sunland Training Center. Worlds'  
white accuser, Eudora Conner, was  
Worlds' supervisor until 1975 when  
Worlds was promoted over Conner.  
Conner claims to have witnessed the  
assault, but did not intervene, seek  
medical attention for the patient, or  
report the incident for four months.  
Seven co-workers, who regularly took  
care of the patient, testified that  
they never found any evidence of  
burns. A doctor summoned as a state  
witness examined the patient six  
months after the fact and said the  
marks could be natural skin texture  
changes due to aging.  

The Tampa Tribune has raised quest-  
ions about “possible racial motiva-  
tions" behind the charges. Worlds’  
case has drawn the attention of  
Florida Governor Reubin Askew and U.  
Civil Rights Commission in Atlanta,

BERKELEY, CA.--Holly Near, the singer  
well-known for both her leftist, top-  
ical songs and her involvement in  
contemporary women's music, has been  
denied a seat on the U.S. Cultural  
Delegation to the World Youth Festi-  
val in Havana, Cuba.  

Openly citing Near's lesbianism as a  
reason, the National Preparatory Com-  
mittee, organizing the 270 person U.S.  
Festival Delegation, made its decision  
by a vote of 28 to 3, according to  
Jean Flegenheimer, one of the three  
persons voting in the minority. Angry  
and hurt, Near issued a statement as-  
sailing the Committee's anti-gay  
action, calling it a “set-back for  
unity" among people struggling against  
oppression. She added that the deci-  
sion affirmed her belief that “patri-  
archal socialism is not a worthwhile  
goal."  

Contacted in Berkeley where she is  
working on a new album, Near told  

Gay Community News that this is “not  
an isolated case," since the Commi-  
ttee and other left groups have syst-  
ematically discriminated against  
lesbians and gay men. She referred  
to "an accumulated rage that binds us  
together as lesbians and political  
women."  

In her statement, Near said, "In  
every struggle for liberation you  
will find the incredibly strong, com-  
mitted energy of lesbians. Often  
these women are forced to stay in the  
closet in order to do their work.  
Somehow it is more understandable to  
me when a right wing organization is  
heterosexist, since they are often  
categorically opposed to everything  
that is progressive and life-giving,  
but for groups who declare they are  
working for socialist revolution to  
be blatantly sexist and discrimina-  
tory is unacceptable to me."  

Near also said that she had, in  
any case, not planned to attend the  
Festival due to “other work commit-  
ments." She said she had not even  
completed the second part of her  
application.  

Flegenheimer revealed that one man  
on the Committee who spoke against  
Near's participation in the Festival  
said, “We don't want somebody from a  
minority like that." A woman report-  
edly said, “We don't want anyone co-  
nfusing the women's movement with the  
lesbian movement."  

The National Preparatory Committee,  
ostensibly a broad-based coalition,  
was in fact dominated this year by  
the Communist Party and its youth  
group, the Young Workers’ Liberation  
League. Both organizations do not  
permit upfront gays to join.

ance of his/her official duty. These  
provisions broadly interpreted could  
mean the end of all mass demonstrat-  
ions and peaceful protests.  

In addition: The sexual assault  
section restores the current law in  
which the spouse, meaning husband,  
cannot be accused of rape, even if  
the couple is separated. The definit-  
ion of "hindering law enforcement"  
includes a reporter who refuses to  
reveal the identity of a news  
source. Any written material giving  
any information “directly or indir-  
ectly" about abortion, or any “desc-  
ription calculated to induce or in-  
cite a person" to have or perform  
an abortion would be banned from  
the mail and from being brought  
into the U.S. If a person "know-  
ingly" sent, helped deliver, or  
received banned material, they  
would be liable for up to 5 years  
in prison and a $100,000 fine  
($500,000 for organizations).  
Boycotts, such as those of non-  

ERA states could be considered  
extortion and blackmail, and could  
be punishable by 10 years in pri-  
son and a $100,000 fine ($500,000  
for organizations) because they  
might cause economic loss to a  
person or business. Enactment of  
this bill would also effectively  
eliminate the right to strike.

New Judge in Rochester Case  

ROCHESTER, N.Y.--No date has been  
set for the trial of four women arres-  
ted here last fall during a protest of  
the violently anti-woman film, Snuff.  
City Court Judge Alphonse Cassetti  
has been chosen as the new judge to  
replace Judge Maloy, who disqualified  
himself last May 22 just as the trial  
was about to begin.  

The four women were arrested in  
October of 1977.  

The Defense Committee of Rochester  
Women Against Violence Against Women  
will publicize the dates of the trial  
and related activities as soon as  
they are known.
