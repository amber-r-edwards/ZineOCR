she worked. She was killed in a
mysterious auto crash on her way to
meeting with a union representative

of OCAW (Oil, Chemical and Atomic
Workers union) and a New York Times
reporter with documentation of health

and quality control violations at
the plant.

* Early 1970 - Kerr-McGee plutonium
plant, built next to one of its uran-
ium plants (and on a flood plain in
the center of a tornado alley and
within five miles of 92 gas and oil
wells, 2 resort lakes and the Cimarron
River) opens 20 miles outside
Oklahoma City.

* October, 1970 - 2 workers are
contaminated with plutonium when a
radioactive storage container was
left in the open for 3 days.

* January, 1971 - 22 workers exposed
to plutonium when defective equipment
allows plutonium oxide to escape
into the air.

* 1971 - 1 worker killed when a
compressor unit explodes in his face.

YOUR HONOR, THIS DEFENDANT
OPERATES A PLANT THAT

HAS CAUSED THE DEATH

OF SEVERAL

* April, 1972 - 2 maintenance men
are splashed with a rain of plutonium
which was not discovered until after
they returned from eating lunch at a
restaurant nearby, also contaminating
people and food there.

* November, 1972 - OCAW workers go
on strike for a better contract with
higher wages, safer conditions and
better training. Inexperienced scabs
hired, with increased plutonium
spills and leaks.

* January, 1973 - Workers not re-
placed by scabs return to work with
a worse contract than before.

* February, 1973 - Fire shoots rad-
ioactive dust into the air - seven
workers are contaminated.

* 1973-74 - 3333 violations of the
AEC (Atomic Energy Commission) safety
regulations are found during a twelve
month period - only eight penalties
are levied!

* 1970-74 - 73 workers, including
Silkwood, had been internally contam-
inated (exposed to airborne plutonium)
over these 4 years. (Dozens more
had accidentally brushed plutonium
or had been sprinkled with it, but
had washed it off their skin.)

* July, 1974 - Silkwood is exposed
to airborne plutonium. She is not
wearing a respirator and had been
bugging the company for over a year
to buy a special respirator to fit
over her narrow face.

* November 5, 6, 7, 1974 - Silkwood
again contaminated with plutonium.
On the third day in a row, she re-
quests a search of her apartment,
where plutonium is found, especially
on cheese and bologna in her refrig-
erator.

* November 13, 1978 - Silkwood dies
in an auto crash on her way to meet
with a representative of OCAW and a
New York Times reporter to deliver
evidence of health and quality con-
trol violations at the Kerr-McGee
plant.

* Late 1975 - The Kerr-McGee plant
is shut down after less than 6 years
in operation.

* November 5, 1976 - A lawsuit is
filed accusing Kerr-McGee and FBI
officials of conspiring to violate
Silkwood's civil rights and conduct-
ing a cover-up. It asks for $160,009
in reparations and also charges Kerr-
McGee with negligence in safeguarding
the plutonium which through un-
known circumstances contaminated
Silkwood in her home.

CPF/LNS

Kerr-McGee has a long-standing his-
tory of lack of concern for its work-
ers. When uranium was touted as the
fuel of the future in the 50's,
McGee was right in there grabbing up
all the uranium fields. On a Navajo
reservation near Red Rock, Arizona,
Kerr-McGee exhausted a cache of uran-

ium after 16 years of mining. The min-
ers, Navajos, worked for less than
minimum wage and were told nothing
about uranium dust or radiation, and
had no ventilation in the mines. 25
of the 100 miners from the reserva-
tion have died of cancer, and more
are feared dying. Kerr-McGee refuses
to pay compensation.

Plutonium, far more toxic than ura-
nium, is even more of a danger to
workers than is uranium. Workers at
the Kerr-McGee plant say the plant
was well equipped when it opened, but
that equipment broke down and was not
replaced. Worker health and safety
was often neglected to cut costs or
to speed production of the plutonium
fuel rods Kerr-McGee was manufactur-
ing. Karen Silkwood, with other work-
ers, was consistently working on
keeping safety factors in front of
management, looking to the union for
support. She was also collecting doc-
umentation of health and quality con-
trol violations. It was with this
documentation that she was going to
the meeting on November 13. She was
killed in an automobile crash, under
very suspicious circumstances, on
her way to the meeting. The documents
she was carrying with her have dis-
appeared.

The lawsuit brought against Kerr-
McGee and the FBI by Karen's parents
and the guardian of her 3 children
is expected to come to trial in Feb-
ruary, with Judge Frank G. Theis,
the 3rd judge appointed in the liti-
gation. Theis ruled on part of the
charges in September, saying that
even if all charges alleged were pro-
ven, there is no provision for legal
relief or protection extended for
Silkwood or her class - unionists -
under the Civil Rights Act. Silkwood
attorneys have appealed that decision.

Some questions which remain con-
cerning Kerr-McGee and Silkwood:

Where did the plutonium come from
which was found in Silkwood's apt?

Was Silkwood killed (and by whom)
by having her car pushed off the high
way (as dents in the rear bumper in-
dicated)?

Plutonium is a Deadly Element

Plutonium is an element which barely
exists in nature - our present supply
is entirely human-made, a waste pro-
duct of fissioned uranium. Uranium is
limited in supply, but plutonium can
reproduce itself. A nuclear industry
brochure asks: How many pounds of plut-
onium will you have left after you use
3 pounds in a nuclear reactor? Answer:
4 pounds.

According to Dr. Glenn Seaborg, one
of its discoverers, plutonium is
"fiendishly toxic." It is much more
dangerous than uranium - extremely
combustible, readily convertible into
nuclear weapons and, once let loose
in the atmosphere, it stays deadly for
a quarter million years, it cannot be
recaptured or destroyed. One millionth
of a gram has been shown capable of
producing cancer in animals. An amount
the size of a softball will make a nu-
clear explosive capable of mass des-
truction.

Uranium is the fuel now used in nu-
clear reactors. A large nuclear reac-
tor produces about 500 kilograms
of plutonium as part of its waste pro-
ducts each year. This plutonium, along
with the other waste, must be disposed
of somewhere. One way the Atomic Ener-
gy Commission wants to use the pluto-
nium is in "fast-breeder" reactors.
Kerr-McGee made the plutonium fuel
rods to use in the so-far experimental
reactors in the U.S.

Plutonium is used now mostly for
bombs. Rocky Flats nuclear weapons
plant near Denver, CO makes plutonium
triggers for nuclear weapons. There
is an ongoing blockage by anti-nuke
demonstrators of the railroad tracks
leading into the plant, 10 of whom
recently went on trial in Golden, CO
for trespassing and obstructing rail-
road tracks. (See story, this page.)

Catastrophe, and Countdown to a
Nuclear Moratorium.

What happened to the evidence a-
gainst Kerr-McGee Silkwood had with
her when she was killed?

Where are the 40 pounds of pluto-
nium - enough for 3 Nagasaki bombs -
unaccounted for at the Kerr-McGee
plant?

Why are the Kerr-McGee Corporation,
the Oklahoma City Police Department,
the FBI, CIA, LEAA (Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration) and the
LEIU (Law Enforcement Intelligence
Unit) trying to bury the Silkwood
case?

Protesters Found
Guilty

Ten protesters were found guilty
on November 29 of trespassing at the
Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant.
But they were found innocent of 12
counts of obstructing railroad tracks
leading to the plant.

The defendants admitted they were
on the tracks on government property,
but said they were justified because
they were trying to halt a greater
imminent evil - namely, health and
safety hazards presented by the
plant's handling of plutonium and
other radioactive materials. Judge
Kim Goldberger had decided in an
earlier part of the trial that test-
imony from renowned physicians and
scientists, used to support the
choice-of-evils defense, couldn't
be heard by the jury.

Ellen Klaver, one of those convicted
of trespassing, said, "I say we won.
We succeeded in keeping the issue
alive, and in informing the people
out there about the dangers of that
plant.”
