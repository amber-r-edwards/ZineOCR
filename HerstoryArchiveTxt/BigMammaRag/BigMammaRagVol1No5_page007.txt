it happened to me -

coming Out by Becky

Attempting to put together
some coherent feelings about
the time since my coming out,
there are images of unfathomable
distances...being told at the
bank that only a husband and
wife can have a joint account...a
conversation with a man who
honestly couldn't believe I am
not flattered by men's obscene
sidewalk remarks...supposed
friends falling incommunicado
once my life diverged from theirs...
and most recently, a visit from
my lover's long-time, understanding
friend, who understands we are
healing from wounds we let be
afflicted at the hands of men,
understands we are passing through
a phase in which we lovingly nurture
each other (perhaps in her eyes as
contestants grooming each other,
soon to be vying for some crown
or other), and understands we will
be out looking for husbands to fulfill
our lives soon enough. And I am
at a loss wondering how lesbians
are to go about clearing the confusion
that has been thrown up like a
smokescreen, apparently making

it hard for people to imagine
what we are. Not that we should
feel compelled to explain to anyone
what we are about, but I am tired
of and angry with having people
assume that because my lover is
not a man, my love and/or commitment
is somehow not complete.

It seems only logical to me to
share life with one who experiences
it as I do--and no man knows how
it feels to be a woman. To be
socialized into a role so remarkably
narrow that any healthy self-interest
is abnormal, any desire to be
self-reliant becomes suspect. And
yet 10% of the population in this
country is homosexual, presumably
at least some of us women and a lot
of us feminists. Lesbians have been
the strength and the heart of the
Women's Movement since the very
beginning, and it makes me angry
that somehow we are so consistently
not included in projects we worked
so hard to help--Lesbian mothers
left so painfully just to keep
their children when women's concerns
merely to clear personal factors are
dealt with. Yet it is on these
levels that the real changes must
take place if people would see us
as we are and accept us for what
we are the rest of it would be far
less of concern. We are women who
at some point felt uncomfortable
having only options given to us by
a world controlled by men, women
who were strong enough to begin to
build lives which suit us as individuals
and not someone else's expectations.
Women who find that it is easier to
do that away from men who perpetuate
those expectations. We are women
whose love of other women is often
more understanding, more complete,
more genuine and more lasting than
any love. People evidently find it
hard to believe anyone could really
be as homosexual; I find it hard
to believe anyone could really be
happy as a heterosexual. But if
people are happy, what more is
there to say...All I guess I’d
like to see is for everyone to
find what human qualities they
would like to develop and to
thereby be full human beings,
and to let me do the same.

"How a beautiful friendship
blossomed" or (The Crescent
Wrench meets the Pen-knife)

A True Story By Linda T.

The day began simply, but
beautifully. I rode my bicycle
to the hardware store and bought
a crescent wrench, then I pedaled
on to a bicycle store and bought
a generator set. From that point
on I was truly content. I spent
the rest of the morning and
afternoon on the sidewalk outside
the graduate student offices,
installing my generator set and
adjusting everything possible on
my bike. For the first time in
my life I was successfully
mechanical, and I was using my
own tool.

No longer would I have to borrow
a wrench. I now had my own
crescent wrench, it was even a
genuine made-by-crescent-a tool
company crescent wrench. Unfortunately,
no one else seemed to appreciate
my joy, but I decided that was
only to be expected. Besides, I
was too proud of myself to really
be touched by rudeness or teasing.

But later that evening, something
different occurred. I was still
ecstatic, although my roommates
were beginning to get tired of me.
Then my friend, Linda, stopped by.
me: Look at my Genuine Crescent
Wrench!
she: It’s beautiful!
me: (to myself)(she really
understands!)
she: See my new pen-knife?
I just found it today!
me: Wow--it's really nice!
she: Want to go to the bar
tonight?
me: (who had recently given
up on bars and resolved to be
a social recluse) Okay--for
a little while.

Later that evening...
she: Can I come home with
you tonight?
me: Yes.

by Chocolate

May 22, 1973 I've just been
thinking that in the last
five years or so I've gone
from being a right wing
conservative to a liberal to a
lesbian feminist. When I
attended that first gay dance
and subsequent gay meeting
back in 1971, I found myself
coming out of so many of the
dark and shadowy places my
head had always been locked
up in before. My awareness
of myself as a woman and as
a lesbian has increased about
100 times since high school.
