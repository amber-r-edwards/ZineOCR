letters home to mama

I hate being called a Chris-
tian. The religion I most
identify with is the way of
life of Native American peo-
ple, the religion of Mother
Earth.

You also printed my arti-
cle in February '82 on the
history of anti-Semitism and
my feelings about being Jew-
ish. In it I say that al-
though I don't feel white
like Christians and ex-Chris-
tians are white, I under-
stand that I have white skin
privilege. I said that I
don't consider myself Third
World and that my life has
been a lot more privileged
than the lives of people of
color.

And yet you say that the
articles you printed on anti-
Semitism had the perspective
that Jewish women are women
of color. In fact, my article
was in response to the letter
by Sandy Katz, Shelley Kush-
ner, and Louise Brotsky in
December '81 BMR criticizing
Jewish women who focus on
their Jewish identity, saying
that it comes from "a desire
not to have to take full res-
ponsibility for fighting white
supremacy."

You have a dilemma. By mak-
ing the commitment to be a
forum for political struggle
and growth, what do you do
if, say, an article which
presents some point of view
you accept is also oppressive
to you for another reason?
For instance, one of the
articles on Jewish culture
you eventually printed was
also very mentalist. I re-
member that Vivian Meyer
called my article on anti-
Semitism and Jewish identi-
ty "negative" and criticized
Big Mama for not printing
articles which were more
"positive." Calling an arti-

cle "negative" for talking
about disenchantment with
one's patriarchal religious
upbringing, that's oppres-
sive.

I think it's good that you
are able to criticize your-
self and grow, and I also
think it is our responsibil-
ity as readers to do re-
search and write articles
on racism and other subjects
which are not getting covered
well enough. After all, you
are just a small collective
and I'm sure that putting
out a newspaper each month
is a lot of work. You are
still one of the only femin-
ist papers that focuses on
women as the makers of con-
sciousness, not a small, pa-
triarchally educated elite
of well-known women. The
things you criticize yourself
for: racism and anti-Semitism
are things North American
(white) women and gentile
women all need to confront.

P.S. You mentioned Bobbe's
isolation because of ageism.
I loved the article she
wrote a few years ago about
being working class. Bobbe,
I don't know if you have the
time to write, but I'd ap-
preciate hearing more about
your feelings on ageism.

(Collective Note: Dear Rose-
So sorry for negating the
contribution of your article

on spirituality as a Jewish
witch. It's more than a small
oversight and your particular
perspective and heritage is
very important.

When writing the article,
I recalled being so over-
whelmed with the anti-Semitic
decision-making process on
the part of the collective,
that inclusion of your arti-
cle seemed like "lip service"

by the collective, but I
really goofed in saying that
no Jewish perspective arti-
cles were included in print.
As to the concept of Jewish
women being women of color...
I mentioned an abundance of
that perspective being in
many feminist presses at the
time and that BMR was in dis-
agreement with that perspec-
tive, I did not mean to
intimate that your article
presented that perspective.
Sorry if it read as such.
Thanks for your article on
Israel/Palestine (see page 9)
please keep writing for/to us
and once again, I apologize
for slighting and mis-repre-
senting you. Deb/BMR)

Sub And Books

Greetings Sisters,

I am writing because I
would like to inquire as to
whether you might know as
to where I could possibly
be able to receive some
books on womyn and ‘gays.

I am a lesbian in prison
and we don't have any real-
ly good gay or womyn's books
here.

Hoping to hear from you
soon.

Oh, I need to know if I can
receive publications free, as I
do not have the money to pay.

Yours in struggle
Marysville, OH

Dear Big Mama Rag women/
wimmin,

Thank you for sending me
a free subscription to Big
Mama. And thank you for
sending me the issue with my
article in it. I used to
read all the wimmin's pap-
ers at the first of the
month. Just sat down and
read every word. And then
all the subscriptions ran
out. And I didn't have any
money. So I wrote to the
ones I thought I couldn't
live without, begging for a
free subscription. One wrote and
said, “only if you are in
prison." And the rest did-
n't answer. So you are, as
we already knew, something
special. Thank you, friends.

I just stepped outside to
throw my raincoat over the
woodpile and my feet slip-
ped on the wheelchair ramp
and then I was lying on it,
thinking, "Oh, no! Not
again!" But I didn't break
this time!

You are doing important
work. Thank you,

of
