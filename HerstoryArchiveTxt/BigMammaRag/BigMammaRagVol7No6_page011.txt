Raising a Male Child in the Women’s Community:  
A Mother's Struggle  

Judy Barlow  

I knew that he was going to be a  
boy even before he was born. Yes,  
it might have been easier if he  
had been a girl, but he wasn't and  
that was that. I didn't allow  
myself to dwell on it.  

He was little more than a year old  
when I came out as a lesbian. I was  
involved first with a woman in her  
late forties. (I was 23.) She and  
her friends were professional women  
without children. He was a novelty.  
He received a lot of love and attent-  
ion from them and called them his  
"cookie women." They were always  
giving him cookies.  

My first relationship lasted only  
a few months. By the time it had  
ended, I was already involved with a  
woman closer to my own age. We are  
still together now, four years later.  

He seemed too young to notice the  
change. The relationship grew  
slowly. We had been lovers for a  
year before we decided to live to-  
gether. He seemed to love Lori (my  
lover) from the start. She gave  
him a lot of love and attention and  
never showed any concern about put-  
ting energy into a male child. She  
said that she relates to him only as  
a child and not as a male. Our gay  
friends also showered him with atten-  
tion. A child was somewhat of a  
novelty in the gay community. He  
marched in his first gay pride day  
parade when he was 2 and has come to  
love participating in all kinds of  
marches, pickets, and demonstrations.  
He has frequently been the center of  
attention at these events--carrying  
picket signs and chanting with the  
group. He enjoyed seeing his picture  
in gay publications.  

As my political interest changed  
from working with the gay community  
to the more radical left community he  
showed delight in yelling, "You have  
scabs on your skin," to workers  
crossing the picket lines at the  
Coors brewery.  

When he was 3 I became involved  
with the women's community. It was  
then that we first discovered lesbian-  
separatists. It was hard on both of  
us. I was criticized for putting so  
much time and energy into a male  
child. He was hurt by the anger and  

I was traumatized and confused. I  
was asked not to bring him to some  
meetings. We retreated. Our "family"  
(Mother, lover, and child) took on  
more importance. We went to major  
events but attended fewer and fewer  
feminist meetings. I had decided  
that I wanted to raise my child and  
that was that. I was both unwilling  
and unable to consider the political  
implications. I was committed to  
caring for him and that meant putting  
much time and energy into him.  

I read about a lesbian woman with an  
adolescent son. The mother said that  
her son was becoming more and more  
anti-woman as a result of "hate feel-  
ings" from lesbian-separatists. I  
did not want this to happen to my  
child. At the same time I knew that  
it was important for me to work with  
radical lesbian-feminists. I was  
torn between my love for my child and  
concern for his welfare and my own  
needs. I wondered if I too may have  
been a strong separatist if it were  
not for him.  

I now work with radical lesbian-  
feminists, most of whom do not seem  
to mind the presence of a male child.  
Many of these women have shared in  
caring for him. Others are subtly  
hostile. We rarely talk about the  
issues involved. My solution seems  
to have been to pretty much ignore  
the problem while trying to keep  
him sheltered from the anger.  

He has heard Lori and me try to  
bottle-feed feminism to the gay  
male community. He thinks that  
"girl" is a bad word. His teacher  
commented on his non-sexist lan-  
guage and said laughing, "He even  
calls 3-year-old girls women." He  
once corrected my father for call-  
ing a woman a "cowgirl." "No,  
Grandpa," he said. "You should say  
‘cowwoman.'"  

We talk frequently about the  
differences between the way boys  
and girls are raised. One day  
when we were looking at toys in the  
Sears catalogue he asked why girls’  
toys were so dumb--meaning dolls  
and toy kitchen appliances, etc.  

I told him that it wasn't the girls'  
choice but rather the society's  

for expecting girls to prefer  

these kinds of toys. I told him  

how I had always wanted an erector  
set but got dolls instead. He  
seemed to understand how it hurt  
me. He said he felt sorry for any  
kid who got junk instead of what  
they really want.  

It's hard to raise a non-sexist  
child in a sexist society. Sexism  
is reinforced by peers, television,  
some children's books, advertising,  
and even by well-meaning adults.  
My child attends a non-racist, non-  
sexist school and still he comes  
home with sexist ideas that he has  
learned from other children.  

Finding good schools is not easy.  
In one “progressive” pre-school my  
child attended he was constantly  
observed as an example of a child  
with gay parents. They commented  
with relief and surprise about how  
bright and normal he was. Instead  
of the negative discrimination a-  
gainst him that I had feared, I  
found him being glorified for my  
sexuality! I finally found a  
school that really fit our needs.  
The owner of the school has actively  
supported gay rights and is a  
feminist.  

Because of my child's age (6) we  
have not dealt a lot with hetero-  
sexism yet. He told me once that  
an older boy told him that I was a  
"homosexual" and asked me what that  
meant. When I told him he said,  
"So what? I knew that." Being  
raised by two lesbians seems normal  
to him. When his class at school  
talks about their families he says  
that his family is a mom and a Lori  
instead of a mom and a dad,  
calling us his family.  

No Children Allowed; Pets O.K.

It gladdens my heart that the  
American public is celebrating child-  
ren this year. It does so in very  
fundamental ways: tracking of  
minority kids in the school systems,  
cutting back on student loans, tight-  
er and tighter welfare restrictions  
and food stamps, discrimination in  
housing, consistently low wages for  
mothers/women in the job force, in-  
adequate safe houses for women and  
kids from battering, protection from  
abusers of children, labeling kids  
"hyperactive" and giving them “thera-  
peutic" drugs to control them, girls  
being labeled "incorrigible" and send-  
ing them to juvenile jails, women and  
girls being denied abortions and  
being forced to give birth to unwanted  
children, families broken up by the  
courts because the mother is lesbian.  

After being evicted by one landlord  
in January, leaving a house that was  
literally falling apart in May, and  
a third landlord who is drastically  
raising the rent, I am once again  
apartment hunting with my 17-year-  
old daughter.  

I have been consistently told by  
apartment owners that they will not  
accept kids, by managers that they  
will not accept kids in their apart-  
ment buildings, but that a cat is  
o.k. Children, of course, are  
noisy, they are destructive, they  
might have friends come over, they  
might lose their key and disturb the  
manager, they might play the radio  
too loud... all of these things are  
unique to children. Adults, on the  
other hand, are always responsible.  
They don't make noise. They don't  
have loud friends. They never lose  
their keys or bother managers.  
Realistically, if a mother and  
child(ren) are tenants you know that  
there is probably only one income in  
that household and when the landlord  
(love that name) raises the rent, they  
won't be able to make the raise  
and the landlord will have to bother  
interviewing prospective tenants.  

If you have two or more adults you  
can assume that several incomes are  
coming in and when rents are raised  
the possibility of their staying and  
going along with the increases are  
more likely. If the tenants are  
male you can assume that their  
salaries are rising with the cost of  
living, whereas if the tenants are  
women that assurance isn't there.  

I have had women owners/managers of  
apartments who have raised their  
families but have refused to rent to  

Who are we really celebrating? We  
are in a country that is pushing  
down our throats (and robbing our  
stomachs) that old myth, the  
American family. We are hearing in  
all sorts of messages that the house-  
hold that is acceptable is the one in  
which the husband is present and in  
authority, the wife is a helpmate  
and the children are controlled.  
The American family not only eats  
Wheaties, it teaches its children to  
be consumers, to be nice, to be sub-  

He likes  

My son's father is gay. Their  
relationship seems to have changed  
with each of my ex-husband's lovers.  
Some of his lovers have been very  
supportive of their father-son  
relationship while others have re-  
sented it quite blatantly. There  
have been ugly painful times as  
well as positive ones. I hope  
that he will become closer to his  
father as he grows older and become  
less dependent on me. It seems  
like it would be much simpler to  
have a male help with instilling a  
positive self-image. The future  
seems unclear. I have so many  
mixed feelings.  

We work out our problems from  
day to day. In the distance I  
hear women condemn male children's  
presence at women's events. There  
is so much anger. Dealing with the  
situation is difficult for me. It  
is like an old but painful sore  
that just won't heal.  

When I look in his face and see  
the love and innocence and trust,  
it moves me more than I can say.  
And so we struggle and grow. We  
become closer and then are forced  
apart again. We are fighting a  
continuous battle with the outside  
world which finds lesbian mothers  
unfit as well as the women's comm-  
unity which sometimes condemns him.  
And yet, we continue to love and to  
grow, never knowing what obstacle  
tomorrow may bring.  

Missive to authority, to be sexist,  
racist, and to get ahead at any cost.  
Women are the key instrument in the  
teaching and if they go out on their  
own, or are forced out on their own,  
capitalism makes sure they and their  
children are punished.  

Programs are rampant in cities for  
the other kind of household--my kind  
of household, single parent and child.  
How effective are they? Who do they  
help? Who do they benefit? I  
don't know. The few times that I  
have turned to an agency in despera-  
tion, I left more desperate than  
when I went in. Luckily there have  
been times when I had alternatives  
because I had women that cared about  
me and my daughter. They have helped  
when I was sick, broke, despondent,  
and feeling low. I am sure other  
single parent women have had the  
same help. But not all of us have  
been so lucky all of the time. In a  
capitalistic society we are dangerous  
as we are showing our kids where we  
put our reliance and trust, not in  
government agencies and institutions,  
but in a movement that speaks out  
and works against those agencies and  
institutions that want to cripple us  
and make us conform.

The way I feel about this (my  
mother not getting an apartment  
because of me) is left out, not  
wanted, treated like shit, a  
disgrace to society.  

They would accept a cat any day  
over me or other kids for that  
matter. Fuck owners who don't accept  
me or my quiet cat Meekey Calico.
