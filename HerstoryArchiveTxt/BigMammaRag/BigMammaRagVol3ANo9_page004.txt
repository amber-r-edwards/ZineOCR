Andy Lillich is an organizer
and teacher at the Woman's
School. She teaches Freshman
Composition at Metro State
College and holds a Master's
Degree from Purdue University.

BMR: Is the school underway
now or is it in the process of
being organized?

AL: Classes begin
approximately in the middle of
October and we're planning on
having a catalogue out by the
first of the month.

BMR: Could you give a
random sampling of some of the
courses being offered?

AL: Legal Rights,
Assertiveness, Non-oppressive
Child Rearing... those are some
of the survival courses. We're
also offering Feminist Theory
courses, for instance, Feminism
and Socialism. I'm doing a
Literature class, reading and
writing, mostly prose. One idea
I have for the class is to ask each
woman to choose a book which
she most identifies with and
offer it to the class. That would
tell us where we're all coming
from and then we could
establish a dialogue and learn
about each other through our
reading, and, I want to add, our
writing too. I'd like to see us
make a bibliography for other
classes to use and I'd like to see a
collection of our writings come
out of the class. Chocolate
Waters will be doing a poetry
performance class.

BMR: What's unique about
the Woman's School?

AL: There’s a number of
things that the Woman's School
should be that are alternatives to
schools already existing. Like
the bookstore, our school will be
a Woman Space. In Women’s
Studies Programs you may study
Women’s Literature, but you still
study it like male literature is
studied.

This is a school by us, for us
and about us. And, we are trying
to make the tuition as fair as
possible, so we can reach those
women who couldn't even afford
the tuition at Metro. This school

is also for women who might feel
remote from traditional
educational institutions and
who might feel intimidated by
them. Ours is a street school.
BMR: Is tuition going to be the
same for everyone or will it be
determined on a sliding scale?
AL: Sliding scale, absolutely.
Our goal is to just meet

expenses. We're a non-profit
organization and we want the
school to be available to any

woman who wants to come.

BMR: When you say we,
who's we?

AL: Right now there's not a
real organizational structure.
What we have is a number of
people interested in the school.
This is the beginning; finding out
where the energy is and what
women want from the school.
We are going to create a
structure during the quarter.

_ We do need all the volunteer
energy we can get right now. I’ve
scheduled a
workshop to start after the
quarter begins, an ongoing
workshop to create an ongoing
structure for the school. I think
what we'll end up with is a
collective. The school will

probably need about five people
to take care of organization and
business.

BMR: And, in addition to
those people, you'll have
teachers moving in and out?

AL: These are questions I
hope the workshop will answer.
Whatever extra help is needed to
run the school could be drawn
from the teachers and students.

I'm interested in seeing the
organizational procedures get

created this quarter and hoping
new people will take over next
quarter. I talked to John Hand at
the DFU last week and got lots of
useful information. There’s a
sense of cooperation between
the two free schools. There are
good lines for sharing.

BMR: What kind of volunteer

help do you need?

AL: Registration is October 13
thru 17 and we need help with
that. The main concern is fixing
up our basement. There's a
possibility of not only helping to
build your own school, but of
learning how to remodel and
renovate. Anyone who wants to

teach a class or wants a
particular class offered
should get the input to

the center. (call 320-5972)

We are trying to find out what
women want and then trying to
find a teacher. The first and
second quarters, and possibly
even the third, the teachers
won't be paid. We've lost some
of those women who simply
can't do any more work without
getting paid, but we are finding
the women the school needs.

BMR: Very basically, the
school intends to offer
educational programs to women
who might not otherwise get the
opportunity, either because of
cost or not being able to find
what they want?

AL: Exactly. Or for women
who otherwise couldn't find a
school where they'd be as
comfortable. The whole center
is, in one respect, a project to tap
energy in Denver and to find out
what energy is out there.

From my perspective, I know
there are a lot of women in
Denver who write, but they're
isolated from each other. How do
you bring these women
together? You do a school.

BMR: What's going on in
October?

AL: Probably the basement
project will be in full, frenzied
swing. We'll be trying to get that
done before registration. We're
also tentatively scheduling a
celebration the weekend after
registration. Classes will start
the following Monday.

BMR: Will classes be held in
the evening?

AL: Evening and weekend
classes. Nobody's going to be
going to the school full-time. We
assume most of the women who
attend will be working during the
day or taking care of a family.
The average class will be held
once a week for two hours. This
first quarter will last eight
weeks, so we can get the quarter
done before Christmas. I don’t
know how long the second
quarter will be.

BMR: What would you like to

see happen in this project?

Feminist Credit Unions to Form in Colorado

Jackie St. Joan

The following is an excerpt
from a paper presented at
Sagaris by a group called the
Feminist Financial Union. The
actual organization is
hypothetical, but the politics are
real. It is offered here as impetus
for feminists to start thinking
about money as political.

We are committed to each
other's survival and to building a
women’s movement that has the
power to create a new society.
We recognize capitalism as an
institution of patriarchy that is
killing us and we want to strike
at its core, which is power and
privilege, i.e., money. We want
to learn about how money works
under capitalism so that we can
challenge it and build a political
power base. We believe we have
or can get the necessary skills to
make money work for us.

This work is in our own self-
interest. We need to make a
secure financial basis from
which we can risk political
activity as well as survive. Our
purposes are:

1. To help women learn to trust
each other. Money sharing is a
critical form of trust.

2. To reach across class and race
lines by providing investment
opportunities and loans to
women who may not qualify for
loans elsewhere.
3. To establish our credibility for
handling women’s money in the
community.

4. To provide a forum for
educating women in “feminist
economics” as well as a working
model for that education.

5. To provide financial
counseling to women.

Feminists in Colorado Springs
and in Denver are organizing to
form feminist Federal Credit
Unions in their areas. As of
September 15, Lisbeth Springer,
speaking for the Colorado
Springs group, said that they
were receiving many returns
from the initial inquiries which
they sent to over 300 area
feminists, and that by October,
they would probably have had
their charter meeting. The
Denver group plans to have its
inquiries into the mail to over
1500 Denver-Boulder area
women by the end of September.

What Is a Credit Union:

Credit Unions are non-profit
self-help financial institutions
owned and operated by the
people within their membership,
who share some kind of
“common bond.” The common
bond among women who join
the feminist credit union is their
dedication to feminism. A
person must belong to a member
organization to join the CU.
Members agree to save their
money in a facility they own and
operate, and make their
collective savings available for

low-cost loans to all members.
Members elect CU directors and
vote on CU policies at their
annual meeting — one member,
one vote, regardless of how
many shares one may own in the
CU. Credit union history began in
Germany in 1849. Friedrich
Raiffeisen, the mayor of a small
town, devised a credit society to
help his townspeople combat
poverty and usurious interest
rates. He reasoned that the
citizens of Flammersfeld could
save money together and make

Daily Cardinal/LNS

loans to each other at low
interest rates. The borrower's
character would be the primary
security for the loan.

The credit union movement
began in Canada in 1900, where
it has long been a popular
institution. The first CU in the
U.S. began in New Hampshire in
1909, but it was not until the
1930s and the passage of the
Federal Credit Union Act that
credit unions began to spread
throughout the United States.
There are over 300 credit unions
in Colorado, mostly associated
with places of employment.

Feminist Credit Unions

The first feminist credit union
was begun in Detroit, over three
years ago, and now has over
2200 members and over a half a
million dollars in assets. Valerie
Angers, one of the founders of
Feminist CU remarked, “It's
really an upper. After years of
never having enough money to
get anything together, feminists
now find that almost anything is
possible. There is money
available which they control.” The Feminist Economic
Network Newsletter,

_"Grapevine,” reports that there
are 9 feminist CUs in the United
States, with at least 8 others in
the organizing process. The
reasons most often cited for
organizing feminist CUs are: the
CU concept of self-help is
consistent with feminist ideals,
and operates to keep women’s
money out of the capitalist
banking system; individual
women can earn good dividends
(interest) from their savings, and
borrow money at reasonable
rates (12%); women are actually
investing their savings in loans
to each other, instead of in male-
owned and controlled banks
with sexist lending policies and
employment practices; women
are not discriminated against
because of marital status or
sexual preference; women who
want to start/finance feminist
projects will be able to borrow
money to do so.

Long-term goals for a feminist
credit union could include group
health insurance, retirement
plans, lawyer insurance. In
addition, it could provide the
community with an institution
through which members could
tax themselves through their
accounts in order to contribute
to a feminist fund. The fund
could be used to help sustain
and finance local feminist
organizations, and possibly
individual feminists.
