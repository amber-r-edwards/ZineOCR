Jill  
Johnston  
at CU  

Chocolate Waters  

It seems to me that every  

dyke in America has written  
love-letters to Jill Johnston at  
one time or another. I first  
started dashing off notes to  
this woman who has become  
one of the most well-known  
radical Lesbian writers in the  
country, when I was a senior  
in college. It was a time when  
nobody would dare whisper  
the word “Lesbian” let alone  
write about actually being  
one.  
Having been a closet dyke  
for years, I first stumbled  
across Jill in the Village Voice  
when she was coming out  
with “Lois Lane is A Lesbian”  
and other related articles.  
From then on I read her  
column avidly and even  
though I thought she was  
terribly obscure sometimes, I  
knew Lesbians were in there  
somewhere and I was desper-  
ate for information.  

At that time around 1970  
Johnston had not yet been  
politicized; she hadn't started  
relating Lesbianism to Fem-  
inism and was still what she  
termed “your average Ameri-  
can individualist.” A misfit of  
sorts, she never really fit into  
the Gay Liberation Movement  
and she’s still not quite  
comfortable with the Wo-  
men’s Movement-- where she  
has at times been viciously  
attacked. Although Johnston  
has a perceptive grasp of  
radical feminist principles,  
many women have found her  
snowflake patterns of writing  
too dispersed for ready  
understanding. Other women,  
however, carry around her  
second book, Lesbian Nation  
--The Feminist Solution, in-  
side their hearts like a modern  
manifesto of radical femin-  
ism.  

Livening up Boulder  

On the evening of Oct. 9,  
Jill Johnston sauntered into  
the Alumnae Hall at the  
University of Colorado in  
Boulder with an “entourage”  
which consisted of her 14-  
year-old daughter, Winnie and  
her 17-year-old son, Richard  
and a few friends. Flopping  
down in a comfortable chair,  
she crossed her legs, held on  
to her coffee cup for security,  
and asked us what we wanted  
to talk about. The audience,  
which consisted primarily of  
women sprawled in all direc-  
tions across the floor, seemed  
to be taken aback.  

Perhaps they weren’t aware  
of the intense criticism Jill  
has received about being a  
Women’s Movement “Star.”  
(i.e. a creation of the media  
who is expected to monopo-  
lize and overpower a situation  
with one’s very presence).  
Nevertheless, it was obvious  
at the outset that she was  
struggling with that dilemma.  
Both of her “speaking en-  
gagements” at CU took on the  
form of informal rap sessions  

with women interacting with  

Jill as well as with each other.  

Unfortunately for some, and  
fortunately for others, Jill  
Johnston speaks the way she  
writes--a sunburst of anec-  
dotes, personal perceptions,  
historical facts, and radical  
ideologies. Her mind kaleido-  
scopes in such a way and on  
so many different levels  
simultaneously that many  
women went away feeling as  
though they'd somehow  
missed the point. “Where was  
the logic?” they wondered. “I  
didn't think she made any  
sense at all!" exclaimed  
others in exasperation.  

One of the primary reasons  

for confusion probably cen-  
tered around the clashing of  

basic radical feminist ideolo-  
gies with more conservative  

questions of equal rights.  

That many did not seem to  

understand that such differ-  
ences even existed only added  
to the confusion.  

Opinions crossed class and  
sexual orientation lines, but  
basically the argument fell  
into two camps. On the one  
hand were the equal rights  
women who believed that  
legislative reform would cor-  
rect the oppression of women.  
They wanted to petition  
senators and legislators and  
work for reforms within the  
laws.  

On the other side of the  
coin were the more radical  
women who asserted that  
winning so-called equality in a  
world controlled by men and  
men’s values should not be a  
major goal of the Women’s  
Movement. These women  
maintained that the entire  
male system must be subvert-  
ed by creating women’s own  

institutions which would work  

for women and promote  
women-identified values at  
the same time.  

Coin Goes Back and Forth  

The coin, which was tossed  
back and forth sporadically,  
displayed both sides of the  
sexual orientation issue as it  
pertained to legislative re-  
forms and radical feminist  
underminings. Said a Boulder  
woman, “I wish all the gay  
senators and lawmakers  
would come out...it’s the  
people in the government with  
power and money who legis-  
late our existence. Change  
never occurs from the bottom  
up. It always happens from  
the top down.”  

Many women heatedly dis-  
agreed. “It’s exactly the  
opposite,” exclaimed a woman  
from Denver. “When you ask  
the system to give you validity  
by making you legal, then  
you're giving validity to that  
system which oppresses us.”  

Another Denverite argued  
vehemently that she didn't  
want a piece of the pie: “I don't  
want to be equal with what it  
is men are in this system and I  
don’t need male legislators to  

tell me whether I have the  
right to exist!”  
Jill Johnston, who sees  

espousal of radical feminist  
views as probably a major  
reason why she wasn’t under-  
stood very well in Boulder,  
offered her own view. “When  
the point remains at a sexual  
preference level then how are  
you going to educate people  
that Lesbianism means  
something much more than  
just who you sleep with. (i.e. a  
whole way of life, a way of  
undermining the patriarchy  
and creating your own situa-  
tions). “As women's con-  
sciousness gradually chang-  
es,” she continued, “women  
are finding it impossible to  
work in any kind of hierarchal  
structures. What's happening  
all over the country right now  
is that women are gradually  
withdrawing from these insti-  
tutions and creating their  
own. The question is how to  
do this effectively.”  

Many Unconvinced  

Many women, however,  
refused to be convinced and a  
staunch supporter of legisla-  
tive reform cited the abortion  
issue as an example of how  
the law can change things  
effectively.  

“But,” quipped Jill, “when  
women get their conscious-  
ness raised then they won't  
need abortions anymore.”  

Nevertheless, the argument  
seemed to be at a standstill  
and the rest of the evening  
was devoted to other topics  
such as psychic feminism,  
violence in relation to the  
movement, and the tensions  
(or lack of them) between  
heterosexual feminists and  
Lesbian Feminists.  

One woman wanted to know  
what Jill thought radical  
feminists were really into  
these days. She threw up her  
hands, almost cackled and  
exclaimed with a bit of exas-  
peration, “Romance, witch-  
craft and astrology.” She also  
felt that a lot of women were  
dealing with the question of  
“mahogany.” A man in the  
audience didn’t get the pun on  
monogamy. “Mahogany,” she  
explained patiently, “is a form  
of relating to just one other  
person-- you know, as op-  
posed to cedar or pine.”  

Although the discussion  
was still going strong at  
11:30, the building was about  
to be shut down on us and the  
crowd dispersed somewhat  
reluctantly. Nevertheless,  
many of the same women  
came to Jill's informal talk at  
the student union the next  
day. The setting was some-  
what more formal with Jill on  
stage this time, but the  
proceedings were basically  
the same.  

As she was reading from a  
new piece concerning  
“smother-daughter" relation-  
ships, I was thinking more  
about what a nice person she  
really was than about what  
she was reading. Jill Johnston  
was infamous for being outra-  
geous--for throwing chairs  
and plates of fruit, for  
swimming half-nude at an  
elegant fund-raising benefit,  
for blatantly asking Gloria  
Steinem to dance etc. These  
antics surrounded Jill like an  
aura, but in person she was  
very serious, usually witty,  
and sometimes even shy. She  
even dealt with the men in the  
audience in a nice way when  
they prated on about whatever  
it was they were prating on  
about. Mostly, however, I was  
impressed with how genuinely  
she responded to other  
women and how very real she  
was in person.  

Her latest book, Gullible’s  
Travels is now available at  
local bookstores.
