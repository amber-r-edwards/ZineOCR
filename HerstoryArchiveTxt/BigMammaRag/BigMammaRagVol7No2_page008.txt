This Time In Boulder

Dancing Dykes Do It Again

Kim Womantree

A small but heartwarming victory
for lesbians and gay men was achieved
Friday night, February 16th, at Is-
adora's, a formerly straight bar in
Boulder. A 50 person picket forced
the management of the bar to allow
persons of the same sex to dance to-
gether.

On Wednesday night, February 14th,
12 lesbians were thrown out of Isa-
dora's for attempting to join the
Valentine's Day dance contest.

Earlier in the month, 70 lesbians
and gay men took over the dance floor
of the Monkey Bar, another straight
Boulder bar that had refused to let
gay couples dance together. Because
of this action the Monkey Bar now has
"Queer Night" every Thursday. Boulder
has no gay dance bars.

Many women and men felt that one
night a week was not enough so deci-
ded to tackle Isadora's on Valentine's
night. The purpose was twofold; 1)
to gain some basic civil rights, 2)
by their presence, to accustom heter-
osexuals to open gays and so defuse
their fears of queers.

Rumor had it that things were
likely to get heavy for the men at
Isadora's Wednesday night, but not
for the women, as women dancing toge-
ther "turns straight men on." So the
dozen women came to protect the men.
Only one man showed, and he had no
one to dance with. The women, on
daunted, danced, urging each other on
to more and better blatancy. At one
time, the lesbians slow-dancing out-
numbered the mixed couples (on the
floor) three to one.

Straight men may or may not have
been turned on, but the manager of
Isadora's was not pleased. At eleven,
the time the disco dance contest was
supposed to start, a flunky in blue
came over to the women who were danc-
ing and very politely asked them to
get off the floor. Only male/female
couples were to be in the dance con-
test. Why? “Management policy.” De-
sides, there had been, he said, custo-
mer complaints.

The 12 women, outraged, gathered
to talk strategy. Meanwhile, since
the dance floor was forbidden, many
lesbians were dancing in the aisles.
The manager was still not pleased. A
sample conversation:

Manager: You're going to have to stop
that.

Woman wearing Dyke button: boogying:
Stop what?

Manager: Stop dancing. Or we'll have
to throw you out.

Woman: I'm not dancing. I am moving
my body in time to the music, snap-
ping my fingers, and staring at the
dance floor. Would you stop a man
from doing that?

Manager: That's irrelevant.

Woman: And you're getting a discrim-
ination suit.

The manager then claimed that the
problem with the women Wednesday night was that they were "putting on a demonstration," and that anyone was welcome to come in and dance.

This offer was quickly taken up by
various women and men who danced,
strolled around the bar hand-in-hand,
etc. One woman had a drink poured on
her, but there was no other incident.

So, a limited victory. From it we
learn that everybody (bar owners,
gay people, and especially most
straight people) is happier when les-
bians and gay men stay “in their own
place" and don't bother them. However,
this is short-term happiness. Our
long-term happiness lies in strength-
ening ourselves in our own space and
taking this pride and strength into
the big cold world. So go to Isador-
a's if you're up Boulder way - bring
your own booze - and bring your own
friends.

An insight I got from this whole
business is what a potent secret
weapon lesbian-feminists have in our
arsenal. Our blatant presence seems
to provoke a very peculiar emotional
response in straight bar owners - a
mixture of loathing, lust, and fear.
When they're off balance like that,
plus worrying about losing straight
customers, you have a lever. This
lever was used at a Thornton disco
last year to cut out sexist radio ad-
vertising. What else could we do with
it?

Denver Women’s Health

Clinic Opens

The Denver Women's Health Clinic
will at last be open for clients
this month. The clinic will provide
complete health care services for
women, from physicals and general
care to gynecological care.

A women's health care collective
has been in existence in Denver for
several years. They organized the
Women's Health and Healing Confer-
ence in 1977 and had ultimate plans
of opening a women's health clinic.
The original collective was hampered
by lack of money and a doctor to
back up the nurse practitioners.
This collective has overcome both
obstacles and the clinic is a rea-
lity.

The clinic is located at 1829 High
Street. This location is only 3
blocks off the #15 RTD bus route,
5 blocks off the #24 and 1 block
off the #20.

Women will be encouraged to take
an active role in their health care,
all options will be explained, with
the final decisions resting with
the patient.

Classes and workshops are going
to be held by women working at the
clinic. These classes will include
self-examination workshops. There
is also a medical reference library
available.

Sunday, March 11th, an open house
is being held at the clinic. Every-
one is invited. Come between 2 and 6
