Sagaris: The End Of  
A Love Affair  

Jackie St. Joan  

The quotes that appear  
throughout this article were  
some of the lessons of Sagaris.  
The story that follows is a living-  
out of those lessons. Taking and  
sharing power. Fear of conflict.  
False self-protection. Passivity.  
Bad feelings. Hidden structures.  
False sense of unity. Per-  
sonalizing criticism. Passing  
over differences. Repeating past  
mistakes.  

I think my preceding story  
communicates the depth and  
high quality of education that  
Sagaris was — that was made  
possible through the enormous  
effort and commitment of the  
women of the Sagaris collective,  
both past and present. The  
following story is based on the  
assumption of good faith  
towards them, and, more par-  
ticularly, accountability to  
BMR’s readers.  

Most of us gave up sometime  
during the first week trying to  
write home to explain what was  
happening at Sagaris. Caught in  
a web of friendliness and dis-  
orientation, we were minding  
our manners and making con-  
nections with each other.  
Charlotte Bunch said it the first  
week: “Relax,” she said.  
“There's an atmosphere here of  
everyone trying to be the perfect  
feminist. Take some risks. Ex-  
periment. You need not stand by  
every word you say forever.”  

But we passed over many of  
our differences, bathed in the  
glow of sisterhood and assumed  
commonality. The conflicts that  

When women dis-  
agree politically, often  
the group’s emotions  
become the focus of  
the group, instead of  
the actual political dif-  
ferences. This is a re-  
sult of middle-class as-  
sumptions that conflict  
and anger are taboo.  
Conflict can be a way  
of staying together.  

— Rita Mae Brown  

did arise in the community were  
spoken softly one-to-one or in  
small groups. No one wanted to  
make waves to disrupt this  
wonderful gathering.  
Resentments Build  

But underneath the  
sweetness and light, there were  
resentments building. Some had  
begun even before women had  
left their home communities.  
One woman from California told  
me she had been labeled an  
“elitist” for even coming to  
Sagaris in the first place, since  
many of the activists back home  
couldn't afford the time or the  
price of tuition ($700 per ses-  
sion), and she could. Others  
wondered why they weren't  
allowed to have their dogs in the  
dorms, when the Sagaris collec-  
tive and one of the faculty  
members had their dogs with  
them in the dorms. The daycare  
workers (who were working for  
their tuition, room and board)  
were angry at having to work 30  
hours a week and take classes  
too. And at dinner the first night,  
one long-haired dyke called for a  
community meeting that even-  
ing to discuss lesbian invisibility  
at Sagaris.  
Lesbianism Out of the Closet  

And so lesbianism was the  
first issue out of the closet.  
Some women felt that the  
collective’s announcements at  
dinner that foundation people  
and evaluation teams were on  
campus was an unspoken in-  
struction to “be cool” and not to  
act like dykes. At one point, the  

collective was asked how they  
explain lesbian presence to  
foundation and press people.  
“We tell them we don’t question  
women’s sexual preference in  
coming here. Who they sleep  
with is their own business. Or  
we tell them that lesbians repre-  
sent a large part of the women’s  
movement, so naturally a lot of  
lesbians would come to  
Sagaris.” Some women com-  
plained that this was a closety  
approach to the issue. Others  
said, no foundation is going to  
fund a dyke school. Others said,  
we don't need the man’s money  
anyway. Others said, let's not be  
purists.  

Don’t trade yourself in  
for keeping relation-  
ships — not hurting  
someone’s feelings.  

— Bertha Harris  

Women were straining to  
moderate themselves — to be  
reasonable and not to indulge in  
conflicts. The students were  
looking to the collective or to the  
faculty for leadership, and had  
not yet accepted responsibility  
for being leaders themselves  
and bringing their real feelings  
up front.  

It seemed important to some  
women to know if the collective  
members were lesbians. “They  
give off straight vibes,” one  
woman told me. “They may  
sleep with women, but they sure  
don't act like dykes.” Feeling  

protective of their members, the  
collective didn’t want to discuss  
it publicly. Eventually, we knew  
four were lesbians, one was bi-  
sexual, and two were straight. So  
what? The underlying issue of whether  
Sagaris represents the interests  
of lesbian feminists went un-  
resolved, but continued to fester.  
Class Comes  
Out of the Closet  

Since lesbianism had been  
pegged a non-issue (although  
many individuals labored over  
that particular “non-issue”  
quite a bit), class was the second  
issue out of the closet. In the  
lectures we were told that guilt  
about class is irrelevant and  
destructive. That we should look  
at how our class backgrounds  
affect us, and use the advan-  

tages that our different  
backgrounds give us. So a  
healthy examination began  

among us to understand and to  
identify with our class  
backgrounds.  

Women must have  
control over their own  
institutions; struc-  
tures that are flexible  
allow the greatest pos-  
sibility for change. Is  
Sagaris a training  
ground for feminist  
leaders? What kind of  
school does the wo-  
men’s movement  
need?  

— Charlotte Bunch  

The working class caucus was  
getting more vocal and kept  
asking for money. Emily Medvec  
arrived to teach economics and  
the politics of money became  
even more real. In one class she  
tried an ingenious experiment.  
Seventy of us were asked to  
write two items on a slip of  
paper: our annual salary total  
and our annual surplus total.  
The figures that came out were  
very revealing: $243,228.16  
salary total and $52,884.04  
surplus total. We began to  

understand how our movement  
need not depend on outside  
grants for its survival — that if  
the class privileges were really  
broken down in the movement,  
we could support our own in-  
stitutions and each other.  

Another Issue Unresolved  

At one point the Sagaris  
collective was asked how it  
represents the interests of work-  
ing class women. The collective  
pointed out that everyone who  
had applied for a scholarship had  
been given one; that they had  
tried to recruit minority and  
working class women; and that  
two members of the collective  
had working class backgrounds.  
To many of us it became clear  
that one member of the collec-  
tive identified with working class  
women. She participated active-  
ly in the working class caucus  
and formed relationships easily  
with the working class women.  
The rest was not clear at all, and  
the issue was not resolved.  

Meanwhile the six child care  
workers met with the collective  
to find a solution to being over-  
worked. They were angry that  
they were earning about $2.50  
per hour, while the faculty was  
earning $300 per week (except  
those who had voluntarily  
lowered their salaries). The  
collective was angry that they  
were being bad-mouthed behind  
their backs. The workers said  
they had been told that the  
collective didn’t want to deal  
with daycare, that they had hired  
a daycare co-ordinator from the  
community to deal with daycare  
problems. A “working solution”  
was found by hiring one more  
worker, which cut the hours  
back to 20/week, but the ques-  
tion of the pay differential  
between daycare workers and  
the faculty was never resolved.  

The Rising of the Mothers  

Actually, the mothers never  
did become very militant, except  
for a fly-by-night “Sagaris  
Mothers’ Union,” which put up  
signs urging child-free women  
to awaken and relate to the  
children. But a group, most of  
whom were mothers who had  
left their children at home, did  
insist that Sagaris provide  
daycare in the evenings and on  
Sundays, since the daycare  
program covered 9 to 6 only.  

The daycare workers were not  
about to extend their hours to  
cover a 24-hour program, and  
the collective said there was no  
more money in the budget for  
daycare. They complained that it  
cost more money to put a kid in  
daycare than for tuition for one  
student. One of them asked me if  
24-hour daycare was really  
desirable anyway; they thought  
they had discharged their obliga-  
tion by providing free childcare  
and by hiring a co-ordinator to  
deal with daycare problems.  
There are no mothers in the  
collective, so that questionable  
defense was never raised.  

The “working solution” was  
that the group was to raise  
money to pay women $2/hr. to  
babysit. A dance was held; some  
Florida women silkscreened T-  

shirts; and almost $200 was  
raised. However, after about ten  
days very few Sagaris women  
signed up to babysit, and the job  
fell mostly to a 15-year-old from  
the Lyndonville community who  
thought that $2/hour looked  
pretty good. The question of  
whether Sagaris represents the  
interests of mothers and  
children was never verbalized,  
much less resolved.  

The source of power is  

ownership and control  
of production. How  
work is organized  
(structures) deter-  
mines whose interests  
are being served.  

— Emily Medvec  

A Woman-defined Environ-  
ment?  

By the third week, many  
women were tired of the  
cafeteria food, its bustling at-  
mosphere, and the constant  
shouting of announcements  
during meals. Some felt we had  
no control over our physical  
environment, and wondered if  
the $42,000 ($300 per person)  
paid to Lyndon State College for  
room and board was really worth  
it. One woman told me she  
thought we could have created  
something better ourselves —  
building tipis, cooking com-  
munally. The collective felt there  
would have been no time in the  

class schedule for such tasks.  

One student said it was strange  
to have others doing our day-to-  
day maintenance for us —  
cleaning bathrooms, cooking  
meals, washing dishes. This  
issue also went unresolved.  

Sometime during the middle  
of the session, the Sagaris  
collective held a community  
meeting to discuss and disclose  
its own history, structure, and  
conflict. They talked of meeting  
for over two years, of the tyranny  
of structurelessness that  
besieged them in the beginning,  
of learning new skills and  
strengths.  

The Sagaris Split  

They also talked about their  
past internal conflicts. Some six  
months before, they had decided  
to ask one collective member to  
leave, and two other members  
had left with her in protest. They  
explained the differences: “We  
found out a year and a half down  

the road that we had different  
goals. They wanted something  
less structured, and less expen-  
sive. They stopped doing their  
part of the work, which sabotag-  
ed what we were trying to  
accomplish. They attacked two  
of us personally. It became clear  
that we could not continue this  
way.”  

The ousted women were not  
there to give their side of the  
story, and assuming that there  
had to be at least one other side  
to the story, I asked them about it  
when I met them in Plainfield  
some days later. Samm  
Stockwell told me, “I wouldn't  
say or do anything to hurt  
Sagaris. But it's not true that I  
wanted a structureless situa-  
tion. I was one of the originators  
of the idea of Sagaris, and  
believed structure to be impor-  
tant. My concerns were more  
with the internal workings of the  
collective and the cost of atten-  
ding. Two of the collective  
members were in New York, and  
were making contacts for  
money, and with the sponsors  
for public relations. They were  
also making decisions on who  
was being hired to teach, based  
on those contacts. Those of us  
here in Vermont were left with  
other work to do. I also think they  
could have found a cheaper  
place to hold Sagaris. It was not  
a personal attack, but a demand  
that they be accountable to all of  
us. To me it was a class issue. I  
knew the price would exclude  
many working class and minori-  
ty feminists.”  

I asked Sagaris women why  
they hadn’t confronted the  
collective with their political  
questions at the community  
meeting the evening the collec-  
tive had discussed their process.  
One woman said it was clear to  
her that students could express  
their ideas, but that they had no  
power to change the collective’s  
decisions. Another woman said  
that that evening had reminded  
her of a new mother cooing over  
her baby, “Isn't she cute?” and  
that any political questioning  
would be taken personally, as an  
attack. Others said they were  
very impressed with what these  
women had actually ac-  
complished and felt personal  
loyalty to support them. Another  
woman disagreed. She said  

I learn by going where  
I have to go.

support doesn’t mean propping  
them up — it’s not non-  
supportive to express your dis-  
agreements.  

The Questions Are Raised  

During the last week at  
Sagaris, one or two women had  
taken it upon themselves to  
write up a form, requesting  
women to pledge money to  
Sagaris. That same evening, at a  
community meeting, several  
women said that they didn’t  
know if they wanted to pledge  
money to Sagaris, since they  
didn't know what direction it  
was going to take. They wanted  
to know where the collective  
members were coming from  
politically within feminism, and  
in what way the collective felt  
accountable to the women’s  
movement. A hot discussion  
began, and the “working solu-  
tion” in this case was to submit  
written questions for the collec-  
tive to answer at a different  
meeting, since this particular  
one had been called to discuss  
socialism, and women were  
anxious to start.  

A group of about 20 faculty  
and students met to draw up the  
questions, which were given to  
the collective the day before the  
next community meeting. The  
questions asked each member to  
discuss her position politically  
within feminism and her goals  
and motivations for working at  
Sagaris; to describe the existing  
hidden and open power struc-  
tures within the collective; and  
to discuss if the collective was  
willing to share responsibility  
and power of Sagaris with  
students.  

It was Wednesday of the  
last week. Some women feared  
a huge confrontation, others had  
already left, and many were  
packing to leave. The group  
which had drawn up the  
questions met before the com-  
munity meeting to re-affirm  
their commitments to each  
other not to let the issues slide  
by again, and to try to focus on  
discussion of the political issues  
and not on personalities.  

The Walkout  

About sixty women gathered  
in a circle in the Academic  
Center. When the collective  
arrived, they distributed written  
answers to the questions, and a  
statement of goals. Two  
members read the written
