LOVER

Bertha Harris  
Daughters, Inc. 1976  
The Snowdance Queer

Lover is Bertha Harris' third pub-  
lished work of Dyke Fiction, the  
first to be published by Daughters,  
Inc. Both her earlier heroes were  
lesbians (see Catching Sara Dove and  
Confessions of Cherubino). In Lover,  
all the heroes are Dykes: Lesbian  
mothers and grandmothers and daughters  
and Pleasumters and sisters and—of  
course—Lesbian Lovers. There is some  
tension of legendary mythical lesbian  
heroes and martyrs, of lesbian  
teachers and students, ex-lovers and  
enemies. But the (grand) mothers and  
(grand)daughters hog center stage,  
except for rare occasions when lesbian  
sisters and lovers manage to steal it.  
Heterosexual characters and activities  
are purely coincidental and of minor  
significance to the plot(s).

There are no politics in the book;  
only imaginary persons.

As for fiction, Lover is certainly  
“made up" but hardly a novel. Although  
the same heroes reappear, they perform  
in episodes instead of a plot. These  
“episodes” are contradictory and often  
fail to respect chronological order.  
Most of them begin with a cryptic  
pseudo-historical biography of a  
legendary Dyke lover/martyr:

Euphrosyne of Polotsk, a twelfth  
century Dyke, from early age refused  
to leave her room. Much later, after  
many adventures, she was accused of  
immodesty and several fruitless  
attempts were made to force her to  
perform useful work. With sweet  
patience, she rode the storm. (p.178)  
These bits are usually followed by

absurd domestic scenes during which  
the mothers, daughters, sisters,  
ex-lovers swap out-  
us lies—I mean, the  
“cis WHOPPERS.” Let’s face it:  
growing up Queer in America develops  
in us a shameless, passionate appetite  
for fantasy, and an equally passionate  
hatred for Reality. (According to a  
Chinese documentary I heard about,  
the Chinese people sincerely believe  
that "there are no lesbians in  
China.") Lesbians are merely bizarre  
figments of Heterosexual Imaginations,  
aren't we?

Speaking of "bizarre figments," it’s  
a real hassle to keep these crazy-  
assed dykes "straight." The following  
crib sheet may save the prospective  
reader a lot of headaches:

Samaria and Veronica are the grand-  
mother dykes who became lovers after  
the bigamist they were both married  
to graciously died. (Note: the dyke  
purpose of heterosex is the begetting  
of dyke daughters.) Samaria mothered  
Daisy who, in turn mothered Flynn and  
the twins, Rose and Rose-Lima.  
Veronica step-mothers the twin boys,  
Bogart and Boatwright. (There being no  
dyke purpose in or provision for  
mothering sons.)

Keep your eye on Flynn—because  
Lover is really her book. You'll  
feel instant sympathy for her, be-  
cause she is the only character in  
the whole book who worries about  
“what the fuck's really going on."  
All her dyke relatives are magicians  
in love with their own illusions.

But even Flynn has her Favorite  
Fantasy. Read about the Dream of  
Flynn's adolescent heart: The Brain  
Machine. (You've seen the horror mo-  
vie, the one where the Mad Scientist  
cuts out his Brilliant Colleague's  
brain, puts it in a jar full of chem-  
icals and wires it to an immortal  
machine?) Watch her blow the Beloved  
Brain Machine off when Lydia Somer-  
leyton seduces her with timeless days  
of Orgasm and the Tallest Dyke Stor-  
ies ever told; then, fantasy-like,  
disappears.

Next to Flynn's Brain Machine and  
her Lover, my favorite part is when  
her grandmother, Samaria, who has al-  
ways ignored Flynn-the-granddaughter,  
falls in love with Flynn-the-lover  
and sensibly withdraws to the boat-  
house across the lake to grieve. I  
mean, imagine your grandmother fall-  
ing in love with you.

I never believed a word of it.

Hidden Faces Receives Grant

Women in Colorado: Hidden Faces  
was recently awarded a grant from the  
National Endowment for the Humanities.  
The funding will go toward  
completion of a large graphic exhibit  
which will document the contribution  
of women to Colorado history.

Hidden Faces will be a touring ex-  
hibit using photos, personal arti-  
facts, and text to portray Colorado  
women of all geographic regions and  
ethnic groups from pre-territorial  
days until 1920. It will focus on  
their occupations, home and family  
lives, creative pursuits, and their  
organizations. Beginning its tour  
in late spring 1977, Hidden Faces  
will visit approximately 25 Colorado  
communities.

The project is now gathering his-  
torical materials for this exhibit.  
It is in need of access to any early  
travel accounts, diaries or photos.

Funding for the project has come  
from the Colorado Centennial Bicen-  
tennial Commission, the Colorado Hu-  
manities Program, and most recently,  
the National Endowment for the Human-  
ities. However, the exhibit's actual  
construction and touring costs must  
still be met in local support. Hid-  
den Faces is sponsored by the YWCA  
of Metropolitan Denver, so all con-  
tributions are tax-deductible. Please  
contact: Hidden Faces, 1545 Tenth  
Place, Denver, CO 80202 or call  
825-7141 ext. 50.

whose kind spirit hones students, inspires friends, and  
informs the movements to which she gives so much of

would liberate us all—Black, lesbian, gay male, all  
who suffer under its madness and confusion."
