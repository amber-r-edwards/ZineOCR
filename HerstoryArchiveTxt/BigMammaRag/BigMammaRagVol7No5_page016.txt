**Reaffirming Our Feminism**

Women's lives today are constantly  
threatened by dangerous methods of  
birth control provided by drug com-  
panies whose sole concern is profit.  
Everyone has the right to safe, effec-  
tive contraceptives, regardless of  
age, income or marital status.  

Women also have the right to con-  
trol the process of birth—whether  
to birth at home or at a medical cen-  
ter, whether to use, or not use  
drugs, with the guarantee of adequate  
pre-natal and post-natal care.  

Contrary to existing laws, sex and  
sexuality are not simply for procre-  
ation. Control of our bodies also  
means the freedom of sexual expres-  
sion, or to abstain from sex if we so  
choose.  

We demand free, adequate health  
care:  

Medical attention is the right of  
all people, not just those who can  
pay the bills. Our health care needs  
currently profit huge corporations  
who have an interest in maintaining  
the ill health of people.  

Medical services should be control-  
led by health care workers and con-  
sumers with decision-making power as  
to what those services will be. Every-  
one has the right to knowledge about  
our bodies and the practice of self-  
help.  

We demand free, 24-hour daycare:  

An extensive system of daycare must  
be established so that women are not  
forced to choose between working out-  
side the home or being a full-time  
mother, or being forced, at incred-  
ible expense, to do both. Child care  
should be controlled by parents and  
children in a non-racist, non-sexist  
environment with full regard given to  
the needs and opinions of children.  
Child care should be available to  
anyone claiming its need, whether or  
not they work outside the home.  

We demand the right to the use of  
self-defense:  

Women are not free to be wherever,  
whenever, and with whomever we choose  
without the fear of violence against  
us. We have not been allowed to grow  
strong and healthy, with our develop-  
ment stifled by the socialization  
process of making us “ladies.”  

When women fight back, we are pun-  
ished for having stepped out of our  
prescribed role as helpless individu-  
als. Women have the right to use any  
means available in fighting off physi-  
cal attack, without fear of legal re-  
taliation; the right to fight the vio-  
lence of poverty without fear of im-  
prisonment; the right to fight the  
violence of role expectations without  
fear of the further violence of insti-  
tutionalization.  

To ensure safety from personal and  
institutional violence, women must  
fight offensively, as well as defen-  
sively, against any individual or  
institution encouraging that violence.  

We demand equality in the job mar-  
ket:  

All fields of employment must be  
open to women and we should have the  
opportunity to engage in work that  
is meaningful to us. There must be  
an end to sexist typecasting of jobs,  
unwritten laws of behavior, and the  
denial of our potential as produc-  
tive workers. There must also be re-  
alistic expectations as to the amount  
of work one individual is capable of  
doing and an end to the idea that a  
person is “better” than another be-  
cause of the type of work available  
to her/him.  

All workplaces must be upgraded so  
that health and safety conditions are  
safe.  

We demand the right to a guaranteed  
job or income:  

Although all people create the  
wealth of society, we are never guar-  
anteed an adequate job or income to  
ensure the well-being of ourselves  
and our families, if we have them.  
This is most true for women and  
people in minority communities. We  
are constantly victims of insecurit-  
ies of uncertain employment situa-  
tions. It is our right to have a job  
or income that gives us the ability  
to care for ourselves, with flexible  
hours and part-time work providing  
enough payment for sustenance.  

We demand free and relevant educa-  
tion:  

Education should be provided to  
everyone in our schools, communities,  
and workplaces that encourage our  
artistic, physical, intellectual and  
political capabilities. Education  
free of racism and sexism and other  
forms of indoctrination is essential  
to the practical growth of all indi-  
viduals. We demand education substi-  
tute fact for mystique and myth.  

We demand an end to sexism in the  
cultural media:  

Women are consistently stereotyped  
as sex objects to be possessed and  
helpless idiots to be patronized  
by our cultural media. The role women  
are expected to play, as produced and  
reinforced by mass media, does not  
benefit women. We must define our  
own image in our own terms and must  
not be denied the access to present  
that image as a positive role model  
for everyone.  

We demand the end to the oppression  
of lesbians:  

The oppression of lesbians is poli-  
tical and directly tied to our oppres-  
sion as women. Our present system  
sees the solidarity between women as  
one of the greatest threats to men's  
power over women and lesbianism epit-  
omizes that solidarity. The most dan-  
gerous lesbian is the woman who  
fights against all sex role defini-  
tions in her fight for a just and  
non-oppressive society.  

We demand an end to privilege based  
on race and class:  

People are constantly exploited,  
both economically and politically,  
because of their class position or  
racial background. Racism and clas-  
sism have been effective tools in  
keeping people divided. White women,  
in the movement for liberation, too,  
have used their race/class privilege  
at the expense of other women.  

**The Movement and Big Mama**  

It is racist for white women to  
constantly make analogies between  
the women's and black movements,  
for that defines the black experience  
by making it a woman's experience.  

It is classist for women to speak  
of making reforms around economic  
issues in terms of “personal fulfill-  
ment” as opposed to “survival”  
needs.  

Women must fight efforts to keep us  
apart by economic position and racism.  

We demand an end of defining people  
in terms of their relationships to  
others:  

Individuals should be treated on  
their own terms, not whether they  
are a parent, child, young, old,  
lesbian, heterosexual, single, living  
communally, etc.  

We demand the right of self-determ-  
ination of all people:  

The economic and political exploit-  
ation of women, third world and all  
people must be stopped. We demand our  
freedom as women, but not at the ex-  
pense of others. To enslave other  
people in the effort to be free is  
not worth the fight. All the demands  
of women listed here point to all  
people's right to self-determination.  

We demand the right to use any  
means necessary to eliminate male  
supremacy:  

It is clear from history (and per-  
sonal experience for some) that a  
first step in eliminating male sup-  
remacy involves the creation of an  
independent force of women. Only  
with women organized as an indepen-  
dent political force will guarantee  
that the society we envision (the  
abolishment of all forms of oppres-  
sion and exploitation, economic and  
political) no longer allow the oppres-  
sion of women.  

We must continue to work on defin-  
ing the strategies and theories to  
use to ensure the freedom of all  
people. We will not stop short of  
putting our demands in revolutionary  
terms.  

**Rag**  

Connie: The whole idea of alternative is really important to me. That's where  
I think I respond to the articles that were turned in for this issue, especi-  
ally the articles on economics. You can't present a complete alternative un-  
less it's all the way; this pussyfooting around major issues, which is the  
feeling I get from people who want the paper to be appealing to a broader aud-  
ience, is really dangerous and suicidal.  

Fran: Had BMR made that compromise back when I started reading it, it really  
would have affected who I am now. The paper really affected my growth by being  
radical.  

Judy: A lot of women in the community don't see the value of doing work for  
the paper. Instead of seeing that reporting on an action might spurn other  
women to action, they view turning in an article as only doing something for  
the group of women putting out the paper.  

Connie: The sense I get is that women have forgotten who the enemy is. It's  
good to have constructive conflict, to be talking about things and dealing  
with things, but some of it is unnecessarily divisive.  

Sue: Big Mama Rag is not the reason the women's movement is weak at this  
point. We are not the enemy because the paper is a propaganda tool instead of  
a profit-making business.  

Connie: It bothers me that women who are working towards more personal economic  
security are imposing their money ethics on the women's community—that  
something isn't valuable unless it's paid, like our work on Big Mama Rag as  
being volunteer work.  

Judy: Even more important is the power trip of women who are quote working  
for the good of the women’s community by trying to beat the men at their own  
game by working themselves up the ladder of success.  

Vicki: The message is that we are not being successful within the women's  
movement unless we are getting paid by the movement for our efforts. The  
whole idea that we are volunteers suggests that we are working for some "oth-  
er" and not for the changes we want for ourselves. The idea of not sharing  
information or skills with other women unless that effort is paid seems like  
placing yourself outside the movement.  

Sue: We make change through political action and the propagation of ideas.  
How much money are we going to make on a demonstration? Do we cancel a demon-  
stration because of minimal economic return?  

Vicki: Movement jobs also enforce isolation. I work with hundreds of people  
every day, from Ku Klux Klanners to Communists, a whole spectrum of people,  
and it's a good “reality check.” Women at work know me as a political worker  
for the women's movement and some of them are being positively affected by  
that. It's real easy to want the comfort of that isolation a movement type  
job provides.  

Sue: If work at BMR was a paid job, women at the paper would become more pos-  
sessive of their particular work area and would not be that open to new women.  

Connie: What bothers me is the idea of who we would suddenly be accountable  
to. Right now we are accountable to each other, but we would suddenly be  
accountable to whoever was the source of our funding. Whether it be other  
women in the community or a grant, there is the danger of having to dilute  
our politics to be acceptable.  

Fran: There is an idea that BMR should be able to lure all kinds of advertis-  
ers to her pages. The only way I can realistically see us doing that is to  
compromise on what we print.  

Vicki: When working on the Woman to Woman collective, we had the chance to  
talk to other bookstores who paid the women who worked. The basis of their  
decisions to carry certain books were not found in the value of the books  
as far as their statements about women, but that they were bestsellers, and  
the profits helped to pay a woman's salary. Some stores with a salaried  
staff had decided not to carry women’s newspapers and periodicals because  
they were taking a monetary loss. That may be sound business practice, but  
it certainly is bad politics.  

Connie: One of the most important things we can do is resolve things for our-  
selves on a one-to-one basis before moving into broader politics. What I find  
really lacking is interpersonal dynamics—of making commitments first of  
all to ourselves as individuals, and then working things out well with the  
women we deal with.
