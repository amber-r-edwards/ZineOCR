Union Organizing In The Shelter Movement

Susan Goding

The shelter movement has
frequently been the focus of
questioning how we can work
most effectively in the wo-
men's movement. How can we
provide for women's immediate
needs, radicalize women into

organizing

seeing their oppression as
shared by all women, and
work collectively. Boards of
Directors, funding sources
and the tendency in most of
us to be leaders and follow-
ers make this project espec-
ially open to cooptation.

The grass-roots women in
Safe House have just been
through a struggle with this.
After raising the money to
keep Safe House open, the
Board of Directors fired all
the workers and reorganized
Safe House into an extremely
hierarchical structure. (See
BMR, April 1981).

worker control at their safe
houses, the counselors at
Brandon House, Columbine Cen-
ter and the Victims Assis-
tance Program, all agencies
of Volunteers of America
(VOA), voted to form a bar-
gaining unit in March 1981.

Last October, ten counsel-
ors got together to talk
about their working condi-
tions. During that meeting,
they realized that some of
them with identical qualifi-
cations were being hired at
higher levels than others.
They talked about how paid
holidays weren't really paid
holidays since people had to
work them. They talked about
not having a voice in the de-
cisions made by the Board of
Directors.

Volunteers of America is an
organization that is part of
the Salvation Army church.
The head of VOA is Colonel
Dignam.

During their first meeting,
the counselors discussed do-
ing research into how much
money VOA has, unionizing,

or writing proposals to take

"At the second meeting,"
said Pam Bond, a counselor
at Columbine House, "ideas
were tossed around varying
from ‘let's all quit' to
striking; one time Brandon
House struck and within hours
had a pay raise. Or ‘let's go
to the Colonel and be reason-
able,' but we were all scar-
ed to do that because he does-
n't know how to be reasonable.
Then we decided to really
look into the union." The
next meeting they met with
representatives of Local 7 of
the Professional and Health
Care Employees Union. "Hook-
ing up with a union was a
good thing because our pro-
blems were immediately legit-
imized. We could have gone to
the Colonel and been nice,
but with a union they knew
what to do and how to go about
it," said Pam.

Since that time, organizing
has gone smoothly. In March,
the election was held and
the union won, 26-4 with 4
others abstaining. The nego-
tiating committee met for the
first time May 22.

Although the VOA has sent
a letter saying they do not
intend to negotiate with the
union, they probably will not
win in a hearing with the
National Labor Relations
Board. They maintain that as
a church, they do not have
to enter into negotiations
because of the rights of sep-
aration of church and state.
Precedent was set in this sit-
uation before when the nurses
at St. Anthony's Hospital,
which is a church-run hospital, won the right to organ-
ize. The NLRB ruled that
the nurses' work didn't have
anything to do with religion.

That their work was secular
and would not interfere with
the hospital's constitutional
rights.

Pam Bond, who has worked at
two other shelters besides
Columbine Center, says she
thinks that unionizing is one
way of making sure that fem-
inists can have some control
in the shelter movement. "I'm
noticing around the country
that shelter houses are start-
ing to get hierarchical, even
though they are being run by
sister feminists, and they're
a small group and with Boards
of Directors that are all wo-
men. It does vary, but

that hierarchicalizing of the
structure is happening all
over. And I'm talking about
places that started out and
intended to be flat struct-
urally and 'we're all sisters
together working on this pro-
blem.' And I think that the
reason for that is largely
funding. That the funding
sources are demanding that
kind of structure. What I saw
as a step toward that was
that people were creating
these structures, but not
really working within them,
so they were telling CETA,

START A UNION!

-LNS

for example, that this is the
boss and this is how we work
and all that, when in effect
they weren't working that way.
And then at their meetings
saying, ‘Yeah, we're telling
them that, but we all know
we're the same here, and no
one has any power over anyone
else and everyone's getting
the same amount of money and
that sort of thing. And that
was a step, and that was

too crazy to work under.

And slowly but surely they
started acting as though that
were really true, and then
having people getting differ-
ent salaries and that sort of
thing. So that's getting more
firmly ensconced now, that
these groups are getting hie-
rarchical. And what I think
is the answer to that is the
workers on the bottom organ-
izing. And when I first talk-
ed about that in Eugene (OR)
at the shelter there, every
one was really shocked. Oh,
my god, we're sisters, we're
feminists, what are you talk-
ing about. But I don't think
it's all that icky. One of
them was going to be my sup-
ervisor, and I would just as
soon have some collective
power over what was going on."
