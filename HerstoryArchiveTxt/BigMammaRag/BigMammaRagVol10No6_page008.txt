Contaminated State

Almost the entire population  
of Michigan is contaminated  
with the toxic chemical PBB,  
according to a recent report  
by the Environmental Sciences  
Laboratory of the Mt. Sinai  
School of Medicine. PBBs  
are flame-retardant chemicals  
used in various manufacturing  
processes. They are known to  
cause cancer in laboratory  
animals. In 1973, 1000 to 2000  
pounds of PBB were accidentally  
mixed with livestock feed and  
found its way to hundreds of  
farms in west-central Michi-  
gan. Some 1.5 million chickens  
and tens of thousands of other  
animals had to be destroyed  
when they started getting sick  
after about nine months. The  
poison had spread, first to  
farm workers, and then to the  
general population through  
consumption of milk, meat,  
butter, eggs, and cheese.

In 1978, two companies,  
Michigan Chemical Co. and  
Farm Bureau Services Inc.,  
pleaded no contest to charges  
implicating them in the acci-  
dent; they were fined $4000.  
The Mt. Sinai study research-  
ers examined more than 1700  
Michigan residents and found  
that 97.3% of those whose  
fatty tissues were checked  
still had PBB in their bodies.

Against Apartheid

An International Committee  
of Solidarity with the Strugg-  
le of Women in South Africa  
and Namibia has been formed  
by leading women from differ-  
ent parts of the world. The  
committee will work with the  
UN Special Committee Against  
Apartheid to educate the pu-  
blic concerning the plight of  
women under apartheid, and to  
promote political and material  
support for the women's sec-  
tions of the South African  
and Namibian Liberation Move-  
ments.

Streamline Drugs

A federal study panel en-  
dorsed Sec. of Health and Hu-  
man Services, Richard Schweiker's,  
plans to "Streamline" the  
Federal Drug Approval Process.  
This is an attempt to get fed-  
eral regulators to "stop look-  
ing at pharmaceutical compan-  
ies as the enemy." The chang-  
es make it easier for drug  
companies to hire their own  
"experts" to test drugs, and  
to also choose between the  
Food and Drug Administration  
and another nongovernmental body for a  
“review of their applications."

Life On Campus

At the University of CA  
Davis campus 300 women and  
children of all races marched,  
chanting "Out of our homes and  
into the streets. We won't be  
raped and we won't be beat!"

As the march passed "Fraterni-  
ty Row" men exposed themselves,  
urinated, and spit on the women.  
A car was driven into the  
march and they were all dis-  
missed as dykes. The position  
of the fraternity boys was  
that if women did not want to  
be raped they better not come  
around. The University of CA says  
they can't do a thing because  
the incidents don't happen on  
campus.

Routine Torture

Turkey at present is ruled  
by a military government  
which took over in a coup in  
1980. Since then, women's or-  
ganizations have been disman-  
tled and women activists have  
been jailed, harassed, or  
forced underground along with  
left-wing and trade union  
groups.

Ninety-one women political  
prisoners are on trial in  
Turkey accused of assaulting  
their male guards while on a  
hunger strike against their  
prison conditions and torture  
last summer. The women may  
also face additional charges.  
Routine treatment includes  
beatings, torture, and con-  
trol through military exerci-  
ses and discipline.

Justice Out

The three defendants in the  
Stephanie Riethmiller abduc-  
tion-deprogramming trial were  
acquitted on all charges ex-  
cept for two. The jury of 7  
women and five men failed to  
reach a decision on charges  
of abduction against Naomi  
Goss and James Roe. Goss, Roe,  
and deprogrammer Ted Patrick  
all were acquitted on charges  
of assault. Roe was found not  
guilty of sexual battery.  
Patrick was allegedly paid  
$8,000 by Stephanie's parents  
to take her from her Norwood,  
Ohio home last October, and,  
by using mind control, sway  
her away from a lesbian to  
a heterosexual lifestyle.

Off Our Bodies!

Ireland's Prime Minister  
has announced the country will  
hold a referendum to make the  
country's anti-abortion laws  
part of the national constitu-  
tion.

Stop Killer KkKops

The similarities between the  
cops and the KKK in Amerikkka  
become increasingly clearer  
with increasing public, racist  
stands. Police Chief Daryl  
Gates of the Los Angeles, CA  
force said in an interview  
that he ordered a department  
study to explore his "hunch"  
that blacks more frequently  
die from police choke-holds  
because “the veins or arteries  
do not open up as fast as they  
do in normal people." There is  
of course no study to look in-  
to the fact that more Blacks  
die of choke-holds because  
more Blacks are subjected to  
choke-holds. This is part of  
a four-year history of making  
racist remarks about Blacks,  
Latinos, and Jews.

On May 14, the LAPD ordered  
300 electric shock devices  
known as Taser Guns as part  
of its efforts to develop  
an alternative to the use of  
chokeholds. The Taser fires  
electrodes that are attached  
to fine wires. When they hit  
a suspect, they produce a  
disabling electric shock.

The effects of the shock are  
supposed to wear off.

Courting Racism

A California panel has  
urged the censuring of Super-  
ior Court Judge Charles S.  
Stevens, after the judge re-  
ferred to Hispanic women as  
“taco bells" and stated that  
women "were too emotional to  
be in court." The California  
commission on judicial performance  
reported, nonetheless that  
Stevens "runs his court pro-  
perly & efficiently."

La Migra

April 27, the Immigration &  
Naturalization Service (INS)  
raided Chicano/Mexicano neigh-  
borhoods, bars, and job sites  
in 9 cities, picking up women,  
children, and men who looked  
"Mexican." During the raids  
a Denver teenager was killed  
by a truck when he ran from  
the guns and flashlights  
trained on him by INS kkkops;  
he was a documented worker.  
According to INS figures,  
5,000 "illegals" were picked  
up in the raids, called  
Operation Jobs, “an effort  
to create jobs for U.S. citi-  
zens." According to Reagan,  
there are over 10 million peo-  
ple unemployed. People from  
all communities have demanded  
that the U.S. stop the racist  
practice of pinpointing Mex-  
icans as thieves of American  
jobs and an end to the ille-  
gal border. This is another  
example of the U.S. blaming  
people of color for the un-  
employment and hard times  
of white people rather than  
the priorities for profit of  
big business and the govern-  
ment.
