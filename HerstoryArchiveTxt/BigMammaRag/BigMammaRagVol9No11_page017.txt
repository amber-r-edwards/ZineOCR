Garment Workers Meet In Support Of 19

Reprinted from News and
Letters.

Deborah Morris

Nearly 150 women garment
workers turned out for a
meeting in San Francisco's
Chinatown on Oct. 3 to sup-
port 19 other garment work-
ers who are currently on
trial for unemployment
fraud. The women, and the
two companies they work for,
have been charged by the
Employment Development De-
partment and the District
Attorney with fraudulently
collecting partial unemploy-
ment benefits while they were
supposedly working full time.

The case against the gar-
ment workers is based on a
year's surveillance of sev-
eral shops, where the inves-
tigators took pictures of the
women going in and out.

The women maintain that
they were entitled to the
money that was collected,
that they did everything ac-
cording to the proper pro-
cedures. If the pictures
show that they went to work
early and left late it is be-
cause they had to go to the
shops and sit around and
wait for work. The fact that
they may have been in the
shop did not mean that they
were working.

These Chinese women are
only a small part of the
growing "Fourth World" with-
in the United States as the
number of non-English speak-
ing, immigrant workers con-
tinues to mount within the
large cities and the sun-
belt region. In San Francis-

co, for instance, there are
two garment districts, one
Chinese, the other Latin Am-
erican.

The garment industry in par-
ticular is built on the backs
of immigrant women workers
who are limited by language
and education to the lowest
paying jobs. On the West
Coast, immigrant women work-
ers supply the labor for
other industries such as can-
ning, electronics, farms, and
even banking to a certain
extent. The computerization
of jobs in the banking indus-
try has produced a multitude
of “unskilled" jobs which are
filled by Fourth World women
workers. During a recent
organizing drive at a large
computer center, leaflets had
to be issued in English,
Spanish, Chinese, and Tagalog.

The working conditions
faced by women workers in the
garment industry appear to
have changed little in the
past century. Women in San
Francisco's garment shops
earn between $3,000 and $6,
000 per year, and wages are
determined on a piece-rate
system. Supposedly piece-
rates are set so that workers
can produce enough items in
an hour to make at least the
minimum wage, while the real-
ity is that women often have
to work many hours overtime
in order to make even minimum
wages for a week.

The shops are operated out
of storefronts that often
lack proper heating and vent-
ilation. The lighting is
often insufficient, and fire
regulations are sometimes ig-
nored. Rarely do the women

receive health benefits,
vacation pay, or sick leave.
There has been little union
activity in this area in the
past few years, although one
of the shops in the Chinatown
case does have a union. The
union drives have tended to
focus on the large indus-
tries.

Seventy years ago immigrant
women garment workers went
on strike by the tens of
thousands and won the right
to organize their own union.

Grand Jury

seen by anyone other than the
grand jurors and the prosecu-
tor. Ultimately, with the
help of a lawyer, the groups
had their records returned,
but then, on August 11, five
members of Defensa were in-
dicted and jailed. The charg-
es were food stamp fraud. The
five have since been released
on bond.

Alberto Daniel, one of the
original members to be jailed
was a plaintiff in a suit
against Bailey County in 1978
charging civil rights viola-
tions and asking for a redis-
tricting of the county in
order to increase the elect-
oral strength of its Chicano
residents.

Martin Salazar has also
challenged local authorities
by seeking redress for police
brutality and other forms of
harassment of Chicanos. Not
surprisingly, Juanita Sando-
val and Rosa Olivarez, both
of whom were jailed, are re-
latives of Alberto Daniel.

They were helped by other
women's organizations such
as the Women's Trade Union
League. While obviously the
Chinatown meeting wasn't yet
of that magnitude, the fact
that they are reaching out to
other women's organizations
such as Union WAGE (Union
Women's Alliance to Gain E-
quality) means that we can
begin to establish important
new directions for working
women and the Women's Liber-
ation Movement for the fut-
ure.

The fifth person jailed is
Elvira Trevino. Juan Chavez
says: "I know it's harassment.
The people have been encour-
aged to fight for their
rights by these two groups.”
Welfare or food stamp
fraud is not a charge to be
taken lightly in Texas. Just
this past summer in Deaf
Smith County, just southwest
of Amarillo, a Chicana woman
pleaded guilty to welfare
fraud and took her case to the
jury. The result was that she
was sentenced to more than
sixty years in jail! Accord-
ing to Jacqueline Goeings, an
organizer and advocate at
Downtown Welfare Advocacy in
New York City, "There is no
recipient welfare fraud. Our
system was set up for fraud,
but welfare recipients do not
have the power, money, or
resources to commit fraud. Wel-
fare fraud is the name of the
game that the large corpora-
tions enjoy through loopholes
to avoid paying taxes."

Where We're At

from page 2

since most people of color are kept at a poverty level. True,
Jews must not let their own kind of oppression absolve them of
responsibility for dealing with their racism and skin privi-
lege (see letter "Zionism/Racism", page 3). However, we also
must be careful not to fall into the trap that has been set
for us. The stereotypical concept of a "Jewish banker conspir-
acy", which worked so successfully in Nazi Germany, is that
Jews control the wealth, and therefore power, and are trying
to take over the world. There is a conspiracy, not of Jews,
but of the ruling class, that keeps us divided so that we
can't see our common enemy. They pit race against race, and
trick the working class into aligning with the ruling class
against a false enemy (the Jew, in this case). This is why we
feel that our analysis of racism has to include anti-Semitism.
This month, we have changed the theme title from Racism and
Anti-Semitism to Racism only. Last month there was an absence
of a thorough look at the issue of Zionism. We saw Linnie
Jennings' article as pertaining to anti-Semitism and touching
on but not dealing thoroughly with the concept of Zionism. We

had hoped to have other articles with different viewpoints a-
round this issue this month, but it never came together. We
apologize for calling that an issue on racism and anti-Semitism,
and then not dealing with Zionism at all, or anti-Semitism
very extensively. We are trying to develop (by doing our own
homework) and generate through the paper more information and
dialogue on these issues. We do not have a developed analysis
around Zionism. The question we are struggling with is: how
to reconcile the historical necessity for a Jewish refuge
with the present realities of the Zionist movement.

It seems that on theme issues where we choose a topic to
concentrate on, we regularly find that we don't do a complete
job, or that the point of the issue as a whole is unclear--
connections we are using as basic assumptions may not come
through. So, we're going to try to make better use of the
"Where We're At" column (notice the new location) to explain
our political process, particularly in theme issues.

Thank you everyone, for your input, criticism, and responses.
