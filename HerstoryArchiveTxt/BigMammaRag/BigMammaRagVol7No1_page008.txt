Local Writer Goes to Press

Sandia

Berrigan

Gingerlox

Naiad Press, 1978

$5.50/paper, at Woman to Woman

It is rare enough in the world's
history for a woman to get her first
book published, but this year the
second local feminist does just that
and, interesting to note, both have
belonged to the same women's writ-
ing group - and next year a third
member will be published.

Most of you know Chocolate because
she has made it to print twice and
because she is well known to readers
of BMR, but Gingerlox (this is one
of her several aliases and her pen-
name) may be lesser known, though
her first novel indicates a promis-
ing future. And, in some ways, this
book reveals as much to us about
Gingerlox the writer as it does the
main characters.

The story revolves around the cen-
tral, titled character, Berrigan.
In the beginning it moves from one
episode to another, giving us only
a little insight into Berrigan's
full character and not giving us
enough flavor of the other women she
meets: Linda Framer, Syru Cox, Ma-
vis Isdyche. Actually it is dimen-
sion that is missing, a full bodied-
ness, a range of complexity. Syru,
for example, is too simple; she is
the arch-radical whose tone of
voice is monotone in its insistent
political rhetoric. Berrigan, in her
journal hints there is more of her-
but an author cannot tell us, the
character must BE what she is. Ma-
vis remains THE bull dyke. Evelyn
Berrigan's straight friend is more
modulated and is a rather trans-
itional characterization between
the women we meet early on and the
central character we meet later.

Corette is made of different

stuff. Here Gingerlox begins devel-
oping a portrait of a woman in full

bloom, and the pun on image words
helps - a clearer picture of a por-
trait artist, more visual gestures.
Corette assumes her own personality;
we are not restricted to just hav-
ing Berrigan tell us ABOUT her. Cor-
ette reveals, unveils herself - and
what there is to tell: a sensitive
woman who brings out the best in
Berrigan, for like a good lover,

she is one who can bring out the
best in us and let us grow and de-
velop in the fullest ways - this

is the gift of love that Corette
gives to Berrigan.

Unfortunately for all of us, her
life is short lived. She dies sail-
ing, “catching a free wind," dies as
she lived: vitally, dynamically. For
twenty pages, I admit to crying de-
spite myself and in spite of the
slower pace of the first part of the
novel. Deftly, Gingerlox engulfs the
readers and Berrigan in grief, in
a shared empathetic portrait of the
woman who dies, and the one who has
to go on without her. In Corette's
own words, Berrigan must transcend
her grief because "mourning is sel-
fish. It wastes the present."

It is at this point in the book
that the imagery and style, espec-
ially in the dreams and nightmares
becomes so powerful. Berrigan be-
gins working out the pain, moving
from a moribund state to become a
woman dealing with life on her own
terms. She is no longer a one dim-
ensional figure; she is a woman
who has loved and suffered and found
some meaning. Personally, I was
discouraged that Berrigan felt "Shop
Desiderata” was her long awaited
dream, for I truly wanted her to
"fly out of darkness on her own
wings." Yet, the conclusion is in
keeping with all we know about Ber-
rigan. It is in this last part of
the story that the journal is more
appropriate. In previous chapters
it often limited our perception of
the other characters; its use after
Corette's death seems absolutely

necessary to convey Berrigan's un-
speakable grief.

This book was begun in that writ-
ers' group over four years ago.
In the course of that time both
Berrigan and Gingerlox have grown
immeasurably; from what I remember
of those early drafts, there has
been a metamorphosis that reveals
the extent to which women can change
and grow in confidence and ability.
If Berrigan seems to you, as it did
to me, to be one type of book at the
beginning, and another at the end,
it is because both character and
author grow in leaps and bounds
within the covers of the book. Gin-
gerlox adds a modern hero to our
repertoire, and promises to keep bir-
thing others.

Being Fair

Fran Dav

Dear God,

Are boys really better than
girls? I know you are one but please
try to be fair. Love,

Sylvia

This letter was written by an ele-
mentary school girl and appeared in
a book, Children's Letters to God
(compiled by Marshall and Hample, New
York: Simon and Schuster, 1966). It
expresses the loss of self-esteem suf-
fered by young females in a deeply
pervasive sexist society. One key
way that girls learn to undervalue
themselves is through the books they
read. Have you examined the chil-
dren's books in school and public
libraries? Most are guilty of bla-
tant sex-role stereotyping. A few au-
thors and publishers have recognized
the problem and have begun to produce
some non-sexist books. You can find
some of these at Woman to Woman Book-
center, 2023 East Colfax (telephone:

In His Own Place

The central drama, in bodies male
on female, was that great duel between
the brain and the reproductive organs.
Women were urged to throw their weight
behind the uterus and resist the temp-
tations of the brain. Dr. Eduard
Clarke's great uterine manifesto of the
nineteenth century concluded with stan-
dling but unassailable logic that higher
education would cause women's uteruses
to atrophy.

For Her Own Good is very meaty and
condensed, but the acerbic wit of the
authors made me laugh throughout the
book. I kept cheering them on: laugh-
ing and saying, “More, more. Sock it
to them!"

The chapter titles suggest some of the
humor: “Motherhood as Pathology,"
"Microbes and the Manufacture of House-
work," and "From Masochistic Motherhood
to the Sexual Marketplace," etc.

Ehrenreich and English are not afraid
to put any expert in his misogynist
place. Following are some samples:

Psychoanalyst Erik Erikson offered
(the world) this devastating analysis...
"Mom" is a woman in whose life cycle
remnants of infantility join advanced
senility to crowd out the middle range
of mature womanhood, which thus becomes
self-absorbed and stagnant. (My insert)

Rene Spitz led a generation of psycho-
analysts in the effort to trace each
childhood disorder to a specific disor-
der in the mother, just as the bacteri-
ologists sought to trace each disease to
a specific type of microbe.

Unfortunately, Doubleday seems to be
trying to bury this radical book with
its dull, beige cover and general lack
of promotion. The title is misleading
because the book is more broad-reaching
and important than the title suggests.
And the final section of the book, the
Afterword, where the authors give us
their analysis of the current struggle
of women in America seems chopped up
and censored. I would have liked to
hear more of their analysis of the
current situation because they are able
to clarify the issues and choices
before us so well.

Being an ex-popular psychology junkie
myself (The Assertive Woman, Gestalt
Therapy etc.), I particularly enjoyed
the analysis of the relationship between
pop psychology and the feminist
movement today. This is only a small
but stimulating section of the book.

Book after book (of pop psychology)
assumes that the only way to avoid
being "stepped on" is to "put yourself
first"... The flip side of "Don't be a
victim" is "Don't rescue any other vic-
tim." The "Gestalt prayer," which found
its way onto thousands of posters,
greeting cards and coffee mugs puts it

best:

I do my thing, and you do your thing.

I am not in this world to live up to

your expectations... etc. p.274

The individualistic solutions from
the paperback self-help shelf are very
liberal because they imply that women
can make it in this system. "Just get
