FEMINIST TAPING FOR HANDICAPPED  
readers is trying to make women's  
periodicals and books available to  
handicapped readers. We tape Sinister  
Wisdom, Of Our Backs, Feminary,  
Daughters, Inc. books, and others.  

We need more money, 1 reel to reel  
high speed duplicator, 8 reel to reel  
recorders, 15 reel to reel tapes, and  
50 90 minute cassette tapes. We  
would like to make these tapes avail-  
able to handicapped readers for no  
more than the cover price of the book  
or periodical. Without your help, a  
single issue of Of Our Backs on cas-  
sette would cost around $10. Please  
send what you can to: Susan Wood-Thom-  
pson, Feminist Taping for Handicapped  
Readers, 1732 Willard St., NW #1,

LINDA McDONNELL  
two lesbian feminists  
manuscripts for a collection of  
women's poems and prose focusing on  
our experiences with incest. They are  
interested in all types of incest:  
overt, covert, same sex, different  
sex, physical, emotional. No sociolo-  
gical or political tracts or inter-  
views. Aside from those limitations  
all other forms are welcome, letters,  
short stories, poetry, journal entries  
and prose poems. We believe breaking  
silence around this taboo is both  
transformational and healing. Please  
send manuscripts to them at 2533

enclose a SASE. Deadline is Feb. 1st.
