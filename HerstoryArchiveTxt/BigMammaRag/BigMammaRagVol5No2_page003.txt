Spread the Word!

To all sisters:

It's happened again--a woman made
music, she even came from far away,
in this case, Casse Culver, and no
one in Boulder knew she was going to
be in the area. Boulder and Denver
are so close, yet there is almost no
communication between women's groups
in each, at least no consistent com-
munication. Women's culture is still
sparse, and so special, yet in my
experience in and around women's
groups in the last six years, publi-
city for events has almost always
been terrible, often nonexistent.

If we regard our growing music, the-
atre, poetry and other expressions

so precious, why do the women who
know about coming events continue to
let only a relatively few women know
about them, and usually the women

are those that frequent the few wo-
men's centers and bookstores regular-
ly? How about the hundreds and thou-
sands of other women who would real-
ly enjoy coming too if only they
knew?

Publicity is easy to do. If you
can't afford to mail a poster in
advance to all the women's centers,
services and schools in Boulder,
Denver and nearby towns, you can
take 45 minutes and call the women's
centers, bookstores, etc. (there are
7 in Boulder and I know of 6 in Den-
ver). Give them the details, asking
the person to post the information.
This way, many women will find out
and spread the word.

If you are into spending a little
more time, most local papers have a
section of daily events or coming
events (i.e. in the women's section)
where they will print for free the
event if it is non-profit. Many lo-
cal radio stations will announce com-
munity events for free if you send
a request to them. And of course,
putting up posters on bulletin boards
is one of the best ways for telling
people who don't read the paper or
listen to the radio. If anyone would
like a list of bulletin boards in
Boulder that are seen by many women,

- letters home to mama

send me a self-addressed stamped en-
velope and request--I know of at
least 30 good spots. Also, if any
women's music is coming up, espec-
ially when women are visiting to
perform, if you send me 20 posters,
I'll put them up around Boulder.
Let's start some regular communi-

cation around and in between Denver
and Boulder, between campuses and
off campuses, between members of
women's groups and nonmembers, all
over town! If you think it's a good
thing, spread the word!

NOW Now Now

Dear Sisters,

How very kind of Elsa Blum to come
to NOW to give us the benefit of her
proper radical ideas. She has all
the zeal of a Rhodesian missionary.

Yes, NOW does have an interest in
the status quo. That is where most
of us live and how we pay the rent.
It is one of the few feminist organ-
izations in Denver to welcome
straight homemakers. NOW members
who are professional women have a
handle on the power structure and
the ability to change their own cor-
ner of the world. We also have an
interest in the State Legislature
because that is where the laws are
made we all have to live by. We are
learning how the system works, how
to use it, and how to turn it around.

NOW's purpose is "to take action to
bring women into the mainstream of
American life now, exercising all
the privileges and responsibilities
thereof in truly equal partnership
with men." To achieve that purpose,
we will do anything that works. We
are the birth-givers of the 20th
century feminist movement. No one
can fault our accomplishments. We
are the largest and most powerful
feminist organization in this coun-
try. By adhering to a mainstream

philosophy, we have gained a broad
base of support and have caused
changes in the lives of many Ameri-

can women. And yet, this is only the

tip of the iceberg; there is much
more work to do. And we will not
fail.

So often NOW is expected to be what
we are not. We are simply a civil
rights organization for women. Our
goal is equality for women with men.
That is all. So please don't saddle
us with excess baggage. We have an
enormous task to do without carrying
someone else's burden too.

Rather than trying to change NOW,
might Elsa Blum's energy be better
spent trying to change the Socialist
Workers' Party? We have had success
where it has not.

For equality NOW,
Shirley Wood
