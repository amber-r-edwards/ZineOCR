Letters Home To Mama  

Sister in Prison  
Dear Big Mama,  

This is the first time I’ve  
written you, I wish I'd done it  
sooner. I think it’s about time  
I let you know what your  
support, through your paper  
has meant to me. I look  
forward to receiving my copy  
of BMR and just by reading  
about everything that goes on  
out there in this woman to  
woman world of ours is a great  
help to me. Being that I’m in  
prison here in Raleigh it’s  
good to know I have comrades  
out there who care enough to  
let me know what’s happening.  

And through your paper you  
do just that. It’s a hell of a  
world I’m living in right now  
and by you taking time to send  
me a copy of BMR makes me  
feel like I'm not really alone  
—at least not in mind. My  
body may be behind fences,  
but my mind still wanders free  
and it’s always right out there  
with all my struggling sisters.  

I’ve been here for almost 14  
months now and still have 10  
or more to go, but I'll make it  
easy enough with a little help  
from my friends.  

My sentence is 1 day to 16  
years—and if you don’t think  
that’s fucked up you're dead  
wrong. My crime (to the  
so-called public) was armed  
robbery—four counts. Sure I  
was guilty as hell, but that’s  
not what hung me, it was the  
fact that I’m a woman and I  
did a man’s job, as it was put

to me. They couldn’t stand  
the fact that I was a lone  
woman bandit. I was not  
caught in the act — but  
snitched on by none other than  
a man, in order to save his  
own neck.  

Oh yes, I enjoyed your March  
issue, on the mother losing  
her son. Well I’ve always  
wanted to adopt kids and I’ve  
wondered if I would have a lot  
of hassles being I'm a feminist  
and lesbian. Can you answer  
this for me?  

Well I want to say once again  
how thankful I am to you for  
your help and support. I'll  
close this now but only in  
words: my mind is always  
there.  

In the struggle of Life,  

Rena Parker  

We kid you not  
Just a line to let you know that  
your March 1976 issue is ab-  
solutely SUPER. I am so glad  
that you took so much effort to  
do the MIRIAM GREENSPAN  
article in depth. Anything I  
can't stand is a superficial  
treatment of a serious wom-  
an's presentation.... I enjoyed  
every word of it. Read your  
RAG from cover to cover...  
read lots of Feminist papers,  

and your work is tops.

Let’s Go To Denver  
BMR Sisters,  

Keep up the good work.  
BMR is a jewel to those of us  
here in Omaha. We're  
absolutely starved for good  
feminist literature. The issue  
I just received today is super.  
Three of us NOW women  
attended the WRAC in Den-  
ver; your articles refreshed  
and refueled us. The abortion  
articles are just superb.  

Just wish Denver was closer  
so we could attend your BMR  
fundraisers.  

The feminist community here  
in Omaha has a special love  
for Denver and all of you  
there. Maybe it’s just the  
atmosphere, but whenever our  
batteries need recharging our  
first thought is “let’s go to  
Denver.” We've used several  
articles in BMR in our NOW  
newsletter (full credit is given  
to BMR of course). And other  
articles have inspired us to do  
a little more research etc.  
which leads to more articles  
for our newsletter.  

Perhaps someday we can all  
become acquainted out in your  
lovely city and just rap about  
sisterhood.  

Yours in the Struggle,  
Sandi Skorniak  
V. Pres—Omaha NOW.  

Supreme Court  

Doris Lessing once wrote  
“one can be certain that when  
a formerly rejected movement  
or strand in society becomes  
tolerated by what fought it,  
both are about to be depth-  
charged from somewhere  
else.” On that count gay  
sisters and brothers can relax;  
toleration is not visible from  
any point and the same strand  
is still being fought.  

On Monday, March 29th,  
1976, the Supreme Court ruled  
that consenting adults can be  
criminally prosecuted for  
homosexual acts in their own  
homes. Quoting the Bible as  
his latest source for legal  
discernment, Judge Albert V.  
Bryan of Virginia said that the  
right to privacy among mar-  
ried couples regarding sexual  
matters is a principle not  
extending to persons identifying  
with the same sex. His  
overriding concern (naturally)  

is the promotion of morality  

and decency. The state of  
course need not show proof of  
moral delinquency; homosexual  
behavior of and in itself is  
conduct deemed detrimental  
to the moral fiber of the  
country.  

In legal terms the ruling  
does not necessarily mean  
witch hunts will abound. It  
just means that states have  
the right to legislate on the  
issue. Hopefully this decision  
also means that laws decrim-  
inalizing homosexuality in in-  
dividual states cannot be  
overturned by the higher  
court. So, if the gay movement  
can get laws changed through  
the legislatures, then these  
changes can’t be threatened  
by the anti-gay suits in the  
Supreme Court. In the mean-  
time, those of us who are  
actively contributing to the  
moral degeneration of this  
country had better consider  
taking up residence in Illinois,  
Connecticut, Colorado, Ore-  
gon, Hawaii, Delaware, Ohio,  
N. Dakota, S. Dakota, Wash-  
ington, California, New Mex-  
ico, Maine, or Arkansas.  
These are the states who have  
repealed, to one degree or  
another, criminal statutes on  
homosexuality, sodomy, etc.  

That’s in legal terms. There  
are other levels which hit  
closer to home for many.  
Closet doors have been batter-  
ed down, from the inside, by  

many in the past few years  
with women and men not  
caring any longer “who  
knows.” But there has been  
an equally strong if quieter  
undercurrent of gays who  
don’t care who doesn’t know.

ing an issue of sexuality, is  
making this group care. The  
mass of homosexually oriented  
people couldn't care less about  
being embroiled in public  
decrees. The Court, in doing it  
for them, is fulfilling its own  
fears.  

Most non-straights are not  
afraid of feds or fag-squads  
taking up vigil outside bed-  
room windows. That simply is  
not the point. The point is  
more one of principle — if the  
highest court in the land, in a  
country celebrating its 200th  
anniversary of “freedom for  
all” can declare some 5 to 20  
million people unhealthy, im-  
moral, or otherwise unfit what  
recourse is there? What hap-  
pens to people like Elaine  
Nobel, a Congresswoman who  
is illegal in her own state?  
What are the ramifications for  
already harassed lesbian  
mothers? What happens if this  
country falls prey to another  
McCarthy with the vendetta  
being queers instead of reds? I  
hope the answers to these and  
other questions do not come  
from the Burger Court. That  
was gay liberation’s first  
mistake — it was almost a  
foregone conclusion there  
would be a negative ruling.  
Hopefully there is a silver  
lining — no matter how bad  
things are the less the Burger  
Court has to say about state  
laws the better. To let things  
stand is better than imposing  
their reactionary standards as  
the rule.
