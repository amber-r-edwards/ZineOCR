Bourge Miller  
Flying: An Opinion

Kate Millett.

The sculptor. Who, at 35, had  
not yet had a proper exhibit.

The teacher. Whose political  
activism got her fired from her  
post at Barnard.

The Lesbian. Who, for nearly a  
decade, lived with a fellow artist  
... a man.

Kate Millett. The feminist  
scholar. Whose doctoral disser-  
tation, when thrust upon an un-  
suspecting public in book form,  
fueled the first great fires of the  
current feminist debate. The im-  
pact of Sexual Politics on society  
in general and the Women’s  
Movement in particular was un-  
paralleled.

Kate Millett had scored.

And yet, suddenly catapulted  
into the limelight, she began to  
pay a terrible price for her in-  
stant fame. Damned and  
demanded of, applauded and  
abhorred, her sexuality battered  
back and forth like a volleyball;  
Millett began a desperate  
struggle to free herself from this  
new set of contradictions, from  
this public hell. Flying, her se-  
cond book, is a journal of that  
remarkable year Kate Millett  
tried to hold onto what was left  
of her dwindling sanity. It is a gut  
level account of one woman's  
persecution and paranoia, her  
dreams and dedication.

Now, Flying is not a book easi-  
ly reviewed. It is not a book any  
sensitive person easily wants to  
do a literary number on. I would  
rather instead review a review.  
Elinor Langer’s. It appeared a  
few months back in the Forum  
section of Ms. Magazine. In it,  
Langer says “She has made  
criticism of the book’s content  
nearly impossible. Everything  

one might think of to say about it  

she has said herself. Any  
negative comment she has an-  
ticipated in her own fantasies.  
Though she says she wants to be  
seen as vulnerable, she has  
created a kind of armor: no one  
can lacerate her any more than  
she has lacerated herself.”  
Sharp Little Pencil

Thus feeling deprived of the  
traditional means of critiquing  
Flying the book, the petulant  
Langer, not to be completely  
thwarted, turned and jabbed her  
sharp little pencil into Millett the  
person. “I do not belittle her  
pain, or the psychological  
danger she was in, caught up in  
a surprise best seller and the  
premature and hideously public  
declaration of her sexuality.”  
But, several paragraphs later,  
Langer will tell us: “I find Flying  
as pitiful as I found Sexual  
Politics brilliant: a pointless,  
tangled self-revelation as the  
other was a genuine intellectual  
achievement; a grand and wily  
emotional co-optation in which  
she has taken up the imagined  
charges of past and future  
‘enemies’ and transformed them  
into self-hate.”  
In other words, Kate dear, it’s OK  
to feel pain and paranoia but  
please, please don’t embarrass  
the rest of us by telling about it.  
Which is precisely what Millett  
did. She told all.

Langer doesn’t like confes-  
sion. It’s a “messy business.” It  
is sloppy, sniveling and self-  
serving. It is so... un-literary!  
And Langer is pissed. “Confes-  
sion protects. By presenting  

‘life’, not art, we avoid criticism  
... how does one criticize the sad,  
true tragi-comic and egocentric  
material that is the heart of most  
private journals? What is the  
reader to say? Where is the op-  
portunity for discussing either  
style or values?” And Langer will  
drive this point home repeatedly,  
reminding us again and again of  
“... the absence of a genuinely  
critical tradition in the Women’s  
Movement.” As though the only  
reason for writing a book is so  
that a proper discussion of style  
may ensue. As though the values  
that really matter are somehow  
going to be made irrelevant by a  
dangling participle.

No, Flying is not a book easily  
reviewed. It was not written to  
be reviewed. It was written to be  
read, and felt and shared and  
searched. To open its cover, to  
read its pages, is to immerse  
oneself in yet another chapter of  
the female experience. A  
woman once disdainfully told  
me that Flying was the most  
neurotic thing she'd ever read.  
Well, it's neurotic alright. It is  
painful. And at moments, it is  
almost embarrassing. It is also  
exceptionally honest.

A Lot of Punches

I don't believe Millett pulled  
any punches. Langer, in her es-  
say, throws quite a few. Most of  
them, below the belt. And I sub-  
mit that the reason so many of  
us, including Langer, are un-  
comfortable with Flying is that  
we recognize all too much of  
ourselves there. This is  
dangerous. For we would still  
like to have our heroes, and we  
would still like them Steinem-  
perfect. Instead, in Flying, we  
find a blemished, yet deeply  
moving, incredibly revealing  
self-portrait of a woman's  
strengths, her shockingly  
human weaknesses.

The central issue is clear. Flying,  
more so than Sexual  
Politics, has in its own way  
stirred up an even larger con-  
troversy: between the Milletts,  
the “confessors”, who are in-  
sisting that the shame of our  
personal experience is over; and  
the Langers, who cling  
tenaciously to the stiff upper-lip  
male literary tradition.

To us Langer says, “I wish for  
her book a speedy oblivion, and  
for herself other and better  
books.”

To Ms. Langer I say: I wish  
your insensitive value system a  
speedy oblivion, and for yourself,  
no more reviews. And to those  
who haven't read Flying: This  
book is like so much else in life  
... you pays your money lady, and  
you takes your chances.

in the December 1974 issue of  
Ms. Magazine. Kate Millett’s  
reply appeared in the January  
1975 issue of Ms.)

The Woman's Eye  
Anne Tucker

Kate Sharp

A book of photographs  
dedicated solely to the works of  
women has been sorely needed  
for a good long time. And Anne  
Tucker's book, The Woman's  
Eye, is certainly a welcome addi-  
tion to any collection of either  
photography books or books con-  
cerning women.

Anne Tucker writes eloquently  
in the book's introduction on  
the subject of the many barriers  
put in the way of the woman ar-  
tist. She explains that “... there  
are many more social and  
economic barriers imposed upon  
women, which drain their  

“But then,  

energy and, through the anger  
provoked, cripple their talent.  
Economic discrimination in the  
denial of jobs, fair wages, and  
equal advancement, dis-  
courages women from working  
as artists.” She says that women  
are further discouraged from  
participating in the art world  
because women are discourag-  
ed from going into any career at  
all. She also expresses the dif-  
ficulties of trying to juggle home  
chores with time set aside for  
working creatively (a problem  
men do not have). Overall, she  
presents a most comprehensive  
analysis of the situation women  
artists find themselves in.

Tucker goes on to debate the  
existence of a distinct women’s  
art. She comes to the conclusion  
that, “It seems unlikely that  
stylistic distinctions can be  
found in the photographs of one  
sex to the exclusion of the  
other.” From here she begins  
distinguishing extreme stylistic  
differences between the works of  
the women represented in The  
Woman's Eye in order to il-  
lustrate the vast diversity within  
women’s art. Tucker portrays an  
in-depth understanding of each  
woman's uniqueness as a per-  
son and a photographer.

Anne Tucker deals with what  
she calls the “myths and ideals  
about women (which) recur in  
photography fairly frequently.”  
This part of the text is a joy to  
read because, this reviewer at  
least, has never seen any similar  
analysis anywhere in print.  
Here, Anne Tucker shines! She  
questions the old time-worn  
assumptions about the image of  
women as portrayed through  
photography. And she does so  
eloquently and with sensitivity  
to the subject.

Tucker has also written for our  
enlightenment quite interesting  
and entertaining tales of the  
lives and work of each  
photographer (to be found on the  
pages directly prior to each  
specific woman's work). Again,  
she does not let us down. We  
begin to know the  
photographers as people — and  
are thankful that Ms. Tucker  
digested her data on their lives  
so thoroughly.

So, The Woman's Eye begins  
to sound perfect. Well, it’s not  
quite. I feel that Tucker’s only  
error lies in her (mis)use of  
editor's prerogative. Had I  
attempted such an undertaking I  
think I would have certainly in-  
cluded some photographers  
whom Tucker eliminated (i.e.  
Julia Margaret Cameron, Im-  
mogen Cunningham) and  
possibly omitted certain others.  
I didn’t edit The  
Woman's Eye. So, bravo Anne  
Tucker!

A Lady's Life in  

the Rocky Mountains  
Isabella Bird  
Ballantine Books $1.25

Glenna Booth

Isabella Bird was superficially  
a part of the genre of wealthy Eu-  
ropean and English travellers  
who journeyed for their health in  
the 1800s. However, unlike  
most of her compatriots, she  
went about the world with a  
mind free of pre-conceived pre-  
judices and English superiority.

Although she initially  
travelled to relieve a spinal com-  
plaint, each of her journeys  
resulted in a book after she  
returned to England. Her careful  
eye and accurate recording of  
flora and fauna caused her to be  
the first woman elected a Fellow  

of the Royal Geographic Society.  
She was also an avid  
photographer, lugging about the  
heavy equipment of the day.

A Lady's Life in the Rocky  
Mountains is a series of letters  
which Isabella Bird wrote to her  
sister in England as she travelled  
through the very raw territory of  
Colorado in the autumn and  
winter of 1873. She was on her  
way back to England from the  
Hawaiian Islands (then  
Sandwich Islands).

The Ballantine paperback is a  
current reprint of a book which  
enjoyed popularity in its own  
day. It went through eight  
editions in the U.S. and England  
and was also published in  
French.

A Lady's Life is of particular in-  
terest to Coloradoans, for it por-  
trays the rough early life of the  
region. Written in the first per-  
son, these letters convey a very  
real sense of “being there.”  
Isabella Bird's description of an  
October snowstorm in Estes  
Park is a good example of this.

“Snow-bound for three days! I  
could not write yesterday it was  
so awful... . I never spent a more  
fearful night than two nights  
ago, alone in my cabin in the  
storm, with the roof lifting, the  
mud cracking and coming off,  
and the fine snow hissing  
through the chinks between the  
logs, while splittings and break-  
ing of dead branches... went on  
incessantly . . . I had gone to  
sleep with six blankets on, and a  
heavy sheet over my face.  
Between two and three I was  
awoke by the cabin being shifted  
from underneath by the wind,  
and the sheet was frozen to my  
lips. I put out my hands, and the  
bed was thickly covered with  
fine snow... I lay in bed freezing  
till sunrise, when some of the  
men came to see if I ‘was alive,”  
and to dig me out. They brought a  
can of hot water, which turned to  
ice before I could use it...”

Through Isabella Bird's  
letters, one can follow a rather  
unusual journey from San Fran-  
cisco to such Rocky Mountain  
areas as Estes Park, Greeley,  
Denver, Perry Park, and Clear  
Creek Canyon through the eyes  
of an inquisitive Englishwoman on  
horseback. It is an easily read,  
intriguing documentary.

Music

Denver Treated to  
Musical Awakening

Lorrie Baum

Denver was treated to a  
musical awakening on January  
4. The audience at DFU took on  
an aura of oneness as Margie  
Adams and Cris Williamson  
poured out their hearts and  
souls in song. No one knew quite  
what to expect of these two  
California feminists on tour  
through the country, but within  
moments after the concert  

15  

they were captivated and remained so  
throughout the two-hour perfor-  
mance.

Cris and Margie are a com-  
bination solo and duo act. They  
both play piano, write and sing,  
and Cris plays acoustic guitar as  
well. Original compositions  
make up the bulk of their per-  
formances. They opened and clos-  
ed the program playing together,  
with each doing about forty  
minutes of solo work in order to  
retain her individuality. This  
writer would like to have heard a  
little more of the duo, as the  
blend was delightful; and Cris  
and Margie agree they would  
like to play more songs together,  
but need more time, as they have  
only been playing together since  
August.

To categorize the music of  
these two exceedingly talented  
women would be not only dif-  
ficult, but probably unfair to  
them. It's folk and it’s jazz; it’s  
classical and it's modern; it’s  
feminist and it’s humanist. It will  
make you laugh and it will make  
you cry, but it will not make you  
hate because it has gone too far  
beyond that. .

There are love songs, there  
are songs which ask one to  
“come down off the ceiling” and  
face reality, and there is a song  
which invites one to ‘tap dance  
on the moon with me”, and  
speaks of a “world where the  
grownups want to make donuts  
without holes.” Together they  
sang a powerfully sensitive song  
of Margie’s titled ‘Beautiful  
Soul”, which Dusty Springfield  
is releasing on her newest  
album. Musically, the writing is  
very sophisticated, and  
rhythmically exciting.

If you missed hearing Margie  
and Cris you missed a thrilling  
event in women’s culture, but  
perhaps all is not lost. There now  
exists a recording company  
called Olivia, which is run and  
engineered entirely by women.  
One album has been cut already,  
by Meg Christianson, with  
assistance from several other  
women including Margie and  
Cris; and who knows — maybe  
our two friends can be per-  
suaded to put out album number  
two.
