The Songs of Aunt Molly Jackson Still Continue to Live

Stand Up/LNS

"Hungry Disgusted Blues” was writ-
ten by Aunt Molly Jackson, a nurse,
midwife, union organizer and one of
America’s best native ballad singers
and composers. Whether she was in
the coalmining country of Kentucky
where she grew up, or the slums of
New York City where she lived late
in her life, Aunt Molly chronicled
the struggles, troubles and victories
of working people whose lot she
was dedicated to improve. "I can sing
all day and all night every day
for a month," she said, “and never
sing the same song twice."

Born Mary Magdalene Garland in 1880,
Molly spent her first years on
the family farm in the Appalachian
region of Kentucky. During the de-
pression of the 1880's, her family
was forced to sell its farm and move
to town.

Molly's father, Oliver, bought a
general store and sold groceries on
credit to miners. He went broke af-
ter two years in the grocery busi-
ness because miners were unable to
pay their bills. For the rest of
his life, Oliver mined coal six days
a week, organized miners at night,
and preached on Sundays.

From the age of five, Molly accom-
panied her father to union meetings
and stood on picket lines. "My dad
was a strong union man," Molly said,
"so he taught me to be a strong union
woman." When she sang it in her song,
“I am a Union Woman," the words
went: I am a union woman/ Just as
brave as I can be./ I do not like
the bosses/ And the bosses don't like
me.

When Molly was six, her mother died,
leaving four children. Oliver
remarried within a year and had 11
children by his second wife. Molly
was able to attend school for only
three months. At the age of 14, she
married a man named Jim Stewart. By
17, she had two children. Molly then
completed a course of training
as a registered nurse and midwife and
at 18 began practice in Harlan
County, Kentucky.

In 34 years as a nurse and midwife
she delivered 884 babies—babies who
would starve and die like flies or
grow up, as Molly described it, to
live on “lentil beans and corn bread
and live in log cabins full of
cracks so big you could throw big
cats and dogs through."

Aunt Molly's own half-sister,
Sarah Oann Gunning, had a baby who
starved to death. Sarah, a composer
in her own right, wrote: I had a
blue-eyed baby/was the darling of my
heart/ but from my little darling/
her mother had to part/ While the
rich and mighty capitalists/ go dressed

Wertmuller Dissected

Lucy Quacinella/LNS

Ever since filmmaker Lina Wertmuller’s
U.S. debut in 1974, the majority of
American critics have almost
reverentially maintained that not
only is she a cinematic genius, but
also a true revolutionary spirit.

With few exceptions, “establishment
as well as alternative media and leftist
publications agree that she makes
commercially viable and artistically
valid films that don't compromise
sincere leftist political ideals. An
indicative example is Film Quarterly.
In 1974, it carried a Marxist analysis
of some of the major elements in her
work, and at the end of a review of
Everything Ready, declared that “those
who await some new revolutionary
development will claim Wertmuller as
their own."

That Wertmuller is a thoroughly pro-
fessional showwoman with an astonishing
knack for the comic as well as
the grotesque can hardly be denied.
But is all the commotion about polit-
ically conscious cinema really justified?

Consider Love and Anarchy. Despite
the quotation from Enrico Malatesta,
a 19th century anarchist, the film
has no politically revolutionary moral.
Tunin's infantile gesture (the aborted
attempt at assassination) is based on
emotion and instinct (the Fascists kill
a very dear friend) rather than on
any political response to, or analysis
of, the world around him.

The film may be sensitive to the
interaction between the personal and
the political, but the individualistic
description it gives is thoroughly
unrepresentative of the development
of political consciousness among
Italy's peasant and working classes,
recognized as one of the most advanced
in Western Europe. The film's focus on
a politically naive individual carries
the implication that the people are
unaware, unprepared and irresponsible,
hardly a revolutionary conclusion in
this case.

Swept Away takes the notion of ir-
responsibility a step further. From
the opening moment when the Milanese
industrialists are swimming and sun-
bathing, chattering about politics,
taking jabs at the right as well as
the left, the film works up to the
idea that "politics" boils down to
talk, gibberish, confused babble.

A capitalist mistress and a prole-
tarian servant find themselves on a
deserted island where, far from the
conditioning of society, the slave
becomes master and the mistress, slave.
Ostensibly, it's an allegory about
the oppression of the masses by
the ruling class; Gennarino is able
to overwhelm the helpless Raffaela
when he gets direct control of the
means of production.

But how is this newly found power
put to use? He rapes Raffaela and
kicks her around the island. And Raffaela,
on her part, becomes a willing slave.
Each reveals an inner personality
completely in contradiction with the
politics they outwardly profess. The
implication is clear: politics is jive,
deception, with each side trying to
call the other's bluff.

And although our sympathies may lie
with Gennarino when he's left flat at
the end, ripped off once again by the
ruling class, his false political
posturing and insensitivity to the
need for fundamental change are manifest
as he kicks his wife down the pier.
Since exploitation and power
relationships remain fundamentally
the same regardless of political ide-
ology—or so the film implies—it es-
sentially doesn't matter which side
of the fence you're on.

Swept Away's treatment of the class
contradictions in capitalist society
is politically ambiguous. Although
the fable runs along with classic
rhetoric about proletarians and bosses,
oppressors and the oppressed; its
twists and switches are such that one
really isn't sure where the filmmaker
herself stands in the end.

The story of Mimi—a Southern worker
who goes North, becomes radicalized
in the factory, but eventually gives
up his communist ideals under Mafia
pressure—is far from the perceptive
social commentary that most American
critics have claimed it to be. Related
only superficially to the tradition of
Italian neorealism (the post-war
movement typified in content and
aesthetics by its social commitment
and focus on the lower classes), The
Seduction of Mimi is much closer to
"commedia brillante," a style
characterized by the familiar
stereotyped image of the "terrone"
(derogatory term for Southerner).

All the basic ingredients are there:
a ridiculously narrow-minded,
hypocritical macho male is ultimately
done in by his own shortcomings.
Unlike neorealism, where dialect is
the people's natural voice, the "commedia
brillante" uses dialect to reinforce
a caricature. It's the same mechanism
at work, for example, in American
comedies where a black man is scurrying
about, rolling his eyes saying,
"Yassah, Lawdy, laysy!”

The film has been hailed as “extra-
vagantly comic, energetically grotesque,"
but Wertmuller's touch of cinematic
class adds nothing new to the genre
other than the pretense of a leftist
political analysis. For in spite of
its proletarian anti-hero, the film's
political implications are

around Bell and Martin counties to

words and music by Aunt
Molly Jackson,

To get families out by gun-toting,
I was framed up by the law.

(When any industrialist asked me, the boss said)

“Jackson, I can't work you, ma'am,
Your wife's a Russian Red.”

“Yes, I want to join the union,
I was born and bred,
And when I joined the wall,
They called me a Russian Red.”

clearly conservative. It denies the
possibility that the South can escape
the oppressive, provincial men-
tality imposed by centuries of
economic underdevelopment, the Church,
Mafia, and Christian Democrats.

Such pessimism doesn't correspond
to Italy's current political situa-
tion. Mimi in his ignorance is far
from reflecting the Southern prole-
tarians who have immigrated to the
big industrial centers and have begun
to join together with Northern work-
ers. In 1972, when the film was re-
leased in Italy, industrial contracts
had just been signed after a struggle
in which immigrant workers had played
an important role. Southerners arriving
in the North, homeless, were the
initiators of the big squatting
movements in Turin in 1968. As early
as the 1950's, they were organized
in significant numbers at Fiat and
participated in the militant strikes
of 1968. How can a film that neglects
these non-Mimis be identified as
politically conscious cinema?

"I dedicate my films to the masses"
has become almost emblematic of Wert-
muller's work in the U.S., reported
in nearly every interview. In Italy,
however, that notion has often been
challenged. According to the film
journal Cinema Nuovo, for example,
"Mimi...is the symbol of a story badly
told—or rather, told the way the
bosses want it to be."

Paese Sera, an independent left
newspaper, charged that Swept Away
seeks the "maximum commercial results
with a minimum of intellectual effort."
Such criticism—in contrast to the
overwhelming enthusiasm of America's
response—must be seen within an overall
political context.

Almost by definition, artists and
intellectuals in Italy are on the
left. The twenty years of Fascism
are often described as a period "without
culture." Most internationally known
Italian directors are associated with
leftist political organizations.
Bertolucci, Bellocchio, Antonioni,
Pasolini and Visconti have been
connected in some way with the
Italian Communist Party, either as
card-holding members or as critics
from the left.

Since the second world war when
Communist partisans “fought against
Fascism, the left has steadily gained
legitimacy in the public's opinion.
As recent electoral results attest,
the many and significantly different
shades of red in the political
spectrum no longer provoke mass
hysteria.

But in the U.S., where the act of
coming out publicly as a radical,
a Communist or a Socialist still has
the power to terrorize large segments
of the population, being "on the left"
also carries a certain mystique.
Wertmuller's work may appear politically
outrageous, ultra-committed, or
exceptionally sincere in America
where political themes are rarely di-
rectly confronted on film. But seen
in her native context, she's only one
among the many talking, writing and
filming about “the exploited masses."
Actually, in the extraordinary
realm of Italian politics, her official
political stance is not very far
to the left of center. Giacomo Man-
cini, leader of the conservative
faction of a by no means revolutionary
Socialist Party, is Lina's political
idol. The Italian Socialists
