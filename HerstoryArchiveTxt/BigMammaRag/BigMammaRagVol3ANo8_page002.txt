Offices Vandalized

Wick

A little before 6 p.m. on  
August 2nd, a member of the  
BMR Collective discovered the  
offices of BMR had been ran-  
sacked. As of this time, the  
vandal hasn't been apprehended  
or identified.

During the break-in, files, pub-  
lications, books and papers were  
scattered and thrown on the  
floor. Photographs and posters  
were pulled from the walls and  
ripped in half. Newspapers that  
were in bundles for delivery had  
ink and rubber cement thinner  
poured on them. Office equip-  
ment was damaged in a variety  
of ways; typewriters were torn  
up and filled with glue.

The woman who found the  
office was able to notify two  
other members of the Collec-  
tive, who arrived at the scene  
along with the police and photo-  
graphers from the Denver Post  
and Rocky Mountain News. The  
police asked the women present  
if they had any idea who might  
be responsible for the van-  
dalism, to which they negatively  
replied, and summoned the  
police laboratory crew to check  
for fingerprints.

About twenty minutes later,  
two more policemen arrived and  
dusted for fingerprints. Who-  
ever broke in wore cloth gloves  
as textile fibers were found on  
torn pieces of photographs, etc.

On July 19, the Denver  
Federal Women’s Program held  
a day-long program in honor of  
International Women’s Year.  
Held in the meeting rooms of the  
Denver Hilton Hotel, the  
program was attended by work-  
ing and professional women,  
many of them Federal  
employees.

The proceedings were  
keynoted by U.S. District Judge  
Sherman G. Finesilver of  
Denver. Describing his remarks  
as “rambling,” Judge Finesilver  
organized his talk loosely around  
“equality from the International  
Women’s Year theme of  
“Equality, Development,  
Peace,” and touched briefly on  
numerous topics of interest to  
women.

Ms. Genevieve Ficre,  
Representative (retired), United  
Nations Association Colorado  
Division, and Ms. Michael  
Gallegos, KHOW Radio reporter,  
spoke on the Mexico City Con-  
ference, which they had attend-  
ed.

Josie Johnson, Executive  
Assistant to the Lieutenant  
Governor of Colorado, spoke  
briefly on how women could  
become involved in politics. She  
said it was easier than most  
people believed: the key is  
involvement at local levels. Few  
people are interested in politics  
at these levels, making entry and  
being heard easier. “Be there, be  
consistent, be committed. Do not  
be caught up in faddism,” was  
her advice.

Of special interest to Federal  
employees at the program were  
the remarks of Donna Harrigan,  
District Council for the Small  
Business Administration on the  
Hatch Act and its restrictions on  
the political activities of Federal  
employees and employees of  
federally funded agencies. The  
operational point of view in this  
matter is that while such an  
employee does have a con-  

stitutional right to express  
political opinions and to work for  
the party of her choice, she does  
not have a constitutional right to  
her job. Ms. Harrigan pointed out  
that although amendments have  
been proposed to permit par-  
ticipation in political campaigns,  
these amendments have not yet  
been passed, and that her  
listeners should use caution in  
political matters. In doubtful  
cases, a decision will be made by  
the Office of the General Counsel  
as to whether or not a given  
activity is considered to be  
within the law. This decision is  
considered binding.

Dr. Estelle Ramey, Assistant  
Chairman of the Department of  
Physiology and Biophysics of  
Georgetown Medical School,  
Georgetown University, gave  
the luncheon address. A forceful  
and witty speaker, Dr. Ramey’s  
theme was women’s genetics  
and the classic male  
supremacist’s question, “Where  
are the women Michaelangelos —  
where are the women  
Leonardos?” In answer, she  
said, “Everyone in this room  
knows where they are: in the  
kitchen, in the bedroom: That's  
where they are.” As to achieve-  
ment, she said that “virtually all  
women” feel “this sense that  
somehow or other, that you  
haven't got it; no matter how  
hard you work, you can’t get it.  
That you deserve what they've  
done to you.”

On the behavior and survival  
patterns of powerless people,  
specifically women: “When the  
boss says something stupid, tells  
a terrible joke — and you, as a  
woman, laugh delightedly. Then  
spit in his coffee.”

Refuting the widely held idea  
that women’s hormones render  
them naturally non-achieving  
and inferior to men, Dr. Ramey  
told her audience that, on the  
contrary, their hormones make  
them stronger than men.

It's significant that this  
member received threatening  
calls at her residence, because  
access to her phone number  
could only be gained through the  
office itself or through wiretaps.  
Office policy precludes giving  
out gratuitous information to  
anyone, especially personal in-  
formation about BMR Collective.

Dr. Ramey’s speech was a  
consciousness-raiser that could  
hardly have been bettered, and  
her audience gave her an up-  
roarious standing ovation.

Betty Swords, cartoonist and  
Vice President of Denver N.O.W.  
used the press coverage of the  
Mexico City Conference as a  
base for her presentation on  
stereotypes, using a particularly  
offensive editorial from the  
Denver Post to illustrate her  
points: the writer of the editorial,  
in only a few words, managed to  

evoke a whole flock of  
derogatory stereotypes of  
women.

Ms. Swords is actively in-  
terested in the proceedings of  
the Scheifflin Committee in-  
vestigating the possibility of  
recinding the Colorado ERA. Her  
audience, during the question  
period after her talk, showed  
much anxiety about the  
proceedings of this committee.

“Senator Joe Scheifflin,” Ms.  
Swords explained, “has picked  
up on this idea, and the League  
of Housewives is a group of  
frightened women.”

The anti-ERAites are saying  
that there was insufficient  
debate on the ERA before it was  
passed. “Joe Scheifflin even  
said there was only 5 minutes of  
debate... before we ratified the  
Equal Rights Amendment. And  
unfortunately, there were four of  
us present when he said it who  
had been present when they  
were debating it on the floor; so  
we said, of course, that it had  
been a great deal more.”

“This is a whole new direction  
of conservative swing,” she  
said. Many of the same people  
who are anti-ERA are also anti-  
busing, anti-abortion, anti-sex  
education and anti-textbook (the  
textbook controversy). On the  
anti-ERA woman, the woman  
who is economically dependent,  
Ms. Swords said, “They have  
terrified her!” She has been  

made to think that the ERA  
would take away the nonexis-  
tent security she believes she  
has.

As questions from the  
audience continued on the  
Scheifflin Committee, Ms.  
Swords pointed out that an  
important aspect of the ERA is  
that, without it, the same kinds  
of discriminatory employment  
legislation could be passed as  
were enacted during the depres-  
sion of the thirties. When she  
asked, “Have you begun to hear,  
‘If those women would go home,  
there would be enough jobs for  
the men?’” her audience made  
an uneasy sound of assent.

Ms. Swords said that  
Scheifflin seems to have  
successfully blocked efforts to  
get any pro-ERA witnesses to  
testify before the Committee,  
“and the composition of the  
Committee itself is  
predominantly anti-ERA, so it  
looks like a pretty certain thing  
he will be spending State money  
on a foregone conclusion.”

Asked what the represen-  
tative from Tennessee, called in  
by Scheifflin to testify against  
the ERA, had to say, Ms. Swords  
said, “Oh, no place in the world  
are women more on a pedestal  
than they are here in this  
country. And, women love it and  
men like it that way. It is only the  
‘extremist libbers’ or ‘libbers  
extremist’ — I forget which way  
around — those women who are  
for it — and they are for it  
because they want to break up  
the home, and they want to  
abandon the children, and they  
hate men, and they hate women  
who stay in the home.”

Ms. Swords reiterated the  
importance of letters to the  
legislature. In connection with  
the League of Housewives, she  
pointed out that there are many  
men who are “pleased to be able  
to turn down the Equal Rights  
Amendment because a woman,  
a group of women, say it would  
be bad for them.”

Of special interest to Denver  
area women was the presenta-  
tion by Sandy Carruthers and  
Gail Martinez of Better Jobs for  
Women on non-traditional  
employment for women.  
Federally funded, this agency  
provides opportunities for  
women to engage in the skilled  
trades.

Women are not getting their  
share of the economic pie when  
they remain in the jobs  
traditionally permitted to them.  
“We are losing hard, cold cash,”  
Ms. Carruthers said, since a  
woman's pay is only 57% of a  
man’s, or more than $4,000 per  
year less on the average, in the  
same work, and with equal  
qualifications. “And the gap is  
widening instead of narrowing.”

This disparity of income  
between the sexes is accepted  
throughout the entire structure  
of American society, “from the  
grass roots to... the national  
leaders, who perpetuate the  
minority status of women.”

“There is one place it stops,  
though, and that’s the tax dollar.  
Women certainly aren't con-  
sidered inferior there.” Job  
applications, she said, should be  
as free of sex distinctions as tax  
forms, and for the same reasons.  
Better Jobs for Women is engag-  

ed in helping to correct this  
imbalance “... so that a woman  
can say, ‘I was a waitress, clerk-  
typist, maid, store clerk, making  
$2.10 an hr., earning $4,000 a  
year, but I've learned to plumb,  
build forms, lay bricks. Now I  
earn $9.00 an hour and earn  
over $16,000 a year.”

The presentation included a  
well-put-together slide show,  
run by Gail Martinez. It defined a  
better job as “a healthier  
paycheck, better benefits, more  
job responsibility and job  
respect.” This was accompanied
