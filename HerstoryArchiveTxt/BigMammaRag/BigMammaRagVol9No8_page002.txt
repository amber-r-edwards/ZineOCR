BMR Over PSC

Dear BMR,

Enclosed is a check to renew
my subscription. It's made out
in the amount equal to my uti-
lity bill for the month. I
figure BMR is at least as im-
portant as gas and electricity
and it's much more deserving.

I'm encouraged by your re-
cent changes. Keep up the good
work.

Support “Madness’

Dear "Madness" Supporter,

Madness Network News has
been publishing since 1972. It
is the oldest journal of the
mental patients' liberation
movement in North America.

The MNN staff (all of whom are
unpaid) receive and answer re-
quests for information and
help from current and former
patients, prisoners, friends
and relatives of psychiatric
inmates, social service agen-
cies, libraries, educators,
and other members of the pub-
lic. We have been able to
offer free or below-cost sub-
scriptions to people who are,
or were, incarcerated in men-
tal hospitals and prisons.

Our geographic distribution
has widened, as has our cover-
age of international news, and
the scope of events covered.
Where else can you read about
a madness festival in Denmark,
a human chain blockading the
American Psychiatric Assoc. in
San Francisco, massive anti-psy
chiatry protests in Germany,

a “runaway house” in the Neth-
erlands, the arrests of ex-in-
mate organizers in Philadel-

our main concern is raising
enough just to continue publi-

our readers have low incomes
but we urge you to send what-

Feminist Focus?

Dear Mama,

As one who has often felt
like an outsider in Denver's
“feminist community" because
I am not lesbian, and as one
who has begun to contribute
more regularly to BMR lately
because it seems less of a
lesbian separatist paper than
it seemed in the past, I'd
like to ask for clarification
about the collective's views
on BMR's "function".

The June issue featured an
article by the BMR collective,
"Illness in our community,"
that said "..as political les-
bians, we were aware of the
oppressive nature of the

health profession.." and
another, "Abortion Rights",
that began: "It has often
been questioned by the Les-
bian Rights Movement whether
or not abortion is an issue
that must concern lesbians."
I think when statements are
made in BMR that imply that
the newspaper is a lesbian
paper with lesbian staff and
lesbian readers, those of us
who are not lesbian have to
question whether this is simp-
ly a recognition of what is,
or a matter of pride and pre-
ference.

Does the collective want to

“attract staff and readership

outside the "lesbian communi-
ty"? Only those who are "about
to come out"? If you do not

think that lesbianism and fe-

minism are the same thing,
perhaps this should be stated
clearly. It's not good to pre-
tend to be something that you
aren't, but if the collective
is aspiring to be a "feminist
news journal," some explana-
tion is in order.

It took a lot of nerve for
me to submit my Lenin article
to BMR, and now I am once more
“un-nerved."

Sincerely,
Andrea

(coll. note: While it is
true that the collective
right now is lesbian, we
do not perceive our readers
or our news journal as lesbian.
While we do not want to hide
our sexuality, we also do
not think it defines BMR or
our focus as feminists. The
article on "Illness in our
Community" was a personal
statement from the collective
as lesbians; however, we are
aware that lesbians are not
the only ones aware that the
medical profession is oppre-
ssive.

Not all lesbians are femi-
nist; lesbianism does not im-
ply feminist...unfortunately.
However, lesbianism is a femi-
nist issue. The opening of the
article on abortion (see June
'81 centerfold) was meant to
question the narrow political
definition of the Lesbian/Gay
and Anti-Nuke Movements, and
was meant to be a criticism of
both.

We thank you very much for
your criticism and feedback,
and for your article (Andrea's
begins on page 22). Balancing
our feminist and lesbian con-
cerns is not easy and we are
interested in knowing how we
come across.)
