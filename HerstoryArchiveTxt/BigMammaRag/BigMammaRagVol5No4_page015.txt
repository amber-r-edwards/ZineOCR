connection with the break-in.  

"Revenge" was listed as a possible  
motive in the break-in, which is now  
on the "inactive" list.  

What does seem likely is that the  
missing BMR contact file ended up in  
the FBI's hands. According to  
Redfearn, the FBI also started per-  
sonal files on some of the paper's  
most vocal and active members.  

Several women who worked on the  
paper during that time had previously  
written for their FBI files, but have  
not yet received them. Currently  
there is an approximate 9-month wait  
between the request for and receipt of  
a file, due to a heavy backlog of  
requests.  

Since Redfearn's disclosure re-  
garding the BMR break-in, the BMR  
collective has also written to request  
its file. One of the advantages of  
obtaining several files from FBI  
surveillance of the women's community  
is that it will allow us to cross ref-  
erence the information.  

Redfearn is currently in jail  
serving a 23-year sentence for lar-  
ceny, now that he has lost his FBI  
guardian angels.  

Still unanswered is the question  
of whether the BMR break-in involved  
more than one person.  

As a result of the Redfearn dis-  
closures, a citywide group called the  
Campaign to End Political Spying is  
forming in Denver. A major purpose of  
the group is to uncover and share  
FBI file information obtained by  
groups and individuals under the Free-  
dom of Information Act, with the aim  
of determining the extent of govern-  
ment spying in the area. Participants  
at an organizational meeting included  
a variety of feminist, left, labor  
and civil liberties groups.  

Also in the planning stages is a  
suit against the FBI by the American  
Civil Liberties Union.

back late.  

The basic purpose of the library is  
to provide access to books for women  
who cannot afford to buy them. (Ev-  
ery book that is sold in the bookstore  
is available through the library.)  

It is also to keep a growing catalog  
of women's materials. The majority of  
the things women write don't wind up  
in the male-oriented public libraries,  
and, as Trudy said, "if women don't  
establish their own libraries, that  
stuff will all get forgotten."  

The library was coordinated by  
Trudy, Sue, Cara Ernst, Kathy Barriga,  
and Debbie Lester, with special thanks  
to Frances Spear for her invaluable  
services and aid.  

The library is located in the base-  
ment of the Women to Woman Feminist  
Bookcenter, 2023 East Colfax, and is  
womanspace only. It will be open for  
all women and children on an irregular  
hours basis, until more women can be  
found to staff it regularly. Hours  
will be posted in the Bookcenter.  

Any woman interested in becoming a  
library staffer should contact Trudy  
at the Center any Saturday evening  
between 5:30 and 8:00. The phone  
# is 320-5972. Donations of books  
or other Feminist literature can be  
made at the Center anytime during  
regular store hours. (Tuesday-Sat-  
urday, 10:00 am to 8:30 pm)  

A grand opening party for the library  
will be held on May 14th from noon  
until eight at the Woman to Woman Cen-  

ter. Refreshments will be provided.

supervisors some day; they were  
"company women."  

For some women, this was their  
first union job. Many women are not  
familiar with how unions work and  
wonder if they are useful. Only  
10% of all women workers in this  
country are in unions.  

Some of the union men accuse the women  
of being "freeloaders" who make the  
same salary as men, but aren't wil-  
ling to work for it (i.e. in the  
union). These same men forget that  
male workers cross the picket line  
also. About 600 men (out of 1400)  
have returned to work. To the men,  
the women are still proving themselves  
in these non-traditional jobs.  

The union has a hard fight on its  
hands. People around the country,  
by not buying Coors beer, can act on  
their moral and political feelings.  
By using the power of our pocket  
books, we can hurt Coors, where it  
counts. We will help the women and  
other workers at Coors in their  
struggle for human dignity. Fourteen  
million AFL-CIO workers are support-  
ing the boycott. Along with the  
United Farmworkers and Teamsters.  

Another way to support the striking  
workers is by putting bumper stickers  
on our cars which say BOYCOTT COORS.  
Bumper stickers are available at  
Woman to Woman Feminist Bookcenter at  
2023 E. Colfax, Denver or at RIP Book-  
store at 737 E. 17th or at the Boycott-  
Union headquarters (279-3656).  

The union has already spent $20,000  
on literature for its nationwide-  
campaign. Donations are gratefully  
accepted. Financial aid will go to  
families of workers. Send your check  
to Brewery Workers Local 366, 4510  
Indiana, Golden, Colorado 80401.

delegates will then take the Plans of  
Action to the National Conference of  
International Women's Decade in Houston,  
Texas in November, 1977. There delegates  
from all over the country will vote on  
a National Plan of Action. This will  
then be given to the President and the  
Congress.  

The media will probably give the whole  
process a lot of attention like it did  
International Women's Year. It is the  
Establishment's answer to the Women  
Problem.  

Feminists can challenge their  
answers. We can discuss and leaflet  
about questions they ignore. We can  
show the naivete of the Plans of  
Action. We can relate this conference  
to the co-optation of the women's  
movement in the past.

BMR: It's a political issue. The Pueblo  
town citizens are afraid of escapees and  
always want the hospital to press charges.  

From Page 5  

Sis: The people in Pueblo are petrified  
of people in the hospital. They shy  
away from you because they think you're  
different. They're naive and don't  
know what's going on.  

Cheryl: They're just as crazy  
outside as in here.  

Sis: I never expected to come back  
here. It has been nine months since  
they picked me up in San Francisco and  
I thought they wouldn't do it.  

BMR: What is your life like now in the  
hospital?  

Sis: Most of the day we have groups:  
reality therapy, ward groups, and dis-  

trict court group for people who came  
here through the courts. I have bowl-  
ing four times a week and I'm tired of  
it. But I like weightlifting and I jog  
a mile a day.  

I would like to get a pass so I can  
get out of this environment.  

My lawyer is sending in a motion to  
the court for a hearing so that we can  
set up a sanity (release) hearing.  
There is so much red tape. It takes  
months to go to court and you have to  
go from doctor to doctor. Even if you  
come in here voluntarily and sign your-  
self in, you might never get out. They  
can hold you for 72 hours under an EPC  
(Emergency Protective Confinement) and  
then get a court order to keep you for  
observation for 90 days. Then they can  
get continuous ones (court orders) for  
the rest of your life. You can't get  
out of here legally without their per-  
mission.  

BMR: What are you going to do when you  
get out?  

Sis: I'd like to go to law school and  
then help people get out of places like  
this. But I'm worried about a felony  
conviction on the escape charge. This  

might keep me from being a lawyer. But  

there are possibilities they will drop  
the charge to a misdemeanor.  

BMR: How long before you think you will  
get out?  

Sis: Soon.  

BMR: I've heard that it might take four  
to eight months.  

Sis: God, I hope not. It is really  
hard to play the game here. You get  
down and out. I get really angry and  
then I have to cool down and it's hard.  

Women and the Law  

From Page 10  

The conference was broken into  
fundamental categories. Friday was  
devoted, for the most part, to the  
Lesbian Law Section and the Third  
World Women's Block, with free-  
standing workshops scheduled between  
them.  
However, on Saturday, the confer-  
ence got into the core of its pur-  
pose. Four workshop periods were  
scheduled from 9:00 am to 5:30 pm,  
with an average of twenty-two meet-  
ings held concurrently. Major head-  
ings included: ERA and the Consti-  
tution, Careers, Women in Health,  
Employment Discrimination, Victim-  
ization of Women, and Economics of  
Being a Woman.  

The final day of the conference  
was open for attendance to work-  
shops again on the free-standings  
schedule.

Soccer From Page 10  

Purpose. To deny females equal access  
to athletics supported by public funds  
is to permit manipulation of governmen-  
tal power for a masculine advantage...  
The emergence of female interest in an  
active involvement in all aspects of  
our society requires abandonment of  
many historical stereotypes. Any no-  
tion that young women are so inherently  
weak, or physically inadequate that the  
state must protect them from the folly  
of participation in vigorous athletics  
is a cultural anachronism unrelated to  
reality. The Constitution does not per-  
mit the use of governmental power to  
control or limit cultural changes or to  
prescribe masculine or feminine roles."  

While Judge Matsch did uphold equal-  
ity in playing soccer, he emphasized  
that separate but equal teams would sat-  
isfy the opportunities required by the  
Constitution. Although the “separate  
but equal" doctrine was rejected in re-  
gards to racial segregation by the U.S.  
Supreme Court, Matsch reasoned that  
while racial separation was inherently  
unequal due to a stigmatizing inferior-  
ity effect for the minority race “no  
such effect is conceivable for a separ-  
ation of athletic teams by sex."  
Matsch, along with witnesses for both  
the plaintiffs and defendants, hoped  
that separate girls teams would encour-  
age girls to participate.  

The outcome of this case allows fur-  
ther female participation in competi-  
tive sports.  

The CHSAA, however, in dropping the  
sanction for soccer, seriously under-  
mines the effectiveness of Judge Matsch's  
ruling. CHSAA sanctioning means that a  
sport and its participants are bound by  
CHSAA regulations and state champion-  
ships are conducted under their direc-  
tion.  

The CHSAA, according to the Court's  
decision, would have had to either  
create a separate girl's soccer program  
or allow mixed male-female teams to  
compete. The CHSAA asserting that it  
only acts in requests from member  
schools and does not create new programs  
said that it would be contrary to the  
spirit of the association to sanction a  
girl's soccer program.  

Claiming that mixed-sex teams are too  
dangerous for girls, the CHSAA further  
refused to issue a sanction.  

While it is not necessary  
to have CHSAA sanction  
for a sports program, the CHSAA is the only  
organization to sponsor state-wide  
sports competitions. Currently, there  
are only two sports (lacrosse and rodeo)  
which operate without the association's  
sanctioning.  

It is not known what steps the schools  
will take in regards to their soccer  
programs or any other team sports, for  
that matter.  

Nurses  
From Page 6  

because of the grievance, some nurses  
have alleged that the hospital de-  
cided to "make an example" of inten-  
sive care.  

Two incidents followed in which a  
total of seven intensive care em-  
ployees were put on probation, and  
one supervisor was suspended for al-  
leged violations of hospital rules.  
One of the employees--a registered  
nurse--resigned rather than be put on  
probation. She was the first in a  
series of resignations that has re-  
sulted in a turnover of more than  
half the staff to date.  

A power struggle ensued after the  
probation announcements, a power  
struggle between the head nurses of  
intensive care and the nursing admin-  
istration over who would have ulti-  
mate authority over the unit.  

For a while it appeared that Lampe  
and Olmstead had won—that the unit  
would no longer be under the control  
of the critical care supervisor.  
Then, without warning, Lampe and  
Olmstead were fired, despite their  
wide support among staff and doctors.
