Mexico City

Conference

International Feminism:  
Vision Becomes Clearer

Carol Lease

Women from all over the  
world met in Mexico City this  
summer to talk to each other  
about their lives and their ex-  
periences as the most  
economically, socially, politically  
oppressed group in every nation  
of the world. The United Nations  
(UN) sponsored International  
Women’s Year (IWY) providing  
the chance for women to create  
the beginnings of an international  
feminist network that isn't controlled  
by any government or agency of a  
government.

Although a lot of communica-  
tion happened, often in spite of  
language barriers, most women  
felt confused and frustrated  
about IWY because of inade-  
quate or non-existent planning  
on the part of the UN or disrup-  
tions that usually made com-  
municating impossible. The UN  
never identified the Mexico City  
conferences as feminist, and the  
aspects of the two weeks that  
the UN officials controlled were  
not. It was women who came  
from all over the world, and few  
women could afford to come,  
who turned IWY in Mexico City  
into an invaluable feminist ex-  
perience.

Separate and Unequal

There were two distinct con-  
ferences happening  
simultaneously in Mexico City  
that were both sponsored by the  
UN and held at opposite ends of  
town, making them not easily  
accessible to each other. The  
official UN Conference on IWY  
had the “power” to act in any  
future capacity in the name of  
the UN. The Tribune of IWY was  
a token sounding-board for the  
thousand women who went  
to Mexico City, not as delegates  
of any government but as  
representatives of non-  
governmental groups or as in-  
dividuals.

The official conference was  
only opened to the hand-picked  
delegates of each government.  
The delegations generally spent  
their time giving long, boring  
speeches about how well-off  
women in their countries were.  
They eventually rubber-stamped  
their approval of the World Plan  
of Action (WPA), a document  
made up by UN officials months  
before the Mexico City con-  
ference that gives hints on how  
to provide peace, equality and  
development for women of the  
world: It sees women’s involve-  
ment with development and her  
direct responsibility for popula-  
tion control as essential to her  
equality. In other words, as long  
as women don't stop having so  
many babies they'll never be  
equal. In other words, women  
will never be equal until they  
stop having so many babies.

Delegates to this conference  
basically represented their  
government's position. Few  
were in any way even remotely  
connected with any aspect of  
feminism or the women's move-  
ment in their country. A signifi-  
cant exception to this is  
Elizabeth Reid who headed the  
Australian delegation. Reid con-  
sistently called for a real  
women's conference and dis-  
cussion of issues that affect  
women’s lives — not ones that  
men at the UN decided were  
relevant for the women of the  
world. Reid was politely ignored.  
The Tribune — The Real Thing

It was at the Tribune of IWY  
that was held at the other end of  
Mexico City that the real work of  
IWY happened. The Tribune had  
morning and afternoon plenary  
sessions at which UN selected  
panelists spoke. Subjects rang-  
ed from Women and Health and  
Development to Women and  
Mass Migration Movements.

Japanese feminists finally get the microphone to speak to sisters around the world  
about the anti-abortion movement and traditional tyranny that women in Japan face.

Panelists tended to represent  
the middle-class, professional  
who had little or no involvement  
with feminism or the women’s  
movement in their countries.  
This was shown over and over  
again when women from the  
same country as the panelists  
challenged what was said and  
presented another point of view.

There were periods after the  
panels for open comments from  
the audience. This was the only  
time during the Tribune that the  
six thousand women present  
were given to speak to any  
significant number of women.

The scenes at the  
microphones at these times got  
hectic more than once when the  
chairperson (yes, there were  
men on the panels) decided that  
what was being said was out-of-  
order and turned off the  
microphones. Translation ceased  
too and women were effec-  
tively stopped from talking to each  
other.

Women Denied Entrance

The official reason for the  
existence of the Tribune was so  
that non-governmental agen-  
cies could participate in IWY.  
The real reason that it was  
hurriedly set up was that UN  
organizers found out that  
thousands of women from all  
over the world planned to attend  
the official conference and  
would probably cause a lot of  
trouble and embarrassment for  
both the UN and the Mexican  
government if they were turned  
away.

There were supposedly no  
entrance requirements to the  
Tribune since there seemed to be  
lots of men with cameras and no  
press passes wandering around  
taking pictures of women and  
never bothering to attend  
sessions. But it became obvious  
to women that some women  
were being denied entrance to  
the sessions. From the first days  
of the Tribune dark-skinned,  
Spanish-speaking women were  
not allowed into the Tribune. It  
was an attempt to isolate Mex-  
ican women from other women  
at the Tribune.

Tribune officials were con-  
fronted by members of the  
International Feminist Caucus, a  
group of feminists from around  
the world who organized  
themselves to facilitate com-  
munication during the Tribune  
and become an action group  
after the Tribune. The officials  
explained that there weren't  
enough seats for Mexican  
women to attend the Tribune.

Although there had always been  
an abundance of seats at the  
sessions, the Caucus agreed  
to give up their seats for their  
Mexican sisters.

The UN didn’t want any  
further embarrassment and  
couldn't think of any more  
reasons to exclude brown-  
skinned women so the doors  
were opened to everyone. The  
Caucus, however, kept a  
representative at the door to  
make sure that the new policy  
was being properly im-  
plemented.

No Power Anywhere

The Tribune was a token  
gesture of the UN and as such  
had no power, either informally  
or formally, to implement policy,  
initiate change, or propose  
amendments to the World Plan  
of Action. The UN has historical-  
ly been impotent in the actions it  
can take in the world sphere and  
has been best at providing  
peace-keeping forces and a  
place for world nations to talk or  
yell. It did provide women with a  
place to talk and to yell. The  
plenary sessions became less  
and less well attended and the  
informal workshops that any  
woman could schedule and the  
nightly meetings of new groups  
that popped up daily became  
more and more crowded. The  
women who came used  
whatever resources they could  
to talk to others. This wasn't  
always easy since there were  
language barriers. The  
Japanese women had a par-  
ticularly hard time with  
language since the only  
language translators used were  
Spanish, French, and English.  
Meetings were long and tedious  
because of the need for ad-  
ditional translations when UN  
simultaneous translators and  
equipment weren't available.

Workshop space was limited.  
Women who were political  
prisoners in occupied Palestine  
and in Chile spoke about their  
experiences. The International  
Lesbian/Feminist Task Force  
sponsored the first public  
meetings to discuss  
lesbianism that were ever held  
in Mexico. The first lesbian  
workshop had to turn away over  
100 women because the room  
was too small, and the male  
press voyeurs refused to leave  
after the audience asked them to  
go.  
Nightly meetings of inter-  
national task-forces, caucuses,  
and special-interest groups  
were held all over the city since  
there was no place to meet after  
the Tribune closed its doors.

An official 8-page newspaper  
was published daily. It isn't clear  
who controlled its editorial  
policy that supported only events  
at the official conference across  
town and tended to ignore what  
women were doing in  
workshops on a person-to-  
person level.

In the basement of the medical  
center where the Tribune was  
held anyone could and did set up  
a booth. International Planned  
Parenthood, who helped to  
finance IWY at Mexico City along  
with the Ford Foundation,  
reminded women of their  
responsibility to curb the popula-  
tion of the world. Bookstores  
sold books and religious groups  
sold God. Socialist countries had  
huge color posters showing  
women alongside men, working  
in the factory and day care  
centers, and being married in  
white lace gowns. Some United  
States men had a “Pro-Feminist  
Males” booth.  
International Feminist Caucus

The Tribune was never  
presented as a feminist event  
but many women who attended  
it wanted a feminist con-  
sciousness in the Tribune and so  
put it there themselves. Many  
groups that formed at IWY  
intend to remain intact through  
international mails and to meet  
again at the International  
Tribunal on Crimes Against  
Women that is being held in  
Europe in November. (See story  
in this issue.) Feminists from the  
International Feminist Caucus  
have the beginnings of a  
network of communication  
among members. The Caucus  
functioned on the feminist prin-  
ciple of consensus and dealt  
with issues through a number of  
actions and solutions.

For example, it allowed  
women to take varying degrees  
of militancy when confronting  
the Tribune on its policy of  
excluding Mexican women. A  
goal of the Caucus was to “do it  
united,” according to one Mex-  
ican feminist involved in the  
Caucus. “We want women all  
over the world to see feminism  
not as a white, middle-class  
action but as it really is, working  
in the real interests of all women  
not in the interests of men —  
whether they're socialist men or  
capitalist men or communist  
men.

“We hope that feminism will  
act as a unifying strength to use  
as a tool to unite — we don't  
want to see women break by  
continents.”  
When Push Comes To Shove

The Caucus, composed  
basically of working-class  
women, and the Coalition of  
Women’s Groups, composed of  
professional women usually  
associated with women’s  
groups around the world, worked  
together on amendments to  
the World Plan of Action. They  
concluded that the plan left Latin  
America as it always has been,  
that it is not really in the  
interests of women, and that  
there was no allocation in the  
plan for a budget or a staff so that  
the plan could be implemented.

None of the many  
amendments to the plan were  
even allowed to be presented to  
the UN for consideration.

The Caucus also protested the  
election of a man, Mexican  
Attorney-General Pedro Ojeda,  
as the president of IWY but  
couldn't get the support of some  
of the most vocal and disruptive  
groups at the conference — the  
protest was one of principle but  
the Anti-imperialist women  
don't identify as feminists and  
don’t see men, as a group and as  
the makers of political,  
economic, and social policy as  
the oppressors of women as a  
group.

The Anti-Imperialist group  
was dominated by white,  
English-speaking U.S. women  
who are living in Mexico. Accor-  
ding to one woman the freedom  
of women can only be obtained  
after the socialist revolution and  
it is the socialist revolution that  
feminism should be directing all  
of its energy towards. Women  
are oppressed, she believes,  
because there is no socialist  
state and because capitalism  
created the oppression of  
women.

Meetings of the Anti-  
Imperialist group were con-  
ducted using imperialist  
methods. The chair was always  
a white, U.S. woman who spoke  
only in English and ignored  
comments and suggestions from  
third world women who were  
present. It reminded me of the  
male-dominated meetings of the  
late sixties anti-Vietnam war  
days.  
Although their consciousness  
are far apart, the Anti-Imperialist  
women and the official  
representative of U.S. women’s  
liberation, Betty Friedan, are as  
detached from feminism and the  
needs of women in the world  
and in the U.S. as the UN is.

It was very embarrassing to  
listen to Friedan who began the  
conference by apologizing to  
men for having a women's  
conference and then advocated  
a march on the official con-  
ference even after Mexican  
women told her that marchers  
get shot in Mexico and that such  
a demonstration would only  
make it hard on the Mexican  
women after all the delegates  
and foreigners went home. Friedan  
takes herself too seriously. She  
is a typewriter women's  
liberationist and she should  
write a new book and give the  
profits to feminism.

Conclusion

IWY was hard. Meeting  
women who, just weeks before,  
had been tortured as political  
prisoners; who had been exiled  
and imprisoned for organizing  
starving miners; who would not  
live to be old because of the  
political struggles they are  
caught up in, made us realize  
how empty and futile words can  
often be. The struggle for simple  
dignity for all women will be long  
and hard and we've only begun.
