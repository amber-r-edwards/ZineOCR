LUCY PARSONS,

AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY

Carolyn Ashbaugh

"When women take hold of a great
and crying evil, you may expect
revolution--not necessarily a re-
volution of blood and destruction,
yet not necessarily one of peace."

These are the words of Lucy
Parsons, addressing a crowded hall
in Cincinnati in 1886. In the
same lecture she denounced the
factories of modern civilization
as great slaughterhouses where
children went to die, inch by inch.
"The capitalists," she said, "grind
little children's bones into gold.”

Lucy Parsons was a woman, black,
and working class--three reasons
people are often excluded from
history books. However, she was a
recognized leader of Chicago's
working class movement in the late
1880s; her life expressed the
anger of the poor, the workers,
the unemployed, women and minori-
ties. Until she died at the age
of 89 in 1942, her life's energy
went to freeing the working class
from capitalism.

In this biography, Carolyn
Ashbaugh has done a remarkable job
of "uncovering" the life and pol-
itical career of Lucy Parsons. The
forces of "law and order" seized
all her papers, letters and photo-
graphs at the time of her death,
never to be seen again. Carolyn
offers the explanation that the
Chicago Police, the Chicago Red
Squad, and the FBI feared even a
dead Lucy Parsons.

It is even more remarkable that
Carolyn is the first to have under-
taken the task of piecing together
Lucy Parsons’ life, considering
Lucy was one of the central figures
in the Haymarket Police Riot of
1886, and was once labeled "more
dangerous than a thousand rioters"
by the Chicago police.

In the preface to the book, Car-
olyn complains that feminists who
have forgotten the radical working
class roots of the feminist move-
ment have overlooked Lucy Parsons.
She further states that the Left
view of Lucy has been one of the
“devoted assistant" to her mar-

MY MOTHER THE MAIL CARRIER

MI M LA CARTERA

"This is my mother, Mariana, in
her mail-carrier uniform. Isn't
she tall and wonderful? I am Lupita.
Here I am being funny in her hat.
I'm not tall, but I'm wonderful."

“Esta es mi mama, Mariana, lle-
vando su uniforme de cartero. ¿Se
ve alta y maravillosa? Esta soy yo,
Lupita, haciéndome la chistosa, con
el sombrero de mama. No soy alta,
pero sí soy maravillosa."

Thus begins the story of Lupita
and Mariana. This bilingual book
tells of their life together in the
city. Lupita attends nursery school
while Mariana delivers her mail.
Their life is simple and very happy.
Child and mother are very much a
part of each other's world.

The drawings by Lady McCrady help
to convey the warmth of the text.
The colors used are olive for peo-
ple's skins and yellow, bright
bright yellow. Mariana loves bright
colors and baubles, a taste that is
shared by Lupita. The drawings are
often very funny, with Lupita’s cats
chasing after her canaries, and
Lupita almost always on street
skates.

Lupita tells her story about her
mother's job, wishing that she could
help her mother with her wagon. The
book touches upon some of the has-
sles that Mariana encounters on her
route: biting dogs, ignorantly
sexist comments about her capabil-
ities as a mail carrier ("You're
taking a man's job away, lady, can't
you see that?") and the burden of
having to be polite to those jerks.
Lupita talks about some of the
men in her mother's life. On one
occasion, she helps her mother to
fix tamales for a guest, who praises
the cooking and continues by saying
a woman's place is in the home.
Mariana, of course, disagrees. The
guest leaves very soon after finish-
ing dessert. José is a friend that
both mother and daughter like. He
is non-sexist enough to agree that
Lupita can be a jockey if she wants
to be.

The book is translated into Span-
ish alongside the English text.
This reviewer knows no Spanish, but
picked up a few phrases from the
text (Adelante can be used for “right
on"). I make no pretense of knowing
what children like. The book is
non-sexist. I liked the story and
the artwork. I would buy it for my-
self.

seven miles to the Chicago Loop
from her home, selling pamphlets
and talking with people. If there
was a demonstration or picket line,
Lucy was there.

Lucy Parsons had initiated, or
was a central figure, in a number
of movement papers: The Alarm, The
Liberator, and Freedom. She wrote
on labor history, armed struggle,
women and marriage, rape, and di-
vorce.

On prostitution, she said, "Will
you dare to state that any of
those lost sisters you speak of
enjoy going to bed with ten and
twenty miserable men in one night
and having their insides burn like
they were branded? So long as you
preserve this system and its
ethics, your jails will be full of
women and men who choose life to
death, and who take life as you
force them to take it, through
crime."

Lucy Parsons had praise for re-
volutionaries in other countries
and for her sisters in Russia.
When a peasant woman assassinated
the murderous general Sakharoff,
Lucy cheered: "General Sakharoff
has met the fate all despots
should meet. He has been assass-
inated by a woman."

Cytherea's Breath by Sarah
Aldridge is, to my knowledge, the
first newly written historical
novel to be published by a
feminist press. It is both a love
story and a socio/political study
of life in America in the first
decade of the 1900s. The plot is
concerned with the professional
struggles of a young doctor, Emma,
and her personal relationship with
her friend and lover, Margaret.

Cytherea's Breath chronicles pre-
suffrage America as a society of
vast contradictions between the
ideal of "freedom for all" and the
horrible lack of it; between the
mobility and comforts of the rich
and the extreme poverty and degra-
dation of the poor. The stifling
life of Baltimore society ladies
who often can "buy" illegal birth
control is dramatically contrasted
with the wretched lives of women
forced to bear one unwanted baby
after another. Sarah Aldridge's
women reflect the political schisms
of middle and upper class women
of the time; whether to work
as reformists concerned with pov-
erty conditions, or as suffragists
who would alter societal conditions
after gaining the vote.

For all their personal power,
these women have very little polit-
ical clout. As a doctor working to
alleviate the suffering of poor
women, Emma is hindered by legal re-
alities and societal attitudes which

Many socialists had strong dis-
agreements with Lucy around her
advocacy of armed struggle. Matthew
Jones thought she was too violent.
Lucy, however, never retreated
from talking about violent revol-
ution; “all the oppression she
suffered for her dark skin and
her womanhood went into the anger
with which she encouraged the use
of dynamite.”

"The voice of dynamite is the
voice of force, the only voice
which tyranny has been able to
understand. It takes no great
rummage through musty pages of
history to demonstrate this fact."

Many feminists would take issue
today with Lucy's belief that all
social ills stemmed from economic
oppression. She believed that the
abolition of capitalism would au-
tomatically produce racial and
sexual equality. The author, her-
self, states this belief was err-
oneous, that Lucy did not see that
racism and sexism have histories
and existences independent of the
economic structure of society.
However, Lucy was always the first
to raise questions dealing with
race and sex.

At the founding convention of
the International Workers of the
World (IWW) in 1905, when the ques-
tion of dues came up, Lucy spoke
on behalf of the women textile
workers of Rhode Island, who made
only $3.60 a week. She wanted
assurance they could afford to
join the I.W.W.

"They are the class we want.
This organization is for the pur-
pose of helping all, and certainly
it is the women in the textile
mills who are the lowest paid...

make it so that the women who get
such poor pay should not be as-
sessed as much as the men who get
higher pays."

Carolyn Ashbaugh has done an
excellent job of research; she not
only fully outlines the political
career of Lucy Parsons, but pro-
vides the thorough framework from
