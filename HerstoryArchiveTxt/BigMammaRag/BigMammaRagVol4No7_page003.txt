LOUISVILLE WOMEN

Dear Big Mama Rag,

As always, when I read your journal
it inspires me to write, to read, and
to continue to vocalize, to colonize,
love and energize with my sisters. I
am a member of Louisville's Lesbian
Feminist Union. We are seeing the
results of long months of energy and
effort, of disappointments, and pol-
itical differences, of candle vigils
and letters and visits to Jill (Ray-
mond), and of our own sister's effor-
ts as a lawyer to get her out and
keep her safe, of failure to convince
a local station about the represen-
tation of the Lesbian in the media,
of victory in keeping the pink-clad
Schefly out of Kentucky's earlier
ERA victory, of benefits and final
money to obtain a house we are sup-
porting for our meetings and shelter
and classes for women, of those tal-
ents called music from our River City
Womin who have given us hours of joy
and dancing and are still evolving to
be better and better and will tour
this next month, of our softball team
called the Matriarchs, of our meetings
and long bent backs over paper legal
hassles and rules to keep us organ-
ized, of pain when a sister and a
sister separate, and a new sister
takes her place with understanding
and it all works out. We have an in-
credible photo journey of these last
months from every activity capturing
all transition and all love; hope-
fully will gift ourselves with a book
of them soon. We have a poetry col-
lective and a first published book
called Free Our Sisters, and silk-
screened T-shirts bearing a woman in
chains breaking free...We have it,
sisters. Please visit and write or
come to live with us. We won't all
have the same faces...some leaving
for the summer, some for always, many
of fifty members will be here and
more... individually evolving, collec-
tively evolving...women loving women.
Good Energy and Love.

RED ROCKS CENTER

Dear Collective:

We were excited to see the newspaper
insert on Resources for Denver area
women, but were dismayed to see that
the CCD-RR Women's Resource Center
was not included.

The Women's Center has been in oper-
ation on this campus since May, 1975,
serving over one thousand men and wo-
men in the Denver Metro area. We
have recently completed a three-week
workshop on Career Exploration for
Women in Non-Traditional Jobs.

Our Brown Bag Lunch Programs are
held each week on campus and have
been an important campus resource for
women and the community.

I am enclosing our most recent news-
letter and a copy of our brochure. I
hope you will include us in any fur-
ther resource material from BMR.

Sincerely,
Josie Heath
Coordinator,
CCD-RR Women's
Resource Center

Editor's Note: We knew we'd end up
missing somebody. Sorry it had to be
you. Thanks for correcting our om-
mission and thanks for your interest
in BMR.

P&M?

Dear Big Mama Rag,

Inspired by the story of those cou-
rageous women from Philadelphia who
dared to come out of the closet about
their practice of feminist S&M, I de-
cided I can now come out in print as
an animal lover. Yes, me and Kila X*
have had a P&M (Pet-Master) relation-
ship for some time now. I believe
that our relationship is a valuable
political example in our overcoming
of species prejudice and human supre-
macy. Since there will always be
those who will ask, "But what do they
do?" here is an example:

Foreplay or "Petting" Stage:

Kila X sprawls sensuously on the
bed, paws a-dangle, leaving her soft,
white chest fur open and exposed in
ultimate trust. Her eyes, half-open,

glint goldenly with that “come on"
expression I know so well. I begin
teasing her with a small red rubber
ball and, as she bats at it, I yank
it out of her reach. As our excite-
ment mounts, my nose starts to per-
spire and Kila X's whiskers begin to
quiver in abandonment. When we are
both excited, I begin to stroke her
from neckbone to tailtip, slowly,
circling around the base of her ears,
until, with an ear-splitting yowl,
she races across the room, up the cur-
tains, and back again, does a double
back flip and collapses on the rug
like a small, damp, throbbing black
dishrag. Then we switch roles.

Admittedly, this is not easy. We
are still in process, not products of
the purr-fect post-revolutionary soc-
iety. I have not yet reached the pla-
ce where pain and pleasure comingle.
It still hurts when Kila X scratches
me on the neck. However, we believe
our differences are cultural and soc-
ialized, not biological, and can be
overcome in the process of political
struggle. That is why it is so earth-
shakingly important for other femin-
ists to get in touch with their own
P and M feelings.

We are also working on monogamy. We
have decided to open up our relation-
ship. About a year ago, we included
another human, and are now interviewing
potential cats. There is one tabby we
both especially like, but all she will
say when we try to discuss our points
of unity is “Mao". Therefore, we think
that she is sectarian and possibly
tight-assed.

Others have dealt with monogamy
differently. One well-read and radica-
l sheepdog has had a primary relation-
ship with her P (Person) for almost
two years now. Others have come and
gone, but the primary P and M relat-
ionship has remained secure over the
years.

I hope that our decision to come
out will have as wide-ranging repur-
cussions in the national feminist
community as Barb Lipschutz' piece.
Already, we understand, five major
feminist papers have been furiously
debating our position and will come

Big Mama Rag Vol.4 No.7

out with positions of their own in
next month's issues. We realize we
may lose some friends in our own
community. After all, we can now be
placed squarely to the rear of the
"If it feels good, do it" school.
However, we feel it is worth the risk
if it will help all those dog-kissers,
cat-strokers, and guppy breeders ac-
ross the nation feel a little freer
in their expression of feelings.

In sisterhood and struggle,

Kila X and Kim Womantree
* Kila X is her freedom name. She
used to be known as Kim's cat.

THERAPY CON™

Dear Big Mama Rag People:

Regrettably, I have decided to can-
cel my subscription to Big Mama Rag.
I say "regrettably", because I grea-
tly enjoyed Big Mama, until a few
months ago. I had found Big Mama to
be very energizing and uplifting. But
I had noticed that this journal seem-
ed to be getting more contemptuous of
other women and less caring. Also,
you sometimes don't seem to recognize
that we all go through a process of
growing and developing, each at our
own pace - and that every stage of
that process is necessary, before we
can go on.

The April issue (1976), with the
deplorably one-sided coverage of the
Feminist Therapy Conference, finally
confirmed this for me.

What I would really like to see is
a request by Big Mama Rag--to the Wo-
men's Institute of Alternative Psycho-
