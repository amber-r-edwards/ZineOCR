Ginny Berson and Meg Christian of  
Olivia Records were in town the weekend of May 22. During that time,  
Meg gave a concert for an enthusiastic crowd of women in the Unitarian  
Church. Sunday afternoon, they conducted a workshop on the Politics of  
Music in Woman to Woman Center. The following interview contains excerpts  
from that workshop along with the interview they granted over Sunday  
breakfast.

BMR: Will you go into just a little  
bit of the philosophy of Olivia and  
the background?

Ginny: Olivia started out of two  
needs, well, actually out of one  
need—“power.” We started basically  
with the idea in mind that we were  
going to do something that had to do  
with money. We feel real strongly  
the need for an economy that supports  
women, a totally separate women’s e-  
conomy, that takes care of all our  
survival needs—not only our records  
and our books, but our food, and our  
clothing and our housing, and every-  
thing. Because we feel that separa-  
tism—economic, political, cultural,  
all kinds of separatism—is a real  
important part of gaining power for  
women. We feel that is especially  
true in terms of money.

What I'm talking about specifically  
in terms of Olivia—alright, I'm  
talking about basically separating  
women from men. Men have power; wom-  
en do not have power. Women are go-  
ing to get power by withdrawing all  
the support that they put into the  
male system, pulling it out and put-  
ting it all into women and building  
institutions and whatever it takes  
to meet our own needs.

So we started out thinking that we  
were putting tremendous amounts of  
time and energy into these stupid  
jobs that we had, that we had to  
have because we have rent to pay,  
you know. Also, we knew that as  
true as that was for us it was even  
more true for women with less priv-  
ilege. The women with the least a-  
mount of privilege were least likely  
to have the time and energy to put  
into feminism or lesbianism. And  
that it wasn't even an option for a  
lot of women who couldn't get a job,  
had six kids, what is she going to  
do, what are the chances that she is  
going to leave her husband? So we  
started Olivia with that in mind,  
with the idea in mind of giving jobs  
to women, to start giving them al-  
ternatives and to start withdrawing  
that support from the male economic  
system.

Considerably later, about three  
months later, we got the idea to do  
records. We did that because we  
knew that, whatever it was, we want-  
ed this business to be something  
that would reach a lot of women, so  
we knew that it wasn't going to be  
a restaurant, for example. Some of  
us had done newspapers before, and  
didn't want to do that again. We  
also knew that we wanted it to be  
something that would be useful to  
women, so that we knew it wasn't  
going to be, you know, dishes with  
Ms on them or something, cigarette  
cases or whatever. We ended up with  
records because, actually it was  
by a quirk although we might have  
arrived at it anyhow.

We knew how Meg's music was affect-  
ing women, she was working in night-  
clubs at the time and it was obvious  
that women were having their minds  
blown by the stuff she was doing,  
but we didn't make the connection  
until Chris Williamson came to town  
and we did a radio interview with  
her. We asked her why she didn't  
have a record contract or what was  
going on and she said you ought to  
start a woman's record company.  
Truly light bulbs went off in our  
heads. We did, and that's why we  
got started.

BMR: Meg, you were talking a little  
bit at the concert about the trials  
of playing in nightclubs and trying  
also to get your political message  
across, and you apparently, from  
what Ginny just said, were singing  
in clubs until you were working  
with Olivia?

MEG: Well, actually, I stopped  
working in clubs a little bit be-  
fore I started working with Olivia.  
They were really not the same deci-  
sion at the same time. I was work-  
ing with Ginny and she was helping  
me get gigs doing concerts of—we  
were calling it women’s music be-  
cause we didn't know what else to  
call it. We were trying to get more  
and more opportunities to play for  
women.

The more I did that, the less re-  
alistic or bearable it seemed to  
stay in nightclubs, because al-  
though I was reaching women who  
hadn't, who wouldn't come to the  
women's center in Washington—it was  
such a drain on my friends who had  
to come to that nightclub and put  
out all this money and sit there  
and behave, surrounded by all these  
straight men who were not getting  
what was going on at all and very  
frequently get very drunk and make  
real cute comments about the situa-  
tion. I mean, it was just gross.  
So I just decided to take the  
plunge, get out of it, and put all  
my musical energies into concerts  
for women. Trying to do that, tak-  
ing the risk of doing that, and the  
response to that decision, the num-  
ber of women who—I mean it was real  
clear we made the right choice and  
that there were hundreds and hundreds  
of women who were finding that music  
just incredibly meaningful to them.  
That was certainly a consideration  
when we were trying to think of what  
to do with Olivia, of seeing the  
growing numbers of women who were  
responding to the music.

BMR: What part do you feel women's  
culture plays in feminist revolu-  
tion?

Meg: I think that the culture part  
of our revolution is absolutely es-  
sential. Especially, (I can comment  
on the music part) I think that mus-  
ic does have the power to communi-  
cate feelings, thoughts, and mess-  
ages in a way that no other form of  
communication can. I've seen music  
reach and move women where nothing  
else would.

This is one reason why we started  
Olivia, because we felt it was real  
important to get that music out to  
those women who weren't already a  
part of the women's community. Be-  
cause we're not going to have the  
strength or the power to make any  
real changes until we have more wo-  
men joining us. That is a real im-  
portant point because I think that  
my music is for women. It comes out  
of my space as a woman and I make it  
for women. It had nothing to do with  
men. I have no interest in trying to  
reach men with my music. I think  
that it's very, very important for  
women to have their own space where  
they can get together away from the  
oppressor and experience our own  
kinds of emotional, political, and  
intellectual bonds, without having  
to hassle with men again and again.  
That brings up the whole question  
of when do you insist on that space  
which is just for women, versus when  
you try to do outreach to bring in  
women who are not yet part of the  
community and might be either very  
threatened by the thought of going  
to a women-only situation, which  
many women are, or if they think  
it's irrelevant. And this is another  
thing that we've run up against. A  
lot of women who have not been  
really involved in feminist politics  
sometimes tend to think that if it's  
for women only it doesn't have some  
kind of validity, that it's not as  
important because it doesn't have  
male participation. So it's always  
a dilemma for me to try to figure  
out when it's the time to do an out-  
reach situation—in which I will do  
an open concert and bring in those  
women who, hopefully, will exper-  
ience that incredible sensation of  
being together with all those women,  
and come back the next time to an  
all-women concert—versus the need  
to come in and create a space where  
women can be together without men  
and experience this music which is  
our lives, and which, as I said be-  
fore, to me has nothing to do with  
men.

BMR: One of the important things,  
I think, about women's music is that  
it's more than just a one-way com-  
munication. How do you go about get-  
ting feedback from the women that  
you play music for and make it more  
of a total learning experience for  
everybody?

MEG: Well, the first step to me is  
within the concert situation, trying  
to create a kind of atmosphere where  
it's not just me spouting out this  
stuff to these faceless bodies; I  
think that a real important part of  
women's music is that atmosphere of  
sharing, of exchange, of respect,  
and appreciation from me to every  
woman who's there. It's important  
to me, because I work with Olivia  
and because I want to present my mu-  
sic in the context of my work with  
Olivia, that the concert be a part  
of a larger sharing experience.

When Ginny and I travel around  
it's real important to us to know  
what women think, not only about my  
music, but about the work that Olivia  
does. To try to find out what women  
in different communities are think-  
ing about, and to try to share our  
political perspective with them, so  
as often as possible we try to do  
workshops, which are really sort of  
open-ended opportunities for us to  
sit down with women in a community  
and talk about whatever aspect of  
women's music or Olivia, or our pol-  
itics, our business; I mean there  
are so many things to talk about,  
but I see the workshops and the con-  
certs balancing each other in real  
important ways.

I have spent the past few years  
doing so many different kinds of con-  
certs for so many different kinds of  
groups of women. Some of them could  
hear that word with all its dire im-  
plications real easily and some of  
them, if I'd said that dreaded word  
within the context of the concert  
would not have heard one other thing  
I said. So I have always juggled  
loaded words like that very careful-  
ly. Anyway, those women were tell-  
ing me that I should take more risks,  
and I really agreed with them so I  
made a conscious political deci-  
sion around this tour to be a les-  
bian, to be as upfront about it as I  
could be. I picked my songs to make  
it clear that they were for women,  
and they were about love and caring  
for women.

Olivia Records:

Merging of  
Politics  
and Music

GINNY: We feel real strongly about  
our accountability to the feminist  
community: that's where our support  
comes from, that's where our $30,000  
that we've raised in donations comes  
from, that's where our record sales  
come from, that's where all the poli-  
tical and emotional support that we  
get comes from. We try to be ac-  
countable to that support. We pub-  
lish our financial statements yearly,  
and in fact, we're going to be doing  
our '75 statement soon and we're prob-  
ably maybe sending it to Big Mama.

We ask for feedback on our record  
jackets, and we get it and we respond  
to it.

We have learned a tremendous a-  
mount; our focus has changed a lot in  
the past few months as we've met with  
different groups of women who have  
had real good criticisms to make of the  
kinds of things that we've been do-  
ing. That part is real important to  
us because Olivia is not a female  
Warner Bros., we are a feminist bus-  
iness and that means that our struc-  
ture is set up in ways that we are  
trying to make be feminist ways.

We operate as a collective; when  
we hire women, we immediately sit  
down and figure out what a woman’s  
financial needs are, we don't have  
a—you start out at, you know, $1.50  
an hour and in two years you work up  
to $1.75 and you start out scrubbing  
floors and pretty soon you'll be va-  
cuuming rugs. Our whole structure  
is set up so we can build something  
that women will want to work in and  
can be a model for other feminist  
businesses and other feminist groups,  
and we can't do all that by our-  
selves, we don't have all the ideas  
in the world. This is a new inven-  
tion, there hasn't been anything  
like this before. We need the  
thoughts of women who have—thoughts.  
It's real important for us to know  
what other women are thinking about  
what we're doing.

The reviews almost always said,  
"Cris and Margie's music was real  
nice, Holly was the political one  
and Meg was the lesbian." “And I  
thought "WAIT, I don't think you got  
it." What I realized was, while it  
may have been a real political is-  
sue before I did it—going out there  
and being a lesbian—well, all of a  
sudden it wasn't political anymore.  
It was a hard lesson to learn be-  
cause it made me understand where a  
lot of women's heads were about the  
whole concept of lesbianism as a po-  
litical issue. It's made a great  
deal of difference to me since then,  
how I have presented my songs and  
what I've tried to say, because I  
realized that I had to start explain-  
ing why lesbianism was political to  
a lot of women.

BMR: In one of the reviews of the  
non Wheels concerts, which you  
recently did, a male reporter refer-  
red to your stage presence as being  
“locker room lesbian.” Would you  
like to comment on that?

MEG: Well, I have very little to  
say about what any man thought of  
the concert because it's irrelevant  
to me and I don't expect them to get  
it at all. It was of great concern  
to me to see how the women's press  
had reviewed the concert, because I  
had made a conscious decision—well,  
in the months before that tour, I  
had had some real good political dis-  
cussions with some women in Los An-  
geles, whose politics I respected a  
lot, about how up-front I was being  
about being a lesbian. They were  
saying that I should take more risks  
around that, that it was politically  
important to do that.

... a real important part of  
women’s music is that atmosphere  
of sharing, of exchange,  
of respect

One of the hardest things that  
we're doing is that we see Olivia as  
just a piece of that, and really  
a drop in the bucket of what needs  
to be done. For example, I just  
heard the other day that there are  
60,000 NOW members, now we have sold  
about 15,000 albums of Meg's music.  
Now that seemed like a lot of albums  
to me, wow 15,000, that's a lot of  
albums. We haven't even sold albums  
to all the NOW members, yet, never-  
mind everybody who's not even a NOW  
member. We really do see it as just  
a piece of what has to happen, and  
that gives us a whole different kind  
of perspective on decision-making,  
because we have to make decisions  
with the best interests of Olivia,  
the business in mind, and the best  
interests of our long-term strategies  
in mind, and they're sometimes dif-  
ferent.

MEG: We've talked with a lot of wo-  
men who have been involved in a lot  
of project groups and the main dif-  
ference that we see between Olivia  
and other groups is that we know of  
very very few other groups that were  
started on a political basis. That  
started out having a foundation of  
common politics, and then built a  
project on top of that. That's why  
we couldn't exist, not only on the  
level of being able to do what we're  
doing successfully, but we couldn't  
exist and feel like we were doing  
something that had meaning and poten-  
tial, if we didn't have that politi-  
cal foundation.

I realized I had to start explain-  
ing why lesbianism was political.

BMR: Can you please go into more  
specifically what you mean by work-  
ing collectively?

Meg: Working collectively means a  
whole lot of things; it means that  
we're accountable to each other for our  
work, we each have sort of different  
areas that we work in and that sort  
of fell naturally according to what  
our interests were and what needed  
to be done. We consult on all deci-  
sions and we decide basic business  
decisions together. Do you want to  
go into this more?

GINNY: One of the things that being  
a collective has enabled us to do  
has been to learn skills and teach  
each other skills at the same time  
that we're learning them. It's so  
hard to define or describe how a col-  
lective works, because it's all  
based on trust. And you can't de-  
fine that. There are five women on  
the collective now—we have just  
hired a woman named Theresa Trell,  
who is a musician from New York, as  
a worker and we are also going to be  
hiring two other women with the  
thought that they will become mem-  
bers of the collective. That's go-  
ing to be real interesting; we don't  
know how that's going to happen,  
yet. We are all, the five members  
of the collective and the three wo-  
men who are hopefully going to be  
members of the collective, are go-  
ing to figure out, as soon as we get  
home, going to sit down and try to  
structure the process of coming from  
non-member of the collective to mem-  
ber of the collective. That's going  
to be real important to us because  
we don't want to have labor-manage-  
ment kinds of splits.

We hope that every woman who be-  
comes a worker
