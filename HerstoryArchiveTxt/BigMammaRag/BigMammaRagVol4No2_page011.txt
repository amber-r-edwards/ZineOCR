**Observations By Obie**

A column

The world of filmmaking is one of the last monuments to the male myth that the blood of marketable creativity courses through male veins. No less than 100 films made by women were entered in the feminist film festival in Washington D.C. last August. The result is the National Women’s Film Circuit, consisting of six films as varied in technique and subject matter as presumably are the women who made them.

First on the bill, and by far the superior, is “The Changing Woman.” Made by four women, it covers women’s struggle for the past 200 years, giving heavy emphasis to the divide and conquer tactics that cross lines of race and class. The film raises some uncomfortable questions, not the least of which is, has the movement lost something?

Since the victory of the vote, where are we, with no platform, no plan? The film shows an exhausting amount of research, using an exquisite composite of old films, engravings, and photographs.

For those of us who enjoy fantasy, the second film, “And Then There Were...,” was delightful both in its simplicity of messages and inventiveness in a very difficult medium, animation. Linda Klosky uses a mosaic mode with colored paper to show the destruction of nature by civilization.

In “Fear,” Jean Shaw spins everywoman’s fantasy of triumph over the threat of male assault. A young woman turns the tables on her assailant, chases him through the city, wrestles him down until help arrives in the form of two women who cart him off to his just desserts.

The feelings of strength aroused in the audience were gratifying but filmically Ms. Shaw's first attempt is lacking. A camera is not a book.

“Like a Rose” is a powerful, disturbing account of two inmates at a minimum security correction center in Missouri. The waste of prison routine and the system's power to feed people back into its machinery leaves them devoid of anger, with only resignation remaining. The prison tries to make them ‘ladies.’ Even the reading material chosen for those learning to read is subject matter on how to be a good citizen.

The film is an excellent study of two women, with no identities left, telling it dispassionately. Sally Barrett-Page has done well with a subject that could have bordered on soap opera histrionics, but does not.

Billed as an esoteric lesbian commercial, “Dyketactics” is almost technically flawless. Telescoping and superimposing too quickly for consistent absorption, it is a celebration of women’s rituals. Oils, candles, massage, stroking, dancing, unhurriedness all blend into a rich sensuality that is almost childlike in its openness and vulnerability. Barbara Hume's style is polished and skillful.

It is too bad that “Foot in the Clouds” is marred by poor sound. More than a treatise on role models, it is a highly amusing account of a gypsy eccentric who locks horns with the town’s Sensible Woman. The way the two rock their own boat and that of the town council while learning from each other unfolds beautifully.

Made by Doe Mayer, the film treads a delicate balance between high drama and low comedy without tottering.

As feminist films, these six have attempted to pull together common female experience for some kind of woman-identification, and it is all there — oppression, anger, resignation, joy, celebration.

(The six films reviewed here comprise half of those being circulated by the National Women’s Film Circuit. The rest are expected to pass through Denver and Boulder later this year.)

“Swept Away (by an Unusual Destiny on the Blue Sea of August)”

a film by Lina Wertmuller

Eileen Bresnahan, Kate Sharp, Terra, Woodwoman

“Swept Away” is a story of class warfare, sado-masochism, and love. The plot goes something like this: The Woman (she has a name, but personal identity is not important in the film) is a liberal, spoiled, symbol of the upper-classes. As the film begins, we find her in the midst of a leisurely cruise on a beautiful yacht with a group of her friends. Enter the Man. He is a member of the yacht's crew. A comic figure, he is the stereotypical confused Italian Communist. As the cruise drags on, resentment builds between the Man and the Woman. He doesn’t like her “uppity ways,” while she is disgusted by his stupidity and boorishness.

The atmosphere having been established, the Man and the Woman set out together on a small boat, their destination a sheltered cove where she might swim. But, alas, the outboard motor of the boat breaks down, leaving them stranded “on the Blue Sea of August.” They make their way, with some difficulty, to a desert island, and here, of course, the plot thickens. The Woman, who until now has maintained the upper hand by virtue of her upper-class identity, suddenly finds that she has been dropped by destiny in the mythical ‘classless society.’ The Man will no longer serve her and she is not equipped to take care of herself. The balance of power has shifted to one based on strength and ability to survive, and she is definitely at the disadvantage. From this point the film goes only downhill. There follow in rapid succession a number of brutalization scenes. The Man demands that the Woman wash his clothes and wait on him. When she steps out of line he slaps her off her feet. This satisfies him for a while, but soon he becomes hungry for bigger and better degradations. He decides that she must not only be his slave but that she must like being his slave. In fact, she must love him. He brutally beats her and attempts to rape her. She fights and struggles but finally gives in and wants it (all women really want to be raped).

**For Yourself, The Fulfillment of Female Sexuality; Liberating Masturbation, A Meditation on Self Love**

Orgasm has the possibility of being a part of a woman’s radical feminist consciousness. But it also may be used to reinforce patterns of sexual interaction that are the very basis of sexism. Both of the books, For Yourself, The Fulfillment of Female Sexuality by Lonnie Garfield Barbach, and Liberating Masturbation, A Meditation on Self Love by Betty Dodson, focus on helping pre-orgasmic women to come without an accompanying analysis of orgasm as having political implications.

**Opening Taboos**

Due to the past mystification of sex in this society, the necessity of satisfying our curiosity about this taboo subject is an important first step towards integrating our sexuality into our whole self-concept. The sexual revolution (not to be confused with the feminist movement) has contributed some to the information available because of its encouragement of more openness about sexual matters.

By sharing information about our female sexuality, Barbach and Dodson help women to feel OK about this part of themselves and to enjoy themselves more. By including drawings of the genitals of many women, Dodson allows us to more easily accept and appreciate the uniqueness of how we look ourselves, rather than worrying about how we “should” look.

Basic myths associated with femininity are examined by both authors, especially concerning lies perpetrated about clitoral vs. “vaginal” orgasms. The general attitude of both women towards different methods of achieving orgasm is generally one of accepting masturbation, lesbian relationships, heterosexual relationships, and any combination thereof. However, the emphasis was most definitely on heterosexual relationships, especially in Barbach's book. She apologizes for this.

Is it possible that gay women do not have as many problems with coming as do straight women? These books add to the personal solution necessary to take control of our own bodies and selves. By encouraging independence, assertiveness, and self-awareness in sexual matters these positive qualities may be generalized by the readers to other situations in their lives.

Without political analysis of the pleasure of orgasm it may be used to placate women in their relationships with men, discouraging their consciousness of the political realities of those relationships.

**Women In Transition — A Feminist Handbook on Separation and Divorce**

Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1975  
Price: $12.95 hardcover, $6.95 paperback

(Resource person on divorce for Woman to Woman, The Women’s Institute, The Judean Society and author of various articles on divorce.)

The challenge of divorce or separation too often ends in a crunch. Trained observers find that in most cases, by far, the results are bitter, frustrated parties on both sides with damaged, disadvantaged children in the middle. Two situations contribute to such a sorry aftermath. One is personal ignorance, even in otherwise highly intelligent women. The other is the traumas created by the judiciary system, not anticipated. The self-blind, the unprepared and even those who know it all will find Women in Transition an exceptionally comprehensive guide.

...right. But now he refuses — he won't fuck her unless she loves him! The rest is predictable, she comes to love him for his mastery of her (all women really want to be mastered by a strong man, right?) and they embark on a series of sado-masochistic fucking scenes. But, too bad, a boat comes along. The Woman wants to let it go right on by. She doesn’t want to lose her island “paradise” and return to the life that she had before. But the Man refuses; he wants her to prove her love and this is his undoing. When they return to civilization everything is as it was before. The Woman returns to her husband and her privileged life, while he, “betrayed,” is forced to go back to his wife and family. The final scene is a classic — the Man, a master no longer, walking two steps behind his wife, and finally running up to walk by her side. Reduced to being an “equal.”

What can you say about a film that made you sick and angry from start to finish? That the cinematography was beautiful? It was indeed. That Wertmuller is more confused than her confused Communist? She is indeed. That the men in the audience loved it? They laughed, and whistled, and applauded with each new brutality committed on the Woman. All these things are true.

I am left wondering what, in the name of the goddess, Wertmuller was trying to say. It was a filthy trick on her part to represent the privileged classes by a woman, so that when the Man hit her it could be interpreted as the working classes striking out at the upper classes, rather than as a man brutalizing a woman for his own macho reasons. I was reminded of the rape of women in wartime — men using the hostility between countries to excuse their venting of their own hostility toward women.

It is possible, I suppose, that she was trying to point out that in a society without social structure, there would be no classes, no Communist/Capitalist, only survival of the fittest. If this is the case, then the lesson for women is clear — we had better get ourselves strong and self-reliant, so that we won't fall prey to the first pig that happens along.

Or perhaps she was meaning that people only believe in “causes” or “ideals” as long as they benefit them. The Man certainly abandoned his Communism quickly enough when it became clear that he had the advantage. Are ethics only situational? Will anyone who is given the opportunity exploit those less able to defend themselves? Or is this only true of males, who carry the lust for dominance in their makeup?

Whatever the point that Wertmuller was trying to make, her use of women was degrading and shabby. Her implications that women want to be raped and that women only truly love when they are brutalized are dangerous to us all. If this film was frightening, and it was, the reaction of the men in the audience only escalated that fright into terror. This film is nothing less than anti-woman. That the director and producer was a woman is irrelevant. Don't spend your money to support a work which invalidates each of us and our struggle.
