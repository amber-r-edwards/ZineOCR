The point of biography is the  
recreation of personality. This is  
also the single greatest diffi-  
culty. It is relatively easy for the  
biographer to amass a quantity  
of facts on the life of her sub-  
ject: when she was born, where  
she received her schooling, with  
whom she took tea on Wednes-  
days. More difficult to obtain is  
information on the sort of ap-  
parel she preferred, the books  
she treasured, the peculiar turn  
of her head when amused; ac-  
cordingly, this information  
brings the biographer closer to  
her goal: coaxing the elusive  
personality out from the ple-  
thora of inanimate data at her  
disposal.  

Personality: that mysterious  
collection of fears, aspirations,  
superstitions, joys. More  
generally, the manner and the  
disposition. More specifically,  
the turn of the phrase, the pitch  
of the laugh, the characteristic  
gesture — this is the substance  
of biography.  

Unfortunately, the bi-  
ographer is usually reduced to  
surmising personality. From the  
blueprint of her subject's  
actions, the biographer tries to  
pin down the rules of thumb  
under which to group beha-  
vioral and intellectual traits: the  
personality. She guesses that  
her subject ‘must have’ felt  
such-and-such because her  
subject did such-and-such.  

Jean Detre has created a bio-  
graphical form which allows her  
to take a stab at personality with-  
out continually reminding the  
reader of the distinction  
between what she knows and  
what she guesses. It is a biogra-  
phy that is more historical fic-  
tion than biography. Detre has  
invented a journal for Mary  
Wollstonecraft, kept in the last  
year of her life. The biography is  
that journal, including authen-  
tic letters between Wollstone-  
craft and Godwin.  

And lo! Wollstonecraft  
emerges. A thoughtful, sensi-  
tive, passionate, and intelligent  
woman, she catches us up in the  
patter of her days. We follow  
Wollstonecraft to dinner and to  
the theatre; more importantly,  
we follow her back to her deal  
table where she records her  
reflections on the day, on her  
life, on the condition of women,  
and on the state of humanity.  

One who is not familiar with  
Wollstonecraft’s life will  
flounder a bit through the first  
pages of the journal; soon, how-  
ever, Detre comes to one’s aid  
with historical hooks which will  
not only fix the year of the jour-  
nal — 1796 — in its proper place  
in Wollstonecraft’s life, but will  
also anchor it on an historical  
timeline. The American Revolu-  

tion has been fought and in-  
dependence won, the French  
Revolution has caused already  
seven years of intense turmoil,  
the war between France and  
England which launches  
Napoleon has just begun, and  
Pitt is the repressive Prime  
Minister of England: all this  
Wollstonecraft comments upon  
in her journal. She comments,  
too, upon her friends and  
acquaintances, a collection of  
the most influential minds of the  
turn of the century: Tom Paine,  
William Blake, Samuel  
Coleridge, James Boswell (who  
has just died), William Hazlitt,  
Henry Fuseli, Sir Joshua Rey-  
nolds, Horne Tooke, Joseph  
Johnson, and, of course, William  
Godwin.  

She has published two his-  
torical works (which are not  
mentioned in the journal): A  
Vindication of the Rights of Men  
(1791), written in defense of the  
French Revolution against the  
attack upon it by Edmund Burke,  
and A Historical and Moral View  
of the Origins and Progress of  
the French Revolution and the  
Effect It Has Produced (1794).  
Neither of these works have sur-  
vived, the first because it was  
eclipsed by later works on the  
same subject, such as Paine’s  
Rights of Man, the second, be-  
cause it was without either in-  
sight or scholarship.  

She had also published the  
work which made her famous, A  
Vindication of the Rights of  
Woman, as well as several fic-  
tional works, the most distin-  
guished among them, Letters  
Written During a Short Resi-  
dence in Sweden, Norway, and  
Denmark. “If ever there was a  
book calculated to make a man in  
love with its author, this appears  
to me to be the book,” remarked  
Godwin of the "Letters."  

Through the journal the  
molding/shaping influences of  
Wollstonecraft’s life emerge:  
her father’s tyrannization of her  
entire family, driving her to  
assume the familial respon-  
sibilities which burdened her  
most of her life, the death in  
childbirth of her closest woman  
friend, for whom she named her  
first-born, the kindness and en-  
couragement she received from  
her friend and editor Joseph  
Johnson, her absorbing love af-  
fairs with Fuseli and the Ameri-  
can Gilbert Imlay, her near-  
suicide in the Thames.  

The argument for woman's  
rights runs throughout the jour-  
nal. At every turn Wollstone-  
craft recognizes the inequities  
between her situation, that of  
women, and Godwin's, that of  
men. It is Godwin around whom  
the sycophantic intellectuals  
flock, Godwin whose male ego  
she must protect from deflation,  
Godwin, who, when they marry,  
must have uninterrupted work-  
ing time while she minds child-  
ren and household. She  
speculates on the fate of women  
with talent and intelligence with  
the eloquence of Virginia Woolf  
in A Room of One's Own, con-  
trasting the fate of Shake-  
speare’s sister to that of Shake-

Poor Fanny Reynolds! . . .  
Where else could she have  
learned to paint, but from  
her brother's paintings? She  
had not spent years in  
Rome, as he had, copying  
the treasures of the Vatican.  
The only woman I have ever  
heard of who received any  
sort of education as an artist  
was Angelica Kauffmann,  
whose father had to dress  
her in boy's clothing when  
he sent her to learn to draw.  
I sit in a silent fury of sym-  
pathy, imagining young  
Angelica Kauffmann,  
dressing before her looking-  
glass in a theatrical trans-  
formation that alone would  
gain her entry into studios  
where she might study the  
human form. . . Poor Fanny  
Reynolds, sister of great-  
ness, with only her  

brother's paintings to draw  

from, becoming for her  

efforts his grotesque shade.  

I sense her house-bound,  

silenced existence. ‘How  

had she dared pick up a  

brush that men alone are  

said to have the right to  
wield? Why, she had dared  
from such a desire to paint  
as makes one think talent  
bestirred her.  
One is reminded, certainly, of  
the passion and eloquence of the  
work for which Wollstonecraft is  
known.  

Detre dwells less on Woll-  
stonecraft the celebrity than  
Wollstonecraft the woman,  
however. People and events in  
the biography, important as they  
are, serve as foils to Wollstone-  
craft. This is yet another merit of  
the form of this biography. The  
Reign of Terror, for instance,  
throughout which Wollstone-  
craft lived near Paris, is refrac-  
ted through her honed sensibil-  
ity and leaves us with a haunting  
portrait.  

When he turned into the  
room, I knew he had some  
frightful news. I asked if it  
was Brissot who had been  
taken, and he nodded...  
but, wait, I am confusing,  
am I not, news of Brissot’s  

arrest with still another  

evening in October, when  

Imlay, standing within the  

same small room, dull with  

early dusk, his voice low in  
disbelief, recounted that, by  
Robespierre’s orders, the  
Twenty-two, all Girondists,  
had one by one mounted the  
guillotine. As he spoke, I  
seemed to see them stand-  
ing at the foot of the gallows —  
then all went dark. When  
I recovered consciousness,  
Imlay was placing a pillow  
under my head; he made a  
startled sound that I was  
able, only afterward, to  
interpret. The impact of my  
grief had been so acute that  
it had caused a paralysis  
along one side of my face.  

The journal also chronicles  
Wollstonecraft’s growing affec-  
tion for Godwin, culminating in  
marriage. Godwin does not,  
however, play the part in this  
biography that the title would  
lead us to believe. One won-  
ders, indeed, why Detre felt  
compelled to attempt a double  
portrait. Throughout, Godwin is  
timid, boring, and egotistical.  
Only on rare occasions does his  
supposed love for Wollstone-  
craft raise him to any level of  
tenderness. Why Wollstone-  
craft calls him her “‘dearest  
friend’ remains a mystery to the  
reader. He matches her neither  
in intelligence nor in passion.  
Either Detre did a poor job of  
editing the letters (which one  
doubts), or (one suspects) he is  
included because of his fame as  
a political philosopher and the  
prominent role he makes for  
himself as Wollstonecraft’s first  
biographer.  

The inclusion of Godwin is a  
flaw not only because one  
wonders about Detre’s motiva-  
tion, but also because it limits  
the scope of the biography. The  
importance of Wollstonecraft’s  
love affairs with Fuseli and Imlay  
are diminished. Her letters —  
terrifyingly passionate letters —  
to Imlay were necessarily  
excluded.  

Because the form prohibits  
Detre from distinguishing be-  
tween what in the biography is  
truth and what is fiction, one has  
to take her word for its authen-  
ticity. Without notes, or biogra-  
phical references, Detre  
demands that the reader take  
her scholarship on faith.  

It is not solely the biography of  
a woman, however, and it is be-  
cause of this that we can forgive  
Detre any factual liberties. She  
has presented us with an era,  
pivoted around a tightly knit  
group of intellectuals, and con-  
densed to one year in the life of  
one of the most extraordinary  
women of her time. Through  
Wollstonecraft's sympathetic  
and intelligent observation,  
Detre has chronicled the life of a  
woman who is to some extent all  
women similarly oppressed  
and similarly pledged to family  
and lover — and showed us how  
she spent her days: what she  
wore — skirts which prevented  
her from going out in damp.

Earthwoman: Healer of the  
Mind Saba  
New Dance Studio Publica —  
tions paperback, $2.00  

Penny Bruce  

It is said that time heals all  
wounds; and I suppose that that  
healing can include the wisdom  
we gain through hindsight with  
the hope we will develop some  
foresight.  

In her book “Earthwoman,  
Healer of the Mind,” Jacqueline  
“Saba” Earley, has shown her-  
self to be a person who has lived  
the highs and lows of this  
Earth’s present realities; her  
uniqueness lies in her ability to  
see and express the beauty and  
terror of these realities, and the  
wisdom she has gained thereby.  

Her writing style is often light  
and breezy, yet with that quality  
that reveals a woman who has  
matured in struggle. In “Rising  
Signs” and “New York Blues” we  
live the bread and butter ‘reals’  
of Harlem; “Assassination,  
Shootout” vividly recalls the na-  
tional tragedy of Kent State and  
Southern University. I, as a black  
woman, have struggled with  
those subtler, ethnic feelings she  
reveals in “Go Girl Go.”  

What poet can live in Colorado  
and not be inspired by one of our  
dazzling sunsets? In “My Point of  
View” she writes, "This  
Colorado sunset end of day,  
takes the breath away.” I found  
in “Liberation” and “Radical  
Woman” some of the en-  
couragement black and Third  
World women need to contri-  
bute to the development of  
woman's culture and perhaps  
the inspiration we may need to  
address ourselves to woman's  
issues.  

Her poem “For Valerie May-  
nard, Artist” takes a brave step,  
it’s a courageous blow struck  
against the alienation of black  
women toward each other as  
women and as artists. Jacqui  
writes: ‘So, if another woman  
sings your praise, understand it  
is the poet who measures and  
weighs.”  

“Earthwoman, Healer of the  
Mind” is far too short. But a  
talent like Jacqui’s can't be kept  
down, she gives us a peek at a  
hope-filled, freer future, for she  
is a woman who is “Stepping  
into the future, dangerously  
alive!”
