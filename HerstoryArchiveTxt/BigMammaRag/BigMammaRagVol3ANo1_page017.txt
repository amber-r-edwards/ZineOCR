Smile

| smiled again today;  
Reflex grimace.

Someone signalled danger  
And I was fired  

Into my act.

A friendly question  
Snagged me back  

By a sawtoothed edge.  
Counterpoint:

“Smile, lady.

Talk.

Not thinking anything,  
Are you, lady?”

He feels the stretching tension  
He likes it.

My silence is forbidden;  
I smile and talk.

Little Ole Lady

There must be  

Of course  

A considerable distance  
Between wanting to be  
A little ole lady  

Bent over  

With a fuzzy brown hat  
Eyes that snuff out  

The very life  

It hangs onto  

And being me  
Struggling to get away...

ending with a song

I AM A KOOM  

one “K” with two outstretched arms  
two “O's”  
two round breasts  
two eyes to the future  
two circles that never end  
one “M" shaped like an earth mountain  
three openings to three sacred oracles

the hard way, that  

to nurse is sometimes  

to be sucked dry,  

that besides the birthing earth,  
and yielding flow of water,  
there is fire  

there is air  

and body not only  

nipple and womb, but  

mind  
hands  
voice  
eyes  
wings

Denver Moonrise  

Big bloody yolk  

squeezed up over yellow hills  
beyond the city’s straggling;  
Popped into the slate-blue east.  
Lines of lights on lost contours  
mark the concrete burials  

of valley and bluff and river-bottom.

But when the moon is full I feel my uterus.”
