Cable TV: Women and the Media

Elissa Meyer

Occasionally I have heard Cable Television referred to as an alter-
native to broadcast television, the hour after hour barrage of

stereotypes and triviality that comes into peoples’ homes through
the airwaves. Cable television is different; it is brought to homes
through wires which carry electronic signals. The range of channels
which can be brought in through the cable is much wider, and it can
provide a much more diverse and realistic selection of program-
ming. Unfortunately, after attending the national convention of the
National Cable Television Association, I feel less than hopeful
about Cable Television's potential.

I had hoped that the conven-

tion would have one redeeming

factor—that was the Public
Access activity. According to
FCC regulations, when a cable
company receives a franchise to
go into an area, it must provide at
least one Public Access channel
through the cable. When that
channel becomes occupied dur-
ing a specified period of time, the
company is obligated to open
another channel. Under the FCC
guidelines these channels
would make studio time
available to any individual or
group with a TV message at no
cost. Again, the possibilities for
utilizing television as a com-
munications tool under this
system are opened up as never
before. So what is really happen-
ing in these two areas, Cable
Television and Public Access,
especially in terms of changing
attitudes and opportunities for
women?
Profits or People?

On arrival at the Conrad Hilton
in Chicago, the location for the
NCTA Convention, I began to
sense the tone which pervaded
the entire four days: making
Cable a profitable business.
Over three thousand smartly-
suited businessmen were
gathering to shake right hands
and to increase assets. The
overwhelming reality is that it
does take money to lay miles of
cable throughout a geographic
area, and that in order to sell
subscriptions to the cable,
Cablecasters think they must
have slick, pre-packaged
productions to compete with
broadcast. But in this writer's
opinion, they are missing the
point. They ignore the explosive
possibility that if people knew
they could get easy access to TV
time and to the necessary
production tools through Cable,
they would be more likely to sup-
port it. Cablecasters downplay
Public Access because of what
they consider the mediocre
quality of the programming
produced by the newly-
enfranchised public who have
taken advantage of existing
Public Access channels.

As to be expected, this
chauvinistic attitude was ex-
tended to and reflected in the
roles of women at the conven-
tion. There were few women
there who represented top ad-
ministrative positions in Cable;
there were a small minority of
women who were production
managers for Public Access and
local organization programming in
small metropolitan centers. But
the most conspicuous women at
the convention were those not in
positions of responsibility, but
rather those who were dressed
and made-up as models at the
equipment exhibits. In this
multi-million dollar jungle of
sophisticated mixers, switchers,
cameras, and monitors, these
women were planted by the
manufacturers to make their
brands more attractive and
saleable. If this is the mentality
of the Cablecasters, we can ex-
pect little in the way of change in

the programming provided by
them as opposed to present
programming over broadcast
television.
Best Production of the Year
I must admit, the “gentlemen”
did give token recognition to the
work of women in the field of
Cable Television. At the NCTA
Awards Ceremony, Ms. Kim
Beaman and Ms. Nancy Hauser,
the production managers for
Public Access and Local Origina-
tion programming in Jackson,
Michigan, received five top
awards including Best Produc-
tion of the Year for a videotape
called “Nancy.” The tape is a
sensitive, delicate portrayal of a
woman, mother and wife, who is
approaching middle-age and
feels trapped by her cir-
cumstances. In a skillful inter-
view style, Ms. Hauser and Ms.
Beaman show Nancy as her
own, individual way of life is
beginning to take shape in her
mind and is starting to unfold in
her interactions with her family
and outside her home in her ac-
tivities. Well deserving of the

acclaim, the tape’s co-producers
accepted the awards, but later
expressed some of their growing
cynicism.

At an ad hoc Women's
Caucus, twenty-five women
attending the convention
gathered to express rising
alienation with Cablecasting. At
this forum, Kim and Nancy
revealed the frustrations of their
work. They work full time for
part-time salaries, making them
the lowest paid employees
among the professional staff.
They also told us that “Nancy”
was one tape of a series shown
weekly which they created and
produced themselves about the
local community. Using portable
videotaping equipment, they
went out into the Jackson area

and found people, activities and
programs of local interest. From
these hours of tape they distilled
a format, and after many ad-
ditional hours of editing and

technical work, they had a final

set of polished programs which
truly realized the function of
Cable TV. This series informed
the community about itself; it
featured real people, not
celebrities; and it began a real
communications system—not
just from the studio to the home,
but also from the home to the
studio.

None of this valuable work
has been recognized. Even the
award-winning “Nancy” will be
of little benefit to the women
themselves. They told us that
they would get no bonuses
because of the rewards, but that
the Cablecasters would use the
rewards as a sales pitch to get
more subscribers to the Cable.
One woman said she was leav-
ing her position to go back to
school. “I know they will hire a
man in my place, and probably at
twice the salary.” They also
know that any new local origina-
tion programming will de-
emphasize the two-way com-
munication. Cablecasters want
slick, professional looking
products; they are less in-
terested in the real people and
what they have to say.

Among the women’s caucus
were many women from the
Public Access angle of Cable.
Some were from Public Access
Stations; others were just in-
terested in working with video
and using Public Access
channels as a means of distribu-
tion. Nevertheless, we had a
very different and more
frustrating form of sexism to
confront within the meetings
and programs regarding Public
Access.

To begin with, it was apparent
from the start that Public Access
was being downplayed. There
were two rooms set aside in a
far-off corner of the Hilton for
what was called the ‘Video En-
vironment.” It seemed that all
Public Access information was
to emanate from here, even
though all other aspects of Cable
had space and meetings
throughout the entire hotel.
There were a few sessions held
in other meeting rooms on
Public Access, but these leaned
heavily on the financial feasibili-
ty more than anything else.

The “Video Environment”
from the start was fraught with
problems of its own. Some of
them can be attributed to “lack
of organization,” but in my opi-
nion it suffered from a severe
case of schizophrenia. Most of
the time people were at cross-
purposes to one another. A
number of the people into Public
Access now have come from a
strange breed commonly called
“video-freaks.” They began
recognizing the potential of
video when the portable equip-
ment first came on to the market
about eight years ago. They
started experimenting with the
technology and using it to
promote alternative media. Not
surprisingly, the “video freaks”
were predominantly male, or at
least those who became most
technically advanced were. And
it seems that with their ex-
perience and development they
are moving farther away from
the rationale of alternative
media and closer to the
traditional concept of pre-
produced programs. At one time
the attitude prevailed that with
the advent of portable, easy-to-
use video equipment, anyone
could be easily trained to use
television as a medium for their
message. Among some alter-
native groups this attitude still
prevails. And these groups con-
tinue to train people—elderly
groups, women's collectives,
high school students, working
people—to use the technology.
They will distribute these tapes
through any means available to
them. That could be Public
Access, broadcast, or simply
closed circuit TV showings with
a specific target audience. But
these groups generate and
proliferate knowledge and skills
about television; they demystify
the technology and promote a
powerful tool for information.

On the other hand, these
groups generally lack resources
and are up against some of the
regressive behavior of other
groups mistakenly taken as
alternatives. These others con-
trolled the ‘Video Environment”
in Chicago. I found them
overwhelmingly male-
dominated, arrogant and op-
pressive. Their primary orienta-
tion was a video product. Within
the small microcosm of the
“Video Environment,” a
hierarchy of status and prestige
emerged parallel if not identical
to the Cable System's hierarchy.
Highest ranking appeared to be
those people who had managed
to hustle the most money, to put
together the slickest productions
with highly sophisticated
machinery, to talk to the right
man, and to get over Broadcast.
Next were the up-and-comers
who brought hours and hours of
their productions to the conven-
tion on the hope that some
Cablecaster might “discover”
them and offer them money.
Lastly were the struggling
groups trying to make some
sense out of media and with
media for their neighborhoods
and communities.

In and of themselves, produc-
tion and community television
need not be so divergent in
goals. One stresses a process
and the other a product. In one
sense the quality of tapes
created by community people
