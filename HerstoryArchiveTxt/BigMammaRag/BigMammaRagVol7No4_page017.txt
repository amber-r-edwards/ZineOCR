LESBIANS

Breeze

April 14th was an important day
in the history of the Boulder Lesbian
Network. We had a meeting so that we
could give the BLN a structure, which
we hoped would help us reach our goals.
The meeting was important in that it
was the first time in almost a year
since the BLN began, that we sat down
together and took a look within. The
members of our loosely-knit group sat
in the warmth of the sun and we tried
to define our goals and purposes. The

process of who we are, what we're do-
ing, where we're going, left me remin-
iscing...

A year ago, there was no BLN.
There were ways for lesbians to get
together, but they were few. So on
one sunny day in July '78, we all gat-
hered together and decided to try to
organize a group with a solid founda-
tion. The Boulder Lesbian Network
is the end result of that day. It
was a wonderful conference with sev-
eral workshops where we all shared
some very intimate time together. We
also spent some time exploring ideas
about what we wanted out of our com-
munity, and popular opinion demanded a
coffeehouse as an alternative to the
Denver bar scene. So the newly found-
ed BLN put their high-spirited energy
in that direction, and the coffeehouse
has been a very successful endeavor.
Thanks to a hard-working handful of
consistent members of the Network

NETWORKING IN BOULDER

known as the Coffeehouse Committee,

the community has been able to enjoy
monthly gatherings in a non-alcoholic,
hustle-free, male-free environment.

And while we relax in that mellow
atmosphere, we are supporting women;
the performers are paid a portion of
the total taken at the door. That
means this community is enjoying qual-
ity entertainment at a low price.
Again, no alcohol is allowed, and men
are not welcome. And 75¢ will buy your
all-night fix of caffeine, with whipped
cream on it, even!

These Saturday evenings meet a lot
of needs. The coffeehouse is an import-
ant space, and steady attendance has
shown that space is appreciated by
many.

Some other social activities the
BLN sponsors are dances, hikes, Full
Moon celebrations; however we are not
strictly a social organization. Not
too long ago we found ourselves pick-
eting some local bars because of
their policies regarding gays. So,
for those of you with “political as-
pirations"... You see?! The BLN has
something for everybody!

If you happen to be feeling un-
informed about what's going on in the
community, the BLN Newsletter is the
answer to that! The newsletter is the
monthly publication you can receive
by mail for a mere $3 for 6 months.

If you or your organization would like

COMMUNITY

MEETING

HELD —

EMERGING WOMAN PRESS

Judy Barlow

A community meeting was held at
7:00 p.m. at Woman to Woman feminist
book center to decide what to do with
the A.B. Dick 320 printing press and
platemaker left by Emerging Woman
Press.

Emerging Woman Press was first org-
anized as a collective during the
summer of 1976. Money to purchase the
press was obtained from the profits of
the Third Annual Women's Festival in
1976. Members of Emerging Woman Press
along with members of Woman Quest
(now defunct) and other interested
women organized and produced the Third
Annual Women's Festival.

The press collective borrowed $200
from the Denver Sustaining Fund (DSF)
in the spring of 1977 in order to pur-
chase a platemaker. It was agreed
that the loan would be repaid by doing
printing for DSF.

During its existence, Emerging
Woman Press offered printing free or
at cost to local feminist and leftist
organizations. The collective main-
tained a political line by reserving
the right to refuse to print for
"groups or people whose politics and/
or activities are detrimental to
stated goals and the community at
large." (from Emerging Woman Press
principles of unity.)

The collective disbanded in 1978
after printing a book written by a
local woman. They found that they
had greatly underestimated the cost
and energy required for such an under-
taking. Most of the collective members
have since moved away from Denver.

The community meeting was called by
Lori Bradford, a feminist printer
and member of the press collective,
and Bobbe Ross, a feminist printer.
Both women have continued to do free
printing for many feminist and

leftist groups. The women wanted to
let the community decide what to do
with the press. Less than 10 women
attended.

Lori explained that the press was
not capable of high quality work, but
was suitable for leaflets and business
forms. The platemaker, however, is
in good condition.

Diane McDaniel, representative of the
Denver Sustaining Fund said that her
group did not want to take the press or
platemaker away from the women's
community, but would like the loan
($200) repaid.

Lori and Bobbe said that they did
not feel that the DSF should be re-
paid, although they might consider ful-
filling the obligation by doing $200
worth of printing.

Big Mama Rag offered to pay the
money to DSF in order to keep the press
for the women's community. The group
consensus was that the money not be
paid to the DSF because DSF had not
corresponded with the press in almost
2 years and had not supplied the
collective with printing jobs in order
to repay the loan.

It was agreed that the press be sold
and the money be recycled into the
feminist community. Another community
meeting will be held to decide what to
do with the money after the press
and platemaker are sold.

At 1520 Euclid in Boulder, the
Network holds meetings every first
and third Tuesdays of each month, at
7:30. The first Tuesday generally
pertains to the business aspect of the
Network, while the third Tuesday is a
discussion group. Some of the topics
of discussion have been mythology as
it pertains to women, and gay history.

One of the goals of the BLN is
to let the public know that there is
more to being a lesbian than simply
having a sexual preference for women.
Some members of the network have
volunteered to do public speaking on

the topic of lesbianism: If your or-
ganization is interested, write us
and let us know.

The BLN wants to combine their
energy with other women's organizations
too. We can give each other support
and unite this community. There is
power in unity.

My Webster's tells me that a net-
work is “a group of things connected".
That's what the BLN is all about; women
connecting, women uniting, and putting
that strength and energy toward a com-
mon goal—our liberation. Not the libera-
tion of lesbians only, not the libera-
tion of socialist-feminists only, not
the liberation of displaced homemakers
only, but the liberation of women as
one.

OF WOMANSEEDS

Lee Ann Blevins

The urge emerged to celebrate the
strength and spirit of woman: A
woman-seed. They nurtured it, "Let's
dance this feeling, let's celebrate
this gift, let's share it!" So began
the birth, "Of Womanseeds" by five
lovely dancers and a poet. As the
interpretation evolved, the sharing
of the creative process left the mel-
low glow of a fine wine—a shy excite-
ment in the post-rehearsal eyes of
each woman.

Each brought her gift: Stephanie
Thomas and Tracy Bishop their high-

school-woman strength and freshness,
Stacey Senter her university serious-
ness and technical grasp, Kathy Russ

and Pam Cisneros lent their teaching
experience and production insights,
Lee Ann Blevins sketched it in words.

We are a strong, rainbow-flavored
umbilical cord to the rest of the
universe—we who "cook woman-spirit".
Come. Share in the celebration May

5th and 27th at the Changing Scene
