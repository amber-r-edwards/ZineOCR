Power Behind Anti-ERA Campaign Here

Deborah Taylor

(Editors' Note: The outcome of
Amendment 6, which would rescind the
Equal Rights Amendment in Colorado,
will have been decided by the time
this issue of Big Mama Rag goes to
press. The following article is
reprinted essentially unchanged from
our October issue. Although it is
no longer as "timely" as it was last
month, it provides an excellent an-
alysis of the ERA campaign in
Colorado and the rest of the country.)

The Equal Rights Amendment to the
Colorado constitution states: "E-
quality of rights under the law shall
not be denied or abridged by the
state of Colorado or any of its sub-
divisions on account of sex." The
basic question of the ERA is: is it
valid for legal distinctions to be
made on the basis of sex?

Business Opposes ERA

There are strong forces opposing
the ERA. The most important is big
business. The ERA was first proposed
in 1923, and lay dormant until former
House Representative Martha Griffiths
brought it out of the Judicial Com-
mittee in 1970; it passed easily in
the House, 346-15. In 1970 business
was in an expansive cycle and decided
it could afford to hand out some
"goodies to the girls."

Opposition soon developed, however,
when business realized it could not
afford such a change in the structure
of the labor force. With an already
decreased flexibility in the hiring
and firing of Blacks, the ERA would
make the labor force too inelastic.

The costs of equality would also
be high for business in terms of eli-
minating the discrepancies between
male and female work patterns. For
example, if in 1970, women who worked
had earned the same amount per hour
as men who worked, it would have cost
employers an additional $96 billion
in payroll. Also, if women had worked
the same number of hours, the pay-
roll costs would have been $303 bil-
lion higher. (Of course, in this case
production would have increased as
well.) The ERA and the traditional
role of women in our capitalist eco-
nomy will be incompatible.

Insurance Industry Versus Women

Most of the opposition by business
and labor has been covert because e-
qual rights for women is a popular
issue. They say they support the ERA
but in practice, do not give money or
show they are serious. The insurance
industry has been the most obvious in
its opposition. Most of the vocal
anti-ERA leaders in the State Legisla-
tures have been insurance agents. This
is because the insurance industry dis-
criminates against women in its rates
and coverage. The insurance industry
is regulated only by state governments
and not Washington, so they can easily
apply direct pressure on state legis-
latures.

In life insurance, most of the pro-
fits come from large policies sold to
married men. As men are forced from
the role of sole provider of the fami-
ly, women will probably not take up
the slack on coverage. In 1972, of
$212.274 billion of life policies sold,
83% were sold to men, 73% of whom
were married. The average policy ta-
ken by a woman head of household is
$8,010 versus $21,430 for a married
man.

Besides losing profits, the insur-
ance industry does not want to have
to face discrimination charges if the
ERA passes. In medical and disabili-
ty insurance, women get fewer bene-
fits and are charged higher rates.
Pregnancy and gynecological ailments
are excluded from coverage, while
male disorders like prostate condi-
tions are provided for. Employed wo-
men often cannot get as much coverage
as wives of male employees. Waitress-
es are classified as generally “un-
acceptable risks" for disability,
while waiters are not. In the same
occupational categories, the rates
are 45% to 115% higher for women
than for men.

The other anti-ERA forces are con-
servative religious groups (Right to
Life), right-wing groups (John Birch
Society), and frightened housewives
in organizations like Wake Up Colora-
do. Business supports all these
groups covertly with contributions,
and most of these groups are well-
organized and financed.

Conservative Right Wing Groups

Many conservative Fundamentalist
churches have actively supported the
anti-ERA campaign. In Colorado, the
Church of the Latter Day Saints has
been prominent in opposition. In New
York, the Knights of Columbus leaf-
letted outside Catholic Churches.
Right to Lifers have linked their
campaign against abortion with the
ERA, saying that the sacred family and
role of Mother are being destroyed by
the Federal government.

The John Birch Society and other
right-wing groups have openly cam-
paigned against the ERA. The JBS
spends $8 million a year to field 85
organizers throughout the country. Ac-
cording to research by the L.A. chap-
ter of N.O.W., the JBS was reported
to have recently spent one million on
a contract to print anti-ERA litera-
ture. Joseph Coors contributes heavi-
ly to the John Birch Society. Coors
also supports right-wing politicians
who are anti-ERA ($1,000 to Ted
Strickland and $250 to Sam Zachem,
both anti-ERA candidates for state
legislature in Denver).

The

Gudrun aden’

In Colorado, the women's organiza-
tions which are leading the fight
against the ERA are "Operation Wake
Up Colorado” and the "League of House-
wives." They are both members of
the national organization headed by
Phyllis Schlafly, “Stop ERA", which
has offices in 45 states. Much of
their material for the anti-ERA cam-
paign comes from Stop ERA which gets
its information from the right-wing
"Network of Patriotic Letter Writers."
The NPLW literature is color-coded
by issues: anti-ERA is pink, racist
slurs yellow, and education (anti-
busing and sex education) white, etc.

The League of Housewives calls it-
self a "grassroots" group composed of
housewives, but it is also financed by
right-wing money which is raised na-
tionally. (They have not filed the
financial statement required by the
Fair Campaign Practices Act.)

The image of women in Stop ERA is
that of a woman at home, happy and
supported by her husband. An ironic
anecdote about the League of House-
wives is that their name used to be
"The Happiness of Womanhood." How-
ever, they had to change it after they
got too many phone calls from men look-
ing for prostitutes.

The League of Housewives says it
has 700 active volunteers who are
“swamped with speaking engagements" at
places like C.U., D.U., clubs like the
Optimists Club, elementary schools, and
churches. The literature they put out
is full of innuendos, distortions, and
lies, although very polished and
slick. They say, for example, that
the ERA will make homosexual
marriages legal, cause women to
lose rights to support and alimony,
require unisex toilets, integrate
athletic teams, require social
security for housewives which hus-
bands will have to pay, and require
women to serve in combat duty if
the draft is reinstated.

It's arduous and time-consuming
to respond to these lies, but it
is important because they stimulate
a lot of fear. In fact, the courts
do not interfere with ongoing
marriages; only when a couple
breaks up will the Court make a
judgment about support. With the
ERA, support obligations will be
determined by each partner's
ability to pay. This means that
the husband is not automatically
chosen to support the children
and that the wife could be given
that responsibility if she had a
high-paying job. This legal sit-
uation is already true in Colorado
with the Uniform Dissolution of
Marriage Act.

Homosexual marriages would not
become legal with the ERA. No-
thing in the ERA prohibits sex-
segregated bathrooms, and the
Supreme Court has said that there
is a constitutional right to
privacy between the sexes. (Air-
planes already use single-sex
toilets.) Athletic teams may be
integrated, but this does not mean
that girls will not be able to play
because of stiffer competition with
boys. Girls will gradually change
their attitudes and abilities, and
in the meantime compensation can be
made. Protecting girls from com-
petition is inherently restrictive.

ERA Colorado, the statewide pro-
ERA group, has found that women
aged 18-35 are the group of women
most opposed to the ERA. This is
when women are most involved with
finding a husband, raising child-
ren, and running a family. Later,

* women have more time to become in-
volved in other tasks and roles;
for young wives, it is often diffi-
cult to resolve the conflict be-
tween the family and oneself. The
family is the primary unit of ex-
perience rather than the indivi-
dual.

Will We Win?

Will the ERA be retained in Colo-
rado, and what will this mean to
the passing of the Federal ERA
amendment? It will be close. One
thing in favor is that voters tend
to vote "No" more often on refer-
endums than "Yes" out of a fear
of change. Colorado has had the
ERA for four years, and nothing
has been drastically changed.
There have been only five test
cases in Court. Colorado is con-
sidered a liberal state, and many
of its laws conformed to the ERA
beforehand. Women were given the
vote here in 1869. The big legal
changes won't come until after the
Federal ERA passes.

It is the Federal ERA which is
important; states can only change
their own particular state laws.
However, if the amendment loses in
Colorado, the ratification efforts
in the rest of the country will
"virtually stop" according to Gail
Villa, head of ERA Colorado. This
is because Colorado (considered
such a "liberal" state) has had
the ERA for four years, having
passed it with a huge margin. The
nation will be watching the Colo-
rado elections.

Two states have rescinded their
votes for the federal ERA and there
are efforts afoot in 19 other
states to rescind. If the ERA
loses in Colorado and Massachusetts
this year, the momentum behind
Stop ERA will increase and the
remaining state legislatures will
not pass the ERA. Rescinding is
not legal according to previous
test cases, but it has psycholog-
ical impact on the rest of the country.

ERA Colorado was formed by a
coalition of establishment women's
groups to fight repeal. Gail Villa
was hired to run ERA Colorado
because of her varied experience
doing Republican campaign work, and
because she ran a successful cam-
paign for Kathy Donahue for City
Council last year. She believes
in the system. When she talks a-
bout the ERA, she emphasizes that
it will help men as well as women.

The way ERA Colorado is running
its campaign is very similar to the
way the same campaign was run in
the State of New York. The
emphasis is on legal rather than
personal issues. Civil rights are
stressed and the broader political
outlook is ignored.

The organizers of ERA Colorado
are afraid of feminists damaging
their image. They are gearing the
campaign toward middle-class, well-
educated voters. They have not put
much effort into working-class,
minority, union, or rural people.
They seem to be aiming their cam-
paign towards people like them-
selves.

It has been hard to raise money
for ERA Colorado. This was true in
New York also, which raised only
1/3 of its goal. Perhaps women do
not realize their financial power
and the cost of the campaign.

Radical feminists have also not
contributed to the ERA campaign. It
has been dismissed as “reformist,”
and only liberals are expected to
fight for it. Radicals have trusted
the liberals too much to run a good
campaign. If the ERA loses, they
will be upset. Also, there could
have been better use made of this
opportunity to do outreach work with
other women. ERA has the organizing
potential for getting a foot in the
doors of all women in the country.

Flash! As of November 3, 1976, I am,
the referendum to repeal the state
equal rights amendment lost by a
vote of 145,323 to 255,146. We may
breathe easier knowing that Colorado
has remained at the forefront of the
fight for women's rights.
