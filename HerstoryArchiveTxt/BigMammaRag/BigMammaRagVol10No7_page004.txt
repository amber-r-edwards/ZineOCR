10th Annual International Conference On Human

The Conference

Judi Chamberlin

Innis College. I arrived on
Friday just as the registra-
tion table was being set up,
so there was time to sit in
the lobby and greet other
early arrivals. Old friends.
New friends. The excitement
of finding out that some people

who wanted to speak would
have a chance, that each
speaker would be limited to 3
minutes, that there would be
a timekeeper with the power
to cut people off, that there
needed to be an election to
select 6 panelists who would
speak after the open Tribunal
and who would have 6 minutes
apiece to present different
facets of the movement. But,
somehow, we got through it
and Sunday's Tribunal was a

mental patients liberation

powerful and moving event.

The setting was impressive—
the modern council chambers,
the banks of desks, spectator
seats (unfortunately not many
were occupied) rising in rows.
But it was the statements of
the participants that were
even more impressive. One af-
ter the other, people intro-
duced themselves and recited
their catalogues of horrors.
Atrocities in institutions,
in “community programs," in
"sheltered workshops." Forced
drugging. Electroshock. Leg-
itimate anger and pain defin-
ed as "mental illness" and
forcibly "treated." And here
we were, the victims, using
the only power that we had,
the power of our words and
our ideas, to fight back.

A group went to hand out
leaflets at the American Psy-
chiatric Association's forum
on nuclear war, objecting to
the shrinks somehow making
the bomb into a psychiatric
issue, rather than a moral &
political one. And then we
headed back to Innis College.
There was still more work to
be done—planning Monday's
march and demonstration at
the headquarters of the APA
convention. (Wasn't it conve-
nient that they were meeting
in Toronto too?)

Nearly everyone was excited
about the demonstration, a
chance to let out the anger &
outrage that, for many of us,
had been labelled as a "symp-
tom" of our "illness." Some
people wanted to do even more—
wanted to put their bodies on
the line to make clear that
we saw psychiatry as an evil
force that must be stopped.
Just as there had been civil
disobedience at the 1980 APA
convention in San Francisco
(when the Conference also just
happened to be meeting in the
same city), so, we felt, there
must be a similar action in

Toronto. Carefully disassoci-
ated from the Conference, this
group settled on an action—
an occupation of the Sheraton
lobby—and a name—PILL. (Psych-
iatric Inmates’ Liberation
Lobby).

The march was joyous. Hold-
ing signs ("Electroshock Kills,"
“Grow, Don't Shrink," "Stop
Forced Drugging") and chant-
ing ("1n2-3-4 We won't take
your drugs no more;" "5-6-7-8
Smash the therapeutic state")
we advanced on the Sheraton
and formed a picket line. A
giant prop hypodermic needle
was used to administer
"treatment" to various dem-
onstrators, who, as they
fell to the ground, raised

small signs that proclaimed
"Cured," as everybody cheered.
The press was out in
force, with all major news-
papers, radio, and televis-
ion stations represented.
Only the shrinks were not
very much in evidence, avoid-
ing the demonstration as much
as they could, remaining safe-
ly in the lobby, or shooting
quickly out the doors and
away from the commotion.

But the shrinks could not
avoid Monday night's occupa-
tion of the Sheraton lobby.
The APA had offered us use
of a room at the Sheraton to
hold a forum, and we used
this as an entry point. As
expected, only 3 or 4 psych-

iatrists came to the forum
(which was competing with
dozens of free cocktail part-
ies, sponsored by drug comp-
anies, medical schools, and
other bastions of the shrink
establishment), but the forum
was never seen as anything
but a tool to get us inside.
From the forum, the vigilers
proceeded to the large, or-
nate lobby, and there they
chose a spot and quickly sat
down with their signs.

As a member of the negoti-
ating committee, I was deep-
ly involved in the events of
the next several hours. Of
course, a crowd quickly gath-
ered. "Who were these scruf-
fy people," I could see the
shrinks wondering, "with
their outrageous signs?" A
leaflet had been prepared,
and copies were scattered a-
round. The APA security chief
and the hotel security chief
ordered us to leave. The po-
lice were called, ultimatums
given. The negotiating comm-
ittee called our lawyer, then
we too went off to the police
station to see what we could
do. After much waiting around,
we were allowed to join the
folks who had been arrested,
and through the hours of pro-
cessing it took before people
could be released, we were
together, jubilant at the suc-
cess of our action. (We still

have to pay back over $800—
$3 per demonstrator—in fines
and bail lent to us by our
Canadian friends).

These, then, are my impres-
sions of the Conference—frag-
mented, episodic, having miss-
ed many things that perhaps
were important to others. The
workshops I attended were ex-
cellent (I took part in sev-
eral I haven't yet mentioned,
including a women's workshop
on the cooptation of rape
crisis centers and battered
women's shelters by the ment-
al health system). The plen-
aries were often slow and cum-
bersome, but decisions were
made and acted upon.

I missed the final plenary
on Tuesday morning, at which
the decision was made that
next year's Conference would
be sponsored by the Mental
Patient's Alliance of Central
New York, and which was the
scene of probably the most up-
setting incident of the Conf-
erence—a physical attack on
one participant by another,
followed by the ejection of
the attacker. Although I was-
n't there, I have strong feel-
ings about what happened.
Physical violence against one
another is totally unaccepta-
ble to me, and I see the
ejection of the perpetrator
not as oppression (as some
charged), but as a necessary
defensive action. My sympath-
ies lie totally with the vic-
tim of the attack.

Disruption was a problem
again this year, unfortunate-
ly. Several participants in-
sisted on being heard every
time they wanted to speak,
and seemed totally uninter-
ested in listening to anyone
else. I heard some relatively
new people complain that the
Conference was dominated by a
small number of old-timers,
but what I saw was different—
old and new people working
enthusiastically together.
Our movement is not unique—
it seems there are always
some people who would rather
complain than do anything
constructive.

Process was also a problem
once again. Hours were con-
sumed in deciding, at each
plenary session, whether
there should be a fixed agen-
da (and how speakers could be
held to it), and so forth.
Process is important—one of
the basic tenets of our move-
ment is that we all need to
be heard (and listened to).

Psychiatric Oppression: Toronto, Ont.

But process questions also
detract from more substantive
decision making. (I don't
have a solution to this di-
lemma, and I don't think any-
one does.)

But out of all the disagree-
ments, all the hassling, came
(at least for me) a sense of
joyous rededication. We had
come together, had establish-
ed a functioning community
(which fought and feuded, but
also produced and celebrated),
had further defined our poli-
tics, had confronted our ene-
mies. Much credit is due to
On Our Own for finding such
an excellent site and making
(nearly) everything run
smoothly.

Next year in Syracuse!

The Arrests

Jenny Miller

On May 17, sixteen people
calling themselves the Psy-
chiatric Inmates Liberation
Lobby (PILL) held a silent
vigil in the lobby of the
Sheraton Hotel in Toronto to
protest the meeting of the
American Psychiatric Associa-
tion (APA) there. All sixteen
were arrested on charges of
trespassing. During the
protest demonstrators sat in
a circle on the floor,
holding signs assailing
such psychiatric crimes as
forced treatment of inmates
("mental patients") with
phenothiazine drugs, elec-
troshock, and lobotomy, all
of which are known to cause
permanent brain damage and
sometimes death. A large
crowd of supporters, police,
hotel security, reporters,
and smirking psychiatrists
gathered around the silent
group. After an hour and

a half, all those identifi-
ed as supporters were forced
to leave the lobby, and the
members of the vigil were
dragged and carried to
waiting police vans.

The demonstrators came
from all parts of the U.S.
to attend the 10th Interna-
tional Conference on Human
Rights and Psychiatric Op-
pression, which was being
held simultaneously with the
APA convention in Toronto.
The 10th International Con-
ference did not sponsor
PILL's action, but held
their own much larger pro-
test against the APA earlier
in the day. Eighty confer-
ence participants marched,
performed guerilla theater,
chanted and sang in front
of the Sheraton for several
hours. The most popular
chant seemed to be "Hey,
Hey, APA! How many people
did you kill today?"

These protests were not
the first time the APA has
heard from angry former
patients. In 1980, 200 par-
ticipants and friends of the
8th International Conferen-
ce on Human Rights and Psy-
chiatric Oppression demon-
strated at the APA conven-
tion in San Francisco, and
some of them formed a "hu-
man chain" to block the en-
trance to the convention
hall. On hand for both the
San Francisco and Toronto
protests was Wesley Pomer-
oy, former Police Chief of
Berkeley, and currently
head of APA security. In an
attempt to provide full co-
operation with the Toronto
demonstrators, Pomeroy off-
ered them their own work-
shop within the APA head-
quarters at the Sheraton.

The workshop was attended
by about thirty ex-inmates,
three psychiatrists, and
however many pigs cared to
watch over closed circuit
television. Halfway into
the workshop, a member of
PILL announced that all
those who planned to attend
the workshop on “alternatives
to psychiatry" should
leave, and the sixteen vigil
participants made their
exit. Pomeroy still suspec-
ted nothing when, a few
minutes later, several mem-
bers of the support commit-
tee left the room carrying
a huge pile of posters, po-
litely explaining to Pom-
eroy that they had another
meeting to attend. When news
of the sit-in reached Pom-
eroy, he reportedly turned
white and mumbled that he'd
been "betrayed."

All the participants in
the lobby liberation were
released from jail early
the next morning. The maj-
ority chose to plead guilty
and pay a $53 fine, while
some entered no plea and
