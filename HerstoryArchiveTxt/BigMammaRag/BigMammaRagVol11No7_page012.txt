Women

Stop the Strip Searches  
Campaign

Armagh, Northern Ireland -  
After the dirty protest of  
1980 and the hunger strikes  
of 1980 and 1981, women pri-  
soners in Armagh Jail are now  

armagh jail  

being subjected to forcible  
strip-searching. Since Novem-  
ber 1982 women have been  
strip-searched whenever enter-  
ing or leaving the prison.  
The searches are performed by  
groups of female and male  
prison officers, sometimes as  
many as 10. Between Nov. 9,  
1982 and March 1, 1983, 772  
strip searches have been car-  
ried out on 97 women; one wo-  
man was strip-searched 19  
times in 11 days.

In Parliament, Secretary of  
State for Northern Ireland  
James Prior defended the  
strip-searches on security  
grounds. In fact, a large  
proportion of the searches  
take place when women make  
appearances at the local  
court - a total of 30 minutes  
outside the prison.

All prisoners are subjected  
to the searches, regardless  
of age or physical condition.  
Women who have been searched  
include: a 43-year-old mother  
of three; menstruating women  
who are required to remove  
their tampons or sanitary  
pads; adolescent women held  
in Armagh's young offenders  
unit; a woman who was 9  
months pregnant; a 3-year-old  
girl visiting a prisoner.

Searches are carried out in  
small, semi-open cubicles, as  
described by a prisoner: "A  
curtain is fastened across  
the cubicle from about waist  
high to the floor. You are  
always in view of the prison  
staff who sometimes number as  
many as ten. When you are  
naked your body from the waist  
up is visible to all the pri-  
son staff in the room...you  
are told to turn completely  
round so as no part of your  
body is left unseen. Anyone  
with long hair is ordered to  
gather their hair up in their  
hands and hold it on top of  
their heads. This makes the  
entire sordid affair seem  
like a slave trade market.

Recently, three women were  
assaulted when they refused  
to strip naked. They were  

Page 14 - Big Mama Rag, July, 1983  

thrown to the ground, their  
arms and legs twisted behind  
them by the prison officers,  
sat upon and forcibly  
stripped.

The overall escalation of  
harassment of the women in-  
cludes strip-searches, soli-  
tary confinement, withdrawal  
of privileges (visits, let-  
ters and packages) and vic-  
timisation of particular wo-  
men. Far from the so-called  
peace-keeping role of the  
security forces, which in-  
cludes prison officers, the  
strip-search policy is indi-  
cative of the systematic  
sexual abuse of women in  
war time.

The Stop the Strip Search  
Campaign has been set up by  
women in London to call atten-  
tion to the deteriorating  
conditions in Armagh and to  
put an immediate end to the  
strip searches. For more in-  
formation and to send dona-

On September 31, 1982,  
Bernadette Kelly (not her  
real name), a 16-year-old  
young woman who lives in Belfast  
(Northern Ireland) was arr-  
ested. Although the charges  

‘detention’  

against her were eventually  
dropped, she was warned that  
she'd be picked up when she  
was 18, and charged again.  
This is her account of what  
happened when she was arr-  
ested, and held for two days.

"Get up Bernadette,’ a  
voice said. 'Get up,' I  
heard my sister Annmarie say  
again. Finally she shook me  
hard enough to waken me. When  
I saw a woman in a British  
army uniform I realised that  
the house was being raided.  
My mother had been in Dublin  
since Friday and wasn't due  
home until Tuesday evening.  
It was Tuesday but it was  

British patrol in a Catholic area of Belfast, N. Ireland.

In Northern Ireland Protest  

only four twenty in the  
morning.

My sisters Annmarie, aged  
twelve, and Kathleen, aged  
six, and I got dressed and  
went downstairs to my two  
brothers Ned, aged fifteen,  
and Martin, aged two. There  
were also eight or nine brits  
and a peeler. One of these  
brits approached me (I shall  
call him Smurf from now on)  
saying ‘Have you any illegal  
weapons or documents?’ I rep-  
lied 'No.'

‘Have you anything of value,  
which you want to keep in  
your possession during our  
search?!  

"Yes, they're upstairs."  
When I came down, Smurf began  
searching all the brits, then  
two of them and the peeler  
went upstairs. I followed and  
watched them 'search;' wreck  
the house would be more acc-  
urate. They put their feet  
through bedroom ceilings and  
when they found some mini-  
aturized Republican News (Sinn  
Fein's weekly paper), they  
took one of them. After  
they'd finished wrecking my  
mother's room they went into  
the girl's room, without the  
peeler's presence, and wreck-  
ed it as well as the boys’  
room. I protested at the mess  
but was ignored.

When Smurf asked me was  
there any damage I replied  
‘The front door (which had  
been kicked in), my bedroom  
ceiling and the general con-  
dition of the house.' Smurf  
then lifted my diary. I took  
it back from him. Then I was  
asked to show it to the woman  
brit; she took it from me be-  
fore I refused. I protested,  
but was told 'Stand there and  
shut your fucking mouth.' I  
protested further but finally  
gave in.

After a while they came  
back, and the woman brit  
placed her hand on my should-  
ers saying, 'I arrest you  
under Her Majesty the Queen.'  
I was taken out of the house  
where there were four sara-  
cens (army vehicles) and was  
thrown into the first one  
which drove off quickly to  
Springfield road barracks. I  
was told to wait in the Sara-  
cen while the arresting brit  
went out. The rest of them  
sat drinking a hot cup of tea,  
while I sat freezing, hungry  
and very very tired. Shortly  
the woman brit came back with  
a man. They took me into a  

international  

Strip-Searches And Illegal Arrests  

yard in the middle of the  
barracks. I was asked my name,  
address and date of birth,  
which they already knew. I  
was also asked my religion  
which I refused to give; he  
just wrote RC (Roman Catho-  
lic).

Rose McAlister is an ex-  
Armagh prisoner who has spent  
two terms in prison. She was  
released in May, 1980, after  
two years on protest for  
political status.

They then brought me into  
a room with little cubicles  
and a small curtain; they  
were like the photo machines  
at Woolworths, but smaller.  
I was taken to another room  
where all my possessions were  
taken and I was searched.  
Then another fella came in  
and tried to take a photo of  
me. I wouldn't look at the  
camera and when I did, I  
pulled a face. I was taken  
to yet another room where we  
sat until a man came in and  
told the woman brit to go and  
get her breakfast. ‘Lucky  
devil,’ I thought as my mouth  
watered and my stomach rum-  
bled. After she left, I sat  
for what seemed two hours of  
abuse, i.e., calling me names,  
degrading my character and  
family, making a laugh of my  
beliefs and countless threats.  
I was then taken to the re-  
ception desk where I made a  
complaint of verbal abuse.  
Later I thought how it was a  
waste of time. Another woman  
came up to me saying 'I arr-  
est you under section twelve  
of the Prevention of Terror-  
ism Act (you can be held for  
seven days without charge),  
and I believe you to be in-  

volved in terrorist activi-  
ties.' It rang through my  
head, seven days detention.  
We went out and got into a  
car.  

When I asked where we  
were going, ‘Castlereagh’  
(a police detention centre),  
came the reply. I went all  
weak. My legs were giving  
way beneath me, I'd heard so  
much about that place, they  
either beat you up or con-  
stantly question you.

We came to a large building  
with a wall and wire fencing  
surrounding it. I knew this  
was the dreaded Castlereagh.  
I was led to a room where my  
laces were taken and again I  
was searched and taken up-  
stairs along corridors to my  
cell. The door slammed behind  
me; the noise was like thun-  
der in the heavens. It was so  
hot. The very word ‘cell’ put  
an indescribable feeling  
through me. Later I was  
brought into a small room  
where two well-built men and  
a woman stood. 'Come in Bern-  
adette, we're just gonna take  
your fingerprints,' one of  
them said. 'I refuse to have  
my fingerprints taken until  
I've seen my solicitor.'  
"You can't do that, your  
solicitor will get in when we  
decide. That's if he gets in  
at all.

"I still refuse,' I said, as  
the woman grabbed my arm, and  
one of the men, my hand. They  
then brought me to another  
room with a door exactly the  
same as my cell door. The  
walls inside were white also,  
there was a table and four  
chairs. The woman sat facing  
me writing the unanswered  
questions and one of the men  
on my left-hand side, the  
other stood at my right with  
one of his hands on the table  
in front of me, the other on  
the back of my chair. They  

were like three starving lions  
ready to pounce on their prey.

I knew how they felt; I was  
starving too.

I was asked question after  
question. ‘Why don't you  
answer?!’ they asked. 'I don't  
want to say anything until my  
mother or solicitor is here.'

"Do you know that they  
can't get in unless we say  
so, and we can keep you here  
for seven days without seeing  
anyone?' I sat there saying  
nothing, just a few seconds  
of silence while they lit  
their cigarettes. Then the  
questions began.

They went on endlessly. I  
must have said the rosary ten  
times over. Soon I was taken  
back to my cell. I felt so  
trapped. I wanted out. Then  
back to the "Interview room."  
Questions over and over again,  
for five and a half hours.  
God did I want out of this  
place. I wanted too much to  
have something to eat and a  
good long sleep.

Soon my cell door opened  
again. I put on my shoes and  
followed the policewoman to  
a large room with a table and  
four chairs. In the corner  
was a chair and my mother was  
sitting on it. She was home;  
how I wished she could put  
her arms around me to hold me  
and make me feel safe. A large  
lump sat fixed in my throat  
as I tried to hold my tears  
back. I sat down, being in-  
formed of charges that would  
be read out and that I should  
make a statement in each one.  
My mother said to them ‘She  
has to say nothing until her  
solicitor arrives.'

"Mrs. Kelly if you don't  
keep quiet you'll be removed,  
you're giving your daughter  
bad advice."

"It's not my advice, it's  
her solicitor's."

They read out the charges;  
I repeated after each one  
‘No comment.' Twenty-four  
charges in all they said. My  
mother gave me a doubtful  
look. Before leaving my mo-  
ther was told that I wouldn't  
be questioned again unless  
she was there.

Morning. I awakened to the  
cell door opening. I got my  

breakfast then I slept, lunch,  
slept, dinner, I stayed awake.  
I was 'privileged'; I was all-  

owed to smoke a cigarette in  
the toilets ‘in case you set  
the cell on fire,' they said.  
Back in the cell I just looked  
at the walls with a blank  
mind. The cell door opened,  

a policeman told me I was  
being released. I was brought  
to the front gates, I began  
crying as I embraced my  
mother, 'Hello,' I said to  
her mate Molly. ‘Right big  
girl did you enjoy your holi-  
day?' she asked. 'Yes, I re-  
commend it to you,' I said  
laughing as we got in the  
car and drove home. Home, it  
was such a warm word. ‘I'm  
being reported, and I'm going  
to be arrested again, they  
said they would summons me,'  
I told my mother.

Later, I thanked the people  
who had come out to protest  
the morning of my arrest. It  
rained heavily that night,  
but I didn't mind - until the  
roof started leaking. The  
brits had removed a few  
slates from the roof and the  
rain came into my room. They  
had the cheek to do this af-  
ter wrecking the house and  
after they had put their foot  
through the bedroom ceiling  
and threatened to shoot my  
twelve-year-old sister. I  
thanked God that night, for  

I was one of the lucky ones  
who left Castlereagh without  
a charge.
