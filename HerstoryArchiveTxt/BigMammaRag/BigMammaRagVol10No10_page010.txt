With this kind of history

it is natural that Cuban
women gravitate more readily
toward areas of artistic ex-
pression involving the body:
gesture, song, dance, theatre,
even the plastic arts have
long proven acceptable
fields for participation.
VOICE: the all-powerful
VERB in most lands and times,
has been man’s last strong-
hold, so to speak.

By the mid-sixties half
of Cuba’s graduating doctors
were women. High percentages
were evident in other pro-
fessional fields. Women were
becoming engineers, archi-
tects, chemists and mathe-
maticians. Women work-

were

ing in the Revolutionary
Armed Forces. They were
slowly but steadily climbing
within the ranks of the
military and political organizations.
And within the art world
there were more than a few
extraordinary women. But
still there were not many
women poets - at least with
public recognition. But to-
day - some ten years
later - that situation has
changed.

An interesting historical
fact in the introduction:
The first Cuban poem written
by a woman to come down to
us... seems to have origi-
nated as a protest document
sent by Havana’s women to
Charles III of Spain, when
the Cuban forces surrendered
to the British occupation of
the city (1762). Of the poet
herself Randall tells us that

is a solitary figure - more
a participant in Cuban po-
litical history than in Cuban
letters as such."

BREAKING THE SILENCES is
divided into three sections,
Part I, "Our Living Mothers,"
older women who have basic-
ally written their important
Part II, "Our Time has
Come," poets who are mature
who have found their voices,
who have a large body of im-
portant work but who are
still young enough to be
moving with this rapidly
changing society. Poets from
whom one can still expect a
major statement. And Part III,
"We Speak Another Language,"
contains those poets, often
very young, who have been
totally formed by the revolu-
tionary ethic and the reality
of present-day Cuba.

of the book to include many
of the things I dislike about
poetry - subtle imagery,
vague nature-like references,
obscure meanings - and a
sense of hopelessness and
powerlessness about life in
general and the male/female
relationship in particular
that remain unexplained and
unexplored.
This book was rarely spe-
cific enough for me about the
everyday details of the wo-
men’s lives and their respon-
ses to it. I remain pro-
foundly ambivalent about the
content and message of this
book. On one hand, women in
Cuba have found their voices
and are breaking the silences
as the title indicates, but
what they are saying is not
clear enough for me to under-
stand the conditions of their
lives or the extent of their
struggle and visions.

Many of my questions remain

unanswered. I wondered
if the women are or were les-

Carilda Oliver Labra observes
of the small number of women
in the arts This 'lack of
tradition’ on our part is due
to one thing and one thing
only: men have made the laws
and we’ve obeyed them.

I looked for roots of ra-
dicalism in this book, for a
way out of abstractions and
into stark reality. I wanted
a celebration of woman-iden-
tified womanhood - a show of
force and power. I wanted a
poem to scream my pain and
vision as if shouting it from
the rooftops. It is for this
that I need poetry.

I found it in INTRODUCTION
AND APOLOGY by black Cuban
poet Georgina Herrera,

Forgive me Western World

for transforming your laws,

for not asking permission
for what I do,

for not following your
ancient guideline,

for daring to hold opinions,

walk upright, abandon
my tail,

refuse to recognize in the
tree and its branches

the house where your
Christian god

would flatter me

Forgive me, all of you,

the great men of other
times,

you who decided life should
be divided into days,

weeks, months, years,

you who approved that fine
law

"for the rich, wine,

for the poor, blows."

Forgive me this almanac

today and forever.

I speak without permission

but with rights,

and, it goes without saying
in my own way...

The outstanding poem of this
anthology is BLACK WOMAN by
black Cuban poet Nancy More-
jon. It is and remains a mo-
numental testament to the
dignity and struggle of the
African women who crossed
these waters to become the
slaves of the Americas:

I can smell the spray of
the sea they made me

I remember the night.

Not the sea itself could
remember.

But I can't forget the
first Alcatraz I saw.
The clouds, high, innocent
on-the-spot witnesses.

Neither have I forgotten
my lost coast, nor my
mother tongue.

They brought me here and
here I have lived.

And because I worked like
a beast

I was born again,
here.

To how many a Mandinga epic

I turned.

I rebelled.

His Mercy purchased me in
a public square.

I embroidered His Mercy's
shirt and bore him a
male son.

My son had no name.

And His Mercy died at the
hands of a perfect
English lord.

I roamed.

This is the land where I
suffered face down and
whiplash.

Bucking for rivers.

Under her sun I planted
and gathered

harvests I did not eat.

A barracon was my home.

I myself carried the stones

to build it,

but I sang to the natural
rhythms of this country's
birds.

I rose up.
I worked much more.

I gave greater touchstone
to my ancient song and
hope.

I built a world here.

++. Now I Am. Only today
do we have and make.

Nothing is lost to us.

Ours the land.

Ours the sea and sky.

Ours the magic and rage...

I urge the feminist press to
reprint this poem widely and
in its entirety.

The poetry that struck me
the most was the work in
Part II, neither the youngest
nor the oldest group. I did
not find every poem in this
anthology to be an inspiration
or a work of art but I did
find the selections to be at
all times human, honest,
readable, and basically un-
pretentious. The women never
fall into the trap that men
lapse into by trying to seem
objective, profound and mean-
ingful in a way that is inac-
cessible to ordinary humans.
The poets in this volume are
real people.

Glimpses of poetry caught
my attention in Part III.

-WRITE REVIEW

Big Mama Rag,

declares in NOW, AT THE HOUR
OF OUR LIFE,
+++A woman between pain
and trust
makes ready to live.
+++Men and cities live
within her...

In PRAISE OF FUTURE she says,

Of all the days of my life,
I would choose that which
is not yet come...

This last line best descri-
bed the mood evoked for me
by the anthology. I am not a
student of Latin American
History and the Cuban revo-
lution. I only know that
significant progress has
been made in Cuba since the
revolution and that serious
and unanswered criticism

has been leveled against it.

The status of gay people
and women seem particularly
questionable from a revolu-
tionary standpoint. Are wo-
men freer now? Are lesbians
and gay men accepted into
the mainstream of post-revo-
lutionary Cuban society? The
omissions in this book fright-
en me and cause me grave
concern. What are the things
Cuban women are not saying,
not writing about, maybe not
acknowledging in themselves
and their culture?

I emerge from BREAKING THE
SILENCES with a sense of
newness and awakening but
also with a sense of great
mystery. Who are those women,
really? What are their secret
dreams, what do they reach
for in their quietest mo-
ments? What are the things
they cannot have and do they
wonder why, and why not?

There are unchartered wa-
ters and undeveloped themes
in these poems and authors.
My response to the book is
that I want more, more blood
and guts and tears and more
specific accounts and facts,
as well as more joy.

My plea to the writers of
today and tomorrow: Don't
hide behind the words. Jump
through them.
