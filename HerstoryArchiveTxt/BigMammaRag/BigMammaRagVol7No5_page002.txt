Women Picket the “News”

"The (women's) movement was born amid  
the sounds of the morning wash being  
automatically battered and dried in  
the laundry rooms of suburbia."

"The geniuses of the women's movement  
concocted ideas that were uniformly  
stupid and boring."

"Every season brought a new liberation-  
ist genius spouting a goofball  
idea whose lifespan would be about  
equal to that of a summer fly, and  
so every one autumn would come."

". . . 'the women' were never very  
deep. It is doubtful that any move-  
ment in history ever went so far on  
so few ideas.”

These are quotes from an article  
reprinted in the editorial pages of  
the Sunday, May 13 (Mothers' Day)  
issue of the Rocky Mountain News.

On Wednesday, May 23, women picketed  
the Rocky Mountain News from 3:30  
to 6:00 p.m. protesting the “anti-  
woman" policies of the News and other  
establishment media. The picket was  
in direct response to the News  
reprinting of two pages of excerpts  
from a book entitled Public Nuisances  
by R. Emmett Tyrell, Jr., editor of  
the ultra-conservative publication,  

The American Spectator. The article,  
entitled "Women of the Fevered Brow,”  
ridicules and trivializes the women's  
movement.

Picketers demanded that the Rocky  
Mountain News “allow equal space for  
a feminist rebuttal to Mr. Tyrell's  
article, revise its malicious editor-  
ial policy towards the women's move-  

ment, and in the future check the acc-  

uracy of its articles concerning the  
women's movement.

Mr. Jay Ambrose who is in charge  
of the editorial pages for the  
Rocky Mountain News said that the  

News will be running a page of letters  
received in response to the article  
(see RMN, Friday, May 25) and may  
consider running a series of “femin-  
ist-oriented" articles sometime in  
the future.

Commission on Women Killed:  
Conservative Backlash Cited

On May 10, 1979 the Republican-  
controlled House State Affairs Commit-  
tee voted 6-5 to kill the Colorado  
Commission on Women. The State Senate  
had voted 30-3 in favor of continuing  
the Commission earlier this session.  
The Commission was created by Govern-  
or John Love in 1965 and became a  
State Agency in 1972. The Colorado  
Commission on Women has been involved  
in a wide variety of activities such  
as drafting legislation regarding  
sexual assault, supporting the  
Colorado Displaced Homemaker Act, con-  
ducting workshops on grants writing  
and funding sources, conducting a  
self-help program for women in  
southwestern Colorado, preparing and  
publishing a handbook on women's  
legal rights in Colorado (Survival  
and the Law for the Colorado Woman),  

and many other projects too numerous  

to mention.

The commission is appropriated  
$40,450 per year in State funds  
which is to cover two staff people  
and other expenses of the commission.  
There is a volunteer staff which  
donates more than $50,000 a year in  
service to the Commission and addit-  
ional funds have been obtained from  
federal and private sources.

"If Coloradans roll over and play  

dead on this issue, they don't deserve  

the benefits of over 5000 hours per  
year donated for the work of the  
Commission by community leaders, home-  
makers, and working women," said  
Ellen Wachs, director of the Commiss-  
ion.

The main reason for the Commission's  
defeat in the House State Affairs  
committee may have been an intense  
lobby by ultra-conservative members of  

the Colorado Eagle Forum and Colorado  
Right-To-Life Committee.

They called  
the Commission on Women “a feminist  
political machine." They claim that  
the members of the Commission support  
abortion, legalized prostitution, and  
other “radical causes," to the exclu-  
sion of women who hold other view-  
points.

Josie Heath, Commission chairperson,  
told the Denver Post that the Commis-  
sion had been aligned with radical  
causes as a result of their role in  
organizing a women's conference in  
Boulder two years ago. Platforms  
endorsing lesbian rights and legalized  
prostitution were adopted at that con-  
ference.

It is important to note that this is  
not the first attack waged on the  
women's movement by conservative  
groups such as Right-To-Life and  

the Eagle Forum. In the last few  
years these same groups have probably  
been responsible for the defeat of the  
ERA in some states and nation-wide  
attacks on abortion clinics which have  
resulted in millions of dollars worth  
of damage and injury to clinic  
workers and patients. They have not  
only threatened the lives of those  
who work in abortion clinics, but  
also members of clinic workers' fam-  
ilies.

At press time it was learned that  
Governor Richard Lamm, a strong  
supporter of the Colorado Commission  
on Women, has stated that continuing  
the Commission will be on his call  
for the 1980 Assembly in order to  
give lawmakers a chance to revive the  
Commission. If this effort is not  
successful, the Commission on Women  
will close its doors on July 1, 1980.

RIGHTS, NOT ROSES  
Fran Day

A Mother's Day Rally, sponsored by  
Central Denver National Organization  
for Women, was held Sunday, May 13 at  
the State Capitol in Denver. The  
theme, "Rights, not Roses", urged  
ratification of the Equal Rights  
Amendment. Speakers included Leonore  
Walker, Fern Latino, Laura DeHerrera,  
Angie Heaton, Cindy Kahn and Kathy  
Garbini. Feminist music was provided  
by Harry O'Boyle.

Judy Summers, one of the organizers  
of the rally said, "The ERA is not  
anti-family or anti-motherhood; rather  
all women need the protection of the  
ERA--this includes homemakers and  
mothers as well as single working  
women. We have fought long and hard  
for the ERA and we will continue to  
fight."
