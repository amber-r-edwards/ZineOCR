In Search of Solutions: Those Who Know

which is staffed entirely by
a team of dynamic and radical
women.

A nation-wide program of
immunisation has been imple-
mented. Many villages have no
pipes for water yet, and at
best the supply of piped wat-
er is intermittent, so infor-
mation about sanitation pro-
cedures is especially impor-
tant, as is basic nutritional
knowledge.

In the past plantation work-
ers and women subsisted main-
ly on a starch diet of yams,
breadfruit, green bananas
and plantain, supplemented by
highly prized and priced im-
ported American chicken wings
and canned corned beef. Lack
of calcium is still a problem
and at the moment Grenada
relies heavily on imported
dairy milk from Eastern Eur-
ope. There is still a small
incidence of malnutrition but
as the island has an abundant
variety of fish and green
vegetables, it aims eventually
to become self-sufficient in
food. Unfortunately, Grenada
is dependent on foreign cur-
rency to build a freezing
plant for local fish and to
develop agro-industries such
as local fruit juices and
jellies. So whilst Cuba has
donated four small trawlers,
there is still a need for aid
and tourism to provide the
cash means for Grenada to
process its own foodstuffs,
feed itself and develop a

diversified export market de-
termined by its own economic
needs.

"PROTECT OUR CHILDREN - OUR
MAJOR RESOURCE' (SCHOOL
CROSSING SIGN)

At the Ministry of Health
we were able to look at stat-
istics which backed up infor-
mation we had already gather-
ed. The island has a 78% ill-
egitimacy rate (the fact that
the word is used is an indi-
cation of old western cultur-
al values still being used at
a bureaucratic level). Many
women start to have children
as young as 15, and give
birth to an average of six
or seven before their mid-
twenties. Women's relation-
ships with men, often long-
term, have not necessarily
given men any economic res-
ponsibility for children.
This helps create a situation
where men can move between
two to three families. Many
women have coped by subsis-

tence farming and by selling
any small surplus in the mar-
ket. There has also been a
certain amount of pressure to
have large families as an in-
surance in old age which in
the past came very early be-
cause of the poor diet, and
exploitative work. For women
this was often exacerbated by
having had many pregnancies.
At the moment the Grenada
Family Planning Association
is part of the International
Planned Parenthood Federation,
although there are plans to
nationalize it. Information
about contraception has been
scarce, and although coils
(IUDs) are most widely used,
Depo Provera, the injectable
contraceptive, was used too.
Only after our return from
Grenada have we heard it's
been banned. Its use seemed
odd to us, because of the
help and influence of the
Cuban medical system in Gren-
ada which has consciously re-
jected the use of Depo Pro-
vera in Cuba. Safe contracep-
tion is crucial, but for wo-
men to choose it, there must
also be a change in the eco-
nomic and social status of
women so that they do not
have to depend on their child-
ren's support for long-term
security. Legislation about
employment of women, the fact
that women are now visible in
almost every sphere of work,
and the excellent day
care provisions we saw, are
major steps on the way.
Women traditionally gave
birth at home with the sup-
port and assistance of other
women. The infant mortality
rate is the same as in Bri-
tain (about 14 per thousand)
which puts an interesting
perspective on British tech-
nologically oriented child-
birth! Now, for the first
confinement and after the
fifth, women are encouraged
to go into hospital...some-
thing many of them resist
doing. In hospital or out,

natural childbirth is the
norm and breastfeeding is
encouraged.

STAY UP, SISTERS

An almost unbelievable de-
gree of change has been
brought about by and in the
lives of women in the last
three years and it shows. It
shows in the way women walk
on the street, heads held
high, and the confidence and
cogency with which they speak

at meetings. Men still make
sexist advances but are ob-
viously getting used to get-
ting a strong response and
tend not to persist after the
first attempt. It's becoming
more common to see men taking
care of toddlers and small
babies.

Popular art burgeons - in
paintings by the roadside, in
poetry, plays and music - and
much of it is feminist. Work-
ers' Enlightenment is a group
of agricultural workers,
teachers and mothers, 80%
female, who produce revolu-
tionary drama with wit, zest
and political bite. In Gren-

ada women are still strug-
gling and there's a long way
to go, but they're celebrat-
ing too.

We are the backbone of the
family

Without us there will be no
prosperity

We have begun a mighty motion

In every section of this land

We'll unite, organise and
build.

No more will we be second-
class

Or hi there! you pretty lass

We are Grenada's strength,
its energy

Join us to fight the enemy

Come sisters, let's unite,
organise and build.

History Of Imperialism In Grenada

AMERICAN ‘DIRTY TRICKS' IN
‘THE CARIBBEAN

The Reagan administration
is trying to starve Grenada
out by blocking international
aid; anything that threatens
their influence in the Carib-
bean is a legitimate target.
Various tactics are used to
destabilise the revolutionary
government...when we were
there a completely erroneous
rumour swept the country;
news that a ship that had
just docked in St. George's
Harbour was carrying the bo-
dies of dead Grenadian sold-
iers who died in Nicaragua
flew around the tiny island,
creating anxiety and mistrust.
In fact Grenada sends no
troops to Nicaragua. Two
government officials have
been killed in a bomb attack.
Dengue fever which is not na-

tive to the Caribbean is now
running at 31.7% in Carriacou. 
People believe that the
disease was introduced by the
American CIA as happened in
Cuba.

In September 1981, informa-
tion was received about a
USA and NATO military maneu-
ver on the island of Vieques
off the coast of Puerto Rico,
code-named ‘Ocean Venture '81.
Aspects of this operation
suggest that it was in prep-
aration for an invasion of
Grenada. Rear Admiral of the
Caribbean contingency joint
task force, Robert R. McKen-
zie, describes Nicaragua,
Cuba and Grenada as 'practi-
cally one country' and a
‘political-military problem’
and has stated that the ob-
jective of Ocean Venture '81
was to 'reinforce in the eyes

and minds of those watching
our military commitment a-
round the world - to give an
example of one fact of the
US capability to respond in
the Caribbean Basin.'

On our visit we covered
most of the island in our
travels and contrary to what
has been reported in the me-
dia here we saw no signs that
Grenada was a military state.
Apart from a couple of anti-
quated anti-aircraft guns
Grenada is woefully under-
equipped in comparison to the
United States. With the ever

hasn't written since, so we
don't know her status now.

‘The institution won't give in-
formation, and as far as we
know her situation is the
same, if not worse. They had
no intention of letting her
out of the hole. It would be
important to revive publicity
about her nightmare and let
them know she is not forgotten
and that we want to know what
is happening to her. Any at-
tempts you can make, writing
or calling the correctional
authorities, etc., sending
letters demanding to know of
her safety, etc. would be
crucial. Maybe you can think
of other ways to organize
support, research an article,
whatever. This sister must not
be left alone.

Well, that's about it for
now. Just wanted to get the
latest info to you and also,
I'm very glad you're printing
stuff we don't get to read
anywhere else. Stuff like the
Anti-repression conference is
real important to know about,
so we can know for ourselves
what it's about...the ex-
changing of views, criticisms,
strategies is such an import-
ant process and I often feel
angry that feminist presses
censor a lot of this informa-
tion, because of looking pol-
itically incorrect, not want-

I really look to BMR for that
kind of exchange and only
hope you will continue to put
it out for our mutual growth.

Smashing Stereotypes

Dear Lori:

As always, finding BMR in
my mailbox helped me get
through another month of op-
pression with the feeling I
wasn't alone. I especially
liked the coverage of the
National Conference Against
Repression because it brought
up questions of survival,
unity, differences, the pl-
ace of feminism in political
movements, the need for con-
stant self-criticism and how
destructive defensiveness can
be in understanding different
positions. It also made me
think of occurrences when de-
fending one's ideology is es-
sential for survival.

The layout of this issue
irritated me a little in pl-
aces. For example, your mov-
ing response to Kathleen
Mavoureen's letter was hidden
back on page 22 so I didn't
get to it for 16 pages. I
wrongly assumed that there
was no comment on her message
because below her words it
merely said, "more letters on
page 22". When I finally made
it that far I suddenly felt
very close to you. I wondered
if we were in the same nut
house because your experienc-
es with the student psych.
techs. were nearly identical
with mine. We also made up
stories for their benefit and
our amusement. But I also
hated them for harassing in-
mates with their stupidity.
Often one of us would end up
in seclusion because we'd

their own and their country's
future.
THE BLOODLESS REVOLUTION
After 250 years of colonial-
ism and 29 years under a cor-
rupt dictator, Gairy, the
people of Grenada were left
in poverty and fear and near-
ly half the population were
effectively illiterate. Gren-
ada was under direct British
colonial rule until 1974,
when it gained a nominal in-
dependence, still employing
capitalist oriented British
law in its courts and an ed-
ucational curriculum which
glorified the adventures of
British imperialism. In 1968,

Grenada imported half of all
its commodities from the UK,
Canada and the US, and a fur-
ther quarter from other Com-
monwealth countries. At the
same time, three quarters of
exports also went to wealthy
western countries. Health and
education services were gross-
ly inadequate and women often
had large numbers of children
very young and reared them
unsupported. The Gairy regime
called itself a parliamentary
democracy but not only were
elections rigged, also what
could be said in parliament
was strictly controlled. Cor-

taken all of their "wisdom"
we could stand. I don't know
who was more cruel, them or

the conscientious objectors.
The irony was that none of

us wanted to be there and
probably all of us were fri-
ghtened.

I want to thank you for
responding to the film and
the Mavoureen letter. I think
politically conscious ex/in-
mates are fortunate that you
are a part of the BMR collec-
tive because you care so much
about smashing stereotypes
of who we are and understand
the issues of psychiatric vi-
olence more clearly than wo-
men who haven't been there.

I hope we can meet in person
sometime instead of through
the mail.

It's unfortunate women
filmmakers have not made a
political statement with a
documentary on conditions in-
side psychiatric prisons.
“The Road I Took To You" is
a good video dealing with
alternatives to incarceration
but it does not go behind
locked doors as "Hurry Tomor-
row" does. Because this film
was so close to my experienc-
es as a woman, as a lesbian
(despite the fact it was a
male ward) I could only inter-
pret Mavoureen's response as
ignorance. Not only do I think
she never saw the film but
further believe she knows no-
thing of the psychiatric in-
mate's liberation movement or
considers it meaningless in
comparison to the feminists
(who of course are superior
to all). Her words saddened
me because I believe her op-
inions are shared by the maj-
ority in the anti-patriarchy
movement.

I don't know why the life
of a 19-year-old black youth
who was locked up, heavily
drugged and beaten by white
professionals is so unimport-
ant to the letter-writer that
she thinks he should be put
to death (by drowning) for
trespassing; I can't underst-
and why she finds it necess-
ary to respond to Richard Co-
hen's honest presentation of
conditions on the inside with
death threats to him (again
by drowning). Maybe she's a
psych. tech. student.

I obviously recognize his
contribution to ex/inmates in
very different ways than Ms.
Mavoureen. I'm happy Richard
is around. I remember one of
the benefit showings he gave
for Network Against Psychiat-
ric Assault when he couldn't
pay his rent either and the
phone and utility companies
were sending him nasty notes.
This wouldn't have happened
if his film distributor didn't
steal his work and the
theater owners didn't rip him
off at every turn. (One in
Palo Alto even threatened to
send a hit man after him if
he made any more trouble.)
But then I'm sure working for
BMR you know from experience
that radical political state-
ments are neither profitable
nor welcomed by those in po-
wer.

As I've mentioned before I
appreciate your consistent
coverage of issues important
to women in cages. BMR still
stands out in the feminist
media for its commitment to
stopping psychiatric violence
against people.

In struggle,
Dee dee NiHera
