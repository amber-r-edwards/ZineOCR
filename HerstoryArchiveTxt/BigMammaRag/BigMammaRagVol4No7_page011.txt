Summer Solstice Celebrated in N.M.

Clare Strawn

The New Mexico solstice celebra-
tion varies in atmosphere from year

to year, but at the same time retains

the ritual familiarity of a meeting
ground for old friends and new, a

centering for traveling dykes and a
change-over of cycles. Solstice '76

was in keeping with these traditions.

Fewer women showed up this year,

probably owing to rumors of the "kil-

ler plague" and a false report that
the campground was closed because of
a large forest fire nearby. The
campground was reserved for a shor-
ter period than previously, only a
few days before and after the 21st,
because the forest service asked for
a fee which was collected from the
campers in the form of a $2.00 dona-
tion. It is unfortunate that many
of us, myself included, have to func-
tion according to the man-made week
rather than the earth's cycles and
had to leave Sunday before the real
celebration on Monday night. There
was plenty of opportunity for gath-
ering, however, as the extreme fire
danger ruled out bonfires except in
the central commons area.

Crystal, a 12-year-old, started
her first period on Saturday and we
were honored to create with her a
ritual, welcoming the element of
blood and her passage into womanhood.

About 50 women circled around a bon-
fire, forming a symbolic menstrual
hut, while her friends drew from the
Navajo and women's heritage for the
ceremony. We then celebrated the

other women who were bleeding, sang
"The Bloods" and danced.

An early solstice ritual was plan-
ned on Sunday night for the women

Calif. Mental Patients Sit-In

Some twenty ex-mental patients
walked into California Governor
Jerry Brown's office - and were
still there three weeks later.

The sit-in was organized by the
Network Against Psychiatric Assault
(NAPA) and Women Against Psychiatric
Assault (WAPA) to protest forced
work in mental hospitals and to de-
mand the right to refuse treatment.
The sit-in began as a one-day action
but once there, the group of women
and men decided to remain in the
governor's Sacramento office until
they won a response to their de-
mands.

"First," explains NAPA, "all men-
tal patients must be given the ri-
ght to refuse treatment. The most
common treatment is forced medica-
tion; each patient should have the
absolute right to refuse prescribed
drugs such as Thorazine, Stellazine,
Prolixin, Quide, and Haldol.

"Secondly, no patient should be
forced to work under the guise of
therapy. Throughout California's
State Hospital system more than one
million hours of slave labor is done
by incarcerated patients annually.
This includes cleaning toilets,
scrubbing floors, and grounds-keep-
ing.

"Thirdly, any patient who chooses
to work should be paid the minimum
wage."

On July 6, the California Secre-
tary of Health and Welfare held a
press conference to announce the

formation of a task force to inves-
tigate the activists’ three demands
- but reporters from Madness Network
News, the NAPA newspaper, were not
allowed to attend the press brief-

ing.

NAPA sees two possible routes to-
wards the ultimate abolition of for-
ced drugging and forced work in men-
tal institutions. One is the intro-
duction of a bill to that effect in
the California state legislature -
already written by the Coalition —
Against Forced Treatment, which in-
cludes the ACLU, the NAPA Legal Pro-
ject, the National Organization for
Women, and others. The Coalition has
collected over 10,000 signatures
supporting such a bill, but it can-
not find a legislator to sponsor it.

NAPA hopes that the governor will
either help to sponsor such legis-
lation or order his Director of
Health to issue new regulations for
all public and private mental hospi-

tals in the state, which the health
administrator has refused to do for
over a year. So far there is no in-
dication that Brown will support
either move.

NAPA urges people to send letters
to Governor Brown showing support
for its three demands. Send messages
to Governor Jerry Brown, State Cap-
itol Building, Sacramento, CA,
95814.

SWP Office Ransacked

The Denver Socialist Workers
Party Headquarters at 1381 Kalamath
St. has undergone its second attack
within the past few months. In
April of this year the building
housing the SWP campaign head-
quarters and SWP's Militant Book-
store was the victim of a rifle
shooting which injured no one but
which brought about considerable
property damage to the Socialist
Workers Party.

In July, SWP was victim to a
burglary involving the theft of
leaflets, correspondences, member-

ship lists and financial budgets.
None of the expensive office

machinery such as the electric type-

writer, the mimeo machine, or the
tape recorder were stolen or tam-
pered with, however.

An alleged FBI informer and
ex-SWP member, Tim Redfearn, volun-
tarily came forward with the
files which were returned to the
party on July 16th. The Socialist
Workers Party has filed suit
against the FBI, asking for damages
up to $37 million.

who had to leave, but according to a
friend, it was disrupted by panic
surrounding the arrival of a truck
of men in the lower driveway. Women
talked of whistle alarms and self
defense and finally sent a delega-
tion to talk with them. Although
drinking, they were not drunk as was
assumed and they reportedly had no
intentions of disturbing the camp.
Later, they left, the ritual procee-
ded, and those perturbed by the ad-
venture kept vigil watch. Question:
Are a handful of men really that
threatening to us or were the women
looking for a vent for their own
hostilities?

Many women left Monday so only a-
bout 50 women participated in the
main solstice celebration which fea-
tured fire dancing and drums.

In spite of the many hassles, I
(and I'm sure many others) had the
rejuvenating and growing experience
we had come for. Along with thanks
to the Albuquerque women for making
arrangements, we might add the sug-
gestion that the location be moved
next year to try to avoid similar
hassles with men. I find the pil-
grimage, the tradition of ritual and
regrouping of friends and love at
solstice very reinforcing; maybe
I'll meet you there next year.

Steinem
Appearance
Protested

Women from the Woman to Woman
School class, “Feminist Revolution"
and other interested women participa-
ted in a protest against the appear-
ance of Gloria Steinem at the Univer-
sity of Colorado on June 18th. The
women set up a table in the hallway
adjacent to where Steinem was speak-
ing and passed out leaflets, discuss-
ed their viewpoint with passersby
and had other literature regarding
both Ms. magazine and Gloria Steinem
available at the table. The leaflet,
which was drafted by members of the
class, reads in part as follows:

IS THIS LIBERATION?

Gloria Steinem is here today
as a media-created "leader" of the
Women's Liberation Movement. We as
radical feminists have serious
questions about where she, and Ms.
magazine are leading us. As President
editor and founder of Ms., we hold
Gloria Steinem accountable for the
politics of the magazine. Therefore
this is not a personal criticism of
Ms. Steinem but of Ms. style feminist
politics:

1. Class Bias - Ms. caters to middle
and upper class women. Ads, feature
stories, covers, and news are geared
almost exclusively towards liberal,
educated, professional, white, heter-
osexual women. Ms. takes upper-class
privilege and values for granted.
But the majority of women in this
country are not corporation execs,
professionals, lawyers, doctors, or
artists. Most women work at boring,
underpaid jobs or work as housewives
for no pay at all.

2. Ms. America or the

"Liberty" is a mirage of a liberated
woman, a goal for feminists to try to be.
It is not possible for any woman in
this society to be liberated, but a
few tokens may get a few choice jobs
in management or government as a re-
sult of the myth of the Individual
Solution, the Personal Solution,
rather than fighting together with
other women, as a solution to sexism.

3. Who's got the power here? Ms. says
that women are oppressed by "sex role
8" or "society." This vagueness com-
fortably avoids the whole issue of
power. Men don't rape, kill, beat,
underpay, lie to and exploit women--
they're just victims of their sex
roles--"equally oppressed," the line
goes, and the logical conclusion to
draw is that men will just give up
the power and male privilege when
they see the light. This is wishful
thinking. We as women have had to
fight for every single right and re-
form of the past 100 years, and will
have to struggle - together - for
whatever we hope to gain in the fut-
ure.

4. Over-emphasis on electoral poli-
tics - We do not believe women's needs
can be met through the ballot box.
For example, it took women 50 years
just to get the vote. After that, it
took 50 years to get it on the bal-
lot, and in this, the Year of the
Woman, the ERA may still be repealed.
Therefore we have little faith in the
vote as a means of change, and more
faith in grassroots organizing of
women's groups around local issues
in their ordinary lives.

5. Unanswered questions - This refers
both to Ms. Steinem and to Ms....

Redetookings, a New York radical
feminist group, did research that
suggests Steinem may have worked
closely with the CIA in the past.
Questions also were raised about the
funding of Ms. Steinem has not repli-
ed directly to these questions to our
satisfaction.
