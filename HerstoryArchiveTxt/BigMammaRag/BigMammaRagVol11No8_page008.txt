Women Battalions In El Salvador...The

(Reprinted from Outwrite, Oxford House, Derbyshire St., London E2, ENGLAND.)

El Salvador suffers one of the most horrendous forms of capitalist exploitation, for decades its people neglected and treated simply as a ‘wealth producer machine' to benefit the ruling class and the USA's Imperialism.

This super-exploitation has created extreme poverty, illiteracy and malnutrition. Out of 1,000 children, 60 die when born and 40 during the first year of their lives. As early as 1927 people started to organize. Faribundo Marti fought to unite peasants and urban workers who together with intellectuals started the long battle against oppression. By the '70s many more grassroots organizations were formed. ANDES (Asociación Nacional de Educadores de El Salvador), the Teachers Association was set up. 70% of this union are women and they have been in the lead of the rebellious movement.

Commander Ana Maria, second in command of the Popular Liberation Army Faribundo Marti was one of the founders of the teachers union. Right from the beginning it has played a very important role in the insurrection, through organizing strikes and demonstrations, and many of them now are in the armed ranks of the revolution.

Ana Maria was murdered by men who are trained, armed and paid by the USA. The puppet government of El Salvador is carrying out mass killings among civilians in towns and in the countryside. On the border of El Salvador and Honduras, the army is killing people who are trying to seek refuge. They have been bombed with NAPALM insecticides (to paralyze human muscles) with the direct help of Yankee Imperialism.

"There aren't any words to describe these massacres ... on the pain we feel.” A.M.E.S. (El Salvador's Women's Association), fighting alongside the Revolutionary forces to liberate the country and women, calls upon all women's organizations around the world to support their heroic and just struggle.

Alma Latina from Outwrite talked to a woman representative from AMES. She talked of El Salvador women, their difficulties and gains, and their will to fight. Women in El Salvador are optimistic, and with international support victory will come sooner. During 1980 alone more than 9,000 people were killed in El Salvador. According to the Archdiocese of San Salvador, 80% of the killings were committed by the Death Squad, the secret Anti-Communist Army and Orden. All these organizations function illegally but with full support from the Army and protection from the government. To understand women's role in the National Liberation Movement one must get to know about the current economic, social and political situation El Salvador people live under.

-Teresa Hope/Outwrite AMES Interviewed

Alma: In the beginning the Guerrilla Movement came from the middle classes, mainly of students. How did it grow from an almost exclusive movement to a national rebellion against US Imperialism, the repressive Armed forces, and the upper classes?

AMES: From 1927-1930 Compañero Faribundo Marti started to form the Workers Communist Party not only with middle class people who fancy themselves as better thinkers than the peasants, but also with the urban and rural workers, to change the capitalist regime. Lots of petty landlords gave up their status and worked with the peasants, and many middle class people got involved through the church, on humanitarian terms. But our movement consists of ‘working class’ and peasant people.

Alma: I don't want to sound too much of a feminist, but the value of women's participation has been enormous, e.g. in the triumph of the Nicaraguan revolution. I feel women's strengths are endless—the fact that women have to run the home, work for a living, bring up children and carry a rifle all at the same time is too much. I've seen posters portraying women in all the mentioned roles so as to glamorize women's oppression to promote revolution. I think it is unfair, because the revolution is costing women three times as much as it costs men.

AMES: We know that in Latin America women work very hard—women have to keep the home together and go to work outside. Here the employers take advantage, because in El Salvador female labor is underpaid. Women get 35% less than men for the same work without any social benefit. For so many years, women have struggled in trade unions, in the countryside seizing land...

It is true, it is a triple job for us as you pointed out. The men say "I am going to the mountains to fight..." They don't say, "How are WE going to manage"; they simply say "I am going..." A woman can only participate if she can leave her children with the grandparents.

But women are decisive. By 1974 the Teachers' Association was formed, 70% of them women. But in all the strikes and marches they organize, the women had to drag their children with them because the men do not cooperate.

Alma: What are the plans for the future? Do you think women in El Salvador need an autonomous women's organization? I, as a feminist, don't trust Women's Liberation to men... I mean sometimes the men simply sabotage women's participation and do not make an effort to ease the way for women.

In Zimbabwe, for example, women who took part in the Liberation struggle have been forced back into the good old home, while the men who fought side by side with the women are occupying administrative offices.

AMES: Yes, I think it is very important to have an autonomous women's organization, to bring about changes specifically for us. Although when women join the people's movement and the politico-military organizations we are given the opportunity to participate actively.

Our association AMES was formed in 1978. We have housewives, trade unionists, teachers, students, workers and women from political organizations. AMES has been raising women's consciousness for 5 years now. We know that when victory comes, we won't have all of our problems solved. When we triumph, we shall start to fight more than ever for our own cause and we will present to the revolutionary government a complete set of concrete demands.

Alma: Tell me a bit about Commandante Ana Maria. As far as I can see, her murder was a CIA job. What type of woman was she? What influence did she have on the women in El Salvador, who do the women in El Salvador blame for her death?

AMES: Ana Maria was a woman fighting for the people's interests. She founded the teachers association and was a leader who started the struggle, and incorporated many women and men into it. We received the news of her death and were shattered...she was the main organizer...her example is so valuable to us. We feel the least we can do now is to increase our struggle. We know women can do more than housework.

We accuse the CIA and the Reagan government for her death. She was too dangerous for them.

Alma: The fact that she was murdered in such a vicious brutal way (she was stabbed too many times) indicates the hatred they have for women fighters. In Latin America when anybody rebels against oppression they kill you. When it is a woman the punishment is worse. Ana Maria was not only fighting for her people's liberation but she was also rebelling against women's traditional role, so she had to pay for that as well. Do you agree?

Revolutionary Forces For Liberation

AMES: I very much agree with you. For the Latin American men, Machismo is their main ideology, and to see a woman defeating thousands of men is a huge blow to their ego. To some extent they must have thought her an intruder (politics are for men only?)

At the front line, there is a Women's military school, and these women have given huge blows to the enemy, they can't stand it. That's why they are repressing all the women in El Salvador now.

Alma: What are the politics behind women-only battalions? Is it because there aren't many men?

AMES: No it is not that. We make up 55% of El Salvador's population, we are not a minority. The object of this school is to train women, politically and militarily, because women have never been involved in any of this before, unlike men.

So women who have participated right from the beginning in the armed struggle teach the new women, thousands of them from everywhere, peasant and urban women, young and old.

Nobody is discriminated against. They all go and offer their strengths and take part at all levels in the struggle.

Alma: The USA Government has always denied their intervention in Latin America even though there is plenty of evidence that they have. What do you say?

AMES: The El Salvador people are fighting against USA Imperialism, against an Army which is armed and trained by the USA, and a government which is sustained by the USA. You must tell the people how Human Rights are so violated in El Salvador. We ask the people of all the nations to press the USA to abandon their Imperialistic aggression.

The USA is intervening directly. They look upon El Salvador as a very ‘strategic’ point. They think they possess Latin America, they say they can't afford to lose El Salvador, they have put so much money in Latin America...if we win (and we are) WE WON'T PAY IT BACK, because it isn't our debt...

They are frightened, they know all of Latin America will know that only armed struggle will bring liberation, to end poverty, illiteracy, and exploitation.

The liberal press are also following Reagan's plan, by presenting the war as one between equals, without analyzing or presenting the hard reality of the people in Latin America and the vast economic interests the USA has in our countries. I think the people of Britain should press their government not to support Reagan. Women's newspapers should report on political prisoners, to support us, to let people know what our plans are, what our history has been.

I want to thank Outwrite for its interest in our struggle. We trust in your solidarity to defeat Imperialism and puppet governments.

Alma: There have been talks about you causing a third world war. Reagan is excusing his intervention by saying that the conflict is between the USA and the Soviet Union, dismissing the people's will to fight for their own liberation and seeing El Salvador as another USSR base.

AMES: If people are well informed about our actual situation, the extreme poverty that forces us to take arms, they would not be confused. The revolutionary government will solve the economic inequalities and share the wealth amongst everybody. At the moment only 14 families 'own' El Salvador.

Relations with the socialist block will be economical, because the USA will surely boycott our economy as it is doing with Cuba and Nicaragua now. But that doesn't mean we are going to let just anybody run our country. It is our revolution, our country and we will know how to cope. We, the People of El Salvador, know what we are fighting for... for liberation, to end poverty, illiteracy, and exploitation.
