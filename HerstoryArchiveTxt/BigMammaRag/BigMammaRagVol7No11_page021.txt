Colorado Lesbian Conference

and children can result from being
woman-oriented on this level, then
it seems like an okay beginning to
me.

One rationale cited for the lack
of the word feminism in the Colorado
Lesbian Conference was that feminism
was only one issue facing lesbians.
Well, that depends on your defini-
tion of feminism. There are impor-
tant issues that do not involve us
only as women. The planners seeming-
ly did not want the conference to
be overtly political. It was polit-
ical, though. Mostly, in my opinion
it was liberal Lesbian-Feminism.

I have enormous respect for the
growing consistency of BMR politics
(ie: criticism of the Conference on
Violence Against Women on many of
the same issues as that of CLC). But
why are you coming down so hard on
this particular conference? - Obviously
the number of organizations that would
warrant such heavy criticism would be
enormous. To name just a few, the
Boulder Lesbian Network, the Anti-Nuclear
movement, the Take Back the Night March
in early October in Boulder, and on
and on and on. To be a purely revo-
lutionary feminist, must one oppose
all liberal feminist organizations
and activities? (ie: everything aimed
at partial relief of any and all
oppressions facing women--reform vs.
revolution). If not, then where
should the lines be drawn? This

question is also directed to Kate,
Lori, Bobbe, and Eileen (letters,
last issue).

The closing paragraph of Judy
Barlow's article on that long ago
community meeting (about the confer-
ence) said that tension at that meet-
ing was “because of the necessity
for some women to choose between les-
bianism and feminism as their main
priority". I don't see this. I
would prefer to go to a Lesbian-Fem-
inist Conference because it more
clearly says who I am, a Colorado
Lesbian-Feminist. When I go to my
community radio station meeting, I'm
not giving my radio-listening self
first priority. When I go to my
anti-nuclear group, I’m not giving
my anti-nuke concerns first priority.
I take my whole self to all the indi-
vidual issues that are important to
me. And being a lesbian, just a les-
bian, is one of them. I like to
read about Radclyffe Hall, too,
(though admittedly, I am more fond
of Natalie Barney).

Well, let me end in some heart-
felt praise. BMR is getting better
and better. It is evident that Big
Mama is a thorough feminist and her
articles reflect that fact. Some
excellent writing and coverage is
coming out of all the women in the
collective, and women in the commun-
ity as well. Keep up the good work.

LUNA & Sobriety

Here are some things to do which may
be helpful when kicking drugs, alco-
hol and other mind-boggling substan-
ces.

1. Acknowledge that you are taking
control of your own life, and that
you are responsible for your ac-
tions.

2. Start eating a nutritionally
healthy diet. Learn to cook and in-
vite a friend to eat with you.

3. Clean your apartment or house.
Do your laundry. Wash your hair.
Take long luxurious baths. Try to
wear cotton clothes as much as
possible.

4. Get some exercise and sunshine.

5. Communicate your feelings to
someone who will be receptive and
supportive.

6. Start to educate yourself about
the substance you are dealing with.

7. Put yourself in a supportive,
safe environment.

8. Do something special for your-
self. Treat yourself kindly.

9. People who have been using pills
should see a doctor. This is very
important, as withdrawal from pills
may cause serious problems.

10. Realize that you are not the
first one to do this. And that you
are not alone.

11. Take pride in your decision. Give
yourself some credit.

12. Be patient with yourself. Don't
try to do everything at once. Give
yourself time.

13. Accept support from others.

14. Be creative in maintaining your
sobriety. Whatever works for you

is fair,

15. Get involved in something out-
side yourself.

Commonly held myths and misguided
statements made about alcoholism and
drug abuse.

"Beer drinkers can't be alcoholics."
"Alcoholics can't keep a job."

"I can't be an alcoholic because I
never drink alone."

"Substance abusers are just weak peo-
ple with no will power."

"I can't be an alcoholic, because I
never drink in the morning."

"The lesbian community does not have
a substance abuse problem."

"I used to be an alcoholic."

"Drug addicts need to have a 'fix'
every day."

"Marijuana is a good substitute for
booze."

"Alcoholism is caused by lesbianism,
Lesbianism is caused by alcoholism."

"Alcoholism or drug abuse is an indi-
vidual problem."

The above information comes from
a leaflet compiled by some women
of LUNA. Meetings are held weekly
on Tuesday nights at 8 p.m. All
lesbians who want to deal with a sub-
stance abuse problem of their own
or that of a friend or lover are
invited to attend. The only require-
ment is to be alcohol and drug free
when attending meetings.

For more information, and for the
location of meetings, call 733-5868.
Information, as well as leaflets,
are also available at Woman to Woman

Feminist Therapy
From page 11

stretch into equality. I do not
think that this is possible in a
therapy relationship. To remain
professional, the therapist cannot
get too involved with her client
(and this is really essential, at
least as we know the process now);
but it also keeps a client in her
place. For most of us, being “kept
in place" has resulted in the iso-
lation and confusion that has led
to therapy in the first place.

It seems to me that a woman, be-
fore she gets into therapy, must con-
sider what is at stake. She must
ask herself why she is choosing
this means of working things out.
What expectations does she have of
herself? Of her therapist? How
long does she expect to be in this
relationship with a therapist, and
what is she investing in this
choice (money, time, experience)?
And what can she perceive as being
the trade-offs (how will she feel
being in a “learning position" for
the duration of her sessions)?

And this brings me to the most
significant question that I've ask-
ed myself: How feminist is “feminist
therapy"? As I have noted already,

I got political after leaving ther-
apy, and that is not coincidental.
During my months of weekly sessions,
I focused on myself, which I admit
I needed to do. But rarely was I
encouraged to put my “problems”
into the larger picture of the
political oppression of women (this
I believe was not coincidental
either. Again, I am convinced that
my therapist had a stake in keeping
me in an “apolitical” relationship
with her because I was a steady
client). I did not realize that
what I was dealing with were not

my "problems", but issues of fem-

inist struggle, that every woman,

at some time or another, has to
deal with.

Finally, I need to talk about
"problems." The whole nature of
therapy, of "going to someone for
help" keeps women thinking that we
need help, that there is something
wrong with us that someone, in this
case a feminist therapist (but for
centuries it has been doctors,
priests, psychiatrists...) can cure.
When we start talking to other wo-
men in consciousness raising groups,
political projects, in collective,
equal environments, we discover that
we are not alone, that our deepest,
darkest secrets about ourselves
are not problems at all, but
common experiences. When we are
involved in a one-to-one, unequal
relationship with a therapist, we
are still likely to feel isolated
and it's difficult, if not impossi-
ble to make political connections.

In many ways, this process is an

escape from reality, especially for

women who insist that a problem,

a conflict is personal rather than
political in nature. While each
one of us must find our own ways of
dealing with things, we must also
put our lives in the perspective
of a whole in order to prepare for
the struggles that are ahead of us
all of our lives. The alternatives
pointed out to women by a therapist
are personal, individualistic; and
while that may be a starting point
for many women in dealing with the
political as personal (and vice
versa), it is only a beginning. We
must see beyond, we must work toge-
ther for a future that will be bet-
ter for all of us, not just those
who can afford to see a therapist.
And that implies real struggles
that therapy neither addresses nor
prepares us for. While that process
encourages a woman to define her
own needs for herself, political
feminism pushes women to question,
defy, and demand together as a
movement.

And so, while I defend the alter-
native of therapy for women, and
especially for women in crisis sit-
uations, I am anxious that we real-
ize its implications and contradic-
tions, and that along the way, we
start working for better, more
equal ways to affirm our feelings
and our lives.

Soap Operas
From page 14

and that of another ex-prostitute
and junkie who was planning to give
up her baby for adoption.

Jenny decides that her marriage to
the rapist is over and supports her
sister in trying to prosecute him;
however, she still loves him. He is
trying to manipulate her into ta-
king him back but so far, she has not.

Let's take a look at how soap opera
values reflect the advertisers’ pur-
pose. The "good" women are for the
most part married or actively in
pursuit of a husband. The "good" wo-
men are traditionally “good” mothers
and wives. By this I mean that they
continually sacrifice themselves and
their needs for those of their hus-
bands and families. The "bad" women
are frequently intelligent, divorced,
wealthy, seductive, and self-centered.
They are not "good" mothers in that
they sometimes (if not usually) place
their own personal wants and needs
above those of others. They do not
deny themselves.

There are three different types of
soap operas that can be broken down
and classified by the age of the au-
dience they are trying to reach.
Those programs that are geared for
older women generally have a set mo-
ral code. The values are traditional.
They are representative of right-
wing politics and Christian ethics.
Women who reject traditional roles
are “bad”. They are portrayed as
being aggressive and ruthless. They
hurt “good" characters who they are
involved with.

Soap operas that try to appeal to
younger women are more liberal in
their moral stand. Women who are
"good" characters are sometimes
allowed to have careers as well as
families. They are “superwomen".
These soap operas sometimes present
good information on divorce, rape,
abortion or even women's rights.
However, the ultimate goal and re-
sponsibility of these women is to
have a husband and a family. Their
duty is to forsake all for the hus-
band and family when the "opportunity"
arises.

Some soap operas, especially those
that run 60-90 minutes each day have
a combination of both traditional
and liberal values. They have a wide
variety of characters, but the core
of the story is usually the strong
nuclear family. The children and
grandchildren may experience rape,
incest, assault, drugs, homosexuality,
premarital sex, birth control, abor-
tion, and countless other current
trends; however, the extended family
remains intact and tries to under-
stand the problems of the individual
involved. A happy resolution for the
younger characters is to come to
accept the values of the nuclear
family.

Although different soap operas
may be geared to different age
groups, the underlying message seems
to be the same - to promote the vir-
tues of the nuclear family in the cap-
italist society.

Another way that soaps use to pro-
mote the capitalist system is to
show it from a personal perspective.
Heads of corporations are shown as
kind, gentle, and vulnerable, yet
powerful men. They are moralistic
in the sense that they genuinely
care about their employees and the
effects their corporation has on
its community. If the corporate ex-
ecutive happens to be a "bad" per-
son, there are always ways that the
"good" characters have to keep his/
her power in check. “Bad” corporate
executives are more likely to be
women, showing once again that wo-
men function best in the home or in
less demanding occupations. But even
here the home and family are the most
desirable areas for a woman to put
her energy into.

All in all, the soap opera has
a great deal of power. Aside from
the fact that they may be addictive
for some women, their morals in-
fluence a great number of women.
Imagine the impact that feminist-
oriented soap operas would have -
how they could help change attitudes
that women have about themselves.
Imagine justifying lesbianism by
making lesbians real and identifi-
able just as current soap operas
depict capitalists as warm and caring
humans. How better could we reach
the millions of women who are glued
to their televisions each weekday?
