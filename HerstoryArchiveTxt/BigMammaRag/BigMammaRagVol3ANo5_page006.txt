Los Angeles Outrage

Z Budapest Convicted  
Of Fortunetelling  

Cheryl Diehm/ Sister  

Z Budapest, high priestess of  
the Susan B. Anthony Coven  
Number One and spiritual leader  
of the women’s community in  
Los Angeles was found guilty of  
fortune telling in West LA.  
Municipal Court.  

Z was sentenced to 15 days in  
jail or $300 fine, almost the  
maximum penalty for a first  
offense misdemeanor. She has,  
however, elected to appeal her  
conviction — up to the Supreme  
Court if necessary — and is  
currently free on $2500 bail, and  
also 2 year probation during  
which she cannot touch her  
cards.  

Z was arrested last February in  
her shop, The Feminist Wicca, at  
442 Lincoln Blvd. in Venice, and  
charged with “fortune telling”  
a violation of L.A. Municipal Code  
43.30. She was also originally  
charged under state statute 332  
which makes fortune telling  
with intent to defraud illegal, but  
this charge was dropped when  
law enforcement officials could  
find no fraud involved in the  
case. The Municipal Code makes  
no mention of fraud or of taking  
money under false pretenses,  
but makes the act of fortune  
telling itself illegal.  

As a genetic witch, a high  
priestess and goddess  
worshipper, Z has the gift of  
divination through the tarot  
cards, which she reads as part of  
her religious beliefs. The  
prosecution, however, chose to  
convince the jury that Z reads  
the cards as part of a business  
not as a religion, and it is on this  
point that the case was tried.  

A jury of seven women and  
five men was selected to hear  
the evidence.  

The prosecution's case rested  
solely on the police testimony:  
Rosalie Kimberlin, the under-  
cover cop who set Z up for the  
bust by asking Z to read her  
cards; officers Falkenborg and  
Shelley, who made the arrest;  
and Detective Alcantera, the  
LAPD’s so-called expert on for-  
tune telling.  

The prosecution was  
handled by Judith Stein, a  
woman who was so inept that  
she almost aroused sympathy  
among those of Z's supporters  
who were able to squeeze into the  
tiny 25-seat courtroom to watch  
the trial. Stein was, according to  
defense attorneys, the person  
with the lowest seniority in the  

© BLESSED BE?  

city attorney's office and the only  
one who couldn't say “no” to  
taking the case.  

At the outset, defense at-  
torneys Marge Buckley and  
Marie Colaneri made a motion to  
have the trial moved to a larger  
courtroom, protesting that the  
limited seating denied Z the right  
to a public trial.  

“What do you want me to do,  
hold the case in the Colosseum  
so we could have 100,000  
seats,” said Judge Michael T.  
Sauer in denying the motion.  

As the jury selection began  
the first day, 150 of Z’s sup-  
porters rallied outside the  
courthouse singing and dancing  
and hugging and kissing and  
creating a good energy spell for  
success in the courtroom.  

In her opening statement,  
Stein set the prosecution's tone  
for the case — the witch hunt  
motif — by painting Z and her  
practices as ridiculous,  
dangerous and bordering on evil.  
She described the Feminist  
Wicca as containing vials and  
bottles of bat’s blood (really an  
herb and not blood at all); bones,  
snake skins, charts with strange  
markings, mysterious books (in  
reality feminist and lesbian  
literature and books on goddess  
worship); foul odors (incense)  
and candles.  

Officer Kimberlin testified that  
a citizen’s complaint triggered  
the police investigation. She  
continued her testimony by  
saying that Z made four specific  
predictions about Kimberlin’s  
future during the tarot card  
reading.  

According to Detective  
Alcantera’s “expert” interpreta-  
tion of the law, Z ran afoul of the  
authorities whereas newspaper  
astrologers do not: Fortune  
telling, if it predicts specific  
future events for a person is  
illegal; if fortune telling predicts  
future conduct, then it is allow-  
ed. (?!?)  

Detective Alcantera’s  
background as an expert was  
limited to attending one UCLA  
class on gypsies, reading the  
instructions in two tarot decks  
and skimming two popular  
paperback type tarot books. He  
did not know any of the more  
scholarly and theoretical studies  
done on the tarot.  

The defense’s case rested on  
proving that Z was a spiritual  
leader engaged in religious  
activities. Section 43.31 of the  
Municipal Code exempts per-  

sons of a bona fide religion or  
church from being prosecuted  
under Section 43.30.  

The first defense witness was  
Barbara Chesser, a doctoral  
candidate in anthropology and  
comparative religion.  

— “Is it your opinion that  
witchcraft is a religion?” asked  
defense attorney Marie  
Colaneri.  

— “Yes, it is related to  
shamanism. It is an archaic  
religion involving contracts with  
the supernatural and is 30,000  
to 40,000 years old.”  

— “Is prophecy an essential  
part?”  

— “Very much so.”  

Chesser’s testimony was  
followed on the stand by four  
people who spoke on Z's status  
in the community: Allison  
Harlow, a systems analyst and  
computer programmer and witch  
who testified as to Z’s standing  
in the pagan community; Sherna  
Gluck, long time feminist activist  
who described Z's position as a  
respected leader in the women’s  
community; Dr. George Peters, a  
psychologist who established  
scientific credibility for ESP  
experiments including tarot  
card reading, and also described  
many bona fide churches, some  
functioning as multi-million  
dollar tax exempt corporations  
whose leaders charge for divining  
the future; and Jim Conn,  
minister of the Church in Ocean  
Park, also testified for the  
defense, stating that he  
recognized and respected Z as a  
clergyperson.  

Z then took the stand to testify  
in her own behalf:  

— “We regard the female  
principle as the giver of life and  
we regard ourselves as women  
as her (the goddess’) expression  
on earth.”  

— “I have been blessed with  
the gift of the cards.”  

— “I have read cards for 25  
cents, for a single rose, I have  
read the cards for a kiss.”  

During the cross-examination  
the prosecutor began  
badgering Z about her religious  
practices.  

— “Can you tell us what goes  
on at these ceremonies, what do  
you do on top of this mountain  
that you don’t know the name of,  
what you wear?”  

Some of the rituals must  
remain secret, Z said.  

Tell us, tell us, tell us, insisted

Suit on Sexual Advances  

Being subjected to sexual  
advances on a job is not a  
violation of civil rights, or so  
decided an Arizona judge in a  
suit brought by two women  
against their former employer  
and supervisor.  

The women say that a male  
supervisor in an Arizona optical  
factory subjected them to persis-  
tent verbal and physical sexual  
advances. The two finally quit  
“because the working con-  
ditions made it intolerable,”  
according to their attorney. Their  
suit charges the supervisor and  
employer with sex discrimina-  
tion.  

In March, however, according  
to the Wall Street Journal, U.S.  
District Judge William Frey  
granted the defense’s motion to  
dismiss the lawsuit partly, he  
said, because the supervisor's  
acts were “satisfying a personal  
urge. Certainly, “no employer  
policy is here involved.”  

The women are appealing the  
judge's decision. A legal victory  
could encourage similar suits by  
women who resent “either  
putting up with it or losing your  
job,” their lawyer points out.

Psychologists Come Out  

The American Psychological  
Association has finally recog-  
nized its gay members by  
creating a Task Force on Gay  
Psychologists, to meet for the

psychologists interested in what  
happens on this Task Force  
please contact Dorothy at 40 E.  
14th St., No. 5, Tucson, AZ,  
85701. She would like to get  
input from other lesbians and  
also develop a mailing list for  
letting lesbian psychologists  
know what has happened on the  
Task Force.  

(Dorothy was the first lesbian  
in Arizona to state publicly in a  
professional conference that  
she is gay.)
