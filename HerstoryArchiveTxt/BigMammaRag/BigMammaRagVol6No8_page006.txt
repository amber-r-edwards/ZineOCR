Better Brains

Recent research has found that lan-
guage is apparently organized and
contained in the left hemisphere of
the brain for right-handed people,
and in both hemispheres of the brain
for left-handed people.

Now, New Scientist magazine reports
that women may also have their lan-
guage skills organized in both hemi-
spheres of the brain.

New Scientist reports that a Univ-
ersity Hospital researcher in London,
Canada, studied 85 patients who had
suffered brain injury involving dam-
age to just one hemisphere. She
looked at 23 women and 20 men who
had lesions in the left hemisphere,
and 17 men and 17 women who had prob-
lems in the right hemispheres.

The researcher, Jeanette McGlone,
then tested all of these patients
with verbal IQ tasks which determine
the ability to do manual tasks, vis-
ual puzzles and the like.

McGlone said she expected to find
that both the men and women who had
suffered damage to the left “lingu-
istic" hemisphere would do worse than
the others on the verbal IQ test.

McGlone says that the results she
got for the male subjects confirmed
her expectations. The verbal IQ for
men was an average of 83.1, well be-
low the average.

But the score of the women with left
hemisphere damage was perfectly normal
at 99.1.

McGlone says that there was no
significant difference between the
verbal ability of the women who had
suffered injury to the left hemisphere
and the abilities of men and women
who had suffered injury to the right,
non-linguistic hemisphere.

Provocative Ad

Women Against Violence Against
Women in Toronto is calling on an
advertising agency in that city to
halt distribution of a provocative
ad which the group charges symbolizes
the murder of a woman.

The ad in question was designed by
Reid Bell Associates Advertising
and is displayed in the window of an
exclusive men's shop.

It portrays a blonde woman in scan-
ty lingerie, lying on a bathroom
floor with three men behind her. One
man is tightening a bolt on a radiat-
or with a large wrench, another is
holding an umbrella and has dropped
his gloves onto the woman’s legs,
while the third is standing above her
peeling a carrot with a knife.

WAVAW is picketing Harry Rosen's
Men's Wear where the ad is on display,
charging it symbolizes the murder of
a woman. The group says the wrench,
the umbrella, and knife in the ad are
meant to be weapons.

Meanwhile, the men's store owner
has called the objection to the ad
"ridiculous."

Said Harry Rosen, "I thought it was
an unusual, interesting, abstract
and hopefully attention-getting ad.

I never thought it would put people
down." Rosen added that he would
not take the "creative liberty” of
the ad agency away by ordering it to
discontinue designing provocative ads
for his store.

Domestic Violence

Recent hearings conducted by Senat-
or Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) on domestic
violence disclosed that in California
one out of two women will be assaul-
ted by her husband or son at some
time in her life. Other statistics
brought to the Senate hearing:

* One fourth of all women who are
beaten are pregnant.

* Some 25% of all murders in the
nation occur within the family; half
are husband-wife killings.

* In California, one-third of female
murder victims are killed by their
husbands.

* The FBI considers wife beating to
be the most underreported crime in
the country.

Man of
Utmost Decency

A northern Virginia man described
by his attorney as "a man of utmost
decency" has been sentenced to a year
in prison for defrauding women.

The women were reportedly promised
glamorous careers in return for sex-
ual favors.

Leo Christy Condolon admitted in a
statement that in 1974 and 1975, he
placed ads in the Washington Post
seeking women to be actresses or
models and interviewed about 50 women.

He said he required the women to
submit to his sexual advances in
return for promises--never kept--
of roles in television commercials.

Condolon, speaking on his own be-
half in court, stated that he "didn't
know at the time that what I was
doing was wrong."

U.S. District Judge Oren Lewis,
however, told Condolon that he could
not condone the offense.

Lewis convicted Condolon of wire
fraud, since Condolon had talked to
the women over the telephone. The
judge ruled the women were defrauded
of “time, effort and expenses, in-
cluding time and effort expended by
victims in interviews, memorizing
commercial scripts, postponing other
career decisions and submitting to
sexual advances" from the man.

Women’s Bank

San Diego's Women's Bank has just
changed its name to the California
Coastal Bank.

At the same time, it's replaced
its female president with a male.

The abrupt turnabout came after a
marketing research survey showed that
many people felt the women's liber-
ation image was hurting the bank in
drawing male customers, because men
thought the bank was exclusively for
women.

The bank now claims it is showing
a profit after two years of losses.

Gardiner is a firm supporter of
apartheid. She said that “it would
be disastrous" if the Black majority
took power now in South Africa.

Battered
Women Sue

A suit brought by twelve battered
women against New York City's Family
Court and Probation Department has
been dismissed by the New York State
Appellate Court.

The suit charged that the Family
Court denied the twelve women--who
claimed their husbands beat them
regularly--access to judges who could
have issued restraining orders
against the husbands.

The Appellate Division ruled, how-
ever, that the women did not have a
case against the Family Court and
overturned a previous decision which
had granted them permission to sue
the Family Court and Probation Depart-
ment.

An earlier suit, filed by the same
12 women, had charged the New York
City police refused to arrest their
husbands, despite evidence of beat-
ings. Police had claimed that they
couldn't interfere in "family dis-
putes."

That suit ended in an out-of-court
agreement by police to arrest wife-
beaters.

Attorneys for the 12 women say they
will appeal the latest ruling to the
New York Court of Appeals.

ion of a landmark Supreme Court
ruling to gay couples, a San Diego
judge has ordered a lesbian to prov-
ide $100 a month temporary support
to her lover. Superior Court Judge
Byron F. Lidsley ordered the support
for 23-year-old Sherry Robinson, a

"man and wife.” The two were married
February 17 at the Metropolitan
Community Church of San Diego.

$100,000 Rapist

Women Against Violence Against
Women (WAVAW) has launched a campaign
against ABC for offering a convicted
rapist $100,000 for the screen rights
to his life story in order to turn it
into a TV movie. The rapist was
convicted recently for impersonating
fashion photographer Richard Avedon
and luring women to pose for him and
then raping them. WAVAW charges that
ABC is seeking to sensationalize
and make profits off the rape of
women.

A class action suit has been filed
in Phoenix, Arizona, charging Pinal
County with denying poor women mater-
nity care, and instead, offering
them abortions and sterilizations.

The suit was filed by the Legal Aid
Societies of Pinal and Gila counties.

It charges that the county has re-
quired plaintiffs to practice birth
control in order to receive medical
care, and that it has offered them
free abortions and free sterilization
in place of the medical care.

In affidavits filed with the suit,
Margie Harris, one of the plaintiffs,
charges that she went to the county
medical investigator before her
pregnancy and was told she would not
be eligible for care unless she took
birth control pills.

She says that after becoming preg-
nant, she returned to a medical in-
vestigator to apply for delivery of
her child under that county welfare
program. She was then told, she says,
that the county would not pay for the
birth of her child, but that it would
pay for an abortion and that follow-
ing the abortion, she would automat-
ically be sterilized.

The suit charges that Pinal County's
welfare policies are unconstitutional
because they deny poor women the
right to equal protection under the
laws and the right to procreate.

Confronting Rapists

California Women Against Rape has
been taking some direct actions aga-
inst men who attack women. For five
years, they have confronted rapists
in their workplaces, neighborhoods,
and homes. At the time of the ver-
bal confrontation, the rapist is
given anti-rape literature and a few
weeks later he receives a letter
warning, "We're still watching you.
You'd better change the way you
treat women." When asked what the
results of their actions were so far,
a Santa Cruz woman said, "Not bad.
The police want to kill us... the
rapists are afraid of us."

Sexual Dysfunction

According to Human Behavior, two
Massachusetts researchers found that
at least one-third of the rapists
they studied experience sexual dys-
function during the rape, and that
sperm was found in less than half
the victims. The magazine goes on to
say that in light of this research,
juries may be giving far too much
weight to the presence of semen in
rape victims as a basis for convict-
ing rapists.
