as those offered by York Street and

In fact, they can be dangerous be-  
cause they make women think that  
their lives, that our lives, are  
getting better when we are, in real-  
ity, only being appeased. Programs  
such as these have made women further

very politics that have kept women  
victims throughout history. City and  
federally funded programs for women  
also undercut the work done by grass-  
roots feminists who not only provide  
services, but also a political anal-  
ysis to women who are victims of  
physical and economic violence. So,  
as economic cutbacks continue to fell  
services for women, we as feminists  
must understand the importance of  
coming up with viable programs so  
that we can have real control over  
our lives without continuing to give  
power to those who continue to man-  
ipulate and victimize us.

THAT WOMEN HAVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND A CONSEQUENT  

PRACTICE."

It was also poor reporting to open  
the story with a paraphrase from  
Connie Perenyi, who, it was noted,  
was no longer working with the group.  
We are never told why. Instead, the  
whole story is left to begin with  
an unspoken suggestion that something  
is amiss. A better opener could have  
been found--possibly from someone who  
was actually working on the project  
and had something to say about why  
it was important.

Connie responds:  

The community meeting was called  
to discuss how we should organize  
around the draft as feminists. Just  
saying that women who came to the  
meeting were prepared to organize  
as feminists implies that we al-  
ready had the same basis of unity  
from which to make decisions about  
organizing - and that is an in-  
correct assumption. There was little  
discussion about whether we should  
actually organize with other groups.  
It was assumed that we would because  
to do otherwise would be divisive.  
Also, I believe that there are rea-  
sons why we choose not to work  
with other groups - it is suicidal  
to join with a broad-based movement  
that does not recognize feminist  
struggle as equal in importance  
with the issue at hand.  

The AFSC was not specifically  
commended for its organizational  
efforts because that is something  
that staff members do all the time -  
it is their job for which they are  
paid. The diversity at the rally  
points to the fact that the organ-  
izing done was around a single is-  
sue - the issue of the draft - and  
again, when women get into dealing  

the single issues without making  

clear the broader context of these  
issues, we cut our necks as femin-  
ists.  

My primary reason for leaving the  
group was that I know that women  
coalescing with groups like the  
AFSC usually have to "put their  
politics in the background" to re-  
main in working harmony with the  
coalition. It takes an enormous  
amount of trust and political unity  
among the women who choose to rec-  
ognize and then challenge the al-  
ready-established power of these  
traditionalist organizations; and  
it takes even more energy to vali-  
date feminism to them (energy, I  
may add, that is taken away from  

Voices  

I've heard so many women saying anot-  
her had "psychological problems".  
What oppression these psychiatric  
labels carry with them! Yes, I am  
angry, and, yes, I really do care.  
Psychiatric inmates are a minority  
in the feminist community that has  
been ignored. Some have asked over  
and over again for support, asked  
to be heard, but most ex-inmates are  
too intimidated to even share with  
other women that they have been lock-  
ed up. We are supposed to keep quiet  
so people will think we are OK. Well,  
I am OK, and that's why I don't keep  
quiet. When the issue of women and

feminist organizing with women  
around women's issues).  

The potential of organizing around  
the draft and building a strong  
constituency of the people who are  
most affected by it, is severely  
limited when women work with  
groups whose reputation precedes  
them. The AFSC is a pacifist organ-  
ization, and whether or not there  
was a "unified position", it was  
the politics of pacifism - and not  
the politics of the groups who  
worked with the AFSC - that deter-  
mined the tone of the action. In  
effect, these organizers spoke  
for Women Say No.  

And that points out the contra-  
dictions of your letter. Women at  
the community meeting were afraid  
of being divisive and detracting  
from the issue. At that time, they  
chose to work with the organizers  
of other groups within the con-  
text of a rally that had initially  
been planned without feminist in-  
put. And while these women origin-  
ally proposed concessions like  
points of unity and a demand for  
women speakers, they never follow-  
ed through. Again, I get the sense  
that this was because (1) these  
demands were no longer seen as  
appropriate, and (2) that the  
women making them would have been  
too pushy. Also, it does not appear  
that the goal, or ultimate effect  
of Women Say No was a strong vi-  
sible presence at the rally. It  
was clear from the beginning that  
other groups had no intention of  
dealing with International Women's  
Day by addressing women's issues  
(the reason for the rally was the  
draft, period). And so, the "visible  
presence of women" was in the title  
of the action, not the content.  

I criticize myself for not having  
made my objections clear at the com-  
munity meeting. I have become more  
articulate about my feelings since  
then; and I repeat that I can not  
work with a group that tacitly en-  
dorses the politics of the AFSC, or  
any other group that does not deal  
in a real way with the issues of  
patriarchal supremacy. From my own  
experience, I know that the only  
way to have feminist politics re-  
cognized and visible is for women  
to stand apart from these groups,  
to insist that they join us rather  
than, once again, asking them to let  
us slip in behind. Unless that hap-  
pens, I don't see that the ‘80s will  
be any different than the ‘60s.

for her madness talk. Listen to us  
for a change. Don't deal with us as  
"crazy". The women's community would  
rather listen to somebody with a lot  
of Ph.D.'s, who can speak from a  
detached and professional point-of-  
view about what happens to women in  
this society. Well, this is our lib-  
eration and we have something to say.  
Labels like "crazy", "emotionally  
ill", “not all there", “too negat-  
ive", and "sick" are just more pri-  
sons. They are just more ways of  
locking away our feelings.

Sending misdemeanant offense women  
to community programs would serve to  
‘concentrate down' long-term women  
in the prison and a new dynamic  
would result."  

For those unfamiliar with correc-  
tions-ese, the translation of this  
statement goes something like this:  
If the state opens its diversion pro-  
gram to women, most of the prisoners  
at Hardwick will be long-term prison-  
ers - primarily those convicted of  
violent crimes (and most of these  
are in prison for killing husbands  
who severely abused them or their  
children), the diversion of the maj-  
ority who comprise the "new economic  
crime group" would decrease the pri-  
sons population to the point at  
which it would eliminate the need  
for a new women's prison.  

It is important here to define the  
"new economic crime group," for  
these are the women who represent  
a growing majority of inmates in  
Georgia as well as other areas of  
the country. A substantial number  
of these women were convicted of  
welfare fraud, not the headline ma-  
kers who are occasionally caught  
swindling hundreds of thousands of  
dollars, but poverty-stricken mo-  
thers who try to earn a few extra  
dollars on the side to feed and  
clothe their children. The crack-  
down against these women has result-  
ed in a substantial increase in  
fraud arrests - the only category  
of women's economic crime which  
has increased in the last few years.  
Nationally, 35 percent of all fraud  
arrests last year were for welfare  
fraud. Among women convicted of  
other economic crimes, the majority  
are shoplifters, bad-check passers  
and petty thieves - precisely the  
kind of offenders who would bene-  
fit most from a supervised work  
release program in which they could  
learn job skills which would provide  
adequate income for the women and  
their children.  

With an average age of 21, most  
of Hardwick's women should also qual-  
ify for the Youthful Offender Pro-  
gram. Technically, anyone between  
the ages of 17 and 25 who is not  
guilty of a capital offense is eli-  
gible for this program. Yet the  
"program" for women is exactly the  
same as it is for all other women  
in the Georgia prison system: they  
are sent directly to Hardwick. The  
males, however, go through a diag-  
nostic center and are then trans-  
ferred to "an institution designed  
for the care and treatment of Youth-  
ful Offenders." There, according  
to Department promotional materials,  
they “participate in numerous  
treatment and rehabilitative pro-  

Charity Lamb  

There is suggestive evidence that  
the transfer was a political move.  
Charity was moved to the asylum with  
surprising rapidity. In response to  
the governor's suggestion, the certi-  
fication and transfer took place with-  
in two days. The motive may have been  
the governor's feeling that it was a  
disgrace to have a woman prisoner. His  
next official message contains a pecu-  
liar prideful boast that “of the one  
hundred and thirteen convicts now in  
our Penitentiary, not one is a woman."  

Charity lived out her days in the  
asylum. She was there seventeen years  
until she died, of apoplexy, in Sept-  
ember of 1879. She was fifty-six years  
old and had been locked up a total of  
twenty-five years.

grams (including)...academic educa-  
tion;...comprehensive recreation;  
...vocational training (heating and  
air conditioning installation and  
repair); meat cutting; automotive  
maintenance and repair; construc-  
tion trades..." Needless to say, most  
of these services are not available  
to Youthful Offenders at Hardwick,  
least of all the extensive vocation-  
al training for jobs that pay decent  
wages.  

Without access to these alterna-  
tive programs, Hardwick's women (65  
percent of whom were the sole sup-  
port of their families prior to in-  
carceration) are far more likely to  
be locked into the cycle of poverty  
after release from prison. And as  
residents of Georgia, they have a  
far better than average chance of  
being recommitted for the least  
infraction of the law.  

When Hardwick was planned in 1974,  
then-Governor Jimmy Carter intention-  
ally limited the facility's capacity  
to 200 in order to force corrections  
officials to establish programs for  
women. A year earlier he had estim-  
ated that half the women in the  
Georgia system ought not to be there.  
LaVerne Ford, warden at the women's  
prison and Georgia's first black  
warden, disagreed; she stated to the  
Atlanta League of Women Voters that  
three-fourths of the women did not  
belong there. And as recently as  
February of this year, an in-house  
memo from DOR's Chief of Statistics  
to its director of Research stated  
that the number of women in transi-  
tional programs is limited not by the  
number of women who would qualify,  
but by "the amount of bed space." The  
fact that at least 50 percent of the  
beds in diversion programs are for  
men and are empty appears to have  
slipped by the prison bureaucracy;  
that some of these under-utilized  
facilities could easily be made for  
women may be entirely too logical and  
efficient for correctional officials  
to comprehend.  

"At $16 million," Hall commented,  
"a bigger prison for women represents  
a very expensive, long-term inflexib-  
le policy commitment...or lack of  
commitment to the needs and energies  
of the young, mostly black, women  
now being trapped in the prison cage  
in Georgia. Will inaction and neglect  
of the broad array of community mea-  
sures on the part of corrections off-  
icials finally be rewarded with a  
bigger prison?" He and Brinson in-  
tend to see that it is not.
