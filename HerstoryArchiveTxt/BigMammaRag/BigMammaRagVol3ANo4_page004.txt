Vietnamese Women Mourn

“\Ne

One Orphan.”

A representative of the
American Friends Service
Committee who has spoken with
Vietnamese children aged 5 to
14 who have recently arrived in
the United States has stated that
none of the children that she
spoke with are actually orphans.

“I spent most of one night
with a congressional aide talking
to a planeload of 260
Vietnamese kids,” explained
Jane Barton, “and we couldn't
find one orphan.” In subsequent
visits with the children, Barton
said she did meet some “who
are true orphans” but stressed
that most that she spoke with
had at least one living parent.

Barton, who is fluent in
Vietnamese and spent two years
working at a Quaker hospital in
Quang Ngai, pointed out that
even Saigon statistics reveal
that as many as 80 per cent of all
the children in Vietnamese
orphanages have at least one
living parent. She emphasized
that many parents put their
children in orphanages because
wartime conditions made it
economically impossible for
them to support the children, but
that these parents expect to be
reunited with their children after
the war.

Along with Frank Ivey, an aide
to Ronald Dellums (D-Cal),
Barton has made three visits to
the Presidio, a San Francisco
army installation where more
than 800 Vietnamese children
have been housed upon arriving
from their native land. “In one of
my three visits to the orphans
arriving in San Francisco,” she
explained, “I did not meet one
child who was an orphan in the
sense of having lost both
parents.

“I talked to a number of
children who said they were not
orphans,” she continued. “One
eight-year-old boy said he was
separated from his mother in a
refugee column and was sent to
an orphanage temporarily, and a
day later flown to the U.S.
Another boy said he and his
sister were separated and sent
to different countries. A poor
family was advised to put two
children temporarily in an
orphanage on the understanding
they would be returned to
their parents; they were on the
airlift.

“It appears to me,” she
concluded, “that some children
are coming here without their
parents’ knowledge.”

U.S. officials have maintained
throughout the ‘Baby Lift’ that

Many parents put
their children in or-
phanages because wartime
conditions made it
economically impossi-
ble for them to sup-
port the children, but
that these parents ex-
pect to be reunited
with their children af-
ter the war.

the identification of all children
was carefully checked out and
that all those flown out of the
country are orphans.
Responding to Barton's
interviews with the Vietnamese
children, Alex Stalcup, a doctor
at the Presidio army base,
maintained that many of the
children were emotionally upset
and therefore their statements
could not be trusted.

In South Vietnam, Liberation
Radio of the Provisional
Revolutionary Government of
South Vietnam (PRG) has
denounced the airlifting of
Vietnamese children as “a cr-
iminal act akin to kidnapping.”
And in Saigon, non-PRG Third
Force members have also
criticized the U.S.-Thieu “Baby
Lift” project.

One Vietnamese quoted in the
Washington Post said of the
child evacuation program, “I
wonder if it was a matter of

The Post also quoted Do
Quyen, an actress, as saying,
“They are Vietnamese children.
They must be brought up by us. I
don’t mind if there is some guilt
among the American people
towards us. But why don’t they
give us the means to bring up the
children ourselves instead of
taking them away?”

The evacuation of Vietnamese
children is part of a propaganda
campaign by the U.S. and Thieu
to get more aid for the crumbling

when opposition forces in Saigon released a copy
of a government document

A letter from the
Saigon vice premier to the
premier also exposed the role of
U.S. Ambassador Graham
Martin in the scheme.

“The U.S. Embassy will help
us evacuate the people,” the
vice premier stated in the letter.
“The U.S. Embassy stressed that
the evacuation of orphans and
thousands of others caught in
the fighting will help in turning
American public opinion around
favorably for South Vietnam.

“As soon as these children
have arrived in the U.S.,” he
said, “newspapers,
television stations, and radio
will give it wide
coverage, strongly affecting the

Don't Talk To The FBI

If the FBI should happen to visit
you someday, you must know
what your rights are. It is impor-
tant to know that all the informa-
tion the FBI gets isn't from agents
and bugs but comes from people
who unwittingly supply it.

There is no law requiring that
anyone talk to the FBI. If an agent
comes to your door, identifies
himself/herself, it is perfectly
legal for you to slam it in his/her
face. You can defend your
property in the same way as if a
prowler came up to your house.
You can call the police and have
the agent arrested. You can sue
the FBI.

If, however, the agent gets a
chance to speak, all you have to
say is to get in touch with your
lawyer. Don’t say anything else.
Don't try to be arrogant thinking
that you can fool them. Don’t lie!
Don't deny anything. Lies can be
used against you. Don’t say that
you don't know anything; you can
be charged with perjury. Just
don't say anything.

The circumstantial evidence
that the FBI can create from a few
loose statements has sent more
than one person to jail. Tell your
friends their rights, too, so that
they won't be scared into talking.
Never believe what the agent has
to say. Everything they say is
based on getting you to talk. They
will say that somebody else has
talked and implicated you when,
in fact, no one has. Never, never
talk. You have the legal right not
to talk to them. Be aggressive, not
defensive.
