Letters Home To Mama

Grand Jury Coercion  
Dear Friends,

On December 19, Ellen  
Grusse and Terri Turgeon were  
released from Niantic State  
Prison in Connecticut and their  
subpoenas were dropped. The  
two women had spent over eight  
months in jail for refusing to tes-  
tify before a federal grand jury  
investigating the harboring of  
fugitives Susan Saxe and Kath-  
erine Power. Ellen and Terri are  
free because of the massive  
pressure put on the judge and  
the U.S. attorney by hundreds of  
people across the country.

Jill Raymond has been incar-  
cerated in Kentucky county jails  
for nearly a year for refusing to  
cooperate with a similar grand  
jury investigation. Jail condi-  
tions are harsh for Jill and she is  
the only woman prisoner in a  
predominantly male county jail.  
Up until now, we have not been  
able to visibly demonstrate na-  
tional support for Jill's release.

WE ARE ASKING YOU TO  
HELP FREE JILL RAYMOND. A  
massive letter writing cam-  
paign to the U.S. attorney in Lex-  
ington could help bring about  
her release. We ask that you and  
the people in your organization  
send letters and telegrams im-  
mediately to:

U.S. Attorney Eldon Webb,  
Federal Building  
Lexington, Kentucky 40501.

We suggest that you stress in  

your letters that: 1) Ellen and  

Terri have recently been re-  
leased. 2) Jill is in jail for the  
same reason, i.e. refusing to tes-  
tify before a grand jury investi-  
gating the harboring of Saxe and  
Power. 3) Jill's one year incar-

geration for not talking is a coer-  
cive measure and her con-  
tinued imprisonment merely  
punitive at this point, as she is  
not going to talk. 4) JILL  
SHOULD BE RELEASED IMME-  
DIATELY.

Be as creative as you want  
with the letters and send as  
many as possible. We are con-  
vinced given the experience of

can help get Jill out of jail.

Dear Big Mama Rag women,

In the November issue I read  
with respect the column en-  
titled “Struggle — a continuing  
forum” which dealt with the dy-  
namics of support and criticism  
within feminist communities. It  
is the kind of thoughtful analy-  
sis of ourselves and our interac-  
tions with each other which  
furthers a solid feminist ethic. I  
liked the article's abstractness  
because its ideas can be applied  
to all issues and situations in  
which we work together.

I also went back to the Oc-  
tober “Struggle” column “Com-  
batting Liberalism” and found it

a useful examination of how we  
perceive ourselves as political  
beings and how many roles we  
can play. Hoping that these  
articles will continue to emerge  
from your Denver community,

Baby Elephants  
Dear Sisters,

Why has my sub been taking  
so long to get to me lately? Is that  
your fault or is it the U.S. Male?

It's lonely out here in the sub-  
urbs. How do I find out what's  
happening for women in  
Denver? I called the Woman to  
Woman Bookcenter but they  
only know what's happening out  
of their place — which is a lot,  
but it can’t be everything.

I've been enjoying recent  
issues of the paper, especially  
your health articles and book re-  
views. Keep it coming.

Love,

Cecily Ensworth  

P.S.: Did you know that all baby  
elephants weigh exactly 222 lbs  
at birth, are purple and look like  
giant prunes?

Ed. note: Our April issue will  
highlight local women’s resour-  
ces. Let us know about women’s  
happenings in your area (Denver  
and nearby).

Mailings are sent out around  
the 2nd of each month. If you  
don't have your copy a week  
after that, call up the post office  
and complain.

Corrections Victims  

Dear Supporters and Friends,

The female victims of the N.C.  
Dept. of Corrections violence,  
which came in response to a  
peaceful protest for improved  
prison conditions at the North  
Carolina Correctional Center for  
Women, filed a lawsuit for re-  
dress from brutality on Dec. 4,  
1975. The National Conference  
of Black Lawyers and Prisoners  
Rights Organized Defense, con-  
tacted through Action for For-  
gotten Women, will represent  
the women.

The complaint itself, filed in  
the U.S. District Court for the  
Eastern District of North Caro-  
lina, challenges unjust and in-  
humane conditions of confine-  
ment and the constitutionality of  
actions taken by the Depart-  

ment of Corrections against the  
women both during and after the  
protest.

The suit alleges, among other  
things, that work in the prison  
laundry was required of the  
women without minimal safe-  
guards provided for health and  
safety and that medical care af-  
forded the women is inade-  
quate. It also alleges that “in  
ending the demonstration, the  
defendants used brutal and ex-  
cessive force and that punish-  
ments inflicted were cruel and  
unusual and that the women's  
lock-up conditions called Admin-  
istrative Segregation resulted in  
serious deprivations and ex-  
treme isolation.” Sixth, Eighth  
and Fourteenth Amendment  
rights of women are also alleged  
to have been violated.

The brutality of the American  
penal system has been brought  
to the public’s eye by the cour-  
ageous actions of suffering men  
and women behind bars. Un-  
less the attention (public) that  
has been raised turns into  
action, no changes will result.  
We must show those who run  
the institutions that we will no  
longer condone abuse and mis-  
use of human beings. Thus, the  
success of the lawsuit for the  
women is totally dependent on  
the people’s support, provided  
that support is displayed by ac-  
tions.

All planned activities will be  
centered around the full hear-  
ings, scheduled now for Janu-  
ary 16, 1976. (Changes in the  
court dates are often used to  
confuse efforts to organize — so  
be on the lookout for sudden  
changes.) Requested activities  
suggested by Action for Forgot-  
ten Women are: (1) people  
should fill up the courtroom each  

Big Mama Rag _ Vol. 4 No. 2  

and every day hearings are con-  
ducted, (2) that various organ-  
izations and people call press  
conferences to announce their  
support; (3) that letters of sup-  
port be addressed and sent to  
either or both of the following:

The Honorable Judge Dupree  
U.S. District Court  
Eastern District of N. C.  
Raleigh, N. C.  

The Honorable James  

Holshouser, Governor  
Governor's Office  
Raleigh, N. C.  

or to your legislator. Copies of  
the letters should be sent to  
AFW. Also, editorials should be  
sent to the newspapers stress-  
ing your support of the women at  
N.C.C.C.W. and asking for their  
support by printing those edi-  
torials and helping to educate  
the masses; (4) that a picket line  
be set up at least the first day of  
the hearings in Raleigh and peri-  
odically after that depending on  
how long the hearings last (any  
other cities that can be organ-  
ized to do so will be needed.)

We do not wish to dictate any  
actions as objective circum-  
stances differ from area to area.  
We do however, hope that the  
community will remember its  
courageous sisters on or about  
January 16, 1976 and that each  
of you will act to show your sup-  
port and either join us in Ral-  
eigh or organize your own ac-  
tions in your area.

Take the opportunity to be  
heard. No longer will we con-  
done brutality! For further infor-  
mation contact Action for For-  
gotten Women. (919-286-0538)

Yours in the struggle,
