The simplest human unhappiness is the lost orgasm. Brain tissue
normally sends the message to the body: "Release!" It is supposed to be
the neural shutout of accumulated electrical tensions. These stress
feelings are the normal residues from daily thought production. If they
are excreted, the next day’s thought production flows and grows
smoothly. If not, constipation happens.

A generation ago, it was the great revelation by Kinsey that most
American women never achieved orgasm. Recent studies cheer that
now we are down to 50%. But what of the other 50%? It is like saying
that half of the human population is dying of constipation. Sex therapy
clinics are rushing in to exploit the market. Some charge as much as
$2,000 for an unguaranteed therapy. When ignorance controls a socie-
ty, the money-milkers move in on the defenseless population. Just who
do you think can come up with two grand for a grand come? Not the
poor.

The biggest secret of all time is that you can do it yourself. Brain self-
control is a democratic right. It is the wave of the future. Just learn to
control your own brain and you can give yourself all the goods that the
“authorities” and “experts” try to sell you at a high fee. Once you get
into the habit of taking responsibility for what goes into your brain and
what comes out, you will discover an endless list of goodies. And they
are all free.

Orgasm Release Method

All theory of sex therapy boils down to a simple list of common sense
self-therapy:

1. Relax. By simply believing you can get everything you have com-
ing to you in this life, you do get it. Trust.

2. Write, “What do I WANT?!” The simplest therapy of all is just to
take a pencil and paper, and for the first true time in your life, write
down what you want to come out of your personal brain. It will come.
Your own common sense — your intuitions — will keep you within the
limits of your own reality.

3. Priorities. Arrange your “I want” list from 1 to 10 in proper order
of practical problem-solving. Solve the most pressing problems first so
they will relax your unconscious/sub-threshold automatic priority list.
When you violate this list the brain machine jerks and stops. Solve the
most subtle problem last.

4. Self-Caressing. Do you love your SELF? Truly? Do. For only thus
can you be the best judge of what feels best to release your tension;
your brain shit. If you are a church/parent inhibited about your own
God-given naturalness, write this out in plain words for your eyes to
see. Understanding is therapy. Love your own body. Trust your body to
give your brain the completing circuit message: “Release!”

5. Beloved. Now share your self-understanding with a mature —
trusted — other person who wants to learn to love you too. Two
negatives do not make a positive in the game of life. Two ego-sucking
immature humans do not make a mature love of life. But two positives
open the brain to the whole Universe of new, chain-reacting joy-meaning.

marketed.
A similar omission is that
trichomonas is often seen in
company with gonorrhea and
since the latter may not have
many symptoms of its own at
that stage, a culture should be
done if a woman has any reason
to believe she might have been
exposed to gonorrhea.

This article can't be ended
before mentioning just a couple
of the outstanding points made
in Circle One. A few brief
paragraphs about women and
research make the important
point of research as a tool to
regain the power of control over
our own bodies. The articles on
masturbation are nothing short
of fantastic. Last in the book but
high on the list for getting some
heavy thought processes going
is an article entitled “Sado-
masochism.”
