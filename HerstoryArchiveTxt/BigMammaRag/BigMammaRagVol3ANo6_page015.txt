Episcopal Women

On April 30, Father William  
Wendt, rector of St. Stephen and  
the Incarnation Church, stood  
trial in Ecclesiastical Court of the  
Episcopal Church for allowing  
the Reverend Alison Cheek, one  
of the Philadelphia 11 women  
whose ordination was ruled  
invalid by the House of Bishops,  
to celebrate communion in his  
church contrary to the request of  
Bishop Creighton that he not  
allow her to do so. Father Wendt  
is being charged with violating  
church law and his ordination  
vows by failing to obey his  
bishop, and the prosecution  
claimed that the trial had  
nothing to do with the ordination  
of women. But Fr. Wendt’s  
defense produced an impressive  
string of witnesses who testified  
that 1) the Philadelphia ordina-  
tion was valid, even though  
irregular and 2) that the exercise  
of Christian conscience is more  
important than obedience to the  
bishop. On obedience Alison  
Cheek said, ‘I believe obedience  
must have a corrective. In this  
20th Century we have seen that  
obedience for the sake of  
obedience can lead to the rise of  
the Nazi regime and Hitler's  
Germany.” (Washington Post)

The question of ordaining  
women to the priesthood of the  
Episcopal Church will come up  
again at the next General Con-  
vention in September, 1976.

Displaced Homemakers Bill  
Tish Somners, National Coor-  
dinator of the NOW Task Force  
on Older Women,  
is proposing legislation at  
the State and  
provide services  
to “displaced homemakers”  
without income, ineligible for  
welfare, who have the highest  
unemployment rate of any in the  
workforce, and face discrimina-  
tion because they are women,  
older, and with no recent work  
experience. They are ineligible  
for unemployment insurance  
because of unpaid labor in the  
home, are too young for Social  
Security or don’t qualify because  
they are divorced from the wage  
earner, are not eligible for  
Medicare, and are unacceptable  
to private insurance plans  
because of their sex and age. For  
further information: Tish  
Somners, 434 66th Street,  
Oakland, Calif., 94609.

Lesbians and the Army

On April 7, Pfc. Randolph of  
Jeffersonville, Ind., and Pvt. 2nd  
Class Watson of San Antonio,  
Tex., told the Army they were  
lesbians.

Partly to avoid alleged harass-  
ment, they were the first and,  
thus far, the only women to go to  
officials voluntarily to discuss  
their homosexuality.

Both were being trained at the  
Army Security School at Fort  
Devens, Mass., and were  
members of the honor platoon.  
Now, they have been put on  
security hold and face discharge  
proceedings. “I want to stay in  
the military and make it my  
career. The Army says I'm unfit.  
But I'm not,” said Ms. Randolph,  
who was named WAC of the  
Month and Soldier of the Month  
just prior to the disclosure. But  
the Army, after intensive  
questioning by the Criminal  
Investigation Division, decided  
they were unfit for the special  
security agency. With the aid of  
several organizations, the two  
women said they would, “take it  
to the courts, if necessary,” to  
avoid a general discharge which  
spokesmen for Gay Media Ac-  
tion said “often limits a person's  
ability to obtain a civilian job, and  
denies the person access to  
nearly all veterans benefits.”

Denver Politics

On Capitol Hill in District 10 in  
the June 10th election Cathy  
Donohue and Sally Brown op-  
posed each other. Their stands  
were described as virtually the  
same on issues but Brown was  
portrayed by our local  
newspapers as calm and  
therefore, more desirable and  
Donohue as angry. Donohue  
won. Does that tell us  
something?
