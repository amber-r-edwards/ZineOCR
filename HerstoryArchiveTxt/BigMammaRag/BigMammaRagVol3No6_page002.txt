Perhaps the most significant  
aspect of the current women’s  
revolution is its spiritual nature  
underlying all action. The  
women’s revolution is, at its very  
core, spiritual. It is this spirituality  
which sets our movement  
apart from all others throughout  
history. While we are aware of  
the inequities which exist in the  
current socio-cultural system  
and strive to correct these, we  
envision a change in structure  
far greater than a redistribution  
of wealth and power. If women  
are “never satisfied,” it is  
because we have been asked to  
satisfy ourselves with a static,  
straight-line, dead end and dying  
system. It is this unwillingness  
to settle for a “piece of the pie”  
that prompted Ti-Grace Atkinson  
to resign as President of the  
New York chapter of NOW in  
1968. What we seek is a total  
change in ethics — a total  
change in meaning.  

The necessary element of this  
type of re-thinking and re-  
structuring is the ability to see  
beyond what is to what can be: a  
vision. Vision is both the source  
and product of our spirituality as  
we move into the space of  
Becoming, always Becoming.  

Wholeness and Healing  

The sense of wholeness, both  
individually and collectively, is  
the spiritual goal of women. The  
process of becoming whole is  
healing. Wholeness is life in an  
integrated form, in which we are  
not alienated from ourselves  
and our powers. Women’s ex-  
istence has been, and largely  
remains, in a divided state.  
Patriarchy has relegated us to a  
position of non-being. Our ex-  
istence has been stolen from us,  
so that generations of women  
have lived lives that have been  
shattered and splintered. We are  
now in a process, both in-  
dividually and collectively, of  
reuniting and making ourselves  
whole again. The actual way in  
which wholeness manifests in  
women is unique to each  
woman, but part of the process is  
an identification and bonding  
with other women.  

What is the “healing” quality  
of a woman's revolution? If we  
start with the assumption that  
the psyches of women have  
been wounded, seriously in-  
jured, often murdered during the  
period of patriarchy, we can see  
that, individually and collective-  
ly, we have been in need of heal-  
ing for thousands of years.  
Traditionally, women were the  
healers of humankind, both  
physically and mentally, and this  
tradition has continued in  
women’s function as mother,  
although women receive little  
credit for this valuable skill. This  
function has survived through  
the ages in the form of soothing  
the jangled nerves, in kissing  
and bandaging the stubbed toe,  
in listening to children “tell  
Mama all about it.” Now this  
nurturance is being turned back  
to ourselves, for there is no other  
source.  

We are becoming whole,  
becoming healed, moving, not in  
a straight line, death-bound, ex-  
istential (male) path, but in ever  
widening circles with an ever  
more potent center.  

It is this moving into spirit, into  
energy, into wholeness, this be-  
ing healed that marks all the  
writings of women. Whether  
they deal with the future or the  
far distant past, the generic  
memory of what once was or the  
vision of the life and lives we can  
create, healing and wholeness  
show themselves as the thread  
we grasp that leads us through  
the labyrinth and defines our  
space.  

Language as Bondage.  

This attempt to redefine life,  
its purpose and its meaning, is  
the paradox at the root of our ef-  
forts. In defining, we use words  
and methods of thinking. Our  

The Spiritual Revolution  

language has been male created  
and, as such, ill serves the pur-  
poses and needs of women. The  
patterns of thought we know  
are, likewise, male created;  
hierarchical. To break with these  
learned methods requires, in  
part, the use of them. If men’s  
words define us, we can use  
them in ways that alter our own  
concepts of their meanings. We  
can become ‘witches’: women  
with knowledge of herbs and  
healing, the skills of midwifery,  
knowing the cycles and balance  
of our mother the earth. If we  
think the way we have words for,  
we can name ourselves into new  
being. A Feminist witches coven  
in New York tells us we can  
become witches by saying three  
times, “I am a witch,” and  
believing it. The language  
becomes divested of its op-  
pressive power when the very  
terms which have been used to  
denounce us become symbols of  
freedom, symbols of us.  

Moving Through Symbols  

We create our own symbols  
which express the meanings of  
our lives. The women’s symbol  
has come to mean more than  
simply “woman,” or the goddess  
Venus. And more, even, than the  
ancient moon and cross of this  
goddess. For women today, it  
represents Feminism and all  
that is implied in that term: a  
resurgence of woman power  
and attunement to the cycles  
and harmonies of our mother,  
the earth, as we listen through  
our bodies to that unity. The  
moon moves, pulling the oceans  
with her. As she passes through  
her phases each month, she  
pulls us with her. These phases  
manifest physically in our  
bodies, through monthly  
menstrual cycles. Planting by  
the moon is as old as any records  
we have and still exists today,  
not out of superstition, but  
because it works. Perhaps we do  
not know how it works, but we  
know that it does.  

The oldest concept of deity we  
have discovered is the Great or  
Blessed Mother. She is the sym-  
bol worshipped in the most an-  
cient culture of the world. There  
is something so real in this con-  
cept of the Blessed Mother that  
her strength is uncompromising.  

Becoming Whole  

Early Christianity was forced to  
adapt itself to this concept, in the  
form of the Virgin Mary, before it  
was acceptable to its followers  
as a bona fide religion. Nature  
has always been called  
“mother.” Even today in our  
defiling capitalistic culture, this  
basic concept, though weak,  
remains: a margarine commer-  
cial tells us, “It's not nice to fool  
Mother Nature.”  

Not all symbols are as ancient  
as the moon or the Great  
Mother. As we grow we create  
new symbols that express the  
meanings of our lives. Interlock-  
ed Venus symbols have come  
into being to represent the  
emerging meaning of  
Lesbianism. Indeed, dykes  
themselves have become a sym-  
bol of unified women-energy  
and the strength of sisterhood. If  
this symbol causes fear in some,  
it is the fear of something which  
stands outside current realities  
and is not afraid of that frontier.  

Creating Ritual  

Yet, women, while creating  
new symbols and new realities,  
have been extremely reluctant to  
deal with ritual and religion, ex-  
cept to denounce it. Much of this  
fear is surely justified, arising  
from our knowledge of the  
effects on our lives of the rituals  
and religions we have known.  
But by our blanket rejection of  
these concepts we have failed to  
even ask the question, “What  
might be the relevance of ritual  
and religion to Feminism?” If we  
accept that Feminism is more  
than a political issue, that it is a  
spiritual movement, we must ex-  
amine these concepts. Perhaps  
religion, in its purest sense, is  
the feeling of personal and com-  
munal spiritual knowledge ex-  
pressed through ritual, through  
something a community does  
together that signifies its beliefs.  

We have seen the dangers of  
rituals which lock us into the  
patriarchy, and we want to es-  
cape these. Yet who among us is  
not aware of Christmas, Easter,  
Thanksgiving or Hanukkah, even  
if she does not celebrate them?  
Ritual remains with us. If we do  
not create our own to signify the  
importance of our values, we  
will have instead those which  
maintain the very institutions  
we are attempting to leave  
behind.  

Summer Solstice has been  
celebrated for the past two years  
in New Mexico. It is a symbolic  
ritual celebration which, by  
awakening our generic memory of  
the significance of the moon and  
the Earth Mother, helps to move  
our minds through an incredible  
expanse of time, freeing us from  
the trap of a present which gives  
us no past and shows us no  
future. A religion built on that  
which is meaningful to women  
could, perhaps, help us to accept  
that there are things which are  
beyond our control. The move-  

ment, the cycles of the Great  
Mother and our place within that  
pattern, now involuntary, can  
become a conscious flow of life  
in harmony when we can see it  
through time, see it as eternal. It  
could help us relinquish the  
desire for control, which has  
always destroyed the earth, and  
open us up to the harmonious  
forces of spirituality moving  
within us. Our own healing and  
wholeness integrated with the  
mother’s, moving through time  
from day to day in a constant  
Becoming.  

Building Tomorrow  

What is happening in the  
women's movement is that in-  
dividual acts are becoming  
collective values, which are part  
of the communal process of be-  
ing. By healing the wounds of  
separation from ourselves and  
from each other, we bring  
wholeness to ourselves. In the  
recent wave of Feminism, the  
consciousness-raising group  
was the first experience of group  
healing by women that most of  
us ever had.  

The remaining part of this  
process of healing is that of be-  
ing whole. The sense of being  
alive and of constant becoming  
generates more energy with  
which we can heal more and  
more sisters on more and more  
levels. Ultimately, creativity,  
springing from our centers and  
focusing our energy, results  
from both individual  
centeredness and from con-  
scious collective centeredness.  
Through this creativity we can  
build a new life and a Whole  
world.
