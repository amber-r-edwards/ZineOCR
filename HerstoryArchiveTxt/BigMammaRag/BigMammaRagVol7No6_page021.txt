San Francisco -  
Out Of The Courtroom And Onto The  

CONTINUED FROM PAGE 3  

There is no question that the pro-  
secution must bear the largest share  
of the guilt for the White verdict.  
There exists ample evidence that Dan  
White hated Moscone and Milk and that  
he went to City Hall intending viol-  
ence. The case was so badly handled  
by the prosecution that one has to  
wonder if it was planned that way.  

The murders it was predictable that  
the defense would introduce psychia-  
tric evidence indicating this. Right?  
Wrong: According to assistant Dist-  
rict Attorney Norman he never expect-  
ed the battery of psychiatric wit-  
nesses the defense used and was un-  
prepared to counter their testimony.  
He called one witness who was com-  
pletely unprepared for the cross ex-  

WE GOT COOLED OUT TUESDAY,  
BUT WE RIOTED MONDAY  

There are three major areas of  
error:  

1) Dan White's Confession.  
White gave his confession to Frank  
Falzon, Chief Homicide Investigator  
for the San Francisco Police Depart-  
ment. Falzon was a friend and a for-  
mer softball coach to White. The nor-  
mal procedure, which Falzon was un-  
doubtedly aware of, with the inter-  
rogator asking questions to clarify  
and probe for weaknesses and lies in  
the statement. Falzon instead said,  
"Normally we ask questions but in  
this case because I am aware of your  
past history as a police officer and  
also as a San Francisco fireman, I  
would prefer, I'll let you do it in  
a narrative form as to what happened  
this morning." The only question  
from Falzon after the statement was,  
"Can you relate these pressures you  
have been under, Dan, at this time?"  
No questions about why he was carry-  
ing a gun, how he got into City  
Hall with it, why he carried extra  
ammunition, why he shot Moscone four  
times and Milk five times?, etc. When  
the assistant District Attorney Tom  
Norman was asked why he entered this  
spurious confession into evidence,  
he answered simply that parts of it  
were "damaging" to the defendant.  
Norman also could have told the  
jury about the close relationship  
between Falzon and White and explain-  
ed the deficiencies of the confession  
to the jury. He did neither. To cri-  
ticize the confession would have  
meant criticizing the Police Depart-  
ment and in effect accusing Falzon  
of trying to whitewash White's  
crime. Political suicide for Norman  
and his boss District Attorney Frei-  
tas.  
Because the defense case depended  
almost entirely upon proving that  
White was unbalanced at the time of  

examination because no follow-up inter-  
views had been held. The prosecution  
also neglected to introduce the nu-  
merous examples of White's past vi-  
olent record, which included his  
watching while his aides beat up  
people after an open meeting. White  
himself assisted in breaking up an  
opposition meeting on his "turf" by  
threats and intimidation. None of  
this was ever heard! The defense  
contention that White was a good boy  
under a lot of pressure was never  
challenged.  

The third area of error was in ne-  
glecting the obvious political mo-  
tives of Dan White. DA Norman: "He  
assassinated George Moscone to retali-  
ate for George's not reappointing him  
like he promised him. But, I mean, it  
is not a political assassination like a  
guy who has certain political ideals  
or beliefs that he's clinging to."  
Political ideals and beliefs that  
he's clinging to did, in fact, des-  
cribe Dan White very well.  

The "malice aforethought" that  
White felt at the time he killed was  
personal malice and political malice.  
He hated Milk because he was gay  
(social deviant in White's words -  
personal malice) and he hated Moscone  
because he was a liberal mayor who  
made efforts to help the disenfran-  
chised groups of San Francisco (Po-  
litical malice). White, on the other  
hand, was a fanatical right-winger  
who campaigned against “social de-  
viants" and the city's "criminal ele-  

ment," euphemisms for gays and blacks.  

To have pictured Dan White as a poli-  
tical assassin would have helped the  
state's case but it would also have  
meant taking on the police department  
and opening up the suppressed divi-  
sions between cops and gays. Worse,  
it would have been necessary to por-  
tray Dan White (the ex-cop and friend  
of cops as he was) as a bad guy. Tom

Wrinkles Away  

The cosmetic industry is marketing  
yet another product for those weary  
souls stuck on the long road to the  
Fountain of Youth-- wrinkle removers.  
Just rub these mineral-based facial  
creams on each morning and enjoy up  
to eight wrinkle-free hours, or so  
claim the manufacturers of "Line Tam-  
er," “Ever Smooth," “Secret Miracle,"  
and "Wrinkles Away." Aimed at the  
over 30 crowd, the wrinkle smoothers  
sell for up to $50 an ounce and some  
producers are predicting they'll be  
the hot item in the future.

Women who smoke cigarettes need  
not only be aware of the damage  
they do their lungs, but of the dam-  
age they may be doing the women who  
work in the tobacco industry. If you  
are smoking a Winston, Salem, Camel,  
Doral, Vantage, More, Now, or Real  
cigarette, switch brands if you  
can't quit. These brands are current-

THE OLD VELMA  

PSTOKIINS.  

Norman, the prosecutor was not a be-  
ginner in the area of criminal pro-  
secutions. He has, conservatively,  
prosecuted several hundred murder  
cases. With this additional fact it  
is clear that the omissions and "mis-  
takes" he made were politically mo-  
tivated and, to say the least, his  
heart really was not in his work  
during this trial. Had he zealously  
performed his job he would have been  
a minor hero to some, but a few thou-  
sand cops would have hated his guts.  
Given that balance, cowardice won.  

2) The Jury.  

The jury are the ones, after every-  
thing is said, make the decisions.  
This jury was composed of no gays, no  
blacks, no poor people, no Chicanos  
and no liberals. This jury was made  
of Dan White's people - even an ex-  
cop. The defense had a profile of  

the type of juror they wanted: white  
working-class men and women who would  
be close enough to Dan White's own  
social class so as to identify and  
sympathize with him. Again, the pro-  
secution made no attempt to block the  
defense strategy. Even if the trial  
had been ruthlessly prosecuted, which  
it was not, this jury could have  

come out with the same verdict be-  
cause interpretation of malice would  
ultimately depend on personal be-  
liefs and emotions and not on the  
cold hard facts of murder. The jury  
felt sorry for Dan White - he had  
been pushed into murder by frustra-  
tions beyond his control.  

"A man with a background like Dan  
White's simply does not go out and  
shoot two people like George Mos-  
cone and Harvey Milk unless something  
is terribly wrong," said the defense.  

The jury believed this - they  
wanted to believe it because White's  
background was the same as theirs.  

He could have been their son or bro-  
ther or husband. What would have  
happened if the mayor of San Fran-  
cisco or Los Angeles or Denver was  
assassinated by a black? or a gay? —  
or a poor person? Would the assassin  
even have lived to be tried?  

Public statements of city offici-  
als, including the mayor, and all  
the editorials in newspapers the  
next day agreed: The verdict was ab-  
surd, and justice mangled. The White  
verdict surprised everyone. It  
should not have. Juries are supposed-  
ly erratic and “uncallable"; in this  
case all the factors evident in any  
murder prosecution meshed perfectly  
to make the verdict of voluntary  

Back at the Farm  

A $10 million class action suit was  
filed in District Court in June  

against the State Farm Insurance Com-  
pany for discriminating against women  

in their hiring and training programs.  

The suit, filed on behalf of all fe-  
male applicants and potential appli-  
cants for sales agent posts in Cali-  
fornia, says that qualified women  
were barred from those positions by  
sexually discriminatory employment  
practices and policies. State Farm,  
the nation's largest car and home in-  
surance company, employs fewer than  
2% of women as sales agents, while  
women make up 50% of the work force  
in the insurance industry.

Manslaughter obvious and easy for the  
jurors: 1) the law, 2) the defense,  
3) the prosecution, 4) the jury it-  
self. The last three factors, the  
people of the defense, prosecution  
and the jury were all of the same  
persuasion: white, middle-class, con-  
servative citizens - the same as Dan  
White - and given the vague defini-  
tions of murder inherent in the law,  
the jurors were free to interpret as  
they chose. The people murdered (a  
liberal and a gay) were not "close  

to the hearts" of anyone involved in  
the trial. But Dan White was. He  

was one of their own.

Police Revenge  

CONTINUED FROM PAGE 3  

At 2 p.m. Deputy Chief of Police  
Kevin Mullen ordered the riot squad  
to withdraw. He was answered by his  
own men with angry shouts like,  
"you're an asshole" and "you've got  
no guts" and worse. He had to physi-  
cally restrain several of his men.  

This unwarranted and bloody revenge  
after the riot was so blatant that  
every straight newspaper in San Fran-  
cisco reported it and condemned it.  
Within days a committee of citizens  
was appointed to investigate both  
the police brutality on Castro Street  
and the instigation of the lesbian/  
gay riot at City Hall earlier that  
night. Ads were run in all the alter-  
native newspapers, requesting infor-  
mation on the police brutalities. But  
in late June the committee of citizens  
was called off by Mayor Dianne Fein-  
stein, for legal reasons concerning  
the liability of such a citizen's  
panel. The investigation was turned  
over to the Police and Fire Commis-  
sioners, which is concurrently a  
Grand Jury investigation going on in  
San Francisco, with the same con-  
fusing DUAL purpose. Information is  
scarce but BMR will have a follow-  
up as soon as the information is  
available.

practice law because she lives with  
a man who is not her husband, the  
Virginia Supreme Court ruled unani-  
mously. Bonnie Cord, a lawyer for  
the Energy Department in Washington  
had been denied permission by a state  
trial judge in 1978 to take the Vir-

that she was not married to the man  
she shared a house with.

Lesbian Vets  

If you are a lesbian who was dis-  
charged from the US Armed Forces with  
a less than honorable discharge mere-  
ly because of your sexuality, it  
is now possible to have these dis-  
charges upgraded. In 1976 a limited  
amnesty bill was passed by both  
houses of Congress and signed into  
law, however, there is a time limit  
for applications to upgrade these  
discharges. Until January 1, 1980,  
with proper legal guidance, it is  
possible for lesbians to have their  
discharges upgraded to honorable and  
receive all the attendant benefits,  
unless you were convicted of an of-  
fense involving force or conduct in-  
volving sex with minors. Contact the
