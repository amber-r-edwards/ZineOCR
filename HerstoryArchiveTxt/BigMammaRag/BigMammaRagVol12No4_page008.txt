I can't remember the last  
time a book moved me as  
much as Sitt Marie Rose, a  
novel about a Christian  

woman who is executed for  

her support of the Palestinian  
resistance during the  
1975 Lebanese civil war.  

I was inspired to buy this  
book after reading about its  
impact on Cypress in her ar-  
ticle, "Why I Am No Longer  
A Zionist," (BMR, Dec.  
1983). As it was for Cypress, Sitt  
Marie Rose was a catalyst  
for me; if it didn't change  
my convictions, it definite-  
ly changed my perceptions.  

While this book is a his-  
tory of sorts, there are no  
references to battle dates,  
treaties or chronologies of  
political factions. Rather,  
this book stays with you as  
a series of images that re-  
appear every night on TV  
films of the current civil  
war in Lebanon. There's a  
familiar kind of inevitabil-  
ity to watching the news  
now: yes, of course, this  
must happen; it's happened  
already. The author, Etel  
Adnan, takes you behind the  
explosions. How do people  
live through such times?  

"...Saturation and panic  
begin to make themselves  
felt. Phone calls between  
friends become shorter and  
more frequent. In the street  
younger and younger militia  
men make their appearance.  
They employ children for  
their suppleness. They crawl  
under the line of fire and  
gather up abandoned arms in  
the adversary camp. They  
also learn to love the Party  
and how to die."  

A short book - only 105  
pages, Sitt Marie Rose tells  
the story of a woman, a  
teacher of deaf-mutes in  
Beirut, who is captured, in-  
terrogated and killed by a  
right-wing Christian militia  
in front of her students.  
She is to be a "lesson" to  
them; her support of the  
Moslem/Palestinians makes  
her a traitor.  

The irony of the book is  
that Marie Rose, who carries  
the name and symbol of the  
virgin Mary, is the ultimate  
Christian martyr. In an Arab  

society bound by loyalty to  

tribe and family, like cells  
in a body, Marie Rose leaves  
her community to become the  

“impossible mutation."  

She represents a vision of  
Arab unity which demands, as  
a prerequisite, the integra-  
tion of the Palestinians,  
who are,  

"...no longer nomads com-  
forted by their tribe...but  
a people perpetually pursued  
...by their self-proclaimed  
brothers as well as the ad-  
versary, without a single  
square meter of certainty  
or security under their  
feet."  

Throughout much of the  
book, Marie Rose's captors  

accuse, argue, demand rea-  
sons - a collective Pontius  
Pilate. Led by Mournir, a  
spoiled rich kid who loved  
Marie Rose at the age of  
16, the four captors fail  
to see in her the true  
Christ, who exists only  
“when one stands up to one's  
own brothers to defend the  
Stranger."  

Instead, the captors - as  
well as much of Christian  
Beirut - see Christianity,  
armed "with helmets and  
boots, riding its horses in-  
to the clash of arms, spear-

ing Moslem foot soldiers  
like so many St. George's  
with so many dragons.”  
Mournir tells Marie Rose  
that her fate would be dif-  
ferent if she would show  
some remorse. She responds  
that she is defending a  
common culture, the Pales-  
tinian and the Lebanese.  
"But if I've taken their  
part with pain against yours,  
it's because our survival  
depends on theirs." Further-  
more, she reminds them, she  
is not alone. Fighting with  
her for the Palestinians is  
both Christian and Moslem.  

Yet while Marie Rose be-  
comes a martyr to the Pales-  
tinian cause, she is no  
cardboard saint. She is the  
mother of three, a wife who  
left her husband, now the  
lover of a Palestinian doc-  
tor, who, once her capture  
is announced, offers to  
trade places with her. Adnan  
gives you a love story in  
this book, but it is never  
sentimentalized.  

Marie Rose loves her child-  
ren, but has problems teach-  
ing them her values:  

"..They hear about  
Christians being pulled off  

barricades, castrated, hack-  
ed up with axes, and thrown  
into garbage cans. People  
have broken into offices to  
take the Moslems sitting  
there, draw and quarter them,  
and watch them die in a howl  
of pain. I have trouble con-  
vincing my children that  

all this is obscene.  

"They think of one thing  
only: growing up and fighting.  
And when I tell them  
all this is absolute evil,  
they tell me that it's writ-  
ten in the Bible that God  
hates the enemy. And when I  
ask them where God is and  
who is the enemy, they  
throw themselves against my  
chest, kissing me, and  
ceasing to understand."  

Marie Rose also admits  
that she is preoccupied with  
a fear of torture. This ad-  

mission was one of the things  
that humanized her for me.  
She often remembers the  

words of a Belgian journalist  
she met who admitted that he  
was also afraid of torture  
while in Vietnam. He tells  
her that he promised him-  
self that if he were ever  
tortured and the pain got  

too bad, he would show such  
outrageous defiance that his  
tormentors would kill him  
quickly.  

In reading this book, I  
wondered whether its magic  
held me because it connect-  
ed with some old passionate  
moments in my Catholic past  
when I was absorbed in books  
about the Christian martyrs.  

I don't think this book  
will necessarily convert  
you to a particular politi-  
cal view. There is something  
truly universal about this  
novel, I think. Marie Rose  
could have been an Israeli,  
a Sandinista, a Vietnamese -  
and I would have been just  
as moved by her story:  
moved by the complexity of  
war, the failure of any pol-  
itical effort to totally  
eradicate its causes, the  
heroism of people who fight  
for something anyway, know-  
ing that eventually their  
revolution too will be be-  
trayed.  

Looking beneath the bril-  
liance of her writing, what  
is Adnan saying about the  
Lebanese conflict, about  
the cruelty of war? Her  
main theme is an indictment  
of tribal behavior: in the  
Middle East, the family,  
the clan, the state, sur-  
rounding Arab countries,  
and the superpowers, all  
form circles of oppression.  
What all forces in the Mid-  
dle East have failed to do,  
she says, is to feel "the  
opposition between that in-
