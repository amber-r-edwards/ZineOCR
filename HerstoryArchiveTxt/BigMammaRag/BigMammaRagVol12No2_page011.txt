Denver, Colorado & Throughout The US

But as I got more involved
with the progressive and
revolutionary groups in Colo-
rado, etc. I came across a
new brand of anti-Semitism,
and in a place where I didn’t
expect to find it...in the
Left.

In the past years BMR has
received and printed info
from the John Brown Anti-Klan
Committee in Chicago, a strong
group working to counteract
the racist acts and words of
the Ku Klux Klan. They speak
of the importance of whites
to support Black people's
struggles and talk of the
dangers of the White Suprem-
acy movements. In all the
leaflets, news articles,
sent, they have never yet
addressed how these White
supremacy groups attack the
Jewish people. It is well
known that the Klan takes
violent action against both
Blacks and Jews...but the
Anti-Klan group has not even
mentioned the anti-Semitism
of the Klan. How can they
ignore (either as a deliberate
strategy or as an oversight)
this gross anti-Semitism of
the Klan? I believe it is
because of their own anti-
Semitism! At BMR we have both
written and spoken to the
John Brown Anti-Klan Committee
about their very obvious
omission of the Klan's anti-
Semitism and they have never
responded.

"As the issue of Palestine/
Israel is presented, most
revolutionary groups take a
pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel,
anti-Zionist position. I do
not believe that it is anti-
Semitic to support the Pal-
estinian people and their
struggle but I do believe
that many Left groups have
approached the issue in an
anti-Semitic way.

etc.,

Su-

vi-

Women Against Imperialism
(WAI) for example, has only
given lip service that anti-
Semitism exists. In its paper
on Zionism and White Supremacy
they do say that "Anti-Semitism
has a long and ugly his-
tory, and today it is grow-
ing along with the rise of
the right. As recently as
the 1940's, genocide was com-
mitted against 6 million Jews.
As European fascism system-
atically carried out one of
the worst crimes in history,
most of the world watched,
silent and inactive. These
facts are abhorrent and very
real--but we feel that the
conclusions many people are
drawing from these experienc-
es are wrong and dangerous."
BUT, in fact, the world is
still watching, sometimes in
silence, sometimes in inact-
ivity, but often with much
activity...against the Jewish
people.

WAI feels that “equating
anti-Semitism with the op-
pression of colonized people
lets white (women) evade our
responsibility to oppose
white supremacy." Anyone
saying that anti-Semitism
and racism are the same,
needs to look more clearly
at what is going on in the
world but those who only
recognize anti-Semitism as
a thing of the past need to
look at their own anti-Semi-
tism.

WAI continues throughout
their paper saying that Jews
are not under attack as a
people...that genocide is
not a threat to the Jewish
people...that the police,
the Klan and the law and or-
der movements and the US
government are not concerned
with Jews. This is untrue
and is anti-Semitic to say
so.

It is the responsibility
of Jewish people to recognize
and fight against all forms
of oppression. It is also
the responsibility of the
Left to recognize anti-Semi-
tism as oppression. And it
must also be recognized by
the Left/revolutionary groups
that not all Jews are white!
There is a large population
of Jews (within and outside
of Israel/Palestine) that
are people of color. They
are clearly the victims of
imperialism and anti-Semitism.

While the Left and revolu-
tionary groups are ignoring
present-day anti-Semitism,
the Right is actively fight-
ing against the Jews.

In just the past few months
groups such as BMR, The Big
Mountain Support Group,
Horizons Bookstore, have
received some of the "hate"
literature that is so widely
distributed throughout Colo-
rado.

There are many White Supre-
macist groups right here in
Colorado. Their tactics in
Jew-hating range from untrue
accusations of Jews control-
ling all money and ruling
the world, to agreement with
the Final Solution of killing
off all non-Aryan peoples
(the theory and strategy
which Hitler used in Nazi
Germany to commit genocide
on Jews, political progres-
sives, Gypsies, homosexuals,
"mental patients", handicapped,
etc.).

In Fort Lupton, Co., The
Primrose and Cattleman's
Gazette is published by the
National Agricultural Press
Association (NAPA). "NAPA
is a national network of
information consolidated and
released to help ensure Amer-
ica's greatest heritage, the
common men and women of the
land, and the small business
community." For years the

its sinister
forces for
racial war

and hatred,

y cromd under nartved wien, preparing for the ‘eventual war.”
Gazette has run articles that
are actively anti-Semitic
and anti-communist. From 1981
through 1983, they have
printed "The Hidden Tyranny"
a long series of articles
“exposing world power of
Jews". It covers at length
the false propaganda that
Jews control the media, radio
newspapers, etc. It is clear-
ly a network for anti-Semites
nationally, as it also re-
peatedly receives and pub-
lishes letters that attack
Jews from various bigoted
perspectives, including a
popular position that Nazi
Germany's genocide of six
million Jews was a lie pre-
sented by the Jews for sym-
pathy.

While the Primrose and
Cattleman's Gazette presents
themselves as a national
"community" newsletter, there
are other newsletters and
pamphlets circulated by
groups who publicize as

Churches, religious groups,
survivalists, and anti-tax
groups.

In Colorado there are news-
letters, chapters and train-
ing camps for at least two
Ku Klux Klan (KKK) units,
the Aryan Nations, the Posse
Comitatus, various Nazi
groups and Way International.

Recently literature from
Aryan Nations and The Church
of the Creator has been dis-
tributed from a Denver, CO
Post Office Box address,
under the name of N.S.P.A.

The Death of the White Race,
a leaflet from Aryan Nations,
"has been warning our White
kin that there was a conspir-

Armed men guard Klan boss Bil Wilkinson (in civilian clothes) during back woods

acy to Murder our White Ary-
an Race and that we were
fast approaching the point
of no return." It claims the

time has come! It blames

"The JEWS, who have sworn

to destroy... (the White) Race
and...now own" all major

media companies. The leaflet
continues on white racist

fear of extinction as a pure
White race. It focuses on

statistics that "White Amer-
icans will soon be a small
minority in what was once
(our) land" due to immigration
of "non-whites" and inter-
racial marriages. And recog-
nizes America as the only
stronghold in the world. It
appeals to "WHITEMAN:...We
make a stand NOW or FOREVER
and EVER the beauty of the
Aryan woman and the civiliza-
tion building, creative
genius of the Aryan man is
GONE! !" WHITEWOMAN, think a-
bout the future for your
children. Its message is to
"Love your own kind, fight
for your own kind or perish."
The Church of the Creator/
Nature's Eternal Religion is
even more blatantly Jew-hat-
ing and racist. It states
that Jews control the govern-
ment of the U.S. and the
Federal Reserve Board. The
propaganda tells a fictitious
and inflammatory story of the
"international...scurvy...
gang of Jewish jackals"...
through “treachery, deceit,
bribery, trickery" taking
over the world monies. And
that "Since the program of
the Jews is the total mongrel-
ization and destruction of
