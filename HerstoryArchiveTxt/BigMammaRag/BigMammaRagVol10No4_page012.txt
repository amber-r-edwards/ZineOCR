Two Looks

Personal Best

Janet Singleton

Film is the most lifelike
art, perhaps because it can
encompass the body and spir-
it of all other art forms.
Music, dance, literature can
all be accommodated in cell-
uloid, though they cannot
contain it. Sports also can
thrive within the cinematic
domain. Personal Best proves

This movie, contrary to
the notions promoted by some
of its publicity, is much
more about athletics than
the sexual rapport that de-
velops between its two her-
oines. Even their relation-
ship is a study in how com-
petition can affect a friend-
ship. It is the “self-or-
other?" issue that is the
work's most provocative one.
You might even be prompted
to ask yourself, if you and
your very closest friend we-
re competing for a single
prize to which you had both
dedicated your lives, would
you sacrifice winning or try
any less harder for her?

Chris Cahil (Mariel Hem-
ingway) and Tory Skinner
(Patrice Donnelly) first meet
at the 1976 Olympic Trials.
Chris is very young and in-
secure and her running is
not all that it could be.
Tory, a more mature pentath-
lete, is at her peak. She
becomes Chris' friend, lover,
mentor—then competitor. The
last role is harshly contra-
dictory to the others and
erodes what they have built
between them.

In the telling of the sto-
ry the camera does its best
to make us feel what it is
like to be an athlete. The
shots of the women running,
jumping, hurdling are inti-
mate and intense. We see
their breathing and sweating
so well that it seems we are
breathing and sweating with
them. Consequently, we feel
the glory and the pain.

Almost everyone in Per-
sonal Best is a real-life
athlete. Even professional
actress Mariel Hemingway
(Manhattan) qualifies for the
category after the year's
work she did in physical pre-
paration for this movie. Pa-
trice Donnelly was a member
of the world's top-ranking
hurdlers. Jodi Anderson, who
plays a fellow pentathlete,
was the country's female pen-
tathlon star of 1980. The
performances these women give
are part acting, part sport,
and all excellent.

How this film sees a wo-
man's body is, for American
cinema, revolutionary. It is
not a man's body in either
sense of the term, neither as
imitator or property. Sensu-
ality and beauty do not pre-
clude strength and health.
Pleasure is as much for the
taking as the giving.

The first love scene, while
being attended appropriately
by not much ado, derives its
specialness not from its par-
ticipants having the same
gender but through conveyance
of sensation, not conquest.

Sex is at once experimental
and goal-oriented. The goal
is enjoyment; the experiment
is whether the two women can
find it with each other.

The fact that younger Chris
eventually became involved
with a man may seem a compro-
mise to some, an outright
sell-out to others. Yet the
story doesn't reflect it.
Her involvement with a male
swimmer is not shown as the
answer to her relationship
with Tory. It is simply a
different attachment in the
progression of her develop-
ment. That is, if you consi-
der only the film and don't
try to second guess the chi-
ldish prejudices of an inse-
cure society. Deals made in
backrooms should weigh upon
the conscience of the film-
maker, not the enjoyment of
the filmgoer.

Donnelly, clerk, for instance, asks Eve
exactly what lesbians do in
bed. (Eve answers that they
make out fine.)

Van de Ven, who is not gay,
said the bedroom scene was
the hardest.

"I didn't know what to do," 
she explained in an interview
with Advocate reporter K.H.
Garfield... But then I real-
ized that my character had the
same concern: I love you, but
how am I going to touch you?
We (Maria Schneider and she)
had never seen each other
naked before, so for the scene
we just used that reality."

One Dutch women's group ob-
jected to the love scenes,
saying they would titillate
heterosexual men. Another
Dutch group argued that be-
cause Van de Ven is not a les-
bian, she shouldn't play one.

"Nonsense!" Van de Ven re-
sponded when asked by the Ad-
vocate about this latter ob-
jection. "I am an actress:
and I can play anything. People
are people, no matter what
their sexuality."

The actress said her commit-
ment to telling this story
led her to fight for the
role. "I talked to a lot of
gay women and began to rea-
lize that this film had to be
made, and it had to reach a
wide audience," she said.
"This film is for housewives,
for people in the same situ-
ation, who don't go to art
houses."

Housewives should enjoy the
film's discussion of house-
