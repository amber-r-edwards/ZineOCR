Big Mama Rag Vol 3-A, No. 12  

Jackie St. Joan  

On October 19, Elaine Nobel, a  
lesbian-feminist, a working  
class organizer from the working  
class, and a Massachusetts  
state legislator, addressed an  
audience of 150 people at the  
University of Colorado in  
Boulder. Co-sponsored by CU  
Women's Liberation and Gay  
Liberation, Elaine rounded out  
her major address with several  
small group discussions, centered  
on politics — left, right,  
feminist, reality-based electoral  
politics, corruption and coalitions.  
The following are paraphrases of  
some of her remarks.  

On her campaign  

When I decided to run, it had to  
be in the Democratic Party.  
Running as an independent  
would have meant nothing. I had  
to let them know I was serious  
and they were going to have to  

On women in politics  
Politicians traditionally give  
the appearance that they are  
opponents, but really they are all  
working for the same overall  
end. In my mind, candidates are  
secondary to the restructuring of  
the system. Women have had  
politics used against them for so  
long that they fear it. But we  
must get power before it's gotten  
by others and used against us. We  
need our people in there so we  
know what's going on. We need  
a common headset to look at the  
Women, like any group new to  
politics, don’t understand the  
swap principle with politicians. It  
is a moral platitude to think that  
a politician will do something for  
you on a liberal, moral basis if  
you don’t have some support to  
offer. We get burned out and  
disillusioned so quickly if we  
expect someone to do something  
for us.  

They tried to get me unseated  
when I first arrived at the House.  
One of the representatives  
claimed I was a felon (homosexuality  
is illegal in Massachusetts). I  
raised up my tallest and asked if  
the gentleman from Dover was  
afraid that homosexuality was  
contagious, and perhaps he would  
catch it? The House laughter sat  
him down quickly.  

Basically I see politicians as  
technicians. Finding out how  
things get done. Getting things  
done for people. I don’t see  
politics as a life-long career, but as a  
way of learning and of teaching  
others how power can work. Be  
supportive of politicians who  
help you. Motivate them to carry  
your bills. Bills die in committee  
all the time because they have  
no one there to get them out.  

On repression  

We laughed at George Wallace  
when he stood on the school door  
steps in Alabama. Wallace knew  
he had to let those Black students  
in the school; they had a court  
order. He was making political  
hay by being a racist. And on the  
backs of Black school children.  
Years ago we laughed at him.  
Now he’s running for President!  

There's a wave of repression  
coming in this country. Grand  
Juries are investigating our  
communities. The economy is  
failing and working people are  
getting angry. George Wallace  
and Ronald Reagan are running  
for President, and getting support!  

Elaine Nobel Talks  
Politics in Boulder  

deal with me. I'd never even  
been to a ward meeting, and  
after I won the primary, I got a  
letter from the local Democratic  
ward, asking me would I please  
pay my dues and come to a meet-  
ing. I made it so they had to  
support me.  

The people in my district are  
the most wonderful people in the  
world. Mostly working class  
ethnic groups and old people. On  
the day of my election, we were  
worried because we had told the  
voters that if they needed rides  
to the polls to call us and we  
would drive them there. No one  
was calling, and we were  
counting on the senior citizens  
vote. Then one of my poll  
watchers called me up and said  
old Mrs. McCarthy had just  
gotten out of one of my opponent's  
cars, and at first she was  
worried. But Mrs. McCarthy  
walked up to her and whispered,  
“Tell Elaine I called them to  
come get me. I wanted to save  
her the gas money.”  

On being a public lesbian  

During my campaign we had  
many threats, slashed tires, etc.  
One morning I came outside and  
someone had painted the word  
“Lesbian” all over my car. The  
thing that really upset me was  
they spelled it wrong.  

I recently attended a meeting  
of some radical intellectuals in  
Washington to talk about the  
economics of New England. The  
panel leader asked me how I  
wanted to be introduced. I told  
him to introduce me as Elaine  
Nobel, a lesbian feminist. When  
it came time for the introduction,  
he couldn't quite get the word  
out, so he introduced me to  
this group of political men as a  
radical feminist. I said, “Come  
on, Joe, you can say it. Say it  
with me LLEESSSBEEAN. That's  
right. Now say it again. You'll get  
it.”  

On the Left  

One thing I can't stand is  
upper class radicals coming in to  
tell us what we should do — to  
organize. I've been poor all my  
life, and I know these phonies  
when I see them. Like last year,  
one leftist group decided to come  
to Boston to organize the people  
around busing. They started  
more trouble and caused more  
violence than anyone else there.  
I got together with a minority  
group coalition and demanded  
they get out of our town, and I'd  
do it again. If they want to help,  
they should come ask the people  
what they can do to help. And  
the people would probably hand  
them a broom and tell them to  
sweep the place up.  

To prevent politicians from  
being sold out, we must talk of  
long term change. We must  
insist that those who represent  
us be political — be accountable  
to us.  

The Women’s Political Caucus?  
They're terrific. They're the  
only ones helping women to get  
elected. I got none of this stuff  
about my being a Lesbian from  
them. They knew instinctively  
that I had a ready-made constituency.  
They welcomed me right in.  
Give me a political woman any day!  

On politicians  
Politics is to take something  
that is hard and make it look  
easy. Like walking into that  
House Chamber every day. I be-  
lieve in the quantum theory of  
tormenting — that's what keeps  
me going — not to give them the  
satisfaction of my quitting. The  
women usually walk into the  
Chamber arm-in-arm. It drives  
them crazy. They really get ner-  
vous when they see us talking  
with the Blacks too.  

You should have seen them the  
day I first walked into the  
Chamber. Arguing and pushing  
for their new seats. No one ac-  
tually wanted to sit next to me!  
They made sure the women in  
the House would be separated  
from each other.  

We need to make cohesive  
alliances with our political  
friends. We are not a one-issue  
people. To solidify our power,  
working class people, minorities  
and women need to build a  
series of coalitions. In Boston  
last year, we had people riding  
the school buses every day to be  
sure those kids got to school  
safely. Feminists and gay people  
were riding those buses. The  
Black community took close note  
of that fact.  

I'm a member of the Mass.  
House of Representatives Black  
Caucus. How did I get to be a  
member? The head of the caucus  
is a woman. The Black Caucus  
wholly supported me on the gay  
rights bill when I introduced it  
into the state legislature. And to-  
gether we introduced a bill that  
would have forbidden import of  
products from Rhodesia. Neither  
bill passed the House; but the  
coalition process was very im-  
portant politically.  

What happens at your school  
when it comes time to divide up  
the budget? Pay attention. What  
you're doing here is dress re-  
hearsal for the world outside the  
campus. Each of the groups, the  
minority groups, the women’s  
groups, the gay groups, have to  
fight each other for funding.  
Right? What would happen if you  
all got together and agreed that  
at this point you wouldn't argue  
your disagreements, but you  
would approach the Admin-  

istration together? You could tell  
them, you're not cutting any of  
our budgets. We're all getting  
what we want or you have to  
deal with all of us.  

On Massachusetts’  
liberal image  

I love the story Gore Vidal tells,  
about visiting a college in Mas-  
sachusetts. One of the students  
said, “Isn't Massachusetts won-  
derful? We're the only state that  
voted against Nixon.” To which  
Vidal replied, “Massachusetts  
has such a long, traditional his-  
tory of corruption in politics, it's  
just that you knew a thief when  
you saw one.”  

Bungling liberals are running  
our cities. The Boston Globe has  
the guise of liberalism that creates  
a plantation mentality syndrome.  
If the masks were ripped off,  
there would be an unbelievable  
outburst. For instance, during  
the racist violence last year,  
when a white child was hurt, it  
made the front page. However,  
a Black child being hurt is not  
even reported. Or when a gay  
man was raped and murdered it  
was not a priority. The  
newspaper's liberalism covers up  
the most outrageous violence in  
the city.  

I earn $12,500 per year as a  
State Representative. That's  
more money than I've ever  
earned in my whole life. But for a  
Representative with a few kids,  
two cars, and Friday night  
dinners out, it's hard to make it  
on that amount. The School  
Board in Boston receives no pay,  
but it is an important political  
position and requires long work.  
Board members should be paid.  
People will steal if they're not  
paid.  

Yes, Elaine Nobel is a politician  
and she's trying to sell you  
something. That comes across  
right away. What she's selling  
is political survival. She's a warm-  
hearted, down-to-earth righteous  
woman who loves people and  
works hard for them. She'll  
hand you no illusions; she'll  
make you no promises. She'll tell  
you to tend to your own back  
yard first, pay attention to who  
your friends are, respect the dif-  
ferences among people, and  
lend a hand when it's time to get  
the chores done. She'll tell you  
to stop your arm-chair theor-  
izing, moralizing, agonizing, and  
recognize that, like mama said,  
people look out for themselves.  
And that’s not bad, because  
people will look out for their  
friends too, and some of us are  
natural allies. She'll share what  
she knows with whoever wants  
to learn. She says time's a-wast-  
ing and they're already getting  
started in Boston. Why aren't we  
doing it here?
