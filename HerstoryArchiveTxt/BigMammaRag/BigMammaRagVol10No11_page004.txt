What's A Nice Secretary Like You

When I was in the ninth
grade at Oakland High School,
my father and mother said to
me, "Nellie, we can't send
you to college. We have too
many children to feed. Switch

race, sex, and class in the
movements toward radical
social change. These organ-
izations, dedicated to
achieving the full equality
of women and all oppressed
groups, stress the leader-
ship roles of women of color,
lesbians, and workers. We
believe that now more than
ever it is imperative that
feminists militantly fight
the right wing by standing
in solidarity with our nat:

Asian American feminist

to a secretarial course, and
you can go to work right
after high school graduation."
Timid as I was then, I obeyed
but not without resentment,
bitterness, and anger. This
was in 1948 when there was
no women's movement to sup-
port me, and little encour-
agement from anyone in my
family or community to
explore ways to send me to
college. When I told my
high school counselor that

I was switching to a commer-
cial course, he, too, offer-
ed no solutions or alterna-
tives.

And so I was tracked into
my work life as a secretary.
Before I graduated from Oak-
land High, they hired me to
work as a recorder in the
principal's office with full
responsibility of handling
students' scholastic records
and transmitting them to un-
iversities and colleges.

I've now worked as a
clerical and secretary for
thirty-one years. I stayed
at Oakland High for seven
years, then worked at United

Grocers for five years as
secretary to the advertising
manager, and finally to Beth-
lehem Steel Corporation where
I've been employed in various
secretarial capacities for
the last eighteen years. And
I am only 47 years old.

When Chela Sandoval asked
me to speak on this panel,
“Race, Sex and Class Inter-
sections: Visions from US
Women of Color," I decided
to participate because I am
a secretary who is also a
published poet, writer and
socialist feminist activist.
My political affiliations
are with Radical Women and
the Freedom Socialist Party,
two national socialist fem-
inist organizations which
interlock the struggles of

ural allies in the labor,
gay and lesbian, and people
of color movements.

So, the question is:
“What's a nice secretary like
you doing in politics like
this?"

The first answer to that
question is: Every secretary
should be doing something in
politics like this -- poli-
tics which encompass our
race, sex, sexuality, and
class for it is our lives as
women workers that hold up
this society and the entire
world.

My political education was
born from being a worker
and an Asian woman. Though I
attended San Francisco
State University for several
years at night while I worked
full time, that education has
been interrupted because I
have become increasingly
active in the movement toward
radical social change. But
actually my education hasn't
stopped. It's leaped and
sailed from a narrow, per-
sonal perspective to an
international one: that my
life as one Asian woman
worker is not solely to be
resolved through personal
solutions but through col-
lective action with all other
women as a group.

When I was looking around
to find a movement that would
address all my needs and all
the issues together, I found
that nationalism did not of-
fer any solutions because it
is based on racial separa-
tism. Nationalists do not
take into account sex and
class lines.

The reformist or liberal
feminist movement did not
address all my needs either
because it adapts itself to
the capitalist system which
uses racism and sexism and
class exploitation to sur-

vive. A boss is a boss
whether it's a he or a she,
and workers continue to be
oppressed, particularly wo-
men of color and lesbians,
in the exploitation of work-
ers for profits.

The lesbian separatist
movement contained no ans-
wers either because it blames
men for women's oppression
without regard for class and
race implications.

I cannot divide my Asian-
ness from my sex. I am an
Asian American feminist
woman.

And when I found the move-
ment which addressed all my
needs and the issues together,
it was socialist feminism
which interlocks race, sex,
and class. And as I read,
studied, and became more
activist as a feminist, I
realized that socialism is
not separate from feminism,
and that feminism is not
separate from socialism.

Both are equally important
and presented the philosophy
by which I could begin to
make social change in con-
cert with others. This dev-
elopment demands nothing
less than full-fledged com-
mitment to changing a soci-
ety which has kept us down.

Another answer to "What's
a nice secretary like you
doing in politics like this
is: Why wouldn't a nice sec-
retary like me be involved
in politics like this?

My being a clerical
worker, as thousands and
thousands of women are, de-
mands that we, as an oppres-
sed class, involve our-
selves in politics because
if we aren't, nothing's
really going to change. Work,
art, and politics are inex-
tricable from one another.

I can neither separate my
sex from my race, or my
work from my art.

I actually worked in
academia a few years ago
at Mills College in Oakland.
I was asked to teach a poet-

*ry writing workshop in
Ethnic Studies. Then I was
asked to be interviewed by
the dean of the faculty be-
cause he found out that I
had no college degree. I
remember that day well. I
had to take time off my
job to be interviewed. As
soon as I walked into the
dean's office, his secre-
tary asked: "Do you have a

degree?" Evidently she had
been reviewing my resume. I
answered, "No, but I've
written a book of poetry."
She went back to her typing
while I waited patiently to
be interviewed. I was hired
and taught that workshop
successfully, but what
remains uppermost in my mind
is: Why is it, when an Asian
woman writer does not have
a college degree behind her
name, it is assumed that she
is unqualified to teach in
an institution of higher
learning?

Of course, I never had a
chance to discuss this with
the dean's secretary or
with the dean for that mat-
ter. What's important is
that I had the self-confid-
ence to put my experience
out in the world as a work-
ing-class Asian woman writer
and that my book and other
published and unpublished
writings embodied my qual-
ifications to teach.

I've been a socialist fem-
inist for many years. I've
learned about racism and
sexism in the workplace.
I've learned about sexism
in the classroom. And I've
learned about racism, sexism,
and class exploitation on
the streets.

When I was a teenager, I
rode the train to San Fran-
cisco to see a dermatolo-
gist for my eczema. In the
mid-1940s there was a
world war in progress, and
as naive as I was then, US
sailors found me an easy
target for their sexist
and racist remarks. They
usually spoke to me in Jap-
anese -- it seems we all
look alike -- and, of course,
because of their experience
overseas in Asia, they as-
sumed that I was a prosti-
tute.

In one of my jobs at Beth-
lehem Steel, I got demoted
from secretary to the
treasurer to secretary in
general services because I
was getting married and
since I was planning to have
a baby... it seems that
my boss did not want to
have to change secretaries
when I actually might get
pregnant, so why didn't I
just leave his department
sooner?

In another situation my
white male boss wanted me
to listen in on an Asian

businessman's telephone
conversation in Korean even
though I protested that I
spoke Cantonese!

And while I was vacation-
ing in Mexico City a few
years ago, a white woman
whom I met was surprised to
learn that I was Chinese be-
cause I spoke English so
well!

As these many experiences
piled up, I began to ques-
tion deeply and seriously
the racial, sexual, and
class implications of Ameri-
can society.

So, for me, an Asian work-
ing-class woman writer and
secretary, I am here in
politics like this because
there's nowhere else to
be! A few years ago my be-
ing a secretary actually
caged me. I had bought what
the ruling class sold me:

I had to be blue-eyed and
blonde to be a woman. I had
to be "feminine," soft-
spoken, passive, exotic, and
reserved to be Asian. I had
to hold a supposedly subser-
vient job as a secretary,

an "office wife," if you
will, to support myself
until I got married.

So, today I am interested

in making waves. No woman who

has gone through the kinds
of experiences I've men-

tioned, and there are thou-
sands upon thousands of us,
can remain in her place. The
actual experiences, coupled

with the mind searching for
truth and beauty, can only
lead toward a socialist
feminist revolution in the
US and internationally.

I know of many women work-
ers, women of color, and
lesbians who have inspired
me to be in the midst of
politics like this: two are
Clara Fraser and Merle Woo.

Clara Fraser worked as an
education coordinator at
Seattle City Light to in-
volve more women and racial
minorities in the electrical
trades. She did a great job.
And when she walked out with
other workers on strike to
protest enormous harsh work-
ing conditions, she was
fired. Why? Not because she
wasn't competent, efficient,
intelligent, or didn't do
her job well. She was fired
because she was outspoken

about management's policies
and because she openly stood
up for her socialist fem-
inist politics. Since then, in
1975, she's been fighting a
historic political ideology
and sex discrimination suit
against Seattle City Light.
What's important about this
case is Clara is fighting for
all of us: for free speech
on the job, for the right
not to be censored, and for
the right of workers not to
be harassed by management
for holding different, rad-
ical political views.

Merle Woo is another free-
dom fighter currently in-
volved in her employment
case at the University of
California at Berkeley.
Merle was hired four years
ago as a lecturer in Asian
American Studies and was
promised security of employ-
ment. She received her term-
ination notice this year and
initially was denied due
process to appeal her
termination. She has educat-
ed, prodded and inspired
hundreds of young Asian
American women and men and
others in her classes. So

why is she being fired?
Merle's being fired because
she is a socialist feminist,
a lesbian, and because she's
been openly critical of
Ethnic Studies policy, par-
ticularly in their push for
Ethnic Studies to go into
the College of Letters and
Science. Merle has also
organized with students and
tutors to protest Asian
American Studies' dismant-
ling of the inclusion of
students in the decision-
making process.

I would cite many more
examples of the courage and
commitment of many women of
color, lesbians and workers
whose militancy has held up
our movement toward eradi-
cating sexism, racism,
heterosexism, and class
exploitation, but time
doesn't allow it. However,
our organizing for our rights
must be emphasized for it is
in collective mass action
that we will gain the equal-
ity that we want, deserve,
and will have.

So, what are some of the
politics that this nice
secretary is involved in?

To list a few, there's
conferences and forums
such as Racism in the Wo-
men's Movement, Working Wo-
men: We Can Shut This Country
Down, an all-day conference
held on International Women's
Day two years ago, the Work
and Power Conference held
early this year at Sonoma
State University, the Bay
Area Solidarity Support
Campaign of the Polish work-
ers' fight, Unbound Feet
Three, an Asian American
feminist writing/performing
group, and their interac-
tion of art, politics and
community activism. I've
spoken, organized, demon-
strated, typed, filed,
licked stamps, made tele-
phone calls, done publicity
releases, and the many other
day-to-day things that form
the backbone of movement
work. Yet, and I've lost
sleep because there's al-
ways work to be done and
time is short. However, I'd
have it no other way --
not for personal success,
bouquets of roses, or stay-
in-your-place fascinating
womanhood.

I'm making up for my past:
for allowing myself to be
