Crock of What? — Before stepping down as Prime Minister, Golda Meir  
received a farewell gift of kitchen crockery at her last cabinet meeting.

A Complaint That Got Somewhere — A spokeswoman for the Van-  
couver Status of Women in Vancouver, British Columbia recently wrote  
the following letter to the Vancouver Calendar Magazine: ‘Dear Sir:  
May I draw attention to the ad in your March issue showing two  
hardhats in a manhole gawking up at a naked pair of legs with the cap-  
tion “The Longer the Better”... The female sexist equivalent to this ad  
would be a picture of a group of secretaries staring at the boss’ crotch  
with the same title... On behalf of the 1400 affiliated members of the  
Vancouver Status of Women, I would appreciate a prompt reply.” She  
received this letter from the marketing director of the B & H Cigarette Co.  
in response: “Based on your letter and several others, we are withdraw-  
ing the ‘Longer the Better’ ad from the campaign mix as quickly as  
possible, and are taking down the outdoor ads from across  
Southwestern Ontario. We apologize for personally offending you with  
this ad and hope that since we are trying to be socially conscious that  
you will support us...” The Media Action Group has been collecting ex-  
amples of sex role stereotyping in advertising and then writing both the  
particular media and the advertiser. (Western Canadian Women’s  
News Service)  

Those Grating Female Voices! — Claiming that it is the ‘consensus of  
broadcasters’ that women’s voices are unacceptable, General  
Manager Fred Gage of WNOR-FM in Norfolk, VA blamed the station's  
recent rating declines on the part-time women DJs. He then moved  
them to secretarial work. Said Fred, “Females and males would rather  
hear a male voice on the radio... A woman’s destiny is tied to a man.”  
He did, however, make one exception: “The young lady doing deodorant  
commercials is doing a nice job.” (Broadcasting, 9/16/74)  

Lesbian Activist Victorious in Boston — Elain Noble, an upfront Les-  
bian activist in Boston, has won the state senate seat in that city’s 6th  
district. She is the first open Lesbian in this country to hold such an of-  
fice.  

Mary, Mary Quite Contrary HOW Does Your Consciousness Grow?  
— Happiness of Womanhood (HOW) is a women’s group whose two  
main goals, according to Hilma Skinner in Boulder, are to fight the efforts  
of NOW to change sex role stereotyping in textbooks and to oppose the  
Equal Rights Amendment. HOW, which claims 100 members in  
Colorado, is an outgrowth of “Fascinating Womanhood,” — the  
philosophy of “femininity” which encourages women to please men.  
Well, folks, you win some, you lose some, and some you want to rotate  
and revolve (and not around themselves either).  

Isn't Everyone? — “A high school ‘chum’, — through diligent snooping,  
found out I am a Lesbian. Knowing her social responsibility she went  
straight (no pun intended) to my mother. ‘Your daughter is a Lesbian.’  
Long pause. Mother, a look of shocked disbelief on her face, replied:  
‘Isn't everyone?’” (Lavender Woman, Oct. '74)

Plans for a Future NOW  

Big Mama Rag Vol. 3, No. 6  

Karen de Crow |  

Linda Fowler  

“I consider NOW a  
revolutionary, not a reformist  
group. Otherwise I wouldn't be  
working with it. I don’t think  
women can get equality in our  
current system,” stated Karen  
de Crow, national president of  
the National Organization for  
Women.  

Ms. de Crow was in Denver  
November 8-10, to attend the  
national board meeting of NOW.  
Elected to office in May of ‘74,  
she ran the first grassroots cam-  
paign in NOW history. She was  
victorious in spite of heavy ac-  
tivity against her.  

Since her election, Ms.  
de Crow has been working on the  
internal organization of NOW as  
well as with NOW’s efforts to  
affect change in the legal and  
social status quo in the country.  

De Crow has initialed an affir-  
mative action committee within  
the board of NOW. Its purpose is  
to deal with questions of minori-  
ty representation and with op-  
pressive aspects of the group's  
structure. Many Lesbian and  
minority members of NOW feel  
they have had to face the same  
oppression within NOW that  
they face in the outside world. In  
fact, it was for this reason the  
Minority Task Force of the  
Denver chapter withdrew from  
the general membership last  
March.  
Ms. de Crow feels these  

grievances must be heard. “We  
cannot demand less of ourselves  
than we demand of the outside  
world. I have set up a civil liber-  
ties committee within NOW  
where people who feel that their  
rights are being trampled on by  
what's going on bureaucratically  
in NOW have some resource  
other than suit in federal court,”  
she said. Ms. de Crow hopes  
such efforts will, in the future,  
solve problems of minority  
representation within NOW.  

Passing the ERA  

On a national level, one of  
NOW’s primary concerns has  
been with passage of the ERA.  
While researching her book Sex-  
ist Justice, Ms. de Crow found  
thousands of laws throughout  
the country that discriminate  
against women. “This amend-  
ment,” she claims, “would wipe  
them out. The ERA would make  
it possible for women to get legal  
rights without individual court  
suits.”  

Pat Palmer/  

This is perhaps a somewhat  
questionable assumption. The  
civil rights amendment, for ex-  
ample, similar in structure and  
purpose, did not eliminate dis-  
crimination for minorities or the  
need for personal legal suits to  
attain enforcement of the law.  

It is also an amendment that  
would make it illegal for women  
to have public organizations  
which are exclusively for  
women. Ms. de Crow does not  
see this as a problem. She  
stated, “I am 100% opposed to  
sexism. I don't believe the Girl  
Scouts should be for girls and  
the Boy Scouts for boys. And I  
don't think women’s centers  
should be exclusively for  
women. We have suffered so  
much because men have kept us  

“One of my goals,” she stated,  
“has been to get more men into  
NOW. I don’t think we can have a  
behavioral revolution for one  
sex.”  

Still speaking of the ERA, she  
stated, “The main reason I want  
to see passage of the ERA is that  
I'd like to stop spending our  
resources on it. Enormous time  
and money resources of the  
women’s movement and of  
NOW are being spent on  
passage of the ERA. I want to get  
it over with.”  

Once the ERA battle has been  
won, Ms. de Crow would like to  
see NOW begin a re-  

examination of work and its  
meaning in society: its place in  
life, how people work, and the  
flexibility of  

hours. She also  

out that, I feel, a normal reaction  
is to say let's do the same thing  
to them.’ But I don’t feel that this  
reaction in the long run is a  
healthy one.”  

In response to the question of  
how we would then deal with  
the problem of male psy-  
chological dominance she  
answered, “Basically what the  
women’s movement is doing is  
trying to help women live in the  
world as full humans. We have  
to help women build their con-  
fidence in dealing with men.”  

She feels we must stop worry-  
ing about male approval or  
female approval. We must do  
what we feel we must. Ms.  
de Crow is not, she says, in-  
terested in being acceptable.

would like to help upgrade the  
status of people who work in the  
home, first through social  
security payments, then through  
the establishment of salaries.  
“Being economically depen-  
dent,” said de Crow, “is scary.  
We can't function with total in-  
tegrity unless we are truly in-  
dependent.”  

Until then Ms. de Crow will  
continue to turn the heads of  
high government officials. “I  
think I've changed the language  
of Gerald Ford,” she said, “who  
now says ‘he or she’. He says it  
all the time.”  

The revolution goes around.  

Assertiveness Training Group  

Lori Davis Windle  

An Assertiveness Training  
Group is being initiated in  
Denver by Pat Palmer, Esalen In-  
stitute trainee. Groups are open  
for 12 to 15 people, and should  
be organized and ready to begin  
the first week in January.  

According to Ms. Palmer,  
Assertiveness Training “allows  
you to explore ways of relating to  
other people in an honest, direct,  
and simple manner. Women and  
men who are tired of game-  
playing, manipulative behavior,  
can learn to be straight. Any per-  
son can learn to be able to make  
their needs known without the  
pain usually associated with  
asking someone for something.”  

She states women particularly  
are prone to feeling apologetic  
simply for being, and are treated  
more like children than the  
worthwhile adults they are.  
Communicating effectively can  
be a problem; it is important for a  
person to realize their growth  

potentials and summon the  
power from within them to foster  
that individual growth.  

Taking a mixed approach, in-  
cluding gestalt, exercises, role  
playing and use of video tape,  
the group contracts with each  
person to help achieve an asser-  
tiveness goal of that individual.  
The group offers a cooperative  
atmosphere where “each per-  
son has an opportunity to prac-  
tice being the kind of assertive  
person they would like to  
become.”  

Ms. Palmer received her un-  
dergraduate degree at Skidmore  
College, her Masters degree in  
Psychology, Counseling, and  
Guidance at the University of  
Northern Colorado. One time  
Associate Director of the Smith  
College Vocational Office (she  
was Gloria Steinem’s vocational  
counselor), she is presently a  
Research Fellow at the  
Humanistic Psychology Institute  
of the Association of Humanistic  
Psychologists, and is studying  

for a PhD in Counseling Psy-  
chology. She hopes to specialize  
in working with creative people.  
She is currently active on the  
Rape Task Force of NOW and is  
available for lectures.  

She says, “I feel my specialty  
as a counselor is in helping peo-  
ple get in touch with their own  
healthiness. Everyone has it. In  
Assertiveness Training, I work  
mainly to help a person create a  
positive self-image. After that,  
most people can ask for what  
they need and even feel they  
deserve it. Humanists accen-  
tuate the positive. Life is full of  
joy, so enjoy!”  

Groups will meet one night a  
week, for three hours, over a  
period of two months. Costs run  
$60.00 per month, but can be  
negotiated to fit particular  
needs. Because of video tape  
availability, Sebastian House  
might be used for meetings. Pat  
Palmer may be contacted for  
further information at 322-  
9385.
