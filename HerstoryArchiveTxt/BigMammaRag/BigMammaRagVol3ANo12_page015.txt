The New Woman’s Survival Sourcebook gives an overall perspective on the women’s movement, a perspective that is usually found lacking in catalog accounts of who we are and what we do as women today. It is invaluable organizational material for all feminists.  

Born Innocent  

From Page 4  

Eight NBC affiliates in cities across the country, including Minneapolis, Kansas City and Detroit, did finally drop the film. But in Boston gay groups were told by the NBC affiliate that regardless of what they thought of the film's re-editing, it would be run and without additional cuts.  

Regular feature stories. Publication passed the neighborhood councils; later this year it will go to the Aldermen who will eventually make their recommendations to HUD. The proposal, because of the combined work of Minneapolis area feminists, has a good chance to succeed.  

The effort to buy the Minneapolis house is a reform that alters the conditions of life in its particular area. It has reformed the way things are there: It is a change which counts and for that reason it is a victory for all of us.  

Women’s House.  

From Page 3
