daughter. The issue of boy
children is in itself a sep-
arate article also. A tribal,
rather than “community” att-
itude must be developed. A
tribe is a unit in which ev-
ery woman is related regard-
less of blood ties. This re-
lation, this bond, entitles
each woman to the protection
of the tribe: i.e., food,
clothing, shelter, spiritual
nourishment, communal child
rearing, etc. A community is
a series of isolated individ-
uals who come together for
any number of reasons i.e.,
talking on the street, traf-
fic jam, a bar, a disco, but
who have no common respon-
sibility for each other. Wh-
ite feminists are still belie-
vers in the scarcity myth,
scarcity of love, of food,
of everything such that their
energies get directed into
hoarding instead of circul-

-Stop thinking that the
concept of “equal" means the
same. It does not. When you
meet a woman of color she is
not the same. She is entirely
different and has another
way of being to be embraced.
She must be honored because
of that difference.

-Start acting and living
out what your foremothers ha-
ve written and suffered for:
i.e., Virginia Woolf, Charlo-
tte Perkins Gilman, Elizabeth
Gould Davis, Adrienne Rich,
Mary Daly, Sally Gearhart,
to name a few.

And what can feminists of
color begin to do? Some new
ways of behavior to consider
are:

-Stop making excuses for
men of color; that is, stop
saying, "Oh, he acts like th-
at because he's been (is)
oppressed." Bullshit!! Af-

How many women are in the

Social Security

ceding the onset of disabili-
ty, the worker will need 30
quarters. This is expected to
disqualify enough people to
save $10 billion. Women, more
likely to work part-time, more
likely to be out of the labor
force at times, will be har-
dest hit by this stricter "in-
surance" rule. It's al-
ready very hard to collect
Social Security Disability.
About 2/3 of those applying
are ‘turned down. While there
are probably some people app-
lying who aren't really "dis-
abled" as the ordinary person
would use the word (they're
merely unemployed and despe-
rate), my personal opinion is
that many people I see turned
down cannot work, and the de-

finition is too strict already.

About half of those who pursue

the book center open been
going? We don't view the
bookcenter as an isolated fe-
minist project; too many
bookcenters, feminist papers
are closing or turning to ca-
pitalist ways in order to
survive. We feel that Woman
To Woman has to give the com-
munity and the movement more
information. We recognize
that in times of reorganizing
much energy is spent, but com-
mitment to inform is just as
vital as a commitment to
keep the center open.

their claims win at the Hear-
ing level, their first chance
actually to talk face-to-face
with the person who has the
power to make the decision.
In part, it is this ability
of Administrative Law Judges
to use common sense in apply-
ing "vocational, educational,
and age" factors that account
for the high level of déci-
sions overturned at this level.
In part, this Administration
proposal is aimed at ending
that high Hearing allowance
rate.

Since the retired population
are well-known to vote and
organize politically in high
numbers, the Administration
carefully limited their at-
tack on those already on the
rolls.

"The sole impact today's pro-

ter traveling in Africa, I
became aware that black men
act the way they do, bruta-
lize women the way they do,
because they are men not be-
cause they are oppressed.
(Female genital mutilation
occurs in 26 of 36 African
countries, today-now-right
now - 20th century.)

-Start seeing your female
being as primal.

-Stop putting energies into
men of color and all of their
revolutions and social change
programs. For example, Black
women worked in all black
civil rights organizations.
Now, these organizations do
not even bother to come out
in support of reformist laws
for women's rights which wo-
uld give women minimal cont-
rol of their lives and bodies.
The same holds true for the
millions of Chicana women,
Asian women and South Amer-
ican women who gave (and st-
ill give) their energies to
male-led social revolutions.
Their reward is still oppr-
ession in their personal li-
ves - which is LIFE.

We must all work to separ-

ate patriarchal behaviors
from ourselves. But at the
same time we cannot, must
not, make a divisive issue
out of a layer of the patri-
archy (racism, in this case).
It diverts our energies. For
a feminist to imply or acc-
use a sister feminist of ra-
cism (whether the accusation
is made through a panel on
racism and feminism or whet-
her it's done through crit-
icism of a sister feminist's
book) is to continue to par-
ticipate fully in a patria-
rchal process and ritual.
Let's not search for racism
in feminism. Racism we can
find everywhere the patri-
archs are. Racism is a red
herring because it divides
and saps our energies. We
need to drop racism which
means let go of the patri-
archy. We need to develop a
culture where we as females
respect ourselves and each
other, where the values of:
loving and nurturing are tau-
ght and learned. Where we are
not injured. It is good to
remember that men are killing
the earth and that we are
the earth.

posals would have on the
36,000,000 beneficiaries now
on the rolls would be a
three-month delay in the auto-
matic cost-of-living increase
scheduled for July 1982. This
change would end the anomaly
of Social Security, the lar-
gest single Federal program,
still operating on the
pre-1976 fiscal calendar."

If you were collecting $300

a month and counting the days
till the 11% increase sche-
duled for July 3, would you
rather live with that "ano-
maly" and get your raise in
July, or would you rather
have the same fiscal year
Congress uses, and wait till
October for your raise? This
concern with the "anomaly"

of the July Increase is an-
other of those word-games
Schweiker plays so insulting-
ly. The reason for the sche-

duled delay is to save $6.3
billion (1982-86), pure and
simple.

Probably some of these pro-
posals won't actually go
through. Depending on which
proposals arouse the most
public outcry, Congress will
cut and paste some Social Se-
curity cutbacks together. I
can only encourage everyone
to make as much outcry as
possible against any and all
cuts in Social Security. We
will all be old someday, if
we're lucky, and the willing-
ness of the working-age
people to support the old,
the sick, and the poor is a
measure of civilized human
society. We should resist the
temptation to be for certain
cuts and against those we
think will affect us person-
ally. That's how they weaken
us.
