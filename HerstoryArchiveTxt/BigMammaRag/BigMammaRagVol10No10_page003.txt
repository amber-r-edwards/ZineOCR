Lay Midwife Restrained In Colo. Springs

Terra Palmarini

Karen Parker-Cheyney, an ex-
perienced lay midwife in the
Colorado Springs area, has
been permanently restrained
from the “practice of medicine
without a license" by the Col-
orado State Attorney General
and the State Board of Medical

Examiners (BME). Parker-Cheyney
had been serving the needs of
pregnant women wishing to have
an attended home birth for
several years, as well as
teaching childbirth classes
and midwifery students.

The restraining order was
the result of an incident
earlier this year. Parker-
Cheyney was called to help a
laboring woman in a rural area
who had planned to have a
chiropractor attend the birth.

At the time of labor the
chiropractor said he was busy
with patients and wouldn't be
there until 12:30 pm (14 hours
after the baby was, in fact,
born). Since Parker-Cheyney
had instructed the woman and
her partner in childbirth
classes, they called her for
help. The baby was coming four
weeks before the estimated due
date, so when she arrived, she
phoned an ambulance to bring
an incubator, in anticipation
of possible premature with
temperature regulation and
respiratory problems. The
birth happened soon after. The
baby needed no special care
and was fine. The mother,
however, began to bleed ten
minutes post delivery, as her
placenta wouldn't completely
separate from the uterus.
Parker-Cheyney gave her an
injection of pitocin (controlled
drug that can only be
dispersed by medical doctors),
a drug commonly used to control
post-partum hemorrhage, in the
presence of the ambulance EMT,
who had also arrived. The
mother had lost 5% of her
blood but was no longer actively
bleeding by the time the
ambulance took her away. At
the hospital the placenta was
manually removed, as it was
still partially attached.

Two days after the birth,
the local sheriff came to
charge Parker-Cheyney with
practicing medicine without a
license and reckless endanger-
ment. Presently, lay midwifery
is defined as illegal in Colo-
rado because delivering babies
is defined as a medical procedure.

Parker-Cheyney's prosecution
was being handled by a sympa-
thetic district attorney, who
informed Parker-Cheyney to re-
move all her textbooks, films,
supplies, and teaching hand-
outs and aids. She told her
they could be destroyed as a
“public nuisance." No formal
legal charges were pressed,
however, her children asked
her when "they" were coming
to get her, and her 7-year-
old cried at night thinking
about it.

Then, in July, Parker-
Cheyney was served a sub-
poena by the BME and ordered
to appear with all her equip-
ment, charts, lists of mid-
wives, birthing couples
planning home birth, former
students, and doctors who
had helped her practice
midwifery. Due to a legal
technicality Parker-Cheyney
and her lawyers were able to
have the subpoena thrown out.
The BME, which is made up of
appointed medical doctors
and osteopaths and regulates
the practice of medicine in
Colorado, chose not to re-
issue the subpoena. Instead
they had the State Attorney
General serve Parker-Cheyney
with a temporary restraining
order to not "practice medi-
cine." Although she had a
right to a hearing, the only
argument she had was a con-
stitutional one—that mid-
wifery is not the practice of
medicine. However, since she
had given an injection, the
chances of a favorable ruling
were slim. She also could not
finance the over $5,000 such
a battle would probably cost.
Thus she decided not to have
a hearing and accepted a per-
manent restraining order from
“practicing medicine without
a license." Her lawyers were
able to make a stipulation to
the restraining order that
all members of the BME and
the Attorney General must
read her written statement,
In Support of Non-nurse Mid-
wives.

On September 16th the BME
was to meet in full and one
of their main topics of dis-
cussion would be the growing
concern about non-nurse, lay
midwives.

Parker-Cheyney is presently
working with others to draft
a bill to legalize non-nurse
midwifery through a certifi-
cation process, and trying to
find a job. A consumer sup-
port group Birthwise is
helping her defray legal
costs as well as supporting
the legalization efforts.
