Big Mama Rag Vol. 3, No. 2

The first day of National  
Women’s Week and the day  
before the anniversary of  
Women’s Suffrage will be the  
day of celebration for Denver  
area women - Sunday, August  
25, all day at the Esplanade in  
front of East High, Colfax and  
Detroit.

Why First Annual? So there  
can be a second, third and  
fourth annual! A coalition of  
Denver women from various  
groups began meetings on  
July 4, and agreed to create a  
Celebration / Communication  
Exchange Festival Day where  
women could see the variety  
and depth of their own  
community in a display of  
women’s services and organi-  
zations - politics, arts and  
crafts, performers, crazy car-  
nival booths, womanfood and  
anomalous celebrants.

Exhibitors fees are $2. for  
individual artists and crafts-  
women or others providing  
their own exhibit table, $10.  
for booth accommodations  
and groups and 10% of sales  
from all participants. If there  
is any money from the festival  
not needed to cover expenses,  
they will be held by the  
coalition representing the  
Denver Women’s Community.  
Plans are being made to  
create a type of “Women's  
Fund” to meet the needs of  
women’s organizations so that  
they might grow.

Fee checks for the Women’s  
Festival are payable to Rocky  
Mountain Women in the Arts,  
c/o Nancy O’Brien, 1074  
Dartmouth, 761-0082.

Thirty-six women’s groups  
ranging from NOW to the  
Abortion Referral Service to  
B.S. Sugar have been con-  
tacted to participate in the  
festival. Coalition meetings

Anne-Marie Sandquist was  
interviewed at one of her  
games by two young reporters  
from BMR, Sally Morgenstern  
and Jessica Fowler: BMR:  
Why did you start to play on a  
boy’s baseball team?  
Anne-Marie: There weren’t  
any girls’ teams and I wanted  
to play baseball.

BMR: How does your coach  
feel about your playing on the  
team?  
Anne-Marie: He was the one  
who let me play in the first  
place.

BMR: What did you want to  
do when you grow up?  
Anne-Marie: Play baseball.

BMR: How do the other  
players on the team feel about  
your playing?  
Anne-Marie: They all like me  
and don’t care if I play except  
for one guy and I can’t tell you  
his name.

BMR: Do your friends and  
neighbors care if you play on a  
boys’ team?  
Anne-Marie: My friends like  
me to play. Some of my  
neighbors don’t think I should  
be playing baseball.

Anne-Marie Goes to Bat

Anne-Marie Sandquist, a 9  
year old girl, is playing  
baseball for the Catholic  
Youth Recreation Association  
(CYRA), but it took a court  
order to do so. The CYRA,  
headed by Thomas E. Wilson  
of 850 Milwaukee St., took  
Anne-Marie off the Most  
Precious Blood Tigers team  
and forfeited two games in  
which she had played. They  
also fired coach Michael  
Ousley, who allowed her to  
play.

Following this, the Sand-  
quists went to court. Jean  
Dubossky, an American Civil  
Liberties Union member, filed  
a suit stating that Anne-Marie  
be allowed to play or the  
CYRA be unable to use  
city-owned parks. Denver Dis-  
trict Court Judge Robert  
Kingsley issued a 10-day  
restraining order on June 19  
which let her play until the  
case went to court.

The restraining order turned  
into a preliminary injunction  
on July 3, when the CYRA  
dropped its case. Anne-Marie is  
now able to participate until  
the end of this season and  
theoretically next season al-  
so. However, any other young  
woman wishing to play in the  
CYRA will also have to go  
through the court procedure.

The Sandquists are not  
satisfied with this, and an  
amended complaint has been  
filed, which will probably be  
heard this winter. While not a  
class action suit, the attor-  
neys hope for a declaratory  
statement that will affect  
more young women than  
Anne-Marie.

The real issue is not  
Anne-Marie Sandquist, but  
whether or not young women  
belong in organized team  
sports such as baseball.

One commonly repeated  
reason to keep young women  
out of team sports is that they  
are not as strong as boys.  
However, studies show that  
both sexes are equal in  
strength. Further, according  
to a Physician and Sports  
article, “Sex and the Little  
League,” women are in fact  
more advanced than men in  
bone development from ages  
8-12, the years of “little  
league” sports. There is also  
no evidence that women are  
more prone to bone breaks  
than men.

Another excuse is that  
traumatic impact, i.e. getting  
hit by a baseball, leads to  
breast cancer. Physician and  
Sports states that there is not  
any evidence to support this  
theory.

It is important that the  
sexes begin competing on an  
equal basis at an early age. It  
seems the only reason young  
women are kept out of team  
sports is male chauvinism on  
the part of directors, coaches,  
and parents.
