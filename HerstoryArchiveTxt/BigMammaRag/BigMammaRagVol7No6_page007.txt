A Case of Police Brutality  
Indian Woman Sues Over  

The case of Jo Ann Yellow Bird will  
be tried before a jury in North  
Platte, Nebraska in July, 1979. Jo  
Ann Yellow Bird, an Oglala Lakota  
woman from Pine Ridge Indian Reserva-  
tion, was seven months pregnant when  
she was kicked in the stomach by a  
Gordon, Nebraska police officer on  
September 15th, 1976. Two weeks  
later her baby, Zintkalazi, was born  
dead. She filed suit against the of-  
ficer who kicked her and the author-  
ities who refused her medical treat-  
ment.  

The incident occurred in Gordon, a  
small town in Northern Nebraska near  
the South Dakota border. The bartender  
of a local tavern was harassing a  
group of Indians, which included Jo  
Ann Yellow Bird and her husband Bob,  
both activists in the American Indian  
Movement. As they left the tavern,  
the police arrived and began arrest-  
ing them in a violent way. When Jo  
Ann Yellow Bird yelled for officers  
to stop beating her husband, police-  
man Robert Barnes turned and kicked  
her in the stomach even though she  
was obviously pregnant. She was then  
thrown into the back of a police car  
and taken to county jail.  

The sheriff's deputies ignored Jo  
Ann's pleas for medical help. After  
several hours, they finally took her  
to Gordon Memorial Hospital where the  
doctor, after hearing a questionable  
fetal heartbeat, refused to admit her  
because she is an Indian. Then she  
was driven to the Pine Ridge Indian  
Hospital, South Dakota, over many  
miles of bad road. The doctor who  
finally examined her found that the  
baby's heartbeat was silent.  

Two weeks later, Jo Ann delivered  
a stillborn baby girl named Zintkal-  
azi. In an official autopsy, an FBI  
pathologist found that the seven  
month fetus had been dead since ap-  
proximately the day of the policeman's  
kick and that the baby had been  
healthy up to that time with no ab-  
normalities.  

Why a Civil Suit?  

Jo Ann Yellow Bird's case repre-  
sents an effort to stop police bru-  
tality. The trial will force police  
in Nebraska, where many Indian people  
live, to be accountable for their  
actions.  

The case will bring public atten-  
tion to attacks on Native American  
families. Publicity about the trial  
will bring more awareness of the op-  
pression of Indian people. Many indi-  
viduals and organizations are working  
together on the case in support of  
Indian people's right to raise their  
families and control their land.  

The case will show support for and  
strengthen the Indian movement. Indi-  
an people are one of the most legally  
under-represented groups in our soci-  
ety. Recently courtrooms have been  
one of the major battlegrounds for  
Indian rights. Justice will not hap-  
pen without widespread support.  

The case will prove that Jo Ann as  
a woman has the right to choose to  
build a strong family. Jo Ann shows  
that women are strong leaders in the  
Indian resistance. She is speaking  
out against oppression and she is  
demanding the right of Indian women  
to build a strong Indian nation.  

The Larger Struggle  

Jo Ann Yellow Bird's case is not  
unique; her case represents for all  
Indian people a struggle for survival.  

Recently in Geneva, Switzerland,  
the International Indian Treaty Coun-  
cil presented extensive documentation  
on "Genocide Against Indian People"  
to the Human Rights Commission of the  
United Nations. Some relevant statist-  

ics from that documentation are:  

- 24% of all Indian women have been  
involuntarily sterilized.  

- 25 - 35% of all Indian children on  
reservations are forcibly separated  
from their families and put into  
foster homes, BIA schools, and a-  
dopted by non-Indian families.  

- 25 - 35% of all Indian children are  
forcibly separated from their fami-  
lies and put into foster homes.  

- Of every 1000 Indian babies born on  
reservations, 32.2 die within the  
first year, compared to a national  

Big Mama Rag Vol. 7 No. 6  

the Death of Her Daughter  

rate of 23.7.  

- Life expectancy on a reservation is  
44 years, compared to the national  
average of 64 years.  

- Average per capita income for an  
Indian in 1975 was less than $2000  
compared to the national average of  
$6000.

Woman Facing Suit Brought By Her Rapist  

Lori K. Johnston, a 28 year old  
rape victim, is still defending her-  
self in court against charges  
brought by the 29 year old alleged  
rapist, Riley Henderson. Lori is  
now being sued for $60,000 by Hender-  
son for malicious prosecution for  
having brought the original rape  
charge.  

The original rape trial in Port-  
land, Oregon in December of 1976 was  
dropped in mid-trial, and a judgment  
of acquittal entered. Henderson was  
found neither innocent nor guilty of  
the charge.  

In December of 1978, Henderson's  
attorney, Larry Sokol, had him sign  
papers for the malicious prosecution  
suit against Lori, and she was served  
with the papers exactly two years  
after the trial dismissal.  

Lori filed a counterclaim against  
Henderson in the amount of $422,288:  
$200,000 for being injured and made  
ill from the rape; $45,788 for medical  
expenses; $16,500 in lost wages be-  
cause of the rape; and $200,000 in  
punitive damages. However, on May 18,  

1979, Circuit Judge Charles Crookham  
threw her countersuit out of court,  
on the basis that she had not filed  
in time to meet the two year statute  
limitation.  

Lori Johnston's attorney, Cindy  
Cumfer of the Community Law Project,  
said Lori did not file suit against  
Henderson until after she was sued  
for malicious prosecution because  
"Originally, she just wanted to for-  
get it all."  

"She didn't file suit because there  
is a lot of emotional distress in re-  
living a rape. She decided to counter-  
sue since the whole case is being  
litigated now anyway."  

Henderson was initially indicted by  
a Portland grand jury for rape in the  
first degree in 1976, after probable  
cause was found. He was arrested and  
placed in jail until he was released  
on his own recognizance.  

The criminal case was dismissed  
after a jury had been empaneled, ap-  
parently on the basis of polygraph  
tests administered to both Lori and  
Henderson.  

-Majority Report  

The case has caused concern among  
women's support groups in that it  
will encourage men acquitted of rape  
to file malicious prosecution law-  
suits, thereby discouraging women  
from reporting the crime of rape.  

Lori's case has spurred the forma-  
tion of the "Oregon Coalition For  
Change of Rape Laws." Her defense/  
support committee is focusing on  

change of rape laws, preparation for  
testifying for the Legislature, legal  
defense and support work for Lori.  

A defense fund has been set up to  
fight Henderson's suit against her.  
Donations can be sent and made out  
to "The Community Law Project, 1628  
S.E. Ankeny, Portland, OR 97214, with

New Rulings Which Affect Women  

Veteran Preference  

The Supreme Court ruled last month  
that laws which give military veter-  
ans special preferences are constitu-  
tional and do not impermissibly dis-  
criminate against women.  

In a setback for women's rights,  
the court voted 7-2 to uphold a  
Massachusetts law that provides life-  
time veterans' preference in public  
employment.  

Because the Massachusetts law is  
stronger than a similar provision  
used by the federal government and  
laws in 45 other states, the ruling  
will probably thwart any future sex-  
bias challenges on veterans' prefer-  
ence laws.  

Phyllis Segal, a lawyer for the  
National Organization for Women, said  
the decision "flies in the face of  
common sense."  

"What the court is saying is that  
it's okay for a legislature to enact  
a law that hurts women as long as it  
didn't enact the law just because it  
hurts women," she said.  

Justices William Brennan Jr. and  
Thurgood Marshall dissented from the  
majority opinion, stating that the  
Massachusetts law “evinces purposeful  
gender-based discrimination."  

The law had been struck down by  
a three-judge federal court in 1976  
after it was challenged by Helen  
Feeney of Dracut, Mass.  

Ms. Feeney worked as a state employ-  
ee from 1963 to 1975, and three times  
took civil service tests for better  
paying jobs. Each time her ranking  
was lowered because veterans, always  
men, with lower test scores were put  
ahead of her because of the prefer-  

Abortion Legislation  

Abortion is the legal right of  
all women," declared the US Supreme  
Court in 1973. Yet, since that time,  
repressive anti-abortion legisla-  
tion has been introduced in nearly  
every state, with the initial abor-  
tion victory being taken away, step  
by step.  

Most recently, Massachusetts' Gov-  
ernor Edward King signed into law  
June 12th a prohibitive abortion  
bill. The law forbids the use of  
state or any other public funds for  
victims of rape or incest in their  
efforts to obtain abortion. Public  
school teachers, municipal workers,  
county employees, welfare recipients  
and others covered by the Massachu-  
setts Group Insurance Commission will  
all be denied abortion aid.  

"The legislature's decision not to  
allow victims of rape and incest to  
get publicly funded abortions is  
nothing short of idiotic," said Nan-  
cy Gertner, attorney for the Massa-  
chusetts chapter of the American  
Civil Liberties Union.  

Massachusetts women may have a  
temporary reprieve: enactment of  
the law could be delayed because of  
a pending ACLU suit currently before  
the Supreme Court.  

In New Jersey, an anti-abortion  
bill has already passed 51-17 in  
the state General Assembly. This  
“informed consent" bill would re-  
quire the woman's doctor or abortion  
counselor to show her pictures of  
a fetus at various stages of growth,  
“informing” her that the fetus is a  
person from the moment of conception.  
She would then be required to wait 48
