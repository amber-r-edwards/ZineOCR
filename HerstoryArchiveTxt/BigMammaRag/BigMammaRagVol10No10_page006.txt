voices from our lives

Incest Survivors Speak Out: A Lesbian

Lesbian Incest Survivors

In the spring of 1981, 5
lesbians met to discuss our
incest experiences. We met
for 6 weeks. We did not have
a facilitator, and this worked
out well, except at times
it was hard to get started.
At our first meeting we came

self-help

up with things we wanted to
talk about. We agreed to keep
the format open to change
because none of us had a real
grasp on what could evolve.

As a result of a conflict that
happened in our group, we re-
alized there has to be some
provision made in advance in
case a lesbian has to miss a
meeting - whether or not to
continue as planned.

One thing we realized was
that our incest experiences
were not just isolated exper-
iences, but acts that we will
carry the results of for the
rest of our lives. These ex-
periences affect our relation-
ships with other womyn as
well as our sense of ourselves.
We wanted to write this arti-
cle to provide some lesbian
analysis, because there is so
little (if any) about incest.
This is not a complete analy-
sis; we only include basic
ideas as we discussed them in
the group so that other les-
bians can use these ideas to
start their own discussion
groups and individual theories.
Some of the important issues
that we discussed (and high-
lights of our discussions)
follow:

1. How we block the past/
what triggers memories. Some
of us have trouble remembering
the actual experiences while
others have forgotten portions
of their childhoods altogether.
We did this to block horrible
memories and/or to be able to
survive in the same house with
the attacker. Part of the incest
myth is that it doesn't hap-
pen very often and when we
forget our own experiences,
or don't believe our own mem-
ories, or are told by "pro-
fessionals" that our memories
are fantasies or dreams, we
are forced to cooperate with
our enemy and this lie. Just
being able to talk about the
incest experience released
blocks for many of us and al-
lowed us to remember other

experiences, good or bad,
that we had forgotten.

2. Political ideas/ it
happens to all womyn on some
level. All of us have read
books about incest, but found
that they all stress forgiving
Daddy and "keeping the family
(patriarchy) together." As
lesbians, we believe that it's
healthy and necessary to hate
our attackers and never for-
give them. To forgive is to
condone and perpetuate their
behavior; what they have done
is absolutely unforgivable.
As lesbians we don't have the
same investment in male val-
idation as straight womyn,
and therefore don't feel ob-
ligated to cooperate with our
enemy. It is important for
lesbians to create our own
analysis and not just accept
straight perspectives. We
see that all males benefit
from incest in the same way
they benefit from rape.

3. Family relations.
Through our discussions we
were able to see how the
structure of the nuclear fam-
ily (father as patriarchal
head with unquestioned auth-
ority, wife and children as
his possessions) encourages
and promotes incest...and
protects and validates the
attackers. We saw similar pat-
terns of sadistic behavior
(emotional and/or physical)
that permeated our relation-
ships with our fathers, wheth-
er it was called "roughhous-
ing", "games", "affection",
or anger. We recognized our
feelings of betrayal by our
mothers and other female fam-
ily members.

4. Mothers. Rather
than simply seeing mothers as
"partners," which all straight
books do, we see mothers as
victims while at the same
time, feeling angry with them
for not protecting us. Many
of us are still not sure
whether our mothers knew, or
what they could have done to
help us. They believe their
survival is dependent on
maintaining a relationship
with the attacker, and in some
instances this means they
must make a choice between be-
lieving the victim or the at-
tacker, even if it means de-
stroying their daughters.

5. Sexual tension from
father whether acted out phys-
ically or not. It was valid-
ating for us to discover that
we all experienced a level of

sexual tension with our fath-
ers, whether or not an overt
incest experience happened.
We realized that there is a
thin line between affection
and sexual "play." While we
were told it was affection,
it often felt like a viola-
tion--forcing us to question
our own reality and at the
same time feel betrayed.
There is not a "natural" sex-
ual attraction between daugh-
ter and father, no matter
what the Freudians try to tell
us.

6. Not being able to be
young/child. We all felt
like we weren't able to be
children and were forced to
have an “adult" consciousness
from an early age, because we
carried this burden--an incest
experience that left us feel-
ing guilty, scarred, with-
drawn, and/or "different." It
was as though we carried the
“scarlet I."

7. Guilt feelings. In in-
cest, like other crimes a-
gainst womyn, guilt is used
against the victims. She is
made to feel that her behav-
ior caused the attack, which
relieves the attacker of any
responsibility. For some of
us, this was one of the big-
gest obstacles in being able
to deal with the experience.
It wasn't our fault!

8. Lesbianism/sexuality as
incest survivors/body images.
Whether it took the form of
negative self-image, fears
and negative feelings around
sexuality, or ignoring the
fact that we had a body or
sexuality at all, often we
were not even aware of how
deeply incest affected us and
we blamed ourselves for these
feelings. Being in the group
helped many of us make the
connections and see how our
incest experiences have af-
fected our body images and
sexuality.

9. Confrontation. We are
all at different levels in
confronting our attacker or
the womyn around him, but any
action we have taken has felt
very powerful and affirming.
It is important that the at-
tacker not be allowed to for-
get or deny that it happened.
Generations of attackers have
gotten away with crimes ag-
ainst womyn and we as lesbians
have made a commitment to
see it stop. Incest will con-
tinue to happen as long as
the attackers aren't held ac-
countable for their actions.

10. Our personal incest
experiences. We each dis-
cussed our incest experiences;
it was scary, hard and
brought up a lot of old feel-
ings. Following are our in-
dividual experiences:

the five personal accounts
were edited out for length)

Incest Experiences

***I don't think I ever really
forgot my incest experience,
but I did keep it well buried.
When my apartment was burglar-
ized last winter, all those
old feelings of being violat-
ed and afraid surfaced. I
knew I wanted and needed to
deal with them, and this
group seemed like a good way.
My uncle molested me sev-
eral times from the time I
was nine until we moved away
when I was 11. I don't remem-
ber much about the incidents--
in fact, it is only since
this group started that I re-
membered I was 9 when it be-
gan. The first person I was
able to tell was my first
lover (a woman) when I was 21.
It took several more years to
tell anyone else. Prior to
being molested, I had loved
my uncle a lot. The sense of
betrayal was incredible. I
knew not to get close to any-
one again; that anyone I
love or that loves me would
betray me. The only way open
to me was to isolate myself
and not trust anyone. That's
how I led my life for years,
and I still act that way when
I feel insecure or threatened.
While my experience with
my uncle is clearly incest,
my relationship with my fath-
er is not so clear. From the
time I hit puberty until I
graduated from high school
and moved out, my father rough-
housed with me--chasing me
around the house, catching me
and wrestling on the floor,
tickling me, often with my
mother present. I often felt
uncomfortable and sometimes
violated. I fought back, phys-
ically hurting my father a
couple of times. After I left

"..To Heal Myself Now Through Facing My Anger"

Masha

There's a wound in my
psyche. I feel its pres-
ence when the pain builds
up to an excruciating peak
and I cannot ignore it. It
is the pain caused by be-
trayal and bombardment of my
life by pig psychiatrists. I
don't know if the wound will
ever heal. I only know I
want to scream.

Almost seven years ago I
gave birth to my first
child. The depression fol-
lowing became extreme. If
only I had been given the
chance to go through it with
those who understand, like
guides on an acid trip. In-
stead I was delivered into
the hands of shock doctors,
pouring volts of electricity
wracking my body and soul to
jar me into their version of
normality. The message was
clear, ‘shape up or get more
shock treatments.' Two
strong-arm attendants, men
built like quarterbacks,
wrenched my arms behind my
back after I punched them
and a nurse with all my
strength. But, I was power-
less against their massive
size and my screams echoed in
the empty halls. They forc-
ed me down on a bed and gave
me drugs to ‘knock me out!'
When I awakened I felt like
I had amnesia and my head
felt like it had been smash-
ed open with a hammer. I
didn't know where I was or
what had happened. I forgot
how I got to the psych ward
and where I lived. ‘Normal
reactions’ they told me. I'd
recover my full memory they
said, but I didn't. I
resisted again the next time
and the more I resisted, the
more shock treatments I got.
Now, after all these years
my memory is still impaired.
I forget things that happen a
short time ago and often the
content of books recently
read. One of the worst parts
of the experience is the way
I sometimes feel, torn and
divided against myself. Part
of me stands aside over my
shoulder sneering, "crazy."
Many times when I'm with
people, even those closest to
me, and I don't remember some-
thing that happened a short
time ago, I feel cut off from
the vital full power of my
mind before all the shock
treatments. I also
experience a great deal of
clumsiness, often bumping
into things or knocking them
down. One evening a friend
was visiting and I kept
knocking things off the shelf
while making tea. I felt so
bad about myself that I
wanted to leave the room.

Whether my awkwardness is a
result of my own self-con-
sciousness or the shock
treatments themselves, the
end result is very painful.
When I am in this state of
mind I doubt my own worthi-
ness to be in anyone's com-
pany. I become even more
self-conscious and uncoor-
dinated and feel shame and hat-
red.

I've buried my rage against
the shock doctors and the
system which produced them
for almost seventeen years,
turning it inward against my-
self. It's painful to feel
my memory impaired and to
feel so self-conscious among
friends and loved ones, but
it's a blessing to get in
touch with it, a step to
freeing myself. I am start-
ing to heal myself now
through expressing my anger,
knowing I don't need to be
perfect and am investigating
the possibility of working
with self-hypnosis or math to
improve my memory.

I am telling my story to
reach out to other shock sis-
ters and express how I still
feel affected by the treat-
ments. Self-judgments in-
ternalize our oppressors. We
become our own judge and jury
feeling isolated in silence.

It's difficult to tell a
friend that feelings of awk-
wardness and craziness are so
intense that it's hell to be
in the same room with them.
It's easier for me to assume
that they don't understand
and can't possibly ever under-
stand. When I feel like this
I see everyone close to me ob-
serving my clumsiness and mem-
ory lapses as my oppressors.
I cause even more separation
and pain by being trapped into
silence. When I take the
plunge and express my self-
doubt I feel I'm putting my-
self into a frightening sit-
uation. People will either
understand or not understand.
I may be rejected, but the
key for me is that when I feel
so unworthy, I am rejecting
myself. When I am patient
with myself, other people do
not have awesome power to ac-
cept or reject me, for I will
not reject myself. Facing my
fears gives me power. People
who haven't had shock treat-
ments no longer become oppre-
ssors, but either those who
understand, or who haven't had
a reference point to under-
stand. One of the goals of
this article is to express
what I dared not before, and
reach out to other shock sis-
ters who may be suffering in
silence and confusion. It was
very painful to write my story
but far more painful to re-
main silent.
