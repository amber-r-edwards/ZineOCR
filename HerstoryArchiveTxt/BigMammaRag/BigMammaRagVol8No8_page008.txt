Childbirth In The Year 2000 A.D.:

(The following article is reprinted
and edited from an article by
Corea which appeared in Broads
New Zealand communist newspaper.)

Nativity, A.D. 2000, Susan Rogers
wants to give birth the old-fashioned
way-- vaginally. Since most hospital
births are done by cesarean section,
Susan decides, after her gynecologist
confirms her pregnancy, to deliver at
home. The midwife-- midwives are il-
legal but omnipresent in America—
screens her for risk factors. She
finds none.

Toward the end of the pregnancy,
while Susan and her husband are relax-
ing at their home in Vermont, a heli-
copter swoops down and lands in the
backyard. A physician and a policeman
emerge from the machine and produce a
court order authorizing them to take
the unborn baby into protective custo-
dy to prevent child abuse. They force
the screaming woman into the helicop-
ter.

At the hospital, Susan is taken in-
to a birthing suite decorated with
houseplants, flowered drapes, and a
bedspread. She sits in a rocking
chair, stunned, unaware that during
her one and only visit to the gyne-
cologist, he registered Susan's preg-
nancy with the Regional Perinatal Cen-
ter and implanted in her vagina a
tiny receiver for the electronic fetal
monitor along with a device used to
track migratory animals.

In the computer room, which looks
much like a NASA communications cen-
ter, obstetricians have been follow-
ing her pregnancy for months. (Doctors
at the center often joke about con-
quering inner space.)

Susan's labor is induced with Pit-
ocin, a stimulant. Two hours later,
in the computer center behind the
suite, the screen displaying her mon-
itoring signal reveals "fetal dis-
tress."

The alarm sounds, Susan is rushed
into the operating room, strapped to
the table, anesthetized. A doctor
takes a knife, cuts her abdomen open,
and pulls the baby from her womb.
Attendants transport the baby to the
intensive-care unit for treatment of
respiratory distress.

The patient, still dazed, is wheel-
ed back to the homey birthing suite.

This is Norma Swenson's grim vision
of childbirth in the year 2000. Swen-
son, co-author of Our Bodies, Our-
selves, has been active in childbirth
groups for twenty years and is a form-
er president of the International
Childbirth Education Association.

Nightmare Or Reality?

Why do visions of helicopters dance
in her head at night? Because this is
happening during the day:
The executive director of the Amer-
ican College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists (ACOG) declared in 1977
that home birth, a growing trend, con-
stituted "child abuse" and "maternal
trauma."
Three home-birth couples-- in
Louisiana, Idaho, and North Carolina
were accused of child abuse in early
1978. In the North Carolina case,
police, acting on an obstetrician's
complaint, forcibly took the woman
from her home while she was in labor
and transported her to the hospital.
A low-income woman who wanted natur-
al childbirth refused various inter-
ventions, including Pitocin injec-
tions to speed up her labor, at Bos-
ton City Hospital in June 1978. The
hospital tried to get a court order
forcing her to accept the drug. Then,
as her lawyer explained, "There was
some concern that this lady must be
crazy because she refuses to do what
the hospital staff tells her to do.”
They called in a psychiatrist to
judge her mental health while she was
in labor. After many hours, they "per-
suaded" her to accept Pitocin and an-
esthesia. Several days later, the
hospital announced it was instituting
proceedings to take her baby on the
grounds that she might endanger her
child. The baby, placed in a foster
home for months, has finally been re-
turned to her.
Dr. Jack M. Schneider, co-director
of the Wisconsin Perinatal Center in
Madison, has proposed a national reg-
istration of pregnancies.

A “regionalized system of obstet-
rical treatment,” which involves
shutting down maternity services in
small community hospitals and trans-
porting mothers and infants to large,
technologically oriented hospitals,
is being established throughout the
United States.

Suzanne Arms, author of Immaculate
Deception, believes that when America
has been fully converted to a region-
alized obstetrical system, physicians
and health authorities will be close-
ly coordinated enough to make Norma
Swenson's helicopter nightmare a
real possibility.

Increasingly, women like Susan
Rogers want midwives to help them
bear their children at home. With the
re-emergence of midwives in America
today, it is important to ask why
they ever disappeared.

As Dorothy and Richard Wertz point
out in Lying-In: A History of Child-
birth in America, physicians in the
nineteenth century struggled to drive
these women, their competitors,
from the lying-in-chamber.

They saw midwives as threats
to the very founding of their
practice at a time when no
established medical profession
existed in North America.
Women, they feared, might seek
midwives for help with all
their “female troubles," and
doctors would lose at least
half their potential patients.

Historians emphasize this point:
Doctors did not replace midwives in
America because their attendance at
birth assured a safer outcome.

Birth Like A Car Crash

During and after the anti-midwife
campaign, physicians redefined birth,
changing it from a normal to a path-
ological process. They asserted that
no precaution-- including the employ-
ment of a physician-- was too great
to avoid its frightening dangers.

In 1920, an influential paper advo-
cated routine forceps delivery and
episiotomy (an incision made to widen
the birth canal) for all deliveries.
Dr. Joseph DeLee, one of the most
revered men in American obstetrics,
asserted that normal birth was patho-
logical and compared it to a baby's
getting its head caught in a door.

Demonstrating that physicians still
view birth as pathological, Dr. Ed-
ward Hon, developer of the electronic
fetal monitor (EFM), recently compar-
ed normal labor to a certain railroad
crossing "where cars get smashed up
and people get killed."

Such a dangerous event seemed to
justify what obstetricians now call
“active management of labor"-- the
artificial initiation, control and
termination of labor by doctors.
This active management has gone far
beyond the routine surgical procedure
(episiotomy) that DeLee brought to
normal birth, a procedure that has
never been demonstrated, by any
study, to benefit mothers or babies.

Interviews with obstetricians re-
veal that by 2000, childbearing women
(who under the pathological model of
birth have become "patients") and
their unborn babies can expect new
forms of "active management."

Since obstetricians are developing
techniques for reaching babies in
utero, they may be peered at, medi-
cated, and operated on before they
are even born, several doctors en-
thusiastically told me.

In one procedure, the obstetrician
will cut into the pregnant woman's
abdomen and uterus and, using what is
called a "fiberoptic endoscope," push
into the amniotic sac and peer at the
fetus through the telescopic lens in
the instrument. Then the doctor will
clip off a piece of the baby's skin
and draw blood from it for what doc-
tors call “diagnostic purposes."

Long term effects of this procedure
on mother and child are unknown, but
some of the immediate risks to the
mother are:

Spontaneous abortion.

Leakage of amniotic fluid during
later months of pregnancy.

Uterine bleeding.

Infection.

Puncture of other organs.

Rupture of the baby's blood ves-
sels, leakage of the blood into the
mother's circulation, and the con-
sequent buildup of antibodies in
the mother against her child's
blood.

Psychiatric disturbances.

In 2000, doctors will be able to
medicate the "sick" fetus by inject-
ing drugs into the amniotic fluid or
by inserting a needle directly into
the fetus. The success of the proce-
dure, of course, will depend upon
the doctor's ability to hit the right
part of the unseen baby.

Obstetricians could, of course,
peer at, medicate and operate on a
fetus more efficiently if it devel-
oped in a glass container. Even that
is envisioned by one medical ethic-
ist, Dr. Joseph Fletcher of the Uni-
versity of Virginia Medical School.
During a discussion of the first
test-tube baby, an ABC television
interviewer asked Fletcher, "Do you
foresee the day when artificial wombs
made of plastic or metal or whatever
will be used?"

"Yes, yes, I foresee it with urgent
approval," he replied. “I think I

Acknowledging that hospital birth
lacks warmth," some doctors foresee
a less mechanized birth by 2000.
Obstetricians will develop machines
and techniques that are unobtrusive,
noninvasive, and less visible, they
say. Surroundings will be made more
pleasant for mothers. Curtains will
be flowered.

“We'll be able to monitor things
without too much invasion of the
patient's body," Dr. Flowers of Ala-
bama predicts. "We're going to com-
bine warmth and a humanistic atti-
tude with newer developments in el-
ectronics."

However, the fact that a region-
alized system of perinatal care pro-
viding high-technology assistance
for all pregnant women is now being
established throughout the United
States casts doubt on the prediction
that birth will soon be rehumanized.
According to a plan published in

should be eager for the day when I
could actually see, let's say through
a glass container, a conceptus devel-
op from fertilization through to
term and see how all kinds of congen-
ital mishaps which destroy or injure
these babies might be prevented by
medical tactics and medical strate-
gies."

Digital Babies

By 2000, electronic fetal monitors,
used now to record the mother's con-
tractions and the baby's heartbeat,
may operate without wires, through
remote-control monitoring of a fetus,
says Dr. Stanley James, of Columbia
University, who specializes in the
care of newborns. "That's the same
as the astronauts have," he noted.

Dr. Edward Hon acknowledges that
all the techniques for such monitors
(key elements in the helicopter
nightmare) are available today.

"There is a dual electrode that
can be placed in the vagina right
now. And I foresee the time when we
will have it transmitting to a piece
of equipment while the woman is up
and walking around. If they can do
it from the moon to earth, they can
certainly do it from a woman to a
console fifteen feet away," said
Dr. John Evrard.

(Space-age analogies come up extra-
ordinarily often in conversations
with obstetricians. Indeed, obstetri-
cians are already using some techno-
logy developed in the space program.

Dr. Saul Lerner, faculty member at
the University of Massachusetts Med-
ical School, hopes computers will
calculate how long each stage of
labor should be. He told the Boston
Globe, "We now have a very aggres-
sive approach to pregnancy. There's
a whole new concept plotted out by
computers, how long each stage of
labor should be. We will not allow
a woman to labor for more than four
hours without making progress. We
do cesarean sections freely.”

In 1977, small maternity services in
local communities will close down
and all birthing mothers will be
sent to large regional centers boast-
ing the latest obstetrical technolo-
gy. (What Dr. Muriel Sugarman calls
"large, cold, impersonal birth fac-
tories.")

Dr. Jack Schneider, co-director of
what Sugarman might call a birth
factory-- the Wisconsin Perinatal
Center in Madison-- predicts that
by the early 1980s, all pregnancies,
registered by physicians with the
regional perinatal center, could be
monitored throughout the United
States. Commenting on this predic-
tion, Elliot McCleary writes in his
book New Miracles of Childbirth:

"Then virtually every fetus nest-
ed or kicking in every womb through-
out America would have an electronic
guardian angel in the form of a
watchful computer.”

Indeed.

The ability to “actively manage"
birthing with the new technology
gives obstetricians great power to
control nature. Month by month, this
power grows. As the world realized
with the birth in Britain of Louise
Brown-- conceived in a petri dish
and delivered by knife-- doctors can
control not only the birth process
but reproduction itself.

Physicians can artificially insemi-
nate a woman. They can fertilize an
egg artificially. They can implant a
fertilized egg in a uterus. Now men
like Dr. Robert Goodlin of Stanford
are hard at work on those glass or
steel wombs whose mass production
Dr. Fletcher so joyfully envisions.
"Quality control” talk is on the in-
crease.

But perhaps reproduction and child-
birth in 2000 will not be managed
entirely as obstetricians would like
it to be. A grassroots rebellion
against establishment obstetrics is

now beginning to gather momentum.
It broke out, quietly at first, in
1960.

As different home-birth organiza-
tions were growing, some women, re-
jecting expensive hospital maternity
care they found dehumanizing, began
to deliver their babies at home,
often with the help of only a few
inexperienced friends. These women
began to be called upon for help by
their friends and neighbors when
they too wanted a home birth. They
gained knowledge and skill. Some
emerged as lay midwives.

Return Of The Midwife

In January 1977, more than 200 mid-
wives held their First International
Conference of Practicing Midwives in
El Paso, Texas. "Home birth is a
civil rights issue,” says Judith
Luce, a lay midwife in Boston. "It's
a woman's civil right to give birth
where she chooses to give birth.”
Nationwide, an estimated 1.5% of
births occur at home.

Such home-birth activists, who
see obstetricians as a special-inter-
est group, challenge the assumption
that the values of physicians should
be given more weight than their own.
Their beliefs are generally sum-
marized as follows:

Up to 90% of well-nourished child-
bearing women can give birth with-
out difficulty or the need for ob-
stetrical intervention.

Rather than continuing research on
intensive-care units and sophisti-
cated machinery for defective new-
borns, specialists in maternity
care should emphasize the preven-
tion of birth complications by
counseling pregnant women on nutri-
tion and by supplementing inade-
quate diets.

Obstetricians have an economic and
emotional interest in suppressing
midwives and in defining the needs
of birthing women as highly com-
plex.

Major technological advancements
in obstetrics such as intensive
care nurseries, amniocentesis, and
ultrasound have not led to marked
improvement in maternal and infant
health during the last two decades.

(Amniocentesis is inserting a
needle into the uterus, drawing
fluid from the amniotic sac of the
fetus and testing the fluid for
metabolic and chromosomal damage.
Ultrasound is a mechanical radiant
energy used as an alternative to
X-rays to visualize the fetus. The
external EFM also uses ultrasound
in monitoring the fetus during
labor.)

Many technological interventions
in childbirth lead to doctor-
caused illness.

The long-term effects of invasive
diagnostic procedures and manipu-
lations of normal labor, while as
yet unknown, may be considerable
and adverse.

They, as parents, and their child-
ren will have to live with the
adverse effects, and obstetricians
will not.

Childbirth organizations offer
scrupulously documented critiques of
many current obstetrical practices,
the benefits of which, they maintain,
have never been proven to outweigh
their risks.

The widespread use of ultrasonic
equipment during pregnancy and in
fetal monitoring during labor is a
“perfect example of how common prac-
tice is established before appropri-
ate practices can be defined,” was
one observation at recent Senate
hearings on obstetrics. While ACOG
believes ultrasound to be safe and
recommends its widespread use, FDA
scientists are concerned about its
possible dangers. (In some animal
studies, an increased incidence of
fetal deformities has been found
after low-level exposure to ultra-
sound.)

EFM is another procedure widely
used despite the fact that its effic-
iency has never been conclusively
demonstrated. Developed in the 1950s
by Dr. Edward Hon, internal moni-
toring records fetal heart rate and
uterine contraction pressure. The
physician breaks the protective bag
of waters prematurely and inserts two
catheters containing electronic
leads. One spiral electrode punctures
the fetal scalp and relays the fetal
cardiogram. The other relays the rate
and pressure of uterine contractions.

Originally planned for high-risk
pregnancies, EFM is increasingly be-
ing used for all labors despite a
study showing that one half the trac-
ings of fetal heart rate and uterine
contractions cannot be interpreted,
that 25% of the women describe fear
and pain associated with the monitor-
ing catheter, and that complications
include bleeding, minor vaginal and
cervical lacerations, uterine perfor-
ation, increased incidence of infec-
tions, and fetal-scalp hematomas.

Moreover, a study comparing the
effectiveness of EFM to the old-fash-
ioned method of monitoring fetal
heart tones (
