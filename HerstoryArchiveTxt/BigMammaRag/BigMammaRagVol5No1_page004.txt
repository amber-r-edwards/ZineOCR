**Working Women Lose Pregnancy Decision**

**Court Ruling**

In a major setback for the women's movement, the Supreme Court ruled in December that employers may refuse to pay disability benefits to women for pregnancy.

The decision, in a case involving women workers at General Electric, was a big victory for employers who contend that coverage of childbirth and pregnancy complications adds significantly to their costs.

According to an article in the December 8 Wall Street Journal, “The ruling reinforces the growing impression that members of the business community are likely to get a sympathetic hearing when they take crucial cases to the court headed by Chief Justice Warren Burger, who was appointed by Nixon."

The Supreme Court's ruling overruled six previous rulings by U.S. Courts of Appeals. Every Court of Appeals that has considered the issue has held that exclusion of pregnancy from disability coverage violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Title VII prohibits employers from discriminating against any person "with respect to her/his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment” on the basis of race or sex.

The Supreme Court's ruling also rejects the findings of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC) that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex.

**BECAUSE**

OF COURSE THE SUPREME COURT RULED AGAINST THE COURT PREGNANCY BENEFITS MUST PROTECT FOR WORKING PREGNANT...

Patricia Beyea from the ACLU said, “Its impact is difficult to determine now, but potentially it's disastrous. In the worst possible sense, employers can now treat pregnant women as badly as they like—can fire them, refuse to hire them, or force long leaves of absence.” Nadine Taub, law professor, said the decision would serve to block women from the labor market on a national level. And Janice Newman, a coordinator for NOW, said the court decision compounded the economic discrimination of women, particularly in the case of low-income families where a woman's income is "very important."

In New York City, Bettye Roberts, president of District Council 1707 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said she was meeting with a group in her union to discuss ways and means of circumventing the court decision to avoid harm to members of her union.

The Supreme Court ruling paves the way for companies that currently provide coverage for pregnancy-related absences to drop it from their plans. Companies that have not had such plans, but have been under pressure to adopt them, now need not do so.

Currently, 60% of all U.S. companies have no disability program at all. Of those that do, only 40% include some maternity coverage, usually limited to six weeks as opposed to lengthier coverage for other disabilities.

The suit against GE charged that failure to include pregnancy in the company's disability coverage programs constituted discrimination on the basis of sex. But, in ruling against the GE workers, the Supreme Court found in essence that pregnancy is a “unique” and “voluntary” condition, and that refusal to cover it is not evidence of discrimination on the basis of sex per se.

Ruth Weyand, of the International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (IUE), argued the suit on behalf of the women workers before the Supreme Court. She said, "We've been trying for twenty-five years to get GE and Westinghouse to provide pregnancy benefits. They will pay disability benefits for hair transplants, for alcohol cures, and for sports injuries, but not for childbearing."

To support their finding that GE had not engaged in sex discrimination, Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist stated that “there is no risk from which men are protected and women aren't."

He also cited cost figures submitted by GE showing that the average cost of disability benefits even without pregnancy coverage was nearly twice as great for women employees as for men.

GE maintained that the total cost to the nation's employers of adding maternity benefits to the disability plans that were in effect in 1973 would have been more than $1.3 billion (a figure which is said to be inflated).

In his dissent, Justice Brennan branded the majority's analysis "fanciful," "simplistic," and “misleading," saying that it “simply disregards a history of General Electric practices that have served to undercut the employment opportunities of women who become pregnant while employed.”

He noted that GE's disability plan covers other “voluntary” disabilities, as well as such exclusively male risks as prostate surgery, vasectomies, and circumcision.

**The Employers**

Commenting on the case, Sylvia Law of the New York University Law School pointed out that arguments both for and against pregnancy disability benefits are almost always based on “the assumption that having children is a woman's trip."

"This is a false assumption,” she asserted. “First of all, having children necessarily involves men, and secondly, providing for the next generation should be the responsibility of everyone. My point is that pregnancy is not ‘a woman's disease.’ And the ‘costs' should be spread on everyone."

The Supreme Court decision in no way bars a union from including pregnancy benefits under a health and welfare plan. Nor does it prevent states from adopting laws of their own, or Congress from amending the Civil Rights Act to make such payments mandatory and specific.

"In some ways this may be the worst time to bring this up in Congress," said Sylvia Law, “because there's all this talk that if women would just go back to the home—then unemployment wouldn't be such a big problem."

"It may be an uphill battle,” she concluded. “That's where we've got to fight now."

**Jury Selection Begins In Inez Garcia’s Retrial**

In the summer of 1974, Inez Garcia's case burst onto the consciousness of feminists in the Bay Area. The women responded immediately by forming a defense committee and publicizing her case nationally.

Inez had just emerged from four months in the Monterey County Jail in Salinas, where she had held out virtually alone, refusing to be pressured into calling her act of self-defense a crime.

It was not the act itself that made her case unusual. Many women have found themselves having to pick up a gun to protect themselves or their children. What was unusual was that Inez did not recant under the blackmail, intimidation, and deliberate confusion that are part of the routine “justice” emanating from typical U.S. courts and D.A.'s offices.

It was this strength of Inez's that made it possible to rally support for her case and with that to support the right of self-defense for all women.

At the outset, active, vocal support came mainly from feminist women. And feminist women felt strongly enough about the issue to make themselves heard.

It was necessary to expose the betrayal committed by Inez’s male attorney and to state the issues in a clear-cut way, before support could grow from that of hundreds to that of thousands. This was done in the now-historic “Inez Was Right" statement, written after Inez was convicted and first circulated at a rally on the day of her sentencing.

Four months later, while Inez was serving time at the California Institute for Women, three hundred women and a dozen male supporters occupied the State Building in San Francisco, demanding Inez's freedom.

Thirty-two women and six men were arrested that day, and one woman was brutalized by police. But that night and the next morning, millions of readers and TV viewers learned that there were women ready to fight for a woman who fought for herself and them too.

Inez's case helped pave the way for the mass support for Joana Little whose eventual acquittal in turn helped broaden the support for Inez.

But Inez’s acquittal is still to be won. The State Court of Appeals overthrew the original conviction—the judge had overstepped even the bounds of racist and sexist courts in his fervor to convict. By the time of this Appeals decision, Inez had spent a total of nineteen months behind bars. But the State was not satisfied. Inez was re-indicted, this time on second-degree murder, and supporters had to put up $5000 bail before she could be released.

Lack of money forced Inez to seek a public defender in Salinas. Her second trial began on Dec. 6 with jury selection. The public defender had misled Inez and the Defense Committee as to his policy in the defense. It became obvious on the first day of the trial that the public defender was going to be a full participant in the railroading of his client.

Many defendants, particularly women, Third World, and poor, have found themselves in this position. One could hardly blame a defendant for thinking there was no way out but to submit to the railroading. But not Inez. And in this she fights for the dignity of all women caught in the web of sexist courts.

Inez fired the public defender. She then entered a motion for dis-
