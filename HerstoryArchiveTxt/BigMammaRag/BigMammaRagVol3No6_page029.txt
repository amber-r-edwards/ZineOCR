Women Protest

NBC Programming

NEW YORK (LNS) —  
Demonstrations and a 24-hour  
Sit-in at NBC network offices in  
New York were held November  
19, protesting a November 8  
program that maligned lesbians.  
The ‘Flowers of Evil’ segment of  
NBC’s Policewoman series  
showed stereotyped characters  
of three lesbians running a con-  
valescent home, who robbed  

and murdered their elderly  
patients.

“Suddenly, NBC has  
decided to air a  

program that shows  
lesbians as the main  
characters. However,  
in a direct attack on our  
struggle, they chose to  
depict us as cold,  
heartless murderers.”

A national campaign failed to  
get the program cancelled, as  
New York Lesbian Feminist  
Liberation (LFL) — initiators of  
the protest — were “repeatedly  
lied to and misled” by NBC of-  
ficials.

“We are presently waging a  
struggle to achieve our civil  
rights in cities all over this coun-  
try,” reads an LFL leaflet handed  
out at the demonstration outside  
NBC. “We have been ignored by  

the broadcast media in  
struggle for a long time.  
“Suddenly, NBC has decided  
to air a program that shows  
lesbians as the main characters.  
However, in a direct attack on  

our struggle, they chose to  
depict us as cold, heartless  
murderers.”

“Since we are never  

portrayed in a positive  
light,” concluded LFL,  
“the only solution is  
cancellation.” But the  

show went on.

Women from various feminist,  
lesbian and civil rights groups  
spoke outside, while a surprise  
sit-in took place inside the of-  
fices of Herminio Traviesas,  
vice-president of broadcast  
standards for NBC.

Traviesas was one of the of-  
ficials, notes LFL, who tried to  
quiet earlier protests before the  
show was aired. Lesbian and  
feminist groups had tried to gain  
access to the script or a screen-  
ing. But NBC officials refused,  
first announcing that the show  
would be cancelled, and later  
claiming that offensive portions  
would be edited out. After the  
show was postponed, officials  
withheld information on the  
rescheduling date and misled us  

about the content,” notes LFL,  
refusing to allow gay groups any  
input in the editing.

“Since we are never portrayed  
in a positive light,” concluded  
LFL, “the only solution is  
cancellation.” But the show  
went on.

So did the protests. A ten-foot  
banner saying “Lesbians Protest  
NBC” was draped from a balcony  
outside the building by the  
women and children sitting in.  
NBC barred press coverage until  
the next day, when the remain-  
ing protesters were finally  
evicted.

“NBC’s decision, despite our  
protests, to air this segment,  
was a gross insult to women,  
because it supported the  
negative stereotypes which op-  
press lesbians and all women,”  
says LFL.

LFL has announced that  
protesters will continue to bring  
mounting pressure on the  
networks, affiliates and spon-  
sors. People can protest such  
programming by writing to Her-  
minio Traviesas, Vice-President  
of Broadcast Standards, or NBC  
Network President Robert  
Howard at NBC-TV Network, 30  
Rockefeller Plaza, New York,  
N.Y. 10020 or one of the many  
sponsors of the show: Chemical  
Bank, Public Relations Depart-  
ment, 20 Pine St., New York,  
N.Y. 10005.

money as of yet because of the  
“strings” that are usually at-  
tached to federal monies. It  
seems that many good ideas lose  
their effectiveness and potency  
when money and the  
professional mentality get in-  
volved.  
RESEARCH UNIT SPEAKS  
The Violence Research Unit of  
Denver General Hospital com-  
piles statistics it obtains from  
women who have either been  
raped or who have successfully  
resisted rape. Their research  
isn’t complete, according to the  
unit, but Drs. Carolyn Hursch  
and David Selkin must have  
thought that they had enough  
numbers and responses to  
publish a report and call a press  
conference to publicize their fin-  
dings. They probably needed the  
publicity so that more women  
would co-operate with them —  
especially minority women who  
tend to be reluctant to talk to  
people who wear white jackets.  
It seems that the good doctors  
attempted to include minority  
women in the project, and  
therefore induce other minority  
women to participate, by hiring a  
third-world woman to be the  
secretary/assistant/clerk at the  
office. Many minority people  
who are concerned with rape in  
Denver have attempted to talk with  
the office with no results. However, this is  
not unusual. Hell, even white  
women’s calls aren't returned.  
To be fair, we must report that  
some calls made to the unit are  
promptly and pleasantly return-  
ed, especially those of the  
Denver Police Department and  
PhD’s. It seems obvious that the  
unit has yet to deal with its own  

sexist and racist attitudes.

Anyway, the unit's study con-  
cludes that many women are  
raped because they don't lock  
car doors and bedroom windows  
and because they hitchhike and  
don’t find out who is at the door  
and walk alone at night. The  
statistics say that 40% of all  
rapes are preventable, if women  
would not think of themselves as  
persons.

The report confirmed the myth  
that ignorance is bliss. It also  
says that vulnerability, not sex-  
ual attractiveness, seems to  
govern the rapist's choice of vic-  
tim. The team says that  
resistance is a statistically  
sound procedure to follow but  
how many women were  
murdered because they resisted  
rape?

The study seems to perpetuate  
the biggest myth of all and that  
is that it is the woman's fault if  
she is raped, i.e. that almost half  
of all women raped could have  
somehow prevented it if they  
had not been acting as if they  
were free.

WOMEN V.S. WOMEN

It is absurd that lines have  
been drawn among women over  
the issue of rape. It must be just  
another way that the society  
perpetuates itself by turning its  
oppressed against one another.  
In Denver the problem is big  
enough for many different and  
diversified groups to get  
together and work on it. It is  
happening and it will take time  
for all women to recognize and  
understand their common  
bonds. Until then, take self-  
defense classes that will be  
offered by the Storefront in the  
beginning of February.

THE GREAT GODDESS

The Great Goddess is a series of 9 original linoleum block prints  
created by Ruby Charisma, Miriam Flambe and IRB Trout, three women  
artists living in Southern Illinois.

The artists have drawn their imagery from the mythology of various  
cultures and ages. Generally, the prints depict the concept of an ul-  
timate feminine deity — at the same time some of the images are  
representations of specific myths.

The blocks are hand printed on fine rice paper and cloth. The cloth  
prints are $5.00 each and the paper are $3.00.
