Women In Peru

Dear Mama,

The following excerpt from
a letter written by a women's
movement leader in the kar-
riadas or shantytowns of
Lima, Peru, is addressed to
North American women in the
hope they will respond to
the specific needs of women
in Peru who are suffering
the effects of increased po-
litical repression against
them and their families:

As you know, our compañeras
from the provinces are
those who suffer most. We
now have a place to put them
up (when they come to the
city to try to get family
members out of jail, visit
them, and bring them neces-
sities the government doesn't
provide such as drinking
water and warm clothing).
Since my mother died we are
using her house, but we need
blankets, cooking utensils,
changes of clothes—in short,
everything. We have to re-
construct the house so we
can have various rooms, sim-
ilar to the way the compañeras
lived at Torrico (a
community of household work-
ers who lived together in
downtown Lima before their
eviction a year ago). The
women who come from the pro-
vinces are organizing them-
selves into committees to
make it easier for them to
go from office to office
with legal papers, to get
medicine and other things to
their children and others
who are political prisoners.
Perhaps with your help we
can find a way to connect
with some institution that
can assist us. That would
be a very important way to
build some solidarity..."

In response to this appeal
I am seeking pledges from
BMR readers to make monthly
contributions. Popular move-
ments, women's movements,
economic and political re-
pression are all growing
in Peru. The needs of women
there for solidarity and
material support from women
outside the country are ur-
gent and immediate, but they
are also long-term. The link
between North American wom-
en and women in Peru is vi-
tal for all of us. It is
perhaps even more vital for
us than for them, since we

have so much to learn from
them about living in commun-
ity and about fighting a-
gainst both male domination
and aggression from the big
businesses that oppress us
both.

Please send pledges or

contributions to Andrea
Gabriel, 2510 West Pikes
Peak Avenue, Colorado
Springs, CO 80904.

Yours in appreciation for
the work BMR is doing to

build consciousness among
all women for our common
liberation.

Greek Movement

Dear friends,

I am writing to you on be-
half of the Movement for the
Rights of Mental Patients
in Greece. Our Movement,
which has been in existence
for two years, is still in
the early stages of its de-
velopment. This letter is
an expression of our hope
to get in contact with sim-
ilar organizations through-
out the world, believing
that it can strengthen and
contribute to our mutual
cause to maintain such con-
tacts.

The Movement for the Rights
of Mental Patients is the
only such organization in
Greece. Members consist of
present and former mental
patients, interested pro-
fessionals from the fields
of Psychology, Psychiatry,
etc., and any others wish-
ing to contribute to our
cause. Our primary goals
have been to ensure that
mental patients be entitled
to the basic human rights
enjoyed by the general pop-
ulation, to make our cause
known to Government agen-
cies and the public at
large, and finally, to help
those patients who are still
institutionalized.

We look forward to hearing
from you and to learning
about your project; in addi-
tion, we would appreciate
any information/literature
that would be of aid to us
in continuing our efforts.

Sincerely,

Rena Hadjidaki

Movement for the Rights of
Mental Patients, 16A, S.

Who Is The Enemy?

Dear BMR,

As a long-time supporter
of BMR, I want to start this
letter with praise for the
work you are doing. You con-
sistently report the strug-

GETTING
OLD IN
AMERICA

BY SYLVIA

gles of people who are den-
ied a voice not only in the
establishment media, but in
most of the alternative
press as well. Still, there
are women who should have a
voice in your paper, but
aren't getting it: I mean,
women or groups who are in
some way part of the strug-
gle against this oppressive
system we live under, but
who have been accused by
someone else of crimes or
oppressive political prac-
tices.

Too often, I think, BMR
treats groups in struggle—
who may not be struggling
very well—the same way it
treats the “enemy”—Reagan
and the Pentagon and all
those institutions that form
this country's power struc-
ture: that is, with harsh-
ness and without respect.

Specifically, I'm talking
about Kady's article ("We
Asked Them To Call Us Crafts-
women", Aug/Sept. 1983),
which discusses her dispute
with Barbara Grier of Naiad
Press, and Susanna Smith's
October, 1983, coverage of
RAAP, the Rape Awareness
and Assistance Program, which
formed recently in Denver.

In many ways, Kady's ar-
ticle was the kind I always
fantasize about writing in
my more angry or despairing
moments—a rambling series
of complaints against other
women who've hurt or slight-
ed me, spiced with accounts
of how I told them off.
Among other things, Kady ac-
cused Barbara Grier of
building a “lesbian porno-
graphic empire" and refusing
to pay back money Kady be-
lieves is owed to her. There
was no explanation of what
was meant by the porn charge,
nor was there any response
to either accusation from
Barbara Grier, either in the
Aug/Sept issue or in the
following one.

This is not an attempt to
"defend" Barbara or Naiad.
If Kady or BMR wanted to do
a political analysis of
Naiad, she or you could have
done a well-researched arti-
cle on the subject. At the
very least, Barbara was en-
titled to the right to re-
spond to those charges in
the same issue—the same
right you would grant to
yourselves if someone ac-

cused you of theft or of
publishing porn. Waiting to
see if the "accused" writes
in for the next issue doesn't
cut it. If she isn't too
angry to respond, a delayed
response means that only
readers who have seen both
issues will have a chance to
get the "complete" story.

Personally, I don't think
Kady's article should have
run at all, considering the
back-handed slams it took
at several other women as
well as at Barbara Grier.
And it disappoints me that
Kady, who is such a fine
woman and writer ("The
Notebooks Emma Gave Me")
should produce a hatchet
job for BMR.

To deny a person or group
a voice when a charge has
been made against her or
them is to treat them as
an enemy. It would be ab-
surd to call Larry Flynt
and ask for a response to
feminist charges that he
is building a pornographic
empire. But is Barbara
Grier an enemy?

The same question applies
to RAAP. Is RAAP an enemy?
From reading Susanna's ar-
ticle, one could easily
think the new rape hotline
in town ranked right up
there with the Pentagon. I
found myself agreeing with

many of the criticisms and

arguments Susanna made,
such as the implications

of referring rape victims
to therapists who may col-
laborate with the psychiat-
ric system, or to the po-
lice and courts. Yet at

the end of the article, I
was angry, wanting to “de-
fend" RAAP. Why? Once ag-
ain, as in reading Kady's
article, I felt as if I

had been given only part of
the story. Why not give the
organizers of RAAP a chance
to explain themselves, in-
stead of selecting out a
few facts about the organ-
ization and a few quotes
made by one RAAP organizer
at a community meeting a
month earlier? Did anything
change after the community
meeting? Does everyone in
RAAP have the same opinion
as the person you quoted?
Why wasn't RAAP allowed to
respond to every accusation
