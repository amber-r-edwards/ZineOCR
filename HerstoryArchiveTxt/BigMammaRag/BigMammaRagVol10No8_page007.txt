‘Positive Energy As Mind-Control And Brainwashing  

Rose  

Amerikans live in a nation  
made rich by the plunder and  
destruction of native peoples  
and native lands of the  
earth, by imperialism and  
white supremacy. The ruling  
class has most of this sto-  
len wealth, so much wealth  
that you or I cannot fathom  
just how much, but it allows  
a few crumbs to trickle down.  
Of course, the biggest crumbs  
go to the professional clas-  
ses and to white people,  
while people of color, who  
have built this country with  
their labor and knowledge,  
go hungry.  

Even now, with this econ-  
omic crunch and unemploy-  
ment, Amerikans live afflu-  
ently compared to other  
peoples. Here in this land  
of plenty, of video games  
and colored TV and cars and  
planes and designer jeans,  
here in this land, we are  
a nation of addicted people.  
Some get valium to numb them-  
selves, some get alcohol,  
some get non-legal drugs,  
some get psychiatric "anti-  
depressants." Just about  
everyone is addicted to sugar  
and lots of salt.  

Poisons to numb the pain of  
the meaningless alienation of  
our jobs. Poisons to forget  
our sense of isolation and  
loneliness. This is the real-  
ity of life in the Toxic Age.  
The age of science trying  
to steal the power of Nature.  
Poisons spread carelessly  
about the air and the soil.  
Poisons in our bloodstream to  
make living here more bear-  
able.  

As Marianne Faithfull put  
it in "Sister Morphine,"  
"Well, it just goes to show,  
things are not what they seem.  
Please Sister Morphine, turn  
my nightmare into dream."  

Do we tell each other of  
how we struggle to endure this  
emptiness? No, for we have  
been conditioned to express  
ourselves in "positive" tones.  
Sound too “negative” and  
people won't like you, won't  
respect you, and then you'll  
be even more miserable. Hide  
it away, drug it away, say  
you are fine, life goes on as  
usual, status quo, don't let  
your secret out.  

From the day of our births,  
we are made to feel worthless  
and inadequate down deep in-  
side. In school and on the  
job, this is done by stress  

and competition and forcing  
us to study the ideas and  
writings of the privileged  
and highly educated. In the  
Church it is done by teach-  
ing us guilt and respect for  
authority, that is, respect  
for those who rule. In the  
media, it is done by compar-  
ing us constantly to idealized  
images of beauty and success.  
In the home it is done by our  
parents passing on those val-  
ues that keep us powerless  
and sedated.  

This is how the ruling class  

planned to intimidate people,  
mind-control people to support  
this oppressive rule, to sit  
at our desks and work on the  
necessary papers, to work in  
their factories, to punch on  
their computers, to smile  
enough that hardly anyone can  
see that you are dying inside.  
No, you are not “negative.”  

It is this holding on to our  
"sanity," our fear of the un-  
explored terror we feel in-  
side, that keeps us in line,  
keeps us "adjusted" to a  
society that is unliveable  
for us in its emptiness and  
alienation, keeps us "ad-  
justed" to a society that has  
all along been murdering  
people of color, stealing  
them, stealing their land  

and resources.  

What is this positive en-  
ergy/negative energy dichot-  
omy anyway? It is the latest  
version of an old power game.  
If you watch what you say  
and watch what you feel,  
you present yourself in a  
positive, acceptable way,  
you get "strokes." You learn  
to police your own mind, to  
at least outwardly accept  
all this crap that you know  
and I know is killing us all.  
If I complain about the car  
exhaust choking me when I go  

for a walk or ride my bicycle,  
many people have told me not  
to dwell on the “negative.”  
I guess I'm supposed to  
breathe shallowly, think hap-  
pier things, and strive to  
become a member of the afflu-  
ent class so to be able to  
afford a cabin in a country  
weekend retreat.  

No, no, no, no! We need to  
reach out to each other  
with honesty. Believe me,  
lots of people are very un-  
happy these days. We need to  
stop policing our feelings  
and words and say what we  
think. Goddess, maybe then  
we can find our power and  
sense of unity, responsibil-  
ity to people struggling to  
stop U.S. imperialism from  

colonizing their lands.  

We need to look at who is  
incarcerated in this society,  
in prisons and mental instit-  
utions (mental hospitals).  
People of color are getting  
locked up in jails and pri-  
sons, while white people get  
probation for the same  
"crimes." What is crime? Who  
are the criminals anyway?  
Who are the murderers? It is  
the people on top, not the  
poor people in prison. And  
who are the people incarcer-  
ated in psychiatric institu-  
tions, which are also prisons?  
We are the strange ones, the  
ones who never "adjusted,"  
who talk out loud on the  
streets or who let the truth  
of our alienation come out  
to the world. In both pri-  
sons and psychiatric instit-  
utions, people are getting  
forced-drugged with toxic  
drugs like prolixin and thor-  
azine.  

Even progressives and rad-  
ical feminists and the Left  
are bound up by “positive  
energy" notions of appropriate  
behaviors and expressions. We  
have set up this idea of be-  
ing “strong,” which usually  
means swallowing our need to  
get support from each other  
for our insecurities, our  
vulnerabilities, our feelings  
of weakness and powerlessness.  

It is the time to show each  
other our true feelings. In  
a few years, the ruling  
class's medical henchmen will  
be ready to surgically im-  
plant electrodes in our  
brains to stimulate certain  
responses and deaden others,  
to monitor us with computers.  
In a few years there will be  
surgically implanted devices  
which drip computerized am-  
ounts of drugs into our  
bloodstreams. Now, before we  
are all turned into human  
robots, before the land is  
made totally lifeless by  
pesticides and radiation, we  
have to show each other who  
we really are inside. We need  
to understand that our unhap-  
piness is not because of per-  
sonal inadequacy, as we have  
been made to think. We need  
to take responsibility to  
give back as much of the  
wealth Amerika has stolen as  
we can, by supporting the  
struggles of colonized  
people fighting imperialism  
around the world, and giving  
support and money to people  
of color fighting imperialism  
here.
