Open Letter

to Colorado Women

In a heavily guarded,
makeshift courtroom in the
Civil Defense building three
miles outside Sioux Falls,
South Dakota, a 56-year-old
Oglala Sioux woman is on trial
for riot charges. Sarah Bad
Heart Bull, an Indian mother
of 8 children, stands trial
because of her protest against
the white murderer of her
19-year-old son, Wesley, killed
in January, last year:

Wesley was stabbed to

death by Darryl Schmidt and
the state of South Dakota did
not feel it necessary to try a
white man for killing an
Indian. Sarah announced she
would travel (in the dead of
winter) from the Pine Ridge
Reservation to the distant
town of Custer to protest the
state’s inaction.

When Sarah and her sup-
porters arrived at the Custer
Courthouse to talk to authori-
ties, they were attacked by
riot policemen, arrested and
charged with conspiracy to
riot, riot where arson oc-
curred, disturbing the peace,
etc. Sarah was jailed and bail
of $8,000 was set.

When S.D. authorities
learned her bail would be
raised by an Indian Women’s
group, “Indian Women United
for Social Justice,” located in
Los Angeles, she was re-
leased on her own recogni-
zance.

Then in April of this year,
another son, Butch (age 18)
was shot to death by a white
man in Allen, Nebraska. Sarah
was further brutalized by the
S.D. authorities when she and
other Indian defendants would
not stand to show their
respect for the racist Judge
Bottum, who had allowed
white people who said they
hated Indians to be seated as
jurors. She and the others
were beaten, maced, and
tear-gassed in the courtroom
by police when they would not
stand.

The all-white jury has been
seated and it consists of 7
women and 5 men. Sarah and
the other Indian people are
poor and their legal defense
depends on urgently needed
donations from people across
the country. If you would like
to help Sarah Bad Heart Bull and
the other Indian defendants,
please send your donation to:
Wounded Knee Legal Defense
Fund, Offense Com., Box 255,
Sioux Falls, S.D. 57101.
Letters of petition of support
may be sent to the same
address.

Redbird (the chairperson of
Indian Women United for Social
Justice) was reprinted in part

BMR supports this organization
and urges our readers to support
these issues as well.

Due to the efforts of one
Caroline Nichols Churchill, a
woman of immense courage
and a staunch Feminist in her
time, Denver had a Feminist
Newspaper as early as Octo-
ber of 1879. This is the date of
the first publication of Ante-
lope. The reason for the name
Antelope was explained in
Volume I, issue 2 November
1879:

“Someone wants to know

why we call our paper the

Antelope.” We have several

reasons, which shall be

given as we “rise to
explain.” In the first place,
we wanted something that
had the least feminine
suggestion, something
graceful and beautiful ...
There is another reason for
calling our paper the Ante-
lope which we will give, but
modestly and blushingly,
inform our readers of this
last best cause least under-

stood: the Antelope is a

little deer, and is so difficult

to overtake.”

Caroline Nichols

was not only the editor of the
paper, she was also
publisher and the woman
responsible for a large portion
of the paper’s reporting. Many
of the issues that contempo-
rary Feminists are concerned
with today were the subject of
articles and editorials in
Antelope. For example:
On Consciousness Raising
“There are plenty of women
in this land of freedom who
might better have borne
female pups and drowned
in puppyhood than to have
undertaken life with such
odds against them. The
manner in which women
conform to the errors of
education and submit to
imposition has no parallel
among men, although men
can be educated to fall
upon their faces before
fancied superiors, and to
echo the most absurd
opinions, dictated by their
lords. Persons must be
educated somewhat to a
sense of the injustice done
them before they are
capable of appreciating
assistance or sympathy.”
(Antelope, Vol. I, Issue 3,
Dec. 1879)

ANTELOPE
Social Reform - Labor
Ignores Women
“A woman's sphere is to
seek every good place and
good thing in life and to

acknowledge these facts
except the bigot and the
individual whether man or
woman, not capable of
comprehending the situa-
tion...There is not a hair's
difference in the principle
that makes the Indian place
the pack upon the back of
his wife and the principle of
the class of men who will
form trade unions for the
purpose of excluding wo-
men of our towns and cities
from making a choice in
their occupations and
mode of life. The former
places his victim in the
position of abject slave to
his selfish will, the latter
ditto...” (Antelope, ibid)

On Sexism in the Media
“The papers speak of Mrs.
Romney who is now at
Leadville, as a very bright
woman. How would it
sound if we were to speak
of Ralph Waldo Emerson as
a bright man, of Horace
Greeley as a bright man, of
Jay Gould as a bright man?
Mrs. Romney is a very able
woman; one of superior
talents; one capable of
teaching many of the men
recognized as statesmen
today, and it makes us
fearfully jealous to hear
women spoken of thus by
the masculine press, and
we hope to see a reform in
this direction. No one
nowadays scarcely has
the audacity to consider
anyone inferior unless it should be
a savage Indian or a stupid
foreigner. There are many
intelligent foreigners who
are in advance of the
Americans in recognition
of the claims of Women.”
(Vol. I, Issue 5, Feb., 1880)
ANTELOPE

On Caste Analysis
of Women
“If women or girls are ever
tempted to yield to the
selfish solicitations of men,
let them remember that
society is at present so
constructed as to hold but
one party responsible —
that for a general thing man
has a pride in whatever
woman is ashamed of
...Remember that everything
in nature exists by
contending forces by con-
traries...You will always be
persecuted. It matters not
whether rich or poor, if you
are at all worth noticing,
the good no more escape
ill-will than the vicious, and
are often perfect martyrs to
the tyranny of the wicked.
..When you marry take
your choice of men. If you
cannot do this have the
sublime courage to live and
die an old maid. Do this
rather than give your
children a bad or worthless
father. Better for them and
for you that they have no
father at all....” (Vol. 4,
Issue 8, May 1880)

Advice to Girls -

Laconic Sermons
“Remember that the heart
of man is deceitful above
all things and desperately
wicked.” (Vol. I, Issue 3,
Dec. 1879)

We hope to be able to do a
series of articles about some
of our earlier Feminist Women
in Colorado and particularly
go into some in-depth
information about the Ante-
lope and its successor the
Queen Bee (another Feminist
paper published by Ms.
Churchill) as well as more
information about this remark-
able woman herself, Caroline
Nichols Churchill.
