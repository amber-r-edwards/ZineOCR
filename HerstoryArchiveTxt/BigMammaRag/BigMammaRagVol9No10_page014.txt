Survival Needs Define Jamaican Politics

Elizabeth Bowman and  
Judith Eisenacher

The following is an inter-  
view with Ingrid Kirkwood of  
the International Section of  
the Committee for Women's Pro-  
gress in Jamaica.

Ingrid Kirkwood lived in  
the United States from 1964  
until 1975 when she returned  
to Jamaica. She came to the  
U.S. when she was 15 and was  
influenced by the civil rig-  
hts struggles of the 60's  
and by the progressive move-  
ment here. These struggles  
and the disclosures of CIA  
involvement in other countr-  
ies and the rip-off by the  
multinational companies pro-  

much more to be done.

Q: What is the main strug-  
gle for working women in  
Jamaica today?

A: The main struggle for  
women in Jamaica today cen-  
ters around the high prices  
for consumer goods. Almost  
every producer of any basic  
item in Jamaica is a monopo-  
ly producer. We have one com-  
pany producing milk, one com-  
pany producing flour; rice is  
imported but distributed  
through monopolies. If you  
don't have some controls on  
these people, then you just  
have to pay what they're  
charging. The government had  
instituted a policy in the  
past of price control, and  

feminism and nationalism  

prompted her to become politi-  

cally active when she was 16  
in student politics, mainly  

Black and Caribbean student  

movements.

Q: What influenced you in  
becoming active in the stru-  
ggle for women's equality  
and for national liberation  
in your country?

A: I have always been str-  
ongly motivated by concern  
for the equality of women  
and have realized the link  
between the struggle for my  
own equality and for the  
national liberation of Jam-  
aica. The struggle for equa-  
lity of women is very much  
linked up with the struggle  
for progress and for social-  
ism throughout the world. I  
have been encouraged by the  
conditions of women in soci-  
alist countries because it  
makes me realize that what  
we are struggling for is not  
just a pipe dream, but that  
it is possible to achieve  
equality.

Socialism can provide the  
material basis and the laws  
for that equality. I have  
seen that where there are  
progressive governments in  
the world, women and child-  
ren become more important.  
Under former Prime Minister  
Michael Manley's government  
steps were taken to improve  
the condition of women and  
children—maternity laws,  
laws to protect children  
and to improve the status of  
children born out of wedlock,  
steps that were never taken  
before in the history of our  
country. There is still much,  

120 basic items were on the  
price control list—what we  
call the A list.

Under the first IMF (Inter-  
national Monetary Fund) agree-  
ment that the Manley govern-  
ment signed in 1977, over 60  
items were removed from that  
A list. One of the IMF's pol-  
icies is supply side economics.  
They demand that if they're  
going to give you a loan to  
bridge a foreign exchange gap,  
then you must dismantle many,  
if not all, price controls.

One of the tactics used  
very successfully by big bus-  
iness in the country was the  
manipulation of food—with-  
holding it, diverting it,  
black marketing, creating art-  
ificial shortages. About 1977  
we were able to get the gov-  
ernment to institute a policy  
of voluntary price inspection.

There are still a lot of a-  
buses—for example, the "mar-  
rying" of goods, which means  
you have to buy one good to  
get another that is scarce.  
You end up buying a $2 can of  
carrot juice to get a 50-cent  
or 70-cent bag of rice. You  
end up paying almost $3 for a  
bag of rice, because you don't  
really want the carrot juice.

Since this new government  
has come in, they have signed  
a new IMF agreement and 30  
more items have been removed  
from the price control again.  
Over 15 control items have  
been increased in price 30-  
40%. Things that have gone  
off price control have been  
jumping in price—30-50% in  
just a period of months under  
this new government.

Q: What are conditions like  
for the majority of women in  
Jamaica today?

A: Jamaica has one of the  
most active women's movements  
in the Caribbean, and this is  
tied to the fact that we have  
had a very active national  
liberation movement since  
1974-5 and also because of the  
position of women in our cou-  
ntry. Women are employed main-  
ly in service and domestic  
occupations, many in small  
shops and institutions, and in  
agriculture. Unemployment in  
the country is about 30%—for  
women it is 41%; for men, 17-  
18%. For young people it is  
also high—about 47% for young  
men under 24 and 70% for young  
women.

Many women leave school at  
14 or 15 in Jamaica, and are  
unemployed for 10 years or  
sometimes for their entire  
lives. In 1970 over 99,000  
women had never worked in  
their entire lives—these are  
women looking for jobs. Two  
weeks ago in the Gleaner (the  
largest newspaper in Jamaica)  
it was proposed—with a very  
brutal attitude reminiscent of  
the attitude of the slave  
days—that women who have too  
many children should be puni-  
shed and have their children  
taken away. We say that the  
country has to do something  
about this situation—to help  
the mothers and the children,  
to provide social services,  
etc. The attitude of the rich  
is that helping these women  

WHY  

IMPORT CANNED  
PEPSI!  

What are canned Pepsi and cheddar cheese  
slices doing in our supermarkets?  

Why are we using funds to im-  
port these items when Pepsi is bottled  
locally and cheese is processed here?  

Further, one can of this imported Pepsi  
(12 oz) sells for $1.00 and our local  
bottle Pepsi (same 12 oz) costs 70¢.  

The case of the cheese slices is even  
more disgraceful. The packet of 10 slices  
(about 6 oz) sells for $3.80, while our  
locally processed cheese costs $4.05 per  
lb. WHO ARE WE IMPORTING THESE GOODS FOR?

only perpetuates the situation  
by encouraging them to have  
more children.

One-third of all families  
in Jamaica are headed by wo-  
men, and of that one-third,  
two-thirds are unemployed. Of  

those who are working, over  
50% as of 1979 earn under $30  
a week.

The story of Veronica, a  
woman in our organization, is  
very typical. Veronica, an  
office worker, earns $40 a  
week and has four children.  
She spends 85% of her meager  
earnings on food. Whenever she  
has to pay rent or utility  
bills, she doesn't buy food.  
Out of seven days, she's eat-  
ing well, at an adequate or  
a little above adequate le-  
vel, on one day, Sunday,  
the traditional day for a  
large meal. On Monday she  
may have a little chicken  
left over, maybe even on  
Tuesday. On the other four  
or five days of the week  
she and her children are  
eating poorly, getting less  
than a third of their daily  
calorie needs.

When you're not getting  
calorie needs met you're  
just not getting enough  
food to eat, and this is  
one of the problems in our  
country. What the kids are  
eating is a little pack of  
sweet biscuits and a choco-  
late bar and some sugar and  
water drink for dinner in  
the evening. Some days the  
kids can't go to school be-  
cause there's no money for  
bus fare or lunch money. If  
you have three kids in sch-  
ool and you're even paying  
only the 10% subsidized bus  
fare for them, that's 20  
cents a day for each child,  
and most children of work-  
ing mothers receive about  
50 cents a day from their  
mother's salary for lunch  
money, out of which they  
have to spend 20 cents for  
bus fare. That leaves about  
30 cents a day for lunch.  
Food in Jamaica is about  
the same price or more in  
many cases as food in the  
United States. About all  
30 cents can buy is a pop-  
sicle, and maybe a little  
hunk of cheese.

Q: Could you tell us a-  
bout the Committee for  
Women's Progress?

A: The Committee of Women  
for Progress, founded in  
October 1976, came together  
spontaneously to counter  
the CIA-instigated violence  
in Jamaica. It joined  
the women in the People's  
National Party. We decided  
it wasn't enough for us to
