Shelly Miller Talks About Recent Grand Jury Attacks Against Political Activists

Susan Goding, transcribing and
additional editing were done
by Susanna Smith and Deb Luger.

Shelly Miller is a member of
the New Movement in Solidarity
with Puerto Rican and Mex-
ican Revolutions. Earlier this
year she was called before a
Grand Jury in New York that
is investigating the FALN,

a Puerto Rican independence
organization. She and another
woman, Silvia Baraldini,
have been charged with crimi-
nal contempt for refusing to
testify to the Grand Jury.

interview

Their trial will probably come
up in September. In June, four
members and one supporter of
the Movimiento de Liberación
Nacional (MLN), an organiza-
tion for independence of Puerto
Rico and for the socialist re-
unification of Mexico [see Hot
Bridges], were sentenced to 3
years for "criminal contempt"
for refusing to testify before
the same Grand Jury.

SG: Why are you here in Denver?

SM: "Well, I'm here because I'm
on a national speaking tour for
the New Movement in Solidarity
with the Puerto Rican and Mexi-
can Revolutions to highlight
the question of the Grand Jury
attacks on the Puerto Rican in-
dependence struggle. I was sub-
poenaed in February to a Grand
Jury (in Brooklyn, NY) invest-
igating the Puerto Rican inde-
pendence struggle and in par-
ticular the FALN (Fuerzas Arma-
das de Liberación Nacional).
After serving a month in jail
on civil contempt, the charges
were changed by the U.S. attor-
ney and the judge to criminal
contempt. So I'm now waiting
trial, I'm out waiting trial on
criminal contempt charges for
refusing to testify before this
Grand Jury. So I'm here to talk
about those issues.

SG: How common is this criminal
charge?

SM: Well, it's actually a very
recent phenomenon. There has
been a very staunch refusal
from the Puerto Rican indepen-
dence struggle since 1936 and
in particular since 1977, to
testify before grand juries in-
vestigating the independence
struggle and leftist struggles.

The question of non-collabor-
ation has been the stance that
the Puerto Rican struggle has
taken and many leftists have
taken, in response to the
fact that this particular
Grand Jury hasn't been able
to penetrate the Puerto Rican
independence movement. So
they escalated the charges,
and escalated the penalty for
refusing to testify before a
Grand Jury to criminal con-
tempt. In this period of time
there have been other charges
of criminal contempt. And in
the case of the four members
of the MLN and one supporter,
who on Feb. 16 were convicted
of criminal contempt for re-
fusing to testify before the
same Grand Jury that I've
been called before. Myself
and Silvia Baraldini, another
North American woman who is

a member of the May 19th Com-
munist Organization were call-
ed before this Grand Jury and
both refused to testify. Both
have been charged with crimi-
nal contempt. And then Fred-
erico Cintrón Fiallo and
Carlos Noya are also charged
with criminal contempt. They
are two Puerto Rican activists
and revolutionaries from
Puerto Rico called to this
Grand Jury in NYC. Which is
actually a first, in terms of
the Grand Jury. Puerto Ricans
from Puerto Rico have been
called to Grand Juries in Puer-
to Rico, not to ones in the
U.S. They will go on trial

in June.

The thing about criminal
contempt is, they can only
charge you with it when you
refuse to testify before a
Grand Jury. So you go and you
don't testify and the judge
can either decide if he's
going to give you civil con-
tempt (or criminal contempt).
Civil contempt is supposed
to be a coercive sentence--
you go to jail for up to 18
months or until you decide
to collaborate with the Grand
Jury. Criminal contempt is a
punitive sentence--they give
it to you and punish you for
refusing to testify...So you
are given a jury trial. All
they have to do is bring in
the clerk of the Grand Jury
who says, "No they didn't
testify," so you're guilty.
So in fact the jury trial
is a rubber stamp for the
government's plan to imprison
public activists who support
the Puerto Rican independence
struggle, its revolutionary

leadership, and are in fact
leadership of the struggle
themselves or in our case are
supporters of that struggle.
An anonymous jury was cal-
led for the five in Feb. It was
the first time in a political
trial that the U.S. govern-
ment has requested an anony-
mous jury. And they did so,
they said because they were
protecting the lives of jury
(members) allegedly from be-
ing attacked by the FALN. In
fact, it was to create a ter-
ror atmosphere for the jury
itself. It was a question of
creating a mass hysteria and
fear that "terrorists" would
come and get them. When in
fact the content of what the
FALN is about has never been
terrorizing innocent human be-
ings but to bring the question
of Puerto Rican independence
to the eye of and make the
people understand what is going
(on) and to attack the
centers of oppression.

SG: What happens when a person
does collaborate with the
Grand Jury? What happens to a
community and why don't you
say "I don't know" to the
questions of the Grand Jury?

SM: A lot of people have said
that to me. I don't know any-
thing about the workings of
the FALN. The New Movement
supports the FALN as a part
of the Puerto Rican indepen-
dence struggle, but I don't
know anything so why wouldn't
I go to the Grand Jury and
either plead the Fifth Amend-
ment or just say I don't know,
I don't know. There are seve-
ral reasons, one is that the
whole process and the whole
existence of a Grand Jury in-
vestigating the Puerto Rican
independence struggle is an
invalid process because the
colonization of Puerto Rico
by the U.S. is illegal. They
invaded and maintain their
presence there by force and
so the fact they have a Grand
Jury investigating the very
movement trying to take back
control of its own nation is
an illegitimate process, an
illegal process and to cooper-
ate with it would give legit-
imacy to that very process.
So that's one aspect. The
second aspect is that they
really do use the Grand Jury
investigations to investigate,
to find out information. And
Juan Antonio Corretjer, of

La Liga Socialista Puertorri-
queña said that whatever in-
formation given no matter how
little, allows them to tighten
the net around the armed
clandestine movements because
they ask you, do you know so
and so, do you know so and
so.

Betty Carr, another member of
the New Movement present at
the interview: There has been
a criminalization of politi-
cal beliefs and activities.
They have made us criminals
for our politics.

SM: I think it's very serious,
that question of criminaliza-
tion of politics. That's why
the question of the Grand
Jury and criminal contempt is
really important, because
they're trying to make politi-
cal activity illegal. One of
the ways they are doing it,
among others, is to charge us,
and it's also in the FBI
guidelines. In the FBI guide-
lines, there's no difference
between people who advocate
something, and the people who
actually do it. So our saying
that we support the right of
the Puerto Rican people to
fight for independence and so-
cialism by any means necessary
is the same as the FALN or any
clandestine organization in
Puerto Rico, actually doing
armed actions to win libera-
tion. That's what the FBI
guidelines say and that's what
they're moving towards. That's
what the question of criminal
contempt is about. It's so
crucial to be fighting against
it now because I think people
don't quite understand it--
they see it as the New Move-
ment, or the MLN, as sort of
isolated organizations under
attack, rather than creating
the ability to implement
those very things more broad-
ly.

SG: Why reunification with
Mexico as opposed to another
country?

SM: ...the maintenance of op-
pressed nations within the
borders of the U.S. and the
maintenance of workers of
those nations at qualitatively
different and lower salar-
ies than white workers has
been a crucial way that the
U.S. has been able to accum-
ulate the wealth that it has.
It doesn't mean that it gives
white workers what is right-
fully ours, but there is a

"I think it’s very serious,

that question

of criminal-

ization of politics. That's
why the question of the

Grand Jury and criminal
contempt is really
important, because they're
trying to make political
activity illegal.”

difference between white work-
ers and Third World workers
in access to the system it-
self. We believe that white
workers have more in common
with oppressed nations and
their fight against imperial-
ism, but there's a reality in
the fact that imperialism has
been able to give to white
workers some of the benefits.
White people live in occupied
Mexico, in a nation that used
to be under the control of
Mexico. They got land, moved
west, got plots, and are here,
because Mexico...half of Mex-
ico...was stolen. This speaks
to why white people align
themselves with imperialism
rather than with oppressed
nations. I think it's a
question of education, and of
providing a different explana-
tion that makes sense to peo-
ple about the conditions of
their lives. They're trying
to get control and see it a lot
in terms of attacking oppress-
ed peoples of other nations.
(Example:) The reason there
are no jobs in Denver is that
so many Mexicans, "illegal al-
iens" come here. Well, the rea-
son there are no jobs is be-
cause imperialism is in crisis
--they can't provide the jobs.
That's why it's going to war.

SG: The U.S. tries to convince
white people that Third
World people are their enemy--
they need support of white
people to continue exploita-
tion of oppressed nations--to
continue imperialism.

SM: Absolutely! To build fas-
cism they have to have a mass
base for it. They can't do it
if they don't have the major-
ity of white people with them.
I think that's part of the
reason that they have charged
me with criminal contempt and
why they see the threat of an
organization of white people
organizing other white people
as being so great. It's saying
that not only do we support the
fundamental right of people to
fight for their own liberation,
but we think we're part of
that. We struggle with other
white people to be part of it,
to understand what the system

is, and to give a different
answer than what the KKK gives
to people...I think the KKK
is organizing the same base
that we're organizing...They
provide an answer to what's
going on...We have one that
really explains the world:
theirs doesn't---but it's
coherent enough that it's def-
initely organizing people.

SG: Hasn't the United Nations
found that Puerto Rico is a
colony and has a right to
fight for independence?

SM: The De-Colonization Commi-
ttee has. Last September the
question of the colonization
of Puerto Rico was supposed
to come into the General As-
sembly and the U.S. brought
every force to bear to keep it
out of the General Assembly.
It put incredible pressure on
countries around the world,
bribed them, literally, for
them to vote against the ques-
tion coming onto the floor of
the General Assembly and man-
aged to, although it was a
big fight...The De-Coloniza-
tion Committee has come out
and said that Puerto Rico is
a colony, has the right to
self-determination...years
ago... The U.N. Declaration of
Human Rights says that any
nation has a fundamental right
to self-determination and can
fight to win that self-deter-
mination by any means neces-
sary, including the right to
wage armed struggle. It will
come into the U.N....in the
not so distant future, and
the U.S. won't be able to
mobilize enough to stop it.
Enough nations will say, No,
this should be heard.

SG: What work does your organ-
ization do?

SM: The New Movement in Soli-
darity with the Puerto Rican
and Mexican Revolutions sup-
ports the struggle for inde-
pendence and socialism in
Puerto Rico and the socialist
reunification of Mexico. The
territory that the U.S. stole
in 1848 is what we call the
Southwest. (We support) reun-
ification under socialism
with the rest of Mexico,
south of the imposed border.
That's what our work is in
relationship to. We're a
solidarity organization with
those two struggles and see
U.S. imperialism as the ene-
my. We support the right of

any nation to win its inde-
pendence by any means neces-
sary, and in particular the
Puerto Rican nation and of
Mexico to fight for reunifi-
cation under socialism by
whatever means that takes.
It's a right guaranteed by
the U.N. When we talk about
supporting the FALN, it's
within that context. We're not
a support organization for
the FALN.

SG: What was it like being in
jail when you were held dur-
ing the Grand Jury?

SM: I'd just like to say one
thing about jail, 'cause I
was in jail for a month,
thinking I was going to be
there for 13 months. Especial-
ly when I first got out, peo-
ple really wanted to know
what it was like. Because
when people seriously think
about becoming anti-imperial-
ist and taking on the system,
especially when they're using
the threat of jail to scare
people away, people want to
know what it's like. They
want to know how you deal
with it. The question of jail
is really not so hard to deal
with, because when you know
why you're there, and you
have a political reason for
what you're doing, and place
it in that context, then you
can deal with what they're
doing. It doesn't make it not
boring, the food's terrible.
They wage psychological war-
fare against people inside,
especially in federal joints,
in MCCs. There's not much
physical intimidation, espec-
ially for women, but the psy-
chological intimidation is
high level and very subtle.
But you can deal with it. You
develop a way to live. The
question for me was how I was
going to be able to use that
experience to develop myself
the most, and how was I going
to use what I was learning,
being inside, to educate
other people. I got out, and
am now waiting trial facing
actually longer in jail.
It's definitely a question
but it's not the worst exper-
ience of your life. It's not
something you chose to do,
but it's definitely not the
worst thing. Most people can
handle it if they have a pol-
itical center to them.
