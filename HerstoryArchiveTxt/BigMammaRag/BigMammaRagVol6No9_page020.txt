lobbied Representatives in their  
offices. Phyllis Schlafly and her  
followers were there, smiling. The  
tension was high.  

When the hours of debate  
finally ended and the vote to allow  
rescission was defeated by an  
amazing 227 (nays) to 195 (yeas),  
an audible gasp of elation, joy,  
disbelief and relief rose from the  
House floor and from the galleries.  
It was clear that the ERA Extension  
would pass the House intact, the  
only question now was how big

would the majority be.  

The message to the Senate was  
clear; No Rescission! The Speaker  
placed the motion for extension  
before the House and immediately  
declared it passed. The opposition  
demanded a roll call vote.  

As the tally slowly was counted,  
the ERA Extension continued to  
lead by over 40 votes. Extension  
supporters waited in great anticipa-  
tion for the final count, watching  
each Representative’s vote, ready  
to break the gallery ban on demon-  
strations when the clock ran out.  

The final tally of 233 (yeas) to  
189 (nays) was declared. A great

cheer rose from the floor and the  
galleries. The women who had  
worked so hard for this moment  
cried and shouted.  

It was a historical moment.  
Even if the Extension lost in the  
Senate, this was tremendous proof  
of strength! Quickly the galleries  
emptied, and supporters streamed  
down to the main door of the House  
Chamber to give the Speaker, Don  
Edwards (D.CA), and our sisters in  
Congress a tremendous ovation for  
their support.  

Right after the vote, the Nation-  
al Organization for Women held a  
champagne victory party in the  
Rayburn building. The crowd grew  
quickly, clapping and cheering  
continuously as the leaders of the  
Extension battle joined the celebra-  
tion. Ellie Smeal, president of  
NOW and Representatives Don  
Edwards, who led the floor fight,  
Liz Holtzman, Margaret Heckler,  
Patricia Schroeder, Barbara Mikul-  
ski, along with others declared the  
victory a turning point in the  
ratification process. Almost  
immediately attention began to  
focus on the Senate — now with  
renewed hope.
