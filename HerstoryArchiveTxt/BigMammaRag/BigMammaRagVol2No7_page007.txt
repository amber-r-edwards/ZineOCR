Brass Plum: Birth, Life of a Co-op

Carol Lease

wondered  
‘what happened to all the energy  
that dissatisfaction generated in  
the early seventies when the  
rhetoric was fading and people  
were “getting into themselves”?  

Have you ever  

Did anger creating its own  
frustration seek comfort in  
drugs whose banal highs eventually  
descended to religious ex-  
perience?  

Many people recognized  
opportunity in the marketing  
potential of the dissatisfaction  
of “young” consumers, rounded  
up capital and invested in  
counter-culture profits. Some  
people wanted an alternative  
structure to live and work in  
that would not alienate their  
convictions from their necessity  
to survive in a city. And a few of  
these people looked around  
until they saw a store on 17th  
Street across from a small island  
park for rent and took their  
energy and made a co-operative  
for artists and craftspeople to  
make and display and sell their  
work.  

The Brass Plum opened in  
December of 1970 when about  
thirty people decided that they  
wanted to work and sell their art  
and crafts through a co-opera-  
tive business structure. Annie  
Wood, an original member of  
the co-op, recalls, ‘‘a lot of  
different people were into social  
change at that time... high  
school kids from some kind of  
street academy helped build in  
the store, their teacher really  
liked the idea of a co-op and let  
them stay in the store instead of  
a classroom.  

Co-op Did Well  

“We opened before Christmas  
and did really well. There were  
workshops taught by co-op  
craftspeople in the part of the  
store that is now the Denver  
Free University’s coffeehouse.  
Then came the after Christmas  
sales slump and some people left  
when their work didn’t sell.  

Meanwhile we learned that too  

many open doors and too many  
people wandering in and out led  
to thievery which, along with  
our lack of business experience,  
put us into debt. Our organiza-  
tion was too loose.  

The Brass Plum then began to  
change from a counter-culture  
fling to a stable co-operative  
venture. Members learned that  
there is seldom instant return on  
their work, that being in a co-op  
means accepting responsibility  
not only for yourself but for the  
entire structure also through  
cooperation with each other.  
“The co-op lets each of us forget  
100% of the hassles of owning a  
store individually because we're  
all in this together and we  
support each other,” according  
to Annie.  

Having the opportunity  
to meet people who buy your work  
is another advantage of the  
co-op. The artist doesn’t have to  
deal with high consignment  
rip-offs that push up prices and  
discourage sales. In a co-  
operative business the money  
exchanged for work is much  
closer to the true value of that  
work than in a profit-seeking  
business due to the absence of  
the middleperson and their in-  
come.  

Co-ops Respected  

People respect co-ops. A man  
stole a candle from the Brass  
Plum but brought it back with a  
quarter and an apology when he  
found out that he had ripped off  
a co-operative business.  

The expenses of the co-op  
such as rent and utilities are paid  
by monthly dues and new  
membership fees. If any money  
is left over it is used for  

advertising, something that  
Bette Warren, a dressmaker in  
the Brass Plum Co-op, thinks is  
sorely needed. “No one knows  
we're here. In the past we  
haven’t done as much adver-  
tising as we would have liked to.  
We hope that the Street Fair this  
spring when the Folklore Center  
moves up to 17th and Park,  
right across from our store, will  
help us become more visible to  
the community.”  

The co-op holds bi-monthly  
meetings at which business deci-  
sions are discussed and decided  
through consensus or vote.  
Every three months a new  
chairperson of meetings, secre-  
tary, treasurer, custodian, and  
advertiser are chosen. This way  
each member experiences every  
aspect of the co-operative busi-  
ness structure. Nobody wants to  
be the leader and nobody can  
become a controller. There is no  
need for a boss because cooper-  
ation tends to level the heights  
that people tend to rely on for  
survival.  

Members help each other out,  
according to Jim Bednar a  
potter from Castle Clay Co-op.  
“When I started to sell things I  
wasn’t very confident. People at  
the shop were friendly and  
encouraging and now I make a  
significant part of my income  
through my craft.”  

Open for Change  

Even though the co-op is  
always open for changes and  
suggestions, it has basic written  
rules that are adhered to because  
it's “‘too messy without rules,’”  
insists Annie. Being the store-  
keeper twice monthly is such a  
rule. Working two days a month  
in the shop is not as inflexible as  
it may seem. Members can work  
half days and Saturdays if they  
have other jobs and can even  
make arrangements with friends  
to work in the store for them.  
Co-op members can trade off  
days for long periods of time so  
that a member can go on long  
trips. Deals can be made as long  
as the work rule is obeyed.  

As for the future Annie says  
that the co-op ‘‘takes it as it  
comes. The reason we’re here is  
that this is the logical way to go  
about doing something you  
want to do while being in an  
atmosphere with other crafts-  
people and artists.”  

There is no distinction within  
the co-op between the ten women  
members and the three men  
members. Collective action  

keeps the store going, not sexist  

stereotyping.  

When asked if she experi-  
enced problems at the Brass  
Plum because of her sex, Annie  
replies, ‘‘In the co-op, no. In  
life, yes.”  

Different Position  

The position of a woman in  
any profit-motivated business is  
radically different from her  
position in a co-operative busi-  
ness. In the former she must  

have credentials—material and  
emotional, social and psycho-  
logical—that are indispensable  
parts of getting a job. Her life  
becomes fragmented and is split  
into the behavioral expectations  
of the boss and the customer  
and the secretary and the  
accountant. Individuality is ana-  
thema in this type of economic  
structure. Going home from  
work temporarily dulls the alien-  
ation but only change creates  
permanent relief that especially  
affects a woman who is in the  
double locked jail of capitalist  
sexism.  

In the latter each member has  
specific responsibilities in the  
co-operative store. Duties are  
cycled so that the absence of  
any co-op member cannot  
inhibit the operation of the  
entire co-op. The possible lack  
of experience that a woman (or  
anyone) may bring to the co-op  
is unimportant. Everyone learns  
and changes and hopefully  
grows thus creating growth in  
the structure and function of  
the co-operative. A woman who  
works in a co-op isn’t seen as  
being any different from any  
other woman because she isn’t  
any different.  

Theory Shattered  

She shatters the “unique-  
woman-pulls-herself-out-of-  

the-baby-bottle-ghetto-theory,”  
which, like its racist counter-  
part, keeps the oppressive laws  
and practices alive and denies  
women their rights but most of  
all life.  

Some of the work on sale at  
the Brass Plum Co-op includes  
photography, pottery, jewelry,  
plants, clothing for infants to  
adults, candles, toys. The store  
accepts merchandise on consign-  

ment from people who do not  
wish to become members of the  
co-op. Their consignment per-  
centage is the lowest in town.  
Anyone who may want to sell  
their work at the Brass Plum  
should bring a sample to a  
general meeting held on the  
second and fourth Wednesdays  
of every month at 5 in the  
evening at the store.  

If you want to become a  
member of the co-op you  
needn't worry about elitism and  
hidden power structures. This  
co-op functions on an equali-  
tarian basis. This co-op denies  
shiny, slick, chic stores addition-  

al income from high consign-  
ment image peddling. It destroys  
the parasitic relationship be-  
tween sellers and buyers and  
producers, insures the buyer  
high quality work and fine craft  
work at half the price, and  
dilutes the fragmentation and  
mystery of the artist's life.
