dies Assoc. (Ohio, 1983), an
ad-hoc coalition of Women of
Color/Third World women, stu-
dents, white poor and work-
ing class women, lesbians,
Jewish women and women with
disabilities, was formed.

A resolution was passed to
create an "Autonomous Insti-
tute” within the June 1984

at Douglass College, New

tute would be responsible
for organizing a portion of
the program highlighting the
issues which have been ina-
dequately represented in
past conferences and which
reflect the concerns addressed
by the ad-hoc coalition.
If you are interested in
facilitating a workshop,
organizing a panel, present-
