California Rape Law  

December 15, Major legisla-  
tion intended to make California  
one of the nation’s most  
progressive states in the court-  
room treatment of rape victims  
will become law January 1. The  
laws, which restrict em-  
barrassing testimony about the  
rape victim's prior sexual en-  
counters, already have served as  
models for similar legislation  
enacted in three states and  
considered in 17 others. But  
even with this law, some law-  
makers and lawyers agree that  
more legislation is needed to  
further protect the victim during  
trial. They insist the most impor-  
tant change must be the accep-  
tance by the public of rape as “a  
crime of violence and not of  
sex." Now rape victims will  
know they can come forward  
and receive a degree of protec-  
tion from humiliation,” said Sen.  
Alan Robins (D-Van Nuys),  
author of the key bill. Other  
measures, authored by  
Assemblyman Alan Sieroty (D-  
Los Angeles), will prohibit prior  
sexual conduct from being con-  
sidered in judging the credibility  
of a victim. Additionally, she will  
not be required to pay a fee for  
her hospital examination.  

Socialist-Feminist  
Conference:  

The socialist-feminist con-  
ference scheduled for July 4, 5,  
and 6 at Antioch College in  
Yellow Springs, Ohio will center  
communication on major ques-  
tions of theory, strategy and  
practice among socialist-  
feminists and activist women.  
The conference will be working  
within collective workshops  
concerning: workplace organiz-  
ing, community organizing and  
building a socialist-feminist  
movement. For more informa-  
tion contact: Socialist-Feminist  
Group, 1309 N. Main St.,  
Dayton, Ohio 45405.  

Woman Cub Kicked Out of  
Pack  

Twenty-one cub scouts in  
Jessup, Maryland were kicked  
out of the national scouting  
organization because their pack  
leader was a woman.  

Pack 471 was disenfran-  
chised in March because cub  
scout bylaws require pack  
leaders to be men, said a  
spokesman for the Boy Scouts of  
America.  

“This policy of having men in  
leadership roles is based on  
many studies,” he said, defen-  
ding the decision. “A strong  
male presence is required as  
cubmaster.”  

WOMEN MUSICIANS come out —  
women installers bringing suit  
against Mountain Bell need  
musicians to play at their benefit at  
the Oxford Hotel on June 8. Groups  
or individuals, any style, contact  
Yvonne Stith at 333-2176 after 6  
any evening.

Feminist Radio Network  

The Feminist Radio Network is  
a feminist collective that  
produces women’s program-  
ming for an FM educational  
station, WGTB, 90.1 in  
Washington, D.C., under the  
name of Radio Free Women, Inc.  

Although the group’s work  
has provided them with the  
technical training needed to  
produce quality radio program-  
ming, and to allow feminists to  
gain access to mass media, they  
have encountered the usual  
difficulties in such ventures:  
great efforts expended for  
limited political, and no financial  
rewards. They find themselves  
unable, for lack of time, to work  
with other feminists in radio to  
share the skills and resources  
they have acquired.  

Believing that feminist media  
must coordinate and become  
financially self-supporting, they  
have formed a tape distribution  
company, the Feminist Radio  
Network, a non-profit, tax-  
exempt corporation, located in  
Washington, D.C. They will  
distribute tapes produced by  
Radio Free Women, affiliated  
feminist production groups, and  
individual women producers  
throughout the country. The  
proceeds from each tape sold  
will be divided between the produc-  
tion source and the Network.  

The Feminist Radio Network is  
presently working on its first  
national mailing to radio stations  
and educational institutions.  
Because of expenses created by  
this mailing and by the general  
operation of the Feminist Radio  
Network, they are seeking con-  
tributions to assist them in  
continuing their work until sales  

mailing contributions should be sent to:  
Feminist Radio Network, P.O.  
Box 5537, Washington, D.C.  
20016.

Prosecutor Ignored:  
“Just A Woman”  

Jill Voliner, the assistant  
special prosecutor in the  
Watergate case, says that some  
of the Watergate defendants  
didn't take her seriously early in  
the investigation simply because  
she was a woman.  

“The first time I met with Jeb  
Magruder and his lawyer,” said  
Voliner, “they assumed I was a  
secretary. When a male assis-  
tant prosecutor asked them if  
they wanted some coffee,  
Magruder immediately turned to  
me and said, ‘I'll take mine  
black.’” Later Magruder com-  
pounded his error in the court-  
room by answering Voliner’s  
cross-examination questions  
“yes sir” and “no sir.”
