Colorado Springs Pro-Choice Rally

A baby is born.

7. The Catholic Church has
not always held abortion to
be wrong. Until the begin-
ning of the 19th century, it
was considered acceptable to
abort until "quickening," the
first independent movement
of the baby.

8. Legal abortion is eight
times safer than full term
delivery.

9. As for illegal abort-
ions, in 1960, when abortion
was illegal in almost all
cases, one half of all pat-
ients in obstetric wards
across the country were wom-
en suffering from the effects
of illegal abortions.

These statistics are good
for arguments with anti-ab-
ortion people or those who
haven't made up their minds.
They are good for making the
reality of oppression we feel
concrete. But it must be re-
cognized that the issue of
reproductive rights is one
of power—women have the right
to control our own bodies.

If the statistics were dif-
ferent or less dramatic or
horrible, if illegal abort-
ion or forced childbirth became
safer, we would STILL have
the right to control our own
bodies and would fight for
this right.

The main strategy pushed at
this rally to combat anti-
abortion forces was that of
writing, calling, and person-
al visits to local, state and
national lawmakers. That le-
gislative lobbying CAN BE an
effective tactic as a hold-
ing action is demonstrated
by recent Colorado exper-
ience; Senate bills 1550 and
1551, modeled after the in-
famous U.S. Senate Human
Life Amendment, were being
considered by the Colorado
House Judiciary Committee.
What happened, according to
a Rocky Mountain News article
(March 20, 1981) is that
"Kathy Speltz, chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee
called a vote on House Bills
1550 and 1551 because com-
mittee members were inundat-
ed with phone calls, letters
and telegrams...overwhelming-
ly opposed to both bills."
1550 and 1551 were killed in
Committee, by this vote.
Some legislators still pay
attention also to public
opinion polls and polls show
that 83% of Americans are
pro-choice—that is, they be-

lieve that abortion should
be legal in some or all cas-
es. (Dresher-Tortorello Poll
August, 1979) In an NBC-
Associated Press poll of
Sept. 1979, 53% of Catholics
and non-Catholics agreed
with this statement; "Every
woman who wants an abortion
should be able to have one."

has up-to-date information
on bills, and where legisl-
ators stand, and how to
contact them.

Legislative lobbying was
the main, but not the only
tactic pushed at the rally.
Others were: demonstrations,
talking with neighbors and
co-workers, speak-outs, pres-
sure on news media, work
in the public schools.

Analysis

The cost to women of illeg-
al abortions and forced
childbirth are high—death,
illness, poverty, child abuse,
humiliation and disgrace, to
name a few. Poor women, wo-
men of color, women over 30
and teenagers run the great-
est risks from putting a
fetus' life ahead of a wom-
an's. The anti-choice forces
are well financed and well
organized. We are less finan-
ced and less organized. It
is discouraging to be fight-
ing the same battle we thou-
ght we won in 1973 with the
Supreme Court decision mak-
ing abortion a private mat-
ter between a woman and her
doctor. There are reasons
that we are having to fight
this battle again which we
will go into.

While letter writing and
petitioning to Congress,
governors, legislators and
the like may be effective at
certain times and is one
necessary step in demanding
our rights, we must remember
it is only one avenue—and a
limited one at that. Other
areas of action that we must
appropriate are zap actions,
People's tribunals, fundrais-
ing, research, and direct
action of all kinds. One
long-term abortion rights
activist believes that mid-
dle-class women should now
be fundraising to pay for
abortions for poorer women.
Others believe that we must

begin to improve techniques
of underground (illegal,
homemade) abortions to make
them as safe as possible and
that we should form the net-
works now that will be under-
ground later.

The advantages of a single-
issue campaign are:

1. Focus. Politics are sim-
ple; a woman's right to
choose vs. men choosing for
her. There aren't the frustra-
tions, bewildering tangle of
complex factors which we deal
with in trying to form a
strategy for reproductive
rights in the broad sense.

2. Because work is focused
actions are more focused,
have more visible impact,
and so the morale of pro-
choice activists is higher.

Single-issue campaigns are
necessary for the above rea-
sons. We have to be doing
something concrete. Now, or
sink into a fog of helpless
despair. We have to feel our
efforts are effective.

Single-issue campaigns have
disadvantages. The disadvan-
tages are; narrowness of
scope, class and race tunnel
vision (only the interests
and issues central to the
people active in the movement
are acted on); which in turn
leads to tactical errors that
defeat the purpose in the
long run. For example, before
1973, there was a broad, pop-
ular movement for abortion
law reform. Free abortion on
demand was the most radical
slogan. Instead of Free
Abortion on Demand, women
got a Supreme Court decision
making it a "private matter
between a woman and her
doctor." Most of the pro-
choice movement dissipated
with this limited victory,
and in the years since, lit-
tle by little, Medicaid funds
for abortion were cut in
various states. According to
the book, Women Under Attack,
98.1% of women on Medicaid
were not able to get abor-
tions, in states which decid-
ed to cut these funds. But
only lately, when the right
wing religious forces stand
a very good chance of making
abortion unavailable to
everyone, are the pro-choice
forces picking up people,
money, energy. When middle
class women's reproductive
rights were threatened, then
we got moving. Our point is
that this is a tactical mis-
take—we are moving too late.

from page 7

We were not solid as women—
we allowed ourselves to be
divided by class, and now we
are desperately trying to
hold our ground.

A wider definition of re-
productive rights to fight
for would have included the
Native American and Puerto
Rican and other minority wo-
men's demand for "No Forced
Sterilization," which by the
way, is not happening as
much on the reservation, ac-
cording to one Native woman,
because of the fight femin-
ists and Native rights groups
put up. There is still a fin-
ancial incentive to be steri-
lized for poor women—Medi-
caid pays 90% of the cost
for sterilization, but none
for abortion.

A wider definition of re-
productive rights now must
include; No forced steriliza-
tion—including being ster-
ilized to hold or keep a job
or as a result of a job. No
uranium mining and milling,
which right now is resulting
in 1 out of 3 babies born on
the Pine Ridge Reservation
being born deformed, dead,
miscarried, or with a physi-
cal or mental genetic defect
which shows up later.

A wider definition of re-
productive rights would
take a world view that pro-
tests marketing of dangerous
birth control drugs like
Depo Provera here AND will
not tolerate the export of
these drugs to Peru, India,
Mexico.

I don't know if it is any
longer possible to have a
multi-racial pro-choice move-
ment including women of all
class backgrounds. The pro-
choice movement is now
fighting mainly for the
right to abortion for middle-
income women. Poor and mino-
rity women already lost when
Medicaid funding was defeat-
ed. The whiteness of the
pro-choice rally in Colo.
Springs is not a specific
accusation of racism against
the organizers—it is common
to most women's events.

Maybe if we begin to match
our theory with practice,
form our theory from prac-
tice, we will begin to organ-
ize with, and listen to, the
concerns of poor women, and
women of color. Maybe we can
be flexible, use all kinds
of tactics, and snatch vic-
tory from the jaws of defeat.
Our freedom is worth a try.
