The Notebooks That Emma Gave Me  
is a special book - special because  
it is exactly what the title states:  
The Autobiography of a Lesbian. It  
is also a testament to a healthy,  
strong woman; and for that reason,  
a review of Notebooks deserves in-  
clusion in an issue on health.

How long ago was it that I wrote  
the last time? It was 15 years ago.  
I walked 16 blocks down the beach,  
to the subway, to Queens Hospital.  
I saw snow on the beach. It was be-  
fore the children. It was long ago  
when I still lived in the old cul-  
ture, on the outskirts of it.

I wore a black dress or a tweed  
skirt. I thought about artichoke  
plates and the perfect silver pot.

I travelled with the survivors of  
Hiroshima, went to a bar for dancing  
on the bar at the Schaeffer Pavil-  
ion, studied and taught non-violence -- how to let a war go on for  
ten years. With squatter villagers,  
built a town. Planted gardens, haul-  
ed manure, found mulch and put it  
on. Organized tenants, worked in a  
hospital, sold worthless stuff on  
Times Square, drove a taxi, typed  
at Time-Life, went to college, made  
a lot of dynamite things out of sil-  
ver. That's how long 15 years is.  
From age 35 until about age 50, I  

examining Sexism in Books

did not write. And everything I did  
before that I destroyed.

The decision not to destroy what  
one writes is perhaps the most ba-  
sic means of self-affirmation, and  
to write one's life and feelings is  
an act of courage. At the beginning  
of Notebooks, Van Deurs seems almost  
oblivious to the form of her book -  
she is keeping a journal (a memory  
journal initially) and using letters  
to reconstruct her past. Yet, some-  
where in the course of journal  
keeping, Van Deurs realizes that  
not only does she want to share her  
life and her writing with other  
women, but that she has chosen a  
form threatening to traditional,  
and even non-traditional press.

from a letter to Daughters Press:  
«..I used to write novels, but no  
longer...

The novel was the form for some  
other time when a woman like Vir-  
ginia Woolf could not say what she  
felt -- had to write novels. What  
you meant -- what you felt -- your  
life -- had to be twisted, hidden,  
disguised and heaped up into some-  
thing called The Plot of a novel.  
Virginia threw out the plot. I throw  
out the novel. I have nothing to  
give but my life -- everything that  
has ever happened as I know it. I  
believe I'll just keep writing it  
down. I hope the other women in  
this world keep doing the same be-  
cause I sure would like to read what  
they're writing.

When her manuscript was returned  
unread by several publishers (in-  
cluding Daughters), Van Deurs decided  
to produce the book on her own. I am

I’ll note that this is called "vanity  
press", and in a way, I see how that  
term applies here. Notebooks is a  
piece of self-indulgence. Never to  
be considered GREAT LITERATURE, it  
will exist as one woman's legacy,  

a gift to be passed to future  
feminists, because it is self-cen-  
tered. We have all been in spaces  

in our lives where there is no one  
to do something nice for us - so  

we learn to do what we want for our-  

selves. Basic self-affirmation again,  

the foundation of mental health.

from a letter to friends:

Thanks for the money you sent - the  
$500 loan. I cannot pay it back be-  
cause I haven't got any. I need some  
more...Please, if you can, help me  
because I do not want to stop wri-  
ting now.

On some crazy level, that's what I  
want to say. But of course, I can't  
say that. I must say (because prob-  
ably my book wouldn't be any good  
and would be a waste of money -- and  
yet I know it won't and I know --  
how do I know?)...And I am writing  
it, and while I am writing it I need  
you to pay the rent. Because it's  
the right form for me and the wrong  
form for Daughters.

Probably the strongest point of  
Van Deurs' work is her honest style.  
A woman with the courage of her  
feelings, she is consistently true  
to herself - no false bravado, but  
no crippling fears either. Through-  
out the book, we see her as a person  
who reaches for what she wants, and  

has some amazing experiences in doing  

so. She lives like she writes: sim-  
ply, sincerely, and fully. In many  

ways, she creates a new "dyke  
legend" of a tough, self-made woman  
who preserves her sense of humor  
and love of people. Most of all,  
she feels, and takes her strength  
from those feelings.

In one section of Notebooks, Van  
Deurs talks about monogamy. Faced  
with losing her lover if she does  
not share her, the author realizes  
that she is really dealing with  
her own doubts. Could it be that  
there is something wrong with our  
expectation and longing for love  
that lasts forever? If it doesn't  
last forever we feel that there is  
something wrong with it - something  
wrong with us - that we have failed.  
Her discourse avoids popular politi-  
cal diatribe because she speaks from  
the experience of her own feelings.  
Furthermore, Van Deurs truly loves  
the other women in her life; and so  
when she defines monogamy as emo-  
tional confinement, we sense  
her commitment to personal freedom  
for herself and for her friends.

What Kay Van Deurs has to say to  
us is not new, but the way she says  
it is refreshing, and somehow more  
credible than anything that passes  
as politically correct. She is  
wonderfully strong and healthy -  

a woman to listen to when we need  
to feel good about ourselves.

-.. Last week, in Michigan, at the  
Women's Music Festival, young women  
kept coming up to me and saying, "Do  
you mind if I take your picture?"

I said, "I'd love it." They said,  
"You are so beautiful.” "Yes, I  
know." And I do know.

(2) BEING A GOOD POET

Using this criteria which Chocolate

a good poet. She will touch and move  
you with each poem.

BROKEN

Chocolate Waters, a Denver-based  
poet, has titled her latest book,  
Take Me Like A Photograph and her  
poems have photographic quality, vivid  
reflections without abstraction or  
distortion of reality. Her relation-  
ships and experiences are written  
with little use of metaphor.

While some poets write only love  
poems, Chocolate writes of all exper-  
iences shared by women. Anger, Broken,  
Everyone's Writing About Their Grand-  
mothers These Days, My Father, We're  
All Allowed To Have One Hokey Thing  
About Us and Those Destructive Male  
Fantasies Again are a few titles that  
give an idea of her diversity. It is  
in these poems, more so than her poem  
on relationships, that her womanlove  
comes out.
