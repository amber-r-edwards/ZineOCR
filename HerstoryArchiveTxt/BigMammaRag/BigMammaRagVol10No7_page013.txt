Jicamarca: Who Are The Real Terrorists?

(This article was edited
for length, from a longer
story appearing in Peru Up-
date, a publication of Peru
Solidarity.)

Eva Altez is calm and mea-
sured as she tells us her
story, but her face reveals a
sense of rage. She exudes a
strength, born of many years

of struggle. Eva and four com-
panions from the peasant com-
munity of JICAMARCA, ten kil-
ometers outside of Lima, have
come to tell a group of church
people why police attacked
their community on Feb. 10.
We had been discussing "Human
Rights in Peru," but nothing
summed up the situation so
eloquently as the testimony
of the "companeros."

"Ours is the third largest
peasant community in Peru,”
Joaquin began. “Its rich his-
tory dates back to the 14th
century when it covered a
large part of what, today, is
Lima. Now our land includes
100,000 hectares (1 hectare=
2.5 acres). The Peruvian Con-
stitution guarantees the exis-
tence of peasant communities,
our communal system of self-
government, and our century-
old land claims. We were giv-
en title to our land in 1929.
We plant beans, sweet pota-
toes and other vegetables for
our homes and for market."

"But what has happened?",
Eva speaks up. "A former ha-
cienda took 2,000 hectares of
communal land from us, and
later sold it to urban hous-
ing developers. Since we are
so close to Lima, our farm-
land is a prime target for
contractors and real estate
developers. The land was di-
vided into lots. When they be-
gan to sell the lots, we occu-
pied it and immediately began
to plant. We have title to
the land, but the businessmen
have friends in high places.
In 1976 our president was ar-
rested and labeled 'subver-
sive'. In 1978, eight leaders
were arrested and accused of
invading their own land."

Eva is enthusiastic as she
begins to talk of the progress
made in their area of Jicamar-
ca, one of eleven sectors.

"We have done a lot to improve
the community," she says. "We
got funding from a Dutch agen-

cy to build an irrigation sys-
tem. With the active partici-
pation of 100 women, carrying
dirt and digging ditches, we

have built a system to irri-

gate 85 hectares. We just in-
augurated a new electric pump
in November. We have an educa-
tional center, the Lima Insti-
tute for Research and Agrarian
Promotion (INPAL), which pro-

vides technical assistance to

the community. Before, our
children studied in a building
of stacked adobe--but thanks
to the assistance we've recei-
ved, we've constructed a
school. We have also begun a
communal area to raise gui-
nea pigs." (a staple in the
Peruvian diet).

"A land speculator bought
the land in dispute, and sued
the community to take posses-
sion. Supported by sympathetic
judges, he won the case in an
unprecedented 15 days. The
Agrarian Tribunal neglected
to notify the community, at-
tempting to deny us the right
to appeal. We managed to ap-
peal and the case has been in
litigation, but we have been
under constant pressure by
five separate Ministries to
drop the case."

On Feb. 10, 2 small tanks,

8 paddy wagons and over 300
special troops raided the com-
munity armed with machine guns,
knives and tear gas. "It was
incredible," Eva says, as if
they'd come to fight a war
with a defenseless community."

An Italian agronomist work-
ing there was brutally beaten
with the butt of a gun and
accused of being a foreign
agitator.

The police raided homes and
stores, forcing people against
the walls and beating them.
They destroyed the Institute,
taking mimeographs, project-
ors, typewriters, files, rad-
ios, money for the payroll
and two small trucks. The new
irrigation pump was broken.

"They even took the bell, the
only means of calling the peo-
ple together. What a futile
way to try to break the unity
of the people," exclaimed a
local priest.

"They totally destroyed my
home," Eva says with indigna-
tion. She and her husband,
Pastor Anaya, both work at the
Institute, which he directs.
They are leaders who have
been instrumental in improving
the community. Neither were
at home during the attack.
"The police struck my children
when they refused to tell
where we were. They took ev-
erything! Pots and pans--even
the mattress! They came with
the cameras and went right to
a corner, without a search,
where they found a gun."

Anaya has been arrested as the
“ring leader of a terrorist
band." Eva claims that the
gun was planted, as a manu-
script was planted in another
(the Matayoshi) case.

Eva, her husband and eight
others were arrested and in-
terrogated by intelligence po-
lice. She later confided her
tremendous fear as she was
taken away, and her attempt to
keep total calm—not to react
with hysteria and screams,
which would give them an ex-
cuse to hit her. This confused
the police and made them angry
but protected her.

The group was brought be-
fore TV and press, and presen-
ted as a "terrorist band."
They were photographed in
front of a mimeograph, a mo-
vie, dollars, a gun and other

items--the “subversive mater-
ial" offered as proof of their
activities. A pair of muddy
army boots were even offered
as evidence of a "guerilla
training camp." Yet they were
not allowed to speak in their
own defense. The following
day their pictures were plas-
tered across the front pages
under the headline "TERROR-
ISTS CAPTURED." As Eva talks
she pulls out her collection
of clips to show us.

The only woman prisoner,

Eva was freed a day later.
She joined others in mounting
an active campaign to denounce
the frame-up and police abuse.
Yet as she made the rounds

of police offices, she found
that no official would admit
who gave the order to send in
the tanks. The frame-up was
so blatant and the violence
so reprehensible that police
were admitting they had no
case.

"They may dismiss the case
but the damage has already
been done," Eva says with
concern. "In our community, a
child dies on the average of
every two weeks in the summer
months, because of health
conditions and malnutrition.
Our biggest problem is the
water. There is still so much
to do. But, our main concern
now is that, with the accusa-
tion “terrorists” over our
heads we'll never be able to
rebuild. Who will want to
help us?"

"I want to clear up this
incident not only for our
community, but to put an end
to the false accusations of
terrorism in general. This is
for the peasants of Ayacucho
who have suffered much more
than we have, and for Matayo-
shi who has also been malign-
ed."

As we go to press, all but
one prisoner has been freed,

Eva's husband, Pastor Anaya.
His status was changed to
that of "definitive detention”
to “complete investigations,"
under charges of terrorism.
The land dispute is unresolved.
Powerful interests, backed by
certain government officials
want rights to the land. One
Senator of the APRA party has
even requested to “dissolve
the community” in open viola-
tion of the Constitution. The
developers refer to Jicamarca
as a “pseudo peasant communi-
ty" and are demanding "govern-
ment protection" to retake
the land. Meanwhile, the com-
munity has yet to be reimbur-
sed for thousands of dollars
in damages.
