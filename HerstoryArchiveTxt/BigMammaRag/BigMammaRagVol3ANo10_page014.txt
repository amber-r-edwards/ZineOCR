Rape  
From Page 1  
says a universal problem with  
police is they don’t live in the  
neighborhood, they don't know  
their way around and they aren't  
as responsive as they might be  
if it was their own neighborhood  
that was being threatened. In an  
effort to stimulate rapport with  
the beats, they invited them to  
attend their volunteer training  
sessions, but apparently the  
police were derisive to a point  
where Nagaris felt they were a  
disruptive influence on the  
volunteers, and they were  
dropped from the sessions. High  
Street has other programs in-  
volving police/community  
relations, and Nagaris also is  
developing another rape training  
program which would involve  
the police.  
Hospital Treatment  
The first person a victim is  
likely to see after a rape, after  
she’s called the cops, is the beat  
cop. So it is essential these  
policemen be sensitized to the  
needs of the victim. After some  
preliminary questioning, the  
policeman takes the victim to  
Denver General Hospital for  
medical tests and treatment. DG  
is the only hospital in the city  
with a rape kit, equipment  
designed for testing sperm,  
pubic hair, etc. Clarence Briscoe,  
Director of High Street Com-  
munity Center is seeking to get  
the kit into other hospitals to  
accommodate victims who have a  
preference for other hospitals.  
All victims are taken to Denver  
General because cops don't  
want to be hassled with driving  
all over the city, and because  
only DG (with the rape kit) is  
better equipped to provide the  
victim with the corroborating  
evidence crucial to her case.  
Nicole Sperekas, psychologist at  
Gilpin House, believes that  
“scattering victims to various  
hospitals may weaken the  
legislative process in terms of  
getting effective testimony from  
doctors." It doesn’t give them  
the opportunity to build up  
expertise in rape cases, she said.  
Prior to August 1974 Evans  
and Sperekas say that “victims  
in the Emergency Room at DG  
faced a 1 to 4 hour wait, often  
without relatives. In addition,  
they sometimes endured an  
added nightmare of a succession  

of men interrogating them, and

going to educate defense at-  
torneys? If our faculty is going to  
be representative of a pluralistic  
society, we are going to have to  
hire blacks who identify with the  
black community, chicanos who  
identify with the chicano com-  
munity, women-identified-  
women, working class people  
who identify with the poor, and  
people with different (that is to  
say, left) political views...  

Women Students Stifled  

“We must have women  
teachers because more than  
one-third of the students at this  
school are women. Never  
assume that it is easy to live and  
study in an atmosphere of per-  
vasive male supremacy. All of us  
have, at one time or another, felt  
like Madame de Stael’s heroine  
in Delphine: ‘I soon noticed that  
the feelings I expressed were  
turned into jests, and that my  
intelligence was silenced, as if it  
were improper for a woman to  
have any. Thus, I locked up in  
myself everything I felt. I early  
acquired the art of dissembling  
and I stifled my natural sensibili-  
ty.”  
“Never assume that it is easy  
to hold back our anger, when a  
dean says to us with casual  
hubris, ‘We will probably hire a  
woman this year.’ A woman! I  
saw one sign this morning  
which said “51 percent.” That,  
of course, is the unspoken  
demand, the ultimate demand,  
the only equitable demand —  
parity for women.  

“Most of us are here, directly  
or indirectly, because of the  
women’s movement. The  

having to tell their story over and  
over.” They implemented a  
volunteer-companion program  
for the ER. A trained volunteer  
remains with the victim to be  
generally supportive, to explain  
about tests she will undergo.  
They give her a follow-up sheet  
which is a list of services  
available to the victim, and also  
inform her that a nurse will  
contact her within 72 hours.  
Sperekas says it took fully 8  
months to get the program  
implemented largely because  
doctors balked at the idea of  
having “one more extraneous  
body to add to the chaos of this  
life and death room.” Other local  
hospitals have since instituted  
similar volunteer/companion  
programs for rape victims.  

The volunteer/companion is  
in ER only on weekend evenings  
between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.  
when statistically the largest  
incidences of rapes occur. (Ann  
Caldwell, a supporter of rape  
crisis programs, says that one of  
the drawbacks to being raped on  
weekends is that the morning  
after pill which the doctors  
prescribe can’t be gotten until  
Monday morning when the  
pharmacy opens.) This ER  
volunteer program Sperekas  
believes was instrumental in  
sensitizing gyn residents to the  
problem of rape. Whereas before  
their treatment of the patient  
had been abrupt, or hurried, now  
they are more responsive to the  
victim. The victim becomes a  
patient of DG who claims full  
responsibility and authority for  
the patient. The problem with  
this system, as Driscoe sees it, is  
that if a woman feels she is not  
getting proper treatment from  
DG or the police and complains  
to another crisis center about it,  
that crisis center will feel  
obligated to support the woman,  
but their redemptive efforts may  
not be effectual because they  
are encroaching someone else's  
territory.  

For example, a recent rape  
victim was taken to DG for treat-  
ment, and was apparently heavi-  
ly intoxicated or drugged and  
being very belligerent. The  
volunteer in ER left her, and the  
police didn’t provide her with a  
ride home. Friends of the victim  
implored High Street for protec-  
tion or support, but High Street,  

number of women enrolled in  
law school has increased from 5  
percent in 1967 to 15.6 percent  
in 1972 without significant  
recruitment effort on the part of  
law schools. Our very presence  
here is a challenge to a sexist  
institution. Academically and  
politically, we have had a dis-  
proportionate influence.  
Women, along with the  
minorities, are the political ac-  
tivists in this school... it was  
women who initiated this picket  
line.  

“It will be women, in-  
creasingly active women,  
increasingly politicized women,  
increasingly radicalized women,  
who will continue to attack the  
racist and sexist institutions in  
this society, who will follow  
through on this action, who will  
eventually bring suit against the  
school... who will organize the  
next picket line.”  

Veronica Vigil Follow-Up  

Veronica Vigil, local Chicana  
activist, (see Sept. issue BMR) is  
still being held in jail. The  
reasons for continuing to detain  
Ms. Vigil are included in a 23  
page court document. The docu-  
ment can be found in the library  
of the Court Appeals in the  
Federal Court building. The  
Court opinion is dated October 2,  
1975. Permission for rehearing  
has been granted and is being  
held during the week of October.  

Ms. Vigil is permitted only one  
visitor per day. If you wish to visit  
her call the jail before you go.  

although issuing a complaint to  
the authorities involved, was  
restricted because the victim  
was out of their jurisdiction. The  
result was that a lot of bad vibes  
went down and for a time made  
the rapport between the  
hospital, the cops, the crisis  
centers, and the victim, a little  
less tenable. As Evans said,  
“There are a lot of territoriality  
concerns.” Driscoe feels this un-  
necessarily subjects the victim  
to a lot of political ricocheting.  
Occurrence  

Rapes in Denver occur mostly  
in northeast Denver and on  
Capitol Hill where there are a lot  
of single women. The victims  
approximate the racial makeup  
of the city (71% Anglo, 15%  
Black, 11% Chicano) and half are  
between 16 and 34 years old. If  
you get raped, chances are it will  
be in your home on Capitol Hill or  
in northeast Denver on a  
summer Saturday morning  
between 1 and 3. Chances are it  
will be someone of your own  
color, and you will be verbally  
threatened with a 50% chance  
that he will have a weapon. But  
chances are you will have war-  
ning of the impending rape. You  
have a chance to escape what is  
to you, at that point, a life-threat-  
ening situation. Officer Don E.  
Lindley, who is writing a  
master’s thesis on rape, says “a  
rapist will generally talk to his  
victim, finding out if she is gonna  
yell and scream like hell. He  
wants to pick somebody that’s  
easy.” Women are too trusting,  
he concludes.  

Services  

There are a number of ser-  
vices available in the Denver  
area which will train women on  
how to cope with the threat of  
rape. The NOW Rape Task Force  
831-7701, the Southeast  
Denver Neighborhood Center,  
227 Clayton 321-8192, The  
Denver Police Department  
Storefronts, High Street Rape  

Crisis Center, 3401 High Street  
571-1265.  

The Denver Police Depart-  
ment Storefronts are offering  
rape prevention classes in  
cooperation with some crisis  
centers. One of these classes  
started October 7 and will run  
through December. It is held on  
Tuesdays from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m.  
at the Central Christian Church,  
3690 S. Cherry Creek Drive and  
is given jointly with Southeast  
Community Services. On Oc-  
tober 20 at High Street Com-  
munity Center another preven-  
tative training session will be  
given jointly with Parkhill Store-  
front. For more information call  
322-4295. These classes have  
lectures, demonstrations, and  
show films which instruct  
women to fortify their home,  
using peepholes, effective locks,  
etc. They give suggestions on  
clothing, the least restrictive for  
running in and fighting in, and  
also what not to wear if you're  
hitchhiking, clothing that won't  
make the men think you  
can't wait to fuck them — but  

there are always men who  
think that, no matter what you’re  
wearing. There are various  
centers serving different areas  
of the city. High Street, privately  
financed, services the north-  
east section of town and South-  

Big Mama Rag Vol. 3-A, No. 11  

east Community the southeast  
section. Denver General has out-  
patient psychiatric clinics in  
each quadrant of the city. These  
clinics offer support and  
counseling for rape victims  
seeking help but many victims  
shun association with a psy-  
chiatric clinic. Because the vic-  
tim must seek help voluntarily,  
the major problem is en-  
couraging the victim to stay in  
contact until she has fully ad-  
justed. Nagaris says normally a  
woman becomes self-effacing  
with time. They don't call  
because they don’t want to  
bother anyone, they don’t want  
to impose. Briscoe feels that  
more women turn to High Street  
for help, apart from the fact High  
Street is in one of the highest  
rape areas, because “we come  
up front with people and don’t  
play political games.” All of  
these centers are interested in  
recruiting more volunteers,  
male and female.  
Offenders  

Law officers, who are  
generally punishment oriented,  
are concerned that stiffer  
penalties are not imposed on  
convicted rapists. According to  
Detective Al Sandoval from the  
Community Relations Bureau,  
only 2% of convicted rapists are  
institutionalized. The remainder  
are put on probation and  
perhaps ordered to seek psy-  
chiatric counseling, both of  
which Sandoval feels are in-  
effective in combating  
recidivism. In the beginning the  
convicted rapist reports in per-  
son every two weeks to his  
probation officer. But because  
probation officers have such a  
high case load, the rapist’s  
contacts with him soon dwindle  
to perhaps a mere phone call  
every 45 days, or so. Psychiatric  
counseling, Sandoval says, is  
also ineffective, initially because  
this help is not voluntarily  
sought, and the psychiatrist,  
who is court appointed, perhaps  
does not approach the case with  
the same enthusiasm he would  
have for a paying client. Lastly,  
the courts don’t have the time or  
the staff to enforce mandatory  
psychiatric counseling.  

Prevention is Oppressive  

Most people believe that an  
effective deterrent against crime  
is preventative measures taken  
by potential victims. We lock our  
doors to our cars and homes, and  
are careful not to flaunt money,  
if we have it, in public places,  
and we avoid taking lone night  
walks. But people living in small  
friendly towns or low crime  
areas who are used to leaving  
doors and windows to their  
homes and cars left open at all  
times would abhor living in  
those areas (practically ever-  
where) where inhabitants, by  
necessity, if they know what's  
good for them, lock their doors.  
‘Country’ people cherish the  
freedom of not having to lock  
their doors and it is a source of  
pride to them. In larger cities and  
other high crime areas, how-  
ever, it is a virtue of the good  
citizen to take necessary  
precautions against potential  
crime: we never, never tempt the  
criminal. This attitude of preven-  
tion is effective as it applies to  
crimes of robbery, burglary, or

Women and Rape  

murder. But when applied to  
potential victims of rape it can be  
oppressive.  

It can be oppressive because  
usually it aims to curb women’s  
social and sexual mobility.  
“Once in a cabinet, ‘Golda Meir  
is quoted as saying in Against  
Rape, ‘we had to deal with the  
fact that there had been an out-  
break of assaults on women at  
night. One minister  
suggested a curfew; women  
should stay home after dark. I  
said, ‘But it’s the men who are  
attacking the women. If there’s  
to be a curfew let the men stay at  
home, not the women.”  

The sexual revolution has  
allowed women the right to  
sexual self-determination. But  
sex, excluding masturbation, is  
not an individual act. It is a  
mutual, human two-way com-  
munication. We maintain our  
autonomy, yet we are responsi-  
ble to one another.  

But when a man still is ex-  
pected to be provider and  
aggressor and protector, when a  
man pays, when a woman defers  
— it’s back to the same old  
pattern of man as keeper of  
woman. And he'll want this fee  
in trade. My friends are raped all  
the time and don’t even know it,  
or perhaps don’t care. They say  
they are sexually liberated; they  
see varieties of men, letting  
them pay, or perhaps expecting  
them to pay, but never with any  
sign of compunction to  
reciprocate. They accept gifts,  
perhaps, and then speak in  
terms of giving in to him or  
letting him do the do. It’s just the  
same old thing over and over  
again. We're just so many holes  
to be bought and brandished and  
kept. We sacrifice our freedom,  
our chance to be a viable part of  
this human community when  
we defer to men simply because  
they are men. When we are  
submissive because it’s the  
feminine role, when we ball  
without the desire or need,  
we're getting raped, and we lose  
a part of our humanity; but so do  
men.  

Women are raped politically,  
economically, socially, sexually,  
and criminally. All of these rapes  
violate women physically,  
emotionally, intellectually. They  
erode our feelings of importance  
and self-worth. But all of these  
rapes leave everyone a little less  
responsive to each other, a little  
less human: they steal from the  
rapist as well. To use Peter  
Marin’s words in a different  
context, author of “The New  
Narcissism, Harpers Oct. 1975),  
“In the name of power men strip  
us of everything real and we  
become nothing more than a  
reflection of their need.”  

What should exist as a  
reciprocal human community is  
split into separate worlds of  
women and men, alienated one  
from the other. The crime of  
rape, prosecutable rape, is a  
violent hint of the great assault  
on women, a savage shadow of  
the absolute world of men.
