Unbound

Kitty Tsui, Nellie Wong,  
and Merle Woo

The former collective  
known as Unbound Feet is em-  
broiled in a political stru-  
ggle. The issues are over  
whether or not Unbound Feet,  

struggle

and what this movement orga-  

nization has meant, will  
continue. Kitty Tsui, Nellie  
Wong, and Merle Woo are con-  
tinuing on with the princi-  
ples and the work that was  
articulated in our original  
Statement of Purpose, main-  
taining that our writing is  
a political act and that po-  
litics and art cannot be di-  
vided. By politics we mean  
multi-issue feminism—fight-  
ing racism, sexism, class  
oppression and heterosexism;  
though we create stories,  
poems, and dramatic pieces  
as part of our work, we must  
take stands as political  
Asian American women.

Today we have a split, not  
over petty issues or person-  
al differences. It is a  
class struggle directly re-  
lated to the communities  
that have supported Unbound  
Feet since its inception.  
Unbound Feet was a movement  
group. Our politics were an  
integral part of our writing,  
and we were an integral part  
of our communities: the  
Third World, the Women's,  
the Gay, and the Left commun-  
ities. For this reason,  
Kitty Tsui, Nellie Wong, and  
Merle Woo are publicizing  
what has happened.

Kitty Tsui, Nellie Wong,  
and Merle Woo are working  
together as Unbound Feet  
Three. Our opposition: Nancy  
Hom, Genny Lim, and Canyon  
Sam—did not want to contin-  
ue as Unbound Feet. They  
have united, not around a  
principled, affirmative pro-  
gram, but with the aim of  
dissolving the group, silen-  
cing us and trying to stop  

Feet II:

we would jeopardize our uni-  
ty in the Asian community.  
But false unity cannot be  
bought at the expense of  
criticism: we were treated  
in a condescending and sex-  
ist way in addition to hav-  
ing the contract reneged on  

by AAS. The opposition re-  
sisted taking a stand on  
this issue. This disagree-  

-Kim Womantree/Big Mama Rag  
ment split the group. They  
red-baited all of us because  
two are socialist feminists,  
accusing us of "party-build-  
ing" and using Unbound Feet  
for our own political ends.

Contrary to our Statement  

of Purpose, art and politics  
for the opposition are sep-  

arate, and Nancy states:  

In these times, I can't af-  
ford to spend a lot of en-  
ergy involved with internal  
group conflicts or with  
fighting within our own co-  
mmunities. In the future we  
can't afford to burn any  
bridges with anybody who  
might be sympathetic to our  
causes. We are going to  
find ourselves with some  
very strange bedfellows be-  
cause we will need every-  
body's help to offset Reag-  
an and the power structure.  
. .As long as Asians and  
women fight in their own  
communities, to me, it is  
not "taking a stand."

Multi-Issue Feminism  

freedom from conflict. There  
are political divisions ba-  
sed on sexism, class bias,  
and ideological differences.  
Being Asian American women  
and feminists precisely  
means that we have no choice  
but to take a stand.

We are now battling over  
the name. Without our know-  
ledge, the opposition used  
over $250 from our joint  
checking account to incor-  
porate themselves. Further-  
more, they took over $2400  
from our joint savings ac-  
count and are holding it  
until we give up the name.  
The name Unbound Feet is  
central to our struggle. It  
symbolizes the freedom we  
seek from our oppression as  
women, as Asian Americans,  
as workers and as lesbians.  
We are feminists who act  
and speak out from a multi-  
issue base. Unbound Feet is  
not a product to be discon-  
tinued but an ongoing poli-  
tical and creative entity  
born from the movements  
that shape and support us.

We publicize the struggle  

America held  

usual.

Two of Raygun's right wings had  
math problems this month. Richard  

Allen took $1,000—No,  
$10,000 (or was it $100,000)  
from the Japanese magazine  

Housewife's Friend. The money  

was a gift (bribe) for an int-  
erview with Nancy, a whitehouse-  
wife and friend of Allen's. Mean-  
while, budget director David Stock-  

man described Raygunomics as "just a bunch of numbers that  
don't really mean anything"—a fact certain to brighten  
the lives of those hit hardest by Raygunomics. After con-  

hostage  

It was a month of last-minute tactics for Raygun. After  
being barred from the AFL-CIO convention because of union  
busting tactics in the PATCO strike, Raygun invited the  
15 million-member union's executive board to the White  

House for a meeting in December—an obvious attempt to  
upstage the convention. Before leaving on a Thanksgiving  
holiday with Nancy, Raygun took time to veto the  
budget bill—temporarily laying off all "non-critical"  
government workers. "Non-critical," by Raygun's definition,  
means working people. George Bush, on the  
other hand, reported to work (?) as  

of Unbound Feet to defend  
our democratic rights, multi-  
issue feminism, and the fre-  
edom to speak out as radi-  
cals. Kitty, Nellie, and  
Merle intend to continue  
working together as Unbound  
Feet Three. To move towards  
freedom we must take stands  
as well as to write and per-  
form our art. We will take  
political stands, particul-  
arly when issues affect us  
as women, as Asian Ameri-  
cans, as lesbians, as radi-  
cals, and as multi-issue  
feminists. In concert with  
the name, Unbound Feet, we  
choose to unbind our feet.  
Our name and organization—  
Unbound Feet Three: Kitty  
Tsui, Nellie Wong, Merle Woo  
—does not confuse the pub-  
lic with the former organi-  
zation of six members; it  
does indicate Unbound Feet  
Three's purpose to continue  
to write, perform, and act  
on the political principles  
to which we are committed.

Suddenly I don’t feel like ice,  

us from using the name.

At our final performance  
as Unbound Feet last Febru-  
ary, we issued a statement  
criticizing our sponsor,  
Asian American Studies at  
University of California,  
Berkeley, for reneging on  
our contract. Since then,  
the opposition has said they  
had not wanted to issue the  
statement because they felt  

confessing that Raygun supply-side economics helps the rich  
and hurts the poor, Stockman was appropriately punished.  
Stockman had his mouth washed out with soap and is not  
allowed to speak to anyone unless Raygun himself puts the  
words in Stockman's mouth.

14 Million Native Americans can expect 60% unemployment  
and the closing of reservation schools and adult education  
programs—all to "balance" Stockman's "bunch of  

day 314—and counting.

Big Mama Rag, December, 1981 - Page 5  

We agree we must offset Rea-  
gan and the power structure,  
but not by selling out what  
we stand for. As feminist  
activists we must speak out  
against injustice in our own  
backyard before we can make  
change in the world. Critic-  
ism is a positive moving  
force. Being Asian American  
alone does not guarantee—
