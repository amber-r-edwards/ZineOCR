Immediately after World War  
2 began people panicked, af-  
raid that Japan would bomb  
the West Coast and suspicious  
that all people of Japanese  
ancestry were spies, and the  

book review  

US government initiated a "re-  
location program".  

This book, originally print-  
ed in 1973, and made into a  
TV special several years ago,  
tells of a Japanese American  
family's imprisonment in a  
concentration camp-USA style.  

The “relocation program" up-  
rooted families and thrust  
110,000 people of Japanese  
ancestry into ten inland con-  
centration camps complete  
with barbed wire, barracks,  
guards, guard towers, guns  
and regulations.  

The program accomplished  
many things: it herded all  
people of Japanese ancestry  

(regardless of where they had  
been born) into places of  
tight government control, it  
kept them isolated from the  
outside world, it allowed  
white Americans the opportun-  
ity to rob the people of  
their homes, businesses,  
farms and family possessions  
at the lowest price possible,  
to provide cheap labor when  
needed and once again the US  
tried to subject a race to  
humiliation and servitude.  

People were placed in camps  
from March 1942 until after  
the end of the war, late  
1945. It wasn't until 1952  
that Congress allowed Japan-  
ese the right to become nat-  
uralized citizens. At no  
time before were Japanese  
allowed to apply for natural-  
ized citizenship. In 1924  
Congress had passed an immi-  
gration act stating that no  
alien ineligible for citizen-  
ship shall be admitted to the  
US, this stopped all legal  
immigration from Japan.  

Early into the war Jeanne  
Wakatsuki Houston's father,  
Wakatsuki Ko, a fisherman,  
was picked by the FBI and  

false charges kept him sep-  
arated from his family for  
over nine months. He and oth-  
er men the FBI picked up were  
sent to a camp in Bismarck,  
N.D. During that time her  
mother, Wakatsuki Riku, had  
to survive and keep the fam-  
ily together, knowing that  
they would eventually be put  
into a camp.  

Manzanar (Sp.-apple orch-  
ard), Owens Valley, CA was  
the first of the concentrat-  
ion camps used and would ev-  
entually hold 10,000 people.  
It was bleak country, more  
desert than anything else and  
the camp was not completed  
when the family arrived. Her  
father eventually joined them  
but the family tempo had been  
damaged by the separation  
and upheavals all had exper-  
ienced. While the families  
tried to carry on and build  
a normal life, living in a  
camp with the restrictions  
that were so alien to the  
people's culture affected  
them all. The horror that  
was Manzanar was not that at  
times it was bloody and hard  
its horror was how effective  
it was in destroying the fab-  
ric of the people's lives and  
abruptly changing the family  
members' relationship to each  
other. My own family, after  
three years of mess hall liv-  
ing, collapsed as an inte-  
grated unit. Whatever dignity  
or feeling of filial strength  
we may have known before Dec-  
ember 1941 was lost, and we  
did not recover it until  
many years after the war, not  
until Papa died and we began  
to come together, trying to  
fill the vacuum his passing  
left in all our lives.  

In 1943 the Loyalty Oath  
was introduced and it was  
much discussed and argued ab-  
out--to prove one's loyalty  
to the US the men had to be  
willing to fight in the war  
(for a country that didn't  
want them) and to swear al-  
legiance to that country.  

All those who wouldn't sign  
were to be sent to another  
camp in California and prob-  
ably shipped to Japan with  
the possibility that families  
would be split up. Young men  
were to be drafted in the  
army-the 110th Battalion and  
the 442nd Regimental Combat  
Team (all Nisei, second gen-  
eration) which was the most  
decorated unit in World War  

2 and had the highest per-  
centages of casualties and  
dead. Another relocation plan  
was introduced--if interned  
people could find a job and  

a sponsor inland, away from  
the West Coast, they could  
leave the camp and work. Many  
men and women did this, some

JAPANESE AMERICAN FAMILY

working in defense plants and  
some continuing their educat-  
ion, some on farms.  

Riots, lack of privacy, ar-  
guing about the Oath, men  
going off to war, to jobs-  
internal friction affected  
them all. The people worked  
hard to have gardens, small  
parks while fighting the  
blowing sand, trying to make  
a part of their world produc-  
tive and beautiful. Schools  
had names like Thomas Jeffer-  
son, Theodore Roosevelt, and  
Herbert Hoover, complete with  
cheerleaders, bobby sox and  
dances. Churches, beauty  
shops, glee clubs, softball  
leagues, baton twirling, mov-  
ies, all the usual things  
that are in small towns even-  
tually came into being. Thin-  
king of herself as American,  
not knowing a traditional  
Japanese life, at times in-  
vestigating Catholicism,  
ballet, odori (traditional  
Japanese dancing), baton tw-  
irling Wakatsuki Houston was  
living in surroundings that  
protected her from racism,  
even though it was racism  
that put her in the camp.  

In April '42 Mitsue Endo, a  
21 year old Nisei and an emp-  
loyee of the California State  
Highway Commission, filed a  
petition for habeas corpus,  
protesting her detention at  
Topaz Camp in Central Utah. 24  
years later the Supreme Court  
said the government cannot de-  
tain loyal citizens against  
their will. In early '45 not-  
ice was sent that all “re-  
location camps" would be clos-  
ed by December '45.  

People had no homes to go  
back to. Long time racist  
groups like the American Le-  
gion and The Native Sons of  
the Golden West were joined  
by No Japs, Inc. (San Diego),  
The Home Front Commandoes  
(Sacramento) and The Pacific  
Coast Japanese Problem League  
(Los Angeles) as well as gro-  
wers associations who were all  
benton preventing the Japanese  
returning to the Coast. Jean-  
ne at 11, hearing tales of  
racism knew she had to face  
it. It was the humiliation,  
that continuous unnamed ache  
I had been living with was  
precise and definable now.  
Call it a foretaste of being  
hated. I knew ahead of time  
that if someone looked at me  
with hate, I would have to  
allow it, to swallow it, be-  
cause something in me, some-  
thing about me deserved it.  

After finding a place to  
live the family discovered  
the warehouse that had stored  
their furniture, appliances  
and silver, for which they had  
paid each month, had been "ro-  
bbed". Their car had been re-  
possessed and no records of  
their fishing boats remained  
and they were starting from  
scratch.  

The tone of her life was set  
the first day of school-after  
reading aloud in her class a  
blond girl said, "Gee, I didn't  
know you could speak English."  
...I soon learned there were  
certain areas I was automat-  
ically allowed to perform in:  
scholarship, athletics, and  
school-time activities like  
the yearbook, the newspaper  
and student government... but  
when she wanted to join the  
Girl Scouts she was not allow-  
ed in. Later, as a baton twir-  
ler for a Boy Scout drum and  
bugle corps she found The Girl  
Scouts was much like a soror-  
ity, of the kind I would be
