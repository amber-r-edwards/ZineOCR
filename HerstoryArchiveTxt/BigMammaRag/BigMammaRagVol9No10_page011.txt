Becoming Powerful: Peruvian Women  

This is the text of a taped  
interview between Kim Woman-  
tree and Andrea Gabriel.  

Andrea is a white North Am-  
erican woman who lived in  

women in Peru  

Huancayo, Peru, from 1973 to  
1976, teaching sociology, wor-  
king with a farmworker's un-  
ion, and with neighborhood  
and women's groups. She also  
lived for six months in Comas,  
a shantytown outside Lima.  
(See BMR Vol. 6, #84 & 5.) Re-  
cently she returned to Peru  
for two months to visit wo-  
men's groups throughout the  
country.  

Kim: You found there is a  
women's movement in Peru.  
What kinds of women are in-  
volved in it?  

Andrea: Well, women who are  
up front about calling them-  
selves feminists are often  
people who either have some  
kind of job which permits  
them to work with women on  
feminist projects or they  
have a husband supporting the  
family, giving them enough  
freedom to be able to commit  
themselves to feminist organ-  
izing full-time. However, in  
the broader women's movement  
you now have an enormous num-  
ber of really poor women  
without such privileges, wom-  
en who have long years of po-  
litical experience working on  
neighborhood projects.  

Kim: For example?  

Andrea: Neighborhood issues  
are such things as demanding  
electricity, water, transpor-  
tation, schools, medical care,  
for people who live in shanty  
towns outside the cities. Wo-  
men who have been working a-  
round such issues have recen-  
tly become aware that as wo-  
men, in the political left,  
they have a problem, and that  
they have many other problems  
that are specific to women  
and don't get dealt with in  
neighborhood struggle commit-  
tees. These women are linking  
up with the "feminist" women,  
who very often don't live in  
the shanty-towns. The result  
is health classes, Mother's  
Day protests, support for fac-  
tory women trying to retain  
their jobs, demonstrations a-  
round reproductive rights,  
and so on. The coming together  
of those two kinds of women is  

what's happening right now,  
and providing a really enor-  
mous grassroots base for fem-  
inist organizing.  

Kim: So women that have been  
working in male/female groups  
in the parties and other or-  
ganizations are now beginning  
to get together with the fem-  
inists that don't come from  
such poor backgrounds but  
work mainly on women's issues?  

Andrea: Right. Most of the  
women who formed the first  
feminist organizations came  
out of political parties also.  
But since they weren't people  
who lived in the poorest nei-  
ghborhoods, they didn't have  
party work to do connected di-  
rectly with those kinds of  
grassroots struggles. They  
felt dissatisfied with the  
kinds of jobs they were being  
given by their husbands and  
other men in the party. Those  
were the women who first star-  
ted publishing articles and  
meeting together in conscious-  
ness-raising groups.  

Kim: I've seen some of the  
articles in papers you brought  
back with you from Peru,  
and some are really exciting,  
especially the ones from  
peasant women.  

Andrea: Well, the movement  
in the countryside is of a  
different nature.  

Kim: Why?  

Andrea: There are testimon-  
ials coming from various in-  
digenous communities by women  
who have decided they need to  
come together as women in  
those communities, partly be-  
cause many of the men have  
left the community to find  
work in other places. There's  
a whole phenomenon of the in-  
ability of families to make it  
in the countryside, and so  
very often there are many more  
women than men living in small  
towns, and these women have  
not assumed a responsible role  
in running the community up to  
now, because that hasn't been  
their role for a long time.  
But they're really being forced  
to do so.  

Kim: So circumstances are  
forcing women to be more pow-  
erful in their communities as  
they were before the Spanish  
came?  

Andrea: Yes, and they're  
working with feminists.  

Kim: So what kinds of ac-  
tions do the women in the  
countryside do?  

Andrea: Well, a lot of their  

rea

need is simply to become lit-  
erate—to learn how to read  
and write, and to learn how  
to participate in public mee-  
tings. Peasant women have  

been extremely militant in de-  
fending community land, but  

many women are held back from  
discussions about things that  
assault women, because wo-  
men, in earlier periods in  
Peru, had much more power  
than they have today. So a  
loss of the traditions, the  
older traditions that are  
looked down on by city people  
are really traditions that  
are more favorable to women.

are important to them because  
they don't know Spanish.  

Kim: They're Indian, indigenas.  

Andrea: Yes. And the valu-  
ing of their own native lan-  
guage is the other side of  
that, you know, not to feel  
intimidated that they aren't  
fluent in Spanish—to be able  
to rise above the feeling  
that they are ignorant simply  
because they aren't literate  
in all of the languages that  
are spoken in the region. Al-  
so, women are rising above  
being ashamed of their own  
knowledge, the knowledge they  
have about health and so on.  
There's been this frontal as-  
sault on native medicine, on  
native customs of all sorts,  
coming along with capitalism,  
which is at the same time an  

Kim: Can you give me an  
example?  

Andrea: Trial marriage is  
an example. Most of the  
people in places which have  
not been completely assimi-  
lated into the industrialized  
part of the social order do  
not get married until they've  
lived together for a long  
time. In a particular town,  
people who have been living  
together for a while will all  
get married on the same day.  

Kim: Is that mostly in the  
country?  
Andrea: No. It's even true  

in the shantytowns in the  
cities. Where I lived before  
outside of Lima, 362 couples  
got married in one day this  
past summer.  

Kim: Is divorce easy, for  

international  

Taking Action And Refusing Shame  

example, if a woman is with  
a man that beats her?  

Andrea: Among poor people,  
you don't even talk about  
formal divorce. In the first  
place, it's not easy to get  
a divorce, legally. But it's  
sort of irrelevant. Over  
half of the families in Peru  
are "headed" by women. Un-  
employment is so severe that  
among poor people, it's very  
difficult to have an intact  
nuclear family. Men often  
have more than one woman in  
different places. They don't  
give support to any of them  
regularly. If they send money  
anywhere regularly, it would  
more likely be to their mo-  
ther, and this provides a  
motivation also for women to  
have children, to have that  
kind of—some sort of social  
security, you know, in the  
future. But at the same time  
the pressure on them to rear  
and maintain these children  
alone makes life very, very  
difficult.  

Kim: So that would be a  
contradiction, in that people  
might not want to get birth  
control because of needing  
to have kids to support them  
in their old age?  

Andrea: And there's a lot  
of association of birth con-  
trol with foreign things  
that are unhealthy, too,  
like Americans are doing ex-  
periments. There's much more  
use of induced abortion than  
of birth control.  

Kim: Americans are doing  
experiments with IUDs and  
Depo Provera?  

Andrea: Right now it's the  
injections. And then there's  
forced sterilizations, and  
all kinds of propaganda about  
birth control and it's diffi-  
cult for feminists even to  
work in that area. What they  
are trying more to do is hav-  
ing classes where women learn  
to understand their whole  
bodies. The idea is to under-  
stand what their bodies are  
like, what they do, how you  
conceive, and then look at  
all of both the traditional  
and non-traditional methods  
of control, and take it from  
there. But they're also hav-  
ing to work around the ques-  
tion of what they call de-  
criminalizing abortion, be-  
cause there are more women  
in jail for induced abortions  

than for any other cause.  

Kim: Wow! Like including  
prostitution or anything  
else?  

Andrea: Well, drug convic-  
tions are running a close  
second lately, but the last  
official count in the women's  
prison in Lima was that 80%  
of the women were in there  
for induced abortions. Their  
jail terms are four years.  

Kim: Good grief!  

Andrea: And induced abor-  
tion is the highest cause of  
death among women of child-  
bearing age. People say wo-  
men have induced abortions  
as often as they give birth  
to live children. Yet, it's  
very often their own family  
members who put them in jail  
—not only because of "mascu-  
line pride," but because of  
the fear of losing a mother  
or wife or daughter, through  
dying from abortion.  

Kim: They'd rather have  
her in jail?  

Andrea: Of course. I mean,  
they feel it has to be pun-  
ished somehow because it's  
so dangerous. And so that's  
one of the issues that's de-  
fined somewhat differently  
from the way it is here.  

Kim: This is an issue that  
has a large number of women  
working on it? In the city  
and the country?  

Andrea: No. It's an issue  
around which there have been  
mass marches in the form of  
historietas, which are comic-  
book type pamphlets. It's  
not something which you could  
really call a mass movement  
across the country—not some-  
thing everyone is aware of.  
It doesn't have that kind of  
support. It's still something  
that is organized on an ad  
hoc basis more than on a  
continuing basis. There is  
no feminist in the Congress.  

Peru has a parliamentary  
government right now, but  
it's dominated by the right  
wing. There is really no one  
to introduce legislation  
around issues like this.  

Kim: It's a whole different  
kind of struggle when you  
don't have any real prospects  
of getting a law like that  
passed?  

Andrea: That's right. Fem-  
inists are looking more to  
revolution than to legisla-  
tive reform.  

Kim: What is the general  

political situation in Peru?  

I know it's a country that  
was for a time run by a mil-  
itary government that intro-  
duced a lot of reforms.  
Andrea: They had a “pro-  
gressive" military govern-  
ment in power which passed  
many laws favorable to women,  
such as the demand that  
childcare centers be set up  
wherever there are more than  
twenty women in a workplace.  
Working women were given a  
lot of rights that we in  
this country don't even have.  
One of the rights that they  
had, for instance, was to  
take over factories that were  
being closed down, to form  
cooperatives and run those  
factories themselves. A lot  
of factories were taken over  
by women, because this ap-  
plied more to small factories  
that tended to employ women.  
Today, women are having more  
trouble taking over factories  
and are resorting to living  
in them with their children.  

Kim: They had more support  
from the military govern-  
ment?  

Andrea: For a while. But  
even though the military  
government had come into  
power with a lot of promises  
to the people who were get-  
ting more and more revolu-  
tionary, it became repres-  
sive and pro-imperialist as  
time went on. It couldn't  
carry out reforms because of  
economic crises originating  
in the U.S. around 1974. So  
you had more uprisings, and  
at this time you have an  
elected government. But par-  
liament has given the presi-  
dent power to pass judgement  
on all of the 1200 laws that  
were passed by the military  
government during the previ-  
ous decade. The president is  
openly pro-American, pro-  
multinational. All of the  
progressive legislation that  
was decreed by the military  
is being undone. State-  
expropriated companies and  
banks and farms are now being  
given to the big foreign  
companies to entice them to  
re-invest in Peru. Recently,  
the president declared an  
“anti-terrorist" law which  
gives the government power  
to arrest anyone on suspicion  
of being opposed to the gov-  
ernment. There have been  
hundreds of cases of brutal  
torture of those arrested.  

The people are calling it a  
dictadura civil.  

Kim: So there's a lot of  
activity in opposition to the  
government, a lot of leftist  
groups there with different  
kinds of politics?  

Andrea: Yes. One of the  
reasons the Left didn't win  
the elections, which they  
probably could have done if  
they had been united, was  
that they split into so many  
different groups. They're  
very much aware of that now,  
and they have formed some  
broad-based coalitions.  

Kim: Then, if there is  
going to be a more social-  
ist or leftist government in  
there, it'll have to be pop-  
ularly elected?  

Andrea: Well, there are  
also groups working in total  
secrecy who feel that elec-  
tions should be boycotted.  
But it's difficult for an  
open feminist organization  
to be linked to those groups  
at this moment, and they are  
very small right now. Most  
leftists think armed strug-  
gle will be necessary at  
some time even if elections  
are won.  

Kim: Within the Popular  
Coalitions, are women organ-  
ized?  

Andrea: There's a Women's  
Commission in the largest  
coalition, the Unidad Demo-  
cratico Popular. The Commis-  
sion had its first public  
meeting while I was in Peru,  
and this was very exciting.  
Women don't have to be mem-  
bers of any particular poli-  
tical party to consider  
themselves part of this coa-  
lition, so it could include  
individual feminists who  
don't want to belong to a  
party, but who identify with  
the coalition. It also in-  
cluded representatives from  
neighborhood party commit-  
tees all over Lima—this was  
a metropolitan meeting. The  
women who came not only had  
interest in coming together  
specifically to talk about  
women's rights, and to talk  
about women's relationships  
with left political organi-  
zations, but they were women  
who had long years of polit-  
ical experience. I don't  
believe there was anyone  
there who wasn't comfortable  
with a microphone in her
