Keeping Healthy for the Revolution

A Guide To Food Stamps  
In Denver

Carol Lease

This country has the highest  
standard of living in the world  
and yet a significant number of  
its citizens live and die in pover-  
ty. Many others exist from  
paycheck to paycheck, pinching  
to meet rising food costs, rent  
and medical expenses. Every  
winter old people freeze to death  
in the middle of some big city  
because the power company  
turned off the heat for unpaid  
bills. Young children can’t learn  
or are intellectually retarded  
because of inadequate nutrition  
due to low family income.

Sexism, ageism, racism and  
classism create, sustain and  
strengthen capitalism that in  
turn reinforces them. The  
government has tried to lessen  
the social pressure against the  
system through various  
assistance programs that are  
supposed to help the poor. But  
“welfare” programs give band-  
aids to individual recipients  
keeping them in subsistence  
misery and give huge subsidies  
to large corporations thereby  
shoring up the system with the  
work ethic.

Since the revolution always  
seems to be right around the cor-  
ner (especially now with the  
recession in full swing) it seems  
best to live from meal to meal  
and figure out how to get what is  
necessary to survive. With this  
in mind, a guide to the  
successful acquisition of those  
magic little coupons — food  
stamps will follow. At least we  
don’t have to starve waiting for  
the revolution and the new  
order.

Many Eligible

According to studies by the  
United States General Accoun-  
ting Office (GAO) and the Senate  
Select Committee on Nutritional  
Human Needs, approximately  
20% of all Colorado households  
who receive food stamps  
shouldn't be (that’s about 27,-  
000 people) and over a quarter of  
a million Coloradans aren't get-  
ting food stamps but should be.

The Department of  
Agriculture, the bureaucracy  
that runs the program, has been  
criticized for not making infor-  
mation available to those people  
eligible to receive food stamps.  
Last January the Denver Depart-  

ment of Welfare published a  
“Food Stamp Information  
Guide” as a result of a suit filed  
by Chicana Welfare Rights for-  
cing the department to make  
eligibility requirements and in-  
formation available.

The purpose of the publication  
is to “make your visit to the Food  
Stamp office a meaningful ex-  
perience.” Anyone can get a  
copy of the publication by phon-  
ing or writing the Department of  
Welfare at 108 West Byers  
Place, 778-8161. However, the  
following summary (plus some  
personal tips) should make the  
experience of applying for and  
receiving food stamps  
“meaningful” but most of all  
successful.

Anyone can apply for food  
stamps. But to get them you  
must have the proper informa-  
tion with you. If you live alone  
you'll have no problem in con-  
vincing the interviewer that you  
cook your food separately from  
anyone else's. If you obviously  
live with other people (who don’t  
receive food stamps or any other  
public assistance) have your food  
stashed in a separate place in the  
kitchen and in the refrigerator,  
and swear that you cook your food  
separately and eat it yourself.  
These are very important dis-  
tinctions to be able to explain to  
the interviewer, after all the food  
stamps you'll be receiving will be  
for your stomach, not to share  
with less fortunate people.

The place where you live must  
have a kitchen or if you share a  
kitchen with an entire house you  
must have your food separate.

A ruling by the food stamp  
people says that a household  
can “be made up of a single per-  
son or a group of persons, who  
are living as one economic unit.”  
To prove this to the investigator  
you would all have to apply and  
furnish receipts and have the  
proper amount of income. If one  
person didn’t qualify then no one  
could receive stamps as a unit.

Get Your Story Straight  
You must meet the income  
and resource requirements set  
up by the department. This  
means that you have to make lit-  
tle enough to qualify to receive  
the stamps. You'll have to  
produce receipts to prove what  
your paycheck is or get a state-  
ment from your employer. Ac-  
cording to the booklet the  
allowable maximum monthly in-  
come standards are:

size of money income  
household: allowed

1 $194  
2 $273  
3 $393  
4 $500  
5 $593  
6 $680  
7 $767  
8 $853  

You can deduct expenses from  
your income such as local, state,  
and federal taxes; Social Securi-  
ty taxes under FICA; retirement  
and union dues; medical costs  
(but not special diets) when  
more than $10.00 per month;  
child care when necessary in  
order to work; fire, theft,  
hurricane or other disaster ex-  
penses; educational expenses  
that are for tuition and man-  
datory school fees; court-  
ordered support and alimony;  
rent, utilities and mortgage  
payments may also be deducted.

Your net income after deduc-  
tions will determine how much  
money you have to pay for the  
stamps. The less you have left  
the less you pay. Like having  
$50.00 left may mean that you  
pay only $1.00 for your stamps.  
You will get $43.00 in food  
stamps for a month. The amount  
of stamps goes up periodically  
due to rises in the price of food  
but not fast enough it seems.

Resources are such assets as  
cash on hand, in a bank or in a  
savings account, U.S. Savings  
bonds, stocks and bonds, land  
and certain personal property. If  
you live or are applying for the  
food stamps alone, you can have  
up to $1,500 in resources.

If you are unemployed you  
must register for work at the  
Colorado State Employment Of-  
fice at 251 East 12th Avenue. Go  
there early in the morning and  
you will be interviewed and  
given a card. This card must be  
stamped every month to remain  
eligible for food stamps.

There are three offices in the  
Denver area where you can buy  
food stamps. The main office is  
always busy, so it’s a good idea  
to go there with a book. It’s at  
108 West Byers, 778-1373. Call  
before an appointment. They will  
probably give you one weeks in  
advance except if you say it’s an  
emergency, then you could get  
one in a day or on the same day.  
This main office is open from 7  
a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday thru Fri-  
day. The Northside office is at  
3700 Navajo, 433-4041. Its  
hours are 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.  
Monday thru Friday. The East-  
side office is at 2855 Tremont,  
573-1947, with the same hours  
as the Northside office.

A little known fact is that there  
is a mobile unit that sells food  
stamps one day a month at the  
following locations: Barney Ford  
Heights — 2024 Clarkson  
Street; Columbine Homes —  
201 So. Yuma; Frances Heights  
Apts. — 3805 W. 25th Avenue;  
Hirschfield Towers — 333 W  
Elisworth; Juanita S. Valesco —  
4550 W. 9th Avenue; Liggins  
Towers — 5150 E. 34th Avenue;

Sagaris, is a difference in goals  
and purpose. Sagaris is to be an  
educational program, with in-  
tensive study. Femé@ was a camp  
where women came to be  
together, discuss, and play and  
enjoy each other. With the heavy  
educational program offered at  
Sagaris, we felt the time  
demanded by cooking and cam-  
ping outdoors would detract  
from the kind of program we  
wanted.”

But... you can pitch your  
own camp at the college for a  
fee of $50 per session  
($10/week)! This, apparently,  
does not “detract from the kind  
of program . . .” that Sagaris  
wants.

You are not, however, sup-  
posed to cook your own food,  
regardless of your sleeping  
arrangements. $150 meal  
money is required of every stu-  
dent by the college. But, it is  
possible that they may be per-  
suaded to change their posi-  
tion, according to Blanch.
