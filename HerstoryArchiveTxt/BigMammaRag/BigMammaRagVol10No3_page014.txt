Survivor Writes

{
Women,

Once again I sit, saddened
and stunned, caught by my own
muffled scream of anguish.

Coming across the articles
entitled "Sick" and "Law En-
forcer" in the February issue
of B.M.R. in the section Hot
Briefs I was overwhelmed
again. Of all the horrors in
the world that we have alien-
ated ourselves from, simply
to survive; child abuse and
rape are two horrors that
must be faced. Child abuse
cannot be dismissed and rape
must neither be played down
nor sensationalized. Don't,
please don't pull away from
the horror. Don't deny the
anger. 

Take a moment woman. Take a
moment and look into the eyes
of a little girl. She's a
very young woman with dreams
and laughter and flights of
sheer energy. She takes fierce
pride in her young body. She
has no doubts about being
able to conquer the world.
She displays affection and
wonder without hesitation.

What kind of horror and con-
fusion explodes in her
child's mind when, faced with
lust, passion and insanity?

What have you done to help
her understand what has hap-
pened? What have you told her
about her innocence, beauty
and affection? What does she
learn about the world of men?
Why do you turn away from
this crushed, confused, asham-
ed little girl? What have you
taught her about being a
woman?

So much for the death of
innocence. Can you examine
rape?

Rape is not a sensational
submission to a greater power,
Rape is not sensational at
all. Rape is neither a news
paper story nor a dime store
novel. Rape is the reality of
you and an ugly, disgusting
man with no one there to ap-
plaud or do a write up. It's
just the two of you and you-
re not sexy or alluring,
you've just a wet hole he
can shove his cock in and out
of, and you've got no choice
in the matter. You're either
going to lie there and endure,
clinging with tight mental
fists to what's left of your
sense of self so that you can
physically survive this degra-
dation, or you'll fight in
horror and disbelief and that
childish feeling that if you

don't want this to happen, it
won't; only to be beaten into
submission. He's going to
shove it in any way. You are
a piece of flesh. Half dead,
black and blue, you are a
dark wet hole for him to
shove it in, and shove it in,
and shove it in. And that's
the reality.

If the anger is too fright-
ening to deal with, don't
turn away yet. At least reach
out and heal, help to heal,
the woman.

You're a woman; a giver,

a nurturer and a respecter of
life. You're special.

We're both women. We're
inherently special, you and
I. I have survived both child
abuse and rape. I'm hurt and
angry. Don't turn away from
me.

Women’s Prisons

Dear Sisters,

I am writing about the lack
of support in women prison-
ers' civil rights cases in
California and throughout the
United States.

California has more lawyers
than any other state--and
probably the most women at-
torneys, also. But they do
not make themselves available
for pro bono work, and nei-
ther do they go to court for
better conditions for prison-
ers and ex-prisoners.

When I was released from
prison two years ago, I had
2 civil rights cases and 2
habeas corpus petitions pend-
ing. I searched unceasingly
for attorneys to help me--
writing federal "civil rights
attorneys" as far away as
Washington, D.C., as well as
writing federal public de-
fenders (who were women). For

the Liberation
of all Women
- and So victory

is born even in 

-Harrisburg Area Women's News

a year and a half, I receiv-
ed referrals--nothing but ref-
errals, no replies; and "Good
Luck."

The ACLU has never helped
me with Welfare Rights, Pri-
soners' Rights, etc. But I
included them on my list--and
was told, as expected, this
was "not a class action" and
“a great number of people

would not be helped."

1) One of these civil rights
suits concerned my being sent
to Patton State Hospital when
I was pregnant in prison--
merely because I had request-
ed and appealed for outside
pre-natal care and delivery.
(There were approximately 30
other pregnant prisoners

there at that time.) Even

though the prison "hospital" was
not equipped for operations,
transfusions, etc., and the
doctors went home at 5 and
didn't work weekends--the
ACLU found my suit to be low
priority. This civil rights
case could have greatly im-
proved medical conditions at
the state's only--and world's
largest--women's prison.

2) The ACLU could have eas-
ily made this a class action.
Almost every woman "treated"
by the doctors had horror
stories to tell.

Searching further, I trav-
eled to Los Angeles to speak
with an organization of women
attorneys (who were "conside-
ring it"--although middle-class
white concerns and cocktail
parties in Beverly Hills fin-
ally overshadowed it,)

I spent my welfare money
traveling to San Francisco
to speak with attorneys who
benefit male prisoners, and
who confided that they did-
n't help prisoners at C.I.W.
because "those women have a
pretty nice place down there."

They would not help with the

medical suit ("you should see
Folsom"); they would not file

a brief concerning the other
civil rights suit on lack of
access to legal books, the
law library--and the opening
and "losing" of confidential
mail; they would not help
with the habeas corpus peti-
tion which had to do with
prison slavery and sex dis-
crimination--the one I had
spent over 100 days in soli-
tary confinement for in 1979.

They told me I wasn't “like
most of the women down there--
passive." Not only had I was-
ted money, and 3 days (2 on
the bus), but I was given a
compliment which insulted my
gender--and then two acquain-
tances propositioned me.

So, the medical case has
been dismissed--after all the
anguish at Patton, and all
the legal work I put into
this case--not because of le-
gal technicalities (though the
court tried), but because I
had no money for xeroxing the
complaint and exhibits, and
serving it on 31 defendants
in 3 states. (A few hundred
dollars, perhaps less.)

And the U.S. Magistrate--a
woman--Tassopulos called it
"frivolous"; she certainly
wasn't going to have her typ-
ists and U.S. Marshals wast-
ing their time typing and
serving it.

Since then, babies have
died at the prison, as they
had before I arrived, be-
cause of lack of proper med-
ical care. Even when I was
there, babies were delivered
in cells and hallways by
other inmates.

If pregnant women and their
unborn children have no right
to decent and adequate medi-
cal care after they pass through

prison gates, no pregnant wo-
men should be imprisoned! And

if this fact is "frivolous"--
if the fact that women are
sent to mental institutions
when they are pregnant, mere-
ly for punitive and budgetary
reasons, is “frivolous"--then
we may as well all start Sieg
Heiling the great judges and
legislatures of the land.

And if all women do not have
the right to decent, compe-
tent medical care in prison,
then we may as well forget
about the Geneva Conventions
--except when atrocities
occur in other countries.

My civil rights case con-
cerning legal access has just
been remanded. I am still
without an attorney. And I am
trying to study law while
