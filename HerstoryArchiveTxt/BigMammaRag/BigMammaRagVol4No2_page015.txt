Women in Transition.

hard. In the door he would  
come, make his grandiose  
announcement, and what did I  
do? Nothing! Not a murmur, not  
a peep. He would say, ‘I’m  
taking $10 out this week,” and  
I would look up at him, smile  
sweetly and say, “O.K."

He stopped doing it. It no  
longer served his purpose, he  
did not get the rewards that he  
wanted... At first I thought  
that it was a victory for me  
over him, but later I realized it  
was much more importantly a  
victory for me over me. It was  
the beginning of understand-  
ing that I could decide what  
happened to me, that my life  
was finally becoming MINE to  
control.

The facts of health for women  
in crises, the space we need,  
financial resources, matters of  
life insurance, information  
about housing and child custody  
for lesbian mothers are only a  
few of the unusual subjects (for  
a book on divorce and separa-  
tion) included in Women in  
Transition. There is also a state-  
by-state listing of help organiza-  
tions. For those who want fuller

their situation, an excellent  
bibliography serves.

From my own experience with  
women in divorce and separa-  
tion, I do find two lacks in the  
book. One is a slighting of the do-  
it-yourself ways to decree,  
possible under no-fault dissolu-  
tion, which save money and  
legal murder. The other is the  
authors’ limited evaluation of  
the various modes of counseling  
available to couples going  
through a divorce.

However, the wealth of infor-  
mation in Women in Transition  
far outweighs whatever its  
minor poverty. It is, in my  
opinion, a must for  
organizations trying to serve  
women in divorce or separa-  
tion. As an individual or group  
purchase it can serve as a con-  
stant guide through the early up-  
heavals, the process to inde-  
pendence, and the  
post-termination realities.

Some ask why the Philadel-  
phians did not also write Men in  
Transition. The reply of Ms.  
Carolyn Washburne, coor-  
dinator, sums up the special  
worth of the book for women.  
“Divorce is rough on men, too.  
But economically and  
emotionally it is much harder on  
women.” For those who want to  
get the most from their money  
and minds for divorce or separa-  
tion, Women in Transition has  
the information and inspiration.
