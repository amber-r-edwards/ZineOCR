Phyllis Kadison and Vicki Piotter

In March 1977, agents of the Immig-
ration and Naturalization Service
(INS) (la migra), raided the Gerry
garment factory in North Denver.
Quoting the usual "we acted on a tip"
they arrested four Chicanas. The
four women were jailed for being in
the US without papers; for being
“illegal aliens."

When the women were jailed, the INS

“did not notify their families, allow-

ing no provisions to be made for
their children. The right to call a
lawyer and to have a hearing are
basic rights that are denied to those
charged with being “illegal“. Pro-
cedures are rarely explained in
Spanish, so they are often not under-
stood by those being prosecuted.

After mass pressure was put on the
INS offices the women were released
on bail, and two were released on
their own recognizance, an unusual
move for women charged “illegal”.

The women and other women workers
demonstrated at the Gerry factory to
demand back the jobs that these women
had lost. Some of the women are the
sole support for their families.

After demonstrating outside, the
women, their families, Gerry factory
workers and other supporters occupied
the offices demanding the company re-
hire the women. After a meeting the
President of the company decided to
rehire them. According to one work-
er, Gerry is a plant where labor is
cheap, raises non-existent, and
seniority unimportant. All of the
four arrested women who had been work
ing to support or help support their
families had been working in the
Denver area for years.

On November 1, three women along
with two of their husbands, went on
trial. They were advised by their
lawyer to plead the 5th amendment
(refuse to answer on the grounds that
it may incriminate them in a future
case.) All answered each and every
question presented by the U.S. immig-
ration attorney by pleading the 5th.
The judge, and U.S. attorney were so
baffled by this procedure that they
recessed to consider the legality.

They then countered by offering blan-
ket immunity to the defendants. The
lawyer still advised them against
answering, requesting total immunity
spelled out for each individual.
Still baffled, the case was not re-
solved on the 1st, and a continuance
was called. There has been no date
set for the continuance of the
trial.

La Migra is actively trying to
figure out a way to get these women

to answer. The lawyers, maintaining
that the arrest was illegal based on
illegal search and seizure, hope to
win the case this way.

These women are still working at
Gerry, absolutely uncertain of what
their future will be. If found to
be deportable, these women have to
leave the country literally immediat-
ely, with no time to gather family,
children, or take care of business.
The gross injustices of deportation
are real to many Chicanas working in
Denver. They are subject to exploit-
ation by the employer, who reminds
them that they have no rights by pay-
ing the cheapest possible wages, and
“busting” them if they complain.

Next month Big Mama Rag will carry
an in-depth report on the Gerry women,
the status of their case, the recent
history of deportation in Denver,
and how it is affecting Denver Chican-
as.

Installers Trial Nears

Deb Taylor

In 1976, seven woman installers
mounted one of the largest class
action suits in the country against
Mountain Bell for $50 million.

The suit charged Mountain Bell with
unlawful sex discrimination practices
and policies on behalf of all women
who are employed, were employed,
might have been employed, or might be-
come employed by Mountain Bell in
craft job positions.

For more money,
I'll get a woman
to work for less!

Recently, the judge in the case,
Feinsilver of the Denver U.S. District
Court, has restricted the case to
charges of discrimination in the
promotion and transfer of the nine
original plaintiffs in the case. It
will no longer be a class action case.
The women installers who filed have
decided to take it back to court any-
way and sting Pa Bell for back pay
and other damages.

The case will finally go to
trial in January or February. People
are needed to do legal research—go
through records of how the company
was doing at the time of the layoffs
and transfers. Mountain Bell claims

that it was cutting back because of
declining profits; the installers
claim Pa Bell was expanding. The
Installers Defense Committee will pay
someone a nominal amount to do legal
research.

The case dates back to the summer
of 1974 when a group of women were
hired as installers and cable splicers
to fulfill the company's affirmative
action program required by the Equal
Employment Opportunities Commission.
In January 1975, 15 of the women in-

Rather than give
you more money, I'll
put a man on your

machine!

installers were demoted to clerks and
operators at a $25 a week pay cut.
Another 12 women were replaced by men
with more seniority and assigned to
lower positions. All the women were
laid off in March 1975, along with
women in other craft jobs.

The craft jobs are the "desired" jobs
at Mountain Bell because they are
more interesting and better paid and
allow for more independence than the
clerical and operator jobs. Only
4% of the craft jobs are held by
women and only 5% by Chicanos and
Third World people. 48% of all
Mountain Bell employees are women.

Only A Striker's Wife

Kathy Kahn

Ed Note: For their protection, the
names Barbara and Gene Moon are
pseudonyms, but the people and all of
the events are real.

Six years ago, Barbara Moon became a
“union wife." Her husband, Gene took
a job at the Coors Brewery in Golden,
Colorado, and joined the Brewery
Workers’ Local #366. Gene was always
a good union man and Barbara was al-
ways a good union wife.

Back then, it wasn't so hard to be a
good union wife. Wives of brewery
workers were virtually ignored by the
male dominated union and were only
seen around the union hall when the
men needed someone to work in the
kitchen during bingo games. The men
went to union meetings; the union
wives stayed home and babysat.

Until seven months ago, Barbara had
never seen the inside of the union
hall. She had been out to the #366
office a few times to pay Gene's union
dues, but had gone only as far as the
cashier's window. She had never seen
the hall itself until one night last
April when it was jammed full of
hundreds of brewery workers and their
wives, most of them facing for the
first time in their lives the real-
ities of a strike.

Barbara heard the strike announce-
ment last April 5th in TV. She rushed
into the bedroom where Gene was sleep-
ing, woke him and told him the strike
was on. Like the other brewery work-
ers, Gene had known a strike was on
the horizon. But the union officials
had given the rank and file members
the impression that it would be a
short one, a “peaceful strike", and
really more of a boycott than anything
else. Gene wasn't too worried and he
rolled over and went back to sleep.

Barbara worried that night. She
thought about their small savings.

She and Gene and their three children
had been through a strike before. It
had lasted only three months and they
didn't suffer too much. Still, this
time they didn't have enough to make
it three months. And this time they
were on strike against Joe Coors, the
biggest anti-union daddy of them all.

The next morning, Gene and a fellow
striker went to the brewery gates to
walk picket duty. It was Barbara's
job to fix the men something to eat on
the line and deliver it to them. A
union wife is now a striker's wife -
and wives were expected to stay in the
background where it was ‘safe’.
Barbara delivered the sandwiches to
the men on the picket line. On the
way back home she stopped off at the
union hall and offered to help, in
whatever way a striker's wife could,
to support the strike.

At first she was told there was
nothing to do, her help wasn't needed.
But within a week Barbara was given a
place in strike support work. She got
the graveyard shift in the union
hall's kitchen. Two a.m. to eight a.
m. making coffee and sandwiches for
the men walking picket duty. She was
never late for work and she never

left early. And she never complained
about being excluded from the more in-
teresting activities around the
strike. After all, she was only a
striker's wife.

Meanwhile, the men handled the ac-
tivity on the picket lines. In the
first week of the strike, Gene Moon
watched scores of his fellow workers
scab across the line. They were
intimidated by Joe Coors’ threatening
letters and were unimpressed by the
union officials’ “peaceful strike"
strategy - hundreds of union members
deserted the union.

But the strike was never peaceful.
From the very first week pickets were
knocked down by speeding scab-driven
cars and arrested on frame-up charges
by the Golden police. And despite the
union officials' insistence on taking
a peaceful attitude, many strikers
fought back right from the very
start.

Soon Barbara was promoted to the
day shift in the kitchen. Now she
began meeting more strikers and their
wives. And she was able to observe
the day-to-day activities around the
hall. The boycott of Coors beer was
underway, a tactic of vital necessity
in winning the strike. Barbara began
taking part in boycott lines along

with other wives, strikers and sup-
porters. Picketing in front of a
liquor store was dangerous enough for
the wives, reasoned the men running
the strike; wives might get hurt down
at the brewery picket lines. (There
had been many instances of scab and
police violence against pickets.)

As the weeks passed by and the word
of the strike and boycott spread a-
round the country, Barbara and other
strikers’ wives began noticing a de-
cided emphasis on the boycott and
less and less effort being put into
the strike itself. “How," they wond-
ered, "can you have a successful boy-
cott without a strike? It was be-
ginning to look like there wasn't a
strike at all. Every day hundreds of
scabs were crossing the line and go-
ing into work. The scabs and strike-
breakers were committing violence

each time they crossed the picket

line, Barbara believed, robbing union
families of their chance to win hu-
mane working conditions and the very
right of survival. The strikers’
wives became angry and decided to
fight back.

One night while their men were in a
union meeting, a group of wives got
hold of some picket signs and went to
the brewery's main gate. It was a
dark night made darker by heavy rain
and even the Company's sophisticated
film equipment couldn't detect the
true identities of the women. Within
minutes of their arrival, the Golden
police were called to the scene, but
the strikers’ wives had made their
own debut on the picket lines.

The women realized the dangers in
being unorganized. They decided to
call a meeting to organize the gate
pickets. They agreed among them-
selves that only the husbands who
could be trusted to go along with
their plan for organized militant
action would be told about the meet-
ing. But the husbands put a
stop to the meeting, telling the wo-
men that they had their own plan and
the wives should follow them. The
wives agreed, and cancelled their
meeting and their organized plan for
militant strike action got lost in
the bureaucratic muddle of running a
boycott.

Two months into the strike, the
strikers had put their faith in the
AFL-CIO for support. In the third
month of struggle, it was clear that
support came mostly in the form of
lip service. George Meany had offic-
ially sanctioned the boycott and the
decline in sales of Coors beer was
becoming noticeable all over the West.
But the lip service wasn't feeding
families or paying their rent. More
strikers left the picket lines and
sought out jobs in other states
where they weren't as likely to be
blacklisted. The ranks were dwind-
ling. But the women rose to the oc-
casion.

In the third month of the strike
many strikers' wives took jobs, some
for the first time ever outside the
home, to support their families and
keep the strike alive. By now, the
boycott lines and the picket lines at
the gates were covered by the wives
as much as by their husbands. Fami-
lies were walking the line together.
Children began learning the differ-
ence between strikers and scabs.
Barbara marveled at the fact that
three months ago everyone felt it was
too dangerous for women to be on the
picket lines. And as the strike en-
tered its fourth month, it was clear
to both strikers and their wives that
the strike could not endure without
