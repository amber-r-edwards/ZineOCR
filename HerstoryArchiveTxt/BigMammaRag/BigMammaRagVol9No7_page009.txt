Much has been said about
the numerous obstacles Mid-
dle Eastern women face in
their journey through three
prisons: the father's house,
the segregated school, and
the husband's confines. But
there are times—revolution-
ary times—when Middle East-
ern women crack these three
fold prisons. They begin to
break the walls of illiter-

mid-east women

acy, total economic depen-
dence, hunger, and multiple
religious and sexist laws,
"honor" killings, as well as
physical and mental abuses
towards "daughter-producing"
women.

It is these historic per-
iods—when in the struggle
for national liberation the
woman also raises the banner
of her liberation—that we
want to discuss, taking up
at one and the same time
three movements as represen-
tative: Palestinian, Iranian,
and Algerian women. We as
well want to see how the
struggles of these women re-
late to the Women's Libera-
tion Movement internationally. This is particularly
pivotal because we are with-
in what even the United Na-
tions has been forced to
designate as the Internation-
al Women's Decade.

Perhaps nowhere more sharp-
ly than with the Palestinian
question do we find the nec-
essity of penetrating the
conflicting currents and
necessary interrelationships
of competing nationalisms,
of class, and of woman as
revolutionary force.

Last July's Copenhagen con-
ference—the U.N. mid-decade
conference on women—will
throw some illumination on
these conflicts. There, the
delegation of women sent by
the Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO), far from
raising issues of women in
the Middle East, especially
within the liberation strug-
gle for a Palestinian nation,
confined itself to present-
ing that old resolution on

“Zionism is racism," which
was then ratified by the
conference.

They allowed themselves to
tail-end that male-dictated
resolution which in no way
solves any of the issues
facing today's Women's Lib-
eration Movement, instead of
allowing the universal de-
mands of that Movement to
help pose a way out of the
Middle East maze by asking
themselves: "Where do we be-

the issues

gin now that every one of us
is oppressed as a woman:
whether we are in a libera-
tion movement or live in a
‘liberated country'?" "How
do we as feminists pose a new
alternative which will en-
compass the liberation of
all, including the Palestin-
ian women?"

Indeed this became clear
when the same delegation of
women vehemently denied
that the right of the Pales-
tinian woman to control her
own body was even an issue.
Leila Khalid, a member of
the PLO delegation, spoke as
follows: "It is not a prior-
ity to speak about abortion.
Every society has its
own priorities. We don't
think it matters to think
about feminist problems.”

But there are Palestinian
women who are raising ques-
tions other than “anti-
Israel." Paymonda Tawil, a
Palestinian journalist, par-
ticipant and organizer of
numerous strikes and sit-ins
against Israeli occupation
of the West Bank, was very
bitter about the Copenhagen
conference, which she said
had nothing to say on the
oppressions of women. In her
book, My Home My Prison,
after speaking of the oppres-
sions of Arab women, she
questions whether there will
be the liberation of Pales-
tinian women after the inde-
pendence of Palestinians, saying,
"What (is) the point of
striving for freedom for my
people if our struggle did
not bring freedom to women,
indeed to every individual?"
She never forgets that, "I
am fighting a double battle
against repression: I am
fighting for the freedom of
my people and simultaneously
for my emancipation as a
woman."

Tawil has no illusions
about the alleged equality
of men and women in Israeli
society and points to the

sexual division of labor in
that country, asking why the
woman Israeli soldier,
this symbol of equality, is
the one sweeping the offi-
ces? Unfortunately, however,
she does not also ques-
tion the class contradic-
tions within the Palestinian
society.

We cannot here follow the
decades-long conflicts and
similarities between Jewish
and Palestinian nationalisms
in the post-WWII world, in-
cluding Israel's role as an
occupier nation since the
1967 war. Instead, we want to
concentrate on Palestinian
women who not only suffer
from national discrimination
between Jews and Arabs,
but also face an inferior
and underprivileged status
within their own people.

Today Palestinian women
have become in a sense “pro-
letarianized" through the

occupation process. They form
a labor force in textile and
food processing industries,
and in agriculture. Becoming
a wage laborer has meant a
certain economic independence
and the beginning of the
breakdown of the Hamoulah—
the extended family. It has
also meant that the women of
the West Bank and Gaza have
both demonstrated against
occupation and have begun to
speak of the sexism in the
Palestinian Movement.

General Union of Palestinian Women/LNS

The high birth rate is con-
sidered to be a weapon against
"Zionism," and while Pales-
tinian women have been allow-
ed to enter the struggle for
national liberation, their
speaking out for new man/
woman relations and against
traditional roles of women is
often attacked as “misguiding
the movement from the strug-
gles against ‘Zionism'" or
even itself labelled "Zion-
ist."

As one Algerian woman ac-
tive in the Palestinian resis-
tance movements writes,
to them (the men) the only
worthwhile issue is the Pales-
tinian struggle against Israel
and they are unwilling to put
any effort into the libera-
tion of Palestinian women.
Why? Without this struggle,
Palestinian women could end
up in the same condition as
Algerian women. Today Alger-
ian women are still in their

homes, just like my mother,
like my grandmother." This is
really the crux of the matter,
not only for the Palestinian
women, but, as we shall see,
in Iran as well.

None can doubt the great
revolutionary achievements of
the Iranian women, whether we
look at the 1906-11 revolu-
tion where the women formed
their own secret Anjumans
(soviets), and founded a week-
ly newspaper for women called

Must Not End In Unfinished

Danesh (knowledge), or whether
we look at the 1979 revolution
and the overthrow of the Shah,
where numerous women’s com-
mittees and publications for
women sprang out in opposi-
tion to the suffocation im-
posed during the Shah's time.

But against this we must
face soberly the truth that
by the second anniversary of
this most recent revolution,
women have been confronted
not only with the symbolic
subjugation of the chador
(forced veil), but with
their actual subjugation as
well. Lowering of the mar-
riage age to 13 for girls,
institution of the one-sided
divorce, as well as official
legalization of polygamy
and elimination of integrat-
ed schools, are only some of
the many laws which have
been instituted to attempt
to push women back some
1,400 years.

Now, under the anti-imper-
ialist banner of the hostage
crisis—which was in reality
a power struggle between the
clergy and the civilians,
rather than against either
capitalism or U.S. imperial-
ism—the women watched the
imposition of the new reac-
tionary Constitution.

It is a constitution which
calls the "primary task of
women raising of children,
includes a set of laws which
to a great extent deny a
woman the custody of her
children in case of a divor-
ce, and literally regards
her as “half a man" in every
legal and religious princi-
ple.

However, the shock has not
only been these counter-
revolutionary moves of the
government, but also, and
even above all, the attitude
of most of the Left which
has increased its distance
from the women's movement
as the reactionary govern-
ment has tightened its grip.
Some of the Left, including
the Fedayeen organization,
somewhat supported the
March 8, 1979 demonstration,
when, for five days the wo-
men came to the streets, and
chanted, "We didn't make a
revolution to march back-
wards."

But in November 1979, the
majority of the Left ignored
the first Iranian women's
convention. The Fedayeen
even arranged a competing
rally. And finally, the
July 1980 spontaneous de-
monstrations of the women
against the enforcement of
the head scarf for govern-
ment workers were attacked
by most of the Left, which
called them "bourgeois" and
“reactionary” as well as
"chaotic," since they were
not led by a party.

The truth is that far from
being reactionary, the women

—from very young high
school women to workers, stu-
dents, and mothers—have been
involved in numerous demon-
strations, strikes, and sit-
ins which have continued to
this date.

The Kurdish women, who
have formed their own organ-
ization (The League of Re-
volutionary Women of Kurdis-
tan), have not only been in
the forefront of the fight
against the Iran and Iraq
aggressions, but have also
continued to challenge the
sexism of the Kurdish move-
ment which tries to limit
their participation in the
struggle.

That the Left should have
such a sexist attitude tells
much of the bankruptcy of
thought which passes for
Marxism in these organiza-
tions, including their “rela-
tion to women's liberation."

In a series of articles re-
cently published by one Left
Iranian group, Peykar, the
leadership advises readers
not to organize women either
as an autonomous women's
group or around concepts such
as women's oppressions and
other feminist issues, but
rather to concentrate only on
the issues of fighting imper-
ialism and abolition of class
society. Indeed, the party
paper discourages its member-
ship from agitating around
illiterate mothers (house-
wives) as it argues that they
are most concerned with their
oppressions as women, and do
not wish to postpone a dis-
cussion of these demands, as
the vanguard party wants,
until the day after the soci-
alist revolution!

As if Marxism and feminism
are sitting on two different
poles, every party finds its
utmost task to set itself up
as a mediator to make sure
“too much" feminism does not
get in the way of "Marxism."
This is true not only of the
Left organizations which re-
duce women's liberation to
point seven or eight on the
agenda, but also of many dif-
ferent independent women's
organizations.

In Iran, under the title
"theoretic questions on
women's liberation," Lenin's
dialogue with Clara Zetkin
after the 1917 revolution is
printed and reprinted as evi-
dence that questions of sex-
uality and new man/woman
relationships may not be
brought up by the women's com-
mittees and that instead, the
emphasis should be on the
class struggle and at best,
striving for equality of men
and women after the revolu-
tion. Alexandra Kollontai,
the Russian revolutionary, is
praised because in spite of
her devotion to feminism she
followed the party line and
emphasized the necessity for
reproduction among Russian
women in 1921.

Rather than taking the dia-
logue between Zetkin and Len-
in as the point of departure
for today, we need to re-
create the dialectics of lib-
eration with women's libera-
tion as an integral part of
it for our time, just as
Lenin did for his time when
he singled out the movements
of the national minorities
for self-determination. We
need to realize that in our
decade, "genuine Marxism has
feminism within it and genu-
ine feminism finds its most
critical, that is revolutionary, expression within Marx-
ism."

One way of seeing what hap-
pens when you subordinate

women's liberation to the
struggle as a whole stands
out glaringly in the still
unfinished revolution in Al-
geria.

As against the beautiful
descriptions by Frantz Fanon
in A Dying Colonialism of
the revolutionary transforma-
tion which took place in the
life of Algerian women when
they became participants in
the national liberation move-
ment and began to include de-
mands for their liberation
as well, the Front for Nation-
al Liberation (FLN)—which
was neither grounded in a
full revolutionary theory
that would include women as a
revolutionary force, nor had
any clear vision as to what
type of a society it wished
to create once the colonizer
was overthrown—made "nation-
al heroines" out of women,
yet asked them to limit
their participation in the
struggle “within the context
of traditional Islamic
family life."

In contrast, there have
been Algerian women who
raise the question of extend-
ing the revolution beyond
narrow nationalism.

Fadela M'rabet, an Algerian
feminist who comes from a
family of Ulama (elders of
Islam) and is a writer who
had a program on Radio Al-
giers for women, is among
the many women who bitterly
attack the narrow religious
