This year in Denver, the annual
"Gay Pride Day Parade" took on a dif-
ferent appearance. Men in “drag"

playing prom queen in convertibles and macho

machismos in chains riding on floats
were replaced by over one thousand
marchers with demands and a truckload
of children. The name of the march
had also been changed to “Lesbian/Gay
Freedom Week March."

The march was the culmination of a
week of activities during Lesbian/Gay
Freedom Week, June 17-25. Among the

week's activities were a "gay day" at
Elitches, an ecumenical religious serv-

ice at Cheeseman Park, several benefit
shows, a dance, a film festival, a
symposium, and a picnic.

"Gay Day" at Elitches, a local amus-
ement park, was on June 17th. A $6.00
ticket bought gate admission and un-
limited rides from 11:00 A.M. to
4:00 P.M.

On Friday, June 23rd the Gay Commun-
ity Center presented four films. "In
the Best Interests of the Children” is
a documentary which explores the aware-
nesses of eight lesbian mothers,
their differences and similarities to
other mothers, and the reasons why

lesbian motherhood is viewed as a
threat to American society's values.
On the same program was Jan Oxenburg's
"Comedy in Six Unnatural Acts," a
film which explores and parodies six
common myths about lesbianism. A car-
toon entitled "Rollin' With Love"

which animates several tennis balls in

a satire of the "coming out" process
was also shown. The last film was "A
Gay View: Male" which featured three
gay men talking about their feelings
and experiences.

The Second Annual Rocky Mountain
Lesbian/Gay Symposium was held on
Saturday, June 24th.

Keynote speakers were Tor Bradford, speaking on the
demands in the Lesbian/Gay Freedom
March; Bill Olsen, speaking on the
responsibilities of the gay man;
and Councilperson Kathy Donahue,

speaking on the importance of unity in
the gay community.

Workshops began at 10:00 A.M. and
continued throughout the day. Topics
included unity in the women's libera-
tion movement, parents of gays, gay
politics, S & M, religious issues,
the National Lesbian Feminist Organ-
ization, transvestism-drag-transsexual-
relationships, the lesbian/gay
alcoholic, lesbians and gay men working
together, and numerous others.
The closing program began with
poetry readings by Chocolate Waters

Lesbian/Gay Freedom Week March

Lesbian Feminists Organize

Bat Greer

I wonder where our heads are these
days. When I bring up political
activities and projects in a group
and get a "ho hum" response, and
then someone else suggests renting
a roller skating rink and gets an
excited response close to applause.
Fun is fun I realize and I’ve never
been one to turn down a roller
coaster ride or a picnic in the
mountains because I hadn't done my
share of political activity for
the week.
Being "political" is a downright
drag some days—long meetings, shuff-
ling papers, licking stamps, the
proverbial "burn out." But life is
no picnic, not for lesbians. Oh,
it was “in" to be "gay" last year
perhaps for the last two or three
years. But it isn’t this year, and
I doubt it has ever been "in" to be
a lesbian.

Several years ago some brave souls
started "coming out" to friends,
family, employers, the press, Uncle
Sam and the U.S. Army. They marched
in the streets, suffered through
radio and television talk shows,
kept on coming out and marching and
talking until less brave souls were
joining them. Then so many people
were marching and talking and coming
out that we finally knew we
really were everywhere.

We got comfortable, secure, lazy,
whatever, thinking it was just a
matter of time until we could just
live our lives like anyone else.
Then along came A. Bryant and company
and we thought no one with an ounce
of sense will listen to her—we
were right about that—no one with
an ounce of sense listens to her,
but we didn't realize how many
senseless people there were.

Now things are happening around
the country that are almost un-
believable. People are actually
voting against basic human rights.
In America.

Perhaps the key to this whole
right-wing movement is that it is
unbelievable. We just cannot be-
lieve it is happening, or we think
it's too far away from us, or maybe
we think we're safe or that we've
always got a comfortable closet
available.

But what if we aren't exactly ex-
cited about the thought of a lifetime
in a closet, of splitting our
personal, business and social lives,
of passing for straight? What can we
do? Well, we can fret and stew,
tremble, get mad, throw them the
finger, scream, cry, bite our nails
or put our heads together and think
of some real viable action to take,
in other words, we can get organ-
ized. The right-wing is organized—
mad and organized, mad at ever-
ything from unemployment to taxes
to energy and they have to have
somebody to take out all this mad-
ness on, and we are it. Gulp.
Conveniently, we have in Denver

and Paradoura Carpenter and a theatre
presentation by “Ain't I a Woman“
feminist theatre collective. Charl-
otte Peterson talked of her recent
child custody case. See article on
page 7 of this issue. The program
ended with a community discussion of
the march.

Questions surrounding the march
included the name change, the exclu-
sion of drag, the limitation of vehi-
cles to children or handicapped adults
and whether or not the march should be
to celebrate "gay pride” or issue
specific demands to the heterosexual
community. Members of the Lesbian/
Gay Freedom Week March Coalition
explained that their purpose in organ-
izing the march was not to exclude
drag, but was to equally represent all
factions of the gay community. The
coalition explained that the demands
were both pertinent and important to
all factions of the gay community and
that the picnic following the march
might serve as a time for celebration.
One of the coalition members said that
the traffic section of the Denver
Police Department had requested a
reduction in the number of vehicles.
The consensus of the community meeting
seemed to be in support of the march.
It was decided that next year's march
would be planned by any interested
members of the gay community. Anyone
interested should contact the Gay
Community Center.

The marchers assembled at Cheeseman
Park between 10:00 A.M. and 11:00 A.M.
on Sunday, June 25th. After finishing
painting signs and banners, about 700
lesbians and gay men and other gay
rights supporters left the park at
noon and marched down Franklin Street
to Colfax, then east on Colfax to the
Civic Center Park. Along the route
300 others joined in the march. By
the time it arrived at the Civic
Center Park there were over 1000
marchers. Signs and banners stated
the marchers' five demands: an end to
police harassment of lesbians/gays,
support of custody rights of lesbian/
gay parents, support of the lesbian/gay
youth movement, endorsement
of lesbian/gay rights at the legisla-
ture, and an end to racism and sexism.
The group assembled at the Civic
Center for a short rally with an open
mic. Several members of the gay
community stated their ideas and feel-
ings. The rally ended with a large
group snake dance.
After the rally many went to Cheese-
man Park to enjoy free hotdogs, beer,
and watermelon in celebration of the
day.

Gay Rights

A member of the Boulder Gay Liber-
ation Coalition, Henry Tobin, is
working towards getting a non-discri-
mination policy for gays at the Uni-
versity of Colorado. There will be
four groups affected by a policy of
this sort: students, faculty, class-
ified staff (secretaries, grounds-
keepers, cooks, etc. who are hired
under the state personnel system) and
unclassified staff (administrators,
coaches). Each of these groups has
its own grievance procedure, so different
policies would have to be drawn up for each one.
All four campuses would be affected,
but the policy for the classified
staff would have the most far-reaching
effects, as this policy would
have to be adopted by the state
personnel system, affecting hiring
statewide in all categories. It
will also be the most difficult to
get.
