CHILE...  

From Page 15  

Women got together and realized they  
had the power; their demands went  

far beyond what the authorities  
envisioned for them. This is the kind  
of thing that stimulates a women’s  
movement.  

In one case, women brought up the  
idea that the men were irresponsible  
with the farm machinery. There hadn't  
been much machinery in Chilean agri-  
culture, and the government was intro-  
ducing technology to the countryside.  
The men would sometimes take the  
tractors into town and get drunk and  
then would wreck the tractor on the  
way home. This happened occasionally,  
but even if this happened once, it  
was a tremendous tragedy for the  
community to lose use of that tractor  
for even a few days.  

The women felt there was no reason  
why they could not be put in charge  
of the tractors; they felt they  
were more responsible and could be  
trained to repair the tractors as  
well as operate them. This demand  
was a very logical one from their  
point of view and a very unexpected  
one from the point of view of the  
government officials, and it was  
taken seriously.  

BMR: There seems to be the implica-  
tion that the men could still go  
out and get drunk and that the women

which she worked. The biography  
contains a stimulating historical  
account of the various groups,  
organizations, and people that  
contributed to the working class  
movement in Chicago from the 1870s  
through the 1930s. By connecting  
the movement's philosophies, their  
splits and disagreements, their  
plans for action, where they  
failed and succeeded, to the ex-  
isting social conditions, Carolyn  
makes her biography of Lucy Parsons  
complete.  

Carolyn does Lucy Parsons jus-  
tice by not overindulging in the  
details of Lucy's personal life.  
Instead, the book serves as a  
mouthpiece for Lucy's revolutionary  
beliefs. This is the way Lucy  
Parsons would want to be remembered.  
She once said that the life  
of the reformer is totally insig-  
nificant; only the reform itself  
was important. She practiced this  
principle and consistently main-  
tained that her own personal life  
was inconsequential.  

We are indebted to Carolyn Ash-  
baugh for “recovering” the life  
of this revolutionary woman whose  
political dedication and commit-  
ment is an example for all of us  
working for social change.

Didn't have that option. Was there  
any challenging of that kind of  
irresponsibility on the part of the  
men, that kind of double standard?  
Carol: I lived on one particular  
farm and saw a process going on  
around those particular questions,  
a process that hadn't really had time  
to work itself out. The men retained  
those rights, unchallenged, while I  
was there. However, the women began  
demanding their right to help choose  
the president of the work group and  
demanded to be involved in the meet-  
ings which took place. In the process  
of these demands, they came together  
for the first time outside their  
homes in a decision-making, communal  
situation. These women had never had  
that kind of decision-making power  
over their lives before in any way.  

Women had been pitted against each  
other, gossiping about each other,  
based on what men said about their  
own wives to justify beating them up.  
Women would often agree with the men  
just to prove to their own husbands  
that they didn't deserve to be beat  
up. It was a very insidious thing—  
which is traditional culture—a very  
very heavy machismo.  

But women started to sense they  
had some advantage in coming together  
and participating in meetings, forc-

work against women in an oppressive,  
patriarchal society. In a climax  
sequence, a woman dies of a self-  
induced abortion. Emma is accused  
of performing the illegal abortion.  
Although technically innocent,  
Emma's guilt is poignantly felt:  

she refused a desperate woman a  
safe abortion.  

Perhaps what is most striking  
is the characters of the women  
who dominate the book. The ways  
in which love between women, al-  
ways tacitly expected, is accepted  
or violently rejected, forms the  
backdrop for understanding these  
women. Lesbianism is shown as a  
school-girl fling for some, a way  
to pass time before traditional  
marriage for others. For Emma, it  
is the personal search for a woman  
to love her totally, as no man ever  
could.  

Cytherea's Breath presents a  
feminist view of Victorian America.  
Although certainly not an inclusive  
statement, it does document some of  
the more oppressive aspects of  
America in one of its "golden"  
ages.  

I would like to see a whole line  
of feminist historical novels com-  
ing from the feminist presses. We  
are being introduced to a feminist  

ing the men to deal with questions  
such as alcoholism, which is so  

very crucial and important to women.  
The women told me they resented that  
the community did not take a respon-  
sibility for re-educating the men  
and I could see they were pressing to  
bring that up as a demand.  

In the fisherwomen's unions, (it  
was mostly women involved in the  
fishing industry, not in the boats  
that went out to fish, but in the  
packing), one of their primary demands  
was to have an alcohol reeducation  
program in their communities, to be  
run in coordination with the factory  
community that was developing there.  

Reeducation around alcohol along  
with other educational programs,  
the cooperative meal programs, the  
childcare programs; were things to  
be coordinated between the factory  
and the community.  

BMR: In the cities, where there is  

a high rate of unemployment, women  
have traditionally gone into prosti-  
tution or into domestic work because  
of the situation. Were there any  
changes in bringing those women into  
more productive work situations?  
Carol: The PUG was slow in working  
on those issues. Opportunities for  
professional work, formal education  
as well as factory work did increase  

vision of the future via Joanna  

Russ and Marge Piercy (and the male  
publishing establishment) to name  
two; a feminist present through the  
eyes of June Arnold, Rita Mae Brown  
and many, many more. There is also  
a need (and a market) for books to  
reinterpret the past. Feminist  
historians are providing the ground-  
work but much of their work is in-  
accessible. The Feminist Press is  
doing a fine job with their reprint  
series. Historical novels are also  
an appropriate medium for developing  
a sense of our past.  

The book, however, need not be  
read for its “historical signifi-  
cance" or its "educational value."  
It is, after all, a good story,  
well-told, peopled by real women and  
set off by dramatic situations.  
Although a romantic story, it exists  
in a real world where politics do  
dominate everyday life. Love  
between women is positively express-  
ed, without denying the strong  
strictures against it which society  
imposes, and which often cripple  
women's ability to love.  

Cytherea's Breath is Aldridge's  
third novel. Her other books,  
also from Naiad Press, are: The  
Latecomer and Tottie.

INEZ GARCIA...

Missal of the charge, based on the  
bias already shown by the judge, the  
lack of a jury of her peers, and the  
deprivation, by the PD, of her right  
to true representation.  

Judge Agliano, a more subtle ver-  
sion of the notorious Judge Lawson  
of the earlier trial, not only de-  
nied the motion but also refused to  
recognize the firing of the PD. He  
then refused to postpone the trial  
until another attorney could be  
retained.  

At this writing, the mockery, tem-  
porarily suspended for the holidays,  
goes on; the jury is impaneled.  

An experienced feminist attorney  
already familiar with the case is  
now available. There is still a  
good chance that she can get these  
unjust proceedings thrown out and  
a new trial date set.  

Money for legal fees and expenses  
and other defense activity costs is  
needed immediately. The defense com-  
mittee must raise a total of $7000 in  
the next two months, most of it in  
the next few weeks.  

Considering the historic importance  
of this case, and the usual cost of  
criminal trials, this is not much.  
But it is vital.  

Inez's case has already become  
required reading for a law course  
at UC Berkeley. A male professor at  
San Jose State has benefited from  
her case by publishing the trans-  
cript of her first trial. One wo-  
man has furthered her career as a  
playwright by basing a play on that  
trial. A male reporter for the San  

Francisco Chronicle is also cashing  
in with a book.  

But Inez is in danger of going  
back to prison if money cannot be  
raised to win the vindication she  
has so long fought for.  

The Defense Committee seeks your  
help in meeting their goal. Any  
contribution, even a few dollars,

the Girls Club. The foundations  
want some show of financial respon-  
sibility and plans for means of fu-  
ture support.  

With this last closing of the Girls  
Club, there have been some disgrun-  
tled staff members. While the staff  
has been very committed, often work-  
ing long hours, the staff was not  
told of the closure until only days  
before. Roger Brooks, who was pro-  
gram director, decided even though  
the Girls Club reopened, not to re-  
turn to work. Gail Pierson, the  
previous program director, has talked  
about quitting the board. She com-  
plained of a lack of information be-  
ing distributed; she learned of the  
closure of the Club through a staff  
employee, not from the Board.  

Several of the people connected with  
the Girls Club have voiced doubts  
about the Board's decision to hire  
a male as the executive director.  

The new Director, Paul Bukowski, was  
hired this August. While the Girls  
Club has the philosophy that it is  
good to have a mixed staff, having  
positive male and female images,  

will help. If you can afford $10  
or $100, please send it. They also  
suggest pooling resources with  
friends, or holding small benefits  
throughout the country.

it is certainly puzzling why they  
would choose to have a man as the  
head of the organization. When asked  
what he thought about this question,  
Mr. Bukowski said he “didn't think  
about it... that it didn’t bother  

him."  

At the January 10 meeting of the  
board, the major topic was fund  
raising and immediate plans and al-  
ternatives for the Club. Some dire  
plans were put forth. A proposal was  
introduced to study the feasibility  
of keeping the building or of per-  
haps selling it. Other proposals  
included investigating the possibility  
of renting out the building at cer-  
tain times of the day. Most of  
the board members work full-time jobs  
and do not seem to have a great deal  
of time to spend on Girls Club  
activities.  

Some immediate plans to raise  
money are two dances, sponsored by  
and held at the Girls Club, and a  
night of bingo. Hopefully these  
activities will help convince the  
Foundations of the Board's commit-  
ment to the Girls' Club.

for women; there were many more  
opportunities at all levels. However,  
there were not any projects specific-  
ally around re-educating prostitutes  
or even considering them as an especi-  
ally oppressed group. That question,  
along with the whole question of sex-  
ual objectification of women, was never  
adequately dealt with. I think this  
was in part because there was not a  
women's movement.  

The question of domestic servants  
could not really be dealt with apart  
from the question of eliminating the  
parasite class. In Chile, the economi-  
c changes that took place were in the  
nature of reforms; they were not in  
the nature of bringing to bear a dic-  
tatorship of the working class over  
the capitalists—the capitalist class  
was not eliminated.  

Domestic servants existed, even in  
the homes of leftist professionals.  
There was no money in the budget for  
the kinds of public services such as  
laundromats and public restaurants  
where cheap or free meals could be  
gotten for families. Although these  
things were projected for the future,  
they simply were not implemented due  
to lack of funding and they were not  
given priority for the funds that were  
available. This, again, is something  
I think women have to demand.  

OLIVIA...

(although they are available for  
sale to women who cannot afford  
the albums). In some cases, dis-  
tributors have had problems get-  
ting the music into womyn's or  
gay bars. Sometimes, they're  
played in straight bars. (In  
Denver, the Broadway Cabaret said  
Be Be K'Roche's music wasn't  
danceable enough.) Other sugges-  
tions were offered about using pos-  
ters to announce the arrival of  
new releases, doing radio inter-  
views with various focal points,  
getting reviews and articles in  
newspapers, having listening par-  
ties for new records and holding  
workshops to discuss the politics  
of womyn's music and of Olivia's  
work.  

In talking about dealing with the  
men who usually own and manage  
record stores, the subject of “one-  
stops” came up. A “one-stop” is  
a company that buys records from a  
company and then sells them at a  
higher price to retail stores.  
Olivia has consistently refused to  
deal with "one-stops," because 1)  
these companies are male-owned  
(with the exception of Women in  
Distribution), 2) they take an  
additional cut of the cost of a  
record, therefore profiting from  
womyn's work and raising the cost  
to the buyer, and 3) they have a  
great deal of control over how an  
album is presented to and public,  
and would then be a competitor for  
Olivia distributors. The sole  
advantage to using this system  
would be the distribution of re-  
cords in areas where there is no  
Olivia distributor.  

At present, the only “price set-  
ting" involves womyn's stores  
always paying less for albums  
than over-ground stores pay.  
Retail stores, because of their  
volume, can undercut womyn's stores  
as it is, whereas womyn's stores  
need the profit to stay in bus-  
iness. Records are also available  
there for at least a week before  
they're put in over-ground stores.  

During the time allotted for  
"political discussion," several  
topics were covered. Although  
money for a studio could be raised  
by selling shares, Olivia main-  
tains that "we do not want people  
who just pay money and don't work  
to have a say in Olivia decisions.”  
A potential problem with co-opta-  
tion by large record companies  
creating divisions of “womyn's  
music" was discussed. Again, this  
is something that must be consid-  
ered by all of us, as it's highly  
likely that as womyn's recording  
companies become of sufficient  
size to be noticed, corporations  
may decide to make some bucks off  
“the latest gimmick."  

The conference didn't end at a  
specific time. Womyn left as they  
had to catch planes, exchanging ad-  
dresses with others they wished to  
keep in contact with, before leaving.  

Re-
