movement

Working

to call for elaboration of a
"maximum program," something
he thought was particularly
necessary because peasants'
immediate demands for reform
(their "minimum program")
would not lead them auto-
matically to support commun-
istic solutions of their
problems. In the case of
women, however, he was content
to leave analysis to the
future. I believe this was
not because he thought women's
immediate needs would auto-
matically lead them to revolu-
tionary consciousness (as
would the immediate needs of
the proletariat), but pre-
cisely because women with a
revolutionary consciousness
would be a threat to the
Party itself, which was patri-
archal.

In spite of Lenin's limita-
tions, he did respond to the
pressures of feminist move-
ments occurring in Western
democracies at that time, and
was therefore ahead of most
men of his time in supporting
democratic rights for women
such as abortion and contra-
ception, while at the same
time condemning "neo-malthus-
ianism" (the blaming of popu-
lation growth for all the ills
of the world). While he
cannot be credited with rais-
ing feminist issues, he did
support important causes
espoused by feminists. He
proposed raising the wages of
women as a counter to prosti-
tution rather than the use
of religion and police. He
favored desegregation of
public education, legal
divorce, suffrage, compulsory

education for women and men,
compulsory establishment of

nurseries in factories, and
the entrance of women into
public life.

These changes were enacted
by decree in the USSR, with-
out affecting the patriarchal
form of government. They
were not recognized as mere
reforms, but were hailed as
signaling the complete eman-
cipation of women. Lenin
knew better. He said: No
other republic has so far
been able to emancipate women.
The Soviet government is
helping her. But Lenin could
not lead a feminist revolu-
tion, and he did not
encourage women to do so, or
even predict that they might
do so in the future.

Having said all this, what
should be our relation to

Lenin as feminists? We have
little to learn from his con-
duct and political positions
regarding women. What is
most obvious is that the
problems of women did not
occupy much of his attention.
However, we may have much to
gain from observing his con-
duct and political positions
in the interests of the work-
ing class. He was a master
at observing the dialectic
of class struggle. His ad-
monishments to workers were
bold and imaginative. Both as
workers and as women, we need
to exercise that kind of
boldness and imagination.
Lenin insisted that knowledge
about inequities in distri-
bution or sources of income
was not useful in predicting
human behavior or in waging
struggles against injustice.
He looked carefully at rela-
tions of production, the
kinds of work people do and
their relations with each
other in doing it, to
determine or predict class
consciousness and political
movement. In other words, he
applied Marxist methods of an-
alysis to concrete situations
and then told revolutionaries
where they might best put
their energies in changing
the world.

When Lenin looked at the
breakup of feudal estates in
the countryside, he did not
make the mistake of thinking
that the central feature of
change was in the direction
of going from large-scale to
small-scale farming. After
receiving plots of land,
peasants often had to give
them up for lack of money to
maintain them or because of
one year of crop failure. He
noted that the major feature
of change was the introduc-
tion of wage labor, that
speculators were busily en-
gaged in buying up small
farms and that the overall
trend was toward capitalist
accumulation on a grand scale.

As women we must become
adept at doing this kind of
analysis. We must train our-
selves not to be blinded by
statistics that would appear
to reduce our power as revo-
lutionaries. We must never
rely on new laws and insti-
tutions that are meant to
pacify us. Rather, we must
examine the structures of our
existence in relation to
those who have authority over
us, and seek to overthrow

that authority.

Over and over again, Lenin
put forth ideas that were in
advance of the spontaneous
activities of the masses.

We must go beyond the idea
that the only possible
struggle is that which is
already going on. Even though
he was not physically present

in Russia during most of the
time during which revolu-
tionary struggle was going on,
he inspired the workers so
much that they were able to
turn defeats into victories,
define their tasks in revo-
lutionary terms, putting
maximum pressure on their
enemies.

Lenin always admonished
workers to put pressure on
the government directly rather
than to "spur liberals on to
bolder deeds." As women we
need to remind ourselves con-
stantly that we must not limit
our struggles to petitions
and pleas directed to re-
formists, whether they be
male-dominated Left organi-
zations or liberal members of
legislative bodies. We need
to take our demands directly
to those who hold maximum
power over us, and let those
who can and will respond to
us with support.

In contrast to those who
followed him as heads of
government in the USSR, Lenin
insisted that neither bribery
nor force should be used to
get peasants into communes,
but that communes should be
centers of production so ef-
ficient and politically ad-
vanced that they could render
constant assistance to those
outside them.

Class Feminism And Lenin

As feminists we must spur
the organization of community
centers for childcare, food
preparation and distribution,
etc., that can be attractive
to people and serve their needs
whether or not they are commit-
ted to participation in them.

Arbitration of domestic dis-
putes, neighborhood vigilance
against crime, without reli-
ance on "the authorities",
and pressure brought to bear

against abusive husbands and
lovers are ways such centers
could serve the communities

in which they are located.
Lenin often said that cases

of police brutality should
never be ignored. To ignore
any such case is to legitimize
it. As women we would do well
to take with great serious-
ness each and every instance of
rape, of wife battering, of all
forms of brutality against
women. This would serve to
strengthen our own unity and
to put men on notice that we
are ready to engage ourselves
in outright war against
patriarchal oppression. We
should insist that feminist
men join us in this endeavor,
forcing divisions among them
over issues affecting our
welfare and safety. (Men could
be assigned to the educating
and we would do the policing.)

When there was a lull in
revolutionary activity in
Russia, Lenin used this time
to expose class forces with-
in the revolutionary move-
ment. It seems to me that in
most industrial societies we
are in such a period now. We
need to understand the con-
tradictions within our own
movement and inspire women to
identify clearly with the
most advanced forces in it,
combatting both false con-
sciousness and various forms
of male identification.

False consciousness and
male identification cause
women to deny their own op-
pression, to see the in-
terests of their oppressors
as their own interests.

(Mr. Smith cannot see you
today. We have a very full
schedule; you will have to

call in for an appointment.)

Among heterosexual women,
male identification most
commonly takes the form of
leaning on men, seeking their
approval; among lesbians, im-
itating men to gain male
privilege, especially in re-
lation to childcare.
