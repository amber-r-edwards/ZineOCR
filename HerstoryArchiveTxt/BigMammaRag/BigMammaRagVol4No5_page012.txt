Florence

Theresa Ducato

A myth in her own lifetime,  
Florence Nightingale is less  
renowned for her great  
achievements in medical re-  
form. Although she was re-  
sponsible for the establish-  
ment of nurse training schools  
where literate and respectable  
women could learn a profes-  
sion, she took no stand on the  
women's rights movement.

It is now 120 years since the  
“Lady of the Lamp” returned  
from the Crimea, a national  
heroine, and 65 years since  
her death in 1910. Because of  
reform and scientific discover-  
ies, the medical profession has  
made great strides in the last  
100 years, but women have  
made few inroads into the  
profession as doctors. Today,  
women are largely restricted  
to nursing.

Notwithstanding some argu-  
ments presented to justify this  
inequity, it would be interest-  
ing to explore Florence Night-  
ingale’s attitude toward wom-  
en’s emancipation. Should she  
have used her prestige and  
influence to support women's  
demand to become doctors?  
Or does she stand, a genius of  
her century, who chose to  
devote her energies exclu-  
sively to bring about much-  
needed reform in a non-  
political arena?

Beginnings

Miss Nightingale was born  
in 1820 in Florence, Italy, the  
second daughter of well-to-do,  
upper-class British parents.  
Her father was a studious and  
sensitive man; her mother was  
a volatile and socially ambit-  
ious woman. Both sisters  
received a classic education  
but Florence soon proved to be  
the brighter of the two.

Socially and intellectually  
her education was broadened  
to include parties, balls, and  
soirees in London and abroad.  
Because of her charm, intelli-  
gence and wit, she seemed  
destined for a brilliant mar-  
riage.

But there was a deeper and  
more serious side to her

Amazon Poetry and House-  
work are two of the first four  
volumes of poetry published  
by Out & Out Books, a new  
women's press.

Joan Larkin, author of  
Housework and an editor of  
Amazon Poetry, founded Out &  
Out Books last year. Among  
the reasons for founding the  
press, she writes, was “to  
make a new publishing outlet  
available to a group of writers  
who have often been denied  
access to existing modes of  
publishing.”

Joan Larkin and Elly Bulkin  
are lesbian-feminists. Amazon  
Poetry is an anthology of  
lesbian poetry.

“While Out & Out Books is  
not committed exclusively to  
lesbian writing,” continues  
Larkin, “it will continue to  
reflect my primary motive in  
founding a press: making  
available to others the books

Nightingale created Nurses’ Role  

nature. She came to resent  
idleness in women around her  
and was often bored and  
depressed. After a profound  
religious experience when she  
was in her mid-twenties, she  
found a measure of relief from  
her frustrations. She discour-  
aged her suitors and resolved  
to devote her life to nursing.

Her mother’s and sister’s  
violent opposition did nothing  
to change her mind. But these  
frequent altercations resulted  
in a long and bitter alienation  
from her family and might  
well have contributed to the  
antagonism she later devel-  
oped toward her own sex.

In 1851 she traveled to  
Kaiserwerth on the Rhine, in  
Germany, to visit and inspect  
the Practical Training School  
for Deaconesses. She remain-  
ed there for two weeks and  
then went to Berlin where she  
visited hospitals and charit-  
able institutions.

Two years after her return  
to England, she secured an  
appointment as Superintend-  
ent of an Institution of Sick  
Gentlewomen in Distressed  
Circumstances. Although it  
was through this position that  
her administrative genius took  
root and the springs of crea-  
tive energy released, it was  
the outbreak of the Crimean  
War, a year later, that set the  
stage and rang up the curtain  
for Florence Nightingale, the  
myth.

Crimea  

One of the most infamous  
wars in modern British his-  
tory, it provided the impetus  
for her humanitarian efforts to  
alleviate human suffering and  
for her later achievements in  
medical reform. In his famous  
poem, “The Charge of the  
Light Brigade,” Alfred Lord  
Tennyson immortalized the  
futile heroism of a few British  
cavalry officers. But there was  
to be no epitaph for the  
common soldiers who fought  
and died heroically in the  
stench of misery.

They died from lack of  

we need for our survival.”  

Lesbian writing should not  
be defined too narrowly here.  
Lesbianism, of course, influ-  
ences the poetry of these  
women as it must influence  
their lives. These poems,  
however, are to all women, a  
testimonial, perhaps, to the  
fact that sexual preference is  
not the central issue of femin-  
ism. Both lesbian and straight  
women suffer in a society  
which defines too narrowly the  
role of women and limits too  
severely her opportunities for  
self-expression. All women  
are demeaned by a society  
which extols traditional male  
values and ridicules traditional  
female values.

In Housework, Larkin writes  
of woman’s experience in the  
home, on the job, with friends,  
with lovers, and with family.  
Larkin is at her best when she  
speaks generally. In her poem  
“Cautionary,” she warns the  
housewife, like herself and  
many selves before her, to:

Be quick  

Watch out for the mirror  
with the border of tin fruits.  
Watch out for the worn spoons  
from a set of wedding silver.  
Do not listen to the music  
in the wooden piano—  
it has a use for you.

The plainest everyday things  

medical supplies, drugs, sani-  
tation, and doctors. Condi-  
tions became almost unman-  
ageable when cholera swept  
through the Turkish barracks  
at Scutari where the wounded  
were quartered.

At the request of England’s  
prime minister, Miss Nightin-  
gale was asked to form a  
group of nurses and travel to  
Scutari. When she arrived  

of her efforts and from the  
reports of the first war cor-  
respondents, Sir William  
Howard Russell of The Times,  
the British public was made  
aware of the horrendous state  
of the military hospitals and  
the inadequate medical care  
for the sick and wounded.  
Conditions improved and  
reform was in the air. “Miss  
Nightingale taught officers  

Florence Nightingale nursing the Wounded in the Crimea  

with forty women, the odds  
must have seemed insur-  
mountable. More than the soft  
touch of a woman’s hand  
would be needed to “bring  
order out of the chaos that  
surrounded her.

There was the usual bur-  
eaucratic bungling, both in the  
Crimea and in London. Her  
demands for better conditions  
for the common fighting man  
were met with indifference  
and hostility from the doctors  
and military who resented her  
official presence. But in a  
quiet, determined way, she  
drove herself on, often ruth-  
lessly, to the permanent detri-  
ment of her health.  

She nursed, but more often  
she administered and or-  
ganized in the midst of human  
suffering and was in constant  
contact with the officials in the  
War Office. Slowly, as a result  

are dangerous:  

the clear drip of the faucet  
the fire under the kettle  
the hum of the refrigerator.

Take what you need  

but hurry.

Do not stop to listen  
in the hallway.

There have been many  
before you.  
Few have come back.

Poetry is largely tone, and  
here Larkin achieves it  
through the terse, direct  
phrases, as if there were no  
time to lose, and the parallel  
phrase structure, dinning into  
her reader the message that  
all things conspire, method-  
ically, inexorably, to keep her  
in the home.

Larkin also writes of the  
fears of motherhood. Two of  
the poems are to her daughter  
Kate, and two more are about  
her. Again she is good when  
she expresses the fears of all  
women.

How will I guard myself from  
sleeping children  

and their fear of falling?  
The milk bottle on the ledge  

toppled in the wind and went  
down on the hard sidewalk,  

the baby I dreamt of at night  
when my breasts were  
dripping ~  

and officials to treat the sol-  
diers as Christian men.” It  
was little wonder that when  
the soldiers were repatriated  
home, her fame was spread  
throughout England the half-  
way around the world. In her  
excellent biography of Miss  
Nightingale, Cecil Woodham-  
Smith succinctly commented  
that when the war was over,  
only two heroic figures  
emerged from the Crimea, the  
soldier and the nurse.  
Reform  

On her return to England,  
she found her fame an embar-  
rassment. She wrote that her  
difficulties were two-fold.  
First, she was famous, sec-  
ond, she was a woman. The  
two together made it difficult  
for her voice to be heard on  
military reform. She refused  
to attend public affairs in her  
honor, issued no statements,  

rolled on the bed, rolled  
right to the open window—  
“Somehow I forgot and left an  
open window!”

Through these poems of  
concern for her child, Larkin  
manages to say much about  
herself. In another poem  
about an unsuccessful Easter  
basket she gave her daughter,  
Larkin acknowledges the basic  
needs that her daughter fills  
for her. She illustrates the  
human truth that at least part  
of love is selfishness, that part  
of concern is one’s own fear of  
inadequacy.

O bean, egg, bunny,  

I loved your red  

head, your just-made lips  

that sucked me satisfied,  

when my own body was  
the food you wanted.

When Larkin writes of love  
and intimate relationships  
other than motherhood, how-  
ever, she is often hackneyed,  
her images fragmented, and  
the sense of her poems  
muddy.  

Watch out! fresh pain  
is all over this woman.

You want to touch her  
but you're afraid  

some of it will rub off.  
This time, you think. Risk it.

and gave no interviews. Her  
health already impaired, she  
channeled her energies to-  
ward bringing about needed  
reform and establishing a  
school for the training of  
nurses.

During the course of her  
lifetime until she died at the  
age of ninety, her achieve-  
ments were outstanding. She  
was first to gather and use  

statistics to support her pro-  
digious research. Ministers  
and officials consulted her  
concerning sanitation and  
plans for the building of  
barracks in England and India.  
Yet these successes were  
frequently overshadowed by  
constant setbacks that left her  
ill and deeply depressed.

In 1889, the British Nurses’  
Association attempted to es-  
tablish a policy to certify  
nurses on the basis of their  
skill. It was the beginning of  
a battle that split the nursing  
world in two. Miss Nightin-  
gale reacted with anger and  
concern.

She had always maintained  
close supervision over her  
nurses’ training and kept up a  
voluminous correspondence  
with them in spite of the fact  
that she was almost seventy, a  
cripple and partial recluse.  
What was required of her  
nurses in work was nothing  
compared to what was re-  
quired from them in character.

The opposition felt that,  
though they did not deny the  
superiority of her trainees,  
her method could not produce  
enough nurses to meet the  
demand. But she alone had  
established training schools  
for nurses and was opposed to  
any system that did not  
consider both skill and charac-  
ter as the criteria for certifica-  
tion. She recalled the image of  
nurses prior to the Crimean  
War as being women of “loose  
morals.” “I have, in thirty  
years,” she said, “raised  
nursing from the sink.” Char-

And sometimes Larkin is  
like Plath: heavy, surreal, and  
sinisterly sexual. In these  
poems Larkin writes of blood,  
stains, hacking off, sinking  
stones. These are the ones I  
like least; they are also the  
ones which make me the most
