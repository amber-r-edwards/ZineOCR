Focusing on Racism,

Sara Grusky

This article originated as
a report on the Southeastern
Abortion Rights Conference
that was organized primarily
by the Feminist Women's
Health Center in Tallahassee,

struggle

Florida, and took place Sept.
4-6. However, I did not want
to do a conference report iso-
lated from the political
struggles going on around me,
nor could I report on the con-
ference without expressing
my own views on the state of
the women's movement.

Therefore, I must preface
this article by saying it is
less a report on the South-
eastern Abortion Rights Con-
ference, and more a comment-
ary about current issues and
struggles within the women's
movement, many of which we
discussed during the confer-
ence.

The Tallahassee Feminist
Women's Health Center is dis-
tinguished from most Feminist
Women's Health Centers by its
strong black leadership and
the leadership participation
of black women during the
conference was significant.
The Tallahassee health center
has consistently provided
leadership in confronting ra-
cism in the women's health
movement. Although the con-
ference title only reflected
abortion rights, the confer-
ence organizers set the goals
and content of the conference
to deal with racism, feminism
and women's struggles for au-
tonomy. With this country
moving so rapidly to the
right, the conference could
not help but discuss Third
World liberation struggles,
the KKK, racism, zionism and
lesbian separatism. Through-
out the conference it seemed
difficult to address the
erosion of abortion rights
outside of a movement that is
working to overturn the en-
tire system.

The most practical and con-
crete information was provided
by a woman who worked for the
Jane Collective, a group of
laywomen who provided under-
ground abortion services to
more than 10,000 women prior
to 1973. In addition, Suzann
Gage, author of When Birth
Control Fails, provided in-
formation about herbs and
other home abortion tech-
niques. For me, the most sig-
nificant aspect of the con-
ference was the workshop
called, Black Women, Femin-
ism, and Abortion Rights,
which continued beyond the
scheduled time, into the
lunch break, and had reper-
cussions on all aspects of
the conference.

Before reporting on this
workshop, it is important to
note that these same issues
of racism in the women's
movement have surfaced again
and again with increasing
frequency in various cities
and organizations in the
past couple of years. Some-
times it's the struggle be-
tween addressing issues only
of relevance to women, such
as rape, battered women and
abortion, or, being forced
by the world situation to
address war in El Salvador,
war in Namibia, MX missiles,
the neutron bomb, the threat
of the draft and the rise of
the KKK. Some women become
concerned that we are "sell-
ing out to the left." Anoth-
er woman speaks of living in
the whole world and having
what is happening in the
whole world be of concern to
her, and refusing to be
ghettoized in her politics
by dealing only with issues
of specific concern to women.
Oftentimes this same discus-
sion ends up talking about
racism in the women's move-
ment. It seems that these
contradictions in the women's
movement have caused the
issue of racism to surface
more clearly. Because the
women's movement has been
dominated by white women who
decide its direction and
priorities, changing the di-
rection and priorities often-
times means dealing with
racism.

The workshop, Black Women,
Feminism and Abortion, was
facilitated by Loretta Ross
and Nkenge Toure, two black
women from the Washington D.
C. Rape Crisis Center. It
started with each woman stat-
ing why she was there. There
was a clear difference in
why the black women were
there and why the white wom-
en, myself included, were
there. The black women wanted
to discuss their struggles
within the white dominated

women's movement, and to
share perspectives with each
other, as black women, on
feminism and abortion rights.
The white women were there
primarily to learn what black
women were thinking and feel-
ing about these issues.

The black women began by
discussing abortion. White
women have always been able
to exercise more choice over
having children or not. His-
torically, black women have
not had the same access to
money or abortion as white
women. One woman said that
white women also have the
economic means to have child-
ren, to have a husband with
a stable job, and to stay
home and raise their children.
White feminists say take off
your shackles, don't get mar-
ried, don't tie yourself down
with children and isolate
yourself at home as wife and
mother. One black woman said,
give us the economic means to
stay home and raise our child-
ren. Another black woman dis-
agreed, saying that black
women wanted to stay home and
raise children.

Some women felt that black
women had increased pressures
within the community to be
"hush, hush" about their ab-
ortions. Obviously large num-
bers of black women get abor-
tions, but they don't parti-
cipate in the movement. One
black woman said that in or-
der for her sisters to parti-
cipate, the class base of the
abortion movement would have
to change. This would change
the strategies of the move-
ment because Third World wom-
en are in very direct contra-
diction to the system, and
they aren't about to go up to
Capitol Hill and waste their
time lobbying Congressmen for
abortion reform. In addition,
the reality of genocidal pol-
icies directed at people of
color is still unrecognized
by large parts of the femin-
ist abortion movement. The
murders in Atlanta are just
one example of the extreme
disregard white society has
for black children.

Black women talked about
their struggle to integrate
their feminist consciousness
within the larger struggle
of black people, as a people.
Black women have had to
fight for feminists to devel-
op any kind of race or class
consciousness. At the same
time, black women oftentimes
face struggle and rejection
from the black community
when they bring up women's
issues.

White women continue to
assume that their priorities
must be all women's priori-
ties, said one black woman.
Another woman said the ERA
just means equal rights for
white women. It won't make
any difference in the lives
of black women. Many of the
contributions made by women
of color to the women's lib-
eration movement are ignored.
It was no coincidence that
the decisive court cases that
fought for our right to de-
fend ourselves against rape,
even if it means killing the
man, were all brought by
Third World women: Joann
Little, Inez Garcia and
Dessie Woods. In addition, of
the first six sexual harass-
ment cases that went to court,
five of them were brought by
Third World women.

Survival issues are pri-
mary issues for Third World
women. The black women chal-
lenged the white women to ack-
nowledge the diversity and
address the different priori-
ties of Third World women.
Poor, Third World and working
class women need to be repre-
sented in the leadership of
the women's liberation move-
ment. Otherwise, the gains
white women make can only be
at the expense of Third World
women.

White women had partici-
pated in the workshop very
little up until this point.
Black people are often in
the position of “educating”
white people about racism
and black culture. Black peo-
ple already "know" middle
class culture because it is
the mass culture they have
to deal with every day. Black
people have to learn white
language just to get by. In
the second part of the work-
shop, the facilitators sug-
gested that the white women
talk about the struggles
they were waging in their
own organizations and per-
sonal lives to deal with
racism.

Several issues came up as
the white women spoke. Be-
cause we live in a deeply
segregated society, most
white people must make a
conscious effort to socialize
or form relationships outside
of our white worlds. One way
to force ourselves out of a
segregated white world is to
provide active support to
the issues people of color
face, whether it be a rally
against the murders in At-
lanta, a fundraiser for the
Southwest Africa People's
Organization (SWAPO), or a
film about the war in El Sal-
vador. Not that we would do
these things out of "charity"
but rather because we recog-
nize that it is in our own
interests as anti-imperial-
ist feminists to have SWAPO
victorious in Namibia and
the revolutionary front vic-
torious in El Salvador.

Several white women talked
about the importance of read-
ing black history and current
writings, particularly, This
Bridge Called My Back, Writ-
ings by Radical Women of
Color. One woman shared the
experience of doing con-
sciousness-raising in her
group around lesbianism. Al-
though the lesbians in the
group were open about their
sexuality, they always felt
invisible because their ex-
perience was ignored. It was
through becoming sensitized
to the experience of lesbians
in the group that the group
began to recognize their ra-
cism, and all the ways in
which black people's reality
is also ignored and made in-
visible.

One Jewish woman spoke up
and said that she did not
identify as white. She was
Jewish. This had helped her
to understand the struggle of
black people. Another Jewish
woman spoke up in disagreement
with this. She said it did not
matter how you identify your-
self, unless you are a Seph-
ardic Jew or a black Jew, you
are identified as white in
this society and have white
skin privilege. It is dishon-
est to pretend anything else.
Although it is questionable
how far that white skin priv-
ilege will go as anti-semitic
attitudes rise along with
other forms of racism.

Unfortunately, the work-
shop ran out of time before
all the white women had a
chance to speak. The workshop
moderator summed up with an-
other challenge to white wom-
en to struggle with the diff-
erences and diversity Third
World women bring to the
movement and to build a wom-
en's liberation movement
that fights the battles that
will bring liberation to all
races of women. The existence
and success of this sort of
movement depends on the con-
tinued contributions of
Third World women as well as
the acceptance and recogni-
tion of the leadership of
Third World women.

I have participated in
several workshops, confer-
ences and discussions where
the topic of racism in the
white women's movement was
discussed. Too often the
white women would get bogged
down in our own guilt, tread-
ing lightly, being afraid to
speak up in the discussion
because surely then our own
racism would show. We have
all internalized the racism
of our society and the pro-
cess of struggling against
it means being confronted,
criticized and trying to
change. White women in the
women's movement have often
begun dealing with racism
through consciousness-rais-
ing. While consciousness-
raising is a powerful tool,
it is also important to in-
corporate anti-imperialist
activities in our day-to-day
work. In struggling against
racism, I have found it
helpful to discuss where the
actual practice of the fem-
inist movement has been ra-
cist. These are some exam-
ples that came up in this
workshop and other discus-
sions with women of color.

In looking at some of the
issues that feminists have
fought around, we can see
how both the way the issues
were fought for, and the
choice of the issues them-
selves, were detrimentally
influenced by the racism of
the women's movement. The
issue of abortion is a per-
fect example. While all wom-
en suffer when abortion is
illegal or inaccessible, al-
though to different degrees,
it is poor and Third World
women that suffer at the
hands of racist population
control policies that allow
sterilization abuse or exper-
imentation with Depo-Provera,
(a 3-month injection of hor-
mone acting drugs used for
birth control. Possible side
effects include becoming
sterile.)

It was too many years into
the feminist abortion rights
movement, and only after the
hard work of Third World
women and groups such as
CESA (Committee to End
Sterilization Abuse) and the
Feminist Women's Health Cen-
ters, that sterilization
abuse became a “feminist”
issue and the practices of
population groups like In-
ternational Planned Parent-
hood Federation and the Al-
lan Guttmacher Institute
were exposed. In the mean-
time the fuzzy and biased
analysis of most white fem-
inist organizations enabled
the population control groups
to move, with little organ-
ized opposition, into Third
World communities and coun-
tries and set up "family
planning” clinics and steril-
ization clinics. Still today,
many feminist organizations
refuse to take a firm stand
against the racism of popu-
lation control groups around
the abortion issue. Unless
there is a clear acknowledge-
ment that genocidal policies
do exist in organizations
such as Zero Population
Growth or the Association
for Voluntary Sterilization
(the group originated in the
'30s calling itself the
Race Betterment Foundation),
and that these groups are
enemies of women's reproduc-
tive control and women's lib-
eration, there is no basis
for unity with Third World
organizations.

Another example of a fem-
inist issue that has had neg-
ative repercussions on the
black community is the Take
Back the Night marches. Here
in the District of Columbia
we see the city getting
“cleaner and whiter" day by
day. Real estate speculation,
condominium building, crack-
downs on prostitutes in Lo-
gan Circle are all part of
this campaign. Who owns the
streets anyway? What does
the slogan, Take Back the
Night mean? While white
middle-class people are safe
in their homes, the streets
are often homes, meeting
places and social places
for poor and Third World
people. In D.C., while the
rally was taking place, one
man was outraged that he
couldn't get a decent night's
