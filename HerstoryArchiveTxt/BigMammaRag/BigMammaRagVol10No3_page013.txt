Spirituality

Emerging Energies, Honest Self-Expression....

I am a witch. Being a witch
means different things to
different people. I tried
to involve myself in var-
ious covens and to do rit-
uals for all the sabbats,
but that so far hasn't wor-
ked for me. I think there
is a lot of power in groups

witches

of women doing semi- estab-
lished rituals, but my ex-
perience in observing so
many strict religious cus-
toms of the Jewish religion
has turned me off to struc-
ture. Sometimes I feel very
guilty when, say, Summer
Solstice passes and I didn't
manage to go to any circles
to experience the spirits.
My first experience in a
witches circle was several
years ago when Z. Budapest
was visiting San Francisco
from LA. There were 200
women present in a re-done

warehouse with a gigantic
window covering one wall.
It was so totally moving
to feel all these women
chanting together. We sent
energy to defeat the Briggs
Initiative, which was on
the ballot to hunt down gay
teachers. Z. led everyone
into a winding snake and as
we all moved past each other,
we each kissed a brief kiss.
The energy in the room was
so powerful and healing,
that I felt it in my bones
that we really can heal.
When I think about all
those Christian missionaries
in Africa, Asia, South
America and everywhere there
are native peoples who have
rituals and customs which
evolved from centuries of
living saga. This is without
doubt an essential part of
imperialist domination and
exploitation, to convert the
people from their rituals.
Rituals have power, commun-

ancestors in the spirit
world who watch over, and
keep people in touch with
the land. Patriarchal reli-

gion gives the message of
sin, guilt, subjugation to
authority, and the subjug-
ation of women to men. If
the brujas and witch doctors
were free to heal with herbs
and magic, the people would
not be stuck with the drugs
that are so poisonous that
they are banned in the US
and Europe.

After the torture I got in
the mental “hospital”, I
spent two years at my par-
ents' home. For the most part, I
didn't leave my bed except
to pee, eat dinner with them,
or lay my head on my mother's
lap as she and my dad and
grandma watched TV. Toward
the end of that period I
realized that the concept
called God that I had been
taught was ripping me off as
a woman and a person who is
divine in my own right. I
remembered reading in my
college psychology text about
"mentally ill schizophrenics"
who thought they were "God."
So it was scary for me to
feel a divine healing energy
within me. I had survived the
shock treatments and prolixin,
and I knew there was something
healing that I could share.

When I got to the Bay Area
after leaving the Midwest, I
had more contact with the
idea that we are all divine.
Some WAPA (Women Against Psy-
chiatric Assault) friends
dragged me along to Z.
Budapest's slide show. She
showed pictures of women
images from thousands of
years. Several of the slides
she took herself from museums.
This was back around 1976 and
not too many women were call-
ing themselves witches. I
began making images of Godd-
esses in wax and then in
metal and hung out mostly
with feminist witches. The
witches I've known have been
very warm and welcomed me at
gatherings. But mostly they
were into a positive energy
trip. I got tired of hearing
not to be negative, to re-
direct my thoughts. Of course,
that's something I got from
everybody, not just witches.
Plus, there were problems
over notions of karma and how
one's mind draws toward her-

self what she needs to exper-
ience. No way can a strong
will keep a woman from being
overwhelmed and oppressed by
patriarchal imperialism. When
I had long hair, men used to
hassle me constantly. Some
witches used to say to me that
I needed to have a strong at-
titude to keep men from both-
ering me. That angered me,
since I already felt I had

a strong attitude. What it
boils down to for me is that

I love the witches I've known,
but the few people I trust to
spend time with are ex-mental
patients and other people who
get depressed and freaked out
and share that with me.

I think the growing interest
in Goddess spirituality is
healing. We are all the God-
dess, for she exists in coun-
tless forms. We all have that
healing power. Just as we
were born of our mother's
womb, so are we all born of
Mother Earth. For me being a
witch means believing in the
powers of our minds. Chris-
tianity and Judaism focus the
powers of our minds in a hum-
ble way. They make us feel
"God" is some all-powerful
father-type, who demands
obedience. Being a witch can
mean anything you want it to
mean.

Being a witch and being a
mad woman blend for me. I am
not concerned with channeling
my energies into some positive
way. I, rather, am concerned
with letting all my energies
emerge, teaching myself not
to suppress myself to fit in
with other people, and to
express myself and my strug-
gles without feeling too much
agony when I get put down for

not being more “positive”!

Merlin Stone's books have
a lot of good information.
Ancient Mirrors Of Womanhood
describes Goddesses from many
lands. When God Was A Woman
tells about our roots in mat-
riarchal culture. Z. Budapest's
books have a lot of good infor-
mation too. The Feminist Book
of Lights and Shadows discuss-
es setting up an altar, doing
rituals, describes the Sabbats
and has a terrific guide on
the Tarot. There are other
books around, but having had
17 shock treatments, I find
reading to be very difficult,
and I have only read a handful
of books in ten years.
