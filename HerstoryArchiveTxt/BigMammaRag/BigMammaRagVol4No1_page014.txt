In response to the limitations
and restrictions outlined below,
on December 9 and 10th, a
group of mothers went before
the Joint Budget Committee
with their children. They gave in-
formation as to the status of
their living standard and educa-
tional goals. The following is
their statement of issue:

We the concerned people of
Colorado are being faced with
certain governmental programs
whose impact on childcare will
be devastating. One program in-
volves the new regulations un-
der Title XX which became ef-
fective October 1, 1975. Along
with the new regulations for this
program is the decision by the
Colorado Director of Social Ser-
vices to recommend to the Color-
ado legislature that assistance
for childcare services be limited
to those receiving Aid to
Families with Dependent Child-
ren (AFDC) grants and that child-
care assistance be restricted
even for AFDC recipients inso-
far as their educational goals are
concerned.

Our positions and recom-
mendations are as follows:

1. That the federal regulation for
day care homes which includes
all the daycare mothers’ child-
ren through the age of fourteen
is unrealistic and unnecessary.
The staff/child ratios required
for daycare centers are totally
out of line with their operating
budgets. (see Nov & Dec. BMR)

WE RECOMMEND that a full
scale survey of day care homes
and child care centers be made
so that the state and federal
government will be able to better
understand the economic situa-
tion and become more sensitive
to the needs of these people and
centers.

WE WANT the regulations
changed to permit full reim-
bursement for conformance to
Colorado state licensing re-
quirements which we believe
are adequate.

2. Students on Aid to Families
with Dependent Children and
low-income parents have three
options for childcare: pay for the
care themselves, leave the child-
ren alone or in inadequate care
situations, or stay home as a
long term recipient of public as-
sistance. Parents who are in this
situation (students and income
eligibles) do not earn enough
after rent, food, clothes, tuition,
books, and taxes to pay for child-
care. For these people, the last
two options will become their
only means of working them-
selves off assistance programs.

WE RECOMMEND that Title
XX restrictions on the Income
Eligibles regarding part time
work be eliminated so that eligi-
bility, including the two weeks to
look for work, is the same as it
was prior to October 1, 1975.

WE RECOMMEND that the
state continue its commitment
to providing matching funds for
the Income Eligible category.
WE RECOMMEND that the
state relax or remove the res-
trictions on higher education for
the AFDC parents. That educa-
tion should be a matter of indivi-
dual choice and that each case
should be reviewed individually.

3. The child’s day care experi-
ence will directly affect her/his
home life and is one of the most
significant factors in determin-
ing the child's forming per-
sonality. The child is growing
and learning — whether or not
adequate care is available. The
child care role is critically im-
portant to the child as a person
and to the community and
nation. In too many cases the
people performing the day care
role are underpaid and under-
supported. We are told that the
economic and energy problems
must be solved first and all other
concerns placed on the back
burner. Child care is an
economic and social problem.
We insist that adequate child
care policy planning be incorpo-
rated into our community's and
nation’s planning.

WE RECOMMEND that the
state engage in financial plan-
ning to raise the maximum reim-
bursement level from 60% to
100% of the Colorado median in-
come adjusted for family size
and extend eligibility to families
where both parents are working
with combined income below the
100% level.

WE RECOMMEND that the
state commit itself to reim-
bursement at a level which
permits professional and dedi-
cated people to remain in the
child care services. That the
state and municipal agencies
provide training programs in
child care for child care people
and parents and support a team
of child care specialists as a
community resource.

Linda Jensen, one of the
women testifying and an
organizer of the sit-in, came
away from the hearings with the
impression that there was no
sympathy or empathy from the
committee. They remained
polite as long as the TV cameras
were there.

Figures that Balance

According to Ms. Jensen, all
they want are figures that
balance. They were unmoved by
the fact that some women put
50% of their incomes into taking
care of their children. The com-
mittee was interested only in
immediate figures and not long
range projections. A non-
humanistic mood prevailed as
long as the books balanced.

Ms. Jensen further said the
Committee could not under-
stand why women who were not
raised to be career oriented can-
not raise four children. And
more than not understanding,
they did not want to be educated.
Ms. Jensen read their attitude as
looking at these mothers as low
income poverty women who are
child breeders that want some-
thing from the state so have
children to get it. And if that’s
the attitude of the Committee,
how can anything be accom-
plished in dealing with them?
And nothing was.

ters fulfill this requirement at
this time.

Singing

A counter-amendment to per-
mit representation to all re-
cognized chapters was de-
feated, and finally it was
proposed that chapters having
50 or more members be re-
presented.

The vote on this proposal was
so narrow that delegates were
required to move to either end of
the floor so that an exact count
could be taken. Supporters of the
proposal began singing and call-
ing on opponents to join them;
some did. The supporters won by a
narrow margin.

Olga Madar was re-elected, as
were Addie Wyatt of Amalga-
mated Meat Cutters, vice-presi-
dent, and Gloria Johnson of the
International Union of Electrical
Workers, treasurer. Joyce Miller
of the Amalgamated Clothing
Workers was elected corres-
ponding secretary, and Patsy
Fryman, Communications
Workers of America, recording
secretary.
