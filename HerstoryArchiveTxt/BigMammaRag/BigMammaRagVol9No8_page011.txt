Theory Into Practice; Feminists Work In

The Women's Committee of the  
New Movement in Solidarity  
With Puerto Rican Independence  
and Socialism

We are a group of white  
women who work in the New  
Movement in Solidarity with  
Puerto Rican Independence  
and Socialism. We come from  
a variety of political move-  
ments: the women's movement,  
the Lesbian movement, the  
disability movement, the  
anti-war movement. Most of  
our group have considered  
ourselves as part of the  
women's movement for years.  
Much of our political growth  
occurred in the newly reborn  
women's movement of the 60's  
and early 70's, a movement  
that was inspired by the  
struggles of Black people  
in this country and the  
Vietnamese. The women's  
movement gained courage  
and knowledge from their  
example, and developed a  
feminist politics that recognized there would be no  
liberation for women without  
the destruction of the  
entire system. In the  
process of taking on anti-  
imperialist solidarity work,  
many of us began to downplay  
the importance of the  
women's movement. We think  
this was incorrect because  
we believe deeply in women's  
liberation. We have

pro-

been in struggle to change  
our practice and to act-  

ively participate in building  
and being part of a women's  
liberation movement that isn't  
about reform but is fighting  
to defeat imperialism.

We have been greatly pushed  
by the leadership of the  
Puerto Rican Independence  
Movement because they so  
clearly identify imperialism  
as their enemy and because  
of their unshakeable com-  
mitment to its destruction  
as the only road to lib-  
eration for their nation.  
Five of the 11 Puerto Rican  
Prisoners of War arrested  
in Illinois last year and  
alleged to be part of the  
FALN (an armed clandestine  
organization fighting inside  
the US for independence in  
Puerto Rico) are women. They  
are not waiting for the  
leading off revolution for their  
liberation.

When Haydee Torres, one of the 11,  
was on trial, she turned  
her back on the judges and  
spoke to her supporters, de-  
claring that she is a free-  
dom fighter not a criminal  
because taking up arms is  
the only way to break the  
Mexican people through bloody  
genocidal wars, vast wealth  
stolen from the slave labor  
of generations of kidnapped  
African people, an empire  
built on the military occup-  
ation and plunder of nations  
in Asia, Africa, South Amer-  
ica and North America. Today  
the US holds on to Puerto Rico. It  
is the example of women like  
Haydee and Lolita Lebron who  
have led us to look at our  
struggle as women in a new  
light and ask ourselves what  
is the relationship of the  
struggle for women's liber-  
ation and the destruction of  
imperialism. This art:  
a step towards answering that  
question.

What do we mean by the word  
“imperialism"? Simply put,  
imperialism is the most ad-  
vanced form of capitalism,  

a system where a few nations  
control the land, labor and  
resources of the majority of  
nations. A look at the hist-  
ory of the US reveals the  

foundations of the imperial-  
ist system -- I  
from Native Ame-

~Credit Lost

the United States owes its  
power and incredibly high  
standard of living to the  
fact that we use 60% of the  
world's natural resources.  
Both inside and outside of  
the US, the fundamental con-  
tradiction between the colo-  
nizers and the colonized is  
exploding. The struggles of  
the people of El Salvador,  
Palestine and Namibia; the  
Puerto Rican people fight-  
ing on the island and in the  
US; the growing numbers of  
Black, Native and Chicano  
Mexicano people in the US  
fighting for self-determina-  
tion and human rights--  
all these struggles are the  
evidence that imperialism's  
grip in the world is being  
threatened and weakened. Nat-  

ional liberation victories  
mean that the US loses  
its access to the land, lab-  
or and resources of colonized  
countries. These losses place  
a growing strain on the US  
economy and force the US to  
fight harder to maintain its  
position.

Reagan's answer to this  
crisis is to pour billions  
of dollars into the military  
to strengthen its capacity to  
prevent more national lib-  
eration victories like Viet-  
nam, Zimbabwe and Nicaragua.

His strategy is also to  
beef up the domestic military,  
strengthen the police, the  
B.I.A., la Migra, and the  
prisons to contain growing  
liberation movements at home.  
By cutting back crucial soc-  
ial services like health care,  
education, food stamps and  
welfare, the state is both  
able to finance this military  
build-up and to create gen-  
ocidal conditions that weak-  
en Third World people's  
ability to resist.

The US is also attempting  
to curb the growing milit-  
ancy of Third World people  
by calling it "terrorism",  
mounting a law and order cam-  
paign, and stepping up rep-  
ression. Senator Strom Thur-  
mond recently introduced a  
bill that would restore the  
death penalty to federal  
criminal law. This is the  
same man who, as Governor of  
South Carolina, allowed 26  
people to be executed in the  
electric chair -- all of them  
Black. The number of racist  
and brutal murders and beat-  
ings by the police is on the  
increase in ghettos, barrios,  
and reservations nationwide.  
The rise of the KKK is no  
longer just an isolated  
ultra-right wing tendency.  
All of this is not simply the  
response of a fanatic in the  
White House, but US imperia-  
lism's calculated answer to  
colonized people's demands  
for human rights and self-  
determination.

The crisis of a falling  
economy and increased mil-  
itary spending impacts on  
white workers also. The rel-  
ative stability and security  
that we have experienced as  
white people living in the  
world's most powerful imper-  
ialist nation is being slow-  
ly eaten away. The state is  
attempting to mobilize us to  

movement

identify our interests as  
those of the Empire; to ex-  
pect less while "sacrific-  
ing" more, to put the dis-  
cord of the '60's and Viet-  
nam behind us, to help make  
America "Number One" again,  
the way it used to be.

SO WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS  
HAVE TO DO WITH WOMEN?

The oppression of women is  
crucial to upholding this  
system. Imperialism needs wo-  
men to bear children and soc-  
ialize them to be "patriotic  
citizens". It needs our free  
labor to provide homes for  
its male laborers and to pro-  
vide human nurturance in an  
inhuman world. It needs us  
to be sex objects and punch-  
ing bags, safety valves for  
the rage of men. It needs our  
underpaid labor as a reserve  
labor force. Most importantly  
it requires that women be do-  
cile, fearful, passive, non-  
political and dependent. Wo-  
men's oppression wasn't be-  
gun by imperialism -- its  
history goes back thousands  
of years -- and the roots of  
woman-hating go very deep in-  
to every aspect of this soc-  
iety. This hatred and con-  
tempt is evident in the cur-  
rent attacks against the  
gains made by the women's  

movement.

Imperialism's crisis is  
having direct effects on us  
as women. We are being push-  
ed back into the nuclear fam-  
ily, forced to accept low-  
paying jobs in addition to  
our work in the home, we  
are being told to accept pow-  
erlessness and like it be-  
cause imperialism is in tr-  
ouble and needs us more  
than ever to survive. When  
we look around us, we can  
see this happening: the  
attempt to outlaw abortions,  
the denial of birth control  
for teenage women, the in-  
creasing attacks against  
lesbians -- who threaten  
the foundations of oppres-  
sive sex roles -- the cut-  
backs in childcare facilit-  
ies, and the overall increase  
in sexist women-hating vio-  
lence. We see an organized  
and well-financed campaign,  
supported by government in-  
stitutions, to rip away the  
important gains made by wo-  
men in attempts to control  
our own lives. Every day in  
the newspaper, we read stor-  
ies of women being raped,  

beaten, slashed and put to  
death. The porno industry,  
whose sales out-gross the  
movie and record industries  
combined, shows us images  
of women actually being  
killed on the screen; images  
of women being fed into  
meat grinders on the covers  
of national magazines, and  
sexual rape and molestation  
of female children as enter-  
tainment.

Because they are building  
their family units with oth-  
er women instead of with men,  
lesbian mothers are routinely  
denied custody of their own  
children, a practice recently  
upheld by the Supreme Court  
in its decision to take away  
a lesbian mother's six-year-  
old daughter. Women's jobs  
are poorly paid and oppres-  
sive, and the few women who  
manage to break into the  
more highly paid, tradit-  
ionally male jobs, are met  
with constant harassment and  
violence on the job.

Most progressive women  
understand that there are  
connections between the rise  
of the right and the increa-  
sing attacks on Third World  
people and on women. We are  
not surprised when we come  
across the likes of Arizona  
State Representative Jim  
Ratcliff, a noted "Right to  
Lifer". He recently conce-  
ded that he could see one  
situation where a woman sh-  
ould be allowed to have an  
abortion; "If she were im-  
pregnated by a colored rap-  
ist." But we need to be clear  
about these connections as  
President Reagan was when  
he said in a speech pledging  
to outlaw abortion, "We do not  
have a separate social agen-  
da, a separate economic  
agenda, and a separate for-  
eign agenda... we have one  
agenda." We need to under-  
stand that US military inter-  
vention, eliminating benefits  
for brown lung disease, the  
drastic reduction in food  
stamps, the increase in rape,  
police brutality, the forced  
sterilization of Third World  
women, inhuman prison cond-  
itions, denial of full part-  
icipation of disabled peo-  
ple in the society, are all  
different aspects of the  
same system: US imperialism.

That system is our enemy  
as women, as lesbians, as  
mothers, as workers and as  
people committed to fight-  
ing against the oppression  
of colonized people. In or-  
der to develop an effective  
strategy to fight against  
women's oppression we need  
to fully understand that  
this system is responsible  
and that no true women's  
liberation will be possible  
without the destruction of  
US imperialism. We are going  
down dead-end streets when  
we primarily define our en-  
emy in terms of bad ideas  
like racism, sexism, and  
classism; ideas that we can  
struggle with internally  

and eventually defeat by pur-  

ifying ourselves as indiv-  
iduals. These bad ideas have  
a material basis in the world  
and won't go away until the  
system that maintains them  
is destroyed. There is no  
solution to the world's con-  
tradictions in creating small,  
safe women-only spaces.  
These spaces can give us  
strength and renew our en-  
ergy, but male supremacy,  
white supremacy, war and  
revolutionary struggle con-  
tinue and they will not le-  
ave us untouched. Yes, it is  
important to struggle against  
our own personal racism,  
sexism and classism, and yes  
women's space is important,  
but if we stop here and do  
not challenge the system it-  
self, our struggle for our  
liberation will not succeed  
unless we name our enemy  
clearly, challenge it head  
on, and deal with it once  
and for all.

NAMING OUR ENEMY

Fighting against rape and  
pornography, for control  
over our bodies, for lesbian  
rights, and equal pay and  
job opportunities are cruc-  
ial to our survival, and  
must continue to be fought  
for -- but we need to do  
this work in a way that rec-  
ognizes what the entire US  
system is really about. The  
fight against rape is one  
example of why we can't de-  
feat an enemy if we don't  
identify it correctly. We  
can see how the state wants  
us to confine our struggles  
to channels that don't chal-  
lenge the system, and how  
it has succeeded.

In the late '60's, at the  
beginning of the anti-rape  
movement, women clearly un-  
derstood that male suprem-  

Puerto Rican Independence

acist violence was the cau-  
se of rape and that the pol-  
ice were no answer to that  
problem. In fact, there was  
a general dislike, often hat-  
red, of the police that in-  
fluenced our practice. Such  
an anti-rape movement posed  
a real threat to imperialism.  
But at about the same time,  
the Law Enforcement Assis-  
tance Administration (LEAA)  
was created as part of the  
state's response to the rev-  
olutionary movements of  
Black, Puerto Rican, Chicano,  
Mexicano and Native people  
during the '60's. LEAA's  
purpose was to strengthen the  
police capability to milit-  
arily contain these growing  
national liberation movements.  
One method it used was to re-  
cruit civilians to support  
and actively aid the police  
in getting this job done.  
With this goal in mind, LEAA  
provided funding and "sup-  
port" to the anti-rape move-  
ment. By encouraging women to  
deal with rape through the  
“justice system", LEAA killed  
two birds with one stone. It  
not only mobilized women to  
collude with the state in  
repressing Third World  
people, it also coopted a  
large part of the anti-rape  
movement by channeling it  
into non-threatening forms  
of struggle. Despite fierce  
struggle within the women's  
movement, the state was able  
to divert a large part of a  
progressive struggle into  
collaborating with the pol-  
ice because many women be-  
lieved that we could win our  
liberation (or at least part  
of it) within the system.

In a white supremacist  
society like America, where  
the prisons are full of  
Third World people, working  
on terms set by the state  
leads to racist attacks on  
Black men that echo their  
history of being lynched on  
the pretext of defending  
white womanhood. (There is a  
long history in this country  
of Black men being framed  
for supposedly raping white  
women, and then either being  
lynched or imprisoned. This  
is done not because of a  
commitment to fight rape,  
but because of a commitment  
to kill, terrorize, and im-  
prison Black people.)
