But Drunk, She Was Somebody Else

I would have to get the man-
ager to cut the lock and I
would always think we would
be kicked out.

I remember just having come
home, cut the chain off and
there would be blood, she ma-
naged to get blood everywhere
it seemed, she was always

puking and she always had

diarrhea. It would be all
over the walls and there would
be this nice apartment with
fecal matter gone berserk,
And she was always drinking
tomato juice or V-8 juice
with vodka and puking and you
couldn't tell the V-8 juice
from the blood and I would
clean it up, I was very duti-
ful. I spent so much time,
when I wasn't doing my home-
work, cleaning up the walls
and the sheets. Sometimes she
would try to kill herself in
front of me and I would wras-
tle for the razor blades. She
was strong, she never weighed
more than 99 pounds but she
was strong. I remember when
she still had the rights to
my father's house and my fa-
ther would hear that she was
drunk and would send the men
in white to get her and she
really wrestled with them and
gave them a hard time, she
was that strong. I can only
remember once that they put
her in a straight jacket but
I can remember many times
their coming over and giving
her a shot and taking her
away, whether it was thora-
zine or not. She got a lot of
electric shocks, I remember
rolling her hair and she had
bumps all over her head. Even
when she's not drunk, I don't
think she is ever normal any-
more, with all that she has
gone through. There hasn't
been a year gone by that she
hasn't been in the hospital
for a duration, on the psych-
iatric floor, whether for a
week or 5 months. The first
time she was committed she
went far away but still in
Florida and I wrote her a
letter every day. She was
there for about 3 months and
I would bake her cookies reg-
ularly and send them in the
mail and once I baked her a
coffee cake and sent it.

When I lived with her alone,
I called the doctors a lot.
I hated the psychiatrists but
when she was bleeding, blood
coming from her wrists and
everything, I guess I called.

I must have spent a lot of
time between the time I was 12
and 14 talking to the doc-
tors on the phone and trying
to arrange something for her.
When I was a senior in high
school we were living in this
house and my views about
things were changing. I was
reading the newspapers every
day and reading all these mag-
azines and I was just talking
about the state of the count-
ry. That maybe was the first
thing that started alienation
between my mother and me, bla-
tant alienation. We started
not liking each other. I
wasn't living with my mother
during this time because some-
times she was in the hospital
for too long a time and I had
to go home and also my father
was fighting for custody and
he got custody and so I had
to live with him for some
time until I couldn't stand
it anymore and I would run
away. I remember when I was
living at my father's house
and being a teenager maybe

That Horrible Emptiness

Hillary Schiff

Institutions. Warehouses
for people. Women, spending
meaningless days preening. Or
sitting, feeling sorry for
themselves. Or fighting. It's
usually the older ones who
fight. Over nothing- a bowl
of cereal, some stewed prunes.
Sometimes one may lash out at
an innocent bystander.

There are classes in good
grooming, but the results are
often bizarre- round, rouged
cheeks, and overcaked eyesha-
dow and foundation. Clothes
are ill matched because of
fitful attempts at style.
Often the clothes are second
hand. (Facilities for clothes
care vary from ward to ward.)

So many of the folks don't
even care. The walls and bar-
red windows do nothing to
raise self-esteem. The result
is the reverse. (What good is
it, this is only the Hospit-
al?) New clothes can be had,
from the storehouse, but you
must take what you get, even
though it's free.

To meals, to recreation,
people are driven like sheep.
Like Pavlov's dogs. There are

15 or 14, and my mother would
call me and she would be drug-
ged out and she would say she
had razor blades there and
she would kill herself and
she had so many pills and

she was going to kill herself
because nobody loved her.
Even as early as that I was
getting pissed off. Those
were my most torn years be-
cause it wasn't complete

love anymore and yet it wasn't
complete apathy like my sis-
ter who was living at home
and who thought my mother
was awful and couldn't care
less what happened to her.

My mother would call me and
in so many words would say
"You've got to prove to me
that you love me or I'm
going to kill myself" and
I got to hanging up on her
and she would call back and
call back and then when I got
to be 16, 17 and was in high
school there were more things
besides her drugs that got
between us like politics,

and I wasn't a happy child

scheduled activities, even
libraries- Occupational Ther-
apy, Community meetings, some
Poetry Therapy too. The books
are plentiful, and good, but,
reading is all but impossible-
the bars, the walls, the rack-
et, that horrible emptiness
of time, of purpose.

The medication blears the
eyes, makes sunlight all but
unbearable- from dilated pup-
ils. The body grows rigid,
not from tension, but from
the drugs. (And the shrinks,
who give less than a minute
to each woman, insist on pou-
ring on those drugs, to make
a person relax. Or, to cure a
thought disorder, the result
fuddles, rather than helps;
try to add a column of figu-
res while on it.)

They didn't always blatant-
ly coerce a woman into the
traditional role, but, the
pressure is there. Hints here,
hints there- free makeup from
Good Grooming, free clothes
from the Association. The pro-
ddings can be blunt, too-

"Change your dress," "Clean up
the dorm," "Make your bed ov-
er," or vicious barbs about
your figure.
The t.v. babbles incessantly
all day, a steady diet of
cartoons and soaps. The gang
sits like zombies, minds div-
ided between themselves and
the twaddle on the screen.
Most of them receive no the-
rapy outside of Community Me-
eting, and drugs, drugs, and
more drugs. Unless they are
on stuff like Artane or Cogen-
tin, anti-parkinsonians- the
results can be bizarre- twitch-
ing rigidity, and glassy
eyes. And mental vacancy. No
exercise, tons of starchy
foods expand figure unhealth-
ily. Compounded by the drugs
that slow the metabolism, and
take away the period, bind up
the bowels and make one gassy.
No real preparation for life
on the outside, other than
the Occupational Training Ce-
nter- Which is 90% piecework-
packaging, stuffing envelop-
es- an affront to a woman
with a brain- no real train-
ing for anything- and living
skills for those on Level C.
A person loses her ability
to function on her own-
always waiting to be told- a
self-starter is often discou-
raged. Once so institutional-
ized, it's all but imposs-
ible to grow whole, again....
