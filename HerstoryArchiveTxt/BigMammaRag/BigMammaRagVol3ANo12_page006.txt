Senate Bill 1

Repressive Bill Under Consideration

Termed an “unparalleled dis-
aster for the system of individual
rights in the United States” by
professors of both the Harvard
and Yale Law Schools, the
passage of U.S. Senate Bill 1
would “incorporate into the
criminal code every restriction
upon individual liberties, every
method and device that the
Nixon Administration thought
necessary or useful in pursuit of
its fearful and corrupt policies.”

The Commercial Appeal, a
Memphis paper, has called the
bill “dangerous,” the Los
Angeles Times “an assault on
the people.” Both
characterizations are imminently
true. S.B. 1, a book-length
revision of the U.S. Criminal
Code, is 753 pages in length
(long enough that most of the
Congressional representatives
who will vote on it will not bother
to read it in its entirety). It is an
inherently unamendable docu-
ment and consolidates 2 bills
from the 93rd (1974) Congress:
S. 1, the Minority Report by out-
voted Senate members of the
Brown Commission on Reform
of Criminal Laws, and S. 1400,
Nixon's “law and order” rewrite
of the Brown Commission
Report.

In 1973 and 74, the Judiciary
Subcommittee on Criminal Laws
and Procedures took over 8,000
pages of testimony on these 2
bills — with practically no press
coverage. (The Brown Commis-
sion Majority Report was never
introduced in the House, as H.R.
333, but the House Judiciary
Committee has held no hearings
on it).

At this writing (mid-October)
the consolidation, S.B. 1, was
about to move from the Sub-
committee into the full Senate
Judiciary Committee for con-
sideration. By November 1st, it
may well be on the Senate floor.
(The identical House bill is
H.R. 3907).

It is critical that pressure be
put on all Senators to vote
against this bill and, immediately,
that members of the Senate
Judiciary Committee hear from
everyone possible what a
repressive piece of legislation it
is. It should not be rewritten or
amended; it should be scrapped.
Obviously, the implications of
S.B. 1 affect the women’s move-
ment and every woman pro-
foundly. Read the following
summary of the bill's more
repressive aspects (written by
the National Committee Against
Repressive Legislation) in light
of the recent and continuing
grand jury intimidation of the
lesbian community across the
country, and the current haras-
sment to varying degrees of
every segment of the feminist
movement.

Death Penalty

Attempts to circumvent 1972
Supreme Court decision which
held capital punishment to be
“cruel and unusual,” because
“so wantonly and so freakishly
imposed.” Would provide man-
datory executions for certain
crimes under certain conditions.

Leading A Riot

Redrafts 1968 law. Provides 3
years/$100,000 fine for
“movement of a person across a
state” line in the course of con-
summation of a “riot.” A “riot”
could involve as few as 10
participants who create “a grave
danger of imminently caus-
ing” damage to property. In-
vokes federal jurisdictional in-
volvement down to level of
bar-room frays.

Secrecy

Reverses democratic decision
making under the Constitution
by substituting government
secrecy for the freedoms
guaranteed by the First Amend-
ment. Provides 3 years/$100,000
fine up to death penalty to
prohibit public access to
“national defense information.”
Expands criminal sanc-
tions to enforce the Adminis-
tration’s classification of
documents. Provides life im-
prisonment up to death penalty
for communicating “national de-
fense information” with the
knowledge that it “may be used
to the prejudice of the safety or
interest of the United States, or
to the advantage of a foreign
power.” (Exposure of govern-
mental corruption by news
reporter?) Provides 7 to 15
years/$100,000 fine for com-
municating such information to
a person “who s/he knows is
not authorized to receive it.”
(Ellsberg & Russo?) Provides 7
years/$100,000 for a person
who receives such information
and “fails to deliver it promptly”
to a federal agent. (N.Y. Times or
Unitarian/Universalist Beacon
Press, re Pentagon Papers).
Would extend suppression of
information to the ultimate,
providing 3 to 7 years/$100,000
fine for passing vaguely defined
“classified information” to a
person who is not authorized to
receive it.” laws.

Wiretapping Insanity

Reaffirms 1968 law, including
ambiguous Presidential authori-
ty to wiretap domestic activities
where a “danger to the struc-
ture” of the government can be
alleged. Through changes in
existing statutes, expands wire-
tapping authority. Continues 48
hr. “emergency” taps without
court approval. Directs tele-
phone companies and landlords
to cooperate “forthwith” & “un-
obtrusively” with government
wiretappers, and provides com-
pensation for same.

“Sedition”

Redrafts 1940 Smith Act used
in Truman-McCarthy era witch
hunt trials, until made in-
operative by ‘57 Supreme Court
decision. Provides 15
years/$100,000 fine for
allegedly inciting “other persons
to engage in imminent lawless
conduct that would facilitate”
the destruction of the federal or
any state government; and, 7
years/$100,000 for a member
of an organization who “knows”
his or her group has such a pur-
pose. Greater jeopardy to
protected speech when com-
bined with “Conspiracy.”

Entrapment

Permits conviction of defen-
dants for committing crimes
which they were induced to
commit by improper pressures of
police agents. Burden on defen-
dant to prove “unlawful entrap-
ment” and “not predisposed.”

Immunity

Reaffirms ‘70 “use” immunity
law, allowing indeterminate
sentence to supersede privilege
against self-incrimination.

Contempt

Penalty for refusal to
cooperate with Congressional
Committees, e.g. Senate Inter-
nal Security Subcommittee
(Eastland), increased from 1
year/$1,000 to 3 years/$100,000.

Demonstrations

Virtually every kind of civil
rights, peace & other protest
action would be threatened with
severe penalties under series of
vaguely drafted infringements
on right of assembly, including
right to demonstrate adjacent to
“temporary residence” where
President may be staying.

Sabotage

Admits insanity as defense
only if the mental defect caused
a lack of “the state of mind
required as an element of the
offense charged.” Returns law
to century-old primitive state.

Hand Guns

Adds 5 year sentence to al-
ready severe penalties provided
for armed offenders, but rejects
Brown Commission’s recom-
mendation to inaugurate effec-
tive national control of hand-
guns.

Confessions

Allows acceptance of “volun-
tary” confessions even if ob-
tained by police in absence of
counsel, and Miranda warning
to protect the innocent. Allows
admission of eyewitness
testimony regardless of prior
police irregularity in suggesting
identifications.

Watergate Crimes

Would inhibit prosecution of
wrongdoing by “public ser-
vants” if illegal conduct is result
of “mistaken” belief that it was
“required or authorized,” or
based on “written interpreta-
tion issued by the head of a
government agency” (e.g. from a
President?).

Sentencing

In addition to reinstating the
death penalty, and contrary to
the recommendations of the
NATIONAL COMMISSION ON
REFORM OF FEDERAL
CRIMINAL LAWS, S. 1 imposes
harsh, retributive prison sen-
tences and fines for many
crimes; fines for all felonies are
increased to $100,000; sets
mandatory minimum sentences
with no chance of probation for
certain offenses, thereby
eliminating judicial discretion to
consider defendant's record.

If this bill passes either or both
houses of Congress, it will mean
a giant step toward a police state
and totalitarianism in this coun-
try. I am not one who believes in
the ultimate value of writing to a
Congressperson, but I am con-
vinced that Congressional of-
fices should literally be flooded
with mail about this atrocity.
S.B. 1 is an extremely frighten-
ing piece of legislation.

Dyke Elected Homecoming Queen — “I just heard the booing and
figured I’d won,” said P.M. Duffey-Ingrassia, probably the first open
lesbian feminist ever to be elected a homecoming queen. The
coronation of Ms. Ingrassia took place on October 18, at the University
of New Mexico before a crowd of 15,000 spectators. When the new
queen crossed the football field, a tomato flew past her right ear and
many of her supporters were bombarded with beer cans and obscene
remarks. The governor of New Mexico, Jerry Apodaca, was supposed to
crown the new queen, but he backed out at the last minute with no
comment. Ms. Ingrassia was also uninvited to the homecoming dance,
an event where she should have been the guest of honor. Duffey, who has
a history of feminist activism, decided to run for the dubious honor of
queen in order to make the point that “we're here to be dealt with.” It is
reported that her campaign to become the president of the student body
is gaining momentum. My, my, looks like this world is just going to the
dykes. (Lesbian Tide, Nov./Dec. ‘75)

That'll Knock His Socks Off — The Oklahoma legislature tried to pass a
law giving a married woman the right to regain her maiden name after a
divorce. An amendment was then added which gave the woman all of
the couple's property rights — right down to hubby's pipe and socks.
The bill's sponsors, however, said that wasn’t exactly what they wanted
and the state supreme court declared the proposed law un-
constitutional anyhow. Nice try Oklahoma! (Free For All, Oct. ‘75)

Cher Left Sonny for a Woman — Did you know that Cher Bono left cute
little Sonny for a woman? (Did you care?) Anyhow, here are Cher’s very
words: “People ask me if I left Sonny for another man. I tell them no. I
left him for a woman — me.” (VOW Newsletter, Oct. '75)

It Wasn't This Trend — Although many people these days believe
there’s a trend toward fathers helping their wives with the kids, a report
in the National Observer says that's all a lot of baloney. Middle-class
fathers asserted in interviews that they spent at least "an average of 12
to 20 minutes a day playing with their one-year-old infants.” Actual
observation, however, revealed that they spent an average of 37.7
seconds per day interacting with their babies in any way. (The National
Observer, Oct. 18, ‘75)

Tell Us in Three Million Words or More — The Federal Paperwork
Commission has issued a “briefing” book on its goal of reducing
bureaucratic paperwork. The book is three inches thick. (Free For All,
Oct. '75)

P.S. — The response to my request for a new name for this column has
been overwhelming... Well, I did get one letter. Susan H., who
claimed she “had not planned to devote much energy to relieving my
boredom,” (I was tempted to tell her not to worry) sent in the following
suggestions: Splinters, Sticks and Stones, Scraps from Mama's Table,
In a Word, Barbed Wire, Flashes in the Pan, To Laugh or to Cry, Bowl Me
Over, Without a Stitch, If the Shoe Fits. Susan says that, “Chances are
the mental faucet will keep running.” What about all you other faucets
out there? (Seriously Susan, I do appreciate the ideas and right now it
looks like I'll probably use one of them.)

Disadvantages Outweigh Benefits
Title Twenty Examined

This article is part of a longer one
particularly help working
written by Workers and Parents
families in states with very low
United for Daycare, a New York
City daycare organization. We
are reprinting it from the New
York City Star.

Title XX is a new federal law. It
is the portion of the federal
Social Security Act that sets up
eligibility for all federally funded
services, including day care.
Title XX bases eligibility on gross
income (i.e., before taxes or any
other deductions). Families ear-
ning up to 80 percent of a state’s
median income (the midpoint —
half earn more, half earn less)
are eligible for free services. In
addition, each state can choose
to establish a sliding fee scale for
families earning between 80
percent and 115 percent of the
average income. Beyond 115%,
no families are eligible for these
social services.

What Happens Nationwide?

Before Title XX was passed,
eligibility for social services was
defined as “past, present, or
potential” welfare recipients. By
allowing states to serve families
with incomes up to the 115 per-
cent limit, Title XX expands
eligibility. In daycare this will
welfare assistance levels ($700-
800 a year). In these states, even
families making very low
salaries were still ineligible for
day care. Under Title XX, they
are now eligible.

But is expanded eligibility
enough? What is the basic
demand of the daycare com-
munity? More and better day-
care services. Does Title XX
provide for any more money? No!
The national ceiling of $2.5
billion remains the same. The
result? More and more people
fighting over the unchanged
amount of limited services. Un-
less people demand and fight the
government for expanded ser-
vices, Title XX creates a situation
where people are divided and
end up fighting each other.

The new law also includes a
provision that says that 50 per-
cent of a state's Title XX funds
must go to families on welfare or
medicaid or both. This not only
limits the amount of money
available to lower-income work-
ing families, but it also lays the
groundwork for expansion of the
welfare forced-work “training” ~
programs like the WIN program.
