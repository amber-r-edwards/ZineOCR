N.O.W., Woo & Racism

AN OPEN LETTER  
To the Executive Board of the  
National Organization for  
Women San Francisco Branch:

I am writing to protest  
your extremely insulting  
treatment of Merle Woo and  
the Merle Woo defense com-  
mittee. On two occasions,  
Merle was invited by members  
of your board to speak about  
her free speech case against  
U.C. Berkeley. The first  
time, she was told the dis-  
cussion would be tabled till  
later. The second time, she  
arrived at 8 o'clock, as re-  
quested, and was told at the  
door that she would not be a-  
llowed into the meeting.

A few members of the board  
have fought for SF NOW's en-  
dorsement of Merle's case.

We appreciate their work, and  
their understanding of the  
importance of feminism and  
free speech on the job. How-  
ever, other members have  
raised false and vicious al-  
legations about Merle which  
we intend to answer, if given  
a chance to speak.

One such charge is that  
‘Merle is riding on the coat-  
tails of Nancy Shaw' (another  
important free speech case of  
a feminist at U.C. Santa  
Cruz). This charge is ex-  
tremely racist and divisive.  
Shaw and Woo together with  
other fired feminists col-  
laborated on a workshop at  
the National Women's Studies  
Association Conference, where  
feminists agreed that the  
only way to win is to connect  
up the issues and fight back  
together.

Another allegation is that  
Merle has received no support  
from the Asian American com-  
munity. We are interested to  
know that SF NOW is in such  
close touch with the Asian  
American community. To cite  
only a few of the endorse-  
ments: Asian Student Union  
(UCB); Asian American Tutors  
(UCB); Asian Cultural Union  
(NYU); Daniel Tsang, editor;  
Emiko Omori, filmmaker; Mit-  
suye Yamada, writer; Randy  
Senzaki, EOP, SF State; Al  
Wong, Asian American Stud-  
ies, SF State; Eddie Uyekawa,  
former coordinator, Berkeley  
Asian Youth Center, and etc.  
Merle was recently invited  
to speak at a conference at  
Cornell University by the  
Asian American Association,  
and talked about her case at  
a reading sponsored by the  
Asian Student Union at SF  
State.

We hope this list allays  
your fears. Or perhaps by  
Asian community you mean  
Ling-chi Wang, Merle's boss,  
who fired her and definitely  
does not support her case.  
There is a class division in  
the Asian American community,  
as there is in other commun-  
ities and movements, and by  
refusing to endorse Merle's  
case, SF NOW is choosing the  
side of a male boss against  
a working woman of color.

One of your members also  
labeled Merle as 'destructive'  
again appearing to side with  
Ling-chi, who felt that by  
organizing with students and  
other workers, Merle was a  
‘troublemaker'.

Add to the endorsements of  
Asian American groups, the  
wide support of other people  
of color, feminists, les-  
bians and gays, unionists and  
radicals, and it appears that  
SF NOW is quite unique in its  
refusal to stand up for a  
feminist's right to free speech.

Merle is fighting not only  
for herself and other fired  
feminists; her case is also  
seen by the American Federa-  
tion of Teachers as a test  
case for 2,000 other lectur-  
ers, systemwide, whose job  
security and right to organ-  
ize into unions are being  
threatened by this 'four year  
rule’ which is the pretext  
for Merle's firing.

Your refusal to let Merle  
speak, your reluctance to  
support her fight, are inex-  
cusable. However, it is not  
so surprising, given your re-  
cord on multi-issue politics,  
that you cannot see the im-  
portance of an Asian American  
lesbian feminist socialist's  
fight to retain her job.

It is precisely NOW's single-  
issue, reformist politics and  
refusal to stand up for work-  
ing women, women of color,  
and lesbians, that have dam-  
aged your reputation among  
militant feminists. No  
strong defense can be built  
of all women if you are only  
willing to fight on a single  
issue basis for some women,  
and consistently leave out  
the most oppressed.

We in the Defense Committee  
hope that NOW will take the  
opportunity to reverse  
course, defend feminists of  
color and working women and  
lesbians, by adding their  
endorsement to the growing  
list.

Prison Death Camps

- Dear Friends,

I have a subscription to  
your publication and would  
like to inform you of an  
address change.

Please continue to send me  
the paper. I very much  
enjoy it. It is a release  
from the prison routine. I  
was also happy to see that  
you were aware of the latest  
incident in California  
Women's Institution (Aug).  
I was there and I  
knew the women who died. I  
was also there when two  
other women died because of  
the lack of proper medical  
care. Through your publica-  
tion I hope others will be  
made aware of some of the  
prison problems, as they  
don't pertain to just one  
institution, but are con-  
sistently present in most of  
them.

Real Enemies?

Dear BMR:

In your account of the at-  
tacks on the Women's Studies  
Program at Long Beach State,  
(see BMR, Aug. '82, pg 6) you  
failed to mention what it  
was that the right wing spies  
were frothing about. First  

of all, the fundamentalists  
were upset that the course  
was about sexuality. Secondly,  
they were incensed that  
lesbianism was presented as  
a viable sexual orientation.  
Thirdly, among other speci-  
fics, they were upset that  
a recommended text was Pat  
Califia's Sapphistry. Unlike  
your book reviewer, who ob-  
jected to Sapphistry as anti-  
feminist (Constance Perenyi,  
“Sapphistry--Striking Out at  
Feminism 'Til it Hurts," BMR,  
Feb, 1981), the right wingers  
objected to the book because  
it explained, graphically,  
how to engage in lesbian  
practices.

I hope it does not take  
too many more right wing vic-  
tories to get the women's  
movement to wake up and see  
who the real enemies of fem-  
inism are.

In bitter irony,

Reparations Now!

Dear Big Mama,

This November there will  
be an International Tribunal  
on Reparations for Black Peo-  
ple. The Reparations cam-  
paign, led by the African  
Peoples' Socialist Party is  
clearly targeting the U.S.
