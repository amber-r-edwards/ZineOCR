Spreading the Technology  

from page 19  

ARM strategies stress  
taking an aggressive stand.  
We hope groups will share  
strategies they develop with  
each other. Here are some of  
ARM's.  

Combatting “Media Distortion  
of Abortion  

Demanded equal time of net-  

work news to present a de-  
medicalized view of abortion  
in Atlanta.  

Used national pressure to  
challenge a Los Angeles TV  
station which was "document-  
ing" 20,000 "unnecessary"  

abortions per year in the  
city and to demand airing  
of a feminist perspective.  

Filed complaints with the  
FCC in Washington about mis-  
leading and inaccurate cov-  
erage of abortion in Atlanta  
and Los Angeles.  

"Expose the Rose" -- Informa-  
tion about the Anti-Abor-  

tionists and the New Right  
Researched Henry Hyde's  
anti-life voting stand and  
found that he supports the  
neutron bomb and the death  
penalty and opposes school  
nutrition programs, food  
stamp allocation increases,  
and increased social secur-  
ity disability payments.  
Demonstrated national  
support for abortion rights  
by flying a plane around  
Washington D.C. during  
the Pope's mass on the Mall  

which flew a banner stating:  
ABORTION IS A WOMEN'S RIGHT.  

Lobbying  

Met anti-abortion legis-  
lators at the airport with  
picket signs and black  
confetti.  

Educated Congresspeople  
about the simplicity of  
abortion by showing videos  
of counseling, an actual

of Abortion  

Shared information about  
providing later suction  
abortion in a clinic set-  
ting as experienced by the  
Colorado Springs Women's  
Health Services and the  
Los Angeles FWHC.  

Traveled to women's  
health projects, increasing  
interest in Self-Help and  
Menstrual Extraction.  
Movement Building  

Worked in coalitions like  
Abortion Rights Action  
Week where ARM fought for  
a high degree of grassroots  
control.  

Fought for abortion on  
demand by reminding groups  
that every abortion is a  
"necessary" abortion.  

With regret, and the re-  
alization that we did not  
have the woman power, re-  
sources, or commitment to  
maintain a national office,  

the politics of the Abor-  
tion Rights Movement of  
Women's Liberation remain  
and members continue to  
work together as a network  
of feminists to promote  
pro-abortion strategies.  
This network is open.  
We have a phone chain for  
passing on information  
that others can join by  
informing either the Port-  
land Women's Health Center  
or the D.C. ARM chapter.  
We hope we will all work to  
keep communication current  
so that we can continue to  
share our strategies and  
our projects, to respond  
to harassment, and to grow  
together. The work started  
by ARM will continue as  
radical feminists and pro-  
abortion activists con-  
front forces which would  
deny women our fundamental  
ability to control our lives.
