Romance,

Eileen Bresnahan with Judy Barlow, Lori Bradford, Pat Greer, Connie Perenyi, Vicki Piotter, and Kate Sharp

What follows is a brief essay on the
subject of relationships, which was
read aloud to a group of women, and the
discussion that followed.

The theme of this issue of BMR is wo-
men and dependencies. Literally, de-

pendencies are those things that we need

to live--food, water, shelter. Since
no earthly being can survive without
these things, we do not question their
prominence in our lives.

It is the other things--those that we
need, and yet don't need--that trouble
us. One of the primary dependencies
in this category are those that we form
with each other, our relationships.

Our relationships, as primary sources
of comfort, love, and security, tend to
take on an overshadowing importance in
our lives.
on us as political workers--sometimes
positively, more often negatively.

Most women have not learned how to de-
rive as much satisfaction from our po-
litical work as from our loves.

Not that it is inherently bad to be
dependent on others. The women's move-
ment has historically supported collec-
tive structure with its shared respon-
sibilities and interdependencies. But
collectives are many women--where we

self-opinion...It makes good sense.

Vicki: In my experience, when
that's been a factor, it means that
the “mush” doesn't last for months

it's over pretty fast. When I
first came out, I got involved
real briefly with a woman who
didn't like herself very much.
How could she like someone who liked
her? There must be something
wrong with them too, then, to like
her since she obviously felt she
wasn't worth liking.

How

Eileen: I think that happens with
women who have a real problem with
not liking themselves, but what I'm
talking about is just your average,
ordinary, everyday woman. She's
learned, I think, not to like her-
self in a lot of subtle and not so
subtle ways. For example, every
woman who's ever born knows that
a boy child is more valuable than
a girl child--you don't have to be
sick or have any problem with it--
you just know it. You learn as
you're growing up that women are
less valuable. It's inherent in all
women and as I said, I think it's
what makes women into such rock-sta

usually get into trouble is in the pair-

ing off.

In the traditional woman/man relation-

ship, the woman is at the wrong end of
the power dynamic. Since married power
structure mirrors that in society, the
woman, no matter how assertive, must

fight a continual uphill battle against

laws and assumptions that cast her in
an inferior role.

Lesbian relationships offer a greater
chance of freedom from roles, but often
at considerable cost.
like likely than heterosexual women

to be dependent on their lovers for fin-
ancial security.
And since lesbian rel-

ationships are not societally sanctioned,
there is minimal status to be ac-
quired. On the emotional (security-
oriented) side, however, woman-identi-
fied lesbians generally become as bound
as heterosexuals, frequently more so.
This is largely because women are

raised very differently from men. We

are taught to be emotional, loving, giv-

ing; while men are reserved, stoic, en-
closed. In your standard heterosexual
relationship, the man provides a damper
on the romance. But get two woman-id-
entified women together and it can be
mush for months.

This excess of romance is invariably

the product of over-idealization ("star-
This over-

tripping") of the loved one.
idealization is particularly easy for
women since we are taught that we, our-
selves, are pretty worthless. When you
don't think of yourself very highly,
it's easy to imagine someone else as
pretty wonderful by comparison.
The same syndrome that has women out
screeching for rock stars or becoming
religious fanatics often poisons our
attempts to love each other.

Opting for nonmonogamous relationships

frequently helps to diffuse this over-
idealization. When a woman has two or
more lovers, it tends to keep things

more in perspective--she feels more val-

uable herself, and doesn't get lost in

a my-lover-is-the-only-one-in-the-world-

for-me fantasy. Nonmonogamy, however,
is not what we have been raised to.

Some women are far too insecure for it--
jealousy and possessiveness being givens
in this society--and feel safe only with

total commitment. The ultimate sol-
ution, of course, is a society that
raises secure, happy children. In the
meantime, it will be a constant battle
for feminists to keep our individuality
while struggling against individualism.
Or, in other words, to learn that we

are as important as anyone else, but not

any more important--and that the same
applies to our lovers, friends, and
family.

Judy: I'm really interested in what
you said about someone who has a low

Lesbians are less

So, the

groupies...the reason all those
people are women, and that you
don't see men screaming for woman
rock stars, is because women have
really low self-opinions--and so,
they always want to have someone
up there who's bigger than them-
selves.

Connie: We're also always taught
to be someone other than who we are.
No matter what we look like or how
we are, we have to aspire to some-
thing else. Also, in terms of low
self-esteem, when you're loving
other women there's a double-whammy.
First of all you're taught not to
love yourself; then if you love
another woman something really is
wrong with you.

Judy: Because other women are
supposed to be your natural enemies.

Kate: You're loving something in-
ferior when you could be loving a
man.

Connie: Yeah--we've been taught
that lesbianism is infantile--that
it's not as mature.

Judy: I think that whether you have
a high self-esteem or not, that fre-
quently, when getting involved in a
relationship, at least for me, it seems
that the other person has something
that you don't have--or that I don't
have--something that I want in my-
self, whether it be education, or
knowledge, or a good mind, or dif-
ferent experiences. Somehow it
seems that at least my first re-
sponse is to try to incorporate

that as part of a whole real bad
trip--becoming a couple, becoming
one person together instead of two
people individually.

Eileen: Personally, I think that
love comes from seeing somebody

for real, and that romance comes
from something else. Romance has
an element of unreality in it. Why
do people "fall in love"?

Judy: For a long time with me,

up to my first relationship with a
woman, when I fell in love with a
man there was usually some kind of
pity involved--I'd find someone
who was weak--a motherly kind of
thing. I've seen that happen in
women's relationships, too--one wo-
man protecting the other from the
world.

Connie: I think that all plays into
role-playing, too. I think that the
role-playing dynamic between women

traditionally has been so simple to
slip into. I don’t think it's that

different now. It's acceptable,
even between two women, for one
woman to play a stronger role than the
other. I know when I was first
coming out I was attracted to women
who seemed on the surface to be
stronger, because they had charac-
teristics that I hadn't developed in
myself yet.

Eileen: Do you feel that being with
them helped you to develop those
characteristics or just put off your
developing them?

Vicki: And what characteristics?
Connie: This was all pretty superfic-
ial actually--feeling good about being
a lesbian, about being strong and inde-
pendent. Those were things that, on the
surface, attracted me to the woman that
I came out with. But when I got to

really know her, I realized that she was
not feeling good about herself--and that

she was putting a lot of it off on me

and off on other lovers that she had had.

I ended up developing a lot of strength
through my separation from her. It

really helped me identify a lot of things

that I did like about her but that I
didn't like also.

Judy:

strong or equally weak or whatever--
just from Lori's and my experience we
found at one point that it was okay for
one of us to be having a bad time--an
emotional bad time--or having a real
struggle. But it wasn’t all right when

both of us were having a struggle at the

same time.

Lori:
too much--it got to be all too much.
It was easier if one person could be

strong and give the other person a chance
to be weak. While the one person who was

strong was being real martyr-like the
other person could go on and be whimpy-
like. We could take turns.

Judy: But we could both be strong or

one or the other of us be weak. But
it was really disastrous when it happened
simultaneously. Sometimes we weren't

even aware that the other one was having

a struggle...so when we went to each
other for support, you're so engrossed

in your struggle that you don't have the

energy to give to your lover. It's a
dependency in a relationship, at least
for me, to have someone who's going to
emotionally support me.

Lori: Either that or give you some ed-
ucation. I felt like my first lovers

were giving me some things that I needed
to know--either about sex, or...my sense

of naivete that could be broken down if
I carried on long enough with this per-

son--so I wouldn't feel so vulnerable to
the rest of the world in general either.

Vicki:
relationships would you see it as being
a trade-off--that you, too, had some-

thing that the person you were involved

with could take from to help them in the

world?

Lori: No, not necessarily.

out for something. I don't really know

Connie: Were you aware of that one-
sidedness?
Lori: On some level, I'm sure. Some-

times it was okay and other times, de-
pending on the situation, it was not
okay.

Judy: It's hard...I had a short rela-
tionship with a woman who's 30 years
older than me. I always felt really
inadequate, like it was not balanced,
not just because of age but because she
was my teacher--in the classroom--and
it carried over into all aspects of the
relationship. If we had sex, she would
make love to me and only if she was rip
roaring drunk would she let me make
love to her. I was real conscious all
the time that I was real inferior. She
was stronger because she didn't need
me to make love to her when I needed
it--she was above all that. In some
ways I loved her because she was above
all that. But when I got away from the
relationship and looked back I real-
ized that she was miserable and hated
herself so much that the only way she
could deal with life was to be drunk
all the time. Then I felt sorry for
her and realized, in the long run,
that I had more going for me than she
did.

Vicki: It's interesting that...the
fact that we are sexual beings is so
often seen as a sign of weakness. I
was involved with a woman, too, who
could not be made love to--it only
lasted two weeks...It was seen as a
sign of weakness and, the strong,
"male" one--the one who had incorporated
those values that Eileen was
talking about--that puts the damper
on romance--is the love-maker, that
makes it all happen--taking care of
my weakness or whatever.

Lori: How are we talking about rom-
ance? Are we talking about romance
in the sense of fairy tale type ro-
mance, or what do we mean?

Vicki: I see romance, as compared to
love--if it's romance then you aren't
responsible. It's something that
happens magically, that you have no-
thing to do with. -

When you were going through those

I felt that

Kate: The romance has a life of its
own?

Vicki: Right.

Connie: You mean an implied lack of
control.

Eileen: So if you blow off your pol-

itical project for six weeks while
you're getting into this romance with
this other woman, the rest of the
world is supposed to understand be-
cause you've just fallen in love.

Connie: It's not just that. It also
means not having responsibility to
each other--in terms of getting to
know each other. Like Kate said, the
romance has a life of its own, it
will take care of everything--so
there's no basis for communication.

Vicki: Whereas, with love, I think,
it's really different in that it's
much more empowering than romance
because you're very actively involved.
When I feel love, I feel me--I'm
really integral to what's going on.
Whereas, with romance it's not me so
much as just coincidence--it could
be any one person who would be going
through certain motions who would
then fill whatever that romance re-
quirement is. And I think that men,
too, somewhere believe in romance--
not so much for themselves, but that
they use it to keep women with them.

Lori: I think part of the sensual
role of women in heterosexual rel-
ationships is that women are supposed
to be sensual yet innocent. They're
supposed to maintain a real delicate
balance between being erotic but not
being too much like a prostitute.

Pat: It seems to me that we objecti-
fy each other in romance.

Eileen: I think that’s a really good
point. The model of a romantic rel-
ationship is two attractive strangers
who find each other and carry on in
