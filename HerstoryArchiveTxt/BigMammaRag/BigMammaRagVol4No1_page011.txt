Without Love

like bright lights, chaotic intuition, and red wine.  
My head is a spell between numbers cast on spinning wheels.  
I am a sexual being, being obtuse and unfairly neglected.  
Things become so crucial, thoughts, side passes, understatements.  
whispers.  
Will I still be here infinitely burning under this same light?  

There comes this time around every time around running round  
you are all alone in your room hour after hour there is only  
the water in the pipes running down your head  
and the slowness you seem to take in  
almost infinitely at one still point.  

There is only that one fine line between the breakage,  
the head behind your eyes, the focal point that has nothing  
looking from behind it, the shifting of images,  
the pretence of the cosmos, the weirdness one gets into without love.

(you are not my surfboard)  

you are my sister whale  
together we swim to the south,  
our light bellies breaking water as we  
dive more deeply,  
rhythmically,  
into the dark sea  

swimming, we elude the men who  
seek to haul us in,  
impaled upon the point of  
their harpoons.  
they want us for our warmth  
They hunt and kill us because their  
bodies have no warmth in them.  

You are my sister whale.  
Together we swim  
calling to each other  
into the south.  

We carry inside of us and  
clinging to our breasts  
our progeny.  
We will save ourselves from extinction.  

Calling the night waters to open to us,  
we sing to each other  

in the old way,  

mysterious tongues.

Driving me home she said  

she wanted a falcon tattoo  

diving  

wings across her right shoulder  

talons hooked for her spine.  

I thought she didn't need it  

with her hooknose  

sunbleached hair  

turquoise eyes  

like windows to another sky.  

Her hand in mine  

her foot paused over the gas  

she regarded me  

like a falcon  

one claw tangled for a moment  
in the hunter's net  

and then ripped free

This Kitchen Table  

We sit and parch  
Like two old women on a park bench around this kitchen table  
Even the death of Christ loses its lust.
