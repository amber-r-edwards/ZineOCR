Indians Whiterock And Peltier Staying Strong

Susanna Smith

On Sept. 7, a member of the  
Leonard Peltier Defense Comm-  
ittee, Paulette Dauteuil,  
spoke in Denver about the  
case of Leonard Peltier and  
of Angie Whiterock. Whiterock,  
a Paiute Indian, has been in-  
carcerated in Oregon Women's  
Correctional Center (OWCC)  
since 1977. Peltier, a Lakota  
Chippewa railroaded for the  
death of two FBI agents in  
1975, is in Marion Federal  
Prison in Illinois.

Angie Whiterock has not  
been allowed to practice the  

traditional Paiute belief  
that women be isolated from  
men during the time of their  
moon (menstrual period). Dur-  
ing their moon, women are in  
tune with nature; their ener-  
gies stronger than the pipe.  
It's a powerful period of  
time and a time of rest and  
prayer and quiet. OWCC also  
refuses to allow Whiterock  
the right to attend sweat-  
house rites. On many occasions  
her beliefs have been ridicu-  
led. For several months one  
particular male guard came  
into her room on days he knew  
she was on her moon.

Boycott Info Old & New

(coll. note: The following  
is a partial list of boycotts  
presently going on in the  
U.S. Most of the information  
is taken from the Boycott  
Census, H#’D1 Box 3445, Nor-  
way, ME 04268. We are always  
interested to receive infor-  
mation and updates on new  
and old boycotts.)

Nestlé's products (this inclu-  
des Libby's, Stouffer's, Mrs.  
Grass soup, Baskin Robbins,  
and, in Denver, the Top of  
the Rockies club): This boy-  
cott is still going strong  
and shows promise of some  
results. Nestlé's has made  

big bucks in Third World  
countries marketing infant  
formulas to take the place  

of mother's milk, under the  
guise that it is more sanitar-  
y. They have not complied  
with the World Health Organ-  
ization Code.

Campbell's (this includes  
Pepperidge Farms): Campbell's  
is beginning to talk with  

the Farm Labor Organizing  
Committee, but has always  
used non-union produce in  

its products.

Fed Coach Lettuce: It looks  
like all the lettuce growers  
are resisting United Farm  
Worker contracts. Please  
watch for the Aztec eagle on  

produce.

Iowa Beef Processors - (owned  
by Occidental Petroleum):  
Local 222 has been on strike  
since June, for unfair labor  
practices, and the IBP have  
not been negotiating in good  
faith--have brought in scabs.  
We're not sure how you can  

identify IBP meat; you may  
have to ask.

Procter & Gamble: (this in-  
cludes Tide, Cheer, Oxydol,  
Bold, Zest, Camay, Ivory,  
Joy, and Dawn): Labor dis-  
putes.

Coors (Herman Joseph's and  
Killian's Red, and Orville  
Redenbacher popcorn are in-  
cluded in this): A long and  
abominable story--union-bust-  
ing, racial discrimination in  
hiring practices, mandatory  
lie detector tests for appli-  
cants (to find out sexuality  
among other things). And the  
Coors family is a powerful  
supporter of many right-wing  
organizations (like the Moral  
Majority). This boycott has  
had a negative impact on  
Coors sales. For more info,  
see BMR, Nov. 1981.

Michelin tires (this includes  
Sears Allstate brand): United  
Rubber workers called a stri-  
ke. These tires are not union  
made.

Texsun and Big Tex Citrus:  
Labor disputes.

General Electric: Involved  
in mining and milling uran-  
ium, fuel rod and reactor  
core fabrication, and nucle-  
ar waste handling. GE is  
selling weapons to some of  
the most repressive govern-  
ments in the world.

Banks doing business with  
South Africa: We don't have  

a list, but most of the large  
commercial banks are involved  
in investments in South Af-  
rica, supporting the racist  
system of apartheid.

Leonard Peltier was con-  
victed in 1977 by an all-  
white jury of the killing of  
two FBI agents. The deaths  
occurred during a shooting  
incident set up by the FBI  
at Oglala, on the Pine Ridge  
reservation in South Dakota.  
Peltier was convicted on the  
basis of fabricated evidence  
and false affidavits obtained

America held hostage  

by threatening Myrtle Poor  
Bear, who has since recanted  
her statements. A writ of  
habeas corpus has been filed  
in Fargo, N.D., with Judge  
Paul Benson, Peltier's ori-  
ginal trial judge, for an  
evidentiary hearing to pre-  
sent new evidence about the  
case. If the hearing is al-  
lowed, the judge would then  
decide if the evidence war-  
rants a new trial for Peltier.

Both these people are strong  
political prisoners, fighting  
for their rights and the  
rights of all American In-  
dians. Their respective sup-  
port groups are:

Latest government figures; compiled by the Right-wing run  
U.S. Department of Labor statistics show a decrease in un-  
employment. Since record numbers applied for unemployment  
benefits during the same period, one might ask-- Where  
did these figures come from? They come from a "random"  
sampling of 60,000 households, mostly by phone. And of  
course, all unemployed have phones, Right?

At the same time, Raygun intends to make further cuts in  
budgets for social programs--medicare, medicaid, school  
lunch programs, and unemployment insurance programs will  
feel the Raygun budget ax cut even more deeply. But, fear  
not, the US Navy need not worry about the fate of their 3  
razzle-dazzle missile cruisers included in this year's budget.  
One of these, the Ticonderoga, has hit the waters with a  
big splash-bang-bang. It is so loaded down with hardware  

that it can't keep up with the aircraft  

carriers  

that it was designed to escort. This,  
porker of a ship, the first of 18  
commissioned by the Raygun admin-  
istration, may not even be able  

to stay afloat in rough waters.

At what cost, you ask? More  
than all the budget cuts  
affecting social programs.  
Meanwhile, Lebanese are  
under the fire of US-made  
weapons. Those who did not  
die in Baygun-Raygun's Nazi-  

type exterminations are perma-  

nently scarred with phosphor burns  
or blinded. All chemical warfare weapons  

bear the words "made in USA."

unemployment?

Is this a tactic to lower
