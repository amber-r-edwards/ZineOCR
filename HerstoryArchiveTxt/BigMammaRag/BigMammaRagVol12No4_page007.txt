Whippings Ended

In January, a martial law
prohibiting women from being
whipped was issued in Pakis-
tan. Women's organizations
throughout the country have
been protesting the kinds of
punishments meted out to wo-
men and had demanded an end
to whipping after a woman
had been whipped for "commit-
ting adultery." A crime only
women are punished for.

For Crying Out Loud

A judge in Milwaukee re-
cently "scolded" a woman who
had been sexually assaulted
for "inappropriate" conduct
when she cried on the stand.
He said her tears were a
“ploy" to gain the sympathy
of the jury and told the wo-
man that if she did not stop
crying, he would dismiss the
case against the defendant.
"I think the female response
to crime, to any tough situ-
ation, is inappropriate in
a courtroom....This is no
16-year-old schoolgirl. The
woman was twice-divorced.
You might say she was well-
experienced in the school of
life."

IBM Bombed

On March 19, 1984, the U-
nited Freedom Front bombed
the IBM corporate office
building in a northern sub-
urb of New York City. IBM
is a death merchant and di-
rectly profits from and sup-
ports the fascist South Af-
rican government, and its
war of terror against the
People of southern Africa.
Armed units of the UFF vow
to continue the attack on
all fronts against U.S. imper-
ialism. This action is dedi-
cated to three revolutionary
fighters who were mur-
dered by the fascist govern-
ment in South Africa on June
9, 1983.

Then They Blame
Overpopulation

The Navy is paying $1,280
for a piece of equipment that
can be bought in a hardware
store for 34 cents. The cost
of a single nuclear submar-
ine equals the annual educa-
tion budget of 23 countries
with 166 million school-age
children.

Classes Boycotted

In a continuing struggle
between African high school
students and the racist min-
ority regime in Pretoria,
South Africa, hundreds of
young people battled police
in the Black township of At-
teridgeville. The previous
week three schools in the
township were closed when
thousands of students boy-
cotted classes protesting
the regime's policy of instal-
ling white soldiers as teach-
ers in the schools. A 15-
year-old woman was murdered
by police and a number of
the students were hospital-
ized for injuries suffered
when police fired tear gas
and charged the crowd.

Extorting Workers

More than two years ago,
the Chicago Transit Authori-
ty (CTA) "borrowed" millions
of dollars from the workers'
pension fund to keep the sys-
tem running. Now, when they
are supposed to be putting
the money back, they made a
new agreement with the union
president to keep the money
longer. So the CTA is paying
people with their own money.
And it is all being done
with an ultimatum--either
accept this or they will be-
gin lay-offs.

Force Threatened

The U.S. government may
soon be attempting another
invasion of the Sovereign
Nation of the Onondaga. Long-
standing American Indian
Movement member Dennis Banks
has been given sanctuary by
the Chiefs and head men of
Onondaga in upstate New York.
Banks faces trumped-up char-
ges and a federal prison
term stemming from a 1973 in-
cident in a South Dakota
courtroom.

The chiefs have continued
to refuse to hand over Banks
and have been threatened with
"Justice" department action
and told that they "can en-
force" the arrest warrant.
Lee Lyons, ambassador for the
Six Nations, told the Guar-
dian, "We consider that a
threat to use the U.S. army
to invade a sovereign terri-
tory." For further informa-
tion, or to offer support,

ort Committee, c/o Indian

Food For None

The city of St. Louis, MO,
is trying to make it illegal
for people to pick through
garbage for food and alumin-
um cans by declaring the
trash to be city property.

Ironically, the punishment
for the “crime“ is a fine of
up to $500.

CIA Mind Control

Canadian newspapers and
magazines have revealed a
scheme by a Canadian psych-
iatrist and the CIA to de-
velop brainwashing tech-
niques on 53 unsuspecting
psychiatric inmates. Dr. D.
Cameron, who had been pres-
ident of the Canadian, Amer-
ican, and World Psychiatric
Associations, had been in-
terested for some time in
ways to "deprogram" a per-
son's personality and found
a willing accomplice in the
CIA, who funneled about
$19,000 a year to Cameron's
clinic in the '50s. To ac-
complish this "brainwashing"
the psychiatrist conducted
experiments which included
electroshock, sensory depri-
vation, doses of LSD, and
"sleep therapy" by giving
the inmates what was called
a “sleep cocktail” that con-
sisted of a combination of

100 mg. Thorazine, 100 mg.
Nembutal, 100 mg. Seconal,
150 mg. Veronal, and 10 mg.
Phenergan.

Nine of the people experi-
mented on are now suing the
U.S. government for $1 million
each. They were never told
they were taking part in the
experiments and they're still
suffering from the effects
of the "treatments." One wo-
man was given more than 100
electroshocks which have
wiped out all memories of
the first 26 years of her
life. Last May the Reagan
administration asked Canada
to withhold documents relat-
ing to the experiments from
the public.

Puerto Rican POW

In Mexico, the trial of
Puerto Rican POW William
Morales has been suspended
because the Mexican police
admitted they allowed U.S.
FBI spies to violate Mexi-
co's sovereignty in arrest-
ing William. Morales was ar-
rested in Mexico in May,
1983. His arrest and torture
were carried out by a joint
force of FBI and Mexican po-
lice. Four countries have
now offered him asylum if
he is released by Mexican
police.
