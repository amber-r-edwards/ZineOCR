"These stories are about working  
women whose daily lives are marked by  
their encounters with evil. Ruth Geller's  
people are so real, so “ordinary,” that  
their heroism stuns me, and I am  
grateful to her for the quiet compassion  
with which she does the writer's job."

‘A novel that reflects the women's  
movement with honesty and passion.  
There are no gimmicks to this book. The  
process of ‘coming to terms’ with  
women's liberation for three main  
characters is what the book is all about;  
and this is what makes Seed of a  
Woman more than a documented  
history of women’s personal and  
ultimately political change. The women  
in the book are all around us - and are  
us - still discovering by trial and error  
the right answers to many of our  
questions. The visions and images of  
these women are those of today. The  
writing in Seed of a Woman is clear, the  
dialogue realistic, and the story leaves  
an impact that won’t go away. Read this  
book.”
