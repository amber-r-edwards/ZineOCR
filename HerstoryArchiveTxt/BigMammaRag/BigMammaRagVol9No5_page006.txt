IUD Build-up

Calcium build-up may be re-
sponsible for causing pelvic
inflammatory disease in IUD
users, according to research
at the University of Texas
Medical Center. Calcium, a
favorable environment for
bacteria to grow, layers it-
self on the IUD. The research-
ers advise women to replace
their IUD every 2 to 3 years
to guard against the infec-
tion. Incidentally, about
50 million women now use the
IUD worldwide.

Who's Who

If you have ever visited
an inmate at a state prison,
driven unknowingly into a
surveillance site or received
a call from someone the po-
lice suspect is a narcotics
dealer, your name may be listed
with the Narcotics Informa-
tion Network of Arizona,
which serves state and fed-
eral agencies in Arizona,
Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada,
Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana.
In an effort to justify its
budgets, the Arizona Drug
Control District listed hun-
dreds of people as associ-
ates of known criminals,
because, said one former em-
ployee, "the more (names)
you get in there, the more
productive you seem to be."
The names included ministers,
children and relatives of
inmates and anyone else, ap-
parently, they happened to
meet in their investigations.
Who said the red squads are
gone in this country?

Bombay Boycott

Women in India, like women
in the U.S., also are protest-
ing violence against women in
the media. In Bombay, the For-
um Against Rape is calling for
the boycott of the film Red
Rose, in which a popular mov-
ie star portrays a charming
rapist who always wears a red
rose. The rapist is seen as a
sympathetic, lonely figure and
the women are seen as either
long-suffering or bad.

Although propaganda that
could incite violence against
minorities or oppressed castes
is banned by Indian law, films
which excuse violence against
women are not. The Forum
Against Rape has been distri-
buting pamphlets outside thea-
ters to discourage people from
seeing the film.

Only A Mom

A key set of genes needed to
convert food energy into a
usable form has been discov-
ered by researchers at Stan-
ford University Medical
School to be inherited
only from mothers. This gen-
etic material of mitochondria,
the tiny energy factories of
living cells, is needed for
virtually every life function,
including cell movement, mus-
cle contraction, the action
of hormones and the produc-
tion of proteins. Well, they
always said there are some
things only a mother can give
to her child.

No Support

In Canada, a 16-year-old
woman has been denied the
right to have an abortion in
the first court case where
a plea was entered on be-
half of the fetus, as well as
on behalf of the father. By
the time the case was over
the woman was three months
pregnant, making an appeal
almost impossible.

In the infinite justice of
the court system, the father,
who is 17 and still attending
high school, is not required
to support the child at all
ever.

Las Locas Arrested

On March 12, in Buenos Aires,
68 relatives of people who
have disappeared at the hands
of the Argentine government
since 1972 were arrested and
detained briefly. Most of
those arrested were women,
part of a group of about 200
known as "Las Locas de Plaza
Mayo," who have gathered ev-
ery Thursday for several
years in the central square
protesting the disappearances
and demanding information
about their relatives.

Pearl Passes On

The inventor of the vaccine
against deadly whooping cough
has died at the age of 90.

Dr. Pearl Kendrick, with her
co-worker and lifelong friend,
Dr. Grace Elderling, invented
the vaccine in 1939, virtual-
ly wiping out a disease that
had taken 6,000 children's
lives in the U.S. alone.

Dying For Christ

Rev. Rene Fabre, a 69-year-
old Catholic priest in France
has recently been sentenced
for suffocating to death an
epileptic teenager. Fabre
exercised his own brand of
sadism to discipline handi-
capped girls in their early
teens who were in his care.

Another 13-year-old
girl died under his charge
in 1976 when he ordered her
bound in a straitjacket and
hung from a wall after she
had interrupted his mass with
incoherent sounds.

An unrepentant Fabre told
the court that he used whips
and other techniques to in-
still "a sense of responsi-
bility" into the retarded
girls. The court sentenced
him to a term of 10 years.

$30,000 Ticket

A federal jury awarded
$30,000 in damages to a woman
who had been strip-searched by
Chicago police after she was
arrested for complaining about
a parking ticket. In 1978,
Mary Ann Tikalsky was arrest-
ed when she tried to protest
a ticket she was given when
her car was parked on a snow-
covered street and couldn't
be driven. It was the first
strip-search case to go to
trial in Chicago; the ACLU
is also representing 191
other women strip-searched
after arrests on minor
charges.

Illuminating Test

A new method of breast can-
cer detection that doesn't
use radiation is being devel-
oped by researchers in San
Bernardino, CA. With this
new method, diaphanography,
a light is shone through the
translucent tissue of the
breast to illuminate its in-
terior. The image is then
seen on a TV screen. Diaphan-
ography can distinguish tu-
mors from harmless cysts
and can detect the dilation
and twisting overgrowth of
blood vessels that sometimes
accompanies cancer.

In a study, the technique
found 52 out of 53 cancers
later confirmed by biopsies.
Mammography, the technique
now in use, which uses radia-
tion, had missed seven can-
cers that diaphanography had
detected and given unclear
findings in five other cases.
