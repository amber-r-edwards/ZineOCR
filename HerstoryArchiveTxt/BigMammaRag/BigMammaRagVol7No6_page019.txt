Photographs and verse illustrate  
the joys of friendship that Haida  
(Hy-da)  
and her friend, a six-year-old Black girl and  
Haida, a 5-year-old White girl wrestle,  
snuggle, do tricks and play together. They agree that "in most  
every way, we're just alike. In this  
world full of people, we like each  
other best."

Aekyung's Dream

Written, illustrated and translated  
into Korean (bilingual) by Min Paek

Children's Book Press

$3.50/paper, all ages

After six months in America, Aekyung  
is very discouraged and doesn't  
want to go to school. This is a  
story about a recently arrived young  
Korean girl, and it centers upon the  
experience shared by most immigrant  
children - that of adjustment to  
an unfamiliar, often hostile and  
bewildering culture. Aekyung struggles  
to learn English; her classmates  
tease her about her differences.  

Gradually her talents and individuality  
are recognized and affirmed  
by her peers, she becomes more fam-  
iliar with the English language  
and she begins to feel comfortable  
in her new country.

Min Paek, the author, was born in  
Korea and immigrated to the United  
States in 1973. She has written and  
beautifully illustrated a story  
which portrays the psychological  
aspects of Aekyung's struggle for an  
ethnic identity in the mainstream  
culture. The book is in both English  
and Korean.

Child of the Owl

$1.50/paper, ages 9-14

Casey, a twelve-year-old Chinese-  
American, tells her own story of  
how she traveled around the country  
with her father while he gambled.  
When he was hospitalized, Casey  
went to live with her grandmother,  
Paw-Paw in Chinatown. It is here  
that Casey learns to understand and  
appreciate her Chinese heritage.  
Previously she had viewed herself  
as an American only; now she learns  
about her mother who died when she  
was small, about her Chinese name  
and the story of the family's owl  
charm. When someone broke into Paw-  
Paw's apartment, stole the valued  
owl charm and injured Paw-Paw, Ca-  
sey set out to find the thief. The  
remainder of the story is exciting,  
touching and informative.  
This is an excellent book: the  
characterization of Casey as a tough  
independent sensitive young woman is  
superb. The reader grows to under-  
stand and appreciate the complexities  
of being Chinese and  
a part of both worlds - American.

Dancing in the Aisles

Deb Taylor

The Berkeley Women's Music Collec-  
tive was in Denver on June 13 and  
gave a wonderful concert at the Uni-  
tarian Church at 14th and Lafayette,  
before about 300 women. Their inspi-  
ring music left us dancing in the  
aisles. Their integrity, musically  
and politically are what make this  
group unique. They write their own  
music and each woman contributes  
her own style. Their songs vary in  
style and content from lesbian love  
songs, to blues, to jazz and biting,  
enlightening songs about Karen Silk-  
wood, the destruction of cultural  
values, and the struggles of our  
lives in political terms.

It seemed to me that people in the  
audience reacted to the music like  
it was the old days - back in 72-  
76: united, confident with a sense  
of group, political identity. There  
was a feeling of optimism and hope  
as we responded to these talented  
musicians. There was a sense of "We  
can do it; we are together. We have  
our music and are surrounded by  
positive, inspiring energy so that  
anything is possible."

The Berkeley Women's Music Collec-  
tive is not into star tripping; they  
are just down-home real folks who are  
talented musicians and who make them-  
selves accessible to all women. It  
is hard for musicians to make a de-  
cent living above the poverty le-  
vel. The BWMC makes $60 a week per  
person when touring. They do not  
perform that often in Berkeley  
(audiences there are saturated) and  
when they do perform it is usually  
a benefit. They make 80¢ on each T-  
shirt they sell and the money that  
they get from their two albums goes to  
pay back the people who loaned them  
the $13,000 it costs to produce a  
record. So they are not getting  
rich.

The quality of their performance  
has improved notably over the past  
few years. Now they work smoothly  
as a group. The respect and love  
they feel for each other is obvious.  
They have been playing together for  
six years and that is a long time  
for any band to stick together.  
(Bands usually break up after five  
years).

Nancy Vogel mentioned that they  
have no contracts to continue play-  
ing together in the future and that  
they may be moving on to other  
things. Hopefully they are just  
burnt out after a grueling nine  
week tour: two weeks in the North-  
west, four days home in Berkeley  
and then 6 weeks in the East. On  
tour they travel in a van with all  
their equipment and five people  
crowded into a small space, often  
driving 500 miles a day.

I mean they don't break up  
tour they give women so much when  
they come through small towns, even  
just for one night. They are a  
political shot in the arm of posi-  
tive energy.

Don't miss their latest album,  
"Tryin' to Survive."

Mary Centa and Nancy Hutchinson  
of Denver opened up the concert  
with wonderful banjo picking, blue-  
grass and some of their own songs.  
They are two of Denver's most com-  
petent musicians and should be encou-  
raged to continue to write and per-  
form their own material. They will  
be playing together July 4 at the  
Three Sisters Bar, 3358 Mariposa,  
Denver.

The concert was a successful wo-  
men's music cultural event; every-  
one benefitted. BMR got $50 for an  
ad for the concert, the BWMC made  
$300 (I don't know how much Mary  
Centa and Nancy Hutchinson received)  
the audience had a wonderful, inspi-  
ring evening, and June Summers, the  
producer of the concert made $90  
for her work. Hopefully there will  
be more concerts like this in the  
near future. They are so important  
for keeping up our morale.

Over the past year I've come to the  
hard realization that all lesbians  
are not feminists. But somehow I got  
the idea that the Leaping Lesbian  
Follies was going to be a feminist e-  
event. I was expecting to have a good  
time but things kept happening to  
jolt me. Like the orange passing con-  
test - what was that? It wasn't fun-  
ny to me - at all. It was reminis-  
cent of junior high school parties  
where we also played spin the bottle  
and had to go into the next room to  
kiss some slobbering jock while he  
grabbed our breasts, smeared our lip-  
stick and messed up our ratted hair.  
It hooked some old unpleasant stuff  
in me, and I imagine other women had  
similar feelings.

I suppose the contests were meant  
to be funny and fun but they didn't  
do it for me. I was really amazed  
when during the bubble-gum blowing  
contest one woman volunteered to be  
a judge by emphasizing the size of  
her breasts. Not just her own ob-  
jectification of herself was shocking  
to me, but the uproarious laughter  
which followed was really startling.  
I thought, "What in the hell kind of  
revolution is this?" It isn't funny  
when men try to make us into bodies,  
things, sex objects, disintegrate us  
into breasts and asses and legs and  
cunts. And it's not funny when we  
do it to ourselves. It's sad and it  
hurts me to see it happen anywhere,  
and particularly sad when it happens  
to be at a presumedly feminist event.

Most amazing of all was the “pussy-  
power" T-shirt at the end of the  
Slurpette "thing." If that had been  
on television, on the regular ver-  
sion of the Gong Show, they would  
have received a thousand phone calls.  
I felt really sick at that point. I  
got the tightness in my chest and  
the nausea that I regularly feel when  
I have to deal with men. I wouldn't  
have thought it was entertaining if  
that act had been done by straight  
women or faggots and I certainly  
didn't think it was funny with lesb-  
ians doing it. That was simply in  
poor taste.

We don't have a lot of our own  
brand of humor, but it is possible  
for us to laugh at ourselves and  
the world without being sexist or  
vulgar. Ain't I A Woman Theater  
Group is a good example of how we can

Lesbian sexual imagery will be  
the subject of a slide presentation  
by Tee Corinne for women only on  
Friday, July 27th. The two-hour pre-  
sentation will start promptly at 8  
p.m. and will be held at the St.  
Thomas Episcopal Church at 2201 Dex-  
ter, Denver.

Corinne, of the Cunt Coloring Book  
fame, has spent many time-consuming  
hours researching and collecting  
these images of women loving women  
as portrayed in the fine arts of the  
past and in more recent images created  
by women. Some little-known works by  
Toulouse Lautrec, Rembrandt and Ro-  
din will be included along with  
early images of women from Asia Mi-  
nor, Greece, India, China, Japan  
and Renaissance Europe. Also fea-  
tured in the program is A Sappho-  
centric Love Story, a warm and gentle  
animation created by Corinne, of two  
rag dolls who hug, kiss, undress and  
caress each other.

An artist and photographer in her  
own right, Corinne may be best known  
for the widely distributed Sinister  
Wisdom poster which depicts two  
women tenderly making love. She is  
also responsible for the labia pho-  
tography in a recent book about  
women-loving called I Am My Love,  
which was published by Down There  
Press last year. Local women may  
know Tee Corinne as the artist who  
drew the cover art for Berrigan,  

enjoy ourselves wholesomely and  
tastefully. They had me laughing so  
hard I cried. Rona, Paula, Sandy and  
Jane take an episode that could hap-  
pen to anyone and turn it into an  
uproarious event. They are truly  
sensitive and creative women and  
should be appreciated and applauded.  
Dona Calacone is another woman who  
with her quiet irreverence captures  
our hearts with a girl scout uniform  
and an accordion. Also, Phil's  
wedding song was short but a delight.

All in all I found that the really  
enjoyable performances were too short  
and the ones during which everyone  
went outside for a cigarette were too  
long. A few acts should have been  
gonged - early. It would be nothing  
but kind for the friends of a couple  
of singers to suggest that they  
take up the harmonica.

The dramatic high point of the  
evening was without a doubt the dance  
by the Colorado Springs Women's Health  
Collective. Their high energy and  
positive spirit was truly a wonderful,  
contagious celebration of the differ-  
ences among women, yet demonstrated  
the power of our common bond.
