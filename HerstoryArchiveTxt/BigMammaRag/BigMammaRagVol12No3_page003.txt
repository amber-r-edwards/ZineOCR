MOBILIZATION 1984

As the Spring of 1984 ap-
proaches, the U.S. govern-
ment is becoming increasing-
ly desperate to show results
in its attempt to remove
nearly 14,000 Diné (Navajo)
from their ancestral home-
lands in the heart of the
Navajo and Hopi reservations,
in the Joint Use Area (JUA).
Public Law 93-532 imposes
a 1986 deadline for the com-
pletion of this removal, so
that coal, uranium and agri-
business interests may pro-
ceed with exploitation of
the land. Each year since
1976 Congress has authorized
millions of dollars for that
effort, yet so far only
slightly more than 200 fam-
ilies have moved; 2800 fam-
ilies remain.

Every Spring for the past
several years, once the
roads have become passable,
the U.S. Bureau of Indian
Affairs has started confis-
cating livestock, which eli-
minates the ability of the
people to survive, and thus,
provoked violent confronta-
tions with the Elders on the
land. During the past few
months the government has
run new roads, powerlines,
housing clusters and other
development into the JUA,
despite the wishes of the
traditional people, all in
order to advance the final
partitioning and so-called
"rehabilitation" (industrial-
ization) of the area. The
Spring of 1984 figures to be
an especially dangerous time,
as any incidents may be used
by the authorities as an ex-
cuse to launch a military so-
lution, just as it did in the
Long Walk of 1864.

For these reasons the 1984
Mobilization is being laun-
ched now, in the hope that
those who might be able to
be of assistance, including
students, affinity groups,
solidarity groups and other
concerned persons, can start
to arrange their affairs so
that they can support the
effort.

1. People are Needed at
Big Mountain, to maintain a
vigil and help with the dai-
ly survival needs such as
construction, shepherding,
hauling water and so on. A
continual presence is need-
ed during the Spring and Sum-
mer of 1984 in order to main-
tain security and support the
resistance. Persons travel-
ing to the area should check
in with a support group, the
Flagstaff office or with
Larry Anderson of AIM. Re-
sources at Big Mountain are
scarce, provide for your
own survival needs of food
and shelter, take extra to
share if you can. As a guest
of the traditional people,

respect for their way of
life is shown by your manner
of dress, by following tra-
ditional customs, and by tak-
ing direction from the Elders
and their representatives.
You should travel to the
Survival Camp, where you can
stay, orient yourself, and
be sent to work with a fam-
ily. Workers can also help
prepare for the second Sun
Dance, to be held in August.
START PLANNING NOW. For in-
stance, a particular affini-
ty group could commit to
living and working with a
particular family, and ano-
ther group could commit to
generating support for the
family and the workers.
2. MATERIAL SUPPORT: money
is needed for food, travel
and logistical support. Do-
nations can be sent to the
Big Mountain Support Group
where it will be used to buy
low cost bulk foods and to
provide other support for the
mobilization. Donated supplies
will be shipped to Big Moun-
tain.

3. LETTERS AND PHONE CALLS
are effective. The BIA office
in Phoenix should be told
that we are aware and alarmed
about the activities of their
range officers, who, in the
guise of "range management"
are waging a war of terror
and starvation against the
traditional people whose
very survival and way of life
depends on their livestock.
Write to Area Director James
Stevens at P.O. 7007, Phoenix,
AZ 85011, (602) 241-2305.

Also contact Senators Den-
nis DeConcini (3230 DSOB,
Washington, D.C. 20510, (202)
224-4521) and Barry Goldwa-
ter (337 RSOB, Washington, D.C.
20510 (202) 224-2235), and
ask them to support repeal
of Public Law 93-531, the
so-called "Navajo-Hopi Land
Dispute Settlement Act" of
1974.

SUPPORT MAE WILSON TSO'S
DEFENSE AND THE BIG MOUNTAIN
LEGAL COMMITTEE in Flagstaff.
The Defense effort must in-
crease as the pressure on the
people does likewise. Tax de-
ductible donations should be
made out to the Big Mountain
Legal Fund, and sent to the
Capp Street Foundation at
294 Page St., San Francisco,
CA 94102. Mae Tso has faced
charges since April 5, 1983,
due to her direct actions re-
sisting removal of her fam-
ily and livestock from the
land.

EDUCATE YOURSELF AND YOUR
COMMUNITY, make use of the
resources of the network of
support groups. Literature,
pamphlets, slide shows, vid-
eo and speakers are availa-
ble. You are also invited to
correspond directly with the
Elders via Kee Shay, at P.O.
203, Oraibi, AZ 86039.

It is hoped that all friends
of Big Mountain can com-
mit to some form of support.
Your assistance makes a
real difference, and is need-
ed now. The ability of the
traditional people to survive
and carry on their resistan-
ce, and their way of life,
depends on you. Let us know.

Lunatics Calendar

Lunatic Friends

Thanks for your support
these last 5 years of The
Lunatic Calendar production.
Through the Calendar, I was ab-
le to throw myself out there,
share some ideas/facts/im-
ages, and you were the
souls that responded. Many
of you were faithful users,
many of you sent kind words
of encouragement and praise,
many of you shared ideas and
resources for its improve-
ment and continuance, many
of you were right next to
me. And now the cycle con-
tinues with this ending note
of thanks. The Lunatics Cal-
endar experience has been
a most positive one, and I
thank you all--

New Subscribers

Dear Big Mama:

Your journal is great!
If only I had known of you
before. Plexus (which calls
itself the women's newspa-
per of the west coast)
doesn't print nearly as in-
formative and relevant art-
icles as you do. That's
why I'm sending in forms
for three subscriptions:
for myself (and my house-
mates) and two of my best-
est friends now living in
different parts of the coun-
try -- it will be a good
way to keep in touch.

Thanks.

In Sisterhood,
Sally Thomas

Herizons Mourned

Dear Big Mama Rag,

It was with deep personal
sorrow that I read Sue Doe-
ll's article, "Herizons:
Politics of 'Feminist' Busi-
ness." (BMR--January, 1984).

I was one of the white, mid-
dle class, in this case Bud-
dhist, customers she came to
scorn and felt trapped and
suffocated by. I had to
write because I don't think
Sue knows what Herizons
meant to me. I suspect there
are others who could share
similar meanings, but no
one else wrote. Mothers, so
I am.

Herizons' existence coin-
cided with my exile in a
small, aggressively hetero-
sexual, Colorado, mountain,
resort community. I was
isolated, lost and drifting.
That was my responsibility,
my choice, and a mistake only
available to the privi-
leged. Maybe that makes my
life irrelevant when viewed
from the "correct" politi-
cal perspective but it is
real to me and I was in real
trouble, in a depressed
state I almost didn't climb
out of.

Herizons was an island of
sanity and self-esteem. I
came to Denver once a month
on business and tried to
connect with the community
and lesbian sanity. Herizons
was more than a bookstore.

It was a connection, I could
catch up on events and act-
ivities, concerts and pot-
lucks. I also walked out with
armloads of books, mostly
poetry and fiction, to see
me through cold mountain
nights. All of it was impor-
tant, the poetry as well as
the connection. I know it
didn't end racism, but I
kept going and eventually
got back to Denver, to com-
munity, and new relation-
ships.

I can't sort out how much
I owe Sue for that. I am a
survivor. I can search the
shelves of the boys' book-
stores and find the woman's
section. I can subscribe to
Mama and I do, but Herizons
made a lot of things easier
for me. Even now that I live
in Denver it was a full-time
women's space, which we did-
n't have to share with any-
body, that I miss. R.I.P.
(Radical Information Project)
and Category Six are not the
same.

So the moral is 'correct'
politics or not Herizons
meant a lot that was good,
did a lot of good. Capital-
istic, selfish motivation
or not Sue worked hard to
do something in the world
that was good. There are ea-
sier ways to be selfish than
the way she chose. The pious,
