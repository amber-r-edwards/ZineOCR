The determined struggle of women  
from Union WAGE, News and Letters Com-  
mittee and the Coalition of Workers  
Rights has helped win a new minimum  
wage for California. As of October  
18th it will be $2.50 per hour, up  
from the previous $2.00 per hour. For  
the first time, household workers,  
farmworkers and minors are covered.  
The new regulations affect about 40%  
of California's 8.5 million workforce.

BENEFITS FOR PREGNANT WOMEN

The Supreme Court is expected to  
rule early next year on a case it  
is now hearing on how pregnancy must  
be treated under all employee bene-  
fit programs, including sick leave  
and health insurance. Women employ-  
ees of General Electric are asking  
the court to rule that their employ-  
er include pregnancy coverage in  
disability insurance benefits. GE  
told the Court it does not discrim-  
inate and argues that pregnant women  
are excluded from benefits because  
“women workers are 'malingerers' who  
are reluctant to return to work af-  
ter babies are born."

“SICK & TIRED OF BEING ~~  

SICK & TIRED

One hundred fifty women demonstrat-  
ed September in support of the de-  
mands of 60 women inside the King  
County jail in Seattle, Wash. In a  
petition, the women cited case after  
case where they have been denied de-  
cent medical care, and demanded an  
end to the situation. Dr. Theodore  
Marks, the jail physician, said, "I'm  
dealing with a bunch of crazy, sick,  
irritating people." He said he will  
ignore their complaints.

Meanwhile, as a result of the dem-  
onstration and the continued demands  
of the women inside, a committee has  
been formed to investigate medical  
practices at the jail.

CATHOLIC CHURCH

The San Diego chapter of NOW has  
again demanded that the IRS revoke  
the Roman Catholic Church's tax ex-  
empt status. Church officials are  
asking the nation's 50 million  
Catholics to sign pledge cards “af-  
firming their commitment to the sanc-  
tity of life" and promising to take  
an active part in the anti-abortion  
movement.

NOW spokeswoman, Dr. Katherine Car-  
son, said, "We think that since the  
Church is so politically active, it  
should no longer have the right to a  
tax exempt status."

She said the Church's anti-abortion  
stand is ironic, noting that in San  
Diego, "30% of the abortions through  
Planned Parenthood are performed on  
Catholics, yet the number of Catholics  
in San Diego totals only 20% of the  
population."

WOMEN'S BIKE CLUB

A women's motorcycle club was formed  
in Denver in April this year.  
The club is called Free Spirit, and  
members wear vests (which they call  
overlays) bearing the symbol of a  
dove. Currently boasting six members,  
the club organizes weekend trips and  
is presently working on a benefit for  
the Rachele Yaseen Defense Fund. Non-  
riders are eligible to join, and ride  
with other members. Membership fee is  
$25. Call Miski at 233-3999, evenings.

NEW CRIME

Twenty women in Frankfort, Germany  
were arrested and charged with crim-  
inal conspiracy and organization.  
The women had participated in a pro-  
gram to bus German women to Holland  
in order to obtain safe, legal abor-  
tions. Abortion is still a crime in  
West Germany and the women are facing  
very serious charges which until now,  
had only been used against terrorist  
groups.

WOULD IT FOOL AN  
EARTHQUAKE ?

"Are we doing what I think we're  
doing?" asked an Alaska pipeline wor-  
ker ordered to put an incorrect iden-  
tification number on a weld. “Ask no  
questions," said the foreman. The wor-  
ker, Peter Kelley of Fairbanks, later  
discovered that his suspicions were  
correct: he was involved in a scheme  
to falsify X-rays of welds joining  
pieces of pipe in the 800-mile long  
pipeline. Other X-rays have disap-  
peared in a burglary, and a troublesho-  
oter hired to investigate X-ray irre-  
gularities has apparently committed  
suicide.

The X-rays are used to identify  
faulty welds which could break in the  
event of an earthquake or other shock.  
A break would spill thousands of bar-  
rels of oil, making a wasteland of  
nearby sections of Alaska's fragile  
tundra.

MAGIC MARKER TIME

Dinah Might, an anonymous group of  
women throughout the world, offers  
some sound advice and strategies on  
using graffiti to our best advantage:

Prepare graffiti zaps with care.  
Gather women into safe, consciousness  
raising circles where strategy can be  
planned for the protection of all  
those involved. Have a system of  
warning calls, watchers, doers, etc.  
Be protected and invisible. Suggested  
graffiti messages include "woman pow-  
er;" health information; names and  
pictures of our rapists whether doc-  
tors, lawyers or corporate execs.

Dinah Might suggests that after a  
graffiti zap, women analyze the effec-  
tiveness, the potential dangers, the  
strategy for safety, the methods for  
designing hexes which will enhance  
the power of the graffiti and minim-  
ize the power of the enemy.

VICTORY FOR SPANISH WOMEN

Spanish feminists celebrated the  
acquittal of an accused “adulteress”  
in their fight against male privi-  
lege in extra-marital affairs. A  
court in the city of Saragossa ruled  
in October there was insufficient evi-  
dence to convict Maria Inmaculada  
Benito of adultery. Her husband had  
asked that she be punished by five  
years in prison.

More than 1,000 feminists took up  
Maria's cause and attacked the laws  
that consider it normal for a man  
to have occasional affairs and for  
the same act to severely punish the  
woman with a penalty as severe as  
six years in prison.

NEW BENEFITS

Polish women working in the labor  
force are now entitled to 16 weeks of  
fully paid maternity leave for a  
first child, 18 weeks for the second  
child, and 26 weeks for the third.  
They can also claim up to three years  
unpaid leave during which they retain  
the right to return to the same job  
and have their social security bene-  
fits maintained.

The new Polish labor code also in-  
cludes higher family allowances for  
mothers who choose to stay at home  
and an alimony fund for divorced or  
separated parents.

JANE DOE SETS STRATEGY

Jane Doe, a group of 25 women orig-  
inally aimed at ratifying the ERA in  
North Carolina, now plans to post the  
many faces of Jane Doe in Legislative  
chambers nationwide. The group has  
selected as targets 5 of the 14  
states that have not yet ratified the  
ERA—Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Ill-  
inois, and North Carolina.

The first step in Jane Doe's strat-  
egy is to get newspapers in the tar-  
get states to publish The Jane Doe  
Papers. The Papers seek to answer  
two questions—Who is Woman? and Why  
does she need and want the ERA? Ti-  
tles range from "Black and Female:  
Double Jeopardy" to "A Funny Thing  
Happened on the Way to the PH.D."

Next, in cooperation with Vanity  
Press, pamphlets will be produced and  
distributed to state legislators as  
soon as the new session convenes.

The Vanity Press will release the pa-  
pers in book form, May 1, 1977.

WOMEN BROKE

Women: A Journal of Liberation does  
not have enough money to take its  
next issue (on ageism) to press. The  
organizers are trying to collect  
$3,000 in unpaid bills and to raise  
money by selling back issues. These  
cover a large variety of topics and  
are available for $1 each. Subscrip-  
tions are $5 per volume (4 issues) to  
individuals. Write for a list of back  
issues and send support to the Journal  
at 3028 Greenmount Ave., Baltimore,  
MD 21218.

HOME THREATENED

Michelle Whitnack, the Seattle wom-  
an who is in jail right now for re-  
fusing to bow to grand jury pressure,  
is in danger of losing her house. She  
and the woman with whom she was buy-  
ing the house both stand to spend  
some time in jail on political  
charges, and they can no longer make  
the payments. Their home has become  
especially important to them since  
their lives were disrupted by the  
Government. Money is also needed to  
conduct their legal defense. Send  
contributions to Deep Freeze, P.O.  
Box 12497, Seattle, WA 98111.

WORKERS’ HEALTH ENDANGERED

All 300 women employees of the  
Essex electronics assembly plant in  
Kittanning, PA were furloughed after  
100 of them were stricken with a mys-  
terious illness. “We won't go back  
to work until a cause is found," said  
Shalva Koleck, president of the Uni-  
ted Steelworkers union Local 8259,  
which represents the women. She said  
all the women complained of headaches,  
nausea, and stomach pains. Some repor-  
ted difficulty breathing and five wo-  
men have been hospitalized.

Meanwhile, there is still no expla-  
nation for a similar illness that  
struck 70 employees of another elec-  
tronics assembly plant in Pennsylva-  
nia in September.

MEXICAN ABORTION

The Mexican government has announ-  
ced that it is studying several pro-  
posals to legalize abortion. But gov-  
ernment officials say they are tread-  
ing lightly on the subject because  
of pressure from the Roman Catholic  
Church. The main stumbling block to  
legal abortion, however, is expected  
to be the machismo tradition where  
manhood is measured by the number of  
male children each man fathers.

IRISH PEACE MOVEMENT

Two women leaders of the Irish  
peace movement were punched and kick-  
ed by a mob when they tried to ad-  
dress a meeting called to protest the  
death of a child killed by a British  
soldier.

Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan  
said they are determined to go back  
within a few days to the Turf Lodge  
area of West Belfast where the mob  
attacked them October 11 to explain  
“What we are all about."

The two women are widely known as  
organizers of a peace movement that  
in the past several weeks has gained  
considerable support. Both are Cath-  
olics, but their movement is unpopu-  
lar in the Turf Lodge area where res-  
idents have charged the women are  
backed by the British government. The  
women deny the charge.

BOTTLE BABIES

Women who drink heavily during preg-  
nancy risk greater damage to their  
babies than if they used the now-ban-  
ned drug thalidomide. This warning  
comes from the Centre for Medical In-  
formation at Frankfort University  
which said that one in three women  
who drink regularly can expect her  
child to be born with some kind of  
deformity, eye conditions, deformed  
fingers and stunted growth. Hospital  
officials term the death rate among  
babies born to alcoholic mothers in  
the last two and a half years “alar-  
ming."
