Feminist Therapy

Dear B.M.R.,

I feel the need to respond
to Dee Dee NiHera's article
(in the May issue) concern-
ing ex-mental patients (or
inmates) in the women's com-
munity.

I am also an ex-mental pat-
ient, and share the stigma
that is attached to it when-
ever I speak out about my
experiences. I was hospital-
ized against my will. I am
against drugs, electro-shock
and most hospital situations;
but I feel that her position
(which condemns all therap-
ists, even feminist therap-
ists) is potentially harmful
to women who need help. When
I say “help" I mean therapy
with a sensitive and trained
feminist therapist, not some-
one who calls herself a ther-
apist after taking a few
gestalt classes, and not a
volunteer drop-in counselor
(unless all she needs is
counseling for an immediate
crisis situation.)

For the past two and a
half years I have been in
therapy with a woman who I
trust and respect, a woman
who is helping me re-vision
myself as a whole person.
Through one-to-one therapy,

I have had my needs met in
a way that was not possible
(for me) in "self-help"
groups.

I don't necessarily recom-
mend therapy to everyone; I
do know that it has been a
vital experience to me, and
that we need to support each

other in all our efforts
toward growth and change.

Anti-Semitism

Dear B.M.R.,

While I was glad to see
Lori Bradford's article on
Sisters United in the April
1982 B.M.R., I was struck by the
absence of more than a pass-
ing reference to the anti-
Semitism of this lesbian Chr-
istian Fundamentalist jour-
nal. Although Bradford ment-
ions that it contains "writ-
ings that claim, for inst-
ance, the Jewish people will
be elevated by intermarry-
ing with non-Jews," the sta-
tement that "we urge all fem-
inist media to demand an end

to support" for Sisters Unit-

ed rests only on its "blat-
ant racism (and all the sub-

tle racism, too!), not on its
anti-Semitism. The article
calls on “women to challenge
white supremacist doctrine
every time it happens in the
feminist/women's press"; no
mention at all is made of any
need to challenge anti-Semit-
ism--the word is conspicuous-
ly absent, both in the title
("'Sisters United' Is Rac-
ist") and in the text itself.
Since these positions seem
to be put out, not as Brad-
ford's alone, but as those of
the B.M.R. collective ("we urge
all feminist media..."), it
appears that the collective

has identified racism as ser-

ious enough to confront, but
not anti-Semitism. As a white
Jewish woman who shares the
stated concern with racism,

I would like to know whether
this represents the B.M.R. col-
lective's position. Having
seen the source of Bradford's
article, a letter from Spin-
sters, Ink co-publisher Jud-
ith McDaniel, I am aware that
Judith's criticism was very
clearly directed against both
anti-Semitism and racism. By
dropping anti-Semitism as a
matter for concern, Brad-
ford's article both distorts
the politics expressed in
Judith's letter and dismis-
ses anti-Semitism in the
lesbian/women's community as
a legitimate issue for fem-
inists, Jewish and non-Jew-
ish.

In struggle,
Elly Bulkin

P.S.--I assume that you don't

edit letters to the editor.

Dear Elly,

Certainly you are correct in

your criticism. In the effort
to confront and combat anti-

Semitism, we recognize that it is a serious issue, is life-threatening to too many and must be
confronted along with racism
as it happens.

In B.M.R., Dec.

1981, "Where

We're At", we wrote "frequently
racism and anti-Semitism
arise out of the same sources

in the feminist community: ig-

norance of other than main-
stream cultures, intolerance
of diversity and the attitude
that one race can be superior
to another...We feel that our
analysis of racism has to in-
clude anti-Semitism" specifi-
cally. We re-commit ourselves
and B.M.R. to this politic and
hope that along with the col-
lective, that all our readers
will take responsibility,
through criticism/self-criti-
cism to keep this analysis
clear.

Open Letter

Open letter to readers of
Common Lives/Lesbian Lives:

(a lesbian feminist quarterly)

We CL/LL collective members
made an error in issue #3
which was racist. The bio
which we compiled for Paula
Gunn Allen, appearing on
page 78, omitted the very
relevant information that
Paula is Laguna Sioux.

Here is a more complete

bio, which we urge you to
clip and paste into your co-
py. Without this actual phy-
sical correction, your mag-
azine will perpetuate the
racism of our mistake.
Paula Gunn Allen is a Laguna
Sioux Indian and a Lebanese-
American whose mother's step-
father was a Jewish immigrant
from Germany. She grew up on
a Spanish land grant in New

Mexico.

Semitism & racism in the women's community my editorial nar-
rowing of Judith McDaniel's
letter for Spinster's Ink,
(which did confront racism and

anti-Semitism equally), did not
serve to generate good politi-

cal struggle around these is-
sues--or a clear presentation
of the anti-Semitism and ra-

cism in Sisters United. My edi-

torial action only served to
add to the attitudes of anti-
Semitism and racism in our
communities/media.

Although I edited the arti-
cle, we, the B.M.R. collective
should have caught this error
before it ever went to press
and thank you for your feed-

back. The anti-Semitic focus of
the article about Sisters Uni-

ted does not reflect the col-

lective's position on anti-Se-
mitism. Anti-Semitism is a

We wish to make it public
knowledge that Paula called
one of our members upon dis-
covering this omission and
expressed her anger and chal-
lenged us on our racism. We
know her anger is justified
and appreciate her frank cri-
ticism of us. We are distres-
sed that once again the bur-
den of educating white women
about our racism had to be
borne by a woman of color.

We offer no justifications
for our error. Excuses are
just that: excuses. When we
white lesbians act out our
racism, it is our responsib-
ility to hear the anger and
criticisms, and examine our
attitudes and actions and
take constructive actions to
combat our own and each oth-
er's racist attitudes and

behaviors.

Therefore we ask you, our
readers, to reread Paula's
poem with the knowledge that
she is an Indian and examine
what difference this know-
ledge makes to you.

As we are presently an all-
white collective, we espec-
ially need and welcome your
scrutiny, dialogue and crit-
icism.

In common,

Beth Nugent, Carol Rising,
Cindy Cleary, Lisa Grigg,
Steff, Tracy Moore.

In Germany

To all you wonderful

Most exciting things hap-
pening here in Frankfurt.
U and I went to a "take back
the night" march, which tur-
ned out to be illegal be-
cause they (city) wouldn't
grant a permit- everybody
marched anyway and the cops
came out in full riot gear
& the confrontation finally
ended with them "dispersing"
us with tanks from which
they shot water & quite sca-
ry, actually. Otherwise do-
ing lots of sightseeing- very
frustrating not knowing en-
ough German to have conver-
sations. (Had a dream the
other night, I was there do-
ing production....!)
Love,
Susanna.

oops!
