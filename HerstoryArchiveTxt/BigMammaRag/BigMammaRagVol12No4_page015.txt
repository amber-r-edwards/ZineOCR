Palestinian Women Tortured In Prison

Jewish Women for a Secular
Middle East

Jerusalem, 4th of November
1983. The Headquarters of
the International Red Cross.

“Outside the building all
looks normal, except for the
presence nearby of a large
number of Israeli soldiers
armed with wooden clubs.
But, once you enter the
building, you are met by
groups of women sitting on
the steps leading upstairs
and gathered in the office
rooms.

The women are a diverse
mixture of old and young,
Palestinian and Jewish, some
dressed in jeans and sweat-
shirts, others in tradition-
al Bedouin dress and scarf,
some defiant and angry, o-
thers quietly weeping. What
they all share in common is
their concern for the fate
of the Palestinian women pri-
soners in Neve Tertza prison
near Ramleh.

Conditions in the prison
first started to deteriorate
last June when the prisoners

refused to cook meals for the

prison officers and the ad-
ministration began a cam-
paign of pressure against

them. From then on, radios,
books and newspapers were

forbidden. Visits from rela-
tives were reduced from one
visit every two weeks to
once every two months, and
time out of the cells was
cut from 7-8 hours to 1 hour
per day.

The prisoners went on
strike in protest and their
relatives and Jewish support
groups organized a series of
demonstrations outside the
prison to draw public atten-
tion to their plight. How-
ever, this latest demonstra-
tion at the Red Cross is pro-
voked by news from the prison
of the most inhuman treat-
ment delivered to prisoners
by the authorities. The e-

vents that took place have
come to light as a result of
visits to the prison by Is-
raeli lawyers, Felicia Lang-
er and Leah Temsel. Their
statements are the result of
what the prisoners told them,
and also, what they could see
for themselves inside the
prison to corroborate what
was described to them.

On the 1st of November,
prisoners found out that
the prison authorities were
destroying their library and
they began banging in their
cells as a protest. The auth-
orities reacted by checking
all prisoners were locked
up, then releasing tear gas

into the closed cells.

Tear gas is commonly used
to disperse large crowds of
people during demonstrations
and causes a great deal of
discomfort to those who in-
hale it, even when used in
the open air. It is never in-
tended for use within a con-
fined space and the horror of
this experience on the pri-
soners, locked in their cells
can barely be imagined. Sev-
eral commented that they felt
they were about to die as
they were surrounded by dense
clouds of the gas, which
gives the victim the feeling
that he cannot breathe and
also burns the skin. Some
smashed the windows in order
to put their heads out but
found that they were beaten
by guards. Others who fled to
lie on the floor of the bath-
room were also beaten.

The prisoners were left
for around 24 hours before
any staff arrived to check
on their condition. The type
of tear gas used was a form
of liquid mist, which later
settles as a liquid. Langer
described how this liquid
was dripping from the ceil-
ing, covering the walls, in
fact, all over the prison.
Although the authorities had
told the prisoners to clean
up, they had not provided
any means to enable them to
do it, nor allowed the pri-

soners to clean themselves
or change their clothes,
which were permeated with
the gas.

As for their physical con-
dition, many of the prison-
ers could hardly speak be-
cause of the effect of the
gas on their throat. Also,
Langer noted that, when she
bent to embrace them, she
could see how their skin had
been burnt by the gas. Pri-
son staff were using gas
masks when they entered
these quarters. Their presence
had no dampening effect on
the determination of the
women inside. At the Red
Cross today, the plans were
laid for a public cam-
paign to win support from
national and international
bodies against the brutal
acts of the Israeli prison
authorities in Neve Tertza.

She was suffering from the
mental agony of not being
allowed to see her dau-
ghter and know how she had
survived such an ordeal.
The prison authorities have
refused to allow the Red
Cross to visit the prison
until the 6th of November.

Looking out of the window,
trucks of Israeli soldiers
were sitting nearby to pre-
vent the demonstration from
moving outside and checking
the identity of the people
in and out of the
building. Their presence
had no dampening effect on
the determination of the
women inside. At the Red
Cross today, the plans were
laid for a public cam-
paign to win support from
national and international
bodies against the brutal
acts of the Israeli prison
authorities in Neve Tertza.

Super Tuesday has passed and it's clear who's in
the running for president--another millionaire.
Since they are all millionaires, doesn't that make
you wonder how any politician can understand our
issues?

Have you noticed Joe Coors isn't being mentioned
to take Meese's job? Maybe it was something his
brother said...

Also noticed, Meese ain't smelling like a rose
these days, but then, when did he? His stand on

hunger, Carter's 1980 strategy and campaign papers,
and private undisclosed loans don't make him a hit
on our list.

games in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in
April-May. Old men flexing young muscles.

RayGun's policies seem to be upsetting to enough
people that they want to get close, real close to
him. One woman was sent fast to a psychiatric in-
stitution when she aroused a White House guard's
suspicions. No due process there--no bail, no
public hearing--just a fast ride and out of the
public's eye and protection. Meanwhile the hush
hush boys--Secret Service--were told that there is
no scientifically valid model to predict who will
be assassins. So watch out--we're all angry enough
to load a gun.
