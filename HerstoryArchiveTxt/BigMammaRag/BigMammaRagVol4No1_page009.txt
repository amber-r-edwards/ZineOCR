Convention Plenary Meeting  

After dinner on Friday, the  
entire body of the convention  
attended a plenary meeting of all  
participants. Most of the partici-  
pants, at this point, were hoping  
to find out what had occurred in  
the By-laws Committee while  
they had been attending work-  
shops all day. (The schedule for  
the weekend had planned Friday  
for workshops and Saturday for  
ratifying FEN by-laws and plan-  
ning future income-generating  
projects within FEN.)  

The differing interests and  
goals of the participants were  
discussed at this plenary  
meeting — the outcome of  
which was that there was no  
consensus as to what a feminist  

Feminist Economic Conference  

economic network should be.  
Most women were open to dis-  
cussion and not aligned to any  
particular position at the begin-  
ning of this meeting. The By-  
Laws Committee (made up of  
women from seven CUs) were  
clear about their differences  
with the Detroit-Oakland FWHC  
group (which now included  
some of the women from the  
Washington Area FFCU), but  
other women still wanted to  
conciliate those differences. The  
plenary meeting ended in a  
walk-out by the Detroit-Oak-  
land FWHC group, together with  
some women from the Washing-  
ton Area FFCU, New Moon Com-  
munications, Diana Press, the  
Detroit branch offices. This is  
the group which later became  
the Feminist Economic Network  

(FEN). The remaining group  
formed its own organization, the  
Feminist Economic Alliance  
(FEA).  
How It Happened  

The following is an edited  
version of that plenary meeting.  
Connie Harper from FFCU of  
Detroit chaired the meeting.  
After various task force reports,  
the By-laws Committee  
reported  
Nancy Craft (California FFCU)  
“As I assume everyone has  
heard, there are now two groups  
— one which includes Detroit  
and Washington, and one which  
includes seven other credit  
unions. I'd like to explain how  
that split came about: First, we  
question the purposes of FEN;  
and second, we question the  
structure of FEN. Our group (the  

seven CUs which support the  
Connecticut by-laws) feels that  
the purpose is to provide a basis  
of growth for the CUs — to learn  
skills and share with the new  
CUs. We understood that that  
was not the other group's  
(Detroit-Oakland FWHC—WAFFCU)  
more diverse goal. However, we  
feel that we don’t have the  
strength, the time, the money, or  
the energy to put that much into  
FEN — to make it a large  
corporate organization. We are  
not saying that we wouldn't be  
willing to make it that in the  
future. However, we need to  
grow first.  

“The difference manifested itself  
on the issue of membership  
and voting rights of feminist  
enterprises other than CUs. We  
want the focus of FEN at this  

Big Mama Rag Vol. 4 No. 1  

time to be on developing CUs.  
We feel we do not have the ex-  
pertise to reach out to other  
groups in such a global manner.  
We need time to stabilize finan-  

cially before including other  
businesses.  
Less Control More  

Representation  

“The other issue was the  
structure of FEN. We believe it  
should be less controlling, less  
hierarchical, that it should be on  
a more representative basis. So  
we could not agree with  
Detroit's by-laws, and are work-  
ing with Connecticut's. We also  
deleted the provision for in-  
vesting in other non-profit and  
profit feminist organizations be-  
cause we don't believe we have  
the resources to do that at this  
time.”  

Connie Harper (FFCU of Detroit)  

“Over the past few months we  
(Detroit-Oakland FWHC) have  
been brainstorming over ideas of  
what an economic network en-  
tails, and decided that a true net-  
work would have to include  
enterprises other than CUs as  
well as CUs. The association of  
these groups would be legally  
structured as a non-profit  
organization, because CUs can  
join only non-profit organiza-  
tions (that is, ones that are not  
based on stock purchases.) The  
association, in turn, would own  
at least two subsidiaries. One  
would be a stock-based, for-  
profit feminist corporation, that  
was wholly owned by the  
association, and that would be  
able to engage in the kinds of  
business transactions that CUs  

are not allowed to engage in be-  
cause of the National Credit  
Union Act. Also, a liquidity fund  
would be established to which  
CUs could go when they need  
money. The benefit of this would  
be both for FEN and for the local  
CUs in terms of income.  
Financial Support to Feminists  

“Another type of enterprise  
which we thought FEN could do  
would be to give financial sup-  
port to feminist businesses. We  
would also give services to other  
CUs by providing materials,  
coordinating, training, and mak-  
ing sure that all CUs were im-  
plementing the feminist goals of  
FEN. FEN money, then, would be  
generated, not from member  
ship dues, but from money  
which FEN earned from in-  
come-generating projects.  

“Why is it important that other  
enterprises be included in FEN  
from the beginning, rather than  
two years later? I would like to  
learn from other enterprises,  
and they can speak to that if they  
like.  

Joanne Parent (FFCU of Detroit):  
“I have never ever in my whole  
life been more disappointed in a  
group of women than the group  
of women that are here today.  
Last May in New Haven, we  
talked about creating all these  
things, and now, how many  
months later, we decide that it’s  
too much — that we can’t do it?  
All we can do is run our CUs a  
little bit better. And maybe two  
years from now we can think  
about building the goddam  
revolution!  

A Sense of Timing  

Susan Osbourne (Conn. FFCU)  
“I think what has been under-  
emphasized in this discussion is  
a sense of timing. Our group  
wants a lapse in time in order to  
get training, and the methods of  
a feminist CU together — stabiliz-  
ed, organizationally and finan-  
cially. There was strong agree-  
ment that other feminist  
enterprises should be included,  
but we want time to get our shit  
together on a grass-roots level,  
and there was absolutely no give  
coming from Detroit.  
Betty Binder (Los Angeles  
FFCU): “I think there are two dif-  
ferent levels of need — one on  
the corporate level and one on  
the level of operation and  
management of CUs. The objec-  
tives are not mutually ex-  
clusive.  

“Speaking from a new CU per-  
spective, I am in favor of a cor-  
porate structure, but our CUs in  
no position to make a contribu-  
tion to this. I know there are  
many other CUs that are just  
organizing and struggling to  
keep alive, a situation which De-  
troit has long since gone past.  
The structure of FEN must  
reflect those different levels of  
need. So the question is: how to  
build both levels at the same  
time without dividing up what  
little power we do have as an  
economic network.”  
Joanne Parent (FFCU-Detroit)  

“Our original conception was to  
have an organization that was  
one organization. But ap-  
parently the people here this  
weekend do not feel that we  
could have one group with the  
ability to carry out both income-  
generating projects as well as  
meet the needs of developing  
CUs.”

A Perspective  

The Detroit Conference:  

Jackie St. Joan  

The story of Detroit is a story of  
the growing pains of the femin-  
ist movement. Feminists are  
moving out of their small groups  
and local projects, and are trying  
to develop national organiza-  
tions and loyalties. It is a process  
which will take years to refine.  
Dealing on a national, and an  
international level, requires the  
development of organizational  
skills that are unfamiliar to many  
women. But our small group ex-  
periences, because they are  
based on limited project-build-  
ing around concepts of per-  
sonality, individual self-develop-  
ment, local needs and loyalties,  
do not necessarily apply to  
building a mass movement. So  
women are having to consider  

ideas that make some of us un-  
comfortable — building large,  
ongoing structures, creating ef-  
fective and fair decision-making  
processes, defining leadership,  
confronting power, projecting  
long-range programs, and  
providing financial stability and  
growth.  

The Detroit story is, in part, the  
story of different women with  
different ideas of how to struc-  
ture a national organization. But  
it is not merely a story of balanc-  
ing those competing needs and  
interests.  

It is a story of money, of being  
organized, and of values.  

Money is Power  

Money represents the ability  

to survive — whether as a  

FEA Statement  

Feminists representing feminist credit unions and enterprises,  
gathered in Detroit over Thanksgiving weekend to discuss issues of  
women and money. As a result of the meeting, the Feminist Economic  
Alliance (FEA), a coast-to-coast organization, was formed to bring inde-  
pendence, power, and self-help to every woman in America and  

beyond.  

The Feminist Economic Alliance is a cooperative association of  
feminist credit unions and enterprises from Massachusetts, Califor-  

nia, Ohio, Connecticut, New York, Minnesota, Colorado, Pennsylvania,  

Florida, Michigan, and Washington, D.C. According to spokeswoman  
Susan Osborne from New Haven and Linda Masianko from New York  
City, the goal of FEA is to “bring economic independence, through self-  
help, to all women, by assisting, encouraging, and promoting develop-  
ment of feminist credit unions and feminist enterprises throughout the  

country.”  

In order to promote communications and cooperation, FEA divided  
itself into eight geographic regions; regional meetings will be held  
quarterly. Organized credit unions will make themselves available to  
newly forming feminist credit unions in their regions.  

“One of the primary concerns of FEA is grass-roots resource-sharing,  
both economic and informational. Delegates at the convention formed a  
central clearinghouse for information needed to organize and operate  

feminist credit unions.  

The formation and structure of FEA reflect its fundamental tenets —  
a recognition of the value of individual and collective growth processes,  
and the importance of local control. A convention was planned for next  

October in Pittsburgh.

feminist group, or as an indivi-  
dual woman. Next to physical  
violence, it is the ultimate in-  
strument of control. It can also  
be a tool for liberation. Having  
money or not having it deter-  
mines what you can do with your  
life, both personally and politi-  
cally. Because it can give you the  
ability to act, it is power. It’s not  
surprising, then, that political  
women, creating an organiza-  
tion that could significantly af-  
fect the survival of many femin-  
ist projects, and the lives of  
individual women, would erupt  
in conflict, get bogged down in  
process, and result in a split  
which left many women with a  
bad taste in their mouths for the  
entire affair.  

Part of this “bad taste in the  
mouth” resulted from the lack of  
recognition of the power issues  
at stake at the Detroit conven-  
tion — of the possibility of con-  
trolling women’s money. The  
very language used at the con-  
vention obscured the money and  
power issues themselves. “In-  
come generating projects” are  
really ways of getting seed  
money for plain old financial in-  
vestments. “Peer pressure,” im-  
plying mere social influence,  
disguises what could amount to  
political and economic control by  
FEN's value auditors. A “self-  
selected” Board of Directors,  
who are the only ones allowed to  
vote in FEN, really amounts to a  
self-perpetuating leadership  
group. And other principles,  
such as the “economic develop-  
ment of women” are so broad as  
to be meaningless.  

But the happenings in Detroit  
were not merely a question of  
money and power either. There  
were also differing qualities of  
organization within the two  
groups, and differing values.  
The “Organizers Were  

ganized  

ad  

The presence of the Oakland  
FWHC representatives was no  
accident. The ties between the  
FWHCs and FFCU of Detroit have  
been developing over time. Last  
summer, the FWHCs sponsored  
a tour of California by the foun-  
ders of FFCU, and the FWHC re-  
presentatives had spent a month  
in Detroit preparing for the con-  
vention. Over a year ago, the  
FWHC presented a paper  
("Where Do We Go From  
Here?") in California, arguing  
that the movement must get  
money in order to get the word  
out to all women. In this paper a  
link was drawn between the  
self-help women’s health move-  
ment, and the self-help  
economic movement of the  
feminist credit unions.  

The FWHC has been a leader  
in urging the movement to  
charge money for its services, to  
develop a program, leadership,  
goals, strategies — to be full-  
time feminists for a full-time  
revolution. Their vision is one of  
winning, and they attract many  
sensible, reality-based, strong  
women to them. Selma Wesley  
from the Missouri FFCU, for in-  
stance, explained her support for  
FEN to me. “I'm tired of wishy-  
washy white women,” she said,  
“These women (FEN) are going  
someplace. The others will come  
along. Sometimes you gotta do  
that sort of thing to get the job  
done.”  

The FWHC has also been the  
subject of criticism, although  
they discount that criticism as  
“trashing.” Their bull-dozer  
tactics, their controlling of group  
dynamics, their lack of ap-  
preciation of the differences  
among women, and their blind  
zeal have made them unsuc-  
cessful in appealing to many  
feminists. For example, many  
women resigned from the  
FWHCs in 1973 and wrote cri-  
tiques of FWHC politics: the  
Iowa City Women’s Health Con-  
ference several years ago failed  
to unify the entire women’s  
health movement; and at the  
Detroit convention, less than one-  
third of the participants aligned  
with FEN. As Maria Bithorn of  
the Connecticut FFCU told me,  
“I'm a 56-year-old Puerto Rican  
social worker, and I'm interested  
in the material benefits which  
money can bring to women.  
Feminists should be working for  
all women’s welfare. It’s good to  
think about economic develop-  
ment, but the benefits of it  
should not be just for a few.  
The point is, however, that the  
Oakland FWHC women, and  
their allies in the FFCU of  
Detroit, New Moon Com-  
munications (which publishes  
The Monthly Extract, the com-  
munications network for self-  
help clinics), and in some of the  
branch offices of FFCU, were  
organized. They had a program  
to offer, a united leadership, a  
common set of values to  
promote, and goals and  
strategies for the convention  
planned well in advance of  
Thursday night. What had ap-  
peared to be a spontaneous  
walk-out of this group from the  
main body was, in fact, a strategy  
which had been planned weeks  
in advance. The theory work-  
shops were designed to pro-  
mote the values of the FWHC  
among conference participants,  
by positing it as a model for suc-  
cessful feminist organizations.  
The group seldom showed any  
disunity among themselves — and  
once a position or decision was  
made by one of them, the others  
supported that position in words  
or in action. The very fact that  
they were organized allowed  
them, come hell or high water, to  
accomplish the task they had set  
for themselves — to set up the  

Feminist Economic Network.  
Take It or Leave It  

The other group, comprising  
two-thirds of the participants,  
which did not align itself with  
FEN, fought valiantly against  
feeling like losers. But they  
clearly felt acted
