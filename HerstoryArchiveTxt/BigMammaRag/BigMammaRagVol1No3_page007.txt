SISTER

Polly Pavek

Two months ago I discovered  
that I love to sing. I have  
been singing for many years;  
when I'm alone, in the bath-  
tub, washing dishes, riding  
in the car, and sometimes I  
sing with friends. I used to  
sing only folk songs, but in  
my recent discovery I  
started to explore rock 'n  
roll, and I try to sing along with  
Aretha, or Bonnie Bramlett,  
Laura Nyro, Carole King,  
Bonnie Raitt, Merry Clayton,  
or Rita Coolidge. These  
women sing about themselves  
(ourselves) with such energy  
in their voices, and strength  
in their souls that they  
have fully converted me to  
singing my own soul. I have  
expanded my singing territory  
from the bathtub, kitchen  
sink, and moving car to the  
sidewalks, the city park, my  
job, and as far as an actual  
live microphone. The less shy  
and fearful I am of public  
places hearing my voice, the  
less fearful I am of myself,  
and I feel like I'm breaking a  
link of the patriarchal chain  
that keeps me from my own free-  
dom.

Now that I enjoy singing so  
much, I want to do something  
with it. I have gone to many  
auditions and met quite a few  
people. Every group I've  
visited has been dominated by  
men, whether they sing folk or  
cock rock. I've met three  
women and about fifteen men at  
various auditions. I also  
discovered that the majority  
of vocal try-outs for rock 'n  
roll bands have been men.

I've wondered about the minor-  
ity of women dealing with  
popular music: is it because  
women hate cock rock, or  
that we can't sing, or that  
we can sing but are too shy in  
the mask of Eve to assert  
ourselves? Personally, I  
despise cock rock and refuse  
to sing or listen to it (which  
presents many problems).  
Luckily I can sing, and I am  
bored hiding out in the bath-  
tub.

One of the three women I  
met was fired from the group  
she had been with because  
she wouldn't cut her hair in  
a shag style, nor wear tinted  
glasses and batty eyelashes.  
The second woman looked like  
Janis Joplin and sang a lot  
of cock 'n roll which pleased  
all the men in the band. The  
third woman is a very versatile  
musician who left a group  
after a month of their pelvic  
ego trips. God's death:  
Why do we have to be subjugated  
by electric penises that glory  
in the enslavement of women?

I want to sing with good,  
rhythmic music that comes  
from my womanly soul, I am  
trying to move forward as a  
singer and as a woman; I'm  
practicing and strengthening  
my voice, and just about  
praying that I'll find some  
musicians who won't oppress  
me.

The only people I know  
who don't oppress me are my  
sisters. Yes, I want to sing  
with my sisters. I just drool  
at the image of being on  
stage with women, good music,  
and a happy audience before  
us. I smile with deep pleasure  
as my fantasy grows and there  
are only women on stage at  
Mr. Lucky's and all the women  
working there, who are  
pushed into hot pants by the  
management and eagle-eyed by  
the many heavy-set, American  
flagged bouncers, join them  
and are freed from the ass-  
pinching customers, and then:  
all those women go over to  
the Warehouse and tear down  
all those pictures on the walls,  
because every one of those  
drawings or paintings are of  
nude women. And who knows,  
Tricky Dicky's might even be  
invaded!

Oh, I'm tired of the bathtub,  
it depresses me. I'm sick of  
loud cock rock, it's trying to  
kill me. I want to sing and  
be heard. I know that there  
are many women in Denver who  
can sing, and many women who  
are good musicians. The  
men dominating the music  
world will only allow our songs  
and creativity to develop to  
a limited point where we  
threaten them with real and  
better music, and they will try  
to stop us. Boycott them!

And let's get ourselves together.
