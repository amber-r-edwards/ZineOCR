Women Unite

Utilizing brutal force  
the police of Chile broke  
up a demonstration on Dec.  
29 by 10,000 women demand-  
ing an end to the dictator-  
ship of Gen. Augusto Pino-  
chet. The women, who rep-  
resented every left and center  
political organization in  
the country, were attacked  
by club-wielding police,  
and finally dispersed with  
water cannons.

Stop Apartheid

A European campaign against  
oil trade with the apartheid  
regime in South Africa is  
being organized by dockers  
and seafarers' unions. The  
strategy is to obtain infor-  
mation on oil tankers stop-  
ping in South African ports  
and then lobbying the com-  
panies which break the UN  
endorsed oil embargo against  
the racist government. South  
Africa has banned information  
about oil shipments into the  
country, which has no domes-  
tic oil deposits. The anti-  
apartheid group will also  
publish a list of off-  
enders and may use strikes  
to support the ban.

Activist Sentenced

A Turkish military tribu-  
nal has sentenced Reha Cum-  
huriyet Isvan to eight years  
hard labor and 32 months of  
internal exile for being a  
founding member of the Turk-  
ish Peace Association, now  
illegal under Turkish law.  
The sentences were passed  
days after the November elec-  
tions which were claimed to  
have restored Turkey to a  
'democracy.' Reha Isvan now  
faces the possibility of a  
second trial - for being a  
founding member of the Pro-  
gressive Women's Organiza-  
tion (IKD). The state pro-  
secutor is asking for sen-  
tences of 15-30 years for  
the women involved.

Taking Action

To protest the imminent  
threat of nuclear annihila-  
tion, a group of women locked  
shut the doors of the  
British Consulate in San  
Francisco, posted a state-  
ment, threw paint over the  
doors, and left. They chose  
the British Consulate to  
highlight the British gov-  
ernment's complicity in the  
proliferation of war and to  
show support for the women  
occupying the U.S. missile  
base at Greenham Common in  
England.

Pine Gap Protest

On November 11, women from  
all over Australia set out  
from Alice Springs for the  
Pine Gap US CIA Base. The  
women, including Aborigines,  
are demanding the elimination  
of US bases in Australia  
(which are principally elec-  
tronic surveillance and con-  
trol facilities for satel-  
lites and missiles) and the  
restoration of land rights  
and the right to self deter-  
mination for the Aboriginal  
peoples.

The Women For Survival  
Camp organizers chose Pine  
Gap because of its importance  
to the US global nuclear war-  
fare system, which also makes  
it a potential nuclear tar-  
get. Women For Survival see  
the base as representing the  
Australian contribution to  
the growing likelihood of  
nuclear conflict. The camp  
reportedly lasted for two  
weeks, and there are plans  
to repeat the demonstration  
at Pine Gap or elsewhere.

No More Kids

A Florida woman forbidden  
to bear children for 15  
years as a condition of  
parole after her son died  
of malnutrition has been  
sent back to prison for  
giving birth.

In March 1982, Pasco Cir-  
cuit Judge Wayne L. Cobb  
ordered Jackie Fourthman,  
then 20, to serve nine  
months in jail and not to  
have children for 15 years.  
After she served her time,  
she was permitted to leave  
Florida for Indiana. Proba-  
tion officers allege that  
she left Indiana without  
permission and went to  
Phoenix to give birth to a  
son. They contend there  
were two violations: leaving  
the state without permission  
and giving birth.

Embargo Violations

A report prepared by the  
American Friends Service  
Committee and the Washington  
Office on Africa charges  
that the U.S. has systema-  
tically violated the manda-  
tory U.N. embargo on the  
sale of military equipment  
to South Africa. The report  
said the U.S. "is sabotaging  
the international arms em-  
bargo by winking at U.S.  
companies' exports to Africa.  
The volume of this trade is  
much greater than has been  
reported." "By loosening  
controls on exports to South  
Africa, the Reagan adminis-  
tration is cozying up to the  
white-minority government  
in Pretoria."

Pill Danger

Women using the contracep-  
tive pill for more than four  
years before the birth of  
their first child run three  
times more risk of breast  
cancer than non-users, ac-  
cording to a report in the  
British medical journal The  
Lancet. This study found no  
evidence to confirm earlier  
allegations that particular  
brands of the pill, those  
with high levels of proges-  
trin, were to blame.

NRC To ANS

Former Nuclear Regulatory  
Commission chairman, Joseph  
M. Hendrie, has been elected  
vice president of the Ameri-  
can Nuclear Society, the  
major nuclear industry trade  
association. He will automa-  
tically become president of  
the organization in June.

The new position will al-  
low Hendrie to do openly and  
legally what the "regulatory  
agency has been doing for  
years: to work with utili-  
ties and nuclear industry  
suppliers for public support  
and increased government  
bailouts of an industry that  
has proven itself an econo-  
mic and environmental dis-  
aster.

Shelters Needed

An official of the Denver  
Dept. of Social Services has  
estimated there are 4-5,000  
people in need of shelters  
in the city. Dale Bell  
blamed the General Services  
Administration for refusing  
to declare as excess two ad-  
jacent federal buildings  
that were to be converted  
into shelters for the needy.  
The two buildings could pro-  
vide shelter to about 1,000  
people. One of the buildings  
has been vacant for at least  
a year. Bell blamed govern-  
ment red tape for preventing  
the federal buildings from  
being used for the homeless.

Pentagon Porn

A Pentagon study of long  
distance calls by the De-  
fense Intelligence Agency  
shows the military's spies  
spent about $25,000 a month  
in calls to a NYC "Dial-a-  
Porn" number. The fun's over  
though, because the Penta-  
gon's inspector general  
recommended that an elec-  
tronic block be placed  
against the New York number.  
But, to keep the spy boys  
from getting off on our  
money costs more of our  
money: a $150 installation  
fee plus a $15 monthly fee.

Suit Filed

The New York Legal Aid  
Society has filed a class-  
action suit on behalf of  
women prisoners at Rikers  
Island who are mothers. The  
suit contends the Dept. of  
Corrections policy of separ-  
ating mothers from their  
children violates the Con-  
stitution's guarantee against  
cruel and unusual punishment,  
and a NY State law which  
permits women to keep their  
infants with them in jail  
until one year if they are  
nursing them. There are no  
facilities for infants to  
stay with their mothers at  
Rikers Island.

Also, under state law, if  
a parent is sentenced to  
prison for more than a year,  
her consent is not required  
for an adoption of her  
child(ren).

Chinese Nukes

If America's nuclear pro-  
fiteers have their way, the  
next generation of Chinese  
nukes will bear names like  
General Electric and West-  
inghouse. With the domestic  
nuclear industry at a vir-  
tual standstill, American  
nuclear suppliers are gear-  
ing up to sell reactor hard-  
ware and other equipment to  
the People's Republic of  
China. The nuke merchants  
will be aided by a Chinese  
government which, over the  
last few years, appears to  
be shifting ever more quickly  
to the right. The American  
Nuclear Society (ANS), an  
industry booster group, is  
sponsoring the second Nuclear  
Technology Exhibit in Bei-  
jing next May. The ANS says  
China is "a very important  
market indeed when one con-  
siders how other areas of  
overseas business are start-  
ing to dry up." "The research  
and university market, backed  
by grants from the Interna-  
tional Monetary Fund, can be  
very profitable," ANS notes.
