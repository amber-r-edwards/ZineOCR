Lesbian Lifestyles

Dear friends of BMR:
If you are a lesbian, living in
Colorado, I really need your help

with the
graduate
ology in
master's
Specific
jence: certain general attitudes and
behaviors and sexuality. The re-
search intended to compare
lesbian and heterosexual women; in-
stead, the focus will be on similar-
ities and differences among lesbians.
Participation in the study involves
anonymously completing 4 brief ques-
tionnaires and returning them to me

by mail (return postage included).
The average amount of time it takes
to finish all the questionnaires is
1/2 hour.

Why invest the time and energy
needed to fill out the questionnaires
and return them? As you may be aware
high quality, objective studies in-
volving large numbers of lesbians are
disappointingly rare. More objective
information is needed and can only
benefit lesbians as a group. In ad-
dition, you may gain greater aware-
ness of your own attitudes and behav-
iors, particularly your sexual atti-
tudes and behaviors, as a result of
your involvement in this study.

If you are interested in helping
out, please write to me in care of
the address listed below. I will send
the questionnaires to you at a home

study I am doing. I am a
student in counseling psych-
the process of writing a
thesis. My interest is in

address, a post office box, a women's
place, or wherever you wish. They
will be unmarked, so that when you
return your questionnaires I will be
unable to identify their source.

When the results are obtained, I will
be unable to identify their source.
When the results are obtained, I will
be willing to share them with you.

I plan to write an article for BMF
about the study when it is finished
(hopefully by mid-summer).

Please pass this message along;
write back soon and let me know if
you will help out. And thank you. It
is my hope that this work, with your
help, will contribute to clarifying
the image of lesbians and all women.
