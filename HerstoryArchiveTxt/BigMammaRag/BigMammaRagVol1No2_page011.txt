Most books written for chil-
dren are insidious perpetuators
of a crippling status quo.
Looking back over our own
childhood favorites, we were
disconcerted to find that we
were exposed to a rather narrow
range of life experiences and
roles in literature. Remember
Nancy (WASP) Drew, whose blond
hair flew in the wind as she
rushed from mystery to mystery
in her brand new sports coupe?
And Peter Pan, surrounded by
sexy little Tinkerbell and the
capable Wendy, and who never
has to grow up and deal with
growing relationships with real
and mature people?

We want children to have a
broader range of reading avail-
able to them - books that offer
alternative values and models
for new ways of functioning.

We must encourage our children
to develop thoughtful analyses
of the printed word from a
very early age, in order that
they may emerge stronger and
more perceptive from exposure
to the abundance of bad books
designed for them.

CENSORSHIP

Censorship robs a child of
a variety of reading experiences,
both good and bad, and denies
the child a chance to develop
his/her discriminatory powers.
However, unless he/she is exposed
to alternatives to prevailing
limits of sex-class-race-age
stereotyping, it will be hard
for any child to see a way out
of the confinement of life
situations presented in tradi-
tional childhood reading
material.

CRITERIA

We set out to explore the
available market in children's
literature. Very few books,
we found, could satisfy our
criteria - that they be non-sex-
ist, non-racist, and non-condes-
cending to young readers - in
other words, that they be
non-chauvinistic in every sense.
Even fewer were interesting,
well-written, or reasonably
priced.

LITTLE MISS MUFFET FIGHTS BACK

The trend in books for little
children is to present very
beautiful, adult-aimed illustra-
tions, accompanied by inane text,
or sugar-coated, but hardly
disguised didacticism. Grownups
are always right in the end;
(white, men) doctors and (white,
motherly) teachers and nurses
and (strong, white, manly)
policemen are not to be disputed.
They will unfailingly lead a
child from pain and error into
the right.

We read a large portion of
the books suggested in a list
called “Little Miss Muffet
Fights Back," printed by Femi-
nists on Children's Media.

These books are principally for
older boys and girls. Most of
the stories are thoroughly laced with
stereotypical behavior and the
anti-Communism, ladylike demea-
nor and strong, silent male
authorities to whom, in the end,
the girls turn for help and
approval. The typical heroine
is either a fairy princess or
the cook-and-mother-figure in
youthful adventures; and the
"different" girl, who has no
interest in boys, but wants to
pursue her own interests or
develop her own skills eventually
finds real happiness in the
form of a boyfriend. As
consolation for having to stay
home when her boyfriend goes
to sea, or for having to mind
the hearth while he goes out into
the world to seek adventure, she
gets to keep his pet rabbit for
him, or take care of his dog.

It is made clear that true love
is the only happiness for a girl,
that happiness is the only goal
in life, and that this love-
leading-to-happiness consists
of women's silent sacrifice.

FOR LITTLE BOYS

The role models presented
to little boys, although
generally allowing for greater
assertiveness and self-expression
are also limiting, in that they
communicate repeatedly the
importance of competition,
strength, daring, and masterful-
ness, and deny the importance
of softness, sharing, feeling
and reciprocal relationships
with strong, daring, and master-
ful little girls.

We did find several excel-
lent bibliographies of Feminist
literature, which contain
suggestions also for children's
reading. The Feminist Press
at State University of New York,
College at Old Westbury, Box
334, Old Westbury, New York 11568,
lists many sources; KNOW Press,
P.O. Box 86031, Pittsburgh, PA,
15221, publishes a very
comprehensive bibliography of
Women's Literature; the Denver
Public Library, while limited
in Feminist Children's Literature,
has several useful pamphlets in
its "Heritage" series.

From our own explorations
we offer the following (by no
means complete) list of books
we liked, remembering that the
influence of children's books
lies less in the ideology
presented, but finally in the
ability of a child to analyze
what he/she reads, to consider
the printed word from the
perspective of a person who
knows him/herself as a whole
and valuable individual whose
ideas and feelings are valid
and important. We list the
following books as an alterna-
tive presentation to the tradi-
tional portrayal of chauvinism
in our culture's sex roles,
race roles, age roles, and to
economic exploitation
in the name of and over the
bodies and psyches of persons
coerced into those roles.

Both the RIP Bookstore,
at 737 E. 17th Avenue, and
the Woman's Voice Bookstore,
673 South Pearl, are attempting
to stock the above books on
their shelves. The books
should be available soon.

In future issues of Big
Mama Rag, we plan to review
children's books regularly,
and we welcome suggestions and
additions to our list.
