Jerry And Phyllis-Such A “Lovely”

Bobbe Ross

April 20-Colorado Capitol
Building, Denver. Jerry Fal-
well arrived with his
dressing women (red dresses) and
men (white suits) and enough
flags to start a cemetery and
a sound system that any punk
band would have loved to use.
Falwell, president of the
Moral Majority urged every-
one to support the Human Life
Amendment. The Moral Majority
advocates pro-nuclear family,
pro-life, pro-morality, pro-
American patriotism.

The Denver Post and the
Rocky Mountain News disagreed
on the numbers of Falwell's
followers and how many of us
were there protesting.

While Falwell showed pat-
riarchal concern for all gays
and lesbians, Hate the sin,
not the sinner, and preached
Christian love, two women had
signs ripped from them and
another, blowing a whistle, re-
ceived threats if she contin-

ued to blow it. Three women
had gotten up to the front of
Falwell's followers and were
being noisy and they received
threats and pushing around by
the faithful.

The protesters were many
with signs that proclaimed
anarchy, gay Christians, les-
bians, pro-abortion feminists
and ERA supporters. There
were also "peace keepers."

April 25-Thomas Jefferson
High School, Denver. The Mor-
mon church was today a co-
sponsor of The Pro-Family Con-
ference. Phyllis Schlafly and
Bill Murray were speakers but
groups also speaking were
The Colorado Alliance For a
Sound Economy, Denver Area
Youth for Christ and various
ministers. There was a big
bowl of fortune cookies among
all the literature outside the
auditorium and one of the co-
okies read Let's all win! Vote

A suburban auditorium filled
with women in traditional
dressy clothes and men in
suits listened to speakers
preaching the gospel of anti-
abortion, anti-ERA and popu-
lation control.

The NOW Chapter-Arapahoe and
Denver branch organized about
60 women and were standing out-
side the high school with

signs that read: ERA IS GOOD
FOR US, KEEP ABORTION LEGAL
AND SAFE, ERA IS GOOD FOR THE
FAMILY, KEEP YOUR LAWS OFF OUR
BODIES, ERA YES, STOP HLA,
ERA-YES HLA-NO, ERA AND FERT-
ILITY CONTROL MAKE HAPPIER
AMERICAN FAMILIES.

The Chapter told the media
that they give Schlafly the Eva
Braun Award, that she is to
women what Hitler was to the
Jews. Tracy Schiabne, from KOA
NBC's Channel 4, wasn't allowed
in because she didn't have the
correct pass, her male partner
did, so he got in.

Along with the NOW demonstr-
ators were women from other
groups and though they were
much smaller in number they
tried to get the NOW women to
join them in doing more than
standing around holding signs.
A speak-out was mentioned,
crashing the main door was
suggested and finally, once a
way in was found, suggesting
that women with signs go onto
the auditorium stage and march
through with signs. The host-
ility from many of the NOW
members was very apparent.
They wouldn't allow their
signs to be used. Nine women,
with one sign, ERA-YES, HLA-
NO, went into the back entrance
of the auditorium, marched
on stage, directly in back of
Schlafly as she talked, spitting
distance so to speak,
paused and marched off. The
minute the women appeared, men
from the audience rose up but
the women were off the stage
before the men could reach
them.

Later, one of the nine wom-
en tried to talk to one very
hostile NOW member but it didn't
get very far.

Analysis

Early in my political beg-
innings I tried the nice ap-
proach, talking to those we
were demonstrating against,
being patient (and very un-
aware of many political points)
with insults and urging non-
violence. I have since relear-
ned a lot of my basic smarts
gotten from the streets.

I don't know who asked peo-
ple to go around with armbands
marked peace keeper, I don't
know who asked them to keep
the peace. I know that basic-
ally they are one of us, but
really, peace, whose peace-at
what price? I am not advocat-

ing mass riot but I think it
is about time we started to
discuss peace, non-violence,
lady-like behavior, being
nice.

Non-violence, talking of
peace means we place ourselves
into that old passive role
that society thinks is proper
for us. When we recognize that
fighting with words can lead
to fighting with our bodies
we have to throw aside the
liberal (safe) attitudes that
the civil rights and anti-war
movements shoved down our
throats.

I want to see a strong
movement. The strongest
strategies must be worked out
and fears talked out. Individual
action is futile,
often unnoticed and many times
dangerous. Actions done well
by a group can be effective,
it's always strengthening.
Actions don't have to be il-
legal, they can be anything-
from street theatre to cutting
sound system wires (pull the
plug first), to making noise
with whistles and chants to
breaking into their speakers,
the list is endless.

I feel so foolish, standing
with a sign or mutely picket-
ing. That just isn't good en-
ough. We are being controlled.
We must make the action and
the action must be good.

The new product is a round,
pliant, spermicide-soaked
sponge two inches by one-half
inch thick which is inserted
like a diaphragm. Unlike the
diaphragm, it does not need
to be specially fitted for
each user. One size fits all.
Once inserted it can be left
in for 48 hours. The sponge
is dampened before insertion.

The news of the new product
has been overwhelming. The
phones have been ringing con-
stantly since the clinic
published the news of the
newspapers.

Nurses Win

Rocky Mountain Hospital has
entered into an Unfair Labor
Practice Settlement Agreement
with the National Labor Rela-
tions Board (NLRB). The
agreement represents the set-
tlement of several unfair la-
bor charges filed against the
hospital by the Rocky Moun-
tain Federation of Nurses
and Health Professionals, AFT
AFL-CIO. Nurses, LPNs and techni-
cians at Rocky Mountain Hos-
pital have won this agreement
after a half months of
initial organizing drive as
well as those activities
which caused the strike at
Rocky Mountain Hospital.
These activities included
harassment of employees who
were involved with the union
organizing process and attem-
pts, through wage bargaining
with individuals, to under-
mine the power of the union.
As part of the settlement,
the hospital is required to
post an official NLRB notice
to employees that it will
not engage in unlawful con-
duct and will affirm its
commitment to the rights of
employees.

The spermicide contained in the sponge
is known to kill bacteria, Dr.
Illige is hopeful there will
be no harmful side effects.

Participants in the study
are given free contraceptives.
The medical care required by
the study is also free. However, the volunteer must take
full responsibility for any
pregnancies that occur if eith-
er device fails. Even that
possibility has not stopped
the many volunteers. This again
underlines the real need
to develop safer and more sat-
isfactory birth control meth-
ods.

As you may have noticed on the cover, we have decided to
cover health in two issues. So if you're still motivated to
write an article on health or the health care delivery sys-
tem you still have time. The deadline for next month is
May 15th. We're also interested in any graphics or photos
that may be appropriate.

You all will probably be as happy as we are about the
good news we received this month. The future of BMR is
looking up. Vicki Piotter and Constance Perenyi have de-
cided to stay in Denver and continue working on the paper.
They will be joining the collective again in August and
June respectively. Among the reasons was that they felt
that BMR is one of the best ways to grow politically, even
after three years on the collective, and we agree. By the
way, the collective is still open to new members, think a-

bout it.

April 4th, at our community meeting, several new women
came and offered to help the paper out. We look forward to
their input. We'll be at the People's Fair for anyone else
who is interested in talking with us.

Future themes are "Women and the Church" and "The State
of the Women's Movement." Articles and graphics are welcome.
Why is it that everything breaks when you need it most?

Again, one typewriter and the strip printer broke after
the repair places had closed on Friday night. We use them
all month long. Special thanks to Paula for finding us a
typewriter we could use for the weekend, and to Judy for
jerry-rigging the strip printer to a tape recorder to work
the light switch. We don't know how she did it either.
Keep those cards and letters coming, till next month, bye
