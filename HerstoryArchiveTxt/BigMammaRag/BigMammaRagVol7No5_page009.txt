Crunch Nestle QUIKly

A delegation of Coloradans visited  
the Nestle Company in Lakewood last  
month urging them to stop all promo-  
tion of infant formula in Third World  
countries and presenting them with  
two giant postcards. Each postcard  
was plastered with unused Nestle pro-  
duct coupons and listed many Colorado  
organizations and hundreds of individ-  
uals who have endorsed the Nestle  
Boycott.

"The national 'Clip Nestle Quik'  
campaign was launched because Nestle  
had stepped up its advertising and  
promotional coupon distribution in  
the United States in an unsuccessful  
effort to undercut the growing inter-  
national boycott of all Nestle pro-  
ducts," stated Rev. Jean Marsh of  
Colorado Springs. "By returning thou-  
sands of unused coupons to Nestle,  
Americans are showing Nestle that  
their sales are going to drop until  
they stop all promotion of infant  
formula in Third World countries,"  
she added.

Despite an estimated 10 million  
babies becoming sick from bottle-  
feeding in Third World countries each  
year, Nestle, the world's largest pro-  
ducer of infant formula, refuses to  
stop its infant formula promotion  
in these countries. (In fact, Nestle  
has devised another product to foist  
on the Third World. Nestoban, which  
sells for $2.20 a can, lasting an  
infant for eight days, allegedly pre-  
vents the very diarrhea its infant  
formula causes.)

"Many bottle-fed babies suffer mal-  
nutrition and even death in Third  
World countries, as well as retarda-  
tion," stated Rev. Marsh. "Unclean  
water and poverty make the safe prep-  

eration of expensive infant formula  
virtually impossible," she explained.  
"We are asking Nestle, the Swiss-  

based food giant, to immediately stop  

all promotion of infant formulas in  

developing countries, including:  

- an end to direct advertising of form-  
ula to consumers  

- an end to distribution of free sup-  
plies to hospitals, clinics and homes  
of newborns  

- an end to the use of company 'milk  
nurses'  

- an end to promotion to the health  
professions and through health care  
institutions."

That demonstration  

went well but all  
of its ID  

Many Colorado organizations have  
formally endorsed the Nestle boycott.  
These organizations are refusing to  
buy any Nestle products including  
Nescafe, the world's largest selling  
brand of instant coffee, Taster's  
Choice, Nestea, QUIK, CRUNCH, plus  
all foods marketed by Nestle's wholly-  
owned subsidiaries, Stouffer and  
Libby.

Abortion Attack

Big Mama Rag Vol. 7 No. 5

Health Clinic Exposes Agent

by the FWHC

Sending an undercover agent into a  
clinic, pretending to be pregnant,  
trying to trick (unsuccessfully) the  
health workers into encouraging the  
agent to have an abortion she does  
not need. Filming the comings and go-  
ings of women seeking abortion care,  
while conducting an inquisition. A  
Police investigation? An anti-abortion  
attack? No. This is "news reporting"  
of KNXT-TV news team in Los Angeles.

The Feminist Women's Health Center,  
a woman-controlled clinic in Los  
Angeles which has been a model for  
good abortion care, was visited by  
the KNXT-TV news team April 25th as  
a part of a city-wide attack on abor-  
tion providers to be broadcast in  
May. The news team sent an undercover  
reporter to the FWHC to see if the  
Women's Choice Clinic performed abor-  
tions on women who are not pregnant.

The agent's urine pregnancy test  
and medical exam indicated that she  
probably was not pregnant. Despite  
her repeated demands to have an abor-  
tion, she was counseled to come back  
in a week for further tests if she  
was still concerned.

The FWHC held a news conference to  
discuss the "visit" by KNXT-TV. With  
the media present, the FWHC also dem-  
onstrated urine pregnancy tests and  
had information available on abortion  
care.

“The filming of women going in and  
out of the clinic is an outrageous  
invasion of women's privacy. By cre-  
ating a sensationalistic atmosphere,  
KNXT-TV can only hope to frighten  
women and discourage them from exer-  
cising their rights to abortion," said  
Shelly Farber of the Feminist Women's  
Health Center.

The FWHC believes that KNXT-TV is  
only trying to bolster their falter-  
ing ratings by producing the most  
controversial report on abortion, not  
the most informational.

"Why is KNXT-TV not studying the  
overwhelming statistics that show  
abortion to be safe for women?" asked  
Teri Albright of the FWHC. "Why don't  
they expose the hospitals that refuse  
to give abortions to women? Why don't  
they tell women that abortions are  
safe, legal and available to the 24th  
week of pregnancy, and that in Calif-  
ornia the Medi-Cal program pays for  
poor women to have abortions."

Sears Loses Dangerous Suit

One of the mounting threats against  
affirmative action for women and min-  
orities was averted in mid-May when a  
federal judge dismissed a suit initi-  
ated by Sears, Roebuck and Company.

Sears, which has faced over 1,500  
discrimination complaints and suits  
since 1965, was seeking to halt the  
enforcement of anti-discrimination  
measures against itself and all gener-  
al merchandise retailers employing  
15 or more workers.

In responding to Sears' claim of  
confusion by government affirmative  
action guidelines, Judge June Green  
said, "Sears has failed to present a  
justifiable case or controversy...This  
case must be dismissed."

Sears, in filing suit against 10  
federal agencies, charged that govern-  
ment actions and inactions have cre-  
ated a predominately white male work-  

force, thereby denying private employ-  
ers the "right to comply" with federal  
provisions barring discrimination in  
employment.

However, while asserting in their  
suit that the government should be  
required to do more, Sears deviously  
argued that it and other private em-  
ployers should be required to do less.

Despite Sears’ "confusion" about  
what is discrimination, the company  
claims they have made substantial  
progress in pursuing equal employment  
opportunity goals. This claim is hard  
to reconcile with the EEOC, which cur-  
rently has a major suit against Sears  
for numerous violations of Title VII  
by discriminating against women,  
blacks, and Spanish-surnamed Americans  
in recruitment, hiring, job assignment,  
training, compensation, promotion and  
a wide range of terms and conditions  
of employment.

Thumbed Out

In West Germany, Dr. Karl Juritza  
has discovered that women have shorter  
thumbs than men, a defect which, he  
thinks, makes women poorly suited to  
do technical work. On the basis of  
that evidence, Munich's Christian  
Social Union government has decided  
to cancel 30 apprenticeships for women  
fitters, mechanics and electricians.

Cover-up

26 waitresses at Detroit's Metro Air-  
port filed suit last year against their  
employer, the Michigan Host Company,  
charging the skimpy uniforms they had to  
wear made them the victims of sex dis-  
crimination. Before this suit came to  
court, however, the Restaurant Workers  
Union and the Host Company reached an  
agreement about new costumes. Airport  
waitresses now wear long skirts and long  
sleeved blouses with collars that button  
at the neck.

A lawyer for the Host Company says  
that the new costumes are not in re-  
sponse to the suit, but are part of a  
long planned company policy to set "an  
1880 saloon scene" in company restau-  
rants. Employees in other cities, however, are  
still required to work in ruffled panties  
and thigh-high skirts.
