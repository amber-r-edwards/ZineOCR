Feminine Principle  
continued from page 13  

down from above. We must  
fight our own battles without  

paternalistic assistance. We  

must fight our own oppres-  
sion with our own force. This  
requires a sense of our own  
identity. Because we have  
traditionally been identified  
through men and families  
rather than through ourselves,  
we now need a certain degree  
of withdrawal into ourselves in  
order to realize a deeply  
personal identity. This means  
women functioning together  
with women in order to know  
the essence of Woman. Only  
as women come to know  
themselves will they be able  
to function successfully in  
coalition with men. “Once  
women have shared the  
process of self-discovery and  
the experience of independent  
decision-making, they are  
ready for the great struggle...  
This is not a struggle against  
men... Women cannot be  
free until men are free... The  
solutions for women lie in  
solving far-ranging social  
problems. But this involves  
nothing short of revolutionary  
restructuring of the most  
basic institutions in society.”  

RADICAL FEMINISM  

As the radical Feminist  
sees it... “The Feminist  
movement generally is still  
basically a ‘reform’ movement  
directed toward bigger and  
better participation in the  
male privilege through equali-  
ty in his system and thus a  
further denial of her own  
identity in the wages of power  
in the same sexual caste  
system which she claims to  
be the source of her depriva-  
tion.” Until sexual oppres-  
sion is eliminated, oppression  
itself will continue regardless  
of any social, political, or  
economic adjustments. Radi-  
cal Feminists do not want  
equal privileges in the existing  
society, do not want equality  
with what maleness is -- with  
aggression, destruction, and  
death. We want to restructure  
society, changing its existing  
definitions of masculine and  
feminine. We see that we  
must begin creating the new  
person within ourselves. We  
want men and women to reject  
their programmed roles and  
question every single aspect  
of this society, their role in it  
and their behavior.  

Male supremacy is not a  
personal problem, but a  
pervasive social force. We will  
begin to solve the problem  
when women organize and  
back each other up. That is  
the immediate goal of Femin-  
ism -- to get women together,  
to make them see each other  
as sisters and allies instead of  
competitors for male favors.  
As yet we have no clear vision  
of the new society. That will  
develop with time. But we do  
know that sexism, like racism,  
is incompatible with human  
dignity.

The Woman’s Voice Book-  
store is for sale. The present  
owner plans to close the  
bookstore August 1, and  
Denver women may lose the  
only Feminist bookstore in  
town. Faced with this des-  
pairing possibility, Big Mama  
Rag has submitted a proposal  
to the Denver Sustaining  
Fund, which would allow us  
to purchase the bookstore,  
move our office to that  
location, and operate a  
woman’s clearinghouse for  
information and services all  
from the same (new) location.  
Any profits from the book-  
store would be recycled back  
into the Woman’s Voice itself,  
the operation of Big Mama  
Rag, and, hopefully into a  
future Denver Women’s Cen-  
ter. We suggest you call the  
DSF to voice your support for  
this proposal (455-4502). Any  
women interested in working  
with The Woman's Voice when  
and if we are funded, please  
call our office (322-2010) and  
let us know. We need all the  
help we can get!
