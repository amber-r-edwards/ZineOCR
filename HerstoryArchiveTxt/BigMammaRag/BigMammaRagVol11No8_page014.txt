Grand JUFY from page 11

SG: The whole philosophy be-
hind the RICO jury is that
very thing - guilt by associ-
ation - if you know somebody
who knows somebody who did
something, you're guilty,
you're the same as.

SM: One of the times Sylvia
and I were in court, the judge
said basically, that we must
have been influenced by other
people, and they wanted to
give us time to go home, go
back to jail, and think about
it, because the decision we
were making about non-collab-
oration, couldn't really be
our own decision. Both Sylvia
and I said, we made a state-
ment in court that day, that
you clearly don't understand
anything about humanity, or a-
bout us, because what we're
doing is what we see as needed
to change the world and what
we take on. We aren't being
influenced by anyone. We res-
pect liberation struggles, we
learn from revolutionaries.
But we do what we do because
we are whole thinking human
beings and you clearly can't
see that. You can't conceive,
and this is particularly to
white women - they couldn't
conceive of what these nice
white girls could possibly be
thinking. It was beyond their
comprehension. We should un-
derstand that - they do think
that. Even though they also
think we're dangerous. They

Big Mama Rag, August/September, 1983 - Page 17

also think it's beyond our a-
bility to think on our own...
they never said that about any
of the Puerto Ricans - they ne-
ver said that they didn't know
what they were doing. They're
also appealing to our white
supremacy - they say, we un-
derstand, that you're just be-
ing influenced and we'll give
you another chance. Part of
their strategy in calling No.
Americans was to see what
would be the response - not that
they really thought we would
collaborate, but what could
they shake up and see, and
what kind of movement would
we be able to build, and what
kind of information could they
get from us - not necessarily
what we would say to a grand
jury but how we would move,
how we would organize other
people to support the stand
that we had taken...
Non-collaboration isn't just
refusing to testify before a
grand jury - it's a political
stance that we're not going to
be intimidated. They're not
going to be able to scare us,
and the example of any one
person who refuses to testify

before a grand jury provides
the rest of the movement a
very important example. When
they don't scare the people
who they're most directly at-
tacking, it gives other people
a sense that... there's a move-
ment to support people who re-
fuse to collaborate.
