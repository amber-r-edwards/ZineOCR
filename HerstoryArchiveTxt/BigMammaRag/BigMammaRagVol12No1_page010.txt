Dear Sisters,

We are North American wom-  
en currently staying in  
Managua where we are study-  
ing Spanish and acquainting  

the revolution must under-  
stand the reality of Nicar-  
agua.

The struggle of Nicarag-  
uense women has been long.  
It will continue to be.  
Issues like abortion are  
not easily addressed. We  
might expect this in a pro-  
foundly Catholic country  
that has also lost 50,000  

nicaraguan self-determination  

ourselves with the revolu-  
tion that is Nicaragua Lib-  
re. We are here following  
various concerns, a promin-  
ent one being the struggle  
of women within the revolu-  
tion. What we have seen  
testifies to the extraord-  
inary process of a people  
working en masse with pat-  
ience and with strength to  
define the fought-for terms  
of national independence.  
As North American women  
we feel an enormous respon-  
sibility toward the defense  
of Nicaragua's revolution  
from the increasingly alarm-  
ing attacks by the United  
States. American feminists  
who have had reservations  
about women's roles within  

(and counting) people  
throughout the insurrection  
and the continuing counter-  
revolutionary attacks. The  
integration of women into  
production requires a mas-  
sive effort that is just be-  
ginning to find its way.  
There is, as many women  

have told us, the continuing  
tradition of male irrespon-  
sibility and/or dominance  

in the home.

However, we must look at  
it another way. The mass or-  
ganization of women, Asocia-  
cion de Mujeres Nicaraguen-  
ses Luisa Amanda Espinosa  
in the law-making body of  
the government. The govern-  
ment, through AMNLAE is  
working to set up childcare  

centers nationwide. The re-  
cently adopted law of nur-  
ture requires equal respon-  
sibility from both parents,  
married or not, for the care  
and upbringing of their  
children.

Revolutionary Nicaragua  
immediately set up a system  
of socialized medicine. It  
ran massive and successful  
vaccination campaigns for  
malaria, polio and smallpox.  
It ran the by now well-known  
literacy campaign, which  
reached some 80% of a funda-  
mentally illiterate popula-  
tion, a majority of them  
women, so they can now read  
information about themselves  
and their world. Access to  
information is the right of  
everyone.

Access to information ab-  
out Nicaragua is a right  
that is not provided in prac-  
tice to North Americans.

The above list goes on and  
on. Looking at it, we might  
wish for the same ability  
to participate in, and care  
for, our own government.  
Looking at Nicaragua, we  
are made certain of the  
rightness of its process,  
not only in and of itself,  

Anti-Imperialist Women Confront  

Women Against Imperialism  

On Dec. 5, 1983, in Manag-  
ua, Nicaragua, people are  
in the streets, hurriedly  
digging trenches to protect  

san francisco  

themselves from bombing  
raids by CIA planes--Nicar-  
agua is braced for a US-  
sponsored invasion. Everyone  
is sharing news from the  
front, where the militia is  
fighting 14,000 CIA contras.  
The city bustles with move-  
ment, but in the wake of  
the CIA bombings of Corinto  
oil reserves, moving cars  
are few in number.

Cut to San Francisco, CA:  
On the same day, well-heeled  
Christmas shoppers rush  
past each other in the hur-  
ry to buy, buy, buy in the  
last days before Christmas.  
Lights brightly shining in  
"holiday spirit", people  
pack themselves and their  
bundles into their cars,  
and push their way through  
traffic.

A group of 40 women, loud  
and very visible, gather in  
Union Square chanting, "No  
business as usual for the  
CIA!" The protesters set off  
to march on the CIA head-  
quarters in downtown San  
Francisco. Their goal is to

but for what its success  
implies for women involved  
in national liberation  
struggles around the world.  
Nicaragua has created a re-  
volution in Nicaraguan  
terms. The large numbers of  
women within AMNLAE or with-  
in any of the mass organi-  
zations are fundamentally  
with the revolution, and do  
not see their struggle as  
possible without it. Nicar-  
agua's self-determination  
through its revolutionary  
process is not negotiable.  
The issue for us, then,  
is what to do about the US  
government. We arrived here  
knowing the detailed his-  
tory of US intervention in  
Nicaragua during this cen-  
tury, including at least 4  
Marine invasions and the  
backing of a half-century  
of Somozas, whose brutality  
resulted in the popular in-  
surrection and triumph of  
the people in 1979. It is  
now 1983, the 4th year of  
a revolution whose policies  
and plans for its future  
are unique in the world.

Since we have been here,  
the attacks on this revolu-  
tion have broadened. The  

CIA Crimes  

target the CIA directly for  
its war crimes in Central  
America and in Grenada, as  
well as in Africa and the  
Middle East. The women car-  
ry large death skulls in-  
scribed with the crimes:  
1954 CIA coup in Guatemala  
...1973 CIA coup in Chile,  
400,000 dead, exiled or  
disappeared.

In counterpart to these  
symbols of death, the women  
carry flags of the libera-  
tion movements and portraits  
of women freedom fighters  
like Comandante Anna Maria  
of the FMLN/FDR.

At the corner of Post and  
Kearny in front of Living-  
ston's Department Store,  
the women point out the  
window display of mannequins  
clad in transparently thin  
red negligees. One woman  
calls out, “The system  
which tortures and murders  
the people of El Salvador  
is the same one that brut-  
alizes us as women. This  
kind of pornographic dis-  
play shows how the US views  
women. This is an example  
of how the violence of rape,  
incest, wife-beating, anti-  
lesbian attacks and degrad-  
ing media images forces us  
into subservient roles.  
Contrast this with the sit-  
uation of women in Nicarag-  
ua where sexist advertising  
has been banned. In Nicara-
