Women’s Health

Service Clinic

1703 North Weber

Colorado Springs, CO 80907

For the past eight months the  
Women’s Health Service  
Clinic of Colorado Springs has  
functioned as a full service  
gynecological clinic for women  
in the Rocky Mountain region.  
The clinic is feminist-owned,  
feminist controlled and staffed  
by women paramedic/health  
workers, a registered nurse  
and one OB/GYN physician.  
The Women's Health Service  
Clinic exists for the purpose of  
providing low cost, quality  
health care for women in this  
area.

Services the clinic provides  
include gynecological exams,  
Pap smears, VD screening,  
pregnancy screening, counseling  
for problem pregnancy, birth  
control counseling and  
services, and first trimester  
abortion. Facilities are available  
for women desiring  
childcare, and overnight  
accommodations are available  
for out-of-town women who  
come for an abortion procedure.

Women who come into the  
clinic can expect a comfortable  
environment where other women  
greet and interview them, where  
their children may play in a  
supervised area while they are  
treated with respect and  
consideration by clinic personnel.  
Refreshments will be available  
in the reception area and,  
although waiting will be kept at a  
minimum, the necessary waiting  
time will be used for education  
and sharing.

The University has money  
available for service-type projects.  
For example, women from the  
community have joined students  
to start and run the Women’s Line,  
which is a hot line. The University  
provides an office, telephone  
and $1,643 a year. This  
telephone referral and counseling  
service is now available to women  
from noon to 6 am at 492-8910.

Boulder is a liveable place for  
women with children because  
there is good public education  
and health care. The Women’s  
Line serves as a source of  
information on resources in the  
community. If a woman’s  
problems are beyond the scope  
of the Line, we direct her to  
someone who can offer further  
assistance.

We also keep informed and  
up to date on local events that  
interest women and can pass  
this information on to callers.

The Women's Line was opened  
in August of 1975 and is part of  
the Women’s Project, an  
organization on the CU Boulder  
Campus funded through the  
University of Colorado student  
union. The UCSU has given a  
lot of moral as well as financial  
support. The Women’s Project is  
also involved with a self-defense  
course and medical self-help  
groups.

The founder and first director  
of the Women’s Line was  
Suzie Wiggins. The first  
volunteers began their training  
last June. The training course  
lasts 16 weeks and meets for 3  
hours each week. It includes  
crisis intervention and general  
counseling techniques which  
concentrate on areas such as  
rape, abortion, birth control,  
drugs, alcoholism, relationships,  
roles and sexuality.

Emphasis is placed on building  
skills in helpful responses which  
may synthesize parts of a problem  
or put a caller more in touch  
with herself. The training is  
accomplished through lectures,  
readings, role playing and real  
playing. In real playing a trainee  
acts out being a caller, using a  
problem from her own life. She  
gains insight into her own  
situation and becomes a better  
counselor through being in  
touch with herself.

If therapy is indicated, we will  
refer the caller to a qualified  
therapist. If she wants a  
pregnancy test, we can tell her  
where to get one.

We're here for the times when  
a woman feels lonely, helpless,  
defeated, but we're also here  
to share the joy of a good day  
or an exciting experience. Call  
us: 492-8910 from noon to 6 am,  
seven days a week.

There are a number of very  
active community women's  
services and reform projects in  
Boulder. For example, Boulder  
has the biggest and most active  
NOW chapter in the state. They  
have 100 dues paying members  
who help in the electoral  
campaigns of women politicians,  
monitor city council meetings,  
start CR groups and work for  
the ERA.

The Resource Center and  
Womanpower are well funded  
useful projects for women. The  
Resource Center gets $25,000  
and Womanpower $12,000 a year  
from the city, special grants and  
contributions. They use this  
money to run a referral service  
on housing, jobs, legal aid,  
day care etc. and offer  
paraprofessional counseling  
service, especially job counseling  
for older women in transition.

They put out an excellent  
handbook on all the social  
services in Boulder—legal,  
medical, welfare etc. They run  
a brown bag lunch program  
where women come to discuss  
feminist issues informally at  
lunchtime. They do outreach to  
low income and minority people  
and start support groups around  
issues such as divorce,  
problems raising children,  
single female head of families  
etc. Recently
