Big Mountain Survival Gathering ton pace

On October 28, 1979, Roberta  
Blackgoat, chairperson, and 64  
elders of the Independent Diné  
Nation at Big Mountain, signed  
the Declaration of Indepen-  
dence, from which the follow-  
ing excerpts are taken:

The U.S. Government and the  
Navajo Tribal Council have  
violated the sacred laws of  
the Diné (Navajo) Nation...  
(They have) divided the indi-  
genous people by boundaries  
of politics, Euro-American  
education, modernization and  
Christianity. The U.S. denies  
our rights to exist as indi-  
genous people on Mother Earth.  
The Livelihood of the Diné,  
the Livestock, has been exter-  
minated, and thereby starva-  
tion exists among the elders.  
Our sacred shrines have been  
destroyed. Our Mother Earth  
is raped by the exploitation  
of coal, uranium, oil, nat-  
ural gas...we speak for the  
winged beings, and those who  
have gone before us and the  
coming generations. We seek  
no changes in our Livelihood  
because this natural Life is  
our only known survival and  
at our Sacred Law...the  
genocidal system of the fed-  
eral government is destroying  
our true existence as a trad-  
itional nation at Big Mountain.

As Third World countries  
have moved to nationalize  
foreign owned mining and oil  
operations, and have other-  
wise become less "stable" en-  
vironments for foreign capi-  
tal, Corporate Amerika has in-  
creasingly turned to lands  
within its "own" borders for  
resources. This has brought  
the government into direct  
confrontation with the tradi-  
tional caretakers of the Mo-  
ther Earth, Native peoples,  
who are strongly resisting  
the exploitation and plunder  
of the Earth.

The forced relocation of  
Diné and Hopi people and their  
struggle to maintain/regain  
their sovereignty is connected  
to the struggles of all Native  
American peoples and the  
struggles of peoples around  
the world for sovereignty,  
land rights and against im-  
perialist domination. As a  
white feminist lesbian, I went  
to the Big Mountain Survival  
Gathering both to give support  
to the resistance there and to  
learn from the elders and  
their struggles. I learned/  
am learning from a culture  
that has tremendous respect  
for the earth and all living  
things. In order to defeat a  
system that commits genocide  
against Native Peoples,  
against Third World peoples;  
that encourages the battering,  
rape and murder of women and  
children; that exploits and  
plunders the earth as it does  
people, especially women, all  
peoples will need to be fight-  
ing together. We need to make  
the connections - between  
National Liberation Movements,  
the Women's Liberation Move-  
ment, indigenous peoples'  
struggles...We must learn  

how to respect, trust and  
work with each other.

The relocation of people  

from the JUA is supposed to  
be fully implemented by 1986.  
But the Diné and Hopi peoples  
will not be moved from the  
land which they have lived on  
and with for centuries. They  
need support now in several  
forms:  
1) People to go to Big Moun-  
tain to help out because of  
increased police harassment.  
2) Raising money.  

Send to: Kee Shay,  
203, Oraibi, via Ariz.  
3) Donating food:  

Contact: Marie Stinewachs,  
Ozark Area Community Congress,  
Box 129, Drury, MO 65638,  
417-261-2553.

4) Call the Phoenix, AZ, BIA  

to protest the forced reloca-  
tion. Call James Stevens, BIA  
area director, 602-241-2305.

5) Ongoing education in your  

communities about the crisis  

at Big Mountain.

In 1986, the people at Big  
Mountain and the rest of the  
JUA may need support in the  
form of bodies standing up  
militantly with them against  
the U.S. government forcibly  
removing them from the land.

Rage 12 < Big Mama Rag, June, 1983-

The following speech was given by Katherine Smith at the  
Big Mountain Gathering.

..-Today I am accused of building a new structure on Hopi  
Partition land (Because of PL 93-531, no new structures  
can be built if a Diné is living on "Hopi" land, or vice  
versa.). Just this winter some people from the Hopi tribe  
came out to my house and they were asking me why I am build-  
ing a home on Hopi land. I told them why and that the rea-  
son why was that I was born here and also that I will not  
recognize whatever they're telling me. I do not recognize  
whatever law they represent. Because how they had approach-  
ed me, how they had received me, seemed like I didn't know  
them or they didn't know me. So I told them, let's discuss  
the land problem. I told him that he does not have the po-  
wer or the authority to say those words to me because his  
hair was black and his eyes were brown. And I told him that  
with the problem with the land dispute and all the pressure  
we are up against, that he is not responsible for. And that  
all papers signed and all discussions done, are being done  
in Phoenix and Tucson; outside and far away from the reser-  
vation, not in Oraibi (Hopi capital). She hasn't gone out  
to these big meetings out in the cities and she hasn't  
signed her name for this land to be partitioned. I told him  
to look at himself and see that he is not a white man. And  
to see her, that she is not standing on foreign soil. That  
she is standing in the middle of the hogans which we call
