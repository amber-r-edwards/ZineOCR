Women Protest

A statement signed by 29
members of the Sagaris faculty
and student body was formulated in protest to the
Sagaris’ collective acceptance of
a large grant from the Ms.
Foundation. The women who
signed the statement feel that a
wrong decision was made
because the Sagaris collective
failed to consider the political
implications of accepting money
from an organization currently
under scrutiny by the feminist
community. The Sagaris collective
has avoided a political
platform from which to make
decisions in conjunction with
expediency and financial concerns. Lack of political definition,
the dissenters say, is the basis of
the current problem.

According to the statement,
‘The final decision-making
power at Sagaris lies with the
collective. Therefore, Sagaris as

by slides showing women in all
kinds of non-traditional jobs,
from heavy equipment operation
to construction and typewriter
repair.

The show emphasized that in
order to get one of these better
jobs, the first thing a woman
must do is to learn a trade and to
get good at it.

Telling it like it is, some of the
difficulties to be encountered
were also shown: the fact that

few women are physically up to
the hard labor involved at first.
They must acclimate themselves
to it. Some stress was laid on the
fact that some of these jobs are
hazardous, and that safety
precautions are essential. Working
conditions are often uncomfortable
and must also be adjusted to: noise,
heat, cold, dirt, fumes. Further, a
woman must expect to meet
with both subtle and overt
hostility from the men she

and ask for bail.
Immunity
Although a witness before a
grand jury has the 5th
Amendment's protection
against self-incrimination, that
protection can be taken away
once a witness is granted immunity. Immunity is supposed to
be a guarantee that the witness’
testimony will not be used
against her. Once you are
“granted” immunity, you can no
longer plead the Fifth.

However, a new kind of immunity — “use” immunity —
was invented and made constitutional in 1970 during the
advent of the Nixon-Mitchell
Supreme Court. Use immunity
provides that only the witness’
own testimony leads which can
be shown to have developed
directly from that testimony will
not be used against her. But it
does not necessarily protect you
from prosecution because any
other witness’ testimony, hearsay
or illegally gathered evidence can
still be used to indict you.

Once immunity is granted, you
must testify. If you refuse you
may be cited for contempt of
court (before a nearby judge) and
jailed immediately. You will
remain in jail until:

grand jury is over. However, they

an institution reflected the
values and politics of the collective. What are the values and
goals of Sagaris? Sagaris has
presented itself as “open to the
changing needs and ideas of the
radical feminist movement,”
and, ‘we feel that if the only way
Sagaris could exist is to become
a liberal non-threatening
educational institution then
Sagaris should not exist at all.”

The collective, however, purports
to have no specific politics.

The dissenters feel that the
stated goals cannot be realized
within the present structure and
pose the question: is it possible
to have a non-political structure
with political content?

Their contention is that it is
impossible not to have specific
politics and it is this that has
brought the collective to the
present state of crisis.

works with. She may not receive
adequate instruction in her job.
She will probably be the only
woman present, so that she can
expect no support from others. In
order to cope with these
problems, a woman must have
self-confidence, sense of humor
and determination.

Asking whether, at this rate,
these really are “better jobs” for
women, the answer for many
women is, ‘yes’. The biggest
asset is the paycheck, the fringe
benefits, and the security of
having a marketable skill. To
succeed in such a job can give a
woman greater self-confidence
and prove to her that she can live
in a man’s world.

go through the whole process
again. So far, no witness has
ever served a full 18 month
sentence.

2. You answer their questions.
Every thirty days they may bring
you back to court for questioning.

3. You are released on bail
pending an appeal of the contempt
citation.

4. They release you or you
escape.

If you are not given immunity,
your 5th Amendment rights
stand and you do not have to
answer questions which you feel
incriminate you. The prosecutor
will then dismiss your subpoena or, if he feels he has enough
evidence against you without your testimony, indict you. Then you and your lawyer will prepare a criminal defense, just as in any case in which a person is charged with a crime.

The Guild grand jury pamphlet
also has sections on what it
means to cooperate with the FBI,
and how to organize a defense
committee.

But remember, if you are
subpoenaed before a grand jury,
seek legal help immediately.

Prison Letters...

From Page 5

after being so long in that hole.

The purpose of this letter is for
my release of my feelings. I don't
correspond often to the outside
world. I have no one to communicate with. So whomever is
reading this, thanks for your
time. It took my “time” to scribe
it.

As for this place, the mail is
read. I feel it has to be the most
degrading and dehumanizing
practice of these people. When
we are not able to talk personally
to our loved ones and friends or
to see them, then the only
avenue of communication left is
by mail. Letters anyway is all
there is for me and they are used
in the same way free people use
a smile, frown, caress or even a
blow. I adjust to most things
fairly easily and I managed to
accept the fact the state has full
possession of my body. These
people have my whereabouts 24
hours a day. But still I can’t get
used to them trying to dwell in
my soul. You know, it is pretty
ugly to be undressed and
handled and searched both your
physical person and your personal
effects, but still it’s not as
bad as to have your mail read.
Looking at one’s naked body
doesn't show or tell anything
about the person and after a
while I may get used to it where
it will hardly bother me at all
other than the inconvenience.
To me they give or get nothing
out of or from searching and
staring at my naked body, but
they do get all of me by reading
my mail. It is really bad when
someone has to get their kicks by
someone in prison. No one has a
right to invade another's heart.
BUT they can't dictate my
thoughts or influence my mind.

In the Struggle,
Thomasina

Pen Pal List
Dear Linda,

I had the pleasure of meeting
you recently at the prison. I am
doing a 3 to 5 sentence. I would
like very much to have a free
subscription for your paper. Also
if you have any sort of pen pal
list, I would like to be on it.
Thank you,

The Oppressors’ Weapon
Dear BMR,

I, Deborah Denice Sharpless,
of the North Carolina Correctional Center for Women was
talked to by the two (2) members
of your reporting team on July
31, 1975.

I was also told that I could
subscribe to you for papers. This
I would like to do.

I feel that they have taken
away all of our privileges but I do
feel I can accept newspapers
from you.

Also, I would like to receive
some of the older papers that
you would like to send me.

I gave your reporters all that I

try to hear what we are saying.
We must be heard... we will not
be silenced!

Inadequate or non-existent
childcare (the refusal to deal
with it), the exclusion of poor
and/or mothers of male children
lays down a caste system within
our own so-called communities.
The caste system breaks down
this way:

1st class-caste is a woman
without children.
2nd class-caste is a woman
with female children.

3rd class-caste is a woman
with male children.

Caste and class mean refusal
to deal with classism, sexism,
and, in the final analysis, racism.
The politics of separatism, when
carried to its logical conclusion,
or responsibility; I'm not my
sister's keeper; she got knocked
up; fuck off bitch,’ are obviously
an upper middle class, fascist
and patriarchal concept.
Fascism and middle class attitudes
of ignorance come out of
patriarchy, or have you even
thought about it?

Children and the responsibility
of raising them was valued
during the matriarchy. To consider
women in “subservient” roles as
mothers is a patriarchal attitude.

The converse of the idea that
mothers should give up their
children is that women are
shirking their duties by not
raising them. This is obviously
oppressive. We're not telling you
to have children... what makes
you think you can tell anyone to
leave their children behind
when they are and always have
been an integral part of any
women's community!

We can’t all leap through the
fields enraptured with Goddess
worship. Most of us must work
to survive. We turn tricks, shoot
dope to forget, fight for racial
and/or cultural identity, and we
all raise children. We can't
afford to live in the country
economically or politically. We
are talking about reality!

By excluding mothers you
have not dealt with the realities
of who and what women are and
what the real battles are, fundamentally, courtroom battles.
While the oppression of mothers
and their children will not end
without a basic reorganization of
society, its attitudes and
economic structure, the minute
you turn your backs on the
courts condemning such activity
as reformism, the ‘man’ sneaks
in new and harder punishments,
sugar-coating the whole thing
with token changes such as
lenient marijuana laws. Why are
the prisons full of third world
women and/or poor people?
Why do lesbian mothers lose
their children?

Is it because most people don't
give a shit about anyone or
anything but themselves and
their needs and how to push
their needs down other people's
throats? And is that why we
come together for ‘sharing’ and
then divide into our ‘own’ little
cliques, or covens, if you will.

It is time for all of us to ask
these kinds of questions, seek
answers, and then struggle to
build that answer in a realistic
way. We are waiting to see your
answers in practice and action.
We need to see... we are tired of
volumes and volumes of
rhetoric. (Organization names
are only for identification pur-
poses.)
