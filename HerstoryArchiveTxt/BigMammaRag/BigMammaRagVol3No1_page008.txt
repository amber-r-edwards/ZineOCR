CLUW Begins
Unifying Union Women

The first statewide confer-
ence of the Coalition of Labor
Union Women (CLUW) was
held in Denver on June 8th at
the Albany Hotel.

The CLUW is a new,
national organization formed
to fight for the needs of
working women through un-
ion structures. It was founded
in Chicago on March 23-24th.

“The primary purpose of
this new coalition is to unify
all union women in a viable
organization, first -- to deter-
mine our common problems
and concerns, and second --
to develop action programs
within the framework of our
unions to deal effectively with
our objectives.

We recognize that our
struggle goes beyond the
borders of this nation and
seek to link up with our
working sisters and brothers
throughout the world through
concrete action of interna-
tional workers’ solidarity.

Through unity of purpose,
the Coalition of Labor Union
Women will seek to accom-
plish these goals.” CLUW
Statement of Purpose

Colorado's first CLUW
conference got off to a
spirited start with Debbie
Singer playing guitar and
everyone singing “Union
Maid.” There was an intro-
ductory speech by Chairwo-
man Joyce Newell, followed
by a talk by Dr. Jeanne
Stellman of the Oil, Chemical
and Atomic Workers Union on

a ud {
Well, hi! You must be the new
girl for the typing pool, I’m
your supervisor, Mr. Swiney. BN
And you're...? { .

“Women and Health and
Safety.” Dr. Stellman is the
author of the book Work is

Dangerous to Your Health.

She said that most research
on health hazards is done
primarily for men, and that the
only time they think about
women is during pregnancy.
“And obviously what's harm-
ful to you when you're
pregnant is harmful to your
health even when you're not.”
Stellman was followed by
Leslie Nader of the Amalga-
mated Clothing Workers Un-
ion on “Childcare.” Ms.
Nader talked about a union-
sponsored day care center
which Amalgamated Clothing
Workers of America have
started in Chicago, and which
is completely free to the
employee. It is quality day
care that provides an enrich-
ing, stimulating experience
for children, and not merely
custodial care. She said that
eight percent of Amalgamated
members are women and that
childcare is not a women’s
problem; it is a problem that
should concern all people
interested in the future.
“Even Our Union Brothers”
Irene Chandler, United
Farmworkers Union, spoke on
“Organizing, Strikes and Boy-
cotts.” She said a big problem
is that men don’t take women
seriously and this even
applies to our union brothers.
“We must learn to stick
together and let them know

Dear Big Mama Rag,

My apologies for not writing
sooner. I was really elated way
back in January, February
(when?) when I found your (or my)
newspaper at the Woman’s Voice.
It was the second issue I think,
but I really enjoyed it. Thank you
for the list of places where it can
be found. I think you really cover
a lot of ground and have a good
variety. Do you still do a little on
Women's History? I was really
surprised to learn that women
have done so much in the past,
but the only areas that I can find
out about are sports and
medicine. What about law,
politics, art, religion, etc? Do you
have any good suggestions on
reading? I just want you to know
that women in Denver are
interested in reading, but we're a
little slow at writing.

Love you all!
Sheri Shortridge

Ed: This issue is the ninth issue
of BMR to date. Last year we had
several articles on women's
history, and would like very much
to have more, but we have had no
manuscripts submitted. Anyone
interested? The BMR staff re-
cently has been reading Mothers
and Amazons and The First Sex.

HAWK BIG MAMA!

My charge for condescending
remarks is 15%.

Dear Big Mama Rag Staff:

We have read our copy of Big
Mama Rag with interest and
admiration for your professional-
ism. We are entering an exchange
subscription; you will receive
your first issue late next month.

We were the first statewide
Feminist publication in the
United States, according to
research at the Women’s History
Archive. Our first issue came out
in January 1972. We are aware of
only three others: New Direc-
tions for Women in Delaware, The
Texan Woman (I have not heard
from them lately), and Big Mama
Rag.

To the Staff--and particularly to
Linda:

I enjoyed the copy of the paper
you just sent me. It is very well
done, and very important, I
believe, to the women’s move-
ment in this area. Essential at
this time, in fact.

Linda, I liked the article you
did, based on your interview with
me. It was well written, honest,
and genuinely reflective of our
talk, I think. Thanks.

Sincerely,

Charlotte Wolf

I'm here to fix your Xerox 300.

Good luck in your pioneering.
We look forward to your future
issues,

Editorial
Just Reduction of People?

The Talmadge Amendment has demonstrated that its goal is
the reduction of the number of people on welfare - nothing else.
Concern for the human condition of people who need assistance
to survive in this country is probably written somewhere in a
memo connected with this law but has never been a part of it.
The distorted, prejudiced stereotypes that make receiving welfare
a stigma in this society have been strengthened again and again
through the work ethic. Expending physical or mental energy -
does not make a person well-off, rich, or even maintain a
sustenance level of life. Work has nothing to do with wealth. The
survival of this economy necessitates the existence of a welfare
class.

It is the unskilled woman, minority and non-minority, who is
forced to prostitute herself in a meaningless, dead-end, slave
wage job for the Department of Welfare that is unaware of and
unresponsive to her needs. Even within these “improvement”
programs men receive priority in training over women although
women are the vast majority of welfare recipients. But now it is
the women on welfare who are uniting and supporting each other
in their struggle. We support Chicana Welfare Rights nationally
and locally in their efforts to repeal the Talmadge Amendment to
the Social Security Act.

One Reader’s Opinion

Carol Hansford

A “straight” woman is a woman without any feminist
consciousness. A straight woman is not merely a woman who
sleeps only with men. Defining a woman as “straight,” if she is
not homosexual, creates resentment which ultimately can lead
to alienation from other women.

Some lesbians feel that all women are lesbians whether they
know or will admit it. All women are not lesbians just as all
women are not heterosexuals. It is lesbian chauvinism to think
otherwise. Commitment to other women does exist - strong and
honest without sexual involvement. It comes from a true, deep
feeling of women as sisters; it is not dependent on sexual
encounters.

There seems to be a feeling of “more Feminist than thou” by
some lesbians in the movement whose actions and attitudes say,
“If I sleep with a woman, I am more radical, heavy, together than
a woman who sleeps alone, with men or with women and men.”

An aspect of feminism is that a woman must control her own
body - all aspects of her body - in the area of sexual activity as
well as motherhood. Feminism also demands the making of a
woman's culture through the creation of viable alternatives and
the denial of any oppression among people: honesty.

Some Feminists recognize lesbianism as a viable alternative,
although sections of the lesbian movement don't recognize
heterosexuality as a viable alternative. Heterosexuality is not
exclusively culturally determined. All women have the option of
accepting or rejecting it. It is a choice that Feminists make.
Straight women don’t make that choice. They are locked into
societal expectations of their sexual behavior, but Feminists
have stepped away from this and are not bound by such stringent
social roles.

As long as sexual preference is allowed to create a difference
among Feminists, the divisiveness rampant in this women’s
movement will remain and be a detriment to real change. Women
should unite around their politics, not their sexual proclivities.
Let's put our energy into fighting sexism - our common enemy.
