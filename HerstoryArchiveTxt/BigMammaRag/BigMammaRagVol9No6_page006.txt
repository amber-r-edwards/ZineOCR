Rage On The Rag

What's the cause of female

crime? These days, some law-
yers are saying it's pregnancy
and pre-menstrual tension. The
judges are apparently listen-
ing. British courts accept
premenstrual tension as a mi-
tigation factor in cases in-
volving women. In France,
the syndrome may serve as
grounds for a temporary insan-
ity plea. And in Canada last
month, a judge agreed that a
defendant's crime sprees
seemed linked to her pregnan-
cies.

Sleepless Nights

A 52-year-old Calloway,
Florida, woman has chosen to
go to jail instead of paying
a fine for cussing out a poli-
tician she helped oust from
office.

Angela Long says she
uttered dread words to a city
official the day her car skid-
ded on raw sewage near a con-
struction site.

The official, who had
been recalled from office in
a campaign spearheaded by
Long, complained to the court
that he was unable to sleep
well after hearing Long's
language.

Assistant
Clinton Foster
case: (quote) "You don't
get out in the streets and
scream and cuss to get some-
thing accomplished." Long,
however, has vowed she would
rather serve 30 days' time
than pay a fine for calling
the former city commissioner
a ‘son of a bitch.’

Backfiring

A women's organization in
Bern, Switzerland, is suing
a Swiss Army company for
using pictures of nude wo-
men as targets during tar-
get practice. The women's
group stated that this was
an offensive action and an
insult to the dignity of
women, and refused a conci-
liation attempt made by the
Commander of the company.
The complaint goes before
the Swiss Supreme Court in
the near future, where the
women's organization will
demand that the Army donate
money to women's groups as
compensation.

Right To Life

Arizona State Representa-
tive Jim Rattcliff, a noted
"right-to-life" advocate, has
conceded that he can see at
least one situation in which
abortion should be permitted.
Rattcliff allowed an exception
when a woman "is impregnated
by a colored rapist." When
pressed on the Phoenix radio
interview to explain the diff-
erence between rape by a black
or a white rapist, Rattcliff,
who describes himself as "a
very religious man," replied
only, "It makes a hell of a
lot of difference."

Fair Drug Deal

A major drug company,
Schering Corp., will offer more
than $765,000 in back pay and
incentives to women blue-col-
lar workers in a sex-discrimi-
nation settlement. The com-
pany is the third major drug
company to settle an equal em-
ployment opportunity case with
the US Labor Department in the
last two years. Schering's fe-
male employees were concentra-
ted in packaging and quality-
control jobs paying less than
those in predominantly male
chemical and production areas.

Imagine That!

Larry Kozlicki, co-owner
of a women's professional
basketball team in Omaha,
says he sent players to a
modeling school last year
to improve their poise and
appearance, but “the girls
didn't take to the idea....
I don't know why, really."

Sweet Silky Death

Two medical journals, Lan-
cet and Modern Medicine,
have carried reports link-
ing cosmetic talc and ovar-
ian cancer. The use of talc
among women often begins
with baby powder in infancy
and continues into adult-
hood. It is believed that
this form of cancer has a

20 to 40 year latency per-
iod. It is often fatal and
is on the rise in industrial
nations.

Gay Rats

Disco music causes homo-
sexuality in mice, according
to researchers at the Izmir
based Aegean University.
They discovered that high-
level noise also causes deaf-
ness among pigs. The re-
searchers feel there is a
lesson in these studies for
humans, though they offered
no explanations as to why
mice were resistant to deaf-
ness or why pigs kept their
sexual identities.

Abolishing Abortions

The Utah legislature has
come up with some new harass-
ment techniques for women
wanting abortions.

At least 24 hours before
an abortion is performed,
every Utah doctor has to
sign a form saying that the
woman who has chosen abor-
tion has been shown "des-
criptions of the physical
characteristics of a normal
unborn child described at
two-week intervals, begin-
ning with the fourth week
and ending with the 24th
week.

And pictures, too. To go
along with these descrip-
tions, the doctor must also
show the woman "scientifi-
cally verified photographs
of the unborn child" during
various stages of its devel-
opment.

The measure passed the
Utah Senate 21-4. The Senate
rejected 7-11 an amendment
which would have exempted
women who had become preg-
nant as a result of incest
or rape. Senator Verl Asay
said that incest and rape
have been used as "a loop-
hole for abortions," adding
that he considered murder a
more serious crime than rape
or incest.

Chemical Warfare

A new, potentially toxic,
chemical compound, is intro-
duced into the workplace in
the U.S. every 20 minutes,
reports the Occupational
Safety and Health Administra-
tion (OSHA). An estimated
25 million workers come into
almost daily contact with
these killer chemicals. So,
Reagan stopped a regulation
that would have required
clear labeling on these chem-
icals, most of which have
no labels at all. Of course,
the chemical industry is hail-
ing Reagan's decision as a
great "cost saver" since it
will mean even greater no-
risk profits for these big
business operators.

Technology Strikes

Grace Hartman, president of
the Canadian Union of Public
Employees, notes that wide-
spread use of video display
terminals and word processors
could mean that 30 to 75% of
women in banks, post offices,
and sales and clerical jobs
will be unemployed within the
next five years.

Hartman says that if women
don't start paying attention
to this issue now, technolo-
gical change will result in
young women fresh out of high
school being “totally redund-
ant" in the job market, forc-
ing them to stay home.

Perverted Fabric

Harold Covington, former
Republican primary candidate
for state attorney general
and an avowed Nazi, has
called for the extermination
of gay people in a recorded
"White Power" telephone mes-
sage.

Covington, who won 43% of
the vote in last May's Re-
publican election, declared
that the laws of his pro-
posed "free state" will pun-
ish homosexuality with
death. The reason for this
is not so much to punish in-
dividual queers--and I will
admit that like all diseases
we will probably never suc-
ceed in wiping out homosex-
uality altogether--but by
such heavy penalties we will
drive this filthy perversion
so far back into the closet
that it will never again
threaten the basic fabric of
our society as it does now.
