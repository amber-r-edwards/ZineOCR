Playing For Change

The First International  
Marxist Poker Collective is  
now being formed in Toronto,  
Canada. They have regular  
weekly games and according  
to a spokeswoman, "We play  
for change."

Cages Are Cages

Innovative architecture will  
do little to disguise the  
caging of human beings, tempt-  
ing as the ideas may be to  
many architects. Current plans  
call for an "X-shaped" addi-  
tion to the Marion County Jail  
in Indianapolis, pre-fab  
“insta-jail" in Broward County,  
Fla., a "butterfly" facility  
in Cincinnati and a two-story,  
288-cell maximum security,  
"snowflake" in Bucks County,  
Texas.

A cage is a cage is a cage.

Woman Faces Retrial

On Aug. 25, a Norwegian jury  
acquitted a woman charged with  
the murder of her husband. She  
had admitted shooting him a  
year ago, but the jury accep-  
ted that this was her last  
desperate attempt to get out  
of a marriage in which her  
husband had terrorized her  
with violence for 18 years.  
The 3 judges, however, over-  
ruled the jury's decision, as  
they considered she was guilty  
of the crime with which she  
was charged. This means a re-  
trial with a new judge and  
jury. The woman has been re-  
leased from jail, at least  
temporarily.

Rape Is OK With Toy

A Washington State appeals  
court has ruled that a woman  
was not raped when she sub-  
mitted to a sex act with a man  
brandishing what she thought  
was a pistol, because the re-  
volver turned out to be a toy.  
Under state law, an assailant  
can only be convicted of rape  
if a lethal instrument or  
threat of force is used a-  
gainst the victim. -

Gays Protest Murder

Last spring, Roman gays took  
to the downtown streets to  
protest the murder of a member  
of their community, Salvatore  
Pappalardo. The murder finally  
angered gay men enough to take  
action around the increasing  
violence against them. The May  
15 demonstration was attended  
by more than 1,000 lesbians,  
gay men and other leftists.

Anti-Shock Initiative

The Coalition to Stop Elec-  
troshock has been successful  
in putting an initiative to  
ban shock on the Berkeley, CA  
ballot this November. 2,452  
signatures were collected in  
six days; 1,400 were required  
in order to get the initia-  
tive on the ballot. The ini-  
tiative is entitled, "An Act  
to Protect the Human Rights of  
Psychiatric Patients by Pro-  
hibiting the Use of Electric  
Shock Treatment in Berkeley."  
The opposition wrote an argu-  
ment entitled, "Argument in  
Favor of the Protection of  
the Human Right to Choose an  
Improved State of Health and  
Quality of Life by Utilizing  
Electroconvulsive Therapy when  
deemed Medically and Legally  
Appropriate."

Electroshock is very dama-  
ging, both physically and  
emotionally, and people  
are not informed of what it  
will do to them.

When Will It End?

Lori Ann Newman lives in a  
Tacoma, WA, apartment with her  
two-year-old daughter, Toni.  
On Aug. 2, Renard Vaughn broke  
into Lori's apartment and  
raped her. On Aug. 9, he again  
broke into her apartment, this  
time stealing furniture. Lori  
was asleep at 4:30 am Sept. 11,  
when Vaughn banged on her  
door. She refused to let him  
in. He demanded entry. Lori  
fired one shot from a .38  
caliber pistol which went  
through the apartment door  
and killed Vaughn. She has  
been charged with first-degree  
manslaughter for this. She is  
out of jail on $3,000 bail.  
Trial date is set for Nov. 1.

Bank Clerks Unite

Of 14,000 banks in the U.S.  
fewer than 30 are unionized,  
despite the low wages bank  
clericals make. Recently, the  
85 clerical workers at the  
New York office of the State  
Bank of India voted to join  
the International Longshore-  
men's Association (ILA). The  
victory was the ILA's first  
at a bank, and apparently the  
first by any union at a bank  
in the last two years. Organ-  
izers attributed the victory  
to worker militancy and the  
fact that the bank is so small  
it could not shift workers  
from branch to branch, a com-  
mon antiunion tactic. Most of  
the bank workers are of Indian  
descent.

Eliminating “Vermin”

Fort Lauderdale, Fla., city  
officials are considering  
spraying beachfront trash cans  
with kerosene or chemicals to  
keep "transients" from living  
off garbage. Robert Cox, spon-  
sor of the proposal to protect  
the garbage from being devour-  
ed by humans, said, "The way  
to get rid of roaches or other  
vermin in the house is to get  
rid of their food supply."

And this in a time when many  
people are subsisting on dog  
food in this country.

Western Capitulates

Western Airlines - reacting  
to pressure from religious  
groups - has stopped cooper-  
ating with the U.S. govern-  
ment's efforts to deport Sal-  
vadorans living illegally in  
this country. The Los Angeles  
based airline made a proced-  
ural change Sept. 2 preventing  
the U.S. Immigration and Nat-  
uralization Service (INS) from  
buying seats for Salvadoran  
refugees. Five to ten percent  
of those deported are killed  
almost as soon as they get  
back. The policy switch on  
Western's part averted a na-  
tional boycott of the airline.  
How the INS intends to return  
the Salvadorans to their coun-  
try is still unclear.

House To Offer Hope

Louisa Lawson House is a  
planned refuge which will pro-  
vide accommodation and support  
in Waverly, Australia, for wo-  

men experiencing madness. The  

women involved want to stop  
the kind of journey many wo-  
men have experienced and are  
still experiencing once they  
enter the psychiatric hospi-  

tal - lifelong drug dependency,  

electric shock, lobotomy, in-  
stitutionalization, loss of  
self-esteem and loss of inde-  
pendence.

Tribunal Is Success

The first American Indian  
International Tribunal, held  
in Davis, CA, brought powerful  
indictments against the U.S.  
government, corporations and  
military, and declared soli-  
darity with oppressed people  
around the world. Over 5,000  
people from 85 Native Nations  
around the world and represen-  
tatives from Namibia, South  
Africa, El Salvador, Sweden  
and the U.S. participated in  
the six-day conference.

Dutch Extend Treaty

While the U.S. Immigration  
and Naturalization Service  
fights to keep "alien" gay  
men and lesbians out of the  
country, the Dutch government  
has agreed that homosexuals  
can seek refuge from persecu-  
tion in Holland. The country's  
highest judicial body has  
ruled in the case of a gay  
refugee from Poland that the  
Geneva Refugee Treaty permits  
official refugee status and a  
residence permit for gay peo-  
ple fleeing persecution in  
their own countries. Holland  
is the first country in the  
world to extend the Geneva  
Treaty to lesbians and gays.

More Wife Beating

The relationship between  
unemployment and wife batter-  
ing is well understood in  
Parachute, CO, where the Exxon  
Co. recently abandoned a  
shale-oil drilling project,  
leaving 2,000 people jobless.  
In the following month, re-  
ports of wife-beating rose be  
more than 3,000 percent -  
from one per month to more  
than one daily. And those are  
just the reported ones!
