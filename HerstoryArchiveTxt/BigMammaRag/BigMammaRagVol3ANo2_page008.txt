Synthesizing the Personal

And the Political?

Inevitably the simultaneous
“(There are) two movements: the
formation of the individual in order to
be able to reach the goal individually,
and the preparation of the world.
For the progress of the individual is
so to say not quite held back nor
helped by the condition of the whole,
but that brings about a certain
balance between the two. The in-
dividual movement is always much
more rapid and more penetrating; it
goes much further, more deeply and
more quickly. The collective move-
ment forms a sort of base which both
restrains and supports at the same
time. And it is the balance between
these two movements which is
necessary. Hence the more rapidly
one goes individually, the more it is
necessary to try to extend and fortify
the collective base.”

Synthia process is

There is a dialogue that has
shadowed the efforts of all
groups or individuals who have
attempted to effect change in the
world. Reconciling the two
voices is one way that women
could diminish the confusion in
the movement.

In one camp are the
individualizing people, women who
believe that all efforts at chang-
ing world structures begin with
changing individual con-
sciousness. Until a human being
is centered within herself and
feels some active identity, no
change on a universal level is
possible. This position sees each
human as a microcosm for the

Personal identity is not
separate from the total con-
struct. Every individual
of being, vibrations are
crystallized which radiate out
from the individual and affect
the external reality.

The other opinion is that in a
sick and eroding world, all per-
sonal efforts are undermined.
Change must involve total world
structures, i.e. capitalism, as all
parts of the sick monolith must
be destroyed before an in-
dividual can be free and creative.
Therefore, it is felt that an in-
dividual who goes off on her own
inner journey withdraws her
energies from the world at the
expense of her less privileged
sisters.

It is self-defeating for women
to continue to uphold this split in
our thought and action since
each, operating alone, is only
half the solution.

A Futile Split

Those taking the individual ap-
proach often do retreat. Utopias,
communes, therapy may indulge

emanates a positive or negative
vibration and is irrevocably con-
nected to the whole through this
vibration. In the whole spectrum
ranging from individual to group,
the question becomes what is
politically effective? The point is
to see the relationship of the
development of individual con-
sciousness with the develop-
ment of consciousness on a
socio-political level.

A dynamic illustration is the
way the second wave of the
women’s movement gained
much of its impetus through
consciousness raising groups. In
CR groups, individual women re-
examined themselves and their
values in a feminist context and
found themselves changed to
such a degree that they evolved
toward a larger ideal.

The Politicized Cell

The CR group is analogous to
the individual in the quote above
whose expanded consciousness

individual realizing moves the base (feminist con-
sciousness) forward. The in-

scattered work and bring it into
the mainstream perspective on the individual’s
role. in the scheme of things, whose role is to radicalize the

energy. is lost to the whole. However the collectivist argu- 
ment against individuation fails because any attempt to restruc- 
ture society can only be as effec- 
tive as the individuals are con- 
scious. Moreover, the pitfall of 
thinking only in world view terms is that one may be so 
overwhelmed by the horror of it 
that one tends to reject every 
proposal for action as not being 
inclusive enough. To summarize 
simplistically: one group is 
grounded in isolated ac- 
tion not seen in perspective of 
the whole; the other sees only 
the overall picture and change is 
viewed primarily in external 
terms. 

To fall into the either/or argu- 
ment is to succumb to traditional 
western rationalism which is in- 
consistent with an intuitive and 
connective feminine system ten- 
ding toward synthesis. Actually 
the split is an illusion for in-

organism: the point is

right. Same characters, new
names in the same old play.
Need for Balance

A feminist revolution will
make no more changes than its
predecessors unless along with
external, material changes, it in-
corporates a change in human
consciousness.

It is important for women to
know where the responsibility is
for change in themselves as dis-
tinguished from change in the
outer world. Our small personal
world is a reflection of our in-
dividual consciousness. We
have to take the responsibility
for knowing ourselves and not
avoiding our own inner work.
We are responsible for our
relationships and how we treat
each other; if the individual cell
is damaged (and women’s
lesions extend to self-hate,
doubt etc.) even though that
damage may have come from
outside oppression, we are still
responsible for treating
ourselves, healing, self-work, or
we will be ineffective politically.

If our small world is a reflec-
tion of our individual con-
sciousness, the larger world is a
reflection of the dominant con-
sciousness, which at this point
in history is involved with
patriarchal structures: cor-
porate, technological, military,
and religious. As women we see
a minimal reflection of ourselves
in the larger social organism
because the evolution of a
feminized culture has just
begun. We experience it in our
small enclaves such as CR
groups, but the point is to
radiate, extending the circles of
influence and beginning the out-
er work for which we must also
assume responsibility. The work
must be on all fronts. Begin with
the cell; begin with the social.

Some Suggestions

Bringing it all down means
providing women with concrete
ways of expanding con-
sciousness within the scope of
collective society. Developing a
life-support system for women is
fundamental, for we can't ask
women who live marginally to
extend themselves to the com-
munity unless we assume
responsibility for each other. By
reducing the risks and in-
securities through the establish-
ment of women’s communities
(actual physical structures for
support, survival) we can begin
to develop mutual goals and
common actions. Then efforts to
establish a national congress
around which women can rally,
where ideology can be formed is
more probable. With a solid life
support system behind them,
women will not fear to take ac-
tion against the larger diseased
cell. Then the probability for set-
ting up a national strike of
workers exists. Only when we
make it possible for each of us
individually to grow and thrive
can the feminist ideal be ac-
tivated within the larger social
body.

Presley and the Battle of New Orleans Take all the Attention — In
New Orleans January 8, was proclaimed Women’s Day by Mayor Moon
Landrieu. There were no firecrackers — nay not even a flicker in the local
media. Elvis (“Paunchy”) Presley's birthday and the Battle of New
Orleans received all the local publicity. Mayor Landrieu later said he
would be happy to oblige the women by proclaiming a women’s day just
any old time: “As long as it is not something that would cause a con-
troversy.” (Distaff, Jan.-Feb. 75)

Turn It Again Sam — “Dear Somebody, Is it my imagination, or do
women put the new roll of toilet paper on more often than men? Just
wondering... Ed. Note: Of course, it goes without saying.” (Women, A
Berkshire Feminist News Journal, Dec. '74)

Behead Him In An Hour and It's Legal — A Katmandu, Nepal woman
beheaded her 36-year-old son who had raped her. She was acquitted
because the Katmandu Supreme Court recognizes the right of a woman
to kill her rapist, provided she does it within an hour of the rape. (Now
there's one enlightened statute.)

High Price for Heteros — The Food and Drug Administration recently
reported that IUDs are less likely to kill you than birth control pills. The
IUD death rate is only between 1-10 deaths per million while the death
rate for the pill is 22-45 per million. Wonderful... Naturally if men had
to suffer pills and IUDs these things would probably be so well
perfected they would make men healthier.

Luckily It's not Difficult — Charlotte Whitton, a former mayor of Ot-
tawa, Canada, once told a group of women that “Whatever women do
they must do twice as well as men to be considered half as good. Lucki-
ly, it’s not difficult.” (San Francisco Chronicle)

Pour the Sake and Smile — After meeting with top men from many
countries, Prez E. Dent Jerry Buick (oops, I meant Ford of course), then
went to have his first Japanese style meal of the trip. A chalk-faced
geisha girl, clad in a pastel kimono with glittering pins and yarn

Looks like the geishas need some instructions on just where to pour the
sake and on how to put their matches to better use.
