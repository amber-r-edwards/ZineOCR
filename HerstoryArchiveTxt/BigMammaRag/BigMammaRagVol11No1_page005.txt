Psych Exam

The acquittal of two out of
the three men accused of gang
raping a woman has caused a
great outcry from the women
in France. Because the woman
who was raped refused to undergo a
psychiatric evaluation, her
case had been reclassified as one
of grievous bodily harm, for
which the men served 6 months.
Then the reclassification was
declared invalid. The refusal
of a psychiatric examination,
which is demanded only in
rape cases, became a major issue
in the trial. Following
the acquittal, protests were
launched to protest this regression
on women's rights in France.

Acceptable Death

Baton Rouge, LA
after an alarming
increase in miscarriages and
stillbirths among the wives of
workers at Exxon's oil refinery
waste-water plant. Exxon
claims that all chemical exposures
in that part of the plant are within
"acceptable levels." Miscarriages and
stillbirths jumped as much as
16% after their husbands became
employed at the facility.
The company says it will
continue to monitor the families.

“Patriarchal Love"?

Michael Morgenstern, who
once wrote a book called How
To Make Love To A Woman, will
soon stand trial on charges
of punching out his girlfriend
upon finding her in an apartment
with another man. In his
book Morgenstern urges men to
show "sensitivity" to women
when making love. He faces up
to a year in jail if convicted.

Woo Reinstated

A ruling by the Public Employment
Relations Board in California
called for a reversal in the
Univ. of CA policy of terminating
lecturers after four years. The
ruling calls for the reinstatement
of Merle Woo and any other lecturers
fired under the four year rule
with back pay, within 45 days.
Merle Woo, a socialist lesbian
feminist teaching in Asian American
studies at UC in Berkeley, stated
"That four year rule meant the
firing of thousands of lecturers,
most of us women and people of color.
It was being used to discourage
unionizing and to fire those with
whom the University disagrees."

No Shelter Here

Advocating Change Together, Inc.
filed complaints in October on
behalf of four handicapped workers
employed by Opportunity Workshop in
Minnesota. Federal law allows sheltered
workshops to pay less than minimum wage
to handicapped workers who supposedly
cannot produce at a competitive rate.
The wages of the four workers filing suit
range from $1.01 to $1.18 hourly,
which represents the reality of those
employed in sheltered workshops across the
nation. Of 524 workshops investigated
by the Dept. of Labor, 11,482 handicapped
workers had been underpaid about $2.7
million.

Radioactive Safety?

Thousands of gallons of radioactive
water leaked into a canal, and then to
the Gulf of Mexico, from the Florida
Power Corp.'s nuclear plant.

A company spokesman states,
"We are allowed to periodically
discharge contaminated water into
the canal, but concede that the
radioactive content of the water
was slightly higher than it should
have been...But there was no
environmental, public or plant
danger. It's a matter of not
discharging the water during
a long enough time period."

We say Bullshit!

God's What?!?!

God must love nuclear power
plants because he made so
many of them. That's the apparent
reasoning of a Long Island
Lighting Co. pamphlet sent out to
3,000 people in the New York area
the company serves. Carrying reprints
from religious magazines, the pamphlet
notes that the sun and stars are
nuclear power plants and says,
“It is a sobering thought that God
has made more nuclear power plants
than anything else."

Directory Censors

All abortion clinics in Sydney,
Australia were informed by phone
that the words “abortion" and
“termination of pregnancy" would
no longer be permitted under the
family planning listings in Sydney's
Yellow Pages--to be listed only
under "the pregnancy counseling"
section. All clinics were told to
decide on the phone, whether they
would withdraw the listing they had
already paid for or agree to
the limited listing.

Smash Apartheid!

South African soldiers swept through
the Lesotho, Maseru capital against
little resistance before dawn Dec. 9,
killing at least 37 people, including
women and children. It was South Africa's
deadliest cross-border raid against
black revolutionaries of the African
National Congress.

The African National Congress fights
to overthrow the white-minority government
in South Africa. The ANC called the raid
a cold-blooded massacre. Residents said
the raiders attacked several houses
believed used by the African National
Congress, as well as six South African
refugee hostels in business districts,
wealthy suburbs and poor villages in the
area of the capital city. The soldiers
took over the city for over one hour,
killing people in their beds and in the
streets. Down with South Africa--Up with

Internment Politics

In January, Minoru Yasui--survivor of
the Japanese-American Concentration Camps
and now head of Denver's Community
Relations Commission, and two other
plaintiffs will ask for nullification
of three World War II era U.S. Supreme
Court laws that upheld the restriction,
evacuation and internment of Japanese-Americans.
The present rulings of the US Supreme Court
say that in times of emergency, federal
authorities may distinguish between citizens
on the basis of ancestry. For the past two
years, a bill requesting $25,000 for each
person imprisoned has been introduced in
Congress, with no success. The US government
made a token payment of $38 million for
losses estimated at over $400 million.
Japanese-Americans were interned in 10 camps
in seven states for allegedly threatening
national security.
