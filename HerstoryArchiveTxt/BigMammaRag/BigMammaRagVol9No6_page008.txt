Falwell Fallout Strikes Feminist Book

The Reverend Jerry Falwell
and his Moral Majority have
been busy recently in their
attempts to "stitch up the
torn moral fiber in this
country." Perhaps their best

known campaign is the Coali-
tion for Better Television,

in which 4,000 Lord volunteers
are watching every second of
prime-time television origin-
ating from the three commerci-
al networks, on the lookout
for sex and profanity. The
Coalition is threatening to
boycott sponsors of “obscene"
programs, and the tactic is
working. Many companies,
including Revlon, American
Motors, and Carnation, have
yielded to the Coalition, re-
fusing to advertise on certain
programs. Others have joined
the networks in their stand

against the Coalition, claim-
ing the threatened boycott to
be a direct violation of the

First Amendment guaranteeing

freedom of speech.

The networks, of course,
have free access to their own
programming to make noise
about the censorship tactics
of the Moral Majority, and
the possible loss of revenues
that a boycott would mean.
There is, however, another
search-and-destroy mission
currently being waged by Fal-
well and his squadron of
Christian soldiers that has

not gained very much attention.

The latest target is the fem-
inist health book Our Bodies,
Ourselves, and the battle is
being waged in small (and
sometimes large) community
schools and libraries over
whether or not the book should
be removed from the shelves

on the basis that its contents
are "immoral trash."

The following is the envelope containing the Moral Majority

newsletter of January 1,

and some excerpts from the content

of that newsletter, which claims to have actual excerpts

from Our Bodies, Ourselves.
Note,

Notice that Falwell has crossed
out "offensive" and references to orgasms,
too, what he finds to be morally outrageous.

Section entitled SEX WITH OURSELVES- MASTURBATION-

"It's exciting to make up sexual fantasies while
masturbating or to masturbate when we feel those

fantasies coming on. Some of us find
something

Some of us like to insert
our or other parts of
our bodies erotically sensitive and rub them be-

fore or while

Enjoying ourselves doesn't just mean our

. We are learning
to enjoy all parts of our bodies."

"Not until we have an economic-social system that

puts people before profit will everyone be able

to participate."

Although this book is available at various places, we ob-

ject to our tax dollars being

used to provide this explic-

it immoral information in our libraries and our schools.

We are still “one nation under God."

Falwell began his campaign
against Our Bodies, Ourselves
in January 1981 with a mailing

to over a million people asking
for money to help fight against 

“offensive sex education mat-
erials." In the newsletter, he

states, "Your gift of $10, $15;

or even $25 will help us re-
move books from public schools
like Our Bodies, Ourselves."

In the mailing, he urges every-

one to examine school and pub-
lic libraries for "immoral,
anti-family and anti-American
content" and to notify the
Moral Majority if any is
found. "Do you want your child
to choose his values free from
your influence and free from
any standard of right or
wrong based on issues like
premarital sex, extramarital
sex, homosexuality, lesbian-
ism and bisexuality?" he asks
his constituency. The Falwell
mailing has produced an "over-
whelming" response (to the
tune of millions of dollars),
according to a Moral Majority
official, and already a fight
is underway in Spencer, Mass.
to remove the book from use

in a high school sex-education
course. And the Boston Women's
Health Book Collective, the
producer of Our Bodies, Our-
selves, say “already we know
about dozens" of new attempts
to censor the book.

Censorship of Our Bodies,
Ourselves is nothing new to
the Boston Women's Health
Book Collective. They have
been a long-time target of
Phyllis Schlafly's group, the
Eagle Forum, which initiated
temporarily successful drives
to ban the book in high school
libraries earlier in the
1970s. For three years the
collective has been offering
assistance to teenagers, par-
ents and community groups
who are fighting attempts to
censor Our Bodies, Ourselves.
They have compiled support-
ive reviews, articles, and
letters from educators, par-
ents and physicians, and
other health care providers.
The collective states, "We
view the attack on Our Bodies,
Ourselves as part of the
larger attack on women's
rights in general, most not-
ably in the form of anti-ERA,
anti-childcare, anti-homosex-
ual, and anti-abortion activ-
ity. Though this activity may
represent the viewpoint of a
small minority, it has been
well financed, has had an

alarming influence on policy
makers, and represents a
major challenge to the
women's movement in this
country."

Along with the general
Right-wing attack on women's
rights, the collective cites
the book's increased visibil-
ity as part of the backlash
explanation. Indeed, what
started out as a one-day dis-
cussion group on health at
a women's conference in 1969,
the Our Bodies, Ourselves 11-
woman collective grew from
a series of meetings on dif-
ferent health topics to writ-
ing a women's health and sex
education book. First publish-
ed in 1970 by the New England
Free Press and now published
by Simon and Schuster, Our
Bodies, Ourselves has sold
more than two million copies
in English and 11 other lang-
uages with more translations
on the way.

That Our Bodies, Ourselves
is a readily-available "porn-
ographic sex manual," as the
Moral Majority would have
parents believe, does not
totally explain the reason
Falwell has singled out this
particular health book. Many
women who would not consider
themselves "feminists" have
read the book, and as a re-
sult, have begun to look more
critically at the health care
they receive, at society's
attitudes towards sexuality,
and at the way society ex-
pects parents to parent.

They have used the book to
make changes, which is what

the collective, 10 years
ago, had hoped the effect of
the book would be. Our Bodies
Ourselves does much more
