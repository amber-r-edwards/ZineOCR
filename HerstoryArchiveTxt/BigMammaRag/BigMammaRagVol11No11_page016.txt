“We Are Fighting For The Liberation Of The Most

(The following is excerpted
from an interview with Uma,
a New Zealander of Indian
descent, conducted by Con-
nexions in August 1983)

My grandparents were
brought from Rajasthan in
northern India by the Chel-

sexuality

sea Sugar Refinery and the
British Commonwealth govern-
ment as indentured laborers
for the sugar cane planta-
tions of Fiji. The goal was
to create a concentrated
population that they could
keep in a slave-like way.

My parents were both born
there and so was I. When I
was two we moved to Aotearoa
New Zealand. (Aotearoa
is the Maori’s own name for
their land.) And as I am
committed to Maori sover-
eignty, I call that country
by their name. I grew up in
a situation of domestic
violence within a working
class environment. We were
also isolated and alienated
due to such things as lan-
guage and cultural differ-
ences.

So, my first awareness of
oppression was that of the
racism directed toward us.
In retrospect, I realize I
wasn't aware of the further
oppressed, of the Maori in
their own land, nor my role
of possible oppressor of in-
digenous peoples. I was a-
ware of gender oppression,
but it was more like some-
thing that was unjust and
unfair to me personally and
to other women rather than
the clear-cut oppression of
racism.

I was always the family
eccentric, for I spoke out
about injustice, particu-
larly directed toward wo-
men, and I said that under
such circumstances I wasn't
going to marry. My family,
of course, wanted to marry
me off. It didn't help that
my mother is a matchmaker
in the community. (She came
from a long line of match-
makers.) When I traveled
through India, if I ever
said to any other Indians
there, "No, I don't wish
ever to get married," it
was like I might be saying
that I wasn't going to grow
old. It's seen as an inevi-
table part of life. And
people looked at me and
thought, "Oh, she says she
won't marry, but what she
means is no one will marry
her." Part of the reason
marriage seems inevitable
is because there are no
other alternatives, because

as a woman you often can't

get a job, nor live on your
own, etc.

By the time I was in my
early 20s I knew it was time
I moved, as my biculturalism
and my growing political
awareness had become an ex-
plosive need for "personal
growth." I fled to Australia
and lived in Sydney for about
a year. Eventually, I also
went to western Australia,
where I lived, worked and
studied at a university for
five years. I did a double
major and completed my B.A.
degree in both Communication
Studies and World Literature.

In the 60's, when you had
the Civil Rights Movement
here and Black liberation,
that's when all the stuff
in my head about racism was
finally articulated. I had
words for it, and I could
call myself Black and be
proud of it, instead of the
wishy-washy “brown."

At the university in 1975,
I discovered more about sex-
ual discrimination, and felt
myself validated at last
about this form of oppres-
sion. It was so exciting! It
meant I could read and find

sexuality." However, the way
most of the lesbians around
the women's liberation move-
ment and the gay liberation
movement, as well as in the
feminist and gay sub-culture,
define themselves and live
out their lives has been the
most difficult aspect for me
to try and reconcile myself
to. Now, I usually don't
bother. I refuse to identify
myself in the racist and
middle class Anglo way that
they do. They so often pursue
their social lives in ways
that I feel at times are so
limited and limiting that
I'm quite often unchallenged,
unstimulated and definitely
bored. But I'll explain this
a little later on, O.K.?

I think my sexuality came
more through my politics
than anything else. And, of
course, because I am a pol-
itical person, I made my
sexuality a political act
and came out as publicly
as possible. At the time,
this meant I became in-
volved in the opening of the
Sixth National Conference
of Lesbians and Homosexuals
in Australia, which took

out what women around the
world were writing--that
women who were fighting
against sexism call them-
selves "feminist." I then
became a "Black feminist."
I returned to Aotearoa
New Zealand and underwent
a year of intense self-
examination--the meaning of
my life, my past and my
future. I recognized that I
had no desire to relate in
any way with men. The label
given to women who relate
only to women is "lesbian."
My first thought was, "Oh
no, not another oppressed
group."

As an Indian woman I have
always had access to women
and to a certain degree
their bodies, so it's been
an easy transition for me
to go from affectionate

"sensuality" to lusty "sex-

place in 1980. And more
recently I came out on na-
tional television. I was
discussing the activities
of several groups at Liver-
pool Women's Health Center,
where I was working at the
time, including the lesbian
group. Mind you, I think the
fact that I was wearing a
red sari and had a lesbian
symbol painted on my fore-
head might have tipped peo-
ple off.

So that's where my sexual-
ity came from. And that's
when I became a lesbian.

At that stage, for very per-
sonal family reasons, I
couldn't remain in Aotearoa
New Zealand. I hadn't
really come out to my family
at that time. My mother
found out the night before

I left to come on this trip;
it was really painful, and
yet funny too at times. I'll

tell you some of the things
I thought were quite parti-
cular to Indians. One of

the first things she said
was, "What did I do wrong
in my last life?" and "Don't
you dare blame me for this."
When she went through all
this rejection of me, I kept
saying: "Never mind, you're
still my mother and I love
you." But most of it was
really heavy and painful.

I have been a full-time
activist within the women's
liberation movement and the
gay liberation movement for
about three years now. That
means I've been in about
20 different collectives.
And quite often, of course,
I've been the only non-Anglo
or identified non-Anglo.
Often, within the women's
liberation movement, I'm
there as a lesbian of color;
in the gay movement, I'm us-
ually there as a feminist
of color. In other words,
I'm always representing o-
ther oppressed groups that I
represent within myself.

In one of the groups I
belonged to, the Black,
migrant and Third World
Women's Alliance, there were
about 50 of us at one stage,
and we spoke approximately
30 different languages be-
tween us. And that included
women who were first gener-
ation (either who had lived
in Australia for many years
or were recent migrants), as
well as second, third, or
fourth generation of Italian,
Greek, Lebanese, etc. back-
grounds. Even if there were
two women from the same cul-
tural background, their class
and where they came from
could be quite different--
so we included all those
inter-differences too. Ob-
viously there were disagree-
ments, like there are in any
collective, and lots of dif-
ferent ways of looking at
issues, but for me, the mir-
acle was the fact that we
actually had things we
could come together on--the
similarities we had experi-
enced rather than the dif-
ferences.

It seems to me that one of
the things that appears to
be of prime importance with-
in the women's liberation
and the gay liberation move-
ments in Australia is to
create social/cultural sit-
uations. In other words, a
lesbian culture, or a wom-
en's culture, women's music,
dance and stuff like that.
Well, I think all that may

im-

be a result of the patriar-
chy and how it operates in
your cultures--you don't
