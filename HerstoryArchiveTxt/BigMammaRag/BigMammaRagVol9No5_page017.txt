fired with the store. Marshall
Fields really destroyed her
in many ways. She was a very
hard worker and I'm sure she
gave them everything she
could possibly give them and
what they gave her was min-
imum wage and she was called
girl. She never called her-
self one of the girls, she
wasn't frivolous or trying
to be young or coy. I think
she cringed when she was cal-
led that and I think she
thought it was inappropriate.
I know she was called Fannie,
her first name, and her boss
was always called Mr. I rem-
ember Mr. Gallagher and I
hated him because my grand-
mother acted scared of him
and she showed him so much
respect and I thought he was
a jerk.

She would always be scared
that I would come into the
store in some ratty blue
jeans or with hippy friends
and that Mr. Gallagher would
come down on her about it.
She had no illusions about
the power that that young
punk manager had over her.
Marshall Fields hired pretty
and young high school women
to work after school and I
know that they were paid at
least the same if not bet-
ter than my grandmother, and
they were treated in some
ways more respectfully. For
one thing, they weren't af-
raid of the bosses, they
weren't crouched over, scur-

bosses, they weren't really
dependent on the job. If they
broke a plate, they broke a
plate, my grandmother prob-
ably cried herself to sleep
at night if she broke any-
thing. She had that job until
she was forcibly retired and
that was probably one of the
most traumatic things in her
life. She became senile not
too soon afterwards, it was
a slow gradual process but I
know that it emotionally de-
stroyed her.

As I was growing up I saw
quite a lot of her and was
close to her. She gave me an
awful lot of love, just end-
less, constant amounts of
love no matter what I did or
what was going on--she loved
me. The only thing I ever re-
member her refusing to do
for me was to sew me a dress
from scratch. She would do
mending, hemming, something I
might have started but
didn't finish but she
wouldn't make me a dress.
She did it once and said she
was never going to do it
again. She just couldn't do
it after doing it for a
living so many times.

I think that her main
strength as a human being
was how much she could love
people. I have never seen
anybody just give out that
much love.

Other oral histories will
be in next month's paper.

policy on the openly ra-

was spelled out in a 1972
pamphlet titled "Corporate

argued that "a pullout of
companies such as SKF

How?) These exploitative

blurred vision, or confused
thinking and speech. They
can also be addictive.
People often develop
term psychological and
physical dependencies, or addic-
tions, on phenothiazines.
Frequently, psychiatrists
have told their patients that
they must take the drug for
the rest of their lives. (A
few members of ON OUR OWN
have been told this.) As a
result, many people have
been conditioned to believe
that if they stop taking the
drug, they'll “go crazy" and
end up back in the hospital.
Anyone who suddenly stops
taking the drug(s) may find
himself or herself experi-
encing frightening with-
drawal reactions; these may
further convince the person
that he or she is indeed
"psychotic" and must remain
on drugs.
