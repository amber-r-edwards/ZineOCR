Lesbianism --
No Solution

from page 5

times when I hear the "para-
noid" line, I also hear the
assumption that "we're all
the same" is right behind it.
For the Latina/Chicana/Hispan-
ic, Indian and Asian womyn
who always hear the term
"womyn of color" defined as
“black and other..." or who
hear racism reduced to a
"black and white" issue; for
the womyn of color who are
endlessly referred to as "min-
orities" (a term I find off-
ensive personally); for the
dark lesbians who are labeled
"strong" and "butch" and who
are lusted after by some
white womyn exclusively; we
know we're not the same.

Womyn of color are differ-
ent from each other -- but in
one way we are the same. Out
of the "right" context, we
are all invisible.

on racism for its volunteers.
be done: as soon as possible.

The Milwaukee feminist community must
direct its efforts to making the fight
against racism a top priority. Feminism
is a philosophy aimed at equality of
the sexes, and at fighting for women's
rights. It is not meant to exclude
certain groups; it is meant to include
everyone. Let us measure up to this and
let our lives reflect our belief in
this goal.

Whitewashing racism does not elimi-
nate it. Whitewashing encourages its
growth and Common Ground has been
guilty of this by refusing to provide
a woman of color the opportunity to
speak for herself on the issue of
racism - who better knows the effects
of racism than people of color? Common
Ground staff members were guilty of
whitewashing by covering up the depth
of racism on the grounds that the sub-
ject is "divisive." These stances
merely reinforce racism.

Common Ground's racist actions are
by no means isolated. Similar acts are
prevalent throughout the women's comm-
unity.

The time is long overdue for white
women to begin and maintain an on-going
effort to eliminate racism within the
women's community and to include women
of color in their organizations and
activities.

Jewish Mother from page 13

differently: women were expected to be the
practical partners, so "practical" was
defined as inferior to intellectual.
Neither am I claiming that in "the old
country," Jewish women were usually the
primary wage earners. The husband/
scholar was the ideal which few fami-
lies could attain in practice. But even
“unattainable societal ideals have a
powerful influence on people's feelings
about themselves and others.

When Jews immigrated to this country,
this family ideal of the strong practi-
cal wife and the scholarly, impractical
husband clashed with the American fam-
ily ideal of the strong practical hus-
band and the dependent ineffectual wife.
Attempts by Jews to assimilate into
this American culture brought ridicule
and contempt to the strong, lusty,
practical Jewish women, now the hated
JEWISH MOTHER.

‘The Jewish Mother is traditionally a
dependent guilt-tripper (although guilt
seems to me to be far more pervasive in
many Christian sects than it is in Jud-
aism). The anti-stereotype for the
guilt-tripper is the wise old woman,
the earth mother - Ma Goldberg to those
who, like me, were addicted to day-time
radio serials in the 30's and 40's.

As women, we are taught self-hatred
early. Young women, most of whom will
grow up to be old women, learn early in
their lives to use these stereotypes
against old women. They learn to deride
our wisdom, ridicule our sexuality, and
fear our strength. Most of all, young
women learn to fear their own aging
processes, their admission into the
dread category: old woman.

We Jewish women get plenty of encour-
agement to add to our self-hatred from
the long list of anti-Jewish attitudes:
controlling ("too” strong), smothering
("too" nurturing), emasculating ("too"

the mother is merely refusing to take
care of her "baby" at her own expense.
"You used the dishes, you wash them" is
not a guilt-trip.

Young Jewish women can be confused
into interpreting the struggle to grow
up in American society which puts women
in a growth-warping family role as a
struggle against a controlling, smother-
ing JEWISH MOTHER.

I often feel pressured to "choose my
oppression." Some people seem to be
saying to me: "Sexism, ageism, and anti-
semitism are three different problems.
Now, who do you identify with - women,
older people, or Jews? If you choose
'my' group, then you are with 'us,'
but if you choose to fight an oppression
I don't share, then you are not helping
me fight mine."

I recognize that bigotry can be ex-
pressed in many different ways, with
different intensity, pervasiveness,
overtness or subtlety, and with differ-
ent stereotypes chosen, different privi-
leges denied. But it is all the same in
being oppressive to ME, to my identity
as a person. I feel that oppressions do
more than just add up in their impact
on a person; each one increases the
pain which the others inflict because
each separates me from more of my poten-
tial allies. So I refuse to “choose.”

I see now that I get my strength from
being a woman, from being Jewish, and
from being older. I now identify myself
as Jewish to myself and to others, and
enjoy what I have in common with other
Jews (despite the danger of being called
"clannish"). I am now able to develop
my Jewish mother identity, proclaim it,
and use its strength because I recognize
and, despite my fears, fight against the
forces in society which would like to
debase it: sexism, anti-semitism, and
ageism. I now proclaim proudly - even

sexual), guilt-tripping. "Guilt-tripping" loudly, angrily, and pushily - that I

AM A JEWISH MOTHER.
