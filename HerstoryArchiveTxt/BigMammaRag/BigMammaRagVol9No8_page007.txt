Belted

"Ladies! Interested in a
little bondage, humiliation
and degradation? This after-
noon go shopping at Eaton's."
That was the message a couple
of displays in Eaton's large
department store in downtown
Vancouver BC appeared to be
giving female shoppers. Fem-
inists quickly protested. A
belt display had three belts
in a strangulation motif
around a female mannequin's
neck, waist and feet. Another
display in the sports depart-
ment showed a doctor standing
between the legs of a female
dummy and directing an elec-
tric drill into her stomach.

Save the Whale

Diana Souhami writes in
Spare Rib: "Remember the Tory
election posters of a long
dole queue with the caption
'Labour Isn't Working'? Well
now close to three million
people aren't working. 'The
creation of wealth is a Chris-
tian obligation," says Marga-
ret Thatcher from the pulpit,
her eyes, as ever, on the hard
side.

Much has been made of the fact
that Thatcher is a woman. Yet
many women who want a better
world feel no more identifica-
tion with her than the blue
whale. Less of course. Let's
save the whale."

It's About Time

Canadian postal workers are
on strike for 20 weeks paid
maternity leave for mothers,
five days leave on a child's
birth for fathers and five
days paid leave for parents
adopting a child. "It's taken
a long time for the labour
movement to recognize this as
a really important issue,"
said Canadian Union of Postal
Workers member Marion Pollock.

Lowly Dictionary

Many studies have put a
dollar value on the work of
the American homemaker/mother,
averaging out at $40,000 a
year. Here's another view:

The Dictionary of Occupational
Titles, published by the Dep-
artment of Labor, rates jobs
according to their skill lev-
el from 1 (top) to 887 (bot-
tom). Homemakers, foster moth-
ers, child care workers, and
nursery school teachers all
share the same skill rating:
878. No comment.

Sexism On Wheels

The movie "Breaking Away"
popularized the Little 500,
a bicycle race long popular
at Indiana University. Last
year, the Little 500, billed
as the "world's greatest col-
lege weekend," drew over
25,000 to see the all-male
cyclists race. Women, too,
participated in the event,
but not in quite the same
way... they were permitted to
ride in a tricycle race the
day before the main event.

“Force” Okay

A recent study by the Na-
tional Center for the Preven-
tion and Control of Rape ask-
ed teenagers whether or not
sexual "cues or come ons"
were viewed as acceptable
reasons for the use of forced
sex. Surprising results were
tabulated. 54% of a group of
teenage boys felt that forc-
ing a girl to have sex is OK
under certain circumstances.
The surprising part is that
42% of a similar group of
girls agreed.

Rags to Riches?

According to the government
in India, domestic workers
should not only consider them-
selves lucky, they should con-
sider themselves rich. Whereas
the poverty line (according
to the government) is Rs 20
($3.13) in rural areas, and Rs
30 ($4.70) in town, domestic
workers make an average of Rs
60 ($9.40) per month. Howev-
er, 2000 domestic workers in
one town didn't agree and went
on strike until many of their
employers agreed to demands of
increased wages, two holidays
a month, either an extra
month's pay or a new sari ev-
ery year, and medical leave.

Runaway Stopped

240 women and 3 men took
over the Lee jeans factory in
Greenock, West Scotland when
they heard they were to lose
their jobs. (As far as we know
they are still in control of
the factory and its stock).
One of the women who started
at the factory when it opened
says the recession is so bad
in Greenock that 3/4 of the
workers in the factory are
the only earners in their fam-
ilies, often supporting par-
ents who are unemployed. The
owners want to move the fact-
ory to Ireland to exploit the
tax advantages there (and the
workers too!).

Lesbiangry

A New York Housing Court
Judge has ruled that two les-
bians do not make up a family
unit and ordered their evic-
tion from their NYC apartment.
The landlord evicted the women
on the basis that one of them
did not have her name on the
lease. The named tenant had
lived in the apartment since
1973; her lover, since 1979.
The women had charged discrim-
ination on the basis of mari-
tal status.

Sporting News

The Women Against Violence
in Pornography and Media
Newspage reports that media
violence against women has
sunk to new lows. A recent
Penthouse article described
a new sport called "tossing,"
in which "you date a chick,
fuck her in your car, and
toss her out. Literally." And
on Rod Stewart's new album,
he sings about planning to
kill his wife, either by
shooting or strangling her.

Sterilizing Decision

Several years ago, women
working at the American Cyan-
amid Co. in Willow Island,
W.V., faced a difficult choice:
because of the link between
lead exposure and birth de-
fects, the company ordered
that all women aged 16-50
either leave their jobs in
the lead department or be
sterilized. Five women were
forced to choose sterilization
and responding to a complaint
by the Oil, Chemical and Atom-
ic Workers union, OSHA cited
American Cyanamid in 1979 for
violating safety regulations.
However, with OSHA becoming
more pro-industry under the
Reagan administration, the
citation against American Cy-
anamid was just dismissed.
The OSHA Review Committee
ruled, "An employee's decision
to undergo sterilization in
order to gain or retain employ-
ment grows out of economic
and social factors which op-
erate primarily outside the
workplace," clearly stating
a blame-the-victim approach
to occupational disease.

Marital Rape

The number of states in
which a spouse can be charged
with rape of the other spouse
is small, but growing. Two
recent decisions in New Jersey
and Massachusetts have added
to the legislative recognition
that forced sexual intercourse
is rape whether it takes place
within or outside marriage.
Such legislation is pending
in the following states: Mary-
land, New Hampshire, New York,
Oklahoma and Pennsylvania.
