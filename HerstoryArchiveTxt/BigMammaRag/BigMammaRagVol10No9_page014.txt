Grand Jury

The obvious assault against
women must be directly con-
fronted by women. Grand Jury
activity has been used against
the women's community in the
past. In early 1975 grand ju-
ries were convened in Lexing-
ton, Ken. and Hartford, Conn.
ostensibly for the purpose of
investigating connections be-
tween two fugitives wanted in
connection with the 1970 "rob-
bery" of a Boston Bank, Susan
Saxe and Katherine Powers,
and various women's communi-
ties. These grand juries fo-
cused on Susan Saxe's lesbian-
ism as a pretext for interro-
gating a wide range of femi-
nist and lesbian groups in
the area and basically con-
ducting a "fishing expedition"
aimed at the women's movement.
Six activists from the lesbian
and gay liberation movement
refused to cooperate and were
jailed in Lexington. Two wo-
men, feminist activists, were
jailed in connection with the
Hartford Grand Jury. The

Lisa and Kristie Vogel, I
pity your ignorance. I resent
your misuse of power and
I hold you responsible for
feeding the destruction of
the hopes and dreams of all

of us. Bigger is not always
better. :

(Collective note: We know
that if we are young, white,
middle class, mellow and heal-
thy (in every and all recogn-
izable respects) we will have
a much easier life. That ment-
ality has been, is being re-
flected in our festivals and
conferences.

Other movements are making
connections between anti-
psychiatric work and differ-
ently-abled people. Profes-
sionals have created the myth
that "they" are different and
must be treated differently
and only the chosen few know
how to spot, label, treat and
help "those people". If we go
along with the line we further
the practice of forced drug-
ging of psychiatric patients
and people graded as retard-
ed. When someone pulls out
the psychiatric labels on us,
i.e. word salad, psychotic
break - it's garbage - it's
institutional language that
the pros use to set them-
selves up over us and if we

attack on women's and lesbian
communities across the coun-
try. They are currently very
active and vocal supporters
of the grand jury resistors
jailed in connection with the
RICO grand jury.

The government will continue
to persistently pursue people
involved in, and supporters of
Third World/National Liberation
Movements. Their track record
shows that they will flagrant-
ly violate the civil and hum-
an rights of these people. A
most recent example is the
brutal treatment which the
Nyack defendants, especially
the Black combatants, are re-
ceiving. Sekou Odinga, a mem-
ber of the Panther 21 and und-
erground for 13 years, was sev-
erely beaten after his arrest
and maintained on hospital
machines. Solomon Brown's neck
was broken while incarcerated,

go along with them we are
collaborating with the sys-
tem, oppressing others and
ourselves as well. If we
drag a woman off an area she
chose to be on or physically
isolates a woman in an area
she chooses not to be in,
then we are wardens and
guards as surely as if we
wore the uniforms of those
jobs.

To insure us of a perfect
time we could have cultural
areas (ghettos) and segregate
white women from Brown, Black,
Red, Jewish and Asian women.

The next step of course is
to identify women over 50 and
relegate them to Senior Cit-
izen areas and control our
behavior, maybe have a Les-
bian shrink watching matern-
ally over us.

It would be a good idea too
to have half-way tents for
those women we aren't "quite
sure" of and watch their be-
havior and if they don't
quite measure up we could take
them to the Womb and have pro-
nouncements made by those
women in charge as to how fit
they are.

For us, the collective, to
have women's space for fun,
freedom and a trouble-free
time is the myth. The reality
is that we exist in a world
that never has guaranteed a
good life for women or people
of color. And you don't leave

he was denied medical treat-
ment. Jan 7, '82 the conditions
of confinement of Kathy Boudin
were ruled unconstitutional
and discriminatory. She was
held in an isolation cell for
all but 14 hours a day, denied
her prescription eyeglasses
and prevented from having con-
tact with her 14-month-old
child. As these conditions
were held unconstitutional

she was sent to a different
jail where she is kept with
three other Brink's combat-
ants, isolated from the rest
of the prison population.

The Nyack incident involved
members of the Black Liber-
ation Army: Solomon Brown,
Sekou Odinga, Kuwasi Balagoon;
and White Anti-Imperialist
Forces: Kathy Boudin, Judy
Clark, and David Gilbert. Or-
ganized as the Revolutionary
Armed Task Force under the
leadership of the BLA, the
armed action was an attempted
expropriation of the funds
from a Brink's armored car.

It is imperative that prog-

the world when you go to
a women's music festival, the
racism, classism, anti-Semit-
ism, capitalism, segregation
of differently-abled and pro-
Psychiatric practices have all
followed us onto the land
because we brought them with
us.

To all women who can go to
festivals and conferences, we
really hope everyone has a
memorable time but only we can
guarantee that. We must make
sure that the continued treat-
ment of the stage as a holy
place is stopped, that we view
the mic as an important means
of communication, open to all
regardless of scheduled events.
If that form of communication
is shut off from us then we
must realize that in fact we
are on dictatorial land.

To put differently-abled
women in segregated areas that
are inaccessible, understaffed
and inadequate is not giving
a silent message, the message
comes through loud and clear-
YOU ARE NOT WANTED, YOU ARE
NOT ONE OF US.

We all carry our politics
with us, no matter what we say
it really is what we do. Maybe
if we tried to be more consc-
ious and take more responsib-
ility for our actions more
women can feel safer at our
functions. We all have polit-
ics, living in our head, out

gressive people continue to

be critical of and organize
against the government for
punishing people for political
associations and beliefs. The
grand jury resisters are com-
mitted people. They know that
talking to the grand jury
would violate their own prin-
ciples, jeopardize their pol-
itical movements, and jeopar-
dize the security of armed
clandestine movements from the
Black, Puerto Rican, and
Chicano/Mexicano communities.
Our support for them is cruc-
ial, it must begin now and
continue. Contact:

We directly ask the organ-

for an account of their be-
havior to Carmen and Connie

commodate women who are dif-
ferently-abled next year in

behavior from happening

We have directed much of our
anger at the people who
filled these functions rather
than at the functions them-
selves. In the outside world
it would have been men who
dragged Carmen off; at Michi-

sults for Carmen were the
same. When women just separ-
ate themselves from men, with-
out changing the values from
those that form the basis of
society, we will find women
filling all the oppressive
roles that we have reviled
men for.
