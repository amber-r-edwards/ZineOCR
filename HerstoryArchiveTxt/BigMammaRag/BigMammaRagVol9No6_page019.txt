Our Bodies, Ourselves  

than provide women with pre-  
viously "hidden" information  
that helps us to take better  
care of ourselves and to be  
more in control of our lives.  
The political framework from  
which the collective operates  
is obvious in the contents of  
Our Bodies, Ourselves. Judy  
Norsigian and Wendy Sanford,  
speaking for the Boston  
Women's Health Book Collec-  
tive, said, "We seek the  
empowerment of women to con-  
trol our bodies, especially  
our reproduction, seeing this  
empowerment as a fundamental  
means to control our lives  
and participate in the world.  
Of the different groups work-  
ing for change in women's  
position in this country, we  
find ourselves less comfort-  
able with those who assert  
women's right to move into  
the society's corporate  
structure and power elites as  
the primary expression of  
feminist goals. Instead, we  
are among the women who want  
to let our long-time experi-  
ence of being the ones with-

out power shape a vision that  
challenges the existing power  
structures themselves. In-  
stead of our own piece of the  
pie, in other words, we want  
to change the recipe. Running  
through our work on health  
and parenting issues is a  
wider vision of social change  
a dream of eliminating the  
exploitation and suffering  
that result from racism, sex-  
ism, classism, and oppressive  
economic and political sys-  
tems."

Falwell's "shock and dis-  
gust" upon discovering Our  
Bodies, Ourselves comes not  
from the book's chapters on  
venereal disease, sexuality  
and reproduction, or even  
the chapter on lesbianism,  
by themselves; his alarm is  
that the book is not just  
another sex education manual,  
but one that demonstrates  
how oppressive economic and  
political systems deny women  
control of our bodies. He  
has received millions in his  
effort to suppress this book,  
and to keep other campaigns
