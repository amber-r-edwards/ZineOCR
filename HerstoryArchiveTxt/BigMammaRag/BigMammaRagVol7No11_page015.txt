Soaps, Sighs & Domestic Dependencies

Judy Barlow

There were certain times of the day
that my grandmother did not answer
the phone. My brothers and I learned
early that we were not to bother her
on weekday afternoons. She had a
standing date with her friends - her
friends from soap operas. When “her
stories" were over, the phone started
ringing immediately - Mrs. Mazzini
calling to tell about the latest de-
velopments in the plot, to condone
or condemn one character or another.
At about 3:30, my grandmother was her
warm, loving self again ready to

greet us and give us cookies and milk.

Christmas, Thanksgiving, birthdays.
Family dinner, food, talk, dessert,
coffee, dishes. The way she looked
toward the television at one o'clock.
Knowing her friends were there, yet
she couldn't see them. Not today.
Three o'clock. She rushes to the
phone. It's Mrs. Mazzini. Did Rachel
really do that? You know she's really
just a tramp, a bad person. What did
her husband do? He surely could have
done better - he's such a fine man
and handsome too."

Her speech is interspersed with
both Italian and English words. She
can't speak English well enough to
get the words out quickly. The emo-
tion pours from her lips as she
clenches her fists. Tears run from
her eyes.

Then, she hangs up the phone, goes
to the bathroom to powder her nose
and returns as the grandmother I
know and love so dearly.

Bob Anderson from "Days of Our Lives”

Bob Anderson is the owner-manager
of a large corporation. His major
weakness is a heart condition and
his vulnerability to evil, conniving
women. He is kind and gentle, loving
and caring, rich and powerful.
He is the perfect boss, the perfect
husband, the perfect father. He has
one daughter in her 20's whom he
loves and cares about; however, he
regrets that he never had a son to
leave his business to.

His current (third) wife is an evil,
conniving younger woman who married
him for his money and power. She
tried to undermine his corporation.
When he caught her, she fell down a
flight of stairs and suffered from
amnesia. She is now pregnant
and Bob wonders if he may finally
get a son to leave his corporation
to. But he also knows that his wife
is a bad person and wants to make
sure that she does not get control
of the company.

For the American housewife, soap
operas may serve as surrogate family
and friends. As my grandmother says,
"They keep me company every day. They
are my friends." Characters from
soap operas range from doctors to
hospital cleaning women, heads of
giant corporations to blue-collar
workers, housewives to working women,
nuns to prostitutes. The majority of
the characters are white, Protestant,
middle to upper class, and better

Questioning Consequences

Philip Hall Likes Me. I Reckon
Maybe

Bette Greene

Dell Publishing Company

$1.25/paper, for ages 9-14

Twelve-year-old Beth Lambert and
her family live in rural Arkansas,
near the small town of Pocahontas.
Beth is a very capable young woman;
her intelligence and determination
are demonstrated repeatedly as she
outwits turkey thieves, sells vege-
tables to earn money for veterinarian
college, and leads a picket of
a local store. Portrayed as a con-
fident, happy young person, Beth's
major problem involves her feelings
for a neighbor boy, Philip Hall. Al-
though she is clearly the leader and
the more capable of the two, she
perceives Philip to be superior.
Torn between her admiration for
her first love and the stifled a-
wareness that she is brighter than
he is, Beth fears Philip's rejection
if she does her best. She finally
reasons, "Well, Mr. Philip Hall,
for too long I've been worried that
you wouldn't like me if I became
the number-one best student, ran
faster in the relay race, or took
the blue ribbon for calf-raising."
Although the book ends with Beth
and Philip on good terms, the rea-
der is left with the feeling that
Beth will continue to struggle
with the dilemma many females face:
"Should I do my best and risk his
rejection or should I let him win
and thus, pamper his ego?"

All the characters in this book
are Black with the possible ex-
ceptions of the store owner and the
judge in the calf-raising contest
(there is no mention of race;
a few illustrations show the main
characters to be Black). The absen-
ce of racial tension and the per-
fect harmony within the Lambert
family seem almost too good to be
true. However, it is probable that
Greene wanted to focus on the
relationship between Beth and Phil-
ip; perhaps she didn't want other
themes to interfere with the drama
between the sexes.

When Megan Went Away

Jane Severance
illustrated by Tea Schook
Lollipop Power, Inc.
$1.85/paper, for ages 5-9

Although Shannon knows that Me-
gan will be moved out when she gets
home, she is unprepared for the
changes she finds. Megan's room and
rocking chair are gone. Mama is
sad and quiet. As Shannon wanders
around the house, she begins to
worry - was it her fault Megan
left? Would Megan still be there if
Shannon had been good more?

This story, dedicated to "all
children of lesbian mothers, for
the special hardships they may
face, and for the understanding we
hope they reach", tells through
text and illustration, of the
separation of a lesbian couple
through the eyes of one of their
daughters. Severance, with a lo-
ving awareness of the sadness/
guilt/anger children experience as
the result of separation, reassures
the young reader that although it
won't be easy, she and her mother
will feel better sometime.

Severance, in her first book,
demonstrates a sensitivity/aware-
ness of children and of lesbian
relationships. This, combined
with Schook's clever illustrations
(I love the Big Mama Rag t-shirts!)
makes for a very special book. I
highly recommend it.

than average looking. So what is the
problem? Is there something inherent-
ly wrong with soaps? Are they more
dangerous than comic strip characters
that are serialized for months at a
time? Are they an addiction? A depen-
dency? For most soap opera addicts,
the soap opera is truly an addiction.
But is the danger of soaps the addic-
tion itself or something else?

Soap opera's greatest danger is
probably the impact that it has on
viewers - the power it has on deci-
ding what is right or wrong, good or
bad. Although the characters might
seem unrealistic because of the numer-
ous problems and dilemmas that be-
fall them, on a day-to-day basis,
the characters seem quite real. But
even more than that the characters
are quite predictable in that there
are usually good and bad characters -
ones who are the wholesome, loving
family that we are all supposed to
want, as well as clever and devious
characters who continue to hurt the
"good" people. The "good" people,
however, are usually more preoccupied
with reforming the “bad" people than
they are with their own problems.
They are frequently martyred. Who
determines whose values are good or
bad, and what makes a character good
or bad?

Got To BE
Moving ON..."

It appears at first glance that it
is the writers of soap operas who
hold this control over their audience.
But the writers are, in fact, direct-
ly accountable to the advertisers.
Advertisers invest millions of doll-
ars in soap opera productions. Their
motives are not without a purpose.
The main purpose is to sell their pro-
ducts.

——
Laura from General Hospital:

When Laura was born her mother
was an unmarried pre-med student.
Laura's father was a married college
English professor. But due to con-
fusion at the hospital, Laura and
another baby were mixed up. So
Laura went home from the hospital
with the young married mother of the
other child. The other child died
and Laura's genetic mother went on
to medical school and became a doc-
tor.

When Laura was ten or eleven, her
genetic mother learned of the mix-up
from a dying delivery room nurse and
got Laura back. By then Laura's mother
was a doctor who was recently widow-
ed. Her husband, a wealthy tycoon,
knew of Laura's existence and paid
the family who was raising Laura to
leave town. He was jealous of his
wife's love for her child.

Since Laura came to live with her
genetic mother she has been enticed
into a sexual relationship with a
man in his 30's. She accidentally
killed this man when she learned
that he was just using her to hurt her
family. Her mother pleaded guilty
to murder to protect Laura and spent
time in jail. Laura became so bur-
dened with guilt that she exhibited
all kinds of bizarre psychiatric
symptoms.

A short time later, Laura found
"true love" with a younger, whole-
some man. Another woman was also in
love with this man and tried to plot
ways to get Laura's probation [for
killing her first lover) revoked.
Eventually, Laura marries her boy-
friend when she is seventeen. After
a short time she is raped by the
brother of the woman who tried to
get her probation revoked. He happens
to be the manager of the disco
which is a front for the syndicate
where Laura works part-time to buy
$1000 worth of law books for her
husband who is studying for his bar exam.

Laura is currently unable to have
a sexual relationship with her hus-
band due to her guilt over the rape.
No one knows that her employer/friend
raped her and that he is involved
with the syndicate. She continues to
work at the disco even after the rape
and refuses rape counseling with
her husband because she does not
want to expose the rapist. But now,
everyone is beginning to get suspic-
ious.

The majority of soap opera adverti-
sers are producers of laundry deter-
gent (if you really love your family
you owe them the cleanest wash in
town), cleaning products (a woman who
really cares for her family will
keep her house not only clean and
sanitary, but also clean smelling),

-I'm Trying to Be Tall and Blonde,

food products (if you love your fami-
ly you will feed them major brand
foods that they like), and beauty
products that can transform the
housewife who had cooked and cleaned
and done laundry all day into a glam-
orous, sensuous creature by the time
her husband gets home from work. The
common concern of all these adverti-
sers, it would seem, is to keep the
housewife/mother consuming their
products. This means that they want
to keep her at home. They want to
keep her believing in the virtues of
the capitalist system.

Jenny Vernon from "One Life to Live"

Jenny was a nun in a missionary in a
South American country that was
overrun by terrorists. When she fi-
nally got back to this country she
met and fell in love with a man. She
went through all kinds of trauma a-
round her religious state but fi-
nally love triumphed and she married
the man. However, he died before
they could consummate their marriage.
She wondered if it was a sign from
God.

Later, she fell helplessly in love
with Brad, the evil son of a psychia-
trist whose mother had committed
suicide.

After Jenny married Brad, he contin-
ued his evil ways - using women and
manipulating his friends. He gambled
away most of his money and stole her
jewelry and faked two robberies to
pay off his debts.

While Jenny was in the hospital
pregnant with Brad's child, he
raped Jenny's sister who was an ex-
prostitute turned good by the love of
a wholesome doctor. When Jenny learns
that her husband has raped her sister,
she goes into labor and the baby
dies, but Jenny's ex-prostitute sister
and her ex-pimp who is pretending
to be a doctor change the identi-
fication bracelets on Jenny's baby.
