A Once Closed Door, Re-Opened Again:

Vivian Mayer

(Author's Note:

The enclosed started off
as a letter to the editor,
responding to the group of
articles on Jewish femin-
ists, etc., in the February
issue of BMR. However, it
developed into something

of BMR. I want to discuss
this dilemma further, and
share my reasons for return-
ing to orthodox Judaism.

If all that we Jews can
point to with pride is the
fact that the Jewish people
have survived more than
2000 years of atrocities by
Western culture, if the cul-

feminist

Judaism

is

much longer and more invol-
ved than I had imagined it
would. I hope that you'll
use it, despite its length,
because it contains inform-
ation responding directly to
the identity doubts that a
lot of feminist Jewish wom-
en feel, and I have not seen
this information anywhere
else.

There's one point I couldn't
fit in (actually lots
of points, but this was on
my mind a lot as I wrote).
Rose talked about remember-
ing a powerful grandmother,
and having never gotten the
message that women "couldn't
be" successful outside the
home. I, too, remember a very
powerful grandmother and re-
ceived much (however mixed)
support for "masculine"
scholastic accomplishment.
This seems to be a theme
among Jewish women. It could
not be so if Jewish culture
were as anti-woman as the
prayer books and Synagogue
practices would lead one to
believe. I suspect that wo-
men from other ethnic and
racial minority backgrounds
may say the same. This re-
inforces my argument that it
is not Jewish culture, but
Christian capitalist culture
that reduced women to an
"ornament on a man's arm."
Unfortunately, Jews, espec-
ially after the Holocaust,
are often desperately as-
similationist, and Jewish
women have paid for it the
most.)

I had thought that the
door to Jewish identity had
slammed shut on me, but it
was re-opened in a way that
I least expected--by learn-
ing about the G-ddess and
Tarot. I identified strongly
with the "Double-Edged Dil-
emma" of Jewish feminists,
caught between anti-Semitic
feminism and patriarchal
Judaism, as expressed by
Rose in the February issue

ture that has survived is
nothing but a loathsome,
woman-hating, G-ddess-des-
troying, earth-plundering
rationale for male arrogance,
then why continue to exist
as Jews? Why not just drop
the hated identity, call our-
selves American feminist
pagans, and end the two-
thousand-year nightmare?

I strongly urge Jewish
feminists to look more deep-
ly into the image they have
of Judaism. The church that
burned millions of women as
witches got the same light
and heat from millions of
Jewish bodies, and it's not
just a coincidence. At pre-
sent, since the patriarchs
of Western culture have
failed to kill all the Jews,
they have tried to wipe out
the Jewish people by the
most basic means available
to conquerors: by defining.
They have defined religion
as spirit versus flesh, a
matter of conscience. "Re-
ligious practice" consists
of gathering to watch a ser-
vice presented by an ord-
ained minister or priest
(or rabbi), in a special
building away from daily
life, on a particular day
of the week. They have de-
fined Judaism as a "relig-
ion" this way too. To do so
required that Judaism be
chopped into bits and the
good parts thrown away.

This is exactly what has
happened in our place and
time.

What are the "good parts"
of Judaism? For me, they
are the following: 1) the
holiness of material exist-
ence, 2) the holiness of wo-
men, expressed through pri-
marily or exclusively fe-
male rituals, and 3) the
Jewish concept of what we
worship.

1. The holiness of mat-
erial existence: Unlike
Christians, who seek to

"triumph" over the flesh,
the major purpose of Jew-
ish life is to unite spirit
and flesh, the world of
matter, by surrounding our
most mundane actions--from
eating to conduct of busi-
ness--with holy rituals and
laws.

A Jewish man at my work-
place, who has little know-
ledge of Judaism, told me
he had gone to a synagogue
recently, where he heard a
section of the Torah--the
core of Jewish holy writ-
ings--translated into Eng-
lish. The "story" he heard
was: When you build a roof
that people will walk on,
you must build a safety
rail around it so that no
one will accidentally fall
off. The man was amused and
disappointed that such mun-
dane stuff would be consid-
ered holy. I was delighted.

Jewish heritage, that re-
gards good manners, respect
for the earth and other
life-forms, and public wel-
fare as matters for holy
ordinance.

2. The holiness of women:
The primary role in Juda-
ism's primary goal, spirit-
ualizing material life, is
played by women. Each day
and each month, Jewish wo-
men perform rituals which
men do not or cannot per-
form. These include the very
ancient rites sanctifying
women's sexual power: a
week after her menstruation
ends, a married woman im-
merses herself in the wat-
ers of the Mikveh, a pool

of natural (i.e. rain, river,

ocean, not tap) water. She
emerges in the image of G-d,
in that she is imbued with
the G-dly power to create new
life. Also,

since the destruc-

tion of the Temple thousands
of years ago, Jewish men no
longer offer sacrifices, but
Jewish women continue to do
so, in a most non-violent way,
by burning a portion of the
bread they bake each week,
Challah. It amazes me that
Jewish women today reject
these acts of sanctification
in favor of standing in the
synagogue, chanting along
with the men. Traditional Jew-
ish communities recognize the
primary importance of women's
rituals by declaring that the
Mikveh must be built before
the Synagogue is built. Need-
less to say, Christian pat-
riarchal culture has done its
utmost to degrade and erase
these Jewish women's rituals
from our consciousness.

Spirituality / Religion

Positive Images Of Judaism Re-Claimed

what we worship: First, ask
yourself this: When you re-
fer to "the G-ddess," what ex-
actly do you mean? Do you
mean Is-s but not Asta-te?

Do you mean the names used by
Greeks, such as K-re and Ar-
-mis, but not the names us-
ed by Egyptians, such as Is-s
and N-t? When you think

of all of creation, can you
point to any two things and
say "this is of the G-ddess"
and "this is not?" The things
that are "not" of the G-ddess
-- how do they come to exist,
and how do they stay in ex-
istence from one moment to
the next?

In the Torah are various
names for G-d. Some are "male"
and some are "female." In con-
versation, devout Jews usually
refer to G-d as "HaShem",
“The Name", and I prefer that:
neuter word to the male-pol-
arized English noun "G-d". I
learned this from Chassidic
Jewish women (Chassidim are
very pious and mystical, of-
ten Jewish separatists). They
told me that the several He-
brew names of HaShem each re-
fer to a different aspect of
HaShem -- El-im creating na-
ture and natural law, A-noy
the essence of mercy, She-nah
the intimate presence of Ha-
Shem in material creation,
etc. I have observed these
pious Jews to take the same
care about pronouncing or
writing non-Jewish names of
HaShem as about the Jewish
names. Why? Because they all
refer to HaShem. This is one
meaning of "G-d is one" in
Judaism. Contrast this with
the Christian practice of
slaughtering people who don't
call HaShem "Jesus."

Another meaning of HaShem's
unity is that everyone and
everything is from HaShem --
all worlds, all conditions,
all creations. I don't want
to get into theological de-
bate, and I'm not capable of
it. I only want to point out
that the ideas that all crea-
tures are holy, that the earth
must be treated with utmost
respect, follow as naturally
from mystical Judaism as from
Women's Religion.

The "Thirteen Articles of
Faith," written by a 12th
century rabbi and the clos-
est thing Jews have to theo-
logical dogma, do not assert
that HaShem is male. They
assert that HaShem is “com-
pletely without physical sub-
stance," -- i.e., no penis.

To make a physical image of
HaShem is regarded as the
most deadly of sins. Why?
Because by making an image,
we limit and degrade HaShem.
It's so easy to scoff at this
warning, but I see it differ-
ently than the men on the
pulpits. I see idolatry as
the source of the pain and
shame with which G-ddess-lov-
ing Jewish women react to
Judaism as it is usually pre-
sented to us. Long ago, Jew-
ish patriarchs created an
idol in the form of a male,
called it G-d, and worshipped
it. I think this happened be-
cause Jewish males began to
identify with the patriarchs
of nations around them several
years ago. First, they had
to have a king, like other
nations. Later, when the
kingdom was destroyed, and
the rabbis began writing
prayers to keep Jewish iden-
tity together in exile, they
sought a word to express the
power of HaShem, and came up
with -- "King." And so it
went. Thus idolatry is deadly
to the Jewish people.

I think that Jewish women
who have studied women's
spirituality have a unique
power to clean this male idol
out of our Jewish worship.
For example, when I first
read about the fertility laws
of Tumah, Taharah and Mikveh,
in a book by a male, I felt
so humiliated that I could
not even bring myself to pro-
test -- protest would have
required speech, and I was
speechless. The English tran-
slation calls menstruating
women "unclean!" For more
than fifteen years I have
hated those rabbis and their
Judaism, and longed for what

they robbed me of. Learning
about the G-ddess addressed

a spiritual need for me, but
could not replace the loss of
my heritage. This past year,
I have asked some Chassidic
Jewish women to tell me their
understanding of Tumah, Taha-
rah and Mikveh. Their answers
set off fireworks inside me.
They answered using a concept
that I had encountered in
only one other place: Women's
Religion and Tarot! Tumah,
menstruation, is Death -- not
the morbid male, Christian
death, but the Wisewoman's
understanding of Death as a
necessary pre-condition to
new life, part of a cycle.
Mikveh, immersion in natural
water, corresponds to The
Hanged Man of Tarot. Taharah,
the pure essence of Ha-
Shem's fertile creative pow-
er, is like Temperance, or as
it is sometimes called, art.
With great envy I realized
that these women not only
talked about spirituality,
they literally immerse their
whole beings in it. They did
not use Tarot vocabulary, but
the connection was obvious.
Alienated Jewish women, seek-
ing their spiritual roots,
may find such connections as
valuable as I do.

I would not advise a woman
raised in Christianity to try
to influence her Church. From
what I have heard of Christ-
ianity (and this may be
wrong), the churches are
founded on denial of life and
women. But Judaism is differ-

Basic traditional acts such
as lighting candles for the
Sabbath and celebrating the
New Moon with other Jewish
women unite our women's spir-
ituality harmoniously with
our Jewish tradition.

The barriers Jewish femin-
ists, particularly Jewish les-
bians and celibates face in
trying to reconnect with our
roots, are well known to us.
It is painful to think that
one aspect of a woman's life
should cut her off from her
entire heritage. As usual,
the burden is on the woman
outside of tradition to find
a way to get the spiritual in-
formation she needs without
giving up in the face of pre-
judice and misunderstanding.

I find the women of the Cha-
bad Chassidic movement easi-
est to learn from. They are
willing to talk, sympathetic
to Jewish identity, and, be-
ing part of a Jewish separa-
tist tradition, they can
readily spot Christian ideas
and help us sort them out.
There are Chabad Houses in
many large cities in the USA.
I think it would not work to
try to "make points" with
these women, nor do our life-
styles need to be "justified"
to another person.

Since I've written so much
more than I expected to, I
might as well add another 150
words about a subject that
always comes up: Jewish im-
perialism. Regarding the in-
vasion of Canaan, no one
really knows what happened.
There are no impartial his-
tories. In those days, every-
one invaded everyone else and
made a virtue of it. Regard-
ing the modern Israeli/Pales-
tinian tragedy, it is a sec-
ular conflict in which the
current superpowers have
played off some of the most
wretched people alive today,
victims of European imperi-
alism in the Middle East, and
victims of European pogroms
and Holocaust. Israeli policies
are not Jewish values. I must
say that it just kills me to
see how much energy women put
into fighting over which
group of power-sick men are
"right." If we put that ener-
gy into solving the human

problems of food, shelter
and education, the political
problems would take care of
themselves.
