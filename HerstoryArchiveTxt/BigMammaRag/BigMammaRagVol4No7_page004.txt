Clerical Workers’ Organization Makes Gains At CCD

In a country ruled by governmental  
and economic bureaucracies the impor-  
tance of clerical workers is immense.  
Without the work of the people who  
keep all the records and handle all  
the communications within and between  
the bureaucracies, the economy and  
government would collapse.

While bosses may, in most cases,  
wield the final decision-making power,  
the secretaries are the ones who  
maintain the flow of money and paper  
from day to day. However, though  
secretaries are very often aware of  
the intricate workings of the burea-  
ucracy in which they work, and which  
they keep going, seldom are they rec-  
ognized for the knowledge that they  
have—with the size of their sal-  
ary, promotion into administrative  
positions, or with the simple acknow-  
ledgment of the importance of their  
contribution.

This kind of treatment is linked to  
sexist attitudes. At one time being  
a clerk or secretary was a beginning  
step to learning how a company was  
run and led to promotion into an ad-  
ministrative position; however, when  
that was true, secretaries were pro-  
mising young men.

There are difficulties in organizing  
secretaries to secure better pay,  
working conditions and other job-re-  
lated benefits. The nature of the job  
is very isolated, even though in many  
cases secretaries are jammed as many  
as possible in one room. Each one has  
to pay attention to her own indivi-  
dual task. Seldom are there collec-  
tive efforts between secretaries.

Another difficulty is that the sec-  
retaries who work for only one boss  
may have different interests than those  
who work in a secretarial pool of  
some sort. Secretarial pools empha-  
size the interchangeability (and ex-  
pendability) of each individual—  
organizing among these women is diff-  
icult because they know they can be  
easily replaced. The one-boss secre-  
tary is usually paid more, and often  
develops a loyalty to her boss—  
mixed with a thankfulness that she is  
not working in the secretarial pool.

An example of secretaries organizing  
themselves in Denver is the classified  
Employee's Forum at Community College  
of Denver-Auraria Campus. The Forum  
began a few years ago with seven wo-  
men who worked at the college. The  
impetus of its formation came from  
state personnel working for people who  
were not state personnel and did not  
know the regulations governing them.  
Conflicts were arising between what  
the secretaries were supposed to do  
and what their bosses wanted them to  
do.  
They also were isolated from the ot-  
her people at the college—they didn't  
seem to fit in with the students, the  
faculty, or the administration as far  
as having common job problems and con-  
cerns.

So the people of the Forum began stu-  
dying state civil service requireme-  
nts and grievance procedures so that  
they could know and exercise their  
rights. They also worked on setting  
their own guidelines for college cam-  
pus office procedures, and initiated  
in-service training sessions and occ-  
asional social events.

3rd Colorado Women’s Festival To  
Benefit Two New Feminist Projects

There will be a Third Annual  
Colorado Women's Festival, 1976.  
The all-day affair is scheduled  
for September 12 at Denver's  
East High School.

By established tradition the  
festival celebrates the stren-  
gth and spirit of women. It is  
a chance to share together,  
celebrate together, exchange  
ideas and information, and ex-  
hibit our products and pro-  
women resources. There will be  
arts/crafts and exhibition bo-  
oths, refreshments, games,  
speakers, workshops, live ent-  
ertainment, and more. Child-  
care will be available for  
exhibitors.

The committee has decided in  
its initial meetings to divide  
the festival proceeds between  
two new feminist-oriented wom-  
en's collectives, 50% each to  
Emerging Woman Press and Woman-  
quest. Emerging Woman Press  
has major responsibility for  
the Public Relations and Enter-  
tainment Committees. Woman-  
quest has major responsibility  
for Booths and Location/Legal-  
ities Committees (including  
general festival coordination  
and childcare).  
Womanquest:  
a Creative Teaching  
Collective has been founded  
by four local feminists,  
Patti Hague, Pauline Laurent,  
Ann Morrow, and Pat Murphy.  
They are a non-profit, but self-  
sustaining collective, oriented  
toward self-exploration and di-  
scovery by exposing women to  
alternative ideas and skills.  
Classes will include the art of  
stained glass, woodcrafts, body  
work, self-health, dance, rad-  
ical feminist therapy, and rad-  
ical feminist future visions.  
Womanquest is available to var-  
ious community groups and org-  
anizations for consultation as  
well.

The Emerging Woman Press has  
formed this summer as a group  
of 6 to 12 women of varying de-  
grees of commitment. The press  
collective plans to raise appr-  
oximately $12,000 to buy the  
necessary equipment for a well-  
equipped print shop through per-  
sonal donations, fund-raising  
projects, and applying for  
"seed money" grants. They see  
the project as being anti-pro-  
fit and having many-fold bene-  
fits for the community.

First they plan to serve the  
printing needs of the women's  
and political communities of  
the Denver area. Money from  
this “business end" of the pro-  
ject would allow for publica-  
tion of local writers, with an  
emphasis on quality but inexpen-  
sive small booklets of politi-  
cal analysis, research and po-  
etry/non-fiction. The third  
priority of the press would be  
to train women in the printing  
trade and provide at least sub-  
sistence level salaries to wor-  
kers.

The Denver community has ex-  
pressed need for a press for a  
long time; the interest is here,  
all we need is the money.

The last year has shown the Forum to  
be continuing its growth in strength  
and numbers. An example of the atti-  
tude they must continually fight is  
that when the new Auraria campus was  
planned and built, no space was set  
aside on the whole campus for a sec-  
retaries lounge and lunch area. They  
have, however, secured money for a  
physical fitness program once a week  
and continued in-service training  
workshops. They also continue to suc-  
ceed in getting grievances heard and  
remedied.

Their pride in the job that they do  
has prompted them to reply to the def-  
amation of secretaries in Newsweek  
magazine, as well as in the CCD-A  
student newspaper. In the last year  
the secretaries from all three CCD  
campuses have formed an All-College  
Forum to facilitate communications  
and increase their bargaining strength.

One grievance brought up by the All-  
College Forum illustrates again the  
problems of secretaries. Until the ac-  
tions of the Forum forced its change,  
it was standard policy for secreta-  
ries to be graded (and thus paid)  
according to the rank of their boss.  
This meant although one woman might  
actually be doing more work than an-  
other, she could be paid less if her  
boss was not ranked as high as the  
other's. Through meetings with the  
Denver Area Council, which governs the  
College, with Ed Taylor, Personnel  
Director of CCD, and with the Presi-  
dent's Staff, this unfair rule was  
changed.

In another case, a complaint was  
brought to Mr. Taylor concerning an  
employee who was getting special pri-  
vileges from her boss. This matter  
was privately discussed, in supposed  
confidence, but several days later the  
woman who had brought the complaint  
(as representative of other secreta-  
ries as well as herself) was called  
into the office of the Vice-Presi-  
dent and questioned about her comp-  
laint.

Other grievances brought up had to  
do with hiring practices which were  
not fair to civil service personnel,  
the number of civil service positions  
in relation to the growing faculty,  
and the time limits imposed on re-  
quests for employees to be reclassi-  
fied. (Reclassification usually means  
a raise in pay.)

As Judy Blowers, president of the  
CCD-Auraria Classified Employee's  
Forum said, "The administration and  
faculty often look at the clerical  
worker as an employee of lesser im-  
port, while in reality they too are  
an integral and necessary part of any  
institution. We must make them aware  
that we are doing essential and comple-  
x work for which we receive inequitable  
pay."

The Forum is an illustration of how  
women in the workforce are asserting  
their rights and pride in themselves  
and the work they do.

Clinic Seeks Nurse Clinician

Women's Health Service Clinic in  
Colorado Springs faces the possibi-  
lity of drastically reducing and  
changing the strategy of healthcare  
services it offers to Colorado wo-  
men. The clinic's present nurse  
clinician is returning to school to  
add to her nursing credentials, and  
as of yet there has been no success  
in finding another qualified person  
to cover in her absence. This will  
mean cutting the number of clinic  
hours almost in half. Such a cut  
back would not only reduce the num-  
ber of women who could be medical-  
ly treated but would also greatly  
curtail the income of this totally  
self-supported group.

The person needed to join the WHSC  
is a nurse clinician, trained or  
experienced in GYN or Family Plan-  
ning. The job emphasis is on exam-  
inations with proficiency in bi-  
manuals and pregnancy screening a  
must.

Through their collective struc-  
ture these women work together "to  
provide high quality medical care  
at reasonable prices for all women."  
This working environment offers the  
opportunity to work with dedicated  
women in a preventative-educational  
oriented atmosphere with emphasis  
on sharing knowledge with the wo-  
men served.

The women of the collective are  
determined not to close. If no  
new nurse can be found, they will  
change the emphasis from medical  
treatment aspects to more self-  
health classes. However, women  
from all over Colorado attend the  
clinic for its non-oppressive medi-  
cal service. These women then have  
been introduced, many for the first  
time, to the concept of self-health.

Any nurse clinician (or other  
person) interested in the clinic  
can call: (303) 471-9492.
