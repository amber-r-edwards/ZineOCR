The modern symbol for the  
female is the ancient pictograph  
of the Great Goddess: her  
equilateral cross topped by the  
full moon. This Venus symbol is  
not an arbitrary one. The threads  
of our lives weave back into  
history and pre-history and  
somewhere in the maze of all the  
Myths, the archaeological  
remains and the collective  
memory, is the tradition of the  
Great Goddess or Great Mother.  
It is an inheritance that is impor-  
tant for us to understand. The  
names may change, the symbols  
vary, but the essence is the  
same. It is the essence of this  
archetype of the Feminine  
carried within all women today  
that is the richest source for our  
spiritual development.  

It is not enough to rummage  
about in search of legends and  
associations and write about the  
different goddesses and all their  
names and stories. What we  
need to see is the connection  
between these symbols and the  
actual sources of spirituality  
which can be a rediscovering of  
our roots. Several studies which  
have only recently become  
known have begun to make this  
connection clearer, and their fin-  
dings give validity to the idea  
that in the symbols of the Great  
Mother is the basis for a  
feminist approach to religion.  

First Religions Matriarchies  

J.J. Bachofen, in his pioneer-  
ing study Myth, Religion and  
Mother Right, established that  
the first religions and cultures  
were matriarchal and based on  
the primacy of a Great Goddess,  
creator of the world, mother of  
the universe. For those who  
would scoff at myths as fairy  
tales, Bachofen showed that  
there are truths other than  
historical. Myths in fact preserve  
our collective memory; they are  
faithful reflections of primordial  
thinking. History only begins  
with the written word; myths  
reach back into the early begin-  
nings of time and convey truth in  
a symbolic form that has its own  
validity.  

For those who still rely on  
rational, concrete evidence as  
the only basis for truth consider  
the recent archaeological  
diggings in Anatolia in southern  
Turkey. The excavations of Çatal  
Höyük confirm it to be the oldest  
town in the history of civilization,  

dating back to 6800 B.C. In the  
book Archaeologia Mundi  
Anatolia I, it is reported that  
shrines and sanctuaries devoted  
to a domestic cult revolving  
around the Mother Goddess are  
decorated with women’s  
breasts, the double axe, bull’s  
heads and horns. Among the  
clay and stone figurines the  
Mother Goddess is represented  
in three different aspects: a  
young woman, a mother in the  
act of giving birth, and an old  
woman. In the wall paintings,  
also the oldest in the world, are  
the Mother's symbols: triangles,  
chrysalises, circles, the dog and  
the leopard. In all of the un-  
covered artifacts, in the bone  
carvings and agricultural im-  
plements are clear signs of a  
matriarchy in which a cult of  
goddesses predominated.  

The Great Mother  

The findings signify that the  
very foundations of religious  
thought of our ancestors have  
been buried from us. It is a com-  
bination of such evidence as  
well as the myths and  
archetypes that can clarify our  
relationship to the Great  
Mother. While many women to-  
day have rejected the Judaic-  
Christian traditions because of  
their patriarchal overtones or  
their heavy reliance on male  
worship (God and Jesus), they  
have yet to develop their own  
traditions. The above studies  
show that worship of a male god  
figure is relatively recent in  
human history and not  
something that has always ex-  
isted. Women perhaps should  
explore the archetype of the  
Feminine which Erich  
Neumann, in The Great Mother,  
feels is necessary for the  
soundness of human collective  
life. The overemphasis on  
patriarchal values has left the  
world without a sense of  
balance, and an appreciation of  
the Feminine archetype can lend  
itself to psychic wholeness.  

The Feminine Archetype  

Archetype quite simply is an  
original pattern or image model  
which functions in the collective  
unconscious. It is “an in-  
ward image in the psyche rather  
than a concrete image that exists  
in time and place. Symbol is its out-  
ward expression as found in  
myths and dreams and everyday  
life. It is the visible appearance  
of the archetype. The concept of  
the hero, for example, is based on  
an archetype, though we usually  
see specific heroes and think of  
specific symbols. Hero, by the  
way, was a woman.  

The Great Mother is nature  
herself, life-giving and life-  
taking. When the archetype  
manifests itself as The Good  
Mother, the appearances in  
nature are of vegetation and  
growth: trees and earth, lakes  
and fruit, mountains and caves.  
Spontaneous with this positive  
aspect is the Terrifying Mother  
accompanying the cycle of death  
and appearing in symbols of cof-  
fins, tombs, and urns. Nature  
symbols extend to cultural sym-  
bols: jars, kettles, clothing,  
ovens, bowls, ships and houses.  
When unnatural symbols or  
hostile ones appear (Neumann  
quotes Eve being taken from  
Adam's rib, out of Adam rather  
than from the Mother) it is an  

attempt to construct a purely  
abstract world in contradiction  
to the nature symbol that con-  
tinually reasserts itself.  

In the beginning there was  
woman, according to Helen  
Diner, author of Mothers and  
Amazons. Man is a later  
phenomenon. Through  
parthenogenesis the original  
female reproduced herself and  
later the male (contrary to Chris-  
tian myth which says man  
created woman). This biological  
view is supported in several  
cultural myths. For the Greeks,  
Gaea, the female earth, first  
emerges from the primal vagina.  
In the Vedic religion, the  
Goddess Vac is the place of  
origin from which all things  
emerge, a maternal mouth cavi-  
ty. The imagery of the female  
figure extends to the breasts. In  
India Ma Mata, the maternal  
breast, has its equivalents in  
other languages as Maya  
(Buddha’s mother) and Mary  
(mother of Jesus).  

Woman = body = vessel  

Central to the understanding  
of the Great Mother are the cor-  
responding ideas of the Great  
Round and the Great Container.  
The unique relationship  
between the mother and the  
child in the womb is the original  
situation of container and con-  
tained. Related to this is the key  
symbol of VESSEL as in woman  
= body = vessel. We are con-  
tained within the world, with the  
underground below and the  
heavens above and around us —  
a world vessel. So the Great  
Round is a nourishing vessel,  
giver of life, warmth and protec-  
tion, and this is expressed uni-  
versally as woman = body = vessel =  
world.  

We in the Western world often  
think in terms of words first, ex-  
cept in our dreams which may  
make it difficult to understand  
the importance of symbols such  
as vessel. Yet early people, like  
the artists and children and  
mystics of today, thought  
in terms of images; pictures and  

symbols are the original  
language.  
Another symbol associated  

with the feminine conception of  
natural principles is the egg. The  
egg represents all of the cosmos:  
container and contained,  
lightness and darkness, heaven  
and earth are seen as products  
of the two halves of the egg. As  
the egg contains the mystery of  
life, so the processes of the  
Great Mother relate to the  
mysteries of life and death. The  
Mysteries of Eleusis, associated  
with the worship of Demeter,  
Goddess of Corn and fertility, ex-  
plains how an earth goddess can  
give birth to earthly things  
(children and vegetation) and  
how a child of this material  
world can become the highest  
spiritual essence. Through the  
goddesses is this important link  
between the earthly realm and  
the spiritual realm, for it is the  
moon which is the creation of an  
earth goddess.  

The mysteries concern the ac-  
complishment of woman being  
able to give birth to something  
which is more than earthbound  
so that the child of this material  
world becomes light and spirit, a  
heavenly being, the moon.  

Demeter and Persephone  

The story of Demeter and her  
daughter Persephone is usually  
related in schools on only one  
level. In this version Pluto, the  
God of the underworld, abducts  
and ravishes Persephone. When  
he takes her to Hades, Demeter  
grieves and causes nothing to  
grow on the earth. An arrange-  
ment is made whereby for half  
the year Persephone lives with  
her mother and during that time  
vegetation flourishes. During  
the other six months when  
Persephone is with Pluto, the  
earth is barren. But the  
mysteries involve more than an  
explanation of the seasons.  
Persephone, once she bears the  

child, becomes Kore. Daughter -  

becomes woman becomes the  
Eternal Womanly. Kore's child  
becomes the moon. Kore as a  
moon goddess symbolizes the  
power of the Great Mother to  
create from her body the  
celestial body of the moon.  

The moon remains one of the  

time of celebration for the  
matriarchies. At this time, the  
moon is full and occupies the  
highest point in its cycle. It is on  
this basis that in astral  
mythology the moon has an  
upper-world character and the  
sun an underworld character.  

Mohammedans still use lunar  
reckoning for time, and even  
Easter is determined by the  
moon. The hot cross bun and  
pocketbook roll were baked for  
the festival of Oestre, Goddess  
of fertility from where the names  
Oestrus (animal sexual heat)  
and Easter are derived.  

The Great Mother as Isis  

As the Great Mother assumes  

different forms and  
manifestations, so the moon  
goddesses have taken on  

different shapes. In Egyptian  
theology Isis assumes the form  
of a cow. The cosmic cow is seen  
as nurse and protector like Hat-  
hor, the Asiatic Queen of  
Heaven. Some think she mul-

favored spiritual symbols of the  
matriarchal sphere. It is related  
to the Great Mother of the Night  
Sky though with each culture it  
assumes different names and  
embodiments. It is believed that  
through the moon the most  
mysterious yet most powerful  
aspects of the different  
goddesses reveal themselves.  

The relation of the moon to  
nature, to the fluid elements of  
the universe, to growth and  
rhythm is an outer symbol of the  
reproductive energies of nature.  
The calendars of antiquity mark-  
ed time (mensis) by moons, not  
the sun or seasons. Thus words  
like menses, menstruation, and  
measurement have entered our  
language. The lunar year of the  
matriarchy was 13 months, the  
lunar month was 28 days.  
Justice was dispensed at the  
time of the new moon. Planting  
was done at the time of a waxing  
moon.  

The Winter Solstice, when we  
today have our traditional  
Christmas holidays, was also a  

tiplied into the “seven Hat-hors”  
(the Pleiades?) who foretell the  
future of every child at birth.  
Isis was believed to glide  
through the upper fertilizing  
waters on the lunar sickle, a  
heavenly moon bark. The bark  
was propelled by weavers over  
the great egg that is land.  
Hecate, symbol of the dark,  
waning side of the moon, is often  
depicted as a horse. Selene, also  
a goddess of the waning moon,  
often shown on horseback. In  
Mesopotamia, goddess Lilith of  
night is often pictured winged  
and bird-footed. Artemis,  
Cybele, and Diana also appear in  
animal or beast form.  
Ishtar of Babylonian  
mythology is identified with the  
moon and also the morning and  
evening star. In fact Ishtar also  
rode on a boat, an ark. And in  
contrast to the Biblical story of  
the flood, there is the story of  
Ishtar riding out a flood on an ark  
— a moonboat, for sometimes
