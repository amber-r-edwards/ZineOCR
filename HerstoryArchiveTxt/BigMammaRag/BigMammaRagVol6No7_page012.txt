Bobbi LeBlanc, 31, has been in the  
Colorado Women's Correctional Insti-  
tute at Canon City, Colorado since  
January 1977. She was sentenced in  
August of last year for 3 counts of  
second degree forgery.  

In the fall of 1976 she forged 3  
checks from the same group of checks.  
Her term for each check is 8-10, to  
be served consecutively. This means  
her actual sentence is 24-30. On a  
similar conviction, another woman  
forged checks from the same checkbook  
that Bobbi used and received a sent-  
ence of 0-5 years.  

Bobbi says her sentence was extreme-  
ly harsh because the district attorney  
especially disliked her. (The D.A.  
was Ms. Whiteman of Arapahoe County  
District Court.) Bobbi had no money  
for a lawyer and the public defender  
did not work very hard in her behalf.  

Bobbi has never worked or held a job  
in her life. She's never received job  
training and has no skills. With a  
jail record, it is nearly impossible  
for her to get a job.  

At CWCI there is only one training  
program for women, in data processing.  
Bobbi says that the prison administra-  
tion is stopping the G.E.D. program and  
the business courses. However, in the  
men's section of the prison there are  
programs such as printing, plumbing,  
electrical repair, etc.  

The women’s section has no job counselor and the  
only psychiatric counselor for women  
is a man to whom most of the women  
have trouble relating.  

Prison is not a place to improve  
one's situation in society. Bobbi  
says, "You stand still inside." Sixty  
percent of the women at CWCI return to  
prison. Bobbi has been in prison three  
times: once for robbery (1960), and  
twice for forgery (1974, 1977).  

Bobbi said that the women in prison  
get along pretty well. "There are  
tensions because we are confined to a  
small place. There is pettiness like  
stealing and gossip. But I couldn't

do time in a men's jail at all; there  
is so much violence there."  

It is very important for the women  
doing time to get outside of the pri-  
son occasionally. Inmates are allowed  
weekend furloughs to homes approved by  

the prison.  

Another service we can provide is to  
write letters of support and send art-  
icles, books, and posters. The address  
is: Women Prisoners, Box 500, Canon  
City, Colorado 81212. If you are in-  
terested in having a prisoner visit on  
furlough, send your letter c/o Sherran  
Reynolds. We could also write to the  
Administrative Director of CWCI and  
Governor Lamm to ask for more training  
programs for the women.  

For more information on Bobbi Le-  
Blanc's case, contact Deb Taylor,  

1715 East Sixteenth Ave., Denver, Co.  
80218. Hopefully, if there is enough  
protest, her sentence will be reduced.

Since 1870 most persons convicted  
of a crime have been given an inde-  
terminate sentence. This means that  
the date for their release from pri-  
son is not set except within a very  
broad range of years. For instance,  

a person might receive an indetermi-  
nate sentence of 1-5 years. They can  
be released by the parole board any  
time during that period. This is to  
prevent arbitrary or vindictive sen-  
tencing by the judge and to allow  
the parole board to consider all  
sides of the case, any extenuating  
circumstances surrounding the crime,  
an individual's past history and her  
progress in prison. From all this  
information taken together a just  
date for release is set. The parole  
board is supposedly comprised of ex-  
perts in human behavior and reform.  
Therefore, there is no means to ap-  
peal a decision made by the parole  
board.  

The theory behind indeterminate  
sentencing seems very fair. It implies  
that prisons will have rehabilitation  
programs that an offender can utilize.  
It also implies that if a crime is  
committed out of a pressing need (to  
survive, eat, etc.) and the offender  
rehabilitates she will serve a short-  
er sentence under indeterminate sen-  
tencing. The truth is, however, that  
since the indeterminate sentence has  
been adopted persons are spending  
longer terms in prison for identical  
crimes. (My information covered only  
men, but in reviewing how women have  

been sentenced under  
this law, it can  
be safely assumed that the disparity  
is at least as great for women. Read  
on.) The Congress of the National  
Prison Association unanimously adop-  
ted the indeterminate sentence in  
1870. By 1906 persons committed to  
prison under that law served an aver-  
age of one year, 2 months, and 5 days  
longer for identical crimes than with  
a definite sentence. By 1937 the time  
served had lengthened even more.  

This law has in effect set the par-  
ole board as a committee of moral  
arbitrators for society's benefit.  
Few women's prisons have any rehabi-  
litation programs, unless knowing  
cooking, cleaning and laundry, the  
only "vocational" programs available  
in many women's prisons, will make  
good, law abiding citizens of them.  
What happens is that women not only  
serve time for the crime she commits  
but also for how far she has stepped  
out of her role as the passive fe-  
male.  

While by 1973 many states had abo-  
lished indeterminate sentencing for  
men, fully half a dozen states still  
had indeterminate sentencing for  
women. The state of New Jersey justi-  
fied it by saying in the case of  
State of New Jersey v. Costello:  

"... the legislature could  
legitimately conclude that  
female criminals were basic-  
ally different from male crim-  
inals, that they were more  

this law, it can  
be assumed that the disparity  
is at least as great for women.  

Most states have now or are consi-  
dering abolishing indeterminate  
sentencing. This is a vital reform  
that must be supported. In Colorado,  
House Bill 1589, sponsored by Ann  
Gorshiche, has passed and will go into  
effect April 1, 1979 if all goes well.  
As it stands now, it will not only  
abolish the indeterminate sentence  
but change the role of the parole  
officer. He will represent the pri-  
son but will act as an advocate for  
the parolee. He will be required by  
law to help find housing and  
a job for the ex-offender.  

Governor Lamm vetoed the bill, but  
his veto was overturned by the su-  
preme court on a technicality. How-  
ever, he has appointed an interim  
study committee which will make  
recommendations concerning amendments  
to change it. This bill must be sup-  
ported as it now stands. Write or call  
your representative to urge their  
support.  

Once upon a time  
there was a dream,  
A dream of all women coming together  
and turning the world around,  
Turning the world around  
and making it over.

Those in Darkness  

Feelings  
of Confinement  

I sit here in a cold and  
damp cell  

Sentenced to life  

in hell  

because I refuse  

to bow down  

and lose my  

womanhood  

pride and  

dignity  

Police, judges, guards  
shrinks, parole boards  
say I am  

vicious and hostile  
Why?  

Because I refuse to give up  
my sanity  

All I can say to you  
is  

even if you  

keep me caged  

like a savage beast  
for a million  

years  

You will never succeed  
in taking my mind  

America--where have you gone?  
Land of the free, corrupted by the pigs  

I will always stand up  
and fight  
no matter how many  
times  
I am knocked down  
and beat  

With indeterminate sentencing the  

parole board can act out all their  
bigotries, and in many parts of the  
country receive support for doing it.  
There is no appeal system for a parole  
board decision. Lesbians, political  
prisoners, inmate leaders, and all  
women who do not fit the feminine  

Let me out!
