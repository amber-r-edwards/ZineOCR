All witchcraft comes from carnal  
lust, which in women is insatiable.  
Wherefore for the sake of fulfilling  
their lusts they consort with devils.  
It is sufficiently clear that it  
is no matter for wonder that there  
are more women than men found in-  
fected with the heresy of witch-  
craft... And blessed be the Higher  
Who has so far preserved the male  
sex from so great a crime...  
(Malleus Maleficarum)

I've always thought that the appear-  
ances of W.I.T.C.H. (Women's Inter-  
national Terrorist Conspiracy From  
Hell) was one of the cleverer early  
WLM yippie tactics. And since like  
many of my sisters I'm curious about  
witches, I decided to do a little  
research on the history of women  
and witchcraft for this month's issue  
of Big Mama Rag. One place to start  
such a search is with the late medie-  
val witch craze.  

The European witch craze was start-  
ling in its dimensions. Starting in  
Germany, Italy and other countries  
in the 14th century, it spread to  
France and England in the 16th cen-  
tury. Thousands upon thousands of  
people were killed—usually burned at  
the stake. One writer estimated that  
in certain German cities, there were  
an average of six hundred "witches"  
put to death a year, "Nine hundred  
witches were destroyed in a single  
year in the Wertzberg area, and a  
thousand in and around Como. At  
Toulouse four hundred were put to  
death in a day. In the Bishopric  

of Trier, in 1585, two villages  
were left with only one female in-  
habitant each." And this mass  
hysteria was no delusion of the un-  
educated poor. Belief in witches  
was nearly universal, even among  

the emerging scientific community.  
Most important, it had the active  
support of the all-powerful Church.  

“insanity or dreams”  

If it is true as some have suggested,  
that witchcraft represented surfac-  
ing of an older pre-Christian cult in  
which women played a major role, you  
would expect the Church to feel very  
threatened by it. Oddly enough the  
Church had through most of its his-  
tory officially considered the tra-  
ditional powers of witches—casting  

spells, turning themselves into ani-  
mals and so on—as the products of  
insanity or dreams. What changed  
the Church's mind is not clear. We  
do know that by the end of the 14th  
century pressures that would lead  

to the Reformation were mounting.  
For whatever reason, by the 15th  

century, the Church had decided that  

witchcraft was a threat to orthodoxy.  
By the end of the century the Pope,  
Innocent VIII, was issuing papal  
bulls, empowering his representa-  
tives to try witches.  

One of his representatives, Jacob  
Springer and Heinrich Kramer, sent  
to try witches in Germany, produced  
Christendom's guide on the theory  
and identification of witches, Mal-  
leus Maleficarum or Hammer of Witches.  
As you can see from the passage  
quoted at the beginning of this  
article, these two were obsessed with  
the witch's sexuality, especially  
the sexuality of the female witches.  
(Was celibacy getting to them?)  

The book also noted witches’ healing  
powers and warned of their knowledge  
of contraception and abortion pro-  
cedures.  

changing men into beasts  
"Now there are, as it is said in the  
Papal Bull, seven methods by which  
they infect with witchcraft the  
venereal act and the conception of  
the womb: First, by inclining the  
minds of men to inordinate passion;  
second, by obstructing their genera-  
tive force; third, by removing the  
members accommodated to that act;  
fourth, by changing men into beasts  
by their magic act; fifth, by de-  
stroying the generative force in  
women; sixth, by procuring abortion;  
seventh, by offering children to the  
devils, besides other animals and  
the fruits of the earth with which  
they work harm."  

Terrifying as these powers were, I  
wonder if women saw all of them in  
quite the same evil light that the  
two priests did.  

The persecution of witches in this  
country has a short and a somewhat  
less sordid history. The first  

witchcraft trial in the English colo-  

nies for which we have records, oc-  
curred in Windsor, Connecticut in  
1647. During the next fifty years,  
there were a total of about one  
hundred cases out of which thirty-  
eight persons were convicted and  
hanged (not burned). The notorious  
Salem witch trials were different  
from the earlier ones. Occurring at  
the tail end of the witch craze in  
Europe they were examples not of  
isolated accusations and trials, but  
of mass hysteria in a backwater New  
England village. Early in 1692, a  
group of girls age 9 through 19  
accused a woman slave, Tituba, and  
two elderly poor women of having  
bewitched them, causing them to jerk  
and shriek. The slave was beaten in-  
to confession by her master. Those  
accused began to implicate others  
and confess to broomstick rides,  
witches' sabbaths, copulation with  
the devil and so on. By May when  
the governor arrived from Boston,  
several dozen accused witches were  
awaiting trial. The governor ap-  

pointed a special court of laymen  
to try the accused.  

‘overwhelming’ evidence  

Records still exist of those trials.  
Take for example, the trial of one  
Susanna Martin. The evidence against  
Mistress Martin was overwhelming.  

Her fellow townsman, Bernard Eache,  
testified that:  

"...being in bed on a Lord's Day  
night, he heard a scrambling at the  
window, whereat he then saw Susan-  
na Martin come in and jump down upon  
the floor. She took hold of this  
deponent's feet, and drawing his body  
up unto a heap, she lay upon him  
near two hours; in all which time he  
could neither speak nor stir."  

Another Salem resident, Robert Dow-  
ner, accused Mistress Martin of witch-  
craft and the following night:  

“as he lay in his bed, there came  
in at the window the likeness of a  
cat, which flew upon him, took  
fast hold of his throat, lay on him  
a considerable while, and almost  
killed him."  

And one William Brown further testi-  
fied that Susanna often appeared  
to his wife:  

"...giving her no little trouble;  
and when she did come, she was  
visited with birds that sorely  
pecked and pricked her; and some-  
times a bunch, like a pullet's egg,  
would rise in her throat, ready to  
choke her..."  

Traditional witch's powers with sexu-  
al overtones. Susanna, as you might  
expect, was found guilty and exe-  
cuted. When the Salem court ad-  
journed, some nineteen or twenty  
persons, mostly women, and two dogs,  
sex unclear, had been hanged.  

Why always women?  

The events in Salem Village have been  
attributed to any number of causes,  
"exhibitionism natural to young  
girls," the evils of Puritanism,  
the sociology of a small back-  
water village. But the question  

that interests me is not why witch-  
craft crazes, but why, throughout  
Western history, have the accused  
usually been women?  

To answer that question we have to go  
back, long before the Christian era.  
It is as if men have always seen  
women as a split person. From the  
earliest pre-history when the ferti-  
lity goddess was divided into the  
beneficent great mother and the  

dark, sexually dangerous earth mo-
