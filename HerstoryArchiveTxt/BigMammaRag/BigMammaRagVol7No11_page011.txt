Finding Our

Pat Greer

Sunday morning, peaceful, quiet  
and lonely  

And once again I search my soul,  
asking what is this for?  

Struggle with the longing for love  
and the quest for independence  

Fear of dependence, that word once  
again grabbing at my gut and causing  
me to ask myself what does it matter?  
What in hell does it matter if I am  
dependent on another human being?  
Oh it does though, it does matter. I  
have been depended upon and it's  
sometimes too much. I have no answers  
for you, dear woman, lovely sensitive  
woman who I'd like to save, yes I  
would  

I'd like to save you from a miser-  
able death on the highway smashed  
in your car. I'd like to save you  
from the sickness, the awful pain of  
dying an alcoholic. I've heard the  
stories of the swollen bodies, filled  
with fluid, the hardened livers and  
I cry. I can't stand it. I cannot  
stand to hear those wretched stories.  
I cannot stand to see you drinking  
and falling down, but I cannot help  
you up.  

I can help, but just a little.  

I can tell you that for me it is  
worth it to stop, I think. At least,  
I know what's happening to me. And  
sometimes, I have some control over  
my life. I know, the forces are  
sometimes too strong. The world is  
weird and cruel, hard, hard to live  
in. We're here for some reason  
though. I don't know what it is by  
any means. But we are here and we  
might as well experience it. We  
surely won't experience it well  
drunk.  

Last night in the bar I went to  
have a good time, to forget my re-  
sponsibilities for a while, to dance,  
to blend with the music for a time,  
to just have fun.  

I couldn't. I could not have fun  
while you were there, killing your-  
self in front of me. You could do  
it at home, where your friends would  
not have to watch. It makes me angry  
to see you give up. I wanted to go  
to you, shake you and make you stop  
it. But I was afraid of you. You're  
a large woman and I'm small. I hate  
being small, but maybe it's best that  
I am. If I was large, I may have just  
picked you up and carried you, ag-  
ainst your will, out of that place.  

I may have rescued you. But a res-  
cue is only good for a moment. It  
works better if we rescue ourselves,  
over and over, every damn day we  
have to do it. I know. It gets old.  
We get tired. I get tired. I am ti-  
red. Drained of what I think is e-  
very ounce of energy, every ounce  
of hope. Then, I stop and for a  

LUNA, Lesbians United To Nip Al-  
coholism/Drug Abuse, is a support  
group for lesbian substance abusers,  
their friends and lovers.  

A substance could be aspirin, mari-  
juana, alcohol, food, sugar, uppers  
or downers or any other thing which  
has a negative effect on a woman's  

te er ae  

ways, many of which are undefinable.  
To begin with, we meet each other. We  
find out we are not alone.  

There is a meeting each week where  
we come together to discuss and  
share common problems. Topics of  
discussion have ranged from how to  
deal with anger, pain and guilt to  
the physical aspects of addiction  
and how proper nutrition can aid in  
recovery.  

We believe that alcoholism and  
substance abuse is a feminist issue.  

life  
We support each other in numerous  

We see one of our roles in the com-  
munity as that of a viable force to  
raise consciousness, to increase  
awareness and sensitivity to the  
issue of substance abuse and the  
women whose lives are affected by it.  
It is a community responsibility  

Own  

moment, gaze at the bottles of beer  
in the 7-11 at two o'clock in the  
morning, or someone drops me off at  
home and I hesitate for a second be-  
fore climbing the stairs, almost  
turning around to visit the liquor  
store down the street. They are used  
to me coming in there to buy cigar-  
ettes, and an occasional ginger ale.  
But not liquor. They would look at  
me with surprise and I would feel  
the guilt before I ever got a taste  
of it. The guilt is the worst part  
of being an alcoholic.  

How could I drink and not feel  
guilty? Couldn't. Could not do it. I  
have to work hard at saving myself,  
you see, and I cannot save you. I am  
a strong woman, my strength is self-  
induced. You have as much as I do.  

What am I trying to say? What is  
my message? Invited to watch foot-  
ball down the street, invited to  
plays and lunches and demonstrations  
on a Sunday afternoon, But I cannot  
go. I have to stay here and write  
this damn thing. Compelled to bash  
out my anger on a typewriter on  
a beautiful fall afternoon. And an-  
ger it is. Anger that I am an alco-  
holic and that I cannot slip into  
a slightly drugged state when I need  
to rest. There is no such place as  
a slightly drugged state for me,  
because my body reacts differently  
than most people's bodies. I have to  
remind myself that my body is not  
just something I possess. It is me.  
The mind and the body are all mixed  
up with each other. So, I react to  
alcohol in a different way than most  
people. I am allergic to it, in a  
sense. That's one of those theories  
on the causes of alcoholism. There  
are hundreds of them.  

Exasperation.  

LUNA: The Politics Of Sobriety,  

to give active support to women who  
are struggling to attain healthy  
lives.  

There are many questions we need  
to ask ourselves, as women, as les-  
bians, as feminists. The following  
are just a few, a place to begin.  

-Do we use alcoholic drinks to  

attract people to our social e-  

vents?  

-Are a variety of non-alcoholic  
alternatives offered at social e-  
vents, including sugar-free healthy  
drinks?  

-How do we feel about drug sales in  
our community? Are we condoning it  
by looking the other way?  

-Do we ever ask where drugs come  
from and why are they so prevalent  
in our community and in other mi-  
nority groups?  

-How can we make the bars more re-  
ceptive to our needs? What role do  
they play in perpetuating alcoho-  
lism and drug abuse?

I do not want to get into them,  
but every woman who comes into LUNA  
asks that damn question.  

Why? Why me?  

We usually think we're crazy. It's  
us. Something sick about us. We think  
we somehow caused it. Not quite. As  
I think back over the last year I  
remember the stories, and the common  
themes. Abuse is one of them. We  
were many times abused as children.  
Hard topic. Vulnerable. I thought  
there had to be something wrong  
with me to be treated as I was as a  
child. Never talked about it much  
until recently.  

But we have begun to talk about it  
among ourselves now. And it is there  
in our lives, in the past of our  
lives.  

And we have begun to avoid abuse  
in our present lives. We have begun  
to say we won't take it any more.  

Snow begins falling, drifting down  
gently and the longing for a little  
peace, a little touching, some love,  
some intimate contact hits me. Sunday  
is hard, so hard sometimes. A thous-  
and losses crash in on me today. I  
wonder if I can remember if it snow-  
ed in Egypt. I don't think so.  

I'm so afraid of being dependent,  
that independence has almost become  
a dependency. How ridiculous, to over-  
compensate to such a degree.  

I should look up the word "depen-  
dency" in the dictionary but I really  
know what it means as it applies to  
my life. It means going too far. It's  
all on a continuum.  

We need other people. We are social  
beings. Isolate us and we die. But  
if we expect everything from every-  
one else, soon they will have nothing  
to give us.  

I am not doing what I'm supposed  
to be doing in this damn article.  

Someone has to speak out. Must it  
be me? Again?  

Drugs.  

Another hard part. I get little  
support for my position on drugs.  
I get an angry reaction when I say  
our group can be a force for change  
in this community. Somebody's got  
to be. I feel desperate when I  
bring this up. It scares me. The  
drug use scares me. People make so  

Dealing With  

Phy] Schechter  

I wake up alone. Big sigh. Life has  
been shitty lately. Seemingly imposs-  
ible medical bills. I am supposedly  
to receive unemployment checks, but  
as yet bills are my only mailbox  
visitors. I have been in training for  
almost a year for this Sunday's mara-  
thon, recently discovering I cannot  
run because my foot is infected. I  
figured the hell with it and have  
been smoking packs of cigarettes  
daily. I cough a lot, feeling very  
lousy about my body.  

I am not looking forward to another  
day of job hunting. I leave my house  
and notice the hood of my car is  
open. Not a good sign. Walking over,  
I see the grill is smashed and my  
battery is missing. I scream "Fuck!"  
at the top of my lungs, and beat my  
fists upon the air filter, breaking  
it beyond repair.  

Time to get drunk. I go back to my  
house and take out the bottle of wine  
I have been saving for a “special  
occasion." Something stops me.

much money selling drugs. They  

have quite an investment in drug  
users. And women sell drugs to wom-  
en. It's handing suicidal women a  
razor blade.  

But it's money that makes the dif-  
ference. I believe that. Cocaine  
costs a fortune. A small fortune for  
a twenty-minute high. Heavy or pro-  
longed use causes extensive damage  
to nasal passages and sinuses. How  
would you like a hole in your face?  

Innocent marijuana, another thing.  
I don't trust it. I've heard too many  
stories of overwhelming fear  
crashing in on women who use it.  

Not particularly heavy users either.  
When I've used it, my body has felt  
like lead, dull, weighted, heavy  
awful. Or not there at all. Just  
what I needed when I didn't really  
feel connected to my body to begin  
with. Then I had fun with it once.  
Just once. I would concentrate on  
sections of my body and feel strong  
pulsations, and be able to stop it  
and start it somewhere else. I've  
since learned to do that without  
drugs. To feel the energy within, to  
feel it surge and ebb, bringing it  
up from my toes up and up, very  
sensuous and exciting. All alone,  
just me and my energy. No pills, no  
joints, no hangover, no depression.  
I'm just beginning to feel my own  
strength. We all have it within us.  

Perhaps drug use doesn't seem so  
bad to most people because drug  
users aren't as loud as drunks. Real-  
ly. Women who are out on drugs are  
quiet. They just seem to go around  
in a mellow fog, and don't seem to  
bother anybody.  

Is killing ourselves quietly all  
right?  

I wish I'd just shut up sometimes.  
But I can't. I can't shut up. And  
I can't go back. Can't go back to  
pre-feminist days, or to an isolated  
existence with one person who gives  
me everything, and nothing. And I  
cannot go back to drinking.  

Dinner with a special woman. We  
feel grounded together, yet give  
each other permission, encouragement  
to fly. More than a friend, more than  
a lover, no words to describe our  
relationship. Perhaps we're enlight-  
ened. I laugh when I write that -  
enlightenment has always had such  
a serious reputation.  

Monday and the world is bright and  
crisp. It's all clean and fresh out  
there, the blinding whiteness of  
the day after the first snowfall.  
to finish. Somehow conclude. Can  
there be a happy ending, did you live  
through Saturday night, woman who I  
wanted to save? Pictures of others  
flash across my consciousness. If  
I only had an answer. If only I could  
say "stop" and you would listen. If  
somehow I could make it worth it for  
you to stop. But I can't. You'll  
have to find your own reason for  
living. And I can only hope that you  
will.  

Life Sober  

I am an alcoholic. For almost a  
year I have not had a drink. It has  
been extremely hard to stay sober at  
times, and I give myself a lot of  
credit for being strong enough to  
keep from drinking.  

But in the past year I have received  
very much support, encouragement,  
and love from my friends in LUNA. The  
understanding and concern I have re-  
ceived from these women has shown me  
that I am not alone in my struggles.  
We have helped each other through  
many crises. These women are my  
friends, and they care about what  
happens to me.  

There is comfort from a friend's  
hug that wine has never given me.  
And I have learned that being loved,  
understood and cared about does a  
lot more for my self-concept than  
a six-pack of Millers.  

I put away the wine. Tonight I  
will call my friends from LUNA. They  
will reassure me that I am a good  
person and that they are sorry that  
I am sad. Life will probably still be  
shitty tomorrow. But at least I know  
that I am not alone, and that I will  
probably deal with it sober.
