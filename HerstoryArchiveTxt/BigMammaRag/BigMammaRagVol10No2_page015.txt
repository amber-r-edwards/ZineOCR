Sporting events have tradi-
tionally been used by govern-
ments to create "feelings of
good will." Differences, we
are told, should be settled
on the playing field. Who
ever can run the fastest and
jump the highest is the best
person. When the U.S. decided
to open relations with China,
how did it change the image
of "the Red Chinese"? We sent
our best ping pong players to
compete. Not before or since
have ping pong games been
televised. Athletic "good
will diplomats" have been
touring for the U.S. and in
the U.S. for years, but this
past fall, when the Spring-
boks, the South African rugby
team, came they were met, not
by ABC Sports, but by demon-
strations and actions.

The Springboks tour started
in New Zealand in the summer.
In New Zealand, rugby, proba-
bly much like football is
here, is the religion. It is
election year there, and gov-
ernment officials, hoping to
win support in borderline
districts, more conservative
districts, scheduled most of
the games in these rural
areas, despite public opin-
ion polls indicating that the
majority of New Zealanders
did not want the South Afri-
can team to play in their
country.

When the Springboks arriv-
ed, they were met twice a
week by militant anti-racist
protests led by women. The
protests varied in militan-
cy, numbers and effective-
ness. Thousands of protest-
ers were arrested, many had
6 to 9 charges placed against
them. Many of those arrested
and hundreds of others suf-
fered bruises, broken noses
and broken bones from police
batons.

Two issues were pushed at
the demonstrations, opposi-
tion to apartheid and white
minority rule in South Afri-
ca, and to the racism in New
Zealand. On the team itself
are members of the South Af-
rican Police Force, members
of the Broederbond, an organ-
ization pledged to protect
white supremacy at all costs,
as well as two blacks to sup-
port their contention that
trials for the team are open
to all races.

The first game of the tour
was played at Gisborne, a
staunch pro-rugby stronghold,
and the protest was fairly
low-key. But at their next
game in Hamilton, the anti-
tour movement gained momentum.
300 people tore down a fence
surrounding the field, includ-
ing 2 women and a man who
drove through the fence in a
rented jeep. Protesters then
poured onto the field, scat-
tering glass and occupying
the field for over an hour,
forcing the cancellation of
the game. In reaction, the
government called in the Army
and Airforce to assist the
police in future games. The
remaining matches were played
in parks surrounded by coils
of high tensile barbed wire,
that, if cut, recoil and tear

the cutter to shreds, and
barricades of giant dumpsters
guarded by police and gangs
of white civilian "volun-
teers." Violence increased as
frustrated police brutally
attacked unarmed and peaceful
demonstrators.

Even now, after the tour is
over, the houses of black and
white women involved in the
demonstrations are being van-
dalized by these white "vol-
unteers." Blacks are still
being arrested for activities
undertaken during the tour.
And South African businessmen
have offered police involved
in guarding the tour and
their wives, all expense-paid
holidays in that country.

In the U.S., the team was
met by demonstrations at air-
ports, the locations of the
games being kept secret. Be-
cause of the anti-tour demon-
strations, the New York games
were cancelled and it took a
court order from the Supreme
Court for them to be resched-
uled. The headquarters of the

Eastern Rugby Union, who were
reportedly paid $70,000 to
sponsor the tour, was bombed
by the Black Liberation Army
in solidarity with the South
African people. Hundreds of
people took part in the pro-
tests organized by the Black
Coalition to Stop the Rugby
Tour and by Stop the Apar-
theid Rugby Tour (SART). Nine
people were arrested during
the tour (all SART members)
including four people who
were arrested on the streets,
hours before a large demon-
stration was scheduled. Charg-
es against two of them (ar-
rested for possession of fire
crackers and a minuscule a-
mount of marijuana) have since
been dropped.

While the Springbok tour
was not completely stopped,
it is unlikely that another
will come to New Zealand and
U.S. organizers will have to
think twice before they
bring another one here.

There were several differ-
ences and some not very sur-
prising similarities in the
anti-tour organizing done
in the U.S. and New Zealand.

What made the New Zealand
organizing different is that
the leadership was predomin-
antly made up of women.

There was massive participa-
tion of women in protest of
the tour. The numbers may
have been due to the popula-
rity of rugby in New Zealand.
Some of the women believe
the difference in numbers of
men and women came from the
fact that men still buy into
the "proof of worth" that
athletic competition carries
with ease.

The not very surprising
similarity in the anti-tour
organizing in both the U.S.
and New Zealand against the
diplomats of racist apartheid
South Africa is the organi-
zing was done by black groups.
In New Zealand, white lesbi-
ans reportedly joined in some
numbers under the leadership
of the black women's groups.
As Sena Tamanui, a Maori wo-
man pointed out in Broadsheet,
"But from the Tour I learned
that generally they're
(whites) too far behind.
They've got too many benefits
that get in the way of a
true commitment to justice. I
got sick of hearing whites
mouthing off about how they
don't have benefits and how
