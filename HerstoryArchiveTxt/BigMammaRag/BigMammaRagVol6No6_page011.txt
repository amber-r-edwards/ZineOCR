Letters  
from pg. 2  

It takes courage, it takes putting  
out for other people, it takes facing  
that being inside each of us is  
damn frightening to attempt to commun-  
icate with each other and after fail-  
ure, try again. But we need you! We  
need each other! Let's not let the  
revolution die because we can't see  
the end. Let's not let the oppressors  
fool us into believing we are lost be-  
cause we feel we can't talk to/learn  
from each other.  

It's not over! Diana's Grove is  
trying to put a panel together of womyn  
from all of the groups of Denver to  
talk about UNITY IN THE WOMYN'S MOVE-  
MENT. Woman to Woman Center will pre-  
sent another series of workshops.  

In education, in marriage, in every-  

thing, disappointment is the lot of  

women. I shake the business of  
my life to deeven this disappointment  
in every woman's life until she bows down  
to it no longer.

Olivia from pg. 8  

Lesbianism come out of hiding with pro-  
fessionally produced and quality  
music.  

One criticism of Olivia's effort,  
however, has been that out of eight  
albums, only one, The Poetry of Pat  
Parker and Judy Grahn, has taken  
the lesbian part of our lives and con-  
nected it to other issues around  
"being a woman in an oppressive socie-  
ty." When this criticism was raised at  
the workshop, it got lost in a leng-  
thy discussion as to how Olivia is  
only interested in recording lesbian  
artists at this time since lesbians  
have not had the same options of get-  
ting out their music as straight wo-  
men.  

Teresa and Jennifer cited how Olivia  
has helped to break down isolation  
among lesbians. They said that Olivia's  
music and concerts "seem to  
provide a part of a growing network  
in cultural communications that is  
really important. It's partly a re-  
sult of being able to share the music,  
but also the kinds of feeling or dis-  
cussions the music might evoke." Jen-  
nifer added that one way lesbians in  
the military have taken to discover-  
ing each other in such an oppressive  
situation is to ask each other if they  
have a Meg Christian album, which is  
safe and to the point.  

What had been visible to the women  
of Olivia, Jennifer said, is that  
“the music, whether concerts or re-  
cords, can be a really powerful poli-  
tical force in women's lives, in  
terms of radical personal change, as  
well as general energy." Unfortunately  
for the Denver community, it's been  
a pattern where after a concert most of  
us take our collective energy to the  
bars and dance it away, not to show  
our faces until the next concert or  
cultural event.  

Probably the most important consid-  
eration for any feminist group is  
how it chooses to operate internally.  
Teresa and Jennifer stressed that  
their collective/consensus structure  
is essential to the operation of  
Olivia; without a sound, workable  
structure, the production of records  
and the moving of money would come to  
a standstill. The work of the col-  
lective is divided so that one woman  
or group of women are responsible  
for a given area, such as packaging  
and shipping. Decision making on  
major questions is done by collective  
consensus.  

The composition of the Olivia col-  
lective has changed since its initial  
founding by five white, middle-class  
women. In four years, Olivia has  

grown to include fourteen women of  
differing class and racial back-  
grounds. Jennifer said that Olivia's  
decision to pay themselves a salary  
(from $450 to $600 a month depending  
on need) enabled them to change their  
class/race structure; she said that  
if a woman's group wants to be other  
than white and middle-class, the  
group has to provide monetary sup-  
port. Internally, Olivia is seriously  
tackling the problem of racism and  
has made a policy whereby no more  
white women will be allowed to join  
the collective until a true racial  
balance is achieved.  

It is obvious that Olivia has put  
a lot of careful thought and effort  
into their process and structure;  
few groups would be able to survive  
the pangs of growing in size from  
5 to 14 without substantial damage.  
Instead, a group that started out  
with a 45rpm now has a number of  
albums to choose from, with more  
planned for the future (Mary Watkins  
will be the next release); concerts  
that once drew 200 women are now  
only limited in size by auditorium  
capacity and ticket prices. Olivia  
has built up a distribution network  
of 85 women, and their albums are  
being sold in major record outlets;  
Olivia has moved its base to Oakland  
for, among other reasons, the pur-  
pose of purchasing a building in  
which to set up their own recording  
studio; and still has plans to fin-  
ance a newspaper of political analysis  
in conjunction with Diana Press and  
the Oakland Feminist Women's Clinic  
in the near future.  

At the workshop, Olivia was convinc-  
ing in showing how a small group of  
women can turn $1,000, a lot of hard  
work, and an idea for making lesbian  
music into a successful recording  
company committed to financial use-  
fulness and independence. I left the  
workshop uncertain as to how Olivia  
sees their future growth in connec-  
tion with making change for women,  
but Jennifer and Teresa did make it  
clear that Olivia will continue to  
come out with quality music that  
speaks to our needs as lesbians. Right  
now, however, if we want music that  
encompasses more of our experiences  
and struggles as women, we will have  
to look elsewhere.

Slavery  

incarcerated in forms of the gross repressive prison system is its policy. The authors want this  

book to be used to show the people of this country how it is for women behind bars, now, and to  

inspire us to change not only the intolerable conditions that characterize prisons, but the society  

that allows them to exist.  
All profits from the book go to the women who wrote it.
