Abortion |

Linda Fowler

Abortion is usually considered
outside the realm of econ-
omics, social class strata and na-
tional or international politics.
Yet, it is an issue relevant to the
oppression of women, both in-
dividually and as a class.

Legislating Guilt

The fight to secure a wo-
man’s right to make her own
choice about abortion has been a
long one with the decisive battle
having been won as late as 1972
in the U.S. Supreme Court (New
York state legalized abortion in
1970). Currently, this right is
threatened by attempts of right-
to-life groups to make abortion
illegal through a constitutional
amendment. While legal abor-
tion, itself, has yet to be re-
voked, these groups have been
able to push other oppressive
legislation through many state
legislatures. Such legislation
ranges from absurdities like a re-
cently amended Utah law which
required a woman to have the
consent of both parents and one
grandparent in order to secure
an abortion, to laws passed in
several states stipulating that a
woman, before being granted an
abortion, must be shown pic-
tures of a fetus at a stage of ges-
tation comparable to her own
and must have explained to her
how the fetus will be dismem-
bered during the abortion opera-
tion. The latter seems a punitive
law which makes a woman feel
she is personally and totally re-
sponsible for the abortion
methods the medical profession
has to date developed, as
well as for the pregnancy itself.
Statistics, however, show that of
all women seeking abortion, at
least 4 were utilizing a scien-
tifically proven means of birth
control at the time of concep-
tion. Hardly an irresponsible at-
titude. It is also proven that vir-
tually all pregnancies are the
result of sexual intercourse,
meaning there is at least one
other person involved in the
pregnancy. Yet, as in rape and
other acts perpetrated upon
women and for which they are
held responsible, women are
made to feel the responsibility
for both needing the abortion
and for its procedural methods.

Second Abortions

Women who have the misfor-
tune of needing a second abor-
tion at some point suffer the
added derogation of being
classified as repeaters, a term
laden with negative connota-
tions. Yet, the longer a woman
remains heterosexually active,
the higher are her chances of
needing a second abortion, re-
gardless of her faithfulness in
using birth control.

The “repeaters” issue has
formed one of the arguments
used by anti-abortion groups,
who stress that women are
using abortion as a method of
birth control rather than as a
back-up for it. Statistics, how-
ever, show that while the num-
ber of so-called repeaters has in-
creased in recent years, the rate
of second abortions has re-
mained constant, suggesting
that women do, in fact, use abor-
tion as a last resort method of
controlling pregnancy, not as a
primary method.

As the right-to-lifers increase
their push to have abortion
rights withdrawn, medical re-
search has still failed to develop
a birth control method that is
both safe and reliable. With
large numbers of women
switching to methods of birth
control other than the pill in
order to ensure their own health
we can expect a rise in second
abortions consistent with the in-
crease in unwanted pregnan-
cies. If past experience is an indi-
cator, the continuation of these
two trends could prove particu-
larly disastrous for minority and
working-class women.

Class Related Death

Prior to legalized abortion it
was these women, rarely able to
afford illegal abortions from a
private doctor, who received the
worst care and suffered the
highest rate of death from il-
legal abortions. They comprised
nearly the entire number of the
41 deaths per 10,000 live births
attributed to abortion in New
York in 1965, before the opera-
tion became legal. That number
dropped to 0 in 1975 (deaths
from illegal abortions).

Under legalized abortion,
these same women draw an un-
intended benefit from their cul-
tural and class situation. While
abortions are now available
through abortion clinics, hos-
pitals or private doctors, it is gen-
erally recognized that clinics
provide the best services. Most
of them offer not only the abor-
tion itself, but education about
birth control and abortion and
follow-up services as well.
These last two aspects are lack-
ing in most hospital and private
abortions. Because clinics offer
the cheapest abortions, lower
income women are more likely
to utilize these facilities and,
thus, receive the best care avail-
able.

Yet even in this setting there is
little recognition of the needs of
particular ethnic groups. Chi-
canas, for example, because of
the strong influence of the
Catholic Church in their lives,
need different types of educa-
tion and follow-up services than
do most Anglo women. They
rarely get them.

Societal Benefits

One interesting and desirable
side effect of legal abortion is
that more children from minor-
ity backgrounds, as well as older
children, are being adopted now
since there are fewer young,
white Anglo babies available.
This is saving large numbers of
children from spending their
entire formative years in the
rather impersonal surround-
ings of most orphanages.

The infant mortality rate, too,
is down, presumably because
more women who are having
babies are doing so out of a
desire to be parents. They do not,
then, abuse their children.

Yet, for all the arguments in
favor of abortion, there is still
disagreement over whether or
not welfare Medicaid funds can
be used for this purpose. With-
holding these funds for such
operations appears to be an-
other punitive measure, intend-
ed to punish women who be-
come pregnant outside of
marriage. Such rules, of course,
only tie women more closely to
welfare assistance and are a
clear violation of constitutionally
assured freedoms.

On a world-wide level, and
among minority groups, an argu-
ment has raged for some time
around the issue of abortion; its
relationship to capitalism and its
use as a weapon of genocide.
The unresolved argument is des-
tined to remain that way as long
as it is considered outside the

larger question of population
control as a whole.

Population control, of which
abortion is one part, is a means
of leverage whereby capital in-
terests attempt to regulate the
number of available workers,
producing sometimes more and
sometimes less workers, de-
pending upon what is needed to
maintain maximum profits for
business; it is not utilized purely
in a racist manner but as an
economic tool. Moreover, it can
be convincingly argued that it is
illegal abortions, not legal ones,
that are genocidal as more
minority women died from il-
legal abortions than die now
from the operation when legally
performed.

Accordingly, the law that U.S.
AID money cannot be used for
abortion is a mixed blessing.
While it limits capitalist mani-
pulation, it denies women con-
trol of their own lives and bodies
in countries receiving the funds.

The oppressive socio/econ-
omic and political conditions of
women, both individually and as
a group, appear to be tied in di-
rect inverse proportion to her
freedom to control her own re-
productive activity. To date most
advocate abortion work and re-
search has centered around only
the personal aspects of the
dynamic, while attempts to im-
plement repressive measures
have been launched by male
controlled profit-oriented inter-
ests. If this key freedom for
women is to be maintained and
expanded, support groups must
develop a focus that retains, yet
goes far beyond, the concerns of
personal rights to choose.

Germaine Greer Speaks on Women and Fertility: Facts & Myths

Cheryl Peake

Germaine Greer, Australian-
born feminist and author of The
Female Eunuch, appeared in
Boulder March 9 to speak at the
University of Colorado. Though
the event had been publicized for
only a few days, 1,200 people

turned out to hear her speak on —

she characterized as “monsters
of fertility”, having 7,999,999
more sperm per ejaculation than
is necessary. She also noted that
no one is mourning this “sac-
rilegious waste of life.”

Hyperfertile males — their
capacity to reproduce is less
often involved fighting and other
aggressive acts.

Ms. Greer speculated about
the possibility of sperm banks or
of “rewarding some men” by let-
ting them mate with several
women. This could cause an
erosion of men’s traditional re-
productive rights, and men
might have to entreat and
negotiate with women to have
children.

Ms. Greer added, however,
that she is “not in favor of les-
bianism as a method of birth
control, that is hardly fair to our
straight sisters.”

Women are not hyperfertile,
as they release only one egg
each month. Ms. Greer laugh-
ingly asked us to imagine right
then what it would sound like if
we could hear the constant
process of spermatogenesis
going on in the room. Yet men
are not slowed down by this con-
stant task of producing sperm
while myth has it that women’s
energies are greatly depleted by
the release of one egg each
month.

Ignorance

She also pointed out how
much ignorance and suppres-
sion still attends women’s sex-
uality, with the clitoris left out of
many classroom anatomy les-
sons because it is a sexual, and
not a reproductive organ. She
also mentioned women’s lack of
knowledge about our own
cycles.

Ms. Greer posed the question
of why, when women have such
relatively low levels of fertility,
doctors try to control it with sys-
temic medicines which affect
the entire endocrine system. The
death rate for women over 40 on
the pill is five times higher than
for those not on the pill. She
cited some of the many dele-
terious effects of birth control
pills, such as fever bumps, hair
and skin changes, the possi-
bility of thrombosis and in-
creased occurrence of pelvic in-
flammatory disease.

Ms. Greer expressed dismay
and horror at this method of con-
traception, which introduces
grave dangers for many women.
There is now clinical evidence,
for example, of infertility in
young women who began taking
the pill in their teens.

The audience was exhorted to
use our power to confront the
drug industry. For example, al-
though some sequential pills
have been removed from the
market because they are hazar-
dous, their manufacturers have
not been confronted; no women
have brought class action suits
for damages.

Mrs. Greer also urged her lis-
teners to apply pressure for
more research in this field. “It is
amazing,” she said, “how little
effort is directed to solving the
contraceptive problem, and the
problem is not that great.”

Abortants

Ms. Greer went on to speak
about other forms of birth con-
trol: diaphragms, condoms,
coitus interruptus and intra-
uterine devices, the latter which
she discussed at some length.
IUDs cause “mini-abortions”,
since they do not prevent the fer-
tilization of the egg but rather its
