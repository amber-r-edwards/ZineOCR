Attitudes on Sexual

‘The Absolute World of Men’

Christine Soliz

I had not given much considera-
tion to the crime of rape before. I
knew it happened a lot to some
percentage of women but I'd
thought of rape only as forced
sex committed by men who just
weren't cool about getting some.
But rape is not primarily a sex
crime: prostitutes and women
who are into sex indiscriminately
also get raped, and they experience
the same crisis other rape victims do. The
act itself is of secondary importance
to both the victim and the
attacker: the victim's fear is for
her life — for her it's a life or
death situation. People working
in the rape crisis programs in
Denver say that the primary
reaction of the rape victim is
terror, a compelling fear that she
will not escape alive. And the
terror remains with her long
afterward.

Professor Meachim Amir in
Patterns of Forcible Rape states
that the rapist is usually a
psychologically normal male and
he is not driven by an overpowering
need for sex. He's just some dork
who found an easy mark. People
are always looking for easy marks
and women are easy. We're always
getting fucked over and the crime
of rape is a literal example of that. When a
rape occurs, it isn’t something
that happens to just one woman,
or a percentage of women, but it
is a brutal reminder of what is
happening to all women in
almost all aspects of their lives.
Katherine Ellison and Morton
Bard in their joint presentation
“Crisis Intervention and Investigation of Forcible Rape” say
that “in the crime of rape, the
victim is not only deprived of
autonomy and control, experiencing
manipulation and often injury to the envelope of the self (as in burglary or robbery), but also intrusion of inner space, the most sacred and most private repository of the self. It does not matter which bodily orifice is breached. Symbolically they have... the asexual significance that forceful access has been provided into the innermost source of ego.”

Defined in Terms of Sex

Most women have to suffer
daily intrusions into their innermost source of ego. We are
prepared to be victims. Men
define us in terms of sex. Our
culture is controlled by men and
the majority of men’s compelling
interest in women is sex.
“Women are alienated from the
core of business, politics, the
academe, the arts. Our ex-
istence in society is validated by
men and our most assured
entree is by sex. We know this
intuitively as it is the strongest
reinforcement we receive
throughout our lives. By and
large, women are useful mainly
in the sense they can provide
covert or overt sexual titillation, a
diversion for man from his
competitive world. Depending
upon our degree of alienation and
our threshold for tolerating
alienation, we often succumb to
this one sure access always
open to us. And we defer to men:
it's part of the sexual role. We
depend on men, financially to
feed us, physically to protect us.
We are socially pressured into
using men’s names, men control
our relationships with other
men. Women do not live as auto-
nomous human beings. And as
Andrea Medea and Kathleen
Thompson say in Against Rape,
“it is time for women to take
their lives into their own hands
and start fighting for self-
respect, not only because that is
the best way for any human
being to live, but also because to
live any other way is damned
dangerous. Women accept too
many things as simply ‘the way
things are.’ The condition of
their lives has become in-
tolerable. All the daily en-
croachments on their existence
as human beings, whether sub-
tle or blatant, prepare them to be
victims of rape.”

Judicial Treatment

The crime of rape is the
second most frequently com-
mitted crime in the U.S. When
you consider it is a crime com-
mitted solely against women,
and that (by conservative es-
timates) half of all rapes com-
mitted go unreported, it
warrants serious concern and
action on the part of local
communities. In Denver, up to
August this year, between 300
and 400 rapes have been
reported to the police. Reported
rapes have averaged over 500
per year. Because of these
alarming figures and because of
nationwide depressing attitudes
toward rape victims (as Melanie
Crossley, former North Virginia
NOW President was quoted in
the Washingtonian, ‘our
society's approach to rape is to
lock up the victims.’) Feminists
have seen the necessity in
agitating for changes in com-
munity responsiveness to rape
victims. As a result of legislative
action the state of Colorado will

Federal regulations scheduled
to have taken place on October 1
could have jeopardized day care
for 4,000 Colorado children, and
526,000 nationwide. At a
meeting on 26th of September
the State Board of Social Ser-
vices passed a resolution asking
the US Department of Health,
Education and Welfare for a 120
day extension in implementa-
tion. The standards were not yet
enforced pending a hearing in
Baton Rouge, La. where a suit
was filed claiming the guide-
lines will force many centers to
close.

The issue surrounds staffing
standards called for in Title XX of
the Social Security Act. Present
standards call for a 1-7 staff-
child ratio in centers accepting
children on public assistance
between the ages of 2½ and 3
years. The new regulations
would require a 1-4 staff-child
ratio. In the age group of 4 to 5
years old the ratio would be
changed from 1-10 to 1-7.

In addition, day care home
supervisors who previously
could take 6 or fewer school
children counting their own pre-
schoolers, must now include
their own children under the age
of 14.

Restricted to Private Pay

According to Twyla Boe, day
care consultant with the De-
partment of Social Services,
“many homes have informed the
department that they cannot
continue to serve county child-
ren if their own school-age
children must be counted in the
maximum number of children
that can receive care.”

refer to rape as sexual assault,
which presumably indicates a
more enlightened attitude —
rape just got a little too heavy to
deal with so they hit us with
some new words. The revised
statutes prevent the courts from
any type of Lord Hale instruc-
tions to the juries, i.e. that the
charge of rape is easy to make
but difficult to defend against.
Also it will be more difficult to
present a victim's prior sexual
conduct as evidence.

But still it can be presented as
evidence if after an evidentiary
hearing the court decides it is
“relevant to the victim's
credibility and is not so pre-
judicial as to be inadmissible . .
prescribing the nature of the
questions to be permitted.” Judy
Nagaris, psychologist at High
Street Rape Crisis Center, says
Dale Tooley, District Attorney,
was instrumental in instituting
these revisions. She feels they
are a plus factor for the victim
and will ease the hassle victims
are subjected to in the court-
room.

The break-down in the judicial
system is the major concern of
most of those involved in the rape
programs. The major complaint
of the victim is that their cases
are not being prosecuted. “The
courts have a backlog,” Nagaris
says, “and apparently rape is
low priority in terms of most
cases going to court.”

Solicit Private Attorneys

The victim is frequently
forgotten through the ordeal of
the trial. The DA might not be as
sympathetic or as helpful as a
private attorney might be. A
victim often is not aware of her
rights. She is not familiar with
the theatrics of the courtroom
(as Detective Henry Potter of Sex
Detail calls it). A private attorney
would make her less vulnerable
to intimidation by defense at-
torneys, and would inform her of
what she has to do and what she
doesn't have to do.

Hanna Evans, clinical psy-
chologist at Gilpin House, cites a
case where a defense attorney
recently tried to coerce a rape
victim into giving him a state-
ment. This particular victim
wasn't aware of her rights and
was unable to obtain advice
about it from the DA's office.
Perhaps it would be wiser for
rape victims to solicit private
attorneys, and, in prosecuting
their cases, request
remunerative damages from the
defendant. Nagaris is interested
in locating attorneys who would
be interested in providing legal
assistance and direction to rape
victims. One woman who was
assaulted by a repeater is in-
terested in suing the state for
damages. Evans suggested that
possibly the Colorado Women’s
Lawyers Guild could take the
initiative in forming a pool of
lawyers to be made available on
a rotating basis to rape victims.

Exactly what percentage of
cases are actually prosecuted is
unknown. People at the crisis
centers are leery of statistics
coming out of the DA‘s office.
Evans says, “I don’t know of one
hitchhiking case which has been
prosecuted, yet the DA claims
they've prosecuted hitchhiking
cases.” An examination of arrest
statistics of the Denver Police
Force The Crime of Rape in
Denver by Thomas A. Giancinti
and Claus Tjaden, indicate that
at least 49% of those rapes
which are reported become “in-
active not cleared.”

Recidivism

Because of the high rate of
recidivism in rape, a necessary
factor in controlling the rate of
recidivism is to report the crime.
Officer Don E. Lindley who is
writing his master's thesis on
rape reported that “One man
raped five women, but only one
of them contacted the police. In
another case, the man who was
arrested for the rape of a woman
in an apartment house confided
that he had also raped a woman
in an adjacent apartment the
very same evening. This rape
was not reported to the police.”
Rapists are reinforced by crimes
they commit which go un-
reported. Law enforcers across
the country are realizing more
and more that unreported
crimes are reinforcement to
offenders and police appear to
be making more of an effort to
encourage victims to report
crimes: hopefully this includes
not hassling the victim to the
point where she is made to feel
like the offender, as is frequently
the case with rape victims. The
rape crisis centers report that
the detectives in Denver Sex
Detail are sensitized to the
needs of the rape victim. They
display a professional and con-
cerned approach in handling
victims and are cooperative in
dealing with the rape crisis
centers. It seems as though
every effort is made to ac-
commodate the rape victim in that
respect. The beat cops, though,
lack the training of the detec-
tives and as one officer said, it
doesn't matter what you tell the
guy, he still lacks the exper-
ience of a face-to-face confron-
tation, soon his first rape call he
may be a little cool or guarded,
but he’s just trying to remain
objective.

point.” According to Senator
James Buckley, C-NY, “Just
about every authority in child
care insists that the new ratios
are required to avoid damage to
children.”

Costs of day care then under
the new federal regulations
would be driven out of the range
of the government and of the
mothers who pay part of the
cost. In avoiding “damage to the
children,” centers will become
economically unfeasible to
operate.

Delay

A bill was passed in the US
House of Representatives call-
ing for a postponement of the
standards until April 1, 1976.
The bill was sent to the Senate
where a one month extension till
1 November was granted and
the bill was put in conference.

If the waiver is not granted and
even if the regulations go into
effect in six months, the state
may have to develop its own
facilities and in the words of Ms.
Boe, “that’s the saddest thing of
all. Our children would be seg-
regated.”
