Betty Marler is a member of  
the Colorado Coalition of  
Women in the Criminal Justice  
System. She is the Director of  
The Teacher Corps Project, a  
program which trains teachers  
and counselors, primarily ex-  
offenders, for troubled youth.  

BMR: Do you see the problems  
you face in the criminal justice  
system as sexist in nature?  
BM: 50% at least. There are  
some laws that are definitely  
sexist. It starts with young girls  
and involves status offenses,  
such things as promiscuity.  
BMR: That a boy would not be  
incarcerated for?  

BM: Right. 70% of the  
youngsters who are incarcerated  
for status offenses, offenses that  
aren’t considered breaking the law, are women. In  
the case of prostitution, women  
are generally prosecuted  
whether the men involved are or  
not. The other factor concerning  
women is that they're such a  
small population, they're sort of  
pushed aside and ignored. We  
say we can't afford to spend  
money on programs for them  
because there are so few, 70 as  
opposed to three thousand male  
prisoners.  

There are many laws  
that exist against wo-  
men that don’t exist  
against men, such as  
prostitution. No one  
pays attention to that.  

BMR: Are most, if not all, crimes  
committed by women related to  
their subordinate economic  
position in society?  

BM: The majority of crimes  
committed by women and men  
are economic. Some people  
have placed it as high as 90%.  
I'm a firm believer that women  
and men in the penitentiary have  
been victimized by the economic  
system. Women are even more  
victimized because they tend to  
have had less training, less  
education, and less of a job  
history. Incarcerated people are  
at the bottom economically and  
the women are a notch lower  
than the men.  

BMR: Aren't women’s crimes  
more apt to be related to  
economics than men’s? For  
instance, men are more apt to  
also commit other kinds of  
crime, like violent crime?  
BM: Prosecution and conviction  
for rape is relatively rare. There  
are rapists in penitentiaries but  

compared to the number who  
commit rape, the conviction rate  
is fairly low.  

As a group, women tend not to  
be violent in their economic  
crimes. Burglary, for instance, is  
a high impact crime in Denver,  
but it’s unlikely to be women  
doing that. Women are more apt  
to be writing bad checks and  
involved in forgery. As a  
feminist, I'm closely aligned with  
the plight of women. They face  
problems that men don't face.  

One other thing in terms of  
violent offenders, a large  
number of women in peniten-  
tiaries are there for drug-related  
offenses. They need money to  
support their habit and they end  
up having great dependencies  
upon drugs or men. Socially,  
they've been programmed for that.  
Some female offenders have  
wiped out a husband or lover  
who's been abusive; oftentimes  
that’s the most assertive thing  
they've done in their lives. The  
fact that they receive life  
sentences, double-life  
sentences, is unfortunate  
because the chances are they  
will never commit that offense  

again. But, we don’t have  
research on that and that is the  
point; women haven't been  
considered important enough to  
warrant good, consistent  
research.  

We do know from men who've  
committed that kind of crime,  
murdered their wives or lovers in  
an emotional outburst, that  
they're the best bet to put back in  
the community. They have the  
lowest recidivism rate and they  
don't have a criminal lifestyle or  
behavioral background. We can  
probably say that the same will  
be true of women.  

BMR: Can you say something  
about the dynamic of child  
abuse?  

BM: It’s my understanding that  
given economic problems, given  
marital or family problems, or a  
certain combination of en-  
vironmental problems together,  
people strike back at their  
children. Children are usually  
around and they're the most  
helpless.  

Women in this state who get  
involved with extreme child  
abuse, let’s say murder their  
children, usually end up at the  
state hospital. I think that’s an  
important thing to keep in mind  
as we look at low-income people  
who are incarcerated. The ma-  
jority are men. However, the  
powerless people without  
economic resources who end up  
incarcerated in mental in-  
stitutions are women, in large  
numbers.  

That's really where we put our  
so-called female offender. We  
put them in mental institutions  
for not fitting. If a man murdered  
his child, he'd end up at the  
penitentiary.  

When a woman does abuse a  
child; yes, I think it’s economic.  
She’s caught up in a system that  
leaves her frustrated, that  
makes her angry, that leaves  
her, often, head of a household  
alone, without training, educa-  
tion, or employment resources.  
BMR: What's the rationale  
behind men going to jail and  
women going to mental in-  
stitutions?  
BM: I think it goes back to the  
idea that women need to be  
taken care of, that they're like  
children (that they're not  
responsible for their acts.) Yes.  
So, there is a stereotype that’s  
taken women to mental in-  
stitutions and men to prisons.  
Those who end up in either kind  
of institution are powerless  
people and, unlike Watergate  
types, they can’t buy themselves  
out.  

The person to be con-  
cerned about is the wo-  
man in prison, not this  
individual or that  
group. The woman  
who is locked up is im-  
portant.  

BMR: What are some of the  
special concerns of women  
inside prison?  

BM: No one really pays attention  
to the tremendous concerns  
women behind bars have about  
their children. Now that’s not as  
intense for men.  

There are many laws that exist  
against women that don’t exist  
against men, such as prostitu-  
tion. No one pays attention to  
that.  

This state is just beginning to  
look at the needs for training and  
education for women.  
Historically, we haven't. That’s  
not to say that men get  
everything. In the penal system,  
they don’t get anything either.  
They get one iota more than  
women. Instead of no vocational  
training, men get to learn how to  
make license plates.  

BMR: Is the total abolition of the  
women’s prison justifiable?  
BM: Yes. The average sentence  
at the women’s prison is 14  
months. The majority of the  
women are incarcerated for  
non-violent crime. It's a small  
population, ranging anywhere  
from 65 to 85 women. That also  
includes homicides doing life  
sentences, often involving  
husbands or lovers, in what  
many instances could be termed  
an act of self-defense.  

Women can be in halfway  
houses or community correc-  
tions facilities. They could con-  
tinue to spend portions of their  
day with their family, could be in  
jobs or job training, in  
educational programs; yet living  
in a situation where there’s  
some supervision until they're  
strong enough to take direction  
of their own lives and until the  
state has gotten whatever it  
considers the punishment it  
wants.  

When you have women ser-  
ving so little time in an institu-  
tion, where the crimes are non-  
violent and often drug-related,  
they need some support systems  
rather than punishment. There’s  
no need for a women’s peniten-  
tiary in this state.  

BMR: How does prison harm  
women as opposed to doing  
them any good?  

BM: When you put anyone in a  
cage, anywhere from 9 to 14  
months and treat them like an  
animal, they're not going to  
come out whole people. One  
thing you can be sure of, they'll  
come out no differently than  

when they went in, and in most  
instances, they'll come out  
worse.  

BMR: They'll come out less  
independent than they were on  
the outside?  

BM: Sure. Women particularly,  
at the women’s prison, are  
treated like little girls. Up until  
two years ago, they were even  
called girls. (If you're fifty, you're  
still a girl?) Right. It fosters the  
whole attitude of, we'll protect  
you, we'll take care of you, we'll  
remove you from society and  
make you behave like a lady and  
then we'll turn you back.  

The environment in which this  
is done is a rural environment  
with a staff from Canyon City.  
The majority of the prisoners are  
from urban environments. So,  
there’s no meshing of values. It  
does do harm. Women come out  
with less resources than when  
they went in.  

BMR: So what a prison does is  
isolate people from their  
problems for a period of time and  
then return them to those  
problems less capable to deal  
with them than they were in the  
first place?  

BM: Right.  

BMR: How do Denver judges  
feel about alternative senten-  
cing and programs?  

BM: Because of recent legisla-  
tion, in the past couple years,  
people are really sentenced to  
the Division of Corrections. It can  
then decide the appropriate  
facility. The current Director of  
Corrections, Rudy San Phillippo,  
is a very strong supporter of  
community corrections. The  
bind he is in is money. The  
legislature hasn’t given him  
enough money to put as many  
people as are eligible into com-  
munity corrections.  

BMR: Can you say a little more  
about the Colorado Legislature  
and what it has and hasn’t done?  
BM: HB1445 was a bill in the  
last session to do away with the  
women's penitentiary. It was  
passed in the House and killed in  
the Senate. Senator McCormick  
said, in effect he said, if you do  
away with the women’s prison,  
you do away with jobs for my  
constituents. So it is an  

economic question.  

Strong advocates for  
community corrections who helped  
pass The Community Correc-  
tions Act a year and a half ago,  
and who helped sponsor the  
Woman's Bill, include Morgan  
Smith and Arie Taylor. Regis  
Groff was strong on the  
women’s bill. Regis Groff spon-  
sored it in the Senate. It was cut  
down by McCormick and the  
people he could muster, so the  
Senate is the stumbling block. It  
involves the power of Senator  
McCormick, who's been there  
years and years and represents  
Canyon City and its economic  
interests.  

There’s no need for a  
women’s penitentiary  
in this state.  

BMR: I would suppose, as far as  
the state's expenses are con-  
cerned, a few community-based  
programs would be more  
economically feasible than a big,  
prison system.  

BM: In the long run, community  
corrections is cheaper. It’s  
cheaper because the recidivism  
rate is smaller. It's cheaper in  
terms of maintenance. When  
you bring people out of prison in  
blocks of one hundred, you start  
cutting back on staff, food ex-  
penses and security expenses.  
But when you're bringing them  
out ten here, fifteen there, no,  
it’s more expensive. When com-  
munity corrections reaches a  
large scale, it's cheaper. And  
that’s not considering the  
hidden costs, the appeals, the  
legal costs, the court costs, the  
welfare costs for prisoners’  
families and foster home costs.  
For what we pay to have women  
locked up in a cage at the prison,  
we could have them down here  
in a training program and receiv-  
ing intensive psychiatric care.  
BMR: What litigation is pending  
against the women’s prison  
now?  

BM: There is a lawsuit dealing  
with equality being handled by  
the Lawyers Guild. They lack the  
economic resources to carry it  
through. But, if you win the lawsuit, what do you win? The women  
will get to learn to make license  
plates too.  

BMR: There are a few women  
prisoners who are employed,  
aren't there?  

BM: Yes. They get paid a  
ridiculous wage. I think the  
lowest is now 25 cents a day up  
to a dollar something a day.  
Probably, the most important  
change will come from public  
pressure to get women back into  
the community, rather than from  
lawsuits.

BMR: Can you give me a few  
examples of the ridiculous rules  
the women are under at the  
women’s prison?  

BM: Many of them have been  
eliminated since that lawsuit  
was started. One has to do with  
the kind of cigarettes they  
smoke. That's contraband  
(holding up long brown  
cigarette). They don’t look  
‘ladylike’. That's a rule that  
would never exist in the men’s  
prison.  

If you go to the men’s institu-  
tion, you will see the men do  
touch. They slap each other on  
the back, they shake hands, etc.  
Women are not to touch. It's a  
tremendous fear of lesbianism,  
which is an absurdity whether it  
exists or doesn’t exist.  

The fact is physical contact  
between human beings is im-  
portant. A few years ago, when  
the male prisoners heard about  
that restriction placed upon the  
women, they thought it was just  
bizarre. Men, who aren't  
generally touching people, who  
shy away and are very fearful of  
attacks of homosexuality, were  
overwhelmed.  

It may no longer be a rule, but  
the women are always under  
that sort of threat, that any sort  
of physical touch connotates a  
sexual act and is frowned upon,  
particularly in that situation,  
where the women are so  
isolated, that sense of caring  
that only a physical touch can  
communicate is needed.  

The powerless people  
without economic re-  
sources who end up in-  
carcerated in mental  
institutions are wo-  
men, in large num-  
bers.  

BMR: How do you feel about  
coed facilities? Do you think they  
would be more susceptible to  
sexist practices than a strictly  
women’s facility?  

BM: I think there’s a trend  
nationally to go towards coed  
facilities. I would hope Colorado  
would move very carefully. Ft.  
Logan will be the only study-  
release facility and it will be  
coed. One of the reasons is the  
physical structure. It was the  
first chance to have a place for  
women, period. The first con-  
cern was to allow women and  
men to have access to educa-  
tion.  

BMR: It's a practicality?  

BM: Yes. I also think whether a  
coed facility is appropriate  
depends on the individual.
