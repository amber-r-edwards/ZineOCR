LOOK!  
We're over halfway  
to our goal.  

For a long time we have experienced the need to be technically independent in order to be self-supporting and survive. Phototypesetting will be neater and more versatile, look better and cost less in the end than our current method. Ownership of this machine will also be an asset to the community at large both as a technological resource and as a money-generating project.  

In only a few months of active fundraising, two large donations and many, many small ones have boosted us past the halfway mark to our goal. You have a chance to make an important contribution towards reaching it.  

Make out a check from your income tax refund payable to Big Mama Rag, marked for the typesetting fund. Contact the office for tax-exempt donations. A special thanks to those women who have helped so far.
