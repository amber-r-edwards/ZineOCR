Boulder County Women’s Resource Center  
Who Should Run Women’s Centers?  

Cathy O'Malley & Carol Linsley  

Victory. After months of inter-  
nal struggle the Boulder County  
Women's Resource Center (BCWRC) has  
come to an agreement. Is it really  
a victory for the dissidents? "I  
feel sad," said one member about  
the mass resignations of six out of  
eight current members of the Board  
of Directors (BOD). "I know how  
hard those remaining Board members  
struggled and cared. They were the  
only ones who kept coming to meet-  
ings and talking, trying."  

The ongoing controversy within  
the BCWRC between the BOD and the  
general membership graphically il-  
lustrates the need to ask ourselves,  
“How should a women's center be run?”  
Is a traditional power structure ap-  
propriate to an organization serv-  
ing non-traditional needs? Or do we  
consider a more innovative structure  
with which to serve women?  

The conflict of the last 18 months  
points up the failure of traditional  
hierarchical structures. The result  
of this failure of structure has  
been to create feelings of aliena-  
tion, disenfranchisement, and anger  
in the membership who looked on the  
BCWRC both as the vehicle for re-  
lieving the distress of women, and  
as an agent of change in Boulder  
County.  

Hopeful Beginnings  

Founded in 1974, the BCWRC was  
modeled as an egalitarian non-tradi-  
tional organization. In its origi-  
nal by-laws, the Center was directed  
to serve the needs of low-income  
women, distressed women, minority  
women, and single heads-of-house-  
holds. It was recognized that con-  
flicts would arise in an organiza-  
tion serving diverse needs--from the  
most basic survival requirements to  
workshops on managerial skills. The  
commitment was shown at its incep-  
tion to meet the goals. The Center  
adopted a structure which recognized  
culturally diverse means of resolv-  
ing problems. The BOD was made up  
of representatives of diverse groups  
within the county. Equal salaries  
were paid to all staff members, in-  
cluding the Director. Staff and  
membership had direct input in the  
decision-making process of the  
Center.  

Creeping Hierarchy  

During 1977 the Center's struc-  
ture gradually changed as a result  
of a series of personnel decisions  
made by the BOD and the new Director.  
Central to these changes was the  
restructuring of salaries hierarchi-  
cally, including a nearly 50% raise  
for the Director. Staff members  
who had formerly made decisions  
about the granting of leaves and  
staffing patterns were no longer  
consulted. Strong staff sentiments  
on these issues were ignored by the  
Director and BOD.  

Centralism vs. Community Control  

Additional problems arose as wo-  
men who were working for the Center  
in Boulder County communities out-  
side the City of Boulder began to  
feel that neither the Director nor  
the BOD were being responsive to the  
needs of the women in their communi-  
ties. Conflicts arose about the  

appropriateness of services being  
provided in these out-county Centers.  
The Boulder City Center encouraged  
the branch offices to offer such  
programs as consciousness-raising,  
assertiveness training, and self-  
improvement, similar to those being  
offered in the City of Boulder.  
However, the staff people in  
Longmont and Lafayette felt that a  
priority should be given to the  
basic needs of food, shelter, cloth-  
ing, counseling, and protection.  
They felt that these needs had to  

be met before any of the other type  
of programming was started.  

Grievance Filed  

The apparent lack of responsive-  
ness to both the staff and community  
led to the filing of a grievance  
against the Director by six of the  
twelve staff members, including the  
Longmont and Lafayette staff people.  
The grievance charged poor manage-  
ment of both funds and staff. With-  
in three months of the grievance  
hearing, three of the grievants were  
laid off and one resigned. Seven  
members of the BOD, unable to work  
with the Center, resigned. The  
remaining two grievants were ef-  
fectively fired in October when the  
BOD voted to close the Longmont and  
Lafayette Centers.  

Sudden Service Cuts  

The closings came with only six  
hours notice, meaning that staff was  
not transferred and had no opportu-  
nity to seek other employment.  
Counselors were cut off from their  
clients without time to arrange for  
other services. This also eliminat-  
ed the only two remaining bilingual  
staff members. Longmont and  
Lafayette had warmly supported  
their Women's Resource Centers, and  
had been making great strides in  
dealing with the problems of their  
clients. The women in these cities  
were enraged by the Board's action.  

If the BOD thought that the clos-  
ing of the out-county branches would  
bring internal conflicts to an end  
they were mistaken. They severely  
underestimated the deep commitment  
of a large segment of the member-  
ship to having a Resource Center  
that serves ALL women.  

Community Pressures Board  

A group demanding county-wide  
services quickly formed and over a  
period of several months confronted  
the BOD at every opportunity. The  
Board took a defensive stance and  
continued having closed meetings in  
which they changed the by-laws so  
that membership input was effective-  
ly eliminated.  

In May, 1979 most members of the  
BOD finally resigned, making way for  
a new election. “The meaning of  
this new election," said one member  
"is that at least a Board can be  
elected which will hopefully be re-  
presentative and responsive to the  
needs of Boulder County women."  

The BOD and Director, by main-  
taining that there was no problem,  
and ignoring the membership's out-  
cry, illustrated how the traditional  
structure maintains its power.  

Other Boulder County human re-  
source agencies have been experienc-  
ing difficulties similar to those  
of the BCWRC. Human resource work-  
ers are frustrated at cutbacks and  
curtailment of outreach services.  
The question becomes one of whether  
those in power in human services  
should continue to make decisions  
about policies and programs for the  
communities or whether the communi-  
ties themselves should make those  
decisions.  

In making their wishes heard, the  
women who believed that the BCWRC  
was being poorly managed evolved a  
process of communication which  
encouraged and valued input from  
every member. Through the constant  
self-appraisal, reevaluation, and  
painful coming to grips with the  
questions of racism, classism and  
power, these women developed a com-  
mitment to the PROCESS OF CHANGE  
rather than its end results. Hope-  
fully this will be the spirit of  
the newly elected Board of Directors.  
With such a spirit, the BCWRC could  
move forward with new commitment to  
its original purpose of serving all  
women, using a structure that is  
innovative and celebrates the cul-  
tural diversity found in women's  
lives.  

Against BMR  

Big Mama Rag has been trying to  
get tax-exempt status for about six  
years. IRS denied tax-exempt status  
to BMR in October, 1974 and again in  
June, 1977. Judge John Sirica turn-  
ed us down again last month in the  
United States District Court.  

The BMR collective is of course  
disappointed with Sirica's opinion.  
We are encouraged, however, by the  
fact that he rejected all but one of  
the government's many arguments. The  
ruling rests exclusively on a finding  
that our paper does not contain a  
"full and fair exposition” of the  
relevant facts and that BMR "has a-  
dopted a stance that is so doctrin-  
aire" as to preclude exemption as an  
educational publication.  

We do not apologize for our edi-  
torial position; we take this oppor-  
tunity to reaffirm our goal of help-  
ing women take control of their lives  
and of their rightful places in soci-  
ety. We do deny, however, that BMR  
is doctrinaire. Our readers know  
that our letter page is always open.

LESBIAN  
MOTHERS  
UNITE!!  

Pandoura  

In late March a group of lesbian  
mothers got together for a rap.  
About five women showed up at that  
time. Many other women were inter-  
ested and since then about twelve  
other women have participated in the  
bi-monthly meetings.  

As a group we are in the process  
of defining our purpose and our  
focuses. We have already begun by  
including:  

--To act as a personal support  
group for each other.  

--To provide for our children con-  
tact with other lesbian mothers  
and their children.  

--To do fundraising for custody  
cases and public education.  

--To do public education by con-  
ducting workshops, obtaining &  
distributing valid information on  
lesbian mothers to courts,  
schools, medical and professional  
groups, and also by bringing  
films to town.  

Right now we are planning to  
bring the film, "In the Best Inter-  
est of the Children" to Denver. It  
is an excellent film about eight  
lesbian mothers and their children.  
The film is the only one of its kind  
that I know about. It was research-  
ed and produced by the Iris Films/  
Iris Feminist Collective, of L.A.  

We are planning to show the film on  

Friday, June 22 as part of the Gay  

Pride Week of events.  

(Please be on the lookout for  
the exact time and place via Woman  
to Woman Bookstore and the Gay  
Community Center of Colorado.)  

Some of the women in the group  
are currently involved in custody  
cases, while others are preparing  
for them. One woman in the group  
won custody of her four children  
here in Denver last year. (Yes,  
the court knew she was and is a  
lesbian.) A real, yet rare, victory.  

Individually and as a group we  
are painfully aware of the need for  
educating the public with honest,  
valid information about lesbian  
motherhood. One of those realities  
includes the knowledge that the  
legal system in which we must deal  
daily is homophobic, and thinks no-  
thing of separating our children  
from us.  

In our self-respect and strength  
we recognize that as lesbian women  
and mothers we are sharing a lot with  
our children and our community. We  
welcome more lesbian mothers and  
their friends, lovers and any other  
interested women to join us. We need  
each other to make this group an  
effective force and resource for  
ourselves and our entire community.  

Our meetings are every other  
Saturday between 2-4 p.m. at Woman to  
Woman Bookstore, 2023 E. Colfax Ave.  
Our next meeting, June 9th we've  
planned a visit to the Denver Zoo and  
picnic (Bag Lunch) for all mothers,  
children, and friends that want to  
come. We'll meet at the front gate  
of the zoo about 10:00 am. Join us!  

Also, anyone interested in doing  
childcare regularly or irregularly  
for our meetings, please check us  
out any Saturday. (And thanks to June  
for taking several of the young folks  
to the park during our last meeting.)
