Letters Home To Mama

Sagaris

Open Letter to the  
Feminist Community via  
Big Mama Rag:

Hysterical cries for unity are  
divisive in themselves. They  
leave no room for political  
struggle — writing off those who  
raise questions — attacking the  
integrity of the persons involved  
— leaving the real issues un-  
touched.

One third of the Sagaris Insti-  
tute, second session, disasso-  
ciated to form the “August 7th  
Survival Community.” We found  
ourselves involved in a process  
at an important time. We called  
for an accounting. We accepted  
the responsibility of political  
struggle, going against “the  
flow,” risking the goodwill of our  
sisters. It would have been more  
pleasant, but incorrect, to ignore  
the pattern of contradictions we  
had begun to see. We went on  
strike until we got some  
answers. We needed answers  
as to what kind of process we  
were involved in. We needed to  
know the politics of the Sagaris  
Collective. We needed to know  
what their idea of “independent  
institute” and “feminist” meant.

Independent of whom? And  
what kind of feminism? We  
wanted answers to what  
appeared to be a herstory of  
radical, working-class purgings  
from the Sagaris Collective. We  
wanted the politics of Ms. Cor-  
poration and Ms. Foundation  
clarified. We wanted to know if  

Sagaris Institute was indeed  
independent or merely an  
academic replica of Ms.’s  

classist, racist, sexist politics.  
We wanted to find out how  
woman-identified the vision of  
Sagaris was — hoping that it  
was not created to be properly  
co-optable.

Form and content are often  
confused (and too often, blend-  
ed). Many of us felt that when it  
came to Ms. that the “medium is  
the message.” The form of Ms. is  
high-class capitalism: ads full of  
women liberated from poverty —  
not sex roles. Many of us found it  
personally compromising to be  
associated with this kind of  
reformist politics, and realizing  
our powerlessness in the struc-  
ture of the Sagaris Institute,  
chose to disassociate ourselves  
from its mode of politics.

The patterns that developed  
were intricate and the implica-  
tions of accepting Ms. money,  
especially at a time when Gloria  
Steinem had for months chosen  
not to be answerable to the  

radical feminist community,  
were far-reaching.  
The issues raised by the  

“Sagaris Experience” are far  
more complex than can be gone  
into in a short letter to the editor  
in the already over-burdened,  
limited feminist press. As one  
individual, I kept a journal of the  
experience and have since been  
doing serious writing and study  
of issues raised at and through  
Sagaris. I am interested in a  
more complete sharing of the  
process.

We must not have our her-  
story written for us as our his-  
tory was written for us. Hope-  
fully, other members of the  
“August 7th Survival Community”  
will also make their insights  
available to the general femin-  
ist community. If you have  
written about “the split” and will  
share it with me, or wish to read  
what I have to share, write to  
Dorothychild, P.O. Box 662,  
Tallahassee, Florida 32301.  
Perhaps some real analysis can  
come out of this — perhaps a  
collection of serious political  

position papers. Perhaps “The  

Sagaris Papers” will not be the  
only recorded herstory of the  
summer's events.

If we want the feminist media  
to continue to exist/expand we  
must help make it happen.  
Recognizing that we cannot  
expect the “Big Mamas” to do it  
all for us without our help, I am  
enclosing $35 either as a dona-  
tion or to cover the cost of this  
letter as a classified. It is time,  
whenever possible, to put our  
money where our mouth is if we  
wish to establish and maintain  
truly “independent” feminist  
presses.

Joan Little  

Dear Carol,

Was upset by your article on  

Joan Little (Sept. BMR, ‘75). If  
the men in the Joan Little  
Defense Fund ignored the ques-  
tion of sexism, this doesn’t give  
white women in the feminist  
movement the right to ignore the  
issue of racism in the Little case.  
I feel like both the black move-  
ment and women's movement  
are trying to separate Joan Little  
in two parts, and that each  
movement is trying to claim its  
particular oppression is more  
important. Joan Little is not a  
piece of cake that can be divided  
up.

In your article you state that  
“rape is the way that men keep  
their dominance over women —  
how rape is to all women what  
lynching is/was to black men”  
and that “the act of rape, rather  
than some other form of brutal-  
ity is attributable to the basic  
obvious fact that Joan Little is a  
woman,” suggesting that the  
brutality of the rape was directed  
against Little primarily because  
she is a woman. True, only  
women can be raped by men, but  
rape has been used as a form of  
brutality by white men on black  
women to express racial hos-  
tility as well as sexual hostility.  
In your article the racist aspect of  
the rape seems very secondary.  
In your attempt to point out the  
importance of sexism in what  
happened to Joan Little, you  
seem to be dividing the issues of  
sex and race in the same way as  
those in the black community

who tried to make the rape pri-  
marily a race issue.

Your article also seemed to  
justify the lack of support for  
Joan Little from white feminists  
on the grounds that the Joan  
Little Defense Fund discouraged  
the participation and did not give  
white women “leadership” in the  
Defense Fund. If women empathize  
with Joan Little and are angry about  
what happened to her, we will give her  
whatever support we can,  
whether we have the support of  
the official Little Defense Fund  
or not. To use the sexist atti-  
tudes of the Little Defense Fund  
to rationalize our own failure to  
support Little seems pretty  
presumptuous.

Carol, I hope these comments  
will be taken in the sense in  
which they are meant. For all the  
fine articles you have written for  
BMR in the past and future,  
thank you.

Peg Hickox  

Carol Lease and BMR,

I thought your analysis of the  
Joan Little case (Sept. issue)  
was excellent, except your last  
statement left me dead cold.  
“Sexism is not an issue that  
builds a movement that is poli-  
tically beneficial to any man.”

This simply is not true. In fact,  
there is a strong, emerging  
movement of men in this country  
and Canada that is based very  
solidly on the issue of sexism in  
society, and of which feminist  
principles, including an anal-  
ysis of rape, are vital concerns.

Politically it may appear that  
because a man dominates his  
wife, or a man uses and abuses a  
woman sexually, or simply gets  
his rocks off by being a big  
cheese around the office, that  
this is a situation where the man  
gets the goods and the woman  
gets the bads. Surely women are  
oppressed by men, but in truth  
the pure exercise of power is not  
the end all. Not every man will go  
down fighting to protect his  
society granted right to domin-  
ate. In fact, the rewards of a re-  
lationship where one takes,  
steals, or coerces what they  
want from another stink like  
hell. There is no compassion and  
so in the end, the rapist, the  
boss, the husband, the tough  
never really get any love. Who  
says we should feel sorry for  
them? No way. But still this is  
where men who care about the  
quality of their own and  
women’s lives are coming from.  
Realizing that in our sexist  
society they too are being shown  
just a half a life, men are sick of  
the sexist garbage and pressure  
that keeps us competitive and  
corralled. Hearing what women  
are saying about their oppres-  
sion, and realizing that while  
women are oppressed in this  
world, we are all going to be  
short of the people power that  
we need for real social change,  
men are fighting back too. Men  
are getting together, in c-r  
groups, in day care groups, at  
conferences, in men’s publica-  
tions; men are speaking out  
against rape, sexist roles, and  
“male” privilege. Politically men  
have a lot to gain: taking back  

their lives again. Personal  
growth is a new political  
strength.

As the article pointed out,  
where the fuck were men like  
that at the Joan Little trial? There  
sure is a need for men in the left  
to deal with their sexism. If there  
were any anti-sexist men there  
they too got shoved aside.

The power is still held by men.  
Slick, liberal, politically correct  
sexist men are mighty impres-  
sive in the news media these  
days. Is there any wonder why  
those in power found it so easy  
to accept this recent “chal-  
lenge”?

Free our sisters/  
free our brothers,

Sisters;

I am writing to express my ap-  
preciation for the quality of your  
publication. I rarely get the op-  
portunity to read Big Mama Rag  
from front to back, but there are  
always one or two articles I find  
time to read. There was an  
article from “Media Report to  
Women” of August, 1975 (Vol.  
3A, No. 8) quoted in your column  
“News Around the Country”  
that I would take issue with. It  
was titled “Almost Seven to  
One” and said, “The White  
House News Photographic As-  
sociation has approximately 340  
members. Five of these are  
women. (You can guess what  
the rest are.)” Are they liber-  
ated or unliberated gay or  
straight men? Where and why  
are these photographers  
located? In what capacity: civ-  
ilian, governmental, military,  
free-lance, part or full-time  
White House employees? Are  
the parentheses yours or the  
Media Report's? Have more  
women tried to be hired to work  
for the Association and not suc-  
ceeded? The title of the article  
should be “Almost Fourteen to  
One” shouldn't it? It seems to  
me that printing what is appar-  
ently filler like this doesn’t help  
anyone. All that you are doing is  
producing empty statistics, and  
propagating the Washington  
politics/Watergate myths. Let's  
face it, the sooner we all stop  
encouraging myths, the sooner  
we will accomplish our goals.  
This should be an integral part of  
responsible journalism in my  
opinion.

We were sorry to hear about  
the vandalism of your office. If  
there is anything we can do, let  
us know.

Sincerely,  
Donald Ashley

News from London  
Dear Wood,

Remember me? It seems so far  
away from your tortilla pizzas . . .  
I only spent 24 hours in Denver  
but remember it all so well. How  
is Big Mama? You asked me if I'd  
like to send a letter from London  
about the movement here, and I  
shrieked with joy and said I'd try  
— and I'm trying!
