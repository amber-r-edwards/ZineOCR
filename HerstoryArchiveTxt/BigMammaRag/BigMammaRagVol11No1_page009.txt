Native Women WORK from place «

Even after a final DECISION
has been made, the right
to change their mind about a
given procedure still stands.

An accurate EXPLANATION
of everything the chosen pro-
cedure will involve. They
must know what to expect and
have a clear illustration of
the procedure.

All of the above steps
be DOCUMENTED on paper. Exa-
mine the person on the infor-
mation provided for them.
Have them sign it, have them
read it over. Remember that
education and counselling is
one of the most important
steps in the success of a
procedure.

At a recent conference on
Traditional Indian Mothering
and Infant Care held in Sac-
ramento, Calif., sponsored by
the Indian and Maternal and
Child Health Branch of the
California Department of
Health Services and by Eagle
Child, Indian Child and Family
Services Program, I facilita-
ted a workshop attended by
Dr. Geoffrey Woo-Ming, head
of the Indian Health Branch
of California and a professor
of medical ethics at Berkeley.
Dr. Woo-Ming was educated un-
der the British system of med-
icine. We had been discussing
the poor health status of mo-
thers and infants in Califor-
nia. Dr. Woo-Ming commented
that doctors come through
medical school today with
more interest in becoming
good technicians than with
dealing with their patients
on a human level. Their train-
ing, unless they get exposure
to a medical ethics course
like his, just doesn't teach
them to be compassionate hu-
man beings. So these techni-
cians come out of medical
school, and a few of them go
into the Indian community,
where there is a high rate of
staff turnover. How do we ed-
ucate these doctors to the
needs of the Indian people
they're supposed to serve?
They don't know anything a-
bout Indian culture. And more
important, they don't know
what traditional health al-
ternatives exist in the Indian
culture, so how can they give
clear, informed consent to In-
dian people when they don't
even know what their alter-
natives are?

The issue of informed con-
sent as it applies to the In-
dian culture is a very impor-

tant element in the provision
of real health care for the
Indian community. Let's look
at informed consent in its
broader applications.

Jackie Huber is a lawyer
who has worked in South Dak-
ota for the Lakota people
through WARN and the Black
Hills Alliance. She has been
closely involved in the study
on the radioactivity in the
water.

The tribe is being approach-
ed by all kinds of companies
that want to lease rights to
all their mineral resources.
They're not prepared for it.
They don't have natural re-
source agencies that are set
up to deal with the legal de-
cisions involved, the geolo-
gical decisions involved, the
water decisions involved. They
don't have the legal staff to
negotiate the lease, much
less control the problems
that develop afterwards with
the lease or whatever. There
is a real problem, but yet
here they are, a poor commun-
ity, needing resources, and
here's all this money being
offered, so what should they
do?

The Black Hills Alliance
has been trying, not to nec-
essarily say no to all devel-
opment, but to say look at
everything. Look at the envi-
ronment, look at health, look
at all of this before you
make your decisions. And let's
have some standards set up.

Informed consent for native
peoples requires that clear
alternatives be established
for whole communities which
are based on their indigenous
religious and cultural con-
text. That the woman is the
foundation and carrier of
life is central to Native
American thought. Therefore,
the integrity of our repro-
ductive power, and that of
all female life, including
the Earth, our Mother, is the
basis of our real health.
Sterilization abuse and the
ecological impact of indus-
trial development on the re-
productive health of Indian
communities cannot be under-
stood outside of the histori-
cal reality which makes these
most obvious threats to the
survival of the Indian gener-
ations tantamount to genocide.

But these are not the only
threats to our survival. And
it is up to us, the Indian
communities ourselves, to

provide solutions to these
problems.

In 1981, eight Attikamek-
Montagnais Indian children in
Northern Canada died after an
outbreak of gastroenteritis.
81 children were hospitalized
for severe diarrhea which led
to often fatal dehydration.
The infant mortality rate for
Canadian Indian babies, 37.7/
1,000 is more than double

that of Canada's general pop-
ulation, 15/1,000. Bottle-
feeding in poverty conditions,
lack of good water and sanita-
tion are responsible for these
alarming statistics.

On a Papago reservation in
southern Arizona, a community
of 10,000 native people, a
two-year effort to bring back
the traditional way of infant
feeding - breastfeeding - has
met with tremendous success.
The Papago Model Breastfeed-
ing Education Project began
after community health work-
ers became concerned about an
increasing trend in bottle-
feeding and a concurrent in-
crease in severe infant dia-
rrhea, increased susceptibil-
ity to otitis media (ear in-
fections) and dental problems
(nursing bottle mouth). Nutri-
tionists and health care pro-
viders felt that the health
problems the children were
suffering from were directly
related to the increase in

bottlefeeding. The project
was funded by a $68,000 grant
from the Dept. of Agriculture
and was facilitated by a joint
effort of the Papago Disease
Control program, Community
Health Representatives, Comm-
unity Health Nurses, Freedom
From Hunger Foundation, and
the Papago Nutrition Improve-
ment Program. Comprehensive
services provided by the Pa-
pago Model Breastfeeding Ed-
ucation Project included:

*Educational Workshops - held
in the community to educate
mothers and their families.

*Lactation counselors -
breastfeeding helpers trained
to offer advice and support
for the mother in her home
before and after the baby is
born.

*Training program - for all
medical and health staff in
the area of breastfeeding and
infant health.

*Breastfeeding nursery - for
babies from birth to six
months whose mothers are
working.

*Reservation-wide
survey - of current
and past infant feed-
ing practices.

Before the project started,
only 23 percent of new mothers
breastfed their babies. Pre-
sent statistics show that 87
percent of the reservation's
population supports breast-
feeding, and the number of
new nursing mothers had in-
creased by 20 to 44 percent.

According to the California
Urban Indian Health Council's
Survey on California Indian
Maternal and Child Health
Status, Indian women in the
prime of their reproductive
years, 15-34 years of age,
have a cirrhosis death rate
that is 37 times that for
white women of the same age.
Cirrhosis mortality for Indian
women is three times that for
non-Indian women. This also
suggests a high risk for Fetal
Alcohol Syndrome among the
offspring of Indian women.

Of the many problems Indian
women face today, alcoholism
is perhaps the most devasta-
ting. In itself, alcoholism
is a large topic and its in-
cidence in Indian country has
ravaged the generations. It
is a disease for which peoples
native to the Americas had no
physical or spiritual immun-
ity. Alcoholism is an illness
