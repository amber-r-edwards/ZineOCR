Mobilizes

Shecat

The Lesbian Task Force of  
NOW is alive, well, and  
growing newly-formed chapters state-  
wide. While Lesbians have  
always been a vital part of the  
women’s movement, our unique  
problems have not been  
dealt with on any large scale  
and our needs have not been  
articulated or acted upon in a  
positive manner. The purpose  
of the Lesbian Task Force,  
therefore, is to attack on all  
fronts the issues oppressing  
us as Lesbians.

Uplifted by the recent surge  
of energy in the Feminist  

unity; I decided to  

go to the  
first meeting of the  

newly-formed Task Force. I  
went out of a desire to find an  
appropriate way to channel  
energy into a forceful group. I  
definitely liked the sound of  
the words, “Task Force”  
--serious, positive, and po-  
tentially powerful.

I was far from disappointed.  
From among the 15 or so in  
attendance, I saw experience  
and inexperience, zealous-  
ness and caution, open  
activism, and the shyness of  
still being in the closet, but  
every woman there was there  
because she wanted to do  
something. We talked about a  
broad range of subjects that  
included legislation, educa-  
tion, politics, logistics, and  
tactics.

Right now, most of our  
energy is concentrated on  
gathering statewide support  
for a sweeping gay anti-dis-  
crimination package for the  
State legislature, and we have  
people working diligently  
contacting legislators, insti-  
tutions, every kind of contact  
it is possible to make, doing  
crash education where needed  
(which is almost everywhere).  
We also are gathering docu-  
mentation of discrimination  
for those liberal (and other)  
fools who keep saying “Show  
us a gay complaint.”

Other fronts of attack are to  
gain full Lesbian representa-  
tion on various commissions,  
such as the Commission on  
Community Relations and the  
Commission on the Status of  
Women. We have people  
pressuring religious, educa-  
tional, financial, and political  
institutions; some sisters are  
writing and developing edu-  
cational portfolios; some are  
working toward ending dis-  
crimination and harassment  
of Lesbians in prison; some  
are starting to coordinate a  
mail-order type of book  
service.

We are also supporting  
other Lesbian Task Forces in  
the state, as we are painfully  

in Denver and in  

aware that any significant  
changes in this state will have  
to come from all the outlying  
conservative areas and not  
just Denver alone.

Another issue in the Task  
Force is the importance of  
class consciousness. Clas-  
sism and elitism are issues  
that have not been dealt with  
satisfactorily in the women’s  
movement, and working class  
sisters are encouraged to  
express their anger in the  
hope that we will not in any  
way oppress each other by  
leftover attitudes from a sick  
society that has failed to  
achieve dignity and freedom  
for all.

Women in the Task Force  
have spontaneously formed  
special interest groups as  
they are needed. This process  
is remarkable to me, since I  
have seen many groups, even  
women’s groups, where the  
leadership is forced to accept  
the burden of responsibility.  
In the Task Force, it’s like we  
all are leaders, in a way. It’s  
more the fact of us all working  
together in harmony in a  
process of collective evolu-  
tion, rather than following any  
traditional form of getting  
things done. Every woman is  
given the dignity of leadership  
that otherwise would fall to  
just a few. Our energy has  
become synergistic, so that  
we grow as individuals at the  
same rate the groups grow.  
One of the best things that  
happens at our meetings as a  
result of our process, is that  
whenever we hit an issue we  
can’t agree on, a “brainstorm-  
ing effect” occurs, and we  
usually come up with some  
surprising alternative satis-  
factory to everyone and that  
no one individual would have  
thought of it alone.

Some of our dreams, I  
discovered, were far too  
utopian to be considered as  
current projects, like my own  
hope of creating a women’s  
center large enough in scope  
to provide a place where  
women could go to learn  
everything they are denied in  
our present culture. This kind  
of dream is an evolutionary  
one, and we decided in terms  
of practicality alone that for  
the present, we have to begin  
by an all-out attack on those  
elements of our society that  
most refuse to accept our  
existence. Only then will we  
be more free to build our  
dreams in peace.

In any case, I am enthusi-  
astic about the Lesbian Task  
Force and proud of what is  
happening as a result of our  
energy. Somehow I always  
knew that women’s love would  
be a conquering force, for-  
midable in the eyes of  
opposition. It is incredibly  
beautiful to see it working.

KOA-TV Agreement

Signed

Chocolate Waters

An agreement has finally  
been reached with KOA-TV  
and Radio concerning the  
station’s programming and  
personnel policies in regards  
to women and minorities. The  
agreement was signed on July  
31 between the station and  
four groups (NOW, Mass  
Media Task Force, Sundiate,  
Inc. and the Co. Com. on the  
Mass Media and the Spanish  
surnamed).

According to Virginia  
Woodard, a representative of  
the Mass Media Task Force,  
there will now be 12 specials  
per year on minorities and  
women. Two of these will be  
devoted to women, one to  
Native Americans, three to  
Blacks, and six to Chicanas.  
(The reason that there will be  
more specials about Chicanas  
is that KOA did not meet the  
standards of a pact signed in  
1971 regarding Chicana is-  
sues). There will also be more  
air space devoted to public  
service announcements about  
women and minorities.

Towards the end of the  
negotiations with KOA Ms.  
Woodard said that there was a  
split among the coalition  
membership concerning con-  
sultancy fees. (KOA will have  
a nine-member panel consist-  
ing of women and minorities  
who will make suggestions  
about programming). Both  
Channel 9 and 7 pay their  
consultants but KOA is  
offering instead a $2,000  
scholarship to an outstanding  
woman or minority. Ms.  
Woodard stated that “women  
and minorities have volun-  
teered their services for free  
for too long,” and added that  
“NOW has a very strong stand  
on volunteerism and will not  
back down on this issue.”

Ms. Woodard also urged  
people to continue to call and  
write KOA if they disagree  
with the station’s program-  
ming, or if interested in  
photography or writing for  
television concerning issues  
of interest to women and  
minorities should contact Ms.  
Woodard at 986-7430.

Proposal for CU Women’s Center In the Works

Jan Throndson

The “Women’s Crisis Center  
Project,” once a minor plan  
for a women’s rap-line, has  
mushroomed into a full-  
fledged proposal for initiation  
at the University of Colorado  
this fall.

Ideas for a self-defense  
program, a rap-line emphasiz-  
ing sexual assault and rape  
counseling, medical self-help  
programs, and legal counsel-  
ing are incorporated in the  
proposal.

Included in the plan to  
provide a central meeting  
place for university and  
community women, are a  
clearing house for women on  
other university campuses,  
officers for on-going women’s  
programs, a coffee house and  
consciousness-raising  
groups.

Linda Christopher, spokes-  
woman for the project, said  
that the proposal for the  
center has already been sub-  
mitted to the University Plan-  
ning Committee, “so maybe  
we can be allowed to move  
into a university house on  
1229 University.”

Even though the proposal  
has the approval of Roland  
Rautenstraus, acting Univer-  
sity president, she said that  
the Planning Committee is  
having a problem  
defining the project to fit its  
housing guidelines.

“Our proposal doesn’t ex-  
actly fit their housing guide-  
lines,” Christopher said,  
“We're bringing together a  
bunch of different activity  
groups under one center. . .  
we're not just one interest  
area like East Asian Studies.”

Presently, there are two  
other women’s centers in  
Boulder--the CU Women's  
Center and the Boulder  
County Women’s Resource  
Center.

“The University Women's  
Center is more academically  
oriented and provides career  
counseling for women, but  
the city Women’s Center is  
actually just getting started,”  
Christopher said.

Although the Boulder  
County Women's Resource  
Center is still undecided  
about the format of their  
program, they are tentatively  
considering such interest  
areas as: employment train-  
ing, child care assistance,  
peer counseling, cooperative  
money-making projects and  
various other plans for wo-  
men.

Lesbian Mothers Defense Fund Formed

“A Lesbian mother, as other  
mothers who are raising  
children alone, faces an  
enormous daily struggle try-  
ing to make ends meet.  
Obviously, when a legal court  
battle ensues, there is often  
no money to hire a competent  
attorney; there is more often  
no attorney who will take the  
case without personal bias,  
and this coupled with an  
all-over hostile judiciary sys-  
tem lends to the terror all  
Lesbian mothers face when  
the threat of losing their  
children becomes a real live  
nightmare.”

Out of this need the Lesbian  
Mothers National Defense  
Fund has been born. This  
fund would give help with  
court costs, child care, food,  
clothing, attorney's fees, etc.  
It would ensure Lesbian  
mothers from all over the  
country a fair representation  
in court. It would also make  
possible the printing and  
distribution of guidelines,  
previous court cases and even  
make available films now  
being used in court.

In cases pending in ex-  
tremely hostile territory, the  
defense fund would provide a  
competent and sympathetic  
attorney with transportation  
from one state to another.

If you would like to become  
a member of this organization  
send $2.00 (less or more as  
your budget permits) to:  

Lesbian Mothers National  
Defense Fund, 1941 Division,  
Enumclaw, Washington,  
98002.

“But we want our center to  
be unique, unlike any other  
women’s center in Boulder,”  
Christopher explained.

Of the other university  
women-oriented activities,  
Christopher said Birth Con-  
trol, Women Studies, Women  
Athletics and Day Care —  
Kiddie Kampus -- would  
hopefully be housed in the  
Women’s Crisis Center.

“Maybe a women’s center is  
the answer to getting things  
done together. . .the answer  
to better communication,”  
said Christopher who is  
jointly working with Nancy  
Polatti of the Boulder Com-  
munity Free School and Suzy  
Wiggins of the University  
Rap-line.

Christopher also stated that  
the group would like to run  
classes at the Women’s Crisis  
Center through such pro-  
grams as Women Studies,  
Experimental Studies and the  
Free School. “We would like  
to be able to pay our  
instructors though, and in  
order to do that, we'll have to  
ask for private contributions.
