nationalists simply because
they are Negroes. Third,
these groups must be dis-
credited in the eyes of
Negro radicals, the follow-
ers of the movement."

One effect of this program
was to foment destructive
struggle from within the
movement, and to isolate
leaders, programs and organ-
izations from support which
left them open for "legal"
attack or outright assass-
ination.

The North American left
and women's movement must
take serious responsibility
for turning our backs to the
war at home. We must be self
critical for uniting with
the U.S. attacks by isolating
the black movement, for turn-
ing all resources to the
anti-war and women's movement
and at the same time ridi-
culing the African Indepen-
dence Movement for paranoia
about State conspiracy again-
st them. We must be self
critical that we know more
about the subsequent SWP
office break-ins and the
imprisonment of Susan Saxe
than we did of the murder
and imprisonment of hundreds
of black revolutionaries. We
must take responsibility for
the fact that, after having
been set in motion by the
black revolution, the white
left, women's movement and
the spiritual "me" movement
of the '70s flourished,
spawning hundreds of newspapers,
community centers, free
schools, health and service
programs from the model of
black do-for-self which had
so recently been destroyed.
At the same time, the poli-
tics of "multi-nationalism"
was developed which attempted
to wipe out the political
victories of the anti-colo-
nial Black Power movement.
The left moved in where the
African leadership had been
decimated and the people ter-
rorized and attempted to re-
cruit black people into their
organizations and politics
under the guise of "multi-
nationalism." This relative
political freedom and the
resources to build them-
selves and the women's and
left movements off the motion
instigated by the black move-
ment and their deaths is the
basis for the deep opportun-
ism which characterizes and
stagnates the North American
left and women's movement to-
day. The stake of the North
American left is in their

-own organizational and in-
dividual leadership, their
attempt to politically har-
ness the militancy of the
black working class within
the confines of their poli-

tical analysis and organi-
zations; and the stakes of
the North American women's
movement are also in their
own collective situations,
resources, government grants,
and even in their struggling
small newspapers, women's
centers and health facili-
ties, and in distorting the
militancy of North American
women's history by co-opting
the historically courageous
resistance of African and
other colonized women. These
stakes are their motivation
to fear the re-emergence of
a genuine independent black
working class led revolu-
tionary movement which will
again shake the foundation
of this society through
building the mass movement

politically and what their re-
lationship is to the charges
they are making. It depends
on the slander itself for
substantiation. In other
words, Omali Yeshitela, with
the support of the African
People's Socialist Party,
beats, rapes and otherwise
exploits and oppresses Afri-
can women because the leaf-
let says it is so. This is
consistent with slander as
opposed to political strug-
gle in that the intent is
to make unsubstantiated
charges so damning and crim-
inal that the act of refu-
tation does more to spread
the slander than to bring
clarity to the issue.
Slander also needs charges
which cannot easily be proved

and programs and interna-
tional solidarity that will
ensure the successful com-
pletion of the black revolu-
tion against all viciousness
of this dying system. It is
these stakes which motivate
unity with obvious slander
which attempts to undermine
and discredit the re-emerg-
ing black movement under the
cover of morality or concern
for black women-

Our responsibility today
is to take the position of
political and material sup-
port for the Black Libera-
tion Movement. We must learn
from our errors of the early
60s and 70s and from what
we know now of covert State
attack and reject slander as
a basis for struggle. As ex-
plained in the booklet The
Black Working Class Vs. The
U.S. Government:

Slander is a method of
discrediting the Revolution
which depends on the gulli-
bility of the masses for its

success...We have raised the

slanderous charges made by
the women in their leaflet
and we will continue to re-
fer to them as this article
proceeds. In the first place,
the leaflet says nothing
about who the women are pol-

true or false, having only
the word of the slanderer
and the one being slandered
as the evidence, with the
slanderer automatically be-
ing in the advantage, since
successfully spreading the
slander is an end unto it-
self. Therefore, it is abso-
lutely necessary to know who
is engaged in the debate -
both the slanderer and the
one being slandered. And
since the one being slander-
ed is a political person and
organization, it is abso-
lutely necessary to know

who the slanderer is -
politically.

The line and practice of
the African People's Social-
ist Party has shown, through
out the past twelve years of
its existence, that the lib-
eration of African women is
part of the liberation of
all African people from col-
onialism. The statistics
show that the brutality of
the oppression of African
women is integral to the
colonial systematic politi-
cal and economic domination
of African people for pro-
fit: four times more black
women die in childbirth
than white women because of
hospital conditions and

poor pre-natal care. Forty-
seven percent of black fam-
ilies are headed by single
women, while 47% of black
men are unemployed. That
compares to 14% of single
North American mothers and
in 1954, only 8% of black
families were headed by
single mothers which shows
the genocidal deterioration
of the family survival
structures. In Avalon Park,
a black community in Chicago,
there is a 55 per 1000 in-
fant mortality rate which
compares to 86 per 1000 in
El Salvador and to 3 per
1000 in white Piedmont,
California.

This is most popularly
known through the struggle
to Free Dessie Woods and
Smash Colonial Violence,
which built a successful
international campaign based
on the understanding that
rape of black women is part
of the system of colonial
terror, which includes
lynching, police brutality
and the prison system, used
to stifle resistance to the
oppression of African people
as a whole. Despite the fact
that the unprincipled strug-
gle and attack on the Party
led by Ajowa Ifateyo in 1980
disrupted the Dessie Woods
defense work at a critical
time, Dessie Woods credits
the APSP for her freedom
today and works in the
Black Community Control
program to build the Afri-
can People's Free Childcare
Collectives. The APCC's are
another example of the pro-
grams of the Party to add-
ress the concrete conditions
of African working class wo-
men. With the large number
of single mothers in the
African community, these
collectives are designed to
allow African women the eco-
nomic and social mobility to
participate in the community
and develop politically and
contribute their leadership
to the African struggle.
They will also be centers
for political education and
to organize against oppres-
sive state structures such
as welfare.

The political position of
the APSP is spelled out in
their resolution "The Opp-
ression of African Women"
which was adopted at their
First Party Congress (see
A New Beginning and the ex-
cerpts printed in The Black
Working Class Vs. The U.S.
Government, pp. 20, 21).
Their 14 Point Working Plat-
form states in point nine:

We want an end to the pol-
itical and social oppression
and economic exploitation of
