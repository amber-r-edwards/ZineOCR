Ajowa Ifateyo To  
Tour Western U.S.

Dear BMR,

We're writing to thank you for the  
support you have shown for Dessie  
Woods. Media coverage of her case is  
crucial. The significance of the  
international demonstrations to Free  
Dessie Woods and Smash Colonial Vio-  
lence was highlighted by the excellent  
reporting done by the media. We  
of the Dessie Woods Support Coalition  
appreciate the time and energy spent  
informing the public of the importance  
of Dessie's case.

The western U.S. tour by Damesha  
Blackearth, Chairwoman of the Nation-  
al Committee to Defend Dessie Woods  
and member of the African People's  
Socialist Party, was very successful.  
Many new people learned of Dessie's  
case and were won to her support.

New support committees were formed  

in several areas and substantial  
funds were raised for the National  
Committee. With so many people taking  
on the work we are confident that  
Dessie will soon be free.

Ajowa Ifateyo (Vicki Adams), editor  
of The Burning Spear newspaper, will  
be touring the western U.S. in late  
January and February. The Burning  
Spear is the newspaper of the African  
People's Socialist Party and has con-  
sistently covered Dessie's case since  
1976; it has been instrumental in  
initiating and building support for  
this courageous black woman. We hope  
that your support for Dessie Woods  

will be extended to coverage of Ajowa's  

tour and support for The Burning Spear.  
Thanks again - we'll be in touch with  

you soon.

Yours,  
Ilene Abrams

Todd Explains Change

Dear BMR,

I would like to briefly share the  
development of how an altered version  
of Susan Saxe's poem "Self Defense”  
got to the Women's Martial Arts con-  
ference in California that Debbie  
Squires attended and wrote up in the  
November, 1979 issue of BMR. I am  
critical of my negligence to contact  
Susan earlier about the alterations  
in the poem, and am glad she brought  
up the criticism in the December  
issue of BMR. We have since directly  
corresponded to clear up miscommuni-  
cation.

I first read "Self Defense" in  
Susan's book Talk Among The Womenfolk  
last spring. I was very moved by it,  
started sending it to friends. Then  
I figured maybe I could share it with  
more women in song form 'cause it's  
easier for me to sing songs. I  
changed some of the words to more  
easily fit to music. I played it for  
some friends, checking out what they  
thought of it (it was the first time  
I'd set anything to music.) Around  
this time in karate we were working  
on a new concept for us--setting kata  
to music. (Katas are stylized karate  
forms symbolizing fighting off multi-  
ple attackers.) We developed a couple  
of katas to "Self Defense" and it  
turned out to be beautiful, powerful.  
We performed it at the Northwest  
Women's Music Festival and a couple  
of karate demonstrations in conjunc-  
tion with Rape Awareness Week, etc.  
Some members of our karate group,  
myself not included, went to the  
aforementioned martial arts confer-  
ence, and did the kata to a reading  
of the song version of "Self Defense."

I did not write the poem nor have  
any contact with Susan Saxe when she  
was underground as is implied in the  
crediting of the poem in BMR. How-  
ever I am responsible for the minor  
alterations in it--and should have  
checked it out with her before lett-  
ing it go anywhere--but I sure never  
thought it would go anywhere in the  
first place. I am excited by the  
connections that are made in the  
development of our culture and strug-  
gle--it has also made me more con-  
scious about being clear about sourc-  
es and content of things that I share  
in that development.

In love and struggle,  
Becca Todd

Dream Of New Paper

Dear Sisters,

Happy Birthday!

Keep up the good work.  
Joining in as a Consumer.  
I have what feels like a foolish  
(newly hatched) dream of a mideastern  
regional lesbian feminist newspaper  
from Detroit or thereabouts and con-  
cerned with Detroit-Chicago-Toronto-  
Cleveland-Cincinnati-Bloomington-Lex-  
ington-Champaign, that blob of Great  

Lakes geography.

Though you are Denver centered, you  
take yourselves seriously and delve  
into feminist issues as well as local  
news and schedules. Do we locally  
need to do that too? (Not that you  
could answer that.)

Here is my  

Mary Lou Spencer

P.S. Do you want to know what prompt-  
ed me to buy this paper? I needed  
affirmation that I didn't just dream  
that over 100,000 of us marched in  
Washington. Even feminist papers  
have reported low estimates like  
75,000 and regular papers gave numbers  
like 25,000 with equal time in the  
same article for reactionaries. The  
"New York Times" served this news as  
trivia.

Trap Of Military

Dear Ms. Goding:

I read your article, "The Draft,  
The Military, Women," in the Novem-  
ber issue of Big Mama Rag, and found  
it interesting. There should be more  
such articles in the feminist press  
to alert women to the trap of enlist-  
ment, which the military tries to  
pass off as a great opportunity.

I've enclosed a pamphlet which you  
might find helpful in future articles.  
We still have copies and would like  
to get them into the hands of women  
who are seriously considering enlist-  
ing. Perhaps you could help us to  
publicize the pamphlet.

In addition to the 75¢ cover price  
we have to ask for 50¢ postage.

Thanks again for helping the  
counter-recruiting cause.

ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

BMR Fuels Brain

Dear Sisters,

Wild windy greeting from the moun-  
tains!

Cheers to you for your work in pub-  
lishing a powerful feminist newspaper.  
The major articles are well-written  
and pertinent to current aspects of  
the women's movement. The "Feminist  
Calendar" is an invaluable summary of  
local and national events. Your  
"Hot Briefs" add fuel to the fire  
that keeps us working up here for  
women's freedom through learning to  
use our 90% dormant brain - woman's  
whole brain power.

Enclosed is $6.00 for a year's  
subscription.

In woman strength,

Women's Survival Program

Atmosphere In Denver

Dear BMR,

Recently I was in Denver for a brief  
visit after being away for a long time.  
It was great to see old friends again  
and catch up on the most recent person-  
al and political events. I was very  
disturbed to see such extreme politi-  
cal polarization and alienation. It  
shows up in BMR as well. My intention  
isn't to trash the paper because I do  
think it's a good paper. The inter-  
national news coverage is outstanding,  
but the articles on local events show  
much bias and personal animosity.  
Biased because there was no mention of  
some of the more positive aspects of  
the events. So as an outsider or non-  
participant it seemed like the events  
had no redeemable moments. Also there  
has to be support behind criticism or  
it's not constructive. I think a lot  
of the criticisms were valid and neces-  

sary, and I do think the women's commun-  

ity has a lot of work to do on their  
relationships with class backgrounds,  
racism, professionalism, etc. but I  
also think there are other problems  
that aren't being considered enough.

In recent months I've noticed myself  
and others becoming increasingly dis-  
interested in working in a political  
group situation. I think the main  
reason is that large groups seem to  
develop highly competitive atmospheres.  
I think perhaps the political atmo-  
sphere in Denver and other places is  
asking women to achieve the same  
stages of political development  
simultaneously, or more accurately  
community homogenization. Making  
those kinds of demands doesn't take  
into consideration class differences,  
education, access to education, pre-  
vious political experience, present  
and past financial capabilities,  
ability to articulate in a group sit-  
uation, and reaction to group scrutiny  
and criticism. Women lacking in some  
of these areas have less importance in  
the group because they seem to be con-  
sidered weak or ineffectual.

Why does long involvement in polit-  
ical work often create cliques that  
intimidate others? Cliques by their  
very nature give the impression of  
being self-contained, self-righteous  
and elitist. This intimidation divides  
the community into the heavies and  
the non-heavies. Non-heavies don't  
get much air space. The most serious  
effect being that nobody is feeling  
or giving any personal support to  
anyone other than their closest ass-  
ociates. Perhaps a little more re-  
spect for each other and a little  
less self-righteousness would smooth  
out some of the personal hostility.

Women MUST have a SAFE place to  
work together. We have no right to  
exclude women for political mistakes  
or differences. We can't fight a  
right wing world of intolerance with  
intolerance among ourselves. I am  
by no means suggesting solving polit-  
ical differences by compromising your  
politics but women shouldn't have  
their political growth stunted by  

intellectualized competitiveness.

It scares me that there is so much  
mistrust among sisters who have  
known and worked together for years.  
There has to be a place for all kinds  
of personalities within a movement,  

a safe place.

Respectfully,  
Karen Martin

Effects Of Anti-Porn

Dear Sisters:

The enclosed leaflet (see page 7)  
was distributed Saturday, October 20,  
1979 to the women who converged in  
New York City for the anti-pornogra-  
phy March on Times Square. Some 5,000  
women, many from outside New York  
City, participated in the march. All  
brought with them a sense of outrage  
at the anti-woman violence in our  
lives expressed openly and viciously  
in pornography.

But, as we learned while distribu-  
ting this leaflet, many also came  
with reservations and even objections  
about the focus of this particular  
demonstration, organized by Women  
Against Pornography. Many worried,  
as we do, about how the action ad-  
dressed or failed to address related  
issues such as prostitution, homopho-  
bia, racism and classism. And about  
the ways in which real estate, city,  
right wing and religious interests  
might use feminist outrage and the  
anti-pornography movement in general  
for their own ends, against the ulti-  
mate best interests of all women.

The March on Times Square convinced  
us that without a deep sensitivity  
to all their implications, anti-  
pornography campaigns can pose grave  
dangers to many individual women and  
to the feminist movement.

We hope this leaflet, by question-  
ing one anti-porn campaign's possible  
effects on a particular community  
and city, will help sharpen and renew  
the discussions we desperately need  
around this issue.

Work Issue Wanted

Dear Sisters,

How are you? I will be teaching  
an introduction to Women's Studies  
course this semester and I would  
like to use the articles on women  
and work by Vicki Piotter. Could  
you please send me copies of Vol. 7  
no. 7 and Vol. 7 no. 8 as soon as  
possible? Enclosed is my check for  
$1.50 which I hope covers the price  
of the newspapers and mailing.

I was pleased to see that you  
reprinted our pamphlet on the murders  
of Black women in Boston and Audre  
Lorde told me that you had printed  
my Open letter last fall. I don't  
see BMR often, but I like it very  
much. Keep up the good work.

Sincerely,  
Barbara Smith
