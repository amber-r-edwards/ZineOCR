appreciate help from women around the  
country who have experience with  

"Take Back the Night" marches in their  
cities. We would like to correspond  
with them in an exchange of informa-

worked and why. We have heard that  
someone in the northeast is compiling  
just such information and we would  
surely like to contact this wonderful  
woman. If anyone can help at all,  
please write (a postcard will do) to  

let us know who you are. In sisterhood,
