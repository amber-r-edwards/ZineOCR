Co-op Replaces Extended Family

Harriet Hunter Ford

In these days of ever increasing
inflation, there never seems to
be enough money to go around.
Not too long ago, most of us
were part of an extended family.
We had people to help look after
the children, to share things
with, and to talk with. All of
these things were exchanged
with one another. As people
have become more mobile,
many of us are many miles
away from ‘family’. About
two years ago, my neighbor and
friend, Virginia Lehman, told
me she had an alternative to the
extended family. She suggested
that we form a “co-op” in which
we could exchange babysitting
and other jobs we wanted done
or wanted to do. At first, I was
very apprehensive. I thought we
should do things for each other
“just to be nice”. Virginia
pointed out to me that that was
a very fine but unrealistic
attitude because it is just too
easy for one person to take
advantage of the other if some
kind of record isn’t kept. After
much discussion, our co-op was
launched. We decided that we
would translate our “charges”
for services or jobs into co-op
credits. We place a co-op credit
value on each service desired or
offered. This is loosely based on
what would be paid on the open
market. One exception to this is
babysitting. We charge one
co-op credit per hour per child.
A co-op credit is worth 60 cents.
We feel that child care is
extremely important and is too

often taken for granted. The
children receive more than mere
custodial care when they are
with members of the co-op. The
values we placed on services are
used only as a guideline and the
people involved are free to
negotiate at any time. We
exchange many services other
than babysitting. Among them
are: transportation,
housecleaning, ironing,
secretarial services, pre-school,
food, clothes, acrobatic lessons,
etc. The co-op now has twelve
members which is the maximum
number we have set for
membership. When we first got
started, our husbands by and
large thought we were slightly
unbalanced, to say the least.
When they heard us say things
like “I’ll give you this ham bone
with lots of ham on it for two
co-op credits”, there were
certain the diagnosis was
accurate. Now, however, we find
that their tune is changing. Our
husbands are beginning to catch
the disease. A few months ago,
my husband became our twelfth
member. He's a family
practitioner and exchanges his

Gay Coalition Needs Help

The Denver Gay Coalition at 1450 Pennsylvania St. has
formed a committee to draft a
broad anti-discrimination bill to
be presented to the Colorado
State Legislature during its next
session. The bill would ban
discrimination on the basis of
sexual preference, marital status
and age in the areas of job
discrimination, housing, state
certification, admission
programs to educational
institutions, child custody, and
prisoner rights.

Any interested persons who
would like to work on this
committee, please contact Marge
Johnson at 778-6536.

medical services for co-op
credits. In return, other
members do filing and other
secretarial jobs for him. Now
he’s branching out into other
areas of service. Last week he
babysat. A breakthrough to date
came a few weeks ago when
Virginia’s husband, who has
laughed and snickered at us for
two years, volunteered to be the
co-op secretary!

Women's Media

We would like to see a
collective approach towards a
women’s media project, filling
community needs while
developing skills and various
audio-visual media techniques.
There are various possibilities
for projects, which will be
decided by the group. Time and
place to be arranged. Call June
at 443-9688 or Rhonda at
499-1307.

Women In Transition

Women’s Transactional
