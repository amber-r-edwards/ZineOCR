Women and Jobs: An Uneasy Marriage

Randi Lornell

I work as a high school social studies teacher. The other day the
librarian brought me a new filmstrip project on “The Changing Role
of Women” to review. Those things are always pretty impressive: they
quote Shirley Chisholm, and show Indira Gandhi, and talk to women
who are doing wild and woolly jobs, and interview female lawyers and
professors. As I watched it, I thought, wow, isn’t this terrific, and in

such a few short years. . .

Then I walked down the hall to ask the female aide to do some
typing. And get some food from the female cafeteria staff. Before I
went to see the male vice principal, who referred me to the male
principal . . . Hey, if all these changes have happened, like that neat
filmstrip showed, how come I don’t see any in my life?

And so I decided to find out what really has changed for employed

women in Denver.

Here is a test, class. Answer
the following multiple choice
question (there is one best
answer): “Women in the feder-
al government have made:

1. great progress

2. some progress

3. very little progress

4. less than no progress:
they’ve gone backwards.”

Depending on what informa-
tion you look at, any of these
could be correct. For instance,
in 1968, 16.9% of all supervisors
were women; by 1972, this was
down to 13.6%. But overall, the
best answer is no. 2. What's
more, there is general optimism
that over the next few years, no.
1 will replace it.

There are a great number of
different groups advocating wo-
men’s rights in the federal
government. Perhaps the most
effective are the departments’
Federal Women’s Programs, the
operating arms of which are the
Federal Women's Project Com-
mittees. Two of their functions
seem particularly promising.
One is the supervision of their
department's Affirmative Action
plan (which, in terms of the
feds, means how to get women
out of clerical and into profes-
sional positions). The other is
the setting up of various task
forces to look into specific
issues and make solid recom-
mendations. Undoubtedly,
each federal department's FWPC
has its own particular interest.
But all have the overriding
concern of how to move women
ahead. Granted, the affirmative
action plans will hopefully deal
with this; but in the meantime,
the committees themselves are
acting. In January of this year,
for example, the Civil Service
Commission's FWPC under its
coordinator Doris Veeden spon-
sored a three-day seminar called
Reach for Success, devoted to
helping secretaries and para-
professionals learn how to move to
the management level. More
than 300 people attended, of
whom 7 or 8 were men. The
workshop proved so popular
that another was held in early
February. Significantly, most of
the employing agencies both
granted release time and paid for
interested employees to attend.

Will Gains Result?

Will concrete gains result?
From 1968 to 1972, the per-
centage of women in grades 9-12
(management level) went from
8% to 11.1%; in grade 13 and up
(the highest), from 1.8% to
3.1%. Those are, in my mind,
miniscule gains. But Veeden
believes “we will see a lot of
advancement in the next 4-5
years.”

In a different vein, the FWPC
within HEW is working with the
Denver Police Department on
developing a self-defense pro-
gram. Like all projects in the
department's FWPCs, the self-
defense idea was suggested by
women in the department.
There are no directives coming

down from either Secretary
Weinberger or the Big Man
himself.

While the success of the

FWPCs will be decided by the
activity and determination of
the women themselves, the pro-
gram is sponsored by the govern-
ment. The woman elected by
her fellow female employees to
be coordinator of her depart-
ment’s committee is relieved of
some of her other duties. In
other words, the government in
effect hires a part-time coordina-
tor for each department. And
luckily, in Denver, several wo-
men interviewed emphasize that
the regional director here, who
has the real power, is “really
committed” to women moving
ahead.

Women in the federal govern-
ment have also organized on
their own, apart from the
government-sponsored FWP.
About five years ago, FEW
(Federally Employed Women),
Inc. was formed on a nationwide
basis to end sex discrimination
within the federal government.
Frankly, one gets a feeling of
“Potomac fever” in talking with
some of their people — “in
Washington they're really doing
a lot, but you know, well, out
here, well..."

Well, it’s a little hard to see
that they're doing much of
anything out here. Last year
FEW’s year-long project was to
educate women about the af-
firmative action plans so women
could learn how to take advan-
tage of their new opportunities.
This year they’re checking on
the agencies’ AA plans and soon
will see if the agencies are really

following through on
them.

They “put pressure on” — but
offer no specifics as to how
that’s done or even what it
means. More tangibly, FEW is
active in helping some women
who have brought sex discrimin-
ation cases within the federal
government, both through the
internal grievance procedures
and into court.

FEW claims that because they
are recognized by management
and can carry on activities on
clock time, and because they
can focus unfavorable publicity
on practices they don’t like,
they are successful. Yet their
leaders also apologize for having
few (no pun) members, and even
fewer young ones. They men-
tion that the union movement is
where things are really going to
happen. (It leaves one a bit
skeptical.)

Universities are supposed to
be the liberal bastions of the
society, or at least that’s their
image. If you take what's

happening in women’s struggle
for equality as an indication,
however, that ain’t the way it’s
working.

Any organization with more
than 50 employees that has a
contract with the federal govern-
ment or gets federal funds must
not discriminate in employment.
For many large employers in-
cluding educational institutions,
this has meant drawing up
affirmative action plans that will
ensure equal treatment in hiring
and firing as well as in promo-
tions. DU’s sounds good, and on
the principle that you should
always praise before you con-
demn, we'll look at that first.

The Affirmative Action Ad-
visory Board (AAAB) at the
university is set up to monitor
and analyze how women and
racial minorities are doing in
each department, to set goals,
and to work with those depart-
ments that are not actively
trying to meet equal employ-
ment goals. The head of the
AAAB must affirm every open-
ing (i.e., you can’t hire your
friends without telling anybody
else about the job).

In addition, there is a Com-
mittee for Women on Campus
(CWC) that was started about
three years ago by faculty
members concerned about work-
ing conditions. The CWC has
also always included students
and staff.

Stuck in Boring Positions

This year, the committee is
emphasizing the problems of
clerical staff. And here, again, is
the familiar refrain that begins to
get old the 43rd time
you hear it: women are stuck in
dead-end boring positions, with
little chance to move into
professional or management pos-
itions. Women are paid less,
largely because they are put in
jobs with “smaller” titles. And
the eternal problem: how do
you prove these things are due
to discrimination, and how do
you do something to change
them? The CWC is meeting with
the vice chancellor, personnel
director, and the AAAB in
March to “discuss” them.

To my question, asked con-
tinually to both AAAB and
CWC people, what real progress
has been made, came always the
same answer: nothing tangible
yet, but we're working on it.

There are undoubtedly a
multitude of reasons for the
stagnation, some peculiar to DU.
But one is common to us
all, though particularly severe to
educational establishments right
now: jobs are tight. You can't
hire women, or minorities, when
there are no jobs to hire them
for. And no one is likely to get
all fired up and militant when
being fired will probably mean
going on unemployment com-
pensation.

So the women of DU plod
along, going to committee meet-
ings, hoping that eventually
something, in the economy at
large and/or within the universi-
ty, will crack. But it’s going to
be a wait.
