Prison as a means of keeping us in place  
Developing  

Kate Sharp  

The criminal “justice” system in  
this country is something that we, as  
feminists and socialists need to be  
concerned about. If we are concerned  
about ending the existing capitalist/  
racist/patriarchal system in this  
country, we must see how the courts  
and prisons are used to benefit that  
system. The criminal "justice" system  

acts to maintain the status quo,  
cage, disempower and abuse what is  
largely a group of already oppressed  
persons, and by so doing, prison and  
the threat of prison helps to keep  
the poor and powerless in their  
"place." Although crime exists at  
all levels of society, it is the  
ruling class that maintains and deter-  
mines the character of the criminal  
"justice" system. And not surprisingly,  
that system consistently works to  
keep the wealth and power in this  
country exactly where it is.  

We are taught to have a stake in  
the criminal “justice” system—to  
believe that it is designed to be of  
benefit to society as a whole, as well  
as to ourselves specifically. Blindly  
we trust that it is protecting us  
from becoming the victims of criminal  
acts while at the same time preparing  
those inside its walls for a non-  
threatening return to society. In  
reality, prisons do little to either  
protect society or rehabilitate the  
law-breaker. Instead, they do little  

more than heap added sufferings onto  
persons who are already, in some way,  
suffering.

THE MYTH OF PROTECTION  

It is beneficial to the system that  
we blithely assume that we are being  
offered protection from those who are  
behind thick concrete walls and under  
the watchful eye of armed guards.  

When the prison system provides us  
with a feeling of security, we do not  
question it. However, Jessica Mitford  
points out in Kind and Usual Punishment  
that, “The Presidents’ Commission on  
Causes and Prevention of Violence says  

that for an estimated million crimes  
committed in the United States in a  
recent year, only 1% of the perpet-  
rators were imprisoned." This is  
because only about half of the felon-  
ies committed are ever reported, and  
only about 12% result in arrest, after  
which a mere 6% result in conviction,  
and out of those 6 perpetrators of  
every 100 crimes, an estimated 1.5  
persons end up going to prison or jail.  
A slim minority of law-breakers end  
up becoming scapegoats to our sup-  
posed system of "justice."  

We also feel safe in the notion  
that prison serves as a deterrent  
to crime. For those of us with the  
power and influence to avoid arrest  
or conviction, and with certain  
options and alternatives to crime,  
this is possibly true. However, for  
those who have been caught and con-  
victed of crimes, prison obviously  
did not act as much of a deterrent.  
(Gwynn Nettler, in her book, Explaining  
Crime writes that, "The lower class  
person, the person most frequently  
arrested, believes...that ‘life is  
trouble,’ that much in one’s life is  
fated regardless of what one does..."  
Would not such a set of expectations  
make prison seem like more of an  
inevitability than a crime deterrent?)  
And from the degree of recidivism existent  
we must assume that the prison  
experience itself does not serve  
as much of a deterrent. In fact,  
it has long been known that prison  
is a place where the "tools" of  
one’s criminal “trade” can be re-  
fined, sharpened and improved upon  
by virtue of input from one's  
“colleagues.” As dehumanizing an  

experience as prison is commonly  
known to be, such knowledge does  
not very effectively deter persons  
from crime. It certainly will not  

deter the person whose problem of  
lacking job skills or of alienation  
is not alleviated. If prison does  
not deter potential criminals, it  
does not protect "us."  

Even if it were possible/desirable  
to lock up and keep locked up  
every person arrested for a crime,  
what about those countless crimes  
that go undetected and/or unreported  
because they have been committed  
by someone with wealth, power and  
influence? Mitford points out that  

Absent from the Uniform Crime  
Reports are crimes committed  
by the rich and powerful  
against the rest of the popu-  
lation: Murder, assault, and  
theft via violation of health  
and safety codes by slum land-  
lords, mine owners, construc-  
tion companies, robbery by  
the food industry through  
deceptive packaging, and  
organized crime that depends  
on corruption of public  
officials, to name a few.  

So, we see vividly that prisons  
do not keep us safe and protected.  
Few persons who commit crimes are  
incarcerated anyway (due to such  
things as lack of evidence, and  
legal loopholes as well as the legal  
“immunity” of certain segments of  
society). And in addition, prisons  
do little to deter potential crim-  
inals from crime. As nothing more  
than housing units for the unfortu-  
nate captured few, they will continue  
to fail as society's great protector.  
Our belief in prison rehabilitation  
programs is two-fold. We believe  
that prison inmates are being train-  
ed to hold jobs in the outside world  
and are being given psychological  
help to facilitate their return to  
society. Let us examine these myths  
more closely.  

THE MYTH OF JOB TRAINING  

In prison, a few persons manage to  
get some experience with specialized  
equipment (although, often on obso-  
lete or antiquated equipment) or are  
engaged in limited education programs  
but largely, jobs in prison are of  
the menial, meaningless and totally  
unskilled variety. Virtually in-  
variably for women, and also for  
most men, this means janitorial,  
laundry and kitchen duties—jobs  
referred to as Institution Upkeep.  

In addition, women in prison do all  
of the in-prison sewing for both the  
male and female institutions.  
Institution Upkeep jobs are the most  
plentiful jobs in prison and "paid  
workers in Institution Upkeep get  
from $2 to $6 a month."  

Contrary to what we are led to  
believe, prison does not train the  
prisoner for a skillful return to  
the labor force. Rather, it returns  
the prisoner unskilled and penniless.  
And, it exploits the labor of prison-  
ers, most especially of women, in  
much the same way and in much the  
same areas as society at large.  

THE MYTH OF  
PSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION  

The other important rehabilitative  
program we trust is going on behind  
prison walls is psychological rehab-  
ilitation. Obviously, we reason, they  
must be doing something to enable  
those who are deeply disturbed to  
make their successful return to  
society. And, we further reason,  
law-breakers must be emotionally  
disturbed or else they wouldn't do  
the things they do.  

Such an attitude is concomitant  
with the notion that there is some  
overwhelming psychological difference  
between them (the convicted law-  
breaker) and us. Upon close scrutiny  
however, we realize that we and they  
are in many cases the same. What is  
responsible for the greatest differ-  
ence between us is a system of  
"justice" which is heavily weighted  
against certain segments of society.  

Consider these statistics:  

According to...(1971) FBI  
figures "honest" employees  

and customers of business  

firms all over the United  
States have taken more from  
their employers and stores  

than all the criminal losses  
(for 1971) combined. A  
recent article in U.S. News  
and World Report magazine  
reported that in 1971 trusted  
employees took more than four  
billion dollars in goods and  
equipment from the places  
where they worked. This was  
four times more than the  
total losses to the same  
business firms from robbers,  
burglars, larcenists, and  
auto thieves combined. An  
assistant director of the FBI  
was quoted in this same report  
as saying that "over 91% of  
ordinary people from every  
walk of life confidentially  
admitted to having committed  
a crime serious enough to be  
sent to jail or prison."  

The differences between "their"  
essential character and "ours" seem  
slight, indeed, in light of this  
information. The difference, it  
would seem, is not one of character  
but of the ability to avoid convic-  
tion.  

If we are to share at least some  
criminal guilt with those who have  
been arrested and convicted, we must  
question the validity of an attitude  
that holds that there is some psycho-  
logical "flaw" which produces the  
criminal personality. From a study  
quoted in Kind and Usual Punishment—  
"a cross section of the criminal  
world would show us no more emotional  
imbalance than could be found in the  
general population." Why then, does  
there exist in prison an overwhelming  
dependence on mood altering drugs,  
isolation cells, electroshock ther-  
apy, sensory deprivation and a myriad  
of behavior mod techniques in the  
guise of therapy and rehabilitation?  
Obviously, the belief in a universal  
maladjusted “criminal psychology” is  
prevalent within the prison system.

An Analysis Of  

It cannot be denied that some  
people convicted of crimes do have  
very real and extremely serious  
psychological problems. Obviously,  
cruel and senseless crimes need to  
be put to an end, understood and  
remedied. And yet, are the psychi-  
atric practices in common usage with-  
in our prisons valuable to the per-  
sons they are designed to treat?  
Rarely, believes Jessica Mitford.  
She writes:  

From the convicts’ point of  
view, “treatment” is a humili-  
ating game, the rules of  
which he must try to learn in  
order to placate his keepers  
and manipulate the parole  
board at his annual hearing:  
"I have gained much insight  
into my problems during the  
past year." According to a  
1966 study by the Institute  
for the Study of Crime and  
Delinquency, "most (inmates)  
looked upon” treatment programs  
as phony. Seventy percent of  
inmates polled answered "yes"  
to the question: Do you be-  

lieve that therapy and treat-  
ment programs are games? The  
researchers concluded, "Most  
cons know how to walk that  
walk, talk that talk, and give  
the counselor what he wants  
to hear."  

It is easy to see that prison  
psychiatry as commonly practiced is  
highly ineffectual. The need for  
therapy in prison, in many cases, is  
even questionable. And, with the  
prevalence of such damaging techni-  
ques as electroshock and drug therapy  
we must question whether the true  
motive behind prison "therapy" is  
not really control; the making of  
the passive and well-behaved prison-  
er who will cause no problems during  
his stay. Add to all this the fact  
that job training too is highly  
ineffectual, and the logical con-  
clusion we reach is that prisons do  
very little, indeed, by way of re-  
habilitation.  

THE CAUSES OF CRIME  

We must, if we are to make any  
sense of crime, and postulate any al-  
ternatives to the prison system, be-  
gin to understand some of the under-  
lying causes of crime. Prison reform-  
er and psychiatrist Karl Menninger  
believes that most crime is a type  
of "adaptation available for the re-  
lief of helplessness" - a seizing of  
power by the powerless. Such feel-  
ings of powerlessness may be psycho-  
logical or sociological in origin.  

In many cases, criminal acts, al-  
though perhaps performed without  
analysis, are strangely logical con-  
sequences of inequality (economic,  
social, political). They are often  
desperate and revealing reactions to  
tangible wrongs; to the unequal dis-  
tribution of power and wealth. Or  
they may be the psychological con-  
sequences of abuse and neglect. As  
tragic, cruel, harmful and seemingly  
senseless as many crimes are, they  
are often the unheeded cry that some-  
thing is deeply wrong.  

In an exhaustive expose of the An-  
erican prison system called, Instead  
of Prisons, the Prison Research Ed-  
ucation Project writes:  

"Poverty, lack of meaningful  
employment and educational op-  
portunities, disease and lack  
of medical care, malnutrition,  
poor and dilapidated housing  

The Criminal “Justice” System  

all contribute to feelings of  
anger, rage, alienation, and  
powerlessness. These feelings  
can encourage a person to com-  
mit a crime.  
However...crime—including  

aggressive crime—is found at  
all levels of society, among all  
classes of people, all races,  
and in all neighborhoods...  

The dominant culture is the  
predominant key to crime.  

The number of crimes committed by  
women has risen dramatically in the  
last ten years. This phenomenon is  
apparently the result of some new  
attitudes, held by both sexes, about  
women. Traditionally, the crimes that  
women have committed have centered  
around the “sexually-stereotyped  
crimes" of shoplifting, writing and  
cashing bad checks and prostitution.  

I call these crimes sexually stereo-  
typed because they are not the more  
violent crimes usually associated  
with men, and, too they are the  
symptoms of oppression that is speci-  
fic to women. For example, the woman  
who is cast in the role of doing most  
of the family shopping has a greater  

opportunity to shoplift and pass bad  

checks. The woman who has no other  
marketable skills is a likely can-  
didate for prostitution. Although  

a disproportionate number of female  
law-breakers are still arrested for  
these crimes—there has been a dram-  

atic rise in the number of other crimes  

committed by women as well, in re-  
cent years. Richard Deming, author  
of Women: The New Criminals explains  
the phenomenon this way:  

The single causative factor  
in the increase of female crimi-  
nality has been the women’s  
liberation movement.  

The effect has been entirely  
indirect, I believe... But the  
movement "has opened opportuni-  
ties to all women that were  
formerly barred to them. It has  
caused them to reevaluate their  
status in relation to men...  
And it has changed the atti-  
tude of society in general, in-  
cluding the male segment of it,  
as to what is acceptable behav-  
ior for women.  

Economics has always been the pri-  
mary reason behind most criminal  
behavior in women. Women law-breakers  
in the majority of cases, are single  
heads of households. Certainly, it  
seems reasonable, in this age of  
rebellion against traditional sex-  
roles and a breaking away from de-  
pendence on men, that more women  
than ever will be single or single  
parents—and thus, as a group, will  
have more economic need than ever  
before—especially in an inflated  
economy that is simply not prepared  
for a greater influx into the labor  
force. Too, case histories have  
shown that many women faced with  
boring and alienating job possibili-  
ties will choose crime as a more  
interesting and lucrative way to  
spend one’s time than mopping  

floors. By the same token, it seems  
reasonable that women would no longer  
want to be slotted into the same old  
criminal options, either. Apparently,  
women are demanding equality in the  
world of crime as well. So, it seems,  
societal changes too have an effect  
on criminal activity.  

In this society of very definite  
hierarchies and far-reaching inequal-  
ities, not only the poor end up tak-  
ing their frustrations and feelings  
of alienation out in illegal ways.  
Crime, as a self-initiated attempt  
at equalization, becomes widespread.  
Not just the hungry steal and the  
dispossessed commit acts of rage.  

In a society in which those with pow-  
er are consistently favored—often  
visibly exploit and visibly "take"—  
it is not unreasonable that much of  
the rest of society will take their  
"due" as well. We are, by tradition,  
expectation and structure, a nation  
of takers. That fine line between  
need and greed, between real and im-  
agined usurpation of one's power be-  
comes immaterial. People from all  
social strata rely on crime either  

in a  

to assuage their feelings of injus-  
tice, or to sustain their financial  
greed or need for power. People  

steal when they could/should be  
“dealt a better hand" from life. Peo-  
ple abuse others as a means of "pro-  
ving themselves," of gaining control  
over someone else when they feel that  
some power they hold, or desire to  
hold, is being threatened. These  
phenomena exist at all levels of  
society. For the lower classes crime  
is also often the result of a common  
attitude that holds that various tra-  
gedies are inevitable and unavoidable  
anyway, so why shouldn't one toy with  
danger? For the upper classes criminal  
activity is often the belief that un-  
scrupulous behavior will go unnoticed  
or unpunished anyway. Although crime  
for many is a form of economic sur-  
vival, a desire for domination by the  
disempowered or a means to some de-  
gree of independence in a world of  
few options, it is also a way of life  
for the middle and upper classes too.  
How can we realistically
