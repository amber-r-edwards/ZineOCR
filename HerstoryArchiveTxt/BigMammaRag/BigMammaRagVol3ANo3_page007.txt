Sagaris...

Boyd, a founder and organizer
of Sagaris.

Take your food stamps along
if you go.

The area of faculty salaries
raises expenses and a number of
questions. Originally, the in-
structors were to be paid $1,500
for each session, which lasts five
weeks. $300/week! While it is
true that volunteerism in the
Women’s Movement must grind
to a halt and women be paid a
fair wage for our work, it is
questionable whether
$300/week is a fair wage. That
amount is more than anyone on
the BMA staff (who gets paid)
makes in a month. And BMA
pays a good salary for a women’s
organization (full-time is
$250/month). And remember, it
is what women like you and I
make that is going to pay the
faculty what they make.
Seemingly an inequitable situa-
tion. According to Blanch Boyd
the heaviest criticism of the in-
stitute has concerned its
classism. “But,” she said, “we
have decided to go ahead and
open with the present financial
structure and be ready to give
financial aid rather than not
open at all.” The organizers ex-
pect future sessions to be
cheaper since they are an-
ticipating obtaining more grant
money.

In an effort to bring costs more
into line, Sagaris has asked the
faculty to voluntarily decrease
their salaries to $1,000 per ses-
sion. Some have. One woman is
taking no salary at all. Others
have not. The faculty is still
responding to the request. At
this time only six of the 20 have
responded.

According to Corwin, “$1,500
or $1,000, is relatively low (com-
pared) to what teachers in most
other private institutions earn.”
If Sagaris is to reflect
revolutionary feminist values it
will not, we hope, be like “most
other private institutions.” That
is, capitalist in orientation and
structure. Concerning the
economics of the institute, Jan
stated, “It is difficult to pinpoint
Sagaris’ economic orientation.
After having grown up in a
capitalist society, none of us are
capitalists. But further than that,
we have no set economic line.”

The more the salary expense
is reduced, the more money
available for scholarships, ac-
cording to Blanch. Also, all
money raised at benefits is to go
to scholarships, said Jan.

If all faculty salaries were
lowered to $1,000, and special
lecture money was cut in half
(don’t forget the $7,000 con-
tingency fund), and there is full
enrollment there would be $13,-
000 available; enough money for
65 half scholarships of $200
each. If the special lectures
money is entirely eliminated,
there would be enough for 160
half scholarships or 80 full
scholarships. This does not in-
clude any funds which may have
been raised at benefits.

Jan stated there is a high
priority on lowering costs so
low-income women can attend.
Yet, the budget makes no
provisions for scholarships, ex-
cept if there is full enrollment, or
if the faculty voluntarily lowers
its salaries, or if money is raised
at benefits. (The $800 raised in
November was used for printing
costs, not scholarships!?)

Projected Income:

Feminism, there is something
happening here that must be
dealt with. It is this: the structure
you use to attain your goals will
very highly resemble the struc-
ture you will have when you get
there. The values by which you
evaluate the methods you use
will be the built-in values of the
product.

What do you really want? If
you are seeking to produce a
feminist Harvard you can count
a lot of women out. Radical
the movement are angry with
the contradiction that we would
have to stop working within the
Women’s Movement and take a
“straight” job in order to afford
to attend.

Sagaris holds much promise.
It could be one of the finest
achievements of the Women’s
Movement, and an impetus for
future efforts. It could provide a
groundwork for cohesive activity
in the movement. Or it could
become a very cruel joke and a
symbol of failure for the ideals of
feminism if its organizers do not
remain aware of and responsive
to the situation and needs of
sisters who are materially less
advantaged.

Most of us have grown up with
elitism and the capitalist struc-
ture.

NOTE: Since Sagaris will have two identical sessions, I have doubled all
the relevant figures in this budget, that is, ten faculty for two sessions
has been called twenty faculty, etc. so that we will be able to operate if we have less-than-full enrollment. If our enrollment is over 200, we will use the additional money for financial aid to students.

If, however, 193 women pay
full tuition, necessary expenses
will be met. What could then
happen is that all students over
that be admitted at low costs or
free when appropriate. Since
seed money to fund the in-
stitute for next summer needs
to be gathered, some tuition
charge seems reasonable. So
apply for financial aid, which
you may get. Or go with some
money to invest and “request”
to be admitted.

Blanch says they also feel
women will put more into
something if we have a financial
stake in it; a commitment. We
take issue with that value.
Sagaris could give many
scholarships to women who
pay low wages. These women’s
lack of funds in no way discredits
their seriousness; in fact, it sup-
ports it.

What DO We Want?

BMR, since late last summer,
has been seeking detailed infor-
mation on the program, the
costs, and the philosophy of
Sagaris. This has been a slow
and tedious process, since the
women who are bringing the in-
stitute together are all on the
east coast. These women,
probably overworked as are
most active feminists, have tried
to answer our questions in full.
The information we have receiv-
ed, however, has been conflic-
ting.

The biggest problem with
Sagaris seems to be the high
costs of tuition and board, and
with that the whole question of
class and economic con-
sciousness. The emphasis at the
institute seems to have been put
on creating a program, with
primary emphasis on theory,
rather than on making that
program financially available to
as many feminists as possible.

Although an institute like
Sagaris may be a desirable addi-
tion to the development of
work in women’s projects which
feminists are not seeking a shelf
of leather-bound feminist
classics starting with
Sisterhood is Powerful. We do
not want tenure on the NOW
national board. We do not seek
to change life's projectionist
while leaving the same film on
the reel. We are not after a piece
of the pie.

There is certainly more to
Sagaris than just a perfect op-
portunity to make a few snide
remarks. But the fact is, women
are not only hurt by what is
happening. They are angry.
Angry with costs that are
exclusionary. Angry with talk
about socialism in the classes
while capitalism is actually
happening. Those who work in

ture practically built in to us. But
we must strive at every turn to
find new and equitable methods
for reaching our ends. The
charge that the women’s move-
ment has been largely middle
class is not without truth. If
Sagaris continues as it is
presently structured many
women who are deeply concern-
ed with the question of class
may begin to have serious
doubts about what we feminists
are doing. Rhetoric will not do.
We are all tired of talk. We must
create workable alternatives in
feminist institutions.
