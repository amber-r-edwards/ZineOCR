Amidst twisted sheets,  
and find an excuse to  

shoulders touch  

linger in softness of confused identity  

the feel of tangled leaves  

seeks no other refuse than branches  

that overlap, because they crowd  

My fingers trace upward along  
the structure of your faces  
that leads only to the hollow  
just this side of your ear  

which must hold captive all the words  
that were meant to mean so much more.  

And so we reap, and so ... and grow  
our plants and collection of books  

and old friends and lovers, but  

not our capacity of, or for, love.  
We might have been more, but then,  

neither of us was to be trusted

Then one day I read "The  
Politics of Housework," per-  
haps the most important article  
I've ever read. I suddenly  
had the following realization.  
David and I certainly shared  
the Amanda tasks but I was the  
one responsible for her. I  
was the one who thought  
of what to do and then delegated  
the responsibility. I  
knew when she was about to run  
out of clothes, when to change  
her crib sheet, and when to  
give the relief bottle of  
apple juice. And then I  
reevaluated our parenthood  
existence. We both uncon-  
sciously acted upon my ultimate  
responsibility for the house-  
work, and, later, for the child.  

Fights, misunderstanding  
and anger began, and was I  
alone. Here I was with what  
most people considered a  
model husband, and I had always  
felt lucky (read: superior).  
I had had talks the previous  
spring with a woman who, with  
her husband, had explicitly  
delegated jobs. I had felt  
David and I had a "greater"  
mutual understanding and we  
didn't need such artificial job  
outlines. Our commitment to  
equality was enough. We  

started to assign specific jobs.  

But I resented that I was the  
one who always thought of what  
to do. We tried to change  
that, but I had been socialized  
well and so unfortunately, had  
David. Our struggles were  
those that many sisters have  
gone through about housework,  
but complicated by Amanda's  
total presence and dependence.  
Our struggles were really  
hard. They were our first ones  
specifically around women's  
issues, and a few words of  
awareness do not break up old  
patterns. The change is  
painful and scary when you feel  
like a fanatic unappreciative  
bitch - but compared to anyone  

else's situation I was lucky.  

My angry feelings turned  

inward, repressed and sometimes  
expressed to David, but to  
nobody else. I didn't want to  
admit failure. "If it's so bad,  
why did you have a baby in the  
first place," I imagined  

others would say to me.  

I felt guilty for resenting  
David. I felt I should  
appreciate his helpfulness.  

I'm frankly not sure what he  
was feeling. Frustration, I  
imagine. Every time he turned  
around I had thought of a new  
task. Oh, those arguments  
about how much Amanda's room  
should be dusted! After all,  
we never dusted our room.  

But she's an infant, and the  
germs are out to get her. All  
should be sterile and as  

clean as the pictures in the  
books. I probably felt more  
should be done than was neces-  
sary; David, less than necess-  
ary.  

How could I complain when  
I lived in a commune and so  
rarely ever was home alone with  
Amanda? My housemates adored
