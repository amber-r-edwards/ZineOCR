Denver Women in the Arts

An Interview with

The following is an interview with
Trudy Sauter, a Denver artist.
Throughout the months of May and June,
an exhibition of drawings by Trudy
was held at Elrond's Restaurant in
Denver. This was Trudy's first one-
woman show. She is planning to show
at Elrond's again in November and Dec-
ember of this year.

“Dona Calacone

BMR:
What kinds of things are you doing?

Trudy: Working with pen and ink. I
like it. I like trying to make things
look real when they're done in black
and white, without any color; making
people imagine the colors. I do land-
scapes. That used to bother me: that
I wasn't doing anything feminist. I
should be doing something feminist and
political--women's art--but I like
landscapes. And I like trees. I really
got into drawing trees when I read
‘The White Goddess' by Robert Graves
where he talks about trees and the
symbolism for trees and how trees have
meanings.

BMR: What more does he say about it?

Trudy: Well, it's all about the secret
language of poetry. Ireland was the
last place where this secret language
was known and understood. Different
words had different meanings and all
these meanings were used to call upon
the Goddess. And poetry is a Goddess
thing. And since I can’t write poetry,
I thought I would draw instead. I draw
trees and trees are symbols evoking
the Goddess, in a way.

BMR: A friend recently told me that
the phrase "knock on wood" is an evo-
cation of the tree Goddess. In saying
that phrase and knocking, you're call-
ing up the tree Goddess to help you
along.

What else has stimulated your work?

Trudy: That book, The White Goddess,
and I think maybe too, living in the
city where you don't see landscapes at
all. You don't see huge stands of
trees, you don't see forests. And it's
sort of barren. It's nice to be able
to put things on the wall which give
you memories of other places. I do a
lot of drawings because they remind me
of things I remember as a kid. Oh,
this is like someplace my parents took
me, or this is where I grew up in South
Dakota. This looks a lot like that
place. Partly I just draw because I have to,
I just feel obligated to, every day I
have to draw. It's hard to explain:
Just as some people have to go to
work, I have to sit down and draw. If
I don't I feel real guilty.

BMR: Do you think that guilt is a nat-
ural thing or that it's imposed because
of your ambitions?

Trudy: No. It's natural. Even before,
I was real paranoid about ever showing
things to anyone other than my
friends, or trying to sell them. But
I was still forced to do it because it
relaxed me, because I felt I was sup-
posed to do it, because it was the one
thing I could do really well-- was pen
and ink work.

A lot of times I'll start out draw-
ing if I'm in a bad mood or if I'm
angry, because it's good therapy, be-
cause I can relax that way. I have to
get totally involved with what I'm
seeing on the piece of paper, or what
I'm going to see, or what I have to
project onto that piece of paper. And
I don't have to think at all about
little hassles at work or with my lo-
ver or something like that. All of a
sudden, all the problems go away.

BMR: Your work is very small in size.

Trudy: Yeah. I work real tiny-- tiny,
tiny, little lines built up. That's
why I want to learn watercolor be-
cause I want to be able to break away
from that and do something real big
and with bright colors although I like
pen and ink the best.

BMR: You usually set things off on the
horizon at a great distance. They've
already small and that makes them
appear even smaller-- the fact that
there's that great distance between
the viewer and the objects.

Trudy: I think that that's because
what I like to draw is a huge, empty
space. For some reason it comforts me.
But seeing something in that space too
There is something back there. It's
not all empty. Did you see the drawing
with the telephone poles and the trees
on the right in the distance? That was
my favorite. Because everything sucked
you back in but there was something
back there.

I like the mid-west a lot and I
think that people don't see it. They
go zipping by on Interstate 80 and
they don't see it and I would like to
make people see it. After all, I
think that's an important part of
drawing. You take something you like
and you force other people to look at
it.

BMR: What do you think of conceptual
art and the use of junk and various
objects and things in art pieces?

Trudy: Sometimes I like it. A lot of
times I see it as joke art. I think
that people feel uncomfortable with
humor in art. People think: It can't
really be art; it should be in the
National Lampoon. Art has to be ser-
ious and just crush you.

BMR: Have you thought of doing more
conceptual or abstract work?

Trudy: I'm too nostalgic to get into
abstract art. I tried it for a while.
I did big canvases in acrylics with
lines and blocks of color and every-
thing chopped up and they were real
nice and people liked them but after a
while I didn't like them because I
couldn't see anything in them. I like
things that evoke memories. What I
would ultimately like to get into is
abstract landscapes done in water-
colors. Things which give the hint of
landscapes but there's no horizon
line, there're all clouds. I don't
know I'll have to learn how to do it,
then I'll do it.

BMR: Your drawings of trees seem to be
metaphors for people in their inter-
relating.

Trudy: Yes. I love it when I'm draw-
ing away and I have a group of trees
over here relating to one another and
there will be one over here and one
of its branches will cut in because it
wants to be in that closeness. I think
about people a lot when I'm drawing,
too, and a lot of times I'll think a-
bout friends and relationships while
I'm putting trees together.

BMR: Your drawings are very classical
in structure. Everything is very mea-
sured and even and balanced.

Trudy: I'm a very orderly person. I
work in a library. It can't help but
come out when I draw. I like to see
balance. When I did abstract things,
it was blocks of color balancing off
other blocks of color.

BMR: The drawings are very constrained
and still, too.

Trudy: I think that gets back to
something said earlier about being
angry when I start and working on be-
ing calm as I draw. And I think that
when I finish they're invitingly calm
and peaceful scenes. I live in the
middle of Capitol Hill and I have no
peace. I get into fantasizing about
the place where I'm drawing and it's
a place where I would be relaxed.

BMR: I'd like to get back to the fem-
inist influence on your work. A lot of
times, I don't know how to relate to
a work as feminist.

Trudy: Yes. Unless it says feminist
or it has two women's symbols.

BMR: Right. Or unless there's explicit
female imagery. How do you relate to
that?

Trudy: I worried about that a lot when
I first started drawing. I thought:
I'm a feminist; I should be making
feminist statements. I finally con-
vinced myself that it's enough of a
feminist statement for a woman to draw
and try to sell her art and say: my
work is real good and it's worthy.

BMR: How long have you been drawing
seriously?

Trudy: I drew through college and I
just stopped out of mediocre artist
syndrome. For the last two years I've really
been working on it and saying things
like: I have to do two hours a day of
pen and ink lessons. I have to set
little goals for myself sort of like
classroom assignments.

It's hard for me to talk about art
because I feel really inferior because
I don't have a college education in
art. I majored in history and I didn't
take art courses in college. I felt too
intimidated to go into an art class. I
never took art in college because
of my high school experience which
consisted of a male teacher working
with the boys in class, helping them
get their portfolios together for art
school, and setting up still-lives for
the girls to do. The girls could do
nice little color things to give to
their friends or parents but the bril-
liant art students were the boys and
I came out of there feeling that I was
a mediocre artist. And what does the
world need? It does not need another
mediocre artist. It took me a long
time to get over that and start draw-
ing and part of the reason I got over
it was that I realized I could do
anything I wanted to. It isn't just
boys who are good at art. I can be too.
I got a lot of confidence from femi-
nism. I felt more secure. I don't have
to do what the boys do to be a good
artist. I don't have to meet their
standards. I can draw landscapes and
be happy with them.

BMR: Are you producing lots of draw-
ings and how much time do you spend on
each one?

Trudy: It takes me a long time to pro-
duce something that I'm pleased with.
I worked for four months to get eight
drawings that I was satisfied with to
hang up at Elrond's. I spend maybe
ten, sometimes twenty hours on a draw-
ing. Sometimes I'll obsess with one
for a month before I finish it: just
putting it away and saying I can't do
this anymore and getting angry because
it doesn't look the way I want it to
look.

BMR: There are so few lines and marks
in most of your drawings that they
wouldn't seem to take that much time
to do.

Trudy: Yeah. But it's putting them
down in the right place and deciding
where is the right place. Like the one
that I like the best with the tele-
phone poles. I would like to do that
with about half as many lines, so that
it looks more open. I started again about four years
ago drawing and doing scratchboards
and from that I went into pen and ink.
