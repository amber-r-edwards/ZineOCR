FEN’s Vision Warps Feminist Goals

Editors Note: This is the second
part of what was to be a two-part
series adapted from a 32-page re-
search paper by Martha Shelley.
However, due to the length of the
article, we have decided to run it
in three parts. This month we also
received an article from Olivia
Records in response to Martha's
paper. We will run Olivia's article
next month with the last part of
Martha's paper. Keep this issue
and the March issue as references
for Olivia's critique of Martha's
critique of FEN.

Detroit FFCU

To understand the Feminist Economic
Network (FEN), you have to understand
credit unions.

A credit union is a cooperative
bank, entitled to hold people's sav-
ings and give out loans. Credit
unions are legally defined as co-ops,
and charters are issued to groups
which can claim a certain "field of
membership." Feminist credit unions
are a new thing and the bond of
“feminism” is not yet understood by
the government. A credit union is
not allowed to make loans to corpor-
ations; only to individuals.

The Detroit FFCU has one annual
membership meeting, and the decisions
are made entirely by the Board of
Directors. In contrast, the Bay Area

FFCU (San Francisco, Ca.) makes a
policy of not taking the director-
ships seriously, insists on decisions
being made at a semi-monthly meeting
to which all members are invited.

In January of 1976, the Detroit FFCU
voted to expand its charter to 13 mid-
western states. Laura Brown told
members of the Women's Press Collec-
tive that such an expansion would not
have precluded other women from start-
ing credit unions in those states.

A friend at BAFFCU told me: "The
idea of 13 branches in the Midwest
would not legally preclude other women
in those states from starting credit
unions, but would make it difficult if
not impossible for them to start 'fem-
inist' credit unions. They would have
to prove to the National Credit Union
Association that their field of mem-
bership and Detroit's were not over-
lapping."

"If the 13-state charter had been
granted, members of those credit
unions would have no power--even if
they had representatives visiting
Detroit on occasion. They wouldn't
have the money to go to Detroit all
the time and attend board meetings.

“Laura and Barbara were involved
in trying to organize BAFFCU but they
left when it became collective."

Why did Laura and Barbara try to
get into BAFFCU, and why are they
interested in credit unions? They
were unable to get bank loans to
expand their operations, since the
OFWHC is a non-profit corporation--
it is not legally their property. A
capitalist entrepreneur needs credit.

They were successful in controlling
the Detroit FFCU. This is the inside
story, as told to me by a former DFFCU
worker Stephanie Whitman: "I spent
more and more time at the credit union
until all of a sudden the credit union
was my life; but I found that I was
being manipulated and dictated to.

"I should say that Joanne and
Valerie are the founders of the DFFCU
and credit shouldn't be denied them
for the good that they have done.

"In 1974, Joanne and Valerie went
to California and came back high off
of OFWHC hierarchy, militarism, the
idea of people who do the most work

across the country should make the
decisions. This pissed me off because I'd been work-
ing real hard as a volunteer, and my
work wasn’t counted as worthy of
decision-making status.

"Then, one by one, women started
dropping by the wayside. At least
28 women dropped out before the
founding of FEN, through fights with
Joanne and Valerie. Their personal-
ities interfered with work getting
done.

“I decided to leave the credit union
and return to school. I went to work
for the Ann Arbor credit union.

Joanne and Valerie didn't react when
I told them, it didn't seem to make
a difference to them. They were
dictating policy to Ann Arbor.

“Lots of people in Ann Arbor were
pissed about the matter of autonomy.

"The DFFCU had an annual membership
meeting in January 1976. It was
time to elect a new board. Joanne
and Valerie had been putting out the
idea of expansion; they wanted to set
up an office in Missouri. People
objected to this because they couldn't
handle the branch in Ann Arbor. Mean-
while Debra Law was in Missouri. They
actually opened the Missouri branch
without anyone's knowledge, which is
totally illegal. The National Credit
Unions Ass'n later came down on them
for it.

"They stacked the newly elected
board in their favor so that they had a
quorum. Balloting was by paper and
was supposed to happen on the spot.
FEN supporters counted the votes.

Two anti-FEN women got on the board.
Afterwards, the ballots disappeared.
"After this, five members of the
DFFCU board resigned in protest. Mem-
bers of the credit union organized a
letter-writing campaign to the Nation-

al Credit Union Association and to
feminist organizations, protesting the
proposed expansion. The FEN women
later called this campaign, ‘going to
the Man.'"

FEN Corporate Structure

With all this in mind, we look at
the formation of the Feminist Economic
Network in Detroit, November 1975.
About 75 women met in Detroit, repre-
senting feminist credit unions from
The Detroit FFCU
presented what were later adopted as
the FEN bylaws.

There was a split, FEN was formed by
Diana, the Oakland Feminist Women's
Health Center (OFWHC), the Detroit
FFCU, some women from the Washington
Area FFCU, and Yew Moon (a publica-
tion). Eleven other feminist credit
unions formed the Feminist Economic
Alliance, which ratified a statement
in favor of grass-roots decision
making.

FEN Association
(non-profit).

The FEN Association was the umbrella
organization, the holding corporation
for all the other enterprises. It
was set up as non-profit since a pro-
fit-making corporation cannot own a
credit union (non-profit). Its pur-
poses, as stated in the articles of
incorporation, are: 1) to provide
economic development and accept fi-
nancial leadership for the Feminist
Movement; 2) to offer education and
training to Feminist members, both
individual persons and corporate
entities of FEN; 3) to invest in pro-
fit and non-profit business enter-
prises operated by and for the Femin-
ist Movement.

The FEN Association could thus
legally own the Detroit FFCU. It
owned the FEN Corporation (profit),
and through FEN Corp., it owned Diana
Press, Cal-Fem (which controlled the
OFWHC), and the Detroit Feminist
Women's City Club. The FEN Associa-
tion also could own the FEN Institute
(non-profit).

Direct ownership may not have been
necessary for some of these corpora-
tions, since they had “interlocking
directorates." That is, Laura Brown,
Debra Law, Casey Czarnik, Coletta
Reid, Joanne Parrent, Valerie Angers,
and whoever else was in cahoots with
them were on the Board of Directors
of all of these corporations.

This is a summary of the purposes
of the FEN Corporation, taken from its
articles: to operate and invest in
business enterprises; to sponsor man-
agement training and do business
consulting; to provide health care
services; to invest in and engage in
business of any type, by itself or
through subsidiaries; to manage or
administer businesses of any kind; to
own, buy and sell stocks and bonds;
to buy, sell, build and manage real
estate and estates; to buy assets and
property of every kind; to borrow and
lend money and property; to own any
kind of subsidiaries; to consolidate
or merge with any other business or
corporations.

In other words, the “matriarchal
vision" boils down to a giant holding
company, a multinational conglomerate
with Laura Brown at the head of it:
Don't cry, "holding companies are
illegal." The FEN women will dismiss
you by saying, “That's patriarchal
law. What does it have to do with
us?"

But law or no law, the only purpose
of holding companies and interlocking
directorates is to consolidate power
in the hands of a few. It is not
as the FEN women claim, to put power
into the hands of all women.

Detroit FWHC

Before we discuss the purchase and
operation of the Detroit building
which was called the Feminist Women's
City Club, we must introduce the De-
troit Feminist Women's Health Center.
The FEN women badmouth the Detroit
FWHC as an all-white preserve run by
volunteer labor. The women who work
at the Detroit Center tell me they
are not all white, and they all get
paid the minimum wage according to
Michigan law.

Laura and her supporters claim that
they set up the Downtown DFWHC in
opposition to this--that the Downtown
Center was owned by Black women who
were paid, who could not afford to be
doing volunteer work. Cathy Courtney's
testimony. The three Black women who
opened the Downtown DFWHC are Pam
Carter, Faye Roberts, and Jenette
Salter. They were also part of the
group of eight who took out the loans
to purchase the City Club.

Cathy Courtney was trained at the
OFWHC from June through December 1973.
By December she was utterly demoral-
ized by the OFWHC, working 14 hours a
day and not receiving validation for
her work. She says she still felt
that a health center and good women's
health care was more important than
personal fights with individuals.

She opened the Detroit FWHC in Jan-
uary 1974, getting encouragement from
Valerie Angers and Joanne Parrent at
the DFFCU.

In March 1976, she went on a tour
of the health centers of California.

Cathy did not know that three women
from Detroit--Pam, Faye and Jenette--
were being trained in Oakland. She
was hoping that her own health center
would move into the building and she
had been giving training to these
three women. She tried to reach the
Health Center, but no one would talk
to her. They put her on hold and
never answered the phone. She called
Carol Downer in Los Angeles who said,
"You aren't welcome there. They don't
want to see you."

"I can't believe I'm not welcome,"
Cathy replied. "Alana, Marie Baker
and Debra Law are all friends of
mine.”

She made an appointment under an
assumed name. She had a vaginal in-
fection--a genuine one.

In the OFWHC clinic, Barbara
walked up to Cathy, saying, "What the
fuck are you doing here? You got a
lot of gall. Get out of here.”

Argument ensued. Barbara grabbed
Cathy's chart. Push came to shove,
shove came to blows, then Cathy was
pushed down the stairs. Barbara re-
fused to let her back in the Health
Center. Outside the Center, Cathy
wanted to talk, wanted to know why
Detroit was being excluded. They
argued about the training of Pam,
Faye and Jenette, the Federation of
FWHC's which had been formed, the
Detroit Women's City Club, the FEN
Conference and the split between the
Los Angeles FWHC and Oakland.

Cathy, Jackie and Irene of the De-
troit FWHC attended the first FEN
conference, and it was made clear to
them that they were going to be writ-
ten off as "volunteer labor, down-
wardly mobile middle-class women's
group" unless they supported FEN.

The conference was taped.

Cathy: "The combination of a year's
worth of lies and distortions against
other FWHC's by Oakland, a bad-rap-
ping of all other women's projects
that aren't business-efficient and
centrally-controlled, the hostility
and unaccountability at the FEN Con-
ference, deceptions in the name of
feminism regarding the City Club and
the Credit Union, and that final vio-
lent break in Oakland destroyed any
future relationship between the
Detroit FWHC and Oakland, and all
subsequent FEN dealings.

"The Detroit FWHC believes that
this is not the end of FEN and this
is not an isolated incident. Female
entrepreneurs can expropriate women's
labor and resources in any American
capitalist city."

Later on, the Black women were to
say that they had been caught between
power struggles of White women's
groups.

Women’s City Club

On March 8, 1976, the Detroit FFCU
loaned eight women $32,000 each, for
a total of $256,000. In order to do
this, the credit union borrowed
$200,000 from the Michigan Credit
Union League.

The eight women turned their loans
over to FEN, and the building was pur-
chased for cash, on the very same day.
This was a way for the FEN Corporation
to circumvent the law which prohibits
credit unions from making loans to
corporations.

The Detroit credit union has been
criticized for this loan, since it
would have received only 4.5% inter-
est, and the current rate of infla-
tion is well above that--however,
they were netting 4.5% on money that
wasn't theirs.

The catch came when the eight women
defaulted, through FEN, and the credit
union repossessed the building. The
Detroit FFCU was then responsible to
pay back the loans--not as Laura
Brown told us, the male-turned
finance company. The insurance company
is only liable if the credit union
goes bankrupt. If the credit union
was then unable to sell the building
for the full amount of the loans, they
would have been obliged to make up
the difference out of their own funds.

Women were hired to work in the
City Club and prepare it for the grand
opening. One of them was Lee Kefauver.
Her statement follows: "I did
not hear about FEN through the women's
movement but through an ad in the pa-
pers. I am a member of the credit
union but was completely un-knowledge-
able about anything. I applied and
found out that Val and Joanne were
