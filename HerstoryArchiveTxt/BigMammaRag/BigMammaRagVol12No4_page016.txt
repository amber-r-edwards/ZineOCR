"Luisa Amanda Espinosa").

organization born during the
insurrection leading to the
victory of the Sandinistas
in July, 1979. The associa-
tion is named after the first
woman militant to die in bat-
tle during the revolutionary
struggle.

"The enormous strength of
the feminist movement in the
United States and in Western
Europe can't help but influ-
ence contemporary people's
revolutions," Boesing said.
"Through our own feminist
movement, we have had an im-
pact on the Nicaraguan revo-
lution..."

The collaborative process
used by At The Foot of the
Mountain reflects Nicaraguan
organizational principles.
All the performers, managers
and directors participated
in various aspects of re-
search, writing and produc-
tion of Las Gringas. Each
performer created her charac-
ters and together the per-
formance company integrated
the characters with each
other.

All of the women involved
in Las Gringas hope the
piece will change the way
people view the Americas.
"I want people to stop recog-
nizing the boundaries that
exist between the United
States and Managua," Wi
said. "I want people to see that we are
literally connected to one
another, part of the same
organism."

The company believes that
we are the modern day con-
quistadors when we allow
our government to repress
liberation struggles that
are contrary to U.S. corpor-
ate and philosophical inter-
ests. Substantial numbers
of North Americans live in
relative comfort because
our corporations have taken
Central America away from
its people and turned it
into a U.S. support resource.
"We have created Las Gringas,"
Boesing said, "because we
want to convince people that
greed must cease to be the
motivation for life on the
planet."

and support the organizing by the APSP and the Committee in
Solidarity with African Independence, we also believe that
Linda Leaks, Ajowa Ifateyo and Paye Williams have not lied
about "Waller's...brutal exploitation of black women."
This does not negate the relevant and important work the
APSP & CSAT have done. They have organized projects in the
black communities on housing,
childcare
just to name two
projects which have directly met the needs of the people.
We have also heard & read many accounts of Omali's
brutalization and must believe these are true.

Obviously this conflict has not been resolved. Big Mama
Rag has a responsibility to present all sides of this
struggle, now that it has been brought forward and opened
to the white women's movement.
As for the women's movement,
newsjournal...let me
as for Big Mama Rag-feminist
say...we hope to see you at the commu-
nity meeting...we want to see your support for the paper...
we need to see your participation in order to continue.

Breathing, Walking Late At Night

I get so frustrated.
Help, I'm being held prisoner by exhaust fumes.
I avoid going outside unless necessary,
until 10:00 pm when Nature calls me out to Her Pleasures.
In the day, with the cars lined up
a wall of destruction,
blocking my path,
fuming poison in my face.

Every place I walk smells like sulfur dioxide,
carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide,
or whatever toxins those damn cars are spewing out.
I'm trapped. Walled in. Can't breathe.
Hold my breath.

I cross the street and the car pulls out to take the turn
first;

leaving me walking through its poison
diffusing into my lungs.

My? ans.
Gets me so mad,
Damn car manufacturers,
transportation.
Cost me the life of my dearest friend.
Keeps me so very mad.

producing dangerous, toxic
me inside
with my windows open
exercising on an indoors stand for my bicycle.
Some fun,
pedaling away and getting nowhere.

It's a quarter to twelve midnight.
Is it too late for a nice walk in the hills?
Ten blocks away, the hills
where rich people live,
much less cars on the streets,
no through traffic,
air sweet as paradise,
ocean winds blown through the Presidio forests.

But it scares me to walk late at night,
Late at night when Nature calls lush and sensual.
Number one, I'm afraid of getting raped, mugged, stabbed,
or murdered.
Number two, I'm afraid of catching heat with the cops,
an unsavory looking character like me
in my black leather jacket,
one of the only people for blocks and blocks
in rich people's neighborhood.

Out on their streets, with their BMWs,
their Mercedes Benz, Porsches, Lincoln Continentals
and occasional Mazdas.
Walking the hills late at night,
Looking in front, looking behind, listening for steps,
Alert to anyone's presence,
Thinking, Goddess, one day we will reclaim our home.
One day, fresh air will be my birthright.
One day, the circle will turn back to Life.
Not now,
now, as someone drives by,
putting that wretched smell into my lungs.

One
One
But
Not
