California Clinics Come Under Attack

Eileen Schnitger and  
Camilla Cracchiolo

In the week of April 6,  
1981, the California Feminist  
Women's Health Centers in  
Chico, Los Angeles, Santa Ana  
and San Diego, received let-  
ters from the California De-  
partment of Health Services  
cancelling their contracts  

self-help  

for family planning funds.  
This is not a routine budget  
cut; rather, this is an at-  
tack by the medical estab-  
lishment against the "parti-  
cipatory clinic", which in-  
volves lay women delivering  
health services and the  
sharing of self-cervical  
examination.

The Feminist Women's Health  
Centers provide non-tradi-  
tional health care in the  
participatory clinic. In par-  
ticipatory clinics, a woman  
has the opportunity to gain  
greater reproductive control  
by learning cervical and  
vaginal self-examination,  
doing her own urine pregnan-  
cy test and making her own  
informed consent about what  
tests and exams she will  
have. Safe methods of birth  
control such as the cervical  
cap are available. Women  
coming to the participatory  
clinic share information  
with each other, do self  
exams in the groups so as to  
see the range of normal, and  
learn from one another. This  
is done with the assistance  
of a lay health worker who  
has been trained in the  
Self-Help Clinic. Health pro-  
fessionals in the participa-  
tory group do general physi-  
cal examinations and are  
available for consultation.

In addition to this most  
recent attack, the Chico  
Feminist Women's Health  
Center has been the victim  
of an undercover investiga-  
tion by the Attorney Gener-  
al's Office, Medi-Cal Fraud  
Unit (Medi-Caid). Investiga-  
tors, who are ex-police of-  
ficers, have gone door to  
door harassing Medi-Cal re-  
cipients who received ser-  
vices at the Chico FWHC. The  
Medi-Cal investigation  
was purposely launched over  
the issue of how the Chico  
FWHC billed their lab work,  
which has never been question-  
ed in the past. Although the  

investigator who came to the  
clinic was never able to say  
what regulations were being  
violated by this billing pro-  
cedure, the investigation con-  
tinues to escalate. The issue  
of billing Medi-Cal for ser-  
vices provided by lay health  
workers in conjunction with  
licensed personnel (common  
practice in doctors' offices  
and clinics throughout the  
state) has taken the center  
of the investigators' concern.  
For months, women have been  
contacted at their homes by  
phone and in person by the in-  
vestigators. Clients were  
shown "mug shot" type pic-  
tures of health workers and  
told they were looking for  
"fraud". No official charges,  
fraud or otherwise, have been  
brought. Some women in Chico  
believe that the Federal Anti-  
trust suit brought by the  
Chico FWHC against the local  
medical society and local OB/  
GYNs may have contributed  

to the investigation being  
launched.

The Department of Health  
Services has been fully aware  
of services at the Feminist  
Women's Health Centers. Mem-  
bers of the Centers have had  
extensive meetings with offi-  
cials from the Department, at  
their own expense, and have  
drawn up detailed documenta-  
tion of the tasks and train-  
ing of the lay health workers  
in the "Clinic Guidelines".  
These Guidelines detail the  
exact practices of health  
workers in the clinic and the  
State of California has had  
these protocols since August  
1978. Two women physicians,  
Dr. Lyn Headley and Dr.  
Josette Mondonaro, from the  
Department of Health Services  
have conducted site visits  
of the clinics. In her re-  
port to the Dept. of Health,  
Dr. Headley stated: "I have  
witnessed in my visits to  
the four clinics an effort  
in this latter area (a wo-  
man's awareness of a change  
in her body from the normal  
state) which far exceeds that  
in the traditional medical  
setting...I think that the  
self-help clinics could give  
better care to women than  
traditional clinics."

Why are the Feminist Wo-  
men's Health Centers being  
attacked? It's no secret that  
the traditional medical es-  
tablishment stands to lose  
business with the growth of  
the Self-Help movement. As  

women do self-exam, menstrual  
extraction, use home remedies  
for common vaginal conditions  
and have babies at home, less  
money goes to the OB/GYNs--  
and less power.

Some people are suspicious  
that conservative proponents  
of medical monopoly in the  
Department of Health and in  
the State bureaucracy, such  
as Lt. Governor Mike Curb,  
are attempting to discredit  
and remove from power propo-  
nents of progressive and al-  
ternative health care, such  
as Beverlee Myers, Director  
of the Department of Health  
Services and Governor Jerry  
Brown.

An article in the latest  
New West magazine shows evi-  
dence of this. In the article  
"Practicing at Medicine",  
author Kathy McManus severe-  
ly distorts every aspect of  
the Health Centers, from  
health care to the Feminist  
Women's Health Centers' meet-  

ings with Department of  
Health Services representa-  
tives.

Using information leaked  
from an undercover investiga-  
tor, believed to be named  
Avis Bowser and who may be  
from the Department of Health  
Services, the article appears  
to be striking out directly  
at Brown and Myers and play-  
ing into the hands of Mike Curb.  
The article states that Myers,  
a Brown appointee, was the  
sole reason all clinics got  
funded in 1980 and incorrect-  
ly claims this action was  
against state regulations.

When representatives of the  
Health Centers tried to find  
out exactly what complaints  
there have been, if any,  
against them, they have been  
told that all this informa-  
tion is strictly confidential  
and cannot be divulged to  
anyone; yet when it suits pro-  
ponents of traditional health  
care, apparently it is fine  
to tell the news media!

Community Support from page 5

The easiest to deal with  
was the financial end of  
things, and yet that was no  
easy task. That we knew we  
had a collective responsibil-  
ity to make a financial com-  
mitment towards ensuring care  
and housing for any of the  
women who were ill seemed  
like no big deal. And yet,  
we struggled with our own  
class biases which would  
have us sitting on our mon-  
ey, trying to give freely.  
The women on the receiving  
end found their physical de-  
pendence compounded by fin-  
ancial dependency.

But we did good work and  
we parted with time and mon-  
ey as it seemed necessary.

We organized benefits and  
came together in support  
groups, and established in-  
formation networks.

We remember the struggle to  
maintain our political pro-  
jects...wondering if the pa-  
per would make it to press,  
or if the bookstore would  
be able to meet its 9 to 5  
schedule. We kept on having  
"political meetings" that  
fell apart into news updates  
on the status of the women  
who were ill--and how we were  
maintaining ourselves as  
supporters. Talking of panic  
and death. Or, we would find  
ourselves at meetings where  

we would run the "agenda"  
into the dirt--trying to use  
the political process to go  
ahead with something normal,  
to get a break from the con-  
stant focus on sickness. A  
few meetings were ram-rodded  
through that never should  
even have occurred. And,  
then sometimes we would luck  
and our politics and pro-  
cess would give us a space  
to deal with some of the em-  
otional issues--the guilt--to  
give and take was real.  
The individual solution  
sometimes sounded a lot  
more appealing and easier  
out.

We did fight back against  
the medical system. We did  
organize, did give support,  
did make connections between  
the personal and the politi-  
cal. Today in memory of all  
women who have struggled a-  
gainst the oppression of  
traditional medical care...  
We demand our right to a  
health care system that meets  
the needs of the sick over  
the desires of the doctors or  
the state! We demand qual-  
ity health care now! We  
commit ourselves and the  
feminist press to this issue,  
to a feminist vision of  
health care and the right  
to control of our bodies!
