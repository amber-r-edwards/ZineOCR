Woman To Woman Conflict

political. The collective
became a loose-knit group
that did not require women
who staffed to come to meet-
ings or women who came to
meetings to staff. Anyone
attending the regular weekly
meetings had a voice in de-
cision making and once a de-
cision was made it could be
unmade the following week,
depending on who was there.
Decisions were sometimes
painfully slow in coming and

issues sometimes were not
dealt with well or even dealt
with. At different times the
center housed a switchboard
for information, resources
and aid, a library and a
school.

The center has had prob-
lems not only in staffing
but book-ordering. Attempts
had been made to update the
political books but many
women felt that lesbian books
took priority and that books
dealing with women of color
or Jewish women were a low
priority.

An attempt has been made
to write the above article
clearly, stating the issues
but everyone knows that when
racism and anti-Semitism is
actively being practiced
that anger is also present.
The meetings showed emotions
ran high with women feeling
angry, frustrated and betrayed.

Women of color and Jewish
women demand that the center
meet their needs, that before
only tokenism had been given
them and they were treated
as if they didn't exist, at
best insensitively and ig-
nored, and worse, as if they
didn't matter. The women are
rightfully demanding that
the center function for all
women and they are going to
stay around and make sure
that happens.

I think we, who are white
women, have to realize that
when a woman of color or a
Jewish woman says racism or
anti-Semitism we have to stop
and listen. They shouldn't be
the ones to tell us, but if
we are that dense that some-
one points the finger at us,
we better believe it is hap-
pening and that we are in-
volved in it.

I went into the meeting
with good faith; that the
women who presented the paper
and demands weren't running a
game on the center and that

the former collective members
wanted to stop their racism,
anti-Semitism. In the times
we are now facing, with the
Right gleefully taking away
their past favors to some
women, the rise of a new
open wave of anti-Semitism
and the ever-onward move of
racism, we have to start
facing the issues openly and
actively in our movement.
The women who are making de-
mands on the center are mak-
ing demands in the movement
as well.

I am critical of having a
paid staffwoman. I don't be-
lieve one woman should be
paid for a political project
while the rest of us give our
time and energy for no pay.

I don't like to see women
make money being political,
it ties in too closely with
capitalism. The staffer be-
comes a paid employee and we
know how employees are treat-
ed; with a lot of demands,

no benefits and even if the
staffer is on the collective,
she will be the one with day
to day responsibilities,
making decisions that will
reflect on the collective

and project. The woman most
visible will be identified as
the center, rather than many
staffers sharing not only

the problems but the identity.
There is also the reality that
when you have one woman doing
the bulk of the visible work,
the other collective members
don't have to do that work,
and since our projects take
our extra time, it is kind of
cushy to be relieved of any of
our responsibilities and still
have the work done.

The center is going to have
to toe a fine line; if it is
a collective it must not try
to think of itself as a bus-
iness. There is no way that
the two processes can be re-
conciled. Business is there
to make money, push a product,
oppress the employees and be
accountable to the ones in
charge. Feminist collective
process must be accountable
to the feminist community;
which means holding community
meetings, printing its
finances, publishing points
of unity, open to community
input, using criticism/self
criticism and in the center's
instance, containing books
and materials that further
feminism but might not make

money. There is always the
problem of calling yourself

a collective but in truth
having a hierarchical structure.
The alternative paper that
was read at the meeting as
well as the demands presented
used the word empowerment, in
a true collective the proc-
ess should make sure that
everyone shares in that type
of power. Sharing work and
information and visibility

is the best way of cutting
individual power. And let's not
kid ourselves, as soon as
money comes into the arena of
projects, it does make a dif-
ference. We are so geared to
evaluate ourselves through
the money process, I cert-
ainly feel better about my-
self now that I make $6 per
hour than when I made $4.50,
regardless of inflation or
any other considerations, I
feel better about myself and
that is stupid, but it is
there and real.

I had been a paid staffer
with two groups of which I
was also on the Board of Dir-
ectors. They were not femin-
ist groups, but even so,
there was personal conflict,
alienation and from the other
directors, a smugness that
was real hard to deal with.
As any good employee I was
expected to do what I was
told and I was suddenly view-
ed not quite as competent as
I had been before, when I

from page 5

wasn't being paid (employees
are never as smart as the
bosses).

One interesting comment
was made at the meeting when
we were talking about finan-
ces. Someone suggested a let-
ter be written to suppliers
explaining that the center
was going through changes,
and the assumption was that
feminist suppliers would be

more understanding (we are

all feminists) and someone
else said that had been done
in the past and they had been
told by some feminist sup-
pliers that they were also
women's businesses.

In this whole upheaval
there has been very little
mention of classism. Class-
ist attitudes have existed.
I have felt it. Some women's
privilege, money and educ-
ation has certainly influ-
enced the way past collect-
ives handled the center.

My expectations are that
those who will run the cen-
ter had better give the
issue of classism as much
emphasis as racism and
anti-Semitism or the ex-
clusion of women will con-
tinue.

Instead of an ending
paragraph, I hope this is a
beginning. I wish the form-
ing new collective well, be-
cause if they get it togeth-
er we will all benefit.

Court, we have proof that the venerable justices don't

need much help as it is. In one week, they ruled women

out of the draft, and then turned around to slap ex-wives

of ex-military men by denying them a fair share of retire-
ment benefits. And in the Senate, a conservative coalition
voted to slash federally subsidized housing and withhold

federal funds from cities with rent control measures.

Of

course, this will affect only those who need somewhere
to live - like some 32,000 women who head their house-
