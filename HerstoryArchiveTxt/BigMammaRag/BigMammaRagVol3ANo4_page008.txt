Robin Morgan in Colorado Springs  
“Ejaculatory” Politics Ignores  

the “Oldest Oppression...  

Shirl Kasper  

Radical feminist Robin  
Morgan told Colorado College  
women last month that it’s time  
to dig in for the long battle for  
women’s rights — a struggle she  
says will take time, but one that  
ultimately will end in victory.  

The noted poet and editor of  

“Sisterhood is Powerful” spoke  
of patience and commitment,  
reminding her audience that  
“we are taking on 12,000 years  
of patriarchy” and “it’s going to  
take time.”  
Ms. Morgan decried the  
“ejaculatory style of revolution”  
characteristic of the male-  
dominated new left, and  
pinpointed that movement's  
impatience as the reason it is  
floundering.  

She called on feminists to “dig  

in for the long haul” and to work  
to change the system from the  
grass roots out.  

“In the new left you were not  
making long-rooted, dug-in,  
committed structures either in  
yourself or with other people to  
take over the system that was  
oppressing you,” Ms. Morgan  
explained. “You thought — if it  
didn't happen in a year it wasn’t  
going to happen.  

“But radical feminists (many  
of whom came out of the new  
left) have finally unleashed  
themselves from that kind of  
attitude and are digging in for  
the long haul.”  

Root of Oppression

Women’s Center  

Fire Bombed  

The Women’s Center of St.  
Louis was firebombed on  
January 30, 1975. For a year,  
the Lesbian-Feminist Center had  
worked to restore the old  
building to provide the only  
exclusively women’s center in  
the metropolitan area. It had  
included a coffeehouse, library,  
legal office, recreation room and  
support group room as well as  
“Moonstorm,” a lesbian per-  
iodical.  

The group did not learn of the  
destruction of the Center until  
more than 8 hours after it took  
place. Some time during that  
interval, someone gained access  
to the burned building and stole  
files from the Center's second  
floor offices.  

“The building was burned at  
12:00 midnight, yet no one was  
notified until 11:00 the next  
day," said one member of the  
group. “We have good reason to  
believe the owner did this, but  
are still confused as to why our  
files would have been tampered  
with unless the pigs were  
involved. The F.B.I. and the Red  

Squad have been around a  
couple of times.  

“Lesbian Alliance is the strong-  
est woman's group in St.  
Louis, and I am sure is definitely  
seen as a threat. It is  
discouraging because we have  
had no money... and we had put  
months of labor into this place.  

“There was definite proof of  
an arsonist. Some flammable  
liquid was poured over couches  
and the back steps and windows  
were broken out.”  

The fire destroyed plans to  
purchase the building under an  
option on the lease, and leaves  
the local alliance without a  
meeting place.  

Spokeswomen for the Center  
stated “We refuse to be  
intimidated by acts of violence,  
or to disband due to outside  
pressures.”  

Funds are desperately needed  
for the lease or purchase of a  
new building and furnishings.

shitwork” in the male-  
dominated left, Ms. Morgan  
depicted women as “the oldest  
oppressed people on the face of  
the earth.”  

She cited the oppression of  
women as the model and root for  
all other types of oppression and  
declared: “Until (women’s) is  
solved, all others will be Band-  
Aide revolutions between one  
set of boys and another set of  
boys” — her term for the new  
left.  

She acknowledged that there  
are still “sisters who have a foot  
in the boys’ movement and are  
guilt-tripped into saying, ‘Oh  
God, how can I possibly work for  
women?’  

Well, Ms. Morgan answered,  
“women are only most of the  
human species.”  

Audience Rap  

The feminist rapped with her  
audience from a seat on the edge  
of the stage, bringing students  
up-to-date on the direction of the  
10-year-old movement.  

She told how the movement  
has “snowballed” at a pace,  
width and breadth beyond the  
“wildest dreams” of early  
feminists, and that women’s  
liberation today encompasses  
every race, class and geographic  
segment of women.  

“It's very hard to find a  
stereotyped feminist these  
days,” Ms. Morgan said. “There  
are nuns, prostitutes,  
housewives, professional  
women, high school sisters and  
grammar school sisters.  
Grandmothers, mothers and  
daughters are going in trios to  
consciousness-raising groups.”  

Universal Identity  

She cited the universal  
identity with the Women’s  
Movement as men’s most  
“terrifying dream” — that  
women across the whole stretch  
and width of the globe would get  
involved in women’s lib.  

“And that is just what is  
beginning to happen,” she  
declared. “And there’s no way to  
stop it. We like to think we're the  
women that men warned us  
about.”  

Ms. Morgan said the various  
“wings” of the movement seem

of much less importance to her  
today than they did a few years  
ago, partly because of the  
economic crunch, which has  
made women realize they  
“better hang together or they'll  
hang separately;” and partly  
because there has been a  
radicalization on the part of  
many women in the civil rights  
segment of the movement.  

She cited the birth of the  
National Black Women’s  

Organization, a number of  
Chicana groups and the Native  
American Federation as “the  
single most important” things to  
come about in the movement  
during the past year.  

Growing Issues  

The issues she sees growing  
in the movement today surround  
a consciousness she describes  
as “hard to reach” because the  
issues are not “institutions out  
there” but are “the deadly  
institutions in our brains” —  
such as sexuality.  

“Just as men defined what a  
woman should be, say and do in  
other areas,” he defined her  
sexuality as well, Ms. Morgan  
explained.  

“But women are discovering  
in consciousness-raising groups  
that ‘X’ was indeed not the only  
woman who had faked an  
orgasm.” Ms. Morgan says “a  
whole explosion of  
consciousness has come out of  
the affirmation by heterosexuals  
that they want to have an  
emotional sexual relationship on  
their terms.”  

She also praised the “proud  
and glowing affirmation of  
honest, committed and beautiful  
flowering love between women  
as lesbians who have come out  
of the closet.”  

She said women are  
rediscovering themselves and  
their desires and needs in the  
entire area of sexuality. She  
compared women to a colonized  
people who have been alienated  
from their land. In women’s  
case, the land is their body,  
which they have been taught to  
hate.  

“We are beginning to reclaim  
our land,” Ms. Morgan declared.  
“That is one place to start — with  

the temple.”  
Start Within  

Ms. Morgan said women can  
effect change by starting from  
within. That inner change will  
then spread to the block, the city  
and the state — making the kind  
of change that is “most profound  
and lasting.”  

She compared the women’s  
movement to the Civil Rights  
movement, where people  
learned first “how the ripple  
effect moves from the grass  
roots up.” They then concen-  
trated on changing laws.  

Ms. Morgan lauded the  
current explosion in women’s  
Study courses, media  
publications and the like, saying  
they are all necessary if women  
are to rediscover female culture.  

She noted that as women  
unfold their history, they will  
discover that women in ancient  
times had secular and religious  
power and that their societies  
were highly developed, mostly  
vegetarian and unwarlike.  

Metaphysical Revolution  

She stressed that when  
talking about equality, she was  
not speaking of becoming equal  
“with what it is men are and do  
in this culture.”  

“I'm talking about power,” she  
said. “Not power in the way men  
have used it — not Watergate  
kind of power and Cambodia  
kind of power. Not power that  
has the invisible word ‘overt’  
attached to it. I'm talking about  
power of self-determination and  
the power to effect change.”  

She closed with a definition of  
the women’s movement for  
equality as a “metaphysical  
revolution.”  

“Beyond the equal pay for  
equal work, beyond the survival  
measures, beyond protecting  
ourselves and our children, what  
the feminist revolution is at its  
core is a metaphysical  
revolution.  

“Women at this point in  
history are equal bearers in  
existential courage, because for  
our revolutionary cause ... we  
step off into a space that has not  
existed before to name  
oneself, the world, and one’s  
relation with the universe.”  

All Things To All Women  
Tucson Women  

Reorganize Center  

Laurie Ann Ogilvie  

36 Tucson sisters responded  
to the call for action at a  
“Women's Community  
Meeting” held Friday, April 4, at  
7:00 p.m. at Alternatives for  
Women, 40 East 14th St., No. 5,  
Tucson.  

Resolving issues concerning  
the Tucson Women’s Center,  
912. 6th St., and establishing a  
Women’s Switchboard were the  
evening's topics of spirited  
discussion and commitment.  
The Women's Center, at-  
tempting to be all things to all  
women in Tucson, has had its  
share of misfortune. It has  
functioned as a feminist center,  
referral service for rape crises,  
general phone referral service,  
women’s hostel/crash space,  
and home of Tucson’s lesbian  

coffee house and Sunday  
afternoon poetry readings.  
Women attending the  

community meeting determined  
that activities being carried on at  
the Center had by far exceeded  
the bounds of available physical  

space as well as womanpower,  
which is on a volunteer basis. It  
was also determined that to  
better serve the women in  
Tucson, a Women’s Information  
and Referral Service (a Women’s  
Switchboard) would be set up  
using the existing Women’s  
Center phone number (792-  
1929) and moving the Rape  
Crisis and Right-to-Choose lines  
out of the Women’s Center to  
office space at Antigone Books,  
415 N. 4th Ave.  

The necessity of renting st-  
orefront space for other feminist  
business and recreational  
activities was discussed. Also, a  
committee was organized to find  
larger quarters for a new  
women’s hostel/crash space in  
Tucson.  

Money, or rather lack of that  
element, prompted establishing  
fund-raising committees. Expect  
to support benefit concerts,  
variety shows, craft booths at  
local fairs, and dances in Tucson  
to accumulate capital for  
Tucson’s growing feminist  
community needs.
