Yellow Thunder Camp Defies Government

Here in Denver the news me-
dia has given almost no cov-
erage to Yellow Thunder Camp.
We are writing this article
in support of the struggle
of the Lakota Peoples. We
interviewed Shara Griffin,

a white woman who works with
Greenpeace and is one of

the coordinators of the
buffer zone. The buffer zone
is a camp separate from Yel-
low Thunder Camp but in co-
ordination with it. Shara
and her three children are
moving into the buffer zone
this winter.

I have been working with
the Lakota peoples for about
two years now. It started
with a personal relationship
and through that and through
the starving of the old peo-
ple on the reservation last
year, I saw a need and said
I would help. And I have to
say that as an issue for me,
it is one of the beginning
mistakes this country made
and I believe in the Hoop, it
has come back again; every-
thing else has been built on
the attitude of the European
colonialists who came here
and their lack of respect for
all living things, and you
can take that from Indians to
environment and women, every-
thing. There has been an in-
bred lack of respect. The
issues of environment tie in
with the rights of people.
The people are oppressed by a
colonialist system and it is
so obvious when you are on
the reservation, plus the
ties there are real interest-
ing. You start to link up
those people there that are
in solidarity with the El
Salvadorian rebels, the Nic-
araguan people who won their
revolution, with Cuba, with
the PLO, with the Puerto
Rican movement, with the
South African peoples strug-
gles, with the Aboriginal
struggles in Australia and
the indigenous peoples of
Scandinavia and their fight
for self-determination.

Originally we had about 25
people in two camps outside
the perimeter of the 800 acre
claim. Our purpose there was
to make a strong supportive
statement for the peoples
rights in the Camp and to
block the authorities into
the Camp. After the 8th we
consolidated into one camp
with 10 permanent people and

moved inside the perimeter of
the claim. We didn't want to
be removed because we were
camped out on leased forest
land, so we moved in but can
move out so that in times of
emergency we still can be
that front buffer zone.

The buffer zone is a co-
ordinated effort with Green-
peace and American Friends
Service Committee. The people
share responsibility and the
women are taking a definite
lead, myself as an example.

I work in coordination with
Nick Meinhart, director of
Pine Ridge Action Project,
and because we are in an em-
ergency situation, decisions
about strategy are coming
from the coordinators down to
the rest of the people living
in the zone and with Yellow
Thunder Camp and its secur-
ity needs. In order to work
in the buffer zone everyone
has to be screened and that
comes through a committee of
Nick, myself and someone

from the Black Hills Alliance.
Part of our strategy is that
we want to be able to mobil-
ize trained people for emerg-
ency situations. We want to
bring in 50-100 people, in a
day's time, from the Colorado-
California area to blockade
the roads. We will be shortly
running ongoing training ses-
sions to orient people as to
the strategy and how to get
in and out of the buffer zone
if there are roadblocks, but
the people have to be self-
disciplined and committed.
Anyone interested should con-
tact the Black Hills Alliance

When I go to Yellow Thunder
Camp I get a sense of people
who want to reestablish them-
selves as self-sufficient,
dignified human beings. I see
them as desperately trying to
reestablish a traditional
form of life, they are stres-
sing their traditional roles:
men as the provider, warrior,
women as the stability, life-
bringing, nurturing force but
that has been misinterpreted
through the years and there
is a segment of macho att-
itude that has to be dealt
with as in all segments of
society but what outsiders
don't understand is that
women in all Indian societies
I have been in, which includ-
es Iroquois, Hopi, Navajo,
Delaware, women always have
had the decision power. The
men acted upon those decis-
ions to a great degree. The
women in some tribes chose
the chief. That has unfortun-
ately deteriorated over the
years, like many parts of
their culture. Russell Means
said that "...in order to re-
establish this consent, as we
understand it from our elders
and from our culture, the men
are nothing. The women are
the miracle of the body of
life. We serve that purpose".
The women are as dedicated
and as involved in developing
that whole structure as the
men, sometimes they are not
as visible. In the old way
women were in the decision
making but when the U.S. gov-
ernment came in and told the
tribes how to live their
lives, power was placed art-
ificially in the hands of men
but actually in the hands of
the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

The number of children in
Yellow Thunder Camp has grown.
The camp has become a refuge
for homeless children. They
have established a school
which my own children have
been invited to go, in which
everybody is a teacher and
everybody is a student, the
school is for everyone not
only the kids. The man who is
in charge of the school is a
professor who teaches at the
University of Southern Illi-
nois and has established al-
ternative schools in Bolivia
and several other places for
Indian peoples. He has de-
tailed how the American ed-

ucational system came down
from Prussia, who was pre-
paring fodder for the mach-
inery of war and that is what
our whole system is based on.

Right now the people have
many needs. It is going to
be a long hard winter by the
signs the old people read and
the government's tactic from
day one has been to starve
and freeze out and that's
what we believe they are go-
ing to do instead of forcibly
taking them out. They want to
let the number of people
dwindle enough and then they
can go in and get them out.
So we have to deal with a
winter situation. They had a
garden, they have a root
cellar, a few chickens, a
solar food dryer and solar
showers. They have a complete
proposal for building a self-
sufficient community but it is
not possible under the present
circumstances. This is a
struggle of life and death.
So in order to get through
the winter they need money to
winterize the tepees, because
the government has said if
they put any permanent struc-
tures in the ground they will
remove them, so it has to be
non-permanent structures to
get through the winter.

Besides money the people
need warm adult and children's
clothes (ages 1-17): winter-
ized boots, heavy coats, hats,
scarves, gloves, sweaters,
mittens, pants. They need
basic foods; canned goods, tea,
meat, potatoes, onions, rice,
beans, lots of coffee, sugar,
cigarettes, flour, baking pow-
der, salt, cooking oils, nuts
and apples. The list goes on,
winterized sleeping gear,
blankets, lanterns, flash-
lights, walkie-talkies, power
packs, batteries, CBs, and
tools: wood saws, hammers,
nails and wood stoves. If
people would contact me -
through Rocky Mountain Green-
peace, 2029 E. 13th Ave.,
Denver, Colo. 80206 (303-

will be given to Yellow
Thunder Camp.

Before the Sept. 8 crisis,
the people in Yellow Thunder
Camp had decided they were
not going to do any more legal
fighting, they had been doing
it for 113 years and they
were plain sick and tired of
it, they were going to make
