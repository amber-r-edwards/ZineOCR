I Never Got To Say ‘Bye To My Babies

Rachel Budman

Several months ago I was
asked if I would like to
write an article about a
group that I belong to called
Mothers Without Custody.

children and stop crying,
but instead I got worse and
worse. At the end of 3
months it was my youngest
son's birthday and I couldn't
bear the aching in my
heart any longer. I called

mothers without custody

Like to? I'd love to! But
where would I start and
where would I stop?! I real-
ized that the only way I
could write about this group
would be to include my own
experience that led me to
become a mother without cus-
tody. The following is a
condensed glimpse of my life
and the life of “the group"
from my perspective:

I came from a time when
society said that a woman
who didn't bear children was
unnatural. So I had 3 beau-
tiful ones and a violence-
filled marriage that lasted
for 10 years. I loved my
children dearly and prayed
that something would happen
to my husband so I could
raise my kids in peace. I
had no idea how to go about
getting a separation so I
asked my mother for help.
She told me that there are
just some things that a wo-
man has to put up with in
this life. So I went home
and tried to be a good girl
and not provoke my husband
until I decided that I'd ra-
ther be dead than go on like
this. I was 32 years old and
had never been on my own in
my entire existence.

In August, 1974, I ran
away from home, with $2.00
in my pocket and the clothes
on my back. I didn't stop
until I got from Ft. Lauder-
dale, Fla. to Los Angeles,
California! I thought that
if I could make it to the
other coast that he'd never
find me and kill me as he'd
threatened to do for so
long. I never got to say
goodbye to my babies who
were 3, 5, and 7 years old
and sound asleep when I
left.

I spent 3 months wander-
ing the streets of Califor-
nia and thinking that any
minute the world would open
up and suck me inside and I
would never have to feel
pain again. I thought I
could forget that I had

to wish him a happy birthday
(really just to hear his
voice) but I was not allowed
to speak to him. I then cal-
led my parents and asked
them if I could come back.
By then I was a complete e-
motional and physical wreck.
I must have spent at least
75% of every day and night
crying, I was running a fe-
ver of 101 and I was numb
inside. My father paid for a
return ticket and sent my
husband to meet me, thinking
that I had gotten "over my
phase" and was coming back
where I belonged.

The last confrontation
that we had, when I left,
sent me flying across the
room at the end of his fist
and I certainly did not ex-
pect to see him when I got
off that plane! His first
words to me were that we were
going to court the next day
and being divorced. He needed
my signature to buy an expen-
sive house that I did not
want, so he charged me with
desertion so we could be di-
vorced and he could buy the
house on his own and THEN we
could get married again! All
I could hear was DIVORCE. I
was finally going to be rid
of him! I had absolutely no
idea that I was going to lose
my kids. I went to court with
him (in the ruined state that
my body was in) and HIS law-
yer and no one on my side...

The mother shall have
"reasonable" visitation
rights..... I couldn't believe
my ears and I couldn't even
cry in front of all those men
in the courtroom! I waited
until we got outside and
broke down completely. Three
days later my ex-husband and
my mother had me committed to
a psychiatric hospital. This
began my life filled with
drugs to get me to stop cry-
ing, to get me to behave;
psychiatrists that tried to
get me to bed; threats from
my ex-husband that if I didn't
come back to him he would

kill himself, the kids, me;
he'd move so far away that
I'd never see "his" children
again.

For the next few years, I
was in and out of the mental
hospital, living in the
street, in the back of vans,
in my car, in jail for steal-
ing food, shunned by my fam-
ily for the most part, and
desperately trying to deal
with maintaining some kind of

relationship with my children
who were desperately trying to
deal with the violence around
them. I was living a night-
mare, but it was far better
than living with him.
Throughout this I periodically
went to legal aid for
some advice about my visita-
tion rights which were to-
tally at my ex-husband's
mercy. Each time I was told
by "my" lawyer that I should
“settle down" and go back to
my husband and children. At
the end of two years of this
torment, my ex-husband took
the children and moved about

1500 miles away from me. I
didn't find out that this was
actually going to happen un-
til I called up to see if I
was going to be lucky enough
to have my kids the next day
and one of them said, "Mommy,
we're moving to Pennsylvania
tomorrow." My heart ripped in
half and once again I ran to
legal aid.

The next day we were all
back in court and I was suing
for custody of my two youngest
sons. I had no idea how I was
going to support them or my-
self. All I knew was that I
was scared. As it turned out,
this lawyer who was supposed
to be representing me made a
deal with HIM that I would
drop my custody suit if he
would agree to paying for
them to come back summers and
holidays and give me support
money while they were with me
because by this time, I had
barely lived through pneumo-
nia and was struggling with
having asthma as a result of
the pneumonia, plus emotion-
ally I was a basket case, so
of course, I had no money. My ex-
husband readily agreed to
this because they both knew
something that I didn't...
as soon as he was over the
State line he could do what-
ever he wanted to because
legally I didn't have a leg
to stand on (as they say). If
I wasn't insane during all

this going on, when I watched
them walk across the parking
lot with him and out of my
life, I was nothing. I didn't
think I could bear to live
anymore. The next few years
were spent alternately plan-
ning my revenge against this
injustice and agonizing over
the fact that my kids were
