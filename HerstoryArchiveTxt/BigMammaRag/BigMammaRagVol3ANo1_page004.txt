Civil Rights

Commissioners Say  
Thumbs Down To Gays  

The Colorado Civil Rights  
Commission voted Jan. 24th 4-3  
not to endorse the Gay Civil  
Rights bills which will be in-  
troduced soon into the state  
legislature. In a statement  
released Friday, the Gay Rights  
Organization (GRO), a coalition  
group including the Lesbian  
Task Force of the National  
Organization for Women (NOW),  
stated that “the commissioners  
have revealed their own pre-  
judice and discrimination  
against Colorado's gay minori-  
ty,” and their “no” vote “points  
out the need for representation  
of acknowledged gay people on  
the commission.”  

Rep. Wellington Webb (D.,  
Denver) is sponsoring the hous-  
ing and credit bills and Rep. Jack  
McCroskey (D., Denver) is spon-  
soring the employment and  
public accommodations bills.  
Rep. McCroskey has decided not  
to carry the licensing/certifica-  
tion section in the employment  
bill.  

These bills amend the present  
laws to include “affectional or  
sexual orientation” which is  
defined as “having or indicating  
an emotional or physical attach-  

ment to another consenting  
adult, or having or indicating a  
preference for such attach-  
ments.”  

The child custody bill states  
that “the court shall make no  
presumption against or in favor  
of a proposed custodian either  
on the basis of the proposed  
custodian’s affectional or sexual  
orientation, or on the affectional  
or sexual orientation of the per-  
sons with whom the proposed  
custodian associates, in deter-  
mining custody of the child or  
children.”  

Recent child custody  
decisions in Washington and  
Oregon awarded custody to the  
Lesbian mothers but stipulated  
they not live together. As Phyllis  
Lyon puts it, “You can be Les-  
bian, but you can’t practice it.”  
The intent of the second part of  
the custody bill is to prevent the  
court from directing the propos-  
ed custodian not to live with  
her/his partner on the basis of  
the partner's sexual orientation.  

Ongoing negotiations are try-  
ing to get a primary sponsor for  
the custody bill. None of these  
bills has been scheduled yet for  
house committee hearings.  

When they are being considered  
in committee, we need to show  
strong constituency support thru  
letters to representatives and  
senators. For up to date informa-  
tion on the status of the bills and  
who to write to, please contact  
Marge Johnson, 798-3033.  

The February issue of Ms.  
Magazine contains a “Petition  
for Sanity,” which among other  
things supports civil rights  
legislation for Lesbians.  
Members of the Lesbian Task  
Force of NOW will be circulating  
these petitions around Colorado  
for signatures. The petitions will  
be presented to state legislators  
when the bills go before com-  
mittees for hearings.  

Also copies of these petitions  
will be sent to federal legislators  
in support of Rep. Bella Abzug’s  
(D., NY) congressional “affec-  
tional or sexual orientation” bill.  
If you wish to sign the petition,  
please call the NOW office, 831-  
7707.  

Several organizations have  
endorsed the state sexual orien-  
tation bills — the state board of  
NOW, American Civil Liberties  
Union, Colorado Trial Lawyers  
Assoc., National Lawyers Guild,  
Capitol Hill Tenants Union, and  
the First Unitarian Church.  

Denver Women’s Center  
Ready But Homeless  

In the pages of BMA, Majority  
Report, Off Our Backs, Sisters,  
and other feminist newspapers  

and journals, we often read  

about the women’s centers in  
most major cities, as well as in  
many smaller cities and towns  
across the country. Up to this  
point, Denver has not made the  
headlines as there has been  
nothing to report.  

Those of us who have been  
around here for awhile seem  
quick to comment that we’re not  
surprised. After all, we have  
witnessed abortive attempts,  
rises, and demises of many ac-  
tivities in this city. “Cultural  
lag,” “conservative,” “burnt  
out,” “transient population,”  
“lack of strong leadership,” and  
the like are offered as descrip-  
tions, reasons, and excuses for  
whatever phenomenon it is that  
has Denver always trying to  
catch up with what's happening  
in other places.  

Believe it or not, though,  
Denver really is going to have a  
women's center — soon. A very  
real physical facility where the  

women’s community can be  
centralized and nurtured, where  
the cultural, educational, social,  
business, health, and com-  
munication needs of women can  
be served is now much closer to  
reality than to fantasy.  

The idea and plans for the  
Denver Women’s Center were  
an outgrowth of the First Annual  
Colorado Women’s Festival last  
August 26th. The proceeds from  
the festival are being held in a  
savings account for the  
Women’s Center. Since that  
time, several women have been  
meeting weekly to work out the  
incredible number of details in-  
volved in actually getting  
something going — the  
philosophy and structure and  
resources and research and  
legalities and logistics.  

Needless to say, we did not  
avoid birth pains, but neither did  
we avoid an evolutionary  
process. We made mistakes and  
learned from those mistakes.

problems in September

“They had this buffet or al-a-carte or  
something and they served snails and  
sui and Janice was eating it. She  
made me take some but I almost  
vomited, “Do you want me to throw  
up here in front of everyone before  
we get our trophy?”

Being together and working  

The preparatory work is com-  
pleted and now we're ready to  
actually begin — that is, move  
into a facility and start doing all  
the things we've been planning.  
At this time, we are checking out  
all possibilities for donated or in-  
expensive space. We need the  
help of more women in offering  
suggestions for possible  
locations for the Denver  
Women’s Center.  

The group of women currently  
working on this project is by no  
means “closed.” Anyone even  
remotely interested or curious is  
encouraged to come to a  
meeting. Since we don’t have a  
phone yet, direct your  
suggestions and inquiries about  
the meetings etc. to the BMA of-  
fice (322-2010).  

Just think how good it will be  
for the women in Denver to be  
able to go to one building and  
have a coffeehouse and  
bookstore and gallery space and  
theatre and meeting rooms and  
offices and counseling services  
and whatever else we want and  
need.
