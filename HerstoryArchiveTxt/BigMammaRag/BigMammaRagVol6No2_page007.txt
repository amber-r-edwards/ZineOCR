Letters Cont'd

with battered women and it has been
widely reviewed in the women's press,
so its existence is well known.

Over the past few years I've managed
to work on it with very little money.
I've had difficulty in getting fund-
ing and what I did receive went di-
rectly to the printer. None of the
work that's gone into it (which is a
full-time job) has ever been paid for.
Right now, I'm existing on $52 a month
food stamps - but am still continuing
work on the directory and seeking
funds.

In the summer of '76 I received sev-
eral calls from the Center for Women
Policy Studies (CWPS) in Washington,
D.C. in regard to the directory. The
co-director of the center, Margaret
Gates, asked me to meet with her when
she was in the area. At that meeting,
Gates expressed an interest in having
CWPS take over the directory and having
me turn over all the mail I was re-
ceiving on this issue to them. I
preferred not to, as I was interested
in keeping control of this information
within the women's movement; also it
seemed unethical to give mail that had
been addressed to me to someone else.
I was surprised that CWPS would want to
take over work that someone else had
already invested so much time and ef-
fort into, had developed numerous con-
tacts for, and voluminous files of
resources and information - it would
seem much more sensible to just sup-
port the work already being done.
After my negative response to the
CWPS proposition, I heard from them
maybe once more, requesting the lat-
est edition of the directory, which
I sent. That was over a year ago.

Subsequently, I've learned a little
more about CWPS. They've been much
involved in the issue of rape. This
came only after feminists had esta-
blished and publicized the need for
such aid and had developed and set
up programs to aid its victims.
(See “Letter to the Anti-Rape Move-
ment," Women Against Rape, P.O. Box
711, Santa Cruz, CA 95061). CWPS
is funded by the government - Law

Enforcement Assistance Administration
(LEAA). They're receiving over three
hundred thousand dollars this year
alone from LEAA. In my opinion,
groups like CWPS tend to take over
issues that have been developed at
a grassroots level after the need
has been established and the hardest
work done by others. Their involve-
ment in the issue (i.e. rape, bat-
tered women) comes not from a fresh
analysis born of concern that exposes
problems that have been neglected or
compounded before, but this involve-
ment arises at a point when an issue
has become "credible," "fashionable,"
and, even more importantly, "fund-
able." Because of this, perspectives
and goals are often different from
those of the initiating groups - to
the detriment of the target popula-
tion.

I have just heard again from CWPS,
though I'm sure it's by mistake.

I've received a form letter from
them saying that they are planning
to publish a directory of programs
and services for battered women
(exactly what I've done four times
already) and that they would like
me to send them any information I
have that they can include. Appar-
ently, while I've been busy doing
this work, CWPS has been busy and
successful in getting funded for it
themselves!

If you feel that the actions of
CWPS are unethical or unjustified,
you can make your opinion felt by
not cooperating with them in their
requests for information. Also you
could write or call them to let them
know what you think of their actions:

Gerry Four from p.1

BMR: Are there many undocumented
workers in Denver, and are there a
large number of arrests? Is this

common?

SALLY: Yes, it's really common, not
only here in Denver, but throughout
the whole US. Here, in this area, in
the Southwest particularly, it is
Mexicano workers, because we are so
close to the border. There are par-
ticular places we know have been
raided.

La Migra doesn't like the word
"raided," but that's what it is, and
we know that they are going to contin-
ue with more raids on these factories.

BMR: This harassment by La Migra
is not only limited to undocumented
workers, but is pretty much evident
in the Mexican and Chicano communi-
ties. Can you talk about that?

SALLY: A good example of that is in
Los Angeles where there was a raid
where they took 500 people, and the
large majority of the people were
Chicano. They harass people because
they are Latinos, or they speak
Spanish, and they immediately assume
they are Mexicanos. That's the nature
of La Migra - they'll take you just be-
cause they think that you are a Meji-
cano, that you are illegal.

I'm not sure what role the police
have in picking up undocumented work-
ers, but for a while they were going
up here around the north side, and
picking up people waiting for
buses or for rides to go to work and
taking them to La Migra. That's not
part of their duty; it seems like
they would have better things to do,
like patrolling the streets where kids
are crossing.

BMR: What kind of conditions do work-
ers who come into this country live
under? Take Denver, for example.

SALLY: To many people, undocumented
workers are "illegal"; therefore,
they are breaking the law. I don't
think that's true; but, they are
forced to live like fugitives. Many
people move constantly from one apart-
ment to another. At work, they are
forced into the worst paying jobs, the
most dangerous jobs - jobs that no one
else would take. And they really can't
say a lot about the working conditions
when they try, of course, they are
reprimanded or La Migra is called.

BMR: Why do women choose to come to
Denver to live and work?

SALLY: I don't think they have a
choice of where they would like to go
and work. For many, many people who
are here undocumented, it's a question
of survival. They come here because
of the poor conditions in their own
country.

A lot of people who come are from
the peasantry. They work on very
small farms or a small plot of land.
Many people come from the larger
cities where the unemployment rate is
astounding - 40%. My personal view is
of the US domination of their econ-
omy. Many times they try to tell us
that the corporations in Mexico are
really making jobs for the Mexicano
worker, but the truth of the matter
is that they would rather pay five
American dollars in wages there than
$120 here. That is a good example of
the tremendous profits they make off
Third World countries like Mexico.

BMR: Do you think it's harder for un-
documented women workers who come
here? Do many women who cross the bor-
der bring their families with them?

SALLY: First of all, there are a good
number of women who have to leave
their children behind. But the woman
who does bring her children or who
sends for them after she's come here,
is in a much more vulnerable position
than a man. We have to look at it
from the standpoint of women in gen-
eral. Women - especially minority wom-
en who are workers - face a triple

Struggle
from p.5

The problem of a couple in a collec-
tive is frequently mentioned, but I
feel that a couple can be good for a
collective. The crucial question is
whether the couple is committed to liv-
ing collectively. They must want to
struggle with and get close to the oth-
er people in the house. You can find
this out before they or you move in by
asking how much energy they have for
other people and why they want to live
with others. (Of course, these ques-
tions are applicable to everyone moving
into a house.)

A couple can center a house and make
it a home. Whereas people with lovers
outside the house take energy away
from the house and are a centrifugal
force, often merely using the house for
a pit stop. With a couple in the house
we would tend to linger over meals
talking, and making music and dance to-
gether in the living room rather than
go out to a bar, etc. The “couple pro-
blem" depends on the individuals in-
volved.

What makes a house work is shared
political values, openness to emotion-
al struggle and a commitment to col-
lective living. The cement that keeps
a house together is shared nourishing
times like eating together, going to
movies, sledding or watching T.V. Even
the bedtime rituals can be interesting
with everyone talking and flossing
teeth.

I always tend to eat better when I
live collectively. Somehow there is al-
ways better quality food, and interest-
ing conversations with friends make the
whole experience more refreshing.

I usually relax and enjoy home more
when I am living in a collective be-
cause there are people around. Doing
yoga, spontaneously dancing or making
popcorn late at night are experiences
I don't often have living alone. The
daily interaction with people I like
gives me energy and an appetite for
life.

Perhaps most importantly, in a col-
lective, principles of equality and
feminism can be put into the rest of
our lives, giving support and impetus
for our political work.

oppression. This is even more true
with women from Mexico because they
don't speak English.

Another thing that can be a burden
is the level of education many of
them have had. Coming into a country
with children, not knowing English
and not having a job - she's hit three
times before she even really gets
going.

BMR: How can people lend support to
the Gerry women?

SALLY: One of the things which would
lend support would be to think about
why people come here from Mexico
looking for jobs. When I read articles
that talk about undocumented workers
and how they are taking jobs away,
how they are the source of huge wel-
fare rolls - that's nothing but a big
bunch of baloney. If people are here
"illegally," that would mean that they
are here as fugitives and there is no
way they can collect welfare.

There's a woman who is now unem-
ployed, who was a worker at Gerry,
who has no money coming in, who can't
get food stamps for her three child-
ren and is not eligible for any kind
of welfare. In terms of social secur-
ity, a lot of workers are not using
social security numbers or use num-
bers other than their own. There's
no way they can collect refunds at
the end of the year for the work they
have done. Where does that money go?
It sure doesn't go to the workers.

if they are under 21, will be sent
to state homes. The mental anguish -
not knowing where your kids are, and
wondering if you'll ever see them
again...

There are problems when someone
goes to register for school. I know
in my own case, when I was being reg-
istered for school, my mother was not
only asked for my birth certificate,
but also for hers. They wanted proof
that she belonged here with documents.
That really puts the woman in a bind;
she wants education for her children,
but the risks of being deported are
really strong.

Also, many health clinics in the
Southwest, before they ask you for
your money - which is before they ask
you what's wrong - ask you whether
you have papers...

I want to point out that a lot of
the problems that women, especially,
go through are not faced by European
or Canadian people who are not docu-
mented. I know a woman from Canada
who has been in this country without
documents for 40 years, and she's
never been asked whether she has her
documents. So it's really based on a
whole prejudice against the Mexican
race and against brown-skinned people.

- - - You have to see the roots
of why people come to this country
from Mexico. In the Southwest, es-
pecially, the border is somewhat ig-
nored because it's a border that di-
vided a group of people in half.
People recognize the border as an
authority, but it's not right to
divide a family. Most Chicanos or
Mexicans in this country, who were
born in this country, can't tell you
who was born in Mexico or who was
born here. We come from the same
race; our culture is the same. The
only difference perhaps is that one
of us knows a little bit more English
than the other because English is
being taught in the schools in Mexi-
co because of American tourism. But
there really is no difference.

protest conditions. Thousands of
prisoners have sent petitions to the
United Nations to publicize the in-
human conditions. Only when prison
officials are made accountable to
the community will these abuses cease.

It is critical that those on the
outside join in the struggle for the
human rights of prisoners. The issues
that Maxine and other prisoners are
addressing are not so different from
what working people face every day.
Medical care, education, and the right
to decent jobs are all areas where
we find those in power ignoring human
needs and rights. As long as the
rights of Maxine and other prisoners
continue to be violated, none of us
are secure in our rights.

Your help is needed. Petitions are
being circulated by the Maxine Smith
Defense Committee. Contributions
are needed to cover costs of legal
work and publicity. Send messages

Filipina Nurses
from p.3

“Who are you going to poison next?”
noted a member of the New York support
committee. "These incidents point out
that there's really a deep discrimina-
tion, racism in this country that can
boil over into a situation like that
of the two nurses." The government
has built a weak case by escalating
racism against Asian peoples. People
must organize not only against the op-
pression of these two nurses, but a-
gainst government propagated racism
as well.
