This Lady Is Not For Burning

Photo: Rosemary Farmer

Down Main Street, past Safeway, is

the Duck-In Restaurant, Bifco Mall,

Ronnie Mahanes Florist, and the Albe-
marle Hotel. Amidst these is a much
newer and perhaps more unusual busi-
ness - New Era Bookstore. New Era is
owned and managed by Rosemary Farmer,
a mother of four, a spokesperson for
feminist issues and a witch. As you
enter through a wooden door with
"Herbs!" engraved on it, bells chime
around you. The air is thick with
incense. Behind her desk, Rosemary
composes a prayer for her coven's
next celebration. She is quick to

ask you if she can help.

Before this interview with Rosemary,
I observed many curious people come
to her for a variety of reasons. One
person sought spiritual consultation.
Another desired knowledge of witch-
craft. A woman called wanting some
direction in locating a rare plant
used for medicinal purposes. As part
of her job, Rosemary provides educa-
tion on these matters. As Rosemary
is particularly concerned with spread-
ing the words of her religion and
reaching women with the wisdom of the
craft, we talked. Here follow seg-
ments of our conversation.

When feminists use the word 'wicca',
to what does it refer?

"There is controversy over what
it means. When I use the word wicca
I am referring to the old religion.
Some say that it means ‘wise ones’.
By the old religion I mean that it
pre-dates the current world religions
that are patriarchal."

How do you know that you are a witch?
"A woman will know whether or
not she is (a witch). This is a sub-
jective experience and it is diffi-
cult to put it into proof. I sudden-

ly had this feeling that I was a
witch - that I had been a witch be-
fore - and that I wanted to know a-
bout it. The feeling that you are a
witch is so different from the gener-
alized view of what a witch is. I
would define it as knowing that the
cosmic intelligence cared about me
and that it was a female type of
caring."

Is there a relationship between
witchcraft and feminism?

"Yes, there is a relationship.
It is almost a logical development of
one's feminism. When you become lib-
erated you begin to question every-
thing. It is inevitable that you be-
gin to question patriarchal religions.
The next step, if you are at all
spiritually minded, is to take back
our religion. This leads to being a
witch. There are some women who are
stuck in between. Much as I admire
women like Allison Cheek, who is try-
ing to be a female male priest, I
feel that they are wasting their en-
ergies. When they get to the altars
of the male god that is all that they
are going to get to. There are other
women who are looking for Spiritual-
ism and in their confusion will turn
to things like Unitarianism or Chris-
tian Science. This is fine if they
get something out of it. Now to be-
come a witch you do not have to join
a coven - you just have to do what is
the essence of feminism and that is
doing what is you. Because of the
context of patriarchal thinking one
instantly assumes that within witch-
craft there will be a hierarchy and
a system where someone will tell you
what to do. But the essence of the
craft is for the woman to find out
for herself and to do for herself."

You are a witch - are you also a
goddess?

"We are all God.
I write it as God-dess.
It has nothing to do with your sex.

"The Lady Guides Me"

The way, I
You are a god."

Who is Diana and the trinity sur-
rounding her?

"Diana, Di-great, honor mo-
ther or Diana the virgin huntress
are names for the Lady. It is entire-
ly up to the witch to decide which
name she wants to give to the Lady.
You can go to almost any culture and
there are names for this vast nurtur-
ing force called the Lady. You call
her the Lady to indicate someone who
is above and beyond."

Can you describe how you feel when
you pray to the Goddess?

"Part of becoming a witch is to
take back your highest self. Now
your highest self is embodied in the

Great Mother of Ten Thousand Names.
When you take it back you have to
cleanse yourself of other notions you
have about religion. When you pray
you do not beg to God on your knees.
As a witch, one stands tall and one
stands great while asking things of
the Lady."

Is the study of witchcraft a study in
power? If it is, what sort of power
is it?

"As with feminism, it is a study
in power as far as taking back one's
full self and no longer relating
through the male expectations and
conditioning. You become filled with
the power of one's own self when you
take back the Lady and gain spiritual
powers!"

Can you alter your state of conscien-
tiousness through a physical experience
either individually or in the coven
when you can take a journey into the
"soul", "Spirit", or "Self"? If you
can and do, how can you achieve this?
"You do not have to be a witch
to do this. You can do it through
hallucinogenic drugs. You can do it
through fasting. You can do it
through sitting in odd positions the
way Eastern people do. I found that
by sitting and staring at a large
tree outside my bedroom window with
the river flowing and the sky behind,
I could stare by the hour and become
one with this panorama of nature.
This is extremely pleasant to me.
You find yourself being drawn into
this other entity. Ordinary percep-
tions drop away from you and you be-
come one with something which is much
greater than you yet part of you."
