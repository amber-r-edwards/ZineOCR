Women’s Banking:  
How Will It Be Different?

by Robin Fray

The Women’s Bank of Richmond,  
scheduled to open in late February,  
is offering a few surprises to the  
traditional banking world. First,  
it is the brainchild of two women,  
Sylvia Clute, a Richmond lawyer, and  
Sally Duffer, the owner of a personnel  
agency in the city. Second,  
most of the board members are women,  
as is the bank's president, Sally  
Buck. Finally, the majority of the  
2200 shareholders are women, and this  
is the first time that most of them  
have owned shares of stock. When the  
Women’s Bank of Richmond opens, it  
will be one of at least three women's  
banks in the country.

No less surprising is the fact  
that the Women’s Bank is opening in  
Richmond, Virginia, noted bulwark of  
conservatism. How does Sylvia Clute  
explain this? "We were walking into  
a void [in Richmond],” so far as  
banking facilities for women were  
concerned. Both Ms. Clute and Ms.  
Duffer experienced difficulty in ob-  
taining credit to begin their busi-  
nesses, although Ms. Clute had earned  
her law degree and Ms. Duffer had  
had several years experience in busi-  
ness. But Ms. Clute, who is Chairman  
of the Board, has been able to maneu-  
ver the bank's establishment in a re-  
markably short time - a little more  
than a year - and with no resistance  
from the state's other banks and reg-  
ulatory agencies.

Most important, the Women’s Bank  
is trying to offer a different phil-  
osophy behind its traditional prac-  
tices. Two of its major objectives  
are to promote the economic equality  
of women and to foster their finan-  
cial responsibility. To accomplish  
these goals, the Women’s Bank plans to  
conduct seminars on economics and  
personal finance, covering such top-  

ics as how to start your own business,  

how to draw up your will, and how to  
obtain credit. Moreover, the bank  
will provide one-to-one financial  
counseling for women and men who want  
it. Their long-range objective is to  
get women, as Ms. Clute puts it,  
"thinking of themselves not as dizzy  
blondes. They can be financially re-  
sponsible."

But the bank's primary concern  
is to be profitable, because, accord-  
ing to Ms. Clute, otherwise none of  
the bank's "philosophical objectives  
can be attained." The bank will take  
on no bad risks which would endanger  
this primary goal. Although the  
bank's policy is to not discriminate  
in favor of professional women, the  
founders naturally sought executive  
officers with the greatest amount of  
professional experience. Thus the  
Women’s Bank finds itself in a chal-  
lenging position. It wants to bring  
women into the financial world and to  
humanize banking practices, while at  
the same time, to maintain a financi-  
ally conservative banking structure.

"Once we started," Ms. Clute  
says, "there was no turning back.  

The people who started the American  
Revolution must have felt the same  
way." If the Women’s Bank can hold to  
its humanistic goals, this revolution  
could be no less far-reaching.

a Spanish Lady

Teresa Cook's childhood in To-  
ledo, Spain gave no indication of  
her future in the United States.  

She inherited a love of educa-  
tion from her parents. Says Cook,  
"My father loved books, especially  
dictionaries. He would buy paper-  
bound ones and make beautiful leath-  
er covers for them." Cook displays  
some of them on her living room  
shelves.

Cook's mother "lived through  
her husband" and was a traditional  
Spanish housewife. "But, she encour-  
aged all four of us children to  
study."

She continues, “Although my fa-  
ther was satisfied to have four dau-  
ghters, my mother wanted a son. And  
some of our friends pitied my father  
because he had only girls."

After high school, Teresa Cook  
wanted to study journalism in Madrid.  
But her parents' wishes prevailed  
and she studied teaching in Toledo.

Now she lives in a quiet Albe-  
marle subdivision with her husband  
and three children - a son, aged 17,  
and daughters, 14 and 12.

Cook earned a Ph.D. in Spanish  
Literature from the University of  
Virginia in 1974.

Her dissertation, just publish-  
ed as a book in Spain, examines the  
feminist writings of the Condesa de  

The Blue Lantern

Pardo Bazán (1851-1920). The Con-  
desa wrote openly about forbidden  
subjects, including free choice for  
women and sex. Although completely  
qualified, Bazán was denied admis-  
sion to the Spanish Academy of the  
Language because she was female.  
Since 1974, Teresa Cook has  
been teaching Spanish at Piedmont  

Virginia Community College.

How does she manage to teach  
three days a week, care for three  
active children, keep house, knit  
sweaters, and sew clothes for the  
whole family? Says Cook, "The child-  
ren clean their own rooms and do  
other house chores. John helped with  
housework when the children were  
smaller, and I was a full-time grad-  
uate student with teaching responsi-  
bilities."

Whether at home or at Piedmont,  
Teresa Cook works on a highly organ-  
ized schedule. "I must keep to my  
schedule. If I fail to do a task on  
one day, I must do double work the  
next."

Teresa Almendros-Cantros left  
Spain when she married American John  
Cook in 1959. Her three sisters,  
however, remained. The oldest, a  
widow, works as a telephone operator.  
The other two are married and stay  
home to care for house and children.

Her sisters are fearful and sus-  
picious of feminists. Says Cook,  
"They see the Women's Liberation  
Movement as a threat to the protect-  
ive laws which Spanish women enjoy."

Some Spanish laws are, indeed,  
desirable. A widow gets a govern-  
ment pension, whether she's earned  
her own money or not. Pregnant  

workers get an automatic three-month  
leave with full pay and benefits.

However, Spanish law penalizes  
a woman with a fine and jail if she  
is found even once having intercour-  
se with a man other than her husband.  
And the law is applicable even if the  
woman is legally separated. (Spain  
does not allow divorce.) A man is  
liable under the same law only if he  
brings his girlfriend to his own home  
for sex. And at that, he must break  
the law repeatedly in order for his  
wife to be able to bring charges.
