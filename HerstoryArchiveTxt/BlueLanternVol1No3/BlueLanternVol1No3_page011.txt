JOB DISCRIMINATION

cont. from page 7  
You are not permitted to attend  
conferences or meetings even though  
they are related to work for  
which you are responsible, while  
male employees with similar or  
less involvement in the same work  
are encouraged to attend.  

Advancement  

You were the "natural" person to  
be promoted to a higher-paying  
job but a male with less experi-  
ence and tenure was appointed to  
fill the opening.  

There are very few women at the  
higher-paying grade levels in  
your department or office al-  

though several female employees  
are qualified to hold such jobs.  

ment or office generally earn  
less than male supervisors.  

Male employees who started in  
your department or office as  
clerical workers at the same time  
as you did are now working in  
high paying non-clerical jobs,  
while you are still doing clerical  
work.  

Employment Benefits  

You are not eligible for health  
and life insurance benefits that  
wives of male employees enjoy, or  
your husband and/or family is not  
eligible for benefits that the  
families and spouses of male em-  
ployees receive.  

Maternity leave in your depart-  
ment is not treated in the same  
manner as any other normal tempor-  
ary physical disability. A preg-  
nant woman does not have the  

right to: (1) continue at work  
until she determines that her  
physical condition no longer per-  
mits the execution of her work ac-  
tivities; (2) use accrued sick  
time while she remains physical-  
ly unable to work; (3) continue  

to participate in the department's  
health and life insurance plan  
during the period she is unable  

to work; (4) return to the same  
or a similar job at the same sal-  
ary and with no loss of seniority  
or seniority related benefits.  
Although you are not permitted to  
work part-time for family or  
child care reasons, male employees  
in your department work on a part-  
time basis while attending school  
or convalescing from a prolonged  
illness.  

The retirement plan in which your  
department participates encourages  
or requires an earlier retirement  
age for female employees.  

During an austerity period (or o-  
ther times in which personnel  

cuts are made), most of the em-  
ployees terminated in your depart-  
ment are women.

showing us how difficult it was for  
a second generation child to grasp  
what was real, what was true, and  
what mattered. Which of her mother's  
fears of the new world were founded;  
which were based on ignorant suspic-  
ions? Were all Americans really  
ghosts? Were girls really sold as  

slaves in China, and might she meet  
this fate if she did not find a hus-  
band?  

The theme of appearance vs. re-  
ality holds together the "story" of  
Kingston's childhood; her development  
is not carefully traced. However,  
the enjoyment of the book is in the  
stories of the old country. Especi-  
ally beautiful is the story of Fa Mu  
Lan, the woman warrior and Maxine's  
heroine, I believe, to this day.  
"After I grew up, I heard the chant  
of Fa Mu Lan, the girl who took her  
father's place in battle. Instantly  
I remembered that as a child I had  
followed my mother around the house,  
the two of us singing about how Fa Mu  
Lan fought gloriously and returned a-  
live from war to settle in the vil-  
lage. I had forgotten this chant  
that was once mine, given me by my  
mother, who may not have known its  
power to remind. She said I would  
grow up a wife and a slave, but she  
taught me the song of the warrior  
woman, Fa Mu Lan. I would have to  
grow up a warrior woman."

"Night after night my mother would  
talk softly until we fell asleep. I  
couldn't tell where the stories left  
off and the dreams began, her voice  
the voice of heroines in my sleep.”

The prose of Maxine Hong King-  
ston flows as in a dream, and like  
dreams, it is sometimes confusing,  
jumping from one scene or one time  
sequence to another, from the past to  
the present, from the old country to  
the newly adopted one. It seems the  
author's intent is to imitate her mo-  
ther's way of revealing a truth or  
something real through an unreal  
story or an exaggerated account of an  
actual event. And it is not imita-  
tion in the bad sense; Kingston's  
mother must have been a good story  
teller, and her daughter, assimilating  
that talent, was wise not to ig-  
nore the ability.  

The Woman Warrior is a confes-  
sional which sheds light on the tra-  
uma of a young female child growing  
up in two worlds - that of her par-  
ents, the mysterious, far away China  
with its ageless traditions and inex-  
plicable customs - and that of her  
own country, America.  

Throughout the book Kingston  
switches from the one to the other
