To The Blue Lantern Staff:

Your newspaper was informative and delightful,  
and I enjoyed reading it very much.  
I look forward to the next issue.

I thought that you might be interested in the  
work that we are doing for women here in Boston, so I  
have enclosed some information for you.

Keep up the good work and good luck to all of you.  
Sincerely,  
Connie LaPointe  
Assistant Director

Dear Friends:

Congratulations on your new publication, so long-  
needed in Virginia. We wish to subscribe so please  
bill us accordingly.

I am interested also in exploring with you how we  
can work together to assist Virginia women in the move-  
ment for legal equality. (The ACLU has a Women's  
Rights Project whose purpose through litigation, legis-  
lation and public education is to work toward this  
goal.) Perhaps we could help by providing articles on  
relevant topics from time to time. Are you interested?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,  
Retsy Brinson  
Executive Director  
American Civil Liberties Union  
of Virginia

Ms.,

Enclosed is a check for $3.00 for a year's sub-  
scription.

Although I realize your publication deals mostly  
with women and their rights I hope you do not overlook  

the children of our society -

In the near future I trust you will devote some of  
your column space concerning the rights (or non-rights)  
of children.

Thank you,  
Jim Mann

Dear Sisters of Blue Lantern,  
I have just moved to Charlottesville about 2  
weeks ago and was fortunate in seeing the second volume  
of the Blue Lantern. I am so happy to see the spirit  
of womanhood coming into being here. The articles were  
very informative and gave me an insight into women's  
affairs here. I think there was a broad range of top-  
ics covered - something to interest a woman of any age.  
I hope the mag will continue with this same great out-  
put of energies - I also hope that it will be read by  
men as well and that they will also support the  
thoughts behind it.

Smiles for you all,  
Sudy Chakravarty
