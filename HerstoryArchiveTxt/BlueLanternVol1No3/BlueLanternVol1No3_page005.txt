COMMENT

by Andrew Sherman and Drew Gardner

former co-chairpersons for the Coun-
selors Committee for Human Sexuality

Recently, members of the local
chapter of the Young Americans for
Freedom staged a minor political
drama before the Virginia House of
Delegates education committee. The
"Freedom Fighters" distributed cop-
ies of the sexuality information
booklet, An Ounce of Prevention, con-
tending that UVa students are being
forced to subsidize "anti-religious"
literature through mandatory Student
Activities Fees.

Ounce, written and published by
the UVa Counselors Committee on Human
Sexuality, discusses contraception,
anatomy, venereal disease, and the
various forms of human sexual expres-
sion. The booklet attempts to exor-
cise common myths and misunderstand-
ings from the mature exchange of
basic information on human sexuality.
Ounce is financially self-sufficient
and is marketed nationally and inter-
nationally. The YAF’s allegations
are unsubstantiated. Their political
chicanery, however, makes timely this
opportunity to reiterate the premises
underlying the Counselors Committee's
work.

The Counselors Committee was
founded in response to the co-educa-
tion of UVa. A clinic was establish-
ed at Student Health to provide the
expanding female population with much-
needed gynecological services. Aid-
ed by medical students and resident
staff, clinic resident Dr. U.G. Turn-
er III developed a program to dissem-
inate information on contraception,
venereal disease, and anatomy to the
general student body. This program
evolved into the Counselors Committee.

VCOSAR Presses for Change

The Virginia Committee on Sex-
ual Assault Reform (VCOSAR) began
meeting in Richmond in February of
1976. The stated purpose of VCOSAR
is to "coordinate a statewide effort
for the development of comprehensive
criminal sexual assault legislation
for introduction to the Virginia Leg-
islature." VCOSAR is composed of
several individuals representing or-
ganizations involved with various as-
pects of sexual assault.

During the past year VCOSAR has
extensively researched the problems
with the current laws concerning rape,
attempted rape, sexual assault, and
sodomy for both juveniles and adults.
The result of their work has been the
writing of a proposed law which is
modeled, in part, after the new Mich-
igan statute.

The main thrusts of the law are
to define criminal sexual assault in
sex-neutral terms, to define four de-
grees of criminal sexual conduct and
attempt, to define force and coercion,
to refocus the issue of sexual as-
sault from a crime of sex against
women to a crime of violence and for-
ce against the victim. Other as-
pects of the law cover subsequent
criminal sexual conduct offenses with
mandatory sentencing for repeat of-
fenders, confidentiality of preliminary
court records, and the responsibility
of the Commonwealth's Attorney
to the victim. The law states that
the victim's previous sexual conduct,
whether specific instances or opinion,
is not admissible as evidence and the
proof of resistance and corroboration
are not required. The VCOSAR draft
is unusual in that it steers away
from the defense of consent and
shifts the burden of proof from the
victim of the crime to the actor.

Reevaluation of the crime of
rape and how it is seen and practiced
in the courts is long overdue. Un-
fortunately, rape has been a catch-
22 situation for the victim of the
crime. We say that criminal sexual
conduct is a crime against the Com-
monwealth and that the victim is a
witness to the crime; yet we ask the
victim of the crime to prove that
the victim does not
prosecute the case; the Commonwealth's

Attorney does. How often have we
heard, "The woman is pressing char-
ges"? This is a false statement and
reinforces our belief that the victim
is the prosecutrix. Hopefully, the
new draft of the law will clarify the
crime of criminal sexual assault,
ease the burden of interpreting the
law as it stands now, and will result
in a higher rate of reporting and
conviction by clarifying that the
crime is one of force and coercion
and not one of sex.

VCOSAR is writing the Introduc-
tion to the law and is making plans
for publicizing the law statewide.
Currently, VCOSAR will turn the draft
over in its completed form to the
Virginia State Crime Commission Task
Force for introduction in the 1978
State Legislature.

A copy of the proposed law may
be obtained from: VCOSAR, 918 Cham-
berlayne Parkway, Richmond, VA 23220.
The cost is 75¢ for copying. Please
include a self-addressed stamped
(26¢) envelope.
