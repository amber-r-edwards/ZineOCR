The Blue Lantern

To Lauren

Softly

Like one who murmurs in a dream:
she sings a folk song,

and dances,

sways her hips. |

Fascinated

at the strangeness, I try to follow,
and catch a word

before it fades away

into a whisper. |

Her long brown hair

and heavy breasts

sway.

I envy

the casual grace.

She spreads her legs out on the grass.
I cross mine,

and when I'm funny

she throws her head back

laughing toward heaven,

while I contemplate whether

the ant that is climbing

over my big toe will bite.

She tells me she is a virgin.

Working at the nursing home,

she spoke of religion and feminism

to grandmas.

No telling what they thought

but perhaps they found

a place to lay their grey-haired heads
to whimper little girl sadness,

and years of wisdom,

and breathe secrets in her ear.

Like I want to.

Karen

Out of rain, out of pain, I sprout

through earth, through the worm's eye.

I am the protruding root

of veins in an intense arm.
Flexing in the haloed night,

I feel the moon drop around me
like a membrane.

I am your well-known
smoke-filled room.

An Unexpected Meeting

I watched her from across the hollow auditorium—

so near and yet too far for me to touch
except with my eyes;

tall and straight, like a poplar of her own age
she looked down on the rest from her height.

And for one breathless unguarded moment
I caught sight of her soul

as it showed through naked and exposed
in the loneliness of her eyes—

Suddenly her gaze caught mine

and she knew that I had seen the truth
and she quickly turned away

gathering her shell about her.
