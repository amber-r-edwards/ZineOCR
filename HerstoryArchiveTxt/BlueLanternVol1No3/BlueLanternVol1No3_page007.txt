The Blue Lantern

HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN  
IT’S HAPPENING TO YOU?

Although employers frequently  
make claims to the contrary, it is  
not really very difficult to deter-  
mine whether a woman, or women, are  
being discriminated against on the  
basis of sex. In practice, sex dis-  
crimination exists when working women  
are denied the jobs, salary levels,  
or opportunities for professional  
advancement that would naturally ac-  
crue to men with similar qualifica-  
tions. Prejudicial attitudes and  
preconceived ideas about what work  
women can or should do, or about a  
woman's worth as an employee based on  
the notions that "women don't need  
the money" or "women are bad risks"  
are also expressions of sex discrim-  
ination.

If you are a working woman, you  
are probably being discriminated a-  
gainst if you can check one or more  
of the circumstances below.

Equal Pay For Equal Work

You are paid less or required to  
do more work or more complex work  
than male employees in similar  
jobs.

The jobs in your grade and salary  
level that are predominantly held  
by women require higher qualif-  
ications and skill levels than  
jobs in your grade or higher that  
are predominantly held by men.  
You are hired to work in a lower  
paying job than male employees  
whose qualifications are compar-  
able to or less than your own.

You are not hired, appointed or  
promoted to do a job but a man  
with less tenure and experience,  
whom you may have even trained.

You are hired or promoted into a  
job and are paid less than the  
male employee who formerly held  
that job, or a male employee is  
hired or promoted to your present  
job and paid more than you are  
earning.

You are titled and paid as an as-  
sistant to a department head or  
administrator, but you perform  
all of the job functions of a de-  
partment head or administrator  
(perhaps because such a person  
does not exist).

Job Opportunity

When you applied for a job you  
were only told about or offered  
clerical or secretarial work.

You worked for several years be-  
fore you took time out to raise  
your children, but when you re-  
turned to work you were hired at  
the grade or salary held by inex-  
perienced workers.

When you applied for a job or pro-  
motion, your previous or current  
community, part-time or volunteer  
positions were not considered as  
qualifying work experience.

You were discouraged from taking  
a promotional exam or from apply-  
ing for a job because the job de-  
scription includes language and  
requirements that imply that the  
work is for men, or because you  
have been told that "they are  
looking for a man", or "they al-  
ready have a woman in that job  
title".

You are in a department or office  
in which the percentage of female  
employees is less than 40% but no  
jobs in your department are cer-  
tified as having bona fide occu-  

A few months ago in a northern  
city, I was looking enthusiastically  
for a job. Although I did not suc-  
ceed there, my efforts provided some  
eye-opening experiences. I applied  
for more than fifty positions in a  
period of a few weeks and quickly be-  
gan to feel I was being viewed pri-  
marily as a woman and, in many cases,  
only a woman. Some of the jobs for  
which I applied were in answer to  
classified ads and others were on my  
own initiative. I was consistently  
(and often first) asked, "can you  
type?", which annoyed me. Not having  
experienced job market competition  
before, I soon became aware of the  
sexism involved.

I decided to pick up on my old  
high school skills, worked madly to  
bring my typing efficiency up to par  
and then became disturbed with my-  
self for trying to conform. "If you  
can't lick 'em, join 'em"? I didn't  
want to, but I needed work!

There was the time I telephoned  
an answer to a newspaper ad for a  
landscape laborer. After being  
asked if I was inquiring for myself  
(a woman) and how old I was, the man on  
the other end of the phone said, "I  
don't think you could cut the mus-  
tard, honey." At first I laughed -  
I was stunned - but later I was angry  
and frustrated.

Another newspaper ad was for a  
baker's assistant which read "no ex-  
perience necessary". When interviewed  
in person, I was told I would not  
be suitable for the job because the  
work involved lifting one hundred  
pound bags of flour. When I persist-  
ed, suggesting there might be a way  
of working around this particular  
problem, the man said he would prefer  
someone with bakery experience. At  
this point I delicately brought the  
ad to his attention. He then said  
experienced people had applied and he  
preferred to hire one of those appli-  
cants. However, he said, the bakery  
did need part-time counter help if I  
was interested. I was not.

The Way I See It

Your attitude at work is consid-  
ered to be "too aggressive" while  
men in your department are prais-  
ed for being "go-getters", "ded-  
icated", or "ambitious" workers.  
You are subject to greater super-  
vision, or receive less staff as-  
sistance than men doing compar-  
able work under similar working  
conditions.  
You are an administrative assis-  
tant, research assistant or tech-  
nician, but are required to do  
secretarial work in addition to  
your other job functions while  
men in your job title or in simi-  
lar job titles are not required  
to perform secretarial work.

by Annette Patenaude  
I applied for a job as a furn-  
iture builder in answer to another  
classified ad which read "will train".  
Interviewed by a woman, I was asked  
if I could drive a truck, if I knew  
how to use power tools and then to  
relate my experience in furniture  
construction. I answered positively  
to all questions, determined to be  
assertive if not entirely truthful...  
but I didn't get that job either.  
Five months later and living in  
Virginia again, I am working and hap-  
py to be able to say so. My job is  
an ordinary one which does not tax my  
energies nor stretch my capabilities.  
My job will give me work experience  
which seems important on employment  
applications and will provide insights  
useful to my own growth. It is a  
step in a direction which is still  
questionable to my mind but which has  
the positive aspects of moderate se-  
curity, personal development and in-  
dependence - a beginning.
