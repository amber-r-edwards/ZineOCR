library leaves

Lack of financial support has
forced the move of the Fawcett Wom-
en's Library from the location it had
occupied since its founding 50 years
ago to London Polytechnic, a city
college. The Fawcett Collection,
with subjects ranging from housekeep-
ing to women's rights, also includes
political pamphlets, household imple-
ments, letters, and volumes of texts

such as a 1797 copy of the "Duties of 

the Female Sex".

gadget tells all

Ovulometer International of New
York announced the appearance this
year of a device that predicts "with
near perfect accuracy" the days a wo-
man can become pregnant. The battery-
run device relates the necessary in-

formation through its sensitivity to
body temperature and voltage during
ovulation.

Over $10 million in distribution
contracts have been committed and
street sale cost will be $49. The
Food and Drug Administration has not
yet commented upon the device.

NJ. threat

On January 24, the New Jersey
State Senate voted twenty-seven to
six in favor of convening a national
constitutional convention to amend
the U.S. Constitution to outlaw a-
bortions.

To call a constitutional con-
vention, 34 states must pass a bill
in the state assembly. If the New
Jersey Assembly takes this action,
it will join Missouri, Nevada, Louis-
iana, and Indiana in demanding a con-
vention.

Women's groups view the move,
like the proposed Hyde Amendment, as
another threat to the 1973 Supreme
Court Decision allowing abortions to
be performed legally. D.S.A.

don't give in - sue

On February 15, the U.S. Fourth
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a
woman who is fired from her job be-
cause she refuses sexual advances
from her male boss has a right to sue
her previous employer for damages un-
der the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The
three-judge panel decided unanimously
to overturn a lower court decision
which ruled against a Fairfax County
woman's complaint against the Saxon
Business Products Inc.

In her $1 million complaint,
Darla Jeanne Garber charged that she
was a victim of sex discrimination
because she refused the sexual de-
mands of her immediate superior, John
Johnson. Although U.S. District
Judge Oren R. Lewis of Alexandria in
his ruling agreed with Saxon that
Garber's sex had nothing to do with
her dismissal, the Appeals Court dis-
agreed. It maintained that Garber's
allegation "liberally construed"
points to a possible violation of
Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act which
makes sex discrimination illegal.

Saxon has not decided if it will

appeal the decision. R.F.

bishop hops

Constance Ward became the third
woman to enter the priesthood of the
Virginia Episcopal Church on Saturday,
February 12. The two women previous-
ly ordained were Patricia Park and
Blanche Powell, both of northern Vir-
ginia.

The ordination was attended by
Allison Cheek, one of the Philadel-
phia 11 ordained before the church's
decision to permit women to become
priests.

"It was a terrific day," said
Rev. Ward. "The Bishop (Robert Hall)
was hopping around all excited. The
feeling went far beyond celebrating
with one person. The congregation

clapped at the end." 

“reasonable force”

Michele Whitnack, after spending
six months in jail for refusing to
supply her fingerprints to the Grand
Jury, was released on Dec. 21. Her
release was granted only after three
federal marshals, three agents of
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, one policeman, and a jail
matron pulled her from her cell and
choked her to unconsciousness to ob-
tain her fingerprints.

She has yet to be charged with
any crime.

This particular Grand Jury was
formed to investigate a bank robbery
but has since turned into an investi-
gation of political groups and their
activities.

The case points out the means by
which a court can abuse its power in
a grand jury case. That "reasonable
force" was employed to obtain the in-
formation needed for the investigation
and that this force was legally sanc-
tioned by a U.S. Magistrate (Magistr-
ate Cooper, Tacoma) is a serious vio-
lation of an individual's rights.
