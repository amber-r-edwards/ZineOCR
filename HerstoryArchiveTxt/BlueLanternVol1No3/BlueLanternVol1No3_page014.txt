CHILD'S PLAY

Gimmer

What will you be when you grow up,  
Dear little boy of mine?  

What will you be when you grow up,  
Darling girl of mine?  

All I can think of is what I see.  
And what I see just doesn't fit me  
So I don't know what I'm gonna be.  
Won't you please help me?  

(apologies to Pete Seeger and Tracy)  

The child's view is based on  
what he or she sees and experiences  
NOW. It may never occur to David  
that he can be a nurse while the pos-  
sibility of being a mechanic may  
never occur to Beth.  

The Light of the Fire  
To help the child understand the  
variety of opportunities available in  

The fire is pretty. And it can make pretty designs.  
In the fire I could see me dancing. I had on leotards  
and tights and I was doing the Magic Toy Dance. The  
light of the fire: On separate slips list a variety  
of occupations. Have the child add  

to your list. Try not to use sexist  
terms. Instead of policeman, law en-  
forcement officer. Instead of fish-  
erman, commercial fisher. Instead of  
milkman, milk deliverer, and so forth.  

Arrange cards titled "man" and  
"woman" side by side with a space be-  
tween them. One at a time pick up an  
occupation card, asking the child,  
"Who could do this?" Place the  
card under "man" or "woman" according  
to the child's answer. If he or she  
thinks either could do the job place  
it in the space between the two head-  
ings.  

After all discussion all cards  
will likely end in the unsexed mid-  
dle area. Barring specific repro-  
ductive functions (and legal restric-  
tions), you won't find an inherent  
sex-linked occupation.  

Try it as a birthday party game  
for a wide audience or a bedtime  
game when receptivity is high.

"Life as a Bird"  

I've been here so long  
And they haven't  

Cleaned my cage yet.  
There's nothing to do.  

I think I'll count  

My bars and see if  

there are still twenty-five.  
This cage stinks.  

My life stinks.  

I wonder what real  

air smells like.  

Another thing is that  
Those people keep playing  
A record that says birds  
like me sing here.  
With all that smog?  

I would give up my  

Life to be free for a  
Day and hear the birds  
Say hooray!

Most is  
His favorite things  
are comics, there are special  
comics that can be  
buried in the  
ground.  

But one  
of the nicest things  
is that they look,  
it affects  
the way they  
live.
