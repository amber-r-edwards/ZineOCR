The Triangle

as I look around me

for some semblance of a substitute

this heavy night

induces my guilt.

daring even to give a hidden ember

I admit a need,

(not to be misinterpreted as a commitment,)

and should I kindle a blaze

there is nothing with which to feed it
for longer than a night.

even so,

I am not a woman

and, consequently,

need not fight the flesh.

stale night

what am I to make of you?

have I failed

because I keep inside

the gentle feelings that flow and rise?
I cannot fully convince myself of

the dualities in human existence.
sacred, though it is to me,

I feel I should not bestow my

wealth onto the already affluent

nor should I suffer to envy their riches.

perfumed evening

single night

envelope me in the arms that seek me
but are not my own.

although the morning comes

I can, for one moment, pretend

and thus

fill needs that are not solely my own.

The Blue Lantern

After Twenty Years

The second decade's end
could have been mute
crossing exists

a one lane bridge
veering nowhere

never meets

or have burst

from the trusted palm
cramped with debris a mind
litters and have snapped
the chord structure

of nerves

there was a gangplank
with my name carved on it
it bounced me down

in the whirlpool of souls
my limbs doubled

and mended

eight arms to serve
eight minds bidding
welcome the craft
of octoploid logic
it would carry me
the next ten years

I have learned secrets

words fail to understand

vainly interjecting life

into a language

only the dead speak

when they have gained the tongue

dying dolphins:
emit eight palatable notes
the dead absorb them

and continue then

to restructure

their soul

as acquaintances separate
they remain together

locked in the octagonal arch
swallowing and discharging
the shavings civilizations

are certain are dead

my few friends have gone adrift
holding the sketch

of a compass

and the tongue of a dolphin

to chart a passage

through the third decade
