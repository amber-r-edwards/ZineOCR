AP makes stew  
of newsmakers  

“AP writer Mary Campbell's  
soup-to-nuts summary called  
“Women of ‘75” makes for some  
very strange stew ingredients —  
all in the name of liberation.  

Present and former first ladies  
are lumped together with at-  
tempted assassins, saints, movie  
stars, you name it, as long as  
they just happened to make news  
by “their worries, words, guns,  
and deeds.”  

AP's end-of-the-year ritual ran  
as a 4-part series in the Houston  
Post “Today” section, December  
16-19, 1975.  

Seemingly written under a  
beauty parlor hair dryer with a  
year’s back issues of fan maga-  
zines for research, Campbell re-  
counts Shirley Temple’s daugh-  
ter’s marriage, Liz Taylor’s re-  
marriage, Ann Landers’ divorce,  
and Ann Ford Uzielli’s having-  
been-seen-with Governor Hugh  
Carey, a widowed father of 12.  
One full day of reporting was  
devoted to romance and the love-  
lorn.  

Other “headline makers” in-  
cluded “the hottest model of the  
year” — a “black girl with white  
features” and a deceased woman  
whose jewelry estate sale brought in  
over $2 million.  

Ironically, 1975 was the UN-  
proclaimed International Wom-  
en’s Year. We had the Mexico  
City Conference in June and in  
November, the US counterpart  
to Mexico City, the Austin  

The discrimination which  
women face in the area of credit  
has received much public at-  
tention during the last five  
years. Until recently, women  
simply could not get credit —  
either commercial, home loans,  
personal loans, or consumer — on  
the same basis as men. The  
situation is changing, due  
primarily to the passage of state  
and federal equal credit op-  
portunity laws, and it is im-  
portant for women to know and  
exercise their rights under these  
laws in order to force creditor  
compliance.  

Denial of equal access to  
credit deprives women of  
adequate housing, educational  
opportunities, and the ability to  
establish a livelihood by en-  
tering business, as well as the  
increased purchasing power of  
retail credit. It is the married or  
formerly married woman who  
appears to be the prime victim  
of sex discrimination in credit.  
When a woman marries she  
becomes an economic nonentity  
in the eyes of the credit  
establishment, and when she is  
subsequently divorced or  
widowed she emerges as an  
unknown in an increasingly  
credit-oriented society.  

The pervasive effect of sex-  
based credit discrimination has  
been extensively documented by  
women’s action groups and  
governmental commissions. In  
hearings before Congress in 1973  
and 1974 the following were  
among the discriminatory  
practices cited by the Senate  
Committee on Banking, Housing  
& Urban Affairs:  

Women in Public Life Confer-  
ence, yet the only reference  
made to IWY was with regard to  
Australia giving up its female  
cyclone-naming practice in hon-  
or of the year-of-the-woman.  

The feminist movement? It  
was dispensed with in a sentence.  
“Women’s lib (sic) wallowed in  
dissension and seemed to be run-  
ning out of steam.” A curious  
statement worthy of serious po-  
litical analysis. This article was  
not the place.  

Yet Campbell did point out  
that two courses for women, “the  
opposite of women’s lib (sic)”,  
Fascinating Woman and the To-  
tal Woman were “packing in the  
students.”  

In all this can anyone imagine  
a series called the “Men of ‘75”  
wherein Gerald Ford, Sirhan-  
Sirhan, Lt. Calley, Richard Burt-  
on, and Charles Manson were  
thrown together merely because  
their names appeared in the  
news, “for whatever reason”?  

Yet somehow we tolerate a  
melting pot with Betty Ford,  
Jackie Onassis, Liz Taylor, Lyn-  
ette Fromme, Sara Jane Moore,  
etal.  

All readers get from this kind  
of heat-and-serve convenience  
story is a strange-tasting libera-  
tion stew.  

Our suggestion is that Camp-  
bell’s story be canned!

1. Single women have more  
trouble obtaining credit  
(particularly mortgages) than  
single men.  

2. Creditors generally require a  
woman upon marriage to  
reapply for credit, usually  
in her husband’s name.  

3. Creditors are often unwilling  
to extend credit to a married  
woman in her own name.  

4. Creditors are often unwilling  
to count the wife’s income  
when a married couple applies  
for credit.  

5. Women who are separated,  
divorced or widowed have  
trouble re-establishing credit.  
Women who are separated  
have a particularly difficult  
time since the accounts may  
still be in the husband's name.  

6. Creditors refuse to issue to a  
working wife an account for  
which she would be eligible  
were she not married.  

7. Creditors request information  
about her husband’s credit-  
worthiness before issuing an  
account to a working wife.  

8. Creditors consider a working  
wife a “dependent” of her  
husband when determining  
his eligibility for credit.  

9. Creditors apply stricter  
standards when the wife is the  
primary wage earner.  

10. Creditors alter the credit  
rating of a working wife on the  
basis of her husband’s credit  
performance.  

11. Creditors refuse to consider  
alimony and child support as  
income for credit purposes  
when the reliability of the  
source may be verified.  

12. Creditors request in-  

formation concerning birth  
control practices when  
evaluating a credit ap-  
plication.  

13. Creditors use credit scoring  
systems that apply different  
numerical values depending  
on the sex or marital status of  
the applicant.  

An attempt to remedy the  
above discriminatory practices  
has been made on the state level,  
with the passage of laws  
prohibiting sex discrimination  
and marital status  
discrimination, and on the  
federal level, with the signing  
into law of the Equal Credit  
Opportunity Act, effective last  
October.  

The Texas credit  
discrimination law, enacted in  
1972, provides that:  

No licensee or those involved  
in credit transactions, may deny  
an individual credit or loans in  
his or her name, or restrict, or  
limit the credit or loan granted  
solely on the basis of sex.  

Few suits have been brought  
under this law, in part because it  
has been in existence only three  
years, but also because it  
prohibits discrimination only on  
the basis of sex, rather than on  
the basis of sex and marital  
status. Thus, practices such as  
refusing to count the income of  
both spouses when a couple  
applies for a mortgage and  
judging divorced and separated  
people more harshly because of  
assumptions about their  
stability would not be prohibited.

Workshop planned  

Your group has decided to  
honor outstanding women in the  

community. You want to  
publicize the event. Where do  

you begin?  

Your group is planning to  
protest the sale of a bumper  
sticker at a local novelty store  
which treats the CRIME of rape  
with humor. Whom do you call to  
cover the action?  

You are offended by an ad  
running in the local newspaper  
showing a woman and cap-  
tioned, ‘I want your body and I  
want it now.” Whom do you  
complain to?  

BREAKTHROUGH received  
calls on all of these questions  
while we were putting together  
the first issue of the paper.  

Since the philosophy of the  
paper is rooted in improving the  
communications between  
women in this community and  
state and between women and  
the media, we decided to hold a  
one-day workshop for individual  
women and women’s groups.  

It will take place Saturday,  

Jan. 31 in the Rice Media Center  

auditorium. Two sessions are  
planned.  

9 AM—Noon—Is ‘Women’s  
News’ News? Coordinators:  
Janice Blue and Gay Cosgriff,  
Media Reform Task Force  
coordinators for West University  
and NW NOW, respectively.  

Panelists: Broadcasting news  
directors and assignment editors  
and representatives from  
newspaper news and feature  
departments.  

1 PM—4 PM—Are Those Ads  
that Bad? Coordinators: Aileen  

English, Assistant Prof. of  
Sociology, TSU, and Dr. Virginia  
Davidson, psychiatrist, Baylor  
College of Medicine.  

Panelists: Representatives  
from advertising agencies and  
broadcast and print advertisers.  

The goal of the morning  
session is to get better coverage  
of women’s issues and events.  
We know we are newsworthy—  
how do we communicate it?  

There will be practical in-  
formation. For example, how to  
write a press release and when  
to call a press conference. We  
will give specific examples to  
the news directors of events we  
have planned or that they have  
covered to see how coverage  
could have been improved.  

The goal of the afternoon  
session is how to improve the  
image of women in advertising.  

Slide presentations are  
planned on the image of women,  
one specifically dealing with the  
way ads portray women in  
medical journals. Discussion  
will include how to personally  
evaluate negative and positive  
ads and how to communicate  
your reaction to advertisers.  

We will have a press directory  
on hand with practical in-  
formation containing the names  
of media contacts at every radio,  
tv, newspaper and advertising  
agency.  

Try to “communicate” with  
us if you plan to attend—by post  
card preferably or call Ailene  
English (641-1277) or Janice  
Blue (522-0020).  

Hope you join us!
