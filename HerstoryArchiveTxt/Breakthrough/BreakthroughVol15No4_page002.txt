NACW to Open National Office  
Part-time Executive  
Director Sought  

Three goals have been established  
for the NACW office, scheduled to  
open in Washington, D.C. in Febru-  
ary, 1986. First, the office is to serve  
as a Clearinghouse for all other com-  
missions in an effort to coalesce infor-  
mation on issues, public policies, re-  
search, education, legislation, and  
fundraising. Second, the office will  
develop topical programs and proj-  
ects which will raise money for  
NACW as well as meet the needs of  
many women across the country. The  
third goal is to increase nationwide  
exposure to NACW to achieve na-  
tional stature.  

Because of limited finances,  
NACW is seeking a part-time execu-  
tive director who will be responsible  
to the Board of Directors for imple-  
menting the identified goals. Thanks  
to Mayor Marion Barry of Washing-

ton, D.C., and the Washington, D.C.  
Commission on the Status of Women,  
the office will be located at District  
Building, 1350 Pennsylvania Ave.  
NW, Washington, DC 20004.  

The nature of the job demands that  
applicants be self-starters with both  
knowledge and experience in address-  
ing women’s issues. Knowledge and  
experience in these areas are essen-  
tial: interpersonal and communica-  
tion skills, grant writing, working  
with volunteers, and management. A  
working knowledge of intergovern-  
mental relations would also be help-  
ful. For more information on the  
position of NACW Executive Direc-  
tor contact NACW President, Connie  
Woodruff.  

Deadline for application is January  
1, 1986.  

Regional  
Conference  
Funds  
Available  

NACW will make grants of up  

to $1,000 to member commis-  
sions for regional education  
and training conferences. For  
more information on proce-  
dure and criteria for this grant,  
contact Marilyn J. Flood,  
Treasurer, NYC Commission  
on the Status of Women, 52  
Chambers Street, Suite 207,  
New York, NY 10007.  

Affiliate  
Membership  

To be a member of NACW, a com-  
mission must currently be a govern-  
mental body established by statute.  
What then becomes of councils and  
commissions NOT established by  
statute?  

Recently we have discovered sev-  
eral such organizations exist includ-  
ing women’s commissions on college  
campuses nationwide. Further discus-  
sion by the NACW Board fostered  
thoughts of other national organiza-  
tion involvement where there are  
mutual interests for women.  

To include non-statutory organiza-  
tions and others as affiliate members  
would require NACW to change its  
bylaws. A subcommittee chaired by  
Camile Murphy (Westchester, New  
York Commission) will be examining  
the pros and cons of affiliate member-  
ship.  

Anti-Apartheid  

by Kit Boesch  

Movement Grows  

More than 700 people have been  
killed in 13 months of anti-apartheid  
unrest across South Africa.  

Last week, top executives of East-  
man Kodak and General Motors  
signed a large “respect for individual  
freedom of enterprise and movement”  
ad in the South African press. The  
two companies used the ad to protest  
the apartheid government and its  
policies. This is one of many exam-  
ples of American firms divesting  
funds and/or protesting the actions of  
the South African white-minority  
government.  

NACW vocalized its position on  
this issue by passing a resolution at its  
1984 national convention:  

“NACW endorses the provision of  
the Export Administration passed by  
the U.S. House of Representatives,  
which decreased U.S. support for  
apartheid. NACW also encourages  
members to write their congressional  
representatives and senators to sup-  
port economic and political sanctions  
against South Africa.”  

The following information was pro-  
vided by the Campaign Against In-  
vesting in South Africa, Washington  
Office on Africa, 110 Maryland Ave.  
NE, Washington, DC 20002, (202)

This office attempts to keep up-  
dated on apartheid related events in  
South Africa. They suggest each com-  

Are You  
Covered?  

by Adele Kaserman  
Palm Beach County CSW, Florida  

The Palm Beach County COSW re-  
cently served as the catalyst for a  
group of women from organizations  
such as NOW, National Council of  

Jewish Women, the Junior League,  

Planned Parenthood, the National  
Association of Social Workers and  
several local agencies in the develop-  
ment of a not-for-profit corporation  
to provide a shelter for victims of do-  
mestic assault.  

The funds are sitting in the county  
treasury, the contract for the house is  
ready to be signed. The director is  
ready to come to work, furniture do-  
nated to the shelter is sitting in a  
warehouse and we are getting calls for  
assistance from battered women. But  
this program is stopped dead in its  
tracks because AVDA is unable to  
purchase Board of Directors Insur-  
ance!  

Insurance companies in the U.S.  
have simply stopped writing this in-  
surance due to the number of suits in-  
stituted against organizations, espe-  
cially child care centers. Some groups,  
lucky enough to have insurance, are  
finding their policies cancelled at re-  
newal time or available only at astro-  
nomically increased premiums.  

Every COSW and all organizations  
involved with women’s issues should  
be concerned about the human wel-  
fare projects funded by both the gov-  
ernment and private sector that may  
be caught unable to be insured.  

mission keep abreast of American  
firms divesting monies from South  
Africa by monitoring “Business  
Week” and “Fortune” magazines.  

As a commission you might want to  
draft a letter of support and send it to  
the supporters of the anti-apartheid  
movement listed below who have  
halted all or part of their South Afri-  
can business operations this year.  

Apple Computer, BBDO Interna-  
tional, Blue Bell, City Investing Fi-  
nance Services, Coca Cola, Ford  
Motor Co., General Motors, Helena  
Rubenstein, International Harvester,  
Oak Industries, Pan American, Pepsi-  
co, Perkins-Elmer, Phibro-Solomon,  
Singer, Smith International, Tidwell  
Industries, and West Point-Pepperell.  

Since the above companies’ divest-  
ments, 49 African countries which de-  
pended upon the South African econ-  
omy for services and trade have suf-  
fered major consequences.  

How does this affect the Black peo-  
ple in Africa? In a recent conversa-  
tion with women on the International  
Friendship Force tour from Sudan,  
Zimbabwe, Somalia, and Ethiopia, all  
agreed that Black people were losing  
jobs and obviously victims of the cur-  
rent economic depression, but also  
agreed the long-range consequences  
of apartheid rule would be greater. In  
a survey conducted in September by  
the Institute for Black Research in  
Durban, nearly 73 percent of Blacks  
favored some type of foreign business  
withdrawal.  

NACW Handbook  
to be Revised  

NACW is about to get a face lift.  
The handbook, out of print since  
1982, is being revised and redesigned  
by the Public Relations Committee. A  
new informational brochure will soon  
be printed also. Anyone wishing to  
contribute ideas on content or design  
can send them to the Breakthrough of-  
fice by December 1, 1985.  

Liaison for  
Lesbian Caucus  

The Mayor’s Advisory Commission  
on Women’s Affairs will make every  
attempt this June to meet the needs of  
many women’s communities which

tional Convention. Sarah Craig has  
met with Lesbian Caucus representa-  
tives and will be providing a com-  
munity calendar of events; places to  
go; and specific events of interest.  
Special caucus time will be provided  
on the agenda for the first time in  
NACW's 14 years. Members of the  
Caucus would like to thank the  
Mayor’s Advisory Committee for  
their sensitivity and look forward to  
having a presence at this year’s Na-  
tional Conference. Anyone having  
any questions or desiring input may  
call Sarah at 312-236-0763.
