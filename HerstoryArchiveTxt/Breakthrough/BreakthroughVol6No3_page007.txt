FIESTA

“Dancing the night away” took on  
new meaning for NACW convention  
participants and perhaps for the man-  
agement and staff of the Pasadena,  
California Hilton Hotel lounge as  
well. Without a doubt, the resident  
disc jockey, with his bird’s eye view,  
was entertained by the twenty or  
thirty women, participants of the con-  
vention, who surrendered to their aes-  
thetic sense of motion, and danced  
with the beat, the off-beat, the up-  
beat, the down-beat. They danced  
alone, in couples, in groups, in circles  
and in lines. They clapped, they  
cheered, they smiled, they laughed. In  
short, they had a wonderful time.

What prompted this madcap behav-  
ior? The moodsetter was a California  
Fiesta, the Friday night convention  
event planned by the Pasadena  
Women’s Commission. Early in the  
evening, convention participants  
walked the short distance to the Pas-  
adena City Hall courtyard. Servers  
greeted the guests with offers of  
beverages which women sipped as  
they mingled among the crowd taking  

advantage of unstructured time to fur-  
ther discuss issues, politics, commis-  
sions and projects; to talk with  
friends, old and new, and to develop  
new relationships.

Tables scattered about the attrac-  
tive courtyard were filled after guests  
made their way through the buffet  
line which offered tortilla chips and  
sauce, beans, rice, and all the “fixins”  
for chicken and beef tostadas.

Stomachs full, the crowd turned its  
attention to the band which played a  
variety of songs. Toe tapping and  
clapping soon gave way to dancing.

Here too, women danced alone or  
with others; in twos, in threes and in  
groups. As the band struck up “When  
the Saints Go Marching In,” the  
guests formed a line, and sang and  
clapped as they made their way  
through the courtyard.

The fiesta came to an end, but the  
dancing mood prevailed, so some of  
the hard-core “hoofers” headed for  
the Hilton Hotel dance floor where  
they danced with no inhibitions,  
unencumbered by the “normal” day-  
to-day restraints we put on ourselves  
or allow others to put on us. Most im-  

portantly, they felt safe — safe with  
themselves and with each other —  
safe enough to fully appreciate their  
own interpretation of the music, and  
to express themselves freely through  
motion.

As the evening wore on, the dancers  
wore out, and the lounge slowly re-  
turned to “normal.” In the following  
day or two, all returned home, back to  
“normal,” but few will ever forget  
their night as a “disco queen.”

Directions (Continued)

That a formal process for workshop  
submissions be designed.

That we consider holding national  
conventions in states which ratified  
the Equal Rights Amendment.

That sensitivity to needs of handi-  
capped persons be maintained at na-

Chicago Receives Bid to  
Host 1986 NACW National  
Convention

The Windy City, the city that cele-  
brated women and drew over 2000  
people last year, the city of jazz and  
Chicago deep dish pizza, has invited  
NACW to hold their 17th annual na-  
tional convention in 1986. The theme  
will be “We Cannot Walk Alone.”  
The theme reminds us of the critical  
point in which the women’s move-  
ment currently finds itself. A passage  

from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s fa-  
mous speech “I Have a Dream” ex-  
plains the symbolism of “We Cannot  
Walk Alone.” The words are symbolic  
of a united front struggling to move to  
higher planes of success and stature.  
The struggle is to keep women from  
getting caught in a society which  
passes by without giving recognition  
to them for their achievements. The  

words emphasize the unity needed to  
accomplish this worthy goal.

The 1986 NACW Convention  
should prove to be a productive com-  
bination of workshops, business, and  
recreation—Chicago style! Mark the  
dates June 18-21, 1986 and be sure  
and attend the most dynamic conven-  
tion you will attend all year!

Fund Raising Tips

These tips are presented in response to requests made at the convention  
for ways to improve the quality of special events.

The goal of any special event should  
be to maximize the dollar return per  
member hour spent, aiming for fewer  
events with greater returns. The fol-  
lowing suggestions and thoughts may  
help you design a successful special  
event for your commission:

1. Ideas must come from within the  
group. Then the group will own  
the project, not you.

2. Every event should have one  
leader managing the event.

3. Select that leader carefully. Is she  

articulate, enthusiastic, well-  

4. Special event monies should sup-  
plement not support your organi-  
zation.

5. Allow adequate planning time for  
your special event.

6. Involve many volunteers. This  
heightens visibility as well as com-  
mitment.

7. Do not duplicate fund raising  
events of other groups. Be crea-  
tive, original.

8. Do not compare your event to an-  
other group in town to measure  
success. i.e.: A hospital charity  
event will usually raise more  
money than yours.

9. Make lists. List people, responsi-  
bilities, time lines, equipment,  
right down to the toilet paper in  
the bathroom.

10. The day of the event have key  
leaders you can depend on for  
specific responsibilities. This  
saves talking with everyone in-  
volved.

11. Public relations before-during-  
after is another measure of suc-  
cess and should be designed in the  
original planning—not the last  
minute.

12. Be patient. A strong annual fund  

raising effort may take 2-3 years to get  
off the ground.

13. Be sure to evaluate the total event  
and all its components following  
the event.

Remember—Good fundraising re-  
flects the health of the organization.  
Special events are only one means of  
raising money. In the next edition of  
Breakthrough various contributors  
will identify successful projects they  
have used to raise funds.

“Past the  
Morning Star”

Dorene Ludwig, actress, director,  
and president of the American Living  
History Theatre, created and per-  
formed the production “Past the  
Morning Star.”

The one-person production offered  
an outstanding portrayal of American  
women in history. Ms. Ludwig held  
an audience of over 200 captive with  
stories of struggle, patriotism, humor,  
and talent. She transformed from one  
historical character to another  
through dialect, vocabulary, and body  
posture, giving their perspective of the  
past.

Public Relations  
Committee  
Announced

With the assistance of some very  
willing NACW convention partici-  
pants, we now have an “official” pub-  
lic relations committee. Their primary  
purpose is to contribute articles and  
information to Breakthrough for its  
quarterly publication. Please feel free  
to contact them with suggestions and  
articles on any facet of your commis-  
sion activities, conferences, etc. The  
next quarterly deadline is October 15,  
1985, so please have your contribu-  
tions in by that time.
