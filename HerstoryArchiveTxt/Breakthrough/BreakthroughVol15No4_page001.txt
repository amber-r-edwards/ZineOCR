Success in Nairobi

by June Dunbar, NACW Board  
Member

“Women represent 50% of the world  
population, Y, of the official labor force,  
perform % of all working hours, receive  
1/10 of world income and own less than  
1 percent of world property.”  

From the 1980 Conference in Copenhagen.

The United Nations General As-  
sembly adopted the “Convention on  
the Elimination of All Forms of Dis-  
crimination Against Women” in 1979  
and seventy-seven countries have rati-  
fied the convention.

The “Forward Looking Strategies  
for the Advancement of Women: for -  
the Period up to the Year 2000” was  
based on replies to the U.N. by 124  
countries and was the document  
adopted at the Nairobi Conference.  
Debates on Zionism, apartheid and  
the world economic order threatened  
the consensus but the “Strategies”  
were finally agreed on the “_ be-  
fore the formal conference ended. In-  
cluded was a resolution to measure  
and reflect women’s unpaid work in  
national accounts and the GNP.

In Mexico City in 1975, there were  
6,000 attending representing 133  
countries. The Mid-Decade Confer-  
ence in Copenhagen drew 8,000 rep-  
resenting 144 countries. One hundred  
fifty-nine countries sent delegations  
to Nairobi attracting 14,000 women.

There were 2,020 delegates, 397 of  
whom were men. One hundred and  
forty-five delegations were headed by  
women, with fourteen headed by  
men. The only country to send an all  
male delegation was the Democratic  
People's Republic of Korea (Demo-  
cratic?). The United States delegation  
was composed of one-third minority  
women and represented all ages and  
areas of the country.

Ninety percent of all nations now  
have official bodies dedicated to the  
advancement of women. Half of these  
official bodies have been established  
during the U.N. Decade for Women.

The NGO Forum had over 100  
workshops a day for seven days.  
There were over one hundred fifty  
women's organizations represented,  
ranging from the World Federation of  
Public Health and Housewives in  
Dialogue, to the Mexican Psychotherapy  
Association and The International  
Center for Research on Women. There  
were workshops on every conceivable  
concern of women and in one time slot  
there might be workshops on “Community  
Based Women Working for Survival and  
Change,” “Women’s Organizations  
and Their Role in Development,”  
“How to Establish a Legal Center for  
Abused Women,” and “Older  
Women: Exploring Needs and Re-  
sources.”

In the field of education, girls and  
boys in developing countries attend  
primary school in equal numbers, but  
at the secondary level there are twice  
as many boys as girls. There are very  
few boarding schools at the secondary  
level for girls. Girls are not allowed  
back in school if they become preg-  
nant; their education is over.

In Africa three-fourths of the agri-  
cultural work is done by women.  
Women grow 84 percent of Gambia’s  
entire rice harvest. In Kenya, women  
only have access to land if they are  
married or have a son. Daughters in-  
herit only half of what a son inherits  
in Asia. As with domestic work, much  
of the women’s agricultural work  
tends to be overlooked because it is  
unpaid. Women have little access to  
agricultural education, training and  
extension services.

Older women in Holland organized  
six years ago for equal pensions for  
men and women whether they had  
worked or not. Now everyone receives  
the same pension at sixty-five. In  
Japan the younger generation will  
have adequate pensions but older  
women receive a very low government  
pension and health care is the respon-  
sibility of the children. Older women  
in Kenya remain with the family but  
if widowed all possessions are taken  
by the family. The Kenyan govern-  
ment provides health care for mothers  
and children but nothing for older  
women.

Legislation against sexual harass-  
ment was passed last year in Australia  
while Puerto Rico last month de-  
feated legislation against sexual har-  
assment. In Germany a recent survey  
showed one in four women experience  
sexual harassment on the job. A  
women’s drama group in Nigeria por-  
trays examples of sexual harassment  
for businesses and when they hear of  
a victim of sexual harassment they get

A Forgotten Majority

Fall Edition

Refugee Women

by Nancy Rindner  
Policy /Information Coordinator  
US Committee for Refugees

Three-quarters of the world’s esti-  
mated ten million refugees are women  
and girls. Among those who work to  
ameliorate the suffering accompany-  
ing the trauma of being a refugee,  
recognition of the special needs and  
strengths of female refugees has been  
slow in coming. Fortunately, this  
situation is beginning to change.

The United Nations Decade for  
Women, which marked its end with  
an international conference in Nairo-  
bi, Kenya, has drawn attention to the  
unique conditions women refugees  
face in addition to those which con-  
front all refugees, male and female.

Many women, upon becoming refu-  
gees, also become family heads for the  
first time, as husbands, fathers, broth-  
ers, and sons are lost in flight or to  
sickness and war. Refugee-producing  
situations heighten female vulnerabil-  
ity to sexual coercion and abuse. A  
high rate of illiteracy among females  
throughout the world complicates the  
transition women and girls face as  
refugees, particularly if they are reset-  
tled in a country more developed than  
their homeland. This is the case for  
most of those resettled in the United  
States.

The decade conference and work-  
shops held and the non-governmental  
forum preceding it are over; the work  
meets

“the ideas” and “ideals  
generated in Nairobi must now begin.

A New Perspective on  
the Farm Crisis

by Betty Majors

Box 484

Osceola, NE 68651

Former first national president  
of WIFE (Women in Farm  
Economics)

Not since the 1930s have we seen  
such an economic recession in the  
farm sector. The “farm crisis” is real  
as across the nation we see farmers  
and their families uprooted from their  
land by bankruptcy while small rural  
communities are dying. Small busi-  
nesses that are dependent upon agri-  
culture for their livelihood cannot  
survive without a turnaround in agri-  
culture.

The effect is the demise of the  
family farm. It is the ruination of  
small towns, communities, their  
schools, churches and hospitals. It is  
impacting county government and the  
lack of state revenue is being felt in  
all agricultural states.

Dr. Frederick of the University of  
Nebraska reported in his study that  
by 1990 rural towns (in Nebraska)  
with populations of under 900 would  
become almost non-existent. While  
this may seem unrealistic, it is be-  
cause if the family farmer doesn’t sur-  
vive, neither do the business people  
around the square.

What happens then to the people in  
rural America, the people who have  
produced food and fiber? They begin  
an outward migration into the larger  
cities where unemployment is high,  
and oftentimes with few professional  
skills other than “hard worker, loyal,  
and used to long hours,” but how  
does one fit that in on the resume?

The farm families are suffering  
emotionally — husband, wife and  
children. A “family farm” means just  
that — the involvement of each mem-  
ber of the family — in production,  
decisions, and emotional involve-  
ment. Many say the emotional in-  
volvement has become too great, but  
how does one remain emotionally  
unattached when a family that has  
spent a lifetime of work building a  
business only to see it slip through  
their fingers due to conditions over  
which they have no control.

As Eliot Janeway stated, “The col-  
lapse of the stock market did not  
begin on Wall Street, but began on  
the farms of rural America.”

Just a few short years ago, farm  
banks were considered to be the  
soundest of all banks. The Federal  
Reserve System did not even require  
them to report on delinquent farm  
loans; however, the picture has  
changed — the losses on farm loans  
by a banker were almost negligible
