Farm Crisis  
Continued from page 1

and farm failures were almost un-  
heard of, but that has all changed.  

In 1984, there were 32 banks that  
failed — nearly five times the amount  
as in 1983. The projection is that over  
200 banks will fail. Why would banks  
fail? Many failed because the money  
they had loaned to farmers could no  
longer be repaid. The reason: the  

value of farmland has depreciated,  
thus cutting the farmer's equity 20-  

50%, and the value of the commodities  
he raised sold for less than the  

cost it took to produce them.  

As Eliot Janeway stated,  
“The collapse of the stock  
market did not begin on Wall  
Street, but began on the  
farms of rural America.”  

What started as a farm problem has  

now become a national problem. The  
recession of the farm has now become  
a depression with commodity prices  
the lowest since the depression of the  
30’s.  
If someone were to ask me what are  
the three causes of the farm crisis, I  
would have to say: low commodity  
prices, low commodity prices, low  
commodity prices. Farmers cannot  
continue in farming when the cost of  
production continues to be above the  
price received for the commodity they  
raise. Then I would hurriedly add the  
other causes: the federal deficit, high  
dollar, high interest rates, embargoes,  
moratoriums, boycotts and sanctions,  
tax sheltered farming, international  
monetary fund, increased cost of pro-  
duction, cargo preference, declining  
land prices, loss of equity on farm-  
land. Of each that is listed, the farmer  
and his family have no control over  
one single factor, yet each has an im-  
pact on the return on his investment  
in farming.  

The loss of equity in farmland is  
something akin to an urban dweller  
who has bought an $80,000 home and  
has a $70,000 mortgage on his home.  
The family has the house appraised  
after four years at $40,000. They have  
then lost their equity of $10,000 plus  
another $30,000 due to depreciation  
(through no fault of their own). This  
is exactly what has happened to those  
who own agricultural land, which is  
what most farmers borrow money on  
— their land equity. Now let's extend  
the scenario and say that the husband  
works for John Deere Tractor Com-  

pany and earns $25,000 a year, but  
due to the economic conditions, the  
plant is closed because farmers are  
not buying new equipment. The wife  
works for the local chemical company  
as a bookkeeper and she earns  
$10,000 a year and her job is cut  
down to half time since farmers are  
cutting back on the chemicals they  
use, so the family income is cut from  
$35,000 to $5,000. Here is a family  
with a mortgage on their home, food  
to buy, children to keep in school,  
fuel and utilities to pay and yet the  
family has had their income cut by  
$30,000. This family has not overex-  
tended themselves, it would appear  
they have not mismanaged, yet they  
are caught in the economic recession  
just as the farm family.  

Why then should you be concerned  
about a “good farm” bill? Because of  
its impact upon the nation’s economy  
and its people. Because of the interde-  
pendence of rural and urban people.  
The single most important compo-  
nent of the American economy is the  
food and agricultural system, whether  
it is viewed in terms of consumer and  
government expenditures, of the labor  
force or in terms of its share of the  
nation’s overall economy.  

The food and agricultural sector  
employed more than 24 million work-  
ers in 1982, or 21.5 percent of the en-  
tire workforce. That was 8 million  
more employees than at all levels of  
government combined.  

In the United States, 12.7 percent  
of the disposable income is spent for  
food. Food prices have risen 16 per-  
centage points less than total urban  
living costs since 1967.  

The farm sector accounted for 2.4  
percent of the GNP in 1982, or $74  
billion, and only 11.3 percent of the  
overall value of food and agricultural  
output. However, another $553 bil-  
lion of GNP came from the farm  
input suppliers, who produce tractors,  
harvesters and other equipment, fer-  
tilizers, pesticides, pharmaceuticals  
and services ($178 billion); those who  
manufacture and process food and  
fiber ($135 billion), and those respon-  
sible for the distribution of these  
products, transportation, selling and  
serving them, another $240 billion.  

I believe that we as women  
must work together to be-  
come politically involved in  
order that we may restore  
financial security to this na-  
tion.  

The producer’s share has been con-  
stantly declining for decades. In 1950,  
for example, the farm value of $1 of  
food averaged 41¢. Today, the pro-  
ducer’s share is 27¢, while his machin-  
ery and production costs have contin-  
ued to rise. When agriculture begins  
or is in a depression, other sectors of  
the economy begin to suffer, thus in-  
dicating further the interdependency  
of agriculture and other segments of  
the economy. An example: when the  
net farm income of farmers drops, as  
it did from 1979 ($32.3 billion) to  
1983 ($16.1 billion), the business of  
input suppliers is drastically affected.  
Sales of farm inputs fell  
between 40-77 percent from 1979 to  

mid-1983. One thousand sixty-eight  
dealerships closed during this time at  
the rate of 24 times greater than the  
historical average.  

Historically, farm families have  
been very stable, but we are begin-  
ning to see the results of the stress af-  
fecting many families. We are seeing  
mental breakdowns, divorce, farm ac-  
cidents, suicide, abuse, both verbal  
and physical, as families are losing  
their farms. Children and teenagers  
are showing the stress.  

Self-esteem and self-image begin to  
diminish as the crisis continues.  

We are seeing mental  
breakdowns, divorce,  
farm accidents, suicide,  
abuse, both verbal and  
physical, as families are  
losing their farms.  

At a summer church conference the  

“farm crisis” was addressed and sev-  
eral young couples and individuals  
told of the farm problems, as they  
knew them. One young farmer ex-  
pressed his stress, “It is feeling the  
sweat trickle down your back during  
the funeral of a farmer friend whose  
stress has resulted in suicide.” “It is  
putting your arms around a sobbing  
neighbor whose machinery is disap-  
pearing down the road after a farm  
sale.”  

As rural women, our concerns are  
not much different from those of  
urban women. We are concerned for  
the welfare of our family, our com-  
munity, our state and our nation. We  
are concerned for those who are hun-  
gry and have no food, for those who  
are homeless and have no place to  
sleep, for those who are jobless and  
can find no work. We are concerned  
that we as a nation hold a position of  
leadership among nations, yet we do  
not adequately address the issues of  
human needs. The statistics one reads  
are truly “life and blood people.”  

Rural women must by virtue of  
their position be: an unpaid farm  
partner, keep the home as a haven of  
rest through good times and bad, rock  
the cradle while listening to the mar-  
ket reports, be a teacher, wife and  
lover, companion and confidante to  
the family, serve as veterinarian, psy-  
chologist, bookkeeper, gofer, and the  
anchor that keeps the family afloat.  

In Nebraska, the Commission on  
the Status of Women was not state  
funded, not because the Governor did  
not feel it was important, but because  
funding had to be cut, as well as  
budgets. These commission members  
are currently still operating because  
they are raising the funds privately.  
Nebraska now has a state shortfall of  
$31 million dollars and other farm  
states cannot be far behind. If we  
want our programs to continue across  
this nation, we MUST work together  
— urban and rural women.  

I believe that we as women must  
work together to become politically  
involved in order that we may restore  
financial security to this nation. We  
must restore rural stability. We must  
restore stability to the rural sector  
and it cannot be done unless Con-  
gress addresses the farm bill as a bi-  

partisan issue; food is not a partisan  
issue.

Women’s History  
by Jackie DeHon  
Monroe, LA  

I’ve discovered a wonderful source  
of literature about women — it’s the  
National Women’s History Project!  

This is not your ordinary catalog —  
it offers a FEAST of positive litera-  
ture, audio-visuals, and even games  
about outstanding women. Subjects  
include Adventure through World  
History. Imagine such a source and  
the tremendous effect it can have on  
young women today! It is informative  
and offers curriculum resources for  
every level of education as well as ma-  
terials for celebrating National  
Women’s History Week. Today I’m  
ordering my sweatshirt that says,  
“Write Women Back into History!”  

I called my local librarian and  
asked if she would set up a “Women’s  
History Section” and she agreed. I  
told her I'd be by this week with some  
catalogs listing powerful books about  
women from every race and every  
walk of life.  

So join me on the bandwagon to  
make our society aware of women  
and the tremendous contributions,  
previously unsung, we have made to  
the world! Write today to “National  
Women’s History Project, P.O. Box  
3716, Santa Rosa, CA 95402.” Single  
copies of the catalog cost $1.00 unless  
you become a member. With mem-  
bership ($20.00 for individuals) you  
may get as many as you care to dis-  
tribute for the price of postage.
