A battle of wills  

Michael McClure’s The Beard,  
produced and directed by Gary Cha-  
son at Houston’s Museum of Modern  
Art, 610 West Alabama, is like an  
object encased in a plastic bag. It  
moves, thrusts, rolls over as it de-  
velops a rhythm within its confined  
space.  

The play opened here December  
11. First presented about 10 years ago  
in San Francisco, The Beard gives us  
Jean Harlow (Claine Hartt) and Billy  
the Kid (Barry Gremillion) as pro-  
totypes of sex object and macho male  
thrown together time without end in  
hell or heaven or some eternity. They  
project themselves and relate to each  
other through the stereotypes they  
embody: she the writhing silky-silk-  
swathed body with contrapuntal float-  
ing boa, he in skin-tight black with  
boots.  

While ostensibly about sex, the  
play is very interesting from a  
feminist point of view as a struggle of  
wills; whose will is stronger, whose  
will dominates. Each claims to be in  
control and to be willing what is  
happening — indeed, willing the very  
existence of the other.  

She frequently repeats the state-  
ment that she has many selves and he  
must find the real one. For all of his  
momentary show of brutality (which  
results in a torn stocking and bitten  
toe) it is she who is in control, she who  
sets the pace and decides how quickly  
or slowly they proceed as each seeks  
dominance. He has moments of inde-  
pendence, but they seem like petulant  
reactions to her defiance. When they  
finally reach the point which was the  
purpose of each from the

THE FRONT PAGE, Alley  
Theater through January 11  

SUE WITTIE  

The Front Page is a comedy that  
gets its laughs at the expense of  
“niggers,” “tarts” and seduced  
stenographers. One is reminded of  
the feature line of a recent Ms.  
article: “Why we aren't laughing  
anymore...”  

This Alley Theater/Nina Vance  
production, partially funded by a  

grant from the National  
Endowment for the Arts in  
Washington, D.C., a federal  

agency, and sanctioned by the  
American Revolution Bicenten-  
nial Commission, painfully  
reminds us of the way it was 50  
years ago and how far we have to  
go.  

An incredible John Kenny set  
establishes the tawdry image of a  
1920's press room in Chicago. The  
newsmen treat women only as  
objects of derisive scorn or equally  
offensive sexual imagery as they  
recount recent seductions. The  
women who are seduced are  
mentioned by group nomenclature  
such as waitresses, stenographers  
and other “public” women.  

Negative stereotypes of women,  
Blacks and low-status workers are  
woven through the plot by the end  
of the first act, but the worst was  
yet to come. In Acts Two and  
Three, stereotypical female  
characters pass through the press  
room. Neither the good-hearted  
cleaning woman, the misunder-  

stood prostitute, the bitch  
mother-in-law nor the clinging,  
weeping bride-to-be come to any  
productive end.  

The “tart” throws herself out a  
window to save the life of the one  
man who has treated her well. Her  
destruction is the only  
“productive” end for a street  
woman.  

The bride and her mother,  
portrayed as castrating  
manipulators, cling to men. The  

methods merely differ as the  
mother tears into the leading man  
with caustic tongue while the “little  
woman” weeps her way to victory.  

The view of women is everything  
contingent upon their ability to  
please the men of the press room.  
The deepest insult does not lie in  
the writing of Hecht and  
MacArthur but in having U.S. tax  
dollars and a Bicentennial stamp  
of approval on something so  
degenerating to Blacks and  
women.  

Humor is a form of aggression in  
society and expresses those  
emotions not capable of being  
carried out overtly. Covertly they  
appear on stage. Perhaps  
theatergoers realize its “historical”  
nature but it remains to be seen if  
the status of Blacks and women  
has changed enough in fifty years  
to circumvent white male  
supremacy. We cannot stand by  
without protesting negative  
treatment in the arts no matter  
what its historic context.  

By reputation The Beard, an erotic  

play which opened at the Houston  
Museum of Modern Art and runs  
through February 1, “sounds like the  

ultimate portrayal of woman as ob-  
ject,” observes feminist critic Ger-  
trude Barnstone, but in the play “the  
male body is also celebrated through  

art.” Barnstone sees the play as a  
triumph over wills, and, Jean  
Harlow’s will be done by the play’s  
end.  

Assert yourself - act equal  

Do you begin almost every sen-  
tence with:  

“I'm sorry . . .”  

“It's only my opinion . . .”  

“I know this sounds stupid, but...”  

“I kinda think . . .” or “I sorta  
feel . . .”  

Well then, read The New Asser-  
tive Woman.  

There are many books telling  
women how to put it all together.  
The New Assertive Woman is an  
all-together “how-to” book written  
to help women, conditioned in  
dependent behavior, to become  
independent.  

One of its basic premises is that  
women must be aware of their per-  
sonal rights (see chart, “Every-  
woman’s Bill of Rights”) and assert  
themselves in repossessing their  
basic human rights.  

The authors of The New Assertive  
Woman assert that the ultimate right  
is to change behavior. Conditioned  
behavior is learned and can be un-  
learned. When women choose to ig-  
nore or do not claim their rights, they  
resort to playing games such as “the  

sufferer” or “after all I’ve done for  
you.”  
Example:  
Non-Assertive  

If you appreciated all I’ve done for  
you, you would want to help me more.  

Assertive  
I need the cleaning picked up. Will  
you please stop by and get it before  
four o'clock?  
Another game is, “It doesn’t mat-  
ter to me; whatever you want.”  

Example:  
Non-Assertive  
It doesn’t make any difference.  
Any place you want to go—whatever  
you want to eat or do.  
Assertive  
I want to go see a movie. I would  
like to eat fish. I'm tired and want to  
rest and do nothing.  

Unlike the manipulating  
Fascinating Woman and the sub-  
missive Total Woman, The New  
Assertive Woman attempts to undo  
years of “feminization.” It tries to  
help a woman find her own indepen-  
dent identity and to be responsible to  
herself for her feelings, ideas, and  
behavior.  

The authors include a test of female  
assertiveness:  

1. Did you say what you wanted to  
say?  

2. Were you direct and unapologe-  
tic?  

3. Did you stand up for your own  
rights without infringing on the  
rights of the other person?  

4. Were you sitting or standing in  
an assertive posture?  

5. Did your voice sound strong and  
calm? Were your gestures re-  
laxed?  
6. Did you feel good about your-  
self after you finished speaking?  
Once a woman learns to be asser-  
tive, she has acquired skills that will  
give her more choices, more indepen-  
dence, more self-esteem and more  
control of her own life.  
Women are born equal. The New  
Assertive Woman shows women  
how to act equal.
