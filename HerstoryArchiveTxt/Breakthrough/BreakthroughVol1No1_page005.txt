Power--tool or weapon?

Aileen Hernandez has said she  
feels like a senior stateswoman  
in the movement.

I would describe myself dif-

ferently. I'm a “VFR” - a  
Veteran of the Feminist  
Revolution.

I hope it will never be  

necessary for any of us to  
describe ourselves as DVFR’s -  
Disabled Veterans of the  
Feminist Revolution.

Many of you know already that  
in the last year or so I have  
become increasingly preoc-  
cupied with concepts of power,  
its uses by the movement in-  
ternally and externally, and the  
effects of all this on women.

Simultaneously, it may or  
may not be worth noting, I have  
withdrawn from any position of  
power within the movement. I’m  
not sure what conclusion should  
be drawn from this, though  
maybe as I exercised it, I had  
the sudden realization that we  
were all playing around with  
what could be a deadly weapon if  
we turned it upon ourselves. I  
think we need to recognize,  
however, that power corrupts  
only the corruptible, who  
mistake it for an end in itself,  
instead of a tool to accomplish  
our goals.

In Houston we elected Karen  
DeCrow our national president  
on a platform that commits us  
not just to get women into the  
mainstream of American life,  
but to change the very nature of  
that mainstream itself.

I think what we are saying is  
that to achieve equality in a  
society that is fundamentally  
corrupt, compassionless,  
dehumanizing, and destructive  
is to stop short of realizing our  
own full potential for social  
change. I believe most of us have  
aspirations that go beyond.

For the one equality women all  
over the world have already  
achieved is the Equality of  

Consequences. No inventory of  
the major challenges and crises  
of our times discloses any from  
whose effects women will be  
exempt by virtue of our sex.

If “the boys” decide to have a  
nuclear exchange, it will do us  
no good to run outside waving  
our arms at some incoming missile  
or looming mushroom cloud  
yelling, ‘Skip me--I’m a  
woman!”

We know that poverty in this  
country is primarily the problem  
of all women—that most women  
are only a husband away from  
welfare.

In the face of inflation (when  
we are paid 40 percent less than  
men), in the face of unem-  
ployment (when the rate is  
already 35 percent higher for  
women than men), with the  
prospect of recession or  
depression (when we know that  
like minority men, having been  
the last hired, we’ll be the first to  
go), with energy shortages and  
soaring corporate profits (from  
which we—in our bottom-of-the-  
barrel positions—derive no  
benefits), with the threat of  
world-wide famine, while  
chicken and cattle are destroyed  
and milk is dumped, with the  
rape and pollution of the public  
environment, isn’t it time to get  
in on the act, to make some of  
the decisions ourselves, to push  
for changes in this bizarre social  
order?

Nothing we could do could  
possibly be any worse or more  
inept than what we see being  
done!

We undoubtedly have to do a  
lot of heavy thinking about the  
design of a new mainstream and  
a lot more organizing to have  
power enough to press it into  
place.

But I see the feminist  
movement as the only viable  
movement for social change left  

alive and flourishing in this  
country. And it has always been  
the only one that intended to  
exclude no one genuinely  
committed to our goals for  
membership and participation—  
not by race, ethnic origin, social  
or economic class, religion or  
sex.

As an organization, NOW has  
no commitment to any “Ism” of  
the radical left or radical right—  
we have fended off all attempts  
to subvert us to so-called higher  
causes that will, as a by-product,  
solve our problems.

With Aileen, I believe that all  
of the social issues of our time  
are feminist issues and that we  
ignore them to our peril. To  
implement the resolutions still  
on our agenda, we must make  
plans with full awareness of the  
social context in which we are  
operating. National problems  
like inflation, recession, the  
threat of depression jeopardize  
everything we have ac-  
complished so far, and  
everything we have still to do in  
the future. A national depression  
would have a backlash effect on  
the women’s movement that  
could set us back fifty or a  
hundred years.

When budgets get tight in  
government agencies, cor-  
porations, educational in-  
stitutions—who’s the first to go?

The resistance to establishing  
child care centers, to im-  
plementing Title IX Guidelines,  
to adopting new credit policies  
for women stiffens and  
multiplies. If it’s been tough  
raising money for our causes  
and candidates in these affluent  
years, what do you think our  
chances will be in lean ones? A  
collapsing stock market has  
already caused the Ford  
Foundation to consider cutting  
its grants program in half—  
before we even tapped their till.

As a speaker at the California  
NOW State Conference in Oc-  
tober 1973, I had said: “When  
we speak about redesigning  
society, we should be honest  
enough to confront the fact that  
such charity should begin at  
home. If we really intend to  
create a society genuinely dif-  
ferent in quality from our  
present one. If we really intend  
to exercise power in new ways,  
we should begin within our own  
organization. The sudden  
acquisition of power by those  
who have never had it before can  
be intoxicating and we run the  
risk of becoming absorbed in  
petty power games that in the  
last analysis can only be self-  
defeating. And sadly, the first  
impulse to some of us entrusted  
with this new power is to imitate  
the way we’ve seen men use it.  
We have to use the power we  
have within NOW in our  
relationships with each other,  
individually and structurally, in  
new ways. We must begin with  
each other to restore to power a  
necessary humanitarian  
discipline.

I believe the state level of  
NOW is the most important level  
for organizational activities at

Before feminists took up the issue  
of rape it was a sex-linked offense in  
the minds of the public and the courts.  
Today, the mere suggestion that a  
woman takes pleasure during an act of  
violence with her life at stake is sick.

Yet, in early December, a novelty  
store in Memorial City displayed and  
sold a bumper sticker reading: HELP  
STAMP OUT RAPE—SAY YES.

Gay Cosgriff, a member of North-  
west NOW, discovered the fluorescent  
red-on-black item while shopping for  
a Christmas gift.

She complained of its offensiveness to  
the owner of the store in light of  
the recent rape-murders of eight  
Houston women, one of which occur-  
red less than a mile from Memorial  
City.

“Nothing doing, lady. We'd be out  
of business if we took things off our  
shelf because one person found some-  
thing wrong with it,” the owner said.

Cosgriff called her Northwest  
NOW sisters and Linda Cryer, the  
city’s rape expert.

An action was planned.

The media were called.

“My intent was not only to remove  
the bumper sticker from this particu-  
lar store but also to alert other shop-  
keepers who may unknowingly have  
bought this bumper sticker in a large  
lot. I also wanted to raise public aw-  
areness so that consumers would take  
the same action I did,” Cosgriff said.

On Friday morning, Dec. 5th, three  
television stations and several radio  
stations were asked to meet the  

this stage of our efforts. We need  
to commit ourselves to doubling  
the number of chapters in every  
state—every year. With or  
without the right to endorse  
political candidates, we need to  
become so pervasive in every  
state that we can build the  
discomfort of all candidates  
until they are responsive to our  
needs. We need to become an  
itch they can never quite scratch  
enough.

With this kind of organization,  
we can proceed to build  
coalitions not only with all the  
dispossessed in our society—the  
women, minorities, the poor, the  
aged—but also with the disen-  
chanted—those members of the  
middle class of our society who  
have in the past been  
manipulated into anger toward  
those below them on the  
economic ladder. Their anger  
and hostility should be  
redirected upward to the top 1  
percent who should be carrying  
far more of the economic burdens  
of this society than they now do.

Memorial City store.

“I was going to repeat my request  
to the owner . . . but this time—in the  
presence of cameras and tape recor-  
ders,” Cosgriff replied.

The action was planned for 1 p.m.

KILT Radio ran a newscast on the  
hour reporting the planned action. By  
coincidence, the storeowner heard the  
broadcast and removed the bumper  
stickers.

When Susan Wright of KPRC-TV,  
Nancy Carney of KHOU-TV and  
George Hatt of KXYZ Radio arrived  
in the company of the feminists mo-  
ments later, the owner told them he  
had stopped selling the bumper  
sticker.

“Considering what's been happen-  
ing in the news recently,” he said,  
“I agree with them . . .” He added  
that he removed it after “a lady  
complained.”

Linda Cryer reacted by saying,  
“The bumper sticker is a very careless  
statement. It sanctions by implication  
the crime of rape in our society with-  
out taking into account the brutality,  
humiliation, terror and disgust a rape  
victim goes through."

“We are not through,” says Cos-  
griff. “Our next step is to get the man-  
ufacturer, Modern Card Company, to  
stop printing and distributing this par-  
ticular stock item.”

“The media helped us bring it to  
public attention. We hope we will  
have public support,” Cosgriff con-  
cluded.
