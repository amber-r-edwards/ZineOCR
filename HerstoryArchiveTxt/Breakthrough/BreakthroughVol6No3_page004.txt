With the 50th anniversary of the  
National Council of Negro Women  
approaching, Frito-Lay is extending  
two special offers in support of  
NCNW strides towards future im-  
provements for Black women and  
their families.  

First, Frito-Lay has commissioned  
a prominent Black female artist to il-

poster. The poster honors Black  

Decade for Women  
The Decade for Women, proclaimed by  
the United Nations to eliminate discrimi-  
nation against women, will end in 1985.  
Canada has made progress in enhancing  
the status of women, particularly at the  
constitutional level. Section 15 of the  
Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which  
enshrines equality rights, came into effect  
on 17 April 1985. This milestone is a  
monument to the work of Canadian  
women such as Therese Casgrain and  
Emily Murphy, both of whom are com-  
memorated on postage stamps in this final  
year of the Decade.  

Born in Montreal, Therese Casgrain  
founded the Ligue des droits de la femme  
(League for Women’s Rights) in 1920. The  
League tackled problems affecting  
women, including their right to vote in  
Quebec, which had been recognized at the  
federal level since 1918. The Quebec  
National Assembly had voted against twelve  
motions for this right. In 1938, Therese  
Casgrain succeeded in having the women’s  
right to vote included in the platform of  
the Liberal Party. The party won the 1939  
provincial election and honoured its com-  
mitment in 1940, in spite of opposition  
from some members of the clergy. Therese  
Casgrain subsequently worked for many  
other social and political causes and repre-  
sented Canada outside the country on

many occasions. She was appointed to the  
Senate in 1970.  

Emily Murphy was born in Cooksville,  
Ontario. Already well-known for her  
novels written under the pseudonym  
Janey Canuck, she was appointed judge of  
the Edmonton Women’s Court in 1916.  
She thus became the first woman magis-  
trate in the British Empire. However, a  
British common law ruling stated that  
women were persons in matters of pains  
and penalties, not in matters of rights and  
privileges. Some argued that this pre-  
vented her from becoming a magistrate.  
The Alberta Supreme Court nevertheless  
upheld her judicial authority. Later, Mur-  
phy and four other feminists requested a  
clarification of the law that excluded  
women from the Canadian Senate on the  
same grounds. They won their court ac-  
tion, better known as the “Persons Case,”  
in 1929.  

Stamp design  

The principal design elements in each of  
these stamps are portraits of Therese Cas-  
grain and Emily Murphy, with back-  
ground sketches indicating the principal  
concerns of their active careers. Muriel  
Wood is the talented portrait artist; Ralph  
Tibbles is responsible for art direction and  
typography.

the homeless woman, and many are in  
the planning stages. With federal cut-  
backs continuing, communities are  
faced with a dwindling amount of re-  
sources to provide for those in real  
need, so we must continue to network  
together to marshal our contacts and  
resources to provide help.  

We must continue to lobby the  
political arena to improve the mental  
health services and revamp the anti-  
quated systems that allow so many to  
fall through the cracks in our system.  
For in the long run we all end up  
paying more as taxpayers for the  
eventualities of non-treatment and in-  
tervention and the wasted lives and  
lost dreams of our “sisters” will never  
be reclaimed.
