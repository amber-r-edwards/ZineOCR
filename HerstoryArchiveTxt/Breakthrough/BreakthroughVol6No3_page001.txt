PRESIDENT’S  
CORNER  

By Connie Woodruff -  

If there is any truth to the rumor  
that the women’s movement in the  
United States is suffering from bat-  
tle fatigue, last month’s NACW an-  
nual convention indicated that com-  
missions throughout the country are  
not victims of this alleged malaise.  

Matter of fact, we appear to have  
accelerated our pace to gain full  
equality for women, strengthened  
our forces and energetically forged  
ahead toward that utopian state.  

What is missing, are some of the  
veteran faces in the movement.  
Women like Bella Abzug, Betty  
Friedan and Gloria Steinem have  
been less visible, but others have re-  
placed them on the firing lines. The  
difference also is that the movement,  
moving into its second decade, is no  
longer a phenomenon, no longer a  
media event and far less controver-  
sial since it has given up bra burning  
and the like.  

What has taken the place of these  
“unprecedented acts” by women is a  
healthy dose of professionalism.  
Women are overtly competing in the  
private and public sectors, the  
woman as a corporate entity as well  
as homemaker is accepted as given  
and we've successfully established  
the notion we will do our own thing.  

Commissions on Women are mi-  
crosystems of the new women’s lead-  
ership. We have always been and  
continue to be a conglomerate col-  
lection of ethnics, socio-economic  
interests and individualism whether  
we come from urban, suburban or  
rural America. And our diversity  
within individual commissions is the  
glue which holds us together.  

Because of our political origins,  
we have been less flamboyant than  
some of our sister groups, but this  
has added to our staying power be-  
cause we have not been a direct  
threat to the status quo. There is  
something to be said about having  
power and the good sense not to  
flaunt it until the appropriate time.  

Recently a woman from Russia  
tried to take us on a guilt trip charg-  
ing that the American woman’s  
weariness of the movement endan-  
gered women’s progress worldwide.  
Nothing could be farther from the

truth. We have not tired of efforts to  
bring us full cycle into first-class  
citizenship, rather we are quietly re-  
grouping and strategizing for the  
full-scale war needed to reach our  
goals.  

No group has been more con-  
scious of world hunger than U.S.  
women. No group has been more  
concerned with universal teenage  
pregnancy than commissions on  
women. No females are more rev-  
ered than the U.S. older female.  

Women in America have a world-  
wide perception but know full well  
their primary focus must be on the  
status of women in this country and  
the importance of being tuned in to  
each other before orchestrating the  
futures of women in Europe, Africa,  
Asia and Southeast Asia.  

A close examination of the United  
Nations concluding the Decade for  
Women conference in Nairobi ham-  
mered home this philosophy. Little  
has changed in the status of women  
around the world since Mexico City  
in 1974. But in that interim period  
much has changed for women in the  
U.S. Not enough of course, but one  
can see some progress has been  
made in employment, invasion of  
non-traditional job areas, parenting,  
male-female relationships, educa-  
tion, and politics.  

We have discovered the joy and  
comfort of sharing problems and  
solutions with each other and that  
has been one of the basis of  
strengths within the commissions for  
women. We have learned to listen to  
each other and to disagree without  
being disagreeable. That is no mean  
trick.  

In cities, counties and states all  
over America women’s commissions  
have become the alternative route  
for women who need the company  
and sisterhood of other women to  
cope with job, family, personal deci-  
sions and other points of potential  
stress.  

It is an alternative which even the  
opponents of contemporary femi-  
nism find difficult to challenge and  
impossible to stop. I believe Com-  
missions on the Status of Women,  
especially those affiliated with  
NACW are the future leaders of the  
movement to bring American  
women into the maturity of equality.

Revelation of a Problem  

Sisters Without  
Shelter  

by Janie Arnold, 1701 Highland Drive, Newport Beach, CA 92660  

What does a city in Florida that  
votes to put arm rests on all their park  
benches have in common with a city  
in New Jersey that strings barbed wire  
over its heating vents behind its build-  
ings? The sad answer is, they are both  
using this method as a measure to dis-  
courage the homeless from sleeping  
there.  

The new wave of homeless, whose  
numbers are only estimates, people  
our cities in the shadows. They seek  
refuge in all night laundromats, bus  
stations, and cars parked on dark  
streets. Among this throng, is a phe-  
nomenon that is unique to our time—  
that is the homeless woman. They  
range in age from early teens to late  
seventies, but surprisingly most are in  
their mid-forties. Some are peo-  
ple rejected by families, some are mildly  
retarded, some are victims of alcohol  
and drug abuse, and some are unem-  
ployed and have lost their home or  
apartment and do not have funds for  
first and last month to reestablish.  
Other women have found that they  
are impoverished when a devastating  
illness of a spouse leaves them wid-  
owed and destitute. The great finan-  
cial loss affecting women through di-  
vorce, especially the middle-aged  
woman who never worked outside the  
home, is a situation leading many to  
the streets. But many are emotionally  
disturbed and remain confused about  
the dilemma with which they are una-  
ble to cope. All live in a vacuum of  
fear and despair, existing in a loosely  
knit subculture of isolation from the  
rest of the world.  

The women have found themselves  
completely disenfranchised. With no  
address so that they might apply for  
benefits or even food stamps, they eat  
castoffs from the local supermarkets  
or restaurants, they exchange soda  
bottles for cigarette money, and at  
times trade sexual favors for food, al-  
cohol, or a night of shelter. Many of  
those who do receive assistance are  
often robbed of their meager allot-  

ments by street criminals who find  
them easy prey. Many of these women  
wear the outward scars of beatings  
taken while trying to protect the last  
vestiges of their scavenged posses-  
sions and carry the unseen scars of de-  
spair on their spirits.  

They fade into the background, for  
they have learned to distrust strang-  
ers. They are easy to overlook as they  
shuffle through the park during the  
day, huddle in an all-night laundro-  
mat or wash their mismatched socks  
in a sink at the bus station bathroom.  
They shrink from attention, hoping to  
avoid confrontations with the law, or  
those who are bent on breaking it.  
Many uninformed, but well-inten-  
tioned, individuals feel that the “bag  
ladies” are content with their plight,  
that in some way they “chose” to live  
like that. Shunning attention these  
street women need sustained counsel-  
ing and outreach to allay their fears  
and rebuild their self-esteem. Other  
women need a long-term board and  
care type setting, for their mental in-  

stability precludes their being on their  
own without medication and a shelter.  
None of us believe we could end up  

this way. We are someone’s wife,  
mother, sister or daughter. But so  
were these women somewhere along  
the way. Stop and think about that for  
a minute. There is a common bond  
between us all.  

Across the nation news and  
magazines have placed more and  
more emphasis on the homeless and  
we all have an opportunity to decide  
how we can be involved and help. We  

know that in areas of social impact,  
especially as it concerns women, we  
are the ones to work together, deter-  
mine solutions, and volunteer the  
woman-power to put projects in  
place.  

Many small projects are in place  
across the country to meet the need of
