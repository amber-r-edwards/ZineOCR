other women to apply for the job so
as to trap the perpetrator.

As an example of women’s prob-
lems in developing countries, Africa
has the highest fertility rate in the
world at 6.4 children per woman
while it is 3.8 for the world as a
whole. Polygamy exists for men only,
leaving many rural areas populated
primarily with women and children
while the men work in the cities. Sev-
enty-three percent of the women and
43% of the men are illiterate. Until
1964 there had never been a woman
with a secondary degree in math or
science.
On a more positive note, there is a
dramatic increase in the number of
countries that have equal pay legisla-
tion on their statute books making it
illegal to give men and women differ-
ent wages for the same jobs. In 1978
twenty-eight countries had such legis-
lation and only five years later, in
1983, ninety countries had passed
legislation on equal pay.

The number of women who are
members of their national legislatures
is increasing. For example:

U.S.S.R. 13% CHINA 21%
SWEDEN 30% EUROPE 11%
CUBA 23% USA 5%

While different cultures cause spe-
cific concerns for women, there is a
commonality in viewing teenage preg-
nancy, the need for sex education
which is non-existent in developing
countries, and equity in education and
employment as major problems world-
wide.

An Australian woman who is a
member of Parliament gave us good
advice. “The hand that rocks the
cradle should also rock the boat.”

was well represented in Nairobi by
June Dunbar, Robin Crigler of Ken-
tucky, Marilyn Flood of NYC, and

City and Denver. Approximately 25
people representing seven states par-
ticipated in the two-day conference

fancy accommodations in hopes of
greater regional representation.

Women in Leadership; Marketing for
Survival; Issues of Rural Women; Es-
tablishing an Effective 501(c)(3); Special
Event Fund Raising; and Legislation,
Resolutions, and Us.

Active Year for Louisiana

With commissions in Alexandria/-
Pineville, Baton Rouge, Hammond,
Lafayette, Lake Charles, Monroe,
Shreveport, New Orleans, and the
governor's commission created by
Governor Edwin Edwards in 1984,
women in Louisiana have been pro-
vided with clearinghouses for infor-
mation on a variety of local needs.

The nine commissions have dealt
with topics including self-sufficiency,
skills training, health, domestic vio-
lence, child abuse, the family,
women’s history, older women, child
care, and legislation. The Lake
Charles CSW sponsored the confer-
ence “Getting Involved” in which
over 800 women attended seeking in-
formation on many of the topics
listed above. “Year of the Woman-
Women: The Economy and Public
Policy” was another well-attended
conference sponsored by the Shreve-
port CSW. For a complete report on
the past year’s activities in Louisiana,

rector of the Louisiana Governor's

duction of five Maryland women into

ticipation has been instrumental in
shaping state and national affairs.

North Carolina Council
Awards Grants

The North Carolina Council on the
Status of Women has awarded
$262,500 in grants to local and com-
munity rape crisis centers to assist
victims of sexual assault.

Cindi Dorman, director of sexual
assault programs said monies come
from a variety of sources which in-
clude federal and state funds which
are used to match local funds pro-
vided by donations and United Way.

Rapes in North Carolina have in-
creased by 65 percent since 1976. In
an effort to address the problem,
NCCSW awarded 17 grants to com-
munity agencies and local rape crisis
centers.

grams or on sexual assault, contact

New York City

On July 17, the Commission coor-
dinated a teleconference via satellite
between New York City and Nairobi,
Kenya, the site of the world confer-
ence marking the end of the U.N.
Decade for Women. The program,
DATELINE: NAIROBI, emanated
from the Kenyatta International Con-
ference Centre and was produced
with the cooperation of the Washing-
ton-based Women’s Institute for
Freedom of the Press, Comsat Gen-
eral, Manhattan Cable TV, RCA
American Communications, Inc. and
Vidlo Video.

Immediately following the New
York City segment, a similar program
was transmitted via satellite between
Boston and Nairobi, and one week
later between Washington, D.C. and
Nairobi.

DATELINE: NAIROBI is part of
Project SHARE, a program of Intel-
sat established to demonstrate the use
of advanced technology in the fields
of health and education.
