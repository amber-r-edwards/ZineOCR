Services for Women— At our new  
women’s center (see story, page 12)  
we'd like to have a directory of  
services and information for  
women, in such areas as child care,  
legal services, health care, abortion  
agencies, welfare rights,  
legislation, and so on.  
Any ideas? Suggestions for areas  
to include? Names of agencies  
“which help women? We would  
appreciate your input. Send ideas  
to Breakthrough.  

Wanted— Advice  
for Medicare Folks  

Can anyone come up with a service  
that will answer questions for  
Medicare clients? Most of the  
literature distributed by the local  
Social Security office is inadequate  
and not tailored to specific  
individual problems. Send ideas to  
Breakthrough.  

Feminist Library — Lilith, Woman's  
place will have a library and needs  
books, periodicals and everything  
else a library needs. Rather than  
give gifts individually to my friends  
this holiday season, I subscribed to  
periodicals and bought books for  
our new Feminist Library. Until  
the new center opens they will be  
housed with Breakthrough. To  
avoid duplication when giving  
your contributions, call Sue Wittie  
at 524-9500 to ask for titles of  
existing collection.
