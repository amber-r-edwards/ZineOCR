1985 Convention Highlights

Special Supplement to Breakthrough— August, 1985

Convention Firsts

For the first time in NACW history,  
chairpersons of commissions around  
the country held a conference to ex-  
change ideas and opinions on com-  
mon problems, and discussed the fu-  
tures of their commissions. Like the  
Executive Directors’ Exchange, the  
Chairs of Commissions’ Exchange  
will become an annual part of the  
NACW convention.

For the first time a Lesbian Caucus  
was held. Lesbian women shared their  
desire for more information about  
community events corresponding to  
convention sites and looked forward  
to holding another caucus in Chicago.

For the first time the NACW Board  
received the support of the NACW  
body to pursue alternative funding to  

Excellent  
Keynote

Fay Kanin, President of the Acad-  
emy of Motion Picture Arts and Sci-  
ences Foundation, delivered a dy-  
namic keynote address during the  
opening session of the NACW Con-  
vention in Pasadena.

Indicating that women have come  
some distance in gaining healthier at-  
titudes, Kanin said, “We’ve grown to  
an unapologetic state of our achieve-  
ments and our wants.” She also indi-  
cated women have learned to empa-  
thize with each other’s problems and  
have worked together to understand  
and overcome them.

Kanin graduated from the Univer-  
sity of Southern California and then  
worked day and night to learn the  
movie business. An award-winning  
television and screenwriter, Kanin  
brings dignity to the industry and has  
served as president of the Academy  
and Board of the Writers’ Guild. In  
1974, she won an Emmy Award for a  
film entitled “Tell Me Where It  
Hurts,” stories about blue-collar  
women.

Delegate

One of the most essential requests  
was to schedule the Directions to the  
Board meeting much earlier in the  
convention in order to allow adequate  
time to discuss concerns between  
delegates and board members. While  
this will mean elections will be held  
earlier in the convention, the point is  
well taken. Several other directions in-  
clude: 

That the Chairs of Commissions’  
meeting become a regular part of fu-  
ture NACW convention schedules: 

underwrite expenses incurred by  
board members’ travel to quarterly  
meetings.

For the first time the Fundraising  
Committee announced that the  
Women’s Commission Research and  
Education Fund, Inc., had received its  
first donations totaling $26,000.

For the first time (beginning in  
1986-87) NACW Board members will  
begin holding two-year terms to ad-  
dress the issue of continuity for the  
national organization.

For the first time NACW has an of-  
ficial Public Relations Committee  
composed of volunteers throughout  
the country. Breakthrough will get  
even better!

A few moments are stolen from the convention to get to know

each other. Sharing ideas are: (from left) Connie Woodruff,  
NACW President; Fay Kanin, President of the Academy of Mo-  
tion Picture Arts and Sciences Foundation; Dorothy Jonas, Di-  
rector of the California Commission; and Barbara Robinson,  

Pasadena Commission.

Resolutions Adopted

NACW adopted the following reso-  
lutions at its 16th national conven-  
tion:

NACW opposes the adoption of the  
current budget and tax reform pro-  
posals which disadvantage women  
and children and demands formula-  
tion of policies which reflect fairness  
and equity.

NACW encourages Congress to ap-  
point House and Senate resolutions  
designating an appropriate week in  
March as “Women’s History Week”  
and requests the President issue a  
proclamation calling upon the people  
of the U.S. to observe such a week  
with appropriate activities.

NACW endorses the provision of  
the Export Administration Act passed  
by the U.S. House of Representatives,  
which decreased U.S. support for  
Apartheid... NACW also urges its  
members to write their congressional  
representatives and senators to sup-  
port economic and political sanctions  
against South Africa. NACW and its  
member commissions support the Free  
South Africa movement and its many  
supporters throughout this country  
who have demonstrated their commit-  
ment to ending Apartheid and pledge  

That pay equity be reaffirmed as a  
primary focus for the coming year and  
that the board examine the possibility  
of joining a national pay equity or-  
ganization.

To reaffirm NACW’s ongoing com-  
mitment to establishing a national of-  
fice and discuss the process with offi-  
cials in Washington, D.C.

To heighten the public's awareness  
of NACW through continuous public  
relations efforts.

That the board examine alternative  

methods of funding for board mem-  
bers’ travel expenses to quarterly  
meetings.

That the term “displaced homemak-  
er” be replaced with “women in  
transition” reflecting a more accurate  
plight of women today.

To utilize the media to identify and  
highlight the hard-won rights of  
women currently under attack.

To continue efforts to involve  
women of color in all facets of plan-  

ning and presenting at NACW con-  

ventions.

The Lesbian Caucus of the NACW  
held its first meeting at this year’s an-  
nual convention in Pasadena and  
agreed to meet again next June at the  
1986 convention in Chicago. The  
group will work with members of the  
Chicago Commission to plan for next  
year. If you would like further infor-

In May, the Women’s Commissions  
Research and Education Fund  
(WCREF) notified NACW of its  
awarded grant of $25,000 from the  
Rockefeller Foundation and $1,000

for women through education, health,  
and leadership development.

That a Women of Color Caucus be  
placed on the agenda for next year’s  
convention.

NACW convention prepare an annual  
convention report following the con-  
vention.

That the board examine the benefits
