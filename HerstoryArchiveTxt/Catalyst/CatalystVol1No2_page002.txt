WAGES FOR  
HOUSEWORK  

SELMA JAMES SPEAKS OUT  

ON WAGES FOR HOUSEWORK  
by Kathy Munzer  

“There can be no true equality until  
all women get a wage from the govern-  
ment for our housework.” So says  
Selma James, housewife, mother,  
author, typist, and founder of the In-  
ternational Wages for Housework  
Campaign, as she embarks on her  
1980 speaking and organizing tour of  
the U.S.  

In addition to appearances at un-  

iversities, Ms. James plans to confer  
with women’s groups here to ex-  
change information and experiences.  
She was recently in West Germany on  
a similar mission.  

Selma James was the driving force  
behind the successful British cam-  
paign to increase the Family  
Allowance, a payment to mothers  
from the government.  

The Wages for Housework Cam-  
paign in the U.S. was central in pass-  
ing the resolution recommending that  
Welfare be called a wage and calling  
for increases at the 1979 IWY  

We are not just a Book  
but a Source of up-  
dated recommendations  
for Gay Men and  
Gay Women  

*For Parents and Friends,  
too*  

Congratulations  
Catalyst  

A Lot of Luck to You  

Women’s Conference in Houston. Ms.  
James says, “Welfare must be increas-  
ed to reflect the value of housework.”  
Parents Magazine, August 1979, has  
cited the worth of homemaking at  
$35,000 and called for payment of  
these services.  

Selma James is the author whose  
works include: the contemporary  
classic Power of Women and the  
Subversion of the Community, which  
has shaped the international debate  
on the nature and value of women’s  
work in the home. The book has been  
translated into five languages.  

Selma James was a featured  
speaker at the Historic Cheltenham  
Literary Festival in 1979, where her  
presentation, “Ms. Jane Austen,”  
received a standing ovation. She also  
spoke in Parliament last year in  
defense of a bill to decriminalize pro-  
stitution.  

Ms. James argues that Wages for  
Housework would expand women’s  
options. “We have had to choose bet-  
ween our children and our in-  
dependence. Childlessness is a terri-  
ble price to pay for a little freedom,”  
she says.
