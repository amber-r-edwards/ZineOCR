WOMEN  
Collectively written by  
the staff of W.I.C.C.A.  

W.I.C.C.A. (Women in Crisis Can  
Act) is a collective of women dedi-  
cated to meeting the needs of women  
in crisis. She is a hotline designed to  
create an atmosphere where women  
can get validation and support for  
their feelings, ideas, and problems.  

W.I.C.C.A. was created in October  
of 1974 by a large group of women  
who came together to share their frus-  
trations at how women were being  
treated by the established social ser-  
vice agencies. All of these women  
were feminists, many active in alter-  
native women’s services. Some were  
also professionals employed within  
the social service bureaucracy, want-  
ing women to get the services they de-  
served but often prevented because  
of the anti-woman philosophies and  
assumptions which prevailed and still  
do prevail in these agencies, such as  
pigeon-holing a woman as a “case”  
with a narrow clinical classification,  
ignoring the sociological context.  

Out of this frustration came a vi-  
sion of a complete alternative service  
for women: a 24-hour hotline, mobile  
units to transport women and their  
children to safe housing, and alter-  
native temporary housing. In April,  
1975, a part-time hotline was opened  
and has been in operation ever since.  

For almost a year now, women-  
organized safe housing has been  
available through the Shelter Task  
Force of the Abused Woman Coali-  
tion, of which W.I.C.C.A. is a member.  
To date, however, round-the-clock  
coverage for the hotline, sufficient  
housing, and the mobile units remain  
an unrealized dream we are constant-  
ly striving toward.  

As a feminist collective, we believe  
that women have, and always have  
had, the strength to control our own  
lives. W.I.C.C.A. operates on this prin-  
ciple both in our working relation-  
ships within the collective and in our  
work with women who call the line.  
The caller experiencing crisis in one  
area still has many strengths and  
skills on other levels. W.I.C.C.A.’s role  
is to facilitate the process by which a  
woman in crisis realizes her capabil-  
ities and defines her own solutions.  

Our all-volunteer organization in-  
corporates a collective decision-mak-  
ing process, meaning that every wom-  
an has an equal voice and an equal  
chance for participation. Staffers  
come together bi-weekly to discuss  
business and issues that arise from  
calls and to give each other support  
in the work that we do. A staffer gen-  
erally works for a 3-hour shift on the  
phones once a week along with an-  
other staffer. Through close commun-  
ication, we come to learn how we as  

women can work more effectively  
with each other and with the women  
who call us. Our lines are presently  
open from 5-11 p.m. Tuesday through  
Friday.  

W.I.C.C.A. deals with a variety of  
issues encompassing concerns and  
problems in response to any woman’s  
needs. Many of the callers seek in-  
formation about medical and mental  
health services such as obtaining an  
abortion, dealing with the many as-  
pects of rape, and how to cope with  
depression. Some relate to immediate  
crisis such as woman abuse, suicide  
prevention, and/or the need for emer-  
gency housing. Other callers have  
questions about legal matters, public  
aid, and food stamps. Many of our  
callers just need to talk and feel sup-  
port from another woman. Another  
important service is providing sup-  
port and information specifically for  
lesbians.  

Once a woman becomes involved  
in a W.I.C.C.A. training session, she  
learns active listening and techniques  
for helping a woman to see her situa-  
tion in a new way. She learns to ef-  
fectively use resources available for  
women. Women come to W.I.C.C.A.  
with diverse but equally valuable  
skills and personal experiences which  
we share in small and large group dis-  
cussions.

The W.I.C.C.A. training program  
consists of seven sessions, with em-  
phasis on skill-sharing discussions and  
crisis intervention techniques. Train-  
ing sessions deal explicitly with the  
issues raised in calls. Women with  
special knowledge and experience  
meet with the trainees to share their  
information and help answer ques-  
tions.  

The next series of training sessions  
begins on Thursday, March 20. We  
will meet for seven weeks from 7:30  
to 9:30 p.m. at 1628-A W. Belmont. All  
women are welcome; all skills are im-  
portant. If you don’t have the time  
available, tax-deductible contribu-  
tions will enable our work to con-  
tinue. Call 528-3303 for further in-  
formation or to sign up for training.
