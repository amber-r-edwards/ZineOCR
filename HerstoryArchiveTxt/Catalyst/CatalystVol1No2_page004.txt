ALIVE!

Urana Records, a division of Wise  
Women Enterprises  
by Susan Schleef  

An album which many women’s  
music fans had long awaited was fin-  
ally recorded this past fall. “Alive!,”  
the San Francisco-based jazz group,  
has produced their first album with  
Urana Records. The album contains a  
variety of musical styles and instru-  
mental combinations. As always, the  
ensemble sections are rhythmically  
tight and offer a rich, solid back-  
ground for many fine solos by in-  
dividual band members. I am often  
disappointed to hear the talk after an  
Alive! concert focus mainly on the  
singer when each of the women is a  
more than competent musician in her  
own right. In fact, my only criticism  
of the record would be that I'd like to  
hear more extended solos featuring  
each of the players.  

“Somebody's Talkin’ to You,” by  
Michele Rosewoman, begins the al-  
bum in a lively upbeat style. The num-  
ber features some amazing bass play-  
ing by Suzanne Vincenza and a per-  
cussion solo with Barbara Borden on  
traps and Brandy on congas. This is  
followed by a short piece about the  
Welsh witch, Rhiannon, who, according  
to legend, turned into a bird. Whistles  
and “bird sounds” are heard, as well  
as an eerie cello solo.  

“Part of Me/Changes,” written by  
lead singer Rhiannon, is about a re-  
lationship coming to an end and it ex-  
presses well the contrast of feelings  
which is common in that situation.  
This song jumps back and forth be-  
tween a rich, longing mood and a  
frantic sense of wanting to get away.  
Rhiannon’s wide range of vocal skills  
are shown off at their best here. Bor-  
den’s precise drumming holds the  
group together through the continen-  
tal tempo changes.  

The last song on this side, “Spirit  
Healer,” was written by percussionist  
Carolyn Brandy in a sort of jazz-waltz  
style. As the lyrics refer to the pain  
and suffering all around us, the music  
supports them with a “bluesy” yearn-  
ing sound and a pulsing bass line. The  
solos by bassist Vincenza and pianist  
Janet Small carry this yearning feel-  
ing as much as the vocal line  
“Woman, don’t you know you gotta  
change it? Don’t you know you're the  
Spirit Healer?”  

Side two starts with another piece  
by Rhiannon called “City Life.” High  
energy, progressive jazz, it is full of  
Rhiannon’s scat singing and a caco-  
phony of miscellaneous percussion.  
This song reflects the frantic pace of  
city living. The temple gongs which  
introduce “Dark Side of the Moon”  
set the mood for this ethereal num-  
ber. All sorts of exotic instrumental  
sounds accompany the haunting vo-  
cals. “Dark Side” was written by Car-  
olyn Brandy and James Gardner.  

“Yemaya, Sister of the Fishes,” the  
final and longest cut on the album,  
begins with a chant sung by all the  
band members plush in harmony. The  
piece then breaks into a steady Latin-  
sounding beat, over which is heard  
Small’s rippling, trilling piano and  
Rhiannon’s light, lilting vocals. “Ye-  
maya” ends with a lengthy rhythmic  
improvisation by all the players on  
miscellaneous percussion. Brandy’s  
piece, about the African goddess of  
the sea, honors the influence of Afri-  
can musical heritage on the develop-  
ment of jazz, as does much of Alive’s  
music.  

This is the group’s first album and,  
although it lacks some of the pizzazz  
of their on-stage performances, it is  
an impressive album and one to be  
listened to closely again and again.  

Let’s hope that Alive! will be alive  
and well for a long time to come.  

SUSPENSE  
ILLER  

WOMEN-HATING FILM  
ELICITS STRONG PROTEST  
BY Elizabeth Pagedale  

A woman has fallen so deeply in  
love that she hires a man to attack  
and terrorize the woman she loves.  
She then proceeds to kill two men  
and a cat, while harassing and spying  
on her beloved. A familiar scenario?  
Hardly. Vicious homophobia and hid-  
eous misogyny? Regrettably, yes. The  
movie “Windows” has it all. Approxi-  
mately 50 people picketed the Mc-  
Clurg Court Theater the evening of  
January 26 to protest the cinematic  
exploitation of violence against wom-  
en and the offensively pernicious  
stereotyping of lesbianism in “Windows.” A second similar protest was  
held Feb. 7 at the State Lake Theater.  

Organized by The Committee to  
Stop the Movie “Windows,” the pro-  
test called for more honest portrayals  
of women in films. The image of a  
sadistic woman victimizing other  
women is a distortion of reality belied  
by FBI statistics: Every three minutes  
a woman is raped and every 18 se-  
conds a woman is beaten—by men.  
“Windows” was made by United  
Artists, the same company that is pro-  
ducing “Cruising,” a film portraying  
gay men as psychotic killers. Con-  
cerned groups throughout the coun-  
try are urging a nationwide boycott of  
both films. All persons interested in  
the responsible treatment of issues af-  
fecting women and the elimination of  
bigoted stereotyping are encouraged  
to participate in the upcoming pro-  
tests of “Windows” and “Cruising.”

Valentines Day  
by Judith Berns  

I know this is Valentines Day  
but did you know  

we could put  

Standard  

out of business?  

You’ve got enough energy  

on the tip  

of your tongue  
to push the earth  
off its axis  

In fact,  

though I’m scared shitless of height  
and I’ve never been a heroine—  

I’d hop down a fire escape  
backwards and blindfolded  

just to do that again.  

NUCLEAR PANIC TRAFFIC JAM  
by Alison White  

Where are the zones  

of acceptable fatality  

for the state of Illinois today?  

Mine stand all around me  

death grounds creeping every direction  

on side the lake.  

So avoid the wind blowing south  
Chicago,  

hurry 100 miles directly west  

for more than just a day or two.  
Maybe someone  

will let six million people  

spend the night  

forever.  

Expressways terminally constipated  
in a radioactive desertion,  

shout of a midwest electracide.  
While Zion calmly belches  

another invisible cloud of disease  
into a mortician's sky.  

Welcoming the night in a mistake of cancer  

that men insist to ride  
off the planet’s future.

KANSAS CITY WOMEN’S  
JAZZ FESTIVAL  

The Women’s Jazz Festival was  
founded in April, 1977, by Carol Com-  
er, jazz performer, composer, and cor-  
respondent, and Dianne Gregg, jazz  
radio programmer, producer, and jour-  
nalist. The organization incorporated  
in May, 1977, in Kansas City, Missouri,  
a city so rich in jazz tradition that it is  
considered “the cradle of jazz.” The  
Women’s Jazz Festival, Incorporated,  
encompasses more than just a per-  
forming event; with the publication of  
the only National Directory of Female  
Jazz Performers in the world, W.J.F.I.  
has grown to become a clearinghouse  
for anyone interested in jazzwomen  
and their aspirations, accomplish-  
ments, and availability. As a result of  
W.J.F.I.’s success, similar programs  
have been or are being initiated in  
New York City, Detroit, Chicago, Los  
Angeles, San Francisco, Washington,  
D.C., and Rome, Italy. As Leonard  
Feather, internationally syndicated  
jazz critic and historian, recently  
stated, our co-founders (Gregg and  
Comer) “will someday be known as  
the grandmothers of the women’s  
jazz movement.”

Women’s Jazz Festival call (816)

MOMENTS  

I am  

only living moments,  
strung together  

frame by frame  
unrehearsed, without plot.  

An epic to be cast.
