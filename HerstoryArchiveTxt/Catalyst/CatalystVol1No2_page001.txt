On February 15, the birthday of  
Susan B. Anthony, Mrs. Thompson  
will issue a proclamation from the  
Governor declaring the week of  
March 2-8, 1980, as Illinois Women’s  
History Week. The purposes of the  
week are: to heighten public aware-  
ness of women’s role throughout the  
structure of society, not just famous  
women, to encourage institutions to  
focus on women, to encourage  
women’s organizations to recognize  
that they are making history and to  
provide these groups with the ra-  
tionale and the tools for preserving  
their organizational records. Towards  
these ends, the 73 member organiza-  
tions of the Illinois Women’s Agenda

FEBRUARY 1980  

ILLINOIS WOMEN’S HISTORY WEEK  

TO BE CELEBRATED MARCH 2-8  

are sponsoring and coordinating the  

first statewide Women’s History  
Week.  
The idea for Women’s History  

Week was developed by the Sonoma  
County (California) Commission on  
the Status of Women. The proposal  
was discussed and approved at the  
Summer Institute on Women’s History  
held at Sarah Lawrence College in  
New York during July 1979. This in-  
stitute brought together 43 women  
representing 37 national women’s  
organizations for the 17-day intensive  
seminar led by Gerda Lerner, head of  
the M.A. program at Lawrence and  
president of the Organization of  
American Historians, and Barbara  
Omolade from the Women’s Action  
Alliance. The seminar was designed  
to help women integrate women’s  
history into their own consciousness  
and their group’s programs.  

The dates for the Women’s History  
Week were chosen to incorporate In-  
ternational Women’s Day on March 8.  
The Illinois Women’s Agenda, which  
is the largest multi-issue coalition of  
women’s organizations in the coun-  
try, will be encouraging various  
groups to offer some programs honor-  
ing women during that week. They  
will also act as a clearing house for in-  
formation on what programs will be  
available where and when. To obtain  
such information, call (312) 922-8530.  

MORMONISM VS. E.R.A.  

by Marcia Donaldson  

Sonia Johnson is a fifth-generation  
Mormon and co-founder and head of  
Mormons for ERA. On Dec. 5 Mrs.  
Johnson was convicted by a three-  
man jury of “apostasy.” In other  
words, because of her belief in the  
equal rights for women, in the eyes of  
her church she has abandoned her  
faith.  

The charges against Mrs. Johnson  
are: (1) knowingly preaching false  
doctrine; (2) causing outsiders to have  
a bad opinion of the Church; (3)  
undermining the structure, hierarchy,  
and authority of the Mormon Church.  
Her trial began at 8:30 p.m. and ended  
at 10:05 p.m. Mrs. Johnson was found  
guilty and now faces eternal separa-  
tion from her family.  

The problem began in 1976 when  
Spencer W. Kimball, the highest rank-  
ing Mormon official who is con-  
sidered a prophet by his followers, an-  
nounced his formal opposition to  
equal rights for women under the  
Constitution. Mormons for ERA has  
maintained that equal rights is a  
political issue, not an issue of faith  
and has become very concerned  
recently by the Mormon Church’s in-  
creasing involvement in lobbying  
against the Equal Rights Amendment.  

There are many questions the trial  
raises for all women.  

It was estimated by the Associated  
Press that the Mormon Church brings  
in over $3 million a day, which places  
it well within the top 50 corporations  
in America. How can we who are for  

Spencer W. Kimball (1895), president  
of the church from 1973 to the present.  
equal rights under the Constitution  
better prepare ourselves against the  
magnitude of power in the opposi-  

tion?  

The Mormon people have long  
believed themselves to be a separate  
people within the American people.  
Do our laws regarding separation of  
church and state not apply to the  
Mormon Church?  

The Mormon Church demands com-  
plete loyalty from all members.  
Bishop Jeffrey Willis, Sonia Johnson’s  
accuser and the judge at her trial, is a  
personnel officer for the Central In-  
telligence Agency. As a government  
agency, the CIA must be an equal op-  
portunity employer. Can Mr. Willis  

Many groups are planning events  
which have only been tentatively  
scheduled as we go to press. Some of  
these organizations include The Na-  
tional Council of Negro Women, Mu-  
jeres Latinas, Jane Addams Book-  
store, the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A.,  
Barat College, Northeastern Universi-  
ty, and many others. Jane Addams  
Hull House will give tours and pre-  
sent slide shows and will be open to  
the public, at no admission cost, from  
10 to 4 weekdays and 1 to 5 on Sun-  
day, March 2. Northwestern Univer-  
sity will be having Margaret Atwood  
as a guest; for details call the NW Pro-  
gram on Women.

offering the following programs at  
the branch libraries:

Proposed 27th Amendment to the  
United States Constitution  

THE EQUAL RIGHTS  

AMENDMENT  
“Section 1. Equality of rights under  
the law shall not be denied or  

abridged by the United States or by  
any State on account of sex.  
“Section 2. The Congress shall  
have the power to enforce, by ap-  
propriate legislation, the provisions of  
this article.”  

“Section 3. This amendment shall  
take effect two years after the date of  
ratification.”  

hire women for employment equally?  

U.S. District Judge Marion Callister  
of Idaho is currently hearing an im-  
portant ERA case regarding the issues  
of rescission and the legality of the  
Congressional extension of the rati-  
fication deadline. Judge Callister is  
also a regional representative of the  
Mormon Church; the equivalent of an  
Archbishop in the Catholic Church.  
Can a man who ranks near the top 100  
officials in the world of a church that  
officially opposes equal rights for  
women under the Constitution be im-  
partial?  

These questions and many others  
must be answered. The all-male hier-  
archy of the Mormon Church has di-  
rect influence over the ultimate out-  
come of ERA in America. The answers  
to these questions could influence  
how much power they are going to be

allowed to utilize against us. Sonia  
Johnson has succeeded in bringing  
ERA back into the news. She has also  
reminded us of the power and fears of  
the opposition to equal rights under  
the Constitution.  

I hope the spirit of Sonia Johnson  
will encourage all of us to speak out  
for ERA. All that Mrs. Johnson has  
had taken from her because of her  
strong belief in the equal rights of  
women and the profound personal  
loss she has suffered should not be  
lost on anyone. It is time now to speak  
out regardless of whether it is polite  
or politic. We all have a great deal to  
lose.
