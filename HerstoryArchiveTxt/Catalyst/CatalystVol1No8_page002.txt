Court Denies Abortion
Funds To Poor — Pro-
Choice Forces Vow To Win
It Back At Polls

On June 30th the Supreme Court voted
5-4 to cut off Medicaid funding for abor-
tions. The decision is an outrageous retreat
from the 1973 Court’s clear refusal to
favor fetal life over the health of a living
woman, according to Karen Mulhauser,
executive director of National Abortion
Rights Action League.

“In 1973, the Court said that the state
interest in protecting fetal life does not
justify jeopardizing the life or health of a
pregnant woman. This new decision is a
shocking reversal of the Supreme Court's
previous concern,” Mulhauser said.

If the message of the courts was not
clear before, it is spelled out in capital
letters now, explained Mulhauser.

“Every pro-choice voter can read the
message — we cannot depend upon the
courts for what must be provided, assured
and fought for by our legislators.

“The Court has ruled that government
is not compelled to provide access to abor-
tion by providing funding; however, legis-
lators can provide those funds for ade-
quate health care.”

NARAL's IMPACT ‘80 program, the
national strategy that state by state is
teaching pro-choice individuals how to be-
come politically active, will redouble its
efforts, Mulhauser said. There is vast sup-

port for legislators who support funding
access for safe, legal abortion.

“A right without access is no right at
all,” Mulhauser stressed.

When the Court ruled that the Hyde
Amendment is not unconstitutional, and
that governments (federal or state) are not
compelled by the Constitution to provide
the Medicaid funds that make the right of
abortion a reality for poor women, it
argued that government has a legitimate
right to encourage childbirth, Mulhauser
pointed out.

“In a matter as private and personal as
that of abortion, or childbirth, it is pro-
foundly dangerous for government to pro-
mote the choice of one alternative over
another.

“Will the government, which according
to the Court now has a legitimate interest
in encouraging childbirth, tomorrow de-
cide that it has a legitimate interest in dis-
couraging childbirth and interfering with
other private decisions?”

The answer to this setback will be at
the ballot box, where pro-choice voters
have made it clear in this Spring’s pri-
maries that pro-choice legislators and chal-
lengers have majority support, said
Mulhauser.

“The pro-choice majority will continue
its sweep into the grassroots political
arena, where it can support pro-choice
legislators who will vote not only for
equal access for poor women, but who
will oppose the continued, accelerated
attempts to make abortion illegal for all
women for all time.”

WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE
ON FAMILIES — MINNEAPOLIS

Six hundred and fifty delegates from
16 midwest and southern states attended
the second in the series of three White
House Conferences on Families in
Minneapolis June 19-21.

Despite constant attempts by the con-
servative elements to undermine the work
of the conference by dilatory parliamen-
tary tactics, abusive use of the rules, stri-
dent interruptions of the proceedings and
a brief walkout during the final voting
session, the moderate wing managed to
pass some significant resolutions and —
probably more importantly — defeat
some backward ones.

The first of the series of three White
House Conferences on Families was held
early in June in Baltimore, and was also
disrupted with a walkout by conservative
elements. The last of the series was held
in early July in Los Angeles. A committee
of delegates selected from each state and
by President Carter will meld the resolu-
tions from each of the conferences into
a final report for the President this fall.

The Illinois Women’s Agenda, a coali-
tion of about 40 women’s groups from
throughout Illinois, took the lead early
this year in working to provide balance in
the selection of the Illinois delegation and
in pushing for certain issues — ERA, pro-
choice, aid for the handicapped, child
care, additional help for victims of domes-
tic violence and rape, rights for all. Mem-
bers of the Illinois delegation who were
also Agenda members planned strategy,
contacted other delegates from other
states ahead of time to find those of like
mind, and held strategy sessions early in
the Minneapolis three-day conference.
Such strategy paid off in their ability to
defeat most of the very conservative
proposals.

Among the resolutions winning support
at the conference were those:

— opposing the marriage tax

— urging employers to give special con-
sideration to needs of employees
with family responsibilities (i.e.,
part-time work, flextime, etc.)

— tax credit for those staying home to
care for children or elderly in the
home

— for preventive approaches to drug
and alcohol abuse

— improving the plight of the rural
elderly

— for ensuring that housing in rural
areas, for migrant workers, in
barrios, ghettos, Indian reservations
and other low-income areas be up-
graded to a minimum national
accepted standard

— supporting the Equal Rights Amend-
ment

— assistance to families with disabled
members

— promotion of action for indepen-
dent living for handicapped adults

— demanding federal laws and regula-
tions be analyzed in terms of their
impact on families

— TV rating system which shall include
information on violence, crime and
sexuality with the assistance of a
citizen’s committee.

Among those resolutions defeated at
the conference were those:

— opposing the ERA

— supporting a human life amendment
to the U.S. Constitution

— supporting the Family Protection Act
(Laxalt)

— requiring parental permission for
youth's access to certain medical
help

— requiring parental control of text-
books.

The major area in which moderate dele-
gates felt that they had lost a fight was the
inclusion in one resolution which passed
of the family as “two or more persons
related by blood, heterosexual marriage,
adoption or extended families.” This defi-
nition of the family was used by the con-
servative wing in every workshop and
attached to nearly every resolution that
was being worked on, as an unrelated and
divisive tactic.

The Illinois delegation numbered 78,
the largest state delegation at Minneapolis.
One quarter to one third were “moderate;”
the remainder conservative. One third of
the delegation (26) were elected at a state-
wide conference held Friday, March 7, in
Chicago. Another third was named by the
Governor, and the final third was named
by the Executive Coordinating Committee
of the Illinois White House Conference.

Barbara Bowman of Chicago, a profes-
sor at Erikson Institute, and president of
the National Council on the Education of
Young Children, is the Illinois delegate
who was elected by the Illinois delegation
to be a member of the task force which
puts the resolutions together for the final
report.

Co-chairs of the Executive Coordinating
Committee were Ann Rohlen of Chicago, a
representative of the Junior League, and
Rodney St. Clair of Alton, President of the
Illinois Association of Family Service
Agencies.
