HUSTLE STRUGGLES

WITH OFFENSE  
BY Carolyn Stanek

With more than a dozen games left  
in February and March, the Hustle  
will be attempting to return to their  
winning ways. Not used to being los-  
ers—they were division co-champs  
last season—the Hustle has been  
plagued by injuries, foul trouble and  
shaky offense.

Last season’s MVP and Hustle play-  
maker Rita Easterling was out of ac-  
tion for several games in December  
and continues to play with a band-  
aged knee. Her assessment of the  
team’s difficulties was, “We have no  
set thing going for us yet on offense.  
It’s taking awhile to get things going,  
mostly because we have so many dif-  
ferent players this year and we have  
to work them in.”

With Easterling back as a starter,  
the Hustle’s problem, according to  
center Sue Digitale, is “not so much  
new players, although that had defin-  
itely been a factor. I think when we  
make 35 turnovers or so in a game  
that it’s just the fundamentals that  
are missing. We're not getting the  
jump balls, the loose play that we  
should be getting.”

Coach Doug Bruno also agreed that  
“the offense has been our trouble  
spot.” Although Easterling (when not  
injured), Sue Digitale and Liz Gallo-  
way have been the most consistent  
starters, Bruno has been juggling with  
the other starting positions.

Debby Waddy-Rossow, the Hustle’s  
leading scorer last season (24.5), has  
seen less action this season but still has  
shown superb accuracy in shooting  
from outside the key. Adding to the  
great depth on Bruno’s bench are re-  
serves Breena Caldwell (5-11), Jody  
Rajcula (6-1), and Retha Swindell (6-2),  
who have given the Hustle an occa-  
sional height advantage. Recent start-  
er Denise Sharps, acquired in Decem-  
ber, also contributes to the Hustle’s  
attack.

Yet with all the rotation of players,  
setbacks and injuries, the Hustle re-  
mains a spirited team. They still have  
the chance to finish the season well  
above .500. They also are attracting  
more than 2,000 fans per game, per-  
haps the best attendance figures in  
the WBL.

AVON TENNIS TOURNAMENT  
BY Carolyn Stanek

Poised and steady, Martina Navra-  
tilova did what everyone knew she  
could do: she beat Chris Evert in  
Chicago’s Avon Tournament and  
made it clear that she has, for the past  
year, replaced Evert as the No. 1 sin-  
gles player in the world.

Although Navratilova took the  
championship in two sets, 6-4, 6-4, she  
didn’t have the easiest time doing it.  
She fell behind 4-2 in the first set be-  
fore she was able to regain her con-  
centration and overpower Evert. She  
then walked off the court, $40,000  
richer and with another prize—a red  
mink reversible warm-up jacket. And  
that was just for being the singles  
champion.

Navratilova, a Czech who now lives  
in Dallas, Texas, then combined with  
Billie Jean King to dispose of Sylvia  
Hanika and Kathy Jordan, 6-3, 6-4, for  
the doubles championship.

Other highlights of the five-day  
tournament, which attracted record  
crowds totaling close to 75,000 in the  
Amphitheater, included Sylvia Han-  
ika’s upset of Evonne Goolagong in  
the second round of play and the de-  
but of Andrea Jaeger, a 14-year-old  
from the northwest suburbs. Florida’s  
16-year-old Bettina Bunge and In-  
diana’s 18-year-old Mary Lou Piatek  
also played in opening rounds.

Following its Chicago tour in Jan-  
uary, the Avon Tournament moved on  
to Seattle and Los Angeles earlier this  
month and continues in Oakland this  
week. The final championships will be  
played March 19-23 in Madison Square  
Garden.

RUGBY

Rugby can change your life. If  
you're ready to get involved with a  
sport that will keep you in shape and  
make you feel like you're strong and  
can mow down anyone and anything  
in your way, consider rugby. Local  
ruggers participate in a Midwest con-  
ference of more than 30 teams from  
Ohio to Detroit to Minneapolis. The  
game resembles soccer and football.

Rugby demands a commitment of  
two practices per week from 6:30 to  
8:30 p.m. A round of beers often fol-  
lows. Home games are on Saturday  
afternoon on park district turfs (call-  
ed “pitches” in rugby). Several rounds  
of beer and a party always follow  
games.

On-the-road games can be as close  
as Milwaukee or the U. of I., down-  
state or as far as St. Louis or Ohio. But  
the trips involve partying whenever  
possible, getting to know your team-  
mates and meeting new people from  
other teams. In rugby if you lose the  
game, you can always win the party,  
as the saying goes.

The spring season begins in late  
March and lasts until June. Then the  
second season is from September to  
November.

Interested? Two clubs are looking  
for new members, and a third may be  
forming at Northwestern University.  
For information, call Carol at 528-6291  
or Carolyn at 248-3747 (Lakeshore Ale-  
wives Women’s Rugby Club) or Mary  
at 528-7259 or Jello at 864-3992. Part-  
ies to welcome new members are  
scheduled for later this month.
