NOW National Constitution  
Commission Begins Work  

The National Constitution Commission which is charged  
by the 1975 National Conference to develop a range of  
proposed bylaws alternatives, will begin its work with the  
first meeting held at the Howard Johnson's, Lenexa, Kan-  
sas, (Kansas City area) Feb. 21-22.  

The commission is composed of one delegate and one  
alternate selected or elected by the NOW organization  
from each state and D.C. According to the conference  
resolution, the names, addresses, phone numbers of all  
the commissioners must be made available to all NOW  
members. This list of delegates and alternatives is not  
complete because some states have not finished their  
selection process; some have not yet reported; and in still  
others there is no state apparatus to implement the selec-  
tion process.  

According to the conference resolution, ‘Groups of no  
less than four commissioners will hold open hearings in  
several different locations, geographically balanced within  
their respective regions. The purpose of these hearings  
will be to solicit and accept oral and written opinions and  

ideas from members and chapters about bylaws revision.”  

A schedule of hearings with dates, times, and locations  
will be included in the next issue of DO IT NOW.  

The work of this commission is vital. The commission,  
in its development of a range of bylaws alternatives, after  
completing the hearing process will facilitate decision-  
making at the October 9-11, 1976 National Conference  
for the purpose of dealing with Bylaws to be held in Over-  
land Park, Kansas.  

This 1976 National Conference will formulate a set of  
bylaws to be submitted to the entire membership for rati-  
fication.  

NOW has, in many ways, outgrown its present bylaws  
which were adopted when the organization had few mem-  
bers, few chapters, and no state organizations. NOW  
members from various philosophies agree we must revise  
our bylaws to reflect present and future needs. The com-  
mission seeks your input and/or your chapter input. Please  
contact your commissioners.
