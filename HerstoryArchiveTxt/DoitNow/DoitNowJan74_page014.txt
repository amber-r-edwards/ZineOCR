FLEXIBLE HOURS EMPLOYMENT ACT

The Flexible Hours Employment Act (S 2022), a bill which would require that within 5 years of
enactment, 10% of the positions at each and all levels in all Executive Agencies of the Federal
Government be made available on a flexible hours basis has been introduced in the Senate by
John Tunney (D-CA). Bella Abzug (D-NY) has introduced a similar bill in the House (HR 9699).

Flexible hours is defined as part-time employment such as four hours per work day or one to four
days per week, etc. A flexible hours job is intended to be a permanent, responsible position with
standard civil service protections and prorated fringe benefits. Another section of the bill requires
the Secretary of Labor to promote expansion of flexible hours employment practices by all public
and private employers.

We feel the bill could especially benefit parents by making it possible for both to contribute to
the rearing of their children and to the income of the family.

POWELL HEARINGS — EEOC

On Wednesday, December 12th, NOW testified at the hearings on confirming John Powell as
Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Testifying for NOW, Ann Scott
used the opportunity to question the criteria on which an EEOC Chairman is chosen. In light
of the Steelworkers’ case, she asked whether the EEOC would continue to take a hard stance
on back pay. She also questioned what Powell’s stance would be as EEOC Chairman on equal
pension benefits.

RAPE BILL

The Rape Bill, which we first reported on in November, has since been introduced in the House
by Congressman John Heinz (D-PA) where it has 37 House co-sponsors. The Legislative Office
has sent a letter to members of the House asking for support and co-sponsorship of the bill
(HR 11520). We urge you to do likewise with your own Representative.

The bill has 17 Senate co-sponsors, 6 of whom are on the Labor and Public Welfare Committee
which must act on the bill before it goes to the floor. The following members of the Com-

mittee had not co-sponsored at the time of this writing (December 6th): Dominick (R-CO),
Eagleton (D-MO), Hathaway (D-ME), Javits (R-NY), Nelson (D-WI), Pell (D-RI), Schweiker (R-PA),
Stafford (R-VT), Taft (R-OH), Williams (D-NJ).

IF ONE OF THESE SENATORS IS FROM YOUR STATE, WRITE, URGING CO-SPONSORSHIP.
