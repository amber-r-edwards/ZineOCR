NOW LEGISLATIVE OFFICE SEEKS INTERNS FOR 1973—74 ACADEMIC YEAR  

Internships are non-paid educational positions for which students receive academic credit through  
their university intern program. The student works on a specific area of the L. O. program and  
becomes the authority in that area. Preference will be given to students who are already active  
NOW members. Graduate or senior status is desirable but NOW membership and activity are more  
important. Interest in the legislative process is a must.  

If you are interested, send resume, including feminist activities, to the NOW Legislative Office  
Manager, Mary Vogel, 1107 National Press Building, Washington, D. C. 20004. Check with your  
academic advisor for information about your school’s intern program.
