1976 BUDGET

This is NOW’s first $1,000,000 budget and the first na-
tional NOW budget to use program budgeting. In a pro-
gram budget, line items* are established to reflect specific
activities such as the ERA and Do It NOW. Money is then
allocated for that specific purpose. As a subset of each
program (line item), functional expenses can be itemized
according to the categories defined. Not only does this
form of budget specify precisely where funds have been
allocated and for what purpose, it provides for totaling
within all programs of legitimate categories of expenses,
such as telephone, supplies, travel, child care, staff, print-
ing, postage, meals, lodging and facilities.

The format allows for defining each expenditure by
specific programs. Rather than having, for instance, all of-
ficers’ expenses listed only once by office, these expenses
are divided within the various programs that each officer is
involved in. It also provides for priority actions to be
reflected in a multitude of different groupings — ERA
could appear not only within its line item but can appear
under Task Forces, officers, communications, etc.

For the first time, ERA funds will be included as part of
the general fund budget so all NOW funds can be seen in
one perspective and only one document will be required to
present the total financial situation of the organization.
ERA funds will be restricted (earmarked) in the amounts
shown — direct expenses of $150,000. In addition, other
line items in the budget also have funds for ERA allocated,
(VA and MA ERA) since the national conference resolu-
tion directed ERA funds to the targeted unratified states.
All other funds can and will come out of the general fund.
No administrative overhead will be taken from ERA funds;
all funds collected for the ERA will go to the target
unratified states.

Administrative costs are shown as a separate expense
category and include all membership processing costs as a
distinct line item. Most of the “natural functions” of run-
ning the organization will be charged to the administrative
category. This includes rent, telephone, supplies, etc. The
expenses of officers which are directly concerned with ad-
ministration — the chair’s role in chartering chapters, the

secretary's role in keeping the membership records,
regional director's roles in convening chapters — appear in
that category. Other activities of elected officials will ap-
pear in the appropriate program or communication
category. The budget assumes that a portion of any of-
fice/officer’s time and expenditures are related to the ad-
ministration and that the necessary functions of record
keeping and communication with members relating to
dues (see 5.2) more properly belong in such a category.
The 1975 budget showed both of these as part of member-
ship development, and limited administrative expenses to
those performed by officers (except regional directors) and
Board members; no salaries or office costs appeared under
administrative costs in the prior budget.

Budgets are projections — they show anticipated reve-
nue. But they also reflect commitments by allocating
funds to those programs. Some of the innovative pro-
grams adopted are:

1) direct rebates to local units of NOW as shown by item
1.1

2) funding for a meeting of all state coordinators (1.8.1)

3) funding for a meeting of state coordinators, ERA
coordinators, from unratified states (1.8.1)

4) more direct funds to income and membership produc-
ing categories so as not to rely primarily on direct mail

The task force budgets were doubled from 1975 figures.
Task forces can also qualify for funds for mobilizations, ac-
tion litigation and a portion of the action center, project
directors, communications, and other support facilities.
For instance, at the January board meeting at Phoenix a
Right To Choose mobilization proposed by the task force
on reproduction and population was allocated funds. Note
that a budget for Do It NOW is for a monthly publication.

The implementation of this new budget has begun with
the new fiscal year. Experience with the new budget has
shown that it is possible to provide up to date accounting
of all NOW funds. Future communications will contain
financial information. Make the picture look good — renew
NOW!!
