FEMINIST PROGRAMMING SOUGHT  

Television and radio stations frequently ask NOW chapters for sources of feminist programming  
they can broadcast, says NOW FCC Task Force Coordinator Whitney Adams. “Therefore, we  
would like to compile a list for chapters for reference in such instances,” says Ms. Adams. “Please  
let us know of any feminist program or series which could be made available to stations.” Send  

a brief description of the program, name and address of the producer or owner of program rights,  
and the terms under which it can be made available to other stations to the NOW Public Informa-  
tion Office, 641 Lexington Avenue, New York, N. Y. 10022.
