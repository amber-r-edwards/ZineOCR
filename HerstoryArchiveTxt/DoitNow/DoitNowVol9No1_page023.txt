===Wherever You Are===  
You Can Fight For The ERA  

Wherever you are, you can also fight for the ERA as an in-  
dividual, as a chapter of NOW, as another organization for  
the ERA by selling the historic ERA Bicentennial Medallion  
designed for NOW to use to raise ratification campaign funds.  

The Medallion dramatizes the unfinished revolution of all  
American women who have waited 200 years for the same  
rights the Colonial Fathers wrote into the Constitution for  
white males.
