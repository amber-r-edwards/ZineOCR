ABORTION  
OPPOSITION ACTIVITIES  

The December 14, 1973 issue of “The Greene Sheet,” the National Right To Life Committee, Inc.  
newsletter, claims that three more Senators have announced their support for a “mandatory human  
life amendment.”  

The three Senators are: William Proxmire (D-Wis), Walter D. Huddleston (D-Ky), and  
Roman Hruska (R-Neb).  

TURNING THEM AROUND  

None of the three have publicized their support for a “mandatory human life amendment,” but we  
do believe “The Greene Sheet's” claim that these Senators have promised some sort of support  

in response to constituent lobbying is a fact. However, none of the three are a lost cause for us  
and, in fact, prospects for turning them around are good if we put all of our efforts into it.  

Senator Huddleston has been supportive towards women’s rights in the past as a member of the  
Kentucky State Senate. Our feeling is that he is succumbing to the very intense pressure that  

the compulsory pregnancy people have put on him, such as the December 10th home office visit  

of a delegation of citizens and local officials. Senator Proxmire is known as a “liberal” in Congress.  
If we can flood their offices with mail, telegrams, and phone calls, we may be able to persuade  
them to support the Supreme Court decision. Likewise with Senator Hruska.  

ACTION  

IT IS URGENT THAT EVERY NOW MEMBER WRITE TO ALL THREE SENATORS IMMEDIATELY  
(GET A FRIEND TO WRITE TOO)! Don’t depend on a chapter letter to relieve you of the personal  
responsibility for writing, and don’t fail to write because you're not a constituent. We have the  

capacity to deliver over 50,000 strong if we each act. Sit down and write or telegraph today! AND  
SEND CARBONS OR OTHER COPIES TO YOUR OWN SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES  
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT. See September Blue Sheet for suggestions on arguments to use.  

LONG-RANGE ACTION  

The National Reproduction Task Force Coordinator, Jan Liebman, and the Legislative Office are  
developing an abortion kit which will be mailed to your chapter's Legislative Task Force Coordinator  
and Reproduction Task Force Coordinator in a series of updated installments.  

1. Make sure (a) your chapter has coordinators for these two task forces and (b) that their names  
are on the national task force mailing list (if not, have chapter president send postcard to National  
and to Legislative Offices).  

2. Make sure that your coordinators keep you informed with the most timely info possible. The  
best way is to join your local Legislative and/or Reproduction Task Force and work with your  
coordinators on a local level. Help set up an abortion telephone tree to alert members as fast as  
possible.  

3. Visit your Members of Congress whenever possible and be persistent. We cannot be shy and we  
cannot allow ourselves to be put off with evasive answers. The opposition doesn’t.
