NOW RAPE TASK FORCE COORDINATOR MARY ANN LARGEN REVEALS FACTS ON RAPE

“A Report on Rape in the Suburbs,” recently produced by Mary Ann Largen and members of the  
Northern Virginia NOW Chapter, counters the myth that rape occurs mainly in urban high-crime  
areas. According to the FBI Uniform Crime Report, forcible and attempted rape was up 18% in  
suburban areas as compared to a 9% increase in large cities in 1972. Northern Virginia, the area  
studied for the report, is typical of such suburban areas and is geographically located in the South,  
which is second only to the Western States in rate of rape per population. For further information  
on this new report, contact Mary Ann Largen, National Coordinator, Rape Task Force, 5203  
Eighth Road South, Apt. 523B, Arlington, Va. 22204.

NOW WAS FIRST TO URGE APPOINTMENT OF A WOMAN VICE PRESIDENT

While the news of Spiro Agnew’s resignation was still causing shock waves throughout the country,  
NOW’s message to the President was already on the news wires, closely followed by letters from  
Wilma Scott Heide to all members of Congress, Congresswomen and Women in the Federal Govern-  
ment, and a telegram to President Nixon. NOW’s statement, drafted by National Board member  
and Politics Task Force Chairperson Karen DeCrow, read:

“At this unprecedented time in U.S. history, it is time for another unprecedented event. The  
National Organization for Women strongly urges President Nixon to appoint and the Congress to  
confirm a woman vice president.” President Heide’s telegram to President Nixon:

“NOW IS THE TIME TO APPOINT A WOMAN VICE PRESIDENT.”

(The full text of NOW’s letters, the telegram and the statement is, at press time, en route to all  
national board members, chapter presidents, state coordinators, task force coordinators and the  
NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund Board, as well as to the media.)
