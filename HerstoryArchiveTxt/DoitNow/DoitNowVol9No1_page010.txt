Lesbian Mother Loses Custody

In Dallas, Texas a lesbian lost custody of her  
9-year old son, December 23, 1975, when a jury of 10 men  
and 2 women ruled that the child should live with his father.  
Douglas Risher sought custody of his son, Richard, who had  
lived with his mother since the couple was divorced in 1971.  
Risher claimed that after the divorce his former wife began  
a homosexual life not conducive to the proper upbringing of  
their son. The jury voted 10 to 2 in favor of the father. Ten  
votes for one side are required for a verdict in a case of this  
kind under Texas law. The two dissenting votes were cast  
by men.

Beginning October, 1974 Mary Jo Risher was served  
with a citation by her ex-husband to appear in court answer-  
ing a petition in which she was openly charged with being  
a homosexual, living with another woman, Ann, in a homo-  
sexual relationship. In a temporary hearing, a Motion of  
Limine was introduced by Mary Jo’s lawyers barring the  
issue of homosexuality as a basis for immediate removal  
of the children from the home. The judge upheld this motion  
and the children, Richard age 9 and Jimmy age 17, were  
to remain with Mary Jo who had had custody of them since  
her separation and divorce in 1970. Then after a postpone-  
ment, the court date was set for September of 1975. At this  
hearing the judge ruled that any act, event, or situation  
dealing with the environment of the children or any life-  
style (i.e. homosexuality) that may affect the children can  
be brought before the jury.

Mary Jo Risher, age 38, is a nurse by profession. She  
received her B.B.A. in Business Administration from  
Abilene Christian College, Dallas, Texas (Jan-75). She is  
past chaplain of the Order of Eastern Star, past president of  
Dallas County Council of Parent-Teacher Assoc., and a new  

member of NOW. Ann Foreman, age 29, is an assistant audi-  
tor in a Dallas bank and has a minor daughter aged 10,  
who also lives in the home with the full support and know-  
ledge of Ann’s ex-husband and his present wife. Ann is  
working toward her college degree and is also a new mem-  
ber of NOW. They are both members of Daughters of Bilitis.  
Mary Jo, Ann and the children have counseled countless  
hours with expert witnesses made up of psychologists,  
psychiatrists, ministers, and educators who were willing to  
testify in their behalf. They have engaged two lawyers to  
defend their cause. Lawyers on both sides agree that the  
central and perhaps only major issue is sexual preference.  
Local lawyers believe the facts in this case provide one of  
the most important test cases on the rights of a gay woman  
to retain custody of her children. Many believe the case  
will reach the Supreme Court given adequate financial sup-  
port. Expenditures have already exceeded $6,000.00. Any  
monetary donations (or other of time, witnesses or accounts  
of past, present and pending custody cases involving homo-  
sexuals) will be greatly appreciated. Tax deductible donations  
can be made which will pay for only expenses of expert  
witnesses. These are to be sent to:
