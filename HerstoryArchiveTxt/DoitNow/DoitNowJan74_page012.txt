From: Wilma Scott Heide, NOW President:  

By vote of NOW Board, NOW is a member of the Women’s Coalition for the Third Century (WCTC)  
(women includes men) whose goals include empowerment of women. WCTC was developed as a  
feminist alternative to the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission (ARBC). We found the  
ARBC undemocratic, commercial, undemographic, and politicized. We will relate to the ARBC in  
order to impact it to move feminist orientation but develop projects for support via the WCTC.  
NOW has been asked to develop a brochure for WCTC that will focus on what's happening via  
feminism, celebrate women’s culture (real and potential). Examples of happenings and projects:  
national TV special in prime time; mobile community museums and/or road shows; women’s  
actions vis-à-vis art, literature, films, religion, child care, corporate actions, etc. etc. NOW members  
who want to develop brochure and/or work in continuing ways through WCTC should contact:  

Ms. Patricia Budd Kepler, President (also NOW member)  
Women’s Coalition for the Third Century
