NOW President Heide is “Woman of the Year” Nominee  
YOU CAN VOTE FOR WILMA  

NOW President Wilma Scott Heide is a nominee for achievement in Human Rights in the Ladies  
Home Journal “Women of the Year” program. Ladies Home Journal readers will be asked to  
vote for women in this and many other categories announced in the January 1974 issue of the  
Journal (on newsstands in late December). If you’d like to vote for Wilma Scott Heide, here  

are the requirements for voting: fill out the ballot which appears in the January Journal and  
return your ballot as indicated. Only ballots from the Journal itself will be accepted, with no  
photocopies to be validated as votes. Deadline for receipt of ballots is January 21. The awards  
in each category, as with last year’s program, will be presented on nationwide television in the  
spring of 1974. In addition to voting by Journal readers, the nominees will also be considered  
by a “jury panel” established by the Ladies Home Journal. NOW Public Relations Vice President  
Toni Carabillo is a member of the panel.  

YOU CAN HELP  

GULF OIL TO ACCEPT NOW MEMBER’S SHAREHOLDER RESOLUTIONS. Gulf Oil Corporation  
has notified Joan Cummings of Philadelphia NOW that her resolutions will be on the proxy statement  
and ballot for the forthcoming shareholders meeting in 1974. NOW members are urged to write to  

B. R. Dorsey, Chairman of the Board and James E. Lee, President, to encourage them to respond  
favorably to these resolutions at the Gulf Board meeting to be held in January 1974. Address:  

Gulf Building, Executive Office, Pittsburgh, Pa. 15230. (A copy of Ms. Cummings’ resolutions  
appears in the NOW publication “Strategies for Business Compliance and Government Enforcement”  
available from the NOW Membership Services Office at $2.00 for NOW members.)  

NOW’s Compliance Task Force Subcommittee on Compliance Agencies Coordinator Jeane Bendorf  
announces that the subcommittee still urgently needs information regarding the lack of seriousness  
of compliance agencies in processing charges of sex discrimination. (See DO IT NOW, August 1973  
for first report on this.) The Subcommittee is not in a position to offer individual advice or help.  

Its stance is to develop a national strategy to force agencies to pursue sex discrimination charges with  
diligence, determination and zeal, says Ms. Bendorf, and the national subcommittee will be working  
in that capacity. Write to Ms. Jeane Bendorf at 1316 N. Laurel Avenue, Los Angeles, Calif. 90046.  
Telephone: (213) 659-3267.
