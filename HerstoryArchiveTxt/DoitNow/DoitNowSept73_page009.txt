P A R — NOW ERA TWO YEAR STRATEGY

POLITICAL ACTION RESEARCH (P A R) is the first phase of NOW’s 2-Year ERA Strategy.

It is a lobbying tool for political analysis of all legislators in unratified states, carried out by
NOW members in the legislators’ districts. It comes in the form of a pamphlet to be filled out
with information that will make effective lobbying possible: who legislators’ campaign con-
tributors are, what organizations they belong to, issues they ran on, etc. Copies of the pamphlet
will be kept on file in the Chapter, the State Legislative Coordinator, and in the Legislative
Office. NOW will have the most complete files anywhere of those 20 states.

We plan to adapt this program for the other 30 states and for Congress as soon as humanly
possible.

Some news from the NOW ERA “investigating reporters”:

FLORIDA: “*....in my Chapter, members are actually fighting over who gets
a P A R to fill out! — “’.. .. the things we’re finding out!!”’

ALABAMA: Legislature has been under court order to reapportion — but action
has been pending since 1963! So guess we will go on with P A R
since things don’t seem to move very fast here — surprised to find out
that LWV has a number of uncovered counties — P A R is great — the
booklet seems complete in itself and will prove useful to all those
who participate in the study...
