ABORTION  
ANTI-ABORTION DEMONSTRATION  

Congressional offices are shoring up for an onslaught of 10,000 “right-to-lifers” coming to Washington  
for a January 22nd demonstration. On the anniversary of the Supreme Court abortion decision, they  
are planning a ring-around-the-Capitol to mourn aborted fetuses. They will flood the halls of Congress  
and deliver single red roses (to symbolize the fetus) to each Member of Congress.  

The “right-to-lifers” are building up momentum with their victories over the past year — victories  
attributable to a well-financed, high-pressure lobbying effort.  

ACTION  

It is urgent that we let Congress know that we feel just as strongly in favor of a woman’s right to  
choose as “r-t-l” does in opposition. VISIT YOUR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN THEIR HOME  
OFFICES WHILE THEY ARE HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS — ESPECIALLY DURING THE  
WEEK OF JANUARY 14-18.  

NO ABORTIONS FOR THE POOR  

On November 30th, Senator James Buckley (R-NY) introduced an amendment to the Social Security  
Amendments of 1973 which prohibited use of Medicaid funds for performance of abortions. The  
amendment was accepted by Senator Russell Long and passed in the Senate by voice vote. Since the  
House bill did not contain the language, the SSA’s will go to a conference committee for final  
version. The conference committee will be composed of members of the Senate Finance and House  
Ways and Means Committee. Latest word as of December 21st was that hearings on the Buckley  
Amendment will take place in February. See your Chapter Legislative Coordinator for more details.  

Little by little, the so-called “right-to-life” forces are hacking away at the hard-fought right to  
control our own bodies we won through the January 1973 Supreme Court decision. By prohibiting  
public funds (Medicaid and foreign aid) and legal aid services to be used for abortions and by allowing  
hospitals to decide whether or not to perform abortions, the opposition may succeed in eliminating  
medically safe, legal abortions to the poor both in this country and abroad.  

ACTION  

The situation is critical. We cannot afford another “r-t-l” victory. EACH AND EVERY NOW  
MEMBER SHOULD WRITE TO SENATOR RUSSELL LONG (D-La., Chairman, Senate Finance  
Committee) AND TO REPRESENTATIVES WILBUR MILLS (D-Ark., Chairman, House Ways  
and Means Committee) AND AL ULLMAN (D-Oreg., next in line for Mills’ job) TO PROTEST  
THE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST POOR WOMEN, THROUGH PROHIBITION OF FUNDS  
FOR ABORTION UNDER MEDICAID. SEND COPY TO YOUR OWN SENATORS AND  
CONGRESSPERSON.  

SOUR NOTE  

The Helms Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act was retained in conference.
