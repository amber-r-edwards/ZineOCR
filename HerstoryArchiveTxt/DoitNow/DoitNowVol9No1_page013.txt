NOTES  

1. Each category of expenses encompasses the following functions; it  
will always be shown as the fifth digit.  
.1 telephone  
.2 supplies  
.3 travel  
.4 child care  
.5 staff  
.6 printing  
.7 postage  
.8 meals and lodging  
.9 facilities  
2. Each category item encompasses a fourth digit for program.  
3. Each state coordinator has been allocated $400 for expenses. The  
method of distributing the balance will be determined at the April Board  
Meeting.  
4. This item is to be administered by the Vice President — Public Re-  
lations.  
5. Any return in excess of $150,000 in the ERA income-producing efforts  
shall be returned to the general fund for use in new fundraising efforts.  
All returns in general fundraising through direct mail may be immediately  
used for further effort in fundraising, i.e., the line item of the dollar  
amount is to be considered a revolving fund.  
6. This amount will be a direct function of the funds raised and will in-  
crease as advertising revenue increases.  
7. A program budget must accompany any requests for allocation in this  
category. Each of the other taskforces have been allotted $2,000 each for  
basic expenses ($46,000), leaving $33,000 for other taskforce programs.

usual) component of right-to-lifers who follow me every-  
where, the audience was all on the side of equality be-  
tween the sexes.  

As I travel around the country I am monitoring Title IX.  
According to the New York Times (12/28/75), the United  
States Office of Civil Rights has approved affirmative ac-  
tion plans for only 31 of the nation’s 1,300 eligible institu-  
tions since the Executive Order banning discrimination by  
federal contractors was first interpreted to cover higher -  
education.  

Moreover there has been virtually no monitoring of ap-  
proved plans to assure compliance. No college or universi-  
ty has lost its federal funding for failing to comply.  

And, more frightening yet, the discrimination exists  
toward children. In lunchrooms across the country, the  
girls are told to sit apart from the boys. They line up  
separately. They often use different entrances. In Ann Ar-  
bor, Michigan, I am told that the boys go out to recess  
while the girls stay inside and dust. An important bicenten-  
nial goal, perhaps the most important, is to end sexism  
toward children. Our concerns go way beyond the dusting  
— if girls and boys are separated from early childhood, we  
will think we are different, we will become rivals and  
enemies at 6, and torture each other at 36.  

Racial segregation in our schools is the blight on Amer-  
ican education. Sex segregation in our schools is the same  
kind of poison.  

A political note: not only are the presidential hopefuls  
busy courting NOW, not only are ERA and abortion prime  
campaign issues; not only are NOW chapters all over the  
unratified states preparing to defeat anti-ERA legislators at  
the polls; many of us are running ourselves.  

An attorney member of North Suburban (Illinois) NOW,  
Charlotte Adelman, is running for judge in the March 16  
primary. She, and a small group of independents, have  
taken on the Daley machine, and even had to go to court  
to get their petitions accepted.  

Our finance vice president, Martha Dickey, is running for  
state legislature from her district in Dallas. She is unop-  
posed in the Democratic primary.  

Hundreds of NOW members are running for office. Let  
us know in the national action center who you are.  

Contrary to what you may have read in the papers,  
feminism is not dying in America — NOW is not waning.  
We are alive and well, working and educating, and often,  
very joyous. — Karen DeCrow
