ABORTION  

ANTI-ABORTION AMENDMENT PASSES U. S. SENATE  

On October 2, 1973, Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) introduced an amendment (No. 566) to the  
Foreign Assistance Act of 1973 which prohibits the use of funds for abortion services, research  
on abortion, and for abortifacient drugs and devices (which include menstrual extraction and  
IUDs the way anti-abortion groups define it). This amendment passed the Senate unanimously.  
(NOTE: There are no women Senators).  

ANTI-ABORTION AMENDMENT IN CONFERENCE  

This amendment is currently under consideration by the Joint Conference Committee on the  
Foreign Assistance Act. Members of NOW in the relevant states have already been contacted  
and urged to write, call, and/or telegram their Senators and Representatives if they are members  
of the Conference Committee.  

So far, we are holding our own and the mail is running 50:50. However, to make sure the Conferees  
are not persuaded at the last minute to support any anti-abortion language in either the bill or the  
Conference Report Statement, which accompanies the bill to explain it, and is often used as an  
alternative method of expressing “the Will of Congress,” NOW MEMBERS IN THE CONFEREES'  
HOME STATES SHOULD WRITE AGAIN EXPRESSING THEIR OPPOSITION TO ANY MOVE  
BY THE CONFERENCE TO DENY ACCESS TO ABORTION TO OUR SISTERS OUTSIDE  
THE UNITED STATES. NOW members living in these states should write to the designated  
person immediately: Senators Humphrey (Minn), Aiken (Vt), Fulbright (Ark), Church (Id), and  
Case (NJ); Representatives Tom Morgan (Pa), Zablocki (Wisc), Hays (Oh), Fascell (Fla), Mailliard  
(Ca), Frelinghuysen (NJ), and Broomfield (Mich).  

Furthermore, we cannot be sure that the Foreign Assistance Act of 1973 will contain no anti-  
abortion language until both the Senate and the House of Representatives have voted on and  
approved a Conference Report with no provisions against abortion services, research, and abortifacient  
drugs or devices in it.  

THEREFORE, ALL MEMBERS OF NOW ARE ASKED TO WRITE LETTERS, SEND PETITIONS,  
MAKE PHONE CALLS, AND OTHERWISE LET YOUR SENATORS AND HOUSE MEMBERS  
KNOW THAT WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY OPPOSE THIS ATTEMPT BY ANTI-ABORTION FORCES  
TO DENY OTHER COUNTRIES THE RIGHT TO PROVIDE GOOD HEALTH CARE, INCLUDING  
EARLY ABORTIONS, TO THE WOMEN NOW LIVING AND POTENTIALLY DYING IN THOSE  
COUNTRIES IF THEY ARE DENIED OUR AID.  

FLASH! On November 13th, the Conference Committee voted to include anti-abortion language  
in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1973. This was after assurances from members of the committee,  
including Senator Humphrey, that no anti-abortion language would be included. WRITE AND  
DEMAND A REVERSAL OF THIS ACTION!
