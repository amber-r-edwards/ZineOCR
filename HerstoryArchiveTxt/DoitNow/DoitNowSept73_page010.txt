MINIMUM WAGE BILL

BACKGROUND: As you know, the Minimum Wage Bill is NOW’s top Federal priority legislation this year.  
*The Bill has been passed by both houses,  
*has gone through Joint Conference,  
*came out with everything in it we wanted,  
(especially coverage of domestic workers)  
*and is now ready to go to the President for signing.  

All during the House and Senate debate, however, there were intimations from Republican leaders that the bill would be vetoed by the President as inflationary. That, of course, is  

a terrible irony. As Senators pointed out during the debate, inflation has so increased prices that a worker would have to earn $2.16 an hour right now to buy what he or she was able to buy for the $1.60 an hour minimum Congress approved in 1966 and that has been unchanged since then. What’s more, the $2.20 an hour minimum doesn’t even go into effect immediately. It will take till 1975 before all the non-farm workers covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act reach $2.50. Farm workers won't get there until 1976.  

THE BILL WILL BE SENT TO THE PRESIDENT AFTER AUGUST 25TH IN ORDER TO PREVENT A “POCKET VETO” WHILE CONGRESS IS IN RECESS. IF THE PRESIDENT SHOULD VETO THE BILL WHEN HE GETS IT, CONGRESS WILL BE BACK SEPT. 5TH AND WILL TRY TO OVERRIDE THE VETO — SOMETHING THAT HAS ONLY HAPPENED ONCE THIS SESSION — SO FAR!  

* ACTION - WRITE, WIRE YOUR CONGRESSPERSON AND SENATOR, URGING OVERRIDE IF A VETO OCCURS!!!  

LABOR — HEW VETO THREAT — Coalition for Human Needs and Budget Priorities  

BACKGROUND: Confrontation over national spending priorities between the Congress and the President grows closer as the Senate puts the finishing touches on the Labor-Health, Education & Welfare Appropriation. At stake are numerous human needs programs that the Administration slated for demise in its FY 74 Budget Message.  

*******If the President chooses to veto the Labor-HEW package, as expected, the stage will be set for an effort to OVERRIDE THE VETO, which has only happened once so far!  

The House approved a Labor-HEW Appropriation package on June 26 that is squarely out of the range of Administration expectation — $1.25 billion over Mr. Nixon’s request. Included in the increase is funding for such programs as education for disadvantaged children, hospital construction and modernization, OEO Community Action Agencies, and Legal Service and Senior Citizens Programs, Regional Medical Programs and others — all programs the President wanted to eliminate or reduce in scope. The Senate is currently holding hearings and will finish work  

on the bill in early September. Early speculation is that it will increase funding for these programs — putting the entire Congress squarely on the line against the President.  

Mr. Nixon has repeatedly threatened to veto any bill he considers ‘fiscally irresponsible’. The HEW bill fits his definition. We can therefore expect a veto of the Labor-HEW bill in mid-September, after the Senate and House complete their conference report.  

“IN THE EVENT OF A VETO, WRITE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE AND BOTH SENATORS URGING AN OVERRIDE. WE MUST HAVE IT TO CHANGE OUR COUNTRY’S PRIORITIES FROM MILITARY TO THE MUCH NEEDED DOMESTIC PROGRAMS!
