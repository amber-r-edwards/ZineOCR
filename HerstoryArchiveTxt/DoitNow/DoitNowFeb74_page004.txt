LOS ANGELES NOW’S EDUCATION COMMITTEE has produced a multi-media, consciousness-  
raising program about sexist education of youngsters at home and school. It spans the  
ages of 3 to 18, illustrating how typical American socialization leaves girls with low self-  
esteem and builds sexist attitudes in boys. The program is appropriate for teacher, counselor  
and parent audiences. The 35-page script and 50 slides are available for sale at $18.50, with  
profits to be used by the Education Committee of Los Angeles NOW for additional action  
projects. Contact: Marilyn Ellas, Education Committee Coordinator, NOW Center, 8864 West  
Pico Blvd., Los Angeles, Calif. 90035.

ST. LOUIS NOW has initiated a project with the goal of Susan B. Anthony’s birthday being
