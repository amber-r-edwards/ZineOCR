NOW MEMBERS — SENSITIZE YOUR CONGRESSPEOPLE!  

Anyone wishing a copy of the proceedings of Rep. Martha Griffiths’ hearings on the Economic  
Role of Women before the Joint Economic Committee should request copies from their own  
Senators or Representatives. REMEMBER: REQUESTING SUCH INFORMATION FROM  
YOUR CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES IS A GOOD WAY TO POINT OUT TO THEM  
THAT CONSTITUENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WOMEN’S ISSUES!

ATTENTION NOW MEMBERS! RIGHT-TO-LIFERS ARE AT IT AGAIN!  

As of this writing, the Right-to-Lifers and some church groups were again attacking abortion  
with a vengeance — this time through the “MAUDE” TV series and CBS Television.  

Background: Over 20 stations throughout the country refused to broadcast the repeat of the  
two-part MAUDE program on abortion scheduled for August 14 & 21. The stations included:  
WWL, New Orleans; WMBD, Peoria, Illinois; WISM, Milwaukee; WNAC, Austin, Texas;  
KXJB, Fargo, N. D.; WSBT, South Bend, Indiana; WTEN, Albany, N. Y.  

As of August 14, two sponsors had withdrawn from the program, with pressure from right-to  
life groups cited as the cause.  

According to NOW President Wilma Scott Heide:  

“BUT NOW CAN PRESSURE TOO. Anti-abortion groups have no patent on  
letter-writing.  
NOW MEMBERS ARE URGED TO WRITE TO THESE SPONSORS TO  
PROTEST THEIR WITHDRAWAL FROM SPONSORSHIP OF THE PROGRAM  
and furthermore, to avoid buying their products.”
