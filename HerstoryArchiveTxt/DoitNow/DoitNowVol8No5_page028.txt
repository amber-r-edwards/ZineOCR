“ASK NOW”

I have recently moved, and didn’t
receive my last issue of DO IT NOW. I sent
you a change of address, and left a for-
warding address at my post office. What
happened?

A: We checked our records and found
that we received your change of address in
mid-May, which was after the cut-off date
for adding new data (like your new ad-
dress) on the computer. So, while we had
changed our records to reflect your ad-
dress change, your last issue of DO IT
NOW was mailed to your former address.

Second class mail is not forwardable, and
the post office is very lax about sending
address changes back to us. (We just
received an address change in June for a
DO IT NOW mailed out in October!!) We
do, however, keep extra copies here in the
National Office for situations such as
yours, and have mailed you another copy.

In the future, please send us your new ad-
dress as soon as possible. Our cut-off
date is usually the 25th of the month
preceding the issue. We can assure that
all new data received in the National Office
by the 25th will be processed in time for
the next DO IT NOW. Also, if you are in a
leadership position, please tell us, so we
can change the data on our leadership rec-
ords as well as our membership records.
Thanks!

FOR YOUR INFORMATION

The Project on the Status and Education of
Women of the Association of American
Colleges has released “A Survey of
Research Concerns on Women's Issues”
in an attempt to give researchers and
policy-makers a clear overview of the
variety of areas affecting women in the
workforce and in society in general. This
survey outlines some of the research
already conducted in the area of women’s
interests, clarifies research priorities and
suggests possibilities for future studies.
The report is available from the Association
of American Colleges, 1818 R St., NW,
Washington, D.C. 20009.

A report on the “Constitutional Aspects of
the Right to Limit Childbearing” is currently
available from the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights. The report analyzes the manner in
which proposed constitutional amend-
ments designed to nullify the right to limit
childbearing would undermine basic civil
liberties outlined in the 1st, 9th and 14th
Amendments. It includes a description of
the historical development of statutes
prohibiting abortion, and details the effect a
constitutional amendment establishing em-
bryonic or fetal rights would have on com-
mon, private, tort, property and tax laws.
The study also provides a description of
the threat to the enforcement of other civil
rights posed by an amendment that would
nullify the Supreme Court decisions on the
right to limit childbearing. “This right can-
not be infringed or eliminated without
weakening the foundation of all rights,” ac-
cording to the all-male panel. For a copy

CREATIVE WOMAN

Abramson, Joan. The Invisible Woman,
Washington, D.C.: Jossey-Bass Publish-
ers, 1975, 237 pp.

Joan Abramson, a University of Hawaii in-
structor and director of a major university
program, was denied tenure and fired
because she is a woman. The Invisible
Woman is her story about sex
discrimination she and all women face in
the academic profession and her
suggestions for what academic ad-
ministrators can do about it. Read her ac-
count of agencies women can turn to in or-
der to file sex discrimination complaints,
what they should expect from them, and
what risks they must take. Example: After
favorable rulings from both the Labor
Department and the EEOC, Abramson has
not won her job back.

Her firm stand on affirmative action: “The
choice is to understand and cooperate in
correcting the situation or to spend ad-
ministrative time and effort and quantities
of institutional resources in defense of an
indefensible, illegal, and immoral position.
Equal employment opportunity may be
postponed because of intermittent govern-
ment enforcement or unwillingness on the
part of university faculty members and ad-
ministrators to voluntarily comply with the
law. But it cannot be prevented. Women
mean business.”

Leslie Friedman, Athens (GA) NOW mem-
ber, has a slide show on sexism in ad-
vertising ready to present to any interested
chapters as a humorous consciousness
raiser. She is ready and anxious to travel.
Contact her at 235 Sycamore Drive, H-9,
Athens, GA 30601.

The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights has
also published a report criticizing the lack
of emphasis by the government in helping
women obtain business opportunities as
federal contractors. The report was
prepared in an attempt to help the
executive and legislative branches “struc-
ture programs that will be more responsive
to the needs of minority firms and will
provide new opportunities for non-minority
female-owned firms.” The report, entitled
“Minorities and Women as Government
Contractors” is available from the U.S.
Commission on Civil Rights, Washington,
D.C. 20425.

THE MOTHER WHO WORKS
OUTSIDE THE HOME
by Sally Wendkos Olds

There is no one
kind of working
mother. Some are
deliciously rich and
others are desper-
ately poor. Some
are blissfully mar-
ried and others are
miserable in their
marriages or not
married at all.

Some are pursu-
ing high level professional careers and
others are toiling at menial jobs. Some
are black, some are white, others are
all shades in between.

Working mothers in all sorts of situations
—and working fathers too—will find
answers to their questions in this book.
