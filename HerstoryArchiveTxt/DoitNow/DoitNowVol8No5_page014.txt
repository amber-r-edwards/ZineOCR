NLDEF REPORT

The NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund would like to hear  
from NOW members interested in joining the legal staff of the NOW  
LDEF Women’s Advocacy Project. As reported in the July/August  
issue of DO IT NOW, the Fund hopes to match a foundation  
challenge grant and hire two attorneys for a project focusing on  
equal economic opportunity and Title VII law. Tentative plans are for  
the office to open in New York early in 1976. It prefers that ap-  
plicants have experience in Title VII litigation.

Please send information on your qualifications to Mary Jean Tully,  
President, NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, 9 West 57th  
Street, New York, New York 10019.

Just received from Mary Jean Tully; “I’m happy to report that the fir-  
st step toward matching the grant has been taken by the NOW  
Board in awarding $7500 for the first six months of the project. The  
incoming NOW board to be elected in October will be asked for an  
additional $7500 for the remainder of the first year and a com-  
mitment of $15,000 for Year Two.”

The NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund Public Service Ad-  
vertising Campaign on the theme of Equal Rights for Women, laun-  
ched in June, 1973, is still miraculously running in the media two  
years later! The NLDEF office has received notice from two  
television stations tallying up the estimated media value of our  
television spots as follows: WNBC-TV in New York (19 TV spots  
from April-June, 1975 Value: $13,875) and KPLR-TV, St. Louis,  
Missouri (Feb.-June, 1975) 57 TV spots — Value: $5,280). The  
NOW LDEF office is certain that the spots are running on many  
other radio and television stations that have not reported their  
scheduling. Please note that discs containing radio spots — and  
some print ad material from the famous campaign that bears the  
slogan ‘“Womanpower, It’s Much Too Good To Waste”, are still  
available through the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund of-  

fice.

FELLOWSHIPS

The President’s Commission on White House Fellowships is par-  
ticularly anxious to recruit women for the program for the year  
beginning September 1, 1976 to September 1, 1977.

Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Carla Hills has writ-  
ten to NOW urging that more women apply for the program.

Each year the Fellowship Program selects 14-20 young American  
women and men between the ages of 23 and 35 to serve as special  
assistants to the Vice President, members of the Cabinet, and the  
President’s principal staff. At the present time there are 14 White  
House Fellows, two of whom are female.

The Program is interested in people who are, “highly motivated and  
have demonstrated leadership ability in their particular field.”  
Stipends are as high as $30,000.

November 10, 1975 is the deadline for requesting applications  
for the 1976 program.
