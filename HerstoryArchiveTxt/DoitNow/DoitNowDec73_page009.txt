CONGRATULATIONS!! AFL-CIO & NOW MEMBERS

On October 22, 1973 the AFL-CIO passed the following resolution:

RESOLVED: that the tenth biennial convention of the AFL-CIO endorses the Equal Rights 
Amendment to the U. S. Constitution as precisely the kind of clear statement
of national commitment to the principle of the equality of the sexes under the
law that working women and their unions can use to advantage in their efforts
to eliminate employment discrimination against women, and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED: that state labor federations, in states which have not yet
ratified the ERA, urge their legislatures to act favorably .....

In a letter to George Meany, President of the AFL-CIO, NOW President Wilma Scott Heide and
Legislative Vice President Ann Scott wrote: “This is indeed a momentous day. (The) AFL-CIO’s
significant role in the democratization of the basic legal document of this land will be of historic
import. As we have in other areas in the past, NOW looks forward to one more endeavor where
AFL-CIO will work with us in common cause for the completed ratification of the ERA. NOW’s
Legislative Office and the State Legislative ERA Coordinators will welcome cooperative arrangements
providing information to facilitate effecting speedy ERA ratification in at least a necessary eight of
the states where ratification has not yet been accomplished.”

The campaign for AFL-CIO endorsement was led by the women in the union movement and many of
the unions which had already endorsed. The AFL-CIO Constitution was also amended to read “To
encourage all workers without regard to race, creed, color, sex, national origin or ancestry to share
equally in the full benefits of union organization.”

Congratulations NOW members who lobbied so effectively for this tremendous endorsement. The
combination of the inside/outside alliance of women and men for ERA culminated in a terrific victory!

ERA RATIFICATION COUNCIL RESOURCE CENTER

The ERA Ratification Council is composed of national organizations working for ERA. The Council
voted to establish a resource center to gather all materials on the ERA in one place, or at least a
reference card on each item. Common Cause offered to “house” the Center and provide some volun-
teers to help set it up. NOW Legislative Office has provided assistance in designing a cataloging system
which is complete with a cross reference. The cross reference will be able to indicate such things as:
Is there a study of sex discrimination in criminal law in Iowa? What kind of hearings were held in
New Mexico? N. H.? etc. NOW Legislative Office Intern, Connie Abrashoff (Trinity College) has
screened all our files and typed entry cards for the Center. An extra set of cards of our files will be
kept in our office. Upon request, the Center will answer inquiries and inform you of materials listed
in the Center and where you might obtain the material. The Center will not send materials or copies.
All member organizations of the Council will be able to make inquiries and to go to the Center to use
materials on file. This is a really big effort and every NOW member is needed to make it successful.
Please send us bibliographies of your personal collection — and, if possible, copies of your materials.
Connie will type entry cards and place them in the Center index. The Center plans to publish a
catalog of all entries. A notice will be placed in the Washington Blue Sheet when the catalog is com-
pleted and the Center is ready for use.

PLEASE PROVIDE AS MUCH INFORMATION AND MATERIAL AS POSSIBLE. THE 2 YEARS
FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ERA BEGINS TO LOOK SHORTER EVERY DAY AS
RATIFICATION COMES CLOSER. THIS CENTER WILL PROVIDE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO
VALUABLE INFORMATION FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION.
