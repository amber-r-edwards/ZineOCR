WASHINGTON, D. C. NOW, with the Gay Activists Alliance and the Federation of Students,  
worked and lobbied hard for passage of the Human Rights Law (Title 34) of the District of  
Columbia. The intent of the District of Columbia Council, in passing this new law, was “to secure  
an end, in the District of Columbia, to discrimination for any reason other than that of individual  
merit, including, but not limited to discrimination by reason of race, color, religion, national origin,  
sex, age, marital status, personal appearance, sexual orientation, family responsibilities, matricula-  
tion, political affiliation, physical handicap, source of income, and place of business,” in housing,  
commercial space, places of public accommodation, educational institutions, public service and  
employment.

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN CORPORATE NEWSLETTERS was the subject of a presentation  

by Joan Nicholson, former NOW Image of Women in the Media Task Force Coordinator, before  
the Long Island Communicators Association. The thrust of the speech was that employee  
publications can and should do two things for women employees: (1) provide detailed and  
positive information about affirmative action programs, and (2) give women employees “visibility”  
in company publications. As a follow-up action, Joan suggests that Chapter Compliance and  

Image Committees survey newsletters of local companies for possible input by NOW chapters.
