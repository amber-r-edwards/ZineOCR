STATE ERA INFORMATION  

MARYLAND — The Governor’s Commission to study and recommend implementation  
legislation for the ERA has been announced. Two NOW members,  
Ann Scott and Helen Parker, will be serving with seventeen people  
under Chairperson Lucy Garvey, Attorney from the Women’s Law  
Center.  

KENTUCKY — The State Attorney General's Office issued an opinion that “it would be  
futile for the General Assembly to try to rescind its approval of the  
ERA to the U.S. Constitution. . . . . it appears that such a  
resolution, if adopted by the General Assembly, would simply be  
ignored by the Congress.” — statements by Asst. Atty. Gen.,  
Mary Ann Delaney.  

AFL-CIO 10th NATIONAL CONVENTION, MIAMI, FLORIDA, OCTOBER 18-20.  

Realizing that the press deadline for DO IT NOW is October 5th, we hope that you will  

already know of the AFL-CIO Convention and that we have been working for an ERA  

endorsement. As of October 5th, it looks good for a reversal by the AFL-CIO, one of the  

largest organized groups still opposing the ERA. Paul Jennings, President, I. U. E., has  

announced he will introduce a Resolution on the floor for endorsing the ERA. NOW  

strategy to swing labor around seems to have been very effective in two ways: 1. the raising  

of the names and activities of the opposition and their traditional anti-labor views and votes.  

2. the raising of the issue of “protective labor laws” which are either being extended to  

men and/or women as a benefit or struck down as prohibitive under Title VII. The Legis-  

lative Office has prepared an ERA LABOR KIT which was mailed October 5th to the  

Legislative Task Force, Union Task Force, Board, ERA Coordinators. Included is a list of  

Pro ERA Organizations, Anti ERA Organizations with notation of the Anti groups that  

support “right to work” legislation; information on “protective laws” and what’s happening;  

a page of quotes from opposition.... including the latest from Robert Welch, founder  

JOHN BIRCH SOCIETY in the July, 1973 Bulletin: “Fortunately, such patriotic and out-  

standing women as Mrs. Phyllis Schlafly and Mrs. Jacquie Davidson had been sounding the  

alarm in a vigorous though losing campaign,” he says, explaining, “they did not have behind them  

any organization with the cohesiveness and experience and leadership drive which the Birch mem-  
bership could supply. Welch claims that as a result of the subsequent Birch involvement, the  

ERA was stymied. (Quoted from HOMEFRONT, August, 1973)
