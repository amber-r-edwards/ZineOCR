NOW REFORMS MEDIA BROADCAST CODE

The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) has agreed to revisions to its Radio Code as proposed by NOW, following a presentation on the image of women in the media by NOW Vice President/Public Relations Toni Carabillo. At an earlier meeting of the NAB Television Code Review Board, the broadcasters agreed to the “thrust and spirit” of NOW’s changes for the television code, also presented by Toni Carabillo.

The revisions, prepared by Joan Nicholson (National Coordinator, Image of Women Task Force) and Whitney Adams (National Coordinator, FCC Task Force) were aimed at stricter guidelines for broadcasters in portraying women in programming and advertising. Joyce Snyder of New York NOW was highly instrumental in arranging NOW’s participation in the NAB Code conferences.

NAB officials have now strengthened their organization’s commitment to the improvement of the image of women in the media, with “reaffirmation, wider and intensified publicizing, and more insightful implementation . . . towards accomplishing the goals affecting the dignity, among others, of women . . . ” NOW will contribute a guest column in the NAB’s monthly CODE NEWS, to be followed by national and local NOW action currently being planned by Whitney Adams and the FCC Task Force and Joan Nicholson and the Image Task Force. Please send your suggestions to the NOW Public Information Office, 641 Lexington Avenue, New York, N. Y. 10022. In addition, the NAB is distributing copies of Toni Carabillo’s presentations to all stations which subscribe to the radio and television codes.
