NOW’S TASK FORCE ON OLDER WOMEN has developed a new kit of materials to open battle  
against the disastrous conditions of most women from menopause through old age. The materials  
include a pamphlet, GROWING OLDER FEMALE, “a sampler of facts, opinions, questions and  
proposals — a first attempt to define the problems and look for solutions.” Also included is an  
interview outline which explores what it means to grow older in a society that is not only sexist  
and racist, but is also ageist. A copy of PRIME TIME, an independent newsletter for older women  
working closely with the Task Force, and other materials are part of the kit, which is available  
from the National Office for $2, or free to Task Force members. Coming soon will be position  
papers on social security, pensions, menopause, sexuality of older women, etc. Anyone interested  
in helping prepare such papers, please contact the coordinator, Tish Sommers, 434 66th Street,  
Oakland, Calif. 94609 (415) 653-1435.
