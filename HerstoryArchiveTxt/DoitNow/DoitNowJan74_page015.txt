John Meuser presented “A Man’s View of Women’s Liberation” as part of Charlotte NOW’s “You’re On”  
program in October. In part he said: Men should support feminism, because feminism supports them.  

It is a movement for men’s liberation as well as women’s liberation. For example, as long as job discrimination  
against women is allowed to persist, a man will continue to find himself the principal wage earner  
of the family and will be forced to work until retirement simply because he has greater earning power  
than his spouse. If the salaries for men and women were equitable, a couple able to live on one income  
could share the burden of family support — each taking time off to pursue other activities. (See Flexible  
Hours Bill in Blue Sheet).

Charleston, S.C. Fran Chester introduced her husband, Scott, into NOW and both are active members  
of Charleston NOW.  

CATHOLIC ORGANIZATIONS SUPPORTING THE ERA  

“The National Board of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious took a stand on the ERA at their  
February meeting. With only one dissent, the Major Superiors who come from 15 different sections of  
the country favor the passage of the amendment. Sr. Margaret Brennan, IHM, President of the Conference,  
said that the board members had studied the question and were aware of some of the problems that might  
arise and also some of the fears that have been generated in connection with the amendment. ‘We need  
to address ourselves to those problems and fears as they arise, but not at the expense of the passage of  
such a good and important thing as the ERA,” Sr. Margaret commented. She added that Catholic women  
face a huge education task in regard to this amendment.” The following statement concerning ERA was  
issued by 18 members of the National Board of LCWR: ‘We believe in the equal rights of women because  
we believe in the equal rights of persons. We stand for concomitant safeguards against any interpretation  
of the Equal Rights Amendment that would be destructive of persons’ from press release of February  
23, 1973. Other Catholic organizations which have endorsed the ERA are: St. Joan’s Alliance,  
National Coalition of American Nuns, and NETWORK.  

THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH ENDORSES THE ERA  

“The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) endorsed today the Equal Rights Amendment and called  
for increased participation of women in their own ranks. The resolutions were passed by more than  
5,000 delegates to the church’s Third General Assembly, October 31, 1973.
