PRESIDENT’S COMMENTS  

“If you/your chapter want to work on the Bicentennial: NOW found the AMERICAN REVOLUTION BICENTENNIAL COMMISSION to be undemocratic, political, commercial and anti-feminist; so we have joined others to form the independent WOMEN’S COALITION FOR THE THIRD CENTURY. Exciting projects related to our past, the present and our future will be in the works and await your creation. The goal is the empowerment of women.” NOW President Heide is on the steering committee. Chair-One is Reverend Patricia Budd Kepler (NOW member). Contact her at the Harvard Divinity School, 45 Francis Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts.  

Dr. George Wiley, National Coordinator of the MOVEMENT FOR ECONOMIC JUSTICE and former Executive Director of the NATIONAL WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION, drowned on August 8. Our nation has lost a champion of justice. In memory of George and to modestly aid our common cause, NOW President Heide contributed $25 to support the movement Dr. Wiley was creating. Address: 1785 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036.

HOLD YOUR PROTEST LETTERS!  

CORRECTION: The item in the August issue on the Women’s Hall of Fame was incorrect. The WHOF has since announced a list of women who justly deserve the honor. It is hoped that the Women’s Hall of Fame will, in the future, honor contemporary feminists as well.
