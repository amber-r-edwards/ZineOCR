CALL TO NOW’S SEVENTH CONFERENCE

Dear Sisters and Brothers in NOW:

Would you believe, NOW’s 7th Conference scheduled for May 25, 26, 27, 1974 in Houston, Texas,
is only about five months hence? As inexorable as time itself is the Theme (so far) selected for the
Conference: YOU CAN’T STOP NOW! Yes, it does have meanings for NOW members and non-
(yet) members.

Conference purposes include inspiration and (re) dedication; education and skills; policy and
strategy; feminist forum — personal and political (personal is political and vice versa); evaluation.
Whatever else, the Conference is our periodic opportunity to get together, to affirm, confirm our
commitment to and development of feminism that is central to any humanism. It’s experience
and a process as well as ‘happening(s)’.

This Conference will have some innovations. As always, we will choose people for particular respon-
sibilities and opportunities, i.e. officers, other Board members and 3 of the 7 next nominating com-
mittee. Unlike some instances previously, at least two nominees for each job will be presented to
the Conference attendees by the Nominating Committee. Other candidates will be possible and
welcomed. Also, campaigning will be more open and guidelines will be more liberal to facilitate
knowing candidates and their platforms. (Nominating Committees developing these NOW and will
publish in DO IT NOW). We also anticipate information on How NOW Works (something con-
stantly evolving), a Conference ‘Survival’ booklet, and Resolution guidelines so we can resolve
relatively less and strategize more to move from institutionalized sexism to institutionalizing feminism.
Chapters will want to discuss any really new resolutions pre-Conference after familiarity with elu-
tions and policy we already have in considerable areas.

Opportunities to showcase chapter achievements; to see/buy feminist products; to share our sister-
hood and brotherhood for personhood; to laugh and commiserate; to create NOW’s development
and our own; to celebrate our viability and know our rising expectations opens us to vulnerabilities;
all of these and more are part of a NOW conference. As the largest unequivocally feminist organiza-
tion in the world and a vanguard in the profound universal behavioral revolution in this rebirth of
feminism: YOU CAN’T STOP NOW! We will define and reassign power for Life. Come to Houston!

Warmly,

Wilma Scott Heide.
