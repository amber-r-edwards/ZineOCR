Beautiful doors grace the entrance to the Felton Guild.  

Felton Guild  

The Felton Guild is the center of activity for ap-  
proximately ten distinct craft groups: woodworking,  
woodcarving, stained glass, jewelry, ceramics,  
photography, typography, printing, arts/crafts  
gallery, café, and a future bookstore. There are ap-  
proximately 30 artists and craftspeople forming a loose  
association united in a venture of mutual cooperation  
to pursue and perfect their skills while creating a  
more solid economic base for their work. We are  
always looking for more high-energy, creative people  
to participate with us in creating their own work/studio  
space and/or placing their work in our gallery.  

The setting of the Felton Guild is in the beautiful  
Santa Cruz Mountains on two and one-half acres along  
the scenic Sea & Tree Tour of Highway Nine. The Guild  
is just one mile south of Felton and just below the  
entrance to the Cowell State Park on the opposite side  
of the highway. Four beautiful redwood groves,  
several giant oaks, firs, along with a number of apple  
trees, give seclusion to the property.
