Choreopoem

Poetry is of triumphs-

Of loves, of tears, of life, of years  
Simple, complex, who the hell cares?  
Sonnet form, free verse-

Shit on it all.

The “Old Masters”-

What do they know

Of my first step, my first orgasm,

My death?

Able alliterators, multiple metaphors,

Obscure meanings of “dots on paper” and even

Greek allusions can now convey my meanings better than  
Feelings on paper.

Banality, originality,

Who are you to compare my feelings with some  
Picasso of the English language?

My emotions know nothing of tone changes and  
Iambic pentameter.

Feelings desecrated in ivory college towers by  
Poetic surgeons and sadistic students.

Therefore, I refuse to hide my feelings-

My poetry and emotions will not die the agonized death  
Of professorial probes and misguided analyses.

The only reason why I have nothing to hide is

That I don’t want anyone searching for anything.

Once Again

The pain shot through her body and  
her soul screamed.

It screamed until it seemed that  
Creation itself would rattle and  
shatter into a million pieces.

It was the pain--

The same pain that agonized

her mother, her sister, her friends  
and millions of others totally  
unknown to her.

It was the pain--

The same pain that she had

felt before and swore before all that  
was Holy and she would never

feel again.

It was the pain--

The same pain that made her  
ashamed to face the public and

lie to her man and -

CRY

when she saw a black babe-in-arms.  
It was the pain--

The same pain that was known to  
cause paranoia, schizophrenia,  
neurosis, psychosis, depression, high blood pressure,  
heart disease, cancer and

chain smoking.

It was the pain--

The same pain that caused her to  
look for things she didn’t want to and  
cry when she didn’t need to and

do what she shouldn’t have to.

It was the pain--

The same pain that stopped her when  
she should have stayed and

made her scream as a mad

woman all night long.

And her friends understood,

as they had all screamed this same  
scream of

Invaded again

Only to be conquered, plundered  
and left again.

Oh he didn’t mean to, but  
“What can I say?”

Right people, wrong time,

or were they right?

She was patient and willing, and  
as always, she put all her

efforts into another futile  
endeavor.

He saw it as a temporary stop  
with all intentions of moving on  
as soon as possible.

Were they right?

At the time, not for each other.  
As she braced herself for another hard slap,  
he loaded his rifle.

For Progressive Women Only

I know womanhood in America is a bitch because:  
you  
listen to your mama and the preacher and the great white notion  
of proper womanhood in America as prescribed by  
Amy Vanderbilt-  
all the little niggers  
you know the ones who make your heart jump when  
they smile  
and you drool and daydream about French kissing in the middle of class  
when they can’t get none they call you STUCK UP BITCH  
and when  
you trust them and do give up you just a plain ol’ bitch without the  
stuck up so you a bitch either way you go.  
See ’cuz I know lots of women (myself included)  
who been two kinds a bitches and who worried and worried  
about how not to be either one  
and one by one we concluded that women are bad, see?  
’Cuz if a nigger got to cuss you out for not giving him your  
body, you must be real bad cuz cussin takes a lot of energy and  
niggers is real lazy - don’t like to exert no excess energy  
And if a nigger got to cuss and tell everybody you gave in, well...  
I only cuss and talk when it’s real good so that means you still bad see  
so when a nigger calls you a bitch,  
THANK HIM
