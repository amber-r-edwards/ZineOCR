We went into considerable debt to publish  
this issue. If you want to help us with  
production costs and become a sponsor of  
Spring’s Aurora, please send a check to 2575  
Yale Station, made out to Aurora. Thank  
you.

If you are interested in helping with the  
next issue of Aurora, coming out in  
mid-May, write to 2575 Yale Station, New  
Haven, CT 06520. There will be a meeting to  
discuss the next issue in mid-February.  
Details will be in the Advocate, in Yale  
Station and posted at the Women’s Center.

We would like to dedicate this issue to  
MEG STARR

who has done more for women at Yale  
than she realizes.
