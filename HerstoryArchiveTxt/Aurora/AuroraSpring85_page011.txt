Requiem (A Fish Story)

My mother’s earliest memories are  
not of life but of death.

“We had many servants around the  
house. I wasn’t allowed to walk the  
grounds on my own. People watched  
me and followed me wherever I went.  
The house was lovely, with a huge  
garden containing carefully trimmed  
bushes and stone sculptures. White  
sand covered the ground where the  
thick moss stopped growing. Father in-  
structed the servants to rake the fine,  
white ocean of sand three times a day  
to keep the lines smooth and parallel.

“There was also a pond where Father  
kept a dozen prize carp. They were the  
color of Mother’s silk kimonos, shiny  
and golden, patches of gold and silver  
shimmering underneath bright oranges  
and deep reds.

“One day, I watched as two servants  
went into the garden pushing a cart  
that usually held sheared branches and  
dried leaves. They pushed it over the  
path to the pond and reached down to  
scoop up one fish. The carp they  
caught was the oldest in the pond. It  
was the length of my arm and entirely  
black. With the cart full of water, they  
walked back toward the house, leaving  
a trail of water across the garden over  
the neatly raked sand, onto the tatami  
floor. The entire household was behav-  
ing strangely. The servants did not say a  
word as I followed them into the kit-  
chen.

“I watched as one servant grabbed  
the fish with both hands and placed it  
on the chopping block. It made struggl-  
ing, swooshing sounds as it flipped  
around on the slippery board. With one  
hand, the servant held its body, and  
with the other he held a cleaver; as he  
came down onto it, the carp slipped  
young life?

My mother was born in a small  
Japanese coastal town, famous for its  
kamaboko, fishcake rolled in seaweed,  
masu-zushi, bright salmon slices  
layered on vinegared rice, and drugs.  
Her family was rich and well-educated;  
they had a spacious home and a grand  
garden, but I have only seen the plot of  
land where Mother thinks it may have

stood. The house burned to the ground  
during the war.

It was during this time that her father  
died. Soldiers surrounded Toyama and  
the house was used to quarter soldiers  
while the family took refuge in the sur-  
rounding hills, far from the ancestral  
home. The funeral took place in the  
mountains.

“Father's body would not burn; his -  

remains haunted us for weeks.

“It drizzled the day of the funeral.  
The servants spent an entire day dress-  
ing Father up in silk robes and putting  
flowers in the coffin. The servants car-  
ried out his body in the procession as  
we walked from the temple to the out-  
door funeral pyre.

“It was a lovely walk. We reached a  
clearing where the pyre was to be built.  
A priest dressed in formal robes  
chanted several words, and as the peo-  
ple gathered around the clearing, the  
bier was set down, and the servants  
scurried around to prepare for the  
cremation. I closed my eyes to pray.  
The collective chanting hovered over  
the clearing in a buzz. I felt the  
presence of a flame. I opened my eyes  
and found that the bier had been set  
fire to. The people shuffled back to the  
path and we walked back to the tem-  
ple, waiting for his body to burn so that  
we could return to retrieve his bones  
out of his hand and onto the floor. Over  
and over again, the servant tried to  
grasp the fish until finally, he smashed  
the cleaver on the side of the fish and  
in one hack, tried to sever its head but  
failed. He picked up the now crimson  
and black carp with wet, glistening,  
vibrant scales, and as he pulled to  
dismember its hanging head, the carp  
came alive again and jumped out of his  
hands. The servant bent to the floor  
and finally separated the near-  
disjointed parts, and leaving the head  
of the carp on the floor, he grasped the  
fish with both hands and held it over a  
small lacquered bowl as I watched the  
blood drip slowly from the stump  
which was once its head. But the carp  
still fought to slip through the hands of  
its captor. The servant tightened his

grip, and all I could see now was the  
tail of the carp, wavering in the grip of  
the servant until all movement ceased.  
“I could hear the calling of Father’s  
voice from a distant room. The servant  
wiped the sides of the lacquered bowl  
and placed it on a tray. With greater  
care than he had used to bring the liv-  
ing fish from the pond, the servant rac-  
ed to the room where Father lay ill.

Carp blood does not cure tuber-  
culosis. This grandfather of mine died  
that same year. I try to imagine how he  
reacted to the killing of his prize carp.

Did he enjoy the taste of blood, cup-  
ping the lacquered bowl in both hands, —  

bringing it to his smiling lips? Or did he  
close his eyes and swallow, hoping that  
the thick crimson jelly would not touch  
his palate, hoping only that it would  
cure the illness that would take his  
and ashes from the clearing.

“Many hours passed before we  
walked back up the path. Only the  
family went this time. As we ap-  
proached the clearing, I could smell  
the wet smoke. We were instructed to  
pick up what remained.

“The ground was damp, and the driz-  
zle had prevented the pyre from burn-  
ing evenly. I approached the clearing  
and began to pick up what was left  
from the pyre until I came upon a  
smoldering black clump where I im-  
agined Father’s head had lain. I jumped  
and ran to my grandmother who said it  
was alright if I stopped as long as I had  
retrieved one bone. “At least your  
father is not one whose family will not  
return to reclaim the ashes,” she said.

“What remained of Father was put in  
a box which was wrapped in sheets of  
white silk. It was placed on a pedestal  
next to his picture, to remain there for  
forty-nine days. I was afraid of the  
room. I was afraid that it would begin  
to smolder and a charred black ghost  
would reach out and pull me into a  
box. My grandmother finally convinced  
me after two weeks that I should pay  
my respects to Father by praying at the  
pedestal.

“I kneeled down and closed my eyes  
to pray. I was alone in the room when I -  

suddenly heard scratching noises com-  
ing from inside the box. I ran out of the  
room and found my grandmother, who  
explained that some insects must have

been picked up with the ashes, and that  
the creatures were still living in the box,  
scratching to get out.”

Mother chats with her best friend  
over delicate cups of tea, having visited  
a recently widowed friend.

“She’s aged, and looks so tired.”

“At least her mother is here to look  
after the house.”

“Was she the one who called Fukui  
Brothers to make arrangements for the  
marriage?” 

“Did you say marriage, Misako-san?”

“I’m sorry,” said my mother, “Mar-  
riage. Funeral. Same thing.”

When I was a little girl, I wanted to  
tell my mother that I loved her.

“How do I say it?” I asked her.

“Arigato gozaimasu” is good but it  
means “thank you very much.” A very  
little girl can say “sukidesu,” but even  
this only means “I like you.” There is no  
literal way to say “I love you” to  
parents. “Aishite imasu” means “I love  
you,” but only when you are in love  
can you say that. There is no other way  
to say “I love you” in Japanese, so you  
can use your English; I will  
understand.”

I like to think that my mother mar-  
ried for love. She married against the  
wishes of her family and against tradi-  
tion. She worked while he finished  
school, she waited while he worked in  
America. They had two children and  
raised them with the hope that they  
would become responsible adults.

In a recent conversation, my mother  
told me that she felt that perhaps my  
father had difficulty in expressing his  
feelings. She wondered whether he felt  
trapped in his work, in his duties, in his  
responsibilities. She wondered whether  
he was still happy in marriage.

“Of course he is,” I said. “Doesn't he  
ever say so?”

This is my mother’s recollection.

In twenty years of married life, my  
father, even in private moments, has  
never uttered the words, “I love you.”
