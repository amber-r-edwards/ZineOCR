BOOK REVIEWS

Idle and Disorderly Persons, by Mary  
Hazzard. Madrona Publishers, 1981.  
$12.95.

Mary Hazzard is currently studying  
playwriting at the Yale Drama School,  
where her play Diary of the Seducer  
was awarded the Molly Kazan Award  
in Playwriting for 1981.

The only orderly and motivated  
thing anyone does in Idle and  
Disorderly Persons is to sit down in  
front of a bus standing ready to cart  
off Vietnam draftees, an act which  
earns the protesters the title. A socially  
aware young housewife and  
mother of two, Phoebe, is surprised to  
find herself participating; but then  
everything that happens to her surprises  
her, down to the very existence  
of the draftees: “the boys themselves  
were real. ...She felt like a source of  
embarrassment to them, as if she  
were a mother rushing to school at  
recess with forgotten mittens.” While  
she and her friends are organizing  
“Women for Peace,” a group that  
sends miles of snapshots of American  
mothers’ sons to Washington in protest,  
all the marriages around her fall  
apart.

The women in this Boston community  
of liberals have limited lives  
whose boundaries they never seriously  
question, although each one is able  
to see the limits on other women  
around her. Phoebe tries to get  
beyond the hypocritical liberalism of  
someone like her brother-in-law, who  
can say of his wife: “Not that I think  
women ought to stay out of politics —  
PTA.” But she herself never really  
does get beyond spending three days  
in jail,  
Washington, and stewing at her husband  
for what he’s done to her. “She is  
sadly real, and probably our mothers’  
age by now. If she brought me my  
mittens to school, I’d be embarrassed  
too.

Nobody in the novel does anything  
extraordinary, or reveals earthshattering  
truths. They are male professors,  
activist housewives, and sexy but  
androgynously bright graduate  
students. Their appeal, or the book’s,  
is in their normalcy and individualness.  
Reading about their fallouts and failings  
and breakups, and tender moments, is like walking  
for once along the same road one  
drives on every day. There isn’t any  
need, but sometimes that’s what  
you'd most like to do.

Braided Lives, by Marge Piercy.  
Summit Books, 1981. $15.50.

Braided Lives is a novel which tells  
the tale of young women’s college ex-  
periences in the fifties, through the  
eyes of Jill, a scholarship student. The  
story centers on Jill and her best  
friend and cousin, Donna, describing  
how they mature during this time of  
political turbulence. Jill is a sturdy  
Jewish intellectual raised on the  
streets of Detroit while Donna is  
blond, Presbyterian and guilt-ridden  
about having had sex with her  
brother-in-law.

In Braided Lives, Marge Piercy  
describes how the sexual, political  
and intellectual are individual strands  
of life that are woven into a long  
heavy braid worn by every woman.  
Jill and Donna, briefly lovers in their  
adolescence, experience the joy and  
pain of heterosexual love and of  
friendship as they fight to maintain  
control of their lives.

Marge Piercy is the author of six  
previous novels and seven books of  
poetry. Raised in Detroit, she attended  
the University of Michigan and  
Northwestern. She presently lives in  
Wellfleet on Cape Cod, having spent  
the prior fourteen years in Boston,  
Chicago, New York, Paris and San  
Francisco. Politically active her entire  
life, she has been involved in the  
women’s movement since the late sixties.

White Feminist Theory and Practice:  
The Race/Sex Analogy

cont. from p.22

and danger, smack of racism and invite  
the inevitable personifications which  
have plagued us for thousands  
of years. The responsibility of espousing  
cultural distinctions is on all informed  
individuals.

Recognizing that there are various  
degrees of oppression is not the same  
as establishing a hierarchy. I cannot  
separate my woman-ness from my  
blackness from my lack of capital  
from my sexuality. And I shouldn’t  
have to. Without further discussion,  
this analogy which isn’t should be  
trashed, before some brown, black,  
red or yellow body is driven to write  
The Invisible Woman.

Delirium: The List of Regrets and No Regrets

Lying in bed alone, interred in mounds  
of used-up tissues, child-proof plastic jars,  
thermometers, and headless empty cans  
from grapefruit concentrate, I think of you.

I reveled in the spareness of my house  
when first you left; your books, and rugs, and plants,  
confused me, penned me in, disturbed the thoughts  
long used to surging freely through my rooms.

How I danced! And leaped —  
space to newly-opened space, alone,  
released from boxes, pails, and silverware,  
the matching sets of love. No chains for me!  
No garbage cans, or scented soaps, or towels  
with monograms, no neatly labelled books  
of photographs in stacks on coffee tables;  
no furniture! A mattress on the floor,  
an orange crate, a table, and a lamp,  
and empty rooms to breathe in; now, my breath  
is labored, white and cold. I have no pills,  
or soup, or friends to bring me casseroles.

How you would gasp! And with reproachful eyes,  
relight my anger as you lit the stove...
