AN UNTIMELY DEATH

I am on the scaffold. What excitement!  
What glitter! What is going on?  

I know so little of this country.  

I suspect it's the coronation of the queen.  
NO. Oh god. I’m wrong.  

It's the execution of the queen!  

and I'm trapped.  

there’s no way I can help.  

there’s no way I can avoid watching.  
perched on this scaffold.  

I got a bird’s eye view.  

The king calls for action. like the  

director of some blown-out passion play.  
He makes a weary gesture.  

it's clear he hasn’t slept in ages.  

first come the ladies-in-waiting.  
there they are. thirty of them.  
dressed alike. high-waisted  
green taffeta gowns.  

moving alike. medieval majorettes.  
that Flemish air. nose in air.  

thirty pairs of tiny hands folded  
over protruding bellies.  

why are condemned women affecting  
a pregnant woman’s gestures?  

and how comical it is. thirty sentenced  
women swaying. some very pretty indeed.  
many on the brink of collapse.  

The king is muttering. what is he saying?  

seems my hearing has become as acute as my view.  

“god damn ladies-in-waiting. get rid  
of them. how I've despised them. always  
clutter up the castle. cluck cluck.”  

He seems to object to them more than  
the queen. but as the saying goes:  

kill me ya kill my dogs. and vice versa.  
it's a package deal. it's the rules of -  

the game. and a king sticks to them.  

they approach a sizeable block of land.  
it's roped off and seasoned with fresh  
topsoil. 31 shovels are lined up face  
down.  

The king decrees that they are to dig  
their own grave. Jesus what a ruckus.  
The women lose what composure they  
had in the procession. They sob openly.  
they wring their hands and cling to  

one another. several fall prostrate.  

those more distraught tear their hair  
and rip their gowns.  

This is getting ridiculous. The prince  
is embarrassed. I throw a quick glance  
toward the castle. Backdrop. There  

is the queen. No one has noticed her.  
She moves as if a dream listless.  
weightless. she seems to have little  

to do with the proceedings. does she  
understand that death is near?  

she seems completely unaware.  

How I admire her! She is a true heroine.  

Oblivious of her power. how power, love  

and death revolve around her! as though  
she had never stood before a mirror.  

The king is exasperated. her lack of  
recognition. does his word mean nothing?  

The ladies-in-waiting make up for it.  
they weep harder at the sight of their  
gentle queen. they beat their breasts in  
unison. a few onlookers swoon. The  
cook has to be carried off.  

The queen is handed a spade. Was that a  
smile that crossed her face? it's impossible  
to tell now.  

Suddenly she shivers and says, “I’m cold.”  
Instantly I feel the intense cold.  

everyone does. god, it's below zero.  
I'm confused. wasn't it just spring?  

everyone has on thin wraps.  

Even the king has but a simple velvet cloak  
and not his usual ermine.  

The ladies’ teeth chatter. the only way  
to keep warm is to move. they begin to  

dig like the devil. thirty women working  
hard in the soil creates great warmth.  

if they stop to rest they'll freeze  

to death.  

The queen can’t seem to get in the swing  
of things. she helps a bit. loosens a  

chunk of hard clay or helps excavate a  
huge rock. occasionally a smooth stone  
or a pretty piece of crystal will attract  
her. she handles it. examines it. turns  

it over. drops it in her train which she  

has gathered up smiling.  
her childish delight in serving herself.  

Frost is making it harder to dig. yet  
the women are working like madmen to  
keep warm.  

The king has lost interest. the queen is  
wandering off. everyone is going home.  

I lose my footing  
fall off the scaffold  
everything in slow motion
