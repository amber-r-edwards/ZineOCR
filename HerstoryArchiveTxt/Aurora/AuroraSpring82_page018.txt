which is the same as being the heavy  
all the time. If I wanted that trip, I’d  
be straight. And honest, I did not give  
a shit about the Super Bowl or the  
NCAA playoffs but he always wanted  
me watching them. I never said  
nothing; I couldn't. I knew he liked to  
think of me that way and like I told  
you, at the beginning I kind of led him  
on, just to keep him. Now, when we  
did it, we both closed our eyes and  
sometimes I don’t even think he knew  
I was there, I was just a body to mean  
whatever was in his dreams. But I  
could still look at him and if I saw him  
with only my eyes he was still what  
I wanted him to be. And it was good to  
have a place to come to nights. In my  
city, December is cold.  

In the summer, when I was little, I  
loved to catch lightning bugs. I would  
snatch them out the air and put them  
in a mayonnaise jar with holes punched  
in the top. At first, they lit up every  
few minutes, and then less and less. I  
didn’t throw them out until I could  
watch for a whole hour without them  
lighting up. I can’t let go too easy the  
things I like, especially being a fag,  
cause the things I like don’t come  
along too often. So I hung on. But on  
Christmas Day, it was like time to  
trash the jar.  

See we were supposed to get each  
other things we thought we could  
both enjoy. I bought him a blue jean  
jacket, but that was only half. Down  
at El Ranchero, everybody was start-  
ing to wear patches that said things  
like “State Police” and “Hell’s  
Angels.” I bought one that said “High-  
way Safety Patrol” and sewed it onto  
the arm of the jacket. That was one of  
my things - there I am stuck in the  

Rafael.  

middle of a super highway. It’s pitch  
black outside and below zero. Right  
before I pass out, Rafael zips up in  
something like a tank. He tells me  
come in, don’t worry, everything's  
cool. We drink some warm soup and  
he starts rubbing our hands together  
so I won't get frostbite. The rest is per-  
sonal. But it was just the kind of  
jacket I imagined him in. Christmas  
morning he opens the package and I  
can see he wants to laugh. “What is  
this?”  

“You can see what it is.”  

“No, this I mean,” he points at the  
patch.  

“Nothing. Just...kind of a joke,  
that’s all.”  

“Highway Safety Patrol. This is  
something I should be giving you.”  
His eyes were mixed-up, sad, like a lit-  
tle boy whose bag got snatched on  
Halloween.  

“How come it’s something that you  
should get me?”  

“Highway Safety Patrol. Man, that’s  
your job.”  

“Rafael, I work in a book store.  
That's my job.”  

“Come on man. You know what I  
mean.”  

I know what he means all right. I  
feel like crying but if I do, that will  
flip him out completely. I just look at  
him.  

“Vaya, hombre, open what I got  
you.”  

He bought me a striped soccer  
uniform, the kind the Chicago Sting  
wear. Just what I frigging wanted. He  
wants me to put it on, so I do. He  
loves it, and we make out under the  
tree, he in his jacket, me in my  
uniform. The sex isn’t that hot. My  
fault.  

After that, I can’t see him with just  
my eyes anymore, even though he  
wore the jacket sometimes. I stop  
watching sports. He wants me to go to  
the doctor. He thinks I’m sick cause I  
don’t get excited about nothing no  
more. Then day by day he gets fed up  
with me, especially since I just com-  
pletely stop working the butch trip. I’m  
just plain old me, whole, man and  
woman, boy and girl and I get an at-  
titude like take it or leave it alone.  
Only reason I don’t split first is cause  
I feel like it’s my fault to begin with.  
I’m the one who fooled him. He  
deserves the kind of happy, punch  
drunk feeling you get when you can  
think. Well, at least I left the son of a  
bitch. And maybe I hope he’ll stay,  
that he can love the whole me.  
Doesn't happen. Middle of January,  
we have a big blow up about a little  
thing. He leaves and I come home  
from work the next day and find all  
my stuff laid out on the table. A note  
is propped up against my gym shoes.  
“Es la hora.” It’s time. I kind of make  
myself laugh. I think well at least I  
learned a little bit of Spanish. It’s the  
last laugh I get for a long time. Rafael  
never calls, not to say how are you  
dog or nothing. Kind of cold, I think.  
You get involved with somebody, you  
should wonder how they’re doing  
every now and then. I guess the whole  
me kind of threw him for a loop.  
Maybe he found a real soccer player.  
If any of them be faggots, Rafael  
could work them.  

I don’t have no comment on the  
whole thing. I’m just telling what hap-  
pened. I don’t cruise no more, but I  
still imagine things. Don’t want peo-  
ple imagining no more things about  

a story by  
Paul Butler  

So, sometimes in my class that gets  
you ready to take the high school  
equivalency test, we do this one exer-  
cise that I hate. After we read a story,  
we have to find what is the main idea  
and what is the best title. I ain’t show-  
ing this to nobody; this is my personal  
business, but I know what my friends  
would say. Faggots wasn’t intended to  
have affairs the same way straights do;  
it’s two different worlds. Their best ti-  
tle would be something like “Another  
Example of a Faggot Romance.”  
Sometimes those dudes get my blood  
up and I know they are  
wrong. They are so wrong. I ain’t sure  
what the main idea of all this is. But  
days when I am not horny and not  
lonely and am thinking clear headed,  
there are a lot of main ideas, a lot of  
morals. Just cause I didn’t make it  
with Rafael don’t mean that none of  
us can’t never make it. Do it? That’s  
what I think on good days like today  
and that’s why I named the story what  
I did. Days when I am tired of not hav-  
ing nobody, but feel like I can’t be a  
whole person if I want somebody to  
want me, I think my friends might be  
tight.
