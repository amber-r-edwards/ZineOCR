Love Letter (from New England)  

My body  

wants your eyes  

to gather its scattered particles  
to remember it  

to give it form  

wants your chest, your belly  
your thighs  

to cover it  

my tongue wants to stroke  
your rising flesh  

my breath causing your flower  
to open up--fragrant  

to let flow your nectar  

to moisten my thirsty throat  

I want your mouth  
between my thighs  
your tongue parting the turf  
of hair--finding  
the knob of expectant flesh  
your saliva anointing her  
until the dark petals  
unfurl--one by one  
until doves  

are set in flight  
inside her

I am obnoxious to each carping tongue  

Who says my hand a needle better fits.  

A poet's pen all scorn I should thus wrong;  
For such despite they cast on female wits,  

If what I do prove well, it won’t advance--  
They'll say it’s stolen, or else it was by chance.

Waiting  

Waiting  

It seems like I’ve been waiting for you  
For ages, for millenniums  

And still you haven’t got here.  

I know there are those barriers  

Obstacles to pass  

So many things to distract  

Important things  

Like wars and revolutions, pots of gold, the holy grail  
Being intellectual, martyr.  

But somehow I think you must know  

We can do it all  

Better together.  

Not in your place or in my place  

But this space--the eye--the eye of balance  
Where the fulcrum lays  

Still and Cool  

Holding the heaviest and most unequal weights  
In balance  

You're so late  
I’m trying to be patient  
Waiting, waiting, to tell you everything;  

But the barriers break,  
Break me and they break you  
Again and again.  

Three times I came to you  

With my bleeding, beating, red-purple heart in hand  
I came pulsing  

You took my heart and didn’t recognize it was a heart  
Threw it to the jagged rocks  

Scattering the remains to the wind.  

We seem to resist what we most want, what we most need  
Unready to give, unready to receive;  

Barriers break me as they break you  

I wear my wound openly.  

When I came again  

You wrapped yourself in sheets and sheets  

Of barbed wire  

I peered over your wall  

To see you wounded, bleeding, scarred  
Calling these emblems, medals  
Garments of war,  

Am I the enemy?  

We touch and draw blood  
Dying from lack of penetration.  

Then in the final time  

The coldest winter of our lives  

I came to you  

It was the first snow, no ice  

And I sat there day and night, day and night  
At your doorstep  

Me in black on all that white  

You had to notice me  

When you stepped over me  

You asked why?  

Barriers break me as they break you.  

In the  
EYE  

of  
BALANCE  

So here I stand in the eye  

The purple mantle cast aside  
Doing the dance of divination  

In skirts of red fiber  

I read all the ancient texts  

Use amulets, charms, conjure  
Send smoke signals  

To get you here  

And still you haven’t made it here  
My rabbit man  

Running, running, running  
Round the horizon  

My double through the looking glass  
Upside down mirror man.
