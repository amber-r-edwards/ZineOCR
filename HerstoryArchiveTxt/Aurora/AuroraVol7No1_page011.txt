indicated some likelihood of rape or

force or both, given the right circum-

stances. So, when you don’t use the
word “rape,” but “forced sex” of
some kind, the percentage goes up.

There’s also work coming out of an-
other department at UCLA working
with male high school students. And
they have found that more than half
of the high school males they inter-
viewed believed it was acceptable
“for a guy to hold a girl down, and
force her to have sexual intercourse
in instances such as when she gets
him sexually excited, or she says she's
going to have sex with him and then
changes her mind.” These circum-
stances make it okay; of course they
wouldn't necessarily use the word
rape.

That was also true, by the way, in
my study of prevalence. I did have
one question that directly used the
word “rape,” but 22 percent of those
44 percent of cases came from other
questions that did not use the word
rape.

So that even years after we’ve been

working on this issue, we still have a
stereotypic notion of what rape is,
and usually if it involves an intimate,
that word is not used, even if it fits the
legal definition. So an important thing
to know if you're doing research in
this area is not to use the word.

The research seems to suggest that
this “rape” is very prevalent and it’s
not just a problem that affects a small
portion of women, and that is being
perpetrated by a small group of men.
The obvious questions seem

about them.

“Why does rape happen? Why do
men rape?”

I would like to read you some of the
answers that Shere Hite got to her
questions in her book on male
sexuality, to her questions about
rape. Hite’s work is not based on a
random sample at all, nor was Kin-
sey’s, nor was Masters’ and
Johnson’s; it’s been unprecedented
to get random samples in this area,
because it’s very difficult and has
been presumed impossible. It’s more
like anecdotal data, but I think it’s of
interest nevertheless.

She asked on her questionnaire,
“Have you ever raped a woman? If

not, have you ever wanted to rape a

woman, and why?” I would like to
read you a few selected responses;
she has a whole chapter on this in her
book. How would you explain these
answers?

“Yes, I'd like to very much. But not
just any woman, because I hate
cruelty to any living thing unless they
deserve or need it, such as quite a few
of the cruel bitch-types. I'd love to see
them beg and cry.”

“I never raped a woman, although I
have felt the urge to many times.
Maybe I’m funny, but I don’t feel like
raping a woman unless I like her, or
she is unusually attractive. Once in a
great while, a woman comes along
who arouses an exceptional rape urge
in you — you feel almost obligated to
rape her, as if it were just natural that
you should have sexual intercourse
with her. Jane Fonda affects me that
way.”

I have wanted to rape a particular

woman I know, who was in a position
of authority over myself and several
hundred other Americans at the
school I attended. She was, and is,
hard, cold, cruel, and sadistic. We of-
ten talked of raping her to degrade
her, gang-bang style, including a herd
of donkey studs. I’m surprised she’s
still alive, to be honest.”

“I have never raped a woman or
wanted to. In this, I guess I am some-
what odd. Many of my friends talk
about rape a lot and fantasize about it.
The whole idea leaves me cold.”

“No, but I wanted to, especially
ones who think that they're so high
and mighty on a pedestal that nobody
can touch them. I would like to rape
them to show them that they're no
better than any cunt walking down
the street.”

“Yes, I have indirectly raped two
different girls several times although
intercourse never took place on any of
these occasions. I guess the reason I
did this was to follow the lead of my
friends who were a year or two older.
This took place when I was in 9th and
10th grade in high school. We were
very attracted to two thirteen-year-old
neighbors. We all knew these girls
well. Over a period of a year, starting
one summer, my friends and I would
catch and hold the girls down, then
strip them of their clothing. We would
then fondle their breasts and insert fin-
gers into their vaginas. They would
struggle and sometimes scream. But
we would not physically harm them. I
think they secretly very much enjoyed
being taken.

Put your story into words

Well, these are just a small selec-
tion. The themes seemed to me to be
that these men want to rape the aloof
woman who rejects them, the woman
who responds positively to them
sexually but doesn’t want intercourse,
and the woman who has had inter-
course but doesn’t want it on another
occasion, which means when women
say “no,” this often is seen as making
men feel provoked into wishing to
rape them.

I would like to talk a little about
child sexual abuse now, because
that’s also part of sexual violence.

With children, physical violence is
often not necessary in order for
sexual abuse to occur because of the
power relationship, the authority rela-
tionship, the difference in physical
size; children are not used to saying
“no” to adults.

It is different for forcible rape or
other forced experiences, but I think
it is extremely serious nonetheless.
So the other issue that my study tried
to determine was the prevalence of
child sexual abuse.

We defined incestual abuse as any
contact that occurred between
relatives that involved some sort of
exploitation. Outside of the family,
the questions related to unwanted
sexual contact that occurred on the
level of petting, or some sort of geni-
tal contact.

Thirty-eight percent of the women
in the sample had had an experience
of incestuous abuse or sexual abuse
outside of the family before they
turned 18. If one picks, as one’s crite-
