~ ‘THREE WOMEN AND

I ;
The moon hid between the classical texts
In the library window; I had imagined her face
Much younger, I had thought I would have
More time to choose between perfect faith
To a glowering mistress
~ And his easy approval; I watched
_ Her slip away down vaulted passageways
_ Lined with caskets of marble wishes
_ Unwittingly fulfilled, leaving me
‘No choice but to follow at her heels.

I
_ The fire of another's hope
Burns condensed despair
~ / From prison walls of a narrow cell.

Two women, pitiably pale and long-limbed,
Huddle behind a latticework of elbows and knees,
Casting prehistoric glances against the flames,

No longer sure if the other :
Is her mistress or her lover,
Her enemy or her slave:

Mm ‘ :
I have wondered why your arm \
Will not cross my shoulders, my face hidden
From you, resting against your thighs;

Night is moving forward a

I have lost my hands in th
raising and falling back.

I hold on but I give, helpless:
in the quick sands.

The sun's race is over,
over on its way back to me
Nothing is done. Nothing
I don’t know how to get

I must make myself whole

beautiful to face him and h
They have sung together
from the sacred cup

and they come back, as if

for me to sanctify them,

taking and receiving with
I, the children and I, of course

Quickly I light the candles
they set the table.

I dry my hands but I feel
more than a wet cloth.

He opens the door, she comes
T.come out of the oven, good
still, under the apron of

They are all seated around the

They washed their hands:

they drank from the sacred

I think of my mother.

He is undressing me in front
and he repeats the same
I am in his hands according
He kisses me.
Gently, he tears my body
He distributes it.

They are eating me alive.

the table,

WAITING

I do my best

writing at Valle’s.

The waitresses here

hate serving women.
Once I covered three
placemats--both sides.
Around succulent lobsters
I curled nets of anger

at having to wait,

woman on woman.

The waitresses like
smart businessmen
who order Manhattans

and eat expense accounts.

They offer the men
more coffee,

My corned beef hash
has turkey in it

and I burn my hand
on the casserole.
Everything else is cold.

If I'm dressed up

they think I’m a whore.
If I'm sloppy

I’ll be a bad tipper.

When I’m with a man,
they smile.
