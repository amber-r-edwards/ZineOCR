After this weekend I desperately
want to break down our communica-
tion barrier and talk to you not only as

page 2
Dear John,
Aurora is our voice: we are individ-
uals, we are a group. 
My dear friend — I want you to know how disturbing it is to me that the power and freedom
I feel in having embraced feminism
cannot be effectively communicated
to you. I’m tired of the frustration I
feel when we try to “talk.” Surely it is
not power and freedom of thought
that you are avoiding. You have no
reason to be afraid of me, unless a
sense of insecurity prevents you from

We are talking to you, to ourselves, to
each other.

But most importantly we are talking
and we will keep on.

These are our voices. . .

a

feeling comfortable in the presence
of whatever you feel “feminism”
means.

If it is synonymous with les-
bianism to you, and you find that life-
style threatening, I would be only too
happy to explain that feminism
welcomes all types of people with
varying lifestyles and opinions. I
would also be glad to discuss with you
why it is that the concept of women
loving women is personally threaten-
ing to you, and help you to under-
stand that each individual's personal
choice, whatever it may be, is ac-
cepted among feminists.

If it means having to give up
“femininity” as you know it, I would

“To love what you do and feel that it matters — how could anything be more
un?”

try to explain that as most of us have
experienced it, “femininity” is a male-
dictated concept of how women
should look and behave. I would en-
courage you to develop your own
sense of what it is to be a woman, and
to live by your decision. Feminism
does not mean that you have to
change your appearance. Whatever
form you choose, you can feel secure
that it will be welcomed in the
feminist community.

If it means speaking out for your
rights and risking the label of a
“screaming women’s libber,” then I
would help you to learn that the self-
confidence and support feminism of-
fers can surmount these obstacles.
After all, as we well know, all great
gains require risk. Hopefully, through
feminism, we can all learn to educate
those who are so quick to place labels
on others.

We see all around us leaders and
groups telling us what and who we
should be — I have never found this
attitude among feminists. I cannot
help but feel it is unfortunate for you
that you cannot bring yourself to
open your eyes, take a good look at
the world around you, and then
embrace every bit of loving and un-
derstanding you can find. I know, if
you opened your heart and your
mind, you would find your place in
the world of feminism, without
having to lose yourself and your
opinions in the process. Please don’t
be afraid — you are my friend, and
you are always welcome in my life.

“We've all known each other so long there’s not even anyone to flirt with.”

It's time to stop blaming rape, class
oppression, racism, sexism, and dis-
crimination of all kinds on some il-
lusive ‘society.’ You and I, who
understand the evils and injustices of
these social and cultural practices,
make up society. We cannot rely on
the “women’s movement” or the
“civil rights movement” to do the
work in order to change social values.
We are society. We must change our-
selves. One of the purposes of
feminism, the women’s movement,
and Aurora, is to help people to un-
derstand how sex roles and social
values affect the way in which we look
at ourselves and each other. It is only
through our individualized self-
criticism and realization that we can
identify and abolish the injustices of
our society.

Love, Robin

your sister, but as a woman in your
world. Please try to hear me as both.
No more quibbling about terms like
“freshperson” and “women’s libber”:
let’s lay aside our misconceptions,
our antagonism, and our defensiveness for a minute and I'll give you a
few reasons why I fight for the things I do.

Your sister was humiliated and dis-
gusted by the guy (slime) who jerked
off while watching her sunbathe (that
was not me). Your sister was ashamed
that she did not punch the guy who
grabbed her crotch while she was
walking down the street (that cannot
be me). Your sister was frightened by
the male stranger who followed her
home and waited outside her apart-
ment (that cannot be me). She cries
because she tries to love males and
cannot — too many have hurt her.

They treat her as something she is
not, should not and will not be. A cul-
ture which permits (doesn’t even
notice) such abuse must be destroyed
and rebuilt. I am trying, we are trying
— talk to me, listen to me, and just try
to understand — because I need your
help. We are blood.
Love, Anne

Aurora

momental and inspirational
who will grow to share this dawn.
reaching out for
and searching each face.
surviving on glimpses of sharp wit
and raw analysis.

Wimin I love.
shared pain.
together.
coming to terms with suicide
to find nothing insane about it.
meeting tomorrow
by the warmth I’ve found today.
for Erin who held me when I was crying
and couldn’t bear to watch another woman
raped.
for Caroline who continually inspires me
to greater consciousness.
for Anne S. who has the sweetest dimples
I have ever known. She keeps me going by
the softness in her eyes and the warmth
of her expression.
for Wimin we love
our mentors,
our models,
our lovers and friends,
who have grown and moved on.
leaving Aurora to self-reliance
and self-expanse.
I fear we are too few and too young
until we speak and touch.
clasping soft supple hands
embracing strong willed minds
breasts on breasts
soft cheeks on painted lips.
We know survival is worth it
and we are moving on.
