page 8 AURORA March 1984

the age of change

is the only poem — vcr,

As I watched you shove your cigarette
smolderingly through

the typing paper,

I suddenly thought that you

were a paper rapper.

— Ruth Shields, 2/26/84

They contradict my inner self
They have not encouraged me to ask
Who am I?
What can I become?
Instead — they have molded me to some form
so alien to my being that I feel as if I
will burst.
My shape is controlled by those around me.
I feel shallow — bounded.
I am walking in a body that is not me.
doubt — pain — lonely — afraid
I long to break free of my mold
and explode into colors

This is not about one person

Will the amazement in my eyes
the throbbing heart
silly, lost words
shatter the wonder of the moment?
I am a bull in that crystal room which is

her life — and flowers and whatever else...
I must beware my power. But each time I leave my boundaries
I need not beware my power: she is strong. Wade

I am slapped

I am out of place

I am driven back and chained to my role

sad — silent — confused.
Please free me —
Let me shout

and dance

and become who I am.

Rosie Kelly

Gerard Koskovich

Song inspired by this from The Faggots and their friends bet-
ween Revolutions: The women who love women wrote a song
for the faggots. It was called, “Anything you do that the men don’t
like is O.K. by us.”

Anything you do that the men don’t like is O.K. by us.
When you embrace other men, right on.
When you hold hands or kiss each other in the street, we are
made stronger.
When you go into a closet and find a dress, high heels, scarves
and necklaces, and put them on; when you do your hair and
make-up and go out into the night, we admire your courage.
When you refuse to play little boys’ corporate games and choose
instead games of love and good feeling, we will join you.
When you threaten a straight man by coming on to him, we
hope they’ll become more aware of how they make us feel.
When you decline to become part of the military-industrial
complex, we can celebrate the strength of pacifism.
These things you do that the men don’t like is O.K. by us.

Love on a Roller Coaster _
(for L.S.)

Sitting across from you,
between us the restraining bar
I wish wasn't there.

Two independent reflections,
quiet apprehension,

polite conversation,

mutual respect,

poised on a pinnacle of fear,

I

a hand lent so hesitantly,

one touch,

my stomach knew its existence near as well as my heart.
Sparks and flames flew,

swept up,

growing ascension,

to a zenith,

built up on the mere expressions of hope.
Speeding round a darkened track
blindness the pervading vision.
Wake up: 
Brake this one-sided affair,

the blurring slows to focus,
realization,

genre, -

slower still,

stepping off,

I felt dizzy,

my world sobers with a thought.
Being on a roller coaster is better
than having been on no ride at all.
