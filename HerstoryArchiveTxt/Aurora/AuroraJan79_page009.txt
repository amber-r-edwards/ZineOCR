you stand  
centered  
predatory  

. in green gauze light  

air of sweet liqueurs  
absinthe  
and taste  
in your mouth  
hand plunged  
et  

~ wave lapping on wave  

endless planed beams  
wooden  

Scraped to the tune  

of feet  
that pay to weave in drink  
not dance  

isolate islands  

mercury  
drifting each night  
further  

“till the shoreline recedes  

“into the back room  
smokefilled magnet  
lives inharmonic  
walls encroaching  
onto light  
faces lost in shadow  
the clock  
stopped some time  
ago  

they sit  
alone  
embracing air  
sucking electric green glow  
le café de nuit  

Sweet absinthe  
Kathryn Gould  

of the old neighborhood feel  
like mud flats  

even though the city  

is manhattan.  

so far  

a way the past breaks  

through subway stops and railroad lines  
--homecoming--  

the silent words  

on open lips head  

tilted west for the sun  

sets like a gibbous moon  

in some small town  

she knew as a child.  

no religion  

but the cross in  

side the skin  
the heart beats, calmly  

she walks  

and it’s home, home, home!  
that she feels,  

where the heart  

sits down first,  

where cowboys  

opened movie theatre doors  
in the 60's daddy always  
gave her a dollar  

so she could dream  

when no promise  

could fill the ditch inside.

my grandfather  

the farmer  
died when I was fourteen.  
it was a silent spring.  

that fall  

I sat on the old couch  

in his empty barn,  

listening to the branches brush  
against the glass panes.  

my uncles,  

Pete and John,  

sold his scythes, his rakes,  
their deathrights.  

he was not close to them,  
or to his own daughter.  

it was my mother,  

(the child of his best friend),  
born in his marriage bed  
she knew his secrets,  

spoke his language  

and taught me  

to call him  

grandfather  

I sat still  

watching the door  

waiting  

till it was late afternoon  

and the terrible throbbing  

in my throat  

could not hold  

and I ran up his apple mountain  

screaming to his Russian Orthodox god  

falling on my hands  
the prayers in my teeth,  
crying for the first time  
since he had left.

FEMME SEMEE  

The envelope  

manila, size medium  

torn  

empty of words  

of pretty phrases  

of paragraphs carefully constructed  
found its way back  

after a 7 month journey  

carrying back my own face.  

a staple  

through my eye  

my lips half parted  

words that never touched you  
scattered  

over the plowed fields of Northern France  

the envelope  

waited  

in the cubicle  

marked with the letter “L”  
a fortnight--  

the time allotted  

by the postal regulations  
of your country  

a staple  

through my eye  

I wait  

in airfields  

in train terminals  

lips half parted  
words  
screams  
laughter  

scattered
