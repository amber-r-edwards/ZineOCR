THE NEW YORK  
ATHLETIC CLUB  

An Introduction  

They build, they build.  
They swell their bodies  
at the fat sunrise. They sit  
and stand, sit and stand  
in the basement  

and feel their arms.  

Jamie “Spit” Muzler  

Well, I pump  

seven hours after work  
each night—wanta be  
in a magazine.  

My biceps grow glorious,  
my triceps are melon-like,

“Feeling good today,” they say  
when they’re going to tip us.  

Each day, we watch them trot  
around the gym. Each day,  

we see them curl their arms  
around the weights. Hugo poses  
in front of the lighted mirror,  
Claude stretches his neck.  
Afterwards, their muscles flow  
beneath our fingers; we mold them  
in contour maps of the Rockies.  
They call us “Bud”  

or “Shrimp.” It’s a job.  

The Competition  

I love to judge, to stalk  

the rows of oiled skin,  

to touch the chests which shine  

in the fluorescent light. The muscles  
stretch hard across their bellies  
when I finger them, and their navels  
wait for the blue ribbon.  

The Body Builder’s Wife (Maude)  

He just sits and twitches  

in that armchair. “Maudie,”  
he says, “It’s isometrics.” I buy  
him shirts, but he never does  
wear them. Last night,  

my daughter Joanie comes to me  
in the kitchen and says,  
“Mom, he’s flexing  

in front of my friends!”  

That man’s a bulging torture.  
He spends all his weekends  
in the cellar. Nobody  

mows the lawn.
