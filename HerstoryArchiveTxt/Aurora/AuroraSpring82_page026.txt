Bisia (1896-1981)

for my Grandmother

the plastic transparent oxygen mask

swallowed half your face
pressed into your bloated neck

ruptured your limp mouth with rhythmic gasps

morphine infant

I tried to stare into your open eyes

now each night I rip at your
oxygen mask

I tear it away and
press my mouth to your lips
I inhale your sour steam

I breathe
and wait through the dark
for your eyes to meet mine.

Maia Ettinger

for the dancing bears, again

Ask me
if I
have painted these visions.
I have not.
Each
time
we meet
you place dreams
in my hands

even letters
I can’t write
but
sleep
easier at night
knowing I am
provided for
senses overwhelmed
by your contrasts,
beauty mark on upper
lip
a voice full of
hesitations, I
lean nearer to participate.

womanmanchild,

Slowly

you teach me

to harmonize
my lives

but this is
dependency too

Must
all things in relation
divide into
the strong and
the weak,
When I leave
to
recover
my imagination
will our
words
make love
without our
tongues?
Lisa Jones
