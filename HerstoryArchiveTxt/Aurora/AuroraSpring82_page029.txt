repress the anger. Violence seemed so

natural, so emotionally charged. It was

good to vent my rage on someone like
my younger sister.”

Events such as the Incest Symposium
held last fall, are a step in the right
direction. However, there is a problem
with such academically based in-
vestigations. Valerie attended the In-
cest Symposium and commented, “It
was good, but academic. These are
very real problems—writing books and
giving lectures without doing anything
won't do any good. Programs should be
in the schools. It would have been good
for me to have some place to go, so-
meone to talk to.” Valerie thought the
suggestion of a support group on cam-
pus for victims of domestic abuse was
“a good idea,” but qualified her ap-
proval by saying that such a group
should be highly structured, profes-
sionally run, and, above all, confiden-
tial.

Valerie does not think a support
group would help her specifically,
because she has already come a long
way in trying to understand herself, her
mother, and their violent relationship.
Along with Joan and Sharon, Valerie
still thinks she has a long way to go
toward reconciling the anger, guilt, and
fear that come from being a victim of
violence. These women are
remarkable, not for what has happened
to them in the past, but for the strength
and courage they have developed in
overcoming the detrimental effects of
their violent pasts.

They attribute their progress partial-
ly to their informal network of friends.
Friends are often the first people to
whom we turn for support, yet often

— friends withdraw from us rather than
confronting complex personal pro-
blems, such as family violence.
However, as long as the official struc-
tural support mechanisms continue to
be ineffectual or underutilized, friends
will remain the principal source of sup-
port.

For this reason, domestic violence af-
fects us all. If we are not victims
ourselves, we probably know someone
who is. I abhor violence and do not
seek violent relationships. However, I
cannot say, “This will never happen to
me.” The prevalence of victims of
abuse in the Yale community illustrates
the point: this could happen to any of
us, and therefore is the concern of us

all. —e

that a person need not give up love
for work, nor work for love. “Love
and work, a union of minds and souls,
was what Rosa Luxemburg dreamed
of and struggled for during the fifteen
years of her tempestuous affair with
Leo Jogiches,” remarks Elzbieta Et-
tinger in her introduction to Comrade
and Lover, a collection of
Luxemburg’s letters to Jogiches,
edited and translated by Ettinger.
“Herself capable of both love and
work, she saw no need to give up one
for the sake of the other.” She and
Jogiches together founded the SDKP
in 1893; he continuously furnished
her with ideas for articles and
speeches, to such an extent that, as
Ettinger puts it, “in politics it is im-
possible to say where Luxemburg
started and Jogiches ended.”

At times Luxemburg expressed
weariness, a longing for a “normal”
existence, even, as she once confessed
to Jogiches, for a child. But her life
took a different course, and for the
most part, she chose it so. She never
forsook her commitment to the
socialist ideal; nor did she and
Jogiches, despite their struggles and
bitter split, give up their attachment
to each other. After her murder in
1919 by the German Freikorps, which
eventually joined Hitler's forces,
Jogiches hunted for her assassins, un-
til he too was killed, a couple of
months after her.

Luxemburg, however, remains
quite alive, if one chooses to seek her
out. There’s a vitality and a sensibility
to many of her political ideas which
could serve well in the formulation of
an ideology for the burgeoning

radicalism of our times. In the old

photographs of the Second Interna-
tional, amidst the rows of seated or
upright men, she is a shadowy figure
beneath the wide brim of a ribbon
trimmed hat. And yet she stands out.
And yet she is outstanding.
