Why do you ask,

“Why

are you so angry?”

Diana Russell is an author and
sociology professor at Mills College.
She was one of the speakers featured
during Facing Rape Week, and pre-
sented a talk entitled ‘Sexual Vio-
lence: Is it our Social Norm?” We have
provided an edited version of her
speech; she shares her findings on the
prevalence of sexual violence and its
history and persistence in our culture.
Her statistics are of extreme interest.

The government says that rape is
very rare. Feminists, on the other
hand, say that rape happens all the
time; it’s an everyday matter.

The FBI recognizes that relatively
few rapes get reported. It’s a small
percentage, nobody knows exactly
what, but we do know for sure that of-
ficial statistics are very inadequate.

What I wanted to do was to try and
settle the dispute, or at least try to
contribute to a settling of it.

I think it’s important that we recog-
nize the magnitude of the problem. If
it's 1 percent of women who get
raped versus 80 percent, or anywhere
in between, it makes a difference. It
makes a difference in terms of how
we understand the problem, and in
terms of how we tackle it.

The main aim of my study was to
find out the prevalence of rape and
other forms of sexual abuse. It in-
volved face-to-face interviews with
940 women, 18 years and older, who
were drawn at random.

This was in 1978; a time before the
legal reforms had occurred in Califor-
nia. We decided to go along with
what was the legal definition of rape
at that time, which was basically,
“forced intercourse, intercourse be-
cause of threat of physical force or
when the woman was unable to con-
sent because she was totally physi-
cally helpless in some way, such as
being unconscious, very heavily on
drugs, or something like that.” It was
completed rape and attempted rape.

The only legal difference was that
we did include rape in marriage. At
that time, rape in marriage was still le-
gal; it’s now illegal (as of January,
1980).

Basically, what we found was that
44 percent of this random sample of
women had been the victims of rape
or attempted rape at some time in
their lives. This is much higher than
the estimates that people usually
throw out. They say “there’s a one in
four chance” that a woman will be
raped at some time in her life. This is
closer to one in two.

If you take away the wife rapes,
because you want to know what it would
be if we didn’t include that, it’s 41
percent. Only 9.5 percent of these
cases were ever reported to the police.

So there’s no way in which one can
assume that those 9.5 percent that get
reported are representative of all those
rapes that do not get reported.

I see, in the sessions coming this
week, there’s some interest in
“acquaintance rape,” not just
stranger rape. In my own study, we
actually included strangers, acquain-
tances, friends of the family, friends of
the respondent, date, boyfriend,
lover or ex-lover, authority figure, rel-
ative — we distinguished all those dif-
ferent types. But, as you can imagine,
it wouldn't be easy to carry in one’s
head all these different percentages,
so let me just lump together all those
different categories as acquaintances.
Now we have strangers, acquain-
tances, husband or ex-husband, and
other relatives.

Thirty-five percent of the women in
this sample reported at least one ex-
perience of rape or attempted rape by
an acquaintance, 11 percent by a
stranger, 8 percent by a husband or
ex-husband, and 3 percent by some
other relative. I'll get into the whole
issue of other relatives later — 3 per-
cent might seem rather low to you.
It's just that, for the most part, sexual
abuse by relatives often does not in-
volve forcible rape. It involves other
levels, degrees of sexual abuse than
actually forced intercourse. That's
why there’s a lot more sexual abuse
of children going on; it doesn’t al-
ways involve force. The authority rela-
tionship is usually sufficient for the
adult to get what they want.

In terms of the husbands and ex-
husbands, I said 8 percent, but this
was in the sample. A lot of these wo-
men had never been married, so it
doesn’t make sense really to talk
about marital rape with those who
have never been married. If we just
look at the women who've been
married, then it goes up to 12 per-
cent.

The percentages are very high; they
are higher than any previous studies
have suggested, and I may say,
however, that these figures are being
supported by research that is coming
at the whole issue of rape from a totally
different angle.

Neil Malamuth, a psychologist at
UCLA, has been doing studies with a
number of his colleagues, where they
ask students about the likelihood that
they might rape somebody at
sometime in their lives.

The original study, which was done
a few years ago, used a particular
story. They never have published the
whole story, but basically what they
do is read the story (to male students)
and then they said “How likely is it
that you might act in the same way?”
And this is the story; this was based
on a small “n,” as they say, a small
sample size of 53 male students. The
story is:

“Bill soon caught up with Susan
and offered to escort her to her
car. Susan politely refused him.
Bill was enraged by the rejec-
tion. ‘Who the hell does this
bitch think she is, turning me
down?’ Bill thought to himself,
as he reached into his pocket
and took out a Swiss army knife.
With his left hand, he placed the
knife at her throat. ‘If you try to
get away, I'll cut you,’ said Bill.
Susan nodded her head, her
eyes wild with terror.”

The story then depicted the rape.
There was a description of sexual acts
with the victim continuously
portrayed as clearly opposing the as-
sault. That’s all they tell you about this
story.

After the male students had read
the rape story, they were asked whe-
ther they personally would be likely
to act as the rapist did in the same cir-
cumstances. The same question was
then repeated, this time with an as-
surance that they would not be pun-
ished.

Seventeen percent said there was
some likelihood that they would em-
ulate such behavior under the same
circumstances — 17 percent. But a
total of 51 percent responded that
they might do it if they were assured
that they would not be caught.

Of course, there’s a difference be-
tween saying there’s some likelihood
and actually doing it, and Malamuth
has been doing work for some years
to look at other correlates of this be-
havior. There have been replications
of this work at many different univer-
sities and the figure they seem to
come up with is 35 percent, on
average. Thirty-five percent of the
men say there is some likelihood of
their behaving in that fashion if they
could get away with it.

Notice, that was a stranger, or pos-
sibly acquaintance rape situation; it
didn’t make it quite clear. It was quite
clearly rape; the word ‘rape’ was
used by the experimenters.

Other research has been done by
Malamuth and some of his col-
leagues, where they don’t actually use
the word rape. For example, they ask,
“If you could be assured that no one
would know and that you could in no
way be punished for engaging in the
following acts, how likely would you
be, if at all, to commit such acts?”

The results were that 60 percent in-
