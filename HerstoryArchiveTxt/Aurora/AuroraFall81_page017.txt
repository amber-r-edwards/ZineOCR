Charlotte Perkins Gilman*  
“You must never touch a pen as long as you live.  

—Doctor S. Weir Mitchell  

Here, it is the shadows that cast light  
when we’re lucky. Here the bed  

is an ample grave, the walls  

are washed with dilute milk.  

Here is the smell of nerve-endings melting  
like thousand pearly candles  

into a quiescent pool  

the temperature of the human body.  

”  

The wax is nothing  

without the seal;  

Mud is useless  

without the prints of the hunted.  

My body is clay  

kept malleable under this wet sheet:  
I am sculpted around a womb  

It is a pomegranate  

with rubies for seeds.  

They will be plucked one  

by one  

until all that is left me  

is dying rind, the color  

of a blank page gone yellow.  

They feed us nothing  

but milk here. It makes  

our incisors come loose  

until we spit them out  

and our baby teeth resurface,  
little silly miracles,  

They lay us down gently  

like the prized fur bedspread  
my husband shot,  

its great black claws  
decorative and lethal.  

The nurses float in, translucent fish:  
you can watch their skeletons sway in the current  
through their clear, gelatinous flesh.  

We must ask permission  

to urinate. We are forbidden  

books, visitors, conversation.  

There is a reason for this:  

I myself  

tied a ragdoll to a doorknob  

and crawled through the rooms of our house,  
batting it as I crept by.  

Dr. Mitchell found me writing;  

he slammed the book like a door.  

We are not to exercise, but hands...  
massage us. Potters love clay,  

maybe the hands love me.  

But I am the Golem, the gravedigger’s lime,  

the slave’s mortar.  
I am damp as a root cellar, a stone-toothed cave  
that has dripped a hundred years.  

I have looked a softer Medusa in the eyes.

*Author of Women and Economics, and The Yellow Wallpaper,  
Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860-1935) was an activist for women’s  

Dr. S. Weir Mitchell of Philadelphia, prescribed rest and an end to in-  
tellectual activity, a “cure” that drove her to madness. She finally was  
able to overcome her depression to some degree by disregarding Mit-  
chell’s advice and separating from her husband to embark upon a full-  
time career as author, publisher, and activist.

The Third World Women’s Archives is a  
non-profit organization run entirely by  
Third World women. Its purpose is to  
further the development of a network  
of information and support for Third  
World women in the U.S. and abroad.  
The principal goal of the archives is to  
collect multilingual materials about  
and by Third World women, and cir-  
culate them among Third World  
women and other concerned in-  
dividuals and groups. These materials  
will include personal papers, printed  
materials, artwork, films, photographs,  
tapes, sheet music, and records. The ar-  
chives welcome any other materials  

Take Back the Night  
continued from page 12  

of rape of the mouth—not only with  
damage to mouth, teeth, and throat,  
but also concluding in suffocation and  
death. This information was not itself  
publicized until Andrea Dworkin  
testified at the Bare Facts trial in Hart-  
ford last year. Women possess the right  
to a life free of visual battering, verbal  
battering, and physical battering, a life  
free of laws dictating our bodies’ func-  
tions, free of the threat of nuclear  
holocaust (also known as the final rape  
of the earth), a life free to reject the  

power  
that necessitates boy escorts on the street;  

Throughout our herstories, men have  
tried to take away our freedom  
specifically because we are women.  
Because women’s communities are rare  
and we generally live with our male op-  
pressors, separated from one another,  
we do not always listen to each other  
or learn about how we hurt each other,  
much less how men constantly hurt us.  
What we as women need to do in order  
to reclaim our lives is to effect a  
change from perception of self as inno-  
cent but helpless or isolated victim to  
consciousness of ourselves as strong,  
surviving women. To this end we will  
work together as much as we can, ac-  
cept individual groups’ needs for  
autonomy, while throughout we will  
continually support each other as we  
fight to take back control of all of our  
woman-lives.  

The New Haven Take Back the Night  
Alliance confronts the preceding issues  
surrounding violence against women.  
Women from the New Haven Feminist  
Union organized in 1979 in response to  
the unsolved murders of eight black  
women in our city, and more generally,  
to the billions of violent acts  
perpetrated against us daily. Since the  
first Take Back the Night march that  
year, Connecticut marches have oc-  
curred in Middletown, at Southern CT  
State College, and yearly, as a Connec-  
ticut-wide event in New Haven.  

As an international movement, Take  
Back the Night has established itself in  
Italy, Germany, France, the  
Netherlands and many other countries.  
In 1978 American women began  
organizing, and now almost every ma-  
jor city has witnessed such a march.  
Two months ago, on the night of  
September 26, the New Haven Take  
Back the Night Alliance sponsored  
Connecticut's third annual march and  
rally. It culminated a long summer's  
worth of intense organizing by women  
from all backgrounds who shared a  
common impetus to facilitate a visible  

"and audible public statement of our  

outrage. As September came by, and  
the numbers of women drifting in and  

* out of the Alliance tended to drift more  

that may help to piece together the  
history of Third World women in the  
United States (Native Americans, Afro-  
Americans, Asian/Pacific Americans,  
and Latinas) and in Africa, Asia, and  
Latin America. The organization also  
intends to sponsor educational pro-  
jects. Any women and anti-sexist men  
can help make the archives a viable  
resource by donating or lending  
materials or by contributing time or  
money. For more information write to  
1235 Yale Station or call 773-9298 bet-  
ween 4 and 6 PM.  

Out there, the entire work and respon-  
sibility fell to a very small group of die-  
hard women. As a result of their efforts,  
the march did come off, drawing at  
least 1500 women. Supportive men  
took care of children while the women  
walked. The all-woman presence em-  
phasized one of the main points of the  
march—to remind women that we can  
look to each other for support and  
need not depend on males. Women  
rarely have the opportunity to be  
together in large numbers. Thus the ral-  
ly speeches and the bare fact of the  
march’s occurrence suggest that we can  
take a stand on an issue and start  

step in that direction, a leaflet  
handed out that night addressed the  
Alliance’s silence on the issue of sup-  
porting prostitutes. It pointed out that  
“take back the night” should stand for  
all women, including the workers in the  
sexual-servicing industry. The New  
Haven Wages for Housework Commit-  
tee, the US Prostitutes’ Collective and  
four Alliance members signed the  
leaflet. Although only four of our  
names appeared, and although various  
Alliance women disagreed with the  
politics of supporting prostitution,  
several other women in the Alliance  
would have added their names had we  
been able to contact them at the time  
the leaflet was printed.  

Several other incidents coincident  
with the night's activities remind us of  
just how much woman-hating and  
woman-fearing goes on. Towards the  
end of the rally, as our highlighted  
speaker, Ntozake Shange, climbed the  
steps of the stage to deliver her long-  
anticipated speech, water gushed from  
the sprinkler system directly beneath  
the metal stage. Not only did it cause  
untold damage to sound equipment,  
but Shange and all others on the stage
