A WALK AT DUSK

A moment arrives as you are walking  
along the street, feeling the drowsy  
voices falling in and out of talking  
as you pass their silhouettes on porches,  
when a gust of air will stir your skin  

and animate the smells of supper  

with the clamor of a kitchen,  

where onions frying in skillets spit grease  

on your upper arms, and the quick crack  

of your knife, chopping on the wooden board,  
was sharp with the smell of garlic,  

growing stale, hours later, on the tips  

of your fingers, until you walked down  

to the lake, and crushing sharp juniper  

with your thumb, camouflaged the soured  
odor of the cloves, as petals crushed now  
when you walk beneath the magnolia trees  
make the evening redolent in the houses  
after dinner, and the summer brief  

like a happiness, unprepared for,  

as if time had passed across your bare arms.

DREAM  

I see you  

sitting in the dark  

your arms flat to the arms  
of your red chair  

back pressed to slatted back  
finding in the wood  
a complementary form  

I tell myself  

not to forget  

a feeling pushed into me  
so that I wake up  
thinking I’ve lost nothing.  

Stacy Pies  

for E.D.H.  

We meet in days of change and confusion  
surfeit or shortage  
over coffee or a map  
On days when we feel no one should love us,  
we are loved;  
In times we fear we cannot love, we find,  
we love  
Caring, touching in a daily way  
Sharing the unshareable  
Admitting to each other our dreams,  
Admitting each other to our dreams.  
There’s no performance, the theater is closed—  
After everyone goes home  
Two women remain.  

Jenny Wriggins  

EXEGESIS, ONE PART  

but they themselves were as flaccid,  
white as snow and soft  

and the dreams they had  

were shameful  

because they were only dreams  

and the women became strong  
and they walked with a sure gait  
because they had to  

and the men when they saw  
they did not want this  

and the women became strong  
because they had to  
and they walked with a sure gait
