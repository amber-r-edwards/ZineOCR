‘Sharing the Truth

I can hear voices saying, “Why do
you have to tell that story?” They say
that my story is ugly. They say it is un-
important. The voices of our culture
tell us ceaselessly that we are ugly and
unimportant. Critical moments in our
lives become secrets that should be
denied, if they cannot be forgotten.

The significance of my own experi-
ence, the validity of my truth, the
power of my voice have been taken
from me. I reclaim them. I am fright-
ened. But sooner or later, I may find
that I have healed myself. And in
sharing our experiences, we may
learn that we are not alone. Other wo-
men in abusive relationships may find
new power to free themselves.

I went to Stanford. The man who
was my lover is a Stanford graduate
student. The next woman you talk to
might be me.

I was sick when I was pregnant.
Every day. All day. Part of it was fear.
Part of it was loneliness. The man who
was my lover didn’t want me to tell
anyone. And he didn’t want to see
me. I got through the day. I went
home, got into bed alone. Too sick to
eat.

The abortion cost $200. He was
going to pay half. A week before the
abortion he said he didn’t have the
money. He said he wasn’t going to
give it to me. I asked him to come and
see me. He said he was going skiing
for the weekend.

He went skiing, and I lay on my
sofa, shaking, sick, and alone. On
Sunday night I called my mother and
told her I was pregnant. She was not
angry. She was even kind. She told
me she would send me the money if I
needed it.

When my lover returned from his
skiing trip, I called him. I asked him to
give me his half of the money, be-
cause I did not have it, nor did I want
to ask my mother for it. He was angry
that I had told my mother. He said he
would give me the money, but that I
would have to come to his house and
get it.

When I got there, he told me that
he would never have let this happen
to him. He told me that I had gotten
myself pregnant on purpose. He said
it was my problem. He said it was dis-
gusting that I would beg him for
money. He wrote me a check, and I
took it and walked out of his house.

All that mattered was that soon I
would have the abortion and then I
wouldn’t be sick anymore.

The night before the abortion, I
wore an old nightgown my mother
had once given me. The man who was
my lover came over. He wanted me to
take the nightgown off and have sex
with him.

In the morning I made my bed care-
fully. My lover drove me to the clinic.
The women at the clinic had warned
me that there might be Right-to-Lifers
in the parking lot, who would try to
stop me from going into the clinic.
When we got there, though, it was
raining, and the parking lot was
deserted.

My best friend met us there. She
handed me a little flower. There was a
man sitting in the waiting room,
crying.

They took me to another waiting
room, just for the women who were
having abortions. I changed into my
bathrobe. They pricked my finger for
an Rh test. They gave me some
valium, saying it would make it easier
for me to relax on the operating table.
They told me I had about forty
minutes to wait. There were about ten
women in the room.

After a little while I began to cry.
The valium was making me dizzy, dis-
oriented, unable to see. I got up and
tried to get to the door. One of the
clinic women came to me and asked
me if I were changing my mind about
having the abortion. I told her I
wanted to see my friend. They took
me into the hall and brought my lover
and my friend. Both of them held me.
My lover said he wanted to come into
the operating room during the abor-
tion. I said no. I said I wanted my best
friend to be with me. Then it was time
to go in.

I was rigid, I couldn’t breathe. She
held my hand tightly. They adminis-
tered a local anesthetic to my cervix.
They did not wait for it to take effect.
There was a loud machine noise, aw-
ful pain, an endless, sickening jerking
of the suction tube inside my body.

Then I was alone in the special
waiting room, huddled on a sofa. I
was warm. The dizziness was gone. I
could take care of myself. I could
drink cups and cups of the orange
juice they gave me, I could eat dozens
of their chocolate chip cookies. I had
to stay there for at least an hour,
checking every fifteen minutes on my
bleeding. There was nothing but this
warm room, these kind women.

When I was home, alone, I made
myself a big pot of soup. A friend
called, someone I hadn’t talked to in
weeks. “Hi,” I said. “Guess where I
just was?”

A couple of weeks later, my lover
and I split up for good. He never
stopped blaming me. He was angry
that I hadn’t wanted him with me in
the abortion room. He told one of our
friends that I was evil for having an
abortion. We were never able to
resolve it between us.

A couple of days after that I had to
go back to the clinic for a follow-up
exam. During the exam I started to
cry. “What's the matter?” asked the
nurse practitioner. “My lover left
me,” I said. “It often happens,” she
said. “I’m sorry. If there is anything
we can do...”

I drove home, alone.

CONVERSATION —’83

She damns the three-legged creatures
who make up the other in life.

She has become so proficient at
playing their game, yet doesn’t know
why.
Her well-trained tongue submits to
their demands — always.

(This politeness appears to be gender
specific.)
She asks questions designed to relieve
a frished
boasting, and silently pities herself for
the torture of his monotonous rambl-
ings.

She listens to the man, the men.

She feigns interest in their stories,
their lives, their mere existence.

Through her polite attentiveness she
gives them reassurance, comfort, a
sense of self-worth.

And they are foolish enough to be-
lieve her; they think that she really lis-
tens, that she cares.

But if she could stop the acting just
once and ask the boy, man, male,
egotist, “What do you give me in return
for this sacrifice?” he would probably
remain speechless.

She knows now that there is no recip-
rocity of interest since this compliance
has always been expected of her.

(She sighs as she thinks of the few
males and those rare moments when she
does not feel compelled to act.)

But then she remembers what she has
received in return.

Often her dutiful interest has caused
such satisfaction and relief for the male
ego that he “naturally” assumes she is
also interested in his body (i.e. his cock).

She becomes the target for lewd sex-
ual propositions and verbal, even physi-
cal, harassment.

Politeness has reduced her to an ob-
ject, a permanent source of

She learns.
She fears.
And they wonder why I do not smile
at them much anymore.
