Alice Walker: “Surely the earth can be saved”

by Anne Semans

Pulitzer-prize winning author Alice  
Walker mourned man’s destruction of  
the earth before an overflow crowd of  
about 400 people on Tuesday, Nov.  
15, at University of Santa Clara’s  
Mayer Theater.

Walker, famous for her novel The  
Color Purple, spent most of the eve-  
ning reading an unpublished essay  
which began with an account of her  
“intense dialogue with the trees.”

She described the trees as having  
huge gnarled roots and limbs resem-  
bling those of rheumatoid people.  
The trees did not want her lying in  
their shade because she belonged to  
the species that had polluted their  
growth and abused their existence,  
she said.

She pleaded innocence to their  
charges but learned that “being an in-  
dividual doesn’t matter to trees. Just  
as all trees are one to human beings —  
all human beings are one to trees.”  
She said she sadly realized that “we  
are judged by our worst collective be-  
havior.”

She attributed this behavior to a  
fear of nature. She described an inci-  
dent in which she killed a snake out of  
fear and concluded that “all fear of  
natural things leads to fear of our-  
selves.”

It is this fear which has caused  
humans to abuse the land, she said.

Walker compared America to a  
spoiled boy for not “acknowledging  
the fathers before the fathers it  
created.” She praised America’s real  
parents, the Native Americans, be-  
cause unlike our “founding fathers,”  
they “made love to the land without  
raping or defiling it.”

According to Walker, while the In-  
dians may have fought each other, as  
guardians of the land “they did not  
fight against mother earth. The  
land can exist without the country,  
but the country cannot exist without  
the land.”

Walker asked the audience to focus  
their energies on how to restore the  
earth to its dignity as a living being,  
and ended her essay by suggesting a  
“rule for permissible murder.”

“Beyond feeding, clothing, and shel-  
tering ourselves, human beings should  
not be allowed to destroy what we  
cannot recreate,” she said. “This  
means spiders and snakes, our wil-  
derness, and ourselves.”

Walker concluded the evening with  
a moving reading of what she referred  
to as “my anti-nuclear poem.” Each  
stanza in the poem was dedicated to  
and descriptive of her relationship  
with a special person in her life, and  
ended with her sadly questioning,  
“Surely the earth can be saved for  
them?”

The silence in the room following  
her reading was an accurate measure  
of the effect Alice Walker's writing  
has on her public. Her style is so per-  
sonal, low-key, and subtly  
humorous, that it is impossible to  
read or listen to her without identify-  
ing with her experiences and sharing  
her emotional concern.

Through her creativity she awakens  
her audience to the serious issues  
surrounding us in an inspirational and  
touching manner, while re-  
establishing her own ties to nature,  
the spirit, and the joys of simply  
living.

The standing ovation she received  
upon her departure was a uniting and  
effective finish to an insightful eve-  
ning. Her writing provided us with the  
hope that one day “our children may  
walk the good road to the day of  
quiet.”

Alice Walker's latest book, “In Search  
Of Our Mother’s Gardens” (a collec-  
tion of nonfiction), as well as her  
prize-winning novel “The Color  
Purple,” are available at the Stanford  
Bookstore.

was contemptuous and hostile. A wo-  
man who insisted there is no such  
thing as oppression. A woman who  
preferred pretending she has no  
anger or venting it on another woman  
to letting the boys see it. Which  
proves that although she prefers to  
remain unaware, she knows quite  
well the penalties for expressing such  
anger.

Now what? I ask that coach who is  
as voiceless as we had been during  
the whole meet. I say to both teams,  
please, let’s mix navy and peach tricks  
into routines from now on, and let’s  
allow peach as well as navy chips to  
count.

We all reach toward the immense  
brilliant-violet sky.

I ask questions

across this amber campus

red tiles and raccoon eyes of fall  
coming to our senses

our East Coast consciousness  
against palm trees we stop  
listening leaning towards the moon  
student bicycles and sprinklers hiss  
even in the rain you won't talk

for more than a minute I’m lost

in silence

beige brick corridors

beckoning becoming words to you.

about who they are. The assumptions  
that let the programmer automatically  
cast me as helpless and himself as  
hero, who may choose to help (if I am  
submissive enough). (Maybe it was  
one of the hero’s mistakes in the pro-  
gram that made it crash in the first  
place.) The assumptions that come to  
us from the patriarchy — our society,  
in which identity derives from the  
male line. Patriarchy tells us the rules.  
Patriarchy tells us its terms for our  
survival. Patriarchy tells the men they  
are heroes. And it tells us who we are.

This is the awful truth: We need to  
change the way our identities are  
defined. When I am sure that my  
identity rests solely and absolutely  
with my own being, and that it has an  
inherent integrity, then I am secure  
enough to cease defining myself in  
patriarchal terms. My gender, for in-  
stance, becomes just one aspect of  
my individuality. There is a visible  
change. I make my own definitions. I  
create myself. I am powerful!

I sure as hell don’t need a hero.
