AURORA  

FEMINIST  

RELIES ON V  

The shortage of women faculty at Stan-  
ford has been a depressing phenomenon.  
Recently, however, two new women have  
joined the university community. Visiting  
professors Barrie Thorne and Jane Flax are  
teaching courses in the Feminist Studies  
Program this fall and throughout the year.  

Barrie Thorne is an Associate Professor  
of Sociology at Michigan State University,  
where she was one of the founders of its  
Women’s Studies Program. She specializes  
in issues of language and gender. This fall  
she is teaching a course on the situation of  
women in society. Professor Thorne will  
teach four other courses this year, con-  
tinue her research on gender arrange-  
ments in elementary schools and be a fa-  
culty resident in Florence Moore Hall.  
Thorne was an undergraduate at Stanford  
fifteen years ago. At that time, she has said,  
she had only two women professors, and  
was hungry for what we now call “role  
models.” Her presence here as a feminist  
professor helps to fulfill that same, ever-  
present need today.  

Jane Flax is an Associate Professor of  
Political Science at Howard University. She  
is now teaching a course in Feminist  
Theory. Flax specializes in 19th and 20th  
century political theory. This winter quar-

Feminism and Psychoanalysis. Flax finds

understanding the dynamics of mother/  
daughter relations. The examination of  
these relations is an important aspect of  
Flax’s analysis of the woman’s movement.  
Professor Flax will no doubt provide an in-  
teresting feminist critique of political  
theory and traditional psychoanalysis to  
those who take her classes.  

We welcome these women to our com-

The National Day of Unity Against  
Domestic Violence will be celebrated on  
October 16, 1982 at Rengstorff Park in  
Mountain View from 10 a.m. - 5 p.m.  

The purpose of the National Day of Unity  
is to draw attention nationwide to the  
magnitude of the problem of domestic vio-  
lence and the work that is being done to  
end it. In this community, the Mid-  
Peninsula Support Network for Battered  
Women provides direct services to victims  
including shelter, counseling and legal ad-  
vocacy, and works with law enforcement  
and other community agencies to prevent  
domestic violence.
