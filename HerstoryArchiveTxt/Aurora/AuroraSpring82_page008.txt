‘Catherine Liu.

I went home in February because
my grandmother in China had just
died, and I wanted to be with my
family and also because I had grown
a bit heartsick here at school. Her
death, I am beginning to understand,
was a direct reminder to me of things
I had forgotten or had let fall into the
background of my life at college. I
did not feel sorrow so much as simply
a painful fullness of soul.

I did not know her well and when
my father tried to explain her life to
me, he called her a ‘typical Chinese
woman of her generation.’ I have
begun to piece together what exactly
that means and also to put my own
life in the context of it. I think she was
simple, ignorant, long-suffering and
had a certain wisdom and warmth

about her. The first time we went
back to my father’s ancestral village
in Shantung province, she and my
grandfather stood waiting for us on
the outskirts of the hamlet where the
government-owned minibus let us off.
I remember her as being a small
woman wearing a white bib with a
high mandarin collar, sparse grey hair
pulled back in a bun and a wrinkled,
high cheek-boned face. She also had
the smallest feet I had ever seen. As I
look at my hands now, I realize her
feet were about the length of my
hands. She hobbled about busily on
those very feet, in the courtyard of
my father’s house, which is perhaps as
old as the American republic. The
house is a traditional Chinese house:
three low, rectangular buildings and a
fourth wall enclosing a courtyard in
which there is enough room for a
small plot of vegetables, a pigsty and
a few geese and chickens to wander
about in. It is made of packed yellow
earth, said to have uncommon heal-
ing powers, indigenous to Northern
China, especially the Yellow River
Basin. I think she was overjoyed to
have her grown son from America
bring home to her his wife and
children. I think this made her happy.

My father finally told me
something of her life when I was
home in February. Her own mother
died when she was nine and her father
neglected her. So my grandmother
became very docile and obedient, a
model daughter, hoping to win some-
one’s love and approval. She bound
her feet tighter than anyone else’s. I
believe she was successful in the bin-
ding of her feet but I am not so sure
about the other part. I remember

Chinese daughter. And this I tried for
many years of my life. I was quiet, in-
dustrious, hardworking and responsi-
ble. It was hard for me because all
these things go against my grain, and
though I would never have admitted
it in the past, it made me very, very
angry that I had to be that way for so-
meone to love me. Chinese women
have always been taught to be self-
effacing and self-sacrificing. Luckily
for me, I gave up this stupid game
when I saw that it wasn’t really get-
ting me anywhere: no one loved me
any better and I hated the person I
was trying to be. z

However, my grandmother, and in
many ways my mother, had no choice
but to be docile and silently sub-
missive. My grandparents’ marriage
was arranged by their parents as all
such affairs were then. I am sure my
grandmother dutifully complied
without question or protest. My

2 had been for

who had no education and led

grandmother bore her husband nine
children, three of whom died at an
early age. Of the six that survived,
two were sons and four were
daughters. I think my grandfather was
a very angry man, angry because he

sophistication of any sort. He was a
relatively learned man in this
backward village, and he had hoped
for a better match. So he was angry at
her and at her children. He once
brought a mistress home to my grand-
mother and made her cook them din-
ner. Yet my father tells me that with
people outside of the family he was
always a great joker, generous and
congenial. Thus the repression of
women in feudal Chinese society and
the absurd structure of the relation-
ship between men and women caused
a great deal of pain and suffering for
both sexes.

We brought my grandmother to
Peking with us one summer. It was the
farthest she had ever been outside of
her village. We visited the famous
landmarks of the capital, the Forbid-
den City, Tien An Men Square, the
Temple of Heaven, the Summer
Palace. My grandmother had to lean

sacrificed herself for her family and
husband.

The tragedy of the Chinese woman
is written in the lives of all women of
my grandmother’s generation and

on me a great deal of the time
because she couldn't walk very far on
her lotus-shaped feet, an archaic sym-
bol of beauty, to me a cruel perversity. In both the Forbidden City and the
Summer Palace a certain lesson in
history is emphasized: the wanton ex-
travagance and cruelty of the Em-
press Dowager who, with her self-
indulgent taste for luxury, built
elaborate pavilions and halls
dedicated to herself. In the Summer
Palace, a dreamy retreat outside of
Peking built for the pleasure of the
Emperors of the Manchu dynasty, she
ordered the building of a huge two-
tiered marble boat decorated with
stained glass. It was moored forever
but gave one the illusion of being on
the water when one got on it. She got
seasick and couldn’t take out real
boats but wanted to achieve the feel-
ing of being out on the water. The
money she used to build the marble
vessel was originally intended to be
used to build a Chinese navy, to de-
fend the country against menacing
foreign powers. She also imprisoned
the Heir Apparent and forced his
young fiancée to commit suicide. I
was taken aback by her cruelty and
selfishness, for these embodied all that
women were not supposed to be.
She has become one of the most despis-
ed figures in Chinese history and yet I
have always felt a certain amount of
morbid fascination for her and for
other dark women in history. Being
evil was the only means of really
distinguishing oneself as a woman. The
Empress Dowager was not a typical
Chinese woman and yet her tragedy
was caused by the same feudal struc-
tures which enslaved my grand-
mother.

I came back to Yale with the
taste of it in my mouth again, a taste
I had forgotten here. It leads me to
muse about the nature of my own life
now. So I have learned to manipulate
language, to exist in a world of men
without effacing my own identity, to
speak rather than be silent, to think
rather than shy away from thinking
and to assert my views and my sex-
uality. As a Chinese woman I am a
failure. In traditional China I would
probably be a huge disgrace, and
would have lost face for my entire
family. In fact, I would probably be
regarded as a freak, a “she-devil.” I
talk back and wear my hair loose. But
I feel my grandmother's experience
strongly. It is a part of me I cannot
dismiss and I am glad to remember.
