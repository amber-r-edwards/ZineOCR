SPRING FEVER

At the wood’s edge trillium shows

mauve petals in three,
blood-root fragile white —

than seek the early rise
my self rides up and
teased from steurposes

ladies massing in their dress

blue and white, the common pinks
ignorant of their family’s Latin title.

Empty-handed, given to pastoral,

by night I ride back to my lover's bed,
trailing names of flowers from the woods.

COBWEBS

Not here, mother

not here in the cold November room

keeps your memory warm

Is it in the middle of the room
legs crossed
eyes closed

mantra fitting over my head
like a skip

trying to connect

that little black ball
throbbing behind my tongue
that black center of what I am
to something I should be
want to be

but over and over I see

that part of me

that is me

returning to you, mother

I see dark spaces

intersected with tiny grains of light
like cobwebs spinning

the shape of themselves

in dawn’s dewlight

I see myself

crawling in the dark spaces

of our white street house

dustcloth dragging cobwebs

down the dark steps

to the cold dark cellar

and under the cellar stairs

fearing to go

where cobwebs multiply into monsters
and great grey boogeymen spin webs
to trap little girls

where the robber with a ski cap
hiding his head

hid

and reached out a cold white hand
grabbing my ankle

as I yelled up the stairs

where grandpa’s soul

was hiding

waiting in the dust

to rise up the back stairs

and rest under my bed

So I hold my breath

and reach into the dark

as far as I can go

gathering bouquets to please you, mother
little girl cradling cobwebs

in the belly of the dustcloth

pleasing you with a dustcloth

full of nothing

And I know now

the further I move away from you, mother
the closer I’m drawn to you

the thin thread drawn taut

between us

like the filament

of fine spider’s web

filling the south window

with its delicate destruction.
