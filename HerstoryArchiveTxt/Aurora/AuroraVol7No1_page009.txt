Anita, Paul and I

by Beth Cohen

“I want to write a story about my
son, Paul, growing up,” I said. “I have
come to school a few minutes early to
pick him up today.”

“Is it big?” the one in blue jeans
asked, “Is it bigger than this peanut
that I am holding between my fingers
for you to see? Is it bigger than the
swing-set in the snow-covered
schoolyard outside the window?”

“It is oh so much bigger than that
little nut there,” “It” said. “But it is
smaller than that swing-set I see out
the window. I see Amy on the swings
and the snowflakes are falling on her
hair and black eyelashes. I love Amy.”

“What color is it?” the billowy
whorled blondie asked. “Is it pink? Is
it white? I had a birthday cake a week
or a month ago. It was pink and
white.”

“No, it is not pink. It is not white,”
“It” said. “You will never guess. You
have asked more than ten questions
already.”

“One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten fingers have
I,” the one whose eyes were dark
black circles said.

“We forgot! We forgot!” the bil-
lowy whorled blondie said. “Is it an
animal, a vegetable, or a mineral? I
wonder what a mineral is.”

“You lose! You lose!” “It” said. “It
is not any of these things.”

“It's not playing fair, I see. I see
that he is cheating,” the one in blue
jeans said.

“I don't want to cheat for somehow
my mama will find out. I will put a pin
in Paul’s balloon as he thwack thumps
it into the air and it will no longer be
anything. It is not animal, vegetable,
or mineral. Truly. It is an abstraction,”
“It” said. “Do you give up?”

“What is it? Tell us! Oh, do tell us!”

“I’ve won! Wait until I tell Dad. I’ll
say what it is now,” “It” said. “It is
the balloon that Paul was playing
with. It popped. Or I popped it. It
isn't animal, vegetable, or mineral
now. It isn't anything.”

“I am standing in the door of a
classroom,” I said. “I am Paul Casey's
mom. I am here to pick up my son. He
is only three and a half years old. He
cannot understand such abstract
ideas as these children can.”

“We are all five to seven. Except
Paul who is only three and a half. I am
six, Gena is five, Laurence is seven,”
the winner said. “Jim kissed Amy
today so he couldn’t play. I was ‘It.’”

“Now I see a little boy about the
size of a three and a half year old sit-
ting a bit off to the side of this group.
He and the billowy whorled blondie
are playing peekaboo. His eyes are
dark black circles, his hair is cornsilk.
I deduce that it is Paul. You look at me
angrily and then kiss me stiffly, oblig-
ingly,” I said.

“I have just stopped wearing
diapers and I am only in nursery
school, but I am beginning to under-
stand about abstractions,” Paul said.
“You are picking me up from school
as if nothing has happened, and that
gives me a stomach-ache.”

“Now we pick up your peacoat. It is
navy blue, and your boots are yellow.
They make me feel warm,” I said.

“Now we go out into the snow,” I said.

“ I learned that when some things
go away they don’t come back. How
was I to know that you would come
back to pick me up today?” Paul
asked. “My red balloon is nowhere to
be found. It gave me quite a fright and
then I could not find it.”

“When I go into my study to write I
always come out again,” I said. “I
come out and I kiss Paul goodnight.
We slide into the grocery store in our
loafers and yellow boots.”

“We are in the food house again,”
Paul said.

“We are in the store going up and
down the aisles,” I said. “All the
check-out lines are tremendously
long, but this one will do. On that t.v.
monitor screen I see a woman
wearing a red bandana tied like a hair
band and a wide blue skirt with that
white embroidery at the hem...” I said, “who is also in a check-out
line,” I said. “On her shoulder there
is a leather bag. In her cart’s basket
sits a patient blonde boy. I see the
back of his head.”

“I see Mama,” Paul said. “I see a
little boy behind her who pulls
his hand toward her. It is dirty and
must have been playing in his sand box. He has one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight fingers.”

“Look at that man behind her,” I
said. “He looks sadly hungry and
scared as he reaches his hand out
toward the woman. Oh! He is going
to pick-pocket her purse right here in
one of these lines. I am looking
around to locate him in person. I look
on with horror as the face on the man
behind me starts to turn Indian rubber
red and his chapped hand flashes
back into his filthy pocket. You were
going to steal from ME!”

“The man behind Mama has moved
his hand very, very quickly,” Paul
said. “Now he touches the top of his
pocket. Now his hand has disap-
peared. It comes back with red and
blue candy in it. He is a nice man. I
want some of the candy that he has in
his hand. He has one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
fingers now, and one, two, three red
and green candies.

“Now we go out into the snow,” I said.

my deepest fears
most intimate joys
remained locked within me

my energy consumed daily
avoiding the sharks which
threatened our conversations
taboo words
“feminist”
“ERA”
“gender-sensitive”
“sexist”

eventually my soul claimed freedom
I flew to her
who could know
who would know me
and not be threatened

my old lover
shook his head
and claimed no one could understand

“The candy disappears when I
his hand touches his mouth. Now I think
of the red balloon. I played with it. I
hit it up in the air, thwack, thump,
thwack, thump. BANG! It quickly
made me close my eyes and cry and
when I stopped and I was only making
birdie chirp loud breaths I couldn't
find my balloon.”

“Mister, I watched you on the
screen,” I said. “You were reaching
into this purse here for this wallet.
Now I am writing my grocery check
with shaky hands. Now I am signing
my name, ‘Anita Casey.’ Do you rec-
ognize it? I shall call you Criminal. I
am called Anita Casey. Now I turn

“‘not’ seem to
recognize my face. I am surprised.

“The grocery bagger has all my
groceries in paper sacks and has filled
my cart with them. I am pushing the
cart out to the parking lot and the
snow comes down. It is absolutely
amazing. You were not going to pick-
pocket Anita Casey. You were going
to pick-pocket me.”

“It was like this before when we
were by the cars in this parking lot,”
Paul said. “It only snows where the
parking lot and the cars are. I was
crying before in the snow and I could
cry now. Snow hurts.”

“It is cold,” I said. “I feel cold.”

“Look over there. It also snows on
birds. Look over here, it snows on
hands,” Paul said. “It snows on hands
and then quickly I can’t see the
snowflakes.”

“Now I lift Paul out of the cart and
touch his hand. It is warm,” I said. “I
am cold.”

“Snow is cold,” said Paul. “Cold
