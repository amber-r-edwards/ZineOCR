October 14, 1982 AURORA 4

MEW

The experience of Stanford as described in ‘Approaching Stanford” is a male
experience. We assert that women’s experience, though diverse according to race,
class, age and physical ability, is one of oppression and violation.

Women at Stanford are violated:

every time a pornographic movie shows on campus:

every time a man writes a degrading comment on a bathroom wall

every time a stranger or friend forces a woman to have sex

every time a professor, employer, or colleague sexually harasses a woman, and
again when she finds no recourse in the University because of the inadequacies
of the administration’s sexual harassment policy

every time a woman feels uncomfortable or unable to speak in a classroom, dorm,
or Coffee House discussion

every time a woman’s scholarship is denied

every time women suffer invisibility while men and men’s “achievements” are the
standard

We intend this issue of Aurora to give voice to, and to voice again, women’s
experiences at Stanford.
