The quilt squares depicted on this cover are from the Women in Struggle Quilt, which was created by 46 women to depict the struggles and organizing efforts of wo-  
men internationally. The quilt was completed in quilting bees in early 1983 and has spread lovingly on walls and out on floors at many battered women’s shelters and,  
since travelled throughout Europe; It was shown in the women’s space at the International Peace Conference in Prague, Czechoslovakia, hung between the  
2nd anniversary of the women’s peace camp at Greenham Common, England, and  
women’s centers in England, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, and Denmark. Aa
