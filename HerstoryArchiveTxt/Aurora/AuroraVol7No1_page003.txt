Speak Unseen Bane Things

My gymnastics team wears peach
leotards — actually they range from
pale to brilliant and some of them are
closer to a violet or a navy than a
peach. These gymnasts are just as
much team members as are those in
the palest peach. You better believe
it. There is another team which works
out in the gymnasium next door to
ours, and they wear navy leotards. For
as long as I can remember, both of
our teams have had navy coaches.

This morning the navies asked us to
come over to their gym for a rendez-
vous. We had expected an exhibition,
but when we arrived, we found out
that it was to be a competition. Navy
judges watched as first Nina got up on
the balance beam and danced and
tumbled more perfectly than she ever
had. She scored high in the nines,
and for each of those points she was
given a peach colored chip. A navy
gymnast followed, and did a very dif-
ferent sort of routine than Nina had
done; the tricks were different, the
whole style was different. The judges
liked the routine and doled out nine
and a half navy colored chips to that
gymnast. After a few more routines
from each team, we realized that we
had been taught a very different gym-
nastics than they had.

Nina got hungry and went to buy
something from the snackbar that the
navy team had set up, and when she
came back to us she was angry. What
happened? And, what do you mean?
That's not fair. Or, let’s protest! It
turned out that the navies who were
running the snack bar had told her
that peach chips couldn’t buy anything
there. Only navy chips counted.

When we were all hungry we care-
fully watched the navies to see how
we could win their chips. I was ner-
vous when the judge signaled for me
to start my routine, but I got up on the
balance beam and tried to imitate the
style of the navies, giving up beauti-
fully rounded arms, muting my dance
steps. I scored two navy chips. When
my adrenaline stopped flowing, I

Ridiculous. . .

I am a political definition.

How do you see who I am? 

Depth.
I am not thingliness.

Can you hear me?

So you can grasp. . .?
Dis eC

Not a person.
Let’s figure out what’s going on. . .

And so we begin constructing new ideas of who we are
And how to touch each other.

I and I have been good friends for
ten years. We went to high school to-
gether here in Palo Alto; we both
went to Stanford. Now we both work
for the same company in Silicon Val-
ley. A couple of weeks ago we were
sitting in The Lotus Inn waiting for
some lemon chicken, and I started
telling her about something that hap-
pened at work that morning.

“I was using an experimental pro-
gram and my computer trashed itself.
I needed to get some help from a
programmer to save some files. I
asked one of them if he had time to
help me, and he said ‘Sure, I always
have time to help a damsel in
distress.’ I guess I didn’t look
amused, because he looked me up

and down and said, ‘You’re not a

feminist, are you? If you think that’s a
sexist remark, I’m not going to help
you.’

What really got me, I told L, was
that later on I told another woman
about it, and she couldn’t understand
why I was pissed off. I tried to explain
to the woman that I didn’t appreciate
the programmer's defining me as a
helpless idiot when I approached him
with a technical problem. (Notice that
that lets him define himself as the

Was it me or was it because I’m a woman?
It is essential to break into the understanding that

When I define myself as a woman,
Does my political language mean anything to you?

My questions do not represent reactions

Echoing inside a self-constructed shell.
They do not escape as distortions mimicking esoteric confusion.

I am not walls defining hollowness.
Please allow me to share myself with you.
Do you know how to appreciate that the last thing I want to do

Is to divorce myself from my woman-identity
And chop my world into what you think is a digestible piece

hero.) But the woman still didn’t un-
derstand. “It wasn’t meant to be an
insult,’ she said. I pointed out to her
that “Feel the Velvet’ wasn’t meant to
be an insult either. That it is the un-
derlying assumption that hurts us.
“It’s not the same thing,” she said. 

“Well, I understand,” said I. “And I
don’t want to hear any more about it.
I work with five other engineers —
and I’m the only woman in the group. 
They make jokes about my being the
token. And the rest of the time they
make jokes about how stupid the
secretaries are. If I start thinking
about this stuff and getting pissed off,
I won’t be able to handle my job
anymore.” 

“I seem to be handling my job OK,”
I said. 

“I have plans for my career,” she
said angrily. “You don’t.”

“Are you kidding?” I said. The
waiter brought the lemon chicken. 
We looked at it. 

“I don’t want to talk about it,” said
my friend. We ate in silence.

I went home frustrated and still
angry. In one day I had encountered
practically the whole range of
responses to feminism. A man who

(Continued, p. 4)

Why can’t I walk past you without
feeling myself undressed by your
stare?

Why do you throw bottles and gar-
bage at women who walk in solidarity
in a “Take Back the Night” march?

Why do you blare your car horn and
frighten me, jarring my once peaceful
run?

Why did my sister quit her job, rather
than face the incessant harassment
from her boss?

Why do my friends starve themselves
to meet your exacting standards of
“beauty”?

Why do you think I'm “uptight” when
I don’t laugh at your misogynist jokes?

Why can’t I express my feminist ideas
to you and be taken seriously?

Feminism, a way of thinking and living
that I found during my first years at
Stanford, has opened my eyes, has ar-
ticulated and strengthened my under-
standing of what it means to be a wo-
man in our society.

The questions I present here are but a
few of those that plague my mind dai-
ly. They are a part of my experience as
a woman. I don’t want them to be a
part of my experience. Injustice is not
a strong enough word to describe the
situation as I have felt and understood
it. I write for Aurora with the hope
that many others will think about such
questions and seriously consider
what they mean for themselves and
for all women.

I want answers to these questions.
Honest answers. I want to hear you
and to understand you. I want you to
hear me and understand me. I want
you to know how very critical these
and other questions like them are.
