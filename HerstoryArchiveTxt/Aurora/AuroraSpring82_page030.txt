Archives, run by a group of Latina,
Asian, Afro-American, and Native

such as personal papers, letters and
diaries, photographs, tapes, films, un-
published manuscripts, articles, books,
journals, newspapers, flyers and
posters, artwork in general, sheet
music, records, and any other
documents that will facilitate our
development of a network of informa-
tion and support for, by, and about

Third World Women in the U.S. and abroad.

We have made the collection and
preservation of these multi-cultural
materials a political priority. Shared
