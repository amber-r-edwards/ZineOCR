HISTORY OF WOMEN AT YALE  
continued from page 6  
In the course of the past decade,  
women’s presence on campus in large  
numbers has changed Yale in many  

ways. But the attitude that many  

people who favor Coeducation and give  
it the glowing notices I mentioned in the  
introduction to this article take the view  
that women are privileged to attend this  
institution, and that their presence here  
enhances the University’s atmosphere.  
It is difficult to quarrel with these  
statements on a factual level, but we  
must take issue with the premise on  
which they are based. It is not only  
because of the university’s magnanimity  
that women are here at Yale - it is  
because we merit being here. And  
though the social atmosphere may be  
more healthy now that the student body  
is coed, that has little to do with our  
reasons for being here. We come, as  
women have come to Yale throughout  
history, as students, wanting both to  
receive and to give; to learn about the  
accumulated knowledge of the ages and  
to temper it with our own perceptions  
and those of our fellow women. It is  
imperative that we not abandon our own  
vision in our eagerness to understand  
the majority opinions presented to us as  
facts. It is essential that we act within  
this university, as outside its confines,  
not as mere receptacles of culture but  
as its creators. Communication and  
exchange of perceptions are fundamental  
to the academic project, and women

since held that in fact his limerick  
supported the proposal that women be  
admitted to the college. Perhaps he did  
not oppose their presence on campus  
but the verse implies that he expected  
their presence to enhance the social/  
sexual scene on campus rather than to  
contribute to the intellectual atmos-

“M * Gentlemen  

For Gender Justice”  

By Dinah PoKempner  

The same three adjectives that come  
to mind vis-a-vis the Men’s Movement  
seem apt to describe its first national  
journal: young, fragmentary and, as  
Conrad Birdie would say, “sincere.”  
The premiere issue of “M.-Gentle Men  
for Gender Justice,” despite its cloying  
title, shows promise of outgrowing all  
three.  

The magazine was born during an  
interim meeting of the National Confer-  
ence of Men and Masculinity for the  
purpose of establishing a permanent  
national organization. A group of men  
devoted their energy at the Madison WI  
meeting to creating a national organ for  
“exchanging information and nourishing  
a larger men’s community.” The first  
issue of “M.” was hastily assembled  
over the summer to come out in time for  
the sixth National Conference, and  
consequently is a simply designed,  
slender volume that relies on previously  
published work for three of its seven  
articles.  

The articles themselves vary in tone  
and philosophy from collective manifes-  
to to apologetic testimonials to hard-  
nosed political essays. A page entitled  
“No More Silence about Violence”  
features a jargoned diatribe against  
militarism by a Massachusetts group,  
Men Against Patriarchy, alongside of a  
straight-forward piece of journalism  
describing the Los Angeles Men’s  
Collective protest against the exploita-  
tive advertising for Paramount Pictures’  
recent movie, Bloodline. A fine article  
by Sam Julty, author of Men’s Bodies,

support the ERA from self-interest runs  
with an article on rape that exhorts its  
readers that “every man is a potential  
rapist/killer to every woman.” Self-  
interest vs. self-deprecation, objective  
reporting vs. subjective testimony, per-  
sonal vs. political experience - such are  
the divisions and different directions in  
the Men’s Movement. The similar  
diversity of “M.’s” contents make it  
uneven but illuminating reading for the  
outsider - a claim few other Movement  
publications can make. The issue also  
features poetry (largely ideological  
statements written vertically), reviews,  
and an invaluable nationwide directory  
of men’s groups and publications. The  
eclectic contents and national distribu-  
tion of the contributors bode well for the  
magazine’s future. Upcoming articles  
will include an interview with Marilyn  
French, author of The Women’s Room,  
pieces on single fathers, the Gay Rights  
struggle, reports on the seventh Nation-  
al Conference on Men and Masculinity.  
This reader hopes that as the magazine  
matures it does not ossify, but rather  
continues to cultivate the ideological  
open-mindedness that characterizes the  
first issue.
