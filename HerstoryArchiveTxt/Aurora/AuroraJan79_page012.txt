(Yun-meng. At Kao-t’ang Pavilion in Yun-meng  
Marsh, the king Hsiang was visited by the goddess of  
Wu Mountain, who shared with him pillow and mat.  
Yun-meng means, literally, Cloud Dream. Here the  
king wakes, one of the mornings of the rest of his life,  
and remembers):

first light, the birds crossed over  

their chatter surrounded the place where I lay  
birds black across the window against blue sky  
crying, birds, wings closed to straight bodies  
stretched out sudden  

closed again thin straight as if they’d fall birds  
swarming like bats at evening crying  

crossed at first light to the reed fields.  

by the mountain i  
there must be cries now  

as birds fly, settle in mist along the river  
the mountain  

must be touched with light now  

as at evening it alone; the last stands rosy  
grey dawn  

there was  

ago  

and from the mountain she |  

lightly touching  

in mist that comes first chill  

the back  

of my neck, moving over my ears  

chill mist, and in the mat warmth  

her body rolling  

on mine amid the mist Cloud  

Dream Marsh.  

marsh. a pavilion amid the reeds  
and autumn waters. clouds, I woke to rain falling  
torrents off the roof, it was the echo  
of rivers among the mountains, wind,  
carts fleeing along the roads, music,  
it — and my eyes opened  

like I had come she was gone  
rain  

in atone {  

lady, rain, on all things equal  

not only me, it fell on trees  

stripped them of leaves, rolled off the bare ground  
rain on the reed flowers  

pattering, swelling the grey expanse  

far as the eye could see  

of autumn floods.

now, dawn again  

comes westward breaks  

over the mountain flows  
light into shadow through gold foaming leaves  
morning now, and the black birds fly again  
crying, straight quick down  
into the reeds.  

(Epilogue)  

King, be released now and go on your journey  
following your horse’s feet, a thousand miles  
or mount the wind that blows now, through your opened  
go out, make all things whole.  

King, in the rear palace many ladies  

hearing the rainfall end, roll up pearl blinds  

look out, to yet another dawn  

which follows night  

yet another night when the lute sat idle  

when no man came and they stared out  

fearing that the silver in their cloudlike autumn hair  
was not, any longer, the moon.

(There is a story that the moon was once dark and  
ugly. One day he saw a beautiful girl, loved her, and  
wished that she might come to him so that his face  
could shine with her beauty and be loved. The girl  
disappeared from her family and friends, and this is  
her story of):  

HOW THE MOON BECAME BEAUTIFUL  

The moon is looking for a woman  

Each night his blonde beard scratches at my window  
His long hair hangs over the earth  

He is looking for a woman  

Look at the moon  

Shadow, you are looking at me  

Look at the lop-sided brightly shining moon  

I am promised to the moon  

Waning from the sky, he waits darkened on the balcony  

At my touch his limbs twine soft and white they're moonlight  
His long hair hangs over the earth  

But shadow, that between us  

Let it not be lost  

I have gone to live  

In the moon’s cold house  

Moon doesn’t ride the sky anymore  
Married now, he paces his shining floors  
Stands at the circling windows  

He doesn’t speak to me  

I forgot  

Summer nights I danced in the full moon meadow I forgot  
How cold he is  

How cold light shone over the earth  

I forgot  

When I came here I forgot  

How a lighthouse world has need of human shadow  

I did not know cold arms twined,  

His cold tongue come | could not take it  

How to lie nestled in rock cliffs at night is cold  

Moonset no human darkness but the earth’s  
Lovers wail in pairs to the frozen stars  

His long hair hangs over the earth  
I have chosen the moon  

The moon is beautiful  

But my shadow, that between us  
Lost
