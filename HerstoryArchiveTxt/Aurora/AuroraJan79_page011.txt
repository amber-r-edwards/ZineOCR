Susan Pensak  

ON BEING CAUGHT  

When I was five,  

I would sit in my bedroom closet  

and squeeze thick lines of airplane glue  
across the red board floor.  

At eight,  

I would count the rows of caramels  

and choose the right piece to leave  

a space gone  

unnoticed during the Friday night movie.  
I would watch the walls  

with patterns that rose and fell  

with the sunlight.  

Count fireflies instead of night fears.  

And now, while zeroing in on thirty,  

all shadows fallen,  

I lie in bed awake.  

Eyes closed, body limp.  

I wait or hope  

for a hand to fall somewhere  

between the stretch marks and the sagging breasts,  

or possibly a gentle curve pressed next to mine.  

Moonlighted and disappointed,  

I smile, full-faced,  

so not to be caught one more time in this life.  
THE SHOEBOX AND THE MOON  

Laura L. Thornton  

Shoeboxes are security.  

How many birds have nestled in their cornered eaves  
Found hopping in the backyard, too young to fly  
Nursed all night by children with egg and cotton  

And how many collections of shells or sugar packets  
Were housed in their sturdiness,  
arranged in careful order of a now-forgotten code.  

So many shoeboxes I brought home  

With each new season’s growth,  

Feeling slightly smug, but so sad in tight new shoes  
With old friend shoes lying in state  

in the new shoebox, shrouded in tissue paper.  

The shoebox shape never changes.  
Like a brick or a loaf of poundcake,  
A part of life unnoticed, important.  
I, for one, feel better just knowing  
there’s a shoebox in the closet.  

And the moon is in the night sky. It  
reminds me of a shoebox.
