In a younger age, under 14, it was

28 percent, just over one in four.  
When we broadened the definition  
to include exposure and those other  
kinds of verbal propositions, it went  
up to 54 percent before the age of 18,  
and 48 percent before the age of 14.  
More specifically, in terms of father-  
daughter incest, we found that (this  
includes biological fathers, natural  
fathers, there was even one adoptive  
father) 4.5 percent of this random  
sample had had an experience of in-  
cestuous abuse with a father, includ-  
ing stepfathers, and so on.

This is many times higher than the  
estimate that was seen as the most  
thoughtful estimate available. Child  
sexual abuse is also occurring at a  
much higher rate than most people  
have believed before.

So, I think we have to conclude that  
sexual abuse and violence are very  
widespread in the United States.

I don’t know if I even have to make  
the point that sexual violence is  
primarily a matter of male per-  
petrators and female victims. There  
are male rape victims, but those who  
are raped are almost totally raped by  
male perpetrators also. And of course  
there are many more boy victims of  
child sexual abuse, many more than  
there are male rape victims, although  
there are practically no studies on  
adult male rape victims.

Incidentally, it’s not just in the area  
of sexual abuse, it’s in the area of  
violent crime in general that it’s  
primarily males who are responsible.  
Nine out of 10, or 90 percent of all the  

arrests for violent crimes are of men.  
So we have to see that sexual vio-  
lence, indeed all violence, appears to  
be a male norm, not a female norm.

These data, I think, suggest that  
rape, sexual abuse, child sexual har-  
assment, and criminal violence in  
general must be seen not as the prob-  
lem of the psychopathology of a few  
men, but as a widespread social prob-  
lem. And this problem has to be  
tackled as a social problem, not just a  
mental health problem.

We have to look for social factors.  
Society’s notions of masculinity and  
femininity that predispose males to a  
kind of predatory sexuality and  
females as victims — has to be ex-  
plored. I have tried to explore this, for  
example, in my book The Politics of  
Rape.

The role of cultural factors must be  
sought, and I’m happy to see that you  
have some good films, such as “Not a  
Love Story,” which helps to see the  
connection between pornography  
and violence. We must also recognize  
media images in general; I believe  
you have another film, “Killing Us  
Softly,” on images in advertising.  
These all play a part, I think.

So this week at Stanford is dedi-  
cated to facing rape, to facing the fact  
that sexual violence is a male norm in  
this society, not because it is a  
capitalist society, as Angela Davis has  
argued, but because it is a patriarchal  
society.

This is the first step toward solving  
the problem, and I urge you to give  
this matter your most serious atten-  
tion.

hurts and can make me cry. Warm  
makes snow disappear. There is no  
snow where there is candy. Warm  
makes balloons disappear. There is  
no snow where there are balloons. It  
was warm at school.”

“Look over there and I will teach  
you,” I said. “The snow is melting on  
the pavement because it is warmer  
than the snow and the snow becomes  
streams and floods of water. We are  
nearly to the car and I hear footsteps  
running behind me.”

“Mrs. Casey. You are Mrs. Casey!  
Holy hell!” said the grocery bagger.  
“I don’t believe it. I told them so. I  
wasn’t going to take your bags out to  
your car but then I recognized you as  
Mrs. Casey. Please let me take your bags  
out to your car. I remember packing  
them full of ripe yellow corn, fresh  
shrimp, coffee beans, and notebooks.  
Please give me a big tip.”

“I am nearly to my car,” I said.  
“Please, my son and I would like to be  
alone. I am giving you ten dollars. But  
it is not for you. It is for the man who  
was in line behind me. He doesn’t  
buy stories; he has no money,” I said.  
“I am at my car and I must yell to the  
boy so he will hear me. TELL THE  
MAN THAT IT WAS FROM ANITA! I  
do not give thieves money.”  
“I am playing with the toy mirror,”  
Paul said. “What do I see?”

“See Paul in the mirror,” I said.  
“That is you. That is what you look  

like. I saw Anita Casey in the grocery  
store. She was almost the victim of a  
pick-pocket, I shall tell them.”

“I am looking at you, Mama,” Paul  
said. “That is what you look like.  
When I look at Mama, I see Mama.  
Mama is a person. When I look in the  
mirror, I see that face again. That is  
Paul. That is what I look like. I have a  
face.”

“Now I pull an apple out from a  
grocery sack and start to hand it to  
you. I crunch a bite first and it is just  
white inside. It is like nothing to be an  
apple. It is just an apple. I know better  
than anyone, even Anita Casey, what  
it is like to be me.”

“My goodness,” Paul said. “I am a  
person. I have an outside.”

“I want to write about watching  
Paul grow up and about how I almost  
missed the whole thing. I try to write  
it. It becomes Anita’s story. The story  
all becomes nothing as if nothing has  
happened.”
