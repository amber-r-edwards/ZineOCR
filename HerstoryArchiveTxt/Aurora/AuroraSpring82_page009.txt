Samia Halaby Speaks cont. from p.6  
by you?  
S - What I object to and the things  
I speak out about, are not for my per-  
sonal benefit. In many ways, my per-  
sonal benefit would have been to be  
obedient at this school, to do what  
they wanted, but I couldn’t resist  
speaking up. What I spoke up about  
was things that touched other people  
as well: student rights, things that  
hurt students, or hurt education in  
general. If I am heard, and if students  
learn, and if workers at the university,  
and faculty learn that they too can  
speak up, and that we can speak up  
together, and realize that it’s possible  
to accomplish things if we all speak  
up in these matters, then we could  
really make it difficult for them to  
maintain their power at the school.  
They could lose their power, and they  
could lose their privilege, if enough of  
us speak up.  
Q - What is their power and privilege?  
S - They are empowered by the ad-  
ministration of the university. They  
control who teaches there and who  
doesn’t, which courses are taught and  
who teaches them, which students  
can take the major and which  
graduate students get which jobs.  
They choose very carefully which  
students they promote for jobs. Then  
those students go to other schools  
and send back students, their  
students, whom they’ve picked. So  
one of Yale’s favorites goes to  
Chicago Art Institute, say, and then  
he, usually it’s a he, sends back a stu-  
dent of his, whom he thinks would be  
ideal for Yale, or for this very  
bureaucratic game. Yale accepts it as  
an extended favor, and it becomes a  
feather in the cap of the ex-Yalie. It  
builds up a bureaucratic system of  
power.  
Q - What is their criterion for choice?  
S - Not talented artists, not new ideas.  
The criterion for whom they favor is  
who is obedient, who is loyal to them,  
who will promote them and their  
ideas, plug into their system, and  
recognize their privilege and power.  
Q - Their ideas of art, in other words?  
S - Their ideas of art and their ideas of  
how to run the school are the same. I  
don’t think their ideas are genuinely  
about art, I think they’re ideas about  
restating the way art was fifty or a  
hundred years ago.  
Q - Ideas about the art world...  
S - Ideas about the past. That’s what a  
conservative is: a person who believes  
the past should still exist in the pre-  
sent, and that the future should be  
like the past.  
So they choose people who will be  
loyal to them and recognize their  
right to be in power. They would not  
choose someone who speaks up for  
women, or for black people, or for the  
workers and their right at the school,  
because that’s all threatening to their  
right to rule the school. They would  
not choose me, if I say the school  
should be run by a committee of  
students, workers and teachers.  
Q - Do you think that they don’t  
believe that art has any political im-  
port, or that artists should have  
political ideas? I did a tutorial last  
semester, silkscreening political  
posters. One of the teachers said to  
me that I shouldn't try to be political,  
all art is by nature political.  
S - That’s the whole kernel. You're  
really getting to the heart of it. You  
try to do one thing with your art and  
they tell you “art is by nature  
political, so just do your art and don’t  
be political,” but in the end they're  
saying “do our kind of political art.”  
They’re being very political with their  
art... They're stating their idea of how  
the world should be with their art and  
their views on art. By telling you not  
to be political, they’re just telling  
you, “don’t do your politics, do ours.”  
It’s just as simple as that.  
You see, if you think about Matisse,  
his paintings were not conservative,  
but if you are forced to sit and imitate  
them now, that’s conservative, and  
that’s political.  
I may not be interested to make the  
subject matter of my art propaganda  
about certain things. Nevertheless,  
my paintings are political, in the sense  
that I make my stand about the pre-  
sent and the future. In the same way,  
their paintings are political. They  
make their stand duplicating things  
that happened in the past.

Atlanta 1981  
This green ribbon I wear  
for these our children  
is really my mother’s, there was  
a roll of it among her sewing  
things, spools of thread of  
every color, pins and old,  
saved elastic, thrifty  
woman she was, is  
not now that, she’s  
senile, Mom is, so  
I took her ribbon  
the knots  
the ties  
to wear  
her on my sleeve, to  
pin her, make  
her place in this  
grieving  
while she dies
