Assignment For  
Creative Writing

Becoming Self-Sufficient  

So she paints her own body  
instead.  

She cannot paint  

the paper, its surface is  
unknown. The colors won’t  
jump, or brushes brush properly,  

flames in anger and the ghost  
she cannot smear pastel, blur chalk;  

vanishes. “But we lived naively,” I  

she cannot Alix Kates Shulman cry to nobody. “We lived inside a  
little easily penetrable shell and we  
never tried to go beyond it. We  
never wanted to know what lay  

beyond. Oh self-indulgence!”  

So she moves her own hand,  
it moves well.  
No one can hold  

the rhythm she has hidden so well.  
Or bring out of her ginger-haired boy with long teeth  
who said to us nervously. Sheila and  
I stared at him entranced. The remark  
was dumb.  

No one can find any rhythm so  
but we could tell he also meant it.  

Sam asks, “Why do little girls like  
horses so much, do they get off  
riding them?”  

Jonathan laughs, “The anthropolo-

seriously. Sam actually looked a  
great deal like a well-read, long-  
haired squirrel. If we held out gra-  
ham crackers on the palms of our  
hands could he be tamed?  

“I’m studying philosophy and an-  

So she reads poems  
aloud in an empty room.  

No one asks about sex.” Sam tries  
to find out about the religion of the large  
apes. “No one studies apes,” he said  
sadly, “I think I’ll go live with them  
in a jungle for my doctorate.” We

Sheila starts the answer, “There is  
the great sense of control between  
the legs, that’s powerful and sex-

followed by one squirrel with a beard  
and a doctorate.

like words on paper (envelope  
halves, bus transfers,  
grocery lists.) “Horseback riding has always  
been one of the great adventures for women  
in this country. And horses  

Only a year after we first met one  
morning—Sam, Sheila wrote a story about him  
that her writing professor handed back to her  
with all of the dialogue underlined in red ink.  
Pencilled across the top of the assignment was the  
legend - “no real character would  
ever talk like this.” - But in my Yale  

they did. All of them more or less  

“Oh yes,” Sam looks briefly seri-  
ous, “but bareback riding,” his eyes

for four years at least...  

Pamela pushed her dark hair over  
the top of her broad wise forehead  
for perhaps the 50th time since the  
beginning of lunch. “Actually the  
word funky—” she said in her husky  
reverential voice reminiscent of her  
years of studying the Torah with her  
father, “The word funky comes from  
the South where it meant the smell  
of sex in a hot climate, that was  
funk, or funky.” Jonathan pushed  
his glasses back up his nose,  
“Interesting, interesting,” he mur-  
mured.  

“Do you talk about things like that  
with your parents?” Sam, confronted  
once again with the essential mystery  
of woman, attempted to find a  
category for Pamela.  

Throwing liquor stolen from a  
Happy Hour onto the fire I invoke  
the ghost of Calhoun College past to  
ask it “What did you think of my  
friends and me when we lived in  
Calhoun?”  

“Well everyone knew you all  
drank tea and took acid. The women  
in your group were considered the  
least feminine women in the college,  
oh, and you were all called the  
literati (emphasis on the rot) just as  
a joke.” I hurl a blue book at the—

weren’t eating, more when they were  
lonely, or trying to impress, or

one end of the table while eating  
soup with perfect accuracy. Now she  
straightens up and her hood falls  
back. “Sam, have you ever thought  
of skipping the great apes and going  
straight into studying the anthropol-  
ogy of white North American men?”  

There is applause. Sarah goes back  
to her reading firmly even though  
Sam tries to distract her by rubbing  
jello in his beard.  

“I wanted to write about us for a  
class,” I told Sheila the other night at  
dinner in New York. (Sheila, like  
everyone else, implicated in this story  
but myself has graduated) “And it  
seemed as if all or almost all of the  
conversations I could remember were—  
long intellectual discussions of sex,  
is that the only thing we ever talked  
about?”  

Sheila twisted her most human of  
human mouths and lifted her eye-  
brows at me, “Sex is the smell of  
humanity,” she said briskly raising  
her hands. “Or at least sex and  
words.”  

“Ah words and sex,” we drank our  
wine to that toast and the waiter  
came over to our table saying,  

“Listen, you two can talk after  
you order too you know.”
