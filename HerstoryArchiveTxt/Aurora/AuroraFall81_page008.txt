THIS IS DEDICATED TO OUR  
MOTHERS...  
Not our fathers, donors,  

1. The woman next door is being  
beaten again.  
2. Womyn are better suited to each  
other as lovers than to men.  
Heterosexuality is a rigidly enforced  
cultural/political institution. Men in  
general are lousy lovers.  
3. Things that have turned men on:  
the murder and dismemberment of  
womyn. Womyn who cannot walk  
because their feet have been turned in-  
to three inches of rotting bloody flesh  
through foot-binding. Fucking womyn  
who have bags over their heads. Fuck-  
ing rubber dolls. Ramming objects up  
womyn’s vaginas, up womyn’s rectums,  
down womyn’s throats. Fucking a  
woman to death by hemorrhage with a  
group of buddies. Pictures of womyn  
with chainsaws up their vaginas. Pic-  
tures of womyn being stuffed into meat  
grinders.  
4. Heterosexuality is one way to sur-  
vive under patriarchy. Lesbianism is  
another.  

5. “I don’t like the word separatism. It  
is a word defined by our relationship to  
boys; it implies moving away from  
rather than moving towards. We need a  
more positive word for those of us who  
are woman-identified. How about affir-  
mation?”  

6. I don’t like being fucked. Personally I  
think pricks are ugly.  

7. The word ‘woman’ comes from the  
Anglo-Saxon ‘wifman’, the wife of a  
man.  

8. Rapists are normal heterosexual  
men. Rape is not a crime of passion.  
Frequently the rapist cannot get it up.  
Men rape 2-week-old babies, 93-year  
old womyn, their daughters, mothers,  
wives, sisters, aunts, nieces, cousins,  
lovers, friends of friends, daughters of  
friends, patients, customers,  
employees, neighbors, total strangers.  
One out of three womyn can expect to  
be raped in her lifetime. A woman is  
raped in the U.S. every minute. Normal  
heterosexual men apparently have the  
desire to invade a woman’s body by  
whatever means possible.  

9. Parents: Mother. Donor.  

10. In the 1800s she spent most of  
her life confined to her house, writing  
poetry and love letters to her  

Picture yourself in a...  

friend/sister-in-law Sue. Sometimes she  
corresponded with men, but for the  
most part she lived with her sister Vin-  
nie and her ailing mother. I guess you  
could call her a separatist. The men  
thought she was eccentric.  

11. The womyn’s movement didn’t  
create lesbian separatism; we have ex-  
isted throughout the lives of all womyn.  
Convents, girls’ schools, “ladies’”  
rooms—all of these institutions reflect  
our choice to live/be with womyn only.  
12. “Men tell us that this organizing  
amongst ourselves is not constructive.  
That all depends upon what you are  
trying to construct. At this point their  
opinions are also becoming increasing-  
ly irrelevant.”  

13. In a Yale Women’s Studies class,  
half of the students either were, or  
knew a woman who was, battered by a  
Yale boyfriend.  

14. “My separatism is a state of mind.  
I work with boys, I live in a city full of  
boys, but in my heart and in my head I  
am fully woman-identified. I give them  
none of my energy, I just take what I  
can get and spend all my self-directed  
time with womyn.”  

15. Womyn are the only oppressed  
group to be completely divided among  
the oppressors. We are colonized  
without being ghettoized.  

16. Men hate womyn and the fruit of  
their wombs so much that they build  
neutron bombs/Trident submarines/MX  
missiles/B-1 bombers...  

17. “I am a separatist; not very many lesbians are. Some of my friends are male. But I prefer women and that preference is political.”  

19. Womyn who seek to be equal to  
men lack ambition.  

20. “I live on a woman-only collec-  
tive farm. For years we struggled emo-  
tionally, financially, and politically to  
create our own space. Finally we have  
a world that we can define, love, nur-  
ture. We do not rape the land. Sure, we  
still have to deal with the state and the  
boys sometimes, but we are as close to  
our Amazon foremothers as we can be  
in a patriarchy.”  

21. Men are always looking for  
womyn to make them whole. They  
need us; we don’t need them.  

22. Give me a woman with bravado  
and you can keep your few good men.  
23. “I think separatism is necessary at  
this point in history because it is the on-  
ly way to survive under patriarchy.  
However, I believe it’s a temporary  
response. Ultimately, I hope the boys  
got their act together on their own, so  
we can all work together to change the  
world. I don’t believe this will happen  
in my lifetime.”  

24. I like being with womyn.  

25. Men beat us, cripple us, confine  
us, sterilize us against our wills, force  
us to bear unwanted children, tear out  
our wombs, slice off our clitorises, sew  
up our labia, cut off our breasts, kill us.  
26. There’s no such thing as a non-  
oppressive heterosexual relationship.  
27. A man who develops a radical  
consciousness must become aware of  
an inherent ambiguity in his position. I  
once knew a man who said that when  
he grew up he would be a radical  
feminist and kill himself.  

28. For most of the history of this  
country, womyn have been legally  
slaves. Womyn have been bought and  
sold. Men own their wives, their wives’  
children, born or unborn, their wives’  
labour and the product thereof, their  
wives’ genitals and wombs. Runaway  
wives were once treated as fugitive  
slaves and anyone who helped one  
could be prosecuted for robbery. Like  
slaves, womyn have traditionally taken  
the names of their master—husbands  
and fathers. At one point if a woman’s  
husband died some other male in-  
herited the children; womyn who  
disobeyed husbands could be publicly  
whipped.  

29. “I don’t call myself a separatist  
because I don’t know what the word  
means: not forming significant social  
relationships with heterosexual men,  
with all men, associating only with  
womyn, associating only with LSS,  
associating only with separatists? Also,  
I don’t know whether separatism is a  
lifestyle for individual womyn or a  
blueprint for the future.”  

30. “You can call me a dyke, butch,  
queer, man-hater, whatever. I’m all  
those things, and proud.”  

31. In the 15th through 17th cen-  
turies, men murdered 9 million of us as  
witches because, they said, womyn are  
inherently stupid, scheming, carnal,  
and evil.  

32. Sometimes I wonder why men  
hate womyn so much.  

33. “I don’t like it when you go  
powder your nose in the ladies’ room. I  
know you're all in there making revolu-  
tion.” —A. Bunker.  

34. White males earn more money  
than anyone else. Next comes Third  
World men; then white womyn; then  
Third World womyn. Womyn are  
responsible for 2/3 of the work hours in  
the world (though they make up only  
1/3 of the labor force), receive 1/10 of  
world income (U.N.). In the U.S. we us-  
ed to earn 64¢ for every dollar a man  
earns, then 59¢, now 47¢.  

‘is a tradition among Yale Men  

Now it is becoming a tradition among  
Yale Women, too.
