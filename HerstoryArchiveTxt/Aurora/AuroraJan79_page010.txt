new footings

step out  
and look at this  

no, not my foot  

second toe longer than the first  
or yours either, toes  

opposable as thumbs  

no, not even the fact  
that between us we have  
so many toes to step on  

look at your legs  

not thrust out to pace with mine  
but rooted in the field like a bull’s  
as red a provocation as a cape  

look at my legs  

standing first on one, then the other  
like a loon, but not a resting posture  
the water is too cold  

getting out of bed mornings  
is like parachuting into  

a mine field, the floorboards  
are always wired with winter  
and the bathroom always  
too long a hall away  

assuming that we walk out  

of here alive, chatting  

about something vital  

at least about chickens  
scratching, toes spread like rakes,  
will we still be stepping on eggs?

Growing old  
with Mozart and Vivaldi  

And now Ella Davenport is  
old,  

the glory of her years  
gone,  

her breasts deflated bells  
the sound of which  

tolls only in  

memory.  

She squats on the three-legged stool  
of time  

gingerly staring  

at glass cherries  

in crystal balls.  

Mozart and Vivaldi salt  
her bitter path of  

Gretel,  

Johannes gone long ago,  
while the Witch  

from the Gingerbread den  
beckons  

unceasingly.
