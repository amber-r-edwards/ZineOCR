It is easy to focus on  
what Reagan has  
created, but what  
created Reagan? A  
militarist ideology  
that is inherently  
sexist.  

Militarism is an out-  
growth of a system based on dominance.  
People who are determined to dominate  
one another can only ultimately destroy  
themselves and each other. We are op-  
posed to:  

dominance of one country over  
another  

dominance of one race over another  

dominance of one sexual preference  
over another  

dominance of one class over another  

dominance of one sex over another.  

The military is an institution by which  

people dominate each other. The sexual connotations  
of war are evidenced by the phallocentric  
language of war: ‘Mounting an attack from  
hardened missile silos in order to penet-  
rate Soviet airspace.’ Doesn't this sound  
like a rape? Language reflects culture.  

Missiles are phallic symbols. So is  
Hoover Tower. It reminds us not only of  
Hooverville, but also of what created  
Hoovervilles and oppression — the ideol-  
ogy of dominance which is imposed by  
male leaders on every level of society.  

Our banner assures that the connection  
between the phallocentrism expressed in  
Hoover Tower, war, and women’s oppres-  
sion does not go unrecognized.
