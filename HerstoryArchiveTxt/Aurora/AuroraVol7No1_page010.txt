“The Tyranny of Slenderness’’

Dear M:  
It is difficult for me to say, but I lit-
erally can’t stand the sight of you
anymore. Looking at your withered,
thin, and wasted body makes me ill.
Physically, you are no more than skin
stretched tautly over protruding
bones — no meat, no muscle, no fat.
Your gaunt features reveal someone
who is haggard and tired. You are
anorectic. I have tried to help you and
can’t, and I cannot continue to watch
your physical deterioration without
causing myself severe emotional pain.

I love you and can’t bear to see this
happen to you. For so long I refused
to notice the rapid weight loss. The
notion that you might be anorectic
seemed absurd to me since we had
confronted the subject before, had
grieved over friends who suffered
from it, and had been aware of the
serious threat it posed to life. But the
concerns friends voiced to me could
no longer be ignored. When the
bulky clothes were shed in the
springtime I saw a skeleton wearing a
baggy bikini. When people remarked
upon how old you looked I noticed
the sallowness of your complexion
and your sunken eyes.

All of a sudden our interaction from
the past six months seemed a
charade. Dining at your house, you
always insisted I have seconds and
lots of dessert, but never took any for
yourself. You said you had been eat-
ing all day — but I never saw, your
roommate never saw, your friends
never saw. You enthusiastically de-
scribed the abundance and quality of
food at your house; how was I to
know you rarely touched it? Your as-
surances that you exercised regularly
and felt “absolutely fine” left me no
cause to worry, at least then.

But once I convinced myself that
you were too thin, I panicked. I
sought help for you everywhere.
Doctors, counselors and friends told
me there was little I could do short of
force-feeding you unless you
acknowledged the problem yourself
and asked for help. Our confrontation
was less than productive. You were
insulted (perhaps embarrassed?) that I
thought you capable of such self-
destruction, and I was hurt that you
could not see that I was seriously
worried. Emotions like pride, despair
and anxiety ruined our ability to
communicate and understand each
other as caring friends. The subject
was dropped and all I could hope was
that you now might take a more criti-
cal look at yourself.

So now I am past angry. To help
preserve my own sanity I choose not
to look at you, but it does not keep
me from silently wondering why —
why you and countless other females
feel compelled to starve yourselves
into an emotional and physical
frenzy. And then I turn on the T.V.
and see sexy, thin females draped on
Cadillacs. I walk into the Campus store
and am confronted by Cosmopoli-
tan’s and Seventeen’s latest scantily
clad and curvy cover models. I drive
through the city and am assaulted by
larger than life Calvin Klein blue jeans
adorning shapely female derrieres.
And then instinctively I tell myself I
must lose weight. I cringe, and re-
member that only 3% of the female
population are perfectly content with
their bodies, and I realize that we
have all been brainwashed into the
search for a ‘10’ figure; a figure
which inevitably means at least ten
pounds less than whatever weight we
might be. The message we receive
from the media, from men, from each
other, is THIN. We are subsequently
obsessed by it, desensitized by its
abundance, and ultimately victimized
by its mere existence.

We all suffer, but you, my friend,
are a tragedy. I mourn for the severe
physical and emotional abuse society
has forced you to endure. I want it to
end. But only by understanding,
acknowledging, and rejecting these
predetermined body images society
has overwhelmed us with, can we
begin to be happy with — to live with
ourselves as we are. We are worth
it.

Body Images

Anorexia nervosa and bulimia are
eating disorders all too common to
women, especially young women,
and need to be recognized as serious
threats to life. Twenty percent of all
diagnosed anorectics ultimately die of
it and bulimics do themselves severe
physical harm as a result of their
binge-purge cycle. Many of our
friends, hallmates, and loved ones
suffer privately from these disorders
and need to be understood and
helped, before it is too late. CAPS
(Counseling and Psychological Ser-
vices) has provided brief descriptions
of anorexia and bulimia to aid you in
learning about these problems, but
you can best help potential victims by
reading about and discussing the is-
sues further. More resources are av-
ailable at CAPS, the Bridge and the
Women’s Center. CAPS provides
therapy groups and counseling for
both anorectics and bulimics. Once
we begin to acknowledge these dis-
orders as serious problems, we may
start to understand why the tendency
to starve and/or purge oneself is a
logical extension of the societal ob-
session with thinness. Perhaps, then,
we can finally attempt to eliminate the
causes and not just the symptoms.

BULIMIA

bulimia — (Gr. great hunger) an ab-
normal and constant craving for food.

Criteria

(1) consumes large quantities of
food over a short period of time
(binge eating)

(2) the food eaten while binging is
typically high in calories

(3) usually binges in secret

(4) the binge ends in self-induced
vomiting and feelings of self
reproach

Characteristics of Bulimics
(1) usually middle-class adolescents
or young adult women.
(2) high achievers
(3) perfectionistic
(4) strong orientation toward acad-
emic achievement and a tradi-
tional lifestyle, including mar-
riage
(5) abnormally low self-esteem
(6) a sense of loneliness and isola-
tion
(7) an obsession with food as it re-
lates to body weight
(8) “good children” i.e., eager to
please, comply, and achieve in
order to elicit the love and ap-
proval of others

Methods of Purging
(1) forced vomiting is most common
(2) laxatives, diuretics, and emetics
(3) fasting — takes a longer cycle
than the above
(4) enemas
(5) compulsive exercise
(6) chewing food and spitting it out

Effects of Bulimia on the Body
(1) hypoglycemia: dizziness,
headaches, crying, excessive
worry, anxiety, and depression
may result from sugar deficiency
in the blood. Foods high in sugar
content trigger the pancreas to
release an excess of insulin
which drives blood sugar levels
below normal, often creating a
craving for more sugar. However, the
incidence of true
chemical hypoglycemia has been
exaggerated according to some
medical researchers. Some
bulimics like to use hypog-
lycemia as an excuse for binge
eating.

(2) voluntary lethargy from the deple-
tion of energy sources due to
prolonged fasting or binging and
purging can lead to pessimism, in-
activity, and ultimately, depres-
sion.

(3) use of drugs: psychotropics can increase appe-
tite and enhance binge eating be-
havior. Lithium can cause death in
those who vomit because it de-
pletes potassium. Loss of intracel-
lular potassium can lead to cardiac
arrest.

(4) neurological abnormalities: un-
certain at this time

(5) binging can cause severe stomach
pain, headaches, and dizziness

(6) reverse peristalsis — spontaneous
regurgitation of the stomach con-
tents

(7) eroded dental enamel, particularly
on the inner surface of the teeth,
due to the hydrochloric acid con-
tent of vomit, may lead to gum
disease, innumerable cavities, and
tooth loss

(8) severe tearing and bleeding in and
around the esophagus (throat).

(9) hiatal hernia — the stomach
pushing through the diaphragm,
which creates the sensation of
choking;

(10) severely infected salivary glands

(11) hypokalemia (potassium defi-
ciency);

(12) dehydration and fainting from
loss of sodium, especially in
athletes and those who exercise
a lot

(13) severe constipation due to loss of
intestinal muscle tone from the
chronic use of laxatives

(14) secondary amenorrhea: the
cessation of menstruation after
having begun to menstruate

ANOREXIA NERVOSA
anorexia — loss of appetite, especially
when prolonged.

Criteria:
(1) sudden and severe weight loss.
(2) refuses to eat, or eats very little.
(3) continues to diet and lose
weight, never satisfied with
body.
(4) denial of fatigue

Characteristics of Anorectics

(1) fear of losing control of body
and gaining weight. A question
of mind over body (slenderness
is a statement of will power).

(2) turns away from food in times of
stress.

(3) lack of self-esteem.

(4) paralyzing sense of ineffective-
ness.

(5) distorted body image.

(6) obsessive concern with food,
focus on diet as The Answer to
all personal problems.

(7) usually middle-class adolescents
or young adult women.

(8) mothers are characteristically
overinvolved in their daughter's
lives and fathers are preoc-
cupied with work outside
home.

(9) eager to comply, please, and
achieve.

(10) can be apathetic and irritable
due to physiological changes
