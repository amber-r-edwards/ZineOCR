Pamela Firk arrived in Delhi

scant nine hours before the turbanned men:
turned their guns on the prime minister
and shot her dead.

This is her first trip to India.

It is a continent
teeming with a people who bloody themselves.
Pamela, with her light skin and angled voice,

is a yoga teacher on spiritual pilgrimage.

She has bought a camera,

been nervous,

and lost sleep before this voyage,

but she did not imagine she would land in a country
smoldering in the focused point of a gun

that burnt itself through a woman’s body.

Pamela Firk was rushed to a bus then a plane

that lifted her from a city

strangling itself in mourning.

She watched from the polyurethane window,

yellow flames licking around the darkened urban mass
searing the shape of Delhi in her blue eyes.

She may dream of those bullets.
She will look at the Taj Mahal and imagine it smeared red.
In her morning meditation she will not remember

but she will rise from herself to a world

vomiting blood at her feet.

—Bernice Hausman

Pamela Firk is a real person who did, in fact, travel to India at the time of
Indira Gandhi’s death. The poem, however, is a wholly-constructed,
fictional account and is not intended to describe her experience there. I am
indebted to her for the inspiration she provided me.

too much

too much of me

there is too much

of me.

She sang it to the curtains.

She was cold and slimy
like a larva

and easily smushed.

Or like a baby bird

that mouth feeding
wanting a mother to fill her
fill her

live for filling her.

She lay on the vinyl couch
splitting seams

and feeding.
An amoeba go
An earthworm.
An embryo sucking its yolk,

itself.

That one egg in the carton
that cracks as a bird
imposes itself

when it ought to be dead
just a yolk

unfed.

—Bernice Hausman

Way In The Middle Of The Air

An endless seven sometimes twice seen
apart from the mainland
We built these islands
in the place of the edge of the world.
In the place where fear and sight mean the same thing.

Imagine a hot place.
That feverish spot on your thigh,
the inside of your retina
Maybe Los Alamos.
Looks a lot like darkness, doesn’t it?
But it’s not. It’s a blaze of glory
spinning through the desert air
—Hey Zeke, didja see that?
Look at the tail on that one!

I got an appointment with fire somewhere
between the prairie dog holes
and the edge of the big black envelope.
Over at the airport they've never explained
the landing pad language—
forty football fields long, and made
entirely of white stones,
a kind you can’t even find in this state.

It’s a drop zone for God’s paratroopers.

It’s a bull’s eye for the White Train
coming out of the South, churning wagon wheel circles
of dust and tumbleweed.

That's one way of getting to hell,

A parade of angels pulls up, led by Miss America (her

dress glued to the red Chevrolet convertible she’s riding on).

And me? I'm off somewhere nappin’.
only read about it later. It came on
right after the football scores.
You know what it's like when you're face down,
and all around you are golden wheels of eyes,
Nine eyeing spokes, one beady hub each?
When machines hover overhead, and
four-faced sphinxes clutter the horizon?
You try to make lists of things in your head:

Prime numbers, noble animals: ox, eagle, lion,
Man.

You bruise easily in the dark lot of parked cars
(El Camino. Scamp. Duster)

A black space glazed with icy slickness.
Autos crowd chaotically between what drivers

believed to be yellow and white lines.
A perfect night for falling,

You wish the man on the bike would stop talking to his VW
(‘damn Russians, all the time messin’ with the jet

stream”)

You wish you weren't thinking about that nightmare
where children sit, legs spread and heads bowed,
Faceless as they run their fingers through hair
made of spaghetti and brown sauce.

“It only looks like darkness,” you tell yourself

“The air is actually packed with tiny snow particles from outer space.”

You can't feel or taste them, but you can hear, the whirring.

Like some people you know, they steal all the light.

Personally, I was glad he shot those four kids.

When he looked in their eyes he thought they were darkness.
He kept yelling at them,

“Don't talk to me. Don’t talk to me.”
But you know how crazy people in New York are,

they just come closer.

Don’t talk to me unless you can say
one blade of grass is taller

or sharper
or more yellowed

or more crinkled.
Unless you can say one of those things
well just don’t talk to me
unless you can.
