Mythical Romance?

_by Caroline Streeter

Every breath you take  
Every move you make  
Every bond you break  
Every step you take  
I'll be watching you  

Every single day  
Every word you say  
Every game you play  
Every night you stay  
I'll be watching you.  

Oh, can’t you see  

You belong to me  

How a poor heart aches  
With every step you take  
Every move you make  
Every vow you break  
Every smile you fake  
Every claim you stake  

I'll be watching you  

Since you’ve been gone  

I’ve been lost without a trace  

I dream at night  

I can only see your face  

I look around  

But it’s you I can’t replace  

I feel so cold  

And I long for your embrace  

I keep crying  

Baby, baby please  

The new Police song — “song of  

the summer” — “Every Breath You  
Take,” is from a feminist viewpoint,  
very disturbing. The lyrics describe a  
person watching, stalking another  
person who has apparently left the  
person singing — leaving them  
heartbroken. There is a strident, ob-  
sessive tone to the song, particularly  
in the line “Oh can’t you see/You  
belong to me” and in the oft-repeated  
“I'll be watching you.” As in Alix Dob-  
kin’s presentation on sexism in pop  
music, the song is supposed to be  
romantic, but to women it’s a terrify-  
ing statement. It is sung by a man, and  
although not explicitly about a wo-  
man, of course it is understood to be  
about a heterosexual relationship;  
moreover, the man who wrote it says  
it was inspired by his own despair at  
the breakup of his own marriage.  
Now, I don’t know anything about  
that particular situation, but women  
are victimized by the obsessive  
“love” of men who feel they’ve been  
rejected, of men who find their emo-  
tions normal and their obsessive at-  
tention “romantic,” and romantic in  
part because it is threatening  
(aggressiveness eroticized).  

This song is a tribute to that  
obsessed, aggressive, reactionary  
love; its singer has no thought for the  
effect of his attentions on the woman,  
he doesn’t care if she wants him  
“watching” her or not. He is blinded  
by hurt, perhaps, but the line “Oh  
can’t you see/You belong to me” is a  
refusal not only to see her as an au-  
tonomous being but also a refusal to  
attempt to understand why she left  
him in the first place. I can under-  
stand why she would; such an ob-  
sessive “love” would be suffocating  
and scary. More frightening still is  
that she has no control over how he  
treats her. According to the song, he  
is watching her, following her, terrib-  
ly hurt, but angry at her as well. He is  
harassing her, but so long as he  
doesn’t threaten her explicitly and/or  
physically (such that she can “prove”  
he’s done so), she has no legal de-  
fense or recourse. He, on the other  
hand, is free to drive her crazy, scare  
her horribly, psychologically rape and  
batter her.  

Recently, we have begun to hear of  
such incidents from individual wo-  
men. Women have been harassed by  
old boyfriends, and husbands, ac-  
quaintances and strangers for years.  
There are those who have changed  
their telephone numbers, the locks  
on their doors. Some have actually  
been forced to resort to leaving their  
homes entirely, moving to a new city  
or state, leaving their jobs and/or  
families. Considering the present  
grim reality of women’s economic sit-  
uation, these are drastic measures.  
Often however, a woman’s sanity is at  
stake. Incredibly, in many cases these  
measures are not enough. Men have  
succeeded in continuing their harass-  
ment, sometimes following the wo-  
man to a new city or state. The  
situation may persist for years.  

Sexual harassment has recently  
been legally defined as a crime.  
However, the ambiguous definition  
(or issue) of romantic love obscures  
many cases of sexual harassment,  
even the very blatant ones. When  

romantic love is considered to exist  

between a man and a woman (in a  
heterosexual relationship), that  
precludes sexual harassment of any  
kind, including rape. “Love” is under-  
stood to be a good thing, and acts that  
supposedly find their impetus in love  
are not considered violent or threat-  
ening, in a bad sense, that is. Threats  
and violence in the context of roman-  
tic love are considered erotic.  
Moreover, as love is considered a  
private matter, the courts are reluc-  
tant to become involved in the  
“romantic” aspects of a relationship  
between two people, especially in the  
context of a “normal” heterosexual  
“love” relationship.  

What is clear from the popular con-  
ception of love and the legal perspec-  
tive on heterosexual relationships is  
that both are male interpretations of  
the issues. In a “normal” heterosex-  

ual attraction/interaction, a man  
selects a woman, pursues her and  
procures (or obtains) her. A woman's  
rejection of a man’s attentions is not  
interpreted as a signal for him to stop,  
but to redouble his efforts. In the  
popular notion of romantic love, the  
woman eventually capitulates  
(although at times she must be  
forced). The men who harass women  
who have made it clear that they  

would like to be left alone respond in  
the ways that they have learned; they  
try harder. To them, their behavior is  
romantic, they are pursuing a woman.  
In effect, their behavior is by defini-  
tion typically heterosexual. The law  
makes it a principle not to intervene  
in the private lives of citizens. When it  
can be proved that love and/or a  
sexual relationship exists between a  
man and a woman, their relationship  
is no longer the domain of the state  
but is a private matter to be resolved  
between them as individuals. The  
state thus reinforces the male inter-  
pretation of a heterosexual relation-  
ship by making charges of sexual  
harassment inapplicable in the con-  
text of romance or love.  

What remains to be explained is  
what becomes of the women’s point  
of view. Women who are the victims  
of sexual harassment cannot convince  
their harassers or the courts of their  
interpretation of the situation. Wo-  
men’s resistance to unwanted male  
attention of any kind does not negate  
the existence of love in the eyes of the  
harasser or courts of law. Plainly  
spoken, women have no control,  
either personal or political, over the  
meaning of conditions that exist  
within a heterosexual relationship.  

It is in the light of the preceding  
that I judge the song ‘Every Breath  
You Take.’ This song potently ex-  
presses the male prerogative to stalk  
and watch a woman who has rejected  
him, to claim that she belongs to him,  
and all in the name of love. The song  
shows the fact that a man can behave  
with utter disregard for how a woman  
thinks and feels, for she has no con-  
trol, either over what he does or how  
he interprets the situation. As in the  
song, the only thing the woman can  
do to end his treatment of her is to go  
back to him; to capitulate, as the het-  
erosexual fantasy predicts.  

In “Rolling Stone” review of Police  
album “Synchronicity”:  
“As the narrator of “Every Breath You  
Take” tracks his lover's tiniest move-  
ments like a detective, then breaks  
down and pleads for love, the light  
pop rhythm becomes an obsessive  
marking of time. Few contemporary  
pop songs have described the  
nuances of sexual jealousy so chil-  
lingly.”  

A song such as “Every Breath You  
Take” helps us to ascertain the  
greatest impediment to the recogni-  
tion of the existence of sexual harass-  
ment in relationships between men  
and women; namely, romantic love.  
It turns out that what women regard  
as sexual harassment is often what  
men regard as “normal,” “romantic”  
behavior. However, courts of law  
retain a male point of view in that  
romantic love negates sexual harass-  
ment in heterosexual relationships.  
Therefore, given the discrepancy be-  
tween men’s and women’s concep-  
tions of the conditions that exist in  

December, 1983  

such relationships, the law does not  
recognize women’s point of view as  
reality. In this context, the rarity of  
convictions in cases of sexual harass-  
ment, battery and rape makes sense.  
The way that women are treated in  
both the public and the private  
spheres is a result of a system whose  
ideology is male. Male creations are  
reality, male interpretations are truth  
and a feminist viewpoint is consid-  
ered to have credence only in the  
realm of ideas. In this system wo-  
men’s point of view does not exist. As  
long as the separation of the private  
from the public sphere persists, as  
well as the placement of romantic  
love in the one and sexual harassment  
in the other, respectively, the two will  
continue to cancel each other out. It  
is women’s experience that what is  
called ‘love’ can be terrifying and  
life-threatening. We need to begin  
taking that fact seriously.  

From my viewing of the soap opera  
“All My Children,” August 29, 1983:  
Harold played “Every Breath You  
Take” to Brooke after he had kidnap-  
ped her. He said “This is my favorite  
song. Listen to the lyrics. They're about  
you (or It’s about you).” They were  
alone, when she began to protest, he  
said “Don’t talk, you'll ruin it.”  

DRUMS  

Skin-shivering rat-a-tat  
Beats patterns onto the air  

A hollow rolling rhythm  
Lifts me unexpectedly  

My insides pucker in delight  
Your mouth opening  

Your arms taut  

You leave that  

Metallic taste of the  

Cymbal sound  

Clinging to the roof of my mouth
