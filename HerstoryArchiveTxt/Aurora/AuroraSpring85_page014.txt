Poem for Father

I used to think I ate as a woman  
stuffing in the muffins stealthily  

as women are wont to do  

passing time nervously  

and with waste  

but now I think of my father  

how he comes home each night after six  
and wants his dinner  

eating quickly and purposefully  

how each year his belly  

loops a bit more over his belt  

how he smiles sheepishly  

as he tells me he is hungry  

after the cool afternoon raking leaves.  
There is always a reason for his particular hunger  
hard work  

a light lunch  

fire on the tracks and a delayed train  

or that crisp arctic air that touches the dusk in winter.  

All and any reason  
but that he hungers after something never given.  

My mother knows how to feed herself  
has cooked for all of us since we began  
makes sure each meal holds itself  
contained and balanced  

yellow green white and red  

but my father has never really understood  
how it all works  

these things one does with food  

to make it possible to eat  

he would rather eat canned than frozen  
rather dump the contents in a pan  

turn the stove on high  

when she is away  

and he is alone among the neatly arranged implements  

where, what he needs  

always eludes him.  

He has come to depend on Tony  

who when tested by a thunderstorm  
made a hoagie in the dark.  

My father  

like the red-headed infant we both were  
thinks all hunger to be literal  

assuaged by a piece of bread.  

I have inherited his love for poetry  
and the persuasiveness of a word  
his excellence  

and some of his humor.  

And his hunger  

which is hard to find a place for.  

It seethes  

turns itself out  

dislocating from the places I put it.  

I have identified it as a womanly problem  
the reaction of a female  

in this later stage of patriarchy  

where food is a substance  

with which we anxiously police our lives  

but when I think of my father  

closing his study door to us after dinner  
begging our silence to listen to an opera  
more recently watching the Sunday ball game  
with sherry and a pretzel in the empty den  
slowly growing larger  

slower  

and eager to retire  

I think of the hunger that once raged  

that now has become a habit of overeating  
the hunger and habit he has passed on to me  
I think of myself as my father’s daughter  
daughter with the father’s hunger  

and I remember that my mother has often told me  
I have a drive and determination  

that has always escaped her.
