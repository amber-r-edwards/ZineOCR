On the afternoon of June 22, 1985,
at the Sisterfire music festival which
was held at Takoma Park Junior High
in Takoma Park, Maryland, women of
color moved in close to the front of
the Main Stage in anticipation of seeing
Edwina Lee Tyler and A Piece of
the World perform. As the group
moved to the stage, the women in the
area in front of the stage rose. They
were informed by Sisterfire security
that they were obstructing the view of
the differently abled women who
came to Sisterfire. The women sat
down. One woman could not sit
so moved was she by the rhythms. Ibi
Lola Bruce moved to the fence and
danced to the rhythm of the drums.
She was forced away from the stage by
Sisterfire security forces—Black women
and white women—who pounced on
her as if she were a criminal. They in
fact treated her response to the music
as a criminal act. So outrageous was
this hostile convergence on Ibi Lola
Bruce, as was the hostility exhibited
toward the women who sat on the
ground, close to the stage, that Edwina
Lee Tyler stopped in the middle of the
performance to declare:

Let me explain something to the ladies
by the fence. We've gotten away from
our heritage. Let me explain it to you.
When somebody gets happy, you don’t
stop them in church, do you? This is
ours. Do you understand? This is

ours! When somebody gets happy,
you just make sure they don’t hurt

themselves. You let them go on! Do
you understand that? Don’t be afraid
I'm not evil and my hands are not evil
and nobody on this stage is about evil.
All we're doing is getting what we
deserve—a little energy from our
heritage, and we're asking everybody
to join in.

Later, Edwina Lee Tyler and A
Piece of the World moved into the

audience, among the women on the

front line, among the differently
abled, among the women who sat
further out in the crowd.

This issue of Between Our Selves is
dedicated to Ibi Lola Bruce, Edwina
Lee Tyler and A Piece of the World,
the sisters who sat on the front line,
and all women who are being met/have
been met with racism and hostility as a
result of cultural and spiritual
expression. Continue to celebrate!

REFLECTIONS OF NAIROBI PAR A
STATEMENT TO ALL BLACK
SOUTH AFRICAN WOMEN

Last week I was visiting the Hirshhorn
Gallery in Washington, D.C., and I
came upon a work of art that re-
minded me so much of the Black
South African Women who came to
the Nairobi Conference. The work en-
titled “Wisdom Supporting Freedom,”
made such an impression upon me I
would like to share my observations
with you.

The impact for me was not of size

wisdom understands the tiring jour-
ney of freedom is captivating.

The figure freedom, where she has
been and the suffering she has seen
and experienced can be left only to
the imagination of the observer. For
me wisdom can only be supportive, for
the struggle for freedom is never end-
ing.

One can come out of the struggle
for only a while. We need to support
one another so that when we need rest
and comfort from the struggle, the
arms of wisdom will keep us from
falling.

May wisdom support you in your

because the bronze statue is only two
feet tall. The impact was that the
statue is of the gender female with

freedom being nude and collapsing in-
to the arms of wisdom. The artist,
Aimé Jules Dalou, portrays the most
supportive posture of wisdom even in
the facial expression. The feeling that

struggle.
