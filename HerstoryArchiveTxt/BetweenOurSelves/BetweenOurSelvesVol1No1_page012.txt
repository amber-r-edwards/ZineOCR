Sisterfaces

Sisters speaking

Annette Pelaez/Sisterfaces, Photo Journalist/

Picture Editor and Co-Founder of

SISTERFACES (a photographic collective

of women of color).

Sisterfaces believes that the movement
of women of color in all aspects of our
struggle for self-determination is a
growing force that must be documented
and made visible. The project also offers
a new opportunity to women of color
photographers through its photographer’s
collective. Sisterfaces, a project of the
Third World Women’s Archives, is hoping

that the many sisters out there who
are photographers will be able to take
advantage of this chance to work
artistically and in sisterhood. Women
who are interested in participating in
the Women of Color Photo History
Project should write to them at: P.O.
Box 2651, Peter Stuyvesant Station,
New York, NY 10009.
