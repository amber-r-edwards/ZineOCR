struggle against Zionism.” The United
States’ report said, “We’re not sure
what this had to do with discrimina-
tion against women.” .. [It was not a
fluke, and we said it again in 1980

" [Copenhagen Conference] to prove it.

. . First of all, I should deal with
the issue of Zionism. I’m not afraid to
say that word, I’m not afraid to say
that we as African women need to be
clear on who our friends and enemies
are, and any government that supports
the government of South Africa... we
cannot do anything else than
condemn. And the government of
Israel is that government. So, we’re
clear that apartheid in South Africa
looks like what they’re doing to the
Palestinians on the West Bank of Israel,
of Palestine. 

The World Conferences for women
condemned the human rights records
of Chile, El Salvador, Haiti. They
praised the work of the Sandinistas,
the Cubans, and the fighting Moroccan
administration in the western Sahara.
Of course, these are all very much in
opposition to the U.S. political posi-
tion on these countries.

. . The U.S. is frankly outnum-
bered in its vote against the progres-
sive issues that take place at these
world conferences. The program of
action that we passed at Copenhagen
was passed at a vote of 139 countries
to 9, and the U.S. and eight of its allies
were that 9. Now it [U.S.] is trying to
make itself a powerful minority by
forcing the use of the consensus pro-
cess and establishing the power to
veto things even if you have a very
small minority.

The U.S. is establishing some real
barriers to assure that its most militant
segment from the U.S. doesn’t get
there, as well as putting political
pressure on other countries to try and
keep certain political forces out.

Who is being targeted? As a foot-
note, this is my own analysis after put-
ting together three years' worth of
facts and information and two rooms
full of documentation. I think who
they are going to target are people
who stand in solidarity with the PLO,
women who stand in solidarity with
ANC, the BCM, the PAC and SWAPO,
women who stand in solidarity with
the European Black women, who are
part and parcel of the European peace
movement. . . They are singling out
Lesbians... saying lesbianism is not an
issue... and has no place at this con-
ference... Which is anti-historical
because the Mexico City conference
and the Copenhagen conferences had
considerably time played to Lesbian is-
sues.

We are going to be there, raising all
the issues they would rather not dis-
cuss, exposing all the real truths about
the conditions of black people in this
country that they would rather not be
known, exposing all the myths about
the media distortions that we suffer
under as Black women. . We are going
to be over there creating a problem for
U.S. foreign policy. That’s the bottom
line and they don’t want us there. . ..

(Continued from Page 9) ;
A: When are you planning on going
back?

AZ: I am hoping to go back at the
end of the summer for a short visit.
A: I agree that we must not sever
our connection to the Arab world.

AZ: I would emphasize that the femi-
nist movement, the white middle-class
feminist movement at trying to set the
priorities is an attempt, whether in-
tended or not, to sever us from our
roots. And we should not accept that.

And furthermore, it’s a very serious
attitude because let me point out to
you, for example, that Beirut was
bombed with American bombs and the
destruction in Beirut was brought a-
bout by American weapons. I would
like to see this anti-war movement for
Lebanon in the U.S. I haven’t heard a
voice. Not even in the NWSA (Na-
tional Women’s Studies Association)
during the bombing, did they pass a
resolution condemning the bombings.
What is this? [It’s] what I call an
orientalist attitude, even in the wo-
men’s movement, of looking at us like
we are an inferior other, as if our lives
don’t count, as if our problems don’t
count. That is not the essence of femi-
nism as I understand it. And I suggest
that American white women have a lot
of work to do to convince us that they
are concerned about us and are as true
to feminist principles as we take them
to be.

A: And on that same note, I think
that it is important for us to develop
more ties with women of color. If we
look at Black women in this country,
for instance, generally speaking, of
course, we will see how they have been
the ones over the years, and not just
since 1982, the ones who've come out
vocally in support of Palestinian and
other Arab people’s struggles.

AZ: And there is good reason for
that. They have undergone the same
kind of devastation of the family, of
their social and cultural fabric, of their
possessions in this country as the Pale-
stinians and the Lebanese have under-
gone back home. And the same thing
with the American Indian woman, the
Chicana, and other Third World wo-
men of color in the United States, and
their roots in Third World countries.
Therefore, they are in a perfect position
to understand exactly what we are talk-
ing about. While I am trying to illus-
trate to the white American woman
how vicious patriarchy can be, the
imagination of that woman is limited
because she has not seen that destruc-
tion. And if she sees it, she will realize
what a great danger she is ultimately in
when she becomes dispensable to this
society.

A: But the difference is that she is
a white woman and in this country

she has power, too. And to under-
stand that she would have to go
through a lot of changes.

AZ: I would say that she has to go
through those changes before calling
herself a feminist.
