Filipina women. ..

{Continued from Page 5)

In addition, the government officially re-
gisters 100,000 “hospitality girls,”
young women employed by travel
companies to “entertain” male tourists.
In the Philippines, women are used to
sell the country.

Some Filipina women are fortunate
enough to escape these conditions.
Either by joining the ranks of migrant
laborers—the Philippines’ most signifi-
cant export earner, migrant workers
bring home over $400 million a year—
or by finding a foreign husband, they
earn a ticket abroad.

Once in Europe and in the U.S.,
women take on domestic jobs. A
group of Filipina workers in Italy de-
scribe their lives this way: “Ours is a
life of sacrifice, of renunciation, of ex-
ploitation, and of constant danger of
losing our national and cultural iden-
tity. We are not in Italy to prostitute
ourselves. Our prostitution is the pro-
stitution of those who sell their own
labor, their own time, and their free-
dom.”

Filipina women are 50% of the mail
order bride industry. Here, they are
marketed among single U.S., European,
and Japanese men. They are billed in
Psychology Today, Atlantic Monthly,
and The Nation as highly capable of
pleasing a man. They are reduced to
smiling samples of “exotica erotica”
(as a friend aptly puts it), mere diver-
sions for men who are tired of dealing
with women as “partners.”

In this light, reproductive freedoms
and the related issues that are high
priority for western feminists have a
ghostly, hollow ring. In the Philippine
context, the right to control one’s
body has become, broadly, a matter of
life and death. One horrifying fact is
that the same barbaric methods of a-
bortion that were used in the 1600s
now flourish in twentieth century
techniques. Male-dominated progres-
sive groups have conflated abortion
and population control programs tradi-
tionally enforced by development pro-
jects, thereby perpetuating the patriarchal
myths of women and their reproduc-

tive roles.

Meanwhile, 2,000 women die each
year from giving birth. Mothers are
often under 20 years old, and have
consecutive pregnancies (“Junior in
January and Delia in December” is a
common phrase). Eight percent of
pregnant women suffer from nutri-
tional disorders like anemia and goiter.
Folk prescriptions surrounding preg-
nancy and childbirth reflect a wide-
spread awareness of the difficulties
that are the norm for women.

Even when lip service is paid to the
emancipation of women, the imba-
lance of wealth in the country strikes a
brutal contrast. The daughter of a rich
man can be sent abroad for a safe
abortion. A slum girl can look only to
the barrio for help.

The point is that Filipina women
are dealing with much more than dis-
torted cultural values, or the perverse
sexual morality instilled by the Roman
Catholic Church. The problem of ma-
ternal poverty and death, and the lack
of choice around pregnancy, has its
social and economic policy dimensions,
too. In the absence of basic human
rights, reproductive freedom remains
an empty catchword.

In many ways, western feminism
has much to learn from the experience
of Filipina, and other third world,
women. Prostitution, rape, and sexual
abuse will continue to be crucial pro-
blems for Filipina women. But much
more barbarous has been the raping of
the country and the violation of an
otherwise peaceful human existence.
Cunning and cruel, President Marcos
has prostituted the entire nation, build-

ing monumental tributes to himself
out of the blood and sweat of the
people, while the First Lady Imelda
makes herself notorious for her greed
and unabashed depravity. And as the
resources of the nation are mutilated
and destroyed, the U.S. government
frantically considers its “options” re-
garding the dictatorship.

But for the Filipino people, the
only option is resistance.
