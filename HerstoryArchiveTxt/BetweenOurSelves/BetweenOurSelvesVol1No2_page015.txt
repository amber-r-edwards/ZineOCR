Be-bop Betty Carter, formerly  
known as Lillie May Jones of Flint,  
Michigan, is a timeless lady. For 4 de-  
cades she has been the favorite of music  
connoisseurs, those of us who know  
when a vocalist can blow. She’s shared  
spotlights with folks like Ray Bryant,  
Oliver Nelson, Ray Charles, Lionel  
Hampton, Miles Davis, King Pleasure,  
and Sonny Rollins as the musician’s  
singer. Using her voice as if it were a  
musical instrument, she adds a new  
lyrical dimension to even the oldest  
standards. When listening to her velvet  
vocals you are bathed with an unforget-  
table electric vibration. So novices  
and old friends take the plunge. I give  
you:

BETTY CARTER

Q: How many years have you been in  
the music business?

A: About 40 years, making money.

Q: Where and how did you begin your  
singing career?

A: I won an amateur show contest in  
Detroit and I got my ego all revved up.  
I thought I could do something on the  
stage. That’s when I started.

Q: What was the first band you sang  
with?

A: Lionel Hampton.

Q: Was this your first job in the busi-  
ness?

A: No that wasn’t my first job. That  
was my first job on the road. I had  
worked in some nightclubs in Detroit.  
I sat in with Charlie [Parker] and  
Dizzy [Gillespie] when they came to  
Detroit. We had trios. We had groups  
to work with, house bands. I worked  
in Ohio, in Pittsburgh, then I joined  
the band in 1948. I stayed with them  
two and one half years, then I came to  
New York in 1951.

Franklin or Chaka Khan. I mean,  
those are some very strong ladies.  
Diana Ross, Gladys Knight. It’s very  
difficult for someone like me who  
never was in that sort of environment,  
musically, to do that just to make a hit  
record. It sounds like exactly what  
happened. You did that just to make  
a hit record. It’s not honest and it  
comes off that way. I wouldn’t  
attempt to alter myself to become  
commercial and get a hit record. It  
would be a shame for me. I know I  
couldn’t do it and sleep. The people  
who have stuck by me all these years  
really wouldn’t appreciate it. They’d  
say “Well, Betty finally did it too” and  
they really wouldn’t dig it, I don’t  
think.

Q: What songs have you written?

A: I’ve written a few but not anything  
anybody’s going to remember, you  
know, like a hit record. Not anything  
anybody sang but me. I wrote “Open  
the Door” on United Artists and “I  
Can’t Help It.” Those are probably  
the most well-known tunes I’ve writ-  
ten.

Q: How do you select your material?

A: I know that most young kids never  
heard of the old standards that I do. I  
try to pick unique old standards. I  
pick the kind of tune that is not done  
too much so that it will still be new to  
my generation and I know that the  
younger generation hasn’t heard it. I  
want it to be lyrically good enough so  
that I can do my improvising safely. I  
select them slowly and deliberately. I  
take my time. I don’t really rush into  
a song.

Q: Do you arrange any or all of your  
material? If yes, alone or with a band?  
A: Yes. I arrange practically every-  
thing, by myself, then we rehearse it.  
Any ideas they give me to improve on  
it or move it around are welcome. But  
most of the format I usually put.

Q: Why do you perform?  
A: ‘Cos I love it. It’s what I want to  
do.

Q: A lot of so-called “jazz” musicians  
have slid into “jazzy” pop or soul or  
disco styles, crossover music. What are  
your feelings about this new trend?

A: Well, it’s for the money. The jazz  
that I know, the atmosphere and en-  
vironment, is not like it was. The at-  
mosphere calls for being produced. It  
calls for being mixed up with a lot of  
electronic instruments to sell records.  
That’s what it’s all about, selling re-  
cords and making money. Trying to  
make that big hit.

Q: Have you altered your style any?  
Will you alter it in the future?

A: Alter it?!! How can I do that?  
Most people who have a style when  
they attempt to alter it to go com-  
mercial . . . it’s very difficult. I don’t  
think it’s easy for Sarah Vaughan to  
alter her voice to sound or be as com-  
mercial as say a Natalie Cole or Aretha  
Franklin.

it or move it around are welcome. But  
most of the format I usually put.

Q: Where did you get your musical  
training?

A: I got it with Hamp [Lionel  
Hampton]. When I was with him, I  
learned how to write orchestrations.  
It comes in handy.

Q: As a mother, has it been difficult to  
pursue your music career while raising  
two children?

A: No. It just works. I mean, I wasn’t  
trying to be overwhelming, rushing out  
there to do a lot of crazy things that I  
didn’t know anything about. I did  
what I knew best and I had a lot of  
people that helped me on the way.  
Ray Charles gave me a job. Miles Davis  
gave me a job. Cecil Taylor gave me a  
job. Then a writer wrote an article on  
me in the Village Voice, in 1975, out  
of the clear blue sky that I never asked  
for. It started a momentum. Japan  
was opening up. It was because of the

fact that I did hang in there with what  
I knew best and did best, that I got  
better. I improved as I got older. My  
musical ability got wider. So it wasn’t  
like most people think about paying  
dues. Though there have been times I  
didn’t have the rent. There have been  
times when the money was short and  
the bread just wasn’t there. It has  
been like that. But, I’ve never had  
another job. I never was on welfare  
and I’m buying my second house. I’ve  

world. I would have had to compete  
with them. A lot of female instrumentalists  
were reluctant to sit in. We  

didn’t have a whole lot of them who  
sat in, who went out with their saxes  
in their hands sittin’ in. There are a  
lot of piano players and organ players  
but there aren’t a lot of horn players -  
that really stuck out there. There’s  
Melba Liston who was with Dizzy for  
a while. She’s an arranger. I know  
that there are a few girls, Janis a trom-

raised 2 kids, one 24, one 20. Really,  
I’ve had a lot of help. A lot of support.

Q: Have you found it more difficult  
for a female artist to make it in the  
music business? A Black artist?

A: Not as a singer. Maybe if I had  
been an instrumentalist and had to  
compete with men, it might have been  
difficult. But that would have been  
what I had to do in order to be in their  

per player. Vi Redd [saxophonist] is  
teaching in California right now. She  
doesn’t really come out much anymore. You have to do the same thing  
they [men] do if you're an instru-  
mentalist. You can’t ask for the  
laurels if you can’t pay the price. You  
can’t sit around and say I’m a woman.  
I can’t do it. Snarl at those guys and  
learn your changes. Do what they do  
and one of you might come through.
