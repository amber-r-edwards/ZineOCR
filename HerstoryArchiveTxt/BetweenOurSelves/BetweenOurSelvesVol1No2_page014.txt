Po POETRY CORNER,  
Poems by Mila Aguilar  

UNDERSTANDING PRISON  

One can always  
not understand.  
The croaking of  
a hundred toads  
can muffle  

even the silence,  
and the hum  

of steady,  
unending rain  
can silence  

even my croak.  
One chooses  
what to hear  
and then again  
what one hears  
one can silence  
because  

one has chosen -  

Prison is  

a double wall  

one of adobe  

the other  

so many layers  

of barbed wire  
both formidable.  
The outer wall  

is guarded  

from watchtowers.  

PIGEONS FOR MY SON  

I gave the boy  

a pair of pigeons  

born and bred  

in my harsh prison.  

They had taped wings,  

and the instructions were  
specifically  

to keep them on for weeks  
until they'd gotten used  

to their new cages.  

He never liked  

the thought of me  

in prison, his own mother,  
and would not  

stay for long  

on visits.  

So perhaps I thought  

of souvenirs.  

But the tape from his pigeons  
he removed one day,  

and set them free.  

You'd think  

that would have angered me,  
or made me sad at least  

but I guess we’re of one mind.  
Why cage pigeons  

who prefer free flight  

in the vaster, bluer skies?

a dent in the pocket because Luneta  

Park is far away and there are five of -  

us. We boycotted the election. We  
didn’t see any point to it - it was  
rigged. The boycotters, the students,  
are marching to Mendiola quite  
often these days. If I could join them  
I would, but my work limits my parti-  
cipation. At the height of demonstra-  
tions, I was feeling bad staying in the  
office. Just your presence is impor-  
tant. At first Vic was against my join-  
ing. On the last anniversary of martial  
law, he did not want me to go to the  
march in Liwasang Bonifacio! He  
was afraid of violence. I absented my-  
self from the office. Five of us went.  
It’s sad how people can be so cold to  
what’s happening. Maybe when they  
have not felt the effects personally  
yet, they can’t feel for others. So I  
went. Vic could not stop me. Then  
one day I saw him at a rally. I was so  
happy.  
I’m not worried about the situation  
in the country. The economy, yes.  
But chaos I don’t worry about too  
much. Except if Marcos tries a show  
of force again. Look what happened  
yesterday. The government insists  
that the students provoked violence. I  
say that’s not possible because I’ve  
participated in demonstrations and I  
know how peaceful and organized  
they are. If you’ve been there you’d  
never believe in what is said about  

SPRING/SUMMER 1985  

students’ violence. Those students  
practically give up their lives and we  
just sit here - and watch them. So I’ve  
been telling the children that they  
should get involved although it will  
scare me to death. I will be afraid be-  
cause they should get involved al-  
though it will scare me to death. I will  
be afraid because they are my children,  
but better than having children who  
are smug and uninvolved. You have to  
give a part of yourself. You have to be  
a stone to remain detached. I was in  
the States last year (I won a round-  
trip ticket in a raffle) and I told my  
friends in New York that one of my  
most wonderful experiences was see-  
ing all of these things happen in the  
Philippines. Not in my wildest dreams  
did I imagine so many people filling  
the streets and standing up as one.  

I don’t know much about imperialism,  
but maybe it means support for the  
election. Like the U.S. manipulates  
the moves. It’s so hard to say that we  
should be left alone because we also  
need money. But the conditions im-  
posed are not going to make life here  
any better. For example, to devaluate  
the peso. It’s so bad for the people.  
If we are having such a difficult time,  
what more those who are way, way  
down?  

I could very easily get us all pass-  
ports so we could run to the States.  
My friends have been urging me to do  
so. I do not visualize uprooting my  
family by going there. Maybe I'll eat  
my words, but I hope it doesn’t come  
to that.

Like I was telling you, this is the  
worst experience we’ve gone through.  
What I pray the Lord is that we'll  
always be together through thick or  
thin. This has been our first test.  

Sometimes it is so tempting to leave  
for the U.S. where one dollar will give  

you how much, P23. If I earned over  

$1000, and if I can remit over half of  
that here, we will do all right. The  
peso is likely to go down even more.  
But I hold back. I hope it doesn’t  
have to happen. My best friend Tessa,  
that’s what drove her to leave her fam-  
ily for the U.S. I told her I’m not as  
strong as she is.

Mendiola is located a few streets away

become one of the places where huge  
numbers of anti-Marcos protesters  
gather.
