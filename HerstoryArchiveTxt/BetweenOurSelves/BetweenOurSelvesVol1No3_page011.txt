Nona Hendryx: vocalist and songwriter

From one of many in a Trenton  
ghetto Nona Hendryx has grown into a  
solo rock star. From gospel choirs in  
Jersey, cabarets in London, Bluebelles  
and Labelle she has emerged with a  
hot new sound.

For many years Nona was the pulse  
behind the now defunct Labelle.  
Those ladies who soared over  
everything from rainbows to marma-  
lade for 16 years. She wrote most of  
their songs, music and lyrics. Now she  
is weaving funky rock/rhythm sounds  
for herself.

Ms. Hendryx is different. Unlike  
many of the contemporary song-  
writers we are bombarded with who  
continuously advocate makin’ love and  
shakin’ booty she spreads naked news  
and raw views about life’s ups and  
downs, where they take us and what  
they make us become.

Nona is also a unique performer.  
When she is on stage one feels an all  
consuming need to communicate her  
messages to the audience, which she  
does with much flair and lightning  
bolt energy. Nona’s presence on and  
off stage is so real you can taste it. So  
open your minds and partake of her  
aura.

It’s a muggy May afternoon. There  
are hints of summer movin’ in. I'm at  
the midtown Manhattan offices of her  
production company layin’ for Nona.  
Her many career phases are spread out  
before me in photographs. From  
Labelle jammin’ that “space music”  
and the Positively Black theme to the  
picturesque posters that announced  
Nona’s various solo performances. Her  
magical, musical self is layin’ with me.

- Soul here, body comin’. Then  
suddenly, she enters flashin’ that  
impish smile and cuttin’ those intense  
eyes, as she perches across from me  
and warmly speaks her truth.

school. One day Sarah’s [Dash]  
church came to visit our church. We  
swapped choirs sometimes. She heard  
me sing. That was the first Sunday  
that I sang the lead on a song. She  
asked me to sing with a group she had  
called the Delcapris because one of the  
girls had left or something and that’s  
where it began. Even then it was just

“So I was singing for, I imagine the need to communicate.  
The need to lose some of the shyness...”

Q: How long have you been in the  
music business?

Nona: I guess 24 or 25 years. I’m not  
sure anymore. You begin to lose track.  
As far as in the business side of it. I  
think I’ve only been in the business 15  
years. The other 10 years were spent  
having a good time and not really  
stretching myself as much as I could  
and exploring the world of music that  
I was in. I’ve spent the last 15 years  
doing that and trying to gather  
together whatever forces that I could  
as far as my creative energy and place  
that and make that my priority.

Q: Where and how did you begin sing-  
ing?

Nona: It’s the age-old story. I was  
singing in church. I was singing in the  
school choir also. Singing was not my  
ambition. My ambition was to be a  
history teacher. Preferably ancient  
history. So I was singing for, I imagine  
the need to communicate. The need  
to lose some of the shyness I had in

for fun, something to do after school  
or on weekends. One of the girls in  
the group’s mother knew the man who  
was managing Pat’s [Patti Labelle]  
group and she asked him to audition  
us and see if he wanted to manage. We  
went and that’s where we met Pat.  
But we didn’t get together to form a  
group then. It was not until I guess  
about 7 months later. I got this call  
saying a man wanted a girl group to  
record a record. I had to ask my  
mother and my mother said, “Well,  
okay, but you know I don’t want you  
singing rock and roll.” And I said,  
“Oh well, you know it’s just fun,” and  
I went. Pat was one of the persons he  
called and Sarah was the other person.  
We started out just the three of us.  
Cindy joined the group 4 months later  
because the record took off and he  
wanted us to go on the road.”

Q: When you were with Patti Labelle  
and the Bluebelles and then Labelle,  
did you envision yourself becoming a  
solo artist?

Nona: As a solo artist. No. I was  
more interested in being a person  
behind the scenes. I liked being the  
songwriter in Labelle. I mean that  
was my place. That’s where I felt  
comfortable. But now I’ve gotten into  
being a solo artist. It was a big step  
for me because I couldn’t see myself as  
a solo artist without Labelle. We  
worked so well together.

Q: Was it difficult adjusting to being a  
solo act? What problems, if any, did  
you encounter?

Nona: My first show was in Belgium.  
The promoter had not put that I was  
going to be on the show, my record  
had not been released and I was the  
opening act for Peter Gabriel who is  
huge in Europe. Everything that you  
could dream of in a disaster, as far as a  
performance is concerned, happened  
to me that night. I figured if I got  
through that I could get through any-

movement, through the music. You  
change your moods that way.

Q: Are you concerned about making a  
positive statement to your audience?

Nona: Oh yes. I don’t think you  
should make any statement unless you  
can make it positive. I would assume  
that everybody knows the negative  
aspects of everything.

Q: Which is important to you when  
you write, music or lyrics?

Nona: It’s random. Sometimes the  
lyrics come first. I'll just sit down and  
write something because I feel that  
way. Or sometimes I'll just sit down  
with the piano or guitar and come up  
with a chord progression and then the  
lyric flows out of the feeling of the  
music and how it musically fits.”

Q: Your lyrics are very complex at  
times, poetic. Do you write poetry?

Nona: Yes I write more poetry than I  
do songs. I’m putting together a col-  
lection of poetry that I’ve written over  
the past, I guess, 20 years together  
into a book.

Q: What instruments do you like to  
predominate in your background  
music?

Nona: Piano and lead guitar. Per-  
cussion. But a different kind of per-  
cussion. Not your conga-latin thing  
happening all the time. We use  
concert toms, chimes, the gong and a  
lot of other things. I also like  
electronic instruments. The synthe-  
sizers. These are all things we’re using  
to create the music that we do. I use  
the synthesizer because I like strings. I  
love violins and violas and that can do  
it. It’s not an identical sound, but it’s  
very close.

Q: What other artists do you listen  
to? Who are your favorites?

Nona: I listen to a lot of people.  
Stevie Wonder of course. Aretha,  
Gladys Knight and the Pips. I listen to  
Foreigner and Journey, The Who, The  
Stones, Debussy, Vladimir Horowitz,  
Peter Gabriel. My  
favorites? Songwriter, because I have  
to categorize people that way, is a  
choice between Randy Newman and  
Stevie Wonder. They write great, in-

my place.”

thing else for the rest of my career. I  
think most people would have said  
“No; Fuck it! Goodnight! Thank you  
anyway!’ But the people were re-  
ceptive. I think they understood the  
conditions under which I was working  
and they were receptive. Even though  
I know half of them didn’t understand  
English, they were open to the music.  
It’s the music. It’s the feeling. It has  
nothing to do with the lyric communi-  
cation. You communicate through  

credible music. My favorite artist?  
Singer. I would have to say Aretha  
Franklin. Musician. There are so  
many people that I like. It’s hard for  
me to say, but I would have to say  
Debussy as a piano player. I like a lot  
of guitarists. I like B.B. King and I  
love Eddie Martinez’s guitar playing.  
It’s incredible. Jimi Hendrix. My  
musical tastes run very wide and very  
far. There are a lot of people. In say-  
ing who I like, I may not think of
