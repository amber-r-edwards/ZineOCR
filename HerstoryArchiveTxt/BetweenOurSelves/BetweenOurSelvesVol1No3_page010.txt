FALL/WINTER 1985

Edwina Lee Tyler—an interview

By Aida Wakil  
Copyright 1985  
When Edwina Lee Tyler and A  
Piece of the World were scheduled to  
appear at Sisterfire (1984), it rained that  
day. So, they couldn't perform on the  
Main Stage. We had to move to the  
tent. Most of the women didn't get a  
chance to witness the power that these  
women had to give to us. But those of  
us who were over there, in the tent, we  
witnessed that at the moment that  
they came to the stage, the sun came  
out. The sun came out. THE SUN  
CAME OUT, . .and it stopped raining.  
You see what I mean when I say these  
women have power.

and A Piece of the World by Hattie  
Gossett at Sisterfire 1985,

Between Our Selves talked to Edwina  
Lee Tyler, shortly before she and A  
Piece of the World were scheduled to  
perform at Sisterfire 1985. Sisterfire  
1985 was held in Takoma Park,  
Maryland just outside Washington, DC  
on June 22, 1985.

BOS: For many years, you've been  
teaching percussion and drum  
workshops in New York City. Tell us  
about your workshops.

I usually give classes to men in percus-  
sion and to women, I give workshops  
or private lessons in drumming. The  
reason why I’m doing it is because not  
enough women are playing congas that  
want to. And I’ve heard some of them  
and all they need is the technique—all

they need to do is “come out of the  
closet” as you say. They have been in-  
fluenced by the myth that women are  
not supposed to have drums. They are  
not supposed to have drums between  
their legs. The whole thing that I do  
with teaching is that in most tribes, in  
most circuits, for instance in New  
York, we may do one dance and they  
don’t do it in Philadelphia. It’s the  
same in Africa. You have one tribe  
that allows [women to play drums]  
and one tribe that does not. You have  
to respect that. I’ll use Haiti as  
another example. In Haiti, women who  
play the drums are master drummers.  
Master drummers are leaders of drums—  
like myself. We have gotten  
modernized and we call it directing.  
But, I’m a master drummer. A master  
African drummer is the leader of all  
the drums and is one who  
teaches—teaches: and must teach well.  
We try to teach the women that they  
can play drums and if they study they  
can play well. It’s not something that  
is just now being done. We're not the  
first. My thing is to fight for that.  
Also, it is to let Europeans know that  
even though we were not born in  
Africa, we are of African descent.

A woman once asked me why I  
picked drums. I didn’t pick drums, it  
was given to me. I don’t know when it  
started. My mother said three years  
old. They bought me a drum. It was  
something that was given to me and I  
use it because it makes me happy.  
Women who want to play drums  
should do it.

Sometimes music has to do with  
where you come from because from  
there you add on. I have an interna-  
tional workshop. Each woman comes  
from a different root. They don’t play  
like me, they're not supposed to. I  
give the technique and I give the  
rhythm and they are supposed to  
take it where they can take it. You  
are not supposed to play like me. I  
can’t play like you and you cannot  
play like me. If someone asks you  
what the traditional beat is—then you  
give it. Now when you go for your-  
self you go for yourself with the tradi-  

We have to share. You tell me about  
yourself as another nationality and we  
can get together.

BOS: What's your musical back-  
ground?

Not only do I come from an African  
background, but I come from a classi-  
cal background. My mother and  
father were classical opera singers. My  
brother and I are percussionists.  
Presently, I freelance and perform  
with jazz groups and some classical  
groups. I've played with chamber  
music groups and I've worked with the  
Dance Theatre of Harlem.

As I mentioned before, I'm coming  
from a classical background, too. I  
studied piano and was going to be a  
classical pianist. However, I'm a raw  
person. When the music makes me  
raw, it’s the bottom.

BOS: What do you want to be doing  
musically in the future?

In my house, my father only  
allowed classical and African music.  
When you went on the street, you had  
rock and roll, jazz, gospel, and  
spiritual. I'd like to take my music as  
far as an Afro-American has taken it in  
America and then go to Africa and go  
all the way up. Africa, spirituals, new  
jazz, contemporary music, rock and  
roll. I want to take it to its highest  
because I'm coming from all of those  
different spheres. I haven't come  
where I'm supposed to come, in order  
to reach what I’m supposed to reach.  
I know where I'm supposed to go and  
I have half of it done. I must go all  
the way to say that I have gotten it all  
done. I’m not satisfied yet.

BOS: When you play the drums, what  
are you feeling?

I can totally get into the drums and  
I can feel that I'm in a place that I've  
never been. I can imagine and build a  
whole world, which gets me into  
trouble, but I can build a world all my  
own. I want to take all the different  
kinds of music and do the same thing  
but take you with me. I don’t want to  
go to the drum and someone say ‘that  
was marvelous, but the other stuff was  
okay.’ I don’t want it to be okay.

BOS: And A Piece of the World?

It’s lovely working with A Piece of  
the World...We understand each other.  
There were seven, nine, now five, and  
five seems to be the number.
