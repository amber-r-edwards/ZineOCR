“ But Lossie, it’s the principle of the thing. Now  
some other girls will have the opportunity.”  

“Principle? Opportunity? Sounds like luck to me  
or some other tricky business.  
Working, got no place to live, their babies starving,  
everything a mess. So they throw us a Black Barbie  
doll on the t.v. Spare me. I ain’t buying.”  

“But Lossie, I always thought you was a race  
woman.”  

“Tam.”
