One Black American woman told  
me how a Black woman from Kenya  
thought she was white. That’s dif-  
ficult to handle when all your life  
you’ve been under someone’s foot for  
being Black in America.  

And mixed bloods and light  
skinned women of color found them-  
selves describing what it’s like to not  
quite be believed or accepted by most  
everyone.  

Perhaps the next international or  
even national conference on women  
will address some of those miscon-  
ceptions. Perhaps, too, the question  
of whether being Jewish is a separate  
race will be finally answered to every-  
one’s liking.  

For all the differences, the conflicts  
and hardships surrounding the con-  
ference, one thing is sure, women have  
the ball rolling and all the connections  
and support networks formulated at  
this conference are sure to have a  
tremendous impact on life in this  
world in the years to come. There will  
be no topic that women will not  
address, and there will be no solution  
unless the welfare of women, children,  
and men are given equal consideration.  

This was no bit of news for many  
of the delegates there, yet there  
seemed to be some denial voiced by  
“first worlders” and “third worlders”  
alike. Also, there were some women,  
though - surprisingly few, who com-  
plained about the political tenor of the  
conference. All were met with a  
barrage of information and/or evidence  
that continually proved the connec-  
tions of U.S. policy to oppression  
around the world.
