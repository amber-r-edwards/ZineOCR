WE ARE THE ONES....

The first issue of Between Our
Selves was titled “We are the ones
we’ve been waiting for.” The words
are from the last line of the poem
“Poem for South African Women,”
which was written by June Jordan and
published in her collection of poetry,
Passion, Beacon Press, 1980. The
staff of Between Our Selves would like
to apologize to Ms. Jordan for not
supplying the pertinent copyright
information.

Poem for South African Women

Commemoration of the 40,000 women and children who,
August 9, 1956, presented themselves in bodily protest against
the “dompass” in the capital of apartheid. Presented at The
United Nations, August 9, 1978.

Our own shadows disappear as the feet of thousands
by the tens of thousands pound the fallow land
into new dust that

rising like a marvelous pollen will be

fertile:

even as the first woman whispering
imagination to the trees around her made

for righteous fruit

from such deliberate defense of life

as no other still

will claim inferior to any other safety

in the world

The whispers too they

intimate to the inmost ear of every spirit
now aroused they

carousing in ferocious affirmation

of all peaceable and loving amplitude
sound a certainly unbounded heat

from a baptismal smoke where yes

there will be fire

And the babies cease alarm as mothers
raising arms

and heart high as the stars so far unseen
nevertheless hurl into the universe

a moving force

irreversible as light years

traveling to the open

eye;

And who will join this standing up

and the ones who stood without sweet company
will sing and sing

back into the mountains and

if necessary

even under the sea

we are the ones we have been waiting for

Letters

Dear Sisters:

Congratulations on a fantastic issue
of an exciting and interesting news-
paper. We have received numerous
notes from sisters around the nation
regarding your coverage of the Balti-
more Conference. The comments are
wonderful.

It makes me feel so good to see
newspapers, magazines, etc. emerging
and capturing our thoughts and feelings
as women of color. It is necessary that
we keep producing, analyzing, and
sharing in our loving, creative ways.

I wish you much success with your
publication. May you continue to
keep us informed.

Sisterly,
Byllye Y. Avery
