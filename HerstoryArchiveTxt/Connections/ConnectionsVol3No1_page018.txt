In the August issue of Connections you  
published an article titled, “Options in  
Nursing Education.” We felt the article  
gave a fair and accurate account of nurs-  
ing education offered in the Toledo area.  
However, there were statements concern-  
ing nursing that are debatable.

Connections stated that most of the  
R.N.’s interviewed expressed satisfaction  
with their profession. It would be of

interest to know how many years these  
“satisfied” nurses have been in the pro-  
fession. It has been our experience that  
R.N.’s who have been in the profession  
longer than seven or eight years are dis-  
satisfied and are looking to other fields for  
employment.

There may be people switching to the  
nursing profession, but there is also a  
great number of women leaving the  
nursing profession. If nursing offers bene-  
fits such as decent salary and fringe  
benefits, then why is there such a nursing  
shortage? According to the July 18 Wall  
Street Journal, “414,000 out of 1.4 mil-

lion licensed nurses have stopped work-  
ing. Job dissatisfaction—rather than  
child-bearing or a spouse’s relocation—  
accounts for most job-leaving by nurses.”

In addition to being paid a low wage in  
light of their skills and responsibilities,  
nurses are concerned about the lack of  
respect (by others) for the profession, the  
heavy workload and the work schedule  
which involves odd hours, weekends and  
holidays. R.N.’s are also frustrated be-  
cause they are usually caught in the  
middle of doctor-patient and hospital-  
patient conflicts. They have responsibility  
for the patients' well-being yet they have

no authority if the patient’s well-being is  
threatened.

In all fairness, nurses have to begin  
assuming some responsibilities for these  
drawbacks. R.N.’s must assume account-  
ability for themselves and their profes-  
sion.

Finally: quoting the July 18 Wall  
Street Journal, “Many nurses are un-  
happy and are no longer willing to be  
doctors’ hand-maidens, passively serving  
the sick.” To this we say AMEN.
