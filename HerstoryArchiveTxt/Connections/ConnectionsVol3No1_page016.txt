“It's a scary time — we have to be vigilant
and be as active as they are.” — Betty Morais,
executive director of Planned Parenthood, commenting on the increasing activity of a nationwide far-right coalition of those involved in the television ministry and those who are anti-abortion, anti-sex education and anti-gun control, who are working to defeat pro-choice incumbents and candidates.

“I'm excited about the fall conference. I
just hope they will take some of their own
advice and communicate better with their
own members.” — Dusty Rothman, membership and public relations committee member for Women Involved in Toledo, commenting on the WIT Nov. 15 conference, “Communication Network: Sending the Right Signals.”

“Hey, we’re important too. We can’t con-
tinue to procrastinate on providing vital ser-
vices to the taxpayers.” — City Council person
Donna Owens responding to Mayor DeGood’s
comments at a recent city council meeting that

involved in partisan politics and realize that
so many people equate integrity and kind-

and expediency with strength,” Alice Weber,
wife of Ed Weber, who is challenging Congress-
man Lud Ashley in the November election.

“I think it is imperative that we have an

buildings.” — Pat Holmberg, director of the
Child Abuse Prevention Center, whose office
has a diminishing view of the Toledo riverfront.
