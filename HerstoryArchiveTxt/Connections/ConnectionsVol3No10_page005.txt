Dare To Mix Not Match

Fashion this fall is more exciting and more  
innovative than it’s been in many a season,  
according to Madonna Corrigan of Lasalle’s.  
There are new proportions, new silhouettes  

by Halle Bruening  
loose tunics, tunics with skirts, dresses with  
tunics and tunics over pants. In short  
tunics can be worn with anything and  
everything!  

Gunmetal belts, gold tote bags and pewter  
pumps are a few of the possible ways to  
highlight your wardrobe with the metallic  
gleam.  

and wide choices of what to pair with what. Skirts are slightly gathered or bias-cut and  

flared for a new look and the divided skirt  
returns in soft, easy fabrics.  

Knickers and pleated trousers join tailored  
pants to offer choices in the pant department.  

Covering it all up is the “big wrap.” Capes,  
ponchos, shawls and serapes — outdoor  
wear that wraps around the body — are being  
shown with everything from jeans to dresses.  
Some are tossed over a shoulder, others are  
tucked into a belt. However, it is worn, the  
“big wrap” provides variety for each and  
every woman.  

The new shapes are made more exciting by  

Skirts — pants sweaters wraps  
blouses stockings shoes — bags — so  
much is new for fall. But what about what's  
old — and hanging in the closet?  

Ms. Corrigan offered several tips for the  
woman who wants to get the 1981 look by  
adding to her wardrobe.  

First, she said, a woman should look  
carefully at what she has and try to see it with  
an '81 eye. She should try mixing things in  
new ways and experimenting.  

After an honest appraisal — including what  
fits and doesn’t — she is ready to consider  
additions to her closet.  

She should shop, armed with the  
knowledge of what she has and what she  
needs, when she will not be rushed and when  
the stores will not be too busy. Sales people  
will be glad to chat and help, but not when  
they are frantically busy.  

Planning, looking around and thinking  
before making a purchase seem to be key  
steps in becoming a well-dressed woman in  
1981.

A silk shirt may top a pair of jeans or  
metallic pumps might polish off a daytime  
look. Anything goes! Ms. Corrigan noted,  
“This is the year to dare to mix, rather than to  
match.”  

Everything is softer looking than before.  
Feminine, face-framing “Lord Byronish”  
blouses trimmed with ruffles, bows and lace  
complement the new fuller skirts and pants.  
And of course the softer look is repeated in  
blouses and sweaters as well.  

This year’s sweaters do everything blouses  
do and are richer looking than ever before.  
Some are big and bulky, others fluffy and soft,  
but most are versatile enough to top jeans or  
cords by day and crepe pants for evening.  

Jackets will be important fashion items,  
Ms. Corrigan said, noting that the traditional  
blazer has been joined by the cardigan, the  
short boxy jacket, the tunic, the shorter fitted  
jacket and the blouson. The resulting variety  
means a style for everyone.  

A noteworthy return to the fashion picture  
is the tunic. There are tunic sweaters, tunics  
worn as blouses, tunic jackets, belted tunics,

the return of rich fabrics — silk, mohair, wool  
crepes and gabardine. Rich colors — loden,  
Reagan red and khaki — combine for a truly  
opulent look, Ms. Corrigan commented.  

She noted that loden is being worn with  
reds, pinks and pale blues, making it possible  
for more women to wear the rich green. And  

Nancy Reagan’s favorite red pops up in  

lingerie, stockings, shoes and belts.  

Gold — and its metallic relatives — are very  
important in fashion this fall. This trend, Ms.  
Corrigan noted, will continue through the  
winter and resort fashion seasons.  

These metallics — worn for day and  
evening — make accessories very big.
