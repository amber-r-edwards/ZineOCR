The Sunspace: It’s More Than A Room  

The Sunspace is more than a room. Put the glass wall to the south and it’s a solar  
collector that can reduce your home heating bill. Oriented east or west, a Sunspace  
with Window Quilt can produce as much heat as it uses.  

But the Sunspace is more than a solar room. It can be an all-season porch. A spa  
room. A recreation room. A greenhouse. Cedar beams, an insulated glass wall and  
Andersen windows combine the open feeling of a porch with the security and year-  
round use of a room addition.  

Sun Builders also designs custom solar  
rooms to reflect your home’s architecture and  
fit your leisure needs. Family rooms. Kitchens,  
Custom Sunspaces.  

Our carpenters are experienced in solar  
construction. Their craftsmanship and atten-  
tion to the details of energy efficient building  
could be found in your home. Call now for an  
estimate. Or, visit our showroom. See a  
Sunspace on display.
