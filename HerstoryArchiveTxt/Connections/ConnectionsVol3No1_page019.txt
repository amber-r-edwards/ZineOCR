Preschool  
Volunteers —  

Volunteers are needed  
to make home visits to  
families with preschool  
handicapped children up  
to 3 years old. The parent-  
to-parent volunteer pro-  
gram is co-sponsored by  
Toledo Public Schools and  
the High Scope Educa-

According to the pro-  
gram’s directors, the home  
visitors should be “caring  
individuals who are com-  
passionate listeners.”  
Home visitors will share  
information on child devel-  
opment and handicapping  
conditions and information  
about community resour-  
ces, while helping parents  
adjust to family life with a  
handicapped child.  

Volunteers should be  
willing to donate four to  
five hours a week, which  
will include training, visits,  
planning and travel. Travel  
and babysitting costs will  
be reimbursed.
