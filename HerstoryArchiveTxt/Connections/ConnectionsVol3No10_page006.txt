Risking what we have for something that
might be better is always terrifying. But there
are times when not taking a chance is even
more terrifying.

“I think we have to be desperate — or at
least acutely uncomfortable before we
make changes. I think human beings resist
change. We don’t seek it; we just get
uncomfortable enough to accept it,” said 28-
year-old Susan, a free-lance photographer.

“I took a chance when I became a free-
lancer, but I felt so empty and unappreciated
working for advertising agencies. In order to
survive, I had to try to make it on my own —
even if that did mean taking a chance.

“I didn’t choose photography, really. I
resisted as long as I could because free-
lancing is frightening. But I had no choice in
the end. It was either give it a try, or self-
destruct,” she said.

“I did it, and it’s working. But scared?” she
laughed. “I’ve never been so scared!”

Donna gave up what she had 15 years ago
when she walked away from an alcoholic
husband to raise two daughters alone.

“I agree with Susan,” she said, when we
met in a small New England town. “But I think
you have to like yourself, too. That’s
absolutely essential.

“If you don’t believe you’re worth anything,
you'll put up with whatever comes along —
you'll think it’s all you deserve,” she said.

“It took me five long years to say ‘No. No
more. I’m worth more than this. I don’t
deserve abuse.’ That’s a long time and a lot of
abuse,” she said in a low voice.

“I married when I was a senior in high
school and had never worked. I didn’t know if
I could support myself, let alone two children!
But I went to a grocery store and got a job as a
cashier. Then I moved out to a tiny apart-
ment.

“And somehow, we made it. Now, I’m the
manager of that store. I’m married again, too
— to a guy who doesn’t drink,” she said.

“I went through bad times, but if I hadn't
taken a chance, I wouldn’t have anything
now.”

For Marian, taking a risk meant giving up
her safe job as a bank teller to participate in
another bank’s management-training
program.

“I began to realize I had a pot of potential. I
wanted to grow, but nobody seemed willing to
give me a chance to do that.

“When the other bank offered me a job, I
had a hard time finding the nerve to quit the
job I had,” she said.

“I had seniority where I was. I had a safe job

~ I knew I could do it. And there were no
guarantees with the new job. I could have
been unemployed in a month and I knew it.

“But I knew if I passed up that chance, I
might never get another one.”

She paused and leaned back. Her eyes
twinkled. “That was three years ago and I
earn twice what I would be earning if I had
stayed,” she said. “We can learn to take chances by giving
ourselves credit for the little risks we take all
along — and all of us take them. Then when
the big risks come along, they won’t seem so
frightening,” she said.

“It's important to take risks and look
ahead. But it helps . . .
