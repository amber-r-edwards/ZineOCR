Three cities in Ohio—  
Cleveland, Cincinnati and  
Dayton—are among the  
12 cities nationwide whose  
office workers will benefit  
from a recent $200,000  
federal grant signed to  

“Working Women: Career”  

Association of Office  
Workers.  

The grant, which was  
awarded from the National  
Endowment for the Hu-  
manities, will fund a series  
of courses, research pro-  
jects, film forums and  
teacher training programs  
over a two-year period on  
the history and philosophy  
of the 14 million office  
workers in the U.S.  

Karen Nussbaum, director  
of Working Women,  
said she expects some  
6,240 office workers in the  
12 cities to participate in  
the program.  

Women’s  
Health  

The National Women’s  
Health Network, 2025 “I”  
Street N.W., Suite 105,  
Washington, D.C. 20006,  
has established a registry  
for women who have re-  
ceived a contraceptive by  

injection at any time dur-  
ing the past year to present  
an indication of how wide-  
spread the use of injectable  
contraceptives is, and to  

warn women of the poten-  
tial danger in using this  
form of birth control, ac-  
cording to a statement  
released by the network.  
Although this method of  
birth control may be con-  
venient, there are serious  
risks involved. The U.S.  
Food and Drug Adminis-  
tration has not approved  
its use and yet, according  
to the network, some fam-  
ily planning centers and  
doctors around the country  
are prescribing the drug as  
a contraceptive without  
warning women of the  
potential dangers of the  
drug.  

Last Hired;  
First Fired  

Black women remain  
last hired, first fired  
and the lowest paid group in  
the labor force, according  
to Dorothy E. Jones, coor-  
dinator of the Union Min-  
orities/Women Leadership  
Training Project.  

Black women, although  
employed, pay much more in  
taxes than unmarried  
working couples who live  
together.  

The bill has 232 co-  
sponsors and, according to  
Representative Fenwick’s  
legislative assistant Bob  
Grady, the bill has a good  
chance of being passed “if  
the Administration goes  
ahead with its plans for  
general tax cuts.”  

Crime  
Prevention  

Volunteers in Diversion,  
a new crime prevention  
group of the Lucas County  
Adult Probation Depart-  
ment, is seeking volunteers  
to help in providing special  
services to criminal offend-  

ers. Gena Dryovage, volun-  
teer program coordinator,  
said the program is design-  
ed to protect the commun-  
ity, reduce repeat offenses  
and divert property offend-  
ers from the prison system.  
Volunteers will work  
with paid staff to help  

facilitate the program and will undergo  
training at the adult probation de-
