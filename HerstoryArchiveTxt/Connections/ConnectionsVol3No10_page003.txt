Toronto Has Something  
For Everyone In Family  

Feeding the giraffes at the Toronto zoo.  

by Barbara Glowacki  

The next time the family’s decision about a  
vacation — or a weekend away — is torn  
between the kids agitating for a pool or a  
beach and an amusement park and the adults  
standing firm for shopping, the theater and  
eating too much good food — try Toronto,  
Canada.  

Three hotels there offer weekend packages  
for under $120 a person. The price includes  
railroad transportation from Windsor, two  
nights in the hotel and a $2.50 credit on  
breakfast which translates into juice, coffee,  
and a roll. The rest of the time you’re on your  
own for food, but Toronto has hundreds of  
restaurants ranging from fast food through  

ethnic to exotically expensive.  

The train ride is a treat, particularly for  
children who may not have ever been on one.  
Food may be purchased on the train, but as it  
is the concession stand variety, many people  
pack their own lunches for the five-hour ride.  

The Harbor Castle Inn (a Hilton), one of the  
hotel choices in the package, is on the  
waterfront, next to the ferryboat that  
transports most of Toronto across the harbor  
to the island beaches for swimming, boating  
and wind-surfing on the weekends. The  
people who live in Toronto take along huge  
coolers and chairs, but concession stands on  
the island sell or rent almost everything.  

If a fifteen-minute ferry boat ride is too far to  
go for a swim, the hotel has a large pool and  
sun deck. And Ontario Place, with pools,  
water sports, and amusement rides, is just a  
short bus ride away.  

The Harbor Castle Inn is close to down-  
town, but not in it, so the hotel offers free

shuttle service every fifteen minutes to the  
main subway station, to Eaton Center — a  
four-story enclosed shopping mall — and to  
some of the downtown government buildings.  

The subways — even late at night — are  
safe, clean and cheap. Taxicabs are safe,  
clean and expensive so nearly everyone uses  
the subway. Both are fast.  

A ten-minute subway ride will take you to  
Yorkville, a resurrected old neighborhood full  
of outdoor cafes, small boutiques and some  
Paris designer outlets. Most of the cafes have  
awnings so even on a rainy day the area has a  
distinctly European feeling with dozens of  
people sipping coffee, reading the newspaper  
and waiting for the rain to let up.  

The Four Seasons, a hotel in the Yorkville  
section, is a second choice offered as part of  
the train-hotel package. The question to  
answer however is do you want to ride the  
subway to go shopping or to go to the beach?  

A third hotel option is the Inn on the Park  
on the edge of town. It’s an $8 taxi ride or a  
thirty-minute bus/subway ride from the  
ferryboat, downtown or Yorkville, but offers  
an Olympic size swimming pool and badmin-  
ton and tennis courts. Across the street are  
hiking, jogging and bicycle trails and  
horseback riding through a park full of  
challenging hills. It’s also only half a mile from  
the Ontario Science Center, a hands-on  
museum that’s addictive even to nonscientific  
types.  

Toronto is a resort city with all the big city  
excitement that drew tourists to New York in  

the 1950s, Chicago in the 60s and San  
Francisco in the 70s.

Women’s Lib  

by Gail Whiting  

“I don’t NEED you anymore.”  
That doesn’t mean  

I don’t WANT to be with you  
Even for a Lifetime.  

But now I have a choice.  

An Irony  

by Gail Whiting  
At 21 she said,  

“I love you.”  
And he said, “I love you, too.  
“Let’s spend a lifetime together.”  

At 25 she said,  

“I’ve made a wonderful dinner,  

The floors are scrubbed  

And the furniture smells of lemon oil.”  
And he said,  

“I’ve already eaten.”  

At 30 she said,  

“Our son’s lost his first tooth.  

He’s been waiting up to show you.”  
And he said,  

“I’m flying to Boston tonight.  

It’s an important client.  

There’s nothing I can do.”  

At 34 she said,  

The reasons for staying together  
Become different  

When you recognize freedom  
And exercise choice  

“Don’t wait up.”  
You don’t stay together  

Because you need security  
Or food and shelter  

Or status  

Or even an emotional crutch.  
But you enjoy one another  
Or respect one another  

Or love one another.  

And you WANT to share your life.  

I love it here. No bad feelings of  
Why do we have to move? “I’m stuck.”  
And he said,  

Or “I’d rather, but.”  
You're together because  
You WANT to be.  

So why are men afraid  
Of women’s lib?  

“Because the job is in Toledo.”  

At 35 she said,  

“I’m going to be busy at the university  
tonight.  

Please feed the kids — I'll be late.”  

And he said,  

“I don’t feel needed anymore.”
