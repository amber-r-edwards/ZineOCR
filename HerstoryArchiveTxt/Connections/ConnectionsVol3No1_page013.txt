A friend and I are going into business  
together and I am concerned about the  
effect of this on our friendship. Any  
suggestions?  

Recognize that the new role of business  
partner will shift the focus of the friend-  
ship. Do you accept this? You can always  
get a business partner, but it’s not that  
easy to replace a good friend.  

If you decide to go ahead with it, clear  
the air by openly voicing your concerns. A  
candid exchange of concerns and differ-  
ences is important. Decide how you in-  
tend to deal with stress. Draw from earlier  
experiences as a team member (job,  
committee, etc.) What made it work for  
you?  

Be clear on your goals, long term  
(making lots of money) and short term  
(building a good reputation or whatever.)  
Write it all down and keep it. A creative  
idea that sounds frivolous now may be  
terrific next year.  

Don’t let irritations build up. Don’t lose  
your sense of humor. Do acknowledge  
yourself and each other for your courage.  
You deserve to be prosperous!  

I feel guilty when I ask my husband for  
extra money. What should I do?  

Forgive yourself for feeling guilty and  
then ask for the money. Being prepared  
and able to answer questions—what is the  
money for—will make it easier.  

Afterwards, acknowledge yourself for  
having the self-esteem to ask for what you  
want.  

My neighbor and I have always been  
close friends. Recently, I went back to  
work full-time and find my time is very  
limited. She is constantly calling and

coming over and I find that I can’t get  
anything done. I don’t want to hurt her  
feelings, but I’ve got a problem.  

Women often worry about hurting  
someone else’s feelings—a worry that  
may be unnecessary. Someone who likes  
you and cares about you will understand  
when you are too busy or want privacy.  
It’s up to you to speak up and make the  
first move. You can only be responsible  
for your own behavior. So decide what's  
most important to you—privacy or popu-  
larity.  

How someone responds to your being  
assertive tells you a lot about the friend-  
ship. If this is a new kind of approach on  
your part, you may want to simply say  
that, rather than send shockwaves  

through the neighborhood.  

I see so many workshops and seminars  
announced (assertiveness training,  
sensitivity, effectiveness), how can I  
choose?  

The self-improvement business is one of  
the fastest-growing in the country. Decide  
first why you want to go. Do you think you  
need it? Is it for fun or are you just bored? —  
Does it appear that the program will meet  
your needs? You will need to know the  
purpose of the seminar and the creden-  
tials of the leader. Pick one that sounds  
right for you and don’t be afraid to make a  
mistake. It’s a terrific way to learn,  
especially when you're paying for it.  
Money spent on self-improvement tech-  

niques is a good investment.
