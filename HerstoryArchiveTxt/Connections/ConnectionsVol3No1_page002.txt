TOLEDO WOMEN IN THE MEDIA.

Connections’ Section this month features Toledo Women in the Media—what their jobs are like, how they feel about their responsibilities to the community, what their plans are for the future, how they got into the communications field.

The section begins on our cover with an interview with WGTE-FM’s Essie Hobgood and continues on this page with Connections Publisher Su Yeager. Women In Communications National President-elect, Kathy Lewton and Channel 24’s News Anchor Rosemary Collins are featured on pages 6 and 7. Photographs were done by Connections.

From Radio Jingles to Printer’s Ink

When Suzanne White Yeager, publisher of Connections, began her career as a journalist—writing the 10 o’clock news for KOMU-TV in Columbia, Missouri—little did she know that in 10 short years she would be publishing her own newspaper. In fact, newspapers were not even a part of her goal. She wanted to write radio jingles for the Leo Burnett Co., a Chicago advertising agency.

A move to Toledo, prompted by her husband’s job, heralded a change in Ms. Yeager’s goals. Discovering that she could make twice as much money working for the local newspaper as she could on a television station, Ms. Yeager joined the staff of the women’s news section of The Blade—and loved it!

From that time on, printer’s ink was in her veins and she stuck with the newspaper business. After several years of reporting experience on The Blade, the Virginia Gazette and the Toledo Times, Ms. Yeager decided that she wanted her own paper. But finding the right format and planning exactly how it would happen took about two years.

During a two year stint at the University of Toledo teaching journalism, Ms. Yeager collected pieces from other papers, and the idea of her own paper began to take shape.

Finally in September 1978 Connections was born—and just like with any new “baby”—unthought-of problems arose.

“So many women were afraid of ‘the paper,” Ms. Yeager said. The paper, although directed to them, talked about things from which they wanted to insulate themselves, she continued. The local aspect of the paper frightened some of them, too. Reading about the same things—but in Chicago or New York—was easier to digest.

Another problem arose with advertisers. “The track record for publications in the Toledo market was not good; they thought we wouldn’t be around long, so wouldn’t make the commitment to advertise with us and advertisers are the part of a newspaper that makes the rest happen,” she said.

Staffing was another headache the fledgling publisher had to face in those early months. “Not many people are willing to make the commitment to work long hours for little or no pay,” she recalled. “People want instant pay back,” she added.

But the turning point came—and much sooner than expected—just 14 months after the first issue came off the press.

Now that things are running more smoothly, Ms. Yeager finds she has time to explore some of the aspects of publishing that interested her in the first place. “I am excited about the possibilities of new ventures and new technologies.”

The rewards? “Well, it’s not the money, but—it’s really neat to see something start as an idea at a staff meeting and grow into something you see tucked under somebody’s arm in the checkout line at the grocery store on your way home from work!” she said. “And to take a creative idea and find the people who can make it work—well, that’s done.”

With a successful career as a reporter, did she want all these headaches and hard work? She said, “I love hard work... and I’m willing to take on what others say can’t be done!”
