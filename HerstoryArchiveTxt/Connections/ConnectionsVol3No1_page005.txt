CYO Football Attracts Sixth-Grade Girl

The tie,

Seana

by Mary Kay Gleason

Number 19 streamed across the field in
the final play of the game in the St.
Clement Chargers’ 1980 debut perform-
ance at Waite High School stadium
during the annual CYO Round Robin
tournament.

Not even the opposing team could tell
that the second string linebacker was
Julie Zapadka.

Julie is the only girl among more than
1,000 Toledo area youth registered to
participate in the 1980 CYO football pro-
gram consisting of 38 parish teams,
according to Bill Sanford, associate direc-
tor of the Toledo diocesan youth depart-
ment.

“She is a strong and dedicated athlete,”
St. Clement coach Ron Layman said. “I
am delighted to have Julie on the team,”
he said.

Julie is one of the tallest members of
the team. She looks like “one of the guys”
on the field, displaying immense agility as
she plays.

At the pre-season weigh-in at the
Catholic Club, Julie, a sixth grader at St.
Clement School, weighed 77 pounds, one
pound below the average weight of the
rest of her parish team made up of 4th,
5th and 6th graders.

Practice for the cadet team
began on Aug. 18, but Julie did not come
and ask to join the team until nearly a
week later.

She said that she played football in the
neighborhood and suddenly decided to
join the team. “I don’t know why she
waited so long to come to practice. She
didn’t seem scared,” he said.

Layman said that Julie was warmly
welcomed at practice by her teammates,
many of whom are also her classmates.
Layman said that he was happy that she
asked to be put on the roster, adding that
he contacted the Toledo Troopers inquir-
ing about any special equipment that Julie
might need.

According to Julie’s mother, Mary Ann
Zapadka, Julie never openly expressed a
desire to join the parish football team.
Ms. Zapadka said that she was surprised
when Julie told her she had joined the
team, but Ms. Zapadka said that she was
not against the idea.

“I thought this was just another phase
of athletics Julie wanted to try,” she said.

Julie, like her four older brothers and
sisters, has always been interested and
active in sports, playing on the neighborhood
softball team last summer.

Although this is Julie’s first experience
with organized football and she began the
season in mid-September playing second
string, Layman and his assistants, George
Ray and Dave Pelton, said that they
expect her to improve steadily throughout
the season and perhaps even win a start-
ing position on the team.

The competition for a starting position will be
intense.

Ray said that Julie’s enthusiasm is her
strongest asset. “She has a genuine inter-
est in the sport and a willingness to go for
it and keep up with the boys (who, by the
6th grade, have already played two years
of CYO football),” he said.

Despite Ms. Zapadka’s enthusiasm at
Julie’s successful attempt to play CYO
football, she fears for her daughter's
safety. “I am concerned about Julie being
hurt the same way I would be if she were a
boy,” she said.

Julie is the only girl playing CYO
football this season, but she is not the first
girl gridder to be added to a CYO roster.
Sanford said that she is preceded by Ann
Steele, who played for Our Lady of
Perpetual Help parish in 1978 and
Roberta Parker, who in 1979, played for
St. John’s parish in Point Place.

Julie said that she enjoys playing on the
St. Clement team, but is not sure if she
will return to the field next year.

Her mother said that football is some-
thing Julie wanted to “try” — to experiment
with.

Ms. Zapadka said that she doesn’t
expect Julie to play again next season.
However, if Julie chooses to play, Ms.
Zapadka said that she would not stop her.
