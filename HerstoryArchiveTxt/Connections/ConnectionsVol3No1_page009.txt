‘YSWOMAN

The 1980 TWIN Dinner will indeed be a
Tribute to Women and Industry.

“It is a very proud occasion,” says
Tibble Foster, general chairman of the
1980 TWIN project. “The nominees are
proud of their accomplishments; the com-
panies are proud of their nominees; and
the entire community is proud of the
wealth of talent we have.”

This year, 26 businesswomen have
been nominated by area businesses for
this coveted honor. TWIN honorees have
been nominated by their companies for
excellence at an executive, managerial or
professional level. The 1980 honorees are:
Mary J. Abbott, The Andersons; Barbara
J. Carver, Plaskon Products, Inc.; Patri-
cia Lee Desmond, Libbey-Owens-Ford
Company; Anabel S. Diefenthaler, The

Last year’s TWIN dinner filled the ball-
room at the Commodore Perry with
nearly 500 persons standing to applaud
the accomplishments of the 1979 honor-
ees. Dinner chairman Phyllis Ide has
promised that this year’s dinner arrange-
ments will be equal to the excitement of
the occasion. This year’s event will be
held Oct. 29. Those who would like to
receive an invitation should contact
Barbara Eikost at the YWCA, 241-3235.

Fear of Success

Women are handicapped not only by
their fear of failure but by their fear of
success as well.

Until recent years there has been a
pattern of devaluing female abilities.
Women who want to succeed must over-
come their internal lack of confidence as
well as social barriers. Successful achi-
evement has not only been unexpected for
women, but may also be considered
unfeminine by others as well as by the
woman herself.

Achieving women are less and less
afraid of success. They are not as con-
cerned about being different from other
women. Their real problem is on issues of
independence and balance.

Those inner voices are not always
accurate. They may say, “I’m not really
good enough” or “This will break up my
marriage,” or “Men don’t really like ambi-
tious women,” or “If I'm a good mother I
must be home all the time.” If a woman is
straight with her priorities, her caretaking
gifts, her energy level, she will find the
balance.

Anna Pavlova, the great Russian bal-
lerina, says, “Success depends in a very
large measure upon individual initiative
and exertion; and cannot be achieved
except by dint of hard work. To tend,
unfailingly, unflinchingly towards a goal,
is the secret of success. But success?
What exactly is success? For me it is to be
found not in applause, but in the satisfac-
tion of feeling that one is realizing one’s
ideal.”
