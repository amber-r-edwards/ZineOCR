Another  
Perspective  

by Mary White  

Late summer is a season even more  
conducive to the destruction of family  
harmony than civil war or the reading of the  
will. It is that happy time when back to school  
shopping — one of the most traumatic and  
stressful non-events in the entire calendar  
year — occurs.  

Folklore tells us that the Hatfield-McCoy  
feud began with a hair-pulling contest over the  
only pair of shoes in the general store in  
Hazard, Kentucky. And a new blood feud can  
be started any day by plucking a small, grubby  
girl from a baseball diamond, tucking a wilted  
sock in her pocket (for trying on school  
shoes) and dragging her to a mall. Teeth  
clench, tempers flare and charges of child  
abuse and child ingratitude are hurled back  
and forth.  

As the small girl grows into adolescence the  
problems change, but the tension level  
remains high. If she doesn’t need a bra, she  
will be depressed and tearful. If she does, she  
will toss her curls and refuse to wear one.  
Either way your counsel and soothing advice  
will be ignored or disputed.  

Another thing you will encounter is the  
“Brooke Shields” phenomenon. As fall  
approaches there will emerge in every junior-  
high in the land one glamorous and  
precocious 12-year-old beauty with a pouting  
underlip. She will appear to be 25. She will  
have a naturally provocative saunter and will  
wear purple halters and tight jeans. If this is  
your daughter you will buy her loose fitting  
tops and pants which she will wear as far as  
her girlfriend’s house where she will change  
back into her wardrobe of choice while you  
will endure comments such as “I don’t  
understand why her mother dresses her that  
way.”  

If this is not your daughter the lectures you  
deliver on the unsuitability of purple halters,  
tight jeans and trying to imitate others will fall  
on deaf ears. Either way, shopping will be a  
disaster.  

Besides coping with inter-family conflict,  
you will have to deal with the “Seventh  
Avenue seasons” whereby all clothing  
merchandising is six months ahead of (or  
behind) the climate.  

This means if you want warm woolen  
sweaters you must try them on sticky,  
protesting bodies during a July heatwave. If in  
July, however, your child tears her bathing  
suit, you can bet your subscription to WWD  
that she’ll have to wear a towel to the beach  
because bathing suits won’t be available again  
until January.  

Maybe the answer is to avoid the conflict  
altogether. Leave your kids at home and go  
out and buy yourself a new dress.
