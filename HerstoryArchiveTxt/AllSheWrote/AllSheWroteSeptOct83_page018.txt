frosted glass

we see each other

through frosted glass
feeling the warmth of our
separate lights,

nothing more

sometimes those whirring glows
seem almost strong enough to

shatter glass

ALL SHE WROTE

letter of sympathy

he showed me his room.

one wall collaged with bright papers,
strips of headlines.

a cockbox stocked with small treasures.
this man was 70, not 27.

his salad buffet was a maze of delight--

twinkling laughter in the hearts of palm.

Margaret did the dishes while he and I
philosophized in the living room.

her small eyes glinted in a hammy face.
I remember those fat pink ankles
stuffed and footbound into chunky heels
like my grandma, like Petunia Pig.

once he called her in

and told me about

the architect she'd worked for

while she showed pictures of buildings
the man had designed.

my sister writes:

Paul died this month, seventy-seven.
and I write Margaret, not knowing
really, if we are kin.

so Margaret, in deepest sympathy
for all I could not say
for what you probably could not hear.

our strengths are in
different languages...
may yours

carry you through.

afternoon reaches in

to tint edges bronze

to pull me off into leaf shadows
silently dancing

to pull me back

to sun-sky noon
with all our senses

being

with all our senses

gelatinous and glowing

"Destined to become a classic in

“SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER

these moments

when fern and curtain

move noiselessly

in window breeze

cat sleeps yoga-stretched

and plans of leaving to live
with people

cross my mind against

the flow of etched black words
as light now fades

across the page

these last days

I've become the courter
coming to my solitude
with songs

with fruits and flowers

and eager for its time

for Sara at 37

rehard woman

calm among the peaches

garden woman

learning to make fresh life
sprout from old garbage

witch woman

feeling through tree dark
how it can be

moon woman

sensing tides
of seasons

wise woman

building carefully, or quickly
whichever fits

strong woman

opening to softness
letting go to trust

giggling woman

crazy as la lune
smiling so sunnily
