-MARY LOPEZ  
AN INTRODUCTION TO NOW  

The National Organization for Women  
(NOW) was founded on the 29th of June  
1966, in Washington D.C.  

The purpose of this organization of  
women and men is "to take action to  
bring women into full participation in  
the mainstream of American society now,  
exercising all privileges and responsi-  
bilities thereof in truly equal part-  
nership with men. This purpose in-  
cludes, but is not limited to, equal  
rights and responsibilities in all as-  
pects of citizenship; public service,  
employment, education, and family life.  

NOW's philosophy is to oppose any  
discrimination based on race, color,  
sex, religion, national origin, age,  
economic status, parenthood, affection-  
al preference, or lifestyle."  

At the outset, it was understood  
that there will not be unanimity on  
all issues, but that there is the need  
for an organization that can supply  
nationwide pressures on an immediate  
basis, an organization that will iden-  
tify the problems (in the field of  
equal rights) and relay the informa-  

ted organizations.  

Some of the issues identified for  
action are:  

THE ERA: After its defeat, NOW was  
concentrating on changing the politi-  
cians who opposed the Equal Rights  
Amendment. The 1982 elections did  
change the face of Congress, as well  
as many of the State Legislatures,  
therefore NOW has decided to push on  
the issue again.  

REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS including abor-  
tion; are issues of life and death for  
women, not just a matter of choice.  
NOW is dedicated to remove this issue  
from the political arena and keep them  
(reproductive rights) a matter of pri-  
vate individual decision.  

LESBIAN RIGHTS: NOW supports legis-  
lation which prohibits discrimination  

on the basis of affectional/sexual  
preference in such areas as employ-  
ment, housing, education, public  
accommodations, military service, so-  
cial welfare, and health sciences.  
These should be civil rights guaran-  
teed for every citizen of the United  
States.  

NOW also supports the repeal of any  
laws which criminalize sexual activity  
between consenting adults in private.  

The third area of lesbian rights  
legislation which NOW supports is that  
of custody and/or adoption rights for  
lesbian mothers. In most states either  
parent can be declared unfit on the  
basis of affectional/sexual preference,  
often the child involved is thus de-  
prived of custody or visitation of the  
more nurturing parent.  

HOMEMAKERS RIGHTS; Society has not  
recognized the economic value of the  
goods and services provided by the  

ALL SHE WROTE  

homemaker to her/his family and the  
community. This lack of value has re-  
sulted not only in the evaluation of  
homemakers as "non-working", but has  
also deprived the homemaker of job re-  
lated benefits that paid workers take  
for granted.  

In view of these facts NOW proposes  
a Homemakers Bill of Rights, which in-  
cludes:  

--abolition of gift taxes on inter-  
spousal transfers.  

--independent social security cover-  
age in the homemaker's own name, porta-  
ble into and out of marriage, and con-  
tinuing as the homemaker leaves and re-  
enters the paid workforce, containing  
provision for disability and retire-  
ment benefits adequate to maintain a  
decent standard of living.  

--development of adequate flexible-  
time and part-time child care facili-  
ties to make these jobs more available  
to parents of young children.  

These are only a sampling of the  
issues that NOW is determined to work  
to correct.  

Areas of action at present include:  
newsletter production, letter writing  
campaigns to key Senators in support  
of reproductive rights, networking to  
make quality and inexpensive child  
care readily accessible, and informa-  
tion and investigation of the highway  
assaults Oahu is plagued by.  

We are also involved in PLEA (Pro-  
fessional Law Enforcement Advocates)  
working for reforms in the way the po-  
lice commission handles citizens com-  
plaints.  

Future projects include conscious-  
ness raising and fund raising.  

People with ideas and energy to  
spare are welcome to help make our im-  
pact stronger. Our address is: Hono-  
lulu Chapter NOW, P.O. Box 22152,  
Honolulu 96822. Our phone number is  
941-2029, and our meetings are  
on the third Wednesday of the month,
