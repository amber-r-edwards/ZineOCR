WOMEN IN PRISON  
IMPRISONING CHOICES

Imprisoning choices. Who among us  
hasn't made them? How well I remember  
the choice to remain in an imprison-  
ing marriage for 7 years because of my  
fear of being financially unable to  
provide. Have one of you, my Sisters,  

failed to apply for the better  
prisoning security in an unsatisfac-  
tory job? Do we know of someone, im-  
prisoned by social discrimination,  

who accepts the status quo for fear of  
being mocked? We've all made imprison-  
ing choices but, fortunately, our pri-  
son is on the outside, within “free"  
society.

Some of our Sisters have made impri-  
soning choices, causing a complete  
loss of freedom, on the "inside."  
Eighty of them are inmates at Hale  
Nano Wahine, the women's prison in Kai-  
lua. Our "Forgotten Sisters" are ne-  
glected by us, lives filled with work,  
child care, women's issues, and other  
community interests. Yet, with a small  
expenditure of time, we can provide  
community links and an awareness of  
women's issues to help our Sisters  
clarify life: how they got where they  
are; how to emerge stronger; how to  
deal with the multiple discrimination  
of being women, plus convicted felons.

Contrary to incarcerated men, the  
women are primarily non-violent. In  
fact, 95% of these women inmates are  
imprisoned for non-aggressive offenses.  
Many, if not most, have substance  
abuse problems aggravating their situ-  
ations. From my observations, most do  
not have a view of self as woman that  
is strong or competent. Similar to  
our experiences, their background  
failed to teach work skills or asser-  
tiveness. There has been little  
stress on education or analyzing the  
discrimination society holds toward  
women.

As illustrations let me tell you  
about my incarcerated friend, Ellen.  
She is one of the more beautiful women  
I know, with a growing awareness of  
woman self/life, and an incredible  

determination. Although

FOURTH ANNUAL WOMEN'S SUMMER GATHERING

Aloha Sisters,

A group of us will be hosting the  
Fourth Annual Ainahou Women's Summer  
Gathering. (Yea!) This year's 3 day  
camping weekend starts Friday, June 24  
through Sunday, June 27, 1983.

Our vision is 3 days camping, music,  
bonding, eating, dancing, communica-  
ting, and structured childcare. Sat-  
urday, June 25th...the children's pro-  

gram will be for boys and girls aged  
2½-10 years. (Special arrangements can  
be made for younger children.) Includ-  
ed in the children's program will be  
the women of the Volcan Storytellers  
doing a special 2-hour presentation.  
We feel providing quality childcare  
will give the "mothers among us" the  
chance to nurture themselves, take  
part in events or do whatever makes us  
feel good!

Some of the events planned will be  
facilitated circles, massage and ex-  
ercise, creating art, lei making, pot  
luck dinner and party Saturday night,  
and brainstorming sessions with women  
interested in a women's business co-  
op.

Full registration is $10 per woman  
and $2 per child (under 2 free).  
Please make check payable to the  
Family Crisis Shelter, Inc.

Please remember this full camping, so  
plan accordingly.

See you there,

neys volunteered just enough time to  
handle one case.

Forty square feet per inmate is the  
rule of thumb to determine size of pri-  
sons. The women at Kailua have one-  
half that, with 80 people crammed in a  
space for 40 or less. The care is  

to compensate for the stress arising  
from over-crowding, activities and pro-  
grams are crucial.

So, what can you do, you ask? The  
new administrator, Michael Hess, and  
his assistant, Nancy Mings, are unusu-  
ally receptive to offers of help or  
suggestions. Call either of them at:  
263-4267 or 261-8943. Here are some  
ideas, just to get the brain in gear  
until you think of your own:

1. Sports & exercise programs.  
Needed: coaches for volleyball/bas-  
ketball/softball, and exercise in-  
structors.

2. Job skills teachers.

3. Equipment needed: typewriters,  
old computers (they have a teacher  
but no computers), painting sup-  
plies, exercise mats, ping pong ta-  
ble.

4. Counselors (individual or group)  
dealing with: substance abuse, alien-  
ation, self-development, parenting.  
5. Hair stylists.

6. Arts: drama teacher, music en-  
sembles (including classical), teach-  
ers for painting/drawing/ceramics.  
7. Fabric to recover cushions of  
old rattan living room set.

8. Interior decor for walls: paint-  
ings, posters, drawings.

9. Lawyers, particularly for those  
held unable to post bail.

10. Plants to landscape facility  
grounds.

The action we take today may strength-  
en the life of a Sister tomorrow.
