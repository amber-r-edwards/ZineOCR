“= BEING IN LOVE - CARLA ANNETTE

To me being in love means being in
love with the whole world. Love is
right in every manifestation—Love of
Man and Woman, of Man and Man, love of
Woman and Woman. Love of Parent and
Child and all the world's children.
Love of Trees and Mountains and Sand
and Ocean. Love of Humans all around
the globe, for they are not strangers
if I open myself to their ways. Love
for the Universal—I am grateful for
each moment and each breath.

Start your day by looking in the
mirror and saying, “I love you Carla"
(your name). You can give yourself a
hug and a giggle. Find at least one
other person to hug and say, "I love

you!" People are starving for love
and touching... We're all the same,

I love being me—"Carla Annette."

I love my work, "Soul Studies in black
and white." For thirty years I've ex-
perienced the joy of letting people

see how beautiful they are when they
let go. When photographing a relation-
ship, I say, "Just enjoy one another
and be."

Having the studio in my home made
it possible for me to both earn and
have a family. While I was carrying
a child, I felt proud to be doing sev-
eral jobs at one time. I was caring
for my own body with love. I was
caring for the being becoming inside
me with love. I was caring for the

growing children I brought into this
world and I was caring about the larg-
er world family, working for peace and
civil rights with dedication.

I wanted a dozen children. Res-
pecting the judgment of my marvelous
friend, Walter, my husband for thirty-
nine years, I compromised. We are
blessed with eight healthy, wonderful
children. Each is a very special per-
son and is making a better world.

We gave them plenty of room to
grow, despite a crowded house and ten
at the dinner table. We picked houses
on dead-end streets, near parks and
close to the water. After thirty
years in Seattle, one January 10 years
ago when $150 round trips to Hawaii
were about to end, we came to camp on
the beaches for three weeks. Thus be-
gan another love affair. Aware of our
sadness at parting from these shores,
daughter Annabel exclaimed, "Dad, why
don't you retire and have mom support
us!"

So we reversed roles. Walter, a ty-
pical Jewish mother, loves to shop
"specials," cook gourmet meals, set an
elegant table and welcome guests. Be-
sides his daily yoga, he writes moving
stories and acts as Ice Pick on Magnum.
As we drive to early morning tennis be-
neath Koko Crater, we express our
thanks for the incredible sights as
the first rays of sun shimmer below
Molokai.

Expressing aloud our appreciation
for each other and for all nature's
beauties is important. I even talk to
rocks and roses and sometimes to roaches,
inviting them outside. Several
times during the day, I find myself
saying, "I am grateful for this very
moment." It helps to focus my mind
on the now and how right it is. It
