COMMENTARY

COMMENTARY TO A FEMINIST COLLEAGUE

This commentary will serve as a cura-
tive effect in an attempt to calm my
urgency of love and the overwhelming
frustration I feel brought about by the
distance between the sexes.

Violence must stop! It must stop
now! I must continue working on the
long-term problem, the mentality that
breeds violence. The frustration that
I as a woman experience is a universal
one. Today I am very anxious because
I am seeing I've taken all the leeway
Patriarchy will allow me to take. The

COURAGE: BY WHOSE DEFINITION

Recently I watched and listened to
an interview of Norman Mailer and was
horrified to see his continued deep-
seeded contempt for the female of the
human species on this planet, pointing
out a painful reality, some Patriarchs
never change even after years of expo-
sure to truth.

He contends, "Women have been so-
cialized to be cowards, and that the
women's movement is teaching courage."

My immediate gut-level feeling to
this man's statement was "hmmm" and
then “interesting” and as ideas spun
in my head and feelings surfaced I be-
gan to see clearly the half-truth and
distortion in his statement.

In reviewing my review of “herstory"
I could only see repeated acts of brav-
ery by women throughout the centuries.
My next idea was to question and take
issue with what has traditionally been
defined as courage and traditionally
accredited to men. Not only has Patri-
archy defined us as "women" but now
its next strategy is to define our
courage which for centuries and in the
"history" have blatantly been excluded,
discounted, or ignored and it is now
implied/dictated we must imitate male

THE TEST OF REAL COURAGE

The test of real courage lies ahead. I
can't go back; I can't stop now. We as
women must carry forward the memory of
our Race, and I am a member of this
human race.

In general, men know intuitively
they are of Lesbian descent, but rather
than love us for it, they react ad-
versely to this truism; institutionaliz-
ing a complex system of Patriarchy
that enslaves Life, enslaves Freedom.

Centuries we have lived under this "Hor-

courage rather than examine roots and
preceding events which call upon cour-
age. Did our sisters who suffered,
survived and yes died in concentration
camps lack courage? Did our early
17th, 18th, and 19th century women
writers and scholars lack courage?
Did the women who died from abortions
in back alleys before legalized abor-
tion lack courage? Is not childbirth
and the procreation of the human spe-
cies courage? Did not our pioneer women
have courage? What about the courage of
our third world sisters who live under
the tyranny of racism? I could go on
endlessly with stories of female courage! If women lack courage
then I state unequivocally there are
many male cowards more so: 
Mailer rapes women, truth and the
integrity of our human race. Is not
violence against women and men and the
tyranny of sexism a cowardly act? Is
it courageous to rape, mutilate, and
murder adults and children in war and
peace? Is not war in its final analy-
sis a cowardly act? Is not child
abuse, battering women and violence
against the earth's animals cowardly?
Is abandonment of children courage?

rible Mistake". Now is a time of
great courage, courage from women, cour-
age calling to honorable men, men of in-
tegrity, men who have been silent out
of confusion and, yes, perhaps out of
fear, who now see truth and wish to
join the Walk Forward into our Future
in defiance of "The Horrible Mistake".
"Unity, intuitive link to Life," carry
forward the memory of our Race.

Whose definition of courage are we
as survivors and women going to follow?
Patriarchy's? That's nonsense, Norman
Mailer, and you know it. Shame on you.
If courage is standing up for violence
or advocating rituals of cruelty while
keeping women subordinate, I don't need
your male approval of my everyday acts
of courage, nor does any woman.

As women continue to examine our
evolving courage and how it has sur-
vived and manifested itself in this
society in our individual process, our
personal relationships, and our collec-
tive endeavors, (even under the most
oppressive conditions) it is impera-
tive to remember that love is courage,
brave, strong and determined even
during our weak moments and I now take
time to applaud that courage!
