Dr. Chris Haggerty, acclaimed speaker,
addressed approximately two hundred
participants at the Ilikai a few weeks
ago. He shared a joke about women in
the corporate world: "There were two
highly qualified candidates for a va-
cant seat on the Board of Directors of a
prestigious company. One was male;

the other, female. Because of her out-
standing skills, and good fortune, the
female candidate got the coveted posi-
tion. Her male competitor went to her,
and congratulated her on her success.
He asked what advice, if any, she

might offer. She replied, ‘Get down on
your knees, thank the Lord for your
blessings in life, and pray to Her for
guidance."

What we consider “old hat" in feminist
circles is becoming an increasingly

significant part of the American busi-
ness world. The audience loved the

unevolved souls who poked each other

in the ribs instead. As we go to press

with this issue, with the precious fate
of the Equal Rights Amendment still
undetermined, we find a growing dis-
content among women (and some men)
toward the progress of Feminism. But
when one closely examines the accom-
plishments and strides of women in
the workplace, there is a growing
enlightenment, rippling through the
"Old Boys' Club," so that even those
guys in polyester aren't so stupid,
after all. What is happening is this:
more and more competent women are
gaining more of the payroll, and more
of the respect, of their male peers.

So who are these women? And what
makes them so successful? And how do
more women earn more of the American
paycheck? The "Old Girls' Club" has a
few wonderful secrets to share. The
rules of success are both universal

and provincial. They work to enhance
and protect the individual who wants to
accomplish her dreams in the workplace.
Mary Cunningham, formerly with the
Bendix Corporation, reportedly has a
plaque above her desk, which reads,
"Any job which is not an aggravation
is not worth the job."

Entitlement is a most important virtue

to have in realizing one's career goals.

Women who succeed believe they are
entitled to do just that: to be paid

a competitive salary for their skills, to
receive training and advancement, to
have interesting and self-directed
duties, and to be a significant part of
the decisions made by the group within
which they operate. They are entitled
to these things, and they get them.

Another significant tool used by accom-
plished women is the mentor. People
who strive to attain their goals use
mentors for role models and as counsel-
ors. Mentors also serve to advance
their protégées by including them in

that one relate to more than one mentor
at a time. In any field, successful
people attract other successful people;
and those women who have "made it"
willingly serve to advance the efforts
of other women less advanced. Choos-
ing a male mentor can be fine, if one
knows his track record in working with
other women. Look for those qualities
and attitudes in a mentor which closely

parallel your own values. And finally,
people feel honored to be looked up to.
After all, someone special helped them
before!

Despite the harsh economic conditions,
the rising unemployment rate, the
slacking off of affirmative action
practices, the door has opened for
higher income. The ones with the keys
are admitted. Sometimes they are in-
vited. And they are increasingly
welcome.

American employers are quickly realiz-
ing that women have a vast amount of
talent, and can contribute diversity,
dimension, and results to the workplace.
We have moved past the tokenism stage
to the era of being a fashionable and
profitable element of the office. The
men's room isn't quite so powerful any-
more. They wait until their female
counterparts have input. More and
more.
