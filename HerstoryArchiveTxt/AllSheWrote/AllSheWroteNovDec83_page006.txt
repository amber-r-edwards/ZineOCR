In Good Hands.  
Every evening the streets came  
alive, as young and old surged back  
from school and work. Vendors ped-  
dled their wares, steaming pots lured  
passersby to sidewalk kitchens, and  
a street barber could be seen applying  
his long blade. A cobbler was hammer-  
ing on black boots, as he joked with  
his clientele at the end of a long  
day.  

I often went jogging at 6 a.m. in  
my red warmups printed "Shanghai." I  
came upon bicyclists in the rain,  
hooded in plastic, some transporting a  
friend on the handlebar, others hauling  
a wagon loaded with produce which later  
was spread along the sidewalk. There's  
no refrigeration, so people must buy  
their perishables daily.  

As the mass of working people cycled  
to their jobs, their elders used every  
open space, empty lot or park for  
their early morning Tai Chi and sword  
dances. Though bundled up in the early  
morning frost in Xi'an, they did these  
exercises like a dance. Such grace and  
concentration, as one movement flowed  
into another! Whenever I caught their  
eye we glanced at each other in awe.  

As I headed back to the hotel, ever  

present street cleaners, women with  
their carts and brooms, were already  
sweeping up. Ceramic litter lions have  
their mouths open to receive waste in  
the parks. The beauty and order of  
Chinese cities was a source of joy.  
By now I worked up an appetite for a  
good breakfast-- choice of Western or  
Chinese-- steamed Chinese fluff balls  
and sweet tarts.  

Although tourism is not China's pri-  
ority, I felt generally well taken care  
of. Colorful silk comforters on single  
beds, slippers underneath, and gorgeous  
rugs in each room delighted me.
