Can't you see

You cannot run from me

For I am an extension of what
you have taught,

or not taught me to be

But yet you choose to run from
me

Or put me behind bars,

so you won’t have to see the
likes of me.

Thinking that’s the end.

Look around what do you see?
You have created another ME.
You have the power to make it
stop

But instead you choose to build
another missile block.

Man sweet man, what have you
done? The ball's in your court
too late to run.

But not too late to learn

to play the game right. For he
is bigger and better

who realizes his mistakes

and corrects them.

Than he who goes on playing
because it’s almost game.

Do you want to do what’s right
and just for all

or do you just want to win?
With so few men.

From the beginning of time
and will be to the end,

we all need each other

so let’s not pretend.

Together we can create a
win-win

for we are getting real close
to the final end.

Are you as clean as you present
yourself to be

Will your Judicial System

pass the test for which

you have judged and imprisoned
the likes of me

And now Hawaii

you seek to have the death
penalty.

Correct your people

and all your hidden mistakes,

Here’s the time

for me to say,

yes, I’ve come a long way
with so much farther to go.
Will I ever reach my goal?
What’s in it for me?

I can plainly see.

But now I’ve stopped reaching
for the sky.

Stopped asking questions, Why?
Is this what prison has done to
me?

My dreams come alive with the
morning's dawn,

And die with the setting sun.
Is this what prison has done?
I reach out for God and I know
He’s there.

Is He saying something that I
cannot hear?

In the meantime this nightmare
goes on.

How long must a man/woman
suffer,

for crimes that can’t be
undone?

Time has come for Hawaii
Judicial System to see
extended punishment is not the
KEY

DORTRY

SOCIETY, PRISON AND ME

WAHINE TIMES

to make a better you and me.
Is there anyone among you who
has the skill and will to take
the time to

rehabilitate (To restore to
customary activity by
Education and Therapy) the
people that you’ve chosen to
separate?

Or do you rather continuously
take care

of inmates' children whom they
have stolen from, just to feed.
And what about their therapy?
For they are in need the
children

you separated from me

But the beat goes on.

Not just for some, but for
everyone,

Man sweet man, when will you
realize

that we have better join hands
and go it side by side.

for you are only ONE
together we are some.

Stop and look at me!

Don’t play GOD.

For He is almighty and great.
If you’ll just read

He’ll tell you of the Son

He sent to save people

like you and me.

And you Hawaii

Men among men

Kings that were great

now choose, to follow the other.

dying States.

No, building another prison
won’t do

you can’t hide from the likes
of me.

FOR I AM

YOU. I've seen this world so

Prisoner

Placed in confinement, all

Rights abolished, human
Injustice prevails, He’s

Silently crying for man’s inhuman

Oppression, non-escaping,
Numbing, callous pain invading
Erosion begins, salvation is lost
Robbing all of His humanity.

OH HOW MOMMY MISSES YOU...

There is only emptiness, since
you were born,

There is no sunshine when it’s
the crack of morn.

My heart aches, crying out for
my baby boy,

Wishing to see him play with
his first baby toy.

To hope and pray is all I can
do.

To dream and wish, I want to
be with you.

Oh Jonathan, How Mommy Misses
You.

Someday baby, God will take
away all that was left blue,

To hug and hold and never let
go.

To love
and kiss those soft
cheeks.
Oh Mommy waits for those
special weeks

Holding on to each tear that I
weep,
Praying to
keep.

God my soul to

Oh Jonathan, How Mommy Misses
You.

I pray someday we will
start anew

To be together and never sad
and blue.

To be as one, my dear son.

Sunshine’s a little bright -

Ma Ma can’t be home tonight -
Honey, “I love you", You know that I
do -

There’s not a diamond that
shines like you -

Lollipops - and cotton candy, sugar
sweet tooth —

There could never be another
precious jewel like you -

Getting up early - That sure is you

When you lean over and kiss me,
and say, "Ma Ma it’s time for
school,"

You know that I miss you -

But one thing for sure —

Your Aunty will take good care of
you.

Put on your ribbons, and braid
your hair, too -

"I'm hungry today, - what about a
donut, it’s on the way" -

I might as well say - :
"Ma Ma’s got a weakness for you
every day" -

I wake up -
and look where I’m at, tears start
to fall,

I sometimes forget -

Soon I’ll be free to see you again -
you’ll reach out to me -
and say once again -

"Please Ma Ma, please don’t
leave me again.”
