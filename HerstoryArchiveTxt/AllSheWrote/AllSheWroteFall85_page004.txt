ASW: American women were  
Cautioned that at the End  
of the Decade for Women  
Conference in Nairobi no  
matter how progressive  
they were, Black, White  
or spotted, they would be  
seen as an American and an  
exploiter.  

As a white woman (with  
red hair) was that part of  
your experience at the  
International Year of  
Youth Regional Health  
Workshop in Fiji this  
past summer?  

DIANE BAIRD: Yes, but  
Racism against whites in  
the Pacific is understand-  
able. For example, we met  
each day in a big hall.  
On the back wall was a  
large display on birth  
control. In addition to  
the traditional methods  
of birth control, there  
was Depo Provera, which is  
illegal in the U.S.  

It's also illegal in  
New Zealand, except for  
Maori and Pacific women.  

It's also illegal in  
Australia, except for  
women leaving prison, who  
are given a shot that  
lasts three months.  

As an American White,  
I am a part of the legacy  
of the drug companies.  

ASW: We are in fact still  
Colonizers in terms of the  
trust territories and  

DB: Another example:  
the director of the  
camp we met in and a visi-  
tor stated publicly that  
the Kanakys (Melanesian  
New Caledonians) were not  
oppressed.  

In fact, I was some-  
what surprised to not find  
anger in some groups. The  
Kanakys and the Tahitians  
tried to get to know me  
first rather than see me  
only as a white.  

The situations in the  
Pacific vary from country  
to country and is complex.  
A good example are the  
Kanakys. They didn't

speak much English. They  
spoke French so they were  
somewhat isolated. Mid-  
way through the workshop  

an interpreter came who  

was a white French-speaking  
Canadian. The Kanakys  
rebelling against the  
French government and  

their interpreter who is  

a political minority in  
Canada had much in common.  

ASW: This workshop was  
Organized by the World  
YWCA to give young women  
in the Pacific an oppor-  
tunity to bring their  
concerns to the NGO in  
Nairobi.  

You were selected  
because you had been to  
National Convention and  
worked with the World  
YWCA Pacific staff on  
the presentation of the  
Nuclear Free Pacific  
resolution. And you  
are also applying to  
medical school.  

Although it was sug-  
gested that an indige-  
nous person be sent if  
possible, the YWCA was  
not asked to not send a  
white woman.  

I was asked that  
several times but only  
the Maori women were at  
first very hostile.  

DB: That's correct.  

Hawaii, Marshall  
Islands, New Cale-  
donia, Aotearoa/  
New Zealand, Palau,  
Papua New Guinea,  
Ponape, Western  
Samoa, Solomon  
Islands, Tonga and  
Vanuatu, the two  
other white women  
were YWCA staff.  

Unfortunately, at  
this time there are  

I was attacked almost  
every time I spoke. "How  
do you know what indige-  
nous women's problems in  
Hawaii are?", she would  
demand. When I was pub-  
licly attacked, however,  
someone tried to balance  
the views. And a lot of  
people personally sympa-  
thized with me. Some of  
that experience was remi-  
niscent of intermediate  
school in Hawaii but if  

the camp had not been two  
hours from Suva I might  
have left the first night.  

When we arrived at  
the camp we joined the  
opening in progress in  
which Taufa Vakatale,  
World YWCA vice presi-  
dent and Fiji YWCA  
president, told us that  
Pacific Islanders had  
gone beyond the charity  
stage of Christianity  

and that  
it was time for them to  

be under-  
lying theme of the workshop.  
The better part of the  
last day was spent discus-  
sing the need for a  
Pacific woman in the  
position of World YWCA  
Pacific Area Secretary.  
It wasn't a personal  
attack on the white staff-  
person. But there was a  
sense that Pacific women  
can no longer have things  
done for them by white  
people, no matter how well-  
intentioned.  

ASW: The workshop had five  
objectives:  

1) leadership development  
of those attending;  

2) development of YWCAs and  
nongovernmental organiza-  
tions represented;  

3) strengthening of skills  
in leading discussions  
on violence against  
women;  

4) to network with other  
YWCAs and NGOs; and  

5) to form a regional  
support group.  

How was the meeting  
structured and were some of  
these goals accomplished?  

DB: We met for 10 days and  
a topic a day was planned  
for discussion. Topics in-  
cluded Nairobi action,  
health, violence against  
women, migration, nuclear  
problems and independence.  
Originally the emphasis  
was on health but because  
there were so many different  
countries and several  
issues, no country was  
really interested in all  
of the issues.  

The Kanakys, for example,  
were not interested in talk-  

ing about birth control;  
they only wanted to talk  

countries were only in-  
terested in the nuclear  

issue.  

Health was the topic  
for the first night but  
because so much time was  
spent discussing the New  
Zealand women's views of  
the workshop issues and  
the people running it and  
their demand to restructure  
the workshop into special  
sessions for indigenous women (which was  

not supported by the major-  
ity of the participants),  
health issues were only  
reported by country but not  
discussed.  

The women ranged in  
ages from 16-30 and many  
wanted sex education. A  
conference on just sex  
education is in my opinion  
still really needed. In  
most of the Pacific, even  
the term “birth control"  
can't be used. “Family  
planning" is even a fringe  
term. In Vanuatu, they use  
the term “mothercraft."  

After reviewing the  
minutes of the meeting, I  
realized how much the work-  
shop was dominated by the  
older, more westernized  
women; that the young  
women didn't get much of  
a voice in the large meet-  
ings--although they did get  
more in the small groups.  
But it's not surprising  
that global politics and  
anti-nuclear issues domi-  
nated the workshop.  

ASW: Do you have any ideas  
for programs that the Uni-  
versity YWCA might initiate?  

DB: We are in a good posi-  
tion to offer programming to  
migrant women at the Univer-  

I'd like us to administer  

a program developed by Paci-  
fic people.  

We must because it  
is a major issue in the Paci-  

fic. The Pacific YWCA is  

the center of the anti-nuclear  

movement; that's their main  
identity.  
I'm glad after all that I  

had the opportunity to go  

because I now realize that  

most of the time we don't see  

ourselves in a Pacific con-  
text, and that's largely  

because we don't have a sense  

of what's going on in the  
Pacific.  

Pacific women at the  
Nairobi Forum formed a group  
which included representatives  
from the Pacific islands,  
Australia, Aotearoa (New  
Zealand), Philippines, Kanaky  
(New Caledonia), East Timor  
and West Papua (Irian Jaya).  

"We heard our sisters from  
different Pacific countries  
speak of cancer and other radi-  
ation-induced illnesses and  

of Indonesian armed forces and  
support of the restored East  
Timor-Australia radio link;  
and on the Philippines calling  
the women see the Pacific  
region as an economically  
dependent area, increasingly  
reliant on external aid, and  
increasingly susceptible to  
political manipulation.  

“We see our people mi-  
grating out of the Pacific,  
being drawn into low-wage  
employment in developed  
countries and suffering  
cultural alienation and  
racism.  

The statement included re-  
separate sections on Australia  
concerning Aboriginal  
people's rights; on Aotearoa on indigenous  
people's rights; on West Papua  
supporting self-determination  
and withdrawal of the  
Indonesian government and recog-  
nize border-crossers to Papua  
New Guinea as refugees; on  
Kanaky call for a stop to  
French repression and relisting  
of New Caledonia on the  

Women of the Pacific had  
been exposed to radiation  
dangers, made a dumping ground  
for contraceptives and  

"It is our responsibility  
as women of the world to  
combine to bring this exploit-  
ation to an immediate halt.
