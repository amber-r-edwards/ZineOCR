NEWLY FORMED PUERTO RICAN FEMINIST ORGANIZATION

On April 16, 1984, a reception
was held to announce the existence
of a new organization: The National
Puerto Rican Women's Caucus, Inc.

The National Puerto Rican Wom-
en's Caucus was created to work pri-
marily in the following areas:

* Economic development for
Puerto Rican women

* To provide opportunity for the
personal, professional, and finan-
cial advancement of Puerto Rican
women

* To foster a stronger sense of
self-awareness

* Political sophistication

* To promote cohesiveness among
Puerto Rican professional women

A review of the data from the
1970 and 1980 Federal census clear-
ly indicates that as a community
we have failed to make progress on
any of the usual socio-economic in-
dicators.

Puerto Rican women are rapidly
falling behind in terms of earnings
and are denied access to management
positions in both private and pub-
lic sectors. Another area of major
concern has been the failure of
society to acknowledge the leader-
ship role played by women in the
Puerto Rican community.

"To deal effectively with the
issues and problems of Puerto Rican
women is to deal with the issues

community. Historically, our wom-
en have always shared responsibi-
lity for the development of our
service agencies and political or-
ganizations. But, as so often hap-

pens, only the males are recognized
publicly or talked to by the pow-
er structure. Repeatedly, we have
found that the power in the Puerto
Rican community is concentrated,
by act or omission, in the hands
of our male counterparts. Access
to that power has been denied to
women. It is a problem internal
to the Puerto Rican community and
reinforced by the larger society." 
Yolanda Sanchez, president and
one of the founders of the caucus
further stated: "If the Puerto
Rican community is to deal effec-
tively with its problems, if it
expects to progress economically
and politically in the next ten
years, the role of women must be
fully reinforced and publicly

acknowledged. We can no longer af-
ford to be the silent partner."

Other founders and organizers of
the National Puerto Rican Women's
Caucus are Lydia M. Colon, Assistant
Vice President, Chemical Bank; and
Carmen A. Luciano, Equal Employment
Opportunity Officer, N.Y.C. Human
Resources Administration.

Ms. Sanchez is a social worker
whose experience has been primarily
in housing, health care delivery,
and community development. She was
recently honored by the N.Y.C. Com-
mission on the Status of Women as
one of fifteen outstanding New

March 1st, 1984, in commemoration

of Women’s History Month. The pro-
clamation and certificates were pre-
sented by Mayor Edward Koch, New
York City.
