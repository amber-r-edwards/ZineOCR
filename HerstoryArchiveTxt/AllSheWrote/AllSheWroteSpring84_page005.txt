Makers of Destiny--Hawaiian Style

Published by The Delta Kappa Gamma  
Society International, Beta Beta State

Review written by Pat Couvillon

Since the principal theme of this  
issue of All She Wrote is women's his-  
tory, I was asked to find and write a  
review of a book that reflects some  
historical contribution of women, pre-  
ferably a collected work. Additionally,  
having a casual interest in the  
history of Hawaii, I had hoped to find  
something that would feature local wom-  
en. I was pleasantly surprised to dis-  
cover this relatively obscure collec-  
tion, which appeared to meet both cri-  
teria, and whose title promised a fas-  
cinating look at a group of women  
about which I knew very little.

Over thirty brief biographical pro-  
files (some autobiographical) of women  
educators are written and presented in  
a sequence which chronicles the devel-  
opment of education in Hawaii over a  
span of about 125 years. Rarely is  
history as palatable as it is chan-  
neled through the lives and stories of  
these remarkable people.

One of the founders of the Royal  
School (which was established for  
the children of the ali'i) was Ber-  
nice Pauahi who later provided for  
the Kamehameha Schools for Hawaiian  
children.

Religious orders also made con-  
tributions. English nuns were re-  
cruited by Queen Emma for a school  
(St. Andrews Priory) that prepared  
Hawaiian girls to be nurses, wives,  
and mothers. A Catholic nun acted  
as the catalyst for the development  
of the Special Education Center of  
Oahu.

There was a teacher who provided  
training through the Adult Associa-  
tion for the Blind for those who  
had been begging on the streets of  
Honolulu.

This book deals with the first  
woman State librarian. Also covered  
are some of the first women recruited  
by the University of Hawaii. They  
include a chemist, an educational  
psychologist, the Dean of Nurses,  

a librarian, a home economist, and  
a music professor.

Along with facts and dates, we  
read tales and anecdotes which pro-  
vide glimpses of life in our islands  
through major historical periods, such  
as annexation which, among other things,  
resulted in a strong emphasis on the  
English language; the plantation era  
which saw a dramatic influx of immi-  
grants; the depression; the war whose  
effects were felt in every corner of  
the community; and statehood.

One story which perhaps symbolizes  
the spirit of all of these women is  
that of Kathleen Macintosh Burke who,  
from 1919 to 1927, served as the hard-  
driving and conscientious principal of  
Ewa Elementary School. When she died,  
she left her savings for the erection  
of a statue of Abraham Lincoln on the  
Ewa School campus.

"There, as a humble woodcutter,  
Lincoln stands as an inspiration to  
the poorest American child that he,  
too, may achieve greatness. For these  
school children are largely descendants

Book Review

of the pioneers who came from the Ori-  
ent to work in the cane fields...."

The teachers too were certainly  
pioneers who came from as far away as  
England to work in challenging, diffi-  
cult, and often primitive and isolated  
circumstances.

Many educational philosophies are  
represented in these sketches, and  
many of us might, with hindsight, take  
issue with the directions and structures  
which subsequently evolved, but we can  
all acknowledge and admire the dedica-  
tion and commitment with which these  
women applied themselves and the seem-  
ingly selfless motivation which pro-  
pelled them.

Unfortunately, the brevity of each  
of these biographies probably forced  
the writers to concentrate on the high-  
lights of the careers of these educa-  
tors, permitting only a cursory look  
at their personal lives, and leaving  
us wondering about what choices they  
were compelled to make in order to  
pursue their professions and at what  
personal cost. It is, of course, not  
too difficult to imagine the pres-  
sures they were under at a time when  
opportunities for women were limited  
and exclusive. Nonetheless, we who  
have had a little more latitude in  
choosing the directions of our lives  
might well have much to learn from  
those who preceded us.

Makers of Destiny is an enchanting  
look at a group representing the hun-  
dreds of women who through the educa-  
tion of the young of these islands  
have had a tremendous influence in  
shaping Hawaii as we now know it. In  
a climate of concern, locally as well  
as nationally, that education still  
poses serious challenges, a reading of  
this book inspires the confidence that,  
as in the past, there will continue to  
be far-sighted individuals who will  
meet the challenges.

Terms Of Endearment is a bitter-  
sweet gem starring Shirley Maclaine,  
Debra Winger and Jack Nicholson.

It's a tender, compassionate and  
very funny family portrait. Aurora,  
played brilliantly by Shirley Maclaine,  
is a frosty Bostonite turned southern  
belle. Aurora’s daughter is passion-  
ate, loving and gutsy. She makes up  
for her mother's lack of ardor by mar-  
rying out of the house and into bed  
where she speeds through three preg-  
nancies.

Except for Garrett, played by Jack  
Nicholson, the men in the movie are  
underdeveloped characters. There's  

nothing underdeveloped about Nicholson,  

who plays a free-floating astronaut.

MOVIE CORNER

I knew there was a reason I kept  
going to see Nicholson in films that  
I disliked. He is good!

James L. Brooks directed this film  
about relationships. It's a tidy mas-  
terpiece that is not cynical, senti-  
mental or fantastic. The chemistry is  
natural and electric.

I felt I was looking at an old fami-  
liar snapshot. At first glance it was  
the contrasting characters that caught  
my eye. Then the interactions of the  
family members came into focus with  
all their quirks and odd postures. Af-  
ter the first impact, it's like thumb-  
ing back through the photo album a few  
years later and seeing the love.

Terms of Endearment will make you  
laugh and cry. Paramount Pictures  

took a risk...They made a movie that  

has genuine feeling.
