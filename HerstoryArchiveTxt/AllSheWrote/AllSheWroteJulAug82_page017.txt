SELF DEFENSE  
FOR  
WOMEN  

(editor's note: the following let-  
ter was written to Ginger and  
Delores of the Women's Self  
Defense Council by one of  

their students.)  

Dear Delores and Ginger:  

A few nights ago, I had to rush a  
badly injured pet to the Animal Emer-  
gency Clinic on Kapiolani. I don't own  
a car, nor do my near-neighbors. I  
didn't spend precious time phoning  
far-away friends who do but scooped up  
the injured pet and a handful of money  
and dashed off in a cab. It was 11 p.m.  

After I'd paid the cab fare and  
the $35 admittance fee, I had very lit-  
tle money in my wallet. I had assumed  
I could catch a bus home. (For a very  
worried person caught off guard, I  
was fairly well-organized...but not, it  
turned out, organized enough.) I had  
also assumed, you see, that I'd leave  
the Clinic before the bus stopped  
running.  

It was 1:00 a.m. when I left the  
injured pet at the Clinic, and I DIDN'T  
REMEMBER TO CHECK THE TIME when I  
left! Out on the street, I quickly  
realized the lateness of the hour...  
traffic was minimal, and there were  
no buses in sight. I buzzed for ad-  
mittance back into the Clinic: lean-  
ing on the buzzer brought NO ONE to  

> dc (1) T set out to find a pay  
(Ah, you're saying, that was  
atis : - —s  
be one, but, looking back, yes, it  
wasn't the smartest decision. It  
would have been less risky to have  
stayed at that well-lit door and to  

have leaned on that buzzer for as long  

as was required to pry someone from  
the treatment rooms.)  

I found myself, then, on Kapi-  
olani at 1:00 in the morning. This was  
not wonderful. However, for the first  
time in the five years I've lived in  
Honolulu, I felt I could handle such a  
situation...I was not OVERWHELMED by  
fear.... And that is my point, that  
is my point exactly.  

I walked to my destination, a  
pay phone located about two blocks  
away, and I moved as if I knew exactly  
where I was going and as if I FULLY  
INTENDED to arrive there un-hassled  
and unharmed. I wasn't looking for  
trouble, but I actually felt that if  
it found me, I would not be paralyzed  
by fear...I WOULD BE ABLE TO ACT.  

I called a cab; it arrived quickly.  
However, its driver insisted I sit in  
the front seat. I didn't, of course.  

I didn't even enter the cab. Instead,  

I copied his license plate numbers,  
reported him to the cab company when  
I finally arrived home, and phoned  
for another cab. (I was stationed  
outside of a restaurant/bar that had  
its doors wide open. I was not, then,  
totally alone and on the street.)  

The second cab arrived and drove  
me home. Remember, I didn't have cab  
fare in my wallet...I left the driver  
at the curb, told him my husband  
would be right out with the fare, and  
woke up my neighbor, decidedly male,  
and sent him out with the money.  

long the way.  

Avoid being an easy target...  

Now, that was a long-winded  
story! And you see (as I do) that  
I made some errors in judgment a-  

tween the details for a confront-  
ation with definite trouble.) It's  

obvious I had luck on my side...  

something none of us can ever rely  
upon...but due to your Course, I  
also had a good mind-set. When not  
overwhelmed by fear, one can think  
straight. Losing some of the fear  
should NEVER make a woman bold,  
but it will help any woman to a-  
void full-on panic...  

The second story is equally  
long-winded...but perhaps packs a  
little more punch. This set of  
circumstances, too, could land on  
almost any woman, who is on foot.  

One Sunday afternoon, I was  
walking down the street in front  
of the Hale Koa. Many other people  
were also on that street. Two  
drunken couples (male & female)  
were singing and weaving several  
yards in front of me. They were  
also tossing insults right and  
left. (I was a witness to this, not  
a target. I was BEHIND them, remem-  
ber.) A middle-aged, local man  
(drinking from some container in a  
bag) was a target for their insults,  
but HIS target was ME.  

I knew who was around me; I  
saw him coming from the Hale Koa.  
Sensing the possibility of at least  
a hassle, I side-stepped by two,  
and he grabbed my arm, and reeled me in almost to his  
chest. ("Hey, haole bitch, you mak-  
ing fun of me?", the creep hollered,  
drawing attention to us.) He didn't  
reel me all the way in, however.  

The heel of my left hand made direct  
contact with the creep's chin. Be-  
cause my aim was THROUGH his chin,  
the force was enough to tip him off  
balance. (It helped, too, that I  
came down on his instep with full  
force...) Needless to say, the fool  
let go of me immediately, and I ran  
(crossing the street) and hopped a  
bus.  

Was this guy going to hurt me?  
(There were many people around, and  
it was a sunny afternoon.) I saw no  
reason to hesitate to find out.  
(Hesitating is a stupid thing to do.)  
I saw him; he grabbed me; and my  
first reflex was to go for him. And  
that is my point here: training im-  
proves those first reactions.....  

I can't be sure, of course,  
what I would have done in this sit-  
uation BEFORE training, but I sus-  
pect I would have hesitated ("Gee  

(There was room between  

affected my everyday life...).  

PAGE 17  

whiz, I don't want to hurt this guy,  

if he isn't going to hurt me.") I  

might even have been stupidly polite  
and tried to humor this turkey! I  
might even have RELIED on those many  
onlookers to rescue me! I probably  
would have counted on everyone and  
everything BUT MYSELF to spare myself  
a full-on hassle....  

I have come away from your Course  
not being totally sure that I can al-  
ways protect myself, that I can always  
totally prevent harm from reaching me.  
HOWEVER, I do know that I am TOTALLY  
CONVINCED that I am not powerless,  
that I am not helpless...not ever...I  
also have a newfound sense of strength  
I know I can rely upon MYSELF far  
more than before training. That doesn't  
mean that I feel invincible, that I  
want to be on Kapiolani at 1:00 a.m.,  
that I welcome a confrontation with a  
creep in front of the Hale Koa. But  
it does mean that I am no longer frozen  
and, therefore, neither is my body. I  
no longer look like a likely victim...  
I don't move like one; I don't talk  
like one; and I am NOT one.  

Your Course has set me free...I  
feel, anyway, as free as I believe any  
woman (who doesn't hold a belt in mar-  
tial arts) can realistically feel.  
And all of this is coming from a woman  
who was beaten on a street on the  
mainland several years ago: A woman,  
who overcame her fear as best she could  
without training, but who moved through  
years at least always half-afraid of  
everything that was the least bit  
threatening. (I need not tell you of  
the great anxiety that has accompanied  
that, nor need I dwell on how it has  
Your Course has made me KNOW that I am  
strong, competent, and in charge of  

myself.
