HAWAII WOMEN AGAINST INCEST

STATEMENT OF BELIEFS

We believe that incest is a crime
whose victims are overwhelmingly fe-
male. We believe that almost every
woman has been either a victim of in-
cest or her life has been affected by
incest. We believe that males are by
far the major perpetrators of incest.
We believe that in an incestuous situ-
ation if anyone has to leave the "home"
it should be the abuser--NOT the vic-
tim. We believe that incest is a re-
sult of the oppression of women and
works to maintain their oppression.
We believe that only women can and
will stop incest.

HWAI SUPPORT GROUP FUNCTION AND ORGANI-
ZATION

The support group is open to any
woman survivor of incest. (All other
activities of HWAI are open to con-
cerned women.) A woman's membership
in the group will be anonymous; all
things said in the group are confiden-
tial unless otherwise agreed upon.

The group functions as a self-help
group. This means that members take
an active part in supporting and help-
ing each other. The group should re-
main small to provide a safe and com-
fortable atmosphere for discussions.
Decisions will be made by consensus.

By this we mean that all women present
must agree to decisions before they be-
come final. There are no leaders of
the group. If such a function becomes
necessary (such as coordinator or
spokeswoman) the position will rotate
among members so all have a chance to
share in the responsibility and experi-
ence.

Aboriginal Nation.
was Pacific militarism with attention
on both nuclear and conventional wea-
ponry. Indeed, the NFIP movement has
grown tremendously, as has its range
of issues.

As an indigenous Hawaiian woman who
was fortunate enough to attend this
conference as a staff person, I re-
turned home with a much broader poli-
tical perspective and comprehension of
the dynamics that are common to all
colonized native peoples. Despite the
differences in the stages of our vari-
ous struggles, the story of the cultur-
al, spiritual and physical genocide of
native peoples by larger and more pow-
erful nations reads essentially the
same.

Ultimately, the conference left me
feeling strong and optimistic. The
growing pan Pacific consciousness of
the movement, the increasing visibili-
ty of women, and the huge strides we
have taken despite geographic separa-
tion, cultural differences, very lit-
tle money, a huge range of issues, and
the sheer power of the entity we are
fighting against. As our roles are be-
coming more clear and our vision more
attainable, a nuclear free, oppression
free world will one day become a reality.
