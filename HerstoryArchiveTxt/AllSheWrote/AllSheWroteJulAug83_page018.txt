The bee is not ‘afraid of me,

I know the butterfly;

The pretty people in the woods
Receive me cordially.

The brooks laugh louder when I come,

The breezes madder play.

Wherefore, mine eyes, thy silver
mists?

Wherefore, O summer's day?

Emily's intimacy with Nature ex-
tends to Nature's creatures as well.
"The bee is not afraid of me...The
pretty people in the woods receive me
cordially." Emily sounds confident
she is loved by Nature in this poem.
The tone is happy until the last two
lines. Alas, summer has gone, a pheno-
menon recorded often by Emily. She
feels acutely the passing of this most
joyous, carefree season.

I dreaded that first robin so,

But he is mastered now,

And I'm accustomed to him grown,--

He hurts a little, though.

I thought if I could only live
Till that first shout got by,
Not all pianos in the woods
Had power to mangle me.

I dared not meet the daffodils,
For fear their yellow gown
Would pierce me with a fashion
So foreign to my own.

I wished the grass would hurry,
So when 'twas time to see,

He'd be too tall, the tallest one
Could stretch to look at me.

I could not bear the bees should
come,

I wished they'd stay away

In those dim countries where they
go:

What word had they for me?

They're here, though; not a crea-
ture failed,

No blossom stayed away

In gentle deference to me,

The Queen of Calvary.

Each one salutes me as he goes,
And I my childish plumes

Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment
Of their unthinking drums.

SMALL TOWN GIRL

Small Town Girl is the story of
Colleen growing up in the Sixties. We
meet her plotting and scheming to be-
come best friends with Ruthanne whose
father is doing "cellar renovations."
Colleen sees Ruthanne as her big chance
for survival when the Russians push the
button. (Bomb shelters, civil defense
drills, anti-communist propaganda, and
horror stories of the effects of radia-
tion bring the early Sixties sharply in-
to focus.)

Colleen hangs out in the Catholic
cemetery where the paths are named for
the passion and suffering of Jesus
Christ; she goes to a Catholic school
where Sister Mary Edwina dramatically
likens the Red Menace to "an octopus
lunging at the free world"; and she
writes poems in which everybody is dead.

As the Sixties unfold, Colleen en-
ters adolescence, and although her life
is not particularly unique or unusual,
we, disarmed by the deceptive simplici-
ty of the narration, experience a dis-
quieting sense of the familiar. A very
natural empathy develops as we see

ALL SHE WROTE

JULY / AUGUST

Emily's intimacy with Nature is
painful in this poem. "I could not
bear the bees should come," is oppo-
site in feeling to "The bee is not afraid
of me." "What word had they for me?"
she asks sadly. She has forgotten her

earlier feeling that they, "Receive me
cordially." In fact, she feels so
gray and down that daffodils, yellow
gown would pierce me with a fashion so

foreign to my own. 
The tone of this poem is withdrawn

and hopeless. When we are terribly un-
happy with ourselves, beauty, friend-
ship and love are impossible to accept.
She calls herself, "The Queen of Cal-
vary." Here Calvary refers to a men-
tal state, especially one of deep an-
guish. Nature and her "people" are a
reminder to Emily of the anguish and
separateness she feels inside as she
writes this poem.

So as Nature differs in her seasons
of birth and death, so does Emily dif-
fer in her feelings towards Nature.
She accepts the death-blow of frost in
a dark glen, but sarcastically accuses
frost of “accidental power" as "frost
beheads." She laments the loss of the
innocent flower to frost. On the
other hand, a flower is foreign to her
in "I dreaded that first robin so."
She is joyful in the company of Na-
ture's creatures until she is hurting
psychologically, then she cannot face
them. And Emily can objectively see
Nature as an artist at work creating
dazzling snow scenes or a sunset of
many hues. These different perspec-
tives of Nature are the mark of a
sensitive poet. Emily was able to
write from various mindsets to show
us Nature in all its temperaments and
actions.

Colleen through the ups and downs of 943-0538
her friendship with Ruthanne, the guilt
and solace provided by her Catholic re-
ligion, and her first encounters with
the hatred of bigotry and the pres-
sures of conformity. We watch her
make choices, but, best of all, we see
her begin to understand those choices.
Perhaps, just a little, Colleen
shakes us out of our complacency, com-
pelling us to examine our sometimes
cynical acceptance of realities we
didn't choose. Remember: Colleen is
but one of many who grew up and spoke
out, who marched for peace and civil
rights, and who questioned and chal-
lenged the very fiber of American socie-
ty.
