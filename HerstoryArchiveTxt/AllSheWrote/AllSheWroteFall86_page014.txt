FALL 1986

THE FEDERAL TRAVEL GROUP  
PRESENTS: CLUB FED  

by: Pam Grycner  

You don’t have to travel  
abroad to distant lands to  
experience a different way of  
life, a different way of  
thinking and doing things, or  
a different language. All you  
have to do is join the Federal  
Travel Group and you are  
automatically consigned to  
membership in a most exclusive  
club nestled in the pastoral,  
rolling hills of Kailua,  
Hawaii, called Club Fed.  

You can impress your friends  
with touting a foreign  
language, and flaunting the  
reputation of being a world  
traveller, without ever  
leaving home, and without  
incurring the cost, or  
inconvenience, of flying to  
far away lands. You can  

forget the hassles of travel  
for a long time, and the  
inconveniences it entails,  
sitting in a cramped airplane  
seat, suffering the delays  

caused by baggage claim and  
customs clearance, and the  
possible embarrassment of  
mistaking someone else's  
luggage for your own that may  
have been sabotaged with  
illicit drugs or other  
contraband. Or, finding that  
your baggage took a detour to  
the other side of the world,  
and you left home without the  
American Express Card.  

Our society has not yet come to  
grips with the problems of  
prisons. As an institution, our  
penal and correctional system  
projects the image they are  
deterring crime and  
rehabilitating criminals. The  
truth is that the conditions in  
most of America’s jails and  

prisons virtually ensure  
psychological impairment and  
physical deterioration due to  

overcrowding, and lack of staff  
to supervise proper recreation.  

Reform and rehabilitation are  
the reasons believed by society  
that criminals are sent to  

prisons; however, systematic  
dehumanization is the reality.  
Again, punishment is the  

element of treatment.  

In my opinion, due to the  
Mandatory Sentencing laws, our  
prisons in Hawaii are packed to  
capacity. This has been

Club Fed is a surprisingly  
different cultural experience,  
in which tattoos, profanity,  
chain smoking, and aggression  
are socially condoned, and  
vigorously practiced.  

At Club Fed you can learn a  

charming foreign language,  
called pidgin, which is quite  
easy to learn, no prior  
knowledge of any modern  
language is required. At Club  

Fed you do not have to bother  

with learning any foreign  
currency, because at Club Fed  
there is no exchange of  

currency, the only exchanges  
made at the Club are exchanges  
of friendly greetings.  
However, Club Fed is not a  
social club, it is a haven for  
those who need to be removed  

from society, and the mind  
games social intercourse  
incites. In this regard,  
visitation with the outside is  
carefully monitored, as is  
personal mail. The content of  
all incoming personal mail is  
censored for anything which  
might compel our guests to  

plan an early departure.  
Moreover, the nuisance of  
receiving packages and gifts  
from social climbing friends  
is expertly prevented by our  
staff, who take the burden of  
opening and disposing of these  
unwanted tokens in the spirit  
of protecting guests from the  
unsavory tasks of sending out  
thank you notes, and  
reciprocating.  

For $52 a day enjoy the  
intrigue and mystery of living  

in a foreign country, with all  

the conveniences of home.  
Club Fed offers quaint,  
nostalgic dormitory style  
accommodations, English style  

community bathrooms, and all  
you can eat buffet style  
dining. For recreation, you  
do not have to engage in  
swimming, racquetball,  
horseback riding, or other  
mundane activities not offered  
at Club Fed.  

Transportation to and from  
Club Fed is provided by  
Federal Limousine Service, who  
whisk you to your destination  
in the height of station wagon  
comfort. All Federal Comfort  
Coaches are equipped with  
luxurious extras such as  
hydraulic shock absorbers,  
seat belts, air conditioning,  
contemporary music, and Robert  
Urich look-a-like chauffeurs.  

Stop by your neighborhood  
Federal Travel Group office  
and let them design a vacation  
package no one else but you  
deserves!  

We need to have people who mean something  
to us; people to whom we can turn, knowing  

that being with them is coming home.--R.  
Cooke  

Our educational opportunities  

have improved dramatically,  
overcrowding has eased;  
however, it’s still a problem,  

and we are also very short of  
staff.  

As for myself, I was sentenced  
under the Mandatory Sentencing  
Law established in 1980. And  
because it was a class A  
felony, the judge was bound by  
law to give me the maximum of  

20 years and my minimum term  
was set by the Hawaii Paroling  
Authority.  

It does not matter how I feel  
about my sentence, but the  
question that constantly  
disturbs my mind is this: if  
given the opportunity, what  
sentence would the judge have  
given me as opposed to that  
which I was given by H.P.A.?  

The time for change is  
now...1986.
