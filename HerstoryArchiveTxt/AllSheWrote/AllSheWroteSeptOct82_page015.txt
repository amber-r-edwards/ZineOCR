Going out Alone

Sandra "Sam" Horn

Tues. Sept. 14 7-9:30 pm $15

If you've ever sat home because
there's no friend to go out with....

- if you feel awkward eating alone in a
restaurant....or if you think you
won't have fun unless there's someone
else to share the experience; then
this class is for you. We'll discuss

tivities in the area for the not-so-

Negotiation is not just a skill
practiced in boardrooms. We all prac-
tice it daily when reaching agreements
with others. Whether you're negotiat-
ing a car repair bill or your next
raise; learn how to get what you want
without alienating others. Special
tips on how to deal confidently with
intimidating people/situations.

Risk-Taking

Sandra "Sam" Horn

Tues. Sept. 28 7-9:30 pm $15

Studies show that people who take
risks lead more active and satisfying
lives. Yet many of us opt for secur-
ity and stick to the "tried and true”
rather than chance new/unfamiliar
situations. If you're contemplating
a change, (switch of careers, marital
status, whatever), but are worried
about the consequences; come to this
informative discussion. You'll leave
with a step-by-step guide to success-
ful risk-taking and with motivation
to put it into practice.

MALUHIA O'WAHINE
BEGINS

Women, children, and men who are
victims of abuse, whether it is emo-
tional, sexual, or physical need sup-
port. Historically, problems in the
family have been kept a secret.

Working towards the prevention and re-
duction of violence as a means of re-
solving conflict or as an acceptable
expression of anger involves breaking
the cycle of silence; we must share
the secrets, end the isolation, and
learn new ways of solving problems.

A group for battered women is begin-
ning in September... Information,
personal experiences will be shared,
skill-building exercises will be
presented, and a resource guide will
be given so we can learn more about our-
selves, our culture, and ways to take
better care of ourselves.

The group will meet once a week for
a couple of hours, and will be limited
to a total of ten women. Any woman
who feels she needs the support of a
group to help her understand the vio-
lence in her life, and what she can do
within a violent relationship is wel-
come to join; violence can be physi-
cal, sexual, or emotional.

There will be two separate groups.

A battered woman can join either the
Wednesday 7-9 PM group or the Friday
9:30-11:30 group. The groups are be-
ing organized by Martha Ross and Nanci
Kreidman. Nanci is one of the crea-
tors of Komo Mai, a group for men who
abuse women; she served on the Hawaii
State Committee for Battered Women, and
she produced the film documentary,
Too Many Lickins'. Martha worked for
one year at Victim/Witness Kokua Ser-
vices as a student intern, where she
helped battered women obtain restrain-
ing orders and provided counseling for
both battered women and abusive men.
Martha is currently working on both a
resource booklet for battered women
and a Battered Women's Emergency Re-
source Card to be provided to women by
police officers responding to a
domestic violence incident.

The groups will be held at the Uni-
versity YWCA. There will be a slight
fee for services, but no one will be
turned down because of the lack of
money. 
For more information, call Martha
Ross at 734-0438 or Nanci Kreidman at
262-6489.
