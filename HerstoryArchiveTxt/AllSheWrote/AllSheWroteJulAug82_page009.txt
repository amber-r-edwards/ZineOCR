19862

On Memorial Day 1982, in the midst  
of media hype and official glorification  
of men who participate in war, a small  
group of Honolulu feminists remembered  
those women made homeless, raped, or  
killed in war.  

A single black carnation was placed  
on the 100 flagpoles at Punchbowl ceme-  
tery with the message,  

"In memory of women; the forgotten  
victims of war."  

This local "zap action" is part of  
the resurgence of such brief, dramatic  
feminist protests across the country  
recently. Other examples have been the  
weaving of a peace web around the Pen-  
tagon, physical disruption of the Cong-  
ressional “Human Life" Amendment debate,  
the Santa Cruz Stack O'Prints Mutila-  
tion, and "accidental" spoilings of  
porno magazines in Seven Eleven stores  
in California. It is hoped that the  
Honolulu Memorial Day zap action will  
support other struggles against the  
patriarchy.

P.S. Last year the Women's Summer  
Gathering was called "The Summer Sol-  
stice Celebration". Our faces are red,  
because Hawaii is in a latitude that  
does not experience a solstice. Hence  
forth, the gathering shall be called

I'VE EARNED MY  
MID-LIFE CRISIS  

A few words about this mid-life crisis  
that is going to be almost as exciting  
as my first Molokai crossing. I am not  
necessarily a slow learner, but it  
seems a number of years passed before  

I accepted the fact of life that change  
is the only steady and predictable  
force...so why fight it, just join it  
and relish in the potential it has for  
you. But why change when you've final-  
ly arrived (whatever that is supposed to  
mean)--you know, successful career,  
bought the house and car, birthed and  
raised the babies, traveled, etc., etc.,  
is it not a contradiction that one  
could "have all that" and be in con-  
flict, despair or even disappointment  
at the crest of fulfilling such dreams?  
(Is any of this sounding familiar to  
some of you over 40 years old?)  

In my recent experience, this thing  
called "mid-life crisis" is other-than-  
described, for it is not an explosion  
of emotions, a divorce, or a career  
change alone, it is the potential for  
that wonderful moment of awareness  

when you finally acknowledge "I own my  
own life." It no longer belongs to  

"them," that is, to rank, to status, to  
money, to attitudes and judgments of  
others: it belongs only to me—and my  
inner-directedness that now prevails.  

we've known for all these years.  

I am embarking on a new life career  
with a sense of immediacy and fullness,  
and I am excited to learn that adult-  
hood in the middle years is not that  
plateau before the spiraling decline,  
but rather is the opportunity for  
dynamic, upward change. Many people  
fail to realize their talents because  
they stop short of fulfillment and  
accept the external and internal mes-  
sages of prohibitions that come from  
all others around you (with the few  
refreshing exceptions of those who  
truly support you).  

Well, for any of you middle-aged  
"Riggers" who wish to identify with  
these remarks, welcome to the most ex-  
hilarating, provocative, soul-stirring  
time of your life. For the others of  
you who wish to remain "stuck," do not  
resent the courage and craziness of  
others. Get hold of what is signifi-  
cant for you and do it the best you  
can. Yes, there is a race against  
time...for we pass this way but once.
