The University YWCA is under new
management. On April 30, I was
appointed Executive Director.

I'm really excited about all the
possibilities for the future. I
can feel the energy level rising
every day.

Womanpower is a wonderful thing
to see in action, and that's what
the University YWCA is all about.
Women seeing needs and banding
together to change the situation
through collective action.

If you want to be a part of it
all, stop by and see me at 1820
University Avenue or give me a
call at 538-7061 x234 or 531-3050
to set up an appointment.

I hope you all will join me at
the University YWCA for a
Spaghetti Dinner (only $2) on Fri-
day, May 18, at 6:30 p.m. Families
and friends are welcome. The
Coffeehouse will be open afterwards.
Until then,

CHILD CARE IS EVERYBODY'S ISSUE

Children. We all have them or
know someone who has them. Most of

us know someone who is dealing with
the distractions of inadequate care.

Fathers, as well
as mothers, are dealing with this
reality.

There are approximately 10,000
infants on Oahu and licensed care
exists for only 1,000 of them.

About 86,000 children in public
school grades K-6 need after school
care. There are licensed places for
2,000.

If you, as a parent, are tired
of being told by experts what the
needs are; if you feel their expla-
nations don't meet your needs, then
it's time to talk back. A planning
committee has been formed to gather
information from parents. You have
a chance to share your thoughts or
experiences with childcare on Oahu.

AMEDIA TASK FORCE SEEKS LIAISON

The Media Task Force of the Hono-
lulu County Committee on the Status of
Women is looking for liaisons with any
organization not yet represented. The
representative would be expected to at-
tend the monthly meetings held every second
Thursday of each month.

The Media Task Force seeks to
influence the local media in eliminating
stereotypes and sex biases in the
portrayal of women and to encourage the
quality and widen the scope of their
coverage.

When Flo Kennedy, an outspoken
Black feminist lawyer, was here in
Honolulu, she had one message for
her audience. Get involved in the
political process or suffer the
consequences. She urged us to reg-
ister with the Democratic Party and
attend the March 13 precinct meet-
ings. An added incentive was a new
party rule mandating equal repre-
sentation of women and men in the
election of precinct delegates to
the state convention.

The nineteenth district precinct
meetings took place at Hokulani
School. About eighteen of us in
one precinct gathered in a corner
of the cafeteria. More than half
were a core group of old-timers;
the rest of us were newcomers to
the precinct.

After some initial confusion re-
garding the eligibility of the new-
comers, the meeting was called to
order. With their control of the
votes, the old-timers elected a
slate of precinct officers prac-
tically without opposition. There
was no discussion of candidates'
views on issues. After the elec-
tion, we were told (erroneously)
that because of their elected
positions, two of the officers—
both men—were automatic state con-
vention delegates. Since three
delegates were to be selected from
our precinct, that left just one
woman delegate to be chosen. She,
of course, was another old-timer.

Citing the equal representation
rule, a newcomer suggested we
specify the two women alternates
as first and second choices, and
the male alternate as third choice,
should the selected delegates be
unable to attend the convention.
This was voted down by the old-
timers. As one noted, there was
the danger of our precinct dele-
gates being "all girls."

As it turned out, the two male
officers were automatic delegates
to the county, not the state con-
vention. So, on April 3, another
meeting was called to vote on the
state delegate slots. The results
were predictable: the same two
men were selected. One newcomer
commented, "What did you need us
for?"

What, I asked myself later, is
the lesson to be learned from all
this? It is not that involvement
in the political process is a
waste of time, because in this
grassroots election, a handful of
us could have changed its outcome.
The lesson is this: enough of us need to shake
our apathy and cynicism and become
part of the process. Only then can
we, together, truly democratize it.

Editor's Note:

The National NOW Times recently
said “although 6 million more wom-
en than men voted in 1980, 14
million registered women did not
vote." Ronald Reagan was a result
of this apathy on the part of wom-
en voters. Few women would disagree
that women should have equal treat-
ment under the law. Unfortunately,
this will only come when women are
more equally represented in gov-
ernment. The easiest step in this
direction is to REGISTER and VOTE.
The next step is to become in-
volved on a local level—starting
with precinct meetings. As
Cynthia said when she handed in
her article—"If more women were
there, this couldn't have hap-
pened." Let's not let it happen
again.
