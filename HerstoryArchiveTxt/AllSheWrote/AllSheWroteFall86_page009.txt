ALL SHE WROTE

Marriage Under Apartheid

Women of the world do not fully
appreciate the problems of women
under apartheid. If they understood,

they would put pressure on their

governments to understand our

Marriage is not worthwhile for us

Black women. It traps us. Men are
having it all right in town with their
girlfriends and the money, while we
must keep home on empty pockets and

empty promises.

We feel deserted. We

feel lonely in this desolate place
where so many husbands must leave to
find work. They stay away all year,
sometimes many years. We have pity for
our husbands. We know why they must
have town girls—men are men—and we
also know why they want us to stay
here, to keep home for them and to make
a place for their children because we
have no rights to live in the cities.
We will tell you what sometimes
happens to us. We do not want to hear
about it, we do not want to talk about
it, because it is wrong, and it is
hurtful, very hurtful—how we are
forced to give our husbands to other
women, sometimes our very own sisters.

This is how it happens. I do not
hear from my husband for many months.
The money has stopped coming, even when
I cry for it, it does not come. My

children are hungry. No food. No

money. My neighbors lend me money to
go to Cape Town to look for my husband.
It is a long way. I am tired and
hungry. I am shown the way to the
place where my husband lives. It is a
men's hostel, a big grey building.
Many, many men, but also women and
children.

I hold my children close to me. I
search for my husband. His brother
comes to me. My husband is living
elsewhere I am told, but he comes
sometimes. His clothes are still
there, but his bed is taken by others.
I sleep on the floor until my husband
arrives. He is not pleased to see me.
He is angry, embarrassed. He looks
away but eventually he tells me about
this other woman. She is a domestic
worker in Cape Town.

I can sense that it is this woman
who has been eating the money that my
husband should have been sending to me
and our children. She is now fat and
attractive. I am starved and ugly in
my husband's eyes. I have become a
burden to my very own husband. I am
weak and he could pick me up, but he
doesn't. He leaves. He goes back to
this other woman. This is so painful.
So cruel. And I cannot go back home
and face everyone. I came to town because I needed money for
my husband's home and now I have no
money, no home. His brother and other
home-boys must help me. They give me
his bed. It is in the same room with
them. But it is very little. Because
I need support, I am forced to take
boyfriends who will give me a little

money now and then.

I have nothing. I

And so I become the town woman for

my husband's brothers. But they are

married. I know their wives. I cannot

bear to think about what they would say

at home. It is all so painful. And so

we women in Llinge do not want to hear
about what happens with our husbands in
the city.

The mines are always raided at
night by the police and government

inspectors. Women like myself are

arrested—unless we have money at our
sides to pay up, or maybe if I have a
baby at my breast or in my arms. But
when this happens I know I have no more

chance with my husband. This is the

final break.

The foregoing is excerpted from

an interview with an unidentified
woman living in Llinge, a resettle-
ment township in Transkei, near
Blacks who have been evicted from
farms claimed by whites. Since
local employment is nonexistent,
most of the men are forced to
migrate in search of work.
Although this interview was
conducted in October 1978 (by
Janet Graaff, reprinted from
South African Outlook, November
1978 by Connexions, Spring 1986,
No. 20), the political situation
that creates the conditions des-
cribed in it has not changed.

AALELE HISTORY

1965 student YWCA takes stand
opposing apartheid in South Africa and
urges the National Board to investi-
gate its investments.

1968 The first Student YWCA Black
Caucus was held in Atlanta before the
National Student Conference. During
the conference, it was instrumental
in restructuring the governance of
the Student YWCA to be more truly
representative of its constituency.

1970 The national YWCA adopted

the One Imperative: TO THRUST OUR
COLLECTIVE POWER TOWARD THE

ELIMINATION OF RACISM WHEREVER IT
EXISTS AND BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.
