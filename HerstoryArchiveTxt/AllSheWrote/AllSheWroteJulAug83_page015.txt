CONCERT REVIEW

WOODY SIMMONS

The long anticipation of the Woody  
Simmons Concert gathered a momentum  
that sustained a rich and mellow at-  
mosphere the evening of March 13,  
1983. Woody's comfortable presence  
and easy manner blended the diversity  
of songs from past to present with a  
natural style, revealing the develop-  
ment of her artistry. Her classical  
background evident in the precision of  
her technique combined with the  
fine quality of her voice, a variety  
of instruments and lyrics relevant to  
our lives as wimmin. This enhanced  
the close conversational rapport with  
her audience.

Purple Heart Productions is to be  
commended for playing an instrumental  
part in bringing womon's music to  
Hawaii. The stage was a visual bal-  
ance of beauty and welcome; a womon's  
concert setting. The sound equipment,  
located in the far reaches of an up-  
per level, made some technical diffi-  
culties in projecting quality sound.  
Coming recently from the east coast  
and many experiences of wimmin's con-  
certs there, I was taken by surprise  
by the open, flowing gaiety weaving  
before, during and after the concert.  
Much of this was supported by the  
warm invitation of the production  
staff. The evening's energy rose to

a full audience ovation and three  
well-received encores, ending with a  
crowning banjo piece, Banjo Raga,  
a piece that never falters and seems  
to ripen with age.

We look forward to Woody's return.

out against sexual harassment (Tatrobe, Adelaide, Perth); 5) identifying  
and owning the problems (Honolulu, Tatrobe); 6) migrant and immigrant  
group problems (Darwin, Honolulu);  

7) nuclear issues (Wellington).  

All of the groups concurred that  
there was need for local Y's to be in-  
volved in political action if they  
were going to have any impact on these  
issues either locally, nationally, or  
internationally.  

Barbara and Priscilla reported on  
the programs and lack of programs or  
work on these areas and Barbara is  
sending Wellington a copy of her re-  
search at U.H. on Ethnicity and its  
effect on Rape Trauma requested by  
Elizabeth.
