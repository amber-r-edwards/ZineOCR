THOSE SAME  

Last issue I wrote an arti-  
cle on isms which divide us;  
especially racism. All the  
time I wrote that article,  
there seemed to be a real high  
as far as women working together,  
as sisters, to unite this  
women’s community. Now, two  
months later, the goal is still  
there but the commitment to  
work towards that goal seems  
partially lost. I'm getting  
a lot of feedback on what I  
wrote, but much of that feed-  
back is coming in the form of  
excuses. The time and energy  
spent formulating these excuses  
is just what is keeping us di-  
vided. Why not use that same  
time and energy to confront  
racism? Only by confronting  
the isms will we move in the  
direction of uniting, as sis-  
ters, in this community.

My friend, Yolanda Retter,  
has given me permission to  
print the following; which is  
a combination of her articles  
from Spinning Off (May 1980),  
Lesbian News (Oct. 1986) and  
her personal letter to me (Nov.  
1981).

Some Myths About Racism  

or  
The Wonderbread Woman's Excuse  
Closet  

1. Women of color have to make  

2. It's better for us to think  
of ourselves as all the same  
under the skin.

3. When white women are vehe-  
ment, they are assertive. When  
women of color are vehement,  
they are hostile.

4. Fighting for racial justice  
on a societal level will clear  
me on a personal level.

5. We can't do it if women of  
color don't help us.

6. The process shouldn't be so  
painful.

7. I'm damned if I do, I'm damn-  
ed if I don't.

8. I can probably change my  
racism without feeling as strong-  
ly about the issue as I do  
about sexism or lesbophobia.

9. I'm not a racist, my lover  
is a woman of color.

10. Why can't we just treat each  
other as people?

11. Women of color sabotage  
their efforts by being so radi-  
cal.

12. I have so many issues to  
work on; I am overextended; I  
have to set priorities.

13. I am not a racist. I was  
brought up in a mixed neighbor-  
hood; there are black women on  
my softball team.

14. Women of color are them-  
selves racist.

15. I've been to racism work-  
shops; I've worked on my racism  
for two years. What more do  
they want?

16. What can you expect from me,  
I was brought up in a racist so-  
ciety.

ISMS  

17. In order to survive in this  
world, one must be patient and  
moderate. Changes take time,  
you can't hurry people.

18. Women of color are not the  
only ones who've been oppressed.  
Do you know what I've been  
through?

19. If Racism = Prejudice + Power,  
how can women in a male domi-  
nated society be racist?

20. I will jeopardize my job or  
my position with groups I belong  
to if I come on too strong about  
racism.

21. There is no caring in the  
energy that women of color dis-  
play at racism workshops.

Above is a sample list of the  
excuses that white women are  
using to avoid the realities of  
their racism and the realities  
of the process of change. Under  
the guise of being offended by  
our “anger", white women avoid  
the fact that racism is deeply  
ingrained and difficult to fer-  
ret out, the fact that the pro-  
cess is very painful when it is  
most authentic, and the fact  
that it takes a courage and com-  
mitment beyond the current abil-  
ity and interest of too many  
white women.

Changing requires that a  
white woman peer very closely  
into her excuse closet and lo-  
cate, examine and itemize her  

confronting and changing her  
racist consciousness. The per-  

sonal work on this issue should  

come first, because it is all  

too easy for a white woman to  

ignore her personal racism while  

fighting it on a societal level.  

If a white woman is to suc-  
ceed in minimizing her racism,  
she must learn to LOOK into a  
sister of color and SEE some of  
the personal realities of the  
women of color. She must see  
what abuse, disdain and disre-  
spect has been the experience of  
the woman of color. She must  
remember that the treatment is  
due to the fact that that woman's  
skin is not white. The white  
woman can then ask herself how  
polite and patient she would be  
in the woman of color's place.  
Rest assured that once a woman  
of color has analyzed her exper-  
ience in a political light,  
unless she is a saint, she will  
no longer be patient or polite  
with low consciousness racism  
or escapist attitudes.

To change her racism, a white  
woman must be as offended and  
affected by the issue as she is  
about sexism and/or lesbophobia.  

Without a "gut" connection to  
the issue, a white woman cannot  
develop the conviction and per-  
severance that can carry her  
beyond intellectualizing. She  
must learn to listen when she  

is at a racism workshop and wo-  
men of color are giving her in-  
formation. In order to hear, a  
white woman must become aware of  
her inclinations to escape, to
