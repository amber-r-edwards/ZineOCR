Purpose of the University YWCA

The Young Women's Christian  
Association of the University  
of Hawaii, historically rooted  
in the Christian faith but now  
embracing a multiplicity of  
faiths, seeks to respond to the  
challenge of social change.

The Association draws together  
into responsible membership women  
and girls of diverse experiences  
and faiths, that their lives may  
be open to new understanding and  
deeper relationships and that together  
they may join in the struggle  
for peace and justice, freedom and  
dignity for all people.

One Imperative

To thrust our collective power  
toward the elimination of racism  
wherever it exists and by any  
means necessary.

University YWCA = Past-Present-Future  
by Petra Lenz, University YWCA  
Board President

Until this year, the University YWCA  
has been administratively and financially  
linked to the YWCA of Oahu. Programs  
at the University Y were planned  
and administered by a policy-making Board  
of management with financial support  
from Oahu. — both  
differed.

Because the Univ. Y is already  
considered a separate Student Assoc.  
by the National YWCA, it was mutually  
decided that the Univ. Y should  
be independent. Since this decision,  
two years ago, the Univ. Y has been  
undergoing a transition towards  
autonomy. This year we are formally  
incorporating as the University  
of Hawaii YWCA.

Many organizational changes have  
occurred and are still occurring at  
the Univ. Y. Our goals for 1985  
are to expand our programs and to  
increase involvement with the  
University community. We are looking  
forward to the challenges of  
being a fully independent  
organization.

Volunteer Opportunities at the  
University YWCA

Looking for a satisfying project to  
help you acquire new skills, grow per-  
sonally, and get out of your study/  
work routine? Consider these possi-  
bilities:

All She Wrote, the University YWCA  
newspaper, publishes news, features,  
reviews, fiction, poetry and graphic arts,  
with a focus on women. Volunteers  
choose what they want to do: write,  
edit, do graphic arts, type, paste up,  
sell ads, or help with distribution.

Woman's Word Bookstore, Hawaii's only  
feminist bookstore, offers a selection  
of books, many from small presses, in-  
cluding children's books. Volunteers  
order, sell, plan publicity and special  
events, and make signs and displays.

The Coffeehouse provides a congenial  

University YWCA Alumnae Reunite

In celebration of the founding of  
the Student YWCA, alumnae gathered in  
reunions held across the country.

Over fifty University YWCA alumnae,  
many tracing their University YWCA  
ties from the 1940s and '50s, came  
together for a reunion luncheon at  
the Halekulani on November 18, 1984.

Organized by Mary Ann Sato Saito  
and her committee, the luncheon fea-  
tured speaker Mary Ann Lundy of the  
National Student YWCA. Lundy spoke of  
the heritage of the Student YWCA, and  
its continuing commitment to social  
change—reflected in voter registration  
activities, anti-racism workshops,  
women's crisis centers, and many other  
programs. Diane Baird, secretary of  

Our Herstory: The Other Side  
by Mahina Dauer

As we observe Women's History Week  
with various celebratory films, pro-  
jects, speeches, etc., let us  

not forget a condition that  

has marred women's history and con-  
tinues to do so to the present day. I  
refer to violence, threatened or actual,  
committed through the privilege of  

male power over (and punctuated by  

male contempt for) women.  
Violence and the threat of violence  

confront us every day on the street, at  
our jobs, and worst of all in our  
homes, the one area in which we should  
be totally safe. It takes many subtle  
forms and is not always recognizable  
for what it is. Consider some simple  
examples. An obscene comment on the  
street: We are supposed to ignore it,  
or actually be afraid to reply be-  
cause it is backed by the threat of  
violence, or more accurately, rape.

A man coercing a woman into close  
physical contact by 1) crowding her so  
that she has to brush against him as  
she passes, or 2) reaching out during  
a conversation to, say, touch her arm,  
and "accidentally" touching the side  
of her breast instead: This is a vio-  
lation of our physical integrity and  
our right to determine with whom we  
will choose to have physical contact,  
intimate or otherwise.

Readers’ Viewpoints

and violence work very well to keep us  

with more obvious ones such as:  
pornography, beatings, rapes, mutila-  
tions and murders, real and fictional-  
ized.  
tures and witch burnings in Europe and  
the United States, attacks on women in  
the street, the power drill mutilation/  
murder in Brian de Palma's movie  

"Body Double",  
date rape and marital rape—the  
list seems endless.  
In addition to the list is the wave of  
terroristic bombings of abortion  
clinics across the country,  
another denial of our right to self  
determination through the use of  
violence and fear—tantamount to  
violent rape!

When will all this stop? When will  
we finally be accepted as equally  
human—the first step towards true  
equality?

the University YWCA Board of Direc-  
tors reported on the University  
YWCA today as it faces the challenge  
of incorporation and independence in  
1985.

The alumnae exchanged memories of  
trips to the YWCA conference center  
at Asilomar, California; meetings at  
Hale Wahine, Seaview, and "R" House;  
and frosh camps and other activities  
shared with the YMCA. From their  
University YWCA experiences, the  
alumnae formed friendships which have  
endured through decades.

The success of the first reunion  
prompted requests for a second. If  
you know any alumnae who would like to  
be placed on the alumnae mailing list,  
contact the University YWCA, 1820 University  
Avenue, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822.

Women coerced into intimate or  
sexual contact by their lovers or hus-  
bands: This has got to be the worst  
use of male power through the threat  
of fear—fear of losing the men's  
"love," fear of appearing unreceptive,  
fear that they will withdraw emotional-  
ly in revenge, fear of violence, even  
rape, if we refuse too adamantly.

Although the subtle forms of threat  

in our place, we must also contend  

Cases in point are: the tor-
