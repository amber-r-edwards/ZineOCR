LIFESTYLES OF THE '80s  
or DON'T YOU WISH  

Hello again. It's good to be back  
from my leave of absence. I hope I  
was missed as much as I missed every-  
one else.  

The article you are now reading  
(this one) is of a different sort. It  
wants to be a Reader/Contributor col-  
umn when it grows up. I'll explain  
the details at the end. Right now...  
Read on.  

Well, the summer's over and the  
coffee house has re-opened and life is  
back to the September Swing. Don't  
you wish there'd been a beach just for  
Sisters this past summer? Or how  
about a sister with a fishing boat  
that she'd charter to family.  

Speaking of family, I recently made  
my pilgrimage back to the MCC and was  
refreshed to see the large number of  
women who came out for worship. Or-  
chids to the men at MCC and their  
raised consciousnesses. If you can  
appreciate a non-sexist church ser-  
vice, look into what the MCC has to  
offer. There are no he's and him's  
in the dialog of the entire service.  
The Ministry and Deaconate have a  
natural philosophy of equality which  
makes for a very comfortable atmos-  
phere. So, if some spiritual guidance  
is in order for your lifestyle, the  
MCC is the place.  

While we're talking about equality,  
don't you wish the ERA would finally  
pass? The fact that we seem to be  
"spitting in the wind" may indicate  
that we need to change our methods.  
Like, for instance, very few people  

know the words of the same name in so  

they go and make up their own mean-  
ings. People actually think that the  
ERA would result in unisex bathrooms  
(how grody!) and a rash of tokenism.  
For those of you not familiar with  
tokenism, it's when “minority”  
people, like women, are hired for a  
job regardless of their ability to do  
the tasks required in order for the  
company to fill their "quota." Well,  

let's reread the ERA and see if it  
says that. (I know that we already  
know it doesn't, but let's make sure).  

"Equality of rights under the  

law shall not be denied or  

abridged by the United  

States or by any state on  

account of sex."  
You know, that's so basic, that it  
should already be covered by the con-  
stitution. Read between the lines and  

you can plainly see what Congress is  
telling women we deserve.

Off! Don't rationalize...Oh, we  
don't want equality because we're not  
willing to lower our standards.  
Toughen up! Educate the masses sim-  
ply by printing the ERA everywhere  
you can until it is more recognized  
than the Pledge of Allegiance (which  
isn't so hard to do anymore). Don't  
they realize that if they pass the ERA  
they could draft us? Of course all  
the gay sisters and brothers wouldn't  
have to go because the government is  
still in the dark ages about that  
issue. So write the ERA everywhere  
it can be seen.  

Speaking of being seen...What  
about equal rights for gays? Some of  
my best friends are gay, not to men-  
tion some of my worst enemies. I  
look forward to my vision of the GAY  
90's. We have 7 years to turn the  
tables and make it a reality. Did  
you know that 300,000 people came out  
for gay pride in San Francisco? I  
wonder if we could get 300 in Honolu-  
lu (or 30 for that matter). I know  
that we're mellow and laid back in  
this community, but the Kuhio dis-  
trict and the Women's Center are  
growing and the rest of the Island is  
not.  

Don't you wish there was a women's  
bar on the leeward side? It's a long  
ride to Waikiki and even longer if  
you're not riding! Well, as long as  
this is a wish column, let's give the  
bar a live women's band and a small  
restaurant.  

Well, that’s all the wishing I  
have for this column. Now it's time  
to explain the Reader/Contributor  
portion.  

IF YOU: (1) Have a "Don't you wish”  
of your own, Write in!  

(2) Have the same Wish and  
would like to do some-  
thing about it, Write in!  

(3) Know of someone or some  
group who is already do-  
ing it, Write in!  

(4) Just have something rele-  
vant to say, Write in!

HAWAII WOMEN'S POLITICAL ACTION LEAGUE  

The Hawaii Women's Political Action  
League is a grass-roots political or-  
ganization that intends to help liber-  
al women candidates in their campaigns  
for public service offices. We target  
liberal women because they are under-  
represented in government.  

The Board of Directors of HWPAL met  
on August 7, and voted to give its en-  
dorsement to Welcome Fawcett, candidate  
for City Council, 3rd District;  

Jean King, gubernatorial candidate;  
and State House candidates, Mazie Hi-  
rono (20th District) and Joan Hayes  
(16th District).  

Earlier this summer, the Board en-  
dorsed City Council candidates,  

Marilyn Bornhorst (5th District) and  
Patsy Mink (9th District).  

Our endorsement means that we will do  
whatever we can to help these candi-  
dates get elected, such as sign-hold-  
ing, walking door-to-door, telephon-  
ing, registering voters, etc.  

Our other activities include hold-  
ing workshops, seminars, and other  
forms of training for our members so  
that we may learn more about the  
issues that are important to us and  
about the political process itself.  
Earlier this year we sponsored lec-  
ture-receptions for Gloria Steinem (who  
spoke to us on grass-roots organizing)  
and Alice Cook, whose topic was com-  
parable worth.  

GENERAL BACKGROUND. The Hawaii  
Women's Political Action League  
(HWPAL) was organized this year in re-  
sponse to a need for more liberal  
women in responsible public positions.  
It was felt that many of the concerns  
of women, such as affirmative action,  
child care, health services, and world  

peace have not been adequately repre-
