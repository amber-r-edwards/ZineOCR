ALL YOU WROTE

Dear All She Wrote Collective,

Frankly, it's a pity seeing
bastardized, butchered pidgin
in print. What was the pur-
pose? Was it to appease the
local women and make us feel
that we are accepted and no
longer targets of the writer's
"blatantly racist prejudices"?
I find it patronizing.

It seems to me the use of
pidgin is appropriate in every-
day conversations and literary
works, but when used incorrect-
ly to relay information in a
calendar of events - the beauty
of pidgin is lost. Marla's
poem was excellent. She re-
layed her thoughts and feelings
naturally. I can relate to
that. Otherwise, I appreciate
All She Wrote and look forward
to each issue.

Letter to All She Wrote
Collective

I'm pleased to see dis-
cussion of racism in your front

paper in the Jan/Feb news sheet.
I once had a white feminist
neighbor who told me she voted
for “all the women and all the
haoles" in the 1978 election. I
assumed she voted for all the
women who ran against men; haole
women over non-haole women; and
haole men over non-haole men.
Almost everybody does this

after a fashion, and it ends up
with decisions being made on the
basis of ethnic (or white)
identity.

The failure to reach out or
to learn about and appreciate
the styles of non-white ethnic
groups might be called racism
through neglect. Your collec-
tive is an unusual group in
that it is 1) white and 2)
concerned about this issue.

The ASW news sheets so far

seem to reflect an anti-racist
editorial policy which encour-
ages participation by non-white
women and which discourages
stereotyping of same.

One barrier to successful
reaching out is a kind of in-

tellectual elitism---an atti-
tude that those who are not as
enlightened are not worth
bothering with. This attitude,
along with a stereotype of local
(Asian/Pacific) women as a hope-
less group that buys into sex-
ism, may be one of the reasons
for the underrepresentation of
Asian/Pacific women in femin-
ist groups. While we all value
enlightenment, in western soci-
ety it is essentially a white
middle-class privilege, which
few non-whites have the oppor-
tunity to sample and assess.

But if some groups--through
privilege or otherwise--are
further advanced in their un-
derstanding of sexism, it is im-
portant that they not only
tolerate the "sexist" behaviors
of their less-privileged
sisters, but support the con-
sciousness-raising efforts of
all women. Caution must be
taken, however, to avoid a
missionary-like impression, as
Alice Chai points out.

I would like to hear femin-
ist (white and non-white)
thinking on stereotypes of
Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian,
Korean, Japanese, and Samoan
women; cooperation and rivalry
between white and Asian/Pacific
women; formation of a coalition
between white and non-white
women: pros and cons; role of
Asian/Pacific women in the
feminist movement.

Best wishes,
Carol Odo

In case you were wonder-
ing... I don't get paid to
work on this paper (and neither
does anyone else). I also
don't get paid for the love or
time I give my brothers and
sisters at the Metropolitan
Community Church (and neither
do they). NO... I am not ask-
ing for a raise, nor money of
any kind. I just want to tell
a little story. You see, a
couple of people that I know
(outside of the All She Wrote
Collective and the MCC) thought
I was foolish for giving with-
out receiving. Well, I didn't
want to go into any philosophy
lectures, so I said nothing and
continued to do my own thing.

I had my reasons and they were
good enough for me. Then, a
snag developed in my life, as
they often do, and I'll admit
it had me but good. I thought
I'd lost it. And lo and be-
hold, like ants from out of the
woodwork, came friends from All
She Wrote and the MCC to give
all kinds of support and en-
couragement. In record break-
ing time, I'm back to the old
me (with raised consciousness)
and rarin' to go. Granted,
support doesn't pay the rent,
but no paycheck ever did as
much for me and my inner well
being. So, to all who listened
and spoke, I give to you my
warmest Aloha and Mahalo and
prayers.

Affectionately,

Molly Dee

Letter:

Dear All She Wrote-

Aloha from Nanci in the
North. I have been meaning to
write & send for a subscription-
finally I sit down to do it.

I am in Alaska, working on
contract for the AWAIC Program-
Abused Women's Aid in Crisis.
It is a shelter program beyond
any I have experienced. I am
learning a great deal & hope to
bring all kinds of brilliance
to share with my sisters in
Hawaii.

In the meantime will you
send me All She Wrote? Maybe
even a couple back issues?

Very Truly Yours,
In Sisterhood,
Nanci Kriedman

Good paper - very interesting
articles. Bless you all for

giving so much of your energies
to do.
