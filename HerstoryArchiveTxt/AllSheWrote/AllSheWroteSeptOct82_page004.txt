So how does a woman pursue pro-  
fessional enrichment in her workplace  
in spite of sexism? What do success-  
ful women say about snide remarks,  
blatant prejudice, and harassment?  
Grinning can get grim unless you're  
winning from an offensive strategy  
with a great team. The process of  
moving from the defensive to the  
offensive front involves strategic  
planning, a clear vision of objec-  
tives, and a powerful support group.  
This assumes you're not ready to  
go live in the Wanderland with the  
Hillwomen, where you'll still find  
remnants of exclusivity and losers  
anyway.  

Every successful woman has an in-  
credible ability to work elbow to  
elbow with nerds. The ability to  
see beyond idiocy, to accomplish  
work goals, and to maintain a tre-  
mendous sense of humor significantly  
increases one's chances of success.  

Nobody wants to work with that ener-  
gy. If you know anyone who has  
reached this type of feeling about  
her work, encourage her to find an-  
other job. Then help her to es-  
tablish a successful position with-  
in that new group of people or the  
same old problems will begin again.  

Let's assume you work with an  
average cross-section of people in  
your job... You have the women who are  
the enlightened nine to fivers who  
are one (but not only) source of  
allies. You have the Archie Bunkers,  
the Buddha heads, the Peter Princi-  
ples, the Gentlemen who make a point  
of trying to be courteous and appro-  
priate. You have the people who are  
real winners at the corporate level.  
And maybe you have a woman who plays  
mother or stinkface. Generally most  
of the folks you work with play roles  
that are traditionally gender based.  
Over the past decade most of these  
people have developed either dim or  
acute understandings of how the  
Women's Movement has changed their  
work behavior. ie ;  

Decreasing sexist behavior can be  
good fun with a great deal of pa-  
tience and persistence. Assuming  
your workplace resembles the above  
assortment of personalities, here  
are a few ideas for enhancing your  
sanity and clout.  

First, begin to identify the image  
you want to project in your job. On  
paper, list the qualities you would  
like most to be known for. Brain-  
storm and let the words write them-  
selves. Revise this list later after  
you've had a few days to refine it.  
Use words like: “powerful, success-—

ful, authoritative, charismatic, good  
humored, good sport, accomplished,  
commanding, etc." Tell your mentor  
about this project, and enlist her  
assistance and advice. If you don’t  
have a mentor or two, now is the time  
to find one. Tell your best ally at  
work, your closest friend, and any  
important family or surrogates.  

These people need to know that you are  
developing yourself so that they can  
support you, and so that your positive  
thinking can begin to work for you.  
Anyone who laughs or undermines your  
efforts is not your buddy.  

When your list and support group  
have been identified, begin to act as  
if you are those things. If you  
don't know how to be admired or pow-  
erful, think of the one person who is  
that way, and act like she does.  
It'll take some practice and time,  
maybe six months, for a solid image  
change. Look at the way you dress,  
how your work rates, and at your re-  
lationships and mannerisms. There  
are a few good studies available on  
women's clothing, and they document  
the effects of lime green polyester  
pants versus pinstripes; jewelry, and  
grooming. Don't despair over the  
costs of a revised wardrobe. You can  
barter services for a tailor and the  
second hand shops have an unbelievable  
collection of quality clothing.  

Closely examine your mannerisms at  
work. Never exchange recipes, read  
personal advice columns at coffee  
break, giggle, or chitchat. I know  
this sounds like stuffy Amy Vander-  
bilt, but you will be treated in the  
manner you behave. Keep your work on  
purpose, and you will be treated like  
a professional.  

Enough on your changes. What about  
the idiot(s) you work with? Begin by  
encouraging the allies you have to  
respect women in their meetings,  
their references, and their salary  
assignments. Within a period of time  
everyone will unconsciously use the  
word "woman," not “girl.” People  
will begin to refrain from asking  
women to make coffee, type, or find  
things. It will become a company  
policy to not interrupt women's con-  
versations or work. At this point,  
there will be left a tiny minority  
of people who cling to sexism and  
patriarchy. (I know, dream on.) If  
you doubt the success of this stra-  
tegy, try watching television shows  
from the 1950s. You'll be amazed.  

Regarding the sexists, there are  
some marvelous ways to deal with their  
programs. Understand that their be-  
lief and value patterns work to sup-

port their notions of how life  
should work, just like yours and  
mine support ours.  

In order for a significant reversal of  
attitude to occur, there must be a  
goodie attached to the transition.  
There are no goodies available for  
hardcore right wingers, but some  
people can be won over at some  
levels.  

The best is that more and  
more businesses are realizing that  
women can make tremendous contri-  
butions to their work, and this  
value is seeping into every admin-  
istration, both corporate and po-  
litical.  

If you can't change a person  
straight out, go for the heart and  
win them over to your side from the  
behind. It works.  

Sounds like football, but  
this technique is a mixture of charm and persuasion.  
Hawaii's stateswoman Lt. Governor  
Jean King is an excellent example.  

Two years ago I watched her one  
night at a statewide golf tourney  
banquet, mingling with the crowd.  

She stopped to speak with a local  
public official, exchanging ideas  
about a recent labor dispute.  
Somehow the conversation got on  
the subject of the ERA. He turned  
sour and made a cutting remark  
about women's libbers.  
(My mouth dropped open.)  

The Lt. Governor's  
face beamed, and she asked him if  
he'd seen the third quarter touch-  
downs in the football game the  
night before? His face lit up, and  
the discussion soared! I under-  
stand he is supporting her guber-  
natorial campaign this year.  
"In order to live more amply,  
we need a finer spirit of hope and  
world, and we impoverish our—  
selves if we forget this errand.”
