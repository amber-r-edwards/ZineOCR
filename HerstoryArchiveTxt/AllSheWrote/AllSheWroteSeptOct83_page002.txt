PAGE 2 ALL SHE WROTE SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Dear Sisters:

I am Sachi Sakamoto, a supporter of
the Japanese Group for Abortion Rights
(JAGAR) in New York.

Although abortions have been avail-
able to Japanese women for 34 years
with the passage of the Eugenic Protec-
tion Law, the Japanese government is
attempting to revise the act for the
third time in ten years. The govern-
ment would eliminate the provision
granting abortion based on financial
inability to rear a child.

We are trying to stop the govern-
ment's attempt because if the provi-
sion is rescinded the effect would be
an increase in the number of illegal
abortions and, subsequently, attendant
health risks. JAGAR seeks complete re-
productive freedom which is insepara-
ble from women's social, economic, and
political freedom in a society.

We believe that an international
network of sisters is the most power-
ful tool in fighting discrimination
against women in all forms. Your co-
operation, therefore, would be greatly
appreciated in helping us prepare our
defense of women's rights in Japan.

Specifically, we urge you to write
a letter of protest to Koseisho (the

ministry of Health and Welfare which
is a branch of the Japanese govern-

ment).

We need a sharing of the abortion rights in the

U.S. as well as methods of birth con-
trol and sex education. Also, we wel-
come any valid arguments you may have
that would help our cause.

Please forward your letter to my
address. I will forward your corres-

pondence to JAGAR in Tokyo after trans-

lation. My deepest thanks to you for
your cooperation and service. My ad-
dress is:

Dear Director:

We are once again recruiting for en-
try-level police officers and are ask-
ing your assistance in getting the
word out.

The City and County of Honolulu
will accept applications for Police
Cadets and Metro Police Recruits from
August 15 through September 6. Appli-
cations will be available at Satellite
City Halls, Police substations and at
our office during this recruitment
period.

A concerted effort to recruit women
applicants for these positions was
launched in 1977 with the help of or-
ganizations such as yours. Today,
there are 71 women officers in the
Honolulu Police Department, well over
a three-fold increase since October
1975. Of these, 3 are detectives, 1
sergeant, 64 officers and 3 police
cadets.

We have enclosed a copy of the ex-
amination announcement. Please call
Mary Nakandakare, Recruitment Special-
ist, at 523-4975 for specific informa-
tion not covered in the announcement.

Thank you again for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Wallace Y. Kunioka
Director of Civil Service

Editor's Note: the deadline for apply-
ing was Sept. 6, 1983. Watch the loca

WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE ORIGINAL
WOMEN'S COFFEEHOUSE?

You remember the Women's Coffee-
house of 1979-1981, formerly held at
Friend's Meeting House in Manoa then
at Makiki Recreation Center on Keeau-
moku Street? The Women's Coffeehouse
closed down (temporarily we thought)
in March of 1981 in hopes that we
could redirect our energy to locating
a permanent space for the coffeehouse.
That never happened, and the need was
met by another group in the community
(Everywoman's Coffeehouse at the Uni-
versity YWCA).

Eventually the old coffeehouse col-
lective met in February/March of 1983
and decided to distribute its funds to
needy and like-minded women's groups.
Pele's Press received $200 and the re-
mainder of the funds ($426.27) was do-
nated as seed money to Womensplace, a
non-profit venture dedicated to estab-
lishing a rural retreat for women on
Oahu. Our vision included a women's
building where many kinds of feminist
activities could find a home and we be-
lieve Womensplace will provide such
an opportunity.

In sisterhood,

Ramona

for the Oahu Women's Coffeehouse Col-
lective (July 1983) (Hilarie Cash,
Ramona Hussey, Joan Lilychild, Linda
Lunsford, Jay Mays)

All She Wrote is a feminist paper. By
this we mean the paper will:

1) Be supportive of all women,
2) Reach out to all women,

3) Provide a forum for input,
4) Be a growing process.

ALL SHE WROTE is published by the Uni-
versity YWCA Women's Center staff and

The One Imperative

To thrust our collective power toward the
elimination of racism wherever
it exists and by any means necessary.

OOPS! The oral her-story ended last is-
sue and does not continue this issue.
OOPS! Our cover story last issue incor-
rectly reported that PAT KEKAWA attend—

ed Leeward Community College. It should
have been Honolulu Community College.
Also, Pat's name was misspelled. SORRY!

Dear Editor:
WHERE WOULD WE BE WITHOUT OUR SPONSORS

In June 1983, a contingency of the
Board of Directors of the Honolulu
YWCA flew to Hilo to attend the First
Annual Hawaii State Wide Conference of
the YWCA. It was a very significant
event and if it were not for the gener-
ous sponsorship by women in the commu-
nity who are appreciative of the im-
portant volunteer work done by grass
root women, one of the members of that
contingency could not have attended the
Statewide Conference and would have
been denied a rich and valuable learn-
ing and participating experience con-
nected with her community work and the
YWCA.

I am that member and am now writing
this article in deepest appreciation
of all the women who sponsored the
trip and confirmed again that feminism
is alive and well in Honolulu. With-
out their financial aid and moral sup-
port a very important information
gathering and exchange effort could
not have happened. I am now expres-
sing my sincerest gratitude to those
very fine women who are committed to
sisterhood and am listing their names.
Bernadette Boyce, Dory Spondike, Jane
Warner, Jane Power, Donna Obermiller,
Cynthia Ling, Jane Sinnot.

Once again, thank you.
