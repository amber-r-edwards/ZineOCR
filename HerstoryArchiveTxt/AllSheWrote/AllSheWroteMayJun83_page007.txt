ORAL HER-STORY  
THE OLDEN DAYS: PART ONE™

The fourth of five children,  

Adeline Miguel Naniole was born in  
Nuuanu on June 17, 1913. Adeline,  
daughter of a Hawaiian mother and  

Hawaiian-Portuguese father, speaks  
both Hawaiian and English.  

From the age of nine, Adeline  
helped her mother sell leis to dis-  
embarking passengers at the ship docks.  
Adeline was thirteen when she went to  
work at a pineapple cannery in town.  
After the birth of her daughter in  
1933, Adeline returned to the cannery  
in order to support and educate her  
child.  

Prior to and during World War II,  
Adeline became a maid at various  
houses of prostitution in the down-  
town red-light district; after the war,  
she returned to the cannery.  

Adeline was interviewed at her Papa-  
kolea home in March 1979 for a project  
on women workers in Hawaii's pineapple  
industry by Vivien Lee, then a re-  
searcher/interviewer with the Ethnic  
Studies Oral History Project, UH-Manoa.  
At Adeline's home, Vivien was im-  
pressed by the yardful of flowers and  
the view overlooking Honolulu. Inside  
were displayed many photographs of Ad-  
eline's grandchildren. Vivien remem-  
bers Adeline as being especially  
friendly and talkative.  

Adeline's interview was marked by  
her willingness to discuss even her  
most difficult experiences. The  
following narrative (in several  
parts) is condensed from the interview,  
and reflects Adeline's lifetime of  
work and unwavering commitments to  
family and union.  

My boy, he don't have much re-  
membrance.  

My big girl say, "Ma, shee, I  
don't know how you could remember  
all these things."  

I told them, "I wish I get brain  
like you folks. I would write  
about the olden days."  

We were old-time lei sellers, me  
and my mother. We get up four o'clock  
in the morning and walk up the Old  
Pali Road into the water reservation.  
By the time we reach up there, just  
right, the sun coming up and we go  
right in the ginger patch and pick all  
the buds. Then we get out with the  
gingers before the rangers come in.  

After we rest, then we sew leis.  

We pinch the stems short, put the buds  
in water. When they blossom, we start  
sewing the leis. Those days, you can  
go up the mountain get maile leaves,  
but it's so far. So we pick mahogany  
leaves—what they call haole maile—  
from the trees on Kalakaua Avenue,  
bring them home, tie them, and put  
them around the ginger.  

Then we go to the pier near Nimitz  
and Kekaulike Street to sell leis to  
the boat passengers. In the 1920s,  
lei sellers were from Makiki, Manoa,  
Nuuanu and Kalihi. Our days we only  
had about twenty, thirty people,  
that's all. Maybe four or five  
o'clock in the afternoon, I meet my  
mother after school at the pier. Even  
on Saturdays, and sometimes Sundays

and holidays, we have a little basket  
with all the flowers inside, and we go  
on the streetcar together. See,  
those days, all these ships used to  
come in every day.  

I helped my mother sell leis from  
when I was nine years old, all the way  
down till she died. You see, our fami-

ly lived on selling leis, that's about  
all we lived on. We had six children,  
and my father, who was a stevedore,  
didn't go to work all the time. We  
were so poor that we had to work hard.  

In 1927, summertime, I went to work at  
Libby's pineapple cannery. You know,  
those days, hard to get in for cannery  
unless they know you. My friend's sis-  
ter was a forelady there, that's how I  
got in. And they don't check up your  
age as long as you tell ‘em you six-  
teen—I was only thirteen, but I was  
so big.  

They took me to the jam table. You  
know when you buy pineapple in the can  

MAY/JUNE  

today, you see the mashy up kine?  
That's jam. When the jam comes down  
the table on a belt, I gotta pick up  
the brown spots and eyes from the jam  
and throw that rubbish down a little  
funnel. I cannot sit down and work;  
I have to stand up. It's really a  
hard job, but, oh, can't help.  

Those days, night shift, you work  
from seven o'clock at night to six  
o'clock in the morning. And, just to  
think—we used to work eleven cents  
one hour. When I tell my kids that,  
they laugh. But we needed the money.  
Every penny I get, I take it home and  
give it to my parents. I never even  
open the pay envelope. It went to my  
mother to buy us food.  

Then my mother took sick and passed  
away in 1930. I was a ninth-grader at  
Kawananakoa. That year, I left school.  
I liked to go more schooling, but there  
was no money even to pay for books.  

Then I went back to work at Libby's  
in 1933 during the summertime because  
I had to get some money. You see, my  
daughter was born that year. I  
couldn't live on my boyfriend's check  
for my girl. And I wanted to educate  
her.  

This time, they took the old-timers  
like me from the jam table to go on  
the packing table. But I didn't know  
how to pack pineapple. I don't know  
what's number one grade and what's num-  
ber two grade. To me, the pineapple  
all look the same. So, I went to the  
end of the table and packed all the  
broken pineapple pieces. The broken  
pieces packing was the easiest, no  
need to worry about grades.  

After four summers at Libby's, I  
didn't go back again. My aunt was a  
cook at the Rex Room—a prostitute  
house. Just happened they need a maid,  
so my aunt asked me if I want to go to  
work. That's how I went in 1936.  

Rex Room used to be at the corner  
of Pauahi and Smith Streets, right  
next to Wing Coffee Company. After-  
wards, when Wing Coffee moved across  
Pauahi Street, Rex Room took over the  
whole place. The ten girls used to  
sleep downstairs and business was up-  
stairs.  

The maids gotta answer the door.  

We had two maids' doors because they  
have the local and white. See, the  
local customers come through the back  
door and the white customers come  
through the front. I take care of the  
local door, but when the other maid  
was sick, I had to take care of the  
front.  

If the customer drunk, I shut the  
door. I won't let them come in. And  
my friend, when the white men come in  
all drunk, she went and said, "I'm  
sorry."  

He say, "Why not?"  

She says, "Well, I don't think you  
can make business." (Laughs)  

But the maids don't handle any mon-  
ey. Just watch, put the men in, see  
they don't get nasty to the girls.  
They supposed to be in the room for  
only ten minutes and if over that, we  
have to knock at the door, make sure  
the girl is okay.
