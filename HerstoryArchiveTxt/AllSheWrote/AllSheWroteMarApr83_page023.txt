relationship. He was incapable of commu-
nicating with me as a person.

The result of all this is that I
have been thoroughly converted to medi-
cal activism. And, until someone
proves me wrong, I will continue to ad-
vocate aggressive medical participa-
tion by all medical consumers in their
own health maintenance and treatment.
From worshipfully following physician
orders to openly challenging them rou-
tinely, I have come full circle. From
religiously performing the self exams
I've been told were necessary to as-
sure early intervention in any future
recurrence, I now believe that early
intervention may, in fact, shorten
my life. Statistics are accumulating
to support this medical heresy, includ-
ing those quoted in The New England
Journal of Medicine (Jan. 1980) and
the March 15, 1981 issue of Lancet,
both reporting on breast cancer stu-
dies that seem to show that despite the
mushrooming of new techniques for
treatment, there is no compelling evi-
dence that one is better than any
other or that ANY is significantly
better than none at all!

My personal belief is that Ameri-
cans will not receive effective high-
quality medical care, regardless of
technological advances, breakthroughs
in the drug industry, or improved
health care access for all, regardless
of socio-economic status, until the
superstars of the medical firmament
learn to deal with the whole human...
not just the human artifact revealed
by the “hole in the sheet."
