IMPRESSIONS OF THE 4th ANNUAL  
NATIONAL WOMEN'S STUDIES  
ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE  

Joyce Chinen  

This was my first experience at a  
National Women's Studies Association  
Conference, so I had very little with  
which to compare it. What follows,  
then, are merely impressions garnered  
on the basis of workshops in which I  
was a presenter and those I merely  
attended, people with whom I inter-  
acted, and miscellaneous bits of ob-  
servation. Alice Chai also attended,  
and her accounts come from a more ex-  
perienced eye.  

I was a presenter in two separate  
workshops. In one workshop I presen-  
ted a slideshow "An Invisible Her-  
story: Hawaii's Working Women” and  
talked about how it was put to-  
gether and how it was used. My other  
presentation was as a panelist, pre-  
senting a paper relating to the topic  
of Women and Work. The slideshow  

workshop was very small, with only  
about five women attending, yet it  
was a very gratifying experience be-  
cause it became a real workshop with  
lots of exchange. The participants  

were mainly non-academics, many of  
them from rural areas, working with  

rural women, all interested in cre-  
ating their own resources for use  
within their own communities. It  
truly became a session of sharing - -  
ideas, techniques, modes of dispersion.  
By contrast, the session on Women and  

Work was mostly academic and formal.  
There was very little sharing and  
interchange, and the formal distinc-  
tion between Presenter and Audience  

I attended, as a member of the  
Audience, a number of other workshops,  
some academic, others more informal.  
One of the best academic sessions was  
entitled "New Sociology for Women" by  
sociologist Dorothy Smith, a regular  
contributor to Feminist publications.  
Recent work in "institutional ethnog-  
raphy" is pointing out a way of look-  
ing at the interflow of participants'  
energies between groups and institu-  
tionally structured settings. From  
her own research, Professor Smith is  
demonstrating the contributions that  
middle class mothers make to the  
success of their children in educa-  
tional institutions governed by middle  
class mores and criteria of success.  
This expenditure of energy is "work"  
and it is only now being recognized as  
such. It also points out how the  
children of working class mothers are  
systematically deprived of those en-  
ergies because family income pres-  
sures often mean mothers must work for  
pay, and therefore are disadvantaged  
relative to their middle class coun-  
terparts.  

Another excellent session was spon-  
sored by the Third World Caucus, en-  
titled “Working-Class Women in Academ-  
ia." The panel was very eclectic,  
bringing together poets as well as  
professors. Most of the presenta-  
tions tended to be testimonial in  
nature, and a lot of women were  
touched by them. For myself, Johnetta  
Richards’ presentation was “ideal."  
She combined a historical accounting  
of the legal cases and precedents of  
Blacks in higher education with only  
a few of her own experiences as the  
only Black female on the faculty at  
Trinity College. It made for a qual-  
ity of presentation to which I am most  

attracted, wherein the personal is al-  
ways placed in the context of the lar-  
ger historical forces, that which  
Mills called the "sociological imagin-  
ation."  

There were numerous other sessions,  
competing and tantalizing us. In  
fact, one of the most frequent com-  
plaints was of the difficulty of mak-  
ing choices among the selections.  
Overall, it was delightful to be in  
the midst of an event with so many  
women present. Not since the Women  
and Global Corporate Power Conference  
have I been to such a large gathering  
where nearly all the participants were  
women. In such a context, the impor-  
tance of women's issues can be assumed  
instead of argued, freeing our ener-  
gies for more specific work -- at  
least that is the potential. But I  
learned that even at this retreat,  
among the beautiful redwoods encased  
in coastal fog, that the structures  
of the external world were carried in  
with us. This was noticeable in two  
ways: first, although more than a  
thousand women attended, only about  
fifty were non-white; and second, the  
distinctions between higher and lower  
status (and income) women were per-  
petuated in terms of lodging and  
meals, and in terms of the distance  
between the presenter elites and  
attender masses. I'm not sure what  
can be done to rectify these problems,  
but certainly greater sensitivity  
should be given to these patterns by  
future conference planners. In any  
case, my general enthusiasm for the  
Organization and its work continues,  
and I look forward to the 5th annual  
NWSA conference in Columbus, Ohio in  
1983.  

THE NEEDINESS YOU HAD  

FOR A SOLITUDE BEYOND HARP SHELL  
FOR AN ANSWER TO LIFE'S TIMBERS  
THROUGH BARE WOOD  

YOU ANSWERED ME MORE THAN YOU QUESTIONED  

WITH THE RAW ABILITY TO EXTRUDE  
SOMETHING KINDLY AND ABLE  

FROM AMBIVALENCE ...  

HOW YOUR PENCIL GREW AWKWARD  
WHEN IT CAME TO  

PUTTING PEOPLE AS SENSORY IMAGE  
ONTO THE SKETCH PAD  

IT WAS AN ATTEMPT YOU SAW AS FAILURE  

IT WAS THE OLDEST OF  

HOUSES, SHEDS, LEAN-TOS  

FROM WHICH YOU EXTRACTED  
CHARACTERS AND FRIENDS  

EACH WINDOW, A LESS THAN PERFECT EYE  
EACH DOOR, A SEASONED MOUTH  

WITH TEETH MISSING  

EACH PORCH, A LAP  

WITH ONE OR TWO BOARDS LOOSE  

UPON WHICH A PENDULOUS ROCKING CHAIR,  

INDICATED MOOD SWINGS  

AROUND THESE OBSOLESCENT STRUCTURES  

YOU CAUGHT  
THE WILD, UNKEPT, MORE THAN PERFECT  

LEAVES AND STEMS, AND TRUNKS AND VINES  

OF TREES AND PLANTS AND FLOWERS  

IN PASTELS AS THOUGH  

YOU HAD BLOWN THE COLORS ON PAPER  
WITH THE LIGHTEST OF BREATHS  
LEAVING SPACES HERE AND THERE  

SO AS NOT TO SCARE AWAY THE ESSENCE.  

A REFLECTION ON THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S  
STUDIES ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE  
Arcata, California, June, 1982  

By: Alice Yun Chai  

The Fourth National Women's  
Studies Association Conference was  
held on June 14-20 at Humboldt State  
University, Arcata, California, which  
is located in the redwood wine country  
about 300 miles north of San Francis-  
co. The theme of the conference was  
FEMINIST CONNECTIONS THROUGH EDUCA-  
TION. In the following, I will sum-  
marize and give some of my reactions  
to the conference, primarily focusing  
on the plenary sessions (Opening,  
Angela Davis, and the Closing) and  
some of the political meetings I  
attended, such as the Third World  
Caucus and the Speakout sessions.  

At the Opening Plenary Session  
(FEMINIST SCHOLARSHIP AND FEMINIST  
CONNECTIONS), in assessing the past  
accomplishments, the present status  
of Women's Studies as a systematic  
movement, and in looking into the  
future, one of the “mothers of Women's  
Studies," Catherine Stimpson remarked  
that Women's Studies not only altered  
our individual lives and created new  
symbols, models, and institutions,  
but also had a great impact and posi-  
tive effect on every aspect of colle-  
giate life in America and was now be-  
coming an international movement. Two  
other speakers, Vina Mazumdar from  
India and Dorothy Smith from Canada,  
emphasized what Women's Studies and  
the Women's Movement had failed to do:  
they had failed to attain equal parti-  
cipation by the majority of women  

and working-class women.  

Dorothy Smith pointed out that many  
women in our societies had not only  
been further silenced by not being  
present at this conference (only 30-50  
out of about 800-1,000 participants  

were women of color), and that their  
voices had not been heard in social/  
political expressions of the Women's  
Movement and Women's Studies. She said it  
was not a matter of guilt or a moral  
issue, but rather a question of sys-  
tem, organization, power, and class in  
the Women's Movement, educational sys-  
tem, and in the larger society.  

Vina Mazumdar from India admitted  
that elite professional women in  
India had the arrogance of culture  
and birth and did not have their  
political consciousness raised about  
the Indian women's deteriorating con-  
dition until they were asked to study  
the situation of the masses of women  
by the government. She and other  
social scientists who had been en-  
gaged in the study were not only an-  
gry but were deeply ashamed of the  
fact that just because they did not  
share most of the problems which the  
masses of Indian women had, they did  
not think problems existed for the  
majority of Indian women, such as  
rural and urban poor women.  

Angela Davis also stated in her  
speech, WOMEN, RACE AND CLASS: AN  
ACTIVIST PERSPECTIVE, that the over-  
all social/political consciousness  
and voices of the masses of women  
had been further silenced by the  
Women's Movement and Women's Studies  
because they either ignored, dis-  
torted, or mystified experiences of  
women of color and working-class  
women. In order to establish the  

most effective Women's Studies and
