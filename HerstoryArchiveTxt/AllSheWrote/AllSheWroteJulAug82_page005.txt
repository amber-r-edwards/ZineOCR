MABEL

by Rina Winslow

No one with any common sense should profess to know Mabel, not even those whom consider her their kin; not even those whom Mabel considers friends.

Mabel has few friends. She says friends are just people who know you when the world and its circumstances are on the upward spiral. When life is not on that track, friends disappear. Mabel's world has seemed to be continuously on the downward spiral with intermittent periods of a couple of months, at best, when there is a leveling off; when re-energizing of that spiral is relegated to whatever forces sit at the controls of Mabel's life.

Only a fool would fault Mabel and her pessimism. She has been optimistic at different times in her life - during the leveling off periods - but those periods have been few. "After all," she says, "I'm already twenty-eight years old and look what I got to show for over a quarter-of-a-century's living." What she has to show, starting with her hands, are a series of blue tattoos depicting her life as a law-breaker. There is very little else Mabel can talk about except her life of crime. Talk about the excitement of planning an escape from reformatories or prisons where she has spent fifteen precious years of her life; talk about a story freshly read and that will be similar to one or a dozen she has memorized during her years of confinement; talk about clothes or hairstyles and they will be paralleled with those “inside.” Inside is comforting to Mabel, she will admit, but not too quickly for fear of having frowns directed at that admission. She wants to be honest about her feelings, her remarks, but she has long learned to weigh whatever she says to "straights" because they do not have to abide by any code as those on the inside do most of the time.

"Yeah, I got some real good lessons for about five months when I was in the Women's Prison in California," Mabel professes. "I always liked to fool around with cameras, you see. And for five months a couple of years ago some of us got to go to classes an hour a day. And them classes was about how to work with cameras and processing chemicals.

"So I got real interested in the damn thing. And we was graded by the teacher. I made real good grades except in the processing stuff. I couldn't hack that ‘cause of this allergy I got from the fumes. But that was okay ‘cause I learned the other stuff so damn good the warden let me take pictures when we had the functions on holidays." Only when she talks about cameras does Mabel blossom into the sparkling person hidden under the other facade. She is knowledgeable to the point of brilliant to one who knows about the focusing and pressing of the red button on a Polaroid.

A true story

Mabel is preparing to return to California very shortly. Cameras are all she knows. She loves them as dearly as she can love anyone. Two months ago, during her leveling off period, she saw a Nikon sitting next to a Canon in the shop window. Several 50, 100, and 150 mm lenses rested next to the cameras peeking out of their leather bags. All told either would have cost over a thousand dollars, about nine hundred and ninety-two dollars more than Mabel had to her savings stashed in her pocket. The cameras sat there, teasing her, daring her to take one of them with her. She had use only for one, and the lenses needed for distance. She only wanted to start earning a living, she says. "Two hundred ninety-seven dollars is all the damn welfare gives me with a bunch of food stamps. What can you do with two hundred and ninety-seven damn dollars nowadays?” In her heart what she did to start a better life is justified. She has known no other way. She is again bitter over the downward spiraling, but says she understands it. This time she was out longer than any other time since she was eleven years of age. "That shows that things got to start looking up when I get out about the middle of 1980." A note of optimism?

"You know," she confides hesitatingly, "I got Sarah back there. She says for me to keep my nose clean, but I know she’s going to be there again. Sarah's the only person who ever gave a damn about me. Yeah. She's my chick," she says turning away from the gaze, hoping the relationship has not been diminished by the admission; hoping the outsider will not condemn and devaluate her. Throughout the conversation her eyes have exposed her own self-estimation, except when she spoke of the cameras. There is no further need for evaluation.

The next time she returns, Mabel says coyly, not believing the words emitted but needing to say them in order to be more acceptable to the listener or to hold on, perhaps, to a part of a dream once vibrant and reachable, she will be able to have better control of the circumstances surrounding her life. Her mind refuses to question the contradicting statement. She has enough to live with and no one near her will bring attention to the contradictions.

Sure, she will take care of herself, she says. Yeah. She knows it was a pleasure talking to her, she bets. Great. She will see you around some time too. Yeah. It would be nice to hear from you if you got the time, "but don't go sweating it ‘cause I understand if you can't really find the time.” She truly understands. She knows there may always be a chasm between the world she has learned to accept and the other world she may never be able to make her own. She understands. She wishes it were not so as she is left there at the steps, but she understands.
