ALL SHE WROTE

I met Benedita recently  
on a trip to Europe. Benedita  
is the director of the  
Brazilian Cultural Center in  
Rome, Italy. The center  
offers courses in Portuguese,  
Brazilian Culture, Literature,  
Dance, Cooking, Brazilian  
Spiritualism, and Music to  
over 300 students.

Benedita wrote the  
article below in response to  
an invitation to contribute to  
an Italian feminist magazine,  
where it was printed a few  
months ago. She gave me the  
original Portuguese version,  
which I translated below.

In Brazil, a country of  
continental proportions and  
with an economically and  
culturally multifaceted  
society, it is almost  
impossible to characterize the  
Brazilian woman. In truth,

one can say that the Brazilian  
woman is as diverse as  
each one can have her  
own behavioral typology.

To approximate themselves  
to their European and North  
American counterparts, the  
majority of the people who  
deal with the subject prefer  
to elect as the prototype of  
the Brazilian woman, that  
woman who belongs to the  
middle class, is married, has  
few children, owns a home, a  
car and a maid. However, at  
the beginning of the urban  
movement for women's rights,  
it created a certain surprise,  
and even a certain irritation  
to know that the majority of  
the activists did not apply in  
their own homes, to their  
female domestic help, all  
those ideas for which they  
argued in conventions and  
demonstrations. At that time  
the domestic help did not  
enjoy any kind of workman's  
rights, or a contract, or any  
medical or social help. And  
even now, although there exist  
legal requirements for a  
workers’ contract and  
participation in social  
security for the domestic  
help, there are still

thousands of maids, who accept  
work without any of these  
guarantees,

under the threat

of losing their jobs and  
having no other way to  
contribute to the meager  
support of their own family,  
which most of the time is not  
as small as that of their  
mistress employer.

Evidently, and very  
fortunately, it was from this  
very same middle class that  
those women evolved who were  
prepared and truly interested,  
and who undeniably contributed  
to the conquest of the many  
rights, until then denied to  
the female sex.

But Brazil is large and  
the women many. And about the  
other great female heroines  
little has been spoken.  
Because nobody knows them,  
they are anonymous, without  
face, illiterate or semi-  
illiterate. They do not know  
how to impose their rights  
with words; they do not have  
time to participate in  
demonstrations, they cannot  
give themselves the luxury to  
cross their arms in strikes  
and wait for better days.

She, in the majority of cases,  
is not even honored in her  

She recognizes her  
duties. She thinks about her  
children, who are many, who  
are far away, in the "favela"  
(slum), miserable and distant,  
two or three hours from her  
workplace, and who wait for  
the meager results of her  
work in the homes of the more  
fortunate. Her great battle is  
for survival, her immediate  
preoccupation is for daily  
bread.

Or, we could still talk  
about the other woman, always  
at home, who besides the weary  
housework, thinking about her  
husband and children, still  
finds time for another odd  
job which will help the family  
budget, because life is  
expensive, inflation is  
extremely high and the husband  
earns minimum wage. And what  
to say about the Northeastern  
woman, suffering with the  
drought which may last for as  
long as five years, to later  
suffer with the floods which  
only last for a short time,  
but are intense and thus  
destroy the remainder of what  
was possible to obtain with  
the meager drought production.  
Because there in the Northeast  
nobody thinks that this should  
be done by man, and that by  

woman, or this the man does  
and therefore the woman should  
too, or other thoughts along  
these lines. Everybody does  
everything that is possible,  
otherwise famine will meet  
them on the way, and famine is  
neither machista nor feminist,  
it is just famine.

There are so many women,  
so much fight, so much work,  
that enumerating them would  
be long and monotonous. And  
they are the great feminist  
heroines of all times; in our  
society so similar yet so  
diverse, where there exists a  
São Paulo, which looks like a  
New York in size and technical  
and cultural progress, but  
also there is the Northeast,  
with the air of another  
Ethiopia.

Would it be demagogical  
to say that I believe these  
poor anonymous women to be the  
great heroines? Could be, but  
it is these women with whom I  
identify. Frequently I am  
asked about the relationship  
between my work and the fact  
that I belong to the female  
sex. This difficulty arises  
from the fact that I never  
thought that my battle to  
occupy a place in the sun, to  
have a respectable means of  
survival, summarizes itself in  
a fight of man versus woman.  
My battle for survival was so  
intense and painful that there  
was no time to see myself in  
the mirror of the feminists  
because, naive or not, I  
firmly believed that  
competency was more important  
than sex, race, color or  
religion.

One could argue that my  
convictions only triumphed  
because somewhere else other  
women fought for the  
acquisition of those rights,  
from which I now benefit, and  
I believe that this might be  
true. And in world history  
there are many examples that  
this is always happening.

But still I want to  
believe that in the  
confrontation man-woman,  
white-negro (which I felt much  
more strongly and where the  
fight was harder and more  
painful) the most important  
issue is to believe in your  
own power and in the power of  
your ideals.
