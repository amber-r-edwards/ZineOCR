NARAL of Hawaii  

NATIONAL ABORTION RIGHTS ACTION LEAGUE  

In its September 1982 meeting, the  
Board of NARAL of Hawaii decided to  
disband this state's chapter. We came  
to this decision after many months of  
searching for a new President. We were  
unable to find anyone willing to take  
over the job. But, more importantly,  
it is the opinion of the Board that,  
within the small community of Hawaii,  
individuals who are socio-political  
activists have placed other vital  
concerns as their first priorities. The  
pro-choice stand, while of great signi-  
ficance for all of us, is not facing  
the extreme opposition here that it is  
meeting on the Mainland. We feel cer-  
tain that, should there be a real  
threat to our rights in Hawaii, citi-  
zens would come forward to defend a  
woman's freedom of choice. We also be-  
lieve that the crucial battles are be-  
ing fought in Washington, D.C. and in  
several key states on the Mainland.  

The donations remaining in our treasu-  
ry will revert to NARAL headquarters  
to help with the ongoing struggle to  
uphold freedom of choice throughout  
the nation.  

We urge all of you to continue as  
members of national NARAL. Your mem-  
bership and contributions are urgent-  
ly needed by them. I hardly need to  
remind you that changes in the U.S.  
Constitution would affect Hawaii. Let  
us all pledge to keep up the good work

commend those who, for many years,  
kept NARAL of Hawaii functioning, par-  
ticularly Jeanne Fertel, whose hard  
work is most deserving of our thanks.  
To all the members of NARAL of Hawaii,  
Thank you and Aloha.

Although we have decided that there  
is not an urgent need for a local chap-  
ter of NARAL, we encourage all of you  
to transfer your energy and donations  
to other agencies sympathetic to our  
cause. The following list of organiza-  
tions is suggested because the basis  
for their existence is either citi-  
zens' rights, women's rights, medi-  
cal/health services, or a combination  
thereof.

candlelight vigil on battered women at  

Ala Moana Beach. Only 15 people  
showed up—10 of them being children.  

Ladies Against Women  

Dear Ladies,  

Now is your chance to do the proper,  
lady-like thing; take off those dis-  
gusting blue jeans, t-shirts (I shiver  
at the thought of that word) and flat  
shoes and join Ladies Against Women.  
Let us not stop at the defeat of the  
ERA (the Equal Rights Amendment, I  
believe it stands for) and continue on  
to abolishing legalized abortions and  

the 19th amendment giving ladies their  

unwanted right to vote. Help keep la-  
dies in their desired places. It is  
suffering, not suffrage that keeps us  
on pedestals. If God had not meant  
for us to be on pedestals, He would  
not have made us shorter than our  
husbands.  

We hope to be holding monthly con-  
sciousness-lowering sessions the third  
Tuesday of every month and all ladies  
are welcome. An open mind is the dev-  
il's workshop.  

Remember, the world is only big  
enough for one opinion!  

Sincerely,  
Beverly Shaft-Mee
