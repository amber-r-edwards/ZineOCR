A SHORT ESSAY
ON: TRUTH

During the past four years
Honolulu's N.O.W. has made some
progress and has helped several
pre-feminists develop into great
women. What disturbs me is the
fact that our local N.O.W. seems
to have its own definition of
"truth," and one which disagrees
with National N.O.W. Be not
mistaken, I am an avowed suppor-
ter of N.O.W. and my purpose is
not only to criticize. I would
like to bring up a little her-
story and to encourage a more
truthful attitude within our
local chapter.

Our president during 1977 was
also the Chair of the Lesbian
Task Force (LTF) for its first
few months. I owe so very much
to her and other members of the
LTF. They showed me by example
just what a feminist was, and in
particular a Lesbian feminist.
All were openly Lesbian and I
learned a great deal from them
about being truthful, proud and
sure of myself. Unfortunately,
such a support system no longer
exists within Honolulu's N.O.W.

N.O.W.'s president for 1978
and 1979 was, in my opinion,
very cool toward the members of
the LTF. The task force core
numbered about ten, with an-
other five to ten who were new
to N.O.W. and not yet politi-
cized. The primary complaint
of the president was our
supposed lack of purpose and

we wanted to be together pri-
marily for social reasons and
also that not enough of us
were active members. At a
small meeting consisting only
of those who really cared, the
LTF was disbanded in April,
1979. I struck a deal with
N.O.W. that in place of the
LTF there would be a minimum
of one meeting each year which
would be devoted specifically
to Lesbian concerns. This
bargain has not been kept, with
only the October, 1980 meeting
being about Lesbian women.

Our president in 1980 was ex-
tremely supportive of gay women,
however she saw no need for a
Lesbian Task Force. Also, there
would have been no Lesbian-con-
cerned meeting during 1980 if I
hadn't insisted on one and put
it together (along with Jacqui
and Jo). One main reason for
N.O.W.'s anti-LTF stance was the
fact that Lesbians were not ac-
tive members anymore; if there
were any gay women at the meet-
ings, very few people realized
it due to silence.

N.O.W.'s president for 1981
didn't agree with me about the
need for a task force, and I
spoke with the new co-presidents
briefly at the August meeting
about organizing a panel of gay
women for a meeting. Nothing
ever happened and I'm not even
sure the idea was put before the
board. Honolulu's Lesbian
community could produce a panel
that would cover all areas of
our lifestyle, offer valuable

networking contacts, and would
provide much-needed role models
for young Lesbians and those
beginning to come out. National
N.O.W. policy supports such a
panel meeting--but does Honolulu
N.O.W? After four years of less
and less visibility, I'm really
wondering.

Our president for 1982 has
done a good job with the N.O.W.
Newsletter except in one area.
At the November, 1981 meeting I
asked her to include more news
about the Lesbian/Gay Male
community and she stated that
she feels "it is too radical."
She said she would put out one
issue soon dealing with Lesbians.
This decision offends me greatly.
I do not want myself and my gay
sisters segregated neatly into
one newsletter. Does the nation-
al N.O.W. newspaper do that? No.
Nor does "Networking Newsletter,"
"All She Wrote," or
other local papers put out by
the A.C.L.U., Council of
Churches, Sexual Identity Cen-
ter, A.A.U.W., etc. There is
nothing radical about it any-
more--it is reality!

TRUTH: Lesbians and gay
men are around all of the time
and everywhere. We comprise
from 10-20% of N.O.W.'s member-
ship and boards. Some of us
(though fewer each month) are at
every meeting, and many of us
read every newsletter and feel
totally ignored. We are never
ignored by the national N.O.W.
newspaper--why have we been
methodically eliminated by
Honolulu's N.O.W? And why

N.O.W. is not serving our needs
anymore and that's one reason we
don't attend meetings. Many of
us have given up on N.O.W.

TRUTH: Several past office-
holders in N.O.W. have been
Lesbians and all have done much
to further feminist ideology,
but, almost no one knows they
are gay women. I call this ly-
ing by omission. Each time we
allow someone to assume we are
heterosexual, we give ourselves
a psychological message that we
are unfit and we further rein-
force society's claim that
Lesbians/Gays are somehow in-
ferior. In my opinion, a
closeted Lesbian is not a fem-
inist because she is ashamed of
herself and her sisters and
brothers who happen to be
members of sexual minorities
(including homosexuals, bi-
sexuals, transsexuals, etc.).
She speaks with a forked tongue:
one side says "Lesbians are
fine" and the other side says
"but the closet is where we
belong."

TRUTH: I care very much
about N.O.W. and don't want to
do anything to hurt its stand-
ing in the community, but I
care much more about my sisters
and feel that N.O.W. is cheat-
ing them. They pay their dues,
probably primarily because of
the ERA push, and thousands of
Lesbians are working only on
that project. (Perhaps they
are forgetting about themselves
and the Lesbian movement--will

the ERA help you when your boss
is gay?) I want to see another Lesbian Task
Force and also some mention of
our existence in each and every
newsletter and at every meet-
ing! Lesbian rights is supposed
to be a priority for N.O.W.,
and part of their job is to do
consciousness-raising and to
educate, but locally they have
let us down. In the future, I
would also love to see open
board members. It doesn't

help Lesbians to have other
Lesbians in high places when
they are filled with fear, and
when they practice self-cen-
sorship so as not to offend the
establishment. I won't for-
sake N.O.W., and I will do my
thing: to create Lesbian visi-
bility. I ask that truth be
put back into feminism!

SELF - IMPOSED PRISON
OR MENTAL MASOCHISM

Prison is not only a jail reser-
ved for convicts. Prison is “a

(Webster's New World Dictionary,
Second College Edition). I'd like
to expand the word 'place’ to
include situations, relationships,
and attitudes. In this inquiry,

I am going to explore various forms
of self-imposed prisons, raise some
possibilities about the prisoners,
and offer some further reading.

The following statements are forms
and feelings of these voluntary
prisons:

"My parents don't understand me.
They don't even try to. I'd leave
home, but where would I go?"

"This University isn't teaching
me enough, I'd transfer, but I
can't afford it."

"I'm bored out of my wits with
the drudgery of housework. My spo-
use is a drag. I'd leave, but I
have no skills (or) I have children."

"My husband beats me, but he
doesn't mean to...he's got a lot
of pressures. It's probably my
fault anyway."

"I'm probably not good enough
for that promotion. If I make waves
I might get fired."

"I'd quit smoking (drinking,
biting nails, taking drugs, etc.)
but I really do enjoy it...really."

"I'd come out of the closet, but
I'd lose my job (friends, family
approval, lover, spouse, clients,
clout, etc., etc.)."

"I hate it here and I want to
move, but I'd be leaving so much
behind."

Those are the prisons. The sent-
ences are determined by the pri-
soners. Sound like anyone you know?
Yourself? Wait a minute...I'm not
trying to come off like I'm per-
fect or that I know all the ans-
