ORAL HER-STORY  
THE OLDEN DAYS: PART TWO  

The fourth of five children,  
Adeline Miguel Naniole was born in  
Nuuanu on June 17, 1913. Adeline,  
daughter of a Hawaiian mother and  
Hawaiian-Portuguese father, speaks  
both Hawaiian and English.  

Adeline married Robert Naniole,  

a longshoreman. The hardships they  
endured because of his unstable occu-  
pation led to their involvement during  
the late 1930s in the fledgling Honolu-  
lu Longshoremen's Association, which  
became the ILWU (International Long-  
shoremen's and Warehousemen's Union).  
A turning point was the 177-day long-  
shore strike of 1949. The subsequent  
strike settlement enabled longshoremen  
to get steady work. Although her hus-  
band's income became secure, Adeline  
continued to work. She remembers,  
"Well, I told him since I been working  
so long, I don't want to stay home."  

Adeline was interviewed twice at  
her Papakolea home in March 1979 for a  
project on women workers in Hawaii's  
Pineapple industry by Vivien Lee, then  
a researcher/interviewer with the Eth-  
nic Studies Oral History Project, UH-  
Manoa. At Adeline's home, Vivien was  
impressed by the yardful of flowers  
and the view overlooking Honolulu.  
On the side were displayed many photographs  
of Adeline's grandchildren. Vivien re-  
members Adeline as being especially  
friendly and talkative.  

Adeline’s interview was marked by  
her willingness to discuss even her  
most difficult experiences. The follow-  
ing narrative (serialized in two parts)  
is condensed from the interview, and  
reflects Adeline's lifetime of work  
and unwavering commitments to family  
and union.

In-  

After the war, I was living with my  
family in Chinatown on Maunakea Street  
in the back of Roosevelt Theater. I  
got married in 1941 to Robert Naniole.  
Before, my husband was a merchant ma-  
rine seaman. Afterwards, when he met  
me, he didn't want to go back on the  
boat, so he jumped off to work as a long-  
shoreman.  

In the late 1930s, the longshoremen  
were just forming up to be a union.  
That's when I first heard about it.  
The name still wasn't ILWU; just Hono-  
lulu Longshoremen (Honolulu Longshore-  
men's Association), that's all it was.

Those days, longshoremen, if you  
worked, you worked four hours, that's  
all. Sometimes, the foreman won't pick  
you to work. If you don't take the  
foreman go drinking--you know, treat-  
ing him--he don't hire you. He picks  
somebody else. Even no matter how ear-  
ly you go, he won't pick you up. What  
can you do? So they tried forming a  
union because the company was giving  
bad time to the longshoremen.  

You know, I'm for the union. Even  
I stand on a longshoreman picket line.  
Yeah, went down to the boats. And I'm  
so proud that this thing--building up  
the union--came right straight through.  
They got everything. Every week you  
work. You know what you're entitled to,  
everything. Because of the union, my  
husband had a steady job in 1949. Me,  
I'm glad.  

Then, well, I told him since I been  
working so long, I don't want to stay  
home even if he has a steady job. So, I  
was busy. I have to finish up the  
housework, get everything done, then  
go to work. It's always something to  
do, something to do.  

In the morning, I used to wash the  
laundry by hand in the bathtub. You  
know, the way they built the old apart-  
ments those days, it's too small for a  
washing machine. Every morning, I get  
all the clothes, soak them all up, and  
wash them. You ought to see, the Chi-  
nese people couldn't think how I could  
work that hard. Hanging these clothes--  
two, three lines. The line used to go  
from one block to another block. You  
see, apartment here, apartment there.  
We had to hang. It's a good thing in  
the back of the Roosevelt Theater, no-  
body could see.  

After laundry, I go shopping. I  
go to the market because the market  
is near. I just walk through the al-  
leys to get into Kekaulike Street Mar-  
ket. You know that American Theater?  
We used to go there for a show--fif-  
teen cents. Well, I go right through  
there to get into the market. And I  
don't know if you remember, but nearby,  

on Pauahi Street, used to have the  

best peanut factory. That's where all  
kinds, from the rich to the poor, buy  
peanuts. That thing went close up in  
the 1960s because the man died and the son  
didn't want to run the peanut.  

Then I go home and prepare supper.  
So when my family comes home, they just  
warm it up. Going to work, I can walk  
because I live in town. Only takes me  
ten minutes to walk to the CPC (Califor-  
nia Packing Corporation) pineapple can-  
nery.  

At CPC, I worked trimming. You  
hold the whole pineapple and trim the  
skin off with a knife. And the knife  
had to be sharp. Funny, sometimes it  
couldn't cut a pineapple, but yet it  
cuts your finger. And, you know, the  
pineapple is heavy. Sometimes, your mus-  
cles feel just like stiff. Some people  
say they cannot even work on the big  
pineapple, too heavy. They quit, they  
cannot take it. But the hardest part  
is when you first work for trimming.  
After you know, it's nothing hard at  
all.  

When I come home at night, I relax  
myself. I take a bath. I read the news-  
paper. The children are all sleeping. My  
husband, he goes to the poolroom. He's  
a good pool shooter. And the pool-  
room's right around the corner. You  
see, what a life, eh?  

I stayed at CPC for a long time, al-  
most twenty years, until my grand-  
children came into this world. In  
nineteen sixty-five, I left the cannery to  
take care of my grandchildren. Now  
they say they have more of these peo-  
ple from Vietnam working there. Fili-  
pinos, too. Poor things. Even though  
it's a hard job, they work because they need  
the money. In my day, I needed the money,  
that's why I stuck with it, too.  

But me, I think, by right, we  
should have gotten better pay those days.  
Because all these "Big Five"* down  
here were getting rich. You know, be-  
fore in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin,  
there was one whole society page, all  
about their daughters having tea.  
While they enjoyed all the luxury,  
the working people were working hard.  

But that was the olden days. Today,  
because of the union, there is better  
money, better seniority, and better  
things. You get those privileges.  
That's why I like the union. I don't  
care what anybody tells me because I  
went through all that.
