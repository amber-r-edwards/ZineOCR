ALL YOU WROTE

Letter to the Editor

On June 25th the Women's Health
Center & Clinic closed its doors to
the public. This closing repre-
sented, not as one might assume, a
loss of funding or lack of support by
state, federal and eleemosynary in-
stitutions, but, rather, a lack of
commitment by those women calling
themselves the Women's Health Center
Collective...the women who advertised
their closing in the July/August
issue of "All She Wrote.”

I was sad to see the official no-
tice of the clinic's failure on page
12 of your pages, even though it came
as no surprise. However, I was sad-
dened even more by the appearance and
tone of the paid advertisement. It
seemed to be celebrating its own
failure. As if failure to "make it"
in the real world of politics, publi-
city, paperwork and audits, adminis-
trative and fiscal accountability, is
somehow “honorable” or inherently
feminist. As though, to fail in the
eyes of the establishment community
preserves the philosophical “purity"
of an organization.

Well, let me tell you, sisters.

It just ain't so.

The State of Hawaii (through the
Office of Family Planning's adminis-
tration of Title X monies) and the
Family Foundations supported the
WHC&C in the amount of nearly $100,-
000. (I know as I was one of the
WHC members who worked to obtain

convincing the money people that
a volunteer group primarily concerned
with patient advocacy and participa-
tive health care for Hawaii's women,
a group that functioned from a tiny
office on the second floor of a local
church could manage and administer a
program designed to provide clinic
services to more than 1,000 women in
its first year.

But, they trusted us. They funded
the WHC in a year when most social
service programs were cut back or even
eliminated from federal and state
budgets. Unfortunately, the likely
result of the clinic closure will be
a further erosion of confidence be-
tween women's programs and established
funding institutions.

If we want to be taken seriously,
if we truly want equal treatment
under the law and if we ever expect
to gain the respect of the male es-
tablishment, we must change our atti-
tude toward success. That does not
mean we must become callous or in-
ured to human suffering. It does not
mean we must abandon our feminist,
humanist ideals. It does mean that
we must learn to co-exist with a
business community that is strug-
gling to survive severe economic re-
cession and crippling interest rates.
It means we will have to learn to be-
come accountable, and be proud of that
accountability. Until we learn to
celebrate success instead of failure;
until we learn to take responsibility,
to make hard decisions and learn to
live with the alienation that leader-
ship sometimes brings; until we learn
to be humanistic managers of all our
resources, the establishment will con-
tinue to patronize us.

Dear Ladies,

In the July/August ‘All She Wrote,'
you mention that your "...faces are
red, because Hawaii is in a latitude
that does not experience a solstice."
I beg to disagree. In ‘Ka ‘Elele,'
the Bishop Museum newsletter, I found
the following information.

"This is the time of year when the
sun casts a shadow to the south for
those of us lucky enough to be living
in Hawai'i. And on certain special
days high noon just couldn't get any
higher: the sun will be directly
overhead, causing a shadowless noon.

This phenomenon does not occur
anywhere else in the United States,
and in any one location in Hawai'i
this phenomenon occurs just twice a
year: once while the sun is moving
northward in our sky and then when
the sun has turned around and is

On June 21, the sun reached its
northernmost limit--at 23.5 degrees,
just 2 degrees north of Honolulu; this
event is called the Summer Solstice.
During July the sun will again pass
directly overhead in Hawai'i producing
shadowless noons for Hawaiian places
at these times and dates: July 12
in Lihue at 12:44, July 16 in
Honolulu at 12:37, July 18 in Kauna-
kakai at 12:34, July 19 in Wailuku
at 12:32, and July 25 in Hilo at
12:26."

Since the Summer Solstice is simply
the time that the sun is no longer
moving northward on the ecliptic, it
follows that the only place that would
not observe a Summer Solstice would be
a place where the sun has no fluctua-
tions to north or south in the sky.
Logically, the only place that this
could happen would be directly on the
Equator.

Hawaii does, indeed, enjoy the
Summer Solstice.

Sincerely,
Carol W. Noel
