WOMEN'S SUPPORT GROUP  
OF THE WAIANAE COAST  

In 1978, as is the custom on the  
Waianae Coast, a group of women met  
informally around a kitchen table to  
"talk story" and share events of the  
past week, the joys and sorrows of  
their families and friends and news  
about the communities in which they  
lived and worked. Later, in discussing  
this morning session, Mabel DeCambra  
and Sister Anna McAnany, a Maryknoll  
nun and resident of the area, said,  

"We women need a way to support each  
other", and the idea of a Women's Sup-  
port Group was born and carried on with  
the help of Maryknoll.  

Beginning as a one-to-one source of  
help to women with problems, groups of  
women met once a week to share experi-  
ences and encourage each other. Soon  
they found themselves called in to  

give aid in community issues. Support  
was needed for the Spouse Abuse Center,  

some single-parent mothers faced a  
housing crisis, schools on the Coast  
faced many challenges. Sister Anna  
broadened the group's vision with a  
program designed to teach alternatives  
to violence in the schools participated.  

A newsletter was published. In-  
creasingly the Women’s Support Group  

was asked to sponsor community causes  

and became recognized as a vital part  
of community life. The group began  
learning the process of building a  

community that has no geographical  
limitations. Through participating in  
the Nuclear Free Pacific Conference of 1980,  
(held in Hawaii), and through close  
ties with Asia and El Salvador, women  
are learning to connect personal issues  
with the broader issues of peace,  
autonomy, and economic necessity  
world-wide.  

Hawaiian culture, love of the land,  
the oppression of women and of Pacific  
peoples have become growing concerns.  
But above all, the freedom that comes  
through sharing friendship is a per-  
vading condition of their work.  

These themes became the recurring  
patterns of a book called, A Time for  
Sharing, Women's Stories from the Wai-  
anae Coast. On July 31st, the Support  
Group welcomed about 100 friends from  
the mainland and Honolulu to a  
celebration to launch their new book.  

About 20 women have shared their oral  
histories, poems, and illustrations  
about their lives on the Coast.  

The book is dedicated to Sister Anna.  

What lies ahead? A new center in  
a quonset hut where the work will pro-  
ceed, a hospitality program for fam-  
ilies living near the edge in these  
hard times, more sharing through  
friendship!
