OH WOW  

by Marla Hamabata  

“Japanese guys too slow, man,"  
Fran said, “take 'em months for hold  
your hand." "Haole guys go straight  
for french kiss first chance they get."  
"What dat, french kiss?" Gail asked.  
"Oh wow, you dunno?" "They stick  
their tongue in your mouth."  
"Beeeece!" Gail made a face.  
"What you mean, eeee?" "No make  
ugly face." "Wait till you try 'em."  
"Fran, you mean you let Tim do  
dat, stick his tongue in your mouth?"  
"Of course, and I dig it." Fran  
smiled.  
"Oh wow," was all Gail could say.  
She lay back in her bunk and pulled  
a blanket over her. Oh wow, she thought  
to herself. She wasn't sure if she  
could dig it like Fran, but she was  
willing to take her word for it. After  
all, Fran was one of the few freshman  
girls going steady and with an upper-  
classman at that. Tim was a junior.  
She was also the only Japanese girl  
in the whole school even dating a  
haole boy.  
But then, Fran was “hapa”, half  
Japanese and half haole. She looked  
more Japanese, though. She had long  

them look beautiful. “Most of Gail's  
classmates -- the local Japanese  
girls -- used scotch tape on their  
eyelids to double them over. "Double  
eyes" they called it. The scotch tape  
made their eyes look larger and round-  
er, not so slant, more like the haole  
girls in the glamour magazines.  

Like Gail, Fran was born and raised  
on Maui. That made her local to Gail,  
more Japanese than haole. Even though  
they weren't from the same school or  
town, they were both Maui girls, and  
this made them friends. Besides, they  
were roommates at their new school,  
Honolulu Pacific Academy. HPA was one  
of the few boarding schools in Hawaii.  

All of Gail's classes were required:  
Freshman English, Algebra, German,  
History of Western Civilization, and  
Bible Studies. She didn't have to  
take speech, though. She had passed  
the tests. As soon as every freshman  
arrived at HPA, they had to go through  
a series of oral examinations. Half  
the students were from the outer Is-  
lands, and it would be the first time  
they'd talk to so many haoles.  

Gail was scared the day of her  
tests. The same day she had moved into  
the dorms, and everything made her  
scared and nervous. Fran had already  
passed her tests and they waited out-  
side the classroom for Gail's turn  
with the teacher.  

"Eh, no be scared," Fran said.  
"Easy for pass. Just put on your good  
English, smile, and ‘speak well.'"  

Easy for you, Fran, Gail thought.  
She said, “You mean, 'Talk Good,' eh?"  

They laughed and poked each other  
in the ribs. But Gail still felt  
scared. She thought it was easy for  
Fran because she was hapa, her Mom  

was haole, so of course she could  
pass easily. Your Mom always talk  
good English at home, not like my  
house, she thought.  

Gail tried to remember what her  
sister had taught her the summer be-  
fore. Carol had graduated from HPA  
and was home from her mainland col-  
lege. All summer long Carol coached  
her in English and corrected her  
pidgin constantly. At the time, Carol  
drove Gail nuts and she hated it, but  
now she tried to remember.  

"Not bed-droom! You sound like one  
motorcycle," Carol said. "It's bed-  
room,"  

"Not Tree! It's three."  

"Not Did-dent! It's didn't."  

"Eh, fuck-it, Carol!" Gail finally  
said. "You sound like one dumb haole."  
"Watch your mouth, girl! You sound  

like one dumb local. You like take  
speech? You like be like your cousin  
Bobby? When the teacher asked him  
where he live, he said, ‘by the reevah.'  
When he said 'reevah' instead of river,  
he knew he nevah pass. And he got  

stuck in Speech class until senior  
year. And if you no pass speech, you  
no graduate. And Bobby nevah graduate."  

"I know," Gail said.  

"Yeah, you know everything." Carol  
continued, "You know how shame Aunty  
folks was."  

"Yeah, I know, I know."  

"You know Bobby stay one hippie Jap-  
anese in Kona now, living in one broken  
down shack on Grandma's empty lot.  
Growing coffee beans, he says. Coffee  
beans, my eye! He growing pakalolo!  

Now no can mention his name in front  
of Aunty, bumbai she cry, then Uncle  

thing son of yours for, spend all that  
money for send him good school, and for  
what? You no even graduate, too smart for  
learn to talk, too smart for work, too  
smart for be in business like me.  
Uncle keep going on and on forevah  
like that, especially when he drink,  
even at parties, make Aunty cry, make  
everybody shame, you like be like that,  
make everybody shame. You better learn  
for ‘speak well’ girl."  

"Okay, okay, enough already..."  

"River."  

"Bedroom."  

"Three."  

"Didn't," Gail said out loud.  

"Didn't what?" Fran asked.  

“Oh, nevah mind,” Gail said. "Time  
for go take my tests. See you la-ter."  
She went in smiling, leaving Fran  
pointing thumbs up behind her.  

She passed, classes started, and  
boys became her favorite subject. She  
was hot on boys. She did well in all  
her classes, though she was bored by  
them, but somehow boys seemed much  
more difficult. Gail looked around the  
room. It was a sunny, well-kept class-  
room. Fifteen freshmen sat in neat  
rows facing Rev. Harris and not lis-  
tening. All the boys sat on one side  
of the room and all the girls on the  
other. Gail surveyed the block of boys,  
pretending she was looking at the cat  
walking outside the window. All the  
boys were Japanese, except for one  
Filipino and two haoles, Dwayne and  
Mark, twin brothers. They weren't  
identical. Dwayne was a redhead,  
fat and freckled; Mark was dark-  
haired, a brunette, like the models  
in the hair color commercials. He  
was skinny and had a big nose. They  
weren't any more attractive than the  

rest of the boys, except that Mark  
was a star basketball player. And  
they didn't seem to act any differ-  
ent either. But Gail knew the twins  
were from the mainland, and they were  
definitely haole, so maybe they were  
fast.  

She noticed one of the local boys  
looking at her; it was Clayton Shin-  
tani, a Molokai boy. She turned qui-  
ckly and looked out the window again.  
The cat was sneaking around the cor-  
ner of the next building.  

At Maui Intermediate School, Gail  
had been voted Miss Most Likely to  
Succeed. She was president of this,  
chairman of that, star of her drama  
class, winner of the school spelling  
bee, but with boys she was a failure.  
"I'm too fat and too smart for Maui  
guys," she had told herself. She was  
glad to leave the nothing social life.  
So that summer she not only corrected  
her Pidgin but also her figure. From  
a ten and a half sub-teen dress size,  
she even learned how to use eye shadow  
and mascara to dazzle the HPA boys.  
She was going to go to a private  
school where the boys would be cuter  
and smarter and crazy to take out a  
beautiful, intelligent girl like Gail  
Kawamura.  

Shit, she thought, looking back at  
the boys in the classroom. Look at  
those turkeys, they don't look any  
cuter, smarter, or faster than the  
guys at Maui High -- Japanese, Fili-  
pino, or haole. I wonder which one  
of 'em is gonna ask me to dance to-  
night.
