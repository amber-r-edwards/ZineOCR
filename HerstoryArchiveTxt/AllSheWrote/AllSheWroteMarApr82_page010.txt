INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY  
On March 8, 1908 20,000 women in  
New York City went on strike and  
demonstrated against exploitation of  
working women and for the right to strike.  
In 1910 this day was proclaimed  
International Women's Day by a  
socialist conference and has been  
celebrated worldwide ever since.  
Suddenly this year Congress has  
proclaimed the week of March 7-13  
"Woman's History Week" as if to  
undercut this international and pro-  
gressive holiday. Perhaps they  
are wishing that women's soli-  
darity with progressive and  
revolutionary movements worldwide  
will fade.
