In Memory OF...

Lili'uokalani (born 1838, died 1917),  
was the last in the royal line of  
Hawaiian rulers. Her emphasis as  
queen was to regain the ruling power  
that was taken from her brother, King  
Kalakaua. In her attempt, she was  
dethroned and imprisoned. When re-  
leased, she went on to proudly devote  
the rest of her life to the welfare of  
the Hawaiian peoples.

In her book, Hawaii's Story by Ha-  
waii's Queen, she outlines her  

thoughts on Hawaiian autonomy. The  
following are but a sampling of  
these thoughts taken out of their  
whole context:

“We had allowed them virtually  
to give us a constitution, and  
control the offices of state.  
Not without protest, indeed;  
for the usurpation was un-  
righteous, and cost us much  
humiliation and distress.

But we did not resist it by  
force. It had not entered  
into our hearts to believe  
that these friends and allies  
from the United States, even  
with all their foreign af-  
finities, would ever go so  
far as to absolutely over-  
throw our form of govern-  
ment, seize our nation by the  
throat, and pass it over to  
an alien power.

And while we sought by peace-  
ful political means to main-  
tain the dignity of the  
throne, and to advance na-  
tional feeling among the  

Hawaiian people, we did not  
seek to rob any citizen,  
wherever born, of either  
property, franchise, or  
social standing."

It has been shown that in  
Hawaii there is an alien  
element composed of men of  
energy and determination,  
well able to carry through  
what they undertake, but  

not scrupulous respecting  
their methods. They doubt-  
less control all the resources  
and influence of the present  
ruling power in Honolulu,  

and will employ them tire-  
lessly in the future, as they  
have in the past, to secure  
their ends. This annexa-  
tionist party might prove to  
be a dangerous accession  

even to American politics,  
both on account of natural  
abilities, and because of  

the training of an auto-  
cratic life from earliest  
youth.

Many of these men are any-  
thing but ideal citizens  

for a democracy. That custom  
of freely serving each other  
without stipulation or reward  
which exists as a very nature  
among our people has been  
even exaggerated in our hos-  
pitality to our teachers and  
advisers. Their children,  
and the associates they have  
drawn to themselves, are  
accustomed to it. They have  
always been treated with  
distinction. They would hard-  
ly know how to submit to the  

rudeness and discourtesies of a purely  
emulative society.”

"But for the Hawaiian people,  
for the forty thousand of my  
own race and blood, descendants  
of those who welcomed the de-  
voted and pious missionaries  
of seventy years ago, - for  
them has this mission of mine  
accomplished anything? "

Lili'uokalani was also a prolific com-  
poser of chants and songs. To quote  
once again from her book;

"...I scarcely remember the  
days when it would not have  
been possible for me to write  
either the words or the music  
for any occasion on which  
poetry or song was needed.

To compose was as natural to  
me as to breathe; and this

gift of nature, never having  
been suffered to fall into dis-  
use, remains a source of the  
greatest consolation to this  
day. I have never yet numbered  
my compositions, but am sure  
they must run well up to the  
hundreds.... Hours of which  

it is not yet in place to  
speak, which I might have  

found long and lonely, passed  
quickly and cheerfully by,  
occupied and soothed by the  
expression of my thoughts in  
music; and even when I was  
denied the aid of any instru-  
ment I could transcribe to  
paper the tones of my voice."

To commemorate what would be her  

144th birthday on September 2, here is  
a song she wrote before becoming  
Queen. It is taken from Nā Mele o  
Hawai'i Nei (by Elbert and Mahoe):

PUNA PAIA  
"A'ALA  

Composed by Princess Lili'uokalani.

PUNA'S FRAGRANT  
GLADES  

Puna, Hawaii, is associated with  

fragrance, especially of pandanus, and fragrance is associated alike with  

noble birth and love making.  

(See "Nā Hala o Naue.")

The chorus in this song  

is sung as indicated below, but kilihea and nawela should probably be kilihē  
(drenched) and nawele (tracery).  
Ia Nā Puna paia ‘a'ala  

Pili mau nā ke onaona  

I laila ke kaunu ‘ana  

Kau pono ana nā ka mana'o.  

Hui  

Puna paia ‘a'ala  

Kilihea i ke onaona  

‘O nawela ike aloha  
Ua lawa id'oe me a'u.  

Ho'ohihi i ka nani  

Pua mai a ka lehua.  
Anehe au e ki'i  

I pua kau nō ku'u umauma.

In Puna's fragrant glades  
And ever-present perfume  
Passion  

Is ever in the thoughts.  

Chorus  
Puna's fragrant glades  

Are drenched with perfume  
in a tracery of love  

Where ‘you and I' suffice,  

Entranced with beauty  

The lehua blossoms.  

I come quietly to find  

A flower to place upon my heart.
