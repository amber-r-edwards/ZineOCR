Toshiko Takaezu, Hawaii's renowned ceramist, will be offering a
five-session workshop on "Exploring
Ceramic Potentials" or, as Toshiko
calls it, "No More Ducks." The work-
shop, which is held in the Richards
Street YWCA Toshiko Takaezu studio, is
a fun, creative exercise in self imagery
and expression to help students free
themselves from the confines of build-
ing identifiable forms, or "ducks."

Toshiko now lives on the mainland
and returns to Hawaii to visit her
family each year. Her workshops in
the studio that she donated to the
YWCA have become a traditional part of
her visits.

The workshop begins Friday, January
7th. There are no prerequisites
for participating. For more informa-
tion and registration contact the
Richards St. YWCA, 538-7061.

Toshiko Takaezu is a ceramic work-
shop of the YWCA of Oahu made possible
by a grant from the State Foundation
on Culture and the Arts.

CONFERENCE
LESBIAN
CONNECTIONS’

DATE: November 13-14, 1982

Presenters: Women of Both Sides Now,
Maui's Gay/Bi/Lesbian community organ-
ization,

Content: The first hour of our pre-
sentation is open to all women. We
will show the film Susana, an autobio-
graphical portrait of a young Argen-
tine's struggle between her love and
loyalty for her family and their ex-
pectations and hostility regarding her
love for women. Through effective jux-
taposition of actual interviews and
home movies, the film compassionately
conveys Susana's conflict in maintain-
ing her family relationships and com-
ing out as a lesbian. There will be
time for discussion and questions af-
terwards.

The second hour will provide an op-
portunity for lesbians from all the
islands (and elsewhere) to meet and
discuss areas of common concern.

Among the topics suggested: lesbian
mothers, couplehood, oppression of
lesbians in the women's community,
and closets. All lesbian-identified
women are welcome to join in this
networking time.
