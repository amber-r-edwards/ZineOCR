(Conference Cont from P9 ©)

to understand present conditions be-
tween white feminists and women of
color, we had to know the historical
background of the Women's Movement
in America. The factual historical
information which was available but
was made inaccessible to us by rac-
ism and class bias; even though
women of color and working-class
women from the very beginning con-
tributed greatly to the welfare of
women in general and to the survival of
the whole race.

A Black-American administrator of
Ethnic Studies and Women's Studies,
Yolanda Moses said, at the Closing
Plenary Session (EXTENDING OUR
CONNECTIONS THROUGH THE 1980's),
that in the 1980's we needed a part-
nership between Ethnic Studies and
Women's Studies simply because
Women's Studies would not be suc-
cessful until it became a consciously
multi-racial/class movement, and
Ethnic Studies could not be effective
without women getting involved. 
Many of the Third World Women's
Studies courses were presently
taught in the Ethnic Studies pro-
grams on some college campuses
rather than in Women’s Studies pro-
grams due to the similar peripheral
statuses and many commonalities in
their histories, approaches, and
politics. Third World Women's
Studies is doubly marginal in both
Women's Studies and Ethnic Studies.
She further pointed out that
there are many barriers to overcome
before Women's Studies and Ethnic
Studies could efficiently work to-
gether such as 1) Ethnic Studies'
perception of Women's Studies as
white middle-class dominated; 2) 
the need to deal with racism and to understand people
of color; 3) The dilemma of women
of color to understand sexism in
their organizations; 4) Ethnic
Studies' unwillingness to seriously
deal with sexism; and 5) How to
divide energy and cope with the
double burden of involvement in and
bridging of the two movements by
women of color.

To overcome the barriers men-
tioned above, she suggested two main
solutions which were, 1) Integration
of Women's Studies content into Ethnic
Studies curriculum; and 2) Integration
of Ethnic Studies materials into
Women's Studies curriculum.

Almost all agreed that there was an
urgent need for making connections,
building bridges, forming coalitions,
and bringing about unity within the
Women's Movement and Women's Studies.
We felt these were essential to eradi-
cate all oppressions in societies
where many political leaders refused
to acknowledge that history is moving
toward the actualization of social
reality without sexism and racism.
However, our answers as to how these
could be accomplished varied.

Vina Mazumdar from India proposed
that the elite women in India, like
herself, had to overcome the arrogance of
culture and birth to bring all women
into the Women's Movement. An Asian-
American poet, Nellie Wong, in a work-
shop entitled RACE, SEX, AND CLASS
INTERSECTIONS: WOMEN OF COLOR, pro-
posed that the multiply-oppressed
working-class women of color, like her-
self, had no choice but to become in-
volved in political activism commit-
ted to change and to make the Women's
Movement their movement in order to
eradicate all forms of oppression.

-aggression in Lebanon,

which they experienced in America.

All women in the Third World Cau-
cus agreed that rather than suppress-
ing differences by class, ethnicity,
race, age, religion, and sexual ori-
entation, to know ourselves and each
other better, we must first discover
our distinct identities and the dif-
ferences among ourselves. We must
also enlarge each other's perspec-
tives by listening to and learning
from each other in order to respect
our different histories and existences
before thinking about making connec-
tions. We believed that before we
make connections between women of
all backgrounds, we must first make
the Women's Movement every woman's
movement in order to liberate all
women.

At the Speakout Sessions, older
women, women in community organiz-
ations, women in pre K-12, students,
non-academic women, and lower-class
women all expressed their desire
for more recognition, respect from
NWSA and equal participation in the
NWSA conferences.

In the conference, one of the
most moving moments was at the Clos-
ing Plenary Session, when a tearful
Lebanese woman gave firsthand news
from her family and made an urgent
appeal for support to stop Israel's
aggression. This was
followed by a Jewish woman, repre-
senting the Ad hoc Committee of Jewish
Men and Women in San Francisco, endor-
sing the Lebanese woman's request.
Many women who were present in the
audience were wiping tears from their
eyes. 
In the light of the above experi-
ences at the conference, I came out
with a feeling that the most challeng-
ing task ahead of us in the 1980's was
to construct a feminist theory through
political experiences and analysis of

historical and psychodynamic inter-
relationship between all forms of
oppressions such as sex, race, class,
age, religion, ethnicity, and sexual
orientation. The reason is that both
experientially and academically, sex-
ism cannot be seen in isolation, but
only be understood in the context of
and in relation to other forms of
oppression. To do this, we need an
enlarged definition of "feminism,"
not as a political rhetoric or an
abstract concept but as a construction
of social reality of “being-in-the-
world with people with a more humane,
compassionate form of consciousness
and a responsive world view and be-
havior."

To Patty-

This October we will have
known each other for 20
years. I think that is re-
markable. People pass
through my life in a contin-
uous procession. Quite a
few of them have disappointed
me. But your friendship has
been unwavering.

In a world
where transient relation-
ships seem to be the norm, I
am fortunate to share such an
enduring friendship with you.
I love you, Patty.
