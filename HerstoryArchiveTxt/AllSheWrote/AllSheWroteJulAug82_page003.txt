Our collective has been going through a burn out phase for several meetings - taking into account each  
month. It is not the result of any one thing; the collective members have  
been going in different directions with their lives. Some of the women  
have dropped out and others felt they did not have the energy to commit  
themselves to the various tasks involved in putting out the paper.  
We realized we had a problem and we cared enough to not let All She Wrote  
crumble into ruin. So we asked Dee, the All She Wrote collective  
thanks you for being a catalyst for our growth. We wish you the best in  
your move to California. The community at large will miss your genius for  

helping others to help themselves.
