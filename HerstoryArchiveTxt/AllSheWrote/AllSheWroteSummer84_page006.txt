FEMINISM AND SPORTS PSYCHOLOGY  
by Dee Preston-Dillon  

The 1984 Olympics has certainly  
increased our awareness of the im-  
portance of mental fitness through  
sports psychology.  

The various forms of hypnosis  
and relaxation techniques used by  
Russia and Scandinavia are now  
gaining a respectful place in  
training the professional and ama-  

teur athlete.  

Women in competition face sev-  
eral unique issues where feminism  
and mental fitness training may  
provide some support. Three com-  
mon areas of concern include: power,  
identity, and competition. Recent  
research into androgynous behavior  
and athletes' motivation lead  
us to examine the values, percep-  
tion and attitude keys to the suc-  
cessful athlete. What makes an  
athlete a success? A winner? What  
motivates some individuals to go  
beyond social pressure and break  
through the norm? How can compe-  
tition be promoted and experienced  
as a positive health-giving endeav-  
or? How are these goals congruent  
with feminist ideals?  

Sports psychology offers an  
avenue to explore these issues as  
they directly affect women. This  
article is intended to give a  
brief glimpse at this expanding are-  
na and to link the area of mental  
fitness with the philosophy of  
feminism.  

This linkage can be expressed in

THE PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION:  

In this first structure femin-  
ism flows into sports psychology  
to give it a positive perspective  
on the power and potential of  
women athletes. Sports psychology  
flows back to feminism with the  
skills and techniques tailored for  
mental fitness for women. Femin-  
ist principles and mental fitness  
skills now blend to bring about a  
transformation of consciousness for  
the athlete. The individual or  
team is now prepared with a fertile  
and powerful foundation for an ath-  
letic peak experience. This is  
when the individual is most recep-  
tive to the power of her mind to  
create exactly what she imagines. It  
is with great ease and without con-  
scious effort that the individual  
activates all her internal resourc-  
es and moves rhythmically and per-  
fectly for a peak performance. The  
ingredients include total focused  
concentration, relaxation packed  
with potential and precision of at-  
tuned attentiveness throughout her  
body-mind consciousness.

IDENTITY  

THE TRAINING STRUCTURE:  

The second diagram demonstrates  
the flow of energy into the individ-  
ual identity. Here power is experi-  
enced as a positive support for the  
self throughout the team. Competi-  
tion is an offer to increase person-  
al power. Competition is an oppor-  

tunity to press against the bounda-  
ries of personal potential. It is  
an offer to exceed one's personal  
best and the only way this is pos-  
sible is through the extensions of  
personal power from the competitor.  
This meeting to expand potential is  
a most intimate time. Without the  
stretching of one's will and  
power, the other is defeated.  
When women athletes compete and  
fully participate, the individual  
is empowered. For this creative  
act of empowerment to happen,  
negativity must be absent. One's  
identity is crystallized with mag-  
nificent clarity. Energy is in-  
creased because it is not drained  
by pre- or post-resentment, un-  
realistic expectations or embitter-  
ment. The potency of an accepted  
androgynous self is free to draw on  

left and right brain skills. The  
integrated woman athlete crowns her-  
self, and the collective uncon-  
scious womanhood, with a wholeness  
and synchronicity unexplainable in  
normal reality.  

Within a feminist framework the  
competitor is no rival to beat,  

with the Universe.  

There are a lot of pieces missing  
between the lines here. As a mental  
fitness trainer and an athlete, I  
fill in the spaces with techniques  
such as guided imagery, visualiza-  
tion, meditation, and consciousness  
concepts. This training is for the  
professional or amateur, individual  
or team. These are powerful tools  
to guide and empower athletes to  
further their potential. The exper-  
ience changes people's entire lives.  
Some goals include weight control,  
increased self-esteem, confidence,  
stress management, and anxiety and  
fatigue control, precision and moti-  
vation.  

The outcome of training is always  
exceptional. You cannot open the  
doors of consciousness and leave  
without a new, more meaningful  
experience of yourself and others.
