‘A Lesbian Mothers Anthology  
“Piecing Together The Fragments Of Our Lives—  
Finding Our Own Designs”  

We, a multi-ethnic group of lesbian  
mothers, have decided to collect and  
edit an anthology of writings by les-  
bian mothers, co-mothers, and women  
who have made substantive commitments  
to lesbian mothers and their children.  
This anthology will seek to relieve  
the isolation of lesbian mothers as  
well as to smash the myth that we do  
not exist. In addition, this antholo-  
gy will provide a forum for the myriad  
issues impacting lesbian mothers,  
their children, and partners; explore  
the diverse ways that women, their  
children, and familial units relate to  
each other; provide a vehicle through  
which women who do not consider them-  
selves writers or women who have never  
before been in print to have their  
stories, poems, prayers, rituals, and  
songs nurtured and supported into  
print; and to record and document les-  
bian mothers’ survival, resistance,  
creativity, healing, and vision.  

Together we have bonded ourselves  
to each other, named this work, commit-  
ted the next two years to allowing it  
to be born, and adopted the concept of  
La Familia Meztiza to guide and struc-  
ture our working together.  

The concept of La Familia Meztiza,  

a family of mixed bloods and/or per-  
sons related by spirituality, politics,  
and struggle, is the work of a multi-  
ethnic group of women whose conscious  
political struggle was born out of the  
Welfare Rights Movement and their ex-  
periences as mothers. Operating as a  
group since the mid-sixties they work  
together to raise their children and  
to provide each other with a family  
model which lies in the path of direct  
resistance to the patriarchal family  
model of this society.  

We have become an extended familial  
unit of La Familia Meztiza and honor  
their work and vision by committing  
our work and ways of living with them.  

JULY / AUGUST  

Whether living close or distant, wheth-  
er working together or as individuals  
in our respective communities, we main-  
tain the concept of ourselves as a  

unit who communicate, share love,  
ideas, and support, to help each other  
to continue to work and mother. Deci-  
sions are reached in a matrifocal fami-  
ly way through discussion, argument,  
and in the presentation of personal  
herstory to support a position. When  
disagreements occur the elder members  
of the group make a final decision.  

We are:  

Peggy Sullivan (46) residing in Berkeley,  
CA; a native of New Mexico, and a  
black lesbian mother of one son.  

Rosamaria Zayas (41) living in Santa  
Cruz, CA; a Puerto Rican mother of  
five, and a community worker and acti-  
vist.  

Robin Song (38) of Pacifica, CA; a  
working-class native Californian, lesbi-  
an mother of two daughters, and a com-  
munity worker in S.F.  

Andrea Canaan (32) residing in Oakland,  
CA; from New Orleans, LA, a black les-  
bian writer with one daughter who is  
co-mothered.  

Jeane Vaughn (29) living in Santa Cruz,  
CA; a lesbian welfare mother of one  
son, who is of immigrant and working-  
class background.
