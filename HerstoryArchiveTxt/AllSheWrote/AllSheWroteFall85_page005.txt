is pleased to  
reprint her  
acceptance  
remarks,  

Thank you for honoring me  
with this award for leadership  
in Asian and Pacific Island  
Affairs. I am happy to  
accept it, knowing that I  
represent many other Asians  
and Pacific Islanders, who  
deserve this honor more, if  
not just as much as I do. I  
speak as a second-generation  
American of Filipino ancestry  
who grew up on a sugar  
plantation in Hawaii;  
secondly, as a woman; and  
thirdly, as an educator and  
advocate for the rights of  
people who are unable to  
represent themselves.  

As I look about this  
gathering, it is obvious that  

forever we have been engaged in education and  
community work for as long or  
longer than the more than  
thirty years that I have spent  
doing such work.  

I have mixed feelings  
about this honor. I am often  
reminded of how inadequate my  
efforts have been. So much  
still needs to be done to  
achieve the standards of  
excellence in education and of  
equal opportunity for Asians  
and Pacific Islanders for  
which this award was created.  
For me, perhaps the term  
"Pacific Islanders" is a term  
that is inadequate to address  
the situation in Hawaii, where  
a group of people, native to  
the Islands, were dispossessed.  
So the term "Hawaiian", which  
used to refer to the native  
Polynesians who settled  
Hawaii, now also refers to  
people of all groups who call  
Hawaii their home, thus  
concealing the problems of  
Native Hawaiians.  

I am reminded of the  
attitude of the French  
existentialist philosopher,  
Jean-Paul Sartre, when he  
turned down the Nobel Prize he  
had been awarded. I don't put  
myself on the same level of  
accomplishment as Sartre, but  
it is instructive to note that  
Sartre believed that we should  
do what we think ought to be  
done to improve our society,  
without regard for any rewards

we might receive for such  
actions. As a consequence, he  
felt that rewards are  
unnecessary and meaningless.  

While it is possible to  
understand his position, we  
also must be aware that those  
who receive honors, such as  
the one you are granting me,  
are really surrogates for  
countless others who receive  
very little or no recognition  
at all for their efforts.  

Today, because of  
publicity, such as a recent  
cover article in Parade  
Magazine about the success of  
Asian-Americans, there is a  
belief that Asian and Pacific  
Islanders in America are doing  
very well. Those of us who  
succeed in this society, just  
as is the case with our Black,  
Hispanic, and Native American  
brothers and sisters,  
represent only a very small  
part of our group. For most  
Asian and Pacific Islanders,  
success requires overcoming  
difficulties which do not  
exist for the general run of  
Americans.  

Perhaps some may feel it  
to be inappropriate for me to  
speak this way at a ceremonial  
occasion such as this, but I  
must, out of respect for the  
feelings of all those I  
represent, speak out against  
the hypocrisy of our society.  

Whether we belong to the  
Republican, Democratic,  
Independent, or any other —  
political party, we should,  
first of all, care  
about everyone's human civil  
rights. Allegiance to that  
principle comes before  
allegiance to an individual or  
leader who represents us  
politically.  

As a member of Hawaii's  
State Advisory Committee to the  
U.S. Commission on Civil  
Rights, and until about two  
months ago, the chair of that  
Committee, I am fully aware  
that the present national  
administration is seeking to  
turn back the clock on civil  
rights in America. The  
Commission and the Justice  
Department, at the insistence  
and direction of the President  
and his advisors, are moving  
to take back from those of us  
who are not White and not male  
the precious few rights and  
advantages we have won at such  

great cost over the past few  
decades.  

The President and his  
supporters speak of reverse  
discrimination. They try to  
assert that affirmative action  
programs discriminate against  
men and Whites. Well, I have  
never known it to be necessary  
for a man to demonstrate that  
he is able to do a job as well  
as a woman! When has a White  
man had to show that he is  
competent, even though he is  
White and male?  

We live in a society  
where a place is reserved in  
the medical or law school for  
the son of an influential  
politician or a relative of a  
donor to a university's  
endowment fund, but when  
efforts are made to ensure  
that deserving and qualified  
Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and  
Pacific Islanders have places  
in such schools too, it is  
immediately labeled "reverse  
discrimination."  

Even if we were not  
living through a period when  
the Civil Rights Division of  
the Justice Department is  
headed by a person who is  
opposed to the very programs  
that make it possible for  
under-represented groups to  
find an equal place in  
society, and is backed by a  
like-minded President, this  
nation would still have a long  
way to go before all Americans  

enjoy  

the equal rights that lead toward  
equality for all in all endeavors. I  
certainly hope that is so, and  
I know that we will never give  
up hope and will never give up  
the struggle.  

I am sure that you, as  
educators, know how important  
it is for our young people, of  
all racial and ethnic groups,  
and regardless of sex, to be  
aware of their own worth, at  
the earliest possible age. We  
must not force the next  
generation of Americans to  
fight the same battles that  
were won in the past and which  
we may be losing today.  

You have honored me  
tonight and I accept your  
honor on behalf of all of us  
who, in spite of all that has  
happened, believe that the  
American ideal will come true.
