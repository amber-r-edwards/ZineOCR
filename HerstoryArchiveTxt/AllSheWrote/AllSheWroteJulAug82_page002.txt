Hi,

Enclosed is $10 for a subscription  
of All She Wrote.

The collective has an outstanding  
publication. It's easy to see some peo-  
ple are putting a lot of research time  
in gathering historical and in-depth  
facts to present in many of the vari-  
ous articles and reports. I can see  
the labor of love to put this publi-  
cation together will foster personal  
satisfaction and hopefully measurable  
results concerning the rights of  
women in our still persecuted com-  
munities. Your printed word constantly  
getting around our town will have a  
far-reaching effect to impress faces  
in many closed minds.

By the way, 'Dignity' is an organi-  
zation throughout the United States  
and Canada for Gay & Lesbian Roman  

Catholics. Yours truly,

James Slatkavitz

AFLOAT AT ALA MOANA  
There .

As her waves soothingly caress  
My thoughts into oneness  
With the silence of the deep blue  
mine above Me.  
I lay, afloat slowly, effortlessly  
"CREKSITS direction with the flow,  
The whatever for awhile  
Nothing matters.  
Another swimmer,  
A nibbling baby fish,  
A stirring memory  
Motions me to reality  
To my life form presently  
Treading back to shore  
So soon upon my feet  
Behind me another world.  
There.

Kathy.

LUNA CAP

Eyes flashing gold  
dear sister moon  
sending refracted rainbows  
across lotus plains  
sharing prismic tunnels  
holding me closely

my flaming love  
splashing pure light  
and washing our soul.

jaeianeee Conviction

I don't want you to scrub my mildew

wash my socks  
or stack my dishes

I don't need you to affirm the drudgery of my life

wallow in the dirt

I want you to affirm the transcendent

the timeless

I don't want you curled night after night in sheets  
that are washed every two weeks, on Saturday, at noon,  
the fruit and dirt of our passion, drained away in

Dynamo

in a soap opera-trodden laundromat

Lovers, I don't want

Ahh, but to exist in the eternity of your embrace,

under moonlit skies,

submerged in the phosphorescent sea  
To know the depth of your soul, the lack of dimensions

in your spirit,

the intra-existence of our beings through all which is us  
If I can know the convergence of our beings, as well as

the essence of Be-ing

Then perhaps I can begin to know the matrix of you  
When I affirm my essence and you affirm yours

we will transcend the boundaries that keep us apart  
Perhaps, then you can scrub my mildew,

maybe I'll wash your socks

Then we can start all over again knowing we are,  
with the assurance, that while Be-ing

we are watching  
and by watching  
there is more
