The Lesbian Rap group welcomes all  
women who are interested in being part  
of a support group for lesbians. The  
group discusses various topics and al-  
so has social events.

Discussion topics include social in-  
teraction, being out in your job, com-  
ing out, role playing, and lesbianism  
and feminism. Members, who have volun-  
teered, serve as discussion leaders.

For a change of pace, some fun, and  
an opportunity to get to know each  
other in different situations, the wo-  
men have had potlucks, a sunset barbe-  
cue, gone out to dinner, been to  
HULA's, gone ice skating, and partici-  
pated en masse in the HALLOWEEN DANCE.

The group meets on Wednesdays at  
7:30 p.m. at the University YWCA.

For more information, call 538-7061,

NEW BOOK REFUTES EASY CURES FOR  
AGORAPHOBIA

Agoraphobics—those unable to leave  
their home—are on strike against the  
female condition. This is one of the  
startling conclusions made by psychoan-  
alyst Robert Seidenberg, and former  
N.O.W. president Karen DeCrow in WO-  
MAN WHO MARRY HOUSES: PANIC AND PRO-  
TEST IN AGORAPHOBIA (McGraw-Hill Paper-  
backs, an original, $7.95; hardcover  
$15.95, Publication Date: April 11,  
1983).

At least four million people suffer  
from agoraphobia and 88 percent of  
them are women. Since only in pregnan-  
cy do we find a higher incidence of wo-  
men, the authors say there must be a  
reason why this afflicts women dispro-  
portionately. They note that the fate  
of women throughout the centuries has  
been to "marry houses," i.e., to be  
wedded to the domestic aspects of life,  
and they are still not wanted in the  
marketplace. According to Seidenberg  
and DeCrow agoraphobics are using a  
metaphor to demonstrate how their  
lives have been defined: If you tell  
me my place is in the home, that is  
where I will stay, is what they are  
saying. These women become, literally,  
housewives.

WOMEN WHO MARRY HOUSES includes il-  
luminating case studies, information  
from medical and social journals, and  
analyses of famous agoraphobes includ-  
ing Emily Dickinson, Queen Victoria,  
and N.C. Wyeth's daughter Carolyn.

The authors are critical of the ma-  
ny alleged "cures" for agoraphobics,

pointing especially to an article in  
The New York Times Magazine (Julie  
Baumgold, "Agoraphobia, Life Ruled By  
Panic," December 4, 1977) that gave  
the impression that therapy and drugs  
were legitimate "cures" for the "dis-  
ease." Seidenberg and DeCrow refute  
dozens of cures, from those reviewed  
in medical journals to those revealed  
to mass audiences on 60 Minutes and  
the Phil Donahue Show.

WOMEN WHO MARRY HOUSES maintains  
that only the equal acceptance of wo-  
men in the world outside the home will  
address the fear and rage of these  
women who appear to be paralyzed in-  
side it. Only when society encourages  
women to do fully accepted and compen-  
sated work outside, will they no long-  
er need to be agoraphobic.
