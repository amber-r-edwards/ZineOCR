All She Wrote: Hawaii Women's Voices ADVERTISEMENTS JOINING THE COLLECTIVE  
is published by a volunteer collective  
of women at the University YWCA. Membership is open to any woman sharing  
the group's goals and committed to the  
EDITORIAL collective will be accepted under the  
following conditions:  
All She Wrote is a feminist paper. By this we mean the paper will:  
1) Reflect the collective's commitment to a feminist consciousness,  
2) Be supportive of all women,  
3) Reach out to all women,  
4) Provide a forum for input,  
5) Be a growing process.  
6) Be camera ready.  
The All She Wrote collective encourages articles by and about the women  
of Hawaii. Because we seek the widest  
possible representation of women in our community, all submissions will  
be considered. We feel that each woman  
knows what she wants to convey and has  
her own unique style; for example, pidgin; therefore, those pieces selected  
will be edited only for spelling and  
punctuation. Changes in length, grammar, and content will not be made unless  
negotiated with the author. Due to  
space limitations, articles are generally two typed pages, double spaced.  
Articles, graphics, poetry, and cartoons  
should be submitted to: All She Wrote, University YWCA, 1820  
University Ave., Honolulu, HI 96822. Please include a  
stamped, self-addressed envelope.
