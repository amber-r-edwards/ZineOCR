SES

On Weaning In America

At 13 months

May Ching's tender skin has erupted into  
flaming rash from neck to ankle

Blotchy red patches like

wild strawberries proliferating under moonlight

Give her ginseng

Rub the sores with ointments, lotions  
Bathe in rind of watermelon

Powder of oatmeal

PAW-PAW'S herbs

She sleeps fitfully

Surrounded by shadow puppets, stuffed animals  
In a while she will awaken and

I will go to her

In front of me  
My first play  
"Paper Angels"  
History of my people on Angel Island

When I think of Ma-Ma

Walking down the dock

Third sister in hand

Following a thousand men and women  
Down a dirt path

I not yet even born for eight years  
You disappear into a wooden building  
Never to emerge again  
Never to speak English

When I think of you  
Sitting before the white interrogation officer  
Speaking a foreign tongue

I am tongue-tied —

When I think of who you might have been

A young Kwantung woman

‘So lucky, yes, so lucky they said

To have married a handsome GUM-SAN HOCK

And go to GUM-SAN

Leaving two daughters behind who never forgot  
Who never forgot because

They were reported as sons

They were left behind

When I think of who you might have been besides  
A seamstress

Besides a mother of seven

Besides a green card holder

I imagine you escaping like

Smoke rising from a burning bush

Your wife falling like ashes about your feet  
Rising, rising

Far, far like the phoenix

Away from us

Freed from us

Who possess you

At last, at last

To rise again

Yellow woman  
Moon chanter  
Spinner of Truth  
Weaver of dynasties  
Wisdom and magic  
Silent sorceress  
Herb healer  
Mother of Pearl  
Stone of Heaven  
Wings of Dragon  
Claws of Tiger  
Ocean Goddess

AH-PAW  
AH-GOO  
AH-MA

Bending over ricefields

Stirring supper over coals

Sewing blouses, scrubbing floors  
Your days burned soon as they were lit  
Like firecrackers, POP! Pops

Leaving only little shreds of memory  
Paper-wrapped money for MUI-MUI

Red ribbons, pomegranate cheeks  
Bright oranges, good luck scrolls  
Thousand year old eggs

Waiting to be scraped

When I think of you in that boat

Third sister in hand

Alone among the seaweed, fish and anemone  
Eating salt cabbage and gruel

I ashamed of my wastefulness

Before me, bits of poems  
Fragments of dreams  
scattered strawberries  
unripe

Ma

I have dreamed of you

Head bent, staring out of open windows  
Burning incense with ivory fingers  
Boiling herbs in a dark kitchen

Where demons were cursed

Ma

I have dreamed of you

You are the face I have seen  
illuminated in the water

You are the slave-girl  
Riding Pacific waves

Ma-Ma

You are the wisdom

Between reason and truth

You are the ancestral lamb  
You are the ritual that  
must repeat

AH-MA

You tell me to take May Ching off my breast

But when I feel her reaching for me, looking up at me  
Eye full of innocence and wonder

Tugging at my blouse

When I hear the rhythm of her gentle sucking

Silent gulping tapering

Melting off the edge

Into a river of sighs

I think of long journeys  
Sisters left behind

And I think

How can I deny my daughter  
The breast I never got?
