LETTERS TO EDITOR

Dear Sisters at ALL SHE WROTE:

I am the State of Hawaii representa-
tive to the National Coalition Against
Domestic Violence. I am also the wo-
men's advocate at Hale Loko Maika'i,
Women Helping Women's Battered Women's
Shelter. NCADV is literally the um-
brella under which battered women's
programs exist. NCADV creates model
national legislation for each state to
attempt to adopt. NCADV strengthens
and disseminates information among do-
mestic violence programs. NCADV is
our lifeline, linking the grassroots
systems to one another and broadening
our power base to effect social change.
NCADV is in severe financial crisis.
We (all women, really) need for NCADV
to remain in existence. The Formerly
Battered Women's Task Force is asking

for our support in a nationwide fund-
raising campaign of One Woman-One Dol-
lar. The original idea was that if
every battered woman gave one dollar,
NCADV would immediately have $200,000!
Then it expanded to any person giving
a dollar for a battered woman. We
need the support of as many women and
men as we can find. This is truly a
worthwhile cause. I am enclosing
NCADV information on this particular
fundraiser as well as NCADV in general.
I am also enclosing active and suppor-
tive membership applications. My fan-
tasy is that you will be able to
shrink the graphic enclosed and put it
in your paper. I have absolutely no
budget for this fundraiser. If that
is not possible, maybe the "One Woman-
One Dollar" copy should be put in your
letter column.

MAY/JUNE

Thanks for the ear! If you have
any questions or any further ideas
that could be helpful to me in raising
lots of money, please write to me at
Women Helping Women.

Mahalo!

In Sisterhood,

Lee Stein

Hawaii State Representative
for NCADV

One Dollar campaign.)

Dear ASW Editor:

I commend Alice Yun Chai for her
sensitive observations on the Novem-
ber 1982 Women's Studies Conference
"Concepts and Strategies." You are
not alone.

SELF-DISCOVERY WORKSHOP"

JOIN AND HAVE FUN IN SELF-DISCOVERY
with Elisha

Kreative Therapy--Self development

through CREATIVE MEDIA

Usually done in small groups 6-12.
Uses art, movement, play, words, mu-
sic as a tool to project one's Inner
to see what is really inside and to
get to know oneself on a deeper level.
The kreative therapy uses these tools
for different reasons:

- Focus on the part that is undiscov-
ered or neglected and yet full of
energy and creativity.

- Words can easily confuse, diffuse,
divert, and cover up one's Inner Being.
- Different intellectual levels

often create communication difficul-
ties.

- Non-verbal methods can reveal
more of a person, so projecting

the truth in that person, for as far
as the person wants to go.

We work on subjects, usually com-
ing out of the group. After the crea-
tive part, we have a sharing and time
for feedback, to add verbal clarity
to the intuitive/subconscious process.
We will discover which parts of our-
selves we like and want to emphasize
and which parts we like to change.
And with this knowledge, we can look
for and find a way to alter our way
of living into a more satisfying life.
Because of this sometimes vulnerable
spot, we ask for a month commitment so
that everybody can feel free, safe,
and supported by the same group of
people.

The facilitator chooses the most
appropriate method for the subject
and guides the participants through
their creative process and the ver-
balization, both as individuals and in
the group, to let people experience
their fullest potential.

Also, communication and sharing
skills will improve and expand by the
sessions.

There is a great deal of comfort
and safety and last but not least

-ELISHA BERGER

a great deal of humor and joy in
these kreative groups.

16 at 7:30 till about 9:30 and will

$45.00. The minimum amount of parti-
cipants will be six and the maximum

quired by May 8 at the University.

CHARLOTTE PERKINS GILMAN'S
"THE YELLOW WALLPAPER”

Sandra de Helen has been a perform-
er since the age of 3--about the time
she learned to talk. Her first public
performance consisted of singing and
tap-dancing in a recital of Miss Zoe's
School of Dance in Rolla, Missouri.

In the ensuing years she has acted,
sung, and performed as both a solo
comic and half of the de Helen/Kasten
comedy team. She is also a playwright
of some renown. (She wrote "The No-
torious McCorkle Sisters", among
others, and she and Kate Kasten co-
authored the Nancy Drew satire, "The
Clue in the Old Birdbath"). She is a
director, having recently directed
"Female Parts" for New Rose Theatre,
and "The Notorious McCorkle Sisters"
for radio. She is a producer, song-
writer, founder of Portland's Women's
Theater Company, and co-founder of
Kansas City's Actors' Sorority.

In 1982, Cascade Voice, of Portland,
presented de Helen with the Newsmakers’
Award for Outstanding Entertainment.

de Helen will perform her adapta-
tion of "The Yellow Wallpaper" by
Charlotte Perkins Gilman, as well as
the one-act "Della Malloy" by Rebecca
Gordon at the Women's Center on July
2 at 8:00 pm. "Wallpaper" is a clas-
sic feminist short story written in
1888. The story of a woman's mental
breakdown, it was wrenched out of
Gilman's own life, and is unique among
her works for its authenticity and
power. "Della" is a contemporary com-
edy about a middle-aged mother of sev-
en who hopes to make her entire family
rich by writing an autobiographical no-
vel with something for everyone.
