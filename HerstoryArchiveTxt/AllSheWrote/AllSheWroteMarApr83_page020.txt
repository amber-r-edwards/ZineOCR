discover what professional socio-  
logists and criminologists had to  

say about this. I discovered that  
criminologists rarely commented on  
these patterns, even when they were  
present in their own data sets. If  

a comment did appear, it was usually a  
reiteration of the court's contention  
that young girls needed incarcera-  
tion more than boys to "protect"  
them.  

Because I was a feminist looking  
at these patterns, such facile  
explanations rang hollow. I simply  
put myself in the position of the  
young girl on the examining table.  
After some hesitation I decided to  
publish an alternate explanation of  
the patterns I had seen in my data.  
Much to my committee's surprise, the  
work was published and over the years,  
has occasioned considerable comment  
in the field.  

Needless to say, as I was working  
in this area, other feminists around

CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR WOMEN (CEW)  
on the move....  

CEW has moved to a new spot on the  
UH campus between Krauss and Kuyken-

because they've picked up their build-

We knew FLORENCE LAU could move moun-

the country were seeing the same pat-  
terns; we read each other's work obs-  
essively. Again, because we were fem-  
inists, we were eager to create col-  
leagues and to nurture each other.  
Out of our collective work on the im-  
portant issue of sexism in juvenile  
justice has come a very strong network  
of both practitioners and academics  
who, because they do not play male  
games, are able to empower each other  
in ways that men marvel at. This net-  
work has also, with virtually no money,  
managed to convene a number of nation-  
al conferences on this long neglected  
subject and to move very traditionally  
girl serving organizations (such as  
the Girl Scouts and Girls Clubs) to  
put the concern on their national agen-  
da. Finally, the network has pub-  
lished the only recent books on the  
problems of female delinquency in Ame-  
rica.  

I share this story not to brag about  
our achievements; indeed, we will be

lucky to survive the Reagan years and  
we have a tremendous amount of work to  
do with and for the young women still  
lodged in juvenile justice systems a-  
cross America. Rather, I hoped to  
demonstrate that women in a male world  
who do not deny their womanhood may en-  
joy a form of success that is far more  
satisfying and exciting than the tradi-  
tional model while still having consi-  
derable impact on the male world. In-  
deed, as feminists work on projects,  
we are simultaneously exploring ways  
of achieving that will ultimately pro-  
vide our male colleagues with forms of  
success other than the macho model of  
achievement based on "profit," winning  
at all costs, hierarchy and competi-  
tion. This is certainly exciting and  
pioneering work, and it makes being a  
feminist "on the job" a constant and  
challenging adventure. Try it, I  
think you will find it irresistible.
