“Mrs K.”: Oral History of  
a Korean Bride  

By ALICE Y. CHAI.  
Installment III  

For four years my mother never  
stood up. That morning when I came  
to Korea, for the first time she  
told my family, "Please, somebody  
make me stand up, I like to try.  
Somebody told me behind, try walk  
this room to that room." I think  
I prayed to God, He make her stand  
up. That morning, she stood up.  
Then she held the wall a few steps,  
then sat down. Then, I went in. The  
whole family was so surprised:  
That month, too, I sent $50. I  
never missed one month, so nobody  
knew I was going. So, I just went  
in suddenly. My mother cried, too  
happy, you know, happy cry. Oh, I  
cried too. You don't know just how  
much the whole family was surprised.  
Big surprise...Everybody cried loud,  
happy cry. We all cried.  

My mother was sick four years,  
too long. So much suffering, she  
really became small and shrunk.  
Can't talk a word, memory all lost.  
She lost her mind. Sometimes she  

In 1923, Mrs. K., a nineteen-year-  
old picture bride-to-be, left a  
small mountain village in Kyong-  
sang province, Korea, to marry a  
forty-five-year-old Korean immi-  
grant who awaited her arrival in  
Honolulu, Hawaii. Now seventy-  
five years old, Mrs. K. has spent  
fifty-five years of her life as a  
resident of the island of Oahu.  

VISIT TO SICK MOTHER IN KOREA  

In 1932, after I was ten years  
in Hawaii, my mother was paralyzed  
and sick for four years. So, that  
time I had to go see my mother. My  
mother couldn't walk, couldn't talk for  
four years. My brother wrote to  
me and said, "This time if you  
don't come, you can't see Mother  
again. Mother is waiting for you,  
her only daughter. If you don't  
come, she can't get better, she  
can't die. Maybe, I think, she's  
waiting for you. You better come  

see her." For three years, one  
day no miss, I begged to God. "Please  
help me to go see my mother. My  
mother bore six children, but I am  
the only daughter, she has to see  
me. Mother can die or can get bet-  
ter after she sees me. I must go  
see my mother. Please, God, help  
me." I prayed for three years. One  

That's not easy. I had to sleep  
quick and then I get up and under  
the bed. I cried and prayed, prayed.  
Then, God gave me an idea! That  
time plenty ladies came from Masan  
and Pusan...I told all my friends  
and every place I went that I'm go-  
ing to Korea and they can send  
something to parents, I would take  
it. Then, all kinds and sizes pack-  
ages came in and with packages  
everybody gave me money. Oh, I  
collected about $250, everybody  
gave me big boxes, one big trunk  
I took, no limit. Plenty things I  
took over, no charge, you know.  
I am not seasick so I went on a  
small boat. That time small boat  
round trip only $55, believe it  
or not, so cheap. So I went to  
Korea myself.  

That time I had two girls, one  
boy. My younger daughter was nine  
months old and still taking my  
own breast milk. That time I didn't  
know how to feed bottle milk. So,  
I gave her to somebody. "Please  
take care for me. If she is real-  
ly hungry, she will take milk  
bottle."  

I took the President Lines boat  
and for one week I was very sick  
because my baby wasn't drinking my  
milk. But, every day, I stood  
up at the edge of the boat and I  
prayed, prayed to God, "Please, God,  
help me. I am a bad mother. If I am  
doing bad by leaving my baby, God,  
give me punishment. But I am going  
to see my mother, my mother wants  
to see me. So, I have proof, God  
help me." Then on August 1, 1935,  
by Korean Calendar, I landed in  
Pusan. I reached Korea in fifteen  
days.  

and better. Soon she can walk the  

whole village...I worked so hard, my  
father felt so sorry because after  
ten years visiting my family, I  

was cooking and working so hard,  

But I am happy because my mother is  

so happy.
