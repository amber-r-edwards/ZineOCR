maintain production levels, has nonethe-
less substantially reduced the number of
landless peasants and encouraged the for-
mation of cooperatives.

On another level, the revolution has
brought an enormous richness and vitality
to public life, especially for women.

This revolution was made primarily by
young men and women and by older women,
who were often drawn into the struggle
through their children; one of these wo-
men, in her mid-60s at the time of the
final victory in 1979, remembered: "I got
the news at night. I wanted to dance.
July 19 - the bells tolled for joy when
the kids won the war" (Margaret Randall,
Sandino's Daughters, p. iii, Vancouver:
New Star Books, 1981). Women have,
through their participation in the revolu-
tionary struggle, made a visible place for
themselves in public life and have even
begun to chip away at the patriarchal
division of labor within families.

It is difficult for North Americans,
so steeped in the world view of Western
individualism, to appreciate the extent to
which the revolution has empowered people,
enabling them to come together to do col-
lectively what they could not have done
alone. For example, when I spoke with
representatives of the teachers' union
(ANDEN) in the city of Esteli, I asked
them what motivated people to volunteer to
teach in the literacy campaign. (Literacy
volunteers gave 2 hours a day, 5 days a
week, for 2 years; 85% of the volunteers
were women). These young teachers had
great difficulty understanding my

question; they discussed it among them-

selves and asked for retranslation several

times. It seemed clear to me that, in
their eyes, I was simply asking the wrong
question. For them, the issue is not

“what's in it for me?" but the broader and
more collective “what must we do?” 
There is genuine public space in Nicaragua to-
day, a widespread attention to public life

that goes far beyond the usual North
American concern with "freedom from" ex-
ternal constraint. I made a point of
asking nearly everyone I met for views on
the government, and I found very few "no
opinions" about politics.
The visible presence of the opposi-
tion parties came as a surprise to me and
was an indication of the extent to which
the Reagan administration's positions on
Nicaragua have set the stage for North
American perceptions.
There are 6 opposition parties represented in the legisla-
ture; they claim approximately 40% of the
seats, while the FSLN (Sandinista National
Liberation Front) holds the remaining 60%.

These parties - 3 to the left of the FSLN
and 3 to the right - have billboards all
over the country proclaiming slogans such
as “revolution yes, but a Christian revo-
lution” or “support the family - vote
Conservative.” The remaining opposition
parties, those associated with Arturo
Cruz, chose (under substantial U.S. pres-
sure) to boycott the November, 1984
elections but nonetheless continue to
operate legally.
The amount of diversity in established political parties is far
greater than that found in the United
States and is comparable to that in many
northern and western European nations.
And this pluralism exists despite the war;
as opposed to the situation in many other
countries, the FSLN does not seem to be
using the war as an excuse to close down
the opposition, nor are they transferring
their hatred of the U.S. government to
U.S. citizens; all over the country people
universally make a distinction between
"Yankee" (the North American government)
and the "gringos" (the North American
people). We do not have to think back
very far in our own history to recall that
many nations have shown themselves inca-
pable of making this distinction.

The role of religion in Nicaraguan
politics is both fundamental and complex.
The split between those who support the
FSLN and those who oppose it is roughly
parallel to that between those who identi-
fy Christianity with the grassroots acti-
vism of the Christian base communities and
the liberation theologians, versus those
who connect it to the conservative church
hierarchy. Both of these sentiments are
widely expressed on posters and in pul-
pits. For those of us whose views of
political change are rooted in a secular
context, it is somewhat disorienting to
see Christianity interpreted as a revolu-
tionary social practice. It is a reminder
that the Nicaraguan revolution reflects a
specific combination of political, eco-
nomic, religious and nationalistic senti-
ments, a combination that ties it firmly
to its concrete context and makes it dif-
ficult to think about transferring it
elsewhere.
