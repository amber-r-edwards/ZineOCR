WOMEN'S HERSTORY

EXCERPTS FROM JUDY CHICAGO’S DINNER PARTY

Catherine Greene  
1731 - ca. 1794, USA  

Greene invented a method for  
separating cotton from its seed.  
She entrusted the fabrication of  
the machine she designed to her  
boarder, Eli Whitney, who nearly  
abandoned the project several  
times, but Greene continued to  
support and encourage him. By  
law, women were not able to apply  
for patents, so Whitney received  
credit for the invention of the  
cotton gin.  

After learning to read and write, she  
helped establish schools and educational rights for women and  
then passed laws to rid the islands of the abuses of the  
traders, who brought drunkenness,  
venereal disease, and sexual  
exploitation of the women. A  
major figure in Hawaiian history,  
Kaahumanu is an outstanding example of a woman who used her  
position to secure rights for women.  

Liz, Mitzi, Christie, and Lee,  
members of the singing group,  
WHITE RICE, will again be per-  
forming contemporary harmony  
at EVERYWOMAN'S COFFEEHOUSE.  

Mary Goddard  
1736 - 1816, USA.  

In 1775, Goddard became the  
publisher and manager of Balti-  
more's first newspaper. Her  
press printed the Declaration  
of Independence. Appointed by  
Benjamin Franklin as Postmis-  
tress of the country, she was  
later replaced by a man. Goddard  
complained to the government,  
but her complaint was ignored  
and the job declared "too stren-  
uous" for women.  

Théroigne de Méricourt  
fl. 1789, France  

On July 14, 1789, the French  
celebrated the storming of the  
Bastille, which signaled the  
outbreak of the Revolution.  
Although it is a documented fact  
that Méricourt led the assault,  
her name is usually left out of  
history.  

Sometime this month, call  
the Women's Center for specifics.  

Babe Didrikson  
1914 - 1956, USA  

Considered the world's great-  
est woman athlete, Didrikson set  
world records in the 1932  
Olympics and won gold medals in  
the javelin throw and the 80  
meter hurdle. She was a member  
of the Amateur Athletic Union's  
All-American women's basketball  
team and once scored 106  

Hannah Adams  
1755 - 1831, USA  

With the publication of her  
History of the Jews, in 1812,  
Adams became the first female  
historian in the United States  
and the first American woman to  
support herself by writing.  

In the thirties and forties, she  
concentrated on golf and won  
seventeen consecutive profession-  
al tournaments and every impor-  
tant title for women golfers.  
In addition, she swam, boxed,  
and played tennis, billiards,  
football, and baseball. She  
was said to have once struck out  
Joe DeMaggio. After recovering  
from a major operation for cancer,  
she won the National Women's  
Open Golf Tournament in 1954,  
but died two years later at the  
age of 42.  

Amelia Earhart  
1898 - 1937, USA  

Earhart's pioneering efforts  
in aviation were intended to  
improve the industry as well as  
to create opportunities for  
women in this new field. In  
1936, she embarked on an  
around-the-world flight.  
Throughout the journey, she  
documented the effects of pro-  
longed air travel on the human  
body, conducted mechanical  
tests on the aircraft, and re-  
corded her observations on the  
lives of women in the countries  
where she stopped. It is be-  
lieved that her plane went down  
in the Pacific Ocean, and no  
trace of her has been found.  
Before she left she wrote,  
"Women must try to do the  
things men have tried. When  
they fail, their failure must  
be but a challenge to others."  

Kaahumanu  
1772 - 1832, Hawaii  

In Hawaii by the eighteenth  
century, women's freedom was  
severely restricted by the  
"kapus," or taboos, of the  
religion. Women were segre-  
gated from men and certain  
foods forbidden them. When  
Kaahumanu, the first female  
ruler and lawmaker, took power,  
she abolished these practices.  
After her husband, King Kamehameha I, died, she dressed in  
warrior's clothing and announced  
to her son, who was heir to the  
throne, that his father wished  

Marie Stopes  
1880 - 1958, England  

Developed and perfected one  
of the most effective means of  
contraception - the diaphragm.  

JOIN THE YWCA  

Take my hand through eternity,  
as we breathe deeply from each  
other's dreams.  

Be with me and me with you.  

Molly Dee  
c. 1981  

I love you in the moonlight.  
I'm inspired by your dreams of  
love and life.  
I am by you, with you, in you.  

Once I looked up, and the moon  
was gone.  
Hidden behind some clouds, I  
presumed,  
I loved you in the dark.  
The love I felt is far more  
beautiful  
than all these eyes ever met.
