Hawaiian Women at Greatest Risk for  
Lung Cancer

Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian women who  
smoke cigarettes have three times the  
lung cancer rate of Japanese women who  
smoke. This and other information on  
cancer rates for Hawaiians, Japanese,  
Caucasians, and Filipinos are listed in  
a fact sheet recently released by the  
Hawaii Cancer Information Service.

Other comparisons in the fact  
sheet include the following:

- Filipinos, both women and men, are  
the least likely to get cancer.  
- Hawaiian women lead all groups in  

breast and genital cancer, and Cauca-  
sian women have the second highest  
rates.

- The breast cancer rate for Japanese  
women is half that of Hawaiians and  
Caucasians, but twice that of Filipinas.

Particular ethnic groups may run a  
greater risk of getting certain types  
of cancer because of their lifestyles,  
including smoking and eating habits.

The fact sheets are available from  
the Hawaii Cancer Information Service  
by calling 524-1234. Callers will be  
able to find out if they are in a high-  
risk group and what preventive measures  
they can take.

Equal Rights Amendment Reintroduced  
in the Senate

Senator Spark Matsunaga (D-Hawaii)  
yesterday joined Senator Edward M.  
Kennedy (D-Mass.) and 15 other sena-  
tors in sponsoring the Equal Rights  
Amendment.

The measure, Senate Joint Resolu-  
tion 10, is expected to gain the sup-  
port of a majority of the Senate. It  
was referred for consideration to the  
Senate Judiciary Committee, where a  
series of hearings was held during the  

the Constitution.

First proposed in 1921 by Alice Paul,  
a suffragist and founder of the Nation-  
al Women's Party, the Equal Rights  
Amendment to the Federal Constitution  
would add the following language:

"Equal rights under the law shall  
not be denied on account of sex."

Although it was viewed by many  
suffragists as a logical outcome of the  
move to grant suffrage to women, Con-  

gress did not act on the proposed new  
constitutional amendment until 1972  
when it was passed and sent to the  
states for ratification. The state of  
Hawaii was first to ratify the pro-  
posed new amendment, acting only hours  
after the U.S. Congress, and prompting  
Matsunaga, a leading proponent and co-  
sponsor of the 1972 measure, to call  
the 50th State "Number One in Equal  
Rights."

By 1979, when the  
imposed deadline for  
expired, 35 states had ratified the mea-  
sure--three short of the required 38.  
Congress then extended the deadline  
for another three years, until 1982.  
Upon expiration of the extension, a new  
resolution with the identical language  
was introduced in Congress.

"Although vastly increased numbers  
of women are working outside the home  
today, pay discrimination is still with  
us," Matsunaga said. "Moreover, the  
efforts of women to move into better  
paying sectors of the economy are often  
frustrated by sex discrimination. Women  
continue to be discriminated against  
in nearly all professions.

"Elder women and female heads of  
households are hard hit by discrimination. The average  
female head of a household in 1983 had  
an annual income of $11,000, compared  
to $20,000 for the average male in a  
single parent household, and nearly  
half the children in female-headed  
households live in poverty. The situ-  
ation is equally desperate for elderly  
women whose median income is about  
$5,000 per year," said Matsunaga.

In joining his colleagues in the  
reintroduction of the Equal Rights  
Amendment, Matsunaga observed that  
despite the great progress women have  
made toward legal and economic equality  
during the last decade, much remains to  
be done.

Ginni Clemmens Here in April

Ginni Clemmens, one of a very few  
women banjo pickers, is coming to  
Honolulu in April. She first picked  
up her banjo as a therapist for  
emotionally disturbed children. It  
was through doing music for children  
that Clemmens realized the power of  
music for healing and relaxing.

Clemmens has been a staple of the  
Chisago acoustic music scene for  
years and was known in the 1960s  
for her interpretations of urban  

albums which cover a range of folk  

songs, blues, jazz, ballads, women's  
and children's music.

Emergency Police Signs Available

Concern for the personal safety of  
drivers, particularly women and senior  
citizens, has prompted an organization,  
We Are Against Assault and Rape  
(W.A.A.A.R.), to manufacture police  
signal signs for emergencies. The  
plastic banners say "Please Call Police"  
in large, bright letters and can be  
attached to the car's rear window.  
W.A.A.A.R advises drivers to stay with  
their disabled cars, lock doors, roll  
up windows except for a crack, and  
wait for police. The signs are meant  
to signal for help and deter trouble-  
makers while awaiting assistance.

The signs are available at the Sex  
Abuse Treatment Center, Richards St.,  
YWCA, and University YWCA for a small  
charge.
