reminds me that I am creating my world  
happy or sad. No one is "doing it to  
me." Sometimes I choose to be sad or  
sulky. I'm in charge.  

One of the few rules in our family  
is, "If you can't say something nice,  
say nothing at all." This applies to  
people as well as to life situations.  
Fault-finding or beauty-finding is a  
habit, a state of mind.  

Loving is acknowledging "beingness,"  
giving each other space to grow. I  
welcome my children from the moment of  
conception. I fully believe that they  
receive this message in the uterus.  
Once they emerge I keep telling them  
how great they are forever after. I  
mean it! My pictures reflect this  
true acceptance.  

This series of portraits of making  
love with the universe begins with the  
striking image of a mother with child.  
She is joyful about her pregnancy  
and wants to record those precious  
times of expectation and excitement.

Life must go on! I am filled with  
fear for our beautiful human race. Are  
we not the only species that kills off  
one another? And not for food but for  
petty pride, ideology, ego. When I was  
handing out peace leaflets against the  
bomb at Waikiki on Palm Sunday, a smug  
young man responded, "I don't need your  
peace. I take care of nuclear war-  
heads." Over 3,000 nuclear bombs may  
be stored on Oahu (which the Navy nei-  
ther confirms nor denies).  

By sharing our fears about the sur-  
vival of the planet, we can reinforce

one another for right action. We need  
to listen to disillusionment but not  
dwell on it. We cannot permit each  
other to slip into negative thoughts.  
This is the ultimate test of our nur-  
turing role as women: to save the pla-  
net.  

Together we can heal our sense of  
separation and powerlessness. I be-  
lieve that is the aim of this paper.  
Thank you for inviting me to join  
hands with you in living the concept  
“Peace begins with me." Men and wo-  
men of all races and persuasions, we  
are ONE!
