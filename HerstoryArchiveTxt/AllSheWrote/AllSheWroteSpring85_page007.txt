Poetry

The Women Are No Longer Weeping  
by Kathryn Takara  

The women are no longer weeping  
And where is the wailing gone?  
Listen.  

Gleefully consorting  

Discovered through sphinx-like suffering  
Alternative possibilities  

The women are no longer weeping.  

Leaping and poised  
in poppy fields of new being.  

Which arise as a torch  
in the full-moon night.  

Letter to Alex  
by Sita  

After a while you learn  
the subtle difference  
Between holding a hand  
and chaining a soul  

And you learn that  

love doesn't mean leaning  

and company doesn't mean security  
And you begin to learn  

that kisses are not contracts  

and presents are not promises  

And you begin to accept defeats  
with your head up and your eyes  
ahead—with the grace of a woman  
not the grief of a child  

And you will learn to build all  
your roads on today  

because tomorrow's ground is too  
uncertain for plans  

falling down in mid-flight.  
After a while you learn  
that even sunshine burns  
if you ask too much.  

So you plant your own garden  
And decorate your own soul  

instead of waiting for someone to  
bring you flowers.  
And you learn  
That you really can endure  
You really are strong  
And you really do have worth
