WOMEN AND MUSIC

WHO TOOK THE MUSIC AWAY FROM  
WOMEN? and, WHO WILL BRING IT BACK?”

-CHERI A. EIR

There have been many times when fa-  
tigue or frustration made me feeble,  
and I toyed with giving it up. But  
then, somebody said they heard the  
show and liked it, or an artist  
dropped me a short letter of "Hooray,"  
and I knew I was making a very old  
dream come true.

Part of the dream is community in-  
volvement...do you like the interviews?  
or do you feel that they intrude? the  
diversity? the connecting-news? Is  
there something more that you wish I  
would start doing? Are you holding an  

Women have been making music and  
song probably for as long as they have  
been making fire.

And, as in most work of women borne,  
their music is distinguished by its  
beauty wrapped in strength and by its  
intimate insight stated honestly.

But women's music has not often  
been allowed to remain itself and re-  
main easily accessible at the same  
time.

Our oppressors have decided in  
their collective cerebrum-carrying-  
cocks wisdom that women's music  
doesn't sell, and so they don't sell  
it.

I find this alarming for many rea-  
sons. I feel that my many talented  
friends with the courage and convic-  
tion to create women's music ought not  
to be perpetually shunned for their  
hard work.

Beyond that, I've felt the surge of  
strength and bonding that springs from  
sharing a straightforward song. I've  
also felt weakness, fragmentation, and  
frustration. A women's music session,  
preferably live, is the surest way of  
moving beyond that.

Music of women borne shoots  
straight up into the promising sky as  
a circle of light, a tower of fortifi-  
cation, and a magical mirror.

album you'd really like me to play?  
Can we continue to connect and help  
each other?

My Program Director says she has re-  
ceived three letters praising my show:  
that is so good of my listeners--Yeah!

Unfortunately, it was not good,  
enough to keep her from shortening my  
show by 30 minutes, or by about eight  
songs each week.

My 90-day trial period lasts until  
May 20th, 1983. When the station goes  
from 10 to 100 Watts of transmitter  
power, (sometime this year), a second  
trial period can be anticipated as the  
show is newly heard by many who can  
easily ignore it now.

I want to thank kindly all of you  

BEE Cc us ome S mu c to protest: ae -  
to celebrate; to re-educate, to re-en-  
power, and to reconnect. We can use  
women's music to intermingle spirits  
and to touch the silkiness of our  
shared being, when I embrace womankind.  
I hope that I and my show can  
return and re-spark that same sense of  
strength. Let there be for us  
both a sea of soundtracks of infinite  
generation.  
I will answer each and every letter  
I receive of feedback from my listen-  
ers. SEND TO: Cheri A. Eir, the NO
