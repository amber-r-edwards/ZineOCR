JULY/AUGUST ALL SHE WROTE PAGE 17

EMILY DICKINSON ON NATURE

I'd like to thank LaRene Despain,  
UH English professor, for encouraging  
me to write and for sensitively teach-  
ing skills that enabled me to write  
better. In the process I discovered  
Emily Dickinson. While the poems here  
are about Nature, she also wrote touch-  
ingly about women as women. "I'm Wife"  
and "She Rose To His Requirement" from  
Selected Poems & Letters of Emily Dick-  
inson question why women automatically  
fall into the role of wife. Emily  
wrote ‘ahead of her time.' We can  
identify with her now in our time.

Emily Dickinson's poetry reflects  
her spectrum of feelings towards Na-  
ture. She sees Nature as an assassin  
who indiscriminately “beheads it (a  
flower) at its play In accidental pow-  
er." Nature, to her, is also an art-  
ist creating a landscape as in the  
poem, "It sifts from leaden sieves."  
And Nature is the habitat for her inti-  
mate companions; insects, flowers and  
snakes, for example. Through her poe-  
try, we are able to experience Na-  
ture's moods.

Apparently with no surprise

To any happy flower,

The frost beheads it at its play

In accidental power.

The blond assassin passes on,  
The sun proceeds unmoved

To measure off another day  
For an approving God.

In this poem, "the blond assassin  
jeanne coiaianl ois bias sun Pro  
nioved. measure off Scare pt For an approv-  
ing God." Death is dealt out matter-  
of-factly; God approves. God is shown  
as a cruel God, not the loving God we  
usually think of. The tone of this  
poem is indignant. Emily feels angry  
and alienated from this unfeeling Na-  
ture.

I know a place where summer strives

with such a practised frost,

She each year leads her daisies

back,  
Recording briefly, "Lost."

But when the south wind stirs the  
pools

And struggles in the lanes,

Her heart misgives her for her vow,

And she pours soft refrains

Into the lap of adamant,  
And spices, and the dew,

That stiffens quietly to quartz,  
Upon her amber shoe.

Again we read of frost but this  
time with a gently, harmonious tone.  
Here Emily is more accepting of Nature  
as death-dealer. The "place" is a  
cold, dark glen where even a daisy is  
"Lost." Spring can thaw pools, "And  
she pours soft refrains" into this  
spot, too, but to no avail. The hard  
rock, "adamant", spices and dew, "stif-  
fens quietly to quartz." "Quietly to  
quartz" means whitened (killed) by  
frost but quietly killed not violently  
beheaded. And “amber" shoe conveys  
'preserved for eternity'; dead, but  
not gone.

It sifts from leaden sieves,

It powders all the wood,

It fills with alabaster wool

The wrinkles of the road.

It makes an even face

Of mountain and of plain,--  
Unbroken forehead from the east  
Unto the east again.

It reaches to the fence,  
It wraps it, rail by rail,  
Till it is lost in fleeces;  
It flings a crystal veil.

On stump and stack and stem,--  
The summer's empty room,

Acres of seams where harvest were,  
Recordless, but for them.

It ruffles wrists of posts,  
As ankles of a queen, ~~

Denying they have been.

Nature as artist is beautifully des-  
cribed here. "It" is snow. The poem  
follows the progress of a snowstorm  
covering the land. "Leaden sieves" is  
the winter sky. Reference to "alabas-  
ter", "fleeces" and "ghosts" fills the  
reader's eyes with the whiteness of  
snow. The smoothness snow lends to a  
landscape is shown by phrases and  
words such as, “even face", “Unbroken",  
"fills", "wraps" and "flings a crystal  
veil." "Recordless" succinctly des-  
cribes the plight of objects in a snow-  
storm and you can feel the muffledness  
and immobility left afterwards in  
"stills its artisans like ghosts, Deny-  
ing they have been."

The language of this poem is gentle.  
Nature, the artist, covers her canvas  
completely without harming any inhabi-  
tants. I can picture Emily lovingly  
observing this scene she has shown to  
us.

How the old mountains drip with sun-  
set,  
And the brake of dun!  
How the hemlocks are tipped in tin-  
sil  
By the wizard sun!  
How the old steeples hand the scar-  
let,  
Till the ball is full,--  
Have I the lip of the flamingo  
That I dare to tell?

how the fire ebbs like bil-  
lows,  
Touching all the grass  
With a departing, sapphire feature,  
As if a duchess pass!

Then,

How a small dusk crawls on the vil-  
lage ~  
Till the houses blot;  
And the odd flambeaux no men carry  
Glimmer on the spot!

Now it is night in nest and kennel,  
And where was the wood,

Just a dome of abyss is nodding  
Into solitude!--

These are the visions baffled Guido;  
Titian never told;

Domenichino dropped the pencil,  
Powerless to unfold.

This landscape poem depicts Nature  
turning day to night. “How the old  
mountains drip with sunset," releases  
the sunset into action as if it were a  
pail of paint spilling onto the Earth.  
The sun sinks lower, "Touching all the grass  
With a departing, sapphire feature."

The light fades as "dusk crawls on  
the village" until "the houses blot."

Night has arrived. "And where was the  
wood, Just a dome of abyss." “Dome of  
abyss" is a good play on words as a  
dome is high and an abyss deep. The  
forest is now seen in silhouette, high,  
deep and dark. "nodding Into soli-  
tude!" No one's going there now, too  
scary!

These phrases in the last stanza  
show Man unable to fathom or record  
this glorious miracle: "Visions baf-  
fled", "never told", and "Domenichino  
dropped the pencil, Powerless to un-  
fold." Even Emily asks, (do) “I dare  
to tell?" But she wielded her pencil  
successfully. She knew intimately the  
sunset. Her description reflects the  
many colors seen and the play of sun-  
light fading away as well as the awe  
people feel at this sight. The tone  
of this poem is excited, several  
lines end with exclamation points.
