Honolulu artist, photographer, and
humanitarian Carla Annette didn't plan
to go to China that week. Luckily she
did anyway. Now she shares with us
her story and pictures—"Faces of
China."

Don't cherish more than you can

carry easily

CHENZS

is a tapestry of
people's faces woven inextricably with
faces of pagodas and palaces. I send
these photos out into the world to re-
mind all of us of the common bonds
that bind us together as human beings.
Let us hold hands around the globe and
know that we are one.
