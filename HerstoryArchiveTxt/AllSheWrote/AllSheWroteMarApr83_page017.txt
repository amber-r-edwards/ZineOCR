SURVEY

Local Working  
Women  

Working Women of Hawaii formulated  
a questionnaire and in cooperation with  
the Affirmative Action Office distributed  
8,500 surveys. The surveys were  
distributed by 35 volunteers in 20  
work locations on Oahu over a period  
of 2 days beginning April 21, 1982, Na-  
tional Secretary's Day. The surveys  
were collected in boxes set up in the  
downtown Mall area and by mail.  
Four hundred thirty-eight surveys  
were returned to Working Women.  
When tabulation began it was decided  
to use only the 416 questionnaire res-  
pondents who indicated they were fe-  
male. This was done mainly to facili-  
tate the compilation of the data.  

Compiling the data was difficult  
and time-consuming. After many volun-  
teer hours the basic survey figures  
were completed and published in our  
Sept-Dec 1982 Newsletter. A news con-  
ference was held at this time and some  
of the basic results were released.  

The data is interesting and exten-  
sive. One of the most striking fea-  
tures about the survey was how closely  
Hawaii's statistics follow the main-  
land except that the pay for people in  
similar categories is lower in Hawaii.

FEMINIST RESEARCH  

Finding HERstory  

I often wonder if the feminist  
community is aware of the rich resources  
available at UH's Hamilton Library.  
The reference collection alone would  
be worth knowing about. Many of the  
reference works are geared towards  
academic women's studies interests,  
from guides such as Doing Feminist  
Research edited by Helen Roberts  
(Libraries Unlimited, 1979) to  
bibliographies like Esther Steineman's  
Women's Studies: A Recommended Core  
Bibliography (Routledge and Kegan,  
Paul, 1981). A reference guide can  
also offer a special topic, as  
does Katherine Fishburn's Women  
In Popular Culture (Greenwood Press,  
1982). Fishburn's guide provides  
essays on a variety of subjects,  
including women in popular literature,  
women in film, and women in tele-  
vision. Each essay concludes with a  
brief bibliography to lead you to  
further reading; in addition Fishburn  
lists relevant periodicals, bibliogra-  
phies and information guides.

Another helpful tool is a bibliography of bibliographies, which offers a wide range of subject guides. Patricia K. Ballow's Women: A Bibliography of Bibliographies (GK Hall, 1980) assembles bibliographies published from 1970-1979 and annotates each citation. She has arranged the bibliographies by geographical and topical subjects (history, literature, economics, sociology, etc.). The Hamilton staff has noted call numbers of each bibliography in the library making it very easy to track down a reading list of works on your particular subject.  

The reference section also contains handbooks, almanacs, and directories. The Women's Annual: The Year in Review (GK Hall) 1981 edition contains essays on women and education, women and health, Third World Women in America, politics and law, among other topics. The essays conclude with a bibliography and list of organizations. Nineteen eighty-one was a rough year for women as programs faced funding cuts - the Women's Annual explains just what  

Have you been passed over for a promotion given to a man with less experience?  
41) Have you ever been denied a promotion you deserved?  
42) Is there discrimination in your company?  
Race  

40) Does your company have an affirmative action plan?  

Another helpful resource is Feminist Quotations by Carol McPhee and Ann Fitzgerald (Crowell, 1977). The compilers covered 200 years worth of women's writing to obtain the quotations on marriage, economy, sisterhood, politics, and other topics. A subject index enables the reader to pick appropriate quotes for a speech or article. I browsed through the education section and found words which delighted me: "Educated women have shown a tendency to raise questions rather than children."  

(Elizabeth Hawes, Anything But Love, 1928).  

No discussion of feminist reference works is complete without Women Studies Abstracts. Although you can find women's topics in abstracts and indexes in every discipline, this quarterly service draws together citations from scholarly journals and feminist periodicals. Women Studies Abstracts is arranged by topic and has a subject index.
