WILD WOMEN DON’T

On Friday April 8, 1983, recording
artist Ginni Clemmens gave a joyful
and exciting concert to a standing-
room-only crowd at Everywoman's Coffee-
house.

With her pulsating and bluesy rendi-
tion of Ida Cox's "Wild Women Don't
Get the Blues", Ginni set a tone for
the evening of uninhibiting hootin'
and blues-shoutin' sing-alongs.

There were also songs full of ten-
derness and thoughtfulness such as
Ginni's beautifully done version of
Ferron's "Testimony", with its haunt-
ing chorus.

"By our lives be we spirit
our hearts be we women
our eyes be we open
our heads be we whole..."
three characteristics that make
Ms. Clemmens something special in this
reviewer's opinion are her voice, her
charisma, and her lack of dogmatic ex-
clusiveness.

ALL SHE WROTE

GET THE BLUES

-CHERI A. EIR

Ginni's voice and full Chicago
blues sound reminded me of Anita O'Day
at times, and of my childhood's steady
diet of St. Louis blues at others; es-
pecially at those times in which she
hit one of her crystal clear high
notes. Ah...hang on to your chair...

And all of this talent is packed
inside a mother-earthy 47 year old wo-
man of such sincerity and generosity
that there were three encores to
stretch the glow of the starlit even-
ing ever farther into our night.

Ginni is gay, and while both she
and her special guest, 84 year old
Merle the Pearl, rightfully and proudly
performed their songs about coming out,
the issues, and the lingo of lesbian-
ism, they also felt comfortable in wel-
coming a large crowd containing a mul-
tiplicity of personal choices.

Radical lesbian separatists shared
their concert space with straights,
faggots, feminists, middle-of-the-road
dykes, and heterosexual families hold-
ing small children. All seemed to
sense a transitory shadowing of the to-
the-trenches divisiveness that takes
over often in the outside world.

One of Ginni's earlier albums is
called "Gay and Straight Together",
I'm wondering if she hasn't in fact
been pioneering the work that is now
going on to teach us to celebrate our
differences and make a safe place for
many; the kind of work one hears
about in Holly Near's new song, "Uni-
ty", based

Ginni's own songs such as “Solid
Ground" and "Long Time Friends", fill
you up with self-recognition and
strength; she knows you it seems. Ms.
Clemmens' music makes sense out of a
lot of stray thought that only
seemed to scatter or confuse you be-
fore you heard her melodic and sensi-
ble thoughts on the subjects.

All in all, Ginni Clemmens is the
kind of strong, sturdy, and all-at-
once sensitive woman that you just
know you would like to pass many re-
laxed evenings of soulful conversation
with.

And that maybe is what singing the
blues is all about, all of your crazy/
needy/funny/and scary-loving feelings
find a safe place to be shared, in
song.
