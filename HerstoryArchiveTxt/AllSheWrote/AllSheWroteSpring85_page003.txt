Women's History

The National Women's History Project

The National Women's History Project, a non-profit educational corporation, encourages the multi-cultural awareness of women's history in schools and communities across the country. Their Women's History Network connects over 200 individuals and groups interested in women's history; and their Women's History Resource Service offers educational materials about women in history, both in the United States and internationally.

The Project actively promotes Women's History Week because it is a time when “women are honored who have participated in history by living out their lives, whether in ways grandly eloquent or steadfastly ordinary, and by so doing have contributed to our shared history." They also celebrate International Women's Day, which always falls within Women's History Week, recognizing the contributions of women in organized labor.

Foundation for Hawaii Women's History, Inc.

Established in 1983, the Foundation for Hawaii Women's History, Inc., a local, non-profit organization, seeks recognition of the accomplishments of women in history. Its goal is "to redress the balance of people's awareness of the mutual contributions of women and men in our history." Year-round activities, culminating in the Women's History Week celebration, are promoted by the Foundation.

Two publications were printed last year by the Foundation's Historian's Committee. "The Changing Lives of Hawaii's Women" is a compilation of articles focusing on the changing status of women; women in politics, education, work, law, and the arts; and "famous firsts" for women in Hawaii. An annotated guide to sources of information in Hawaii, "The Written Record of Hawaii's Women," lists selected materials about women in Hawaii's history, including publications, reports, manuscripts, oral history tapes and transcripts, and newsletters.

The two publications come with membership in the Foundation for Hawaii Women's History, Inc. Dues are $10 for individuals and $25 for organizations. For more information, write to the Foundation for Hawaii Women's History, Inc., P.O. Box 3371, Honolulu, Hawaii 96801.

Black Women Oral History Project

Over 75 Black women who improved the quality of life for Blacks in America have been interviewed for the Black Women Oral History Project of Radcliffe College. A cross section of Black women, 70 years of age and older, were selected on the basis of their work as professionals or community volunteers. Interviewed were national figures such as Rosa Parks whose arrest for refusing to give up her bus seat to a White passenger triggered the massive Montgomery bus boycott in the 1950s, as well as lesser-known women who fought for social change in their own communities.

The YWCA figured prominently in the lives of a number of women interviewed. Olivia Pearl Stokes, educator and Baptist minister, recalled a lesson learned as a young woman:

"I was civic minded and curious as a person. One day I went down to Radio City, just as a citizen, to enjoy entertainment, and saw a minstrel show. I came back that evening to work... and wrote a letter to the manager of Radio City pro- (continued on page 6)
