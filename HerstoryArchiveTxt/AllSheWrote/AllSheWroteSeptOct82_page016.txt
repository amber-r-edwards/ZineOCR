Jesus Saves

Jesus saves they tell me.

Saves what?

Trading stamps? Bubble gum cards?

Used tennis shoes? Praise the Lord!

I saw the vile darkness of my soul

and was horrified. - Amen

I heard children screaming, "Mommy,
Mommy." As their bloodied crumpled
bodies were dragged from the rubble

of bombed schoolhouses.

Ah, Yes, Oh Lord, 'tis a cruel and
unusual punishment to place us

here again.

Repent! Repent!

You missed the mark. Sinned against
God and Man, or perhaps the god in

your man.

Did you deny yourself meat and fish and
fowl to become pure?

Has it really helped?

Hitler was a vegetarian. He harnessed
the powers of evil and people followed
because it "felt good."

Jim Jones spoke truths to

rebellious souls starved for hope

and equality. "I love you," he sneered,
“They are the enemy. We are the

chosen people."

"Do you believe the Bible is
the word of God?" questioned the
jawed Jehovah Witness.

"Yes, but it was interpreted by man,
and man is fallible. God is not so
petty as to answer to only one correct
name." I have endured the Sunday
hypocrites, born again schizoids.

I want God in my life. Life in my God.
I admit I need help.
One night I prayed for a "sign."

A flash of white light blazed across
my closed eyes. It terrified me.

It was my neighbor's car headlights.

the
tense

"I cried for people believed 'lost',
only to see them transformed, clean and
whole. Self-righteously forcing my
will upon those I considered less,

I tried to lead the way, teach them truth,

Reveal them to themselves.
-A Jesus Complex-
What is the purpose of it all?
To love.
Why bother?

Coffee House Blues

There was I at the coffee house.....swept in on a wave from Hilo.

So many women, surrounding, caressing....I could hardly stop from reeling.

Circling around, their stamping ground, my eyes were drawn.....

To one who understood my feelings.

She was alone, so desperately alone.....

I knew this one also needed healing.

So I walked up slowly and sat right down, and commenced to
"Well Hi!" I resound - "You live here?"

"And what if I do! What's it to you!"

Taken aback, I stutter "I care! By the Goddess I care!”
We've both been alone, though surrounded by crones;

And still felt that unknown, unloved feeling.

fumble around...

People like us fall into cracks and get swallowed like snacks,

Or we fall in together, with comments on the weather

Until we both stand shining, unbelievably shining,

So when we walk from the coffee house away from our crones
We glow in our bones, turning together into the night...
Forgetting those lonely, sucker blues to

Stalk out into the night now too... incredibly shining!

I cannot do it alone.

a Good News

The Family Crisis Shelter in Hilo
has been awarded a two-year grant
through the National Coalition Against
Domestic Violence (NCADV) from the
Ford Foundation to develop a nursery
business specializing in house plants.

The grant of $25,000 annually for
two years, was one of three awarded
nationwide. The Family Crisis Shel-
ter's proposal was the top contender
of applicants from all over the coun-
try.

The NCADV was established in 1978
to provide leadership in developing a
feminist model for programs working to
help women who have been battered, and
to provide a national communication
and sharing network among all grass-
roots battered women's shelters,

groups, organizations and individual
workers.

The Family Crisis Shelter has been
an NCADV member since 1979. The
announcement of the grant was received
on July 7th, the Shelter's fourth
birthday.

The proposal for the nursery pro-
vides for two employees and job
training for twelve women over a
twelve-month period. "We want to be
able to provide job training to women
who are using or have used the Shel-
ter's services to prepare them for the
labor market," said Beverly Mesch,
President of the Board of Directors of
the Shelter. The nursery will also
eventually provide another source of
income for the financially struggling
Shelter.
