How Safe Are Tampons?

Did you know that there are no  
uniform regulations or tests to  
determine the safety and effective-  
ness of tampons?  

Tampon manufacturers are using  
new materials in recent years in  
their products. At the same time,  
we are discovering problems associ-  
ated with them, including vaginal  
sores and more serious problems  
like Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS),  
which still continues to strike wom-  
en.  

Tampon Standards  

In 1981, the Food and Drug Ad-  
ministration (FDA) requested that  
the tampon manufacturers, consumer  
groups (we are one of six), and  
other interested parties write a  
tampon standard. All of us have  
been meeting every six to eight  
weeks, but progress has been slow.  
Consumers and manufacturers are  
still at loggerheads on crucial is-  
sues. This is a brief report to  
alert women to the issues we as con-  

industry is unwilling to agree to.  
The major areas are:  

Absorbency may be a central safe-  
ty factor; lower absorbency tampons  
are implicated in fewer cases of  

TSS and other problems. Although a  
test for absorbency appears to have  
been worked out, there is no agree-  
ment on how to report absorbency  

on tampon boxes. At present, the  
terms “regular,” “super,” and  

“super plus” mean something differ-  
ent for each brand, and in some  
cases, one brand's regular is more  
absorbent than another's super.  
These terms must be standardized.  
Because these categories are broad,  
we want, in addition, a more specif-  
ic absorbency rating within each  
category so women can choose the low-  
est absorbency they need.  

We want comprehensive testing of  
the effects of tampons and tampon  
ingredients on living tissue (bio-  
compatibility). A variety of tests  
is needed to measure such things as  
irritation, drying, tissue injury,  
the effects of repeated long-term  
use, toxicity, and carcinogenicity.  
The tests proposed by industry do not  
go far enough.  

Tests to measure large chunks  
(fragments) and tiny pieces (par-  
ticulates) of fiber that come off  
of the tampon are necessary. We do  
not yet know the range of problems  
that pieces of tampons may cause  
when they are left behind in the  
vagina.  

ALL SHE WROTE  

“200 billion times more absorbent  
than regular tampons...”  

We need tests to discover what  
living microorganisms (bacteria and  
spores) are present on tampons  

purchased in stores.  

Manufacturers will reveal only  
the main ingredients in tampons  
and refuse to state what they use  
for binders, lubricants, perfumes,  
etc. We want comprehensive ingre-  
dient labeling as well as tests to  
identify substances which can leach  
out of the tampons during normal  
use.  

Specific and precise cautions  
about possible tampon-related  
health problems in addition to Tox-  
ic Shock Syndrome must be included  
on the package label. Dismissing  
the evidence of women's experience  
and government reports, industry  
wants the warnings to be as vague  
as possible and relegated prima-  
rily to the insert.  

The package label should state  
that the tampons are not sterile  
to correct the common assumption  
that because tampons are individ-  
ually wrapped they have been  
sterilized.  

This would be a voluntary non-  
governmental standard, followed  
at the discretion of the manufac-  
turers. The only way we know if  
the manufacturers are following it  
is to require them to state so on  
the label. If the product says it  
meets the standard and doesn't, the  
company can be charged with mis-  
branding.  

The results of tests required by  
the standard must be available to  

SPRING 1985  

independent researchers and the pub-  
lic. Tampon companies are not re-  
quired to and refuse to divulge any  
of their test data, preventing us  
from setting meaningful requirements  
in several areas.  

The FDA plays a crucial role in  
influencing the manufacturers.  
Right now the FDA representative  
seems primarily interested in a  
standard that addresses absorbency  
testing and absorbency labeling in  
some way but does not include any  
of the other controversial areas.  
The consumer representatives be-  
lieve that we need a comprehensive  
standard. We see no evidence that  
other requirements would be added  
in the future if a partial standard  
covering absorbency were written  
now. It seems that the FDA may be  
seeking quick results at the ex-  
pense of a standard addressing the  
broad range of safety and effec-  
tiveness issues for tampons.  

Without strong public outcry now  
there will not be a satisfactory  
tampon standard. Please WRITE TO  
THE FDA urging support of the con-  
sumer position. The FDA does  
respond to letters. Pressure from  
women consumers was an important  
factor influencing the FDA to clas-  
sify tampons as medical devices a  
few years ago. Make your letter  
as brief or as detailed as you  
wish. You could say simply: We  

are concerned about the safety of  

tampons and want the FDA to sup-  
port the position of consumer  

groups regarding the development of  
voluntary standards for tampons.  
Please send us a copy of whatever  
you send to the FDA.  

Reporting Problems  

Another way you can help make  
tampons safer in the future is to  
report any problems you have had  
with tampons to the FDA, which  
maintains a publicly available  
file for each kind of medical de-  
vice. These Device Experience  
Network (DEN) reports have been  
an invaluable aid to consumer  
representatives in finding evi-  
dence of problems such as vagi-  
nal sores, allergic reactions,  
irritation, unusual bleeding, in-  
fections, fragmentation, foreign  
material in tampons, and injur-  
ies from inserters. All you have  
to do is write a letter including  
your name and address (which is  
kept confidential), the brand and  
type of tampon (if you remember),  
and the problem(s) you experienced.  
Even if you received medical treat-  
ment, send in a report yourself.  
Most medical practitioners do not  
know about DEN reports or do not  
bother to report problems with tam-  
pons.
