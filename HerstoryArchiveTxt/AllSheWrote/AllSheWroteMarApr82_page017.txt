HONOLULU'S SEX ABUSE
TREATMENT CENTER

(Debbie Gaynor works at the Sex Abuse

Treatment Center (SATC) at Kapi-
olani Children's Medical Center.
Because of her long-term involv-
ment with the center, we request-
ed that she write about her-
story and future plans for SATC.)

Prior to the opening of the
center, services to victims were
either fragmented or non-exist-
ent. Victims were often subject-
ed to insensitive questioning
and examining by brusque per-
sonnel in overcrowded hospital
emergency rooms and cold imper-
sonal police stations. Such harsh
treatment seemed to intensify
the victim's emotional trauma. As
one victim pointed out, "....my
assault was traumatic but the
treatment I received at the hands
of professionals after reporting
was far more degrading."

On October 15, 1976, an open
house was held to celebrate the
Center's beginning.

The staff planned to make posi-
tive changes in the way rape vic-
tims would be treated. The stated
primary goal of the center at that
time was to provide comprehensive,
sensitive, and thorough medical
treatment, crisis intervention, and
legal support to all victims of

assault.

Presently, the staff, social
workers, physicians and nurses,
detectives and prosecuting at-
torneys are specially trained in
the areas of sexual assault; con-
sequently, they are more aware of
the needs and feelings of victims
and can assist them in a profes-
sional and sensitive manner.

The Center still provides round-
the-clock, sensitive, high-quality
care to victims and their families.

Since its inception, services at
the Center have been free and con-
fidential. The provision of ser-
vices, such as medical care, V.D.
testing, collection of evidence,
and counseling are not contingent
upon reporting to the police. Vic-
tims are free to decide for them-
selves what services they choose
to receive.

Through hard work and networking
with other agencies and indi-
viduals, we've attained many of
the goals and expectations that we
set when we began.

1. Continued reforms in the
rape laws.

2. Through collaboration with
Dr. Libby Ruch, Dr. Susan Chandler
and Dr. Eberhard Mann, all faculty
at the University of Hawaii, re-
search has been published about the
impact of rape and incest on
victims and how counselors might
best assist them in crisis.

3. This year, the Honolulu City
& County Prosecuting Attorney's
Office has finally begun to ini-
tiate some of our recommendations
for easing the stress victims ex-
perience as they proceed through
the criminal justice system.

3. Vertical prosecution of
rape cases by prosecutors, and
special training for them in pre-
senting evidence in court, and
the formation of the Victim Wit-
ness Kokua Center in the Prose-
cutor's Office, are some of the
gains made.

4. This year, the Honolulu
Police Department has detectives
specially trained in sexual as-
sault crimes "on-call" to in-
vestigate a report. What that
means for a rape victim is that
she/he will be assured of sensi-
tive treatment by police person-
nel if a report is made.

5. When we began providing
services, the office space where
the center is housed was a shell.
Through the contributions and
kokua of numerous private in-
dividuals, businesses, and vol-
unteer service agencies, we have
been able to design and furnish
our offices in a warm and human-
istic style. Many clients have
commented on how they've felt com-
fortable at our place.

There are other projects and
ideas we have talked about de-
veloping in the future. But,
because our funds are limited,
we are not able to expand in as

“We would like to develop more
extensively the community educ-
ation component of our program;
to reach out even more to the
community regarding our services
and also increase their awareness
of the myths and misconceptions
about rape, the victim, and the
offender. It is difficult for us
to fulfill all the requests we
receive for speaking engagements;
we therefore plan to recruit and
train volunteers to handle these
requests. Special emphasis will
be focused on prevention of sex-
ual assault of children and ad-
olescents.

We are also in the preliminary
stages of forming a Coalition of
all the sex abuse programs within
the State to provide an opportu-
nity to support each other's ef-
forts and to share expertise and
information.

Some of the work we have done
in the area of sexual assault re-
presents only small beginnings,
and others are major changes.
People often query me about the
work I do. Common questions are:
"Isn't it depressing?" or “How
do you handle it?". The work is
sometimes depressing and frustr-
ating; it is also extremely
challenging, creative, and ener-
gizing. It has been a very re-
warding personal experience to
be involved in a project that
has contributed greatly to im-
proving the status of women and
the treatment they receive in
the medical and legal systems.

wers. I'm in prison, too. If any-
one is not in this kind of prison,

then I am strongly urging them to

volunteer to work as a kind of

parole officer for the rest of us.

They could volunteer to give sem-

inars at the YWCA or something.

Obviously, no seminar is going to
solve all our problems. It could
help, but it's not a cure. So,
let's talk, leaving out sentences
like "but it's not my fault, real-
ly, if only...". There are so
many excuses disguised as reasons
for why we let others control us
that we are devoting our energy
and goals to these reasons rather
than to freeing ourselves.

Even actual ex-convicts who've
spent much of their lives in pri-
son have set-backs adjusting to
"the outside," that they find ways
to get back in. It's like the
feeling one gets on graduation day,
without a job lined up: "Where do
I go from here....?" Ever wonder
why graduate schools are so popu-
lar?

I'm not sure why we sentence our-
selves to these self-imposed pri-
sons, but I'll speculate that per-
haps they give meaning or a pur-
pose to life, especially if the
prisoner feels dispensable. In
some cases, the person thrives on
the sympathy usually afforded to
victims. It's lonely, and in
some cases, it's downright radi-
cal to give up these prisons.

Especially if we've been cap-
tive for a while. We grow accus-
tomed to them to the extent of feel-
ing secure with the arrangement. It
these situations aren't usually
supportive of self-assurance.

These prisons do, in fact, restrict
our growth potential. They close us
in with that false sense of security.
They wear down our self-esteem, moti-
vation, and initiative and keep us
from self-actualization.

If we put into a situation as
much as we expected (or wanted) to
receive from it, then we'd either:
1) get what we wanted, or 2) have
the courage to walk away from it.
In either case, we'd dispense with
the excuses.

Whatever causes these self-imposed pri-
sons is not as important as our being
aware of them and their effects on us.
Becoming aware is the first step to-
wards freedom. It is not my intention
to tell people how to live their lives,
but I would like to think I've raised
some consciousness so that people do
live their own lives.
Below, I've listed some books that may
offer some enlightenment and insight.
This list is by no means all-inclusive
or complete.
