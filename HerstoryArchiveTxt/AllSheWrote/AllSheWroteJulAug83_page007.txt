Maui’s Gay/Bi/Lesbian Community Organization  

WHO ARE MY PEOPLE?  

The 8th International Conference of  
Gay and Lesbian Jews will be held in  
Miami, Florida, August 4th through 7th.  

The word "Miami," when transliter-  
ated into Hebrew, becomes “Mi-Ami" and  
means "Who are my people?" This for-  
tunate coincidence provides a theme  
for the conference which asks “Who are  
my people?" -- as Jews, as Gays and  
Lesbians, and as responsible adults.  

This year's conference participants  
will be afforded the opportunity to  
participate in new, creative workshops,  
led by authorities from both South  
Florida and The World. “The Future of  
the Gay/Lesbian Jew in the Brave New  
World," "Tradition-the Glue that Keeps  

Us Together", and "Do Your Parents  
Know Where You Are?" are just some  
of the topics to be covered.  

A full schedule of religious serv-  
ices is planned, including: Friday  
night Shabbat dinner and services at  
Temple Israel of Greater Miami and  
Havdalah, under the stars. Addition-  
al special services have also been  
scheduled for Saturday morning.  

The South Florida Gay and Lesbian  
Community is going all out to show you  
that, "We are glad you're here.” Spe-  
cial events at the conference site,  
discounts and parties throughout town,  
and post-conference tours make this  
the perfect starting point for your  
summer vacation.  

With Miami's easy accessibility to  
Europe and Latin America, and special  
summer rates, more international parti-  
cipation is expected than ever before.  

So come to Miami in August and:  
--walk miles of our beautiful sandy  
beaches  
--stretch your mind  
--be seduced by balmy breezes and moon-  
lit nights  
--stand proudly with your Gay brothers  
and Lesbian sisters  
--disgrace yourself completely at some  
of the best bars and discos in the  
world  
--fatten your puny international ad-  
dress book  
--love and respect your Jewishness,  
your sexuality and your humanity  
--extend your vacation with our spe-  
cial tours  
--be there

OVULAR PHOTOGRAPHY  

Barbara Hammer, feminist filmmaker  
extraordinaire, will give an exciting  
film-making workshop at Rootworks, wo-  
men's land in the mountains of South-  
ern Oregon, from July 7 to July 14.  
She will teach everything a woman  
could want to know about scripting,  
sound recording, editing, use of  
stills, animation, pixillation, per-  
sonal imagery, dream shooting and medi-  
tative imagery. The workshop offers  
the special high of creative inspira-  
tion from collaborative filmmaking.  
No previous experience with film is  
necessary.  

This is an exceptional opportunity  
to work with a feminist lesbian film  
maker of great imagination and creati-  
vity. Barbara Hammer is currently on  
the faculty at SUNY in Binghamton,  
New York. She has made over 30 films.  

For the workshop, women will supply  
their film. They are also urged to  
bring 8 and super 8 movie cameras if  
they own them, and 35mm cameras for  
making stills. Some equipment will be  
supplied, including a 16mm camera and  
projector. Film shot during the work-  
shop at Rootworks will be developed  
during the week, edited and screened  
before the workshop concludes.  

For further information, including  
the cost for this filmmaking workshop,
