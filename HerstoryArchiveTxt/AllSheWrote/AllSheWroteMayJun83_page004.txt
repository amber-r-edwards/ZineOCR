WOMEN AND RELIGION

ALL SHE WROTE

WAS JESUS A FEMINIST: ESSAY IN SUPPORT *
OF AN EGALITARIAN THEOLOGY -stscex ser

For a long time I have been uneasy
about Christianity, specifically as it
related to organized Church doctrines
versus the notion of personal religion.
Inconsistencies are rampant; missing
pieces are explained away as "mysteries"
to be taken on faith; and most im-
portant for the purposes of this essay,
women are all too often seen as being
excluded from the body of theology,
whereas careful, open-minded scrutiny
sees a plethora of feminine inclusiveness.

In the great majority of the teach-
ings of Christ himself, the distortions
occurred only after his death and re-
surrection, the different interpreta-
tions all taking an exclusive point of
view. But what I have perceived about

apart from those accepted, codified
distortions: I see a man who was, in
many ways, a feminist--or even beyond
that--a transcendent personality who
minimized the significance of sexual
identity, along with race and social
class.

My fascination, even obsession,
with his life began when I was a child
in a basically half-hearted Jewish fam-
ily. We were Reform Jews and I was
not so indoctrinated that other ideas

of "religious revulsion" occurred when
I heard our portly Rabbi tell of Abra-
ham and his obedient response to a
thundering God's demand that he ritual-
ly slaughter his own young son. This
idea, even metaphorically, was diffi-
cult for me then, and now.

On the other hand, during this same
general time frame, I was exposed to
Christianity. Our parents, in an ef-
fort to keep the children busy, one sum-

mer, sent us to a nearby mild Presby-
terian church where I heard

the stories of Christ, especially as
he was personified in the roles of
shepherd, comforter, and lover of lit-
tle children. In crafts, I made a
plaster-of-paris paperweight of Christ
with his flock, which I kept for many
years. I was very taken with this gen-
tle image, and felt very guilty for
preferring him to my "own" God. Even
though the time that followed saw me
studying Hebrew and Semitic tradition
at our synagogue, I never let go of my
affectionate curiosity for this kindly
figure, this entity who radiated grace
and forgiveness. I guess I could even
say that I saw Christ in an almost sub-
lime, feminine way, antithetical to

the harsh and purely masculine god of
my father. “He can scarcely be charac-
terized in any but masculine epithets:
king, lord, master, judge, and father"
(p. 57, Pagels). Though Jesus could be
defined in these terms also, his range
is far wider. As an insecure child
lying alone in bed at night, that gra-
cious image of Jesus was far more com-
forting than the righteous, wrathful
Father. Naturally, I didn't discuss
this with anyone at the time, still
somehow believing my Rabbi, that

Christians were merely wayward and gul-
lible Jews. I recall too the words of
zealous Jewish classmates, snidely
talking of Jesus as "false prophet,"
and even “dirty rebel." It made me
feel both anxious and hypocritical.
However, I did grow out of this and
gradually discarded most of Judaistic
indoctrination.

But I still cannot align myself
with the general school of Christian
doctrine. Indeed I would never call
myself a "Christian," for many of the
same reasons that Bertrand Russell al-
so eschews such identification--though
I don't presume to place myself in his
intellectual league at this point.
Russell says in Why I am not a Chris-
tian, "I do not know that I could go
with him all the way, but I could go
with him further than most professing
Christians can" (p. 14, Russell). Of
course I am not entirely convinced by
all of Russell's arguments, and I must

made the night dark again
and the people sought the truth
because the illusion
was out of order
Everyone went to bed early

because they remembered
what it was really
all about
and they were afraid
The night was quiet
but not still
and you could feel the spirit
in the darkness
The wind blew fiercely
and shook the security
out of their hearts
and they felt ashamed
for the wrong things
they had done
As they waited

recognize his context is within the
four standard books of the New Testa-
ment. Nor do I quite buy his idea
that "All the great religions of the

world--Buddhism, Christianity, Islam

and Communism--(are) both untrue and

harmful" (p. v). For me, there is va-
lue and truth in all; my main com-
plaint is centered around the willing-
ness of people to exclude other truths
once they have adopted their own ideo-
logy. This is where damage is done and
on this point, I feel that far too ma-
ny so-called Christians, past and pre-
sent, are quite guilty.

Part of the problem stems from a
certain, very central precept inherent
in the faith, specifically, the idea
that only through Christ (and thus THE
Church) can one seek salvation and
truth. As John says, “every spirit

that confesseth not that Jesus Christ

is come in the flesh, is not of God."
I am very skeptical on this point, for
Jesus' main commandment was "that ye
love one another." If people then do
truly love, whether knowing Christ or
not, aren't they as he was? (Here I
confess even more uncertainty as
Christ also said he was not for peace
per se, but was here as “a sword"--but
that's another issue entirely.) For
myself, a true Christian is thus one
who lives by the principle of brother-
ly/sisterly love, regardless of reli-
gious affiliation.

In any case, these personal comments
are meant to serve as an introduction
for this essay, as insight into the
incentives for it, and to bring up the
critical problem of inconsistency and
oversight within the tradition and phi-
losophy of Christian faith; for I
think that women have indeed received
the short end of things from this
selective process of inconsistency,
and I believe that there is at least
some good evidence to acquit women of
their heritage of spiritual subordina-
tion.

It appears that context is a vital
issue, and this hails all the way back
to Genesis and the Garden of Eden--per-
haps even further, to before God the
Garden as the haven which a beneficent
(masculine) God created for man, and
secondarily, woman; woman thereupon,
out of weakness, betraying this kindly
God by eating of the fruit of sin and
evil (or knowledge), and in the pro-
cess staining man too with her infamy.
Or it can be seen another way, as
Pagels sets forth in The Gnostic Gos-
pels: woman is a creature of intellect
who partakes of "the principle of di-
vine wisdom" via the neighborhood ser-
pent and is expelled upon achieving
this by a God "trying jealously to pre-
vent them from attaining knowledge"
(p. xvi). How radically different
this view is from standard Judeo-Chris-
tian orthodoxy! Eve is not only vi-
sionary in this respect but she alone
(not Adam) has the wherewithal, the
courage, to defy the petty paternalism
which would keep her cloaked in ignor-
ance. Graciously, she offers this di-
vine wisdom to her man. But man is
fearful, doesn't comprehend the nature
of Eve's gift and many socio-theologi-
cal problems begin here.

There is of course the view that
goes even beyond Genesis and talks
about the Original Mother Goddess, who
is the parent of the male God who la-
ter creates earth, the garden and hu-
manity:

They say that he believed that he

had made everything by himself, but

that in reality, he had created the
world because Wisdom, his mother,

“infused him with energy," and im-

planted into him her own ideas. But

he was foolish, and acted uncon-
sciously..."he was even ignorant of
his own mother." (p. 68, Pagels)
