HOLLY NEAR: WILL PLAY HAWAII DEC. 16

Holly Near will make her Hawaiian
singing debut Friday, December 16 on
the University of Hawaii campus.

The charismatic singer and songwriter
has longed to treat a Hawaii
audience to her successful blend of
politics and music. Near's visit to
Honolulu comes after her fall tour
with Ronnie Gilbert in celebration of
the release of their "Lifeline" album.

Gilbert, the soaring contralto of
the pioneering folksinging group "The
Weavers," and Near played to sold-out
halls across the country.

Near's most recent release is her
"Journeys" album, a retrospective view
of her singing career.

Holly Near is one of the few performers
who can defy all stereotypes
and remain successful. In the ‘60s

At the same time she was trying to
make it in the mainstream music business
in the early '70s, Near started
Redwood Records in order to distribute
the music she had been making for
years and the ideas contained in it.
As Near toured the country singing at
union halls, churches, prisons, universities
and other countries including
Japan and Vietnam, Redwood Records
grew too big to remain a cottage industry
managed by her parents. It is
currently co-owned and run by Near,
Jo-Lynne Worley and Joanie Shoemaker.

Near altered her determination to
"make it" and began to make strong
statements about the male-dominated
record industry. Near often works
solely with women musicians and all-woman
crews. And her songs present
portraits of women who are seldom
painted by songwriters: workers, single
mothers, grandmothers and union
activists, to name a few.

She may have been called a protest
singer, but in the '80s she tackles issues
like U.S. foreign policy, racism,
sexism, lesbian-feminism, the threat
of nuclear war and the devastation of
the environment with her positive and
beautiful music. She not so much protests
the negative, but promotes the
positive.

Near's music will be brought to life
in an added dimension—even for hearing
fans—by American Sign Language interpreter
Susan Freundlich. Susan's artistry
combines dance and mime and is
rooted in her belief that art and music
are vital communicating forces for cultural
and political ideas and that access
to them is of profound importance
to millions of deaf and hearing-impaired
people.

Near will be accompanied on the piano
by a new addition to her performance,

Ina Goldin. (page 3)
