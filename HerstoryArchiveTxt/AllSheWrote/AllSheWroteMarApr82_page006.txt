However, Phoolan managed to escape,  
gathered together her own gang (all  
male) and eventually had all her  
rapists and other men who had hum-  
iliated her, put to death. This is  
why Phoolan Devi is today the most  
wanted woman in India.  

Senator Lori Wilson of Coco Beach,  
Florida is the only politically in-  
dependent state senator in any  
legislature in the nation. Since  
1972, Ms. Wilson has been the prime  
sponsor and supporter of the ERA  
in the Florida Senate. In a fiery  
address before the Florida Senate  
in April 1977, Ms. Wilson asks  
rhetorically: "In 10 Southern  
States, ERA remains in trouble...  

As a native Southerner, I ask you:  
Why? The answer, my fellow Senators,  
is sadly the same throughout the  
South. It's because the Good ole  
Boys in the Southern legislatures  
traditionally do not consider  
people issues, like ERA, on their  
merit. They consider only what it  
might do to their money-ness...  
Well, let me assure you, that the  
Good ole Boys in this Senate and  
elsewhere in the South, are  
clutching at pseudo power that  
will not last. For lasting pow-  
er, my fellow Senators, comes  

from the people."  

The women of today must not for-  
get the struggles our foremothers  
undertook to secure freedoms for  
us, their daughters. In order  
to remember, it is essential that  
we actively search for the her-  
story of our foremothers. Sadly,  
because women have been delibe-  
rately written out of histo-  

dig deep to find connections with  
her past. Let's not limit our  
remembering to one week out of  
the year. But, bring our her-  
story to every girl and woman  
every week of every year.

NATIONAL WOMEN'S  

HISTORY WEEK  

March 7th - 13th 1982  

National Women's History Week  
was proclaimed by the President  
of the United States and is the  
result of a Congressional Resolu-  
tion co-sponsored by Spark  
Matsunaga. The planning of the  
celebration of NWHW in Hawaii is  
in the hands of a Coordinating  
Committee chaired by Dr. Barbara  
Peterson. The women on the Com-  
mittee represent a myriad of  
volunteer organizations, human  
services, business, government  
and other diverse interests.  

The celebration will take place  
Sunday, March 7, 1-5 p.m. at the  
McKinley High School Auditorium.  
Lt. Governor Jean King will be  
the keynote speaker. Other not-  
able women in the community will  
also address the gathering. Eth-  
nic dances and outstanding Haw-  
aiian performers will provide  
entertainment.  

As the Islands join the na-  
tion in celebrating the week of  
March 7-13, it is proper to con-  
sider the reason that prompted  
the declaration of NWHW. It is  
a need to recognize, though be-  
latedly, the well-deserved place  
of women in history which has  
been consistently overlooked and  
undervalued in the body of Amer-  
ican History.  

It is appropriate at this time  
to state the contribution of  
women in the development of Hawaii  
and the country as a whole. The  
occasion also provides an oppor-  
tunity to express our hopes for  
the future.  

Everyone is welcome to join us  
in the celebration of National  
Women's History Week with a very  
exciting program.

On February 16, a woman contacted  
us and asked us to inform women  
in the community about a recent  
attack on her near Diamond Head.  
M.O. The assailant waited in his  
van on Puulei Circle with the  

doors open. As the woman walked  
by, he grabbed her, put a rag  
over her mouth, and tried to  
push her into the van. She was  
able to scream, attract some  
neighbors and get free.  
Description: The assailant was  
a Caucasian man in his twenties,  
about 6 ft. tall, medium build,  
with sandy, straight hair, about  
shoulder length. The van was  
white.  

There was a similar case in  
the Kahala area which resulted  
in a rape, but the assailant  
was never caught.  

If you would like more infor-  
mation about this attack, or  
have similar information to share  
with other women, call Tamie or  
Ramona at 946-4196. WOMEN WATCH  
wants to encourage women to share  
information about sexual attacks.  
You can reach us in complete con-  
fidentiality: P.O. Box 23269,
