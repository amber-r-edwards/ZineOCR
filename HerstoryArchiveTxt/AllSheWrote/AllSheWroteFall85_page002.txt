Purpose of the University YWCA

The Young Women's Christian  
Association of the University  
of Hawaii, historically rooted  
in the Christian faith but now  
embracing a multiplicity of  
faiths, seeks to respond to the  
challenge of social change.

The Association draws together  
into responsible membership women  
and girls of diverse experiences  
and faiths, that their lives may  
be open to new understanding and  
deeper relationships, and that to-  
gether they may join in the struggle  
for peace and justice, freedom and  
dignity for all people.

One Imperative

To thrust our collective power  
toward the elimination of racism  
wherever it exists and by any  
means necessary.

GRAND OPENING  
OF THE  
COFFEELINE

We celebrated the re-  

opening of our coffeehouse  

with a big bang at our grand  
opening, featuring music by George  
Street, Denny “Mariawes” BOD  
Matsuo, Joanie Komatsu, Wayne  
Takamine, and County Line, all  
of whom graciously donated  
their time and music to our Y.  
If you missed our grand  
opening and would like to  
listen to these musicians:  
George Street is playing at  
Chuck's, Manoa Market Place,  
Joanie is performing at the  
Moana Hotel in the Gang Plank  
lounge, and you'll find Wayne  
Takamine at the Pottery  
Steakhouse.

In addition to the great  
music, we had an impressive  
array of pupus and desserts at  
our grand opening donated to

YY News  

The University Y is  
bustling with activity these  
days, and anyone returning to  
the Y after even just a brief  
absence can't help but notice  
the many changes. I would  
like to take this time to  
share with you the Y's recent  
accomplishments:

The membership committee,  
headed by Irene Vasey, has  
completed a new brochure and  
we are in the midst of a  
membership drive. If you have  
not joined, you may like to do  
so now. We have a special  
$15.00 membership which  
includes a subscription to All  
She Wrote and a T-shirt.

Our incorporation papers  
have been filed! A very  
special mahalo to Vicki  
Gaynor.

The University Y Board  
has just recently voted to  
join the Women's Consortium as  
a Charter member. The purpose  
of the Consortium is to  
improve communication among  
women's groups and allow  
these groups to work together  
on many important issues.

You may have noticed our  
new logo on our stationery and  
in this issue. It was  
designed by Chester Vause, who  
is an Assistant Professor in the  
Physics Department. Thank  
you, coffeehouse committee! The  
coffeehouse area has been  
cleaned, painted, and  
redecorated. Many, many  
volunteers have spent hours  
doing many tedious jobs to see  
the Coffeeline open again. It  
seems though that opening the  
doors was just the beginning.  
The Coffeeline breakfast was  
entirely staffed by  
volunteers, whose assiduous  
dedication continues. If you  
would like to join this hard-  
working bunch in 1986, call  
Lue and she will put you in  
contact with the group.

Our Second Annual Women's  
Crafts Fair happened on Nov. 2  
and we had a number of  
volunteers making sure that it  
was even more successful than  
last year's. Margie Boulden  
spearheaded this major project  
and she did a great job.

The annual Women's  
Halloween Dance was held on  
October 26 and organized by  
the Lesbian Support Group.

The bookstore committee  
has not been idle either.  
They have ordered all those  
favorite calendars, books,  
etc. for the Christmas  
season.

The front page illustration was produced for the  
YWCA of Australia; it was originally designed as a button.  

The women's faces which appear on page 3 were reproduced  
from a lithographic poster entitled "Liberty."

The Lesbian Support Group  
meets every Wednesday night at  
7:30 pm at the University  
YWCA. The first Wednesday of  
the month is special speaker  
night.

A support group means  
different things to different  
people. The Lesbian support  
group at the University YWCA  
means a lot to me. It means a  
safe place to talk to other  
women who share my lifestyle.  
It means two hours a week with  
people who can empathize with  
my feelings.

I can't say that there's  
anything specific that I  
expect to get out of the  
support group. I'll only get  
as much out of it as I choose  
to, or am able to put into it.  
So I try to bring an open mind  
and a positive attitude to  
each meeting. I listen to the  
other women in the group, try  
to relate to the way they look  
at things, the way they feel,  
then compare those things with  
my own feelings. In this way,  

I feel that I am learning to  
better understand human  
nature, and more importantly,  

myself.

At the support group I  
can talk about things that I’d  
like to talk about with my  
family, but can't. My mother  
is afraid to acknowledge my  

The members of the  
support group feel safe. They  
are people that I may know  
intimately or barely know at  
all, but I can tell them  
things that I couldn't tell  
most people, not even my ex-  
lover. The support group  
makes me feel whole -- like  
there is a place where even a  
person like me can belong.  
Some things in life are  
more difficult than others;  
some things that I would like  
to learn to be more open  
about. Things like being more  
open about my feelings. I'd  
like to be able to face people  
who are important to me with  
confidence -- my family,  
especially my mother. At  
least, though, I know that my  
sister is on my side. Someday  
I'd like to be able to stand  
up and say with pride "I'm a  
lesbian." Somehow I think
