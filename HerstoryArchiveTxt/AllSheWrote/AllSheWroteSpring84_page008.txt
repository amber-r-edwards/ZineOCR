University YWCA
Mission Statement

The University YWCA is a responsi-
ble, non-profit, voluntary association,
and a member of the National Student
YWCA which is responsive to the needs
and interests of women in the Univer-
sity community, including students,
faculty, and staff.

We uphold and advocate feminist val-
ues, cultural and social pluralism
and solidarity among women through par-
ticipation in alternative and unique
programs; by providing service,
education, information, and referrals,
and by operating as a clearinghouse on
women's issues for women in the univer-
sity community.

The one imperative is to thrust our
collective power toward the elimina-
tion of racism wherever it exists and
by any means necessary.
