YS glided across the shelf:  
raspberry, strawberry. I was  
“a supermarket deciding what  
flavor soda to buy, I was in a drug  
store looking at douches, amazed at  
the various fragrances. Jasmine...  
mountain herbs...country flowers....  
The lyrics of a song crept into my  
mind: "You fill up my senses like a  
night in the forest."

The thought of smelling like a  
strawberry made me laugh - it is so  
aberrant - until I discovered the  
insult underneath. Why would men  
rather have women smell like country  
flowers than smell like women? What  
are the male manufacturers of these  
products saying to us? Not only do  
they slap women's faces with the in-  
sinuation that our natural scents  
need to be disguised, but they make  
big money by playing on women's fears  
of being unacceptable to men.

In an article about feminine hy-  
giene sprays, Nora Ephron quotes  
Natale Shainess, a psychoanalyst:  
"...The sense of smell is tied up  
with paranoia.... These products  
further paranoid feelings in women  
and in men about women - and the way  
they're advertised presents a horrend-  
ous image, of women being inherently  
smelly creatures. It undermines the  
sense of self and ego even as it's  
something about  

marketing of douches.

The Ephron article further uncovers  
misogyny with a quote from a male em-  
ployee of Warner-Lambert, makers of  

~ SHOPPING WITH CHERYL’

Pristeen. "Our whole approach was,  
women have a vaginal-odor problem and  
here is a product that will solve it.  
They do, you know.... The problem is  
there." And, an advertisement for  
FDS: "..a woman, if she's completely  
honest about it, realizes her most  
serious problem isn't under her arms."

But the most urgent problem is much  
more serious than making women feel  
they are "inherently smelly crea-  
tures." These commercially-produced  
douches contain chemicals. I took one  
of the douches, randomly, from the  
shelf and copied down the sinister-  
sounding ingredients. I then went to  
the library and found a dictionary to  
define these ingredients. Here is the  
list of ingredients and their defini-  
tions:

Benzalkonium chloride -- ammonium  
detergent. A germicide, Incom-  
patible with most detergents and  
soaps. Used as a topical anti-  

septic.

Propylene glycol - clear, color-  
less, viscous liquid. Absorbs  
moisture, acts as a solvent.

No adverse effects have been re-  
ported in man (sic), but large  
oral doses in guinea pigs and rats is very small.

Thymol - destroys mold, preserves  
anatomical specimens, is a topical  

antifungal agent. Ingestion can  
cause vomiting, diarrhea, dizzi-  
ness and heart slowdown. It is  
omitted from hypoallergenic cos-  
metics because it can cause aller-  
gic reactions.

Menthol - a mild local anesthetic.  
It is nontoxic in low doses, but  
in concentrations of 1% or more it  
exerts an irritant action that  
can, if continued long, produce  
changes in all layers of the  
mucous membrane.

What strikes me first is that two  
of these ingredients are for topical  
use. Secondly, I wonder what is con-  

sidered to be prolonged use or “low  
doses." After the advertisements  
have made a woman paranoid about hav-  
ing an odor problem, I wonder if she  
would use the douches frequently  
enough to induce vomiting, allergic  
reaction, central nervous system de-  
pression, etc. Finally, is it worth  
exposing an area as sensitive as the  
vagina to these chemicals - just to  
smell like a PRETTY and to en-  
courage some men's sick fantasy of  
what a “woman" should be?

system to rest from the overload of  
stress, to heal and repair the body  
and to establish a new pattern for  
stress management.

How? With the use of a specialized  
biofeedback tool*, I can detect and  
measure the intensity of stress on any  
given nervous system. Then, with ano-  
ther specialized pair of tools, my  
HANDS, I locate and release the stress  
from over 140-200 key nerve centers  
throughout the body using specifically  
timed pressure. This brings the  
stress level down to zero and cleans  
up the negative energy field that sur-  
rounds many adults and most children.

Stress can be the underlying cause  
for many conditions: high blood pres-  
sure, chronic fatigue and many others.  
As a result, to free the body from a  
negative stress pattern can arrest or  
reverse chronic conditions. As a doc-  
tor, I cure no one. I assist the body  
to heal itself. This is the inherent  
potential.

As a person, I celebrate the know-  
ledge that WE ARE complete and whole  
human beings and we are all in the pro-  
cess of learning to tap into that  
which is ALIVE and WELL within us.
