EDITORIAL

All She Wrote is a feminist paper.
By this we mean the paper will:

The All She Wrote collective encour-
ages articles by and about the women
of Hawaii. Because we seek the widest
possible representation of women in

our community, all submissions will be
considered. We feel that each woman
knows what she wants to convey and has
her own unique style, for example, pid-
gin; therefore, those pieces selected
will be edited only for spelling and
punctuation. Changes in length, gram-
mar and content will not be made un-
less negotiated with the author. Due
to space limitations articles are gen-
erally two typed pages, double spaced.
Articles, graphics, poetry, and car-
toons should be submitted to: All

She Wrote, University YWCA, 1820
University Ave., Honolulu, HI 96822.

If you would like your submissions
returned to you, please include a
stamped, self-addressed envelope.
