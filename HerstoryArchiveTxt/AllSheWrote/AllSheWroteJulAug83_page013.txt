ANNOUNCEMENTS

DOWNTOWN COUNTRY STORE NEEDS YOUR HELP

The third annual YWCA “Downtown
Country Store" sale is scheduled to
take place on August 25 and 26 at the

sale was a big success, thanks to the
hard work of dedicated volunteers and
staff. Over $4,000 was raised for
various YWCA programs. With your help

DONATE GENEROUSLY

Now is the time to round up rummage
items for the sale during your "spring

that you no longer need but that are

books, clothing,

have outgrown, old
household items, etc. You can drop

them off at any YWCA location. For
pick-up of bulky items, call 538-7061.

VOLUNTEER YOUR TIME

Many volunteers are needed to sort
and price items before the sale, to
set up and clean up, to join others in
baking cookies and cakes, to distri-
bute publicity about the event, and to
work during the sale itself. No mat-
ter how much or little time you can
spare, call 538-7061 to sign up, or
fill out and send in the form below to:

find at the "Downtown Country Store."
See you there!

must be resolved on moral, philosophi-
cal, and ethical grounds: "All Ameri-
can citizens should be treated equal-
ly. We should have one experience ta-
ble showing the overall experience of
all Americans and not one for Blacks,
not one for women, not one for differ-

of other ways Americans can be subdi-
vided on arbitrary grounds."

LOCAL TV PRODUCTION TO FEATURE CANCER
AND SEXUALITY

Studies show that fears of unaccept-
ability, rejection and isolation cause
more anxiety among cancer patients
than do fears of disease recurrence,
pain, and death. Local feminist Linda
Martin and sexual identity guru Dr.
Milton Diamond of the John Burns
School of Medicine, are producing a
television program that focuses on
these issues, especially sexuality and
cancer. The 30-minute program will air
locally on Channel 13 and then become
a counseling and training vehicle for
medical providers and their patients.
Body image, personal identity and sexual

with women who have experienced
mutilating cancer surgery or treatment.
Hawaii's social service agencies
are not currently addressing the con-
siderable needs of these women and
their sexual partners. This is a
unique opportunity to inform the gen-
eral public and Hawaii's medical pro-
fessionals of the extra medical issues
related to malignant disease and reha-
bilitation.
If you or someone you care about has
undergone hysterectomy, vaginectomy,
vulvectomy, mastectomy, colostomy, or
irradiation treatment for cancer,
please contact Linda Martin at

The Washington-based insurance com-
pany—the largest worker-owned and
worker-managed firm in the country—
practices what it preaches. It offers
life and health insurance policies
that conform to the proposed non-dis-
crimination legislation now before
Congress. CUIC is the only insurance
company in America that has testified
in favor of the legislation before

subcommittees of the U.S. Senate and
House of Representatives.
