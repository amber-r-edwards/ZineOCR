ASIAN AMERICAN

SILK SCREEN, a series of six half-
hour television programs showcasing
award-winning film and video works by
Asian Americans about Asian Americans
made its debut on Hawaii Public Tele-
vision on Sunday, October 10.

The series is a presentation of the
National Asian American Telecommunica-
tions Association (NAATA). Based in
San Francisco, NAATA is a national or-
ganization which distributes television
and radio programming on Asian Ameri-
can themes and issues.

The series centers around issues
and themes key to the Asian American
experience such as the impact of re-
cently-arrived Southeast Asian refu-
gees, the lives of early Asian immi-
grants, and the pursuit of non-stereo-
typical jobs and careers. The SILK
SCREEN series includes several works
focusing on women.

"Sewing Woman" by Arthur Dong

Program two, “Sewing Woman" chroni-
cles the life of a Chinese immigrant
woman who has worked in San Francisco
Chinatown garment factories for over
30 years. Based on the oral histories
of first-generation Chinese women, in-
cluding filmmaker Arthur Dong's own
mother, Zem Ping Dong, “Sewing Woman"
tells the story of a woman who has
played the roles of daughter, sister,
wife, mother, and provider--a true sur-
vivor.

This is the tale of one Chinese
woman whose experiences are representative of many im-
migrant women. She was raised in a small Chinese village; 
having an arranged marriage at the age
of 13; separated from her young hus-
band when he immigrated to America to
find work.

Filmmaker Arthur Dong has woven a
simple tapestry--poignant and sensi-
tive. The film traces the sewing wo-
man's adjustment to America, her pro-
blems with assimilation, and the up-
bringing of her American-born children,
and culminates in the marriage of her
oldest son.

All that is left, she says, “is a
house full of noisy grandchildren."

"With Silk Wings: On New Ground" by
Loni Ding

"With Silk Wings: On New Ground,"
program four, portrays Asian American
women who are in professions not tra-
ditionally associated with either wo-
men or Asian Americans. The women in
this program are realizing their per-
sonal interests, talents, and poten-
tial in jobs only recently open to
Asian American women.

The women featured in the program
are a bartender, pharmacist, dress
designer, judge, park ranger, coxswain,
police officer, television news anchor,
and welder.

The women are filmed in their work-
places and reveal the joys of their
work as well as the difficulties they
have faced as Asian American women
breaking into white male-dominated oc-
cupations.

Welder Daisy Foo says, "I wanted to
get out of office work. I wanted to
do something more challenging, so I
studied welding. At first, my mother
thought it was unladylike, but she's
gotten used to it. The money is twice
as much as I used to make doing office
work."

Police officer Lois Kwan remarks,
"It doesn't bother me to work in a job
where men are chauvinistic because they
have the problem. It's just something
they'll have to get used to."

News anchor Wendy Tokuda says, "One
of the reasons I wanted to become a
news reporter was because there was a
Japanese American woman on the news in
Seattle, and I remember that my whole
family was astounded because it was so
unusual to see an Asian on television
and a woman too. And I thought to my-
self, gee, I think I can do that."

The program shows how these Asian
American women are asserting them-
selves in tough, competitive jobs and
overcoming longstanding stereotypes.

"China: Land of My Father" by Felicia
Lowe

Program five, "China: Land of My
Father" is a filmed record of Chinese
American journalist Felicia Lowe's
first journey to China.

The film is a personal odyssey--the
first impressions of Lowe's country of
ancestry and a search for her "roots."
Lowe travels through the expansive
countryside and films sights not pre-
viously open to Western cameras. She
interviews a Chinese woman journalist
who has virtually the same background
as she has: married with one son and
faced with combining a burgeoning
career with family needs.

In a touching, tearful conclusion,
Lowe makes a pilgrimage to her father's
home village and sees her relatives for
the first time. She meets her grand-
mother in the house where her father
spent his childhood. On the wall are
family photographs of her father and,
to her surprise, pictures of Lowe,
herself.

"What touched me most of all," says
Lowe, “was to find photographs of me
from infancy to my college graduation
that my father had been sending all
these years. So that's what it means
to have a grandmother. I never knew.
I had no idea she cared for me, or was
interested in my childhood...Up to
that moment, she had been just a pic-
ture of a little old lady who lived
ten thousand miles away."

"Emiko" by Emiko Omori

"Emiko," the final program of the
series, is a brief look at filmmaker
Emiko Omori through her own lens.
Omori, who is now a successful cinema-
tographer, reflects on her journey as
one of the first women behind the camera.
This black-and-white film was shot
in 1969 at a time when it was consid-
ered a breakthrough for women to enter
the male-dominated world of news photo-
graphy.

Omori confides, “I think I became
interested in cinematography because
it allowed you to be in places that you
didn't think you should be in."
