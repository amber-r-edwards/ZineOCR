I hate change.

Like the scruffy child who's asked to wash

I pout and say "NO".

I butt heads with it

push it away,

sift it through then sift it through again and again.

Defenseless I am sent through a gamut and thrashed about mercilessly.

Only after the process has spent itself
change is accepted for what it is worth
letting a Shangrila of bliss

flow tumultuously and unrelenting.

We come together gently

awakening the past

sharing different worlds or so it seems.

You have encompassed my being in such a short time
leaving me to wonder why or how

intended or not the voyage has begun.

A continual stream of questioning and answers
that leave one another in awe

MOTHERHOOD

Baby crying, crying, crying. ...

Anger swells my breasts with bitter milk
Here, eat already, shut up.

Will Princess Di feel the same tired rage
at the squalling heir of England?

Bonny Prince Charles looked blown away.
"My lord, is that what it's all about?

I never realized what women go through.

I say."

Princess Di's baby is swaddled in lace

and gold.

Mine wears 78¢ thrift shop t-shirts

Hers is perfumed in sweet lavender.

Mine reeks of spit-up and doo-doo.

But we both felt those ripping red birth
pains,

We both pushed pushed our bowels

raw, until our babies popped out, wet and
gasping.

Do you think Lady Di ever cursed at Charles
during her ordeal?

Did sweat drip from her pale temples and hairless
armpits?

bringing forth laughter and pain
and sometimes silence.

Circumstances make your arrival timely

as I ponder through a wave of self-assurance,

reassessing dreams and aspirations of my

emotional, spiritual and intellectual growth.

A foundation of understanding develops.
Perhaps a serene matrix may transpire
undeniable and true

Baby stops crying, smiles and farts.
"It's ok, I love you, Mommy."

Her eyes laugh.

A calm peace flows between us.

The crying is over.

All is forgiven, at last.

Outrage

All She Wrote Press - Recently on the
University of Hawaii Manoa campus the
Women's Studies Department posted fly-
ers for their fall courses; within 24
hours all the flyers were torn down.
As this press release circulated
through the August 10th ASW meeting,
the women of the collective became ex-
tremely outraged. The news of this
recent act of misogyny was coupled
with other occurrences of similar
deviancy: The flyers for the July
June Millington Concert, the Women's
Dances at the University YWCA, and

the Women's coffee house were also
torn down.

"A typical collective. Two members
are happy, the other is severely De-
pressed."

It's never easy to mesh three sep-
arate and distinct personalities, ide-
ologies and perspectives into a cohe-
sive unit. Each meeting is like a
separate birth, ideas and plans emerg-
ing with a lot of kicking and scream-
ing. Nevertheless, the evening of
August 16 ended with a feeling of
accomplishment for each of the three
women of Purpleheart Productions,
Hawaii's newest distributor of women's
music.

Assumed from Jo and Jacqui des-
Marets, who held the distributorship
from Olivia Records and Redwood Rec-
ords since 1980, Ronda Ashby, Clarice
Cornett and Mary Wilkowski are deter-
mined to make a concerted effort to
continue to nurture an audience for
women's music in Hawaii. .

"We're going to promote women's
music through all of its phases," said
Cornett, "from conception to perfor-
mance, from recording to record
sales."

There's a market here."

The collective emerged from its char-
ter meeting with a set of impressive
goals: to establish and open a
national network of women's music;
obtain the Hawaii distributorship for
different women's music labels; >

broaden the commercial base for
women's music in Hawaii; produce and
promote concerts of women's music;
discover, produce and promote new
women artists,

"I identify really strongly with
women's music," said Ashby. "I re-
member that women's music sustained
me through the first six months of my
newly developing feminist identity.
I'd like to see us get more music
played. This kind of music strength-
ens the bonds between women in the
community." :

Purpleheart Productions is not
planning to raise the prices of the
albums it distributes. Albums will
remain $8.00 a piece. "We'll be ex-
panding the line" enthused Ashby,

"We want to introduce more women to
the beautiful energy and wonderful
productions of the likes of Willie
Tyson, Sharon Rydel, and Sir
Avedis, while continuing to promote
the likes of Holly Near, Cris Will-
iamson, Kay Gardner and Margie
Adams."

On that note with visions of rec-
ord sales dancing in their heads the
new collective went to bed. In their
dreams they wish to let you know the
up and coming attractions are a June
Millington concert in November and a
record review column to be featured

regularly in All She Wrote.
