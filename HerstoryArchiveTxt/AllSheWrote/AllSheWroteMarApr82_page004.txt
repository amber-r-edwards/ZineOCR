mothers, or step-fathers who raped  
them into the arms of other men  
who were equally predatory. Yet  
through all of this, they pos-  
sess a resilience and warmth.  
They are deeply interested in  
women's issues and frequently  
ask about local women's organ-  
izations. They often wonder if  
these women's groups could help  
them secure their rights in the  
prison and even attempted to or-  
ganize their own group, Hui O'  
Wahine, in an effort to secure  
equal access to recreation fa-  
cilities and prison worklines  
(they were told to see a lawyer).  
At this time, with a repres-  
sive and brutal new prison admin-  
istration in control, and the  
public mood lodged comfortably  
in the "get tough" solution to  
crime, it is especially important  
for feminists to re-discover  
their sisterhood with these wo-  
men. The most direct victims of  
institutional sexism, these wo-  
men have taken the brunt of the  
economic hard times. Here in  
Hawaii, the number of incarcer-  
ated women is growing, and last  
Christmas, a woman hung herself  
in the police cell block after  
having been arrested for steal-  
ing food. The link between the  
suffering of these women and the  
situation of their sisters must  
not be forgotten for the oppres-  
sion of the most victimized and  
least powerful segment of the  
women's community is ultimately  
an oppression of all. There is,  
in short, much truth to the old  

Sisters, Free Ourselves and wo-  
men forget this at their peril.

sl I awoke this morning  
Looking out the window at a  
new day  
The sun gently caressing  

the earth.  
Life set free before my eyes.  

I Think of You  

I thought of you  

trapped inside those walls.  

Looking out the window to a  
day  

the same as yesterday more  
stagnant  

with each tomorrow.  

I weep for you in the arms  
of a woman  

Warm and safe in her embrace.  

The sadness pouring from my  
soul  

turns to rage.  

I think of you alone  

grieving for a man you loved.  

A man whose life you had to  
take to  

save your own.  

Alone the same as yesterday  
and even  

more tomorrow.  

Oh woman  

My thoughts come to you  

My soul cries for you  

My rage, our rage will set  
you free.  

Freedom sister;  

You will  

freedom more than yesterday  
for all of your tomorrows.

THE SISTERS OF  
INNER CONNECTIONS  

259 South 60th Street  
Philadelphia, PA 19139  

We are three sisters that  
have spent several years  
getting in touch with who we  
are, what we're about as  
women and coming out of the  
oppressive roles of female  
stagnation in the man's  
system. One of us has been  
in and out of the correction-  
al system and prisons for 25  
years. We feel that women  
in prison are the most op-  
pressed people in the world.  
Being cut off from family and  
children, denied basic re-  
spect and rights--our needs  
ignored, our bodies neglected,  
our voice silenced and our  
thoughts assassinated.  

Inner-Connections is about  
breaking down the walls that  
separate those of us im-  
prisoned inside from those of  
us imprisoned outside; we be-  
lieve as long as we are under  
the illusion of separateness,  
we can never achieve the  
solidarity necessary to win  
the struggle of all people.  
We want to communicate with  
sisters and brothers who are  
about the sisters' struggle,  
to share information and  
support and to build unity  
within a system that says we  
cannot unify. We see as a be-  
ginning place the need for  
sisters' voices to be heard.  
So our efforts are directed to  
printing a newsletter...  
"Writing for Rights: Voices  
Behind Prison Walls".... We  
welcome any donations, feed-  
back and energy from sisters  
and brothers outside, as well  
as inside.

At the recent Black Women and  
Law Conference Dr. Elsie Scott  
of Howard University Criminal  
Justice department presented a  
paper on Black women in prison.  
Dr. Scott points out that "al-  
though Black women make up 12  
percent of the general U.S.  
population, they comprise  
slightly over 50 percent of the  
female prison population."  

Percent of these women are in  
jail for violent crimes, most  
of them convicted of forgery,  
drug dealing and larceny--or  
other crimes of an economic  
nature."  

Also brought to light at the  
Black Women and the Law Confer-  
ence is the shocking fact that  
60 percent of all rape victims  
are black women!
