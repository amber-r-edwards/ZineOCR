CHINA

In Retrospect

Back in America, as I close my eyes  
and think back, I see classes of school  
children with red scarves and flags:

I see old women, some walking awkwardly  
with bound feet; and I see old and  

young men, linked arm in arm in close  
camaraderie. I feel the tremendous  
sense of unity and purpose of the people  
of China.

The grand experience of China today  
gives me the great hope  
for the future of humanity.

What an opportunity to visit what  
may rightly be called the greatest  
social experiment of the 20th century.

We were free to go at  
any time without supervision. I had a  
hard time juggling the packed sched-  
ule with my need to mingle with the  
people. At times I'd skip lunch in  
order to roam the streets...

My pictures are a reflection of the  
friendly faces—clean, healthy, and  
alert—which greeted me. If you want  
to be friends, you have to be friendly.  
This is my motto for international re-  
lations. Their curiosity about me  
matched my curiosity about them. We  
are all one, whether in China or any-  
where in the world. We have common  
needs to love and be loved, and to work  
with a purpose. China is a vital part  
of the human family. I feel one with  
her people. For letting me peek into  
the door of your lives and glimpse  
in, I thank you, people of China!
