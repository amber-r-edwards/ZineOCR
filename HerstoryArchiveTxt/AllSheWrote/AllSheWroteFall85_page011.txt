Stay away, WaW. & WW. Waw.lv at sve ee  
Being in prison is no fun  
It's a step in life, a  
For my mistakes my family  
And believe me I feel it in  
It really hurts me to think of what I've done,  
Being away from those you love isn't any fun.  
Now I'm doing time,  

crime,  

For actually a wrongdoing  

Being in prison gives you a lot of time to think of what is  

A LK  

right and wrong,  

And it really makes me worry for how long.  

Thirteen months in this place,  
Months of my life to waste.  

It'll teach me a lesson not to steal,  
I have to think how my family;  
“toute ana what I've been through,  

But now is my chance to prove I can:  

bent to help elevate upon,  

A chance to prove I can make it worth living.  

IS THINKING OF YOU  

Sitting here in this lonely room  
with nothing much to do,  

I decided to make myself happy,  
so I started thinking of you.  

I'm thinking of a sunny day, and I can almost see  
the scene arranged with the ten soft elves.  

I'm thinking of your gentle smile and the chic of your hair.  

I'm thinking of how lonely I am here and how I can't  

I'm thinking of what you're doing tonight, and I long to be  
by your side,  
I'm thinking of what you're going through, and these tears I have  
to hide.  

I'm thinking of the many things that you and I have done.  

I'm thinking also of years ago when we were having fun.  

I'm thinking of the day to come when I am finally free.  

I'm thinking of our moments alone, together just you and me.  

I'm thinking of the love you're saving, the love you say is mine.  

I'm thinking of such precious moments, moments so divine.  
I'm thinking of the love I have, the love I want to share.  
I'm thinking of another way to prove how much I care,  
I'm thinking of the final day when I am no longer lonely,  
I'm thinking of just you, my love, and how you're my  

ONE and ONLY!

PUZZLE  

FOR MY SON  

My little boy  

full of laughter and joy,  

how you've grown so much,  

I miss you and your baby touch,  

I'm missing the most important part of your growing  
Soon you'll be like a dove soaring.  

You're a typical boy, with your planes and cars,  
While growing you'll be getting childhood scars,  
But you'll always be my little son,  

for you brought my life so much fun.  

You, like your sister, are far away,  

but always thought about day to day.  

I need you to make my life worth living for  

I love you my little boy  
You are my bundle of joy.  
~Melanie Arneson  

MISSING YOU  

Oh! how I miss you  
calling out my name  
as you return home  
from a hard day’s work,  

Oh! how I miss you  

being here with me  

for the joy of your presence  
lingers in my heart.  

Oh! how I miss you  
with a soft kiss  
waking my sleepy eyes.  

Oh! how I miss you,  
-Wilderness  

Oh! how I miss you  

voice filled with excitement  
to share with me  

your day’s experience  

MY MAN...MY LOVE  

My man, My love  
I see that look in your eyes  

as you walk through that door  

and sit by my side  

Must we keep meeting like this  

or is it the only way  

As you should know, my love  

I have no say  

That is your gripe  

I know I must pay  

But I have no rights  

so let's just talk, okay  

Let's not waste time  

it's not on my side  

before you know it  

we'll have to say goodbye  

So tell me, my love  

about the outside world  

to help me forget the pain I hold  

Pray, with me, our same old prayer  

let it be heard that my freedom is near  
Unchain my heart from this forsaken place  
forgive me my man for my stupid mistakes  
I'm watching the clock  

wishing this hour  
passes thin  

I know you understand  
the five-minute warning  
has just been commanded  
I love you, my love  

my man  

I'll be looking forward  
to seeing you  

always and again.
