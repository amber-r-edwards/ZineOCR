"DON'T LET OUR CHILDREN TURN INTO

RADIOACTIVE WASTE," proclaimed
more than 4,000 Finnish women who
have pledged not to have children
until Finland changes its pro-
nuclear power policy. After the
Chernobyl accident we wanted our
voices to be heard, said
protestor Marjo Liukkonen. "We
decided to declare a childbearing
strike because we consider the
effect of nuclear power on future
generations. Men look at nuclear
power only on the basis of short-
term profit." ene Magazine,
Sept/Oct 1986.

WEAVING WOMEN'S COLORS: A DECADE
OF EMPOWERMENT is the theme of
the ninth annual conference of
The National Women's Studies
Association (NWSA), in
cosponsorship with Spelman
College, Agnes Scott College and
Emory University.

This conference on the inter-
section of race and gender will
convene at Spelman College,
founded in Atlanta, Georgia in
1881 for the education of black
women, from June 24-28, 1987.

The call for proposals states
that the organizers are parti-
cularly concerned with advancing
ways, methods and of “com-
prehending issues, creating appropriate
language to describe problems and
to generate solutions, in-
vestigating our methods of
arguing, deciding priorities,
reaching agreements and taking
actions.

NWSA was founded in 1977 to
further the social, political,
and professional development of
women's studies throughout the
country at every educational
level and in every educational
setting. Its membership
consists of individual, academic,
and community-based programs,
projects, and groups interested
in feminist education. Its aims
include the elimination of
oppression and discrimination
based on sex, race, age, class,
religion, and sexual orientation,
as well as other barriers to
human liberation inherent in the
social structure.

Membership is available on a
sliding scale, $10-$75. Write the
NWSA National Office, University

VICTIMS

The Colorado Outward Bound School
and Ending Violence Effectively,
a counseling service, offer a
Victims of Violence Recovery
Program, which 200 women have
completed. “After three days in
the mountains, working closely
together, women have made break-
throughs that might have taken
months in conventional therapy,"
says Penny Brodeur, who oversees
the program. The program just
received governmental assistance,
which means that up to 75% of the
participants won't have to pay
the full $140 program fee. Write
