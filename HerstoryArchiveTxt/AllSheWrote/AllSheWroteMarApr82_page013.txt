HOLLY NEAR CONCERT

In early November, 1981, rumor  
had it that Holly Near, a well  
known female vocalist and com-  
poser, was coming to Hawaii to  
perform in concert. Given in-  
sufficient time to organize it  
and enough people to support  
its happening, rumor won out,  
and the concert was cancelled.

But the increased public  
interest and our strong desire  
for commitment and energy to  
have it happen have not dwindled.  
For all those who have been dis-  
appointed or disillusioned, for  
those still wondering if it's go-  
ing to occur and oh yes, for  
those of you who have no idea  
who Holly Near is; Yes, we are  
planning to pull it off. She  
and company are planning on  
coming to perform on Oahu on  
May 31st or beginning of June.

Holly Near is a people's  
poet; moreover, she is a sooth-  
sayer of peace and a bringer of  
hope for women around the world.  
A powerful performer, she is  
best known for her music that  
revolves around such topics as  
politics, culture, and feminism.

She has toured in concert,  
performing for various women's  
groups, Native American support  
committees, anti-nuclear or-  
ganizations, and other groups  
that do progressive political  
work. She also works with the  
women's music network, which  
is made up of concert producers,  
recording, and musicians  
who are working to develop  
women's music to its full poten-  
tial.

A small group of us involved  
in various community projects  
and committed to the philosophy  
of Holly's music, and the work  
she has been involved in for  
years, were excited at the pros-  
pect of having her come here.

Given the critical changes  
that are happening in the nation  
and to our state, with looming  
budget cuts and closing of pro-  
grams, there seems to be an in-  
creasing need for individuals,  
communities, and organizations to  
pull together.

The battle lines have been  
drawn between those who have  
less and those who have more,  
the young and the old, one  
agency against another and the  
list can go on. All having one  
similar theme, cuts in benefits,  
cuts in budgets, and feelings of  
confusion and helplessness about  
how to deal with the official  
mandates coming down.

Holly's music has always been  
an energizing vehicle to help  
bridge some of the divisions  
and separations that have been  
set in society. We would like  
her coming here to be an aid to  
many of the organizations and  
individuals who are focusing on  
bringing unity for us in these  
troubled times.

In addition, we would like the  
concert to be a benefit concert  
for a community agency most in  
need of financial support in  
this crisis.

The concert will climax a day  
long fair with activities, food,  
and information focused on  
community services available and  
ways to save our human resources.

This project clearly is an am-  
bitious one, containing the  
power and potential to network  
and begin unifying many of us as  
well as be a source of enjoy-  
ment, pleasure, and inspiration.  
Whether one chooses to be a par-  
ticipant as an organizer or  
agency or one decides to attend  
as a supporter or out of in-  
terest, the sharing and growth  
that is in potential is wonder-  
fully exciting.

A meeting will be held on  
Sunday, March 13th, for all in-  
terested individuals and organiz-  
ations wishing to support or get  
involved in the fair and concert.  
Ticket sales for groups and in-  
dividuals will be available in  
mid-April. For further informa-  
tion you can call Maria at 949-  
5157 or leave messages with Jo  
at the University YWCA Women's  
Center, 538-7061, ext. 234.

IGNORANCE IS NOT  
BLISS FOR WOMEN  
Recently, two incidents  

occurred which I find very dis-  
turbing. Both involved the  
suppression of information which  
could have helped women avoid  
being victims.

The first incident involves a  
woman who was  
driving from Honolulu to Kailua  
late one night and never arrived  
home. Her car was found beside  
a highway. She was missing,  
along with her car registration  
papers and her driver's license.  
According to the January 24,  
1982 edition of the Star Bulle-  
tin, police believe  
she may have been abducted by a  
man posing as a police officer.  
"Police in recent years have re-  
ceived sporadic complaints of a  
fake officer preying on women  
drivers on the Pali-Kailua  
route.... Most sensed something  
was wrong and didn't stop or  
accelerated immediately after-  
ward, several driving direct to  
the Kailua Police Station."

Why wasn't this information  
made public so women would be  
aware of this danger? Certainly  
if it had been a page one item  
in the Honolulu newspapers, Lisa  
Au would have been on her guard  
that evening.

A few days after reading  
about Lisa Au, I was on the U.H.  
campus and picked up a copy of  
The headlines  
shouted, “Three Campus Rapes  
Reported." According to the  
newspaper, the same man is sus-  
pected in all three attacks.

The Honolulu Police Department  
has sketches of the attacker  
which they will not release.  
Furthermore, Campus Security  
claimed they sent reports of two  
of the assaults to Ka Leo, but  
the paper has no record of re-  
ceiving them. The Campus Secur-  
ity secretary said she does not  
remember sending notices to Ka  
Leo, nor does she have records  
of having done so.

Why is this information suppressed? Why will HPD  
not release the sketches?

The Ka Leo article states  
that Campus Security is under no  
legal obligation to inform the  
university community of sexual  
assaults on campus. Don't they,  
and HPD, feel a moral obligation  
to release any information which  
will help women protect them-  
selves?

The one and only person who  
benefits from the withheld in-  
formation is the criminal.

Women are made vulnerable be-  
cause they are kept ignorant of  
his existence. How can law en-  
forcement procedures become so  
twisted that they protect the  
unknown assailant and make tar-  
gets of unsuspecting women?

I wish I had answers to my  
questions. The fact is that  
women cannot depend on the  
police and campus security to  
be concerned with our safety.

At one time I had the idea that  
one of the jobs of the police  
force was to protect citizens  
from crime, and that security  
personnel had a similar func-  
tion. It is outrageous that  
these very people take crimes  
against women so lightly that  
by their suppression of infor-  
mation they make the list of  
victims grow.
