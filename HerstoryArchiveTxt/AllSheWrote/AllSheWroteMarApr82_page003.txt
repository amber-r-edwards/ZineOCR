OURSELVES - A RETROSPECTIVE

In the early days of the women's  

movement, concern over the condi-  
tions of imprisoned women ranked  
near the top of the feminist a-  
genda. One of the most dramatic  
victories of the young movement,  
for example, was the closing of  
the notorious Women's House of  
Detention in New York City. Ar-  
ticles and books on the subject  
of women in prison brought the  
plight of poor and minority wo-  
men keenly into focus for all  
women and kept the movement in  
touch with women whose idea of  
liberation extended beyond an  
equal shot at a seat on a corpo-  
rate board.  

But in the 1970s, the ini-  
tial concerns for women so dif-  
ferent from the movement's mid-  
dle class base faded as feminism  
became "respectable." The move-  
ment did, however, retain an in-  

criminal justice issue; this  
interest was focused on the  
woman as victim.  

Originally, even concern for  
the female victims of crime was  
the exclusive preserve of grass-  
roots feminists. The system's  
unstated assumption was that wo-  
men who were the victims of  
physical assault or rape had  
probably brought it upon them-  
selves. Hence, the first rape  
crisis and spouse abuse centers  
were organized by women's groups  
without much formal support and,  
sometimes, in the face of offi-  
cial hostility. However, inter-  
est in this social problem, un-  
like the concern for women of-  
fenders, was of substantial ap-  
peal to certain elements of the  
establishment. Quickly law en-  
forcement and social service  
agencies allied with liberal  
hospital administrators and the  
more conservative women's organ-  
izations to move into the area  
of "victimology." Here things  
were much more comfortable to  
the liberal paternalists. They  

could now shower their regard on  
the proper kind of woman, the  

helpless, plundered waif, and si-  
multaneously make inroads into  
the troublesome women's communi-  
ty. Confusion in the feminist  
ranks over how best to respond  

to agencies suddenly willing to  
spend money on the woman victim  
(money which has always been des-  
perately short for women's ser-  
vices) aided in the paternalist  
takeover.  

The success of this strategy  
has been so complete that the  
women's movement has lately been  
very quiet about abuses within  
the criminal justice system.  
This silence is particularly i-  
ironic as the 70s signaled a  
dramatic deterioration in the  
situation of the woman offender.  
Despite the fact that women's  
crimes are typically neither se-  

rious nor violent: larceny, for-  

gery and drug offenses, and the  
fact that the percentage of wo-  
men convicted of serious crimes  
has gone down (contrary to pop-  
ular myths), the number of women  
sent to prison has increased  

fivefold during this period.  

Some explained this increase  
by suggesting that these women  
were simply gaining illegal e-  
quality just as their sisters  
were seeking legal equality, but,  
of course, nothing could be fur-  
ther from the truth. Most of the  
increase in female crime has  
come from changes in law enforce-  
ment practices rather than fe-  
male behavior. For example,  
stores are now more willing to  
prosecute shoplifters and states  
are pursuing welfare fraud more  
assiduously.  

Hawaii's situation parallels  
the mainland. There has been a  
dramatic increase in the number  
of women in prison. In the late  
60s, the state had so few women  
sentenced to prison that they  
were simply shipped to the main-  
land. Now, on any given day  
there are about 35-45 women un-  

der lock and key in Oahu's larg-  

est prison (euphemistically known  
as Oahu Community Correctional  
Center). About a third of these  
women are pre-trial detainees,  
another third are serving short  
sentences which are increasingly  
given out with "probation," and  
the final group are sentenced  
felons.  

The typical woman in OCCC is  
not, then, incarcerated for a  
serious offense. More often  
than not she is a petty property  
or drug offender with a history  
of prostitution. If she is im-  

PAGE 3  

prisoned for a violent offense,  
it was often the murder of an  
abusive spouse. Despite their  
minor criminal records, however,  
the women in OCCC do very hard  
time. This ironic situation is  
a product of the prison adminis-  
tration's excessive concern with  
the prevention of sexual expres-  
sion. To prevent male and fe-  
male inmates from any interac-  
tion which might conceivably re-  
sult in this dread event, the  
prison has essentially deprived  
women inmates of access to the  
woefully small number of pro-  
grams currently available at the  
facility.  

Women inmates at OCCC have no  
access to the prison's two vo-  
cational programs, no access  
to the prison's worklines  
(except janitorial work in the  
women's visiting area), no abil-  
ity to enter the prison's fur-  
lough program, no access to the  
large recreation yard, no access  
to clubs such as Ike Na Paahao  
(Stay Straight), restricted ac-  
cess to religious services and  
community excursions, and no  
voice on the inmate council.  
When they go to school (their  
one genuine program opportunity),  
they must be escorted by a ma-  
tron (male students come to class  
on their own). Women have no  
free movement in the facility  
while many male prisoners move  
about with passes. The prison's  
obsession with sexuality is a  
form of Blue Collar Victorianism  
that ultimately blames the women  
prisoners for any harm done to  

female access to prison program-  

Unfortunately, this concern  
about sexuality does not prevent  
the sexual abuse of women pris-  
oners by prison staff. In the  
recent shakedown, women prison-  
ers were forced to march naked  
out of their cells and down long  
corridors in front of fully  
clothed male staff (some of whom  
were holding attack dogs). Women  
who were menstruating were  
allowed no sanitary devices.  
More seriously, there have been  
persistent reports from prison-  
ers of sexual harassment and  
rape by male guards.  

Harassment and victimization  
is essentially all these women  
have ever known. For many,  
their involvement in crime often  
grew out of a life on the streets  
that was not so much a choice as  
a necessity. They ran from fa-
