LESBIANS OF COLOR

you've heard it said before and it's
true:

NOTHING IS AS POWERFUL AS AN IDEA

WHOSE TIME HAS COME!

Los Angeles Lesbians of Color, an
organization founded in 1978, has been,
since its inception, committed to the
empowerment of lesbians of color on a
political, social, and personal level.
We have recognized that the time has
come for lesbians of color from all
over the U.S. to pull together in a
single force. We are planning a na-
tional conference.

The conference will happen during
the 3-day weekend of July 4, 1983 in
a camp in Southern California. We in-
vite your participation in the build-
ing of this event.

The theme is "Sisters Bonding To-
gether." The setting will be a summer
camp where our sisters may enjoy Cali-
fornia's gentle weather and natural
beauty. A perfect mini-vacation geta-
way, a spiritual oasis in the middle
of the struggle.

In this time, when the dominant for-
ces are redefining our rights, re-
stricting our economic potential, not
to mention advocating a death penal-
ty for us, it is essential to our sur-
vival, as members of world cultures in this
society, and as lesbians, that we cre-
ate a bond which will be impossible to
break. A human bond. It is the hard-
est bond to break.

BASIC

BICYCLE WORKSHOP

A hands-on workshop of basic ten-
speed bicycle maintenance skills will
be happening at the University YWCA
Women's Center, Sunday afternoon,

Nov. 14. This workshop is designed to
educate each woman in how to care for
and maintain her ten-speed bicycle,
use of proper tools, plus emergency
repairs—three skills which provide
freedom in cycling.

This is a hands-on workshop so you
will be required to bring a ten-speed
bicycle. The workshop will be limited
in size. Pre-registration plus an $8
fee (to cover costs of hand-outs and
tools that each woman will take home)
will be required, and participants
will be accepted on a first to sign-up
basis. One work-exchange scholarship
is available to any woman who cannot
afford the fee, for whatever reason.

Additional information will be
available at the Women’s Center. Send
check or money order, your name, plus
a phone number where you can be
reached to:

Lesbians of Color

But we have been kept isolated. I-
solated in our scattered, remote ci-
ties, in our small communities, in our
own tiny lives. We won't be isolated
anymore. We recognize that we have
been kept apart because our unity is
so powerful even they know it.

In our coming together we will be-
gin by refusing to acknowledge the
barriers imposed on us by a society/
government that has sought to keep us
separated through instilling fear of
one another as Third World peoples.

We say: Away with what this white soci-
ety has taught us to believe about one
another! We will begin anew, building
trust and familiarity through our mu-
tual sharing. This is an opportunity
for us to get to know and enjoy one
another—as well as to Build Networks!

The New Right presents a signifi-
cant threat to us and we shouldn't
take that lightly. However, what we
must not do is to underestimate our
power to stop that threat. If we pull
together into a single force.

This First National Lesbians of
Color Conference is bound to be an ex-
citing historical event, and we hope
that a large number of lesbians of
color will be able to attend. For the
weekend of July 4, 1983, our camp will
be the most spiritually charged point
on the face of the earth.
There we will unite to celebrate
and heal ourselves amidst the powers
that be.

PURPLEHEART

PRODUCTIONS

Purpleheart Productions is Hawaii's
new Women's Music record distribution
and concert production company. We in-
troduced ourselves in the September/
October issue of All She Wrote. We're
planning a monthly column which will
feature record reviews and up and coming
musical events.

Since you last heard from us,
Purpleheart Productions has been keeping
more than busy. Our closeted partner
(who can't have her name mentioned in
the same article as "the word") spent a
week in the Bay Area contacting Olivia
Records. Olivia turned on Purpleheart
to many exciting albums and events, the
most dynamic of which has to be Cris
Williamson's new album, Blue Rider.

Blue Rider is currently making her way
across the blue Pacific Ocean and will
be available at our “COMING OUT PARTY"
on November 5 at Everywoman's Coffee-
House.

Ronda Ashby stayed here in Paradise
organizing Purpleheart's inventory, pre-
paring displays for our tape and record
sales and scheming up statewide musical
activities for all to enjoy.

At this writing, Purpleheart Pro-
ductions is proud to present two special
musical events:

The November 5 "COMING OUT PARTY"
will feature our newly updated invent-
ory of records and tapes. We'll be
premiering new releases by Margie Adams,
Cris Williamson, Holly Near and Kay
Gardner. Live music by Purpleheart and
Rosewood. Songbooks. Tee shirts.
FREE BEER. Coffeehouse pupu favorites.
Epicurean delights by Kate. Door
prizes. And the charismatic presence of
the Oahu women's community. Come pre-
pared to preview some outstanding music,
have a great time, and shop early for
Christmas.

As for the second event: it gives
us great pleasure to announce the Hawaii
debut of a Lesbian/Feminist songwriter
who personifies the essence of Women's
Music. Her melodies are catchy. Her
words talk about our lives. Her con-
certs are inspiring. She leaves Women
feeling good about being Women, and
Lesbians feeling great about being
Lesbians. Come and join Purpleheart
Productions in their Premier Concert:
