“Mrs K.: Oral

INTRODUCTION

In 1923, Mrs. K., a nineteen-year-
old picture bride-to-be, left a
small mountain village in Kyong-
sang province, Korea, to marry a
forty-five-year-old Korean immi-
grant who awaited her arrival in
Honolulu, Hawaii. Now seventy-
five years old, Mrs. K. has spent
fifty-five years of her life as a
resident of the island of Oahu.

For Mrs. K., one of the 101 re-
maining out of 1,000 Korean pic-
ture brides who came to Hawaii
between 1910 and 1924, life in
Hawaii followed a similar pattern
to that of other picture brides.
She worked alongside her husband
at an army laundry service; then
she ran a laundry shop, a board-
ing house, a vegetable farm; and
finally she built and managed a
multi-unit apartment building.
Mrs. K.'s life story reads like
an American dream-come-true.

The primary emphasis of this study
is her description of her life in
her own words, recorded during
extensive, open-ended interviews.
As she speaks of her past, Mrs. K.
punctuates her story with laughter
and tears. Her speech is "Korean-
American," which can largely be
understood in context. The follow-

to another interviewer. This story
not only has intrinsic value as a
woman's own life history told in
her own words, but also has speci-
al importance to those interested
in understanding the roles of
first-generation Korean-American
women in American society.

IN SEARCH OF FREEDOM
AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY

I was born in 1904. My parents
were very poor. One year, a heavy
rain came, a flood; the crops all
washed down. Oh, it was a very
hard time, you know. My place was
a very small country village, only
about 100 houses. People can't
talk, can't walk around. Under the
Japanese, no freedom. Not even
free talking. A very hard time. My
auntie told me that my cousin was
living where picture brides come,
Hawaii. Always I heard Hawaii
stories, that time. I thinking
when I grow up I like going Hawaii.
Hawaii's a free place, everybody
living well. Hawaii had freedom,
so if you like talk, you can talk;
you like work, you can work. I
wanted to come, so I sent my pic-
ture.

That time girls in my village can't
walk even ten miles outside. Can't
go any place, only to Sunday School.
I came to Hawaii. It was very un-
usual, because girls always only
were home their whole life before
they marry. Never went out, only
stayed home...cooking, sewing,
working. That time a girl very

seldom went out to a foreign country.

History of

a Korean Bride

By ALICE Y. CHAI.

Nobody know I was going to Hawaii.
If they know, everybody have a big
surprise! Only my auntie and I
know. My auntie living in Pusan.

I went to my auntie's house. My
cousin was getting married and I
was going to sew clothes. I was
telling a lie. So, I came there and
I secretly make my passport ready.
I make it secretly because that
time me going to Hawaii alone is
just like girl selling. I make
everything ready. For twenty days
I can't see my mother and father
straight because of tears coming
down. I cried. About two weeks
before I have to leave, I tell my
father and mother. My father was
very angry. My mother was very
sad, and my father only blame my
mother, fighting, you know. But
they can't stop me. No, they
can't. That time all was ready,
everything ready. Until then, I
can't tell them. I was so scared,
afraid of father and mother. I
only cry by myself.

On the day I leave, the first train
I catch was 4:30 in the morning,
so nobody else see me leave. Only
my mother bring me to the train
station. I was very sad because of
my parents. Father was still mad.
I came to Pusan, my auntie's house,
and stayed two days. I left in the
boat, across Shimonoseki, all night, you know.
Until the next morning across, I
cried.

The excuse closet is not the
exclusive monopoly of white wo-
men--it is a human addiction.
However, this article is about
racism and change and the excuse
closet offers a tool to faci-
litate that change. The excuse
closet can be used to identify,
to examine, to own and perhaps
change one's paralysis and
paucity of information.
