TOTAL PIONEERING  

The University YWCA needs your sup-  
port. For the next four months, we are  
conducting a full-on membership drive to  
bring new energy and strength to the  
budding student association. We are  
asking every woman who reads ALL SHE  
WROTE, every woman who has ever parti-  
cipated in a group or activity at the  
University YWCA; we are asking every per-  
son (male or female) who wants the Uni-  
versity YWCA to continue offering the  
various services, groups and programs  
that we now have to join us in our ef-  
forts to grow, and become a strong,  
membership-based and supported commun-  
ity resource.  

Your annual membership fee of just  
ten dollars will give you a free sub-  
scription to ALL SHE WROTE, discounts  
for selected concerts, dances and other  
special events, free use of the game  
room, and the satisfaction of knowing  
you have done your part to support pro-  
grams such as the Coffeehouse (now open  
to everyone), support and rap groups;  
the Women's Resource Center and more.

Although we are a student association  
YWCA, you do not have to be a student to  
join or to participate in our programs.  
We need a broad-based membership of wo-  
men that is truly representative of the  
diversity of our community to continue  
our work for the One Imperative - the  
elimination of racism, and to continue  
our struggle for the eradication of sex-  
ism.  

This is your personal invitation to  
join our ranks as a supporting member of  
the University YWCA. We look forward to  
hearing from you!
