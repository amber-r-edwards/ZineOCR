JULY/AUGUST ALL-SHE WROTE

IN SEARCH OF A FATHER:

Let me save you some time and money.  
This is not an amusing autobiography.  
There is rare humor, no exotic location,  
little to titillate. For those who  
have read her previous books, it may  
be a disappointment. It is perhaps in-  
teresting as a mythological prototype  
of a girl coming of age in our patri-  
archal culture.

It is not so much a search for a  
father as an examination of one's es-  
sential situation. Indeed one might  
expect a similar story to have been re-  
peated in countless CR groups in the  
latter sixties. It is a personal ex-  
amination, one that may strike chords  
of empathy.

There is the mother/daughter con-  
flict. Despite strong subterranean  
bonds, they are antagonists. Johnston  
draws many parallels between herself  
and her mother. Both had similar re-  
lationships to their mother. Both  
were vigorous, athletic young women  
who explored the world beyond conven-  
tion, presumably by a search for their  
father figure. Johnston's mother  
finds hers in a proper Englishman over-  
seas. Johnston is the consequence of  
her mother's valorous gambit to en-  
trap him in marriage, but neither preg-  
nancy nor the birth of his daughter  
would induce this proper Englishman to  
marry. After five years waiting, her  
mother returns to the USA with a  
fabricated tale of tragic widowhood  
and a surviving daughter.

Johnston is raised by her grandmoth-  
er with mother usually working. As an  
only child raised in a Catholic  
household, she escapes many inequities usu-  
ally imposed on females when there are  
male siblings. An all-girls Catholic  
school was a second haven. In these  
early years she got recognition via  
athletics, clowning, and delinquency.

It is during this time that her ambi-  
valent sexual identity strongly sur-  
faced. It is not a question of know-  
ing she is a girl, but being in a cul-  
tural environment that provided all  
the necessary trappings where one  
could "practice being a boy away from  
the corrupting influence of other boys  
who would treat him like a girl."

Johnston seems never comfortable in  
either role. She describes herself as  
feeling an imposter as a girl or boy.  
This dilemma is clearer to us in retro-  
spect. We have frequently heard that  
all humans innately exhibit a range of  
male/female behavior and an exclusive  
adoption of only one set is a learned  
characteristic.

The role is temporarily fixed when  
Johnston escapes to social acceptabi-  
lity through marriage and children.  
Marriage is a silly personal war,  
children are bothersome baggage, and  
divorce brings her down to poverty.  
All the while, her recognition as a  
dance critic grows. The professional  
side of her life is a success. Since  
Johnston and her children live in pov-  
erty, her mother feels her a failure.  
This failure label Johnston accepts as  
true.

Johnston's profession and amateur  
dancing keep her involved with the  
New York art world. Names of poets,  
painters, and dancers stud the pages.  
She has relationships, but they never  
seem to touch emotional intimacy. Al-  
ways the detached critic, she throws  
herself into wild participation at  
parties, dances, and happenings. Such  
vivaciousness is facilitated by a sur-  
prising drug: alcohol.

It is at one of those parties that  
she is approached by a long-time ad-  
mirer. "This young woman was to all  
immediate appearances everything con-  
sidered desirable by WASP American  
standards." Johnston writes: "Strange  
as it may seem, it still escaped me  
that men in general were prominent  
while women were not...The assumption  
of male superiority was so profound  
that it utterly escaped notice; to no-  
body had been broken, a condition tolerated  
only through the power of my position  
as a critic...as the result of the  
party...I lost my protection. To at  
least one element of my male peer  
group I committed a grave offense--I  
usurped their feeling that they had  
a right to the most desirable women on  
the scene."

In a modern day remake of the Well  
of Loneliness, a knight rides in to  
carry the Vogue beauty back. Like  
Stephen, Johnston then views this as  
natural and inevitable albeit painful.

This volume closes abruptly in the  
mid-sixties like an Agatha Christie  
with the last pages missing. Hopeful-  
ly the next volume carries the story  
forward to a more interesting time. I  
cannot confess to any great anticipa-  
tion. Diana Burg
