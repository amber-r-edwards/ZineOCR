AGE 2°

PURPOSE OF THE UNIVERSITY YWCA

The Young Women's Christian  
Association of the University of  
Hawaii, historically rooted in  
the Christian faith but now  
embracing a multiplicity of  
faiths, seeks to respond to  
the challenge of social change.

The Association draws together  
into responsible membership women  
and girls of diverse experiences  
and faiths, that their lives may  
be open to new understanding and  
deeper relationships and that  
together they may join in the  
struggle for peace and justice,  
freedom and dignity for all  
people.

ONE IMPERATIVE

To thrust our collective power  
toward the elimination of racism  
wherever it exists and by any  
means necessary.

Call for Papers

Several months ago, ALL SHE WROTE  
received a submission which described a  
case of perceived racism and race  
discrimination in an employment  
situation. The Editorial Board's  
decision not to print the article in  
ALL SHE WROTE reflected the position  
that ALL SHE WROTE should not become an  
arbiter in an employment dispute or  
grievance. However, the Editorial  
Board recognized that the issue of  
racism in the workplace is one of  
genuine concern and one for which there  
is no forum.

We are, therefore, issuing a call  
for submissions that address the  
subject of racism in the workplace.  
Articles could include but are not  
limited to the following: causes of  
racism, the relation of cultural  
differences to racism, the concept of  
institutional racism, personal  
prejudice and its effect in the work  
environment, the subtle forms of  
discrimination, ways to counter racism  
or racist employment practices, racism  
and feminism, paternalism and racism,  
models of grievance procedures,  
available sources of mediational  
assistance or legal recourse, and  
training or educational opportunities  
which increase understanding of racism.

Please send your submissions to  
ALL SHE WROTE at the University YWCA.  
For additional information, call Lue at  
538-7061, ext. 235.

EDITORIAL. -|

ALL SHE WROTE has been published  
for several years by the University  
YWCA (succeeding WOMAN ALIVE and FERITY  
of the late 70s and early 80s). The  
paper has been many things to many  
people and generally has reflected the  
interests—primarily feminist—of the  
women who have volunteered considerable  
time and creative energy to produce it.  
The publishing schedule has been in the  
best of times regular and frequent, but  
at other times sporadic and infrequent,  
and in fact this issue is the first in  
many months. The University YWCA Board  
of Directors, which serves as the  
Editorial Board for the paper as well  
as the policy-makers for the  
organization, has recently set as a goal  
that ALL SHE WROTE be published at  
least once a year. However, the Board,  
the production volunteers, and many of  
ASW's readers would like the paper to  
be published more and not less  
frequently. To do so will require  
energetic volunteers and especially  
more contributors.

The subtitle of ALL SHE WROTE is  
"Hawaii Women's Voices" and it is our  
commitment to represent the diversity  
of Hawaii's women in the pages of ALL  
SHE WROTE; that can only happen if you,  
our readers, let us know what you want  
and can contribute. Mail your  
suggestions, reactions, and ideas to  
the University YWCA, attention ASW, or  
phone for more information. If you  
think you would like to volunteer, call  
538-7061, ext. 235 and leave your name;  
one of ASW's volunteers will contact  
you!

FALL 1

ALL SHE WROTE features a special  
insert, WAHINE TIMES, which is pro-  
duced by a group from the Women's  
Prison. Jo DesMarets, M.S.W., formerly  
the Women's Center Director at the  
University YWCA and now a social  
worker at the prison, coordinated with  
the University YWCA Board this joint  
publication.

Since 1932, the University  
YWCA has drawn together  
women that share a commitment  
to social justice.

Although the issues have changed,  
the commitment remains the same.

This year the University of Hawaii  
YWCA incorporated as an autonomous  
Student Association. It faces a big  
challenge as it sets out on its own. As  
friends of the University YWCA you can  
help ensure that it can continue to  
bring together women of diverse faiths  
and experiences in the struggle for the  
freedom and dignity of all people.

We are establishing an endowment  
fund where the principal will never be  
spent but the interest earned will  
guarantee a small operating budget that  
can grow as the fund grows.

This endowment is vitally important  
if the University YWCA is to endure. We  
hope that you will choose to support  
it! Simply complete the form below and  
mail it to the University YWCA, 1820  
University Avenue, Honolulu, HI 96822.
