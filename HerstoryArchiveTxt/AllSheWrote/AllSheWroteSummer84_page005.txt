ALL SHE WROTE

Need A House? Call Ms. Mouse  
by George Mendoza

Illustrated by Doris Susan Smith  
(Grosset and Dunlap)

The book is about Henrietta Mouse,  
an architect and designer of animal  
homes.

The illustrations, by Ms. Smith,  
are excellent, detailed and varied.  
The pictures tell the story. The  
houses are the story. Each house is  
different and is uniquely designed for  
each particular animal. They are fur-  
nished in many different styles, in-  
cluding modern and Japanese. Some of  
the animals that Ms. Mouse designed  
houses for include: birds and squir-  
rels, cats, a worm, a lizard and a  
frog.

What I especially liked about the  
designs is the detail in the interiors  
and living space of the houses. Each  
one is well-suited to the animal and  
the animal's environment. I also like  
the mixture of different types of fur-  
niture in one house.

It describes the houses she de-  

Book Review

I was delighted with Ms. Mouse's  
ideas and would like to live in a cou-  
ple of the houses myself. (So would my  
mom). I especially liked the houses  
she designed for the frog and the cat  
because of the way the houses fit the  
animal's way of life and some of my  

own ideas about a house.  
For example, the house for the frog  

includes indoor and outdoor open space  
and is near the water. This makes it  
easy for the frog to get in and out of  
the water. The cat's house enables  
the cat to get her dinner easily. It  
also includes natural scenery and  
seems to be quite comfortable.

The things I didn't like were:

1. the lack of family style homes.  
Most of the houses are for single ani-  
mals.

2. the lack of baths and toilets.  
Even if the animals go outside, baths  
would be nice.

3. there wasn't much story. Mr.  
Mendoza just comments on the pictures.  
I'd like to know about problems in  
building the houses, changes in design  
and how to go from design to building.

However, overall, I really enjoyed  
the book and would like a second vol-  
ume with the same delightful illustra-  
tions of some homes for some other ani-  
mals such as: tigers, kangaroos, mon-  
keys, bees, penguins, and beavers, just  
to name a few. I would also like more  
story to go with the pictures.

I recommend this book to boys and  
girls who are interested in animals  
and architecture.

PRESS

P.O. Box 4387 + Portland, OR 97208

A new publishing house, Lez  
Press, has been formed in Portland,  
Oregon.

Sylvan Rainwater and Leslie  
Waygren bring to the partnership  
years of work in the women's and les-  
bian/gay rights movements, publish-  
ing and production experience, and  
experience in operating small busi-  
nesses. Complete in-house facili-  
ties make the project economically  
feasible.

Lez Press will publish quality  
work of interest to lesbians, as  
well as feminist-and gay-oriented  
material, which because of its na-  
ture is not generally considered by  
major publishing houses. The edi-  
tors are interested in publishing  
novels and short stories, nonfic-  
tion, plays, and art suitable for  
printed publications (collections  
of black and white drawings and  
photographs). Individual short  
stories will be considered for in-  
clusion in an anthology. No poetry,  
please.

Send double-spaced typed manu-  
scripts to Lez Press, P.O. Box  
4387, Portland OR 97208. Submis-  
sions will be returned only if ac-  
companied by a self-addressed en-  

velope.

Listen to the beating of your heart  
Listen to the blowing of the wind,  
the movement of the Spirit.

Be silent--said the Lord,

and know that I am God.

And listen to the cry of the voiceless  
Listen to the groaning of the hungry  
Listen to the pain of the landless  
Listen to the sigh of the oppressed  
and to the laughter of children.

For that is authentic communication.

Listening to people  
living with people  
dying for people.
