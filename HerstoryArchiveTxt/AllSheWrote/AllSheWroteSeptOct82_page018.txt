SOLIDARITY

ACROSS CULTURES

HELEN NAGTALON-MILLER, Ph.D.  
to the  
SECOND ANNUAL  
WOMEN'S SOLIDARITY LUNCHEON  

June 12, 1982  

I want to express my thanks and  
appreciation to the Committee on the  
Status of Women of the City and Coun-  
ty of Honolulu for having invited me  
to speak briefly today on a topic  
that means a great deal to me, "Soli-  
darity Across Cultures."  

"Solidarity" is a concept which  
has had special importance and sig-  
nificance for me because of my back-  
ground. I am a second-generation  
Filipino-American and I was born in  
the sugar plantation town of Waipahu  
in the late nineteen-twenties. I  
grew up in an extended family where  
Ilokano was the major language of  
communication.  

Our near neighbors spoke other  
Philippine languages such as Tagalog,  
Cebuano, and Ilongo. Our more dis-  

~~" “€ant- neighbors spoke Japanese, Can-  

tonese, Portuguese, Korean, and Span-  
ish. "Hawaiian Creole" or what we in  
Hawaii have always referred to as  

on a a C eile) anguage Na  
linked us all together.  

So-called “Standard English" was  
the official language of instruction  
in the schools. It was supposed to  
acculturate us into the American cul-  
ture and to enable us to communicate  
effectively with the plantation  
management. This management was made  
up of Whites while labor consisted  
largely of Asians.  

We in the labor group were sepa-  
rated from each other in a number of  
ways: we came from different ethnic  
backgrounds; our parents were more  
comfortable speaking their own lan-  
guages and following the ways of  
their own cultures; and we suffered  
from an inferiority complex.  

Despite these differences, we  
shared a number of things: first,  
our parents were immigrants; second,  

one or both of our parents worked for  

the plantation; third, the plantation  
owned and operated our housing, play-  
grounds, ethnic clubhouses, and the  
general store where we bought all our  
food, clothing, and household goods;  
fourth, except for those few who  
attended parochial schools, almost  
all of the children of plantation  
laborers attended the public schools  
of the community; and fifth, the lan-  
guage and culture of our parents were  
considered “curious" and "exotic" at  
best; their music and dances were “inter-  
esting" and appropriate for May Day  
celebrations and other school pro-  
grams; and their language, mores,  

and values were regarded as irrele-  
vant or incapable of contributing  

to the intellectual growth and devel-  
opment of their children (hence, the  
monolingual and monocultural philos-  
ophy of most of our educational in-  

stitutions).  

I see a relationship between the  
experiences of those of us who lived  
on sugar plantations in those days  
and the experiences of all women to-  
day. We were maintained in separate  
ethnic groups on the plantations by  
the sugar planters or management who  
were white; women here in Hawaii and  
on the Mainland exist in separate  
groups with differing ideologies  
within the women’s movement, but all  
of us exist in a society whose so-  
cial, economic, and political insti-  
tutions are under the control of men.  

Let me take you back a moment to  
look at what happened on the planta-  
tions. During the first part of the  
century, the two largest ethnic  
groups on the plantations were the  
Japanese and the Filipinos. These  
two groups attempted, separately, to  
improve their wages and working con-  
ditions by going on strike. Time  
after time, management was able to  
win out because it could pit one  
group against the other by using one  
group as strike-breakers. As viewed  
by the Japanese and the Filipinos of  
those days, their action of organiz-  
ing and solidifying their own group  
was an act of solidarity. They were,

As the history of Hawaii's labor  
movement shows, these groups were not  
able to win their goals of equitable  
wages and working conditions and per-  
sonal dignity until the groups were  
able to achieve solidarity and work  

together.  

Similarly, in the women's move-  
ment we must expand the meaning of  
"solidarity" from its common use of  
referring to unity of interests and  
responsibility in a group represent-  
ing one ideology to mean the unity of  
interests and responsibilities of  
all women (regardless of ethnicity,  
religion, age, and class) to make in-  
formed choices through their partici-  
pation in education, planning, and  
decision-making in our society.  

Please understand me. I do not  
mean to imply that the various  
women's groups that have organized  
primarily to support a particular  
philosophy, ideology, or perspective  
of women's lifestyles are ineffec-  
tive, irrelevant, or superfluous. On  

the contrary, I believe that each  

group has an effective role to play  
in calling attention to certain  
issues pertaining to women that are  
often ignored by the rest of society.  
On the sugar plantations, the  
Japanese, Filipinos, and other ethnic  
groups were unsuccessful in improving  
their lot as long as they were or-  
ganized along ethnic lines and worked  
only to promote the well-being of  
their own group. Similarly, the var-  
ious women's groups representing  
individually the "feminist," "Liber-  
ationist," or "androgynous" ideolo-  
gies will fail to make the strides  
necessary to improve the status of  
all women unless a serious and de-  

liberate move is made to organize  
the women's groups into a larger one  
that represents women in general.  

As I look at the faces of those  
of us meeting here today, I am struck  
by another problem facing the women's  
movement of Hawaii and probably the  
rest of the nation. Perhaps those  
who are here from the Mainland con-  
sider this to be a wonderful mix-  
ing of the groups that make up  
Hawaii. Let me assure you that some  
groups are not well-represented.  

I see few faces of my sisters from  
the Hawaiian, Filipino, Samoan, and  
Korean communities. I think I know  
why they and others are not here.  
They are too busy today working to  
keep their children fed and clothed.  
They are making beds in hotel rooms,  
cooking in restaurants, selling in  
shops, cleaning fish in canneries,  
and keeping house in Kalihi, Waipahu,  
Nanakuli, and Waimanalo.  

Even if they were not too busy  
staying alive to be at this meet-  
ing, they would probably still not  
be here. That is due in part to  
cultural values they have which seem  
to them to conflict with those of the  
women's movement, or at least what  
they know about it. Their cultures  
place great value on the extended  
family, on children, re-  
spect for elders, family together-  
ness, and so forth.  

What they have heard about the  
women's movement seems to them to  
conflict with these values. And so,  
even though they suffer from kinds of  
oppression that many of us can barely  
imagine, they are not part of our  
movement.  

This, I must say, is our failure,  
not theirs. It is we who have failed  
to reach out to other classes and  
other groups. At the same time, it  
is not just these sisters of ours who  
suffer, but all of us.  

If women are ever to share equally  
in the rights and responsibilities  
that our society offers us on paper,  
we are going to have to join together  
in a united movement that includes  
women of all cultures, all ethnici-  
ties, all classes, and all ages.  

If we are to succeed, it must be  
with the efforts of all women. We  
will not succeed only by sitting to-  
gether and talking in the air-condi-  
tioned elegance of a hotel banquet  
room while most of our sisters are  
toiling nearby, oblivious to what we  
say.  

Thirty-six years ago, the Japanese  
and Filipino workers on Hawaii's  
plantations put aside their differ-  
ences and began working together.  
They changed their destiny and the  
whole Territory of Hawaii benefited  
from their act of solidarity.  

We can change our destiny too, but  
only if we achieve solidarity that  
crosses ethnic and cultural bounda-  

ries.  

Let us begin today.
