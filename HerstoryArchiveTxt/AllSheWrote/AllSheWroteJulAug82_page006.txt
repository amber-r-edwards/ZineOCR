Uhmmmmm, Uhmmmmmm. Fantastic. Once  
again the subculture of women's music  
contradicts comments like "Girls can't  
really play the guitar like that."  

Well, let it be known that that woman  
can really play the guitar. And girl o'  
girl, can she sing. Her voice runs the  
gamut from sounding like an ethereal  
angel to belting it out from the guts  
like a hearty amazon.  

June Millington was here in concert  
at the Women's Coffee House Saturday  
night June the twelfth, and she played  
at the community theatre on Maui, Sat-  
urday night, June the nineteenth. The  
concert on Oahu was sponsored by the  
Coffeehouse Collective and the one on  
Maui was sponsored by Both Sides Now,  
the Maui Lesbian-Gay organization. What  
can I say? I'm a self-proclaimed island  
hopping groupie. Both shows were wonder-  
ful.  

The atmosphere at the Coffeehouse  
was definitely sisterly stimulating, and  
perhaps bordering on the P.I. side of  

things. Even from a feminist perspective  
"I have trouble not objectifying her. As  
a musician she's truly inspired and  
painstakingly practiced. As a performer  
she's captivating, although at times her  
twenty plus years of stage patter came  

across a little too pat. As a producer  
of the likes of Holly Near, Cris  
Williamson, Mary Watkins, not to mention  
herself, she's great. She has a sen-  
sitive ear which guides her in weaving  
a matrix of gentle complexity, which  
commands the listener's attention, cut  
after cut, time after time, again and  
again.  

This diversity is captured both in  
her concerts and on her new and only  
solo album HEARTSONG. HEARTSONG is on  
the Fabulous label, an Olivia subsidiary  
and it is available at the Women's Word  
Bookstore at the University YWCA.  

Her repertoire ranges from laid back,  
with cuts like "Fantasy" and "Harmony"  
to full on rock with "Trouble" and  
"I'll Keep Holding On". The concerts  
blew me away! I couldn't believe the  
fullness of the sound that she pulled  
off as a solo performer. Right from the  
start the audience was all hers. As  
soon as I saw her black velvet pants,  
and white satin bad ass shoes, doing  
for real dips, with her extremely well  
played guitar, I was a goner.  

The audience in Maui was a little  
harder to captivate, but it wasn't long.  
The country atmosphere of the community  
theatre, in all its Victorian splendor,  
captured June's more mellow sounds  
throughout the first set. It seemed to be  
a self-fulfilling prophecy of her song  
Coconut Mentality.  

"Gonna take my neuroses, put them  

all in a jar  

Trade them for beautiful tropical  

stars  

Life on this planet's misunderstood  

God put us all here to make us  

feel good"  

Maybe, it was my deep inhalations of  
that outer island air, or perhaps it  
was the warmth and sincerity of all  
those wonderful women, but whatever, I  
had a great time.  

Congratulations to the sound woman.  
The mix was great, a little quieter and  
a lot cleaner. It was nice to be able  
to enjoy all the lyrics. I've had a tape  
of HEARTSONG since last fall at the New  
England Women's Music Retreat, and it  
wasn't until Maui that I could thoroughly  
enjoy the words.  

Although it started off more on the  

mellow side it certainly didn't end up  
that way. By the end of the evening  

over half the audience local, haole,  
disabled, lesbian, straight, androgynous  
female, male, were dancing below the  
stage. Her song “Heaven Loves A  
Stranger" spoke to the occasion.  

"A world full of strangers,  

invisible lines  

Make me a part of the rhythm  

that binds”  

Her concerts made for two fabulous  
weekends here in paradise. Thank you  
June for your concerts, music, albums,  
inspiration, but especially for leaving  
the mainstream music industry to share  
with us on a more heartfelt spiritual  
level, which is only possible when  
women like the ones on Maui and here  
on Oahu combine all the hard work, faith  
and love it takes to pull off some-  

concerts sometime in November. One  
at the Women's Coffeehouse and another  
on Maui in connection with the Maui-  
County Women's Conference. The confer-  
ence is an annual event consisting of  
two days of workshops and speakers.  
Until then, just to tide you over, pick  
up a copy of June's album at the Women's  
Word Bookstore.
