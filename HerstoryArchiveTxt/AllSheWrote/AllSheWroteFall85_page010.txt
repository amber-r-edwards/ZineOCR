GRADUATION  
IS HERE  

Upon arriving at the Women's Facility  
in February of 1985, I signed up for  
the G.E.D. class. I went in with the  
goal to pass this course before my  
departure, which I felt confident  
would be at the end of the year.  
"Well, I did it." I passed the G.E.D.  
pre-test and went on to pass the G.E.D.  
final test. I must admit I had my  
doubts. It had been about six to seven  
years since I had even thought about  
these subjects. But to my surprise, I  
hadn't forgotten everything. I was  
totally elated to find that I not only  
passed, but with fairly high scores.  

Prior to receiving your high school  
diploma, one must first take the G.E.D.  
course. The course consists of Math,  
English, Social Studies, and Science.  

After taking the G.E.D. test, one must  
then apply for her high school diploma,  
which consists of sending your previous  
high school for copies of your  
transcripts, which then have to be sent  
to the school where the test was taken,  
along with two dollars for the diploma.  

Subsequently, you must wait  
approximately six weeks for the  
results.  

The Women's Correctional Facility has  
been blessed with a wonderfully  
efficient Education Specialist, who  
when aware of the needs, will get right on  
it and produce immediate results. Her  

classroom  

Arthur Waianehea Naeole were married at  
Sunda H.W.C.C.C.  
They ask me how it feels to get married  
in prison. The only answer that comes  
to mind is, “they can lock down my body,  
but never my soul. The mistakes of my  
past, God has forgiven; and at least I  
have forgiven myself.”  
The following are the wedding vows:  
As we enter into the union of marriage  
we two together shall become as one.  
Our love for one another has been the  
test of time;  

On this day I stand before God and man  
to pledge my  
love and my life to the man who holds my  
heart.  
I promise to always honor and obey him.  
I will be loyal to him in my heart as in  
my actions, no matter what the cost.

WAHINE TIMES  

My name is Laura Flating, and she has been  
working consistently at setting up new  
programs that we may all benefit from,  
making sure that you receive the  
credits you deserve. "From all of us  
to you, Laura Flating, we say, Thank  
You."  

We also have a new vibrant and  
understanding counselor, Jo desMarets  
who, recently supplied a cap, gown, and  
photographs so families and friends  
could share in our sense of achievement  
and overwhelming joy. It was indeed a  
thrill to be in that cap and gown  
holding my diploma. I felt as if I  
were on top of the world, with a total  
sense of "there is nothing that I cannot  
do if I apply myself to it." It is  
definitely a joyous occasion when one  
receives a degree, diploma, or any type  
of award for work well done.  

I am truly thankful that I had the  
opportunity to achieve such an award.  
I now have the desire to learn and  
grow. Something that I am sure I would  
have never done if I had not been  
placed in this situation. I sincerely  
wish to thank Jo desMarets and Laura  
Flating once again for making this  
occasion something that I shall  
remember for the rest of my life.  

My advice to those of you who do not  
have your high school diploma is to  

FOSTER GRANDMOTHER: "WHAT A JOY”  

During the month of August 1985, we had  
the privilege of having two Foster  
Grandmothers come into the facility to  
work with us. Throughout this month,  
they taught us how to take a “needle  
and thread" and create something  
beautiful and precious for us to share  
with our families or just to keep in  
remembrance of a special time.  
They not only gave us the opportunity  
to be creative, but they also gave us a  
sense of great joy in accomplishment.  
The happiness we felt was rewarding.  
The girls who participated in the  
program looked forward to being with  
the Grandmothers each day to share new  
experiences. They would often share  
with us the adventures of their every  
day life, as well as some of the other  
experiences they've encountered being  
Foster Grandmothers. We, too, had the  
opportunity to share some of our  
experiences as inmates and how our  
lives affect us daily, with someone we  
felt was listening with a caring heart.  
It was truly a pleasure being with the  
Foster Grandparents, and a great loss  
to see them go. We would like to thank  
Grandma Varaes and Grandma Ferguson for  
the time they spent sharing their love  
and talents with us. And we sincerely  
hope that this is not the end of a
