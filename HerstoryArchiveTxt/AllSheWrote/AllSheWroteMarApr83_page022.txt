Women’s International  
League for Peace and  
Freedom has kicked off  
their STAR million  

signature registration  
campaign.  

The Stop The Arms Race  
protest is to culminate in  

actions at the White House  
in the US and at NATO  
headquarters in Europe on  
International Women’s  
Day, March 8, 1983.  

According to Yvonné  
Logan, WILPF US section  
President, “March 8, 1983  
will be a day in history as  
significant as the end of the  
Vietnam War and the  
granting of suffrage to  
women and Blacks.”  

If you want to be one in a  
million to register your  
protest of the arms race,  
send $1 and your name and  
address to become a

Private hospitals perform abortions (46  
percent of public and 72 percent of  
private hospitals) than do hospitals  
in states that do not provide Medicaid  
coverage (11 and 23 percent).  

Lack of accessibility of abortion  
services remains a problem, even  
though services have expanded steadily  
since the Supreme Court first legalized  
abortion in 1973. About six per-  
cent of U.S. residents obtaining abor-  
tions in 1980 had to travel outside  
their home state and 27 percent had to  
travel outside their home counties, of-  
ten because of lack of services closer  
to home. Travel outside one's county  
of residence is associated with a five-  
day delay in obtaining services, which  
is significant in light of the fact  
that the earlier an abortion is ob-  
tained, the safer the procedure.  

Women of all educational achieve-  
ment levels obtain abortions in about  
the same proportions. Data from 9  
states show that in 1979, about 31 per-  
cent of abortions were obtained by wo-  
men who had attended college, 44 per-  
cent by high school graduates and the  
remainder by women who had not com-  
pleted high school.  

Despite the fact that a small and  
decreasing proportion of abortions are  
performed in hospitals—22 percent in  
1980—and women are turning more and  
more to clinics and private physicians  
when seeking abortions, hospitals  
still play an important role in pro-  
viding abortion services to nonwhite  
women and women with little education,  
particularly in states which pay for  
Medicaid abortions. In these states,  
a larger proportion of public and pri-
