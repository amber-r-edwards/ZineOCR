ALL YOU WROTE

SOLSTICE

Aloha women-:
Excellent features and the paper
just keeps getting better and better!!

a few items:
1) In response to Carol W. Noël's let-
ter in ASW Sept./Oct. from the sap-
phire matrix:

Aloha Carol-

Thank you for your letter of July
1, 1982, correcting us on our assump-
tion that Hawaii does not experience a
summer solstice.

We were given this info last year
by Dr. Bruno Keith and without further
research incorporated this into our wo-
men's gathering lore.

Dr. Keith will be receiving a copy
of your letter. Thank you, again, for
your reply.

Alana Gay for the Sapphire Ma-
trix

Aloha Ladies,
I have no quarrel with the "Elele"*
at all. They realize that we have

O

ou a o) 5 Kailua mid—
May and end of July. Some people call
the time in between Midsummer which
makes the 21st of June Midsummer's Day
or Night.

Germanic priests, like the Chris-
tians after them, tired of the winter's
cold, were always waiting impatiently
for the time that the Sun would move
in their Northern direction across the
flat disk and then suddenly stop with-
out ever being overhead of those north
of 23.4°N. Latitude--their fervent
hopes like the sun, came to a "stand-
still". So they called that "Sonnen-
stillstand." The monks who also be-
lieved the sun was moving translated
that into Latin as Solstice (sol-sun,
stice-stand still).

For us, however, who think that
Old Sol moves twice a year over our
heads, there is no standing still un-
less you accept the fact that the sun
is always standing still, not just for
biblical Joshua but for all scientists.
If you are willing to accept the lat-
ter-day fact, you may celebrate every
day as a solstice.

SUCCESS

Linda Martin's letter to the editor
is so very correct; so much to the
point. In my last fifteen years of
working with women, I encounter this
problem almost daily.

Success is equated with dirty, un-
feminine and the implication often is
that in order to succeed you have to
"sell your soul to the establishment."

The fact that the Women’s Counsel-
ing Clinic has functioned successfully
for the last 12 years without govern-
ment funds is often met with raised
eyebrows and the unverbalized question,
“what are they doing wrong?" Ironical-
ly, those same women, when in trouble
seek help from a successful business--
such as our clinic.

Only once did we have somebody come
to find out how we are making it and
to learn something from our experience.
Sadly, it was not a person from grass
roots wanting to venture herself in a
similar undertaking, it was a repre-
sentative of President Carter. They
were surveying feminist-oriented
health clinics and centers that had
= Organiza-—
That says in itself
how true Linda's observation is, not
only statewide, but nationally.

I could write on this topic on and
on, but rather than go into psychologi-
cal analysis about what it does to us
and how it originated, I would like to
point to practical unpleasant outcomes
of such attitudes.

First, it is extremely hard to get
credibility in the business community.
Whether you want to rent office space
(we do not always have to be housed
in churches or YWCA's!) or get a bus-
iness loan. Being feminist doesn't
mean you couldn't have a nice place
with big space, clean and aesthetic
for women to wait for their appoint-
ments and their kids to play, or a
place they could just drop in. The
lessors always want me as a person
(still female -- so sex is not in
itself the only problem) to sign the
lease rather than me as a clinic
director to sign the same lease. The
thought is: "women's ventures do not
last, are disorganized, disruptive
and hostile" (!!!!) Now a lady doctor
will have a quiet, neat and small
practice (not the expectation of small
unsuccessful practice). It still,
after all these years, is a hassle to
get a lease in the clinic's name.

The same problem (minus the
hostility and worry about hygiene) is
with loans at the bank. It took our
manager hard work to establish a rela-
tively good credit rating (still not
as good as my personal credit rating).
There is the expectancy for women's
business not to succeed.

The second and final thought is
relating to the attitude toward
successful women of women, rather
than the attitude of the outside world.

tions nationally!

Because of the attitude toward
success and achievement, we do not go
out of our way to bring business to
women printers to print our newspapers,
women dentists, women obstetricians,
women-owned flower shops, women-owned
gas stations, women pediatricians,
women therapists, or take classes from
women teachers, bank with women
bankers, women tax experts, women
owners of travel agencies, etc. Men
do prefer to deal with businesses run
by men. The result is women-owned
and run businesses are doubly handi-
capped (by men and women) and there-
fore have a bigger chance not to
succeed.

Of course, such women after
losing business, represent a new
wave of persons bitter toward success.
We see quite a few of them at that
point, in the clinic. With failure,
they also stop being potential models
for you kids--and ourselves. They
fulfill the expectation of the
community that women are not really
serious about business commitments.
They do not become our instructors or
have a business we could benefit from
of any kind. We all lose.

An afterthought---

You might be able to help us find a
new location. After the last 7 years
in an air-conditioned, typical office
building, we are looking for a house.
3-4 bedrooms with a yard, close to
bus lines, nice. It has to be double
zoned (residential and business).

Manoa would be ideal. We will take

FOOD FOR THOUGHT

Aloha Sisters....

I would like to bring the following
quote to the attention of Hawaii Femi-
nists. It was made by a well-known
Big Island attorney who, it is rumored,
also has political ambitions.

The quote is from "Point of Law", a
series of paid advertisements masquer-
ading in the Tribune Herald as informa-
tional articles about the law. The
series is written by Hilo attorney,
Curtis Narimatsu, and this particular
segment appeared in the September 12
issue:

"What if I don't want my daughter-

in-law or son-in-law to get my in-
heritance going to my kids? Well,
sometimes I can't stop that. For

instance, if my son has no money or
property, but he has a wife and 4
kids, and my son is just about to
receive an inheritance from my wife
and me (we died in a car accident
at the same time), my daughter-in-
law might just be able to get some
of that inheritance if she divorces
my son and wants child support and
alimony for herself and kids. And
if she'll use the money to buy dope
rather than feed her kids and
clothe them, I’ll be turning over
in my grave."

How's that for a portrait of a di-

vorced woman with 4 kids??? Just some

food for thought....
