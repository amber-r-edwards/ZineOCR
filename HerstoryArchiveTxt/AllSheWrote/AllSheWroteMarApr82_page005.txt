Wimmin of  
Berstory  

In celebration of Women's  
History Week, March 7th thru  
13th, the following wimmin are  
acknowledged for their contri-  
bution to our collective her-  
story. The attempt made here  
to recognize wimmin is admit-  
tedly quite superficial. How-  
ever, the endeavor is undertaken  
with enthusiasm and a hope that  
no womon is offended by any in-  
clusion and/or omission.  

Some of these wimmin “have  
been praised and awarded, while  
others have been discredited  
and persecuted. But, all have  
one thing in common—and that is  
erasure from history. Yet, de-  
spite this, Herstory lives.  

How many wimmin can name the  
six wimmin who have won the  
Nobel Prize in the fields of  
science in this century? I  
certainly couldn't until reading  
Women Pioneers of Science.  

Marie Curie was the first  
womon to win this award in 1903  
for the discovery of radium.  
She received the Nobel again in  
1911 for her work in chemistry.  
In 1935 Irene Joliot-Curie won  
the prize for her discovery of  
artificially created radioiso-  
topes. Gerty Theresa Cori was  
able to show how glycogen is  
converted to glucose in the  
body and won the Nobel in 1947.  
The Nobel Prize went to Maria  

Theoretical physics, to Doro  
Crowfoot Hodgkin, a crystallog-  
rapher in 1964, and to Rosalyn  
S. Yalow in 1977 for her work  

in medicine and physiology.  

One of the first black wimmin  
to receive a medical degree in  
the U.S. was Dr. Susan McKinney  
Steward. The year was 1870.  

The Susan Smith McKinney Steward  

Medical Society was established  
in her honor to aid young black  
wimmin medical students and to  
document the achievements of  

black physicians.  

During the early days of  
American colonialism, it was not  
uncommon for midwives to be con-  
victed of witchcraft. Midwife  
Margret Jones was the first  
person executed in the Massa-  
chusetts Bay Colony under such a  
charge. Anne Hutchinson and her  
colleague Mistress Hawkins were  
also American midwives accused  
of witchcraft.  

In 1809 Mary Kies had the  
distinction of being the first  
womon ever to receive a patent  
in the U.S. Thirty years later  
Sarah Mather secured a patent  
for the invention of the lamp.  

Both "George Sand" and  
"George Eliot" were wimmin writ-  
ers using men's names because  
in their day they would not have  
been otherwise published. Their  
names are respectively Amandine  

Victoria Woodhull was the  
first woman to ever run for the  
office of president of the U.S.  
It was through the Equal Rights  
Party that she nominated herself  
and sought to have Frederick  
Douglass as her vice-presiden-  
tial running mate. The year was  
1872 and obviously, she was not  
elected. Woodhull and her sister  
Tennessee generated a lot of  
controversy in their day because  
they endorsed free thought and  
exchange of ideas. Both were  
responsible for publishing the  
first full version in English  
of the Communist Manifesto.  

Belva Lockwood was another  
womon who ran for president in  
both 1884 and 1888, also on the  
ticket of the Equal Rights Party.  

When the Portuguese attempted  
to colonize Angola, West Africa,  
in the early 1600s, it was  
Nzingha (Ann Zingha) who mobil-  
ized an army of wimmin to fight  
the invaders. Known as Amazons,  
these wimmin were not successful  
in removing the colonizers, but  
did act as a force of resistance  
for many years.  

Being the radical feminist that I  
am, I want to give special atten-  
tion to the next woman. Mary Daly  
describes Matilda Joslyn Gage in  
the Foreword to the 1980 reprint  
edition of the 1893 edition of  
Woman, Church and State in a most  
accurate manner. "...Gage is a  
major radical feminist theoreti-  
cian and historian whose written  
work is indispensable for an under-  
standing of the women's movement  
today."  

with E > ‘Ca A and  
Susan B. Anthony in the struggle  
for Women's Suffrage. Together they  
authored the History of Woman Suff-  
rage. Gage was also part of a  
committee that analyzed and rewrote  
the Bible from a feminist perspec-  
tive; the result was the Woman's  

Bible edited by Stanton.  

Many wimmin have heard of the  
Stanton Anthony team; "Mrs. Stanton  
distinguished herself as a writer  
and public speaker and Mrs. Anthony  
devoted her time to organization."  
But rarely are wimmin informed that  
it was "Mrs. Gage (who) served as  
the researcher of women's history,  
supplying Stanton with the essential  
information she needed as a writer."  

Even though Gage worked hard  
to secure the vote for wimmin,  
never for a moment did she  
believe that the vote would  
change wimmin's lives in any  
significant way. Gage saw the  
vote as a “means by which women  
would ultimately ‘overthrow  
every existing form’ of the  
institutions of their oppression,  
primarily the Church & State."  

Gage suffered heavily for her  
feminist beliefs. "The government  
intercepted her mail. She lost the  
friendship of most of the wimmin she  
had worked with for the last forty  
years." Her earliest and most inti-  
mate associates...‘abandoned her &  
cast out even her name as an unclean  
thing'...She is still paying the  
price today...for...Gage lost her  
rightful place in history. "Including  
Stanton and Anthony.

no valid groundings for those who  
immigrated to Hawaii in the late  

1800s and earlier part of this  
generation were crucial to the 1920  

fighting tradition of their mothers.  
Nisei (second generation) wimmin  
worked diligently in the 1940s  
to unionize retail clerks. Most of  
the organizing done at the Kress  
Department Store on Oahu was the  
"sole work of Seenataeea."  
Rachel Carson in her Silent  

Spring, published over twenty years  
ago in 1956, provided the world  
with scientific information on the  
harmful effects of pesticides to  
the environment. Silent Spring  
sparked the controversy which  
eventually culminated in the en-  
actment of legislation in the U.S.  
restricting the use of dangerous  
pesticides such as DDT.  

In 1980, Barbara Engl speaking for  
the Catholic Youth Association  
(CYO) before a crowd of 500,000  
people gathered to hear Pope John  
Paul II's final mass in West Ger-  
many “attacked the church for its  
rigid stands on sexual relations,  
celibacy and the role of women."  
This gutsy young womon also demand-  
ed that the church allow wimmin to  
participate more fully in the af-  

fairs of the church.  

Phoolan Devi, India's Bandit Queen,  
proclaimed herself a rebel at the  
age of 24, taking to the ravines of  
Chambal in order to escape the po-  
lice who were seeking her dead or  
alive.  

After being forced into marriage,  
beaten by her husband, fleeing and  
ordered to remarry by the village  
council, Phoolan decided instead  
to take up life as a prostitute.  

In this occupation, she came in  
contact with rebel gangs...one of  

Lucie Dupin and Marian Evans. Wimmin as passive and obedient has which kidnapped and raped her. How—
