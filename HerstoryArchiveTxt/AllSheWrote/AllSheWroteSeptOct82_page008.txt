TIN WOMEN TALKING  

On Sunday, June 11, 1982, at 6:00  
a.m., 750 Tin People plunged into the  
Ocean at Ala Moana Beach Park. Not a  
one brought along an oil can and no  
one complained of littering. Out of  
these Tin People 175 were women, al-  
most three times as many as last year.  

Previous to this promising to be  
eventful day I talked to a few of the  
Tin Women. The versatility of the 3-  
sport challenge of this contest would  
necessitate a very strict and serious  
approach in training. These women  
faced the challenges of an 800 meter  
swim (against the current), a 25 mile  
bicycle ride (among cars, tourists,  
etc.), and a 10 K (6.25 mile) run.  
Indeed, I was curious to know why  
anyone would want to put themselves  
through all 3 events in one day.  

Melissa Aragon (age 27) and  
Phyllis Gomes (age 36) both work at  
the Central YMCA and trained for the  
most part there. When Phyllis was  
first approached about entering her  
immediate response was "Forget it!"  
Later she said, "Training has broad-  
ened all my horizons, you know.  

You get in a rut doing only one  
thing like racquetball."  

The Tin Man seemed to be the  
greatest challenge for both Melissa  
and Phyllis. Neither have completed  
a marathon or done the Tin Man be-  
fore.  

Melissa's first love is swimming  
but momentarily she revealed, "Being  
in the Tin Man has really brought me  
in contact with a lot of people.  
People who before I only said ‘hi'  
to. That's been one of the neatest  
experiences for me."  

When asked what helped them the most, they both had the same an-  
swer, Woody. Woody Cox is the Ath-  
letic Director at the Y. He sched-  
uled clinics to improve their swim-  
ming and bicycling abilities and  
opened doors to weight training,  
turbo-training (10 speed simulation)  
and constantly encouraged and sup-  
ported them. Woody seems to be a  
sincere man when it comes to women  
athletes.  

So then, what helped these two  
the most? For Phyllis, 14 months of  
sports conditioning class and for  
Melissa, 9 months. Sports condition-  
ing class is a great way to strengthen  
cardiovascularly and to tone and  
strengthen muscles. On the day I  
spoke to Melissa she had bicycled  
1½ hours, swam ½ an hour and sports  
conditioned for an hour. Phyllis  
nodded in agreement and added that she  
had done two classes. There went any  
hope of my physical self ever ap-  
proaching what these two women so  
confidently had just gone ahead and  
done. Even then, Melissa encouraged,  
"I was in the same boat as you last  
year. Next year you could even do it.  
Like Woody says, ‘it's all here, you  
just gotta do it.'"  

Phyllis has three children and a  
husband (he had just entered the  
event, too). On top of that she had  
relatives visiting from the mainland.  
"Geez. I wish I were single. Didn't  
have any other responsibilities but to  
myself and could just train," fan-  
tasized Phyllis as her son let out a  
"Mom" retort.  

"Uh uh. I'm single and I tell you  
I just want to party-up! Party-up  
that's all I want to do!" More seri-  
ously Melissa admitted, “It makes you  
think about what you really want. I  

say a lot of times ‘no I can't’ (when  
friends ask her to join them) then  
I'll sway, but I notice how it affects  
me."  

Whereas the Tin Man was a first for  
Melissa and Phyllis, Sue Chu was one  
of the 60 Tin Women in last year's  
tri-challenge. Last year Sue was do-  
ing a pretty good time up until a tire  
blew out on her bike. Unlike the lead  
male contender for '82, Sue rode the  
rest of the course on her rim. Her  
stamina held her to the course even  
after a male runner passed her and  
made the most uncanny remark, "This  
is where us runners show you bikers  
where it's at." Sue vowed to be back  
the following year to try again. Her  
event? You guessed it, bicycling.  
Most of Sue's training has centered  
around bicycling and running long runs  
with her roommate, Ann Zavitowski, who  
was very supportive in Sue's Tin Man  
venture.  

Sue swims during her noon-hour,  
runs after work every other day with  
Ann a total of 25 miles a week and  
they bike about 90 miles a week.  

"I've swum the course about 10 times.  
One thing I've been doing this year is  
that now I go on my ride (about 30  
miles) then Ann meets me down at the  

park. I jump off my bike, throw it in  
the car and we run the course. That  
was the hardest part last year. Your  

legs are just shot.  

What helped Sue the most in prepar-  
ing for the Tin Man? "My coach (Ann)  
and having a part-time job which gives  
me two afternoons free for cycling."  
The pressures of preparing for this  
tri-athletic event are tremendous. So  
many things can go wrong, like a flat  
tire and everything is down the tubes.  
As Sue revealed, "I'm more nervous  
this year than last. I dreamed that I  
forgot my bicycle and woke up in a  
cold sweat."  

All three women agreed that a good  
carbo-heavy meal and a very relaxed  
and restful night before the event  
were essential. That part I could  
even tackle.  

The time finally came. My room-  
mate and I stood watching bobbing  
heads with caps and goggles all  
arranging themselves along a line in  
the water. Wives, husbands, children,  
friends, and lovers stood by in the  
final silent moments before the start-  
ing gun sounded. They seemed so very  
far away and a feeling of helpless-  
ness crept over me. "Bam!" the gun  
sounded and the splash of 750 swimmers  
simultaneously stroking sounded. It  
was on. Soon we were running. By the  
time we got to the point where they  
come out of the water the first per-  
son ran effortlessly out of the ocean.  
Very soon after, one by one they came.  
Some looked a little scared, some like  
wet hens. But they all ran to find  
their bikes or take a quick shower.  

Melissa, Phyllis, and Sue were in  
great shape at this point. And al-  
though Phyllis said she was going to  
backstroke the distance, she came out  
of the water in good time.  

We frantically walked and jogged to  
our car to drive over to Kapiolani  
Park. Every second seemed vital.  
After reaching the park it was only a  
matter of a few minutes and the first  
biker came in. He threw his bike  
down and ran to get his shoes and  
threw off his helmet. The volunteers,  
men and women (but mostly women),  
quickly helped each contestant find  

their bag of changing clothing. Most  
often the bikers seemed rather dis-  
tracted and had to be directed to  
their piles. No one could assist.  
There soon came a constant rush for  
changes and the roped off area was  
soon becoming filled with all makes  
of 10 speed bikes. It was truly a  
biker's dream. A short distance away  
stood a near effervescent woman among  
a few other changees. As she peeled  
off her helmet I recognized Sue. Her  
smile was a mile wide and obviously  
she was very relieved. So was I. The  
bike ride had to have been her great-  
est challenge. Soon after came  
Phyllis and Melissa both seeming very  
intense. The run was going to be  
tough for Melissa because of her sore  
ankle.  

And so they clamored on and soon,  
one by one, came on in to cross the  
finish. Every one of them had  
accomplished a very great challenge of  
fitness. The first woman to complete  
the course got rounds of applause and  
much cheering (as did the many women  
after her). The women seemed to be  
the real crowd pleasers. After all,  
women in the Tin Man?  

Afterwards, there sat Sue with ice  
wrapped around her knee which has al-  
ways been troublesome. She was happy  
as well as her crew around her. Not  
too far off was a very happy Phyllis  
jokingly saying, "Never again!" "No,  
I'm going to train even harder for  
next year." Phyllis, the oldest of  
the three was intact, on her feet with  
child in arms. Melissa was in the aid  
tent getting a cold wrap around her  
ankle. She did surprisingly well for  
what must have been a very painful 10  

mile run.  

On a weekend when a woman broke the  
1 mile record in 4 minutes something,  
I realized that we would one day wit-  
ness a woman winning an event such as  
this. It doesn't really seem very far  
off. Especially for women with Sue  
Chu's attitude, "I do my best to beat  
any man I can on the bicycle."
