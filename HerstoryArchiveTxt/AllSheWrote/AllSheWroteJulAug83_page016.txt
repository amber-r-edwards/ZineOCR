JULY/AUGUST

MARGE PIERCY'S STONE, PAPER, KNIFE

I found Marge Piercy's latest col-
lection of poetry, Stone, Paper, Knife,
to be largely a disappointment for al-
though I found her use of imagery de-
lightful, I found that this alone was
not enough in many cases. I did find
several poetic gems scattered through-
out the book but these were mingled
with a number of oppressively bitter
poems about having been walked out on
by a rather heartless male character.
I feel that I recognize this character
from one of her earlier poems entitled,
"The Friend" (he's the one who made re-
quests such as ‘cut off your hands,
they're always poking at things, they
might touch me‘ and ‘burn your body,
it is not clean and smells like sex'
while I, in the poem, said 'yes').

It seems to me that many women who
set out to critically look at a work
by a feminist (or, at least, female)
writer, feel obliged to note only the
work's good points, completely forsak-
ing its lesser qualities. This may be
seen by many as an attempt to make a
political statement such as, "Goddess
knows, there are few enough feminist
books on the market! I don't want to
shoot anyone down. However, to me, a
critique is a personal opinion, not a
final judgment on the merits of an
author or of her work. With that pre-
face in mind, I will turn now to the
book.

As I said, in the book Piercy exer-
cised her skillful use of imagery and
by this transformed the obvious into
the subtle and the subtle into the fan-
tastic. Some fine examples of this
are:

HOME BEFORE MORNING

Home Before Morning is the extreme-
ly moving autobiographical account by

Linda VanDevanter of her experience as
an Army nurse in Vietnam from 1969-
1970. Her highly personal story touch-
es on her adolescence, nursing school,
being shipped to Vietnam and her vali-
ant attempts to piece her life togeth-
er again after spending a year working
in the 71st Evacuation Hospital near
the Cambodian border.

VanDevanter describes many aspects
of what life in Vietnam was like for
our medical personnel. She touches on
everything from MAS-CAL (mass casualty
situation) to MED-CAPS (Medical Civil
Action Patrols). She tells us about
being heartily welcomed as FNG (fuck-
ing new guy), working literally for
days at a time without sleep, undergo-
ing rocket attacks by the Viet Cong,
the need for support from family and
friends at home, the need for loving
and supportive relationships there,

from "Ragged Ending"

—Every middle-aged woman abandoned
by her longest love blows

in the night wind like torn
newspapers, shredding.

At two a.m. I become Sylvia
Plath; at three a.m. I turn
into Anne Sexton; at four
a.m. I turn into my mother...
from "Dis-ease"
...With a sore toe, every stroll
through a crowded room of peril.
Strangers feel impelled to tread
on you. Every object you pass near
or touch is going to fall straight
down...

from "Ascending Scale"

...the flat dark eyes of a woman a
few years older caught

me on the brambles, tearing at my
orderly advance with briefcase,

the scarlet gauze of my new dress
floating around me

like love. I winced at her dishev-
eled anger, the heat

bruising her, the want shining out
in waves of black light...

There are numerous such passages, each
containing images so rich you feel
that you could bite into them and be
nourished for a week—images you feel
that you could live or have lived.
What I found disappointing, however,
returns to the pain expressed when the

on when she finally makes it home, and
the lack of understanding and support
she encountered upon her return.

As VanDevanter discusses the evolve-
ment of her mental outlook she gives
the reader a great deal of insight in
to how the war shaped the emotional
and psychological health of those who
made it out alive. She went to Viet-
nam with a great sense of patriotism
and purpose. She volunteered (al-
though not all women who were sent to
Vietnam did) as a humanitarian gesture.
She wanted to heal. When the reports
about anti-war protests began to fil-
ter in, she felt betrayed. Later she
came to a mental state of rebellion
against the military establishment.
What emerges from this is a powerful
anti-war statement. In the beginning
of her disillusionment she envies her

big-footed man, who was trampling over
her heart, tramped away at last, look-
ing for other prey. I do not condemn
her pain for all feeling serves to re-
mind us that we are alive, yet it was
too much pain without resolution. To
me it was as though someone were bleed-
ing to death and instead of reaching
for a bandage they could only marvel

at all the blood.

This sensation was particularly
strong in the first portion of the
book, "Mrs. Frankenstein's Diary"
where she describes, in depth, the
pain of the break-up. Once Piercy,
as poet, and myself, as sympathetic
reader, managed to slosh through this
section we remained sticky with the
pain for the remainder of the book. I
can understand, of course, that heart-
break is not so simple that it can be
turned on and off like a light switch.
Yet, when I am standing knee-deep in
tears, particularly someone else's
tears, I cannot help but look around
for a mop.

I suppose the reason I'm disappoint-
ed is that I wanted Piercy to say some-
where in the book, "Yes, I hurt today
but I'll be better tomorrow," some-
thing that would make my sympathy seem
to have been more worthwhile. What she
seemed to be saying again and
again throughout the book was, "I hurt
today, I'll probably still hurt tomor-
row and the rest of the week doesn't
look too promising either."

father for the "moral war" of his gen-
eration. She surpasses this stance,
however, and later mentions a much
loved Catholic priest who says, "I
know the communists as well as I know
you. You are both the same. The on-
ly real villain is the war. I can on-
ly hope that God forgives us all for
allowing it to continue."

VanDevanter herself was a victim of
her own patriotism and of the sexism
of those who recruited and advised her.
It was assumed that a woman would nev-
er be placed in a dangerous situation,
even in the middle of a war. They
were wrong. After her return home,
most people (even Vietnam Vets) forgot
that women were there. Now as the
National Women's Director of the Viet-
nam Veterans of America and through
her book, Home Before Morning, Linda
VanDevanter is trying to correct that
misconception.
