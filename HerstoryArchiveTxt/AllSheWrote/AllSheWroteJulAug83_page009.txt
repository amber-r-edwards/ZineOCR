HAWAIIAN FEMINISM

Upon hearing the phrase, Hawaiian  
Feminism for the first time, my immedi-  
ate reaction was to ignore it, confirm-  
ing that academicians have a need to  
label every experience. Following  
longer reflection, I noted two aspects  
that need to be present in such a Femi-  
nism; power and empowerment, and the  
ability to give value to our experi-  
ence as island women and at the same  
time resist that which oppresses us.

Women in Wai'anae have for a long  
while asserted control over their life  
situations by defining violence  
through their own situations whether  
it be personal or institutional. Per-  
sonal power comes to these women  
through naming the violence and then  
resisting it. Hawaiian women in parti-  
cular know and feel the victimization.

A woman shares, "I never thought  
about being Hawaiian. I must have  
thought to myself that it was not very  
cool to be Hawaiian. It is not that I  
wasn't raised in that kind of environ-  
ment. Only all that was happening out-  
side of my family group said to me,  
'You are Hawaiian, therefore you are  
also stupid!' I did not want to be  
stupid so maybe I chose being Chinese  
over being Hawaiian."

Still another shares her pain. "I  
should be Hawaiian, I should not feel  
Catholic. When I see my culture play-  
ing a role in sharing with Christianity,  
then will I have a universal way of looking at my  
faith."

AND VIOLENCE  

As one woman puts it, "When I went  
to Kaho'olawe, I responded to that  
place in a way that I did not know I  
could respond. I responded to it in a  
very Hawaiian way...Things became  
alive for me, the Hawaiian in me I  
guess was activated."

It seems that we are being called to  
move beyond patriarchy to a cultural  
liberation. A liberation for all peo-  
ple, Hawaiians, Haoles, etc. Empower-  
ment is the process by which women rea-  
lize their personal power. This pro-  
cess could lead to alternatives to  
live with each other within and with-  
out the system. Hawaiian Feminism  
could get us there but it needs to in-  
clude humility on the part of the domi-  
nant culture. That is, the dominant  
culture needs to define the violence  
committed against minority groups so  
as to have a share in the cultural  
liberation. But before it can happen  
the dominant culture must listen with  
empathy. And the Hawaiians need to be  
able to call them forth out of true  
Aloha. They will not be able to put  
down their defenses until we complete  
our task as women, Hawaiian or other.  
And that is to humanize this technocra-  
tic western world: that alienates us  
from each other.

If we fail, there comes a danger  
for feminists to unconsciously put  
down "styles" outside their experi-  
peoples' life situations.

Feminists must be responsible for  
the reaction we cause in others. That

means, our purpose is not to do vio-  
lence to one another. And we do not  
hold up the total truth. But we do  
respect others and are not interested  
in taking advantage of a situation for  
selfish reasons or gains. Although we  
are insistent on maintaining a humane  
relationship with those we must resist  
and confront. Power-over-others is no  
respect for individuals or the way  
they express their opinions. In truth,  
power-over-others buys into disrespect,  
male/patriarchy. Is it our intent to  
become like that which oppresses us?  
Nonviolence can help us attain this  
level of resistance and liberation.  
It opens up to us a new horizon of  
shared pain. The enemy suddenly be-  
comes vulnerable. We are able to ap-  
proach them. We are not afraid to  
call people out into a win-win situa-  
tion. We will win because the oppressor  
is no more. And the oppressor wins be-  
cause he/she is set free. Each exer-  
cises decision, choice, and power.  
Nonviolence moves us to call forth  
each human person beyond their present  
ability. To live a life of nonvio-  
lence is far from being passive. It  
entails preparation, reflection, con-  
templation, and discipline. To inter-  
lace nonviolence with Hawaiian Femi-  
nism strengthens the possibility for  
liberation and puts it in the context

de Helen will perform her adapta-  
tion of “The Yellow Wallpaper” by  
Charlotte Perkins Gilman, as well as  
the one-act “Della Malloy” by Rebecca  
Gordon at the Women's Center on July  

2 at 6:00pm. “Wallpaper” is a clas-  
sic feminist short story written in  
1888, the story of a woman's mental  
breakdown, it was wrenched out of  
Gilman's own life, and is unique among  
her works for its authenticity and  
power. “Della” is a contemporary com-  
edy about a middle-aged mother of sev-  
en who hopes to make her entire family  
rich by writing an autobiographical no-  
vel with something for everyone.
