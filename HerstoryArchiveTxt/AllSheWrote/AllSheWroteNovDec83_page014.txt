COMMENTARY

FEMINIST BLINDNESS AND MARY MAXWELL

by Bruce Powell Majors

Mary Maxwell recently handcuffed
herself to a chair outside Tennessee
Governor Lamar Alexander's office.

Mrs. Maxwell was barred from operat-
ing a child care service in her home,
and was frustrated by her attempts to
see public officials, including Govern-
or Alexander, about changing state reg-
ulations of child care. She had been
trying to see Alexander for two months.
Having traveled from Memphis to Nash-
ville, the Tennessee state capital, a
drive of several hours, Mrs. Maxwell
said: "It's terrible to have to go
through this just to see somebody
whose salary I help pay. All I want
is 20 minutes of his time."

Mrs. Maxwell and a friend cared for
five to seventeen children in her
East Memphis home before a local chan-
cellor issued an injunction against
her for failing to abide by state laws
governing child care centers. Maxwell,
who charges $32 per week per child,
was enjoined because her home has no
sprinkler system, fire alarm, or jani-
tor-style sink made especially for
mops. One can only wonder if the Ten-
nessee state government will soon re-
quire prospective parents to have spe-
cial sinks in order to get a license
to bear children.

ALL SHE WROTE

Unfortunately the problem is not
only the Tennessee state government.
Last year at least two day care entre-
preneurs—Susan Suddath of Damascus
and Sylvia Thorpe of Potomac—were
closed down by the state of Maryland.
Ms. Suddath had sent children into the
public schools at achievement levels
two years above average, but she was
closed down because she kept as many
as twenty children at a time, more
than the state government allows in
one home. Ms. Thorpe was forced to
close when she could not afford the
$2000 fire detector unit the state re-
quired her to use, instead of her four
smoke detectors. The year before, in
Washington, D.C., Judith Heinz's child
care center, "The Shoe," was closed
down under an ordinance prohibiting
home enterprises.

These are not isolated cases. Ac-
cording to Kathleen Murray, a lawyer
at the Child Care Law Center of San
Francisco, such regulations are com-
mon. The state of California, for in-
stance, requires that day care centers
meet the building codes required of
schools. Among other things, this

means having separate boys' and girls'
restrooms, both of which must be acces-
sible to people in wheelchairs.

It is quite appropriate that Mrs.
Maxwell should handcuff herself to
the Governor's reception area furni-

THE RAMIFICATIONS OF CUTBACKS ON PSYCHIATRIC MEDICAL CARE & WELFARE AGENTS

co

Recently medical payments for psy-
chiatric care were drastically re-
duced. This is a tragedy and a vio-
lation of human rights. While our
government spends billions to ad-
vance technology and war, it is ne-
glecting the needs of the mental
health patient.
robots and missiles are being built.
This also violates the well-being of
the entire human community.

Many of the problems of the mental
health patient are situational which
can be remedied with proper treatment
and care. These problems come out of
a lack of environmental support or
loss of employment. Emotional and
economic deprivation cause some to
resort to crime/suicide or become dys-
functional.

As I walk around Honolulu every day
I see and hear the destitute. What
will our tourists think seeing people
wandering aimlessly, unbathed, hungry,
without proper mental health care,
without purpose or meaning in their
lives.

Other mental health problems are
due to hereditary factors which result
in chemical imbalances of the brain
causing one to act out inappropriate
behavior. If given proper treatment
the patient sometimes recovers or the
illness is put into remission thereby
allowing one to become a productive
loving member of society.

Crisis can happen in any socioeco-
nomic group. Anyone can at some time
become overwhelmed or overstressed and
may need the services of the mental
health system. Maybe you've never
been a victim of circumstance; never
had to use the services of the mental
health system. Don't think it can't

happen to you!

The free clinics are overloaded and
many of the workers/therapists are con-
flicted due to the increase in the com-
munity which take them away from the
regular scheduled patients. The cut-
backs of the present administration
are responsible for the predicament.
While Medicare has no limits for me-
dical care, psychiatric treatment is
limited to $500 per year per person.
Good mental health directs a person
towards taking care of her/himself and
the individual is less likely to end
up on the medical rolls. Thus, deny-
ing a person of financial rights to
treatment in the long term costs Medi-
care and society considerably more.

This commentary is not only a man-
date to Medicare, HMSA and Insurance
Agencies; it is also a request to
therapists to compromise with Medicare
and Insurance Agencies by lowering
their fees and charging less to lower
income people.

If you care about yourself, loved
ones and have compassion for humankind,
write now to the President urgently re-
questing that he apply the cost of two
or more missiles to the Federal psychi-
atric Medicare fund and the State's
welfare agencies. Also write the
president of your insurance agencies
requesting they lower the cost of pre-
miums and increase coverage. Thank
you.

ture, Government regulations have
been handcuffing women entrepreneurs
like her all along.

But there is another form of re-
straint in the picture, a limitation
that is not physical or legal, but
ideological. As feminist author Jean
Bethke Elshtain put it: "For feminists
to discover in the state the new "Mr.
Right” and to wed themselves thereby,
for better or worse, to public identi-
ty inseparable from the exigencies of
state power and policy would be a mis-
take."

But feminists have so wed them-
selves. Their thinking is fixated on
how to expand the government bureaucra-
cies that employ and empower their
leadership, on how to elect liberal
Democrats who will give them their
slice of the ever smaller economic pie.

This wedding has left them in ideo-
logical blinders—they do not see Mary
Maxwell or her problem, because she is
not asking for a share of government-
ally distributed wealth. She is asking
for the freedom to produce services of
real value. If the United States had
a real feminist movement, interested
in the true liberation of women, Mary
Maxwell would not be in chains.
