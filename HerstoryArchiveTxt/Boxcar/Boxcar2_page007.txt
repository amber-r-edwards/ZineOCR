continued from inside  
resort city I met a traveling hang-glider nut  
who, as a PR stunt, skimmed over bored hotel  
guests twice daily for excellent pay. He also  
had a kit bag full of slide shows and lectures  
on a variety of topics. In one sense, all vaga-  
bonds are performers, demonstrating ‘a life-  
style that people will notice and be interested  
in. If you're lucky, these audiences will sup-  
port your trip, because basically they ap-  
prove of it—they need you to survive so they  
can keep alive their own secret hopes for a  
freer life.

Skilled Work  

The next category of job opportunities in-  
volves practical skills. Auto repair, for ex-  
ample, is a standard underground service  
business. Take your tools with you. Much re-  
pair work is relatively simple: tune-ups,  
brake service, adjustments, minor repairs  
that can be done easily without a shop or  
rack. Direct advertising is frequently the best  
way to advertise your skill. Simply make a  
big sign and hold it up by the roadside tell-  
ing people what you can do for them (VW  
TUNE-UP $10, BODY MASSAGE $5). Al-  
ways stop to assist a disabled vehicle by the  
road. The poor person is usually excruciatingly  
eager for help and may offer to recompense  
you if you can get the car moving again,  
or even just offer good advice. And if  
not, so what—it’s nice to be humanitarian.  

Appliance repair is a similar service that  
can be sold from the street, by bulletin board  
ads, or by canvassing. Furniture repair and  
refinishing is another. Anyone who has any  
knack with carpentry, plumbing, or electric-  
ity can get mucho quick work in most Ameri-  
can communities.

Working the Carnies  

“Copping a joint” on the carnival circuit in  
America does not mean getting loaded, at  
least not in the usual sense. A “joint” is a car-  
nival game, and with a little luck any nomad  
or vagabond can get a job in a traveling car-  
nival or circus as a joint-man or “agent!”  
Agents get a percentage of the gross, so in  
order to make it they've got to be good rap-  
artists and jivers to keep the rubes spending  
shekels at their joint. Depending on one’s  
luck and skill, it can pay up to $400 per  
week—and is thus the premier job on the  
midway. But you can also find carnival work  
as a ride operator, or miscellaneous labor-  
er/jack-of-all-action.  

How does one find work in a carnival?  
First you have to find the carnival. A maga-  
zine called Amusement Business, put out by  
Billboard, gives schedules and dates of all  
major carnivals in America. It’s sold at carni-  
vals, too. Generally speaking, the carnie  
season runs from March through November.  
They start in the South, go north in midsum-  
mer, head south again in the winter.  

Carnies almost always have some open-  
ings, because the turnover is high. Many  
casual workers stay only a few days, or a few  
dates in different towns, and then move on.  
There are no qualifications other than look-  
ing reasonably tidy—washed and sober.  
Some good friends of mine who owned a  
“Monster Show” and toured with carnies for  
years said they'd hire anybody who looked  
like they hadn't just fallen out of a freight car.  

To get a job, just stroll onto the lot and ask  
anyone about work possibilities, or find the  
trailer where the carnie boss hangs out. If  
you get a job, expect to work hard; often it's  
twelve to fourteen hours a day, seven days a  
week. The pay is about $75 to $100 per week  
for a ride operator. The job is strictly cash-  
and-carry, with little or no concern for such  
niceties as social security numbers, real  
names, etc. Transportation from place to  
place is provided (one way or another); and  
you get a place to sleep (usually on the  
ground by a ride, in a truck, whatever—so  
bring your sleeping bag). No food is pro-  
vided. But most carnies have a cook shack  
serving cheap meals to employees, and you  
generally get a daily draw (typically $5 or  
so) on your weekly salary for this purpose.  
Employers may hold back some money from  
your pay as an inducement for you to hang  
around and work some more, and as a handy  
humanitarian stake when you do go.
