During my saddest days the sight of a quite
ordinary landscape, as long as it was receding
rapidly to right and left, and as long as it was
veiled from time to time with a ribbon of smoke
that got torn on the thorn hedges, acted all the
same on me like a health-giving tonic. | Calete

translated by Enid McCleod.
