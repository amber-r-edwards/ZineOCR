ASIA & WESTERN EUROPE

out sleep, and so sensitized that the foreign
air around me tattoos my skin, foghorns will
chant, lighthouses glitter and work will jump
out of the sea. It is when I am scouring the
streets bent on finding suitable employment

that temporary work plays a more elusive
character. Occasionally I find it. The latter
is a less magical pursuit of work, but it
does have a few more practical guidelines. I
can't tell you how to actually get a job,
here are a few ideas on where to look in
Europe and Asia.

This is Boxcar's second appear-
ance, so we're celebrating, with an
expanded issue.

Ed Buryn calls it Vagabonding,
John Wilcox says those who do it are
Nomads. Isabelle Eberhardt wrote
about vagrants and wanderers. Ex-
pressions and borders change but
the object, the desire to go else-
where, is constant. Some will read
themselves away, others take a train.
What is there, should you wish to
take advantage, is the potential for
great liberty winking lasciviously at
you from down the road.

This issue contains a special re-
port on working while you travel. In
preface to these articles, it's hard to
generalize and self-defeating to at-
tempt too much categorization. The
numbers of travelers, and their rea-
sons for going or staying, have man-
aged to remain nonspecific, and,
fortunately for us, mysterious. In
addition, to the info given here, re-
member that most travelers overseas
stop and work when they need to,
regardless of laws and permits. Here
then is some on-the-level advice
concerning accessible employment
(most of it casual) in the U.S., Western
Europe and some parts of Asia.

Working and traveling are normally held
to be opposites, or at least mutually exclu-
sive, since travel equates with leisure while
work equates with ugh. As with most oppo-
sites (for example, men and women), some
form of marriage is possible, and that’s when
the sparks really start to fly. One form of
union between traveling and working—and
a particularly powerful one—is called vaga-
bonding. It's also a technique for conscious-
ness-raising that disproves two widely held
notions: one, that traveling costs a lot of
money; and two, that work is no fun and hard
to find.

Vagabonding is what you do with an abun-
dance of wanderlust but a shortage of wan-
derbucks. A vagabond is simply a free and
high traveler; that is, someone not entangled
in arrangements, and someone willing to
spend energy instead of money. The vaga-
bond's definition of travel broadly includes
all experience en route, including working
in order to keep en route. In any case—and
make no mistake about it—traveling with
little or no money is a lot like work, but al-
ways more exciting, loose, and open-ended.
And the jobs you get to earn mobility-money
can also be fun, especially since you know
they're means, not ends. Thus, in vagabond-
ing the distinctions between working and
traveling are not so clear, because that’s
what the vagabonding experience is all
about anyway: breaking down artificial dis-
tinctions between yourself and others, and
between the various self-limiting roles within
