Alliance brings feminism to Tucson radio

By Karen Brown

Tucson Women's Radio Alliance, a  
group of women committed to feminist  
radio in Tucson, is more than a year old,  
and has been broadcasting on KXCI  
Community Radio, 91.7 FM, since  
November.

The organization dates to a workshop  
during the Take Back the Night week in  
October 1982, on building alliances  
between women of different sexual  
preferences. An unexpected number of  
women were interested in continuing  
the workshop.

“Our support group was discussing  
the negative portrayal of women in the  
media. After protesting movies like  
“Taboo” (about incest) and listening to  
speakers such as Ann Kerwin-Yakota,  
we were ready to create our own  
strengthening, positive images of  
women in the media, and specifically to  
work on getting a program on the (then)  
up-and-coming community radio  
station, KXCI,” said Nadine Ostapenko,  
member of the Alliance.

For nine months, while KXCI prepared  
to go on the air, the alliance also was  
preparing. Four women were getting  
trained technically; others did outreach  
and organizing. The group makes  
decisions by consensus and its purpose  
has expanded to build alliances between  
women of different races, classes and  
sexual preferences.

They argued with the station  
management about their initial assigned  
time of 1 a.m., then 12 a.m. Sundays.  
Finally, they were scheduled for 9 p.m.  
Sundays.

Each week the show includes 10  
minutes of news. “It's so exciting,” says  
Annette Holdman, a member of the news  
group, “to define news and report it from  
a feminist perspective. We try to cover all  
local women’s events and to get national and  
international news, but it's tough. We're  
encouraging women to realize that what  
they say — their goals and the decisions  
they make — are news. It's a  
revolutionary idea.” There’s also a  
calendar of women’s events each week.

Sometimes the major portion of the  
show will be a mixed bag of women’s  
music, usually not heard on the radio.  
Other times it will be a combination of  
music, interviews, and information on a  
particular theme.

Recent shows have been on: Alix  
Dobkin, June Millington, Women’s  
Peace Camps, Love Songs, Women in  
Northern Ireland, in theater, in classical  
music, and in jazz.

Gail Paul is a member of the Outreach  
group. "We'd like other women to be  
involved in radio too,” she says. “We'd  
like to go to every women's group in  
Tucson and talk about radio. We'd like to  
know about their news and events.” At  
least 20 groups already are working with  
the alliance, which is helping them put  
on their shows in its time slot.

The alliance is composed of about  
15 active volunteers. Debra Barnabee is  
one of the technicians.

“The support of the community is  
really necessary,” she says, “because  
the show is being done for the  
community. If we don’t know what you  
think about the show, what you like and  
don't like, we don’t know how to change  
it.”

Tucson Radio Alliance news group.
