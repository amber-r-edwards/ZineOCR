The Fourth Annual Reggae

Comparable worth: can it be determined?

(Continued from page 3)

The state of Washington has appealed to
the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
in San Francisco. The case is expected
eventually to reach the U.S. Supreme
Court.

Agreeing with Tanner, Council
member Tom Volgy said that our society
consistently undervalues women.

“We have always rewarded male

characteristics more than female's,”
Volgy said.
Another important point in the

controversy stems from the idea of
comparing dissimilar work: secretaries
with gardeners, librarians with
engineers, clerks with custodians. Can
objective comparisons be made?
Some say no.
“Refuse collectors, bulldozer

operators—I don't see how you
can compare them to an office worker,”
said Tom Price, director of operations
for the city of Tucson. “It's more of a
macho thing. They're a breed all their
own and don't want to be compared,” he
said.

Others, like the National Committee
on Pay Equity, say jobs can be
compared. Using the analogy of apples
and oranges, they contend that there are
characteristics of fruit, such as calorie
and vitamin content, that make them
comparable. The comparable worth
system attempts to “pay the orange and
apple equally for giving us the same
amount of energy... and does not pay
the orange less simply because it is
not red,” the committee claims.

Cost is another factor often raised
against comparable worth. The money

needed to pay wages to more than half the labor force
in the United States, say the opponents.
To do so would mean economic
disaster, they add.

Those in favor of comparable worth,
however, say that cost has never been a
legally justifiable reason for
discrimination. Proponents also claim
that its feasibility has been
demonstrated in San Jose, Calif. The
city has adopted the comparable worth
system and is doing well economically,
according to reports from its mayor and
city council, despite predictions of
financial difficulties that were made
before the system was implemented.

“The money is never there,” Volgy
said. “It's a matter of priorities. If it’s a
priority, the money will be found to fund

it.”

The question of whether comparable worth justifies its benefits remains to be
seen. That it is one of the biggest issues
of the ‘80s is unquestionable.

“The bottom line here is that the
people we have on the job get paid
what's fair based on the job market and
what the public can afford," said Price.

For Volgy and others like him, it's a
very difficult issue. Comparable worth
gets to the heart of how we value people
in our society, Volgy said.

“There have not been any objections
raised that address the real issue,” said
Volgy. “It's an issue of economic
injustice. The value of that is never
cheap but it's very important.”
