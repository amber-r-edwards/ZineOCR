Spiritual quest bolsters author’s feminism

By Patricia Jimenez

Flight of the Seventh Moon, The
Teaching of the Shields; by Lynn V.
Andrews; Harper & Row, Publishers,
San Francisco; 1984.

For many years now, women have
been seeking power: power to choose
and make their own destinies, power
over their own bodies. For some, the
path to power lay in a belief in feminism.
However, for Lynn V. Andrews, author
of the book Flight of the Seventh Moon,
The Teachings of the Shields, feminism
was not enough. Andrews was in
Tucson in April promoting her most
recent book, a sequel to another book
titled Medicine Woman, soon to be a
motion picture.

“With the feminist movement I knew
what I didn't want. But I didn’t know what
I did want,” said the 39-year-old author,
art collector and filmmaker.

Dreams and a search for an old Native
American object called a marriage
basket, finally led Andrews to Manitoba,
Canada and a Cree Indian woman
named Agnes Whistling Elk.

It is there in the wilderness that
Andrews, a resident of Beverly Hills,
Calif., begins her search for answers and

Sonia Johnson: running hard

By Robin Hiller

On the Saturday that Arizonans were
choosing Gary Hart over Walter
Mondale and Jesse Jackson, Sonia

their votes and
dollars to her presidential bid.

Sonia Johnson came to national
attention when she was excommunicated
from the Mormon Church for her
support of the Equal Rights
Amendment.

She says her platform is one of
equality, peace and economic justice.
She is running on the Citizen's Party
ticket.

Johnson says the two major parties
are the guardians of the status quo.

“We are all working for these rich,
white, heterosexual men. Women
should not work to get rid of Reagan just

to replace him with Mondale.”
Johnson told the small group that our
planet will be destroyed if we keep
building up our nuclear weapons.

She said that if she were elected she
would fly to Moscow her first day in
office and listen to Chernenko.

“Men don't know how to listen,” she
said, adding that all of our leaders are
men, and when they meet they don’t pay
attention to one another.

“How can they negotiate with each
other when they can’t even hear one
another?”

When she returned from her meeting
with Chernenko, she said she would
reduce our nuclear arsenal by a third.

What would she demand of Russia? It
wouldn't matter if Russia reduced their
weapons. “The people of the planet

society arrive at wisdom? In reality, a
woman is not powerless, and neither is a
man. Because of lies, it is difficult for a
woman to pick up the bow of authority in
her own life,” she says.

Andrews learns about herself and the
world that Whistling Elk shows her and
is finally initiated into the Sisterhood of
the Shields. She is a medicine woman.

Andrews said she was sent to be a
“bridge between the Indian and the
white worlds.”

“It is of great concern to the medicine
people that the world is terribly out of
balance. People in touch with Mother
Earth know that she is suffering great
pain. They were training me to bring the
message back — how full of beauty the
world is,” she said.

Andrews said she believes more
people are willing to listen to her
message.

“The world has really changed... has
really been opening up. Because we
may be blown off the face of the earth,
people are being forced to take a look at
themselves," she said.

Is it difficult being a messenger?

“I don’t know why you ask that,” she
says laughing and shaking her curly
blonde hair. In a long blue skirt, white
blouse and low-heeled red pumps,
Andrews does not quite fit the
stereotypical idea of a medicine woman.

“I'm living with a foot in two worlds,”
she says.

would get on their knees and weep in
gratitude.”

“Either war is finished or we are,” she
repeated.

“Rape in a little, tiny sec a Ab
Tucson, how can we stop war all over the
world?”

Sonia Johnson feels that the hope lies in
women's culture, which offers a
different way of looking at the world and
solving problems.

“Women are a gift to this planet.” They
solve problems by cooperation and non-
violence. “These are the qualities that
are needed at this time in history,” she
says.

“Men are not just going to give us our
rights. But we [women] are worth our
human rights and our human rights are
worth dying for.”

have allowed Kathleen to file an
injunction against the caller.

The bill, H.B. 2073, allows persons to
file an injunction against someone who
engages in conduct which seriously alarms, annoys or harasses the person.

The bill was sponsored by the
Republican Majority Leader, Burton
Barr and the Democratic Minority
Leader, Art Hamilton.

Rep. David Bartlett (D) said that one of
the people who testified in favor of the
bill had been followed for two years by a
man she had gone out with for a few
weeks.

The bill, recently signed by the
governor, allows the victim to file an
injunction against the harasser. If the
injunction is broken, criminal charges
can be filed.
