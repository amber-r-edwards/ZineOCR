Portrait of the artist as a health hazard

Women work as artists in shops,  
studios and craft collectives. They also  
work at home much more often than in  
most other occupations.

The work in the home is, therefore, a  
hazard to family as well as the worker  
herself. Skills such as photography,  
pottery, metalworking, painting, textile  
printing, and woodwork, among others,  
carry significant health risks, and many  
women do this work as a means of living  
rather than just as an occasional hobby.

It is extremely important for artists to  
educate themselves about the health  
risks associated with the materials that  
they use, since they are often self-  
employed and do not have the benefit of  
a health and safety program in their  
workplace. Many health problems may  
go unrecognized as job-related for  
artists unless they are careful to  
understand the toxic potential of the  
substances they encounter, and inform  
others, particularly their health-care  
providers, of their exposures.

The discussion which follows is but a  
brief selection of a few of the hazards  
known in various art forms. Many  
toxicities may not yet even be  
understood, with the proliferation of  
new chemicals, materials and  
techniques in the arts.

Photography involves the use of  
chemicals such as silver nitrate and  
glycol ether, both of which can produce  
brain damage and birth defects.  
Mercury compounds used can also  
cause neurological damage. Developing  
compounds have many toxic  
substances, including cresol, bromides,  
benzyl chloride, chlorine, dimethyl  
hydrazine, dinitrophenol, quinones, and  
others. Bromides, especially, have been  
associated with birth defects. Many of  
these other chemicals may cause liver  
damage.

Metalworkers and jewelers use  
solders that may have cadmium, which  
can cause severe breathing problems  
and bone pain associated with cadmium  
poisoning. Grinding, polishing,  
sanding, or buffing may expose workers  
to dusts which can cause scarring of the  
lung. Using asbestos work blocks may  
expose jewelers to lung cancer. Metal  
fume fever is an acute illness resulting  
from inhaling metal fumes in the process  
of welding in metal sculpting.

Pottery involves exposure to silica  
containing clays which may cause  
silicosis, another scarring disease of the  
lungs. And the use of metallic glazes  
may cause heavy metal poisoning. Lead  
poisoning, for example, involves the  
nervous system and may cause severe  
abdominal pain.

Painting may be hazardous,  
particularly if the artist puts her brushes  
in her mouth, as some do, or if solvents  
and cleaners are used in poorly  
ventilated places. The dyes in paints  
may be toxic in different ways, and  
solvents cause liver damage. There is  
one theory adrift that Van Gogh's severe  
depression resulted from lead poisoning  
from his paint.

Textile printing may involve the use of  
hydrosulfite powder in the mixing of  
permanent vat dyes. This substance can  
build up in the lungs to cause chronic  
bronchial irritation, emphysema or  
severe scarring of the lungs. Dyes  
contain many hazardous compounds,  
and specific ingredients must be  
recognized and researched.

Woodwork may cause inhalation of  
dusts that can cause lung damage or are  
highly allergenic, producing serious  
skin rashes. Liver-toxic or cancer-  
causing solvents and glues are used in  
woodwork also.

Many arts involve exposure to  
multiple substances, and it is beyond the  
scope of this column to make a  
comprehensive review of the hazards.  
But the severity of the above described  
sample hazards should alert artists to  
the need for great care in the handling of  
their materials, and make them aware of  
the potential toxicities of each material  
they use. Some general guidelines for  

protection include:

- Use toxic substances sparingly and  
in the form least accessible to the  
body, if possible.

- Take care handling and storing  
materials. For example, cover jars to  
prevent leakage of fumes, carefully  
seal containers of fine powders.  
Use good personal hygiene such as  
careful hand-washing, avoiding  
putting hands or substances in the  
mouth, keeping fingernails short  
and well cleaned.

- Avoid eating or smoking in work  
areas, and never dispose of toxic  
wastes in sinks or areas used for  
eating.

- Use personal protective clothing,  
gloves, and face masks to keep  
dusts and chemicals away from the  
skin and out of the lungs.  
Adequate ventilation and frequent  
cleaning of work areas are essential  
to minimize the collection of toxic  
material.

- Find less toxic substitutes whenever  
possible, e.g., never use asbestos.  
But remember, “natural” materials  
are not necessarily non-toxic.

- Consult a chemical hazards  
textbook or call a poison control  
center whenever you may have a  
question about a substance.
