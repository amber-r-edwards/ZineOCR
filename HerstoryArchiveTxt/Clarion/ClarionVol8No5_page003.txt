Women lawyers gaining fast, dean says

By Louis Varga

“Women in the legal profession have
done remarkably well in a relatively
short period of time,” says Dean Paul
Marcus of the University of Arizona's law
school. To illustrate his point, Marcus,
speaking at a luncheon for the Arizona
Women Lawyers Association recently,
cited some recent American Bar
Association statistics.

Last year women made up 20 percent
of all lawyers in this country, a notable
increase from the 3 percent figure in
1970. Marcus foresees an even greater
influx of women into the practice of law
in the next few years because, in line
with national trends, the number of
women applicants to the UA law school
is running about 10 percent higher than
men.

While the statistics reveal rapid
progress for women in law, Marcus
urged restrained optimism, suggesting
that it is not yet time to sit back and
count the victories, but a time to seek
parity in numbers and compensation for
women lawyers.

Harassment

By Robin Hiller

For five months Kathleen had been
getting obscene phone calls. The calls

always occurred late at night,
sometimes as early as 10:30 p.m.,
sometimes as late as three in the

morning.
It was always the same man, and even
though she could not place the

disguised voice, it was vaguely familiar

to her.
He knew details about her that only a
friend could have known.

judgeships, the number of women
judges is not representative of the
proportion of women in the profession
and in society,” stated Marcus. “There
are only 50 women judges in the federal
court system and just 600 in the state
systems.”

These numbers translate into less
than 8 percent of the federal judgeships
and less than 5 percent on the state
levels. Marcus says this is not very
significant penetration for nearly 52
percent of the population.

Further disparity is discovered in the
area of earnings and the practicing bar.
A mere 12 percent of the practicing bar
are women, earning a median income of
$33,000 per annum, while their male

colleagues have a median income of

$53,000 a year.

“A most disturbing statistic,” Marcus
said, “is that 65 percent of all male
lawyers do not have a female colleague
in their offices.” He said this statistic,
more than any other, reflects the major
obstacle to women entering the legal
field, “the lack of awareness of the skill
and value of women in the profession of
law.”

All of this is subject to dramatic
change as the number of women
lawyers in this country continues to
increase at growing rates. “Lawyers, as a
profession, are engaged in areas of
great significance to society as well as
the legal system,” Marcus said. Also, he
says that as lawyers exert a major
influence on many phases of our lives,
the true impact of the ever-increasing
number of women lawyers on society
and its laws is still a few years in the
future. Marcus predicted “profound
change in not only economic parity, but
in the power structures of the ABA
(American Bar Association),
legislatures and courts” due to the
women who are becoming lawyers.

Following his speech, Marcus
responded to questions of local interest
by pointing to the progress made at the
law school in the past few years.

“For next year we had two openings
for ‘tenured-track’ faculty positions and
filled them with the best qualified people
available — two women,” said Marcus.
Also, the editors-in-chief for the law
journal — a position of achievement and

respect — for the next two years are
women.

It was suggested to the dean that the
legal profession may experience a male
bail-out similar to that in the fields of
teaching, counseling and social work as
the number of women in those fields
increased. He rejected that as a
foreseeable trend in law.

In closing his remarks to the audience
of about 50 women lawyers and a few
men, Marcus urged continued
optimism, yet conceded hard work
ahead for women entering the legal
profession.

He said, “The job market is tough and
competitive enough without making
gender an issue, although, realistically it
still is. The profession needs to
acknowledge that for too long the
creativity, intellect, value and
contribution of a major portion of our
population has been ignored.” With
these closing remarks the audience was
in total agreement.

Comparable
worth: apples

and apples?

By Elaine Guilf

Comparing the job of a gardener to a
secretary may be like comparing apples
to oranges, but that doesn't mean it can't
be done.

Comparable worth continues to be a
controversial subject. Its far-reaching
impact is spurring people to take stands
on both sides of this complex issue.

Some emphasize the problems that
will be created by implementing a
system that attempts to equalize pay for
jobs held primarily by women with those
often held by men. Others focus on the
issue of justice and how we, as a society,
value people.

Comparable worth is a system that
assigns points to jobs according to such
factors as knowledge and skills (job
knowledge, managerial and communi-
cation skills); mental demands (latitude
for independent judgment and ability to
solve problems); accountability
(freedom to take action); and working
conditions (physical effort, hazards and
discomfort). Jobs are then compared to
points received instead of strictly on
their value in the job market.

Those who question comparable
worth say that the system of assigning
points to a job is an artificial one.

“It is a system that has significant
problems,” said George Gray, assistant
city manager for Tucson. “It is a
departure from traditional collective

bargaining, and where the comparisons
are internal and statistical and not based
on the job market.”

Proponents of comparable worth say
that this is a more objective system.
They contend that the job market
discriminates against traditionally
women’s work.

U.S. District Court Judge Jack Tanner
agreed that the job market works against
women. In the landmark case in
Washington state, he ruled that the state
practiced “direct, overt and
institutionalized discrimination against
its women employees.” Even though
these women were being paid the going
rate for the work they did, Tanner
recognized the need for a more
objective evaluation of women's work.
