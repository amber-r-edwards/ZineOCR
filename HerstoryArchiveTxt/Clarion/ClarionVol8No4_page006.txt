IRA isn’t the only way to shelter income

We've been asked what other ways

there are to shelter income from taxes.
Here are some other methods:
Keogh Plans - The self-employed
person (full time or part time) can
contribute to a Keogh Plan (or HR 10).
The amount contributed can now be as
much as 25 percent of earned income
with a maximum contribution of $30,000
each year. This is in addition to an IRA
(Individual Retirement Account).

IRA and Keogh contributions are tax
deductible and their returns remain
untaxed until you start withdrawing for
retirement when you will, most likely, be

in a lower tax bracket.
An important point to
about Keoghs: They must

remember
be

established during the calendar year.
They may be funded up until the time
you pay your taxes.

For example: You could open your
1984 Keogh in a mutual fund for $1,000
(according to that fund's initial
minimum investment). If you earned
$20,000 in 1984, you could invest
another $4,000 into your Keogh (plus
make a $2,000 IRA contribution) before
filing your tax report next April.

If you work for a company, there are
the traditional type of pension, profit-
sharing and savings plans. There are
also some newer plans (such as CODAs
and ESOPs which we will deal with in
our next column).

Cash or Deferred Arrangements - or

CODAs are employer-sponsored, tax-

deferred investment programs into

which employees can contribute part of
their before-tax pay. In conventional
savings or thrift plans, workers'

contributions are after-tax dollars.
CODAs are sometimes called Salary
Reduction Plans or 401(k)s for the
section of the tax code that covers them.
Qualified Voluntary Employee
Contribution Plans - or QVECs are like
IRAs except they are sponsored by the
employer. You can have both a QVEC
and an IRA. Sometimes these plans are
called VDECs for Voluntary Deductible
Employee Contribution Plans.
Employee Stock Ownership Plans - or
ESOPs allow workers to accumulate
stock in the employing company and
have tax benefits as well.

Phoenix women’s board plays many roles

By Janice Hayes

PHOENIX — The Tucson Women’s
Commission has a sister commission in
Phoenix. Created in July 1975 to report
to the Mayor and Council on affirmative
action for women in the city
organization, the Phoenix Commission
On The Status of Women was
established as a permanent council
advisory board in 1978.

The 11 members, Phoenix residents,
serve three-year terms. One member is
selected annually by the Mayor and
Council to serve as chair.

The Commission is charged with

advocacy for women in:

® Reviewing the city's affirmative
action.

® Reviewing and solving women’s
problems as they relate to the city.

® Developing goals and objectives for
improving the status of women in
Phoenix.

® Evaluating special
agencies.

® Recommending individuals to serve
on city standing committees, advisory
boards and ad hoc committees.

¢ Assisting in efforts to provide
information and educational programs.

Some commission projects have
been: A series, “Women’s Work,” on
KTSP-TV highlighting non-traditional
jobs for women, a non-traditional
seminar for managers, and endorse-
ment of a foster-parent program
through the Department of Economic
Security.

The commission plans a fall
workshop about violence against
women, both domestic and street
violence.

The commission serves as a clearing
house for women’s interest groups and
special projects of the city of Phoenix

that impact on women. It works closely

with an in-house women's issues
committee, established by the city
manager, to develop programs for

female employees of the city.

Included in the commission's goals
for this year is coordination with the
Tucson Women's Commission. Such a
contact might pay dividends for women
in both cities.

Phoenix Equal Employment Opportun-
ity Office.
