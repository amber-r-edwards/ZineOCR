Being a woman anchor in Tucson:  
how many good years left?  

By Nancy Taylor  

As television professionals —  
men and women — agree there is a  
double standard. TV newsmen grow  
wiser with age; women become  
unattractive.  

One local former anchorwoman  
was told — when she was hired —  
that she would have to quit at age 40.  

When TV newswoman Christine  
Craft, 38, of KMBC-TV in Kansas  
City, Mo., was removed from her  
nightly news co-anchor position,  
she sued. Craft charged that her  
employers made their decision  

because they viewed her as too old  
and too unattractive to be on the air  
and not deferential enough to her  
male colleagues. She also  
complained that her male co-anchor  
got paid more than she.  

Craft was the first woman evening  
news anchor at KMBC. At the time of her  
hiring, she says, she was assured that  
nothing would be done to alter her  
appearance. When the ratings declined,  
the station changed Craft's makeup, hair  
and clothing styles but made no effort to  
modify the appearance of the man who  
sat next to her each night delivering the  
news.  

Craft won two jury trials against  
Metromedia, Inc., which owned KMBC  

at the time. The first award of $500,000  
was overturned on appeal. The second  
award of $325,000 — for fraud — stands  
unless Metromedia appeals again.  

Craft's well-publicized allegations  
have caused both controversy and close  
examination of the merger between  
television and journalism. As an  
entertainment medium and a news  
medium have become one, the question  
has arisen as to which has tended to  
dominate nightly news broadcasts.  

Tucson newswomen in their 30s are  
concerned — but hopeful — about their  
future in the medium as they approach a  
decade of life that has thus far not been  
kind to women TV journalists.  

Many Tucson newspeople seem to  

feel that the Craft case has heightened  
awareness of sex discrimination in their  
industry and, in that respect, was  
beneficial. There are, however, those  
who disagree.  

“I think she (Craft) did a lot of harm,”  
says highly rated local news anchor  
Patty Weiss of KVOA-TV, “because she  
has made it appear that management  
only wants glamour.” Weiss believes  
that when the ratings of Craft’s station  
went down, it was probably because  
Craft lacked charisma rather than  
glamour, but management failed to  
realize this and focused on the issue of  
glamour.  

How important, then, is the “glamour”
