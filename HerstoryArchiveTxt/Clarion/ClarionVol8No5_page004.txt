Office machines: stress, strain and worse

In an earlier column, we reviewed the
health risks of clerical work as it has
existed for many years; and we
promised a future discussion of the
additional hazards that will be
encountered with the introduction of
new technology to the office setting.

The explosive development of the
computer age with the shifting of
clerical work to greater utilization of
office machines, video display terminals
for computers, and new work patterns
create many new hazards, which are
inadequately understood.

New machines include photocopiers,
word processors, and, of course,
computers. Xerox machines emit ozone
gas, which can cause disturbances in
vision, respiratory problems,
headaches, and some drowsiness. Many
machines now have filters that can
eliminate this problem. Toners used in
xeroxing may contain impurities known
as nitropyrenes, which may cause birth
defects. These also may be eliminated
by the purification of the inks and you
should ask the company that supplies
your equipment about these safety
measures. Word processors are helpful,
on the one hand, as they alleviate the
stress of repetitive retyping of corrected
material.

However, workers are often hired to
use this equipment full time, and care
must be given to prevent back strain
through improper seating, eyestrain
with inadequate lighting, and stress.
Monotonous routines should be

interrupted with frequent rest breaks
and physical exercise programs are

lookout for chemical or physical risks
connected with its use.

Video display terminals (VDTs) for
computers are a large area of concern
with new office technology. Touted as

“the clean industry” electronics
equipment manufacture and use have
been associated with some quite serious
and unpredicted hazards, about which
many questions still exist. Many serious
chemical hazards are involved in the
manufacture of electronic equipment,
but discussion of these is beyond the
scope of this article. Issues to be
addressed for this equipment use in the

adequate contrast between figures and
the screen.

Preventive measures for eye
protection should include use of light

absorbent materials in VDT-use areas,

elimination of fluorescent lights,
alternation of VDT use with other tasks,
teaching of eye-focusing exercises,
elimination of glare sources, selection of
equipment with good contrast and
control of flicker, and periodic complete
eye exams (at least every two years
following pre-placement exams). A 15-
minute rest break is recommended at
least every two hours; a break every hour
is necessary for VDT operators under
high visual demands or with repetitive
tasks.

Physical strain of the back and neck
may occur with improper seating or poor
keyboard placement for VDT operators.
Adjustable furniture for VDT terminals is
very desirable. Emotional stress can
result from repetitive and monotonous

work, but additional questions have
been raised about the effects of chronic
exposure to low-level radiation and
radiofrequency fields, which can lead to
behavioral changes such as impaired
memory, irritation, fatigue, and sleep
disturbances. Such “microwave
sickness” has also been cited as a
possible cause of reproductive hazards.
This issue is one which needs a great
deal of careful study.

There are an estimated 10 million VDT
workers/operators now in the United
States, and the industry may employ 40
percent of the work force in the near
future. It is worthwhile to pay particular
attention to the health risks associated
with this work and do everything
possible to foresee and limit problems
before they get out of hand. For a more
in-depth look at this subject, read Office
Hazards published by Tilden Press, 1737

office setting include radiation hazards,
eye damage, physical stress and
injuries, and mental and emotional
stress.

As with television sets and microwave
ovens, a certain amount of radiation is
emitted from VDT equipment. Studies
so far are inconclusive on the health risk
in this area. However, equipment should
be checked periodically to determine
whether an excessive amount of
radiation is being produced because of
some defect.
