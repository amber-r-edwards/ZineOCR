Being ‘old’ and an anchor in Tucson

(continued from cover)

of television news? Is it really a more
important issue for women than for
men?

Does a woman TV journalist need to
show “deference” to men both on and
off camera to survive in a highly
competitive and sensitive business?

One third of the nation’s news anchors
are women — of those, approximately 3
percent are over the age of 40 and none
are over 50. In contrast, about half of the
men anchors in this country are over 40,
and 16 percent are over 50 years of age
(according to Hodding Carter of PBS's
“Inside Story,” which plans to air a
segment dealing with women and the TV
news business on April 6 at 9 p.m. on
KUAT-TV).

Such statistics may indeed be
representative of an industry that
permits men but not women to grow
older and yet retain visibility. Those
same statistics may also provide
credibility for Craft's complaints of
image before journalism.

“Yes, there’s a double standard in
television news because it’s too often
perceived in this business, as the old
saying goes, that ‘men grow
distinguished while women grow old,’"
laments KGUN-TV weekend news
anchor Nina Trasoff, age 37.

No one can be sure that today’s under-
40 newswomen will still be on camera in
15 to 20 years. Most TV professionals are
sure, however, that neither the public

nor news management teams would
want a 50-year-old woman to anchor
nightly news in the current national or
local markets. But they do believe that
the situation is changing for the better.
Tucson newswomen express some
confidence that by the time they are 50,
attitudes will have changed enough to
allow them to remain on the air — but
none is certain.

Weiss, 33, who landed her first
television job in 1971 as a morning news
anchor at KOLD-TV because “they
didn't dare” put a woman on evening
news, does not believe that a woman in
her 50s could be a nightly news anchor
anywhere in 1984 unless she is “an
extremely exceptional person.”

“It’s historical bias against women,”
explains KGUN-TV executive news
producer Jeff Bartlett, “that has kept
women from advancing in any numbers
as producers and into management.”
Until women make the executive
decisions, Bartlett believes, male
management teams may continue to
make sure that only younger women are
seen on camera.

“There's no reason,” Bartlett
continues, “that a woman in any given
(news) market in this country can't grow
older, grayer and more distinguished as
a man is allowed.”

As the woman newscaster’s age is still
a crucial aspect of her success in TV
news, so it seems is the very closely

linked issue of her appearance. The
general consensus among media
professionals is that newspeople should
not have features or a clothing style that
draws a viewer's attention away from the
actual content of the news.

“No news director wants the audience
concentrating on an anchor’s looks,”
explains David Williams, The Arizona
Daily Star television critic, “However,”
he continues, “a person doesn't have to
be Jackie O. or Paul Newman, either.”

Women in television news are often
required to have several different outfits
and hair styles, thus allowing men to get
away with more, says Williams. “There's
a double standard in news, but then
there's a double standard in everything,”
he concluded.

Former newswoman Sharon Kha
expresses the opinion that “appearance”
isn’t enough to carry a news show,
but appearance and content are equally
important and “are also equally
important for men and women.”

Weiss agrees that appearance will
always be part of TV news but also
thinks it’s often overplayed as an issue.
“None of us (the KVOA-TV Channel 4
news team) could win a beauty pageant,
but we do well and always have high
ratings — we're proof that appearance
isn't everything,” she says confidently.

Weiss may be right. In the most recent
television news ratings taken in
February and released in March, her

station regained the number-one spot it
had lost last November to KOLD-TV
Channel 13. In addition, Weiss has just
signed a new three-year contract.

her to deal with “tough” issues like drugs
or hardened criminals. “How can you let
her do that?” they ask. What she doesn’t
know is whether most of those calls
come from men or women.

The issues that Craft raised with
KMBC-TV in Kansas City are issues that
journalists here in Tucson and
everywhere are now examining.
Whether one believes that Craft has
caused a long-neglected subject finally
to be given its proper attention or has
done a disservice to television
journalists, the questions she raised will
continue to be discussed and further
explored — and, perhaps after a fair and
accurate examination, will provide a
clearer picture of the future of women in
television news.

important

for a TV anchor?

“In your selection of a TV newscast,
how important is a reporter’s or anchor’s

appearance?”

Clarion volunteer reporter Jan Spray
asked this question of persons at
random.

Their answers follow.

Berta Wright, of Berta Wright Designs

“If the individual's appearance is the
basis upon which a person's ability
would be measured, we would be
reaching an all-time low.”

Erni Cabat, artist and author
“Appearance is not at all important.
Walter Cronkite’s handling of that issue
in the March 11 Parade magazine article
by Cleveland Amory expresses my
attitude as well as his own. Cronkite is
quoted as saying, ‘the anchorperson

“cult thing was awful.’ He also mentioned

a trend in anchorpersons toward ‘the
handsome and the beautiful, the well-
coiffed and the vacuous.’ It was a good
article.”

LaVerne Eckels, Director of Plaza 3
Academy and Talent Agency

“Appearance is very important. I
believe that 99 percent of us make a
visual acceptance before listening to
what people have to say.”

Richard L. Gomez, D.D.S.

“I think it is of significance, if they
have a pleasing appearance. This would
definitely sway my opinion of them, and
make me more interested in hearing
what they have to say.”

Amanda Castilio, librarian
“Their appearance is not as important
to me as what they have to say.”

Mark Bahti, Indian arts dealer
“I’m more interested in the format of
the news presentation than in irrelevant
frills.”

Darla Masterson, artist and educator

“It doesn't matter as long as she or he
is a competent reporter. Some other
people might have a little magic, but that
has nothing to do with their
appearance.”

Ralph Simons, Tucson businessman

“Yes, appearance is important but not
the most important factor to me. It
doesn't matter whether it’s a man or a
woman, and they don’t have to be super
attractive. But it’s always nicer to look at
somebody who looks nice than
someone who doesn't.

Leslie Miller, Tucson City Magistrate

“A reporter's delivery of the news, and
ability to relate the information
accurately as well as concisely is what
would determine my choice. I feel,
moreover, that too much time is spent
entertaining rather than informing the
viewers.”

Laura Wilkening, Vice Provost of the
University of Arizona =
“Appearance is not important at all!”

Margo Garcia, Environmental and
Natural Resources Planner

“Appearance is not terribly important.
What is important is the tone of voice
and the language used. And they should
appear alert.”

Charles R. Liberty, Municipal Fleet
Supervisor, City of Tucson

“On television, on a scale of one to
400, appearance would rate 50. If I didn’t
like to watch the person, I would listen to
the radio.”
