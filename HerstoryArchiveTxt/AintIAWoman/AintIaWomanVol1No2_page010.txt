This weekend several sisters  
went to the Christopher Street  
Gay Liberation Days in New York  
City, the first birthday of the  
Gay Liberation movement. One  
year ago, when the Stonewall, an  
after hours gay bar in NYC, was  
raided, the homosexual community  
reacted with open anger and vio-  
lence against their oppressors.  
Since that time gay women and men  
in over 300 cities have discarded  
their lifestyle of closet schiz-  
ophrenia and are developing new  
consciousness.  

We stayed at the Lesbian Cen-  
ter (also known as the Church of  
The Holy Apostles) which was pro-  
vided by women from Lesbian Lib-  
eration, a new coalition of gay  
women who found they weren't al-  
lowed enough freedom in the male  
dominated Gay Liberation Front.  

On the first day of the cele-  
bration there was a workshop on  
Lesbianism and Feminism or as it  
was called by some The Place of  
Feminism in Lesbian Liberation.  

On Saturday evening gay women  
gathered at the center for a com-  
munal supper. We had a conversa-  
tion with two women from Daugh-  
ters of Bilitis, a national homo-  
phile organization, who had just  
returned from Bettendorf, Iowa  
where they talked to women there  
about starting a chapter of DOB.  
The thought that there are 100-  
150 women in Bettendorf interest-  
ed in coming together is really  
exciting. Right-On sisters!  

We also met four sisters from  
Washington D.C. and discussed  
two divisions between people:  
Male/Female and Gay/Straight. We  
mostly agreed that the biggest  
gap was female/male and that gay  
women should only ally with gay  
men in so far as the relation re-  
mains unoppressive, however, one  
GLF woman, who strongly hopes the  
Gay Liberation Front doesn't  
split along sex lines, thought  
that gay people who feel a com-  
mon oppression must stick togeth-  
er to fight it.  

Politically we found ourselves  
more or less together with the  
sisters from Lesbian Liberation.  
However, the All Women's Dances  
on Fri. and Sat. nights pointed  
out to us how differently we re-  

a Woman? (%)  

Our of THE Closets & INTO the street  

late socially to each other in  
the Midwest. We never dance with  
each other because there are no  
places in Iowa City where gay  
women can be together. It was so  
beautiful seeing women dancing  
with each other and meaning so  
much to each other. Coming as  
total strangers, we also were in-  
volved in the feeling of commu-  
nity giving us the impression that  
it was the fact that we were wo-  
men and human beings and not  
close personal friends that was  
the basis for this affection. We  
were wondering if the reason we  
could express our feelings for  
each other was because we weren't  
inhibited by social taboos that  
keep women apart. These dances  
are a defiant political statement  
by all who dance: We will love  
whom we please.  

On Sunday there was a trium-  
phant march of thousands of homo-  
sexuals and lesbians on Sixth Ave  
to a Gay-In in Central Park. We  
marched arm in arm under a banner  
of Lesbians Unite and chanted:  
"Out of the closets and Into the  
streets" to the imprisoned on-  
lookers.  

The meeting Friday night was entit-  
led "The Lesbian in the Feminist Move-  
ment" and was to me one of those sad  
experiences where people divide them-  
selves from one another either due to  
misunderstandings or alienation. I  
think both of these factors entered  
into this meeting. The gay people had  
gathered to discuss their reaction to  
Ti-Grace Atkinson who had spoken to  
the Daughters of Bilitis the night be-  
fore. The fact that Ti-Grace had not  
been able to deal with lesbianism, and  
for that matter many other women in  
the feminist movement, caused a great  
deal of hostility to appear. Gay women  
felt that Women's Liberation people  
were more concerned with day care,  
equal job opportunities, and a general  
equal respect status that is now occu-  
pied by men. They want to work toward  
this, and still live with a man.  

Thus, as the gay women see it, women's  
Liberation is for straight, married wo-  
men who will continue to stay straight  
and married. The needs of the lesbian  
don't coincide with these demands.  

Gay oppression both legally and so-  
cially is of their utmost concern.  
Straight women in women's liberation  
still being unable to deal with les-  

July 10, 1970:  

a  

bianism aren't any different than  
any straight women who take part in  
the oppression of other women.  
Therefore many of the gay women don't  
want to ally or work in any part of  
the feminist movement. Also the  
concept and structure of role play-  
ing in the gay world was come down on  
extremely hard by the feminists. This  
attack of lifestyle alienated many  
of the women, one because that was the  
way they dealt with living and com-  
batting their own oppression, and two  
because they see that married women  
also revert into their own form of  
role playing which they call security.  
This struck many of the gay women as  
being hypocritical.  

As I sat there as both a lesbian  
and feminist I felt a real sorrow and  
hopelessness that this division had  
to occur. Perhaps it is inevitable  
and imperative that les-  

bians decide between the two move-  
ments. However, at this point I  
don't see that it is. Lesbians are  
women, and by definition an intri-  
cate part of women's liberation. They  
are women who do not need men and  
therefore are removed in their per-  
sonal orientation from the male domi-  
nated society. They are also strong wo-  
men who have lived with an obvious and  
blatant oppression for the entire ex-  
tent of their sexual life. Lesbians  
have experienced women's oppression  
simply because they don't need men and  
haven't been "protected" by being  
treated as a privileged sex. The op-  
pression of women loving women is a  
powerful political tool. If women can  
live without men then they cannot be  
dominated by them. And when male  
dominated society prescribes that wo-  
men cannot love women, it is merely  
using a technique of all oppressors,  
divide the oppressed and they will  
always be weak. Women who have been  
taught that lesbians are subhuman,  
that they are perverted or inferior  
are merely placing the values of the  
oppressors into their own heads and  
thus reinforcing the divisions among  
all the oppressed women. This is why  
it is imperative for all women to  
deal with lesbianism, with homo-  
sexuality where the primary love both  
emotional and sexual is directed to-  
ward a person of the same sex. It  
is not good enough for straight wo-  
men to say that they do love women  
and then turn to give their ulti-  
mate love to their oppressor.
