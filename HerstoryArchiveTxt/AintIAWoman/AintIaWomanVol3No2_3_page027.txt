The fairy follies, (I still say it
means faggots when you say fairies, not
dykes.) came to Iowa City last weekend.
There were violin players, singers, har-
monica players, folk dancers, guitarists,
stand-up junkie comediennes, and one
outstanding bull whip-cracker. Not to
mention all the wandering children and
assorted roadies and stage hands.

The Iowa City Women's Community had
a local talent show for the benefit of
Sparky Daycare Center, charging a quart-
er a head. This was the second annual
event with the new added attraction of
no-men-allowed. (YEAH!) It was quite
well-attended and enjoyed by all, con-
sidering all the mistakes made by the
co-emcees, and the disappearing music
stand, thanks to 4-year-old Alice, (re-
member Alice?) And oh, yeah, false
starts and an un-coordinated lighting
system. I loved every minute of it!

The show was followed by a women's

dance. Though some women left before

the dancing began, there were still a-
bout a bazillion women dancing and car-
ousing until they dropped. (These
dances are held fairly regularly for
all women at 10 S. Gilbert, check the
Women's Center for dates and times and
bring your own records, etc...)

The talent show, entitled, by the
way, "DORIS DAY MEETS THE HEARTBREAK OF
PSORIASIS ON MARS," reaped a grand to-

tal of $20.00, (are you listening, folks?)

Alternative Readers Service wishes to announce that the first issue of
the Eroggie Hollow Gazette, a six hour tape is now available for free, to the
blind, visually handicapped and functionally illiterate.

The first issue contains readings from the Liberation News Service, The
Whe Zargh Catalogue, The Mother Earth News, The Rolling Stone, and several o-
ther radical or underground sources.

Our purpose is two-fold. We are available to read anything the blind or il-
literate are hassled with getting through conventional channels. We also hope to
become a focus for an embryonic handicapped person's liberation movement.

We need lots of publicity. The group of people we hope to reach is not
presently part of any organization so we must depend on readers of the underground
press to turn their blind friends on to our service. We would appreciate a small
continuing spot in your er. We would be ecstatic with
could purchase book requests and etc.
