WHY THIS ISSUE IS LATE...  
Iowa City has had two flash  
floods in the last month or  
so, and our office was under  
water. We lost a lot of pro-  
duction materials, precious  
volumes of back issues, a  
large portion of our library  
and furniture. Also, the de-  
lay has resulted in a bot-  
tleneck in the mailing of  
orders and correspondence.  
We still have to re-locate  
and re-organize, so we ask  
you to bear with us, and to  
help us out if you can, it's  
been a hard-lucks birthday.

OUR PRINTING POLICY  

The AIAW collective makes all de-  
cisions on what we print. We try to  
print articles that we agree with, and  
as a whole, have the paper represent  
the politics of the collective. We do,  
however, decide at times to print ma-  
terial submitted to us that we may  
have some disagreements with, but that  
we basically think are helpful and  
worth reading. We do not edit any art-  
icles, but sometimes we don't feel  
right about printing certain articles  
without commenting or responding to  
them in the paper to make our own views  
clear. If we wish to do that we will  
communicate privately with whoever sub-  
mitted it to be sure it's all right.  
To decide what articles come from  
outside, we have started signing AIAW  
on collective articles and articles by  
individuals from the collective.  

People keep writing us nice let-  
ters and we want to print them. It  
would save us a lot of time if you  
would indicate whether or not you want  
us to print it. We never use anyone's  
name unless we know she wants us to.
