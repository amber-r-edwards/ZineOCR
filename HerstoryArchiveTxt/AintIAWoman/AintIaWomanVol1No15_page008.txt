A Woman a

On The Subway N.Y.

is there a grownup way  
to say it  

what's up there  

over my head  

how long till  

there's a bathroom  

is it ok for me  

to hold your hand  
funny noise  

made me think of  
something I don't  

know the name of  

the city again  

makes me feel like  

a little child again  
with everything  

two feet above my head  
like a child  

but not the child I  
grew up as  

running in green space  
trees ballgames +  

a one floor school  
where I got A's  

not that but the  

child I felt like  
sitting in a tenement  
window solitary  
huddled part of neither  
the outside scene  

nor the inside warmth  
the child no one saw  

I was  

the child I feel is still me  

it's like double vision  
seeing double is a trick  

like the way my mind  

monitors  

everything I do:  
now I'm dialing the number  
now I'm seeing the image  
of me dialing the number  

this goes on  

as I'm writing it down  

& even, seeing the image  

of me a writer  

like double vision  

seeing double is a trick  

there's the real me  

doing the real thing  

& simultaneously  

& not far away  
here I am watching  

myself  

my one scene  
is real  

the other is  
an image  

& seeing double is a trick  

is there some way not to go  
through all these things twice  

only one scene  

is real  

pick your image  
you have to trust  
your judgment  

you have to live in your world  
can you see both sides  

can you believe one  
is closer to you  
—  

one coming into focus  
one fading  

it's like double vision  
seeing double is a trick  
be tricky or be tricked  

coming into focus  

I meet your eyes  
women arise.  

Pissed Off Poem  

"You probably didn't think I did  
But I heard  

You say that love is just  
a four-letter word..."  

and I heard you say it  

oh, not like so  

but I heard your  

opinion  

of me as  

those people  

and you couldn't even make  
any other kind of noise,  
boys.
