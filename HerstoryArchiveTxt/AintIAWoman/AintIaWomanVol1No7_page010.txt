Sisters,

This is an invitation. We want to inform
you that we are planning a conference for
November 13, 14, 15. We have just begun to in-
vite speakers, but already we have confirma-
tion that Marlene Dixon will be able to come.
We hope to have a very wide range of politi-
cal views and topics. Hopefully many women
will be coming from all over the United
States, but especially the Midwest, to parti-
cipate.

This weekend should be a very exciting one
for all those who can come. We will be send-
ing you more details as they develop. But for
now would you send us any ideas you have and
your thoughts on this conference.

Sisters,

The response we got to the idea of a confer-
ence here in October was really great and
proved how necessary it is.

However, we have run into large problems of
organization and time. First of all, the
Vietnamese women will not be coming in
October, but there is a possibility that they
may visit sometime next March. And in terms
of ourselves in Montreal, we have been under-
going basic upheavals and haven't been
sufficiently together to organize our part in
the way we had planned.

Some women suggested that Toronto would be a
more accessible location, and we are present-
ly waiting to hear from our Toronto sisters
about the possibilities of holding the confer-
ence there.

We want to stress that no definite decisions
have been made either for or against, and that
we are just trying our best to come up with
something concrete as soon as possible.

We will be in touch with you again soon. Please
forgive the inconvenience and delay and also
please excuse the form letter thing; it's only
a regrettable measure for speed.
