Just recently I decided that I wouldn't  
have any more male lovers. This came  
about after I made the decision to become  
a part of the woman's movement. I used  
to ‘understand' the other person's posi-  
tion so I wouldn't threaten or even chal-  
lenge it. 'Understanding' was a way of a-  
dapting myself to an easy way out. Funny,  
it wasn't so easy. I was in fact accepting  
my position. When I got fucked over I  
hardly ever fought back. I would be angry  
and hurt but most of the time I cried and  
screamed out of range from the other per-  
son's ears. I was afraid. I rationalized I

not knowing freedom  

I mimic myself  

until the integrity  

of womanhood ascends ...  

The freedom in choosing myself caused  
anguish because it involved a realization  
that my actions were not finite. They  
could be changed. New lifestyles can be  
implemented when old, established patterns  
of behavior are ineffective. Deception and  
evasion were easier to accept than the truth  
which led to myself.  

Trying to change society is perhaps  
necessary, but not sufficient for libera-  
tion. I needed to free myself by develop-  
ing a consciousness. Whatever validity I  
have as a human individual, as a woman,  
comes from my own consciousness. I know  
that each one of us has the potential to  
transcend our present mode of being.  
However, potential exists only when we  
realize the possibility of that potential.  
We limit ourselves with distorted vision  
and destructive action, when we fear our  
own thoughts and emotions. We create our  
essence, when we allow each day to assert  
itself from within us. Peace lies in  
understanding and accepting that all is  
within us.

tumn, a tree unaware of the rain running  
down its sides, of the sun or the frost,  
and of life gradually retreating inward.  
The tree does not die. It waits."  

When I first read those lines, I  
thought that the idea was beautiful. It  
does not die; it waits. My experiences  
with the universe were also passive. I was  
afraid of being spontaneous. I was afraid  
of honesty. But most of all, I was afraid  
to be myself. I feared the freedom that a  
consciousness provides.  

being born in the world  

a child  

taught to betray  

the woman within  

I die  

as I live  

intricately  

ingrained  

with submission  

to the leprous oppressor ...  

My apparent stability was contained  
within a bureaucratized society that was  
impersonal and anti-women. Men offered me  
indifference and called it love. I felt  
oppressed, stifled and insignificant.  

being born of flesh  
a woman  

thinking  

nothing  

for so long  

only a shadow  

of his reflection  
on edges ...  

I wandered within the dimensions of my-  
self trying to justify my existence. Ex-  
isting in a positioned, stagnant lifestyle  
was less complicated than choosing to de-  
velop a unified totality - I, Me.  

a Woman?  

didn't want to hurt anyone even if they  
had hurt me. I found it really hard to  
stand up to anyone. Not because you aren't  
worth it, I said to myself, but because  
you understand, you can take it, and maybe  
they can't. After all they fucked you over  
because they were insecure. . .  

What shit! Hitler was insecure so he  
had to kill millions to make up for it?  
What the fuck was I doing? Not only to my-  
self but to the millions of other women  
getting fucked over and accepting their  
position?  

I can no longer accept that position.  

We must live for ourselves for once. There  
is no sense in denying ourselves that part  
of ourselves which will stand up and fight  
that part which will change the world.  
Understand but understand something dif-  
ferent for a change. Understand that with-  
out fighting or confronting for ourselves  
we can never change anything.  

It's still hard for me because I'm  
still unsure of myself. I still find it  
hard to be exposed. I'm still afraid.  
Slowly I'm holding my own ground. But  
there's one thing for sure - I'm coming  
out:  

My feelings for you aren't so different  

Than good feelings for the woman I'm with.  

So what should I do with how much I love you?  

I ask because of the woman you care for and the woman I live with.  

I'm afraid of wanting to hold you:  

1) You say you're not straight but you haven't come out.  
2) You might think that's where our relationship's at.  

Yes, I know we both know better;  

Is that why it's easy to keep touching a game?  

Because we know better?  

Being together through changes and partings we've learned about each other.  
When we're together I think we understand a lot of things without saying them.  

My caring to be close to you is real.  

My caring about you is real,  

But I'm afraid to tell you seriously because of what you might say.  

You're a cool woman, and by intimation I've known not to be up front with you  
about how my feelings are toward you.  

I can talk to you about everything from revolution to a sexual experience  

But now I have more I want to say, and I can't.  

Will you laugh?  
"it's no big deal," you could say,  

Will you freak out?  

Will you not care?  

"You've loved others, and I really care about ..."  
Well, I love you and that's not invalidated  

or lessened in intensity because of others I love.  

Or others you love!  

But you may be right, it's no big deal.  

We can't handle it!  

You're afraid to confront her = I'm afraid to confront you.  
We're both afraid of the Unsatisfactory Response we might get.  

I know you know I'm writing this to you.  

And I’m sorry, but I have no other free form of expression that I haven't tried.  
Affection doesn't need to be reciprocated. :  

Caring doesn't need to be talked about, does it?  

But I WANT TO TELL YOU.  

I want your response.  

I don't want to be alone in feeling what I'm feeling.  

I want you to know. I want to know.  
I'm being too demanding.  
Curiosity killed the cat.  

Demands make people run.
