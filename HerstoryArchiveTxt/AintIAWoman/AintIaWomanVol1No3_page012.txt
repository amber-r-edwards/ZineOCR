The new abortion law in New  
York has no residency requirement,  
allows abortions up to the 24th  
week of pregnancy and after the  
24th week "under a reasonable be-  
lief that such act is necessary  
to preserve (the mother's) life."  

Hospital preparations have  
been inadequate, personnel and  
equipment lacking in many hos-  
pitals, and city health code re-  
quirements make it unlikely that  
many clinics or doctors' offices  
will be used for abortions in  
New York City.  

The Medical Society of the  
State of New York has recommended  
a doctor's fee of $100 to $150  
for the 10-30 minute out-patient  
abortion. Many doctors will  
charge more, hospital and labor-  
atory fees are additional.  

Like everything else in the  
health system, abortion reform  
favors the rich. The woman who  
can pay up to $800 for an abor-  
tion now can get it legally.  

($350 for the hospital room,  
tests, and operating room fees,  
$250 for the physician and $120  
for the anesthesiologist--or $750  
in one reported case already.)  

Covert guidelines imposed by  
hospitals (limiting the number  
of abortions to one a week in one  
case) add to the problem of  
access to abortions.  

The Women's Project is work-  
ing against that part of the new  
state law which forbids hospitals  
to train paramedical specialists  
to perform abortions. The Pro-  
ject provides doctor and referral  
services, housing and other aid  
to women from out of town. Later  
they may be performing pregnancy  
tests at a cost, if any, of $1.75.  
The Project has some doctors who  
will perform abortions for a fee  
of $50, but a suitable office or  
clinic must be found.  

Support for the Women's Abor-  
tion Project would aid women from  
out of town. Phone (212) 691-  
1860; 36 W 22 St., New York, N.Y

Clergy and Lay Advocates for  
Hospital Abortion Performance is  
an organization taking complaints  
from women who have trouble get-  
ting an abortion. It will record  
"how and why the system breaks  
down." (212) 477-0034.  

Planned Parenthood provides  
doctor and hospital referral  
service: (212) 777-4504 or  
777-2015.  

The Abortion Counseling Infor-  
mation and Referral Service, a  
commercial agency, guarantees a  
hospital bed and "an available  
board-certified gynecologist on  
a specified date." It claims to  
charge no fee to a poor New York-  
er and up to $800 depending on  
the case, the institution and  
the patient's ability to pay for  
others: 160 W. 86th St., New  
York City. (A commercial agency?  
Somebody better check this out.)

vices are working. If you know,

Our Ad Policy  

The Woman as consumer is one of the  
most evil of the sexual stereotypes  
laid upon woman. Most advertisement  
plays upon this stereotype, reinforc-  
ing it at the same time. The old cry of  
"Buy, Buy, Buy" must be replaced by ad-  
vertisement that limits itself to a  
simple statement of what is offered to  
the public. We join other women's lib-  
eration publications in accepting only  
non-exploitative advertisements.  

Ads are limited to a maximum length  
of 2". Each ad costs $5.00 each time  
it is run. All advertisements must be  
paid for in advance. We reserve the  
right to reject any ad.

NeciOak (AAS  

The medical issues cell has been  
meeting for nearly two months now. Our  
meetings seem to have taken on a pat-  
tern. At the first couple of meetings  
we talked about the medical profession  
in this country. It wasn't too hard to  
pinpoint the problems... they are so  
obvious that they stick out like a sore  
thumb. (People of the medical profes-  
sion pardon me for infringing on your  
territory.) In our preliminary discus-  
sions we had a pretty good analysis of  
the situation. Medical care is a class  
privilege in this country. If you've  
got the money you've got adequate care  
and attention. Doctors are guarding  
their professionalism with their  
lives. Sexism and racism are running  
rampant in the hallowed halls of hos-  
pitals and clinics that serve people  
everywhere. Female nurses are expected  
to follow male doctors like puppy dogs  
with slave-like devotion and obedience.  
Women are denied the right to make de-  
cisions about their own lives. The med-  
ical people (along with legislators)  
are killing thousands of women by not  
getting rid of this system's archaic  
abortion laws. People are often kept  
in the dark about the safety of the  
kinds of medications they are taking  
(OK doc, you can pass some of that  
guilt off to drug manufacturers). Doc-  
tors are refusing to go into ghettos  
to treat people because they are not  
treated courteously. Third world people  
are being experimented on to find new  
methods of contraception. When the man  
talks about curbing the population he  
is going to make damn sure that he cuts  
down in all the right places! I keep  
putting off medical and dental examina-  
tions because they are too expensive.  

I could go on and on...  
So after we had the monster pinned  

down, we started making suggestions  

about alternatives. So now we spend the  
first half of our meetings making pro-  

posals. The only catch to abortion  

counseling, which is being done, is the  
$350 minimum per abortion which most

middle class women (let alone lower  
class) have little chance of scraping  

up, and no one is willing to give them.  

Free Medical tests: We could offer free  
service to people... pap smears, preg-  
nancy tests, etc. But where do we get  
the expensive equipment? Doctors are  
too busy with their patients who pay  

to give time to a free medical center.  
We can train our own people, but we  
will need a lot of help first. Free,  
contraceptive information and advice:  
We have the information, it's the pre-  
scriptions and the examinations that  
cost the money. There is no Planned  
Parenthood in this town, and the near-  
est one is some fifty miles away.  

The University clinic charges money,  
and I haven't heard of any doctors who  
will do examinations free. The only way  
you can have free medical attention is  
to be on ADC and in the area of contra-  
ception that's a little after the  

fact. But then! I guess we should be  
thankful for small favors since the  
student health service here just this  
past year decided that maybe they  
should stop giving a moral lecture and  
give contraceptives to females request-  
ing them. Thanks a million for the  
pill?  

The second half of the meeting usu-  
ally drifts into other subjects. We  
aren't talking about medical issues  
anymore. Instead we discuss the day  

care center, or we speculate on what  

will happen with the New York abortion  
law. (New York is pretty far away.)  
Occasionally some of us drop the meet-  
ing altogether and go out to get ston-  
ed. We do just about everything under  
the sun you can think of to do when  
you can't deal with a situation.  

It's the kind of frustration that  
we're feeling at this point that makes  
people so enraged. Big medical business  
has things sewn up so tight in this  
area that we can't even get a foot in  
the door. But we're angry enough now  
that we're not going to stop trying.  
And our anger is not going to disap-  
pear... it's going to grow. The mysti-  
que of medicine is gone, and the auto-  
matic respect for the great white doc-  
tor is being turned upside down.  

Free and good quality medical care  
for all people! And that's only going  
to come with the Revolution!  

Work ex's Union  

A NOTE FROM THE STAFF OF THE FORMER  
SOUTHERN FEMALE RIGHTS UNION  

(Frances Hebert, Judy Harden, Kathy  
Bragg, Roxanne Dunbar, Susan Farris)  

The Marxist reading group in New Or-  
leans includes women who have been meet-  
ing as a women's group for more than a  
year, and has been joined by other in-  
dividuals. Several women who are now  
associated with SFRU joined the reading  
group a few months ago.  

Due to our studies in the group and  
practice in SFRU, we have arrived at a  
different political direction than we  
formerly held. We have dissolved the  
organization and discarded the name. We  
are now working towards building a New  
Orleans Female Workers’ Union. Some of  
us are getting jobs in industrial, low-  
er clerical, and service work in order  
to join with working class cadre to  
build a working class base for the wo-  
men's movement in this area. We believe  
that this is the direction the women's  
movement in general must take to truly  
serve the liberation of women and all  
oppressed people.
