TROUBLE

After a long struggle last  
Spring trying to find a structure  
to end the frustrating general meet-  
ings in which nothing got done and  
where we were at different political  
levels, Women's Liberation in Iowa  
City finally came up with a struc-  
ture in which sisters could be close  
to one another and grow politically  
together as well as do things. It  
was a structure with autonomous  
cells and a monthly general meeting.  
Over the summer five cells were  
formed: Publications, Day Care,  
Gay cell, Speakers Bureau, and the  
Medical Issues cell. Although the  
general meetings were supposed to  
be for intercellular communication,  
there was a tendency not to discuss  
reports from the cells and even not  
to have the general meeting. Dur-  
ing August when the Gay cell and the  
Medical Issues cell were temporari-  
ly not meeting, there began to be  
intimations of a schism between the  
Day Care cell that was busy setting  
up three free community controlled  
day care centers and the Publications  
cell which was busy putting  
out bimonthly issues of Ain't I A  
Woman? Almost everyone who was in  
Women's Liberation during the sum-  
mer was in one of the two cells.  
Although a member of the Day Care  
cell questioned the policy of Ain't  
I A Woman? to allow only female  
writers in the paper, the split was  
not yet visible.

To recruit parents and volunteers  
for the day care center, the Day  
Care cell decided it wanted a sup-  

plement on day care printed in Ain't  

I A Woman? which would include re-  
actions written by male parents.  
The Publications cell, agreeing to  
publish and finance the supplement  
but in light of its no male writers  
policy and wanting to encourage  
women to write, suggested that the  
reactions of the men be written by  
women. The Day Care cell felt that  
potential male day care volunteers  
and parents should hear reactions

directly from the males involved  
because male experience is differ-  
ent from female experience. Day  
Care pointed out the control they  
thought the Publications cell had  
with power of the press. At this  
point it was clear that there were  
differing political opinions and yet  
Iowa City Women's Liberation did not  
deal with the schism as a group.

Finally the Day Care cell decid-  
ed that they wanted to extend the  
involvement of the parents from  
control of the individual day care  
centers to political action on the  
day care issue in Iowa City. This  
would mean working politically with  
men. The Day Care cell asked at  
the next day care center meeting  
whether anyone would be interested  
in doing this and males were inter-  
ested. The Day Care cell then  
asked at a general meeting of Wo-  
men's Liberation how WL wanted to  
relate to the proposed Day Care  
cell: 1. disassociation from  
Women's Liberation 2. partial dis-  
association from Women's Liberation  
or 3. the Day Care cell with men  
included would become part of Wo-  
men's Liberation.

The meeting was polarized; both  
sides sat separately, felt on the  
defensive, gave arguments defending  
their politics, and vented resent-  
ments that had been building all  
summer because they weren't talked  
about. The Publications Collective  
saw the three alternatives as an  
ultimatum. Either men would be  
brought into Women's Liberation or  
the women in the Day Care cell  
would disassociate.

The women at the meeting  
decided to put off the decision until  
another workshop could be held so  
that all the women in the Day Care  
cell who weren't present could lis-  
ten to the discussion and better

make  
their decision. We realized  
that lack of communication had made  
of a problem that once could have  
been more easily handled, one whose  
scars we would personally feel and  
as an organization would have to deal  
with for a long time. A structure  
of intercellular workshops was set  
up to be held every two weeks until  
things got ironed out and later  

once a month so that sisters in dif-  
ferent cells could talk politically  
about issues that come up throughout  
the year.

The second meeting was better in  
that the atmosphere was more sister-  
ly. The Publications collective,  
however, was disappointed that the  
attendance of the Day Care cell was  
not greater. The Day Care cell con-  
tended that all members of the cell  
who had been active in the cell reg-  
ularly were there. Since members  
of Women's Liberation who were not  
in the Day Care cell would not ag-  
ree to having men in a Women's  
Liberation cell, the suggestion was  
made by a member of the Day Care  
cell that women who wanted to work  
with men would help form a male  
consciousness raising group, but  
that the Day Care cell would remain  
open only to women and do conscious-  
ness raising. The Day Care cell  
met later and agreed to try it.

Ain't I A Woman? felt that it  

was important to deal with the prob-  

lems in Iowa City Women's Libera-  
tion openly for two reasons: That  
other groups should not consider  

as a personal problem the phenomen-  
on that seems to be happening  
throughout the Women's Movement.  
Secondly, that other groups around  
the country be able to benefit from  
our mistakes and what we learn.
