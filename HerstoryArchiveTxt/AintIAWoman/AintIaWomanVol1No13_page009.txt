A Phillips screw has a

Cris-Cross groove;

you need
a special screwdriver with a

pointy end to remove them.
Phillips screwdrivers are cheap +
“You can get one at a hard-wap

sets like KLH, Garrard, Sony,
etc. Those seem to have
different problems than
cheap sets like Lii Nase.
For table stereos, they are made
to wear out + fuck up + be
hard to take apart. I keep
remembering how electronic
is every male thing
these screws + sockets...

HOW TO FIX
CHEAP STEREOS

/ WHAT PART TRY DOING THIS:

Buy a new needle. Don't be
pressured into buying a whole cartridge
if it's just the needle that's bad.

Dust records with lightly damp un-linty
cloth. Much-used records: Wash them
(really!) in lukewarm water and very
little soap with cloth or un-scratchy
sponge.

Speakers are made of paper and they can
be punctured or torn. You can tape the
tear with thin, preferably paper, tape.
Scotch Magic tape is OK; best is thin
paper or plastic tape which you rip off
at a hospital.

Take the back of the speaker off:
have regular screws; some
you need a Phillips screwdriver; some have hex nuts &
so you need pliers.

Usually 2 or 4 screws hold the speaker
to the box; take it off & turn over &
look for holes in the black paper to
tape up. Put back together & make sure

everything is tight or you will hear
unpleasant vibration of loose parts.

Check wires in speaker and into ampli-
fier; you may have to have them soldered
if they've broken off, but tape could do.
Tighten parts of plug with pliers.

If the cartridge is bummed out, there is
static, or very low volume on either or
both speakers. You have to get a new one.
Look under the arm & get the numbers on
the cartridge.

Unplug the stereo and reverse the plug,
like put it back in upside down.

Or unplug another appliance in the room,
heating appliances especially can
interfere.

See if the turntable is level; if it isn't
then prop up one corner by sticking a
matchbook under it. Try each corner.

It could be that the tone arm is too light.
Tape a weight on top, like a dime or a
penny -- it should be right above the
needle.

See that the switch is exactly on 33 1/3
or whatever. It should click into place.

Turntable needs cleaning and new
lubrication. This is a big deal,
stop, do not pass go, continue to
"Taking apart the turntable"

TAKING APART THE TURNTABLE

Tools: you need small pliers, screwdrivers with short handles,
(one regular, one Phillips-type), rags, and some very light
machine oil -- jewelers' oil is best, but 3-in-1 oil will do.
Time: allow yourself at least 1½ hours. And take notes as

you work; lay down parts on a piece of paper and label them

or trace around them. Things have to go back together in order.

The metal platform "floats" on springs over a base of wood or
fiberboard. There are usually 2 Phillips screws kitty-corner
from each other. Loosen them and the metal and wood platforms
will come together. If there is no wood base, find a hole near
one of the 2 screws (there should be one on the right side) reach
in & find an anchor holding the screw, horizontally. Snap the
anchor up vertically & push the side of the turntable up.

Also press the tone arm down on its armrest so it won't dangle.

If there is a wood base, there are 4, 6 or 8 screws, usually
Phillips, holding the base to the cabinet. Remove these and
pry a little at the wood edge & slowly lift the whole platform
up about 5 inches. Be careful. There are wires from the amp-
lifier to the turntable which are soldered and it's a hassle if
you break the connection on either end. Determine how far you
can lift without straining the wires, and prop up the platform
at that point with a piece of wood or something.
