notes to a man

1 you're so helpless, you're so cold  
I always wondered about you  
I have just begun little questions, smaller signs  
to share with my sister look into my paper eyes  
in the blossoming see if you can break me.  
secret  
of us  
2  

Constant candle  

candle to wondering  

only a stick in the darkness  
One more breath  

no more flame our little excuses  
Now it is perfectly clear shaped by everything within us  
drowned by everything without us  

3 freedom now!  

A million lovers your humor leaves me: silent  

in a line joined you watch me watching  

like an oval can you hear me crying  

And anyone can you see my slow hand fisting  

is part of freedom now!  

any two.  

"sensitivity" you say "understand me"  
freedom now!  

maybe somebody is paying off somebody?  

maybe there never was and never will be  
a chance for us  

maybe it is lost and gone forever  

dreadfully sorry  

clementine.  

| what kind of man  
| should  
run the business  
of seeing  
after citizens?
