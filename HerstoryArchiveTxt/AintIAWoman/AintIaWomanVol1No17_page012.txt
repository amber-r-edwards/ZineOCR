| Women's  
Song  

My body  
IS a weapon  
| It isn't soft |  
in many places  
My back  
Are knives and hammers  
For lashing in  
The faces  
of men  
who won't allow me  

My humanity:  

My legs  

The way  

For getting out  

Of situations  

For making distance  
Separate me  

from all  

The provocations  

of men  

Who can't forgive me  
My integrity:  

My eyes  

My being, free  
For planning out  
The moves required  
To get  
from where I can  
To where  

I want to be.  

My body  

is like my sisters’  
And we make love  
With each other.  
My hands  

often caress them  
While we  

Create a new world  
For women  
Who at least have  
Our humanity!  

All I am is women  

for another time  
Ticking hours  
in my sister's minds.  
It is an engine  
For a new plan  

Like a pistol  

in my sister's hand.
