The Women's Liberation Move-
ment has long been bringing the
issues of women's oppression out
into the open, hopefully for educa-
tion and free discussion. But
it is time for women to face these
issues (usually defined by men as
women's problems) in a critical and
analytical way, a way which
will assure that these issues are
not forgotten or thrown to the
background of a male dominated
revolution. The process of dialec-
tics as defined in Mao Tse-
tung's essay, "On Contradiction,"
offers a valuable model for such
an analysis of where women stand,
and where we should be going.

Lenin said, "Dialectics in
the proper sense is the study of
contradiction in the very essence
of objects." This sentence defines
what we will be doing in analyzing
WL by the dialectical method.
First, we will be observing and
examining contradictions, or oppo-
sites, which reveal themselves to
us through historical, material
development. This involves under-
standing the principles of univer-
sality and particularity, and
being able to identify the two as-
pects, or opposing views within
each contradiction. And second,
discovering that contradictions
lie in the very essence of things,
in our bodies and our minds, in
the system which binds us, in the
institution of marriage and the
institution of sex, we will ana-
lyze the dynamics involved as pri-
orities emerge and aspects are
transformed into their opposite.

As women, we have already
gone through the first step of ob-
servation. For centuries and cen-
turies we have been observing our
own oppression and the oppression
of others. But that observation
has been blurred over the years
as we began to accept our oppres-
sion as natural and good, thereby
accepting only one side of the
contradiction within us. Even
though Women's Liberation has
helped to define these contra-
dictions, we must continue to
look, delving deep into each thing
to reveal the very most basic con-
tradiction. What are some of these
contradictions? Some are easily
seen, like the contradiction be-
tween a woman's ability to do a
job, and her salary for doing that
job. Or a woman's performance in
medical school and her difficulty
in entering medical school. Going
deeper, we can see women's power-
lessness in a world of power-oriented
decision making. Or women's
natural kinship to each other and
their forced separation. Or
women's concept of themselves and
what they want to be, as opposed
to what society defines them as
and expects them to be.

The second step, after obser-
ving women's oppression and de-
fining the basic contradictions,
is to understand the universality
and particularity of each con-
tradiction. Universality means
that contradictions exist in all
things and are interdependent on
each other. The struggle between
the two aspects of each contra-
diction is the force which causes
growth and change. So anything
void of contradiction is a dead
thing. Interdependency of con-
tradictions is evident in the
fact that women cannot isolate
the contradictions within them-
selves as not affecting the rest
of society, that is, men. By
particularity we mean that each
contradiction involves a particu-
lar essence which defines it as
separate from other contradic-
tions. It is very important to
be able to discover these par-
ticularities, since they will de-
termine how each contradiction
is to be faced and finally resol-
ved. Particularities will be
found by studying the two aspects
of each contradiction in its con-
crete condition. This involves
studying both sides of a contra-
diction, such as our need for
control over our lives, and the
reality of no control over our
lives.

At this stage of our analysis,
important variants appear. Be-
cause of the dynamic quality of
each contradiction, seen in its
constant movement and develop-
ment, the two aspects involved
are unequal. Women are often put
down as unable to perform certain
jobs which they are trying to
get, while at another time in
history (like WWII) they were
forced into such jobs. This
illustrates why it is important
to view a contradiction in its
historical perspective and con-
sider it as a dynamic and ever-
moving force. This also applies
to the relationship between whole
contradictions. Some contradic-
tions will always emerge as more
important than others, although
they will constantly change places
within this system of degrees.
Understanding this concept is
essential to any revolutionary
action or policy development. It
is the basis upon which priorities
are decided on and so must occupy
much time and thought.

After a long and complex
analysis of the contradictions
we see as women, what will be the
end result, and what will make
it worthwhile? Mao sees the
worth of the dialectical method
in what he calls the identity
and struggle of the aspects of a
contradiction. This is simply
going back to the basis of the
dialectical method—change. Un-
der certain conditions, the two
aspects of a contradiction can
transform themselves into each
other. The ruler will one day
be the ruled and the last will
be first. Those who do not want
change in society try to exert
the opinion that this does not
occur, that things are static
and motionless, that changes
occur only in quantity and not
in quality. But history proves
that this is wrong and material-
ist dialectics reflects the rea-
lity of history. Contradictions
will struggle until they trans-
form themselves into each other
or unite into one, thus forming
a new contradiction with two new
aspects.

The Women's Liberation Move-
ment has passed the time of com-
plaining and hopelessly looking
on as both capitalist society
and the New Left continue their
oppression of women. We our-
selves must begin to take the
contradictions we see seriously.
We must recognize their applica-
tion to the whole of society and
their interdependence on all other
contradictions we sense around us.
We must also recognize their par-
ticular significance and implica-
tions, since only this will lead
to the effective solution. We
must study and analyze the whole
range of contradictions so as to
establish priorities and deal
with realities. And we must come
to believe that change is the
natural order of things under cer-
tain conditions, and we alone can
and will create the conditions
for this change. Analysis will
lead to awareness, awareness to
struggle, and struggle to revolu-
tion (resolution).
