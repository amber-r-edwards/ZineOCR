Dear Person:

Rape is an undiscussed, unstudied, unresearched subject.

We know almost

nothing about it because the myths and the misconceptions are so strong that  
they prevent intelligent, sane inquiry.

We can discover only two books written in this century dealing with rape.  
One is a sociological study based on 370 rape cases in Philadelphia in 1958  

and 1960.  

The other is a sometimes good, sometimes bad journalistic treatment which focuses primarily on the rapist, not his victim. We are writing  

We feel that the most important approach to the subject is one that deals  

with the victims, women.  
We ask them to tell us what happened.  

nine-tenths of all rapes which are not reported.  
We ask you to print this questionnaire, in the hopes that your readers will  

complete it and mail it to us.  
But we need your help to get a large and representative response.

We have a publisher.  
Sincerely,  

Andra Medea  
Kathleen Thompson  

P.S. The book will appear in the spring of 1973.
