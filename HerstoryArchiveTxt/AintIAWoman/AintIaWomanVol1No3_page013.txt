MONTREAL--Sisters in Montreal  
Women's Liberation would like to

have a working conference of

North American women's libera-  
tion groups to coincide with a  
trip to Montreal and Toronto of  
North Vietnamese women who have  
specifically asked to meet women  
involved in W.L. This could be  
the start of a coordinated wo-  
men's movement sharing serious  
self-criticism about where we  
started, what we've learned,  
where we're at, and where we're  
going. These sisters want to  
know what you think of such a  
conference (to be held sometime  
in October), and what form you  
would like it to take. Is there  
a better place for the confer-  
ence than Montreal (they think  
Canada would be better because  
the Vietnamese sisters and Cuban  
sisters--if they can come at all  
--can't come to the States)? How  
many would come from your group?  
Can you contribute or raise mo-  
ney?

Quebec, Canada, 514-844-5838.
