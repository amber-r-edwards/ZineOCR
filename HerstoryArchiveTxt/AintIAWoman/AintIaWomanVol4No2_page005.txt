Dear Rosa,

Thank you for your letter. You're  
right, being hesitant to speak to you  
is pigshit. About two years ago my  
color consciousness received its  
first big jolt, but with a little help  
from my friends I put it away. After  
the workshop on minority health needs  
and racism I was visibly shaken—I  
think because it was the first overt  
step I had taken and also because I  
was accepted. Your coming out to col-  
or has been influential in my thinking  
again about myself. Growing up in an  
Italian ghetto is what shielded me  
from thinking of myself as "Black" in  
the racial sense although I was color  
conscious as a kid. I thought every-  
one found themselves in conversations  
about national origin. I kept rein-  
forcing being Siciliana i.e. Italian  

but white because I was asked so fuck-  
ing often what my origins were. I had  
to come to the Midwest where there are  
few black and brown folks to begin  
thinking about it again. See usually  
people think I'm Spanish or Puerto  
Rican or Chicana so I thought I really  
was answering their question (and my  
own) if I said no. I've just realized  
that my mother's mother was Black. My  
mother who was born and grew up—for  
85 years in an Italian ghetto (various  
"projects") might not acknowledge  
that—god knows maybe she would if  
she had a chance. My darker brother Se  
was often "mistaken" or recognized as  
Black.  

Jesus yes I want to talk to you. S/QT  
I don't know about writing an article  
with you, but I'd like to at least  
help and think with you.  

Yes respectfully  
Bosco

The vocabulary of oppression that  
I know best concerns lesbianism, but I  
don't know if that will be appropriate  
or adequate for what I've been think-  
ing about. I am in the closet about  
race. Usually, but not always, I can  
pass without effort. So timidly did I  
begin coming out to race this time a—  
round (I've sort of made one-night  
stands before), that the glaze-over-  
the-eyes of the few friends I mention-  
ed it to, the fresh embarrassment, gen-  
eral weirdness of being in an “all-  
white" conversation about race would  
have been enough to send me back to  
the closet if it wasn't for a little  
group that is trying to talk about  
this subject.  

What I mean by one-night stands  
is the other occasions in my life when  
I tried to make sense of my racial or-  
igins. This usually took the form of  
saying to someone who I had grown to  
trust that I had Black blood in me, or  
taking the roundabout route I would  
pose the question—"what does it mean  
that I have Black blood in me (and  
can/do pass white?)" No reaction was  
sometimes the reaction—as though I  
hadn't uttered a word. A brief response  
which was the rough equivalent of  
"isn't that quaint." Or some subtle  
dismissal of the subject because “oh  
yeah, we're all of mixed blood.” TO  
SOME EXTENT I HAVE INTERNALIZED ALL  
THREE RESPONSES. I suppose those close  
friends who I spoke to about it were  
trying to tell me something like  
"you're the same to me," but I think  
what my attempts were all about was  
something like "I'm not the same to  
me," or "you're not the same to me."  

For several months I've been writ-  
ing to and talking to friends of color  
(the expression “of color" feels very  
awkward to me, but I want to include  
Black and Brown friends as well as mu-  
latto friends) about my family, my  
childhood consciousness of race and  
how, why, and when I pass. Some of the  
things I've been thinking more about  
are racism, color oppression and geo-  
graphy; what passing means; how I re—  
late to people who suffer color oppres-  
sion. This is all I can write about it  
so far.
