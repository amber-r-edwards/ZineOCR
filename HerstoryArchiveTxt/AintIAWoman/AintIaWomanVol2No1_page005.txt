Things you need for changing the oil in  
most standard American cars:

1) Oil pan or bucket  

2) Wrench  

3) Oil filter  

4) Six cans of 10-30 (heavy) oil - summer  
   (light) oil - winter  

5) Spout for oil cans  
6) A rag  

FIRST: Slide underneath the car from  
the front on your back looking up at the  
motor. You should see a bolt on the bottom  
side of a square shaped oil pan. Make  
sure to measure the diameter of the bolt  
before buying your wrench. e.g. 1965 Fords  
have 7/8" bolts. While you're under there  
you should see a cylinder (approx. 4" long)  
either hanging down or sticking out side-  
ways from the motor. It should say oil  
filter, but some don't. If you're unsure,  
ask the gas station woman to point it out  
to you.  

All of the things you'll need can be  
purchased at most big shopping center  
type stores. e.g. K-Mart, Sears, etc. They  
will have charts to tell the size oil  
filter you'll need.  

READY TO START?  

Be sure the car hasn't been used  
for quite awhile so that everything is  
cooled down.  

1) Slide oil pan or bucket under the  
   bolt in the car's oil pan.  

2) Remove the bolt with your wrench  
   and wipe the bolt clean. The oil  
   should be flowing into the oil pan  
   or bucket.  

While it's draining you can remove  
the oil filter by either turning it  
with your hands or using an oil  
filter wrench if you can't turn it.  
They are approx. $3 and can be pur-  
chased at auto supply stores.  

Some oil filters bolt on and are  
changed by removing and replacing  
the bolt. Most screw on and off.  

Wipe the surface where the oil filter  
came off clean. There will be some  
oil left in the filter so dump it in  
the oil pan or bucket. You can then  
throw it away and put on the new one.  

4) Put a thin film of machine oil or  
   any light oil on the top gasket of  
   the oil filter. Then screw it on the  
   place where the other one came off.  
   Don't use the oil filter wrench now.  
   Your hand will tighten it enough.  

5) After all the oil has drained out  
   replace the bolt and tighten it with  
   your wrench as tight as you can to  
   prevent leaks.  

6) Remove everything from underneath  
   the car.  

7) Open the hood and close above the  
   oil filter or on top of the engine  
   there should be a round black cap  
   saying oil. (some don't) Remove the  
   cap. Put the oil spout in an oil can.  
   The spout punctures the can so it  
   must be pushed in hard. Pour in the  
   oil where the cap came off. About  
   3 quarts will do now.  

8) Start your engine and let it idle  
   for approx. 1 minute checking for  
   leaks under the car from the oil  
   filter or around the oil pan bolt.  
   Then increase the speed for 3 min.  
   and check for leaks again. If there  
   are none everything is tight and  
   turn off the car.  

Then look in the hood again along  
the side of the motor the oil filter  
is on and there should be a thin  
rod with a loop on the end (dip-stick)  
running down into the car's oil pan.  
Pull this out and wipe it off with  
a rag. You'll notice at the end  
there is written add full. Stick it back in and then pull it  
out again. Read where the oil level  
is at. If it's not up to full yet  
put back the stick and add more oil  
to see when it's full. When it registers full replace the  
oil cap, close the hood and you're  
ready to go.  

The oil should be changed every  
3000 miles. The old oil can be kept in  
a bucket or old can and taken to the  
dump. It kills grass and won't wash away.  
You don't get back as much as you put  
in so there's not that much to get rid of.  

GOOD LUCK!
