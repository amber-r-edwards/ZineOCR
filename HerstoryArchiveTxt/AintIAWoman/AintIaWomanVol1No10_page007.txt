A Woman  

I loved visiting her.  

She would take my arm when we walked  

and proudly introduce me to the people she knew:  
"This is my grandniece all the way from Iowa,"  
But it will be different at Christmas.  

When my brother comes,  

she'll reach for his arm.  

The next day I came early with the car  
so we could go for a ride,  

but the elevator was broken  

and Mae can't walk six flights.  

It remains on the blink  

for the same reason  

that during the fuel strike,  

the landlords on 59th Street ordered  

the heat turned down in the building to save money  
even though there was plenty in the tank.  

Nellie was sick,  

and they spent the two weeks in bed.  

One time when Mae was coming home  

from visiting Nellie at the nursing home,  

she was so entranced by a little girl on the bus  
that she missed her stop—  

ending up in hippyville  

as she calls it.  

She passed a woman  

drunk and standing alone with a dress box.  
She was very refined, said Mae,  

and men were standing around  

waiting for her to pass out.  

The refined woman called to Mae:  
"I'll give you this dress  

if you'll call my family in Jersey."  

But my aunt didn't want to leave her  

for fear of the men  

and waited until help came.  

I was surprised; Mae is scared of the city.  

I took her to dinner again  

and we sat next to a woman  

with two small children—  
who was very chic and drinking before dinner.  
She scolded the girl and praised the boy  
saying cute things for the benefit of  

the people around.  

But the man she was inevitably waiting for  
never came....  

And after watching the pain of that woman  

and helping the refined woman,  

after supporting Archie and Willie their whole lives  
and having no elevator and no heat...  

after such a capable, godly life,  
Mae, why do you still talk of boyfriends?  

Jo the new woman  

If you can see  
my suffering  
I am afraid;  

Fear of  

illegitimate suffering;  
I don't deserve you.  
But you accept me,  

you don't say  

"Go away."  

It's not important  
I can't accept concern,  
I don't believe it.  

The negations live  
around the eyes.  
You search into  
the woman  

and I look away.  

Help me.
