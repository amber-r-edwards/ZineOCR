A Woman?

I'm trying to remember  
something I quit before it ended  
so I can rid myself  

of this image  
of clinging to corpses  
of groups and relationships  
ashes of feeling  
analysis of situations that  
don't exist anymore  

I'm not sure  
if this period of ending  
is more complete  
or if the immediacy  
dements the perspective  
on everything that I  
can't let go of  
as it dies in my hand  
and  

I feel humiliated  
for not knowing in time  
that things are changing  
I feel foolish for  
trying insanely to preserve  
a relationship that never existed  
a direction that no one was going  
a routine of nothing  

to do  

anymore  

29 December 1970  
after 9 pm  
you make me wish to write long pages  
full of shit  
about being/loving/creating  
I feel as if right now I could scream of  
beauty —  
from the hills -- your cosmic touch  
should  
be talked about because it is within us  
all  
to be caressed that way  
I LOVE you what more can be  
said  
and through you all people are loved  
by me  

more  
those little communal houses (or the  
great  
big ones) we talked about  
someday we'll see them  
together and I will touch your  
soul's temple also and you mine == not  
out of  
the need to get physical  
but from the need only we  
two can feel  
how I love you  
brown-eyed one  
love spelled the same but meaning  
spiritually much more  
meaning that we realize the  
creative  
forces to be energy and that  
we as a  
part of that must  
come together  
come  
together  
wow -- there are tears in my  
laughter

Not Expecting  

It's not that  

I hunger  

for the salt of our  

essential sweats.  

There is no heat-smell  

of two hot stones  

pressing each other in my belly.  
It's not even that.  

But I sense that the presence  

of your liquid  

fingers in my bed  

would unclamp my night-tense jaw,  
unfurl my tongue,  

and remind my skin  

of the greenness of sheets.  

To sleep  

cupped in the arc of your body  
(the way children do  
and call it "spoon fashion")  

my woman-shape  

echoing  

your woman-shape  

and your breath near:  

That is my image.  

BILL'S-OLE-LADY  

Hey is that you  

Bill's-ole-lady  

sashaying down the street  

brillo frizzies flying copper in the sun  
yee-owling  

marchin' off with all those war-painted ladies  
to smash the state?  

You never looked so tall before  
five-foot Bill's-ole-lady  

You were the only woman I called friend  
three years ago in San Francisco  

You and me, we played hostess  

to the revolution games they fought  

in your Fulton Street parlor  

They liked Polynesian chicken and tacos with  
their tactics  
So we stewed the birds  
and ground the beef  
How clever they are, I thought  
How happy we are we said  

Hey, is that you, Bill's-ole-lady?  

I catch your eye  

You dash through a street-full of our friends  
Throw strong arms around my heart  

and whisper  

"My name is Judith."
