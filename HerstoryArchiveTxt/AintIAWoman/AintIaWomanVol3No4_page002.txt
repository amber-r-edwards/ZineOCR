Dear Sisters,  

I really enjoyed your childcare issue...  
and found it somewhat fascinating that  
nothing else could get done due to all of  
the struggles over who's going to take  
care of the children. I've had fantasies  
myself of interrupting any and all meetings  
in my area with mobs of children so that  
nothing could get done until "who's going  
to take care of the children" got dealt  
with a little better. However, I no longer  
(at this moment) feel quite like that is  
the best approach for (where I live).  

I'm getting off the track.  

Here are some of my thoughts  

ON CHILDCARE  
What do we mean when we say as mothers  
that we need help with caring for the  
children? And I tell a two-year-old who is  
visiting our house with his mother "no,  
you can't have that jar full of peanuts"  
and take out a few to give to him...and  
his mother rushes from the hall to his de-  
fense and she takes over administering  
what he can and can't have...not able to  
trust that anybody but she can truly be  
properly concerned for her child's welfare.  

And why is it that when some children  
are left with other people they totally  
freak out and cry constantly. I don't  
think that it is natural for babies to be  
so attached to their mothers and I feel  
that we (as mothers) are at least as re-  
sponsible as other people that children  
aren't more able to be raised collectively.  
Actually, I'm not trying to place blame...  
but too often there is a cry by mothers  
that nobody else sees what needs to be done  
in order to care for their baby/child prop-  
erly...there is a presumption by everyone  
(including the mother) that mother knows-  
best and although she's found out everything  
that she knows about what affects her child  
(ie why she/he won't eat; why she/he's cry-  
ing; etc) has been through trial and error...  
still other people aren't allowed that same  
process and instead if mother is around she  
unconsciously acts as the all-knowing re-  
garding "her" child.  

It is hard to fight the privatization of  
children. But first we are recognizing that  
they are privatized...and then we are  
struggling with changing that. I hope that  
in your future issues you will have more  
on "who takes care of the children."  

I live in a flat with four adults and  
three children. There are often as many as  
six neighborhood children. And we have a  
couple of overnight switching so that who  
and how many children is always changing.  

love to you  
and  
power to the  
women and children
