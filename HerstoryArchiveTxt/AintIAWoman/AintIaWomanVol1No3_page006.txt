high school

Cultivating homosexual tenden-
cies in high school was too easy.
You don't have to know that you
are going to be a lesbian when
you first start to dig being
with a girlfriend more than any-
body in the world . . 
I didn't.

Have you ever noticed that
when you don't know what you're
doing you do more? Naivete was
my downfall for sure. I used to
be casual about actions that soc-
iety stereotypes as blatantly gay.
Generally, high school was one
really good friend after another
with whom I had some very physical
moments. That's what I mean
about being naive. Neither one
of us knew what we were classi-
fying ourselves as by being as
affectionate as we felt.

After three really close
friends and myself had gone
through a time in our respective
relationships of this physical-
ity, I recognized a pattern in
my friendships. My friends, ap-
parently not confiding in one
another, only saw the unique-
ness of the experience for them-
selves.

I immediately took on the
burden of guilt. LIFE AND LOVE
FOR TEENAGERS prescribed psychi-
atric counseling though they
also stated that prognosis for
cure was very low. Let's make a
point of rewriting the chapter on
homosexuality after the Revolu-
tion. It made me feel hopelessly
dirty and sick. I became suspic-
ious of any uncontrollable emo-
tions and motives my strange new
self might have.

It was at that time, too, that
I became very inhibited about be-
ing touchy with female people --
for fear of spreading my disease
maybe. No one thought anything of
feet or hands or heads touching at
slumber parties -- for one but me.
It even stopped playing basketball
because I was afraid if they saw
my body in the shower room they
would somehow figure out what im-
moral disease I carried.

I was really afraid. What had
gone wrong with me? Was there any
thing wrong, or was it just coin-
cidence until then? I tried not
to dwell on it. There were lots

anyway, I

of girls who were willing to be my:

friends, that's why cultivating
this habit was so easy. I was
just conscious of my 'tendencies'
when we were in conducive situa-
tions; which was too often!

By my last year in high school,
having experienced intense loving

relationships with females and the
expected but superficial flirta-
tiousness with males plus their
cold, meaningless sex, I began to
recognize how unjust society is in
declaring normalcy to mean heter-
osexuality for all. I resented the
double standard which I became
aware of gradually through closer
examination of my guilt.

I concluded, and still believe,
that 1) no person has a right or
obligation to judge another's
morals and behavior; 2) no
group of people has a right to
force its beliefs on others, pen-
alizing rejection of these values
with humiliating and severely de-
moralizing labels and their con-
sequences; 3) this society does
not encourage female people to
develop to their greatest poten-
tial.

After forming these opinions,
I was off on a more serious trend
of relationships — the real kind.
I no longer feel guilty - I'm
angry. After sneaking, hiding,
lying, running away, awkward en-
counters with friends and parents,
I'm convinced I'm not acting more
irrationally than they make me act
or they are acting themselves.

Acceptance

I've briefly asked myself
what being Gay has in common with
the fight for Women's Libera-
tion. At times I've felt that my
being a member of WLF may even be
hurting the group because some —
women might hesitate to join if
they think that the group is just
a bunch of "Man-haters". But I
decided that there was a common
bond and have equated the two
(WLF and being gay) on the basis
of respect. As long as I'm a
woman, i.e., human being, I de-
serve a certain amount of respect
more or less dependent upon if

I'm personally worthy and have

earned it. Yet, as soon as I

say I'm homosexual, in some eyes
I immediately become a low animal
if not hated, at least pitied.
Therefore, as long as I'm a woman
and am being cheated of my right
for respect, my plight, even
though perhaps in a different
form, cannot be separated from
the oppression and degradation of
all women.

This is an example of one of
the situations that occur in the
life of a homosexual.

One weekend there was to be
a small reunion with two of my
old college friends, one of whom
had known me for years. The
other friend couldn't make it
that weekend but we two made the
best of it, talking over old
times like a couple of old biddy
gossips.

Experiences

Since my love life really
couldn't be talked about as I
never told her about my being
Gay, I turned the conversation to
who she was dating. She was
happy to go into great detail,
and I was relieved as this took
the burden of the conversation
off of me. Then she proceeded
to tell me about some weirdo who
was window peeking in her apart-
ment and another one who was ma-
king obscene phone calls: both
of which I could understand her
being upset about. Through this
part of our conversation she
used the word "pervert" about
30 times (no exaggeration).
Although not once did she use it
in relation to female homosexuals,
each time she said it I cringed.

I wondered if she would call me

"pervert" if she knew how I felt

about women. Finally in the mid-
dle of her conversation I stopped
her. I said, "Look, I'm going to
tell you something, but I want
you to remember while I'm telling
you this that I'm the same person
you've always known and will be
afterwards -- I'm homosexual."
She never even blinked.
She started talking in short, fast
bursts. "Oh really, I would have
never guessed it." Then I could
see a change coming over her
face as it started sinking in
and she said, "If you lay one
hand on me I'll knock you silly."
Seeing as I hadn't even moved
except for my eyes watching
her hands and face, the menacing
tone of her voice and the fear
in her eyes would have been
ludicrous if not for the fact
that a minute ago this was a
smiling chatty friend of mine.
