GRITA

Sangre grita  
Yaza bronce expira  
bursting out  

canto  
es mi  

es mi raza  
yo los quiero

In Case I Don't Make It To Tomorrow  

Attention all half-breeds!  

Tired of feeling misunderstood?  

Tired of having no box to check  
but other?  

Tired of trying not to notice that  

that you don't fit in anywhere?  

After all that buildup  

I have no easy solution.  

I can only answer “so am I"  
to all those questions.  

If it would help  

make a button that says  

"I am the product  

of an interracial marriage."  

So next time you're caught  
between the two worlds  

you can skip the song and dance  
about how your father's a this  
and your mother's a that, so there!  

As for the loneliness  
I have no solutions.

translation: As  
Sangre grita is the Aztec cry of blood  
before cutting someone's heart  

raza bronce expira - a bronze race comes  
to life.  

canto y lloro - singing and crying  
es mi gente - this is my people:  
es mi raza - this is my race.  
yo los quiero - I love them  
Soy morena - I am a brown woman  

THE EARTH IS A SATELLITE OF THE MOON  
Leonel Rugama  
Apollo 2 cost more than Apollo 1  
Apollo 1 cost enough.  
Apollo 3 cost more than Apollo 2.  

Apollo 2 cost more than Apollo 1  
Apollo 1 cost enough.  

Apollo 4 cost more than Apollo 3  
Apollo 3 cost more than Apollo 2  
Apollo 2 cost more than Apollo 1  
Apollo 1 cost enough.  

Apollo 8 cost a whole lot but you didn't feel it  

because the astronauts were Protestants  
they read the Bible from the moon,  
bringing glad tidings to all Christians  

and  

The  

Pope Paul VI blessed them when they returned,  

Apollo 9 cost more than all the rest together  

including Apollo 1 which cost enough.  

The  

great-grandparents of the people of Acahualinca  
were less hungry than the grandparents,  
great-grandparents died of hunger.  

Grandparents of the people of Acahualinca were less hungry  
than the parents.  
Grandparents died of hunger.  

Parents of the people of Acahualinca were less hungry than  
the people who live there now.  
Parents died of hunger.  

People of Acahualinca are less hungry than their children.  
Children of the people of Acahualinca are born dead from hunger,  
they're hungry at birth, to die of hunger.  

The people of Acahualinca die of hunger.  

Blessed be the poor, for they shall inherit the moon.
