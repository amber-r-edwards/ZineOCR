Dear Nico,  
I love you. I like you. I'm going  

to invite you to my birthday. I'm going to  

send a picture to you. I want to do a  

poem about T.V. That's it.  

Elaine  

Piss in your poopey. Poop in your pissy.  
A Flower that I know. I've been camping.  
I paint at daycare...a propeller. Towa.  

Cecilie  

I've been camping. I love your flower. I  
like to stay overnight at people's houses.  
I've been to the Union. I grabbed six  
straws. I love you, Christmas Tree. I  
know how to phone Jayson and Mari and day-  
care. I love you, glasses. I ring the  
doorbell. I want to say cuckoo-birds. I  
love you, tongue. Sissy bell. I like  
cottage cheese. I put my tomato soup in  
my cottage cheese and mixed it around. I  
love Jayson. I love you, Nico, Duncan. I  
want to give you a present. The end.  
Julia

I'm six years old, Pissy, poopey. I put  
tomato soup in my cottage cheese. I love  
glass. I love Willy. I threw up in the  
Christmas tree. I pissed and pooped on  
the Christmas tree, Nico pissed in the  
ocean. Put on your glasses before you go  
in the elevator. I pissed in my hair. I  
drew a picture of a mouse with a hat on.

I cough in my glasses.  
My snot runs up my nose and down my nose.  

Nico. Piss. Poopey. Nico, I love you.  
I tease you. I'm six. I'm all done say-  
ing. Bullshit. (My Grandma doesn't  
feel good and they don't know how long she  
will live.)
