Mae is eighty-six and

the sole surviving sister of three brothers and three sisters.

Of all of them

only my Grandmother married.

Nellie and Mae chose not to

live at home; instead, they took care of their mother.
When she died,

they took care of their two alcoholic brothers

and each other.

Mae worked and Nellie kept house.

I don't remember Willie

who used to work two weeks and drink two weeks, Mom said.
He was a card shark

and once when Mom was tired of losing at poker

he dealt her four queens,

but gave himself a straight flush.

Archie was the black sheep.

He drank too much and he didn't work

which must have been hard on Nellie and Mae
who never touched the stuff—

except for Nellie who used to have two glasses of port a day.

"It's good for your blood," said Mae.

For fifty years

Mae was a switchboard operator

and supported all four of them.

She talks about the office a lot

and how the company would almost fall apart
when she went on vacation

because she knew all the numbers by heart,

and none of the executives had to look them up.

She still has all the presents
they gave her over the years
safely wrapped in their boxes,
and gives them to us one by one
as Christmases pass.

Archie died a long time ago.

Grandma two summers ago,

and Nellie this Spring.

While before Nellie and Mae's life was lonely
they at least had each other.

Now Mae misses Nellie deeply,

Nora, our cousin in Scotland, wrote:

"Nellie must have been all-in-one to you."

Mae lives alone in New York City
in a two-room apartment

that is made darker

by the eight-year-old paint

than by her age.

My Mother and brother and I

are all she has, but we live in Iowa

and aren't much daily good.

She says, without the television

she wouldn't know what to do.

"I wish my mother had had it

during the day when Nellie and I went to work."

One Christmas we came to visit
and the TV was broken;

Mae couldn't bring herself to spend the money
to fix it.

So we brought them one.
Mom said that the money was nothing
compared to what a TV would mean to Nellie and Mae.

This Thanksgiving when I came

it was working

and we watched it while I mended my coat.

It was a good time.

I like to get her talking about

what our family was like when she was young.

My Grandmother used to ask me if I had a boyfriend
and I would lie.

I knew Mae would get around to it

but in thinking of her life,

I told her, when she asked,

that I didn't intend to marry.

She said she and Nellie would always talk

about how I was probably going to take after them,
and be an independent woman.

"Men, who needs them," she said.

But you should have seen her eyes

when the waiter talked to us later

in the little restaurant across the street

or when my brother walks into the room.

And she often talks of all the boyfriends Nellie had
and how this or that one wanted to marry her.

Mom told me long ago why Mae didn't have boyfriends:
She had acne.

"Men," she says, "who needs them."

But she doesn't mean it.
