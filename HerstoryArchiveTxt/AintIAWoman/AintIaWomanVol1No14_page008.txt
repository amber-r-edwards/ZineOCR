BOSTON WOMEN UNITED is in the throes of
putting out a new Feminist magazine, The
Digging Stick. It will be a comprehensive
magazine, wide in scope in its treatment
of historical, political and theoretical
issues and open to contributions from all
our sisters. In order to make The Digging
Stick a reality, we desperately need don-
ations. For $10.00 we would be happy to
give a line of acknowledgement and for
$25.00 a block (an 1/8 of a page). Send
checks to Boston Women United, 651
Concord Ave., Cambridge, Mass. 02138.

Students will hold its second annual con-

will be “Women and the Legal System" and
will include discussions of the problems
of women in the legal profession and the
relation of law women to the women's
movement. Speakers and workshops will deal
with problems of job discrimination, abor-
tion, prisons, divorce and other legal
areas which are of concern to women.

WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO against the War.
There will be a United Women's Contingent
and a Gay Liberation Contingent. For
more information: United Women's Conting-
ent, 1029 Vermont Ave. NW, 8th floor,
Washington, DC 20005 or phone: (202) 234-2005.

There's a FREE MEDICAL CLINIC on the 2nd
floor of the River City Free Trade Zone at
121 E. College in downtown Iowa City. It
is open one evening a week, Friday from
7:00-11:00. It seems well staffed with qual-
ified people--probably some doctors and
nurses and some students. You can get free
pelvics and pap smears. Also they have
drugs available free and some available at
cost. They seem to be pretty thorough, from
what little I know. They didn't fool around
and just seemed to ask the necessary
questions and do the necessary things. They
were pretty friendly and the nurse was nice.
You are asked to fill out a form with your
name and address and a relative's name and
address.

"That man over there says that a woman
needs to be helped into carriages, and
lifted over ditches, and to have the
best place everywhere. Nobody ever
helped me into carriages, or over mud
puddles, or gives me a best place...
And ain't I a woman? Look at me.
Look at my arm! I have plowed
and planted and gathered into
barns, and no man could head me...
And ain't I a woman? I could work, as
much and eat as much as a man when
I could get it and bear the lash as well...
And ain't I a woman? I have born
thirteen children and seen them
most all sold off into slavery. And
when I cried out with a mother's grief,
none but Jesus heard...

And ain't I a woman?"

Rights Convention at Akron, Ohio in 1851.
