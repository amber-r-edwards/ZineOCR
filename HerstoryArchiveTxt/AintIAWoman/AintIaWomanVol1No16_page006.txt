Going to the women's softball tournament  
raised my consciousness. More pigshit was  
rooted out of that dark dank thing I call  
a mind, a memory.  

There have not been for me, while grow-  
ing up, female models. In high school I  
liked athletics; I enjoyed rigorous physi-  
cal activity. And yet, I shunned concen-  
tration on that activity because those  
young women who were proficient in sports  
were scary and repulsive: muscular, strong,  

PLACE  
FOR  
US.  

Female culture to me is how women relate. Because I have  
with women, I'm constantly aware of the class differences  
between men and women. Women start off equal, but there  
is not the constant struggle for equalizing things that goes  
on between a man and a woman. We all have some common  
history of learned sensitivity—“in this”  
each people ‘and relating that doesn’t here. A de cx-  

famed  
O being with women, and being open and free about relations  
Ahem, past differences were. I realize that becomes threatening to  
me. I feel this with my reality. The term  
my partner, a woman—Commonly grouped, I’m separated from  
myself by a man who has held me for the last years the  
result—master. Accepting myself—and my shame,

confident in their bodies. I could not help  
myself to physical prowess because I was  
too damn busy asking men to validate me.  
I remember making a bulletin board in the  
locker room that was supposed to motivate  
girls to come out for their intramural  
sports...and I slapped up giant construc—  
tion papered figures of school sports he—  
roes MALE HEROES to motivate my friends.  
My friends, I didn't know what the hell  
that meant or what the hell I was doing.  
My body. Watching you women play soft-  
ball my body became important. You are  
teaching me to respect that part of me so  
denied to me in high school. I have accept-  
ed years as toneless masses of flesh. When  
one of the women made an error during the  
game I said out loud, without thinking:  
“THAT'S ME,” And an instant later I real-  
ized what that meant and years of rage came  
up my throat because that was me. That is  
me, lacking the confidence of body; fearing

AN EPISTLE FOR TASHA  

The dead are the only people  

to have permanent dwellings,  
We, nomads of Revolution  
Wander over the desolation of many generations  
And are reborn on each other's lips  
To ride wild mares over unfathomable canyons  
Heralding dawns, dreams and sweet desire.

it’s yet the same  
I want no more

When I say sister  
I love you  
I make no demands  
I touch you  
without possessive  

I have had more  
than enough  
of loneliness.  
I would not trade that now  
for onlyness.  

What I look for now  
is only found

Loving is not

it is not spent

Is that what revolutionaries  
have always said,  
my sister?  
People went to the free medical  

clinic together when they needed  

to see a doctor. They went into  
the examining room together for  
respect. The doctor must have been  
slightly freaked out. He told them they  
would leave to be seen separately next  
time.

and your own pleasure.  

once a closeness, now only distance  

as if you're afraid my love  
will be a word; it  
never was for me, but maybe  
it’s all to know  

O the rough hand  
times—Personal and political  
masses doing things together;  
they all connect:  
Movies, rallies, baseball games,  

that's changing too.  

loving each other.
