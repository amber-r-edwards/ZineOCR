Ayer estaba durmiendo  
y tenía un sueño  
sobre un h.c.  
Era un niño.  
Él me enojó  
y que odio.  

QUIERO MATARLE...  

Ese hombre  
me dio mucha tristeza.  
Me chingaba.  
Me usó.  

Bebía mi sangre morena.  
Perdí mi visión con él.  

Ahora lo tengo.  
Entonces  
tengo un plan  
para mi "galán".  

Soy una marimacho.  

No equivoques otra vez,  
cabeza de caca.  

Con mi rabia  
voy a hacer algo...  
un golpe fuerte en los huevos.  
¡Consáfos a ti!  

¡Qué te vayas muy mal!  
Es lo que mereces.  

CURSE  

Last night I was sleeping  
and I had a dream about a man I hate.  
It was a nightmare.  

He made me real mad.  

I WANT TO KILL HIM...  

This prick  
gave me a lot of grief.  
He fucked me.  
He raped me.  
He drank my brown blood.  
I lost my vision with him.  

But now I have it.  
So  
I have a plan for  
my "white knight".  

I am a lesbian.  

Don't make the same mistake,  
shithead.  

With my anger  
I'm going to do something...  
a swift kick in the balls.  
Take all your grief back!  

Hope you feel like shit.  
It's what you deserve.

UP TO MY ELBOWS IN JIVE  

If I give you this poem  
you will read it  
with your sensitive insensitivity.  
You may criticize the style  
but lay you 8 to 5  
you will miss the point  
if it hurts too much to face it.  

And I think that anymore  
my whole self  
comes under that category.  

Fuck the heavy discussion  
and rationalizations  
on both sides.  

YOU RIPPED ME OFF  
because you're a chickenshit  
and being marginal is not  
never having to say you're sorry  
for being unable to distinguish  
right from wrong.  

I'm all for the grayness of life  
being recognized  
but sometimes there's not time for that  
what with today being a killer.  

In short  
talking to you is  
a post-revolutionary ideal at best  
and usually just a kick in the ass.  

I won't have time for long chatty letters.  
If you in person is too close for comfort,  
you on paper is too distant for focus.  

You talk a good line.  
I recognize it.  

But experience has changed  
the looks of things for me,  

I hope  
the falls you'll surely take  
leave you  
neither  
too crippled to get up  
nor  
too able to run away.
