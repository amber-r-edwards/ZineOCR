Mother  
of my special friend  
Mother of my lover  
and her brother  
Mother whom I longed  
to be daughter of,  
When did your face grow so drawn?  

Was it being the plain daughter  
Or when your husband died?  
And you packed up your home  
and children and moved  
to Iowa to begin again?  
Was it the school saying you  
hadn't provided a normal home?  
How did you keep from telling them?  

Dead a husband/her father  
Dead your only son/her brother.  

Yet sitting there  
your face remained  
as I remembered it.  
Tears coming,  

but as no surprise  
to its expression,  

Then  

“Because he was in the Navy,"  
the minister said  

"The Navy Hymn."  

For those in peril on the sea.  

And I cried  

because the Navy Hymn  

bound us in a way you never knew  
during the year  

I lived with your daughter  

without your blessing.  

Late at night  

it would be played  

by a station going off the air  
accompanied by pictures of the ocean  
and I imagined you watching  

those same waves  

with worry kept well back from your eyes,  
wishing your son  

safe travel on the sea.  

So many weeks suffered with you  

in understanding of your Mother-pain  
many letters written  

never sent.  

Because of our difference  

over your daughter  

I came to the service for your son  
wanting to be near  

for her sake and yours,  

but prepared  

to be received in coolness.  

And when you welcomed me  

with both your hands,  

the quickness of my response  

to bend and touch your cheek with mine,  
surprised me.  

Until I remembered  

how often I'd imagined us greeting in that way.  

How often I'd imagined you accepting me  
finally.  

Cinderella has escaped.  

Once  
she chased a prince  
and was caught  

in a glass slipper - size 5.  

She went from washtub to sauna  
in an easy dream of feminine reward.  

Cinderella got pregnant,  
she got bored,  
she was dying and she couldn't breathe.  

Her dream was a nightmare  

and Cinderella cursed  

the fairy godmother  

for not telling her the rest of the tale.  
(happily-ever-after was the lie.)  

And one night  

after the prince — now king -  
had taken his pleasure,  

she slipped out  

she escaped  

with her child on her back  

a rifle on her shoulder  
leaving a piece of glass heel  
in the throat of the king.
