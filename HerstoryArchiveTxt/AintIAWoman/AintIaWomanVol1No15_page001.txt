The University rips off so many people in so many
ways every day - by its existence as an institution
designed to propagate the bullshit society puts
down on us from the time we are children, by its
business dealings with fat cats which make them
fatter, by its attitudes toward people and prop-
erty - in too many ways to list.

No one in the University power structure will
come out and admit women are discriminated
against - but it is a fact that we are. It
becomes really apparent in their policies and
actions.

When we were busted Sunday and kicked out of our
daycare center by the University I was ripped
off for the freedom to develop myself as a woman
in the role in which I see myself. I am now be-
ing forced into the female role in which society
(and the University as an arm of that society)

would like to see me - a woman who must contend
with dirty diapers and dishes 24 hours a day.

I was ripped off because a piece of property is
more important to them than a person with real

and urgent needs.

My child was ripped off for a place in which she
could grow in a better atmosphere. I teach her
to share, but they stole from her the chance to
break out of the bullshit of this society and

the damaging head hassles that accompany it.

They are trying to force her into the same thing
I was forced into as a child - to go to school
and take the required home economics course
(because "that's a woman's role in this society").
And they'll stuff shit into her head until she

forgets what a real woman is.

But only if we let them.
