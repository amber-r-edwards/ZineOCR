ah, cheryl, it's ending the march & here you are  
just never, never getting yourself together  

it seems fisted, usually & then, just when  

your fingers slowly uncurl  

the moment is passed & you're left  

quickly re-clenching  

hoping nobody noticed, saw  

you've passed another year &  

you talk about changes  

moving like a poem  

on someone else's propaganda  

you're so conscious you  

recognise those prophetic vibrations  
you can see yourself in history  

& that, my darling, takes distance  
distance  

from me, from those not terribly significant  
--you believe--  

in the final totalling of your-- and my--life  

i admire you  

god knows, i do that  

but just let me say  

that your calm control, your hand  

ah my perfect one  

is strangling me.  

no--that is too harsh  

you allow me only your counter-revolutionary moments  
now see--see again what i have had to do  

don't, my only lover, listen & analyse  

don't, cheryl cheryl, feel me through your armor  
through your political perceptions  

have the courage, little one little one,  
me or set me free.  

to destroy  

love, cheryl  

o, =  

see there's some words i could say here.  

dnd. you've probably heard them  
before » not from me  

and this song won't resolve anything  

i just like to sing  

reeves get off on you  
i feel glad just to see you smile  
when you say  
“we had another good day”  
want you to stay  

eee like a poem we knew  
sziL "seeing the smile in your eyes  
i have forgotten  
that people die”  
well, i heard that before  
there was you  
but it's true,  
and there's more  
not to remember  

not to remember  

don't want to remember  

any other way of livin’  
i want to hold onto you  
cause our life has been lies  
and there's nothin’ i believe in  

but you're leavin’  

cause for you there's somewhere  

to be goin’

Thinkin’ ‘bout me  
hey, don't you think about me.  
Sometimes, when you see  

“bout me  

yourself slippin’ away,  
disappearin’  

can you see yourself sayin  

i want to hold on to you  

i want to hold onto you  
cause it's goin’ through changes  

don't want to remember  

don't want to remember  

any other way of livin’  

i want to hold on to you  

cause our life has been lies  

and there's nothin' i believe in  

'bout you, and you're leavin’  

and i won't be the one to be holdin’  
holdin’ you back  

from the way that you're goin’  

- it was a bad dream last night  
and i woke up cold  
in the morning  

want to hold on now  

i want to hold on to you,  

i want to hold on to you
