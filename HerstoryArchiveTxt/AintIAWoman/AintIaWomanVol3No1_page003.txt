THE JANUARY PAPERS

I wrote the first draft

of a novel called The January Papers.

It was about varieties of self-love:
suicide, ambition and sex.

It was about the inability to relate
to people without needing them,
about trapped women,
about male and lethal art.

It was about repetition
and the making of family myths,
about moving from place to place,
about politics and revolution.

It was about the number of pages
I've filled with thirty years of waste --
my own and other people's ---
trying to make sense of what's
happened to me and what I've done.

It was about words and how
they were going to kill me.

It was about how January
was the dead of winter,
but could also be a beginning.

It was about the oppressed emotions:
about fear and anger.

A friend read the draft

and developed a headache,

but I still didn't know how

sickening the manuscript was

until I tried to rewrite it.

When I say I destroyed The January Papers
that is an example of words

trying to kill me.

I was going to burn it,

but it was easier to throw it in a pail.
I wrote this poem before the act of disposal
because I want words to serve me

better than they have.

I have been crazy

and though it frightened me,

it once seemed like the only
sensible thing to do.

Even now I am tempted to be

a little grandiose.

But this time I will let simple words
describing the daily act of

throwing out the garbage

be sufficient.

DEADLINES
(for Alfonsina Storni 1892-1938)

Yesterday I learned of another poet
dead by her own hand.

For panicky moments I choked her
into a locket with other

writers and suicides

who hang at my throat.

Though this is dangerous ground for me
I'm not here from old obsessions,

but because too many of us

are lost from death cuddling,

and perhaps I can encourage

plagued sisters

not to be their own executioners,

not to give blood in a ghoulish society,

to have accidents, if necessary.

From the frozen skull
that was yesterday's fear,
from being fucked
over
and over and over,
I conceive
an unwanted, cancerous hate,
a tumor in my gentleness,
that knows at last
which end of the weapon
to sight along.

RAVI, WHERE IS THE MUSIC

for 200,000 moslem women
who gave their bodies
for Bangladesh?

200,000 women
wounded in a war of liberation.
200,000 semen-soaked victims

of their husbands' sensibilities.
200,000 prisoners of peace

who are not avenged,
comforted or honored
by words which are not more
than an inky monument

of a woman

with her dress over her head
and an inscription

on her belly and thighs:

Here lies and lies and lies Bangladesh.
