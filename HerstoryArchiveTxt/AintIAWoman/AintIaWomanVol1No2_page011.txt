In the interest of bringing  
women together and in an attempt  
at experimenting with communal  
living several sisters in Iowa  
City have formed an all women's  
collective. We're hoping that  
living together will do several  
things. First, by pooling all our  
incomes we can free some of the  
sisters from oppressive work so  
that they can do full-time worthwhile  
work. Also, living together  
makes us physically close, enabling  
us to study together, work  
together, share the shit work,  
and to share the exciting moments  
together. We formed the collective  
hoping that it would be a  
place where all our sisters and  
us could come to get ourselves  
together and eventually find alternative  
lifestyles and philosophies  
for the future.  

We have lived together in a  
large house for just about one  
month. There are six sisters who  
actually live in the house and  
two more sisters who will join  
us in the fall when they return  
from traveling. Two of the sisters  
help organize and run the  
two free day care centers in Iowa  
City. Other sisters in the house  
help at the day care centers and  
work full-time at straight jobs.  
All the money that people earn  
is pooled together. Sisters contribute  
anything from a full month's  
salary to food stamps only. This  
all goes into either our  
household kitty or our checking  
account.  

Thus far the collective has  
made several structural decisions.  

First, we have regular closed  
meetings to discuss issues or  
problems at hand. This is  
a time when we have been con-  
sciousness raising. At first we  
thought that having closed meet-  
ings may have been an elitist  
thing to do. But in the interest  
of experimenting with a small  
core of the same people we decided  
that it was necessary. Also,  
we have decided that there will  
be no men in the house. This de-  
cision was made in the effort to  
support the goals that we have  
made for ourselves. If women are  
truly to get themselves together  
then they need someplace where  
they may go and always know that  
the open arms of a sister await  
them. We think of our house as a  
place where married sisters, high  
school sisters, and all others  
may come to talk if they have  
problems or to have fun if they  
need to get away for a while. It  
has been difficult to not allow  
men in the house, because there  
always seem to be those excep-  
tions. However, the rule of never  
any men in our house has esta-  
blished an atmosphere to the  
house that we all agree is won-  
derful. It is very important  
that we do not become co-opted  
on this point. We also decided  
that there will be no dope in the  
house. Especially these two de-  
cisions came after a large dis-  
cussion on how disciplined we  
want to become.  

As previously mentioned we had  
decided to have collective meet-  
ings at least once a week. We  
usually try to schedule collec-  
tive meetings on a night when  
there are no cell meetings and  
as often per week as we can. In-  
itially these meetings were main-  
ly concerned with very basic fun-  
ctions of the collective. For ex-  
ample, we had to discuss how  
housework, money, meetings, cars,  
etc., were to be taken care of.  
However, we also began to discuss  
theoretical issues such as sis-  
terhood, loving women, elitism,  
self-discipline, group protection,  
pigs, etc. All of these discus-  
sions led to consciousness rais-  
ing. In the future we hope to  
have special periods of time set  
aside just for consciousness  
raising.  

The household responsibilities  
have been divided so that two  
people cook every evening meal,  
and two people do the pots and  
pans after each person does their  
own dishes. We all eat dinner to-  
gether at seven o'clock, and usu-  
ally there are many other sisters  
who sit down to eat with us. The  
weekly cleaning is done on Satur-  
day when two sisters plan the  
meals for a week and buy the gro-  
ceries, two do all the laundry,  
and two plus any other sisters  
who come clean the house. These  
jobs are rotated each week, and  
no one is ever left to do anything  
by herself.  

We've not had a lot of time to  
really become as close to each  
other as we hope to become. Thus  
far many of us have been out of  
town frequently. However, in a  
month's time we have definitely  
become much closer among our-  
selves and to the many sisters  
who spend a lot of time at our  
collective.

Economically, women's col-  
lectives are highly desirable.  
A single woman has a much harder  
time than a bachelor. She re-  
ceives less pay for more and  
shittier work, insurance compa-  
nies', the government's and  
other institutions’ policies  
make it harder financially to  
be single. However, if the wo-  
man marries, she fits right in-  
to the capitalistic system of  
economics. She can be written  
off as a "dependent" or an "ex-  
emption." A collective with other  
women would be less expen-  
sive since costs would be shared.  
The collective would be an  
institution (a new institution  
in society!) and as such, could  
buy food etc. more cheaply.  

Women, by forming their own  
collectives are saying two  
things at the same time; “Fuck  
men" and "Up with the new revo-  
lution."  

In saying “Fuck men" the  
collective points out that wo-  
men's oppression exists today  
and will continue to exist un-  
less women learn to depend more  
upon each other and less upon  
men. In the collective women  
would live together, acquire  
knowledge of their own strength,  
and constantly reinforce each  
other's efforts. In co-ed col-  
lectives it has been all too  
easy for women to assume the  
traditional roles of cooking,  
cleaning, etc. In a woman's  
collective women would learn to  
make repairs, keep the car run-  
ning, make furniture, etc.  

More importantly however, in  
a woman's collective women  
would learn to look to their  
sisters, not men, for approval.  
This will come about through  
living together which necessi-  
tates decisions and actions  
that will reinforce strengths  
and confidence.  

If the idea of women's col-  
lectives sounds threatening, it  
is to men. Women are making  
definite political moves which  
puts pressure on the men to  
overcome their male chauvinism.  

Women are saying our oppressi-  
on will not be passed over in the  
revolution as it has everywhere  
else. (In Cuba and China they  
are slowly working out women's eq-  
uity.)  

Further, women are saying  
there will not be another revo-  
lution unless women's oppressio-  
n is ended. Women's collecti-  
ves start at getting women to de-  
pend upon each other and a start  
to relieve oppression, both of  
which will be necessary achievements  
if women are to be liberated in  
the forthcoming revolution. In fact,  
the liberation of women in the  
revolution insures that it will  
be socialist or communist as  
male and female roles and relation-  
ships are destroyed.  

Learning to stop competing  
with our sisters and to start  
relying upon them will be impor-  
tant lessons in the commune. Once  
we trust, rely upon, and love each  
other it will give us faith and  
strength to convince other women  
(because they really are worth  
our time and effort) and to stop  
males from oppressing us. We  
love and receive strength from  
each other in our struggle to  
effect a revolution which must  
liberate women in order to be suc-  
cessful.  

Up with women's collectives!  
Power to the sisterhood!
