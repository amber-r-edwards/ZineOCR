Marilyn is a gay woman with two children who lives in  
Cedar Rapids, Iowa. She gets ADC (Aid to Dependent  

Children) to support herself and the kids. She lives  
with Marcey. WIN stands for Work Incentive, a welfare  

program to get ADC mothers into the workforce. GED  
is a high school equivalency test. In this interview  
Marilyn talks about herself and what it's like to be  
gay and on welfare.  

I'll be 25 soon. I have 2 kids, one 4 and one just 3. I don't  
think anyone at the welfare office knows I'm gay. I don't hide  
it purposely, I just don't come out in the open and say "Guess  
what?" The only thing I would worry about is for the kids. Like  
me, I don't particularly care for hiding things; I like to come  
right out in the open. But I'd be more worried about what they  
would do about my kids--like take them away from me. Because I  
do love my kids.  

Q. I'm trying to find out how being on ADC is different for you  
than for someone who's straight.  

A. I think they have more problems than I do! They won't find any  
men's clothing, that's for sure! Unless one of us starts dressing  
like a man!  

Q. Have you had any problems with being gay or do you think it's  
this last food stamp thing that's getting you?  

A. I think if they had any way...see, it's like they've never  
said anything to me, and if they did think this and didn't say no-  
thing about it, it'd be the thing they're getting at in a round  
about way. Because all of a sudden, bang--this food stamp thing.  
Q. What exactly is happening with your food stamps?  

A. They're taking me off ‘cause Marcey's with me. The only way  
I can get back on them, so they say, is if Marcey leaves. And  
to me, if they all of a sudden say that, because she's been with  
me over a year and they knew that she was always with me  
that's the thing they said to me, either Marcey goes or  
I get food stamps, which I think maybe is their own way, without  
telling me what they think. My social worker has asked me person-  
al questions. Never anything like are you gay or anything, but  
it's been in a way that she could probably make up her own ver-  
sion.  

Q. Has she ever asked anything about men?  

A. Yeah, like about birth control. She tried to get me on birth  
control when I first came out here. That was at the beginning  

of this great thing here with Marcey. I refused it and the so-  
cial worker wanted to know why. I didn't come out and say any-  
thing, though. But she's not dumb. But the food stamp thing they  
say is because we're not blood relatives. Even with all the oth-  
er reasons they're giving me, I still think it could be the other  
thing.  

Q. Do you think they would be hassling you if Marcey were a man?  
A. I have the feeling they wouldn't. I could be wrong, you real-  
ly can't tell. They just make sure they know what laws they're  
going by when you ask, and show you the book. I hope we can get  
around it, but I doubt it. And I'm sure not going to say that  
Marcey has to go. This is what they want me to say, ‘cause they  
already said it. Or I could leave and go on my own.  

I feel bad for the fact that I have to hide because it's  
something that I'm not ashamed of and yet, at the same time, to  
live in the society that we're living in and then too for the  
kids, I do it. If I didn't have 2 kids I wouldn't have to worry  
so much about people finding out. I think of them too. Although  
when they get older they are going to have to be told. But it's  
alright now.  

My social worker got insulted because I said my kids didn't  
need a man in the house. And other people have asked me if I  
think my kids will turn out gay. I mean, I'm not going to say to  
them "Well, this is what your mother is and this is what you're  
supposed to be." They're going to know that there's two worlds.  
It's going to be up to them. Because I think that's where my par-  
ents failed. I didn't know which way to turn and as I was grow-  
ing up they were pushing this marriage thing at me all the time  
and I just didn't know if that's what I wanted. I mean, I'm  
still a woman, no matter what and I knew I did want to have child-  
ren someday but I didn't know if the gay thing was the thing I  
was going to stick by. I went out with fellas and was engaged  
twice before I was married, but my parents always pushed it on me.  

I think that if welfare feels that you're a one parent family  
that you can't bring your children up right, and this gets me very  
mad. This social worker wanted me to go to Parents Without Partners  
Club, I mean, you know, I think I'm doing the best I can and they  
have the love and attention I think they need and you know, she  
says "Well you're only one parent and you don't know what you're  
doing." She doesn't even have any children and she's gonna tell me  
how to take care of mine!  

There's been a couple of times that she's been here and Marcey's  
come home. One thing I give Marcey credit for -- if there's some-  
thing said that she don't like then she'll tell them. And I can do  
that with social services, it's not that I can't stand up but I  
feel that I have to deal with them and I can't make it harder on  
myself. If it goes too far then I will say something, but I don't  
say it in a nasty way because I got to deal with them. They could  
hurt me. I know they could. They could cut me off. They could make  
it hard for me just the way they're doing now.  

And like this WIN program deal, I mean, I do want to do some-  
thing later cause I know if I did go back to factory work, it's not  
gonna be worthwhile moneywise. That's the only reason I'm going to  
this secretarial school is to make it better later. The deal is  
that I didn't finish high school and there was a program where I  
could go get my GED and from there the WIN program came up.  

Q. What kinds of things did they offer you on the WIN program?  
A. This is what got me mad. They said to me, “This program blah  
blah blah, and you can have what you like." So in the beginning I  
had this great thought that I was interested in IBM. This is what  
I had said. In the meantime they send me down to the unemployment  
thing, make me take this aptitude test or whatever the hell they  
are, next thing I know they're telling me I come out high in math  
and all sorts of stuff and it looked like that I was good for being  
a secretary. So nobody mentions IBM. The next thing they say that  
there was no place in Cedar Rapids to do this IBM. Then the secre-  
tarial school came up. But they never said other things I could do.  
They just said, "You scored high on the secretarial thing." They  
never mentioned anything else.  

And the thing is, I've never known anyone to finish on the WIN  
program. And like the woman who works at my school, she says she  
hopes I finish because it will make her school look good. And I  
mean this is what makes me mad. They're all looking out for them-  

selves, the hell with the other person, which I don't think is fair.  

But it's true, this is the only way out if you're on ADC but they  
should offer other stuff. They just say, “This is for you." I mean  
how do they know? I can't picture myself sitting at no desk all day  
'cause I don't like it. I have to move around.  

My social worker told me about another woman who had a similar  
situation. She said, "Oh, well I thought she'd make you feel better.  
She had some of the problems you had. Her husband left her and she  
went through the WIN program and now she's working at this job."  
What do I care what she's doing? But this is what she does and this  
is what aggravates me. And my friend who's going to be a social worker  
told me most of the time they just come to see your house and who's  
there. I never believed how sneaky they could be but this is how it is.  

Q. When is your divorce final?  

A. In July. And I'm making Marcey the guardian of the kids in case  
anything happens to them. The only reason I did that was, it may  
sound stupid but if I drop dead I don't want my husband walking in  
and taking my two kids.  

Q. What was it like with your family back home?  

A. Well, they were rough on me. They were really strict. As far  
as, you know, we were noted as -- well they called it Lesbian. I  
never heard the word gay. And they said this before I knew. I knew  
I had the feelings. But I didn't, you know -- what the hell they  
talking about. What do they do?! I couldn’t figure out -- I knew I  
had all these mixed feelings but I couldn't figure out what they  
were talking about! Really funny. I think the funniest part was  
when I got married. When I had my baby my mother came into the  

Q. Do you know anyone on the WIN program who's doing anything  
besides secretarial work?  

A. The lady who babysits for me, her daughter is going to be a  
beautician. So the way it looked to me is there's nothing that's  
really great, the way they're talking. The way they're saying it  
to you is, you can go to be a doctor but yet I haven't seen it from  
what they're offering. And I haven't heard of anyone who did.  

Anyway, I don't like this kind of work. And now, I'm up to 50  
words a minute of typing, so like any time now I expect it, and  
it's happened to another girl and she got very disgusted. They come  
to you, you don't get paid for it, but you go down to Social Ser-  
vices and type. You go to school from 8 to 12 and from 1 to 5 you  
go to Social Services and type up all their papers for them. You  
know what it's for? For experience! This is what they're telling  
you. And they had a girl do that and she left school. She wouldn't  
come back no more. She said she'd had it. Not just because she  
didn't get paid but for the idea of the way they're doing it. You  
know, saying "This is for experience." And they won't let you have  
another job unless it's the field you're going into. And I don't  
think it's fair. And it's partly my fault because I don't fight her  
off but I just can't risk it.  

And they're always sending somebody. The last time I wanted to  
leave the program, they sent this woman, I didn't know who the hell  
she was from Adam, they sent her from Des Moines. "Hello," she said  
with a big smile on her face, "I'm so-and-so, tell me your problems  
and why you want to leave the program." I said to myself, what the  
hell is this shit? I call up the social worker and say, “What are  
you doing? I don't know this lady! I'm not gonna sit here and tell  

my life story." She said, "Oh, well I thought she'd make you  
feel better. She had some of the problems you had. Her husband  
left her and she went through the WIN program and now she's working  
at this job." What do I care what she's doing? But this is what  
she does and this is what aggravates me. And my friend who's  
going to be a social worker told me most of the time they just  
come to see your house and who's there. I never believed how  
sneaky they could be but this is how it is.
