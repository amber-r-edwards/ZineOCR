FEELING RIGHTEOUS

The whole thing

came clear to me today

just the way it really is,

man on the top,

woman fighting from the bottom,
and I feel righteous.

I am hearing Nina Simone

sing out her song

you can't keep this woman down
and I feel

righteous.

the sound goes right through
my spine

and down to

my toes

and I am

laughing

deep down inside myself because
I feel righteous.

there's nothing

hazy about it now.

the whole thing is

perfectly clear.

there's no way

to keep a righteous woman down.
we will be free; my heart

is free today

and you can hear it sing

the way we're all going to sing
because

we're all going to sing every day
we're going to sing

every righteous,

goddamn day.

"That man over there says that a woman
needs to be helped into carriages, and
lifted over ditches, and to have the
best place everywhere. Nobody ever
helped me into carriages, or over mud
puddles, or gives me a best place ever.
And ain't I a woman? Look at me.
Look at my arm! I have plowed
and planted and gathered into
barns, and no man could head me...
And ain't I a woman? I could work as
much and eat as much as a man when I
could get it, and bear the lash as well...
And ain't I a woman? I have born
thirteen children and seen them
most all sold off into slavery. And
when I cried out with a mother's grief,
none but Jesus heard...

And ain't I a woman?"

Sojourner Truth: Speech before the Women's
Rights Convention at Akron, Ohio in 1851.
