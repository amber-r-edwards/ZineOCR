The importance of the  
hand position on the grip  
of a pistol cannot be  
overemphasized,

The hand should be as  
high on the grip as is  
allowed by the rear  
extension of the hammer.

After extending the gun,  
the right thumb rests  
along the frame on top  
of the cylinder latch.

spur of the revolver.  
The gun is cradled under  
the trigger guard in the  
left hand. The hammer  
should be drawn back to  
the full cock position  
with the right thumb.

These exercises use muscles in  
forehead and scalp (1) and at  
medial end of eyebrows (2).

The left thumb should  
then be placed between  
the hammer and the  
frame to prevent acci-  
dental firing. The "V"  
formed by the right  
thumb and the first finger  
is then fitted as high as  
possible on the grip.

The heel of the hand is  
solidly behind the grip  

so gun will recoil straight  
back.

While the cocking motion  

is going on the pistol is  
being brought back to  
aiming position.

The first finger should  
be placed on the trigger  
almost up to the first  
joint.

The left thumb stays be-  
tween hammer and frame  
until the gun is extended  
for firing.

If held correctly the  
pistol will recoil almost  

straight up and will  
stay in line with the  

target.
