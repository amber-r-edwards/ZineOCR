TODAY  
I WAS SO UNCOMFORTABLE  
GETTING HOME DIDN'T FIX IT  
EVERYTHING I TOUCHED TURNED TO SHIT  
I SPILLED THINGS,  
SPILLED COFFEE IN THE EGGS  
SPILLED EGG POWDER ON THE RUG  
THINGS DIDN'T WORK RIGHT,  
FRUSTRATING EVERYTHING  
PLAYED MY GUITAR,  
COULD NOT FIND MY GUITAR PICK  
AND FINGERS STARTED HURTING  
TODAY ALL SORTS OF THINGS  

FRUSTRATED ME  

NIGHT I AM SO HARD UP  

FOR SOMETHING TO BE NICE  
TONIGHT I COULD FEEL  

VERY DEMANDING.  

TENSION  

THE PHONE IS RINGING OFF THE WALL  
AND YOU  

AND I  

DEFY EACH OTHER TO ANSWER IT.  

BOO EE  

A Woman?
