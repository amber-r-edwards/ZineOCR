We talked about men and women today.

It seems there's a new theory out.

Did you know Man's a million years old?  
And during those million years

Men and women developed differently.  
Yes, they did.

Men hunted.

Women had babies.

And because woman had babies

Who couldn't cling,

Who were helpless and dependent for a long time,  
She couldn't hunt with the men.

So she stayed home and made a nest

And gathered food to bring to it.

Ain't I A Woman is published

Okay. Maybe so.

But he says that women have evolved in this pattern.  
That we are genetically set up to stay home  
And feather a nest

And raise young.

Logic, reason,

Evolution, biology,

Fucking up my mind.

Beautiful masculine progression

Proving beyond a shadow of a doubt

That women are "different".

That women are “nurturant".

That women are "gatherers".

Never argue with a biologist.

We are a collective of eight  
women functioning as a world  
wide conspiracy of Radical  
Lesbians.

But

if this is so,

Then why is my soul screaming, "no, no, no!"  
Why do I look at the stars at night,  
Or a distant mountain top

And yearn to fly;

To reach, struggle, climb;

To find my place in the universe;

To leave the nest far behind

And carve out a stairway to infinity--  
Why?
