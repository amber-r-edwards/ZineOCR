Harriet Tubman  

I like to think of Harriet Tubman.  
Harriet Tubman who carried a revolver,  
who had a scar on her head from a rock thrown  
by a slave-master (because she  

talked back), and who  

had a ransom on her head  

of thousands of dollars and who  

was never caught, and who  

had no use for the law  

when the law was wrong,  

who defied the law. I like  

to think of her.  

I like to think of her especially  

when I think of the problem of  

feeding children.  

The legal answer  

to the problem of feeding children  
is ten free lunches every month,  
being equal, in the child's real life,  
to eating lunch every other day.  
Monday but not Tuesday.  

I like to think of the President  
eating lunch Monday, but not  
Tuesday.  

and when I think of the President  
and the law, and the problem of  
feeding children, I like to  

think of Harriet Tubman  

and her revolver.  

And then sometimes  
I think of the President  
and other men,  
men who practice the law,  
who revere the law,  
who enforce the law  
who live behind  
and operate through  
and feed themselves  
at the expense of  
starving children  
because of the law,  
men who sit in paneled offices  
and think about vacations  
and tell women  
whose care it is  
to feed children  
not to be hysterical  
not to be hysterical as in the word  
hysterikos, the Greek for  
womb suffering,  
not to suffer in their  
wombs,  
not to care,  
not to bother the men  
because they want to think  
of other things  
and do not want  
to take the women seriously.  
I want them to take women seriously.  
I want them to think about Harriet Tubman  
and remember,  
remember she was beat by a white man  
and she lived  
and she lived to redress her grievance,  
and she lived in swamps  
and wore the clothes of a man  
bringing hundreds of fugitives from  
slavery, and was never caught,  
and led an army,  
and won a battle,  
and defied the laws  
because the laws were wrong, I want men  
to take us seriously.  
I am tired wanting them to think  
about right and wrong.  
I want them to fear.  

the People  

I want them to feel fear now  

as I have felt suffering in the womb, and  
I want them  
to know  
that there is always a time  
there is always a time to make right  
what is wrong,  
there is always a time  
for retribution  
and that time  
is beginning.
