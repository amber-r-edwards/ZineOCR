I used to say

my mother's hands

were like a man's.

But to tell the truth

I haven't seen a man's

with skin so coarse

and cracks and cuts

so deep that washing

doesn't touch the permanent dirt.

My mother

liked work.

She could throw

her weight into

pushing her car

rather than repairing it,
lifting her grown children
off the ground

to greet them

rather than kissing them,
tearing rags

rather than sewing patches.

She wanted me and the boys
to fight our own battles,
and if you called

for her interference

she would claim indifference
unless blood was drawn.

She was not affectionate.

She never aroused in me

a false emotion,

but she taught me things

about blood and love and sorrow
that will not go away.

She and I have left

almost everything unsaid,

and now there is nothing to say:

no recriminations, no protestations,
no silliness of any kind.

We have declared

peace from exhaustion.
