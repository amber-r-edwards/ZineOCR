DEAR SISTERS:  

I just had a long talk with my girlfriend,  
who is also Gay and 16 now, it was about  
separatist politics. I was saying Gay wo-  
men should come together more and stick  
together, she was saying that in every Gay  
except DOB, Gay Women's Liberation Front  
and Radicalesbians there are Gay men, we  
both agreed that me and her should go more  
often to the all-women's Gay groups more,  
instead of trying to (with a few other Les-  
bians) represent Lesbians in Gay groups  
such as GAA (Gay Activists Alliance) main-  
ly because they are mostly male and the  
few female Gay groups are very small, be-  
cause so many Lesbians are involved with  
straight sisters and Gay men, so we de-  
cided to give more attention to other Gay  
women, who have the all-women's groups,  
instead of the sisters who belong to the  
GAA etc., but to them also. Shit, did I  
just make sense?  

One thing we had an argument on was the  
fact about judging a Lesbian first about  
her Gayness then about her as a person.  

We agreed that we're PEOPLE, and that la-  
bels put upon women such as "gay" or  
"straight" just divide women, because male  
society teaches women to be "straight" and  
to ignore us, the Gay women.  

So we just want to say ALL WOMEN ARE LES-  
BIANS, no matter how absurd that sounds,  
all women are capable of loving and giv-  
ing energy to other women, if they want  
to. Me and my girlfriend don't agree on  
everything, like I ONLY GIVE ENERGY TO Wo-  
MEN, BUT SHE ALSO GIVES IT TO GAY MEN, so  
I'm separatist (I only go with women, un-  
less I have to be with Gay men) I only go  
to women, but here I am back to the names  
"gay" and "straight". I said all women  

page 12  

are Gay, right? well I also give energy  

to so-called "straight" sisters, in the  
women's movement, and out. Of course not  
all "straight" sisters like Lesbians, so  
I have that problem. I REFUSE TO ASSOCI-  
ATE WITH "STRAIGHT" MALES. My girlfriend  
is right about the LABELS, "straight",  
"gay" and "bisexual" she's right but unfor-  
tunately those labels exist because of the  
way people are, and the way "society" is.  
At least Gay men aren't as bad as straight  
men, because they don't hassle women as  
much. Of course most Gay men hate women,  
not all women, just as we don't dig men,  
as for me I can't stand a lot of men, but  
that doesn't mean I can't associate with  
them if I HAVE TO. I'd rather prefer be-  

ing with women only, but in this world it —  

is impossible to be separated from men.  
Unless you stay with other women, in all  
day, or form all women communes (not a  
bad idea).  
do form all women's open communes, they're  
usually a tight collective not open to a  
lot of other women interested. Did you  
ever read SPECTRE? It's about separatist  
Lesbians who ONLY give energy to women.  
Anyway, they always talk about how we  
should come together more, I think they  
are right on, but HOW can we get toget-  
her? It's not easy, just as it's not  
easy being new in a group or coming alone  
to a meeting, and not knowing anyone there  
get what I mean? That's what me and my  
girlfriend were talking about, we both  
don't have many other friends, so we de-  
cided to go to those groups together and  
to make new friends, besides helping the  
Lesbian movement, since we're Lesbians,  
we shouldn't have our own little world  
for ourselves and separate ourselves  

from other Gay women, so we hope to real-  
ly come out more with our gay sisters.

Unfortunately, not many women.  

NE ay Dp  

When I'm horny I bet I'll think of you  
and how for this whole time  

my pants are always wet  

and yet there is no guilt or embarrassment  
like usual--This obsession with  
you just pleases me  

thinking of little more than the  
next time you can touch me  

and I'm full of pleasure  

all the time enjoying my  
expectation  

Involved on other levels before  

I used to fear the shame  

attached to what I thought  

this would be like and now  

that I'm here see that those  
feelings belong to the perceptions  
of that other level and have  
nothing to do with this time and  
reality of wanting to make it  
with you all the time  

My fears too have been unfounded  

that allowing myself such pleasure  

I would detach those other  

feelings of compassion, understanding  

so involved with the animal in  

my women's body pressed against  

your women's body  

my lust consuming me  

becoming a sphere of sensation  

twirling and throwing off the other  
feelings I am afraid to lose touch with  
Floating under the command of the twinge in  
my cunt  

Never did I see before the detachment  

as just the momentary suspension of  

my other selves  

to allowance for that part of me to live  
and rule unhampered for these moments by  
the other realities of my life
