A REAL CASTRATING FEMALE**

**THE KARATE RIP-OFF**

Last fall a few women in Iowa City Women's  
Liberation took a self-defense class offered by  
some men from the university karate club. We  
learned the basic self-defense techniques:  
snap kick to the groin, eye jab, chop to throat,  
hammer-fist to groin, and elbow jab. We prac-  
ticed the snap kick continually because the in-  
structors said it must be instinctive in order  
to be effective—if you stop to think for one  
moment it would be too late. Well, we listened  
to what they said, practiced the snap kick,  
grew stronger, and became more confident until  
all of a sudden it dawned on us that we might  
have to really use it. Even though we were be-  
coming physically strong, we realized that our  
mental response to an attack would be passive  
struggling. We would practice the eye jab, but  
deep inside we thought it was too terrible to  
use.

Our socialization became clear to us, and as  
we tried to overcome it, its power over us be-  
came even clearer. For months we agonized over  
the obvious contradiction in our thinking. We  
couldn't see ourselves responding with force to  
outrageously brutal attacks against women. We  
are still struggling with this. Self-defense  
is a psychological discipline too.

In Feb. these same male instructors began  
teaching a class in Tang Soo Do, a Korean school  
of karate. There were 20 in the class: about 4  
men and all the rest women, among whom 10 were  

Karate was a rocky road from beginning to  
end. One thing a lot of us had trouble with was  
the mindless, male, marine discipline. I agree  
with the need for strict discipline in a karate  
class, but it goes completely against my grain  
to blindly obey a rule for which no reason is  
given. The instructor would say "Don't ask  
questions in class" and I'd say "Why?" and he'd  
say "Just don't." This problem comes up again  
in the big rip-off, which I will now describe.

We came to karate class as usual one even-  
ing and were summoned to the other end of the  
mat by two instructors (hereafter to be refer-  
red to as #1 and #2) for a meeting.

#2 said "You read it" and #1 said "You read  
it" so #2 finally read it. It was a write-up  
(inaccurate) of an incident that happened when  
6 of us in WLF went to speak to a high school  
in Davenport. We were eating lunch in the cafe-  
teria (two of us were wearing our doboks so we  
must have "looked funny"), when 3 boys sat  
down at an adjacent table and began to heckle  
us. The heckling centered around the question  
of whether Anne was a girl or a boy and contin-  
ued for five minutes. I was really getting mad be-  
cause this used to happen to me all the time  
when my hair was short and I knew how Anne must  
be feeling. Then the biggest boy (about six  
feet) who had already made one reconnaissance  
pass by our table "to get a better look" came  
up, leaned over to Anne and leered, "Hey, are  
you a girl or a boy?"

Pat, Phyllis and I jumped up. Pat threw a  
beautiful kick to his groin but it missed be-  
cause I grabbed him by the shirt and pushed him  
back to his own table and forced him down into  
a chair. I was screaming at him about how he  
doesn't call Black people niggers because he's  
scared of them and how he'd better start being  
scared of women because we're not putting up  
with this shit anymore. Francie and Anne went  
over to him after we sat down and tried to talk  
to them about chauvinism. The big boy asked if  
Anne would accept his apology. She said no.

Anyway, #2 finished reading the clipping and  
started in on a sickening sexist tirade:

Him: (close paraphrase) Now, I've been  
called a nigger many times which is a much  
worse insult than this and I never responded  
with karate. It would be a different thing if  

I were out with my girl and somebody tried to  
touch her private parts, then I would have to  
use karate to protect her. Besides if someone  
came up and "kicked me in my baby-maker," I  
would be likely to kill her.

There we were. Supposed to be listening  
with respect to our instructors who were spewing  
all that sexist crap. I just couldn't take  
it:

Me: Just a minute. For one thing you pro-  
bably have responded physically to being called  
nigger and if you haven't that's your problem.  
And another thing, we don't have to sit here  
and listen to you telling us what is and isn't  
an insult against women. So fuck it!

#1, who had been staring at the floor with  
a look of disgust on his face, said "You don't  
talk back to an instructor."

Authority figures make Phyllis cry, so she  
got up to leave. I left with her to see if I  
could help. We held each other and cried and  
felt totally frustrated because we knew there  
was nothing we could do. We wanted to learn  
karate and they held all the cards.

When we finally got back to the meeting,  
#1 was telling us that we were only orange belts  
and that we could not give any more karate  
demonstrations without him. We mentioned that  
it was politically important that women give  
them alone. He said no. That was that.

We went to a local restaurant to reconnoiter.  
We decided that I shouldn't have gotten mad and  
Phyllis shouldn't be upset because it reduced  
our effectiveness. To prevent this in the  
future we invented a distress signal (fist with  
thumb up) which means close the ranks so we  
are physically closer and can help each other!  
We also decided that the only weapon we had  
for collective bargaining against #1 was his  
desire for good students to build his reputa-  
tion as an instructor. We established the  
policy that if any sister got kicked out of  
class for outside use of karate that didn't  
meet the approval of the instructor, then we'd  
all walk out. But if a sister got kicked out  
for a breach of discipline during class we  
would remain in class and teach her out of  
class. (We compromised here because we feel  
it is necessary for women to learn karate.)

We came to our next karate class armed with  
these plans to find that we had been ripped  
off. All the qualified male instructors re-  
fused to teach us for various reasons. One  
said we didn't realize that it was a privilege  
to learn karate. He was in a class where the  
instructor used to knock people out while they  
were at attention to see how long it took them  
to get up. It was a privilege to be knocked  
out. Another said he would not teach people  
who would do anything so "disgustingly sub-  
human" as wear their doboks into a bar. One  
said that karate was his religion and we had  
violated it by not knowing innately where to  
wear our doboks. #2 gave us back our quarters  
for the board we didn't get to break, and we  
left.

(You know what I think? I don't think it  
was religious at all, I think it was the groin  
kick. Dig it.)

We thought that that was the end of karate  
because we felt we needed an instructor to  
make us work. With some doubt, therefore, we  
started holding a class every night from 5:30-  
6:30 at Wesley House to teach other women what  
we know and to work out. We've found that  
collective teaching reduces the inherent elit-  
ism in teaching and makes the class less strat-  
ified.

Still, we really need to learn more karate  
so if anyone is inclined to develop a mail  
order course we'd appreciate it.

**FEMALES  
AND  
SELF-DEFENSE**

The ever-increasing rate of the traditional crimes  
against women has prompted women's magazines and news-  
papers to issue warnings and offer advice to their fe-  
male readers. We are warned not to go out unaccompanied  
after dark, but if we must venture out alone, we are  
advised to carry alarms, mace, nail files, to avoid  
enticing clothing, and of course if attacked—scream,  
so some passing man will come to our rescue.

The crimes against women are the most blatant ex-  
pression of the pervasive attitude of men towards  
women. While some of us have not experienced the ex-  
treme, all of us have been subjected to the more  
"harmless" forms—being handled, whistled at, pinched,  
hooted at. You don't treat an equal human being like  
that. Any female not under the "protection" of a male  
is "free game." If she's not private property, then  
she's public property.

We have depended on males to "protect" us too long.  
The right to protect is also the right to oppress. It  
is time that all females learn to defend themselves.

Males are taught how to take care of themselves  
while growing up. Females are systematically denied  
this right. Our culture does not allow women to de-  
velop strength. Girls are not supposed to do physical  
things. The result is that women are pitifully weak.  
The psychological consequences are of even greater  
significance. Women feel they should be weak, that  
they need a man to protect them.

Women's physical weakness and its psychological  
consequences can only be overcome through developing  
their bodies. Of the various forms of self-defense,  
karate enables you to become consciously aware of your  
physical potential by teaching you to mobilize your  
whole body. Only when we have gained the self-confidence  
that comes through developing our physical potential and  
exercising it, will we be able to gain any individual  
mobility.

It is a basic and immediate necessity that all women  
be given access to free self-defense instruction. In-  
dividual women should not have to pay to learn how to  
defend themselves. It is not an individual problem.  
Women should demand that free self-defense instruction  
be provided by towns, schools, businesses, welfare  
departments...all institutions which have direct control  
over women's lives.

The attacks on women will stop only when it becomes  
as dangerous to attack a woman as it is to attack  
another man.

**THE SISTERS REACT:**

Taking karate seemed to dramatize a certain  
recurring situation I find myself in. I often  
feel in the position of powerlessness. Eng-  
aged at being in that position but feeling it  
so strongly I generally cry. In karate, I felt  
this really intensely when we had to spar  
(free fight)—completely weak & powerless.  
There was no way that I could win. The only  
choices I seemed to have were in just what  
manner I would take my defeat. This was just  
too super a symbolic inaction of what I have  
too often felt in my lifetime. I also am very  
small (height & bone structure) and no matter  
how much better I got at blocking I felt bat-  
tered & because of a physical factor over  
which I had no choice. I spent many classes  
trying merely to get through the class without  
crying. Then one night I felt really bruta-  
lized & weak & all that crap & I was about to  
cry when I got really mad & wanted to hurt  
back. I realize that is not the answer but it  
felt a lot healthier than wanting to cry. It  
seemed like a beginning & I really started to  
dig karate.

When the shit started to fall I felt pretty  
disappointed at the thought of no longer being  
able to take karate, but my other reactions  
were much stronger. I felt, despite all the  
terrific, mystical, martial arts reasons that  
our instructor had, under all that it was a  
plain old political act. Political women scare  
people, especially men, & he wasn't so diffe-  
rent from most men. I also had that feeling I  
always have when someone is giving all these  
logical reasons for controlling, confining &  
dominating someone. There are no acceptable  
reasons for doing that to anyone. I often let  
someone do it to me but not because it is sen-  
sible to do it, but I give in because I am  
still very weak. Each time I do, I hate a  
little more—hate the person in authority, the  
situation, & myself. I didn't want any of that  
this time. I've been through it before.

Very soon after I joined Women’s Liberation,  
I joined the karate class. I wondered if an  
all-women group could get together in their  
heads enough about doing these violent actions  
which all our lives we learned were not really  
socially acceptable for a woman to do. At first  
most of us were a little uneasy about the po-  
tential roughness, but very soon, I think, we  
began learning that we can train our minds &  
bodies to make use of the anger that is in all  
of us. Considering the very legitimate reasons  
for that anger, I found it easy to understand  
when a sister who had always been gentle &  
sensitive around her sisters came at me with  
the ferocity of an unleashed panther. I felt  
proud of my sisters & myself for being able to  
show & use the anger & aggressiveness that we  
as females had for so long kept tucked away  
somewhere because society called it "unfemi-  
nine.” Karate teaches us to feel good & confi-  
dent about our own ability to use our anger  
in self-defense.

**A Woman? CY Joly 16, 1470**

Today is Thursday  
evening and we, my brother and I, got turned away  
from our karate class by the goon squad at U of I  
athletic building because we had no ID cards like  
the students coming to see the game...then we  
suggested they go ask the instructors.

So we should have run up the stairs to our sisters  
screaming here come the pigs GET THEM which would have been  
beautiful (& which we will do at the next game).

But instead we screamed obscenities and retreated ungracefully,  
EXTREMELY UNGRACEFULLY and waited for a friend to walk in.

So we came over here & you're not home.

Death to the establishment & pig cops.

Sometime during karate (when I was beginning  
to get really bruised every night I guess), I  
began to get very uptight about the male struc-  
ture of the class. The whole thing was remind-  
ing me of what I've always imagined boot camp  
to be like. The structure was very stratified  
& authoritarian. The instructors were all male  
(the only female green belt quit coming after  
the first week). The students were mostly fe-  
male. A combination of being most severely hurt  
by the men in the class & being in an authori-  
tarian structure which forced me to be subser-  
vient to the male instructor made me think that  
an all-women’s class must be much better. While  
in Boston I visited one of Jayne West's women’s  
classes to try to find a difference in atmos-  
phere. I was surprised to see that the women  
were tougher in her class without men than in  
ours with men. Jayne's class was just as  
authoritarian & the women obeyed her orders  
much more quickly. They used each other as tar-  
gets for kicks & actually made contact just  
like we did (which was bruising me so much). I  
think her atmosphere was less jovial, more hard  
work together than our class was. Jayne said  
that she believed karate could be taught best  
& safest in an authoritarian way, with belt  
ranks, etc. My personal conclusions were that  
I was probably getting more upset about men  
filling the top places of the structure than I  
was about the structure itself which I still  
haven't been able to admit is necessary.

One thing really bugs me about karate—the  
mentality that seems to prevail among the male  
teachers. To wit: karate is an end in itself,  
an entire lifestyle, a total mind-rearrange-  
ment, a secret, sacred martial art. Puke! I  
don't want to turn into a goddamn cold-blooded  
vicious killer. Yet conversation with our for-  
mer karate teacher after the rip-off convinced  
me that that's his view of the people who will  
ever be any good at it—i.e., if you can't de-  
velop this mentality you might as well not bo-  
ther taking karate & if you do throw yourself  
into learning the art, you'll inevitably deve-  
lop the authoritarian, emotionless personality  
to go along with it. You need to be able to  
think of the most expedient means of achieving  
a goal and then do it, in cold blood. Group ac-  
tion is a farce; the way to get rid of corpo-  
rate power, e.g., is systematically to wipe out  
the corporate execs in their beds—ground  
glass in their tapioca, no less. Kill a person  
in a crowd with a quick invisible punch to  
his/her vulnerables, & walk away blithely, se-  
cure in your competence. Rip out your opponent's  
eyeballs, groove on his/her writhing. Never  
never let yourself get angry, because emotions  
blind you to the most effective way of wiping  
out an opponent in any given instance. This is  
the path to the Good Life??

Is the urge to become strong, self-suffi-  
cient, competent women able to defend our-  
selves from the attacks of The Enemy compatible  
with karate as institutionalized in this coun-  
try? I wonder.
