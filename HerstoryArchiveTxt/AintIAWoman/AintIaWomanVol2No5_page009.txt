good woman loved me last night.  
our bodies fit together fine.  
we went all over the water bed.  
i thought i was drowning three times  
she pulled me out with her fingers  
Toward the grove her tongue her gentle breasts  
wherein butterflies love all around; our beauty. her  
I'm putting my letter out. comfortable hips intoxicating. my thighs  
her thighs frantically seeking. me,  
And toward the hollow at last,  

of my lips : introducing myself  
I draw that your fine mushroom. without formalities.  

Friend, wild gay friend,  
at what age you have done  
your first trip?  

Close to me  
near the pillow  
beads of dew.  

And a little friend  
in the light of moon  
reading a letter.  

As shadows embrace the corners of the sky,  

We lie together.

Darkness floats like an essence into the room,  

Touching our lips, our cheeks, with soft caress.  
Poem, from a Spanish woman to Lutsha  

Our breaths mingle,  

While the night draws about us  

A cloak of soft, warm kitten fur.  
I cradle your breasts in my hands  

And your fingers trace a map of my back.  

women together  
loving  
are so beautiful!  
happy:  
intense!  
loud!  
graceful!  
funny!  
intimate  
strong  
angry  

so together  

and I'm sick snotty sweaty tired  
alone in my bed  
lonely  
listening to the giggles while I crash  
-not without fantasies and expectations-  
but raw crushed  

from the pain  
of deceptions  
changes  
revelations  
feeling more than usually confused/angry/insane  

and women together loving  
women I love together  

make me feel too much  

I'm so afraid to risk more pain.
