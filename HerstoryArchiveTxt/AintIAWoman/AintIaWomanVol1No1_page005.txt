ABORTION

How it happened, although not part  
of this story, is the story. I really  
should have known. "It can't happen  
to me" just isn't realistic. Neither  
was a relationship with a guy who felt  
his manhood threatened by birth con-  
trol. Get that - manhood - not per-  
sonhood.

Through California's underground at  
that time you could get anything. One  
of the cruelest things available was a  

doctor in Berkeley, who would give  
shots (estrogen, I think) so that if  
your period was late it'd bring it on.  
But the story went that if you went  
soon enough, you could actually abort.  
He had quite a business going. Cost  
about $40, and hurt like hell. This  
was when my period was about 2 days  
late.

After waiting a week or 10 days,  
and having one pregnancy test prove  
o.k., though inconclusive, I went back  
to the doctor. This time it was con-  
clusive.

The next day, having heard that  
physical exertion can bring on an  
abortion, I washed, swam, and ran once  
around the track. The next day I  
started looking for an abortionist.  
The Bay area at this time had several  
prestigious doctors at prestigious  
hospitals under indictment for psychi-  
atric abortions, so the search wouldn't  
be easy.

I contacted a campus minister whom  
I had gotten to know well, and he  
started phoning around. The search  
narrowed to a doctor in Tijuana, who  
everyone seemed to have heard of, in-  
cluding my family doctor, after we  
went through the bit about homes for  
unwed mothers, etc.

There apparently had been busts  
over the border, so it took several  
phone calls to really make connections.  
As an added precaution he spoke only  
Spanish. The price - $1000, plus a  
fancy hotel and transportation. It  
was finally reduced to $800, and after  
what's-his-name said he wasn't going,  
and I said I'd go alone if I had to,  
the campus minister and I made plans  
to go.

We emptied my savings account and  
borrowed some from what's-his-name's  
roommate (the total extent of all  
support, moral and financial). The  

next morning we flew: S.F.-L.A., L.  
A. - San Diego, I thought that I had  
had morning sickness pretty bad, but  
by the time we finally got off the  
plane in San Diego I was so nauseated  
I could hardly move.

We finally get up to this big big  
hotel at the top of a hill (The Coro-  
nado?) It looks expensive. This is  
our "contact point." We find out  
what the rates are and check in at  
the cheap motel across the street.  
The campus minister keeps calling  
Tijuana. Not from the motel - it  
might be bugged. When he could get  
him, because I was under 21, I couldn't  
take the bus across. We finally  
are told (late the next day) to go to  
a certain room in the hotel and ask  
for what was obviously a fictitious  
name. I had used my real name. And  
he couldn't rent a car because he had  
left his identification in his car at  
the SF airport.

We went. By this time the whole  
thing had gotten to be something like  
you read in a spy thriller. A bad  
one. So we meet two couples. One  
was engaged, the other friends. We  
called and were told to drive to a  
certain spot, and we'd be told there  
where to go next. When we got there,  
we were told to drive to the High  
Life Palace. So we drive up and down  
this road for half an hour, looking  
for this place. We were also getting  
pretty panicky. Finally we see a  
place - the Jai Alai Palace. How  
could we have known? So we pull into  
their parking lot, and wait. We make  
contact, and are to follow this car.  
It pulls away with a squeal of its  
tires, and we almost lose it. We  
finally pull up at this building, and  
are told to be very quiet. We are -  
we're petrified. We are led into  
this room, where our money is taken.

The doctor asks who wants to be  
first. She is given a robe and is  
taken into the next room. We can  
hear most of what's going on. She  
screamed, and the doctor and the  
nurse would say, “Hush, do you want  
them to come and find us and take you  
to jail?" It didn't stop her from  
screaming. After about 20 minutes  
she comes out and sits down and gags.  
I'm next. I found out why she scream-

ed. They only gave enough ether to  
keep you hovering between conscious-  
ness and unconsciousness. And it hurt.  
I had something to bite on, but it  
could only do so much. I did try not  
to scream. I tried to take more ether,  
but they wouldn't let me. The pain  
finally was undifferentiated, just in  
waves. And then it was over, and I  
too staggered out to the waiting room  
and gagged. At that point that humil-  
iation was pretty insignificant. Then  
the other woman. Right after she was  
done, we got in the car, and tore off  
for the Jai Alai Palace. Then we were  
on our own. They asked at the border  
what we'd been doing. So we gave the  
standard answer "Shopping." And where  
we were from. But we got through and  
headed for San Diego. By this time  
the pain was like period cramps. Just  
like before.

That night I recounted in detail  
the whole procedure to the campus min-  
ister (only one of the men had been  
allowed to accompany us). It took 2-3  
hours. Pretty detailed.

We finally got back to S.F. and  
then drove home. And that's when the  
unexpected part happened. My cool and  
liberal friends just really had trou-  
ble accepting me having an abortion. I  
was really brave; they couldn't have  
done it. Again and again. I began to  
feel like some kind of freak - brave,  
but still a freak. The point was that  
I really wasn’t brave, but that I had  
done what I felt I had to do. I had  
considered the alternatives - but to  
me there was no alternative.

The other response was that girls  
who got pregnant were dumb. Yeah,  
thanks a lot.

I suppose I had a mild trauma for  
a while. I sort of withdrew for a  
couple of months. My roommates thought  
I should go to the counseling service.  
I didn't, and things got to be o.k.  
after a while.

Looking back now, I just wish that  

I had really felt that I had the right —  

to do as I did. I feel now that I did.  
Women do have the right to control  
their bodies, and we'll do it ille-  
gally if we have to.

There is no reason for women not to  
talk to one another about abortions.  
We are kept apart, told that the woman  
who has one is different. Women really  

aren’t. Once we accept the right to  

our own bodies, and thus the right of  
all women to their bodies, we have  
come one step closer to affirming our  
sisterhood, and one step closer to  
radical social change.

The Medical Issues collective is planning  

to sponsor an abortion speak-out in the near  

future. We would like all women who would be  

interested in sharing  

experiences to contact us.  

their abortion  

Please phone 338-

details about the speak-out.
