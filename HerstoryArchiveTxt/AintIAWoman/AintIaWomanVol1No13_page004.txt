The powerlessness

I am consumed with guilt

for everything

we decided was good

that I couldn't be

I am consumed with guilt

for everything that

I've demanded

that could not be given

I cannot be all of what
I believe

and for this will

live the role of hypocrite

knowing I am, have been,

and always will be only
schizophrenic

Neither side of myself
has ever been a lie

Everywhere my eyes see
only decadence
I could be accused
of self-righteousness
or limited vision
but my self-righteousness
is the only pat my
shoulder receives
and my vision is limited
by your privilege

Everything you say says

you don't need real change

you just think it's academically sensible
or it fills your
sense of moral obligation

but you couldn't have

the analysis you spout

and talk so peripherally

and not want to die a little

Every time my insides feel
aloneness

I could be wrong in judging
you

or nearsighted in my vision

but your ugliness makes
your vision unbelievable
and my need makes me
feel again that I could

kill in battle those I love

and hopelessness

the powerlessness and hopelessness
I feel
when I feel this love—
the hopeless desire
to act on
that feeling
which can't be done
to act individually in
a relationship which
involves two people or
should but doesn't
isn't
isn't
doesn't exist like
the ability to act
on being productive
can't exist without
a product to produce
or tools to produce it
or if produced and I
torn
away from you

Or, just to
want to live—even
and knowing you
cannot act on that
desire
they can
those who can use
your labor and allow
you to eat if
they feel
in that mood
And if they do
they still invade
somewhere
and wanting to act so desperately
you can strike
but you don't have
to eat
and they always knew that
that you could die in the
but that you couldn't
win
unless you won
to begin with

And then you
can understand
once and for all
the dialectics
of how things happen
or should
but don't
won't
The powerlessness and hopelessness
I feel
when I feel this—
