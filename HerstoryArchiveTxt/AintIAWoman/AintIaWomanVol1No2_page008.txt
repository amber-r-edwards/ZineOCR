Saturday being beautiful

Rain rain  
I washed all the bedding; a colder weather

And even aired pillows. Hope it stays dry  
week-end so

Father played golf; painting is finished.  
That was good. However, we do the storm  
He had a headache though. We're so late

Sunday but helped me anyway. The man didn't  
Finish cleaning you -  
I still haven't gotten  
To Kay's. It will be  
A full day's job.

Doing it all alone.

I held Fritz.

She could play. It gets so lonely.

Sunday it rained.  
To stay at home  
The entire day. I try to get busy. Even as busy as I am  
So I was glad I missed hearing from you.  
The days seem long.

I know my needs are

There's the wedding.  
Changing as I never  
Felt that way a few  
Years ago.

Even though you study  
I was so sure  
There'd be mail  
From you today. The Purdue football  
Coach just came down before you.

Kay was coming home  
With hepatitis  
And changed her plans. Of course, the  
Wedding will mean  
A trip into town!  
The garage is painted.

A man is coming about  
New doors. Kay will be  
Danny Clark. He's  
Coming home this week-end.  
Father cut his hand.

He's going to make  
Corn! Yes, the day  
Caught the culprit.  
He was a squirrel.  
Mail is scarce these days.  
No one is going to  
Pick up his mother.

All is well in two  
Stopped to see.

When he is finished,  
I'll just take it down.  
I suppose he didn't pass some exam.

So he's in the office  
Doing clerical work  
Like making out checks.  
He's home because his  
Father's in the hospital.  
Danny said the storm  
Windows weren't up and  
He's run out of paint.  
He said to say hello  
to you.

Kay was home.  
Came with some  
People I didn't  
Meet. One boy  
Carried her luggage.  
I defrosted steaks  
And baked a pie  
For dinner. She  
Asked if they could  
Stay. Nothing happened.

Saturday they  
Slept all day and  
Sunday a concert  
Back to school.

So Monday I made  
Beef stew out of steak.

Where will you  
Be on your  
Birthday?
