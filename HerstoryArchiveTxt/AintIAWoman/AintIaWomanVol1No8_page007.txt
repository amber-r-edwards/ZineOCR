Who's watching me watching Gypsy.  

Jane is my conscience  

That part of my head the schools tried to tell me  

belonged to Amerikan virtue - the Christian ethic -  

do unto others - Capitalism - steal, murder, destroy -  

My body housing all that shit from 23 years  

wants to know about this woman who's lurking in my head.  

I know she exists.  

I saw her picture on the post office wall  

Conspirator, wanted by the FBI  
Jane a little younger than me  

can be considered extremely dangerous.  

She is the image of yourself.  
(Wide awake - staring blindly - she looks like she just woke up)  

She is the woman-woman within you.  

Every time I see my sister  
I am put up against the wall  

Because she is still questioning where I am afraid.  

Her fingerprints: Amerikan female *  
criminal deviant, who couldn't ignore this society  
with its hype of goodness - Amerikan justice;  
She said no to all lies of what she was  

not supposed to think, and not supposed to be.  

She is not me, but are we not one of the same?  
Woman, trying to define me is impossible  

first you would have to feel secure in your body.  
Would I like to live alone - to see myself,  
and hear myself in relation to things that  

only I remind myself of?  

Is she a center core whose vibrancy stands alone?  

Sisterhood is agonizing to me  

(The screams of hysteria)  

Why at 23 do I have to wonder what I sound like alone?  

a Woman? October 30, 1970
