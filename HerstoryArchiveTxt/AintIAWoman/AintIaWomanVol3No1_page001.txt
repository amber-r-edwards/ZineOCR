Ain't I A Woman?

The author here says women need to be helped and 
lifted over ditches, and to have the best 
place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into 

carriages or over puddles, or gives me the best 
place — and ain't I a woman?

“Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted 
and gathered into barns, and no man could head 
me — and ain't I a woman? I could work as much 
and eat as much as a man — when I could get it — 
and bear the lash as well! And ain't I a 
woman?

"I have borne thirteen children 
and seen most of 'em sold 
into slavery, and when I cried 
out with my mother's 
grief, none but Jesus 

heard me — and 
ain't I a woman?"
