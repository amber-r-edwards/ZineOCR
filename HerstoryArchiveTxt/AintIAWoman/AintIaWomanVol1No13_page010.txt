probably be full of jellied oil mixed with dust. Clean out  
this gunk with a rag, matchsticks, etc: you can use carbon

relubricate the rings with jewelers' oil --not a whole lot --

If the turntable is still slow, it may mean the motor is wearing  
out. That is a bummer. Unless you have a contact for little  
electric motors, replacing that is not worth it; you might as well  
spend it on a new stereo; you might also find a bargain by  
calling repair shops about stereos left for repairs and abandoned.  

A Conversation  

She said  

he had two children  

"Out there somewhere", and  
They were stupid  

Those two women  

to have let it happen.  

But her mouth quivered  
when she remembered  

she was married to  

the fucker.  

I watched  

from the fortunate place  

you have given me.  

An outsider--  

As when I pressed my nose  

against the panes of my childhood,  
Wishing I wanted  

what you have and now relinquish.  
My womanhood denied:  

II Minus-woman.  
You did not take it well. Lesbian.  
Head bowed.  

Searching  

the years between your legs  
for the afterbirth of  
two children decided against.  

IV : -  
So. You mistake my independence for privilege  

forgetting the years I've struggled  
to even like myself  
for the woman I am.  

And it's not that I mind  

being seen by you as different.  
Only concerned,  

My married friend,  

My lover,  

that you realize  

Our distance is yours to diminish.
