consciousness-raising groups where

not having to put up with
a whole way of life we don't want

just to have our sexual/emotional
(social/financial) needs satisfied

try to picture

women helping women

as we have always done

but believing the help is important
women talking with women

believing what we say matters

women friends with women

keeping that friendship

women committed to women

committed to ourselves

The isolated lesbians in the groups
stood up one by one and TOLD

women they were not sure they could trust
women who would always remain strangers
until they heard the words

I am a lesbian

The heterosexual women answered

why are you telling us this

we are here to discuss

our common experience

not your personal problems

why are you dividing us

by bringing up issues

that aren't relevant

to every one of our lives

of course we accept you

there's nothing more to say

you ask us to question our attitudes
what attitudes

The lesbians said

you were the ones who mentioned it

we thought you wanted to hear about it
The other women said

if we start loving women

we'll have to start worrying about

what women expect from us.

and there won't be any more

neutral arms to weep in

neutral mouths to kiss

neutral hands to hold

neutral smiles to exchange

everything between women will be electric
no place to rest

and we'll end up

playing butch and femme roles

the old society repeated among women
you don't offer

an escape from our lives worth discussing
and if you did

it would only be an individual solution
a secret love

if we came out in this society

we would have to live your lives
whatever they've been

suffer your pain

whatever that is

become you

whoever you are

we know by the way we back away

this isn't what we want

when we call for a revolution

in every bedroom

when we half-jokingly define this as
the highest form of revolution

we're talking about

holding onto the sex and lifestyle
society taught us to want

and using that

in our revolutionary way

to make society make it worthwhile

for us to go on putting up with it

So the isolated lesbian in each group
sat down

some of the other women stopped speaking to her
some looked at her with strange desire
and eventually she went away

she'd gathered a lot of dust

waiting for her sisters to deal with her
it was in the air when she left

and the other women were coughing

and brushing it off their skins and clothes
when some of them found themselves saying
now that we've mentioned it

I realize I've been thinking about it
all my life without knowing it

of course I couldn't speak it

so it couldn't become real

words can lift your hand

bring it down against another woman's hand
not by accident and not in passing

but forever

in a way that must change our lives

in a way we can't talk away

by saying it's over before it's started

heterosexual women discuss lesbianism as
an abstraction

don't it interesting

that women might have complete lives

with other women

just imagine

any women
can put their lives together

and become lesbians

any women

can put their bodies together

and become lesbians

I love so many women

I wonder if one of them

would admit to loving me

the other women said

don't talk to us about love

we have to be strong and change society
in ways that will work

don't sap our energies with kisses

love will only turn us into objects again
If love could have regenerated us

it would have done so by now

sometimes we think

love isn't as central to life as people say
that idea is

probably just another trap for women

So the women whose gay feelings were revealed
through talking with many women

had to go away and find the few women

who would see it through

they had to go looking for lesbians

They had shed tears struggling to speak
and the women who stayed behind

were busily flicking away the water

from their skin and clothes

when by accident

two of them touched hands

and found themselves saying

maybe it wouldn't harm our humanity

to experiment with it once

as a sexual act

we won't commit ourselves at the start
we'll keep ourselves out of it

then if it works physically

we'll see where it leads

through chance and whatever our moods are
how threatened we feel

we'll hit a balance somewhere

if it hurts

we'll fight each other then see what's left
life is

that kind of clawing and stumbling around
and when you can't stand yourself

there's always the world

like a great mental hospital

to fall back into

and have other people tell you what to do
so they went home together

and were disappointed

they couldn't hate themselves enough

to completely run away from it

they couldn't believe in each other
enough to embrace it

they kept saying

there are problems complications

well I don't know

they kept hanging around themselves

like some people hang around others
waiting for an answer reassurance

finally they said

it's not for me

but I think I'll go find some lesbians

just to look at

restful to watch them live

that part of my life for me

These ambiguous women

had raged and torn at themselves

trying to keep silent

trying to forget

their anguish charged the air

forming pools around the women who remained
until one of them said

I want to know

who mentioned lesbianism in the first place
it's a divisive topic

that separates women

and keeps them from working on other issues
where did all these lesbians come from
none of us are lesbians

but out there at the edges of our reality
I hear women are changing

they say they are changing into themselves

Lesbians looking for other lesbians
at DOB at the women's center

at demonstrations

on the streets

at school at work

looking for a face that is

serious in the same way

knowing we look like everyone else
ourselves in our heads

am I gay today

or am I a woman picture

in the world of lies

even I hardly know what I am admitting
how much trouble it will get me into
a minute from now

I want you to be my friend

come to dinner

we will feed each other

stories of our lives

in the middle of laughing

we become silent

our minds seek the shape of

the room we are in

the streets I can't walk

seem to be moving under me I'm back
shouting sisterhood at demonstrations
then going home alone

or with one other woman

I'm back embracing women I loved

our isolation no longer romantic

our closeness opening me

so I can no longer bear the difference
between my apartment and the streets
two women together couldn't make up for
what society took away

I wonder how many women it takes

to begin giving everything back

Gay women used to talk a lot about
their jobs vacations interests

they would avoid talking about

how it felt to be gay

because the way to deal with it was

to avoid it live around it live away from it
distance ourselves from ourselves

when we could not talk about it in public
we rarely talked about it in secret

there was no place for our anger to go

I used to think then that it was enough

to get across a feeling of general goodwill
because there was no hope of

saying anything honest

if I talked about our non-existence

gay women looked at me with disgust

what was I going to risk

was I going to change the world

the gay movement drew together

women who had felt alone with their anger
some of them were those same women

who had talked most convincingly

in bars and at parties

about nothing but their jobs and vacations
some of them had been the first lesbians
in women's liberation

consciousness-raising groups

now they could go back if they wanted to
and talk with the women who had tried

to drive them away

When the gay women's movement started
I didn't understand

why so many women grabbed five friends
out of meetings and dances

went everywhere did everything with them
sat in a tight corner with them

at the next meetings and dances
finally went home stayed home together
were never seen again

I thought the gay women's movement was
going to be like a family or an army
struggling along together

I thought women who worked together
would become naturally close

but I learned women who were close first
had to find ways

to work together later

women arrived and disappeared

I had to figure out fast

who I wanted as friends

and who would have to remain strangers
sometimes I couldn't do it fast enough
I had to hope the women would come back
or some of their other friends

would take a vacation

so many times I tried to talk couldn't
or women walked away

in the middle of sentences

or they gave me a hostile look

and I began repeating formulas

smiling to pacify them

or I must have frightened other women
and they also began

passing off their lives as jokes

so hard coming out of that world

that told us there were no connections
between us

Women loving women
a circle dance

where we give strength back to ourselves

yes yes yes yes

we affirm ourselves shouting stamping

arms waving feet sliding on the floor

this room is our world for now

we take hands with women we don't know

women we may never begin to speak with

women who are our past lovers in disguise

or our mothers sisters grandmothers

neighbors friends

the children we were

when we first thought of loving women

and our other selves

the many women who might have been

women who were gay all our lives

women who came out in tears and fury

these last two years

women who came out and went back in

women watching us test their freedom for them
and women
just beginning to exist this year
who came out because it was possible
because other women gave them

the words for their thoughts

words to describe what would happen
and when it happened

words to admit it

because there were women around them
friends close enough to touch

to dance and talk with

a circle of our faces to look into
sisters take my hands

not only for this dance

let the energy we build here

be life to us as we walk their streets
all space is free space

and I want to be gay everywhere
