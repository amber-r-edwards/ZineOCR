What in hell am I supposed to do with  
such a feeling?  

I can't call it love  

because of what society has done to our  
relationships with each other  

in the name of it.  

I can't listen to records  

and revel in the feeling  

the way I used to,  

because of the silver linings  
and only you's  

that I see now.  

And if that isn't enough  

I worry about it not being  

collective.  

This feeling I have and  

the collective I live in  

are both meaningful to me,  

but what is the place of each in each?  

That's not even considering sex.  

For that one add about  

ten tons of guilt  

acquired over the years.  

If my puritan soul isn't chastising  
myself for being too consumed with  
matters of the flesh  

you can go around touching  

anyone you please, but the minute  
you think you care for someone,  
touching them gets escalated into a  
matter of the flesh.  

Then I'm worried about a physical gesture  
of affection being taken  
as some carnal advance.  

(Two comments I've heard today remind  
me that people think the only thing  
gay people care about is MEAT.)  

With these thoughts  
this country is continuing its  
extermination of the Third World,  

like Amerika does  
luxury a problem?  

The Third World  
or my feelings.  

Besides  
it's unproductive  

A Woman?  

And when I realize that while I'm occupied  

I feel ashamed,  

my problem does not inflict pain on me  
to my far away sisters.  

So who am I to call such  

yet neither of them will go away:  
to be thinking about  
this person all the time  
when my mind should be on the struggle,

Lae,  

There's no basis anymore  

for anything  

Women's liberation has questioned  
it all,  

But when will come the answers?  

And then comes the latest  

It Ain't Me Babe  

which reflects the controversy  
in the movement so well  

that the paper almost falls apart  
in my hands.  

The Word (temporary I'm sure) from the  
Berkeley Gay Women's Liberation  

is that you should merely  

walk up to the person and say:  

"I care for you and feel physically  
attracted to you"  

Well fine.  

but it's so hard.  

It's a good idea though  
we both thought so  
as we made a joke of it  
(for protection):  
We could all carry around copies of the  
It Ain't Me Babe  
and when the time was right  
point to the article and say:  
"paragraph three"  

And that would mean about the feeling;  

But neither of us did.
