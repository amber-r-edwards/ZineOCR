Ten out of thirteen pregnancies

caught my mother's womb

at 18 tender years,

And gave her no rest until they took it away
at 39 tired ones, so she could keep working.
I lost,

Nine lives that she survives

in debt, deeper every year,

and in poor health—

make no mistake about that POOR health.

She gave up what could have been an easier life,
the single life,
for a place in Heaven, and one fucker.
That lost single-ness
and the color of her skin
could have cushioned her after a hard childhood.
But she gave up the first,
in fact, saw no choice...
And in her world the second was the Rule,
she could eat, marry, and live in her town,
and be oblivious to the oppression of others.
She's never realized a lot of her own.

She suffered and fought and cried.
She sacrificed and rationalized and fell.
And she prayed.

AND SHE'S STILL PRAYING—

to earn salvation and mercy for her kids and husband,
whom she's condemned countless times.

Her older daughters don't believe, really—

and her young children could defect anytime.

I keep hoping, and God knows, I'VE TRIED.

I was her first,

and so I'm told, the most trouble.
He always told me I was the worst,
and I hate him,

though my anger has dissipated these past two years.

My conviction is nearly emotionless,

and really exists as a ghost.

My bones and bruises are healed.

and I live in another town, besides.

I also won the last fight I had with him.

But my sister, fourth in line, is catching the shit, now.

And I can't really ease her pain,
just warn her and hope she fights back sometimes,
to ward off hopelessness.

I never understood class by any name,

But I can see where my consciousness came from.
I resisted staying in the Working Class

until they ripped off my last buck,

and now I'm in debt, too,

without even a year's credit,

and certainly without grace.

My sisters haven't been led on,

and will not make my mistake.

I am a feminist and a lesbian,
so my mother and I talk about class now.

I know she'd never let you malign her work and pride,

she defends honest, hard work ethics,

and she sometimes makes bitter comments
about the ruling and middle classes—

without mentioning their names.

But she also berates me because she thinks
I'm a dreamer,

with no respect for anything or anybody.

Once I wanted to change my last name

to her first name.

It only embarrassed her.

She didn't understand, 
Maybe I just wanted to get back at the old man.
She matters to me and my name hasn't changed.

I tell her I want to be a carpenter,
or a printer or a mechanic—
and all she can say is:
"You’re not built for that kind of work.
You think you’re a professional athlete?
You just want a man's job, that's sick.
When you've got some talent and creativity
you've got no business digging ditches."
and when I say:
"That's bullshit,
Grandpa works at Goodyear. If he can,
so can I—
I want to."

She says:
"And Grandpa is old before his time.
He's sixty-two and it's like he's eighty. 
They won't let him work outside anymore.
He's at a desk...shuffling papers,
and he's miserable, he feels useless.
And he's sick,
He can't even have a beer these days."
What can I say to that painful news?
Grandpa's plight catches my throat,
not out of fear for myself, but him,
and my mother, who's headed that way.
I only mouth a defense of our class,
and she doesn't give a shit what I say.
I realize that she'll defend her life,
and fight to change mine.
And she stubbornly plugs on:
"Get a job where you go to work from 9 to 5,

pay your debts, and get some security for the future,

don't kid yourself, things are getting rougher.
Like be a clerk in a store,
check-out girls at Eagle's make $3.00 an hour."
So I tell her that carpenter's apprentices start higher,
and that men have all the job security,
even though all men don't.
And on and on and on...

My mother wants me to make it,
and still keep the ethics.

But I will stay working-class,
and I won't have to try.

Listen to me, mom.

I love you,

but I love myself and our people, too—
and I don't mean the Mother Church,

or racist, sexist, club-wielding men.

I do, too.
You want your kids to eat well,
wear adequate clothing
and be clean.
So do I.

When I was younger
I thought she'd die if she ever found out about
my life and my politics.

Well, she's found out enough to tumble the cathedral,

and she just keeps saying those goddam prayers.
If I had a nickel for every rosary...

I could pay my debts,

and hers, too.

She says my brains are in my ass,

and I can't get past her logic, at times.
It's hard to get things going,

like the revolution.

It's hard enough to survive

without going crazy for good

beats me how women without friends make it
in this world

beats me where the money comes from

unless it's from the top.

And it beats me more that that is

where the money comes from.

we're so bought off,

we're going to turn on each other for blood—
when we should be kicking our asses 
to get a move on,

and start kicking where it counts.
Personally I find matches in the kitchen,
close to the knives.
