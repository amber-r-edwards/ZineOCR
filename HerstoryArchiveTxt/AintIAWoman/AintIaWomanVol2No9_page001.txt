I most of us have had an extremely negative reaction to hierarchy, ascribing to it lack of discipline, not having to work with or be considerate of other people, being collective, doing your own thing. These reactions are becoming understandable to us recently but have proved to be wrong. Lots of anarchists had these attitudes (most were aristocrats), lots didn't have them at all.

It is becoming apparent to us that anarchy is a form. Its content may be good or not so good. But we believe that form can determine to a great extent content, and a form consisting of voluntary activity between collectives offers the best social relations, freshest ideas and activities, and the best chance of avoiding hierarchies (structured or informal) and reaching equality. It's still difficult for us to think of anarchy in terms of what a society will be like after a revolution but by thinking about forms in terms of our own lives—our present, we are freed from the mindset of having to have a blueprint for years from now and can also learn and progress from the material condition we exist within right now.
