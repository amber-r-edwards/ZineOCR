62.3. 40

I once wrote an article for AIAW about
gayness from the perspective of a straight
woman. It is a defensive and nervous
piece of writing. At the time, I was
scared to death that gay women were "after
my body" but could never work through this
feeling because I was too embarrassed to
ask anybody about it. I think I was afraid
of two things: I would be rejected
by gay women; I would be accepted by gay
women.

I knew that as a straight woman I had
begun to identify with women almost totally.
My priorities lay with women and I knew in
my gut that I could sleep with them; that
our hugs and other physically supportive
gestures were SEX.

The trouble was that I kept validating
my experiences with women with heterosexual
norms. I put meaning onto physical
contact as if the women were men—as if
what was going on in their heads were the
same things that happen in men's heads.
(It can happen that gay women "think" like
men but only because gay women, too, may
be affected by the pigshit that our society
calls "sex mores.")

The whole trip started with Martha when
she told me that she “loved a woman." Not
having very many preconceived ideas about
loving a woman except your basic lesbian
stereotype I, of course, zeroed in on the
physical aspect of that relationship. I
didn't freak out. I intellectualized the
whole idea behind identifying with women.
When I finally did panic I did it quietly
and didn't tell anyone.

When I began attending gay parties,
with the support of Martha, my presence

I loved my first grade teacher.
She was a nun with a sexy smile
and she touched me.

But I couldn't tell her

how I loved her

with my body -

not even with my mouth.

I had to tell her lies

like: “I like you Sister Mary Robert Marie."

I loved Jacque.

She had a black woman's arrogant eyes
and my heart.

I told her in the dark

and she agreed.

We loved with our hands tied.

I broke.

People gotta know that

I love women,

if they don't know that they don't
know me and,

I need to be known.

So I'm loving my sisters

with the lights on

with my hands

free.

I can't be a lie anymore.

I IDENTIFY...

signaled that I was gay—intellectually,

at least. That's what my line was; the line

between intellectually and actually was

drawn because I had not actually related
physically to a woman in bed. But there's
more to it than that.

At these parties I heard women talking
about each other: "So and so has such a
full body" or "So and so has such beautiful
breasts." Other times, the comments
were made woman to woman, kidding each
other about their bodies and physical re-
lationships. Gay women made me nervous.

I put the blame on them instead of myself.
After all, wasn't I beginning to draw my-
self in, limiting myself?

Then I went through a period of wanting
to “hurry up and be gay." I wanted a
woman to proposition me. Surely it should
have been obvious to me that I was viewing
the gay community from a heterosexual
background. I expected gay women to treat
me the way men had. When I heard "So and
so has beautiful breasts" I flashed on a
male saying "Look at those big jugs."
This means 1) they're mine to speak of,

2) big jugs being the valued product.

In the context of the women I identify
with, comments made to and about other
women's bodies are not offensive because
theirs is not a male orientation. "So and
so has beautiful breasts" means 1) I iden-
tify with you as a woman and I love your
body as I love mine, 2) all women have
beautiful breasts.

Neither of the latter are realizations
easily arrived at because of the nature
of heterosexuality. Before loving women
I did not like my own body. It somehow did

not belong to me to like.

I didn't make
any real decisions about it other than how
to make up my face so that a man could love

it, etc. My sexuality was determined by
the men I related to and my body belonged
to them. That's what their comments told
me.

With women I saw where their comments
came from—out of respect for women as a
whole. Too, I saw women's bodies in a new
way: not as competition or as objects but
as extensions of individuals. I began to
see my own body as individual and because
women didn't make any assumptions about
whether I should or should not relate to
them physically, I decided I was in
control. My body was allowed to move free-
ly and breathe.

Finally I have come to see being gay
as a way of not limiting myself as opposed
to the stereotype that so many straight
women have of lesbians. Finally I am not
being valued or de-valued on the basis of
my physical appearance. In fact I have
no problem dealing with my gayness
anymore in terms of the gay community. Now
I have new fears to work through: trying
to exist in a society knowing that I did
not make a choice to be gay, that there is
no choice when your priorities lie with
women; that the world is a limited place
when the straight women in it allow little
room for gay women to be open with them
because of their refusal to deal with
their own homosexuality. It is ironic that
I have ended up with the problem that
I laid on gay women in the first place.

I ask you a lot of questions
and you answer them, and
it's no big deal.

We never talk about
our relationship
you know—yeah, I know
and it's no big deal.

Saying goodnight to you
is no big deal;

Probably I trust you
more than anyone else
it figures.

But we never talk about
having a relationship
and it's not that kind of heavy
to be alone with you.

Like I'm aware now
of not to use anyone else's
line on you.

But I don't know how to tell you,

how to end a
not-a-love poem.

Ain't I?
