That I am that symbol of woman having been struck in the face

for daring to be female.

I was really asking for it, all those years, like my father told me  
I was enticing those men, just like he taught me how to.  
But just when he was ready to dismiss me I said no  
and he hit me in the face for that.  
Shit, I didn't know I as a woman threatened him.  
like I didn't see myself as that woman  

who could ever have that type of power.  
but like he hit me just in case I should ever be thinking that  

I had that power to threaten him.

The Modern Woman at 4  

We gave her a couture of  
fancy dinners, chewing gum,  
information and  

outrageous models.  

What more could she want?  

with a few filling in of spaces,  
she can count to ten.  

Why trust a man?  
Berdid  
and I sure don't now,  
Why trust a woman?  
I do  
I just do
