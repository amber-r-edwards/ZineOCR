PAPER WOMAN

(for Angela Davis)

Paper woman  
face bigger than life  
collar frayed  
lips open to give the bad news  

pulp into person  

have coffee with me and  

fill the room with cigarette smoke.  
Take off your wire rims and  

let me kiss away your failing vision.  

Paper woman  
we need more than these  
fragments of your myth.  
Come back to us screaming  
so no ear can ever again be stopped against you.  
Come back with your vision and health restored.  
Come back nicotine free.  
Come back the size of life  
lips open to give the better-than-life news,  

“Home free all."

OUR PRINTING POLICY  

The AIAW collective makes all de-  
cisions on what we print. We try to  
print articles that we agree with, and  
as a whole, have the paper represent  
the politics of the collective. We do,  
however, decide at times to print ma-  
terial submitted to us that we may  
have some disagreements with, but that  
we basically think are helpful and  
worth reading. We do not edit any art-  
icles, but sometimes we don't feel  
right about printing certain articles  
without commenting or responding to  
them in the paper to make our own views  
clear. If we wish to do that we will  
communicate privately with whoever sub-  
mitted it to be sure it's all right.  
To designate what articles come from  
outside, we have started signing AIAW  
on collective articles and articles by  
individuals from the collective.  

People keep writing us nice let-  
ters and we want to print them. It  
would save us a lot of time if you  
would indicate whether or not you want  
us to print it. We never use anyone's  
name unless we know she wants us to.
