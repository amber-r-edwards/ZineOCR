WOMEN'S ABORTION PROJECT -- NEW YORK CITY

"We refer women to office-clinic abor-
tions for $100 plus $10 for the Abortion
Project. Prospects in the future for get-
ting the price lower, although we're in
the midst of getting worked over by the
NY state laws again.

"Anyway, we're the only abortion pro-
ject that is controlled by women. The
abortionists are men but they're very
strictly supervised by us. The doctors
must give 10% free abortions, so we
absorb some women who can't pay $110. The
doctors also must employ women from the
abortion project as paramedical aides.

The paramedical aides' job is to talk to women
about the abortion, their bodies, WL, the
abortion laws, etc., while they wait for
the abortion, and to sit with them and
reassure them while they get the abortion.

"We've also been able to influence
other clinics in town (non-WL) to hire
abortion aides to be nice to women.

"We also can refer women for salines,
but that is much tighter in N.Y. right
now."

The man

over there says that women

need to be helped into carriages
and lifted over ditches, and to have
the best place everywhere.
Nobody ever helps me into
carriages or over puddles
or gives me

the best place...

Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted and
gathered into barns, and no man could head me
have lots of neat stuff. 
and ain't I a woman?
I could work as much and eat as much as a man
when I could get it—and bear the lash as well
..and ain't I a woman?
If anyone has any thoughts on the relation-
ship between gayness and class, please send
them to us, ATAW. with my mother’s grief, none but Jesus heard me
