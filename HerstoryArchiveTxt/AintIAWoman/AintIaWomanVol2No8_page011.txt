Our priming policy..--

The AIAW collective makes all decisions on what
we print. We try to print articles that we agree
with, and as a whole, have the paper represent the
politics of the collective. We do, however, decide
at times to print material submitted to us that we
may have some disagreements with, but that we ba-
sically think are helpful and worth reading. We do
not edit any articles, but sometimes we don't feel
right about printing certain articles without com-
menting or responding to them in the paper to make
our own views clear. If we wish to do that we will
communicate privately with whoever submitted the
article to be sure it's all right. To designate
what articles come from AIAW and what articles come
from outside, we have started signing AIAW on col-
lective articles and articles by individuals from
the collective.

People keep writing us nice letters and we want
to print them. It would save us a lot of time if
you would indicate whether or not you want us to
print it. We never use anyone's name unless we know
she wants us to.

"The Alternative Readers Service wishes to announce that the first issue of
the Froggie Hollow Gazette, a six hour tape is now available for free, to the
blind, visually handicapped and functionally illiterate.

The first issue contains readings from the Liberation News Service, The
Whole Earth Catalogue, The Mother Earth News, The Rolling Stone, and several o-
ther radical or underground sources.

Our purpose is two-fold. We are available to read anything the blind or il-
literate are hassled with getting through conventional channels. We also hope to
become a focus for an embryonic handicapped person's liberation movement.

We need lots of publicity. The group of people we hope to reach is not pre-
sently part of any organization so we must depend on readers of the underground
press to turn their blind friends on to our service. We would appreciate a small
continuing spot in your paper.
We would be ecstatic with a free subscription and
