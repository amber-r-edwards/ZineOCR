In our last issue we printed a love poem
by Judy Grahn and we meant to attach an
explanation for those who have seen the
poem. Here's how we printed it:

At the place where her breasts
come together

two thumbs width a channel,

I ride my hands to anchor
my eyes to angle.

At the place where her thighs

come together,

I said, "You smell like the ocean,"
and lay down my tongue

by the dark tooth edge of sleeping.
"Swim," she said.

And I did.

I did.

You see we have never seen it and don't
have a copy of any pamphlet it appears in.
It was recited to two of us in Bloomington,
Indiana as we were travelling back to Iowa
City by a woman from Berkeley who knew it
by heart. We thought it was so beautiful--
we had never heard a love poem to a woman.
I made her say it over and over. Eventually
I knew it by heart too and when we got
back to Iowa City, I recited it to the
sisters.

It's been an important part of our cul-
ture -- our sister love so beautifully ex-
pressed. Like so much of our culture, it
is passed on and learned by word of mouth;
not written, delicate, carefully told. We
realized this when we wanted to print it--
we had never seen a copy of it so had to
guess transcribing the lines.
