Every time a slick letterhead request  
for a plug comes in from some non-profit  
organization (as if declaring yourself  
non-profit is to wave a white flag)  
I want to puke my guts out. I want to  
puke because you don't yet see that non-  
profit and corporation is a contradiction  

in terms, because you don't see  
making films and tapes about people's  
misery and then peddling them for a  
price is unforgivable, because you don't  
see the insult in referring to us as  

Women's Lib as if liberation is just  

another catchphrase to be abbreviated  

and mangled by your alternative to  
the commercial media, because you define  

the liberation of women as a social  
problem.  

Racism is a social problem, Women's  
Liberation is no social problem.  
You don't see your request for tapes  
as insulting as it is. You don't care  
that if women can make tapes, they can  
also distribute them and probably for  
free or for cost to their sisters. You  
would have us think we need a non-profit  
corporation with letterhead and  
an office and a hierarchical staff with  
a man-president to distribute tapes.  
Or that some kind of media is needed  
to "stress that action is not only  
possible but crucial." There is a lot  
of work to be done and it would get  
done a lot quicker if people would act  
instead of making films about acting,  
if people would devote the energy it  

takes to bring about a revolution in-  
stead of forming non-profit corporations  

which rent films for prices that only  
middle-class intellectuals would rent  
for a weekend one-night view of misery.  

You even felt compelled to identify  
every one of your sponsors by his:  
Authors, Psychiatrist,  
I want to puke

Executive Secretary.  
I want to puke because you don't see how disgusting it  
is to flaunt those names with all their  
ritzy middle-class privileged jobs,  
because you don’t see your division of  
labor as repulsive because it is uncol-  
lective, because you don't see it as sex-  
ist because you employ Sally Pugh as a  
secretary and Jerry Stoll as a president.  

This begins the policy statement in the ADF catalog. Brecht  
was an artist not a revolutionary. What can his statement  
mean to us? Art says something and looks nice but it does  
not kill, destroy, build, neutralize power. Beware of the  
desire to have art perform the difficult tasks of protest!  
I want to puke because you are peddling  
our misery without even beginning to  
understand it.

people, than being president of Jerry's  
Office Supplies. Much higher on the left-  
liberal status ladder, huh, Jerry?  

After all, we have to live and a salary  
is a salary to those who are used to  

earning one.  

Well, you got your blurb - now choose  
your sides -- you can't be part of the  
solution (revolution) when you are part  
of the problem sitting behind a corporate  

desk selling out the people.  

Next time take out an ad.
