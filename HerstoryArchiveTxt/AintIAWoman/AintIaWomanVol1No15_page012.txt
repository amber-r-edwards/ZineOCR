SELF DEFENSE 4

It is important for you to know.  
Belinda, good defense is the  
instinct to move and the elbow  
will  

You must practice  

these techniques so you  
can respond with them,  
quickly in times of crisis.  

Lift your hands be  
your feet and look  
at your ankle for balance.  
(It is good to wear shoes  

down on this surface, especially  
if you feel down along the  

leg. Towels should be placed  
walking about.)  

Follow up with a follow-up jab  
to the stomach and brace your  
body so that if you are  
hit, it will connect  
with the big stomach. The  

movement is short and quick.  
First bring your elbow out  
and then smash it back. Once  
the hold is broken, run.
