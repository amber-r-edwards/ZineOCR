As far as the abortion contacts: we  
recommend Manhattan Medical for an early  
abortion in New York. We have nothing to  
recommend for 12-14 week pregnancies. For  
the last year we had been using Los Angeles  
and Chicago underground for d&c's, but we  
have had too many infections come back and  
thus discontinued them last week. So we  
have nothing to offer between 12-16 weeks  
as of today. Between 16-20 a woman can  
always get a saline but they always cost  
a fortune because they involve a hospital  
stay. Dr. Sinnreicht is as good and as  
cheap as any.

Are you on the Pill?  

There are many different brands of the birth control pill. You should use a brand containing  
the least possible amount of estrogen.  

Estrogen and progesterone are the two female hormones that make up all birth control pills.  

Medical studies have shown estrogen to cause most side effects to the Pill. Such side effects  
are usually harmless and temporary; however, a small number of women taking the Pill do  
experience dangerous complications.  

Not more than .05 milligrams of estrogen in each tablet is necessary to ensure 100% contra-  

ceptive protection. The following brands of the birth control pill contain not more than .05  
milligrams of estrogen in each tablet:  

eDemulen |  
e Demulen .5  

e Norlestrin |  
e Norlestrin 2.5  
(all registered  
eNorinyl 1 trademarks)  

eOrtho-Novum 1 /50  

eOvral  

To ensure your own health while on the Pill:  
1. Have a gynecological examination at least once a year.  

2. Use a brand of the Pill that contains not more than .05 milligrams of estrogen in each  
tablet.

Self-Defense For Hitchhiking  

When you are hitchhiking, be prepared. Don't get into a car with more than one male. Look them  
over. Carry your comb or your keys ready in your hand. A key jabbed in his eye or a comb scraped  
across the ear, throat or eye is a good defense.  

If he grabs your leg or groin, don't bother to push away his hands. Either grab his little  
finger and yank it back to break it or jab him in the eyes: Using your first two fingers as prongs.  
Bend your middle finger so there will be equal contact and with a quick snake-like motion of your  
forearm jab him in the eyes.  

When you get into the car, light up a cigarette. It is a useful weapon. If you get into trouble, put  
your cigarette out in your attacker's face.
