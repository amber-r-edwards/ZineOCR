“The man over there says women need to be helped into  
carriages and lifted over ditches, and to have the best  
place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into  
carriages or over puddles, or gives me the best  
place — and ain't I a woman?  

“Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted  
and gathered into barns and no man could head  
me — and ain't I a woman? I could work as much  
and eat as much as a man — when I could get in  
and bear the lash as well! and ain't I a woman?  

“I have borne thirteen children  
and seen most of 'em sold  
into slavery and when I cried  
out with my mother's  
grief none but Jesus  
heard me — and  
ain't I a woman?
