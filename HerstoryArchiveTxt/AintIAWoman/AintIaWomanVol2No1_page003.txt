A POEM HELD TOGETHER BY SHEER EXHAUSTION

I

It begins about friends:  
dreams of faces around the bed  
every night; arms  
stretched out  

rocking me through myself.  
They whisper "sleep."  

They are feathers  

slightly flying around  

my silence. They are  
everywhere.  

II  

Lonely women  

sit on doorsteps.  
They carry their houses  
inside  

where no one comes  
to knock.  

I used to pretend  
I wasn't home.  

I never  

had anything  

to say.  

III  

I imagine you two  

well-formed and full.  

I have memorized the distance  
between your bodies when filled  
with anticipation  

of love.  

I swell and swim  

with your love shared  

without me.  

I live within  

your reach.  

IV  

I don't want to leave  
a word.  

I want to sit  

and hold me  

in my arms.  

"Sleep."  

The Meaning of Revolution  

Things that work should be broken.  
Their ability to work is evidence and cause of the  
murderous abstraction—the social system.  

Things that don't work should be fixed.  
Cars, bodies, selves.  
That is the love part.  

To repair  

Men's despair,  

Makes the soul whole,  

Ready for destruction again.  
Fuck you.
