“That man over there says he needs to be lifted over ditches, and I should have the best place everywhere. Now, if you could get me into carriages, or over puddles, or give me a best place...

I have borne and seen them thirteen children. And all sold off into slavery. I have been wanting to write a long letter, but I don't feel like going into the whole thing. My parents are having tons of hassles. I wish I could suggest a reasonable alternative to my mom. I think she’d split if she had no money and wasn’t so afraid of being lonely. I've been hardly talking to my dad—had one horrible discussion before the Woman's Rights Convention at Akron, Ohio in 1851. I don’t know about me and how much they’ll never know.

I think before this visit I still had some illusions about getting along with their understanding of me. I've been doing some private consciousness raising about Jewish family life. It's a pretty fucked-up way to grow up. You respect intelligence (usually the father 'cause the father talks the best). You get education up to your ears, which your mother never had 'cause females didn't do that. So somehow she doesn't get quite as much respect as your father.

I won’t go into the whole thing, but the scheme to have Jewish girls love their fathers is a burn (obviously perpetrated by Jewish fathers). My mom's getting pretty fucked over. Beginning as I was (much of my life) feeling sorry for my poor mother, I realize no more.

Weird. People say Bernadette Devlin is pregnant? What am I going to do? I miss you all... Love sucks because major trauma becomes the age of 13, 13.

Kids are major love. My class is super. 

I may need your counsel.
