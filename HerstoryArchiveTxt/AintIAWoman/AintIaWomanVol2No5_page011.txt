The man

over there says that women

need to be helped into carriages
and lifted over ditches, and to have
the best place everywhere.

Nobody ever helps me into carriages or over puddles or
gives me the best place... 

and ain't I a woman?

Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted and

gathered into barns, and no man could head me

...and ain't I a woman?

I could work as much and eat as much as a man

when I could get it—and bear the lash as well

...and ain't I a woman?

I have borne thirteen children, and seen most of 'em

sold into slavery, and when I cried out

with my mother’s grief, none but Jesus heard me.
