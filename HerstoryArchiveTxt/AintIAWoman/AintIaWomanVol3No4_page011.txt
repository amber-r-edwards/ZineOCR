RAPE is an act of aggression in which the victim is denied her  
self-determination. It is an act  
of violence which always carries  
with it the threat of death. And  
finally, rape, is a form of  
mass terrorism, for the victims of rape are chosen indiscriminately,  
but our male-dominated culture tells us that it is women who cause  
rape by being immoral or in the wrong place at the wrong time--  
in essence, by behaving as though we were free.  

(VIETNAM: A FEMINIST ANALYSIS (A  
.T.A.W. - August 18, 1972)  

A 24-hour Rape Crisis Line is being started in Iowa City. We are  
in need of volunteers to help staff the line. Women involved in  
the Rape Crisis Line will give information to women about police  
and hospital procedures, provide transportation, and accompany  
the woman to those places if she wishes. Any woman who is harassed  
by a man in Iowa City can also phone for assistance. This is an  
independent woman's support group and all information and names  
will be kept confidential. Weekly  
meetings are held at the Women's Center,  
3 E. Market, every Wednesday night at 7:30 p.m. Any woman  
interested in volunteering may come to the meetings. For more  
information call 353-6265.

El otro día me daba cuento de que soy latina.  
Mi papá es cubano y mi madre es americana y  
ellos me daban un nombre anglo. He cambiado  
mi nombre a Rosa y estoy tratando de descubrir  
mi lengua y mis orígenes. Quiero comunicar  
con unas mujeres homosexuales o feministas  
latinas o chicanas. Cualquier mujer que quiere  
escribirme en español lo puede hacer. Estoy sola  
en mi lucha. Escríbame, Rosa, a No Soy Una
