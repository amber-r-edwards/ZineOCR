As I begin the process of  
establishing residence in  
Minneapolis, I am struck by  
the potential power of my eco-  
nomic decisions. I must find  
a dentist, a bank, a reliable  
auto mechanic, a veterinarian,  
etc. And women with estab-  
lished families have far more  
diverse needs than I have,  
and thus far more power. I  
believe we are now largely  
wasting this power.

Supporting Women

Personally, I would put  
up with some inconvenience to  
patronize a woman dentist,  
mechanic. I would boycott  
any local business which I  
knew practiced sexism, and I  
would walk to St. Paul, if  
necessary, to avoid placing  
my money with a financial  
institution which denied wom-  
en credit. Not only that,  
but I believe that my mother  
would also! That is, I sus-  
pect that a great many wom-  
en who do not feel committed  
to the Women's Movement, as  
such, would cooperate in a  
venture like this if the nec-  
essary information were read-  
ily available to them at the  
right time. The meat boycott  
showed the economic power that  
women can wield when they are  
angry enough and organized  
enough. The problem is mainly  
one of information. Which  
local taxicab services refuse  
to hire women drivers? Is  
there a local women's carpen-  
try group? Which financial  
agencies and which insurance  
companies are the worst?

What local businesses are  
owned by women?

A clearinghouse of such  
information, if widely pub-  
licized, could help fill this  
need. A Women's Grapevine co.  
could help Twin Cities women  
organize their potential eco-  
nomic power to help other wom-  
en who are struggling to est-  
ablish an economic base, and  
to boycott businesses that are  
hindering such efforts. It  
would act as a better business  
bureau for women. It could  
also function as a clearing-  
house for information about  
local services such as career  
counseling, day care, etc.  
and thus help women take ad-  
vantage of already existing  
services. Conveniently, much  
of this information has al-  
ready been researched by the  
staff of Changes.

How can we gather the nec-  
essary information and how  
can we keep it current? I  
propose that someone or some  
dedicated group volunteer their  
telephone. Sympathetic  
sisters who are less comm-  
itted could chip in to pay  
the phone bill. Then, women  
with information or complaints  
or services to render should  
be solicited to call this  
number and share their inform-  
ation. The telephone number  
would have to be well publi-  
cized initially. There are  
several papers in the Twin  
Cities which might be very  
eager to provide the Women's  
Grapevine with some free pub-  
licity--Changes, for instance  
or perhaps "The Minnesota  
Daily". I suspect a little  
bit of brainstorming on our  
part could find a newsworthy  
"angle" for the 'Tribune.'  
Certainly, every women's or-  
ganization in the Twin Cities  
should be called and informed  
of our telephone number. Some  
interesting bumper stickers  
could be printed up to adver-  
tise the Women's Grapevine.

Clearinghouse

All the information re-  
ceived would have to be ver-  
ified and filed. Once a fair  
amount of information was col-  
lected, other women could call  
the number and receive the  
information on file and be  
urged to verify it. After  
operation had begun, the na-  
ture of the questions re-  
ceived would help the Wom-  
en's Grapevine to define  
areas in which more inform-  
ation and services were need-  
ed. It might, for instance,  
spur the formation of a car-  
pentry collective, or help a  
struggling band survive. Or  
alter sexist hiring practices  
in a specific business.

A Women's Grapevine would  
be a helpful clearinghouse  
for information, but its use  
would probably still be lim-  
ited to the counter culture.  
A regular column in "Gold  
Flower" could be started to  
publicize what we knew and to  
encourage more women to vol-  
unteer information. The next  
step would be to publish a  
directory similar to the Black  
Yellow Pages which is publi-  
shed in Chicago as a direct-  
ory of Black businesses.

Mobilizing

The publishing of the Dir-  
ectory could be financed in  
part by approaching those in-  
dividuals and businesses which  
would be recommended by the  
directory. Hopefully, these  
people would be already app-  
reciative of the business  
sent to them by the Women's  
Grapevine and would be eager  
to advertise in such a dir-  
ectory. Thus it should be  
possible to distribute the  
directory for a nominal  
charge.

Our directory could be  
made available in bookstores  
and other women’s groups could  
help with distribution. For  
instance, the U. of M. Women's  
Liberation could make sure the  
directory was available to all  
incoming students. And surely,  
other imaginative means of  
effectively distributing the  
directory could be found.

Although most women who are  
reading this paper are comm-  
itted in principle to chang-  
ing the patriarchal structure  
of our society, our ability  
to attack it at its economic  
base is being limited by our  
lack of organization and in-  
formation. A Women's Grape-  
vine and a Women's Directory  
for the Twin Cities are rel-  
atively modest undertakings  
which could help us mobilize  
more of our resources to  
help our sisters, to pressure  
our oppressors, and to alter  
sexual power relationships.

The success of this project  
depends entirely on the real  
dedication of a large number  
of women. We need a phone.

We need all the committed vol-  
unteers we can find. We need  
money. We need the active  
support of every woman who  
has experienced discrimination.
