Prison Letter

Angela - in prison

Connie - in prison

My husband - in prison

Many close friends, who have struggled with
me, who have cared for me whom I love,
every one.

In Prison!

Like every day of my existence is spent in
scaling those walls.

By every means possible. By any means nec-
essary.

The walls must come down.

Niki is a young and sensitive woman in Shak-
Opee prison. I've seen her only once, very
briefly, but her writing has touched me
deeply. We share so many struggles. Her
clarity and perception help me to keep mov-
ing on. She agreed that women inside and
outside the joints must communicate, and
this is only a beginning. In future issues
there will be contributions from Niki and
other women in prison.

Today, this letter from Niki:

Dear Linda;

I was very pleased and excited about
your letter last night. It feels so good
to know that there are people out there who
care and allow themselves to become involv-
ed. It bridges the gap between the harsh
reality of prison and the memory of freedom.
Thank you for writing.

I'm glad you enjoy (or should I say un-
derstand) my writing. I never started shar-
ing my poetry and writing until I met Mim.
It was once my silent "release" of emotions,
anxieties and thoughts. But I feel good
knowing that other people can relate to my
struggles and our universal troubles. But
at times I find myself wondering if perhaps
it isn't in vain. (In my more dejected mo-
ments) I wonder if I can ever accomplish
something that will benefit society. Or if
these walls will silence that too.

In spite of the fact that women are
treated somewhat more humanely, the oppres-
sion is astounding. The physical conditions
are superficially glorified but the mental
punishment is impossible to function under.

We are told every day we are prisoners, and
have lost our rights, even the right to be
an individual, not verbally, but in move-
ments, expressions and looks. I sometimes
wonder if it is worth it to try. I wonder
why or what is this debt I am paying to so-
ciety. And I ask myself doesn't society
in return owe me something? It goes in cir-
cles. I ask questions and they rationalize
and make excuses.

I recently got classified here. They
recommended 18 months. Their excuse was
that since my past 5 years in institutions
was worthless, I need a long time to be
"cured." Yet they say (and I know) that I
am very institutionalized, but that can't
be helped. If the next 18 years proves
worthless, that is all there is. They can't
change that or prevent it becoming more of
a problem.

I received the issue of Gold Flower.

It is really good. The writing was beauti-
ful. I was particularly interested in the
article on Connie Trimble. She's a very
good friend of mine. She's a beautiful per-
son. I wonder every day what the result of
the trial will be. I envision her too in
prison. Because of the political controls.
But I hope I never have to see her here.
Connie is not a "murderess." And does not
need (or belong) in prison. I hope the
community gives her the moral support she
needs at trial. I wish I could be with her
then.

If you would continue to send the pa-
per I would really like it! I am planning
on sending some of my poetry too.

I am happy today. In spite of this
loneliness and infinite void shell I'm im-
prisoned in, there is sunshine. There is
a good, beautiful world out there, and peo-
ple to share it with. I have friends.

There is something more than these walls
and bars.

I will be glad to write to you. Your
letter was beautiful. I am also sending a
visitors’ form to you. In case you can stop
down sometimes. Thank you again for writ-
ing.

Yours in Struggle
Peace and Love
Niki
