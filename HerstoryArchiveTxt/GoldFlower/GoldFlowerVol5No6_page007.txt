Jane Alpert  

In mid-November, Jane Alpert  
turned herself in to the U.S. Attor-  
ney's office in New York. She had  
been living as a fugitive for more  
than four years. She jumped bail  
after being convicted with Sam Mel-  
ville of conspiracy in a series of  
anti-war bombings in New York City  
in 1969. Sam Melville was killed  
during the 1971 uprising at Attica  
State Prison in New York State.  

Last year a manifesto written  
by Jane was published in Off Our  
Backs, Ms., and other women's pa-  
pers. It was titled "Mother Right:  
A New Feminist Theory" and explain-  
ed her changing from the left to  
radical feminism. Her theory was  
that women, because of their abil-  

ity to reproduce, were "the van-  
guard."  

Judge Milton Pollack scheduled  
a hearing for January 3rd, 1975 for  
both the bail jumping and the orig-  
inal conspiracy conviction, for  
which she faces a maximum 10 years  
in jail and $100,000 in fines.  

Her lawyer said she “co-operated  
fully” with the court; and at  
her hearing it will be learned what  
that means.

Insurance Companies: Pennsylvania has taken  
the lead in outlawing insurance policies  
which discriminate against women. With the  
recently enacted Insurance Unfair Practices  
Act as legislative clout, the state moved  

in October to ban nearly 300 companies from  
selling discriminatory life, health, and  
accident policies. Such discrimination is  
now well documented, and included higher rates,  
lower benefits, and inadequate maternity  
coverage.
