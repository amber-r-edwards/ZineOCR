TO REPEAL DRAFT

Three organizations in the
nine states of Mid-America

Congress to extend it, the

men into the armed services
will end June 30, 1973. THIS
DOES NOT END THE DRAFT.

Peacetime conscription will
continue in the form of re-
quired registration by all 18

LAWS

those who fail to register,
classification of all young
men according to induction
priority assigned to them,
exemption of certain kinds of
professionals...THE DRAFT IN
PEACETIME, BEGUN IN 1948, WILL
CONTINUE UNLESS A RESOLUTION
IS PASSED IN CONGRESS TO: RE-
PEAL THE SELECTIVE SERVICE
LAW,...and to end the regis-
tration, classification,
"channeling", of all young
men, AND THE PROSECUTION OF

THOSE WHO REFUSE TO DEAL WITH

THE BUREAUCRACY.

If the induction power of
the President expires, leav-
ing a condition popularly
called “zero draft calls",
the manpower mustering author-
ity and the selective service
machinery (which classifies
and holds ready the manpower
needed for war or for counter
insurgency actions)...will be
in abeyance...READY TO BE
ACTIVATED FOR THE NEXT "VIET-
NAM"...for the continuing of
militarism in peacetime.

(See War Without End by
Michael Klare)

AMERICA HAS SUFFERED ITS
GREATEST MILITARISM DURING
THE NON-WAR YEARS...with no
declared national emergency
...building up from the 1950's
and especially in the 1960's.
AMERICA CANNOT DEMILITARIZE
WITHOUT REPEALING THE DRAFT.
Not only must the induction
power of the President expire,
but the law which creates the
selective service bureaucracy,
and provides the pool of men
which history shows CAUSES
NATIONS TO GO ON MILITARY AD-
VENTURES ABROAD:..this law
MUST BE REPEALED.

The American Civil Liberties
Union, founded after WWI to
save civil liberties from the
militarization caused by the
war, and The American Friends
Service Committee, founded
during WWI to educate for
peace and relieve the suffer-
ing from war, and the Women's
International League for
Peace and Freedom, founded
before WWI to educate people
in the relation of peace and
freedom...
