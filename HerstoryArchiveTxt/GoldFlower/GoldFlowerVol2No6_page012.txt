NYAH!!

He had to his advantage his  
cunning, his years of ex-  
perience as a hustler, and  
monetary motivation. She  

had her youth, her skill,  
and the cause of women.

Bobby Riggs met with a  
long-overdue defeat at the  
hands of Billie Jean King  
Thursday night at the Astro-  
dome. The score was a grat-  
ifying 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.

There prevailed, as ann-  
ouncers Rosemary Casals and  
Howard Cosell frequently  
pointed out, "a football at-  
mosphere," complete with a  
bare-legged drill team.  
There was a touch of carni-  
val, too, with Billie arri-  
ving on a sedan chair, Riggs  
in a baby carriage. Bobby  
gave King a huge "Sugar Dad-  
dy"--"She'll be a sucker for  
my lobs." (He turned out to  
be the sucker for her lobs.)  
She gave him a real live pig:  
let.

There was no Riggsian  
comedy in the game. Riggs  
soon realized that he had  
best play serious tennis if  
he expected to win. At  
first I was suspicious,  
thinking he was "psyching  
her out." But as the match  
went on, it became clear  
that he was "playing for his  
life."

The trappings of the match  
were clearly sexist, with  
the drill team, Cosell's  
description of King's "gown"  
and the "Tale of the Tape,"

Eugene Scott reminded us  
of the male view of sports-  
as-virility-symbol with his  
comment that Bobby, "having  
broken through Billie, he  
now wants to assume domin-  
ance" over her. Fortunately  
he never made it.

Bobby developed a very con-  
venient cramp in his right  
arm after the sixth game in  
the third set. The offici-  
als leaped to his assistance  
by flashing "Bobby Riggs--  
Age 55" on the screen. The  
ploy, of course, was unsuc-  
cessful.

Before the match, everyone  
said, "Well, it's ridiculous  
for Billie to be on the  
court--after all, he's a hus-  
tler." Now everyone will be  
saying, "Well, it was ridi-  
culous for Bobby to be out  
there on the court--after  
all, he's 55 years old.”

Now that Bobby has double-  
faulted his last serve and  
Billie Jean has returned his  
last lob, what has she pro-  
ven?

Not a thing, to me, that I  
didn't already know. She  
didn't prove that women ten-  
nis players are better than  
men. Most immediately, I  
hope the event succeeds in  
shutting Mr. Riggs up. I al-  
so hope (and think) that it  
will awaken minds and bring  
women together in a great  
surge of self-affirmation  
and pride. And third, it  
marks a milestone in the ef-  
forts of women to meet men  
on any grounds and not be de-  
feated.
