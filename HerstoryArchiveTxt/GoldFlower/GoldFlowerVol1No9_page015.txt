Walker Art Center's  
American Indian Art show  
pays eloquent tribute to a  
people who knew the "Secret  
of Humanity": "Because I  
am poor, I pray for every  
living creature."

The Exhibition--"American  
Indian Art: Form and Trad-  
ition" gathers together the  
American Indian's major art  
objects--pottery, basketry,  
hide painting, carved fig-  
ures, shields, pouches and  
painted hides.

The collection, which  
dates from the early 19th  
century to the present, pro-  
duced a profound shock in me.  
For before me I saw the  
remnants of a tradition  
both harmonious and open-  
handed. The American Indian  
understands that the land  
which nurtures him is amor-  
phous as the air he  
breathes--that the human  
walks over the land and  
sleeps upon it, but never  
owns it. And he has paid  
dearly for this understand-  
ing. I was painfully  
aware of the dichotomy be-  
tween the harmony of the  
collection and the knowledge  
of the Indian's destiny  
meted out by the white man.  
His nervous, grasping rape  
of the land nearly destroyed  
the Indian nation and has  
brought us today to this  
wasteland punctuated by the  
Vietnam war, filthy air and  
water and anomie among our  
people.

Thus, I responded to the  
great beauty of the Indian's  
art and craft. But I wonder  
if the collection is not  
telling me that only the  
darker human passions pre-  
vail and that the rape of  
the American Indian is only  
the white man's first step  
to destruction.

I chose among the wealth  
of the collection several  
objects as the most telling  
symbols of the American  
Indian:

The first is a large,  
wooden bowl sheltered in the  
wingspread of an eagle. —  
(Catalogue no. 159, Kwakiutl,  
British Columbia, probably  
late 19th century.) The  
bowl, of carved and painted  
wood, was used at potlatches,  
great ceremonial feasts at  
which the Indians outdid one  
another in giving away mat-  
erial possessions.

The massive bowl rested  
on a 5-foot stand on my  
first visit to the Exhibi-—  
tion and attracted great  
attention. The bowl demands  
to be touched. The tactil-  
ity of the object kept the  
harried guards in a state of  
apprehension, and on my  
second visit to the exhibi-  
tion, the great eagle had  
been removed to a place of  
safety, on a shelf about  
12 feet from the floor.

A Sioux girl's dress  
(catalogue no. 341, Sioux  
(Eastern).) provides a most  
ironic footnote to Anglo-  
Indian relations. The soft,  
buckskin garment has a care-  
fully beaded yoke on which  
wave two early American  
flags.

Among the many masks dis-  
played, a Nootkan Human Face  
Mask (Catalogue no. 600,  
Vancouver Island, British  
Columbia) offers the best  
statement of the Indian's  
acceptance of the necessary  
and sometimes horrific hu-  
man relation to the super-  
natural.

The huge head is of  
carved and painted wood,  
covered with luxuriant black  
horsehair, out of which  
stare black eyes made of  
bone and bead. I passed this  
head with a shudder on my  
first visit to the collec-  
tion but on my return felt  
that the eyes of the mask  
represented horror but ulti-  
mate acceptance of mortality.

An Arapaho Ghost Dance  
shirt (Catalogue no. 293) is  
a mute testament to the des-  
peration of the American  
Indian when he was driven  
further and further from his  
home.

After Chief Crazy Horse  
died, the Indian called  
upon his ancestors to return  
and save the Indian from the  
white man. The Indians im-  
portuned their ancestor-  
ghosts with a seven-year  
dance. The Ghost Dance  
Shirt bears the fantastic  
marks of this venture: On  
a ground of blue painted  
buckskin flutter four black  
birds, a tortoise and two  
men on a field of brilliant  
stars.

As I completed my  
second tour of the Exhibi-  
tion, I was struck by the  
grace and gaiety of the  
floral beadwork on an Ojib-  
wa beaded cloth bandoleer  
bag. The delicate coloring  
and graceful intertwining of  
the design display the wood-  
land Indian's intimacy with  
his surroundings.

"American Indian Art:  
Form and Tradition" runs  
through December 31, 1972.  
It is Walker Art Center's  
best show since reopening  
two years ago.

I have two criticisms  
of the Exhibition: The  
numbering and labeling of  
individual art objects are  
extremely difficult to find.  
The labels are grouped on  
walls adjoining each sec-  
tion of the Exhibition rath-  
er than being closely  
attached to each object.  
And the $8.50 charge for  
the Exhibition Catalogue is  
outrageous.

Despite these failings,  
Walker has done a service  
to the community in bring-  
ing us closer to the Amer-  
ican Indian's art and phil-  
osophy, best stated by  
Crowfoot, orator for the  
Blackfoot Confederacy, on  
his deathbed in 1890:

"It is the breath of a  
buffalo in the winter  
time. It is the little  
shadow which runs  
across the grass and  
loses itself in the  
sunset."

"American Indian Art: Form  
and Tradition" is a FREE  
Exhibition, although a don-  
ation of 50 cents is sugg-  
ested.
