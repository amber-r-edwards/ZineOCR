Women’s Studies Dot Minneapolis  
High School English Curricula  

Ars Reveal Sexism  

"This is the most exciting  
course I have ever taught,"  
said Martha Harris, an Eng-  
lish teacher at South High in  
Minneapolis. The class is  
called "Man/Woman." Its pur-  
pose was to examine male-fe-  
male relationships, roles,  
and attitudes expressed in  
various literary forms. It  
was a sexually mixed class,  
though women outnumbered men  
three to one.  

To promote understanding a-  
mong the students, Harris us-  
ed consciousness-raising exer-  
cises prescribed by the Emma  
Willard Task Force on sexism  
in education. For example,  
she asked the class to com-  
plete the sentence(s), "I  
would (not) like to be a wo-  
man (man) because..." This  
exercise revealed that the stu-  
dents held traditional views  
of sexual roles: I would not  
like to be a man because men  
have to be tough and support  
a family, or I would like to  
be a woman because they are  
soft and expressive.  

Another exercise was to com-  
pare derogatory slang words  
for women and men. The list  
for men was noticeably short-  
er. Harris reports that this  
exercise was particularly ef-  
fective. "The lights went  
on like this!" she said, ex-  
tending her fingers with a  
snap.  

To begin their study of li-  
terary expression, the stu-  
dents studied song lyrics and  
discussed the attitudes  
found in them. They found a  
lot of negativism about re-  
lationships in the songs.  

As Ms. Harris said, there was  
a lot of "I can't live with-  
out you" rather than "I can  
live without you but it's  
nice to have you here."  

The class examined myths--  
Greek, Roman, Oriental, and  
Native American. They found  
traditional sexual roles: wo-  
men in the domestic role and  
men in the hunter role.  

They examined contemporary  
short stories, including J.  
D. Salinger's "Pretty Mouth  
and Green My Eyes," Joyce Car-  
ol Oates' "Where Are You Go-  
ing, Where Have You Been"--and  
found few healthy characters.  
Harris, hating to have every-  
thing seem so negative, intro-  
duced the story, "X--A Fabu-  

BY JAN JIRAK  

lous Child's Story," Ms. Mag-  
azine, December 1972. It is  
a story of a child whose sex  
was concealed. All the stud-  
ents enjoyed reading it but  
insisted that X had to be a  
boy--apparently boys can do  
girl things, but girls can't  
do boy things.  

The class read one novel:  
Temple of God by William Gold-  
man. It is the story of a  
desperately vacuous man who  
exploits a series of desper-  
ately vacuous women. By the  
time they read this book, the  
end of the trimester was imm-  
inent, and their conscious-  
nesses had been raised--they  
"got very angry at the male  
character," Harris said.  

The class will be offered  
the rest of this year and  
next year since student inter-  
est is so high, and Harris  
feels the class she taught  
were fairly open to discus-  
sion about women's liberation.  
During a brief discussion on  
the subject, she notes with  
satisfaction, one of the  
young men said, "That's just  
as much for men, then, too."  

Communication Skills  

The title of Phebe Hanson's  
class changes daily. The  
Minneapolis Vocational High  
School class' formal name is  
"Woman/Man," but "on alter-  
nate days we call it, 'Man/  
Woman'." The men had com-  
plained--they felt discrimin-  
ated against.  

Phebe's honest humor peppers  
conversation about the class.  
She says she used Carole King  
King's "You Make Me Feel Like  
a Natural Woman" and Cat Ste-  
vens' "Hard Headed Woman" to  
compare attitudes about women.  
"They (the students) weren't  
as excited about the songs as  
I was--I thought they were  
great.”  

She seems to tap the Univer-  
sal Energy, presenting a mul-  
titude of projects to her  
class. Looking through my  
notes, I find over 15--not  
bad for 12 weeks.  

For example, the class drew  
up lists of good/bad things  
about being a woman/man, put-  
ting the woman lists on a  
blue sheet and the man things  
on a pink sheet. Examples of  
bad things about being a man:  
Having to pay for dates.  

Cops like to pick us up.  

Good things: Not having to  
wear a shirt. Getting intox-  
icated more slowly than women.  
Bad things about being a wom-  
an: Being stared at. Being  
called the weaker sex. Good  
things: Being able to get in-  
to bars at 16 'cause you look 18.  
Being the gentler sex.  

The students wrote essays  
on "What I Have Learned from  
My Mother/Father about Being  
a Woman/Man." In some cases,  
this assignment resulted in  
unprecedented communication  
between parents and offspring  
and one father even showed  
his son a love letter he had  
written to his wife during  
their courtship.  

Ms. Hanson used the work  
of photographer Diane Arbus.  
She gave each student a photo  
and asked them to write a  
character sketch for the per-  
son in the photo. At first  
they did not like their char-  
acters, but as they wrote,  
they developed compassion for  
them. The students then sep-  
arated into small groups and  
wrote plays with the charac-  
ters they had developed.  

The students wrote imagin-  
ary letters to Ann Landers,  
describing problems with the  
opposite sex. Exchanging let-  
ters, they answered each oth-  
ers questions, thinking  
through problems and develop-  
ing writing skills at the  
same time.  

The class viewed several  
films, among them one about  
role reversal called Mascu-  
linity/Femininity. Exploring  
the ideas in it, they wrote  
essays on what would happen  
if their parents switched sex-  
ual roles.  

The class learned interview-  
ing skills from the documen-  
tary Growing Up Female. They  
interviewed students in other  
English classes, some went  
downtown to talk to people,  
some looked for certain peo-  
ple, like the elderly, and  
some tried to get a cross sec-  
tion of the population. The  
students also interviewed  
each other. They thought up  
ten questions they would ask  
someone of the same/opposite
