Women's place is still  
very much down and out  
in the decision making  
process of St. Paul city  
government. This was evident  
in a meeting last week be-  
tween Mayor Larry Cohen and  
approximately twenty people  
from the St. Paul chapter  
of NOW. Despite Cohen's  
Affirmative Action Program  
aimed at eliminating dis-  
crimination against women  
and minorities we find:  

The Human Rights Dept. and  
Model Cities are the only  
programs in which women  
find representation in  
above the clerical level.  
In the Human Rights Dept.  
there are only nineteen  
women in such paid positions  
as compared with 100 men.  

A county Affirmative Action  
officer, Ken Jones, refuses  
to deal with the women's  
issue as a concern of the  
program until minorities  
achieve complete represen-  

police dept. are not only  
unaware of other cities  
hiring women for traditionally  
male jobs, but refuse  
to do so. Instead, they ex-  
cuse the situation by  
citing qualifying tests and  
height and weight restric-  
tions that often don't  
reflect needs of the job.  
Cohen, who generally took  
the stance of a willing,  

SKILLS  

Interested in serving  
on a public interest  
board? Women's Skills  
Bank is a group now  
working to increase the  
number of women appoin-  
ted to state boards by  
the Governor's office.  

A coalition of many  
diverse women's groups  
within the city, it's  
hoping to extend its  
services to women out-  
state as well. In order  
to ensure better rep-  
resentation for all  
groups they are asking  
help in finding inter-  
ested women for these  
positions. Maintaining  

a current list of vacan-  
cies, Skills Bank will  
set up files of such  
people to recommend as  
openings occur on the  
boards.  

Any of these positions  
pay a per diem amount  

NOW and Cohen Dispute  
Human Rights Progress  

His announcement that Ed  
McGaw, a local coordinator  
of AIM, was his new appoin-  
tee as deputy Director of  
the Human Rights Dept. drew  
several groans. It seems  
these women have made many  
unsuccessful attempts to  
convince McGaw of the jus-  
tice of or even the meaning  
of a women's rights move-  
ment.  
Embarrassed earlier by a  
lack of any employment  
figures on women in city  
government, Cohen now had  
to admit he “hadn't thought  
to question” McGaw on  
women's rights issues.  
Yes, he realized that  
many of the complaints  
received by Human Rights  
were under sex discrim-  
ination. Yes, someone  
in his position should  
be aware of sexism in  
the city departments.  
No, he didn't feel firing  
McGaw, police chief Rowan  
(who he didn't appoint),  
or Ken Jones and publicly  
announcing the cause as  
sexism, would help the  
matter. He seemed dis-  
turbed, however, and at  
least made a promise to  
change the situation.  
Other concerns of the  
group were also taken  
into consideration by  
Cohen. It was requested  
that the Consumer Protec-  
tion Agency investigate  
discriminatory practices  

or expenses for meetings  
and are on such license  
and examining boards as  
the following;  
Board of Health  
Nursing Homes  
Accountancy  
Architects, Engineers  
Cosmetology  
Psychology  
Veterinary

Cohen also expressed con-  
cern over the tendency of  
Affirmative Action to in-  
crease competition between  
minority and women's  
issues. He claimed a more  
“wholistic” approach was  
needed and committed him-  
self to that end.  

All in all, the meeting  
didn't indicate a hopeless  
situation, but one where  

a lot of pushing, pulling,  
and general consciousness  
raising is still needed.

They seem to have more in-

good reception.  

LIFE IN  
MIDDLE EARTH  
A St. Paul art shop and  
gallery is currently fea-  
turing the work of four  
local artists, two of the  
women. Their exhibits are  
at Middle Earth, 2042  
St. Clair Ave. and will  
continue through Oct. 31.  
A variety of prints done  
by lithograph, etching,  
seriograph, and block  
printing are being shown  
by former Minneapolis art  
instructor, Joan Bohlig.  
Her main subjects, child-  
ren and nature objects,  
seem stereotypical areas  
for a woman, but are made  
interesting by her mostly  
imagistic style of work.  
Bohlig also creates non-  
representational collages  
as a form of painting. She  
regards her interpretation  
of sprouts and melting  
snow, etc. primarily as  
"statements about color,  
arrangement and pattern."  
Large, unconventional and  
imaginative wall hangings  
are the work of the second  
woman artist, Riana Scamp.  
They are made mostly from  
macramé twine with such  
additions as shells and  
beads placed for specific  
effect. Originally from  
Holland, Scamp has won  
numerous awards for her  
creations and is a maker  
of fine jewelry as well.  
The two men in the show,  
Mike Ehrigh and Doug John-  
son, also present some in-  
teresting work in pottery  
and blown glass. It's a  
small exhibit, but worth  
seeing, whether you want  
to buy or just look. More  
information can be gotten  
from the Middle Earth  
people at 698-4377.
