Abortions Legal,  
But Costly  

Northwestern Hospital, while  
Nora Shroeder of Mt. Sinai em-  
phasizes that “we will work  
with private physicians connec-  
ted with the hospital."  

Most other local hospitals  
have not yet announced their  
abortion policies.  

Recognizing that "most women  
would rather stay here," Ms.  
Johnson of WCS points out,  
"There's an overload here al-  
ready. Minneapolis doctors are  
not yet experienced in the pro-  
cedures. We are referring  
women who need salines or D&Cs  
(mid-pregnancy abortions) to  
local doctors, but under 12  
weeks we're still referring to  
New York."  

Welfare Pays,  
Blue Cross  
Hesitates...  

Women on welfare can have  
abortions without cost, but  
women covered by Blue Cross  
health insurance cannot.  

Executive Jim Keeler of Blue  
Cross has no comment as to that  
major health insurance agency's  
stand on abortion coverage,  
calling it “a volatile issue"  
and commenting that "the matter  
is under exhaustive study."  

However, a Feb. 8 directive  
from assistant director Frank  
Palmer of the welfare department  
read in part, "In inquiries re-  
ceived from recipients or from  
the medical community in refer-  
ence to payment for abortions,  
the staff response will be that  
abortion is a matter between  
the client and her physician.  

"If the physician recommends  
abortion," the statement con-  
tinues, “and we are billed for  
this medical service by a lis-  
censed medical vendor or medi-  
cal facility, payment will be  
made from Title 19 (Medicaid)  
fund."  

Welfare recipients, including  
women receiving Aid to Families  
with Dependent Children (AFDC),  
will be referred to welfare  
department counseling services  
should they seek abortion coun-  
seling, the statement further  
states.  

Despite the recent Supreme  
Court ruling allowing abortions  
up to six months after concep-  
tion, women in the Twin Cities  
will find prices high, doctors  
inexperienced and hospital reg-  
ulations obstructive, a recent  
survey showed.  

Three counseling services  
revealed that they will contin-  
ue to provide referrals to wom-  
en in need of abortions, al-  
though some will be advised to  
seek such medical aid in an-  
other state.  

“Things are changing so fast,"  
says Pam Johnson of the Women's  
Counseling Service, while Paula  
Wendt of Abortion Counseling  
Service says, "The Supreme  
Court Decision took us all by  
surprise."  

Both services--WCS at 827-  
3819 and ACS at 545-8085--  
are referring callers to local  
physicians associated with a  
hospital which provides facil-  
ities for pregnancy termina-  
tion.  

"But we are still referring  
about ten women a week out of  
state,” says Ms. Wendt. “We  
probably receive 50-60 calls a  
week. Before the law was changed  
we saw that many women person-  
ally each week, but we aren't  
keeping a record of the number  
of phone referrals now."  

* Abortion Counseling Service,  
one of the first such agencies  

in the state, will close after  

the "transitional period," Ms.  

Wendt disclosed.  

Women's Counseling Service  
is still referring many callers  
to clinics in New York or other  
states with liberal abortion  
laws. According to Ms. Johnson,  
"It is still cheaper for many  
women to go to New York, parti-  
cularly under 12 weeks. We pro-  
vide about 20 referrals a week  
to New York clinics. The price  
is about $100 there, plus trans-  
portation--a total of about $217  
if you fly standby."  

She compares this to the $225  
announced price for abortions  
at Twin Cities hospitals.  

Another local counseling  
service, Planned Parenthood,  
will “maintain the referral  
policy for those who elect to  
have abortions," says executive  
director Thomas Weber. "And  
we will watch closely as health  
facilities begin to provide this  
service. After the health sys-  
tem decides what it will do, we  
will assess the care offered  
against Planned Parenthood  
standards and then make decisi-  
ons about local referrals."  

Weber says that Planned Par-  
enthood is still providing out-  
of-state referrals at this time.  

Several local hospitals, in-  
cluding Abbott-Northwestern,  
Hennepin General, and Mt. Sinai,  
have recently announced that  
they will provide facilities  
for doctors to perform abor-  
tions. "We are prepared to  
offer facilities to those of  
our medical staff who ask for  
and are approved for the priv-  
ilege," said Robert Miller of

Ms. Magazine  
Editor/ Publisher  

will be a speaker at the  
Consumer Information Center  
in  
Dayton's Sky Room on

at 7:30 p.m.*  

Sponsored by the Twin Cities  
Executive Board, the Minne-

"The wheel that creaks  
most gets the most oil,"  
Mary Manning of the U.S.  
Department of Labor told  
an audience of 150 women at  
last week's Equal Employment  

Rights Workshop. "Women  
must be knowledgeable about  
their rights, and make  
others knowledgeable.  
Otherwise we'll be put on  
the back burner for years."  

Ms. Manning, Regional Dir-  
ector of the Department's  
Women's Division, charged  
that women “are losing  
ground, not gaining it,"  
in the struggle for equal  
employment rights, noting  
that "40 percent of cases  
involving employment dis-  
crimination are brought in  
regards to sex discrimina-  
tion."  

Ms. Manning was keynote  
speaker at the Model City  
sponsored employment work-  
shop, held on January 27 at  
Sabathani Community Center.  
She described the cultural  
conditioning that “makes  
women show their hemlines  
but not their brains. To  

be intelligent or highly  
educated is unfeminine,  
though studies show that  
brain power is equally dis-  
tributed between the sexes.  
What is not equally distrib-  
uted is use of brain power."  
Ms. Manning maintained that  
women must take responsibil-  
ity for their career ad-  
vancement. “Women have  
waited for too long for Sir  
Galahad to come and save  
them--have waited, been stu-  
pid and been very quiet."  
She suggested that women  
make use of their legal pre-  
rogatives, for "if manage-  
ment can say that women  
don't care, the laws won't  
amount to much."  

Joan Munday, Federal Women's  
Program coordinator for the  
U.S. Department of Housing  
and Urban Development (HUD),  
described federal affirma-  
tive action regulations,  
pointing out that "the re-  
sponsibility for action  
falls on those most affected  
by job discrimination."  

“The role of women employees  
is therefore more than just  
doing their job," Ms. Munday  
asserted. "We must make  
things more equal for our-  
selves, our co-workers, and  
all women who apply for jobs  
at our company."  
Federal regulations demand  
goals and timetables to
