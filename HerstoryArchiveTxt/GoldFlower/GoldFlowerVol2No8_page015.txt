SELF PORTRAIT BY JOAN JOHNSTONE

Hand-tinted photographs reminiscent of
early 20th century postcards are featured
in an exhibition on view through December
30 at the upstairs gallery of the Afro-
American Cultural Arts Center, 24 S. 31st
Street, Minneapolis.

The photographs are the work of a young
woman artist, Joan Johnstone, whose work
has been seen before in University exhibi-
tions and who worked as a portfolio artist
with Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio in New
York before returning to Minneapolis early
this year.

The technique is an original one, invented
by Johnstone through experimental attempts
to reproduce the delicate colors of the old
postcards she collects. Working on matte
paper, she creates smooth surfaces with oil
color, brilliant highlights with water dyes.

Johnstone points out that her work, al-
though experimental, is an enlargement of
traditional photographic techniques and
is not done merely for the sake of exper-
imentation. “My technique modifies the
black-and-white photograph, and gives it
more impact," Johnstone says. The photo-
graphs are painted in a careful process
that may take up to ten hours.

Women’s Film Festival

A free women’s film festival, "Women in
the Reel World," will be held in Ann Arbor,
Michigan, on February 6, 7, 8 and 9, 1974.

“Women in the Reel World" is being organ-
ized by Women's Media and the Ann Arbor Wo-
men's Video Workshop, in conjunction with the
Women's Studies Program of the University of
Michigan.

Included in the festival will be films
made by women representing various national-
ities and diverse historical periods. Also
the festival committee is accepting 16 mm
films from women on any subject, any genre,
any length.

The festival is non-competitive. It will
provide exposure for films rarely given wide
public viewings. New filmmakers are espec-
ially encouraged to submit their works. New
Morning Films, an eleven-state distributor,
will be screening films for possible distrib-
ution. Anyone desiring further information

ittee, Women's Studies Program, 1958 LS&A
