No Sale at the Check Out Counter

by Cheryl Trulen

The bar fogged by smoke and shaded by
Tiffany lamps acts as the check out
counter for copulation. On one side
of the foam rubber bar sit the cats---
older ones in prim grey suits while
the younger sport bells. Their blood-
shot eyes eagerly survey the vulnerable

prey---eyeing especially the frontal
projections.

On the other side of the screwdriver the
chicks

lay. Chicks feel the sting of meat stare.
Bodies exposed before the vibes of mind had
time to dance. Horny cat braver than the
rest makes contact with one chick. He rubs
his coarse suit against her bare arm while

whispering gin tinged nothings in her ear.

She repulses him with ice---MIND BEFORE
FLESH

PLEASE! The cat leaves dragging his limp
tail

REQUIEM

behind him. The chick's dignity is raised

I live on a border.

After a day at work in one country

speaking a strange language

behaving in an alien culture

if a movie on my own time is more of
the same

if a bar or music is more of the same

if the streets and the people in them

are more of the same

I eat alone in my room

and try to clean up what the day has
done to me.

beyond her frontal projections.

Copulation, for now, not a check out counter
affair.

Sometimes I am forced

to shut down everything around me

the weather, the neighbors, the shades,

the nerve endings, the heart, the
others,

until I've eaten the warmed over death.

I shut down everything in my country

and sometimes I don't come out for
years

and sometimes I don't come out at all

and sometimes I come out vomiting all
over

myself--to be sure--

but I live in such a small country

that puke which turns everything into
itself

spills inevitably past the border

and They choke on it,

but I don't

because mourning sickness

is a staple in my country.
