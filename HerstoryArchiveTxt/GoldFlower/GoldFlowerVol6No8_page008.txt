HISTORICAL ORIGINS

Increasingly, as Capitalism
replaced Feudalism in Nine-
teenth Century Europe, power
over one of our life-giving
resources, our medical know-
ledge, passed from a state of
control by the people to a
state of control by the indus-
trial class. The industrial
classes, which own the labor
of the peoples in their respect-
ive countries and all of the
natural elements in the various
countries, use these men and
goods to make money for them-
selves; and this is Capitalism.
Just like everything of value,
medicine is organized for profit
in Capitalist America today.
Medicine has not been organized
for health.

Much of the "underdeveloped" world
is in a Feudal condition anal-
ogous to a condition Europe was
in before the rise of Capitalism.
During the Feudal days in Europe,
wealth resided in the direct
labor on the land for food,
shelter and clothing. Medicine
only had an indirect importance
in-so-far-as it kept serfs
healthy in order to work the
land. Therefore medicine was
left to the province of the
populace. The many wise men and
women (like witch doctors in
colonialist and neocolonialist
countries) took care of the
worker's complaints.

WOMEN OPPRESSED

When industrialists found ways
to make money off of the sale
of man-made or refined drugs
and monopoly medicine, there
were pockets of resistance to
the new-style health care. The
very largest group to be excluded
from the Capitalist economy and
to be consigned to the old
Feudal economy were women. Wo-
men worked in the home to pro-
vide goods for their family, not
goods for trade. Naturally
women continued to practice

the old-style health care and
were persecuted as witches for
doing so—they knew too much
about simple, natural and high-
ly effective prevention and
remedy.

It is no coincidence that modern
renewal of herbal medicine is
growing in strength with the
growth of a strong women’s move-
ment. It remains for us to
become personally acquainted

with the vast lore women over
the centuries have left as our
legacy. It is not surprising
that ancient cures for women's
particular physique are numer-
ous. The lore can be classified
into three areas: Menstruation;

WOMEN’S HERBAL LORE .. x.

Conception and Birth or Miscar-
riage and Abortion; and thirdly
Cleanliness and Venereal Dis-
ease.

MENSTRUATION __

“Herbalists have listed some herbs
to bring down menstruation and
some to lessen the flow of

blood. Other plants are rec-
ommended to reduce cramping or to
regulate the menstrual cycle.

Chamomile

Chamomile (Anthemis nobilis)
hinders heavy menstruation.
(This page reference, p. 46

and all page references to

Herb Growing For Health, by
Donald Law.) Chamomile makes

a pleasant tea using the tops
of the plant and can be found
or grown in our climate. In
fact there are some that grow
in my backyard. Fennel (Foeni-
culum vulgare) on the other
hand encourages menstruation

to start, as well as increases
the milk supply of nursing
mothers. Use the seeds (p. 58)
in an infusion. Lupins (Lup-
inus) will normalize menstrua-
tion (p. 80) by regulating the
ovarian cycle. In addition this
versatile seed will be useful
to expel the placenta after

childbirth.
CHILDBIRTH

For those wishing a child or
for those with an unwanted
pregnancy, there are secrets
in nature's medicine chest.
Sarsaparilla (Smilax Officinalis)
is a natural drug that
has been investigated by mod-
ern scientific techniques. It
has been found that sarsaparilla
contains the hormone progester-
one, an essential hormone to
reproduction and could in this
respect favor conception
(from Nate's Medicines, by
Richard Litas, p. 60). Fever-
few tea of the leaves and
flowers (Pyrethrum Parthenium)
has also been cited by Donald
Law as aiding conception.
Taken internally, this plant
regulates the ovarian-menstrual
cycle. Truly a woman's nat-
ural ally, Feverfew (p. 59)
steam should rise up the birth
canal during difficult labor

as the woman delivers her child
from a natural sitting position.

ABORTION

There are herbs to bring a baby
to term and others with abortive
properties. Our old friend
feverfew prevents miscarriage.
Elderberry bark (Sambucus Nigra)
could cause expulsion of a fetus
(p. 54). Since abortion can

be dangerous to the mother's
life, it is advisable to seek
non-sexist health care in add-
ition to herbal remedies, as is
also the case with childbirth.

Besides increasing milk supply
with Fennel, as we have mention-
ed, nursing women occasionally
seek relief for sore nipples.

I haven't been able to find a
local herb for this purpose

but two imported cures, papaya
leaf (Carica Papaya) and powdered
Myrrh could be purchased (see
Richard Lucas). Papaya leaves
should be bruised, roasted and

applied as a dressing. Tincture
of Myrrh (Balsamodendron Myrrha)
is 2 oz. tincture of Myrrh and
one half oz. tincture of Cap-
sicum, 4–8 drops in a large

quantity of water, and is
applied locally.

CLEANLINESS
& DISEASE

One strong decoction of leaves
recommended for external ulcers
on the genitalia is Herb Robert
(Geranium Robertianum, p. 68).
Since some external sores are
indicative of syphilis, it is
wise to have an exploratory
physical and lab work done for
all suspected cases of venereal
disease. A lighter, cleansing
douche can be made from common
Blackberry leaves in boiled

and cooled water, (Rubus Frut-
icosus). Avens (Geum Urbanum)
has been recommended by the
famous herbalist Aloysius Browne
for mucous discharge from the
vagina. The leaves of Avens
are used in preparing a douche.

The helpful plants in this
article do not exhaust the
listing for good women's health
care. I hope that other women
will investigate herb recognition
and gathering or herb gardening
with thoughts for improving

our knowledge of ourselves. One
local place for purchasing herbs
or requesting them is the Red
Star Apothecary, which sells
through the food co-operatives.
Here are some herb distributors
