A DIVINE COMEDY ......

I hear lots of men saying  
there's no humor in the wo-  
men's movement. They seem  
to think that when a woman  
becomes a feminist, she for-  
gets how to laugh.

That propaganda is another  
boring example of male opaci-  
ty and American double-think.  
It is, in fact, the women's  
movement that allows us to  
laugh. Men who mourn the  
dearth of humor are too dense  
to know when they're being  
laughed at.

In the old days before the  
second wave, women had one  
alternative to choose from in  
responding to her situation:  
insanity. Thinking women did  
go insane: Sylvia Plath at  
one extreme, and women who  
resigned themselves to the  
quiet madness of everyday  
life at the other. Psycholo-  
gists still accord qualities  
of an unbalanced person to a  
"normal woman"—dependence,  
weakness. Now, the women's  
movement encourages a second  
alternative: laughter.

Humor lies in the incongru-  
ity of situations. During a  
recent TV documentary on H.L.  
Mencken the narrator said,  
"Sally's (the college English  
professor Mencken married) in-  
telligence was very real—but  
so was her femininity!" Some  
jokes, such as the poster of  
Golda Meir entitled "But can  
she type?" take a sadly com-  
mon situation and carry its  
incongruity one step further  
into humor. Everyone knows  
women who hold master's deg-  
rees plus years of experience  

But can she type?  

who are stuck in secretarial  
positions. The joke about  
the want ad requesting a per-  
son who can walk on water and  
type 60 words per minute is  
by now an old one. Perhaps  
if males do not think those  
jokes are funny it is because  
they see no incongruity in  
those situations; after all,  
drudge work is woman's natur-  
al domain no matter how qual-  
ified she is.

“Hire him.  
He’s got great legs.”

Sometimes feminist humor  
ridicules situations common  
to women. By placing a male  
in a woman's situation, we  
see how ludicrous the situa-  

tion is. For example, the  
"Hire him. He's got great  
legs." poster. A similar ex-  

ample was aired on the Mary  
Tyler Moore show recently.  
Resident oaf Ted Baxter wore  
a pair of platform shoes  
which gave him a precarious  
and awkward walk. The scene  
was the funniest of the whole  
show. I wonder how many peo-  
ple realized that it's just  
as ridiculous for women to  
wear such handicapping cloth-  
es—and by extension, dress-  
es, girdles (I saw an ad for  
girdles the other day, so I  
assume some women still wear  
them!) and to practice such  
self-mutilation as shaving  
and eyebrow-tweezing.

"If Michelangelo had been  
a girl, her mother might have  
said, 'You draw nicely, dear.  
Now wash the shirts, give the  
baby his dinner, and sweep  
the kitchen for me, there's  
a good girl.'"

Laughter is Powerful

Men know the power of laugh-  
ter and have used it against  
women for centuries, making  
us ashamed of things to which  
no shame should be attached  
to keep us insecure and pow-  
erless. They made us ashamed  
of being strong, of being in-  
dependent, of having hair un-  
der our arms. Now that we  
have self-respect, we no long  
er laugh at those things. We  
do not admire the self-depre-  
cation of Lucille Ball, but  
turn rather to Lily Tomlin,  
who only does characters who  
like and respect themselves.

Laughter is used as a wea-  
pon in the women's movement,  
too, to strip men of that mys-  
tical aura of power with  
which they surround themselv-  
es. A group of women talked  
recently about the difficulty  
of getting jobs, the insin-  
cerity of the business world,  
the way revealing one's true  
self would preclude any pos-  
sibility of employment. The  
discussion generated into a  
hilarious listing of "How not  
to get a job." The ideas  
ranged from wearing jeans to  
the interview to revealing  
one's involvement in radical  
feminism, each suggestion  
funnier and truer than the  
last. Finally a quiet woman  
said, "Just take a copy of  
Lesbian Nation with you to  
the interview—you'd never  
get hired!"

This comment would not be  
funny if it were not based on  
some very tragic facts: the  
stifling conformity of busi-  
ness and the blanket practice  
of discrimination against  
gays.

On the other hand, this  
joke makes us forget for a  
moment the excessive power  
personnel recruiters wield  
and puts them into proper per-  
spective. You can't help  
seeing, in your mind's eye,  

a self-important, blue-suited  
male, mouth open, eyes roll-  
ing, and for once, speechless.

And finally, if men cannot  
see beyond their usually sim-  
ple-minded and often cruel  
definitions of humor to the  
more mature women's humor, I  
must remind them that the  
women's movement was born of  
a truly unhappy situation.

It is a serious attempt to  
eradicate unnecessary misery  
from human life. There is  
nothing funny about being  
oppressed.”
