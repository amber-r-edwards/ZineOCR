PENTAGRAPH. 

Aquarius is often called
the sign of the procrastin-
ator and Arcotti--as an
Aquarius of the first water
--thus duly sits to compose
this column mere hours be-
fore deadline.

This is not, of course, to
suggest that Aquarius is
lazy. Far from it, she is
the living exemplar of the
adage, “If you want some-
thing done, ask a busy per-
son to do it."

Women of the Waterbearer's
sign have much to learn from
the greatest of their breed-
-women like Virginia Woolf,
Elizabeth Blackwell, Susan
B. Anthony, Gertrude Stein,
Susan Sontag, Amy Lowell--
and what these women teach
is the lesson of concentra-
ted energy. Any common-
place Aquarian (Aquarienne?)
has energy to spare, but she
deludes herself that it is
boundless and squanders it
in meaningless projects.

Rumors abound about this
eleventh zodiacal sign, most
of them flattering but mis-
leading. So, in an orderly
fashion not at all typical
of the sign, let us examine
several of these myths and
the circumstances that give
rise to them.

1. Altruism. Aquarius be-
ing conversationally promis-
cuous, her social manner
suggests that she is a true
egalitarian, associating
with persons of any class,
color, creed or sex. Alas,
the lass too often is spur-
red less by humanitarian in-
terest than by fascination
with the unusual, for Aquar-
ius commits herself selec-
tively and then usually to
those she considers of her
own superior mentality. If
you have ever felt frauded
by Aquarian "altruism," bear
in mind that this sign above
all is able to love mankind
and dislike people.

2. Eccentricity. Ah, ec-
centricity. The Aquarius
female is oft pictured as
a strange old lady who in-
sists on wearing tennis
shoes in winter to match her
straw fedora. An exaggera-
tion, that, but Aquarius
herself is prone to exagger-
ate, whence springs many of
those curious mannerisms of
which astrologers love to
gossip.

Aquarius occurs when the
sun, opposite the sign it
rules, is weakest; the Aqua-
rius ego is the weakest in
the zodiac. Hold the jeers
momentarily: Aquarius exag-
gerates herself because she
fears she'd be overlooked
if she didn't. Contradict-
ory Aquarius desperately
wants to stand out from the
masses of humanity--which
she professes to love.

3. Loyalty. Although each
Aquarian will have a differ-
ent excuse for her aloof-
ness, all are difficult to
know well. But once you've
penetrated her defenses,
you'll have to amputate her
from your life to be rid of
her. Probably Aquarius’ fin-
est capability is that of
loyal friendship, in which
sex is an optional part.

To understand Aquarius,
watch your reactions as the
sun transits that sign.
People curse the midwinter
cold; they've left their
boots at home and are light-
ly dressed. Spring, still
months away, seems to hang
in the air, and the omni-
present snow insults our
expectations. Just so, Aqua-
rius lives in the future and
is impatient with the pre-
sent.
