Willie Mae Demmings is a black woman. Her race is significant, for police harassment and brutality toward oppressed races and the poor is being stepped up here and throughout the nation. Demmings tells her own story.  

"On Monday evening, April 20, at about 7:30 p.m., I was across the street at the home of neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Glen Odom, when another neighbor's boy came in and said, 'Mrs. Demmings, the police are at your house and they said your son, Greg (Demmings) robbed the Clark Station.'  

"I laughed because I knew it wasn't true and got up to see what it was all about. I wasn't really concerned because I knew that Greg was in Stillwater prison at that time. I sort of took my time going out to see what was happening because I knew the joke was on them. When I got out into the street where I could see my door, I got alarmed because I could see the police cars and three policemen, with guns in their hands, pounding and kicking on my door, telling my kids to let them in.  

"The kids had locked the door. I began to run and yell at the policemen, because I knew I was sure that they were going to break my door in and maybe start shooting with my kids inside. I asked them what was the matter, and they asked me did I live there, and I said yes.  

"Then they said that the Clark Station had been robbed and that my son Greg, and Doug, had done it, because three neighbors had said they had seen them run into my house and they were going in to get them. I told them that this was not true and there wasn't anyone inside except me and my children. They told me I didn't know who was there because I wasn't home myself. All this time we were on the porch and the kids still had the front door locked so that no one could come in.  

"When I told Randy to unlock the door and let me in, he did, and as I was easing backwards into the house, one policeman just pushed himself right over me with his billy club ready. Then the three of them grabbed my head and pushed it into the door facing, so that my neck fitted into the door jam part so that I couldn't turn my head. Then they pushed my body way up into my back and said, 'let's arrest the ----.'  

Willie Mae Demmings was tried on June 2, found guilty as charged. She is appealing the decision. The NAACP (130 S. 10th St., Mpls. 55403), who is defending her, needs funds. Anyone interested in helping the fight against police brutality may call 823-4535.
