PSYCHOLOGY and WOMEN

AT MARSHALL 'U' HIGH SCHOOL

Dr. Lois Erickson at the  
University of Minnesota has  
developed a curriculum to pro-  
mote psychological maturity  
in women using a developmental  
framework derived from the  
theories of Jane Loevinger  
and Lawrence Kohlberg.

Loevinger's theory postulates  
that an individual's ego develops  
from a young child's differentiation  
between self and non-self  
through various stages of e-  
motional and social development  
to a possible "integrated" stage  
in which complexity of thought,  
perception of choices, respect  
for others' autonomy, and a valuing  
of justice are predominant.  
Kohlberg's position is that  
moral development progresses  
along stages of growth which  
increasingly integrate the  
concept of justice—from a  
"what's in it for me" instru-  
mental hedonism orientation  
toward a possible stage of  
moral decision-making based  
on principles of universal  
justice... Thus, they both see  
human growth as progressing  
along stages—which directly  
can provide a goal for educa-  
tion.

This goal, movement along  
the developmental stages of  
growth has become the major  
objective in Erickson's cur-  
riculum for women.

Extensive research indicates  
that American men are  
more likely to reach higher  
stages of development than  
American women. Most women  
remain on stage 3, social  
conforming orientation, while  
about four times as many men  
move ahead toward the more  
complex modes of thought. Of  
importance, it has been found  
that no difference in moral  
maturity exists between the  
sexes until adolescence, at  
which time girls plateau in  
psychological growth while  
boys continue the movement to-  
ward higher stages.

Dr. Erickson said several  
studies demonstrate that  
girls "sell out" their com-  
petency motivation sometime  
in high school and get an-  
chored in a lifestyle that re-  
inforces the middle stages of  
growth, the social compromise  
stage. The theories acknowledge  
this inconsistency will lead to an  
erosion of women's maturity, and the  
research bears this out.

"We've talked about it so  
long, now we must do some-  
thing about it!" is Erick-  
son's position.

The curriculum model devel-  
oped by Erickson used a "Lea-  
rning Psychology by doing  
psychology" format first set  
forth by John Dewey. Field  
interviewing of girls and wo-  
men across the life span pro-  
vided a means of viewing the  
process of female development  
through different ages, sta-  
ges, and tasks. In the sen-  
inar sessions the high school  
women reflected about and in-  
tegrated their interview data  
and also focused on current  
articles on the women's move-  
ment and related literary wo-  
works. A continuous thru-way  
focus was maintained between  
the interview experiences,  
the works of literature, and  
the examination of "the  
self." Multiple assessments  
were run on the class and  
ego maturity and on the Kohl-  
berg measure of moral maturi-  
ty.

This curriculum is the  
first in a series of classes  
being developed to examine  
sex roles and personal growth.  
A two-person relationship  
class and a parenting class  
(both with males) are now be-  
ing piloted and researched.
