Feminist Librarian Rescues

Scarlett --- Portnoy Tags Along

When Barb Caron began her
job as the librarian in the
Alexandria, Minnesota public
library, she found that books
like Portnoy's Complaint,
Black Like Me, yoga and health
books were kept behind the
counter, and Gone with the
Wind could not be checked out
by anyone under 18.

Today, a year later, those
books are out on the shelf,
along with such books as
Sisterhood is Powerful, Women
and Madness, and William's
Doll.

Expansion and Outreach

Barb, who graduated in 1972
from the College of St. Cath-
erine, has revitalized the
library physically as well as
ordering new books. Along
with a progressive Library
Board, she has ordered new
carpeting, shrubs, and paint.

She has also expanded the
library's services. She is

beginning an Outreach program

involving all of Douglas
County. She reviews books on
television, radio, and in

the local newspaper.

Her influence extends to
other aspects of the commun-
ity, where they welcome her
fresh approach. She address-
es women's and men's clubs on
library matters and women's
issues. Recently, the Alex-
andria Business and Profes-
sional Women's Club chose her
as their candidate for Young
Woman of the Year.

Strange Feminist

One of her favorite activi-
ties was an adult education
class on women called "You've
Come a Long Way, Baby!" which
she taught to eight women.

The class brought together
isolated women with little

in common but their dissat-
isfaction. Among them were
a high school student (her
friends think she's "strange"
for being a feminist), a for-

Barb Caron (R.) with friend,
Wendy Wallace (L.).

Solid Friends

After the course was over,
the women decided to keep
meeting as a consciousness-
raising group. They have
since formed solid friend-
ships and "helped each other
through rough spots." Barb
says the group “made me more
comfortable with myself and
gave me reinforcement." The
group is now thinking of
forming a speakers bureau.

Barb has been introducing
feminism to almost everyone
in Alexandria. She teaches
a mini-course in cooking to
eight students from the local
grade school. The course
was open to everyone, but
boys were the only ones who
signed up!

Jeannette Rankin Led Feminist Struggle—
Stood Alone in Opposition to War

Jeannette Rankin, the na-
tion's first Congresswoman
and a feminist and peace act-
ivist, died last month at

her home in California. She
was 92.

It was during her first
House term that Rankin, then
36, worked for approval of
the 19th Amendment, which ex-
tended electoral suffrage to
women. She had led the fe-
male suffrage struggle in
her own state of Montana be-
fore her election to nation-
al office.

Although an active feminist,
Rankin was most noted in re-
cent years for her outspoken
opposition to war. She stood
opposed to the U.S. entry in-
to World War I. She also
voted against U.S. entry into
the Second World War—the
only member of Congress to do
so at a time when emotional
reaction to the Japanese
bombing of Pearl Harbor ran
high. “Her conscience is her
weakness," lamented her bro-
ther Wingate, a Montana law-
yer.

Rankin, ousted from her
congressional seat in 1943,
became a leader in peace so-
cieties. "To me," she said,
"it isn't this war or that
war. It's the war system.
We've never settled any dis-
pute by fighting."

The next "Gold Flower"
meeting will be Monday, June
25 at 7:30 p.m. in the Wom-
en's Counseling Service at
621 Lake St. Anyone inter-
ested in writing or any as-
pect of the Women's Movement
