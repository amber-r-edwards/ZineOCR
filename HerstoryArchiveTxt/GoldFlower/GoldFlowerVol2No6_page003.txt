DULUTH WOMEN

by Pat Monaghan

Down the alley behind the  
Duluth YWCA, there is a small  
building—no more seedy-look-  
ing than most in that time-  
worn neighborhood—with a  
barn-red door.

Inside, stairs lead to an  
airy office and lounge. The  
freshly-painted walls are  
still bare; a desk, several  
chairs and a few bookshelves  
are scattered across the  
wooden floor. The high win-  
dows look over grey downtown  
Duluth to the historic aerial  
bridge.

Because Duluth is a city  
where I spent some important  
years, and because I still  
have a sore spot in my heart  
for that unfashionable old  
city, my curiosity had been  
piqued when a friend (dis-  
dainfully noting that she  
"didn't need that sort of  
stuff") told me that Duluth  
had a struggling women's cen-  
ter. So on my next northern  
visit I located the center  
and its coordinator, Kay  
Slick.

She began apologetically,  
explaining that things had  
"just been a mudpie" all sum-  
mer, and that the center was  
just beginning its fall pro-  
gramming. At her office in  
a corner of the center's  
front room—the rest is work-  
space and a rudimentary li-  
brary—Kay described the  
center's history and plans  
for the public opening next  
month.

It has been nearly two  
years since Duluth women  
first recognized a need for  
a women's center, Kay related.  
The idea was tossed around by  
local women’s groups and  

concerned individuals; a  
successful women's confer-  
ence last year gave added  
impetus to the proposal.  
Then, last year, activist  
Kris Nelson began organi-  
zing the center through EPI  
EPIC (Educational Project  
Involving Consumers), a fed-  
erally-funded program oper-  
ating out of the Duluth med-  
ical school. When Kris left  
EPIC, Kay took over the po-  
sition and continued agita-  
ting for a center.

Last spring the YWCA of-  
fered use of the roomy but  
run-down Decker Building on  
a rent-free basis for a year,  
with rent to be negotiated  
thereafter. The building  
seemed too big for the pro-  
posed center, but another  
group volunteered to use the  
downstairs for a day-care  
center, and the Duluth Wo-  
men's Center became a tan-  
gible reality.

Repairs—originally esti-  
mated at nearly $1600 for  
materials and labor—were  
executed at enormous saving  
by Duluth women who sanded  
floors, painted and other-  
wise assisted the renovation  
effort. Since that flurry  
of activity, however, the  
center has been struggling.

"I wouldn't say there's a  
high feminist consciousness  
in Duluth," said Kay Slick  
wearily. "There's a need for  
advocacy, a need for rape  
counseling, a need for var-  
ious referrals. But there's  

nothing here yet that women  
can identify with as a wo-  
man's thing."

Kay sees the Duluth Wo-  
men's Center as offering “an  
alternative to women who  
see themselves as being  
locked in" to traditional  
female roles, but admitted  
"it's hard to reach those  
women—they're still afraid  
to come here."

To Kay, part of the prob-  
lem in generating support is  
"the exceptional woman thing.  
I know a lot of women who are  
personally strong, but they  
don't see themselves as need-  
ing the center." Nonetheless  
she feels that “the city does  
need a women's center. We  
just don't know who the wo-  
men are that need us, or wh  
where they are."

Projects begun by the cen-  
ter, in addition to con-  
sciousness-raising sessions  
and related groups, include a  
weekly radio program, a dance  
class, and an ad hoc referral  
service for lawyers and doc-  
tors.

Kay described abortion  
counseling as "shallow,  
fragmented and underground”  
in Duluth, pointing out that  
only one abortion had been  
performed there since the Su-

preme Court ruling last win-  
ter. Duluth women must seek  
abortions in the Twin Cities  
area; younger women have dif-  
ficulty finding birth con-  
trol services as well.

Kay Slick feels isolated,  
"bleak but not really dis-  
couraged," she explained.  
"Women here still see the  
women's movement as being  
external to their lives. Right  
now we're still really into a  
self thing, heavy self-exam-  
ination, thinking about how  
being a woman is affecting  
our lives. But we need the  
women's center, even if its  
function is confined entirely  
to offering personal support."
