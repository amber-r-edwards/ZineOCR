First of Two Parts

Ten per cent of Minnesota
women belong to one of the
most unprotected minorities
in the state. Ten per cent
is the amount of Minnesota
women who are lesbians, esti-
mates Karen Browne, founder
of the Lesbian Resource Cen-
ter, 710 W. 22nd St., Minnea-
polis.

Lesbians are doubly defined
as "second-class citizens" by
society because they are wom-
en and because they prefer
members of their own sex.

Historically, lesbians have
been condemned by law in ev-
ery state. Descriptions of
homosexuality as "lewd and
lascivious behavior" and "a
crime against nature" are
used by several states in
their statutes. If female,
as well as male, homosexuals
aren't specified by some
states' laws, it has been be-
cause females were considered
less important socially.

In Minnesota, terms against
homosexuality aren't quite so
harsh but the lack of civil
rights for gays is the same.

Legislature Says ‘No’

In May, in the final
squeeze of the state's leg-
islative session, a confer-
ence committee from both
houses rejected a provision
to the Human Rights Act pro-
hibiting discrimination in
employment to homosexuals.

The gay provision, which
was introduced by Sen. Nick
Coleman, had passed earlier
in the Senate. Coleman's
original proposal, which
passed in the Senate's Sub-
Committee on Judicial Admin-
istration in mid-April and
the Senate Judiciary Commit-
tee a few weeks later also
protected gays in housing.

The gay provision itself
was an amendment to a broader
bill drafted by Sam Richard-
son, State Commissioner of
Human Rights.

Richardson's original draft
did finally pass through the
conference committee. It
prohibits discrimination in
the areas of housing, employ-
ment, education and public
services because of marital
status, physical or mental
disability, or status as a
welfare recipient.

No other state has passed
civil rights legislation for
gays. However, in New York
City an executive order was
issued forbidding discrimina-
tion against gays in govern-
ment employment. An Ann Ar-
bor, Michigan executive order

expanded the prohibition to
private employers.

In the Minnesota House,
gays have suffered defeat
this session in another piece
of legislation. The "Sodomy
Bill" would have legalized
homosexuality among consent-
ing adults. But Steve
Endean, lobbyist for the
Minnesota Civil Liberties
Union (MCLU) believes that
the defeat is just temporary
and that the bill will be
brought up again when the
legislature re-convenes next
January.

If the "Sodomy Bill" ever
becomes law, Minnesota will
join only seven other states
which have similar legisla-
tion.

Illinois pioneered legisla-
tive acceptance of homosexua-
lity between consenting
adults in 1961. Connecticut,
Colorado, Delaware, Ohio and
Hawaii all approved similar
legislation within the last
one and one-half years.

In Florida and Washington
D.C. restrictive laws simi-
lar to the present Minnesota
law were thrown out by the
courts as unconstitutional.

Mike Weatherbee, co-ordina-
tor of MCLU and Browne
acknowledge the importance of
the Human Rights Amendment as
a legal precedent.

The only national basis for
civil rights now is the 14th
Amendment to the US Constitu-
tion which prevents the gov-
ernment from discriminating

unless there's a rational rea-

son. "Housing isn't a case
here, though, because most of
it is privately owned. And
the amendment doesn't protect
against private employers,
either," Weatherbee pointed
out.

Because of the lack of
jurisdiction, no cases have
ever been brought against a
private employer or landlord
in Minnesota. "We (the MCLU)
frequently have to turn down
cases because there is no
law," said Weatherbee.

Landlords Discriminate

There are many cases in
Minneapolis where landlords
and employers have discrimin-
ated against lesbians, how-
ever.

Browne and her roommate,
Cindy Hanson, a former direc-
tor of Gay House and founder
of Gay Community Services
spent two months trying to
find an apartment. But after
each landlord asked where the
women worked, Browne and Han-
son were always turned down.

“Finally, we just told a
landlord that we worked in a
‘straight’ place and we got

an apartment," said Browne.

For the professional woman,
a major problem is hiding the
fact that she is a lesbian.

Helen Livingston teaches
first grade in a Catholic
grade school. Because of the
small size of the faculty,
she finally felt that she
couldn't keep her lesbianism
a secret anymore.

The school didn't fire her
directly but "ambiguously"
refused to renew her contract
for next year because of
“conflicting philosophies."

"Professional women who
come into contact with people
more than factory workers are
more likely to get fired,"
said Livingston.

Organized religion, espec-
ially the Catholic Church,
remains one of the main ob-
stacles to lesbians. Tradi-
tionally, religion has con-
demned everything but pro-
creative sex. Anything else
was "sinful" and "perverse."

But some branches of Pro-
testantism are changing.
Browne notes that a few city
churches are helping to fund
the Lesbian Resource Center.
(Other funds come from priv-
ate foundations and personal
contributions.)

Religion and government are
the main institutions which
prolong basic societal beliefs
against homosexuality. Even
if a lesbian can overcome the
religious obstacle by removing
herself directly from the
church, there are always more
concrete and visible barriers
within the government.

Government Says ‘No’

According to a 1969 issue of
Humanist magazine, "Federal
government serves to set the
tone and example of the syste-
matic exclusion of this sig-
nificantly large minority of
its citizens from full parti-
cipation in the society in
which they live, and their
systematic relegation to sec-
ond class citizens."

The "significantly large
minority" of lesbians in the
country is about 10 million,
estimate Del Martin and Phyl-
lis Lyon, co-founders of the
national lesbian organization,
Daughters of Bilitis.

The federal government's
disapproval of lesbianism is
expressed mainly in the civil
service.

The government still treats
homosexuality as an emotional
disturbance and emphasizes
psychoanalysis as a "cure."

“Homosexuality has been de-
fined into a sickness or dis-
order through subjective, per-
sonal, social, moral, cultur-
al and religious value judge-

No One

ments...the ones who accuse
don't do adequate scientific
study to validate what they
say," states the Humanist
article.

However, the Kinsey report
on Sexual Behavior in the
Human Female documents studies
of both sexes substantiating
that homosexuality is not a
"sickness" but a "preference."

The civil service prejudice
is stated in its list of gen-
eral qualifications. "Persons
about whom there is evidence
that they have engaged in...
homosexual...acts, without
evidence of rehabilitation,
are not suitable for Federal
employment." This rule is
without regard for the per-
son's individual qualifica-
tions for the job.

Stemming largely from the
McCarthy period of the 1950's,
the civil service's opinion
is that homosexuals will have
a "disrupting effect upon the
morale and efficiency of any
organization." Yet the rela-
tion between a worker's off-
the-job behavior and her on-
the-job efficiency is never
explained.

There is an obvious incon-
gruence in the government's
position. While civil service
is fearful of placing a homo-
sexual in an office of hetero-
sexuals, "The government
wouldn't hesitate to put a
Negro in an office of racists
or a Jew in an office of anti-
Semites," concludes the Huma-
nist article.

Currently, the government
is able to fire workers
because in the government's
definition, homosexuality is
a "rational basis" for firing,
said Weatherbee.

Again, the professional

lesbians are the ones most
affected by this policy.
This includes teachers, women
in the medical profession and
any other profession licensed
by the state.

The Human Rights amendment
could locally challenge gov-
ernmental hiring practices.

Courts Say ‘Maybe’

Discrimination in housing
and employment are problems
faced by both lesbians and
male homosexuals. Yet, gay
women are faced with another
legal problem--of having to
prove that they are "fit"
mothers.

Weatherbee said that there
have been several MCLU cases
where an ex-husband or rela-
tive has tried to get the
children taken away from
their lesbian mother.

Browne explained the only
"semi-victory" in the nation

(continued on page 4)

people change, you told me
and it isn't right for us

to stay in each other's arms
there is more for each of us
somewhere else

we will be stronger apart

we will find new energies
and I say I understand

we have gone through our
changes

I hate that word

I let you pack

we laugh, we are happy

for what has passed between
us and we have shared love
and I say I understand

it is not good to be together
if we need someone else
someone new and different
yet that night I reach across the
emptiness searching for your
warmth and I am cold and
alone

I scream and no one hears me
those screams in the night
that no one ever hears
