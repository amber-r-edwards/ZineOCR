How to Have Intercourse
Without Getting Screwed,
A Guide to Birth Control,
Abortion, and Venereal
Disease was published
by the ASUW Women's
Commission in January
1972. The second
printing was funded by
the Graduate and Pro-
fessional Student Sen-
ate and by the Associat-
ed Students of the Uni-
versity of Washington.
The booklet is dedi-
cated to those individ-
uals whose own dedica-
tion ensured the pass-

age of abortion reform
in Washington State, and
especially to Dr. A.
Frans Koome for his
courage both before
and after the victory
of Referendum 20.
Since the authors of
the booklet (Lynn K.
Hansen, Barbara Reskin,
Diana Gray) have not
been trained in medi-
cine, they have drawn
upon the generous con-
tributions of knowledge
by members of Seattle's
medical community.
Special thanks go to
Dr. Elaine Henley, who
read the manuscript
several times and pro-
vided both technical
advice and moral sup-
port. Lee Minto, di-
rector of Planned Par-
enthood, Dr. Gordon
Bergy, University of
Washington Health Ser-
vice, and Dr. A. Frans
Koome were also kind
enough to read the
manuscript and to make
helpful suggestions.
Others who provided
factual or editorial
contributions includ-
ed Dr. Julius Butler,
Dr. J. H. Leversee,
Jeanne Mannegold, and
Jan Krause of the
Abortion Referral Ser-
vice, and Julie Cor-
yell, Elaine Schroe-
der, and Verna Smith.

Introduction

This booklet was written
to help women and men deal
with the consequences of sex-
ual activity. Too often,
lack of knowledge about help
that is available and about
how to get that help makes
sexual relations a cause for
anxiety and tension. When
the persons involved are un-
married, their problem be-
comes even worse: Even if
they have the guts to put up
with humiliations and moral-
izing, they may be denied
contraceptive help. This
booklet is an attempt to fill
that need. Its first goal
is to give general informa-
tion about conception, con-
traception, abortion, and
venereal disease. A second,
and very important, goal is
to make known to the reader
the agencies and services in
the Seattle area to which
people can turn for help
without getting any hassle
about their morals or activi-
ties.

If there is a more specific
purpose to the writing of
this booklet, it is to let
women know that in their
search for help they do not
have to put up with the va-
garies of private physicians.
There are community services
that regard contraceptive
assistance as a right of all
women (regardless of age or
marital status). For too
long, women have been at the
mercy of the private physi-
cians' monopoly of contra-
ceptive technology, a mono-
poly that has been accompan-
ied by a moral tyranny that
has denied medical care to
large subgroups of women.
The authors believe that wo-
men have the right to know
about the kinds of assistance
that are available for con-
trolling conception and
birth, and they believe that
women have the right to have
access to this technology.
One purpose of this booklet
is to give women the infor-
mation they need, so that
they can demand and obtain
the kind of contraceptive
care they want.

Anatomy

Female

The external female sexual
parts are referred to col-
lectively as the vulva. It
includes the labia majora and
the labia minora, as well as
the clitoris, an organ homo-
logous to the male penis and
the source of sexual plea-
sure in the female. The en-
trance to the vagina may be
partially covered by a mem-
brane, the hymen or "maiden-
head." This will tear dur-
ing first sexual intercourse,
or it may have been broken
previously by the use of tam-
pons or for some other rea-
son. In an exceptional case,
the hymen may be too thick
to be opened without the aid
of a physician. The vagina,
or birth canal, is the or-
gan of sexual intercourse,
accepting the male penis and
the ejaculated semen. The
vagina extends from the hy-
men to a point past the cer-
vix, or opening of the uter-
us. It is extremely elastic
and will expand when the fe-
male is sexually stimulated.
The vaginal tissues are lub-
ricated by secretions from
glands located in the neck
of the uterus and at the
opening of the vulva. These
secretions aid in the ease
of entry of the penis into
the vagina during inter-
course.

The uterus, also referred
to as the womb, is the mus-
cular organ in which the fe-
tus develops. In the upper
part of the uterus is an
opening to ducts called the
fallopian tubes. The tubes,
called oviducts, conduct the
ovum or egg, from the ovaries
to the uterus. A female has
two ovaries, each of which
contains thousands of imma-
ture ova present since birth.
Once a month, usually, one
ovum is brought to maturity
and travels from the ovary
to the uterus. If the egg is
not fertilized within a per-
iod of from twenty-four to
seventy-two hours, it disin-
tegrates, and about fourteen
days later menses begins.
