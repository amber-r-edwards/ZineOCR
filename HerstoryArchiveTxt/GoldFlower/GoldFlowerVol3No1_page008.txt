BLACKWELL FORMS TASK FORCE

On April 2 a new task force of the Elizabeth  
Blackwell Women's Health Center, which is a  
women's health collective dealing mainly  
with educating women through self-help, lo-  
cated in the People's Center, was formed.  
This newly-organized task force is a patient  
advocacy and referral group.

A patient advocate for women is defined as a  
woman willing to accompany another woman to  
a health care facility in order to give her  
support. The group sees itself as mainly  
existing for being advocates for general ex-  
aminations and operations that are minor,  
such as menstrual extractions and vacuum  
aspirator-type abortions, at the moment.  
However, this will be extended as the group  
gains more experience.

Besides patient advocacy, the group is going  
to compile a complete list of referrals for  

the Women's Health Center, listing area doc-  
tors. By doing this, the group hopes to

supply women with more and better options  
and overall health care. At the moment, the  
are getting together an attitudinal form to  
distribute to the consumers or the patients  
on the quality of treatment they have re-  
ceived.

What is hoped will come out of this is a  
book in which is listed every doctor in the  
metropolitan area. It would also help to  
insure consumer control. The group has been  
contacting the doctors' offices by phone  

as to what their prices and attitudes are,  
what birth control methods they recommend,  
etc. This has not met with a favorable re-  
sponse, and, in some cases, the doctors are  
paranoid about the survey.

Coming out of this would also be patient  
rights. That is, watching legislation rela-  
ting to women's health needs and the bills  
concerning their rights.
