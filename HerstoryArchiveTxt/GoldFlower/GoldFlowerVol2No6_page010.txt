THE Très Riches Heures  
—— WAMPL  

A house stands  

in the middle of the prairie.  
Inside a woman sits  

with a sewing basket  

piled with dreams  

which are not wishes.  

These are the actual dreams,  
full of spinsters  

who cover their new pale shoes  
carefully with Kleenex,  

where inappropriate women sit  
before things called "hearths."  
Do they know where they are?  
They keep saying,  

"This is a museum. Be afraid."  

I am thinking of a time  
when all the parts of a life  
were balanced like animals  
with their perfect tails.  

My father's greenhouse:  

Go play in the palm house  
till I call you for dinner.  

In the basement  

of girlhood failures  

you slept in the furnace music,  
your home regardless  

of the fights upstairs;  

you always went there  

when its summer musk  

began--  

it made you ache in the corners  
and think of spiders,  

how dark-haired men might wait  
to bite your lips.  

The voices  

were kept from you by the wind;  
the blue, cool room  

led you out of that small town's  
indolent eyes  

to the lake and the thin hoot  

of summer owls, how clouds  

like the hair of seraphic runners  
grazed the mountains.  

And you prepared in those years  
with deep blood in the face  

for love, for summer, for legends  
of heroes always entering  

without speech  

under cover of the dark.  

Wedding palms, rented for weddings  

were also funeral palms,  

rented for funerals.  

This is where, in the dark tubs,  

cats and field rabbits came  

to give birth to their wet, unfinished babies;  
where, in the midst of her most coiled fantasy,  
the most personal story of jungle life,  

the little girl was also thinking happily:  

Call me home,  

call me home for dinner.  

A jungle slowly flattens itself  
until you realize  

it is a prairie where you live  
and what grows here is  

fields of sameness,  

acres of calm,  

a beauty so unfantastic  

you are relaxed into the plains,  
the memories.  

The woman sits in the pine board house.  

If even she is nervous,  

her lip gnawed ragged,  

proof of her imperfect adultness,  

remember she has also before her  

for consolation  

the present moment  

like an illuminated manuscript  

bright with tendrils of memory and future.  
This balancing tail may help her  

reach the hours she is trying to get back to,  
back to the possibility of saying,  

Mother, Father,  
You did not stop me.  

The difference is only in time  

and games,  
breathing city nights,  
stilling any need for others  

in a myth of freedom  

I dream in summers.  

Today in the biting cold and swollen  
from a night of close calls  

I remember how it was to ride the bus  
knowing that the love we seldom made  
still sewed the days together.  

AFTER MAKING LOVE WITH CLOSED EYES  

Sweat dries on my arms,  

I lie across the arctic bed,  
away from you sleeping,  

your disconcerting  

black, seal-fur thighs;  

how they slid, arched, then posed  
above me  

in sleek and untamable power  
before knifing through  

what I made to seem  

like a froth of ice and burning  
gasoline below you.  

Yet, there was no dinner for you.  

And no invader near  

to drive you harder with fearful lust.  
Don't ask me what it was--  

too quick, or late, not a hunting  
season. Or that  

I assumed the character  

of northern water.
