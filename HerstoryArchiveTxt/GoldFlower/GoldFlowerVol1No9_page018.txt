THE  
WOMEN'S FILM  

but what the image is. Eight  
of the films are from this  
year's New York Women's Film  
Festival. Others were en-  
tries in other years. One  

of the films, a short, was  
made by the Minneapolis film-  
maker Susan Kraning.  

There is no reason why  
films made by women have to  
be categorized as such, ex-  
cept that for right now, if  
women won't band together to  
publicize their work, to sup-  
port and exchange ideas with  
one another, to pressure the  
film industry into trusting  
and respecting their talent  
--who will? It is my hope  
that this mini Minneapolis  
film festival will stimulate  
not only feminists', but also  
the general public's appetite  
for more women's films to  
come, that it will encourage  
other commercial theatres to  
discover the feminist aesthe-  
tic and that ultimately the  
film industry will abandon  
all of those horrible stereo-  

types of us. This series is  
a test. Personally, I am on-  

ly interested in breaking  
even in this venture...just  
so that I can show my male  
partners that a women's  
series is NOT risky business.  
I am more than willing to  
turn over any profit to a  
women's group or better yet  
have the money go to setting  
up a women's theatre. These  
are just a few possibilities.  
For more information, call  
me.

I went to my local book-  
store the other day, looking  
for something inspiring to  
read. I passed the shelves  
of Hemingway, Faulkner, F.  
Scott Fitzgerald, Steinbeck,  
yet nothing seemed interest-  
ing. Where, I wondered,  
could I get something written  
by women, movement-conscious  
women? I asked the clerk,  
but all I got was a blank  
look; evidently, he had never  

heard of the movement, let  
alone movement-conscious  
writers. I eventually found  
a small selection, under  
Sociology, of movement books,  
Sisterhood is Powerful, The  
Female Eunuch, The Second  
Sex, The Feminine Mystique.  

I had read parts of The Sec-  
ond Sex, but I was interested  
in current fiction -- easy  
stuff.  

THEN I heard about the Am-  
azon Bookstore. I felt a  
little embarrassed, just  
thinking about the name, but  
I summoned my courage (after  
all, I hadn't chosen the  
name), and found my way to  
3240 Cedar Ave. South. A big  
sign on the house read AMAZON  
BOOKSTORE - FEMINIST LITERA-  
TURE. I was lucky; the store  
had just reopened after being  
closed for the summer.  

Inside, I browsed through  
issues of Aphra, Women-a  
journal of Up From Under,  
No More Fun and Games. I  
couldn't decide where to start,  
I was so excited. There was a  
whole shelf of books for just  
biography and autobiography,  
another for fiction. There  
was a table of children's  
books--books where little  
girls are doctors, where  
little boys do the cooking  
with their father. There  
were newspapers (several  
from Lesbian collectives),  
anthologies, too much to  
remember--so I secured an  
annotated bibliography.  

There was also a table of  
back issues and miscellan-  
eous publications--a library  
in a way--and a couch to read  
on. "Joy of Cooking,” Tracy  
Nelson, Buffy St. Marie played  
on the record player.  

The only thing missing was  
coffee. They don't serve  
coffee "because," they said,  
“coffee is an addictive stim-  
ulant." So is their litera-  
ture, I thought, but kept  
silent.
