The Politics of Abortion

By Mary Retsinas

I am respectfully compelled
to answer Jan Jirak’s arti-
cle. To begin with, we do
not hate men. That is a slan-
der that has been used against
the women's movement since
the year one. It has been
used to scare women away from
the women's movement and away
from fulfilling themselves,
because by so doing they are,
by definition, a threat to
men. We do not hate men. We
love our sisters, and hate the
oppression of women. If
hatred happens to be a part of
our collective personality,
we must not forget that hatred
is one facet of a healthy per-
sonality. It is when hatred
is inappropriate to the situa-
tion that it becomes unhealthy.
It is a common phenomenon
among oppressed peoples to
find members turning on one
another in response to exter-
nal frustration, instead of
directing the resulting hatred
constructively against the
source of the oppression.
Women must strive to overcome
this tendency, because what-
ever political direction we
take, it will be too important
to be frittered away in self-
hatred. It is quite falla-
cious to say ‘people who hate
find their ability to love
atrophied.' Please; let's be
honest. Human love is very
freely mixed with hatred.

The 'Women Hate' point is a

very weak and paranoid one,

and it is used to reinforce

the other point: that abor-
tion is murder.

The only alternatives offered
are the pill, vasectomy,
condom, and advice that can
only be offered in indiffer-
ence or ignorance. There is
NO completely effective, re-
versible, safe means of con-
traception. The side effects
of the birth control pill are
well known, and they are side

A House of

A group of women is establish-
ing a Women's House in St. Paul
for both temporary housing and
for social and cultural activi-
ties.

The Women's House will be a
place where Twin Cities women
and their children can stay
during critical periods. As a
social and cultural center the
house will provide space for
meetings, classes, child care,
a women's library, small dis-
cussions and a "room of one's

own."

The project is sponsored by
Women's Advocates, which also
sponsors a telephone service

effects that do kill and crip-
ple women. Furthermore, the
pill is not completely effec-
tive. The failure rate is
given at between one and five
percent. If it is one per-
cent, then of the eight and a
half million women taking the
pill, eighty-five thousand
will suffer an unwanted preg-
nancy. Must they be forced

to go through with it? Must
any woman be forced? Who,
after all, is more fit to de-
cide whether or not any woman
has the money, the energy, the
time to undergo pregnancy?
Marjorie Mecklenberg or presi-
dent what's-his-name? Paul
Ehrlich or the pope? The Min-
nesota state legislature?
Certainly not. The person

who is the most qualified to

decide is the woman herself,
because it is she who makes
the sacrifices.

‘Population control is es-
sential,' the article says.
But population control is not
the issue at all. "Popula-
tion control" is something
practiced by power-trippers
who get a kick out of mani-
pulating others. Population
control is what happened when
the Pill was originally ex-
perimented with, with Puerto
Rican women used as guinea
pigs. Population control is
what happens when black women
and women on welfare are
sterilized without their know-
ledge or consent. Population
control is what's happening
now in Southeast Asia, where
they're trying out a risky
birth control injection.
Population control is also
genocide, and we deplore it
and want no part of it. What
we want is for people to be
able to control their own
bodies and lives, which might
wind up being to the disad-
vantage of those who have
taken the decision away, and
want to control their stock-
pile of cannon fodder.

You're damned right ‘rich,
white establishment males use
the abortion issue to keep
women down.' If we had the

means to control our own
bodies, this would have all
kinds of repercussions with
our psyches and with society.
If women were not constantly
tormented by the fear of un-
wanted pregnancy, there could
be no keeping us down.

Of course a fetus has life,
but then, so do carrots and
frogs, and so, at one time,
did the hamburger you ate for
lunch. Nobody calls them
"human." There are those who
feel that fetal life is human
life, and their opinion is to
be respected in a democratic
fashion, but this minority
has no right to impose its
will on the majority. No one
should be forced into an abor-
tion, nor should be forced
out of it. The decision must
be the responsibility of the
individual woman.

There is a final reality
that must be faced: the
reality of the deaths of
hundreds of thousands of
women each year at the hands
of illegal abortionists under
conditions that are shocking
and humiliating and filthy
and inhumane. Also not to be
forgotten are the thousands
of unwanted children whose
parents torture them: starve
them, break their bones, burn
them with cigarette butts,
hold them in boiling water.
Both are forms of human misery
that could be largely eradi-
cated by safe, legal abortion.

In early March the Women's
National Abortion Action
Coalition will hold an inter-
national tribunal on the sub-
ject of abortion, contracep-
tion, and forced steriliza-
tion. Women who have had
abortions or have been forci-
bly sterilized are urged to

testify. All are welcome to
attend. Simone de Beauvoir,
herself guilty of controlling

her own body, will be chair-
person. Cheap transportation

will be provided. For more
information, phone MWAAC at

Ms. Jirak says:
"I agree totally with Ms.
Retsinas' comments about
man-hating. My remarks
were directed to a very
small minority and were
meant as a cautionary note
against the dangers of ex-
cessive bitterness and cul-
tivated hatred. I apologize
for not expressing that more
clearly.

I also agree that all peo-
ple should control their own
bodies. That is why I can't
agree with abortion (as much
as that would simplify
life): abortion denies the
child all control over her
(or his) own body."
