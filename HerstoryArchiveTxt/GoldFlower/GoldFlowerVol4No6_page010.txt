I have loved of creation  

baby rabbits and nurtured at

helpless as they,

and little pigeons  

pecking at the shell, me verily  

instinctively seeking: and I have answered screams  

release from sources  

from their egg cell fanciful and real  

and tender shoots against the shadows  

of new flowers of the night  

answering Spring's 7: 5 and I have known

and I have watched them grow and sometimes kneel  

awkward gangly youth  

them die  

with pimpled face  

and tearful tones and I have loved in cycles  

as I grew  

made gentle and unknowing  

both giving and receiving

and playful pups with all at my side.  

in patterns repetitious  

who yapped their  

pleasured greeting throughout time  

and brand new bikes And who will watch me grow and who will hold my hand  

that never knew a scratch while I am dying?  

and books that  

had beginnings middles ends  

with reasons sure  

and I have watched them grow and sometimes helped  

them die  
I have loved  

life growing in me  
and cherished  

the hope of its  

unaltered newness
