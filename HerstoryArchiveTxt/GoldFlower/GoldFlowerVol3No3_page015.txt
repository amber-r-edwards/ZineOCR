AND THAT’S THE WAY

WOMAN’S TV IMAGE

The Sacramento Branch of

the American Association of
University Women recently
published a survey, "The Im-
age of Women in Television."

Results of the month-long study
of television news programs
and commercials show that
television news generally
projects two stereotyped im-
ages of women: helpless vic-
tims of kidnaps, rapes, mur-
ders and natural disasters...
or as opinionless, supportive
wives and mothers.

Other findings reveal:

Even more serious than
stereotyping is the virtual
omission of women from tele-
vision news. Out of 5,353
straight news stories moni-
tored on 221.5 hours of pro-
gramming, less than 10% (532)
were about women. Among
1,668 news features, only 273
dealt with women.

One monitor commented, "Af-
ter watching television news
for awhile, you get the feel-
ing that women just don't ex-
ist."

Television commercials
exhibit far more offensive
sexist bias than news
programs. With few excep-

tions, women were stereotyped

as half-witted consumers, in-
terested only in cooking,
cleaning, washing and serv-
ing men and children...or as
self-centered sex objects
eager to please men by us-
ing sprays, bath oils, hair
tints, hosiery, cosmetics,
creams and powders.

The survey involved 51 mon-
itors, all Sacramento AAUW
members, who were assigned
to every news program, every
day, on the three Sacramen-
to stations with network
affiliations.

At least one monitor was
at work by 5:55 a.m., watch-
ing Channel 13's "Morning
Headlines." Others were
assigned programs throughout
the day and evening, until
the night-owl watch on
11 p.m. and midnight news
summaries.

The monitors recorded their
findings on standardized
forms, using committee de-
fined criteria for what con-
stituted sexist bias. They
made notes on their conclu-
sions, filled out sheets for
every program monitored, and
then sent their results to
a committee which compiled
totals and wrote a final re-
port.

"We had three goals in mind,"

said Betty Wisham, chair-
woman for the AAUW media
study topic which guided the
survey.

"First, we wanted to make
our members more aware of
television's impact on the
image of women. Second, we
plan to present any findings
of bias to the local sta-
tions, their networks and to
the Federal Communications
Commission which licenses
all stations.

"And finally, we hope to
lay the groundwork for sim-
ilar studies in other cities
by publishing the study.

We believe that the image of
women as projected in tel-
evision bears little rela-
tionship to the realities of
women in today's world. We
feel this can and must be
changed."
