WOMEN'S NETWORK

Women's Network is having an open house to celebrate
our new location at 425 Lake Street on June 21 from
5-10 p.m. The network is working to build a communi-
cations network among all Twin Cities women's groups.

We'll be moving to the Lake Street address on June 11
and hope to have a telephone installed soon.

The first Network project will be a city-wide direct-
ory of women's organizations and services, similar to
the Boston Women's Yellow Pages. There's a lot of
excitement about this project in the Network; volun-
teers can join in on any level of research or writing
of the directory. To volunteer or give info, call
Mary Jane Twohy at 874-9175 or Linda Devoy at 422-2730.

Other Network news: We've gotten non-profit status;
we've decided to hire a person to coordinate the dir-
ectory, which brings the printing goal much closer;
we've asked Mary Jane Twohy and Linda Devoy to facil-
itate the Coordinating Committee; and we've been
working every Monday and Thursday night on the direct-
ory -- again, help is needed!

The open house will be a benefit and welcoming to our
new home. There will be food and wine and entertain-
ment, including Women Poets of the Twin Cities, and
at least a couple of other performing groups, such as
Circle of the Witch and the Film Collective. All
women are welcome -- to find out what we're doing and
what we hope to do to link together the amorphous but
strengthening and growing women's movement. We all
have so much to offer each other, of experience,
skills, and common goals. Let's begin to trade our
stories and see how strong we've grown.
