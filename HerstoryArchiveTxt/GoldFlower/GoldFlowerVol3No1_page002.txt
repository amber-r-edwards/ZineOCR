A residential street, a  
house screened by pine trees,  
a pleasantly decorated blue  
and white living room, femin-  
ist posters on the walls; I  
am immediately suspicious.  
I'm not supposed to feel at  
ease in an employment agency.  

The goals of Feminist For-  
mations are as disconcerting-  
ly healthy as their environ-  
ment. Their standards demand  
that they place skilled women  
in non-traditional, enjoyable  
temporary jobs that pay well.  
Too often, the three founders  
/counselors say, employment  
agencies push a person into  
any job at any pay scale.  
Rarely do they find a suita-  
ble position for an individu-  
al. Lynn McGuigan says they  
hope to place a woman in a  
job where "her potential will  
come out, not be stashed  
away."  

In order to do that, they  
must first ascertain what a  
woman's potentials are. They  
find that women often have a-  
bilities they don't know they  
have or experience that  
they undervalue. This is es-  
pecially true of women return-  
ing to the workforce after  
raising a family. A woman may  
not realize the validity of,  
for example, her community or-  
ganizing experience. She may  
be diffident about "selling  
herself." Feminist Forma-  
tions, as a go-between with  
the employer, can "sell" the  
employee, presenting her in a  
positive manner. "We don't  
have to tell the employer she  
did it without pay," says  
Carol Lee. They can play up  
her qualifications.  

WHAT’S IN A NAME?  

Once they determine what a  
client can do and what she  
would like to do, the next  
step is to find a job to fit

BANKING ON  

her. This is not as impossi-  
ble as a search-weary woman  
may think. The counselors  
say people have asked them,  
"Isn't the name (Feminist For-  
mations) going to produce all  
kinds of cringes in the bus-  
iness community?" But they  
maintain the name actually  
saves them time. If an em-  
ployer is turned off by the  
name, they know immediately  
they won't want to place  
their clients there.  

Some firms are very open  
to Feminist Formations;  
Kathleen Sarafolean says  
they're beginning to realize  
they have to hire women, mak-  
ing this a good time to start  
an agency like theirs. Some  
companies are ignorant of the  
women's movement, but after  
talking with Feminist Forma-  
tions, accept their ideas.  
The women feel they further  
the women's movement by mak-  
ing these employers aware,  
and good relationships can u-  
sually be established with  
these first two types. Other  
companies are unmistakably  
anti-feminist. To these, the  
women simply respond, "Oh,  
I'm sorry you feel that way,"  
and leave.  

Bringing up the subject of  
feminism immediately with em-  
ployers is a fairly efficient  
screening method, but if it  
fails and a client feels she  
has been discriminated  
against, the counselors en-  
courage her to file a legal  
complaint against the company.  
"Oh, yes," says Sarafolean,  
"we have a stack of complaint  
forms a foot high."  

They provide other kinds  
of help for clients; if a wo-  
man decides she needs further  
training or education, Femin-  
ist Formations helps her sec-  
ure information about schools,  
admission requirements, loan  
applications, child care arr-  

decorating.  

THE FUTURE  

They feel that their work  
will also help women in the  
long run. "Like a bank that  
offers a new service," as the  
advantages become apparent,  
the concept will spread. As  
women begin to understand  
that they don't really have  
to accept low-paying, boring  
jobs, they will stop seeking  
that kind. As employers no-  
tice that women have varied  
skills and work well in non-  
traditional temporary jobs,  
they will hire more women.  

As employment agencies see  
the success of this approach  
to employment, more of them  
will adopt it.  

They also hope to raise  
the general pay scale for wo-  
men city-wide by decreasing  
the supply of women who must  
accept low-paying jobs.  

This employment agency is  
revolutionary even in non-fem-  
inist ways. The idea of em-  
ploying "professionals" on a  
free-lance or temporary basis  
is not widely practiced. The  
counselors feel that if more  
people worked temporarily,  
they wouldn't get so bored  
with their jobs since they'd  
be gone before the "honeymoon"  
was over.  

In the month and a half  
that the agency has been in  
operation, its largest areas  
of concentration and therefore  
success have been construction  
and the creative fields--wri-  
ting, advertising, interior  
decorating.  

Women like construction jobs  
because they pay more than "women's" jobs,  
and because, as Lee says,  
"Women are intrigued by the  
idea of spending the whole day  
outside in the sun." They  
like the physically strength-  
ening activity. Lee says they  
try to send women to construc-  
tion jobs in teams of at least  
two for mutual support in an  
emphatically male situation.  

WOMAN TO WOMAN  

The counselors would like  
to develop a service of suppl-  
ying feminists with feminists.  
For example, many women, they  
believe, would prefer to hire  
women to perform services  
such as plumbing, electrical  
work, accounting, etc. A wo-  
man who had one of these
