"Talk of American Spacewomen

Makes Me Sick”

Well, what do you know?

The National Aeronautics and  
Space Administration (NASA)  
recently announced that women  
appear no less able than men,  
physiologically, to withstand  
the rigors of space flight.

This remarkable fact was an-  
nounced following five weeks  
of testing eight Air Force  
nurses at NASA's Ames Re-  
search Center.

According to an account from  
the “Los Angeles Times,” NASA  
spokesmen stressed that these  
results, "should not be taken  
as a back door commitment to  
put women into orbit, however."

No, the facts were just spun  
around cathode ray tubes and  
the story broadcast over ra-  
dio and television and clacked  
over wire service tele-  
You see, these tests deter-  
mining the fitness of women  
as astronauts have already  
been run--14 years ago.

Thirteen women, several with  
more credentials than John  
Glenn and Scott Carpenter  
were tested and found to be  
superior candidates for the  
astronaut program. Twelve  
more were slated for testing.  
But all have turned to other  
jobs after waiting for the  
space program to make use of  
their training, talents and  
energies.

This latest “women are mak-  
ing progress" smoke screen  
was beautiful. The lovely  
Air Force cuties lined up to  
be panned by the television  
cameras--Slowly. Yep, they  
were treated just like the  
guys and even did without sex  
during the five week testing.  
And they all were single.

Interestingly, the publicity  
came after a well done cover  
article on the first women  
astronaut candidates publish-  
ed in "MS" magazine last  
September. It was even more  
interesting that no one men-  
tioned the original women  
astronaut candidates in the  
latest coverage of women's  
progress.

But women's news is seldom  
covered in detail by mass  
media, so what is well done  
is worth repeating.

Joan McCullough wrote of  
"The 13 who were left behind"  
in September's "MS," recount-  
ing the testing of women be-  
gun in 1959.

We all know about one small  
step for man and recognize  
the names, John Glenn, Neil  
Armstrong, Scott Carpenter.  
But what about Jerrie Cobb?

In 1959 Cobb had logged  
10,000 hours in the air,  
more than any other candidate be-  
ing tested at that time. Cobb  
was the woman whose test re-  
sults would determine wheth-  
er other women would be test-  
ed. Her test results were  
exceptional and twelve other  
women were tested -

They, too, were found to  
be exceptionally qualified can-  
didates. In some ways, they  
were superior to men, accord-  
ing to McCullough's article,  
they weighed less on the av-  
erage, a potential saving of  
$1,000 a pound for cargo and  
human weight, for they also  
consumed less food and oxygen  
and could use a smaller cap-  
sule. They were more radi-  
ation-resistant, less prone  
to heart attack and more dur-  
able in the event of heat,  
pain, noise and loneliness.

Despite the flying color  
test results, NASA abruptly  
halted testing in July of  
1971, after 13 of the slated  
25 had been tested.

NASA had given no warning,  
no explanation and no comment.

The women took the matter up  
with a specially convened  
Congressional subcommittee.  
The hearing lasted two days,  
with one NASA spokesman say-  
ing "Talk of American space-  
women makes me sick to my  
stomach," and others insisting  
the program would be impeded  
if they were forced to in-  
clude women.

And John Glenn, for whom  
qualification regulations had  
been waived said magnanimously,  
"If we found women who  
could prove that they had  
more capabilities than the  
men, we'd welcome them aboard  
with open arms."

Once again women had to be  
more equal to be equal and the  
subcommittee admonished the  
"good ladies" to be patient.

Fourteen years have stretched  
Hans Mark, presently  
directing NASA's Ames Research  
Center, says, "So far we see  
no reason to believe there  
are any inherent problems to  
women flying in space," it is  
a little hard to swallow. And  
the American taxpayer should  
find that kind of repetitive  
song and dance intolerable as  
well.

These recently tested Air  
Force nurse volunteers are be-  
ing used to set medical stan-  
dards for women who may be  
included on American Space  
shuttles in the 1980s.

NASA administrator, Chuck  
Berry, told a recent space  
medicine conference, "For a  
long-duration flight such as  
to Mars, the crews would be  
confined inside their space-  
craft for nearly a year.  
With so much time on their  
hands, they'd react like oth-  
er normal human beings, they  
would want sexual diversion.  
It is therefore unrealistic  
to plan future flights with-  
out coming to grips with the  
problem of women. Naturally,  
the women would be fully-op-  
erational crew members...not  
only there for sex.”

Gotcha, Mr. Berry. Over and out.
