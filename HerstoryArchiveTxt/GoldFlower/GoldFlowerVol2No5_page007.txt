8 SEES ESES os  
At 2:30 a.m. my eyelids are  
gritty and I can listen to  
Janis Joplin sing "Bobby Mc  
Gee". I respond without de-  
fenses to the rough beauty of  
the woman's voice.  

I have long been a Joplin par-  
tisan and inferred her char-  
acter traits from her music:

"Woman needs man and man  
must have his mate but  
how does a lesbian express  
her love for a woman in song?  

For centuries popular and  
folk music has reflected the  
predominantly "heterosexual/  
sexist world," Joan Capra,  
member of the "Family of Wo-  
man" band said recently.  

"Family of Woman" is a les-  
bian-feminist band comprised  
of four Chicago area women:  
Joan Capra, Judy Handler, Lin-  
da Shear and Ella Szekely.  
Two technicians, Susan Kahn  
and Michelle Brody, also tra-  
vel with the band.  

Capra said the women "hope  
to use (our) politics and  
music combined as a tool to  
validate lesbian lifestyles.  

"We play for women--  
straight or lesbian. But  
sometimes we have no say. On  
some college campuses we can't  
discriminate and men are all-  
owed, although we prefer not."  

Capra is a classically tra-  
ined violinist. Shear sings  
and plays guitar and piano,  
Handler sings and plays lead  
guitar and Ella Szekely is  
the drummer.  

None of the band suffers  
any conflict between art and  
politics.  

"We hope to use our poli-  
tics and music combined as a  
tool to validate lesbian life  
styles."  

Capra added that two of  
the women in the group write  
music and "Family of Woman"  
collects original music writ-  
ten by women throughout the  
country.  

“Family of Woman” Fills Musical  
Void for Lesbian Feminist  

Friedman Captures Janis the Performer  

Woman Proves Elusive .... Mary Hastings  

(ow & Company, 333 pp., $7.95)  
will become very familiar  
with the details of Janis'  
life, her attitude toward her  
art, friends and lovers.  

Friedman, who handled Janis'  
press relations from 1963 to  
her death in 1970,  
presents an exhaustive study of an  
American Rock idol who was  
also an American woman.

less reviews of Buried Alive

Some reviews approach the  
biography as the history of  

To supplement original wo-  
men's music, Capra continued,  
"Family of Woman" plays "more  
or less traditional songs  
other people have written.”  

“We do Dylan's ‘Just Like  
a Woman'; we change the words  
so it would be appropriate.  

The band regularly performs  
"White Bird" and "Let Them  
Talk".  

“We try to make all of our  
songs applicable to lesbians.  

One of the band's members  
wrote a song dealing with the  
problem of rape. Another wo-  
man's song relates the degrad-  
ation women feel “just being  
hassled on the street".  
Yet another song tells of the  
oppression of women in mental  
institutions.  

The band engages in dial-  
ogues with its audiences.  

Capra said “we usually in-  
troduce our songs with raps  
or reading women's poetry.  

We do 'Season of the Witch'  
and before that we give some-  
what of a historical rap a-  
bout witches."  

Although "Family of Woman"  
offers love songs for women,  
lesbian/feminist bands are  
rare.  

"The New Haven Women's Lib-  
eration Rock Band" is active,  
but "The Chicago Women's Lib-  
eration Rock Band" recently  
quit.  

"We're the only up front  
lesbian group. There are oth-  

er lesbian bands but they don't  
advertise it."

Other reviewers conceive of  
this biography as a balanced,  
reasonable rebuttal to a  
couple of lurid, first-person  
memoirs by Joplin "friends".  

I planned to approach this  
review from a strictly femin-  
ist viewpoint. I hoped to  
discover the extent of the  
damage done to Janis Joplin  
by our world's expectations  
of a woman.  

‘Certainly, Janis was “cursed"  
with enough traits that our  
society condemns in a woman:  
Unfortunately, however, it is  
impossible to assume a strid-  
ly feminist viewpoint when  
contemplating the slow sui-  
cide of Janis Joplin.  

As Friedman points out, the  
singer had many opportunities  
for love. She drove away  
many sincere friends in fav-  
or of sickening junkies and  
"pretty boys". She chose to  
shoot heroin and drink to  
excess. Then she gravitated  
to uncaring and uncritical  
companions.  

Janis possessed many of the  
traits of the performer.  
When Friedman would walk down  
a New York street with her,  
she noted Janis' eyes  

seeking a glint of recog-  
nition of hundreds of pass-  
ing eyes.  

By the end of her life Janis  
was no different from many  
performer-idols--she was a  
selfish, mean-willed person,  
with a pathological inabili-  
ty to ever consider anyone  
else's comfort above her own.  
And she was mightily talented.  

I never saw her perform live.  
But Friedman's book makes  
clear that Janis' moments of  
true living occurred on the  
stage. There she found the  
substance she lacked in her  
private life.  

Friedman has presented a fas-  
cinating picture of the 1960s  
rock world; she has detailed  
the moods and moves of Janis  
Joplin but she has not been  
able to give any satisfac-  
tory explanation for Janis'  
self-hating life.  

This failure occurs pre-  
cisely because there is no  
explanation for Janis Jop-  
lin's defects. She suffered  
mightily because of un-  
realistic demands made on  
her womanhood. But many  
women have suffered so and  
are not selfish monsters.  
The fairest assessment of  
Janis Joplin as an American  
artist and woman is that she  
was alive when she sang, and  
the rest is only temporarily  
significant.
