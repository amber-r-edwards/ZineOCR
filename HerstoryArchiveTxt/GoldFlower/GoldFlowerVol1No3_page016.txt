Some Comments About the History of Women

BY TORTOISE  
(a woman in the Twin Cities)

I would like to reply to the  
article Helen Victry wrote in  
the Nov. newspaper edition of  
"Gold Flower." Also, to ex-  
press some of the things I've  
been thinking about in terms  
of the history of women and al-  
so the history of the women's  
movement. To take one at a  
time:

I was overjoyed at reading of  
the article by Helen Victry  
where she told about the great  
civilization of Sumer, and also  
told about the queen Enheduanna.  
For those who did not see  
the article, Helen Victry told  
about the high status of women  
in Sumer where "She could hold  
property, engage in business,  
and qualify as a witness." Wo-  
men could also hold such posi-  
tions as "scribe, reciter, la-  
ment-singer, storyteller, and  
ambassador." Enheduanna wrote  
a poem where her patron deity  
is rejected. Her deity is the  
goddess, Inanna, patroness of  
love and fertility. Enheduanna  
writes:

‘Its woman no longer speaks  
of love with her husband.

At night they no longer have  
intercourse,

She no longer reveals to him  
her inmost treasures.'

The whole of the comments in  
the article led me to postulate  
that Sumer was a civilization  
where women did enjoy equality  
in employment if there was any  
such thing as employment. It  
is possible that the notions of  
‘equality' did not even present  
themselves, as ‘equality' in  
itself postulates that there  
has been some sort of disagree-  
ment as to the worth and getting-  
alongness of one division  
of human beings as compared  
with another. At any rate,  
the mobility of women in the  
outer world of political and  
social affairs was a fact in  
Sumer if women were ambassa-  
dors and scribes.

PSYCHOLOGICAL MUTILATION

Enheduanna's poem led me to  
think that women in Sumer oc-  
cupied a relatively high posi-  
tion personally and sexually  
in their society. Compared  
to the American value system,  
in which the disappointment  
and mutilation of the female  
psyche and female sexuality is  
“an everyday affair," Sumerians  
regarded female psychological  
mutilation as a catastrophe.  
(I am postulating that the  
whole of society in general  
regarded female psychological  
mutilation as a catastrophe  
because the queen wrote some-  
thing saying such, and because  
of the regarding of the queen  
as an official spokesperson  
of the culture.) I also think  
that the Sumerians put a much  
higher value on human rela-  
tions and feelings in general,  
as deduced from this poem.

COMPARISON

If abandonment of the deity,  
in terms of our culture the  
equivalent of going to hell,  
rejecting God, being cast into  
limbo, was for the Sumerians  
the corresponding event of the  
woman no longer having inter-  
course with her husband and no  
longer revealing her feelings  
to him, then this meant that  
the underlying values of Sumer  
as sanctioned by their reli-  
gion were based on feeling and  
sexuality between people. It  
also meant that women were in  
a high enough position to have  
the option to reject a man.  
Elsewhere in her article,  
Helen Victry states that it  
was relatively easy for a man  
to obtain a divorce and also  
that if she had no children,  
he could take a second wife.  
Thus, it seems that while wo-  
men enjoyed a high level of  
respect and social position in  
Sumerian society, this fact  
did not endanger the male's  
freedom or social mobility. I  
tend to think that Sumer was a  
female-centered society. Fe-  
male-centered is the opposite  
of male-dominated. There have  
been cultures where females  
did dominate, but the majority  
of matriarchal cultures have  
been female-centered --that is  
centering around the relation  
of mother to child, and thusly  
or, consequently, have been  
more tolerant of difference,  
more materialist, had horizon-  
tal structures rather than ver-  
tical, been slower moving and  
more cooperative versus com-  
petitive (as in male-dominated  
cultures) and more subject to  
gradual takeover versus war  
(the method of takeover and  
conquering in male cultures).

FEMALE CULTURE

I read the book called "The  
Necessity of Art" by Fischer  
in which he states that in fe-  
male cultures and societies  
there was a basic unity with  
the animal world. The reading  
that I've done on female  
history widely supports this  
view--female cultures had ani-  
mal symbols and animistic re-  
ligions--evidenced in female  
cultures in Africa, North and  
South America, Tibet, Ancient  
Egypt, Ireland, and the Scan-  
dinavian countries. These  
societies generally had reli-  
gions focusing around animals,  
the earth, etc., with the hu-  
man being in the center with  
kind of a radius outward, into  
the seasons, the forest, and  
such. Fischer says that when  
the male hunting of animals  
came along there was a basic  
guilt, fear, and irrationality  
of feelings regarding the fe-  
male that developed among men.

In killing the animal, mak-  
ing the animal bleed, the man  
connected it to the bleeding  
woman. In killing the animal,  
he was killing the woman. In  
many tribes it was reported  
that the hunter should avoid  
the glance of the dying animal  
as the glance was a reproach  
from the animal world. That  
is, the man knew he was doing  
something wrong.

MARXISM & WOMEN

Other things occur to me  
while I am writing this arti-  
cle--which connect with some  
of the basic premises that I  
am trying to state. The im-  
pact of the Fischer book to me  
was that women are the first  
Marxists. Marxism to me means  
essentially two things: that  
outer material circumstances  
are primary and to be heavily  
considered in judging and  
assessing any social or for  
that matter, any individual  
situation. People are not  
static entities to be considered  
within themselves, but are  
a relation and process con-  
stantly changing in relation to  
outside factors, other people,  
and the social and economic  
environment. The second maxim  
of Marxism, or included within  
the first definition, is the  
ism.

Dialectics, in my notion of  
thinking, just means that  
things are in a constant  
process of change. The first  
notion of creation or being is  
movement, change, versus  
entropy which means things come  
to a static, immoveable end.

I disagree with Marx in that  
I interpret his notion of so-  
cial struggle to mean violent  
class war, and that class war  
is necessary to bring about  
progress. I think that is  
rather a gross oversimplifica-  
tion of dialectics--synthesis,  
collision or friction, new  
synthesis. I rather see dia-  
lectics in the artistic sense  
in the context of change and  
process--what the psychologists  
call self-actualization and the  
existentialists call 'Becom-  
ing.' They are all connected.

Back to the contention that  
women are the first Marxists.  
Women, due to the connection  
with the animal world and with  
children, were able to be more  
level-headed as far as human  
feelings and developing a ma-  
terialist notion of life.  
Hence, the stigma, used to our
