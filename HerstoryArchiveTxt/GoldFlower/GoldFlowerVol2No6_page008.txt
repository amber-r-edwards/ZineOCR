Men Star in

Women’s

Only six men and many more women came to
the performance of "Lysistrata" which I saw
at Dudley Riggs' Experimental Theater Co.
on Washington Ave. A pity for both sexes.
More men should have come to enjoy the fami-
liar male buffoonery which clutters our mo-
dern stage. The women should have skipped
this chance to see a mythical heroine in
action, and rather stayed home that evening
to watch a very real Billie Jean King dis-
patch another Riggs.

For those few readers who are curious
about what "Lysistrata" is like as a man's
play, I'll recite the transformation. The
men are introduced as crippled, yet still
operative wind-up soldiers in an extended
scene which opens this adaptation. (In
Aristophanes' "Lysistrata," the opening
scene belongs to the women.) When the women
are finally brought on in this misbegotten
production, Lysistrata talks like a carni-
val barker, a female Professor Harold Hill.
The rest of the women are twittering cheer-
leaders. Remember, I recite; I don't ex-
plain.

The women agree to deprive the men of
sexual access until the men settle on
a peaceful compromise. Lysistrata incites
her unlikely troops to storm the Acropolis.
They throw the men out and the separation
begins.

The rest of the performance concentrates
on the men's sexual agonies as they attempt
to wrest their women from the seat of power.

Play

A Review

Referring to Rogers' translation of the
Greek comedy, I find the lines:

LYSISTRATA. Now in the market you see them
like Corybants, jangling about with
their armor of mail.

Fiercely they stalk in the midst of the
crockery, sternly parade by the cabbage
and kale...

STRATYLLIS. Lately I witnessed a
captain of cavalry, proudly the while
on his charger he sat,

Witnessed him, soldierly, buying an omelet
stowing it all in his cavalry hat...

Off runs a shop-girl, appalled at the
sight of him, down he sits soldierly,
gobbles her fruit.

The women in the Experimental Theater Co.
production have no lines like that. They
are continually and deliberately upstaged
by the men. Lysistrata is nearly a minor
character. I can only suppose that the
director, James Monitor, slanted the pro-
duction toward the only kind of humor and
heroics he understands. "Lysistrata" is
simply not his play, and once he got his
hands on it, it could not be ours either.

By the play's end, the antiwar humor has
been drowned out by a deluge of sexuality.
The men are "hot" and a painted sun glowers
down on them. What do they do on this
sweltering day? They eat donuts -- linger-
ingly, lovingly. No doubt every hole is
supposed to be a vagina, but as I watched
one soldier shove his staff through this
tight little pastry, the resemblance to an
asshole was unmistakable. Monitor's over-
zealous attempts to emphasize a heterosex-
ual tension sometimes take strange turns.

This clowning was intermittently funny,
but these laughs should not have belonged to
the men. It is the women who recognize
their husbands and protectors as comedians.
The comedy is sharpest when the women dis-
parage their men's military pretensions.

Library Positions

The American Library Asso-
ciation/Social Responsibili-
ties Round Table/Task Force
on Women maintains a roster
of women interested in admin-
istrative management and
specialist positions in lib-
raries. Women who desire to
be placed on the roster fill
out a standard form, which
includes such basic resume
information as educational
and employment background,
type of library and responsi-
bilities preferred, geographic
restrictions, etc. On the
basis of this information pro-
file forms are screened and
matched to incoming employer
requests for resumes.

The goal of the women's
roster is to increase the
opportunities for women in
librarianship at a time when
fewer women are being chosen
for high level positions than
was the case twenty years
ago. Currently, 73 women are
listed on the roster and over
100 library employers have re-
quested resumes either for
general affirmative action
use or for specific job open-
ings. The roster has been in
operation since spring, 1972.

For further information,
resume forms or employer re-
quests, contact the current
roster coordinator, Liz Dick-
inson, Hennepin County Libra-
ry, Technical Services Divi-
sion, 7001 York Ave. So.,
Edina, Mn. 55435. Phone:
