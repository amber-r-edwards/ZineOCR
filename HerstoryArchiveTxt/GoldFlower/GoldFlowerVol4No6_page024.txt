ABOUT THE COVER. June 22-28 is National Gay Pride week. We thought the picture, taken by  
Ellen Hawley at Byerly's in Golden Valley, a good one for this month's issue, in recognition  

of Gay Pride Week. We encourage you to read "A True Fairy Tale” and the petition entitled  
"Petition for Sanity,” and act according to your convictions.
