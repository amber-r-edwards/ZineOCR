A POEM TO THE POEM THAT DIDN'T LOVE ME

It was you who turned away.  
I came risking everything...  
husband's jealousy, frenzied traffic,  

my life itself... to be with you, scrounged  

for change to get me through the door  
where I knew you'd be,  

laid my heart bare and waited  

to be flipped on my back  

blinded by passion.  

Nothing happened.  

Beryle Williams  

"MY LOVELY LADY, WHY CAN'T YOU SLEEP?"*  

Finding no wolf's tooth  

in a world that's lost its wilderness,  
gone wild itself, instead,  

I lay my head on a pillow of ice  

and watch. Slow across the wastes  
beyond moonstruck, barren sill  

he comes, his great white coat  

touched blue beneath his chin and  

at his loins, with shadow.  

He looms a moment in my window,  
nostrils twitching at unexpected scent,  
then jet-glow eyes go red in shock when  
I open my jaws and swallow him.  

Beryle Williams  

"Take a wolf's tooth," he said, "and lay it  
on your window sill." "It will frighten  

away the evil spirits.”  

YOU SAVE ME EVERY TIME YOU SPEAK  

If I took off shoe after shoe  
sock after sock  

my feet would still be heavy  

and my face as long as a tree.  

My hands aching from clay  

Your face aching from the smile  
that I catch now  

Your soft voice  

Your soft, smiling voice  

You save me every time.

NOW RAIN DOWN  

bicycle through storm  
love of this  
I bring the clay  
hands, wheel,  

water  

that once spoke the softest of rivers  

now rain down  
now lightning  

now thunder
