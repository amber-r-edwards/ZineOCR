ZSTAMS [Mle 5

Dear sisters at Gold Flower;

Although I found your last issue gener-
ally quite good and was especially pleased
to see the gay women's groups in your cal-
endar, I felt that the article on Gloria
Steinem paid insufficient attention to one
specific problem lesbians are faced with con-
sistently—that of being ignored or slighted
by predominantly straight women's groups.
Steinem is highly praised despite the fact
that she “touched on every feminist issue
except abortion and gayness." As it is
stated that she made some remarks on abor-
tion later in the day, it seems the only
issue she neglected was gayness. To me and
my thousands of gay sisters in the area, this
is no slight omission, but a major weakness
in her presented views. Steinem and many
other straight feminists have really got
their heads together on many things, but
until they start including gay women in their
thinking, they will remain seriously lacking.
We are tired of being ignored—men generally
try to pretend lesbians don't exist and it's
a double blow when we receive the same treat-
ment from our straight sisters.

Dear Person,

This is an unsolicited manuscript which I
hope you can use.

It's either a poem or a puzzle.

By the way, it's very nice to have
Gold Flower around. A lot of people, who
aren't too attuned to getting out thank you
notes and things, feel the same way. Thank
you.

Sincerely,
