Women Boycotting

Two local food cooperatives,  
the Southeast Community Store  
and the Selby Food Coop, have  
joined the Twin Cities chap-  
ters of the National Organiza-  
tion for Women in boycotting  
products of Land-O'-Lakes, a  
grocery supplier and owner of  
Bridgeman's stores. NOW al-  
leges that Land-O'-Lakes dis-  
criminates against women and  
minority men in hiring, pay,  
and promotion practices.

In February the local NOW  
chapters will attend the na-  
tional NOW meeting and re-  
quest that the national organ-  
ization participate in the  
selective buying campaign.

NOW has also filed a com-  
plaint of sexual and racial  

Dare To Rebel

Sex discrimination is ille-  
gal. Women are taking legal  
action against employers in  
increasing numbers with in-  
creasing success.

But the women who filed the  
first sex discrimination suits  
took big risks—from being  
fired to being labeled a  
troublemaker, an anathema  
to prospective employers.

Ellen Dresselhuis, Minnea-  
polis attorney and active  
member of the Women's Equity  
Action League, handles many  
of the city's sex discrimina-  
tion suits. She admires the  
women who "really stuck their  
necks out" by undertaking the  
slow, costly process of pro-  
secuting a suit.

But now, explains Dressel-  
huis, there is a new, effec-  
tive tool which protects the  
individual seeking equal pay.  
Under Title VII of the Civil  
Rights Act and other provi-  
sions, suits can be filed by  
organizations on behalf of an  
individual who can remain an-  
onymous and protected from  

discrimination with the E-  
qual Employment Opportunity  
Commission. There is an o-  
verwhelming backlog of cases  
to be investigated, but even-  
tually the Commission will  
assign an investigator to  
make a thorough study of the  
company's practices.

Two NOW members met with  
Land-O'-Lakes representa-  
tives last fall as part of  
a survey of Twin Cities em-  
ployment practices. One mem-  
ber said the company repre-  
sentatives expected them to  
"sit there like little la-  
dies," telling them only  
what they wanted them to hear.  
When the NOW members  
began asking questions, the  
company reps acted "insulted  
and embarrassed."

"We knew some of the women  
who had been working there  
and heard their stories,"  
said one NOW member, and the  
picture the company painted  
"just didn't connect right."

NOW members say women often  
receive unequal pay for equal  
work, while minority employ-  
ees of either sex are almost  
non-existent in the company.

When a former employee

that she had been doing the  
same work as a man for less

pay and was reimbursed—but

her.

retaliatory action. Organi-  

zations like the Equal Employ-  
ment Opportunities Commission  
which formerly had only con-  

ciliatory powers, can now sue  
offending businesses.

Unequal pay and unfair hir-  
ing practices have been cost-  
ly for the men and women who  
lost out in the past. Now  
business is beginning to re-  
alize the costs of sex dis-  
crimination. Losing court  
cases is costly but not near-  
ly as costly as under-utiliz-  
ing the talents of all the  
people they employ.

When will businesses alter  
their behavior? "When it  
starts costing them money,"  
says Dresselhuis. "Discrim-  
ination is just not good bus-  
iness practice."

With more companies paying  
attorney's fees and fines,  
sex discrimination suits are  
increasingly effective in  
changing business's treatment  
of women and minorities. Af-  
ter a few resounding success-

A NOW member from Iowa vis-  
ited a Land-O'-Lakes plant in  
southern Minnesota and tour-  
ed a production line. She  
asked the male supervisor why  
all the production workers  
were women, and he said, "On-  
ly women would work for these  
low wages."

The company took repress-  
ive measures against women  
who dared rebel. For example,  
some of the clerical workers  
tried to form a union. The  
company president sent a let-  
ter to clerical employees  
questioning the need for such  
a union, since the company  
"does so well for its employ-  
ees."

At times the management has  
used gangster movie tactics  
in its fight to maintain the  
status quo. At one point a  
corporate secretary attended  
a clerical union meeting to  
"spy"; she took notes and  
made a full report to manage-  
ment.

Even the Land-O'-Lakes sym-  

bol, an Indian woman, is an  
unwitting reminder of the  
company's discrimination:  
there are no Indian women on  
the Board of Directors or in  
top management at Land-O'-  
Lakes.

REIDELL  

es the threat of a discrimin-  
ation suit will have more im-  
pact according to Dresselhuis.

Most of those who are fil-  
ing suits are women who are  
supporting themselves and  
their families or those who  
are recently divorced and  
living on their own. “They  
are most aware of the pro-  
blems," Dresselhuis explains.  
But the real changes have to  
come for the average woman  
with a high school diploma  
and those women who are "a  
heartbeat away from welfare."

Equality in employment will  
come, says Dresselhuis, "the  
day the average woman can  
make as much as the average  
man."

She says the woman who is  
willing to be underutilized  
is as responsible for keep-  
ing women down as the boss  
who doesn't promote her. "We  
women have to be alert and un-  
derstand that they are enti-  
tled to be recognized for  
their abilities."
