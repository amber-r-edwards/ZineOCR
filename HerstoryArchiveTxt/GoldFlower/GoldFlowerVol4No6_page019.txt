Ah, so much is happening (and not happening) these
days. As the Total Woman grows in popularity with
women in the thirty- to forty-five age range (just
about the time a marriage is at its most intolerable)
out comes a movie, based on the book of the same
title, The Stepford Wives. The Stepford wives, as a
matter of fact, bear a striking resemblance to the
images of the Total Woman as set forth by author
Marabel Morgan. Except that Marabel Morgan's victims,
unlike the cyborgs in Stepford Wives, bleed.

Dianne Blacker, a disciple of Marabel Morgan, held a
workshop in Edina recently, at which she spouted the
shit contained in Morgan's book to women whose hus-
bands, many of them, were alcoholics, and whose mar-
riages were on the rocks, as they say. Blacker, in
typical parasitical fashion (much like the faith
healer who hits and runs and leaves his hapless vic-
tims to die out of his sight), hauled in a cool
$2,040 for a day and a half's non-stop spewing of
the same tired advice women have been given for cen-
turies in order that they should save the world by
keeping their families happy and satisfied. Never-
mind about them. They are under God, husband, chil-
dren, and society. If there's any time left over,
well, take five for yourself, honey.

At the same time, ERA is all but dead. Anti-abortion-
ists are working hard for a twenty-second amendment
to the Constitution to make abortion under any cir-
cumstances murder. Third World women and Native
American women and poor white women are suffering
forced sterilization. Foreign aid to "underdeveloped"
countries has contraceptive strings attached. Popu-
lation control is aimed, obviously, at the "undesir-
able" elements in the world.

At the same time EEOC is back-logged 100,000 cases
in discrimination suits, and has run out of people and
funds. At the same time, Pa Bell, all over the
country, typifies corporate intransigence about
complying with equal pay and equal opportunity laws.

At the same time, schools are circumventing the law
that says they must eliminate sex bias in the schools
by either ignoring the dicta or giving lip- or token-
service, and are supported by HEW's flaccid non-
stand. (I am convinced Casper Weinberger hates women
even more than Norman Mailer!)

At the same time, women are suffering more from
our present economic crisis (depression? recession?
Take your pick, it's all a capitalist plot either
way). They are the ones with the highest unemploy-
ment rate. And those who do work--full time, year
round--make only 58% of what men make. Surely you
are familiar with that tired but poignant statistic--
the female college graduate makes less than the male
high school dropout. And government studies show
this hierarchical economic structure regarding wages:
first comes the white male (what else?), then the
minority male, then the white female, and then the
minority female (who fights all the stinking battles
against sexism, classism, and racism!).

At the same time, child care bills have failed mis-
erably in legislatures all over the country, as well
as on Capitol Hill. At the same time, rape is the
fastest growing crime in America, that good old
bastion of male macho worship.

Meanwhile, the male hierarchy has quit laughing at us
long enough to send the FBI skulking after us. And
they must be terrified at the notion of women from
every nation gathering in Mexico for International
Women's Year, for many are sending men to represent us!
Ah, sometimes I feel as if we're treading water.
But I have faith. Feminists are strong, serious and
determined women. And I'll bet our ranks will soon
be swelled with all those women attempting to be
“total women", as well as those who are being trained
to infiltrate.

SO-CALLED RIGHT TO LIFERS:
AN INTERESTING STUDY.

The Americans for Democratic Action and NARAL con-
ducted a study of twenty-eight anti-abortionist
senators and found that they have consistently
opposed such quality of life bills as programs to
prevent child abuse, emergency medical care, public
health programs, health service research, and im-
proved services for older Americans.

Further, there was a highly significant statistical
relationship between votes on abortion and votes
in support of capital punishment, hand-guns, funding
for the Vietnam war, and no-knock laws.

Dr. James Prescott concludes that what motivates
certain legislators to support restrictive abortion
measures is a desire to punish women for engaging in
sexual activity--not concern for the dignity of life.
Our very own John Zwach supports Prescott's premise
when he complains, “There seems to be a sickness in
this country; people need to have sexual intercourse."
His perception amazes me! Prescott also notes that
those societies which permit abortion show a greater
respect for the dignity of human life than those.
