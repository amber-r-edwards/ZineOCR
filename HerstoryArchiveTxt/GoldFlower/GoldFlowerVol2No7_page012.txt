Woman Alone Learns Power  

"But on this particular day,  
it was different... A daughter  
handed me a family book that  
recounted this woman's life,  

which I found truly engrossing.  

She had crossed the plains in  
a covered wagon with her hus-  
band all those many years ago,  
-..-endured the death of her  
husband, the deaths of her  
children, and had then grown  
old quietly alone...  

All the usual questions  
seemed ridiculous when put to  
those clear, sad eyes. I  
tried a new one, actually cur-  
ious about how this unordinary  
person would answer. ‘What  
would you like to do most now  
now?' I asked. She turned,  
fully facing me, a sliver of  
bright light turning her eyes  
electric for a second. ‘I  
would like to die,' she said.  

"At least she was able to  
state her preference."  

love  

She confronts the question  
of loving, and reaches for a  
broader definition of love.  
She refutes fear of same-sex  
love. "Our concern about love  
is so fearful and limiting...  
Who knows what might happen  
if two men or two women ack-  
nowledge deep affection and  

An exhibition of black and  
white painted wood sculpture  
by LOUISE NEVELSON opens  

in November at Walker Art  
Center.  

The elderly artist will visit  
Minneapolis to celebrate the  
opening of the exhibition.  

The show will consist of some  
80 works, including 20 large-  
scale "wall" pieces, executed  
by Nevelson during the past  
two decades. Nevelson is  
acknowledged  

as one of the foremost "assemblage" artists,  
and creates her complex works  
from accumulated crates, box-  
es and other wooden "found  
objects."  

care? Social structures might  
collapse; institutions topple.  
Landlords would complain. The  
sun might not come up tomor-  
row. We fear ‘unnatural' sex  
relationships, because we have  
made what is natural a distor-  
tion, and so we deny feeling.  
But if women can't reach out  
for other women, nor men for  
other men, aren't we less ab-  
le to realize love in a full  
sense? Haven't we, then, all  
lost something?"  

Power  

O'Brien learned to under-  
stand the powerlessness of wo-  
men. "I sometimes have felt  
painfully inarticulate in work  
situations, usually when they  
are of particular importance  
to me. One day I went into  
my editor's office with an  
idea for a story, first care-  
fully preparing what I wanted  
to say, defensive about how  
good it might be and afraid  
he would think it was terri-  
ble. In the midst of our un-  
derstandably stilted conversa-  
tion a male reporter strolled  
in, greeted the editor, and  
casually talked about a pro-  
ject that interested him,  
throwing in a request for  
time off. The two men, both  

outwardly relaxed and easy,  
negotiated a bit and settled  
the problem within a few mo-  
ments. I sat there, my  
speech out the window, envi-  
ous and frustrated, wondering  
why that type of encounter  
came so easily for the man  
and so hard for me.  

"David Riesman has sugges-  
ted that a basic problem for  
working women is they do not  
know how to make use of the  
informal structure that men  
use in the process of advan-  
cing their careers. Women  
are not and never will be  
casual members of the undefin-  
able but always present male  
circle, whether in the office,  
the city room, the factory,  
or the university, which is  
why, if they want to achieve,  
they must work twice as hard  
as their male counterparts.  
Men no longer believe in Hor-  
atio Alger, but it seems many  
women do, and they have for-  
gotten he was a man."  

O'Brien emphasizes that  
seizing power means a willing-  
ness to risk, whether it be  
failure or unpopularity.  
Choosing solitude means risk-  
ing loneliness--but success  
is impossible without risk,  
and is the beginning of liber-  
ation.
