A Tale of Diaper Pails and Broken  
Balloons  
She could remember when days  
hung like a thousand red balloons  

ready to burst forth with hope,  

but now the years of mazeway stumbling  

through diaper pail drudgery  

have taken their toll.  

With vapid overconcern  
she tries to talk with  

a clerk who declines.  

As the woman turns grey  
hairs at the temple  
look like tiny scars  
from the days of too  

many diaper pails.  

by Cheryl Trulen  

(for Linda)  

She turns her torn roots up  
& trusts them to the sun  
With assurance kindled by  
that fire, & hot salt water  
they are revived  

Gold tears on a tremble ride  

in rivers to her neck  

Fallow tears spill down the ache,  
she gives them to the sky  

For people are in constant  

flux & earth a wobbling whore:  
Only the lunar flame survives.

I see you, my sisters,  
standing accused, forever convict  
in a death house self designed.  
Be no docile thing  
struggling to recover  
the innocence of lost years.  
You are  
the emancipated daughters  
of mother earth.  
The blooms of spring  
long buried by winter's lurid wish  
are restored to new awareness.  

And you shall stand naked, a dance.
