Tribunal Indicts Minnesota for Crimes  
Against Women -- Raises Lobbying Funds  

BY MARY RETSINAS  

The inability to obtain  
safe, legal abortions imposes  
an incredible hardship upon  
the women of Minnesota. In  
order to expose the situa-  
tion, 125 women assembled in  
Luther Hall the evening of  
October 28 in order to put  
the government of the State  
of Minnesota on trial for  
crimes against women. The  
tribunal was sponsored by  
the Minnesota Women's Abor-  
tion Action Coalition, whose  
demands are: to repeal all  
abortion laws, end forced  
sterilization, and an end  
to restrictions on contra-  
ceptives. Endorsers includ-  
ed the Minnesota Organiza-  
tion to Repeal Abortion Laws  
(MORAL), MWPC, Women's Advo-  
cates, U of M Women's Liber-  
ation, West Suburban Council  
for Women's Liberation, and  
Dr. Jane Hodgson.  

MWAAC coordinator Linda  
Willaman began the evening  
by stating that each woman  
testifying represented thou-  
sands. She spoke on the be-  
half of an unnamed fifteen  
year old who could not be  
present because her illegal  
abortion had killed her.  
Robert McCoy spoke at consid-  
erable length, saying that  
those who favor legal abor-  
tion are traditionalists,  
seeing as abortion has only  
been illegal for a little  
over a hundred years. McCoy  
also stated that he felt the  
issue of a woman's right to  
control her own body should  
be underplayed, since this  
idea makes some people uncom-  
fortable. The identity of  
these odd individuals who  
don't think people should  
control their bodies is open  
to conjecture.  

Every single candidate for  
the Minnesota Legislature  
was sent an invitation to  
the tribunal. None came,  
one sent a contribution.  
Two women volunteered to  
testify that they were forci-  

but  

bly sterilized, but had to  
back down because they fear-  
ed repercussions from wel-  
fare. (Surprised, anyone?)  
Renee Ward of MORAL and  
Enid Griffen of NOW both  
spoke. Rebecca Muir of  
U of M Women's Liberation  
told of her illegal abortion  
in Montreal. The University  
health service diagnosed her  
pregnancy as a tumor, which  
delayed her past New York's  
24 week limit, so she was  
forced to seek an illegal  
abortion. She was given a  
D & C without anaesthetic  
and whisked onto the street  
with no time to recover, and  
with the information that the  
cabbie that picked her  
up would probably be from  
the police. She spent the  
night in terror of bleeding  
to death or spending years  
in a foreign jail. After de-  
claring a suitcase of Kotex  
to the customs officials,  
she had to run the length of  
the airport to catch the  
plane and avoid the police.  
Other interesting testi-  
mony was that of Mary Fuess-  
ner, who the Minnesota Daily  
described with sexism that is  
admittedly unusual for them,  
as a "Minneapolis housewife."  
Fuessner conceived twice  
with IUDs. She compared  

MWAAC - UNIVERSITY WOMEN’S LIBERATION  

health care here with that  

in Czechoslovakia, where she  
discovered her first preg-  
nancy. She stated that the  
New York doctor asked her  

why she didn't learn her les-  
son the first time around,  
and she said, "I knew I was  
back in America when I had to  
wait four hours to be hassled  
by a doctor." An interesting  
sidelight is that Mary was  
sterilized this summer, and  
now has reason to believe  

she is pregnant again, which  
if nothing else illustrates  
the necessity of having abor-  
tion available in the face  

of contraceptive failure.  

Etta Magnusen of MWAAC  
auctioned off portions of  
Bella Abzug's abortion rights  
act. The audience responded  
enthusiastically. In the  
course of the evening, $277  
was raised.  

MWAAC needs more money, be-  
cause on International Wo-  
men's Day, the Women's Abor-  
tion Action Coalition will  
hold a similar tribunal in  
New York on an international  
scale. Noted persons from  
all over will attend. Simone  
de Beauvoir will be the  
chairperson. WONAAC litera-  
ture says, "The tribunal will  
hear testimony from Black  
Women, Latina Women, Chica-  
nas, Native American and  
Asian Women, Gay Women, High  
School and College Women,  
Working Women, Women in the  
Military, and Catholic Wo-  
men." All sisters are en-  
couraged to testify and to  
attend, and if they can't,  
to help MWAAC out with money  
or with time. Women have  
certainly suffered long  
enough on account of laws  
that make it illegal for a  
human being to control her  
own body.
