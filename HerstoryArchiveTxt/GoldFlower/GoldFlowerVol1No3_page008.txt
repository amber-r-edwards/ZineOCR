Controversy of Poets

This is the third issue of  
"Gold Flower," and here is  
the third notice of the wo-  
men's poetry group. In the  
beginning we didn't intend  
either a series of reminders  
or a statement of purpose.  
The group was formless, try-  
ing out ideas and getting  
acquainted, so this might  
have been premature. The  
letter from two of our mem-  
bers in the second issue was  
perhaps just that, as well  
as only a partial exposure  
of our problems. Maybe if  
we explain in more detail  
what led up to this writing  
and where the group seems to  
be now, other women will be-  

come interested and any con-  
fusion will clear up.

An unknown friend publish-  
ed a short factual notice of  
the group in the November  
"Gold Flower." We were hap-  
py to see it. However, one  
of its statements touched a  
bone of contention among us  
--and dogs were heard to  
growl. I don't want this  
metaphor to bite the hand  
that fed it: no slur is in-  
tended! The word that the  
group was “interested in fur-  
thering the careers of women  
poets in the Twin Cities  
area" prompted two members  
to write a letter printed in  
the December/January issue.  
These women said that they  
were less interested in ca-  
reer or “personal cult" (as  
they put it) than in sharing  
the experience of expression  
with other women. Further,  
they disagreed with what  
they saw as the tendency of  
the group toward careerism.  
Once again the group as a  
whole knew nothing about it  
until we saw it.

From the beginning we've  
been split over purpose:  
should we concentrate on  
poetic craft, discussion of  
women's problems in art, sup-  
port in addition to criti-  
cism? or should we emphasize  
the public aspects of poeting  
by giving readings and pub-  
lishing, etc.? But we didn't  
articulate these differences  
to each other, and therefore  
became frustrated. No one  
objected to getting together,  
reading poems and talking a-  
bout writing. Most of each  
meeting was spent on just  
that. Occasionally an at-  
tempt at discussing a project  
would be made, but was always  
dropped without any plan de-  
veloped. Inevitably someone  
would say, "Aren't we going  
to hear any poems?" And in-  
stantly we stopped talking  

about action, as if it wasn't  
what we really came for.  
Since we didn't talk about  
how we felt when this kept  
happening, we never came to  

an understanding.

Finally at a meeting only  
a few attended, we did talk  
some about our different per-  
ceptions of the group. It  
was discovered that most dis-  
trusted any effort at wider  
recognition of group and/or  
individuals. This was "ca-  
reerism" and synonymous with  
competition, exaltation of  
the individual, power hunger,  
personal gain, etc. I can  
understand that women be-  
ginning to join together  
would fear duplicating the  
mistakes often made by male  
artists. But I don't be-  
lieve that these mistakes  
are unavoidable. We've be-  
gun as a group of poets who  
respect and support each  
other, avoiding competition  
--we can extend our collec-  
tivity into a larger situa-  
tion. I think our poetry  
should be heard by others,  
men as well as women, and  
that this speaking out is  
bound to strengthen our own  
work and our conception of  
woman as poet. We need mo-  
dels because there are few  
feminist poets.

Our solution (at this date)  
to the split is this: we  
will continue to meet regu-  
larly for the purpose of  
helping each other with ex-  
pression in poetry (and  
prose). Also, we will meet  
at different times to pursue  
active projects as they come  
up. Right now we're working  
on printing of our poems in  
postcard, bookmark and 8½ by  
11 broadside sheet forms.  
This will be done coopera-  
tively, with more emphasis  
on sharing our work than on  
profit. If a woman doesn't  
feel ready, she may choose  
to stay out of a project  
without dropping the group.  
The core seems to be the  
workshop situation, and it  
will probably stay that way.

I feel that we've strug-  
gled among ourselves and  
reached a satisfactory solu-  
tion for all--much better  
than an ideological split-up.  
We can work together, even  
in such an individual and  
private thing as art, and we  
can do without leaders and  
cults. The group is com-  
pletely open to new women.

Liberation Office Closes

Dear Sisters,

We regret to announce  
the closing of the Female  
Liberation Office. Although  
your response to our appeal  
was heartening, nothing  
short of a massive outpour-  
ing of funds could have  
saved it. There was enough  
money to meet current ex-  
penses, but there was no-  
thing with which to pay the  
debt. Consequently, our  
credit was cut off, and with  
it our access to reasonably  
priced supplies. Without  
them we could no longer con-  
tinue. If you have things  
in the office, please get  
the key from the day care  
center and pick them up.

It is sad that the Twin  
Cities cannot support a wo-  
men's liberation office at  
this time. It is our hope  
that as the movement grows  
the need will become evident  
and support will be found  
for a new office.

In sisterhood,

Poodle

was carded. When she showed  
proper identification (driv-  
er's license and others), she  
was asked for two corrobora-  
ting signatures. Unable to  
present any, the checker ask-  
ed her to write her name on a  
piece of paper. She did and  
the checker said that she  
didn't write both of them.  
The woman didn't get in.

The atmosphere was much  
Ten to  
15 people were present most  
of the time. At 11 p.m. the  
largest group was present,  
including many men. (Before,  
it was mostly women.) One  
reporter came at about 11:15.  
After asking why the Poodle  
was being picketed, he asked  
the girl he was interviewing  
if “she was of that nature”  
--to which she responded,  
“Yes--I'm gay." The police  
came about then and asked if  
we had been hassled or heckl-  
ed. I was surprised--I  
thought that is what they  
asked the management. (Al-  
though there was an everyday  
bum--plain clothes policeman?  
-- with a walkie talkie on  
the corner.) By now it was  
about 11:30 and people were  
cold. The demonstrators  
either left or went inside.  
Since I wasn't inside, I  
don't know whether the gay  
couples were being hassled  
or not. I was also getting  
cold, so we left at midnight.
