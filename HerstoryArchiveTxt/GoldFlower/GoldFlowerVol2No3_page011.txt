Without Getting Screwed  

Herpes Simplex  

Herpes simplex is a virus which can be  
spread by sexual contact (oral, genital, or  
anal). It is characterized by blisters on  
the skin or mucous membrane. These may itch  
when they are erupting and later become pain-  
ful. The blisters look like and are related  
to cold sores.  

In women the sores occur primarily on the  
labia but also within the vagina. In men  
they can appear on the penis or scrotum. The  
blisters last eight to ten days and do tend  
to recur.  

There are no known cures for herpes simplex.  
However, the discomfort can be reduced through  
Burrows soaks, ice pack, or heat. The sores  
should be encouraged to be dry. Some  
physicians also recommend Glyoxide or Orabase  
(a medication for canker sores), which can be  
purchased at drugstores without a prescrip-  
tion.  

Pap Test  

The Pap test is a laboratory test of a  
sample of cells from the cervix and the upper  
vagina taken during a pelvic examination. This  
test is a valuable diagnostic tool and can  
give early warning of cervical or uterine can-  
cer. Contrary to public opinion, cervical and  
uterine cancer can occur in young women. Can-  
cer is more apt to occur in women who are  
sexually active than in virgins, and it has  
been shown to be associated with having multi-  
ple sex partners, starting at an early age.  
However, cervical and uterine cancer can  
occur in sexually inexperienced women as  
well. All women should have a Pap test once  
a year. If tests for two consecutive years  
show no disorder, however, young women can  
skip two to three years before being retested.  
Tests are given free at many public health  
facilities.

campus. Both are free and confidential, and  
no information will be given to parents or  
University officials.  

Hall Health Center offers both medical help  
and psychiatric counseling. The staff pro-  
vides counseling on contraception, sexual  
problems, the decision to terminate a preg-  
nancy, and post-abortion concerns. A major  
advantage of Hall Health is that its staff  
can treat any physical aspects of your  
problems while giving psychiatric and social  
counseling.  

The Counseling Center in Schmitz Hall  
offers help for problems of an emotional or  
social nature. The Center is not set up to  
provide long-term therapy, and most patients  
will be limited to eight to ten visits, ex-  
cept in rare cases. The types of problems  
with which they deal are fear of homosexuali-  
ty, frigidity, impotence, and adjustment to  
school.  

If these services cannot help you directly,  
they will assist you to locate the free or  
low-cost community agencies that can help.  

OFF CAMPUS  

Several off-campus sources of sexual  
counseling are available in the Seattle area.  
In addition to those that provide general  
sexual counseling, several local agencies  
have been set up to counsel homosexuals and  
to provide discussion groups.
