Lesbian Separatism--  
A Straight View  

Dear Sisters:  

I am writing in response  
to some real concern I felt  
and still feel about certain  
political views expressed at  
The Season of the Witch--  
namely--"Lesbian Separatism."  
It's not that I hadn't been  
exposed to it before or hadn't  
been in groups that dealt with  
it before, but I  

think hearing the ideas so  
strongly presented at the  
same time we were feeling  
such pride and sisterhood  
and power threw me off bal-  
ance and I still feel the  
need to share my feelings  
with my sisters.  

In order to identify my  
concern, I guess I need to  
state that I have no objec-  
tion to a separatist philoso-  
phy that removes gay women  
from association with men. I  
have no objection to a separ-  
atist philosophy that encour-  
ages gay women to occasional-  
ly withdraw from straight wo-  
men to gain strength and sup-  
port from each other. But I  
do object to a separatist  
philosophy that completely  
withdraws from straight wom-  
en as a matter of political  
principle and further casts  
straight women into the role  
of collaborator and states  
that straight women aren't  
honest in their politics.  

I guess what's moving me to  
write is fear. I see too  
many of my sisters steering  
themselves toward something I  
was raised in--namely a reac-  
tionary fundamentalism that  
refuses to allow anyone else  
their portion of truth.  

It's not that I can't under-  
stand the idea of complete  
separatism. The logical, al-  
most mathematically precise,  
extension of the feminist  
movement, given the present  
patriarchal capitalistic sys-  
tem we live in, is separatism  

(with, hopefully, some way  
to achieve spontaneous gen-  
eration.)  

But I am not yet persuaded  
that the reason for men's  
differences is solely physi-  
cal in origin and not more  
sociologically and psycho-  
logically based. If the pro-  
blems are caused by physio-  
logical differences then we  

can have no hope and I will  
end my letter here and be-  
come celibate. But if, as I  
suspect, the problems lie in  
programming and conditioning  
then the problems can be o-  
vercome by education and con-  
ditioning of a different na-  
ture. This generation of  
men and probably the next  
several generations are ir-  
revocably lost. It's the  
future generations who can  
be liberated from the kinds  
of roles men have created  
for themselves and for us.  

If you choose to separate  
yourselves from this genera-  
tion of men I see that as a  
legitimate choice and I do  
not quarrel with it.  

But I am tired of seeing  
women who are working for fu-  
ture generations cast in the  
roles of oppressors them-  
selves or at best as colla-  
borators because they don't  
fit into what is to you an  
acceptable mold.  

I am also tired of sarcas-  
tic remarks about trying to...  
find "The Exceptional Man."  
Let me put it on the record  
right now--there is no such  
thing as an exceptional man.  
They are all too bound up in  
their own conditioning. At  
best, what a man can be right  
now is someone who knows what  
is--an oppressor--and doesn't  
like it. At best, what a man  
can be right now is someone  
who will admit he is confused  
and threatened by women but  
wants to keep the lines open  
for an attempt at compassion  
and hopefully love. At best,  
what a man can be right now  
is someone who will try not  
to say--"I understand," be-  
cause he knows he never can.  
This is the best a man can be  
right now; but exceptional--  
no way! So let me call off  
the search for this mythical  
beast.  

I'm not into devoting my  
energies to changing today's  
man either. That's his own  
job if it can be done. I  
guess my hope is for our sons  
and daughters to live as per-  
sons, not role players.  

Why do I live with a man  
then? The purpose of this  
letter is not to give apolo-  
gies for my own lifestyle so  
an explanation as such will  
not be given beyond this:  
the relationship we have is  
based on our common humanity.  
I refuse to devote my ener-  
gies to fighting roles in  

this relationship and that  
is well understood. And, as  
you are probably discovering,  
once roles are removed the  
possibility for a relation-  
ship based on human values  
can be realized. Further, I  
refuse to deny my own sexual  
preferences just as I support  
my gay sisters in their re-  
fusal to deny theirs.  

You may ask why I even con-  
cern myself with this ques-  
tion then. Why don't I just  
ignore the whole issue? I  
guess the love I felt for all  
my sisters in that room dur-  
ing The Season of the Witch  
is part of the reason I re-  
fuse to ignore it. I refuse  
to remove myself from any of  
my sisters who are struggling  
against oppression. If a se-  
paration occurs, it will be  
my gay sisters who will ini-  
tiate it. And the more I  
read, the more conferences I  
attend, the more workshops  
etc. I sit through, the more  
I realize that such a split  

is becoming more inevitable.  

It may be understandable  
but I have always felt, I  
felt that night, and I will  
always feel that we are wom-  
en--sisters truly--and all in  
this struggle together. We  
need each other. Any denial  
of our commonality hurts us  
all and drains power from the  
whole of the body of woman.  
That lost power doesn't drain  
off to any of the segments  
either. It drains from us  
directly to our oppressors.  

I guess the most painful  
outcome of this split will be  
the loss of too many real  
friends. That kind of loss  
leaves holes and I don't want  
that to happen.  

But if it does happen; if  
you must go to the Lesbian  
nation; if you must remove  
your support from me and re-  
fuse to take my support, then  
at least drop me a postcard  
now and then. Because I need  
you and I love you.
