Opting ---.

Staffing causes delay and
confusion, but reformation of
this Department is impera-
tive.

Women—very vocal and in
great numbers—must impress
their state legislators with
the necessity to adequately
fund the Human Rights De-
partment—and to follow up
with a convincing show of
commitment to the cause of
human rights.

As a result of filing a
sex discrimination charge, I
have learned a great deal a-
bout frustration in the face
of bureaucracy. And, iron-
ically, I have come to view
the entire process as fut-
ile—a meaningless act de-
fined by male standards. It
is utterly ridiculous to
spend two years, money I
could ill afford and emo-
tional reserves to prove that my
employer discriminated a-
gainst women.

Do fish swim? Does the
sun set?

Rather, I am arriving at
a yet ill-defined belief
that women—as a class—
must reform our environment.
We must go beyond the male
world.

I have no desire for an
equal opportunity to be
vice-president of widget
marketing. That is not e-
nough.

I hope I will find an
effective way to work with
other women to achieve a
reformation.

I will leave men at their
drawing boards, desks and
in their board rooms, howl-
ing at one another across
the void created by their
hatred and fear.

THE LONELY WOMAN

The lonely woman
she sits on a dark side
in her corner chair
glancing, every so often,
at the silhouette she has made.

Lonely woman
long hairs fallen to her waist
eyes dark with sadness
the tears coming only
as a last resort.

Lonely woman

listens to music

by those, she thinks, who have felt

the confusion of life to death—
soothing sounds of companionship.

Lonely woman
knows, the darkness will lift
like a great rock come from
a bleak time a'laying
in arms of Mother Nature.
