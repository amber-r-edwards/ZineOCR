Lack of funds and the stig-
ma of being branded “the
other rape center" has forced
the feminist-oriented Rape
Crisis Center to close its
doors for the summer, but
staff members have indicated
an intention to reopen the
service after extensive re-
organization.

Joan Orke and Diane Sjer-
ven, in announcing the cen-
ter's temporary closure, laid
the blame to the center's
image as the area's second
rape counseling service. A
rape center at the Neighbor-
hood Involvement Program
(NIP) clinic, a social ser-
vice project of several
churches, opened slightly
before the Rape Crisis Cen-
ter.

Because of the existence
of two apparently similar
centers, funding agencies
"don't want to fund us, be-
cause they think it's a du-
plication of services," com-
plained Sjerven. “From their
point of view, it may be--
but there's a real difference
in the way rape victims are
treated at the two centers.”

Orke and Sjerven related
for "Gold Flower" the com-
plicated series of events
which led, last winter, to
the almost simultaneous es-
tablishment of two rape cen-
ters in Minneapolis.

According to Orke, who has
been active since last fall
in the movement to aid rape
victims, a women's group at
that time decided to open an
advocacy service patterned
upon the Washington, D.C.,
rape center. One member of
the group arranged a meeting
with the NIP management, to
explore the possibility of
assistance from that group.

When after extensive meet-
ings it became evident that
the two groups had different
philosophic intent, the wo-
men's group withdrew from
the NIP collaboration and
continued its plans indepen-
dently. NIP, however, estab-
lished its own center, open-
ing last December.

The Rape Crisis Center
opened in January--"probably
too soon," Orke admitted.
"But we felt pressured to
supply this choice of ser-
vices to women.

"We believe that women who
are raped should be able to
determine what's going to
happen to her, that she
should not be automatically
referred to counseling. NIP
is a counseling center; we
are an advocacy service. And
we also approach the issue
from a feminist point of
view."

Rape Crisis Center volun-
teers serve as advocates for
rape victims at the hospital
and police station, should
the victim request this ser-
vice. Volunteers also have
supplied transportation for
rape victims to safety.
Neither of these services are
offered by the NIP center.

"The main difference be-
tween the centers is the long
range goals," Sjerven said.
"We're interested in social
change. NIP is interested
only in treating the sym-
ptoms."

Since January the Rape
Crisis Center has operated
out of the Women's Counsel-
ing Service at Lyndale Ave.
and Lake St. However, lack
of funds has necessitated a
move by that agency to smal-

Lack of funds forces Rape
Center to close temporari-

ler quarters, and the Rape
Crisis Center lost its free
office space as a result.
With no funding and the
sudden need to rent space
for the center, the Rape
Crisis Center staff elected
to shut down its services
pending reorganization.
"Basically we still feel
a need for a 24-hour answer-
ing service, and to provide
advocacy as well as counsel-
ing," Orke said. Other
hoped-for services include
a library of rape-related
research, compilation of
statistics on occurrence of
rape in the Twin Cities
area, and a public education
program.

Sociologist says
rapists plan
their assaults

A Detroit sociologist, Nor-
man S. Goldner, reported re-
cently that his studies show
most rapes to be planned by
the attacker, a contention
that calls into question sev-
eral common presuppositions
about the crime.

Goldner's research results
were released recently in a
report by Susan Fogg of New-
house News Service.

According to Goldner, "pro-
vocation by the victim only
needs to be minimal" when the
rapist is already determined
to commit the act. This runs
counter to the popular belief
that women are implicated in
the crime through their
arousal of their attacker's
sexual interest--a belief
that leads police to care-
fully question a victim as to
her attire and responses when
attacked.

Goldner reported the crime
to be generally premeditated,
rarely spontaneous. The Wayne
State sociologist found in
studies of the crime that
few rapists (only 18 percent)
leave their own neighborhoods
in search of victims, pre-
ferring instead to strike in
a familiar locale.

Calling rape "the only
crime I know of in which the
victim must prove herself in-
nocent," Goldner said, "The
victim's only complicity may
be that she turned up at the
wrong place at the wrong
time. The only provocation
may be something she can't
help--like her age."
