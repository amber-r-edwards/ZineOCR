year to determine the length  
of her longest and her short-  

est menstrual cycles. She  
can then use the chart (Table  
3) presented here to deter-  
mine which days are "unsafe."  
For example, if her shortest  
cycle during the year lasted  
25 days and her longest  
lasted 31, the first unsafe  
day (counting from the first  
day of menstruation) would  

be the seventh and the last  
unsafe day would be the  
twentieth. Thus, it would  

be necessary for her to ab-  
stain from intercourse, or  

to use some other contracep-  
tive method, for the two-  
week period. The length of  
time abstention is required  
is directly related to the  
degree of irregularity in  

the menstrual cycle. About  
15 percent of all women have  
cycles so irregular that  

they cannot use the rhythm  
method at all.  

Basal Body Temperature  
Method. This method is bas-  
ed on the fact that the re-  
lease of a ripe egg is as-  
sociated with a slight de-  
crease in body temperature.  

A day or two after the egg  

is released, the temperature  
rises again to 0.5-1.0 de-  
gree above normal. The temp-  
erature then remains the  

same until the next menstrual  
period. (See Figure 5.) If  
the woman waits until three  
days after the temperature  
rise has taken place, she  
can be sure that the egg has  
decomposed and that it is  
safe to have sexual relations  
for the duration of the  
cycle. It should be noted,  
however, that the temperature  
reading must be taken at  
about the same time every  
morning, before the woman  
gets out of bed or is active.  
Slight physiological changes,  
such as illness or nervous-  
ness, and sleeping under an  
electric blanket can affect  
the reading. Because the  
difference in temperature is  
slight, use of a special BBT  
thermometer is advised.  

Disadvantages of the rhy-  
thm method are: (a) a lack  
of effectiveness: if a hun-

dred women use the rhythm  
system extremely carefully  
for a year, about twenty-four  
will become pregnant;* (b)  
the necessity of keeping a  
record of physiological func-  
tions for a very long period  
(up to a year) before one  
can begin using the system;  
and (c) the need for long  
periods of abstinence. If  
one's cycle is perfectly reg-  
ular, it is necessary to ab-  
stain for a minimum of eight  
days out of each cycle.  

Douching  

Probably the least effec-  
tive of all "contraceptive"  
methods is douching. It en-  
tails flushing out the vagi-  
na with a solution, such as  
hot or cold water in which  
two tablespoons of vinegar  
or lemon juice have been dis-  
solved or with some commer-  
cially prepared spermicide.  
To be useful at all, douch-  
ing must be carried out im-  
mediately after intercourse.  
Estimates are that sperm  
make their way into the uter-  

us within three minutes  

after ejaculation, and once

the sperm are in the uterus,  
they cannot be washed away.  
Therefore, the effective-  

ness of douching as a con-  
traceptive is so low as to  
make it almost useless.**  

In fact, a douche actually  
can have the opposite of the  
desired effect: the pres-  
sure of the liquid may force  
sperm into the opening of  
the cervix. If a diaphragm  
or a vaginal spermicide has  
been used, a douche can  
neutralize the protective  
value and therefore should  
not be used until six to  
eight hours after inter-  
course.  

Douching is not necessary  
for vaginal hygiene. The  
vagina keeps itself clean  
through normal vaginal dis-  
charge.  

If, after reading all this,  
you still want to douche,  
syringes and commercial  
douching preparations can be  
purchased in drugstores or  
department stores for be-  
tween $2 and $5.
