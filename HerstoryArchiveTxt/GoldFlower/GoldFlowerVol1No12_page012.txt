No song played from the
jukebox now. And the stolid
silence pervaded, permeated,
everything in the room.
Standing alone in the corner
was the pinball machine, its
lights sending oddly shaped
shadows to dance and flicker
eerily on the walls.

She was sitting there,
slowly smoking a cigarette,
an empty Coke glass on the
counter beside her. Her
face was expressionless, but
her half-closed eyes hinted
at the depth of her weariness.

Occasionally the stillness
was broken by a low comment
from one of the persons
seated by the counter. Few
people were there now. And
all seemed to be absorbed in
their own, individual
thoughts.

All except Billy, who de-
cided to begin his nightly
teasing.

"Hey, B.D.," he said jok-
ingly, "Get any pussy last
night?"

She turned to look at him,
then replied: "Billy, fuck
off," in a half-irritated,
half-amused voice.

Unperturbed, he continued,
"B.D., you gonna chippie on
her? She give you enough
pussy?"

"Billy, FUCK OFF," she
replied, sharper this time.
Getting up from her stool,
she walked over to him,
hands on hips, and glared
into his chuckling face.

"Watch yourself, Billy,"
she said warningly, "You're
already barred from Sally's,
you know."

"Aw, B.D.," said Billy
plaintively, "I was only
kidding."

Then he paused, only to
look up at her a moment lat-
er with a grin on his face.

"Ya' still love me, B.D.?"
he softly teased.

"I'd love you more if you
shut your motherfuck-
ing mouth!" grumbled B.D.

But Billy knew she wasn't
angry with him. She rarely
got more than slightly ir-
ritated with his usual harm-
less banter and he knew how
far he could go with his
joking.

"NOW what the hell do you
want, Billy?"

"Trust me for a beer, will
ya?"

"BILLY!" she yelled, faking
her anger with him again.
Then she looked at him, her
eyes slightly twinkling, en-
joying the mock fight be-
tween them.

"Billy, you know I don't
trust anybody but myself,"
she stated.

"Nobody?" he asked, half-
seriously.

B.D. looked at him a long
time, then finally turned a-
way.

"Nope, Billy, only my-
self," she said, almost in-
audibly, her eyes toward the
window, gazing into the dark
night beyond.

Everyone had left the bar
by closing time. And B.D.
put out her last cigarette
for the night. She automati-
cally, almost mechanically,
emptied the ashtrays, then
rinsed out glasses left on
the counter. She looked at
the clock. 2:00 A.M. A
faintly discernible sigh
escaped from her as she
looked around, before walk-
ing out the door and lock-
ing it. Another Tuesday
night at the Seafish was
over.
