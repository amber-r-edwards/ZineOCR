A Glad  
Goodbye  

BY SUSAN CUSHMAN  

?  

There are men who muse about making accep-  
tance speeches, but letters of resignation  
are more often the stuff of women's dreams.  

Shortly after my initiation into the ranks  
of scurrying working women, I too adopted a  
characteristic preoccupation. It was not  
"How to beat the Boss," a little too opti-  
mistic for us in those days. Rather, and  
sadly, it was "How to keep the Boss from  
beating you."  

And really, there was only one way - to  
quit. Sure, you might see him on the street  
and be free to grin and disappear. Sure,  
you could do your slave bit for him at the  
office with a manufactured irony, hoping  
that he would notice and be ashamed.  

But these private tactics were too subtle  
to take any effect, and I repeatedly found  
myself imagining that I was not typing his  
letter, but my own, whooping out my glad  
goodbye.  

I didn't get around to actually doing it  
for months. There were bad days, and then  
not-so-bad ones, depending on how fast the  
hours went. When a better job loomed up,  
quite unexpectedly, I found that writing a  
resignation letter took only a few minutes,  
and didn't really resemble my precipitous  
practice runs.  

Riding on a small backwash of conversa-  
tional confidence, I thought I could say my  
parting views best in person, believing that  
a blood and flesh human being would be hard-  
er to ignore than a piece of paper. But it  
all depends on what kind of flesh that human  
being wears; the girl-flesh I was wearing  
did not exactly strike dangerous honesty in-  
to the heart of my well-protected Boss.  

Our Man in Personnel hesitantly accepted  
my request for an exit interview. I had the  
backing of several women who were not leav-  
ing, who hoped I could ease their coming  
days by dredging up their multiple discon-  
tents from the depths of the corporate con-  
science.  

As I was escorted into his office, I deci-  
ded to assume a tentative approach and  
phrased the broad problems of working women  
in the narrower terms of educated women  
within his company.  

I could have spared him my delicacy. One  
thing frontrunning feminists have brought on  
all of us is instant visibility; experienced  
men like this personnel Boss now scent out  
"liberated women" as eagerly as government  
committees once tracked down past, present,  
and future Communists.  

So the statistics flew from his corner of  
the room into mine, followed shortly by apt  
comparisons. We spoke “relatively“ for a  
time. Despite my low-key opener, he hit me  
with the high notes, sounding out the cor-  
porate defense with rapid-fire trills of in-  

nocence: "We try...you just don't know...  
other companies...this is a business world.  
growth...you can't expect..."  

I sat tight, maybe too tight. I suggested  
that we not talk about the triumphant ap-  
pointment of a woman to head teller after  
she had held the job for five years but not  
the title. Maybe we should consider what  
happened to the average woman in the com-  
pany, I said, as compared to the average  
man.  

Not a valid comparison I was told. Let's  
compare women's positions in our institution  
to those of women in other companies.  

It wasn't as if I hadn't been in circles  
before. But my ears began to churn and my  
throat swallowed when I didn't want it to.  
How could all my forthright intentions and  
painfully acquired knowledge be swallowed so  
effortlessly, without even riling the Boss'  
digestion? We were both in corners of the  

room, but it was easy to see who had trapped  
who.  

I didn't get anywhere that afternoon, and  
I lost a dose of confidence somewhere in  
that predictable contest. We still cannot  
take men on in their own territory, where  
their rules go, and ours stay hidden or mis-  
understood.  

In parting, the Boss said, "I don't have  
to listen to you because you're atypical,  
coming here and talking to me like this."  

I said, equally in parting, "If I had been  
typical, and not come to talk to you, then  
you'd have to listen to me? Is that what  
you mean?"  

"Yes, that's about it."  

And so it was.
