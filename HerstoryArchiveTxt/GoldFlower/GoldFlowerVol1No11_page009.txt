Contraception  

A variety of techniques is  
employed to prevent pregnan-  
cy when sexual contact oc-  
curs. These all share the  
label "contraceptive," but  
they differ widely in the  
way they work and in their  
convenience, cost, and ef-  
fectiveness. Table 1 shows  
the degrees of effectiveness  
of the contraceptive methods  
discussed in this manual.  

In this section several  
methods are discussed along  
with their advantages and  
disadvantages. Furthermore,  
some "nonmethods," or tech-  
niques that are employed for  
the purpose of contraception  
but are ineffective, are de-  
scribed.  

The Dilemma of Preplanning  

Frequently high-school-age  
and college-age women are  
just beginning to be sexual-  
ly active. Moreover, they  
are at a time in their lives  
when they often have not ar-  
rived at a stable relation-  
ship and, therefore, may not  
have a single, permanent  
sexual partner. These two  
conditions combine to create  
a situation wherein many wo-  
men do not know whether they  
will be engaging in sexual  
intercourse the following  
month, week, or day. Some-  
times women conclude from  
this uncertainty that they  
should not prepare them-  
selves for, or protect them-  
selves from the results of,  
sexual intercourse, because  
it would somehow indicate  
that they are promiscuous.  
Tied in with this concept is  
the notion that "nice girls"

don't voluntarily submit to  
sexual relations, that they  
are pressured into them. In  
response to this, one can  
only say that in our society  
the burden of contraception  
typically falls on the fe-  
male and that women who do  
not assume this burden are  
usually women who get preg-  
nant. It is, of course,  
true that a few women may  
engage in intercourse the  
first time without having  
any idea beforehand that in-  
tercourse would take place,  
but after the first sexual  
act if not before, a woman  
should inform and prepare  
herself for future contra-  
ception. Preplanning may be  
temporarily damaging to  
one's self-image, but preg-  
nancies out of wedlock,  
which accounted for one-  
eighth of the children born  
in Seattle in 1968, are of-  
ten damaging to lives in  
more permanent and costly  
ways.  

This is not to imply that  
the burden of contraception  
should always fall on the  
female. Morally, men have  
an obligation to protect  
themselves and their partner  
and they should share the  
effort involved in success-  
ful contraceptive planning.  
(But don't count on it!)  

Birth Control Pills  

"The pill," which is al-  
most 100 percent effective  
when taken as instructed,  
produces a state of pseudo  
(or false) pregnancy in the  
body and thus prevents ovu-  
lation. There are two types  
of oral contraceptives, and

*Effectiveness of contraceptive methods is  
measured by the number of women who would be-  

the method for one year. :  
For example, for  
every 100 women using sequential birth-con-  
trol pills for one year, 1.4 women would be-

of Contraception  

one days of her menstrual  
cycle, starting on the fifth  
day after menses. One type  
is the combination, contain-  
ing both estrogen and pro-  
gestin.* The other type is  
the sequential pill. Its  
name derives from the fact  
that for the first fifteen  
days following menses the  
woman takes a pill contain-  
ing just estrogen, followed  
by five pills containing  
both estrogen and progestin.  
The sequentials have been  
shown to be less effective  
and somewhat more hazardous  
than the combination pill.  
The pill frequently has  
side effects that may be  
negative, positive, or neu-  
tral. For the most part,  
these same side effects are  
associated with pregnancy.  
It may clear up the complex-  
ion, may prompt a small gain  
in weight, and may enlarge  
the breasts slightly. Its  
use also may be associated  
with increased or diminished  
sexual desire. Some clear  
advantages of the pill:  
1. It is easy to use and is  
believed to be the most ef-  
fective method, PROVIDED IT  
IS TAKEN DAILY!  
2. It is one of very few  
contraceptives that is inde-  
pendent of the sex act:  
nothing need be done immedi-  
ately before, during, or af-  
ter intercourse.  
3. It is not subject to  
those errors of use that of-  
ten affect the reliability  
of the mechanical methods  
after sexual interest has  
been aroused.
