The National Black Feminist  
Organization held its first  
meeting in New York City in  
December. The information  
below expresses viewpoints  
from that conference.  

Statement  
of Purpose  

The distorted male-dominated  
media image of the Women's  
Liberation Movement has  
clouded the vital and revol-  
utionary importance of this  
movement to Third World wo-  
men, especially Black women.  
The Movement has been char-  
acterized as the exclusive  
property of so-called "white  
middle class" women and any  
Black women seen involved in  
this movement have been seen  
as "selling out," "dividing  
the race" and an assortment  
of nonsensical epithets.  
Black Feminists resent these  
charges and have therefore  
established THE NATIONAL  
BLACK FEMINIST ORGANIZATION,  
in order to address ourselves  
to the particular and speci-  
fic needs of the larger, but  
almost cast aside half of the  
Black race in Amerikka, the  
Black Woman.  

Black women have suffered  
cruelly in this society from  
living the phenomenon of  
being Black and female, in a  
country that is both racist  
and sexist. There has been  
very little real examination  
of the damage it has caused  
on the lives and on the minds  
of Black women. Because we  
live in a patriarchy, we have  
allowed a premium to be put  
on Black male suffering. No  
one of us would minimize the  
pain or hardship or the cruel  
and inhumane treatment ex-  
perienced by the Black man.  
But history, past or present,  
rarely deals with the mali-  

cious abuse put upon Black  
women. We were seen as  
breeders by the master; de-  
spised and historically po-  
larized from/by the master's  
wife; and looked upon as  
castrators by our lovers and  
husbands. The Black woman  

has had to be strong, yet we  
are persecuted for having  

survived. We have been  
called "matriarchs" by white  
racists and Black nation-  
alists; we have virtually no  
positive self-images to vali-  
date our existence. Black  
women want to be proud, dig-  
nified and free from all  
those false definitions of  
beauty and womanhood that  
are unrealistic and unnatur-  
al. We, not white men or  
Black men, must define our  
own self-image as Black wo-  
men and not fall into the  
mistake of being placed upon  
the pedestal—which is even  
being rejected by white wo-  
men. It has been hard for  
Black women to emerge from  
the myriad of distorted imag-  
es that have portrayed us as  
grinning Beulahs, castrating  
Sapphires and pancake box  
Jemimahs. As Black Femin-  
ists we realized the need to  
establish ourselves as an  
independent Black Feminist  
organization. Our above  
ground presence will lend  
enormous credibility to the  
current Women's Liberation  
Movement, which unfortunate-  

The Myth of Black  

Starting Toward A  

ly is not seen as the  

serious political and econom-  
ic revolutionary force that  
it is. We will strengthen  
the current efforts of the  
Black Liberation struggle in  
this country by encouraging  
all of the talents and crea-  
tivities of Black women to  
emerge, strong and beautiful,  
not to feel guilty or divisive,  
and assume positions of  
leadership and honor in the  
Black community. We will  
encourage the Black communi-  
ty to stop falling into the  
trap of the white male Left,  
utilizing women only in terms  
of domestic or servile needs.  
We will continue to remind  
the Black Liberation Movement  
that there can't be libera-  
tion for half the race. We  
must together, as a people,  
work to eliminate racism from  
without the Black community  
which is trying to destroy us  
as an entire people, but we  
must remember that sexism is  
destroying and crippling us  
from within.
