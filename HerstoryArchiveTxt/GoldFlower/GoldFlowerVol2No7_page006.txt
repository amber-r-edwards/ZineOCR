Strength in Powerlessness

Sister Annabelle Raiche,  
Chair of the Education Depart-  
ment at the College of St.  
Catherine, St. Paul, went to  
the University of San Francis-  
co for a Symposium on Ignatian  
Spirituality July 15-31.  

July 31 she went to jail.  

It started out as a day of  
solidarity with the United  
Farm Workers for the partici-  
pants in the symposium. Ninety-  
five priests and nuns went  
to Parlier to support the UFW  
as observers. They were greeted  
by Cesar Chavez, who asked  
if they had the time and the  
commitment to join the picket  
line.  

"That's when I decided I  
would join them," Sister Anna-  
belle said, even though they  
knew they would be imprisoned  
for an indefinite period of  
time. Sixteen sisters and  
sixteen priests joined about  
300 other people to form pick-  
et lines on two nectarine  
ranches.  

The picketers formed a line  
facing a line of ranch owners.  
"You could tell they were very  
frightened men," Sister Anna-  
belle said, by the sticks,  
crowbars, and rubber hoses that  
they carried, and by the two  
unleashed dogs with them. The  
picketers carried nothing.  
They were silent, sang hymns,  
or chanted prayers. From time  
to time they spoke to the  
scabs working in the fields,  
trying to call them out. They  
persuaded four of the workers  
to leave.  

After about four hours, the  
police began arresting them.  

A policewoman began reading  
the women their charges. The  
Chicanas, experienced in be-  
ing arrested, shouted during  
the reading so they would not  
hear their charges, and would  
be illegally arrested.  

The picketers were taken to  
the Fresno County Industrial  
Farm where they were frisked,  
fingerprinted, and photographed.  
After two days of waiting,  
they were arraigned for  
"riot, rout, disorderly con-  
duct, and unlawful assembly."

At dusk when the bluffs burn red,  

and the trees are assembled for vespers,  
he comes to feed the birds,  

priest of crusts and seeds.  

His service suspends the fading day;  

the light in the kitchen dims,  

from my hands down the black sink drain.

The UFW's lawyers pleaded “not  
guilty." They were judged not  
trustworthy to be released on  
their own recognizance. Bail  
was set at $400.  

In the prison, "we set our  
own pattern of life; no day  
ever dragged." There was al-  

ways cleaning, praying, read-  
ing, or some sort of activity  
in progress.  

Cesar Chavez  

Sister Annabelle Raiche  

had told the nuns, “Ask the  
women what their life is  
like." Sister Annabelle took  
his advice.  

There was Petra. She was 29  
years old and had seven child-  
ren. Her day started at 3 a.m.,  
when she rose to do the clean-  
ing and cooking. After break-  
fast the family went to the  
fields. When supper ended the  
long day, it was time for bed.  
Petra said, "The only time we  
have together is on Sunday af-  
ter Mass."  

The strength of the farm wor-  
kers is exemplified by a woman  
named Estafana. She is the  
mother of 8 children, the  
youngest 6 months old. She  
was feverishly ill when she  
was in jail. The Farm Workers  
doctor told her she should go  
straight to bed and stay  
there. After the doctor saw  
her, the prison officials  

brought her to their office  
and tried to convince her to  
leave the prison. (Everyone  
had agreed that, as a sign of  
unity, no one would leave the  
prison unless they all did.)  
Estafana, in spite of her ill-  
ness, in spite of her child-  
ren, withstood twenty minutes  
of persuasion and refused to  
leave without the others.  

Sister Annabelle and the  
rest of the prisoners were re-  
leased on August 13 at 12:30  
a.m. A sister from her commu-  
nity in the Los Angeles pro-  
vince met her in a park and  
drove her to her convent where  
she spent the rest of  
the night.  

Sister Annabelle says,  
"It's left its mark on me,"  
and is still leaving its mark.  
As an educator, she noticed  
that although the Chicanas  
were largely illiterate, they  
were in many ways more educa-  
ted than she was. This was  
first brought home to her by  

the realization that she  
could not speak to them in  
their language, but they  
could speak to her in hers.  
About half the women were bi-  
lingual.  

She said the women knew a-  
bout the movement they were  
involved in ("la causa") and  
could speak about it articu-  
lately. Their leader was 19-  
year-old Gloria, who could  
translate instantaneously,  
and did so when people of ei-  
ther language visited.  

Although there were 54 wo-  
men in one barracks where they  
lived in dormitory style with  
little physical privacy, the  
Chicanas afforded each other  
an adequate measure of "psy-  
chic privacy." "I never felt  
crowded or that my privacy was  
being infringed upon," said  
Sister Annabelle.  

The experience made her  
think about the strength that  
comes from powerlessness. It  
is the will to make a better  
life, the freedom from mater-  
ial possessions. It is the  
strength that comes from hav-  
ing nothing to lose.

he seems only motion, and I see  

and death,  

sucked  

time as shadows against the hills  

a dry curl of white birch.  
He stands at the edge of the yard  

and his silence tumbles us  

into the awesome gauze of the sky.  
Then do I become one with his worship;  
with the birds at their bath,  

and the oaks on their knees,  

warm as though orbed by his arms.
