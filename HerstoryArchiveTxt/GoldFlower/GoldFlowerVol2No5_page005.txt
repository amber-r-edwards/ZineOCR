Credit Where Due

An Interview with Betty

These are times when refer-
ences to women's "lib" and
"libbers" bespatter our daily
newspapers, yet our ageless
institutions continue grind-
ing their wheels as if the
myth of the weaker sex were
still intact. Credit grant-
ing institutions are among
the most oblivious.

New credit rulings went
into effect on August 1
which should sharpen their
sense of reality. I talked
with Betty Howard, Director
of the Women's Division of
the State Department of Human
Rights to find out what we
can expect from these provi-
sions.

HOW DO THE NEW RULINGS APPLY
TO WOMEN?

Actually, they're intended
to apply to anyone who has
experienced discrimination on
the basis of credit because
of sex. Obviously, women
have been the people who
have suffered most when they
seek credit. But it's pos-
sible that the "other sex"
might suffer too.

Women who are seeking cre-
dit will be treated fairly
under the new provisions if
the people who are dealing
with her know and abide by
the law...and we certainly
hope they will.

Women and men under the new
provisions must be treated
fairly on the basis of their
ability to meet the estab-
lished criteria, and not with
regard to sex which has hap-
pened in the past. And mari-
tal status too has affected
an individual's right, or op-
portunity, rather, to obtain
credit.

ON WHAT BASIS HAVE WOMEN BEEN
DENIED CREDIT IN THE PAST?

I can tell you what was
said to me a year ago when I
was interviewing some major
credit grantors and officials
of the credit bureaus. When
I asked a similar question,
it appears that people who
grant credit, and the large
majority of these are males,
assume that a woman's parti-
cipation in the labor force
is a temporary thing that ex-
ists only prior to her having
a family. This assumption is
contrary to the statistics of
the Department of Labor of
the United States Government
which indicate that over 40%
of the labor force consists

of women who work an average
of 25 years, whether or not
they're married and whether
or not they have children.

At that time I expressed
the thought that men, parti-
cularly those engaged in the
credit granting business,
needed to be brought into the
twentieth century. One of
the things that was said to
me that is particularly...
amazing in the adjective I'll
use...is that if a woman was
in her childbearing years,
and particularly if she was
younger and attractive, her
chances for getting credit
were reduced correspondingly.
I see by the look on your
face that you react as I do
to that.

You know, at the time I
said, "Have they ever heard
about the Pill, family plan-
ning?" Actually I suppose
they have, because many women

(when applying for mortgages
with their husbands) have
been asked to sign a state-
ment describing the type of
contraceptive being used and
saying that they do not in-
tend to have children. Can
you imagine anything more
demeaning?

ARE THEY OBLIGATED TO SIGN
STATEMENTS LIKE THAT?

People have been asked to
sign them. Obligated? You
know, when you want a loan
and the guy that's going to
give it to you sits there and
asks you these questions....
Now, that would be illegal,
unless they ask the same
question of men. You must
understand that when you're
dealing with sex discrimina-
tion what you're saying is
that one sex cannot be treat-

ed differently from the other.

So if a major lending insti-
tution would persist in ask-
ing that question of women,
it would also have to ask it
of men. Then it wouldn't be
discriminatory. Well, you
and I both know that they're
not going to ask men that
question.

TAKE THE CASE OF A WOMAN WHO
IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A LONG,
UNRESOLVED DIVORCE. HOW
MIGHT HER UNSTABLE MARITAL
STATUS AFFECT HER APPLICATION
FOR CREDIT?

Now, fortunately, if she
deserves credit and can dem-
onstrate her financial abil-
ity to meet her obligations,

her marital status should

not affect her credit ability.
But it's happened in the past
and I assume that it's going
to take some time for all of
the people who are in the po-
sition of granting credit to
become familiar with the new
provisions and to accept them.
There may be some built-in
resistance to people who
have operated

resistance to people who

have operated under another
set of beliefs for a long,
long time. In other words,
we're bucking up against tra-
dition, the same old stereo-
types.

But what has happened in
the past, and I was told this
by both major credit bureaus,
is that no matter how long
the woman had been married
and how involved she was in
handling the financial obli-
gations of her family and how
good that credit rating was,
probably due to her efforts...
if she were divorced, this
good credit rating would go
with the husband. She would
be a non-person as far as
credit was concerned. Now,
for the sad part...if the
family had had a bad credit
rating, this would follow her
to her new file.

WOULD IT FOLLOW THE HUSBAND
ALSO?

Supposedly, although I do
know of a case where the
husband went bankrupt. He
had a business which failed,
while the wife had a profes-
sional job. She undertook
the responsibility of paying
off the debts. That's some-
thing people don't under-
stand. A wife is responsi-
ble for her husband's bad
debts just as the husband is
responsible for his wife's
bad debts. You never hear a-
bout that, but it's the law
in Minnesota.

What happened in this par-
ticular case is that the hus-
band went through bankruptcy
and was able to open up an-
other business with the slate
wiped clean. Her record re-
mained with all these blem-
ishes because she had under-
taken to repay all the debts.
So there's been a tremendous
number of inequities which
hopefully will not occur
under the new law.

There are two sections of
this law that apply to people
being able to obtain credit
without discrimination based
