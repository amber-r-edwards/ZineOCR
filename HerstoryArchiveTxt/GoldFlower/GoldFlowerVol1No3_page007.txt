There is a young woman named

Mary

Who finds the world quite  
contrary

Tho' smarter than Bob

They both found a job  
Now Mary is Bob's secretary

We've all seen it happen.  
Bright boy graduates go on  
Management training programs;  
bright girl graduates go to  
secretarial school. If they  
are good little secretaries,  
they may advance to the po-  
sition of executive secretary  
--that is, secretary to an  
executive. They will seldom  
if ever become executives  
themselves.

Take heart, sisters. New  
federal guidelines designed  
to correct this and other  
injustices go into effect  
soon. Under the new provi-  
sions (Department of Labor  
Order #4 under Title 41 of  
the Civil Rights Act of 1964,  
amended to include women as  
of March 4), compliance with  
the clause forbidding dis-  
crimination on the basis of  
sex will no longer be volun-  
tary. That is, it can no  
longer be ignored.

Employers with 50 or more  
employees and a government  
contract of $50,000 or more  
must develop written pro-  
grams of affirmative action.  
This means that each such  
employer must appoint a  
specific person responsible  
for administering the pro-

Kate Millett has turned to  
the cinema. Her first film,  
Three Lives, is exciting and  
successful. The film is a  
confrontation with three wo-  
men: Mallory Millett-Jones,  
Kate's younger sister, divor-  
ced, in her 30's, mother of a  
small child; Lillian Shreve,  
a friend of Kate's, in mid-  
60's, who is looking for a  
new productive identity  
after having spent a life at  
child rearing; Robin Mide,

What New Federal Guidelines Can Mean to Working Women

gram through the entire com-  
pany.

After issuing a policy  
statement affirming his sup-  
port of equal employment,  
and disseminating it widely,  
he must then undertake an  
exhaustive analysis of his  
company, in order to deter-  
mine the problem areas.  
Problem areas are defined as  
those in which members of  
the affected class (in this  
case women) are not properly  
represented, or where mem-  
bers of that class are under-  
utilized.

Once the problem areas are  
identified, the employer is  
required to develop a pro-  
gram stating what he plans  
to do to correct the situa-  
tion, and when, exactly, he  
plans to do it.

Some of the things he must  
do in the line of corrective  
action are to find out how  
many members of the affected  
class are available for em-  
ployment and their propor-  
tions in the population, con-  
tact all available community  
sources dealing with the af-  
fected class, actively re-  
cruit members of that class  
by advertising in minority  
newspapers, etc., and pro-  
mote, transfer, and train  
members of the affected  
class within the company.

The man who, with a staff  
of two, is responsible for  
all of this and more being  
done in regard to women, as  
well as racial, ethnic, and  
religious minorities in all  
affected industries in a  
three-state area, is Depart-  
ment of Defense Compliance  
Officer Ray Eiland.

also a friend of Kate's, a  
young woman in the counter-  
culture, involved in theatre,

brilliant, fantastic,

neat people. All are seeking  
to integrate themselves  
into their worlds in new  
ways and all are struggling  
through various forms of  
identity crisis.

The film is very personal  
and marks a shift in dir-  
ection from the Millett we

that the guidelines give in-  
dustries ample room for de-  
lay while they spend years  
preparing analyses hundreds  
of pages long and launch  
massive surveys to deter-  
mine the number of women in  
Bloomington, Minnesota.

He feels that the most  
realistic possibilities at  
present lie in the area of  
getting those thousands of  
overqualified women out of  
dead-end jobs and into the in-  
dustrial mainstream.

He plans to do this by  
matching up the records of  
women in the company (Mary  
Doe, aged 32, M.A. English  
Lit., perfect work record,  

9 years in the typing pool),  
with job descriptions in that  
same company, and the records  
of people now holding those  
jobs. It is awfully easy  
for a company to say that  
Mary can't be promoted to  
eighth assistant vice-presi-  
dent because that position  
requires a Ph.D. and 17  
years of experience, until  
you find that the guy who  
has the job now came in with  
one semester of college and  
two years in the Marine  
Corps.

Ultimately, the goal of  
this directive is to make a  
cross-section of industry  
match up with a cross-sec-  
tion of the local population  
of appropriate age. Admit-  
tedly most of this is a dis-  
tant vision at best.

It will require time,  
training, endless clarifica-  
tions from Washington, and a  
good deal of industrial con-  
sciousness raising.

Getting Mary out of the  
typing pool, however, is a  
very good place to start.

often glib in tone and  
necessarily hostile. Three  
Lives is very relaxed and  
open. Millett maintains the  
compare and contrast format  
she used in Sexual Politics;  
the use of in-depth studies  
of three different person-  
alities. In the movie, how-  
ever, she focuses down to  
the friendly world of her  
own personal environment.  
The people she looks at she  
knows and loves. She wants  
to experience them instead  
of abstracting from them.  
"Experience" is a key:
