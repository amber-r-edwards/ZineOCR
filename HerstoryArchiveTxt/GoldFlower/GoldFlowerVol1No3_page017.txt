Hatshepsut, the Pacifist Pharaoh

(Continuing to investigate
individual women of the past
who left autobiographical
records.)

Egypt had several female
rulers during its history,
beginning in the first dy-
nasty with Nit-hotep, and
ending with Egypt's last
Pharaoh, Cleopatra. The
pacifist Hatshepsut is in-
teresting because her career
indicates women may some-
times run the same "machin-
ery" as men do, with differ-
ent results. Further inves-
tigation may tell how much
Hatshepsut's career was due
to female support. My major
source has been Evelyn
Wells' Hatshepsut (Doubleday
& Co., Garden City, NY, at
Mols. Public and U. of Minn.
libraries). Wells minimizes
the existence of other fe-
male Pharaohs, but is other-
wise accurate and readable.
Books by Alan Gardiner and
E.W. Budge have also been
used. . :

One cannot understand Hat-
shepsut outside of her con-
text, and especially the
story of her family. Her
dynasty was unusually war-
like, getting its start in
a war of national libera-
tion against the Hyksos in-
vaders. In this rebellion
Hatshepsut's female ancest-
ors played an important
part.

Tetisheri was the first
of these strong women. She
was not fully royal by des-
cent, and was Queen of a
puppet Pharaoh set up by the
Hyksos. Her children
Sekenre and Ahotep I began
the rebellion against the
Hyksos. (At least in this
dynasty, the simplest in-
terpretation of royal suc-
cession is that the oldest
daughter of the Queen was
the heiress; her husband
became Pharaoh.)

Pharaoh Sekenre evidently
died in battle (his mummy
has five ugly-looking head
wounds.) Ahotep I and her
mother Tetisheri kept the
rebellion going. Ahotep's
son Kamose died after a
losing battle. Then another
son, Amose (married to the
heiress Amose-Nefertari)
succeeded in driving out the
Hyksos. He set up garrisons

in Palestine as a first line

of defense against any fu-
ture invaders. Wells
writes: "Amose recorded his
deep love for the women of
his family...gave them au-

thoritative powers that
equaled his own." (p. 35)

Ahotep I was a remarkable
woman who may have played a
very active role as rebel
leader. Her son Amose wrote
of her: "...one who cares
for Egypt...who has looked
after her (Egypt's) soldiers;
she has guarded her; she has
brought back her fugitives
and called together her de-
serters; she has pacified
Upper Egypt and expelled her
rebels." (Quoted in Wells,

p. 36)

Ahotep's daughter Amose-
Nefertari (married Amose the
liberator) was taller than
her husband, and it is re-
corded that she helped in all
important state acts. Her
daughter was Ahotep II, who
married her full brother
Amonhotep I. Amonhotep con-
tinued the trend toward for-
eign wars by annexing Kush
(south of Egypt). Ahotep II
and Amonhotep were Hatshep-
sut's grandparents.

The daughter of Ahotep II
was Queen Amose who married
her half-brother, Thothmes I.
Their daughter Hatshepsut was
born sometime before 1500 BC.
The name Hatshepsut means
"Chieftainess of Noble Wo-
men."

As a child, Hatshepsut
dressed in male clothing.
One may only speculate why,
but remember Thothmes' only
claim to the throne was
through Amose the Queen. A
warrior-king, he was the
first to lead campaigns
through much of a long reign.
While he was fighting for-
eign wars, Amose was probab-
ly the effective ruler of
the country. Wells implies
Hatshepsut was a tomboy be-
cause she was her father's
favorite. Might it have
been that her mother, the
gentle Amose, prepared her
for a more important role?
Did Amose, did Egyptian wo-
men in general, oppose the
new warfare and the begin-
nings of empire? Did they
hope to install Hatshepsut
as Pharaoh to return Egypt
to its old peace-loving
ways?

Wells asks: "Thothmes I...

‘was one of the greatest of

Egypt's line of warrior
kings. How was it that his
daughter Hatshepsut was to
become her country's out-
standing protagonist of
peace?" (p. 63)

Some years before he died,

Thothmes I named Hatshepsut
Crown Prince, Pharaoh-to-be.

Shortly after her mother
Amose died, he made Hat-
shepsut co-ruler. Wells
treats these as daring, in-
novative actions. I don't
think we can read our male-
dominated society into an-
cient Egypt. Egypt had had
female Pharaohs, and would
have them again. Egyptian
women were at least as free
as we are. One record says
that should a male acquire
any property, he must im-
mediately turn it over to
his wife. What is more,
Egyptian daughters, not
sons, were required to sup-
port aged parents.

After her father died,
Hatshepsut first ruled a-
lone, then chose her half-
brother Thothmes II as hus-
band. He played a subser-
vient role in the state,
paid a good deal of atten-
tion to his appearance, and
was the father of Hatshep-
sut's two daughters.

Hatshepsut evidently con-
tinued to direct the coun-
try. At this time she be-
gan many building projects,
including the great temple
at Deir el-Bahari, whose
pillars still rise, tier on
tier, against the cliff.
Egyptian buildings were not
built with slave labor, but
by workmen (professionals)
and by laborers recruited
to work while the fields
were flooded.

Sennemut, her architect,
was born poor. Egypt was a
class society, but education
was available to all, and
promotion was on a merit ba-
sis, so there was social mo-
bility. Hatshepsut records
her love for Sennemut, but
not clearly enough for us to
say they were lovers.

Thothmes II died, but not
before fathering a son,
Thothmes III, born to a
secondary wife. For two
years Hatshepsut ruled as
regent of her stepson,
Thothmes III, who had been
married to her daughter.

Then Hatshepsut declared
the god Amon had told her to
take the crown as Pharaoh.
She continued to wear male
clothing, adding the false
golden beard that symbolized
kingship.

To celebrate her Sed-
festival, at which the magi-
cal power of Pharaoh was re-
newed, she erected two great
obelisks, each nearly 100
feet high and weighing over
