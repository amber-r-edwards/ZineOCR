sex discrimination, continued from page </

box. In it lay an envelope bearing the blue
Minnesota State Department of Human Rights
seal. I returned to work, high on adrenaline,
and awaited a confrontation. Nothing hap-
pened. All day I studied my supervisor.

His milky eyes were blank. I weighed the
mechanical, furry greetings of the corporate
executives. (This was an intimate company.)
Nothing there.

By evening I was in a frenzy. I drove my
friends wild with conjecture: Would the
company treat my charge with lofty disdain
not even deigning to acknowledge it? Were
they plotting some stunning reprisal? I
awaited morning when I was called into my
supervisor's office. He informed me in a
choked tone that he had received a copy

of the "suit". (From here on for the next
year and a half, all company officials re-
ferred to my charge as a "suit". This pe-
culiarity of speech may or may not reveal
something about the male human being.)

My supervisor's eyes were not blank now.
They were filled with hatred and something
new: respect.

women; what we have to share is private and
intimate and intended for women only.”
