Virgo, "The Virgin," has

produced few women of renown.

This is not surprising, as
this retiring sign is dedi-
cated to selfless service.
When we do find famous
Virgo women, they are like-
ly to be like social acti-
vists Jane Addams and Mar-
garet Sanger,
the underdog

birth control movement).
That these two women gained
fame through not seeking it
directly is appropriate as
well, for those born under
this sign are uncomfortable
with direct self-assertion.
Born under the zodiac's
sixth sign, the cautious and
hesitating Virgo woman is
further encouraged by social
conditioning to subject her-
self to others. The Virgo-
born are perfectionists who
seek order in their surroun-
dings; for the Virgo woman,
this often takes the form
of fanatic housecleaning and
slavish devotion to her fam-
ily. Society encourages the
Virgo woman to perform this
role; because it fills some
of her own needs, she
accepts it.

Q,

Virgo woman is encouraged to
develop her most negative
qualities: to sublimate her
passions, to dedicate her-
self wholly to others, to
modestly aid her "superiors"
without aiming at advance-
ment. This kind of Virgo
woman makes the perfect
secretary, nurse or house-
wife; she is neat, orderly,
restrained and unassuming.
She is also vaguely dis-
content, although not often
able to articulate her com-
plaints.

Looking over the impres-
sive list of Virgo women who,
while not household words,
established themselves as
leaders in their field, we
find that--like Sanger and
Addams--they chose fields
which fulfilled their need to
serve while not restricting
them to the file cabinet or
dust mop. There's Margaret
Anderson Watts, who founded a
home for indigent women; ed-
ucator Celestia Susannah Par-
rish; kindergarten organizer
Margarethe Meyer Schwez;
children's writer Rachel
Lyman Field; Sophia Smith,
founder of Smith College. An
impressive list, and one
which suggests that the Virgo
need not restrict herself to

by arcotts

servility, that the rendering
of service need not be done
at the expense of self-res-
pect.

The Virgo woman's sexuali-
ty is strong, though in our
restrictive society it is
often unexpressed or inhibi-
ted. An earth sign, Virgo's
reputed "barrenness" is that
of fields after harvest;
hers is a full and settled
sexuality that can lie dor-
mant until the proper con-
ditions present themselves.
Fastidious and sensitive
to nuance, the Virgo woman
can be discouraged by care-
less love-making; her sur-
prisingly strong sex drive
can then be sublimated into
an exaggeration of her Virgo
traits, producing a neuroti-
cally puritanical attitude.
In a society which encourages
her to develop her least
affirmative qualities, the
Virgo woman faces a challenge
indeed.

Other women born under
Virgo include "Grandma" Mo-
ses, Anna Ella Carroll, Irene
Lewisohn, Alice Stone Black-
well, Caroline Hamilton Pier,
Dame Edith Sitwell, Hilda
Doolittle (HD) and Mary God-
win Shelley.

talking to one strong woman in the group and
calling her 'president', etc. The idea
seems to have lost some humor in the transi-
tion. There were to be three stars, who
were picked by lottery, and they were to
have no vote as to the policy they represent.
Amazingly enough, the only person who cared
to be the star was none other than Ms. Byrd.
She has violated the spirit in which Minne-
sota Feminists accepted the idea, and
furthermore has been out of town for a week
at a time when the press wished to reach
her. We may as well be calling her Madame
President. Because the whole idea is oppos-
ed to the democratic ideals of feminism, and
because its power has been abused from its
inception, I am opposed to it.

We have all learned many lessons from
this power grab. Partly that the Women's
movement is not immune to cheap political
shenanigans, and that victims tend to come
from a time-honored list of outgroups: pick
your own scapegoat. We must continue to
struggle to keep the women's movement non-
exclusive, because too many of us are poten-
tial victims of exclusiveness. The big
lesson I have been forced to accept from my
formerly beloved sister, is that a woman's
politics have nothing to do with her inte-
grity.

There's going to be a "cooperative" con-
ference on Sept. 28-30 in Mpls. People from:
all over will be there and who knows what
will happen. Most of the workshops will be
planned when everyone gets to the People's
Center, 20th and Riverside, on Fri. night.

I work at a food coop and the only reason
I'm planning to go is because some women
will be organizing, probably around noon Sat
(place to be arranged). We are hoping that
we can meet each other and share our experi-
ences as women working in coops.

There are lots of women doing lots of hard
work in the coops. There are lots who used
to work in coops. And there are women who
have intentionally stayed away from coop
involvement. From what I know, even though
many women want to work cooperatively, the
coops are still traditionally sexist and may
keep many women away. I find this showing
up especially in the way people at our coop
talk to each other at meetings.

Although there is a lot more that I could
say, as a feminist, about my own coop exper-
iences, I would rather not write about it by
myself. I would like to talk more to other
women and then write collectively. It would
be exciting if through the conference we
could get together a group of women from
every coop to analyze sexism in coops and
what we can do about it. Maybe we could
then write a thing for "Gold Flower."

For information about places and times call
any of the coops listed in this issue. The
conference is open to anyone and gay care
is provided.
