Women's Clearinghouse is
an anti-sexist radio news
program for women founded
and produced by women in an
attempt to bring news about
women and women's issues to
the public.

Women's Clearinghouse news
programs are heard Tuesday
and Friday evenings at 5:55
over KUOM 770 AM. In addi-
tion to our regular program,
we also produce monthly
radio specials with a parti-
cular focus on some aspect
of women's lives, issues,
and history. Women's Clear-

inghouse acts as a service
to give women without capital
access to the communications
media; aims to confront
people, in a positive way,
with issues women face daily;
and attempts to educate our
listeners with the accomplish-
ments women have strived for
in her history and won.
Women's Clearinghouse has
its office at 1507 Universi-
ty Ave. S.E., c/o Experiment-
al College, Minneapolis,
Minnesota (373-9782).

If there's one thing that
Sagittarians find impossible
--and it's maybe the only
thing they'll admit as even
difficult--it's refraining
from speech when they've an
opinion. And as they've
opinions on well-nigh every-
thing, the December-born
are reminded of this fail-
ing frequently.

And, because their sex is
categorized as subtle and
devious, it's many a Sagit-
tarian woman who's uttered
a silent (or more likely,
audible) curse at her frank-
ness. Like when she's found
just the right curt words to
handle a compromising situ-
ation. Or when someone at-
tempted an intellectual put-
down--and she responded,
ignoring the intent, as
though to a challenge.

These occasional disrup-
tions can ruffle her optim-
istic surface. But more
destructive, in the long
run, is the individualistic
Sagittarian's conviction of
inborn nobility: because she
is herself so capable, (des-
pite her lapses, or because
of them) she is impatient
with those who crumple un-
der strain. She believes
in the "bootstraps" theory
of social improvement, which
possibly only works for
Sagittarians and a random
Capricorn.

Sagittarian idealism, then
is individual rather than
social; the archer seeks her
ideal embodied in individu-
als and may be hesitant to
extend this idealism to uto-
pian social thought. She
holds high standards for
herself but narrows her
viewpoint to personal devel-
opment alone.

Given her own potential
for such development, her
focus is understandable;

herbs ???
Throw away the patent
panaceas and stock your
shelves instead with these
simple herbs:

HOPS, taken as a mild tea,
is a quick-acting soporific;
the dried herb, stuffed into
a pillow, is said to induce
sleep as well.

SAGE, a familiar season-
ing, is considered a tonic
and blood purifier; as a
hair rinse, the tea reputed-
ly removes dandruff.

GINSENG is a stimulant
which, as a strong tea, is a
euphoric as well; YERBA MATE
is very stimulating and said
to diminish the appetite.

ROSEHIPS are a concentra-
ted source of vitamin C and
are therefore prescribed for
the common cold.

WILLOW BARK contains the
substance from which aspirin
is derived; it is a natural
pain reliever.

VALERIAN is both a sedative
and a stimulant; it is use-
ful in minor nervous condi-
tions in which sleep is not
sought.

The Women's Herbal Collect-
ive--dedicated to restoring
to women knowledge of simple
efficacious remedies for
minor illnesses--suggests
these common herbs as an in-
troduction into the field of
practical herbalism.
