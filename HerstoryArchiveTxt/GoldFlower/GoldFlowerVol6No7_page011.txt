POETRY  
WOMB=3 PEAKING  

(for Karen Starr)  

Our admission of this affliction: it is an addiction.  
Our inherited drug (tongues burnt raw with sugar)  
is a shut-eye chocolate box of sexual passion.  

We will never quit wanting to suckle, to rock, and to cradle.  
We will never escape the man on a thigh-ride -- wanting his desire  

to enter the womb again.  

Something in us craves to go, ride with the ride;  
one woman part needs (it's instinctive)  

to hit his whirlpool eyes and go under;  

learning almost to breathe water.  

But we start to discover -- other needs;  
(as all known planets collide.)  

The temple veil inside us, hiding the shrine, rips in half.  

One segment of this experimental roomful  

(without flouristan) bites down  

and swallows pain whole, asking for more.  

The other part, groping, colliding with each other,  

has begun to speak:  

it's as though some third sister borrowed these tongues.  
We talk with each other, and hear her voice --- whisper  
that we bear - new - seed.  

Mothers of every generation, you have carried and carried;  
feel the green life now rising in your bones,  

that lifts white seedlings toward moonlight,  

and that pulses your wombs into wordless creation.  

We are thinking new words, and we swallow them,  

as we've swallowed the earth's seed of pain.  

Mothers, this pain now is swelling us;  

our bellies fill up with an unborn world ---  

(it is too late to patch up, cradle, soothe, this ore.)  
It is our words now, unspoken, never heard before,  

that we carry -- a new human vocabulary.  

Tiny hands open and close in getting ready.  

Sisters: it is ourselves that we bear -- our new selves.  
Time again to float in a silence, in clear red light;  

waiting to be born.  

Mary Ellen Shaw  

Xt. (  
Nea.  

In the city we turn  

stopping to lean upon a pole  
and breathing fast,  
we run hard {  
squinting and lowering our heads  
into an early rain;  
explorers new  
on this splashed pavement.  

And finding ourselves  

in the neon day  

of a diner,  

we shuffle, blinking,  

reaching two stools near the edge.  
"two coffees please,"  

fumbling for change  

and pausing,  

we drink up  

leaving it all for the night.

ON THE WAY TO SOUTHERN MINNESOTA  

Like a skeleton  

waiting to be clothed,  
the house remains.  

While through each space  
whose wooden limbs  

have failed to meet,  

an August wind screams out.  

S. Alpert  

Your voice  

passes in the air  

and falls upon dead walls;  
and laughter's phrase  
finds no tune.  

Your body barely moves  
across my mind  

as I lie here helpless  

in my skin.
