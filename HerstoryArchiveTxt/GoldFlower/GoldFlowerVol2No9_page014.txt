prejudice.

My father is NOT a member
of liberal America. But this
attitude towards homosexuality
is also quite common among
the well-educated good liber-
als. Well, everyone is enti-
tled to a personal opinion,
aren't they? Even if it is
based on complete ignorance.
Even if it does destroy peo-
ple.

We don't think so. A collu-
sion between ignorance and
anxious conformity has perpe-
trated great wickedness upon
real people. And this very
considerable suffering inflic-
ted on anyone who knows or
fears that (s)he is gay is ab-
solutely unnecessary.

We are a group of individu-
als who are concerned about
stopping this human destruc-
tion. No single action will
accomplish the kind of change
in social attitudes that is
necessary. But there are sev-
eral obvious starting points.

First, there are certain po-
litical changes which are es-
sential. NOW is beginning to
compile a mailing list of per-
sons sympathetic to legal
reform. If you are willing to

write a few letters to alder-
men, state legislators, etc.,
in favor of altering current
sex laws and of expanding the
coverage of existing human
rights laws, please send us
your address.

Secondly, most people--in-
cluding most liberals--are
quite ignorant of what it
means to be a homosexual in
our society. We strongly
urge all you who call your-
selves liberals, or human-
ists, or feminists--to take
the time to read Lesbian/Wo-
man by Del Martin and Phyllis
Lyon. It is available in
most libraries and paperback
bookstores, or may be ordered
through us.

We are also selling human

rights buttons and are in des-
perate need of contributions.
If you sympathize with us for
whatever reason, please help
us now. Our hour of need is
upon us.

"I was a-trembling, because
I got to decide; forever,
betwixt two things, and I
knowed it. I studied a min-
ute, sort of holding my
breath, and then says to my-
self:

"Aero ht 5
to heli."

It was awful thoughts and
awful words but they were said
And I let them stay said; and
never thought no more about

then, to go

reforming...I would take up
wickedness again, which was
in my line, being brung up to
it, and the other wasn't.

And for a starter I would go
to work and steal Jim out of
slavery again. Mark Twain

Lesbian Motherhood
Study

Dear Sisters:

I am a graduate student in

the School of Social Work at

California State University,
Sacramento. I am presently
working on my master's thesis

"Lesbian mothers are now en-

gaged in court cases to gain

or regain custody of their
children and are in dire need
of support from many levels.
My hope for this thesis is
that it can be used to streng-
then the arguments and dispel
the negative stereotypes of
Lesbian motherhood, as well
as to increase society's a-
wareness and acceptance of
Lesbians and Lesbian child-
raising.

I have developed a question-
naire in conjunction with Del
Martin and Phyllis Lyon and
other members of the Lesbian
community, which is now ready
for distribution. My popula-
tion of subjects can include
any woman who considers her-
self to be a Lesbian who is
raising or has raised a child
whether or not they are now
living together.

To reach as many women as
possible, I need your help.
Can you announce the exis-
tence of this research to as
many women as possible? Wo-
men who are willing to com-
plete a questionnaire can
drop me a card letting me
know they will participate.

All replies will be held
strictly confidential and re-
sponses will be anonymous and
in no way connected to the
names or addresses of respon-
dents.

Obtaining a large number of

Lesbian mothers for my sample
is crucial to the effective-
ness of my thesis; any publi-
city you can give to this ef-
fort will be critical to its

success and greatly apprecia-
ted.

Thank you very much.
