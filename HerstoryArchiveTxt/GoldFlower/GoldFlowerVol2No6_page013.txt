First, You Put the Key in the Ignition

"I mean, do you know any-
thing about your car?
Beyond how to start it?"

The fall I turned sixteen, my
father took me out to the gar
age and made me change a tire
on the family station wagon.
If I was going to drive, I had
to be able to take care of
the simple emergencies. The
fall I turned 22, I bought my
first car and my father and

I spent another session in
the garage reviewing jumper
cables, carburetors, spark
plugs, and heater hoses.
Which was not much in terms
of the infinite number of
things that can go wrong with
a car, but it was more than
most men and women know about
the vehicle they depend upon
so heavily.

Peculiarities

It always seemed peculiar to
me that in a school system
which taught me how to brush
my teeth, use a compound mi-
croscope, and shoot a bow
and arrow I was never taught
how to do something as sim-
ple and essential as change a
tire on a car. But then,
neither was my brother. Auto
repair and maintenance essen-
tially remains a mystery to
us both.

Male Fantasies

That's why most Auto Mechan-
ics classes in the Twin

Cities area assume at the be-

ginning that students don't
know anything about cars "and
most of them don't." And,
according to South Community
School Director Gary Soule,
automobile classes designed
specifically for women oper-
ate on an assumption that is
totally erroneous. "The idea
that boys start in Auto Mech-
anics with more background
than girls is just not true
as far as we're concerned."
Apparently, men just bring

in a few more pet fantasies;
fantasies which are quickly
dispelled once work on cars
really begins.

Courses in the Twin Cities
to help people better under-
stand their automobiles range
from elementary classroom in-
troductions to full scale
work on a variety of engines
and specialized problems.
Offered at a reasonable cost
in well-equipped facilities,
such night courses are popu-

lar among both sexes and
appear well-organized and re-
sponsibly taught.

The interest and ability of
women to work on cars is
accepted, respected, and
highly encouraged at most
community schools. Although
some schools like South teach
all coeducational courses,
other schools offer a few
courses exclusively for wo-
men to encourage them to en-
roll. And although no wo-
man has ever been used as an
instructor, Stan Baraga, Dir-
ector of the Minneapolis Adult
Education Program, states
emphatically that "if we had
a good female mechanic, we'd
use her for sure."

Top People

In general, "women are sur-
prised by what they can end
up doing," reports David
Barkmeier, Auto Maintenance
Instructor at South High.
According to Barkmeier, women
tend to take the course more
seriously and are therefore
more meticulous and successful
in their work.

"Three women were my top
people in last year's Auto
Maintenance class. Between
them, they tuned up eight
cars--they brought in the
cars of neighbors, friends,
everybody."

Fun Tune-Ups

Barkmeier tries to not only
teach the basics of Auto
Maintenance in his course, but
give students a feeling for
reasonable repair charges and
suggestions for cutting costs.

Nancy Moody, one of Bark-
meier's star pupils, was also
glowing in her description of
the course.

"My girlfriend and I de-
cided to take the course be-
cause it was so expensive to
have the car fixed all the
time. My husband did a lot
of our car work and had some
of the tools, but I was tired
of just helping him. I wanted
to get beyond just tagging a-
long."

"It was really fun. We got
into doing tune-ups, install-
ing new shock absorbers, and
packing wheel bearings. I
learned some things that my
husband didn't know and we got
good advice on tools and eq-
uipment to invest in."

"There were 15 people in the
course and maybe half were
women. Some girls tended to
play down their ability and
