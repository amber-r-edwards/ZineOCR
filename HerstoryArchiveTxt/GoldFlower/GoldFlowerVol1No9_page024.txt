|! Am An American Girl  

I am an American girl.  

I have seen the growth of this nation.  

I have seen your ‘home of the brave and land of the free'  
I have known of Hiroshima, the Korean War, the Bay of Pigs,  
Biafra, and now Vietnam.  

I have known the innocent bloodshed in Selma, Jackson, and  
on my own streets.  

I have seen your cars and skyscrapers.  

I have walked 29 miles for development.  

I have known the deaths of Malcolm, Martin, John, Robert  
and Bobby.  

I have tasted a million endless tears for a people so  
crushed and discriminated.  

I have carried guilt on my white skin and denied myself.  
I have seen man walk on the moon and heard the sonic barrier  
broken.  

I have seen millions of dollars spent on beautifying  
America.  

I have seen the destruction and pollution of water, air  
and land.  

I have seen your growth in cities.  

I have seen men dead on the same streets.  

I have known the creation of your drugs and synthetic  
escapes.  

I have felt the emptiness of insanity from the same.  

I have seen the rise and decline of tenement houses, only  
to be replaced by more.  

I have seen the bombing of a church in Alabama.  

I have known the deaths of three small children.  

I have lived in roach and rat infested slum houses.  

I have been told Russia will bury me.  

I have cried ten thousand tears for starving children in  
Appalachia.  

I have hungered countless times with my Indian children on  
barren reservations.  

I have felt the pain of hearing my son called nigger.  

I have felt the taunts and cruelty of your America.  

I have bowed to you in silence, white America.  

I have cried a thousand right-ons to Angela Davis.  

I have wept endless tears for Connie Trimble.  

I have slept behind steel bars and played your ridiculous  
games, America.  

I have cried too often, and yet you wonder why I am as I am.  
I am no longer going to cry.  

I am no longer going to cry.  

Written to and for  
‘Connie Trimble  

(should be read aloud)  

sister in jail  
I too wait  
sister in jail  
I too burn  
sister in jail  
I too grow  
embittered  
sister in jail  
I too grow  
enraged and  
angered  
But that's all bullshit when  
What you need is  
money  
Because even the best  
shit  
won't deliver  
you  
from this  
concoction.  
tears begin to run rampantly  
down my face  
as I realize  
they're merely forcing us  
to buy you  
off the market  
like a  
slave  
to free you  
In all their damned blindness  
they can't sense  
that  
you're  
sacred  
black sister  
as sacred as  
the  
first  
rain

Job in 'Nam  

Need a job man  
Then see Uncle Sam  
For a job in Viet Nam  

He'll pay the fare  

And even fly you there  

You get free food & medical  
care  

Of course you may come back  
in a box  

And the cause won't be  
chicken pox  

Nor from the holes in your  
socks  

But what do you care  

You get a free trip there  

And even free post mortem  
care  

So if you need a job man  
Go see Uncle Sam  

for I am no longer,  

an American girl. For a job in Viet Nam.
