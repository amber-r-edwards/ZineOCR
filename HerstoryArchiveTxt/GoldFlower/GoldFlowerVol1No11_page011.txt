one injection lasts for a
three-month period, that
they have been demonstrated
to be at least as effective
as the pill because there is
almost no opportunity for
patient error, and that they
have minimal side effects.
Because the injected medica-
tion doesn't include estro-
gen, the dangers associated
with estrogen in birth-con-
trol pills aren't present.
One side effect is an almost

complete absence of menstruation,

during the time the
woman is using the contra-
ceptive. A potential disad-
vantage is that menstruation
and ovulation may not begin
again for as long as a year
after cessation of injec-
tions. It is for this rea-
son that the use of injecta-
ble contraceptives is not
recommended for women who
are planning to have child-
ren.

This contraceptive method
is still being tested, and
women who select it as their
method of birth control
should recognize that re-
search on long-term effects
hasn't been completed. How-
ever, the method is availa-
ble through some agencies
and private physicians,
especially if the woman is
older and has no plans for
childbearing.

Intrauterine Device (IUD)

The intrauterine device is
a loop, ring, coil, or
shield made of malleable
plastic and inserted into
the uterine cavity. It is
inserted during menstrua-
tion, preferably on the
first day of the period, and
begins to function immedi-
ately to prevent conception.
While the IUD follows steri-
lization, injectable contra-
ceptives, and the pill in
effectiveness, a few women
out of every hundred women
using it for one year do be-
come pregnant. These un-
planned pregnancies can re-
sult, after expulsion of the
IUD from the uterus without
the woman's knowledge or can
occur with the IUD in place.
Expulsion is most likely to
occur within the first three
months after the device has
been installed. It is par-
ticularly during this period
that users should check to
see that it is in place be-
fore depending on it for
protection. This is done by
reaching into the vagina and
feeling for a small nylon
string that is attached to
the IUD. Unplanned pregnan-
cies with the IUD still in
place are most likely during
the first eighteen months.

Part IE
Contraception and
Nonmethods of Contraception

For the woman to be fully
protected, an additional
form of protection against
pregnancy, such as foam or
condom, should be used dur-
ing the middle part of the
menstrual cycle.

Exactly how the IUD works
is not known. Physicians
believe that it either sets
up muscular movements that
force the egg into the uter-
us before it is ready to be
implanted there, or it some-
how prevents the walls of
the uterus from accepting
the fertilized egg.

The advantages of the IUD
are limited to the 50 percent
to 75 percent of the female
population whose bodies tol-
erate it. Two advantages
are that, once in place, it
furnishes contraception in-
definitely and that the only
cost is the initial one.*
Moreover, like the pill, it
is a birth-control technique
that is independent of the
sexual act, except that for
the first several months af-
ter insertion users should
make sure it is in place be-
fore intercourse. Addition-
ally, when a woman wishes
to become pregnant, the IUD
is readily removable by a
physician.

A major disadvantage is
that about 25 percent of the
women who have been fitted
with IUDs experience pain or

*Use of extra midcycle pro-
tection in the form of foam
or condoms naturally adds to
the total cost of this meth-

excessive menstrual bleeding
sufficient to require their
removal. Over a five-year
period, the proportion who
can continue to use the IUD
drops to about 50 percent.

A few women expel it, some
discovering that they have
done so only when they be-
come pregnant. Younger wo-
men and women who never have
had a pregnancy are those
most likely to experience
difficulties with the IUD.
However, a new device, the
Dalkon shield, has been
successfully tolerated by
women who have never been
pregnant. The shield is
less likely to be rejected,
and its use creates less
cramping and bleeding.
Another difficulty experienc-
ed by a few women is infec-
tion of the pelvic organs
because while qualified
physicians use sterilized
instruments to insert the
IUD, bacteria from the vagi-
na can enter the uterus
during insertion. It is im-
portant that a woman with a
vaginal infection not be fit-
ted with an IUD until the
condition is under control;
otherwise, the risk of pel-
vic infection would be in-
creased. A final, but very
slight, risk is uterine
perforation, experienced by
fewer than forty women out
of every hundred thousand.
Uterine perforation, in
which the IUD punctures the
uterus and moves into the
abdominal cavity, can be
corrected surgically.
