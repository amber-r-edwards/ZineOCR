Yes, I went to  
college.  

But Speedwriting  
got me my job.  

Having a college degree doesn’t automatically mean a boy  
can step right into the job of his dreams.  

To open the right doors, often what’s needed is a business  
skill your prospective boss can use. Like shorthand. |  

But ordinary symbol shorthand takes a lot of time to learn.  
And even if you didn’t spend years in college, who wants to  
waste months and months grinding away with strange signs and  
squiggles?  

Speedwriting Shorthand is something else. It’s based on sim-  
“ple, everyday ABCs. Those familiar ABCs  
SCHOOL OF SPEEDWRITING you’ve known and loved since the first grade.  
Dept. 3607-4. | That’s the whole reason why you can  
55 West 42nd Street, New York, New York 10036 master Speedwriting Shorthand so easily.  

} And so fast. More than a million girls already  
have, many in as little as six weeks.  

You, too, can learn Speedwriting Short-  
hand fast. And take dictation at 120 w.p.m.,  
which is 50% faster than most firms require.  

Then just imagine the welcome smiles  
you’ll get from personnel managers. And the  
doors that swing open in exciting fields like  
television, advertising, fashion, publishing.
