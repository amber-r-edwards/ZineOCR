Another Slice of P.I.

Halfway House Helps

Shakopee

Women in our prisons face
many problems today, not
the least of which is that
the general public remains
unaware of female offenders
and the ineffectiveness of
most of the rehabilitation
offered them. A promising
answer to this complicated
situation may be as simple
as P.I. (in this case a Twin
Cities group called Project
Interaction).
Springing from an Indian
culture class led by Dorothy
Anderson and Molly Ramon at
Minn. Women's Correctional
Institute at Shakopee, a
weekly discussion group was
formed which was open to all
inmates. As more volunteers
became interested, an uncen-
sored newsletter was started
to allow inmates feedback
into the community and a bou-
tique opened so women could
wear regular clothes rather
than uniforms. Legal aid, vo-
cational and personal assis-
tance was made available,
and Project Interaction was
incorporated into a nonpro-
fit organization composed of
both inmates and volun-
teers dedicated to the con-
cept of community correction.
Community corrections—not a
term that means much to most
of us not directly involved
with the prison system; but
to the women of Shakopee
prison and those who are hel-
ping them rediscover their
potential through Project
Interaction it can mean sig-
nificant change in their
lives both in and out of the
institution. It means a grass
roots movement that allows
ordinary citizens to provide
much needed, no strings at-
tached help to people in our
prisons, and a chance for in-
mates to develop useful per-
sonal and professional skills
within the community they
face in the future.

One of the most promising
examples of this kind of pro-
gram is Project Interaction's
halfway house for the women
of Shakopee; the only one in
Minnesota, and one of only
nine in the entire country
for women. Although statis-
tical studies in the state
indicate the first ninety
days of re-entry into society
are the most critical for re-
adjustment, most women find
themselves left unprepared
by a correctional system
which has encouraged only
regimentation and alienation
from the community—traits
convenient for prisoners
but not for free functioning
adults. In response to such
a situation, Pi House was
organized with an emphasis
on individual needs and
community interaction.
Operating since January of
1973, at 581 Portland Ave.
in St. Paul, Pi House re-
cently had its open house
to show the community the
results of work by staff,
residents and volunteers
restoring an old three-
story brick house to a cot-
fortable place with a capa-
city of 14 residents.

Through individual and
group counseling, resource
referrals (job, education,
cultural, special treat-
ment) and in-house programs
Pi House deals with three
main areas of concern:
rehabilitation—geared to
positive decision making,
getting residents aware of
their own potential

individualized program—to
re-establish family-commun-
ity ties and speed tran-
sition back into society.
release—helping people re-
gain personal autonomy, suc-
ceed in establishing inde-
pendence.

Most often these are impli-
mented through a contract
between a resident and Pi
House, specifying personal
commitments and general
rules. Infractions usually
result in loss of privileges
but specific cases are de-
pendent on the judgment of
the counselor assigned. All
residents are required to
attend regular house meet-
ings and report to their
house counselor and parole
officer at scheduled times.
Each resident prepares her
own lunch and breakfast and
is on a rotating schedule
of tasks helping with the
evening meal at which every-
one eats together. Learning
experiences in food prepar-
ation, family planning, bud-
geting and child care are
emphasized within the house,
as a practical consideration
not reinforcement of a fem-
inine stereotyped role. Res-
idents are generally unre-
stricted as to the outside
organizations and groups that
they can take part in, and
may have their children in
for short stays at the house.

It is hoped that the combin-
ation of an individualized
program with a home-like
supportive situation will
result not only in social-
vocational goals but the
development of self-esteem
and personal independence
as well.

Women living at Pi House
are generally young, (the
oldest has been 34), many
have children. To get there
they must be eligible for
parole, go through several
interviews at the prison
and may arrange a pre-
release visit to see if Pi
House is for them.

While the final decision is
up to the parole board,
the halfway house itself
is funded through a State
Crime Commission grant, the
program itself is not organ-
ized by the Minnesota Depart-
ment of Corrections. “The
Corrections Department
doesn't dictate policy at
Pi House," stressed Wanda
Beale, Assistant Director
of the house. Project
