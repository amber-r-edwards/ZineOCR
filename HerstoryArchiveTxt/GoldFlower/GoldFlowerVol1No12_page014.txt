The  
Lesbian  
Mother  

“Recently, through the Les-  
bian Resource Center, a  
group for lesbian mothers  
was started. Our core mem-  
bers are presently in the  
midst of giving the group  
some direction and meaning.  

The problems of being a  
mother are numerous, whether  
the mother is straight, mar-  
ried, single, or gay. The  
gay mother has the same  
problems as the straight  
mother plus the fact that  
her unconventional life-  
style is frowned upon  

socially and legally. This  

puts her in a double or even

triple bind. She is the  
minority of the minority of  
the minority. She is first  
a woman, then gay, and  
then a mother. The need to  
relate to the lifestyle of  
raising children is great  
and immediate. This is why  
the group was started. We  
need support from women who  
are mothers and women who  
are relating to children.  
We need lawyers and other  
people who will rap with us.  
We need the moral support of  
others like us and the sup-  
port of other gay sisters.  

How does the lesbian be-  
come a mother? The same way  
any other woman becomes a  
mother. Some of us were  
married and came out after  
our marriages. Some of us  
gave life to children  
because families and society  
expected us to do this.  
Some of us wanted children--  
we never married but we  
surrounded ourselves with children.  
Some of us were raped and  
some of us just didn't know  
any better. Whatever the  
reasons, we are here. We  
have chosen to have children  
and we feel that we are fit  
mothers. We have fears and  
pain and joys and successes.  
We want to show the world  
that we are not unfit moth-  
ers because we are lesbians.  
We want our children to  
grow up and be free to  
choose their own lifestyle  
and not be poisoned by a  
bigoted society. Our child-  
ren will know pain just as  
we know pain but that is how  
we grew and that is how they  
will grow.  

If you are interested in  
relating to children in any  
way, whether you are a moth-  
er, the lover of a mother,  
whatever you are, we want  
you. Join our group and  
help us and we'll help you.  
We meet on Tuesday evenings  
at 8:00 at 2314 Elliot Ave-  
nue South, Minneapolis.  

Some of the gay women from  
the Resource Center have  
been babysitting for our  
kids while we rap so feel  
free to bring your kids.  

The Elliot Ave. address is  
a neutral meeting ground.  
There is no label attached  
to coming there. There are  
many lesbian mothers in the  
area who are afraid to come  
to a place that labels them  
as lesbians for one reason  
or another and we understand  
that.  

Some of you are frightened  
and we can feel that fright.  
We know it is painful, but  
we need you and we can all  
help each other if only we  
can meet and talk.  

If for any reason you can-  
not come to us I would like  
to give you my phone number.  
Call on me if you want more  
information or if you just  
need to talk. My phone num-  
ber is 722-1519.  

Here's hoping we will see  
you at our meetings.
