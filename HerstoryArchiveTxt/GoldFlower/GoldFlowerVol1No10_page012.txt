RAPE CENTER  
OPENS JAN. 13  

The Twin Cities Women's  
Rape Crisis Center, sche-  
duled to open on Jan. 15,  
is seeking volunteers for  
the 24-hour service.  

According to organizer  
Rita Gallagher, volunteers  
are needed to answer tele-  
phones and provide research  
assistance; training will  
be provided during the  
weeks before the center's  
official opening.  

The Rape Crisis Center  
will be a 24-hour telephone  
service; Legal advocacy,  
self-defense classes, dis-  
cussion groups for rape  
victims, and abortion re-  
ferrals are among the ser-  
vices it will provide.  

Women interested in aid-  
ing the Rape Crisis Center  
can call Gallagher at 729-  
2779; the first training  
session is slated for the  
last week of December. Con-  
tributions are welcome.  

Women Speakers  
Outline Affirmative  
Action Plans  

A workshop to inform wo-  
men of the "affirmative  
action" provisions of fed-  
eral regulations is planned  
for late January.  

Beginning at 9:30 a.m.  
on January 27, the work-  
shop will feature speakers  
from the Departments of  
Labor and Housing and Ur-  
ban Development, as well  
as local women.  

There is no admission  
charge for the workshop,  
sponsored by the Minneapo-  
lis Model City program;  
the event is scheduled for  
Sabathani Community Center,  
3244 4th Ave. S.  

Mary Manning, regional  
director of the Department  
of Labor's Women's Division  
will keynote the workshop  
at 10 a.m. She will be  
followed by Joanne Munday,  
HUD Federal Women's program  
coordinator.  

Local attorney Ellen Dres-  
selheuis and HUD official  
Frances Boelter will also  
present information on  
equal employment opportu-  
nities under the new laws  
and regulations.  

After a bag-lunch break,  
the speakers will lead  
workshops in their areas of  
specialization. Department  
of Labor official Phil  
Grandquist will also be on  
hand to discuss employee  
rights in an afternoon  
session.  

All area women are wel-  

come to participate in the  
workshop, which is "inten-  

ded to introduce women to  
their rights, and to the  

ways they can take action  
if they feel they have been  
discriminated against," ac-  
cording to workshop orga-  
nizer Frankie Quade.

More evidence of women's  
lost history: astrology  
reference books list only  
Betsy Ross, Ava Gardner,  
Loretta Young and Mrs. Cal-  
vin Coolidge as models of  
the Capricorn woman.  

But as Capricorn is famed  
for its ambition, we  
thought it peculiar that  
so few had apparently suc-  
ceeded. Researching fur-  
ther (in feminist journals)  
we found the following  
women born under the sign  
of the sea-goat: Lucretia  
Mott, Carrie Chapman Catt,  
Alice Paul, Abbey Kelley  
Foster, Simone de Beauvoir,  
Anne Bronte, Rebecca West  
and Joan of Arc. As impres-  
sive a list of feminists  
as we are likely to find  
in any sign of the zodiac,  
but oddly omitted from the  
official astrological list.  

Capricorn women have his-  
torically been active in  
the women's struggle: like  
Alice Paul, they are among  
the most persevering of  
feminists. Capricorn is  
steadfast, ambitious, de-  
termined; Capricorn is also  
astutely political, for  
natives of this sign clear-  
ly see the social ladder  
and innately know how to  
clamber up it.

Unfortunately, this same  
driving ambition and shrewd  
practicality leads many Ca-  
pricorn women to seek sue-  
cess where they are most  
likely to find it--in the  
home, under the wing (thumb)  
of a promising, protective  
male. Hence many become  
"powers behind the throne,"  
women who demand that mate  
and offspring vicariously  
fulfill their own repressed  
ambition.  

Capricorn is the quintes-  
sentially social sign. Born  
when the sun (ego-energy)  
was at its yearly nadir, the  
Capricorn native gains per-  
sonal satisfaction from ad-  
hering to tradition, in a  
curious mingling of the per-  
sonal and the social. And,  
like R. Nixon, they are born  
politicians, canny and  
shrewd in their estimation  
of the lowest common social  
denominator.  

The Capricorn woman, as  
she abandons rigid adherence  
to women's traditional role,  
makes the best critic of  
that role--as is attested by  
the work of Simone de Beau-  
voir. Practical and clear-  
sighted, the Capricorn fem-  
inist deals with social re-  
alities in a comprehensive  
manner, never mistaking  
"ought to be" for "is."
