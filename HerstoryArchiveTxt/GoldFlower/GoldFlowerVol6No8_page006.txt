Inside

only street light and snow light,  
and rice white in my bowl  
becoming black as my mouth  

when I close it on the half  
cooked food.  

No car or footfall enters,  

the world is mute beyond  

these walls covered with the hum  
of refrigeration.  

Please - a motor, a cough, pedestrian,  
establish my senses again.  

The earth quivers beneath me  

and I strain the memory of traffic faces,  
angry horns blowing against my back's  
perpetual caution.  

I won't move into the intersection and  
slip on ice.  

The blue man behind me is swearing.  

I see his lips curling the words  

like lassos -  

His lips move up to my neck  

and open to take a mouthful  

of white neck meat.  

Don't eat me?  

He answers in a low grumble and shuts off  

when the temperature is cool enough  
for the storage of food.  

Cats glaze the kitchen floor  

with quick steps.  

Usually I love the air of them.  
Now I want a pounding  

reassurance on the solid floor -  

I do know it is solid, it holds my  
weight, but so does water  

and waves tease me about  

the heavy displacement  

breaking into their roll-and-turn dance  
one more and out again.  

Angrier now at me, intruder,  

they pull me, drag me into  

the subliminal current  

so that the wave dance goes on  
with a flowing traffic.  

Rice.  

It is all black now  

but still I am hungry.  

In me is the gnaw for sturdy fiber,  
for cleansing food  

but none is in the house,  
and pedestrians walk on the  
earthquake nonchalantly.  
Step Hard! Shuffle through  
the frozen snow so that the  
breaking surfaces  

will reach me.  

Outside  

the ice-snow hits my cheeks  
with the sounds of bells,  
ball-peen hammers to  

smooth out my wrinkled face.  
I love cold.  

I set a narrow space  

around me and place  

a sofa and table here.  
Across the room a bookshelf  
and desk.  

The light is on.  

Voyeurs see a woman  

wrapped in folds of shawl.  
In each fold lies a pale  
drift of snow.

I feel like a swan  
large and fair  
my skin as light  

as sand in the sun  
But what shall  
I do?  
With this ugly child  
Who stands inside  
of  

me.

Odd,  

to be in this masculine world.  

A cell, filled with variety -  

Scholar, Queer, Foul Mouth Bright Eyed  
Weirdo who Makes It even with his deformity.  
There is Stud  

Fat Man  

and Red Headed Boy, yawning metronomically.  
He responds to the chopped  

statements of the others  

by nodding from waist up, in full  
agreement with a Language I  

cannot comprehend.  

I am sleeping really.  

My Self back in my bed  

where blankets accept somnolence  
and I need not hide from silence.  
I must be sleeping.  

In my room plants speak in Growth  
and Blossom.  

A space where Laughter or  

Tears, Loudness or Quiet,  
Loveliness or Bitch prevail  

in their turns.  

Retreat from beige linoleum and  
vinyl chairs,  

from squares, lines, time.  

Space sans foreign eyes,  

bodies, assessments.  

Absent the alien tongues lolling  
in representation of  

clothed, writhing secrets.
