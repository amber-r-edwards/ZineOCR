P—AIRWIBES:

or?

Couldn't remember if I'd  
paid you yet—but it's such a  
good sheet that even if I  
have, keep the $3.

Thanks sisters,

The "Minnesota Citizens  
Concerned for Life" and other  
"Right to Life" groups who  
oppose revising Minnesota's  
antiquated abortion statute  
have consistently continued  
to claim that the termina-  
tion of pregnancy is a medi-  
cally dangerous procedure.  
They have magnified the rate  
at which complications occur  
and have been guilty of pur-  
posely inflating the statis-  
tics which are readily avail-  
able to all. I believe it  
is time to look at facts in-  
stead of listening to opini-  
ons furnished by those groups  
who wish to force all women  
to continue with pregnancies,  
desired or not.

Gordon Chase, the Administra-  
tor of New York City Health  
Service Administration re-  
leased the following informa-  
tion in October 1972:

In the first two years of  
the newly revised law in New  
York, 402,059 abortions were  
performed in New York City.  
There was only one maternal  
death associated with a legal

formation write the Ar-  
chives at the Berkeley  

first-trimester abortion in  
the second year (1971-1972),  
and there is some question  
about the duration of the  
pregnancy. In the first  
year, there were 3 first-  
trimester abortion deaths for  
a rate of 2.1 deaths per  
100,000 abortions, and in the  
second year this decreased to  
0.5/100,000 abortions indica-  
ting an exceedingly small  
risk attached to first-tri-  
mester abortions performed  
with proper medical safe-  
guards.

Like every other surgical  
procedure, abortion has at-  
tendant complications. In  
the first year, the rate of  
reported complications was  
8.5/1000 abortions which de-  
creased in the second year  
to 7.2/1000 abortions.

These include all complica-  
tions, minor and major, in  
pregnancies of duration up to  
24 weeks of gestation. It is  
well known that the incidence  
of complications increases  
rapidly with the length of  
gestation. For the first-  
trimester abortions, the rate  
of complications dropped from  
4-6/1000 abortions during the  
first year to 3.0/1000 abor-  
tions in the second year.  
There is some evidence that  
the increase in the number of  
complications (not the rate)  
is due to the improvement in  
the reporting procedure.

Since the abortion law be-  
came effective, there has  
been a definite improvement  
in the maternal mortality  
rate, that is, the number of  
women dying of pregnancy com-  
plications including the  
after-effects of criminal  
abortions. The overall

Staff Meeting  

Our next meeting will be  
Tuesday, November 21, at the  
home of Susan Cushman, 1408  
Spruce Place, Apt. 6, Mpls.  
Any woman interested in  
working on the paper should  
come to this meeting or fu-  
ture ones, which are held  
regularly each Thursday (ex-  
cept for this week of Novem-  
ber 21) at the Women's Coun-  
seling Service, 621 West  
Lake Street, Mpls. (third  
floor), 7:30 p.m.

maternal death rate in New  
York for the two year period  
under the new law was 37.7  
deaths per 100,000 live  
births, a statistically sig-  
nificant 28% decline from the  
preceding two year period  
when it was 52.2 deaths per  
100,000 live births.

The infant mortality drop-  
ped to an all-time low in  
1971; this rate has continued  
to decline since the advent  
of the newly enacted legisla-  
tion.

Out-of-wedlock births had  
been increasing dramatically  
in recent years. In 1971,  
the number of out-of-wedlock  
births dropped 11.8% from  
1970. This was the first de-  
cline since 1954.

The number of “incomplete  
abortions" have also declined  
drastically. "Incomplete  
abortions" in many instances  
reflect self-induced or  
criminally induced abortions  
especially when the patient  
becomes infected as a result  
of the abortion. Data from  
10 reporting New York City  
Municipal Hospitals show a  
sharp decline from 415 incom-  
plete abortions per month  
in 1970-1971 to 220 per  
month in 1971-1972... This  
reflects a true decline in  
the number of criminal abor-  
tions.

This factual information  
is available to all. Let us  
make decisions on the basis  
of facts rather than opinions  
based upon emotion.
