Anthropologist Elaine Mor-
gan has written a book de-
tailing her theories about
human evolution. Her ideas
are marked by refreshing
clarity and insightful cur-
iosity. This is in marked
contrast to books by most
male anthropologists, whose
premises seem to be based on
the common preconception that
all results of human evolu-
tion occurred either for the
purpose of making the Mighty
Hunter mightier or to make
the sex object sexier. Mor-
gan states, "The longer I
went on reading his own book
books about himself, the
more I longed to find a vol-
ume that would begin: ‘When
the first ancestor of the hu-
man race descended from the
trees, she had not yet devel-
oped the mighty brain that
was to distinguish her so
sharply from all other spe-
cies..."

The Descent
of Woman

Morgan explores the one-
sidedness of most anthropo-
logy, beginning with a dis-
cussion of androcentric
speech, and leads into the
manly myths that dominate
the science.

She disputes the idea that
"woman is a distorted ver-
sion of the original blue-
print."

For example—most male
anthropologists agree that
men became bipedal for pur-
poses of speed in the hunt,
even though quadrupeds run
faster than bipeds. Morgan
maintains that with the
drought of the 12-million
Pliocene era, the prehomin-
ids, former tree-dwellers,
took to the sea for protec-
tion when there were no more
trees to climb. They stood
upright to keep their heads
above water.

The Pliocene era is a
blank page in history; there
is little archeological ev-
idence pointing out where
prehominids were during that
time. Morgan submits that
they became sea dwellers.
There is little evidence be-
cause the weapons, pebbles,
were common on the beach and
worn by the water, and bones
washed to the sea.

Further evidence is that
we lost our furry hair to
aid rapid swimming (we would
have needed it to protect
our tender skin on land).

Also, we developed layers of
subcutaneous fat to keep us
warm in the water (it would
have added to the unbearable
heat on land). Similar hair
and fat evolution can be
seen in other mammals: the
walrus, porpoise, and hippo.
The reason she gives for
long hair remaining on the
human's head is that the
head would be the only part
of the body out of the water
and exposed to the sun; also,
a baby could grasp the mo-
ther's long hair and float
in the water.

Morgan explains why wo-
man developed larger
breasts than their primate
ancestors: with the loss
of chest hair, babies would
have nothing to hang onto.
Babies whose mother's breasts
were larger survived more
often, and that physical trait
began to predominate. We did
not develop larger breasts
to attract the Mighty Hunt-
er!

That idea, as she says,
is "a circular argument...
It's like saying that a wo-
man walks with a wiggle be-
cause this is attractive to
a male. In fact, she only
walks with a wiggle because
her children are so intell-
igent. The necessity of
passing a large-skulled in-
fant's head through her pel-
vic ring has prevented her
skeleton from adapting to
bipedalism quite as grace-
fully as that of her bro-
thers; and males only find
this defect attractive be-
cause they associate it with
femininity."

Other traits developed as
our aquatic visit length-
ened: webbing between fin-
gers and toes (we still have
vestigial webbing between
thumb and forefinger). Our
noses became streamlined to
keep out excess water. We
developed tear glands to
secrete salt. The ability
to frown began to protect our
eyes from the glare of
the sun. Something else happened—

we developed large buttocks.
Contrary to androcentric
thinking, it was not for the
purpose of sexual attraction.
Females would sit on the
beach to nurse their babies.
The fatty tissue built up
and the vaginal orifice
moved in and forward for
protection from the sand.
This point introduces
three interesting chapters
in the book: orgasm, love,
and aggression. Morgan says
that as the buttocks built
up, the male could no longer
reach the vagina in the nor-
mal rear-mounting position.
In order to achieve coitus,
he had to switch to a front-
al approach. This had two
immediate consequences: the
female was terrified; and
she was unable to reach or-
gasm. Her body was designed
for sexual approaches from
the rear; a frontal approach
was understood as an attack.
Her sexual initiative was
met by violence and she was
confused.

Also, the penis was no
longer entering the vagina
at the best angle to
"scratch the itch," and she
experienced sexual frustra-
tion for the first time.
The third result of the
switch to the frontal ap-
proach: sex and aggression
became linked in the human
mind. For the male, sex
became associated with ag-
gression, for the female,
with terror. Also, more
aggressive males had more
offspring since they
achieved coitus more often,
and aggression spread in
the species.

Morgan concludes her book
with several chapters in
which she traces facts of
everyday life to prehistory
things like race memory,
the development of speech,
sex roles, the Tarzan myth,
and differences in politi-
cal inclinations of the
sexes. The last chapter
sums it all up with her
“state of the movement"
evaluation. She ends on a
hopeful note:

"It may be that for Homo
Sapiens in the future, ex-
treme manifestations of the
