Feminist Poets to

The Women Poets of the Twin Cities, a
loose confederation of local poets which
sponsors readings of women's work and
poetry workshop sessions, will host two
readings this fall. One, to be held in
mid-October, will feature poets Jenne
Andrews, Patricia Hampl, and Carolyn Vo-
gel. At the other, local women will read
poetry concerning women's fears of, and
reactions to, the crime of rape; the
reading is a benefit for a member of the
organization who was attacked and beaten
this summer. Dates and places of the
readings have not yet been announced.

Jenne Andrews, whose book "In Pursuit
of the Family" will be published soon,
grew up in New Mexico and studied
creative writing at Colorado State. Dur-

September Weal aa— —— Vogel

Maples deepen, dark in the veins of their leaves;
color drains into the river.

This brisk air would have me too,

my blood running, tired of trying to love.

A fungus has come to take me.

It gleams, as round and as flat as a plate,
a cold and china ghost between the trees.

I kneel in the woods to my womanhood.

Read in October

ing her two years in Minnesota, her work
has been published in Ms. and many poetry
magazines.

Carolyn Vogel of Red Wing majored in
writing at Vassar, then turned to teach-
ing high school English and speech. Until
moving to Minneapolis last year, Vogel
was an investigative reporter and women's
editor for the Red Wing newspaper.

Patricia Hampl edits the KSJN publica-
tion "Preview" and co-edits the poetry
magazine "The Lamp in the Spine." A St.
Paul native, she studied creative writing
in Iowa and is currently at work on a
series of essays on women writers and an
article on Minnesota feminist Meridel
LeSueur.

THE

CENTERFOLD

When you said

That girl in Playboy
Didn't really have tits
That big

And how they blow them
Up or something

I saw

These two big balloons
Knotted on the ends
Full of helium

Rise serenely,

Leave Chicago behind,
Throw over the ballast
Which was

The young man

Hanging on.

Pale lady, your face is as smooth as Grandmother's,

who rocked a wicker chair my childhood afternoons

and flaked powder when I kissed her. Your lichen is sweet
on my lips. I would be with her and all that is lost.

It feels too late to go back to the house

and paste another night to day with supper.

The quiet cools my bones. Take me, ancient mother;
I would crawl in your wet flesh and sleep.

Fellini? —— Vogel

Months after grief

she works alone at evening,

her mind at rest

reflecting the essence of simpler things.

It follows the same easy physics

as that clean cloth spread on the table.

See how once shaken the fringes fall free?

It knows the chemistry of growth

in those zucchini, the fresh bread and ripe cheese.
She has learned the sacramental nature of a chore,
the peace in having hands and artless sense.

See how she is framed in good rich wood,

how there has been time for the cream to rise.

Pnne— — Vogel

The window beneath my hand wipes clean

and I move through it out to the yard where
gnarled oaks crouched in March.
They are not crippled anymore,

but heal in the green peace of leaves.
I place bouquets of pink

and rose peonies from my garden
around the cool dark rooms

and run my fingers over

all the other afternoons.

It is good before I go

to rub with soft rags this wood

and watch it grow rich with polish,

to leave for what love there is left
a freshness.
