Last year the Baldwin Street  
Photography Co-op was asked  
to prepare an exhibit of  
photographs by and about wo-  
men for the University of  
Toronto. They were also ask-  
ed to edit an issue of Image  
Nation.  

They received over 1,500  
photographs from women in the  
United States and Canada.  
They selected 230 of these  
for the exhibit and also de-  
cided to publish an issue of  
women's photographs in Image  
Nation. Image Nation II is  
the result, with 60 pages of  
photographs, four in color,  
and 6 pages of text.  

Women’s  
Film  
Fest  

The image of women is cru-  
cial, and in the media of  
movies that image is contriv-  
ed into the nun or the whore,  
the mama, or the bitch. The  
film industry has been the  
dominant influence on our  
habits and beliefs. For too  
long, it has projected women  
as sex objects, aggressive  
castrators, passive idiots,  
masochists, and losers.  
"Movies have programmed our  
dreams." We have accepted  
all that for years, and it  
has to be changed!  

But just as movies have  
had the power to perpetuate  
the weak image of women, it  
also has the power to alter  
that image, to change our  
values and influence our i-  
deals. There WILL be a new  
kind of movie--one showing  
women as strong, compassion-  
ate and beautiful inside!  
Now for starters, there will  
be something of a women's  
film festival at St. Mary's  

December 17. It is not as  
complete as I would like it  

to be (There were many factors work-  
ing against it and this is  

1969 U.S.A.)  

Anyhow, not all of the films
