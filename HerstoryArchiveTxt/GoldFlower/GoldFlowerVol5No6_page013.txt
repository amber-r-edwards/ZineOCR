POEMS

UP HERE THE WORLD  
COULD BE MINE  

This branch has a niche  

for me to sit.  

I wrap my legs under  

and around this branch;  
lean forward and hug the limb.  
We bend and sway  

and are one.  

I love this tree.  
Higher I climb;  

faster than the boys.  

POEM  

Meditation--right, buddy?  
Transcending this crap  
The rest of us wade in  

Searching for the Eternal  

For seventy-five dollars every Thursday  

At the public Library  

Rip Off  

Look, buddy, you're rich, I'm poor  
If you would be perfect  

Give me the seventy-five dollars  

You go fishing with Jesus  

I'm a surveyor at the top  

where the tree bends deeper. Nancy Berg Coleman  

The wind coaxes leaves  

who whisper to me where  

POEM  

no one can see. Together, we +  
the leaves are blowing cool and quick  

yes... I know this to be my season to follow  
will they wait for me?  

true, all my ties are illusory  

when I dream I move away so gracefully, but I  
wake and find myself waiting on the shores of some  
one else's dreams and I on the wrong side of the ocean  

survey and sway,  

survey and sway...  

Up here, the world  

could be mine.  

a wind arose out of nowhere  
it pressed the curtains against the screen  
to create the romantic atmosphere  
for my solitude

AZTEC POEM TO EASE BIRTH  

--English version by Anselm Hollo  

in the house with the tortoise chair  
she will give birth to the pearl  
to the beautiful feather  

in the house of the goddess who sits on a tortoise  
she will give birth to the necklace of pearls  
to the beautiful feathers we are  

there she sits on the tortoise  
swelling to give us birth  

on your way on your way  
child be on your way to me here  
you whom I made new  
come here child come be pearl  
be beautiful feather  

from Shaking the Pumpkin, Traditional Poetry of  
the Indian of North America, published 1972
