Caucus  

Betty Friedan Incites Near Riot  
At Women’s Political Convention  

When I attended the Minne-  
sota Women's Political Cau-  
cus in January, I had no in-  
dication that what I saw hap-  
pen would happen. I knew  
women from Gay House would  
be there to demonstrate  
against Betty Friedan, the  
guest speaker, but I had no  
idea the incident would be  
so dramatic or affect me so  
directly. I had no idea of  
what they would do.  

During the lunch break I  
talked briefly with the gay  
women and found that they  
had not decided what they  
would do. In fact, most  
were scared and they had not  
really thought of breaking  
up Friedan's speech. They  
had not brought any signs  
with them. Several had even  

registered for the confer-  
ence, paying the fee, so  

they could present a resolu-  
tion during the resolutions  
section of the conference  
calling for equal treatment  
of gay women. Yet, the fact  
was that they, as a group,  
had come to the conference  
to demonstrate against Friedan. They had decided to do  
so because Friedan, one of  
the so-called leaders of the  
women's rights movement, has  
made several remarks in the  
past calling gay women  
"sick," “the lavender her-  
ring," and the "disrupters"  
of the women's rights move-  
ment. She has said there is  
no place in the women's  
rights movement for gay wo-  
men.  

When Friedan's speech be-  
gan, she talked about how  
nice it was to be in Minne-  
sota where the Women's Poli-  
tical Caucus was represented  
by a wide variety of women--  
all ages, classes, and races.  
This was true to a certain  
extent--there were 10 to 12  
black women in the Caucus,  
there were some older women,  
and there were middle class  
women. But there were few,  
if any, American Indian wo-  
men, Chicana women, or Asian-  
American women. There were  
very few poor women there.  
Nor were there many young wo-  
men from radical political or  
independent political per  

spectives because they had  

walked out of the first poli-  

tical caucus session in Dec-  
ember when the Caucus voted  
to permit men as members.  
Friedan then went on to  
list the accomplishments of  
the women's movement in the  
past 10 years and the one  
item she forgot to mention  
was the recognition of gay  
women's rights. It was at  
this point that one of the  
women sitting with the gay  
group yelled out, "What a-  
bout gay women?" Not every-  
one heard her because there  
was some other noise in the  
auditorium at the time. It  
appeared that Friedan heard  
her, but after stopping mo-  
mentarily, went on for ano-  
ther couple of sentences.  
Then the gay woman shouted  
out again, "Why do you dis-  
criminate against gay women?"  
And this time she was heard  
in the entire audience;  
it had been quiet and there  
was an audible gasp which  
swept the audience. It was  
also obvious that Friedan  
was waiting for another out-  

burst and she was ready with  
her reply. She immediately  
raised the level of her  
voice and shouted out that  
she would not be interrupted,  
that her first amendment  
right to speak would not be  
disrupted. The audience wailed  
in an uproar. Another woman  
way in back, started yelling  
down, "Let her speak, let her  
speak." I did not know whe-  
ther she was referring to the  
gay woman or to Friedan.  
There was additional commo-  
tion as two or more of the  
woman guides (ushers) came  
down the aisles, ostensibly  
to remove the agitators.  

All during this time Friedan  
kept talking from the plat-  
form and she was, in a sense,  
shouting down the demonstra-  
tors. It was at this point  
that I became extremely emo-  
tional, because to me there  
seemed to be a direct threat  
to the lives and safety of  
those women who had first  
raised the question, "And  
what about gay women?"  

It was just pure emotion and  
I was shaking with fear and  

anger. And I know other gay  
women in the audience were  
reacting this way, too.  
Friedan was appealing to the  
anti-demonstration and sexist  
interests of the audience--  
she knew precisely what she  
was doing. Some time ago,  
some national politician had  
said that the way to deal  
with disrupters when giving  
a speech is to shout back at  
them, "You have no right to  
disrupt my right to speak."  
And Friedan definitely ap-  
pealed to this argument  
among the women present.  
But she also appealed to  
their sexist fears of gay wo-  
men, comparing gay women to  
thugs, disrupters of the wo-  
men's movement, fascists, and  
demagogues. When the ushers  
came down the aisle, I fully  
believed that whatever Friedan  
said the audience would  
have done, because it was on  
the verge of becoming a mob  
and they clapped and cheered  
what she said... Lost in the  
emotionalism was the gay wo-  
men's legitimate right to de-  
mand of Friedan just what she  
intended to do about her own  
oppression of other women.  

It was at this point, when  
I was really afraid for the  
safety of the women involved,  
that Wanda Beale, chairman  
of the MWPC, came walking up  
the aisle, out towards the  

back of the auditorium, with  

her arm around the shoulders  
of the gay woman who had  
shouted out the question.  

By this time the audience  
had quieted down somewhat  
and some shouts of "Oh no,  
they're taking them out"--  
almost in disgust, as if  
this was a childish way to  
deal with the situation--  
were heard. And then in a  
moment of absolute silence  
the women in back who had  
been shouting all this time,  
"Let her speak, let her  
speak," said, “Why don't you  
let this woman speak in this  
so-called free American so-  
ciety?" And whether it was  
this, or something else, I  
don't know, but Wanda Beale
