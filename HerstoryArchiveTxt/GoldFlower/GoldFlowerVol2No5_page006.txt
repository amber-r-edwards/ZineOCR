In "Ally Ally All Come Free",  
the company explores chil-  
dren's games; red light,  
green light; musical chairs;  
duck, duck, goose; king of the hill;  
and others to bring to the  
surface, as only theater can,  
some of the social dynamics  
which shape our society.

people that,  

"The best things in life  
are free”  

"Everything's coming up  
roses"  

"If you don't have a  
dream, how you gonna make  
a dream come true?"  

But we are here, rather, to  
awaken ourselves to the real  
world and take control of  
our lives."
