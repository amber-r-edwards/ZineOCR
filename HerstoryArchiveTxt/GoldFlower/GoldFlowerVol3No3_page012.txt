Another Divine Comedy?

She oa

Recently, I spotted a lit-
tle gem on the newsstand.
This "Mother of Pearl" was
entitled HOW TO PICK UP
GIRLS. With curious fingers
I turned the pages of this
slim volume by Eric Weber.
What I read would put Plato
to shame. A deeper or more
insightful philosophy has not
been advocated in modern
times. I felt that I had
glimpsed a bit of the eternal
In reading this volume I
truly transcended myself.

My "ethereal" education
began with the first chapter.
It was in the first chapter
that I discovered the real
wisdom of Sage Weber's "hum-
anistic" philosophy. Accor-
ding to the "intellectual"
Weber, ladies are just wait-
ing to be picked up and laid
down. That lovely lass at
the bus stop is not waiting

for a bus. She is waiting
for you, silly boy. Even if
you are ugly and have halito-
sis, she wants you. Her big,
soft boobs whisper little in-

vitations. Her high rise fan-

ny beckons. Her waiting for
the bus is all a sham. Women
have nothing important to do.
They are really waiting for
you.

On this principle alone,
dear Mr. Weber deserves a
Pulitzer Prize. However, his
"divine" insight does not end
with this one abiding princi-
ple. He has other nuggets of
wisdom. His insight at times
is almost overwhelming. He
truly shows to what extent a
human soul can soar.

His second "divine" prin-
ciple gives one pudding for
thought. Talk dirty to wom-
en, says the "guiding light."
The cruder your language the
more likely you are to score.

Tell the next little lady that
you meet that you like her
box. She might let you put
something in it. Tell anoth-
er babe that you like her
snow-capped mountains. Per-
haps, she'll let you do some
mountain climbing. Such in-
sightful advice for former
boy scouts! From Hades does
such wisdom come.

If you are starry-eyed by
such profound insight hold
on to your posterior. Mr.
Weber's next principle is
nothing less than earth shat-
tering. It would take an
Einstein to grasp its full
impact. We mortals can only
hope to get a tiny pin prick
of light. Surely, such gen-
ius is out of our reach!

The third principle takes
us to another dimension. The
sage tells his "boys" about
the “importance of being un-
earnest." A little lie often
leads the lass to the lair.
Pretend you are interested in
more than her boobs. "Girls
spend about twenty-three
hours a day primping," says
the astute author. So comp-
liment her efforts even if
it's bull. Yes, by all means
lie to her. She will not see
through the deception. Lad-
ies are myopia prone when it
comes to seeing through sham
and pretense. Even if they
can see through it women app-
reciate deception. Remember
old Eve telling Adam that the
apple was good for him?

Ah, so here we have the
"sacred" principles laid
down in "laymen's" language.

Earnest Eric does not stop
here, however. He also tells
his disciples what to say.
The language that he advo-
cates is simple. After all,
the disciples are speaking to

simple creatures. Wise Weber
believes one to three word
phrases are the safest.

"Hi" is the most appropri-
ate word. The broad will re-
spond with "goodbye." If she
does, you are one step closer
to beddy-bye. "What's your
name?" is a catchy phrase.
The chick might answer, “I'm
Gina Coreleone. My father
will make you an offer that
you can't refuse." This is
an obvious come on. Boy, you
are almost there. "You're a
Pisces, aren't you?" is more
than clever. She could pos-
sibly answer, "No, I'm a Com-
munist." You are there!
Communist sounds like commune
and everybody knows what com-
munes are like. "I love you"
is the greatest phrase of all.
The girl will answer, "Doesn't
everybody?" Now you
know that she has been around.
Perhaps she can teach you a
trick or two.

So woeful Weber is not
only equipped with wisdom,
but also with common sense.
He can tell kings of more
kingly values. He can tell
the peasant in the street
how to tell it like it isn't.
The man is a prophet. His
penetrating counsel stands
for all ages. He is the
"guiding light" of the fu-
ture. It is important that
his work be preserved.

What is the best way to
handle this preservation?
First, drop it near a fire
hydrant where it may be per-
fumed by capricious canines.
Second, put it in the oven
so that it may be more than
"half baked." Finally, "lay"
it to rest under a sweet
smelling patch of cow dung.
Now this wondrous work is
preserved for all “laymen" to
