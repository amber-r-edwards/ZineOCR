“Politics. .-
continued from page 8

Frankfort devotes entire chapters to:
Abortion, Drugs, Cancer and VD. But one of
the most enlightening sections deals with
Dr. William Nolen's best-seller, The Making
of a Surgeon. Frankfort fully reveals the
moral void that is the American Medical Es-
tablishment. In the chapter, "Do Unto
Others", she reports on Dr. Nolen's "in-
sider's" report on the development of a
jejune medical student into an august

attending staff man.

There is Dr. Nolen's jocular admission
that physicians actively solicit surgical
patients (frequently among those who re-
quire nothing more than a programmed diet).
The scramble for surgical engagements
springs from the doctor's desire to break
the magical $100,000 per annum mark.

Dr. Nolen's book details the elabor-
ate machinations of interns to avoid being
caught in an error. One patient, critically
ill with cancer of the bowel, developed
staphylococcal enteritis following surgery
and treatment with antibiotics that destroy
infection-fighting bacteria.

A young intern "who liked wild ideas"
treated the patient with an elixir chiefly
composed of another patient's bowel move-
ment.

Then began the game of hiding the
exact nature of the potion from the intern’s
resident, who in turn closed his eyes and
hoped the patient would survive so the
attending staff man would not learn of the
unorthodox medication.

As the intern sagely noted: "If Mrs.
Swan doesn't make it and anyone hears what
we've done, we'll be castrated (underlining
is the reviewer's). Don't write a word on
the chart about this and keep your mouth
shut.

History of
Gold Flower
And Staff
RRR ES

a monthly

Gold Flower,
Twin Cities women's publication,

: Also we accept
tion, is named for a Chinese P

peasant woman whose life
typifies the struggles of
many women. While in early
life she flaunted conven-
tion by loving the man of
her choice, Gold Flower la-
ter accepted an arranged
marriage, in which she lived
miserably. Finally, banding
together with other village
women, she achieved a per-
sonal liberation during the
Chinese political revolu-
tion. This melding of per-
sonal and political speaks
strongly to modern feminists
and for this reason we have
chosen Gold Flower's name

as our own.

In this anecdote lies the dilemma of
Americans and their doctors. We have cre-
ated a group of often ill-educated elitists
who, WITH NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS, are more con-
cerned about consulting the ever-growing
roster of "physicians' management" journals
than in keeping abreast of their profession
or reforming the bankrupt health care sys-
tem.

These management journals are an om-
inous sign that doctors will become more
entrenched in the system if allowed to
contemplate the problems of budgeting on
a $90,000 annual income. (One recent journal
actually carried such an article.)

Certainly, women are in the very best
position to know of the inequities of our
health care system. And since women are
the major consumers of prescription tran-
quilizers, diet pills, etc., since women
have suffered the most consistently at the
hands of physicians, it seems appropriate
that women should effect the reform of
American health care.

To forestall the inevitable cries that
many physicians are dedicated, socially-
conscious individuals, let it be noted that
Frankfort reports on fine and concerned
older physicians and a growing and dedica-
ted group of young, "radical" physicians.
It is the system that Frankfort indicts.

A one-time medical student, she is
well-qualified to report on the politics
of medicine. She is a health columnist for
the "Village Voice" and was recently hon-
ored with an award from the Media Workshop
for being "the first writer to combine
health issues with feminist politics".
Frankfort's book reflects exhaustive
research and personal dedication to the
dilemma of American women—and American
society—trying to get well with the help
of sick medicine.
