A parade in a snowstorm

through a fish-eye lens

A house of many colors where

I place people

My wax museum

I shine my eye on them and
they relive the time

I saw

I animate them I costume them
I erase scars I putty noses
I record their voices

as I remember

as I

want

I unplug some exhibits
cover them with dropcloths
lock the doors

And some rooms

I lie in for hours

They are fur-lined igloos
the wind outside

Always I
believe what they tell me
what they have always told me

believe them far
far too much.

the web behind us before

the end? How

is this time come about

so soon? Odd thought

that there would ever be

a grownup no-me mommy and a

your not-play house. This is
mending time making time

sowing binding meshing time of

one plus one equals one

times two I 4

keep wanting three, take

the knife the blade

sharp, fear the cut the

end of twenty treehouse summers but

safe in a cup to

root for you, to

grow in the new home, be

tended by her hands, your hands will
grow for

all of us for

You taboo

yourself against me
making any feelings I may have about you
irreverent
or incestuous
in other words
inappropriately
out of place and
uncalled for
