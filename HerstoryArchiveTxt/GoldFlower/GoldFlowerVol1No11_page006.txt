The  
Boss:

Get it in  
writing

BY PAT MONAGHAN

"There's almost nothing you  
can do by yourself to fight man-  
agement," Frances Boelter main-  
tains. "Women have to take a  
united stand."

Ms. Boelter, a personnel ad-  
ministrator at the federal De-  
partment of Housing and Urban  
Development (HUD), is one of  
several women who will speak at  
the Women's Employment Workshop  
this month.

"The most important thing is  
to organize, then to document  

your efforts," the employment  

specialist claims. "Management  
has almost no recourse when pre-  
sented with official documenta-  
tion. Words and promises don't  
mean anything—it has to be in  
writing."

Four employment specialists  
will define women's working rights  
at a midday workshop Jan. 27 at  
Sabathani Community Center, 24  
West 31st Street.

Sponsored by Model City Women's  
Task Force, the information ses-  
sion is "designed to get women  
to realize how to make the laws  
work for them," says Frankle  
Quade, Model City staffer. "It's  
a practical workshop on how to  
make ‘affirmative action' work.

"A lot of women," Ms. Quade  
continues, "are not even aware of  
what the words ‘affirmative act-  
ion’ mean. When I first read the  
laws I was amazed at the rights  
women do have."

Registration begins at 9:30  
a.m. for the session, with the  
program beginning at 10 a.m.

A formal morning session and in-  
formal workshops in the after-  
noon are planned, with a bagged  
lunch break. Workshops are sche-  
duled to conclude at 2 p.m.

The idea for a workshop grew,  
Ms. Quade explains, from an em-  
ployment seminar sponsored last  
fall by Federally Employed Women  
(FEW) of St. Paul.

“Ours will follow that model,  
concentrating on federal reg-  
ulations and particularly the  
affirmative action rules. It's  
vital that women learn about  
these regulations. There are  
many local businesses, like  
Honeywell and Control Data, that  
are covered."

The regulations require that  
"affirmative action" programs be  
designed and maintained by any  
contractor holding $50,000 or more  
in federal funds. "That means the  
city of Minneapolis, with 4.6  
million in Model City funds a-  
lone," Ms. Quade asserts. "That  
means the Cedar-Riverside Devel-  
opment, South High housing, the  
Institute of Arts."

Keynote speaker at the work-  
shop will be Mary Manning, re-  
gional director of the federal  
Department of Labor's Women's  
Division, who will describe the  
legal status of working women.

Ms. Manning will be followed by  
Joan Munday, Federal Women's  
Program Coordinator for the U.S.  
Housing and Urban Development  
department (HUD); Ellen Dressel-  
hufs, local attorney specializing  
in equal employment rights; and  
Frances Boelter, employment spe-  
cialist from HUD's St. Paul of-  
fice.

Afternoon workshops will cover  
such topics as federal garnish-  
ment laws, career ladders, and  
how to get an affirmative action  
program started. Resource per-  
sons will be available to dis-  
cuss employment problems with  
workshop participants.

The workshop is aimed at "any  
woman who needs or wants infor-  
mation—women who are housewives  
and want to reenter the labor  
market, underemployed women, un-  
employed women," Ms. Quade states.

The affirmative action regula-  
tions, with other employment laws  
of importance to women, are the  
focus of the workshop, slated  
for Jan. 27 at Sabathani Com-  
munity Center. There is no  
charge for the program, which  
will feature workshops on spe-  
cific employment problems.

Ms. Boelter describes problems  
common to working women, particu-  
larly those in the clerical field  
from which she started. "Often  
a woman hired as a secretary or  
typist will do research, compile  
reports, and do other profession-  
al or paraprofessional duties—  
then when she looks for another  
job, she's just a secretary."

For this reason Ms. Boelter  
stresses the importance of  
“position descriptions—usually  
a management tool, but extremely  
beneficial to employees." Such  
descriptions define the actual  
duties of each employee and  
are prepared cooperatively by  
employee and manager.

Secretaries should be trained  
for professional or para-  
professional jobs, Ms. Boelter  
insists, so that there will  
be more mobility from clerical  
to higher ranks. "This is an  
important issue for women, be-  
cause 95 percent of the clerical  
force is women and minorities,"  
she comments.

"Job restructuring—taking a  
professional position, breaking  
out some jobs that don't need  
professional education, and  
giving those tasks to para-  
professionals." Not only would this  
enable an agency or industry to  
hire fewer professionals, thus  
lowering costs, but "it would  
give clerical workers somewhere  
to go."

Ms. Boelter suggests that col-  
lege-educated women entering  
professional fields have greater  
potential for upward mobility  
than do most secretaries. "But  
we also see a lot of college-  
educated secretaries," she says,  
remarking that her agency and  
others have adopted policies  
which disallow this "underhiring  
of women."

"Career development is as  
important to the employer as to  
the employee," Ms. Boelter con-  
cludes. "It's not a matter of  
promising everyone a professional  
job, but of letting everyone work  

to their top capability, to get  

the best possible job from each  
person."
