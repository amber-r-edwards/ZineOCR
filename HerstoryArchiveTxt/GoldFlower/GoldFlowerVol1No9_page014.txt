AFFIRMATIVE ACTION?

SCANT COMPLIANCE FOUND LOCALLY  
WITH EQUAL EMPLOYMENT LAWS  

Women seeking to enter new  
job areas--or to move up in  
those they've already  
entered--should become aware  
of the provisions of the  
year-old "affirmative ac-  
tion" laws that require pri-  
ority hiring of women on  
projects entailing $50,000  
or more in federal monies.  

Contractors for projects  
in the Minneapolis area--in-  
cluding the Model City pro-  
gram as well as several  
major construction projects  
--have not yet acted upon  
the laws, despite increasing  
pressure to do so.  

Legislative guidelines  
provide that federally-  
funded contractors must "re-  
cruit, hire, train and pro-  
mote persons in all job  
classifications" regardless  
of sex. Contractors must  
also assist with "corrective  
action" those who have been  
retarded in job advancement  
through previous discrimin-  
ation.  

This means that employers  
can no longer use the "no  
qualified women applicants"  
excuse when women are under-  
represented on their staffs.  
It means too that the high-  
ly paid skilled trades must  
open their doors to women--  
and that women must be off-  
ered opportunities to move  
into increasingly more re-  
sponsible positions in  
their present jobs.  

The law specifies that  
"officials and managers,  
professionals, technicians,  
sales workers, and craftsmen"  
are job fields which must be  
opened to women under the  
new guidelines.  

In order to ensure com-  
pliance with the law, con-  
tractors must prepare writt-  
en affirmative action pro-  
grams; they are then bound  
to increase employment of  
women according to their  
stated timetables and per-  
centages.  

Despite this law, only  
the University of Minnesota  
has already in operation an  
affirmative action program  
for women and minorities.  
The city of Minneapolis, the  
Model City program, and the  
many federally-funded con-  
struction projects have  
not yet come forth with  
written programs for women,  
despite legislative direc-  
tion to the contrary. Some,  
on the other hand, have sub-  
mitted programs to improve  
ratios of minority men en-  
gaged in government-contrac-  
ted work.  

The legislation provides  
that government contractors  
supply separate hiring pro-  
grams for women and minor-  
ities. Each must be based  
upon a "utilization analy-  
sis" which will include:  

"the size of the female un-  
employment force in the la-  
bor area; the percentage of  
the female workforce as com-  
pared with the total work-  
force; the general availa-  
bility of women; the avail-  
ability of promotable and  
transferable female employ-  
ees; the degree of training  
which the contractor is rea-  
sonably able to undertake."  

Upon completion of the  

utilization analysis, the  
legislation requires that  
goals and timetables must be  
established. "Goals should  

be specific for planned re-  
sults, with timetables for  
completion," the law states.  
“Goals, timetables and af-  
firmative action commitment  
must be designed to correct  
any identifiable deficiencies."  
Again, the guidelines specify  
"specific goals and timetables  
separately for minorities and  
women."  

In addition, these goals  
must "consider the antici-  
pated expansion, contraction  
and turnover of and in the  
workforce."  

The year-old laws apply  
even to advertising, emplo-  
yee handbooks and annual  
reports--any company or ag-  
ency effort which directly,  
or indirectly affects em-  
ployment.  

"When employees are fea-  
tured in product or consumer  
advertising, employee hand-  
books or similar publications  

next, pipefitting  

"I wouldn't want to wake  
up next to a lady pipefit-  
ter."--R. Nixon.  

Six local women have  
challenged discriminatory  
hiring practices by applying  
for apprenticeships in four  
skilled trades.  

The women applied through  
the Labor Education Advance-  
ment Program (LEAP) last  
week for positions in cab-  
inet-making, carpentry,  
truck driving and carpet in-  
stallation.  

Only one woman is presently  
in the LEAP program, which  
is designed to place appli-  
cants as apprentices in the  
construction and related  
trades. Other LEAP enrollees  
are minority males.  

Apprentices in the skilled  
trades work for three years  
at 60-90 percent of journey-  
man wages. Hourly wages  
thereafter range from $4.59  
for cabinet-making to $7.33  
for painting.  

"Women must realize that  
the door to construction  
work is ajar," said Norm  
Overby of LEAP last week.  
"It isn't open yet, but you  
can at least get a foot in  
now."  

both minority and nonminor-  
ity, men and women should be  
pictured...When employees  
are pictured in consumer or  
help wanted advertising,  
both minorities and non-  
minority men and women  
should be shown."  

Action programs must be  
supported by active parti-  
cipation in summer-work,  
work-study, and on-the-job-  
training programs; formal  
career counseling programs  
and remedial job training  
must also be offered. And,  
should the point be missed,  
the law specifies that  
"female employees should not  
be required to possess high-  
er qualifications than those  
of the lowest qualified in-  
cumbent."  

Women who feel they have been  
discriminated against under  
these new laws should seek  
aid through the Women's  
Equity Action League, the  
Women's Advocates of St.  
Paul or the Equal Employ-  
ment Opportunities Commis-  
sion.
