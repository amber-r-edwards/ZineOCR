THE RAPE _ x:

(We would NEVER have caught  
him had we gone by YOUR de-  
scription said my Male De-  
fender contemptuously to me.  
after I pointed him out when  
he had, by coincidence, walked  
into the police station when  
I was there. To report his  
stolen car, which was not  
really stolen, but had been  
smashed up by his drunken  
buddy while he was raping me,  
but he wanted the insurance  
money so he had to say it was  
stolen. You would never have  
caught him anyway because you  
were not interested in catch-  
ing him. I know. I gave you  
his address and phone number  
and name. And when I came to  
the station a day later you  
had done NOTHING NOTHING  
NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING NOTH-  
ING.)

We were sitting in the Dist-  
rict Attorney's office, Los  
Angeles, California, because  
of my rape. And the question  
in MY mind was: will my rap-  
ist be prosecuted or won't he  
be prosecuted? But the ques-  
tion in HIS mind was: "WHAT  
DO YOUR PARENTS THINK OF  

YOUR LESBIAN TENDENCIES?"

(My male defender who let my  
rapist walk free.)

Because: 1) You were hitch-  
hiking.

On a bright, sunny day to a  
National Lesbian Conference.  
"Why were you hitch-hiking?  
#1 QUESTION OF DIRE IMPORT-  
ANCE when being interrogated  
by the local, helpful, con-  
cerned, patriotic, protective  
pigs.

ovec.."

("Well," said the civil att-  
orney after the state had let  
the rapist walk out a free  
man, “What did you EXPECT?"  
Just FLAUNTING your gayness  
at them! You were just egg-  
ing them on! They were prob-  
ably trying to straighten you  
out, heh, heh.")

(I did not have a car and my  
motorcycle was in another  
state and I didn't have money  
to buy a bike and the walk  
was a good thirty miles,  
that's why.)

Faulty Memory?

"About how much did they  
weigh?"

(I bet you wish YOU could. Heh  
heh.)

"Didn't you think it was a  
little dangerous to do?"

"I don't know. I was never  
good at estimating heights  
or weights."

"Uh, yes..-I heard about it  
on the television--that, uh,  
conference, interesting, most  
of the time, you know, we  
hear about those kind of men.

(The thought NEVER crossed my  
mind. Because usually women  
pick up women hitch-hikers,  
certainly not: Men-Who-Are-On  
The-Make. And who was to  
guess that I would be one of  
the women who is raped every  
14 minutes in this grand old  
United States of Amerika? A  
little dangerous? Heavens,  
no. Women are never raped.)

(Your description was totally  
off. He's 6'2" and weighs  
170 pounds. Stupid woman.  
Addle-brained. Flighty idiot  
idiot.)

(Yes, yes, a pity isn't it,  

to hear only about the MALE  

pervert, female perverts are  
so much more intriguing. To  
the Man, anyway.)

On with the  
interrogation

(How long, how long, how long  
will this last? My sisters  
are waiting outside for me  
and I do not want to think a-  
bout sucking his dick and  
lying beneath him. I want to  
be with my sisters who you  
would not let into this off-  
ice with me because--I don't  
know...you never gave a rea-  
son...you never have to...)

(But I DID memorize the house  
number and street where they  
took me and got his phone  

number and address. And a  

description of the car. Well  
just "the motor:.-I don't know  
what kind stripes...)

(I did want to get to the con-  
ference, though.)

‘Where were you going?"

"To the National Lesbian Con-  
ference."

Because: 2) You didn't  
resist.

"You mean to tell me you  
didn't resist at ALL? And  
they had no gun, no knife?  
You just followed their ord-  
ers?"

Pause. Pause. Pause. He  
lifts his eyes.

Very softly. "Are you a les-  
bian?"

"Two BLACK men picked you up?  
Why, then, weren't you sus-  
picious from the start?"

(They weren't eating water-  
melon.)

"Can you give me a descrip-  
tion of them?"

(I just SAID they were Black.)

"Well, one was pure BLACK and  
the other was a lighter shade.  
One had a suit on and was a-  
bout 5'6" and the other was  
about 5'3".
