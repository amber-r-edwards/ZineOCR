REVOLUTION ...

or only Turn-around

Movement, it's pause and
reflect time. Are you really
revolutionary, rejecting the
white, male values of
society; or are you a reapp-
lication of those old, un-
acceptable values?

Ideally, your strength
would be self-respect; it
would show itself in a
strong love for all human be-
ings. You would strive for
full human rights for every
person. You would renounce
the self-serving expediency
of the Great White Father.

Movement, you are failing
to live up to your ideals
in two ways. One is in hat-
ing men. We must realize
that men can be a danger,
that they share the power
that has kept us subservient
for so long. We must view
them with some suspicion.
But we must realize that
they, too, are victims of
society, cast into roles, and
deprived of the freedom to
be fully human; and that
women, too, perpetrate the
male chauvinist mistake.

Mothers buy dolls for
their daughters as much as
fathers do. Women respond
to female supervisors as bad-
ly as men do.

In hating men, you are
claiming that men are infer-
ior--you are prejudging. Need
I remind anyone of how in-
human pre-judgment can be?
We are familiar enough with
blanket hatred of groups to
recognize that hatred is a
sign of a weak, small person,
and that hatred is emotion-
ally disabling to the hater.

People who hate find their
abilities to respond with
love to anyone atrophied.

Hatred of groups is the very
thing we're fighting against.
The movement message should
be that neither sex is in-
ferior; we are all equal.

Our other failure to ad-
here to our true humanitar-
ian goals is on the question
of abortion. How ironic
that a movement that pretends
to spurn white male American
values adopts them when it
serves their purposes! No
one can be anti-war and pro-
abortion. Both are murders
of convenience, disposable
people, the easy way out.
Unseen, helpless people, a
bother. Didn't we learn early
in life that violence solves
no problems?

Some say the fetus is not
really a person. They call
it a "growth", like cancer.
Yet the fetus' cells are
not homogeneous like any
other growth in the body.
The fetus has all the differ-
ent kinds of cells that you
or I have, or that a baby
two months after birth has,

or that a baby two months be-

fore birth, or four months
before, or six months be-
fore. In fact all
these cells are formed be-
fore you miss your first per-
iod. She (the fetus) is a
living person, though in a
different form than post-

natal life.
Population control is

essential--so take the pill,
tie the vas, use the condom.
There are effective ways to

prevent conception.
The number of women who

die at the hands of quacks
is unforgivable; the num-
ber of babies who die as a
result of abortions is high-
er. Would we put bullet-

proof vests on the people
who are pointing the guns?

The backbone of the pro-
abortionist's argument is
that a woman should have the
right to control her own
body. I agree. But they
are closing their eyes to
the fact that (except for
nine months) it's NOT THEIR
BODY that is in question--
it is the baby's.

The pro-abortion and anti-
abortion movements are a
superbly ironic contrast.
The pro-lifers are mostly
rich, white, Establishment
males. They use the abor-

tion question as a politi-

cal issue to keep women down.
Pro-abortionists are just as
American in their own way,
determined to achieve their
own "freedom" at the cost of
anyone else's freedom or
life. No one, it seems, is
really concerned about the
person who is most con-
cerned--the unborn child.

It is a misplacement of
priorities to kill a prob-
lem rather than try to
solve it. We should be im-
proving ways to care for
children, not kill them. The
most liberated among us are
still not liberated from
American Establishment val-
ues.

Please, women, show me
that our revolution is a
revolution, a real reject-
ion of old values, a human
movement tidal wave that in-
cludes women, men and un-
born babies.

Is denying the rights of
others the way to get our own?

Can we say, "Big White
Daddy can't hate or kill,
but we can"?

Some 200 women from Duluth participated in

an all day conference Nov. 11.

The conference

was planned by a group of women who have been
meeting together in a consciousness-raising
group every Wednesday night for the past two

years.

Child care provided,

Small group discussions were held,
and a feminist group from

Minneapolis presented a multi-media show called

"Where Am I Now That I Need Me?"
the Minnesota Women's Political

Women Voters,

The League of

Caucus, and the Women's Advisory Committee of
the State Department of Human Rights were co-

operating agencies.
