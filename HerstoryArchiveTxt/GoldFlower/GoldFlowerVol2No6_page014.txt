Auto Mechanic, cont.

ask guys for help; other wo-
men wanted to do it on their
own and resented help. On
the whole, though, women
seemed more patient and thor-
ough.

"I guess the best thing I got
from the course was the confi-
dence that if something went
wrong with my car, I was not
at the mercy of someone else.
Even if I don't want to do
the work myself, I know what
is involved and what to ex-
pect from a garage."

Instructor Barkmeier echoes
Nancy Moody's thoughts. "Most
of the women we get really
want to learn how to do it
themselves. They don't want
to rely on husbands or boy-
friends and they don't want
to be taken in by filling
stations and ripped off every
time they have to take their
cars into a garage."

95% Curious

Girls are also enrolling in
high school Auto Mechanics
courses during the day. As I
talked with Barkmeier and a-
nother instructor at South
High, three girls in the back-
ground were taking a test on
ignition systems, along with
fifteen high school boys.

"I suppose 95% of the girls I
get here during the day are
just curious," stated Bark-
meier. "They think it's a fun
class to take. But at the
end of the course, I'll make

recommendations to anyone who
I think has the capability to
become a good mechanic." So
far, he hasn't run across a
woman with such aspirations,
but he feels there have been
a few who had the ability.

Options, Options

Another option open to Twin
Cities residents who wish to
work on their own cars are
do-it-yourself garages.
Community Garage, 344 East 19th
St. (335-0663) is a
loose club-school organization
of about 150 people, almost
50% of whom are women. For
$10 a year, members are free
to use garage space and equip-
ment and enlist the services
of their personal mechanic.
Do-It-Yourself Auto-Repair at
701 West Excelsior Blvd. also
offers garage space and tools
on an hourly rental basis. A
mechanic consultant is avail-
able, as well as the service
of analyzing a potential used
car for a buyer.

Despite the fact that I still
wouldn't know what to do if
smoke started billowing out of
my engine on Highway 94 during
rush hour, it is comforting
to know that in terms of opp-
ortunities, Twin Cities real-
ity is far more encouraging
than the myth.
