The Toy

When small,  
I had  
a doll  
to play with.  

Since grown,  
I find  
that now  
I'm the toy.  

Oh doll,  
af I ta  
only known.  

God, I am sorry.

--Sharon Yonemura  

city streets  
like the back of a  
sleek, gravel-skinned animal  

stretching in the fine, running spring wet.  

hear  

the sound of a baby  
like a distant sea-gull  
over the concrete waves  

and in the early spring dusk  
blooms with pairs of young girls  
while the night sighs with wheels  

on wet roads.  
*  

wing dust of butterflies and moths--  
passing lovers rub this life from me,  
falling earthward now.

Two Minnesotas  

broad Lutheran laps of Minnesota houses  
made of warm pine clapboard  
squat firmly on the limestone  
in old city neighborhoods,  

while in the raw suburbs, inarticulate  
houses and seas of plastic cling  
obscenely to the gently rolling  
hills of prairie grass  

i a  

Webs binding couples asleep with a  
net of fine hairs  
and sticky moonlight shreds  
of breath-mists and the long  

growing flosses of heads lying close, dreaming far.

The treasure snow  
falls thickly  
in the last hours of winter,  
a firm lover to the thawing ground  

and lightning thunders in the broad sheets of the clouds.  

The above poems as by Karin Winegar  

ash wednesday  

Why do you haunt me now?  

I wake only to wipe the beads away  
and when reality comes through  

you are nowhere to be found.  

is it true I was your “Maggie May"?  

you were with me tonight  
and I copped the same old attitude  
why can't it change?  

I become another person shutting out the rest of the  

of course joining yours, regretting it.  

my own fiery eternity in this world.  

but the dew will evaporate tomorrow  

and the sun will provide me with more energy  
snow will come to make me smile,  

the rain will make me mischievous  

m3  

orld  

my eyes will sparkle thus returning me to myself.

monday  

Will this pen once again release my frustrations?  

will it make my cheeks cool off,  

stop the gritting of my teeth,  

and relieve the dull ache in my head?  

that you so tactfully built up in me today.  
my energies are expelled  

the straw  

no longer can I help create your confidence  
or listen to your inability to say no  

resulting in squirming torment on your part.  
finished hearing those same old fears  

that you could never even try to face.  

the strength  

is mine  

and no longer may you tap from it.
