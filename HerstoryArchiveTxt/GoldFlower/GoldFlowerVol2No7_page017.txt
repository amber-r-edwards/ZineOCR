Federal agents ran into two veri-  
table Amazons when they attempted  
to confiscate a still on a farm  
near St. Paul. The girls, Florence  
Friermuth, 15, and her sister, Mrs.  
Susie Friermuth Doffing, had to be  
disarmed, the raiders reported, be-  
fore the still could be seized.  

The girls' father, Alex Friermuth,  
was arrested as the operator of the  
"moonshine" plant. After unloading  
the guns, the agents permitted the  
girls to pose with their artillery.
