turned around and took the
woman back to her seat.
There were a few more min-
utes of conversation, and
then Wanda Beale went up on
to the stage, put her arm
around Betty Friedan, stopped
her speech, and said that
the women who had interrupt-
ed the speech could ask
their questions during the
question and answer session
which would follow the

Speech, and that also, they
could make a statement as to
why they had disrupted the
speech when Betty Friedan
was done.

The audience returned to
normal. But it was another
20 minutes before I heard
another word Friedan said.
By the time I picked up on
what she was saying, she was

ringing again.
During the question and an-
swer session, it was obvious
Friedan was waiting for the
gay women to ask their ques-
tion again. But she never
got a chance to attack them,
because another woman, who
was not with the gay group,
asked the same question
ahead of them by referring
to direct quotes Friedan had
made in an earlier speech.
Friedan could not answer the
question and after talking
around the subject for a few
minutes, concluded by saying,
“When I have my heterosexual
rights, then you can have
your homosexual rights." 
By this time I was so angry
that I could not say any-
thing. I wanted to scream
out, I wanted someone to re-
ply to Friedan but no one
did, that "You already have
your heterosexual rights--or
"privileges" as a friend of
mine said. No one hassles
you about your sexual life,
or passes laws making it il-
legal for you to engage in

Re: The Disruption at the Jan. 25 MWPC

I disagreed with the action on tactical
grounds. If the objective was to bring to
the attention of the women assembled the
special oppression of gay women and to en-
list their aid in combatting it (which is
an absolutely valid objective), then I think I have been rebuffed,

criminates against you in
finding jobs because of your
personal life."

Friedan did not stay around
to hear the statement by the
gay woman. Wanda Beale came
up to the podium to explain
that she had promised the
gay woman time for a brief
statement, and that now was
the time it would be given.
Someone in the audience
shouted out, "Why does the
majority always have to give
in to the minority?" but she
was shouted down by the rest
of the audience to hear what
the gay woman had to say.

I had expected to hear
someone ranting and raving,
after hearing rumors about
Gay House (in that it was
male-dominated and male poli-
tics tend to be loud and
haranguing) and after be-
lieving in my own stereo-
types about politically ac-
tive gay people. But it
wasn't. Instead it was a
short, quiet speech which
registered forcefully with
the audience and which ended
with the woman saying she
would not "accept anything
less than being accepted ful-
ly as a human being and
fully as a woman." She was
applauded. It is interesting
to note in contrast that
when Betty Friedan was first
introduced, she received a
standing ovation by most of
the women present in the
audience, but she did not re-
ceive a standing ovation
when she concluded her
speech.

A break followed during
which I talked with a couple
of different women. One,
who is gay, said she too had
been shaking with fear and
had gone up to a woman whom
she had considered a friend,
seeking support at what was
going on, and backed away in
shock as the woman turned to
her and said, "I really

ing out literature, etc. etc.

After checking with many women I know that

these things were not done. If they had

been done, incidentally, and gay women had

I think they would have had

a perfect right to disrupt the proceedings

and to accuse the women there of hypocrisy.

But they weren't.

The conclusion I draw then is that the
whole incident was a deliberate attempt to
embarrass Betty Friedan rather than a serious
effort to raise the consciousness of wo-
men concerning the double oppression of
their gay sisters. Ms. Friedan stands
accused of not being an advocate of gay wo-

of argument that the accusation is correct.

admire Friedan; look what
she's done to those disrup-
ters. Another woman, whom I
knew, but not very well,
stopped me in the hallway
and said, "I can't believe...
that Friedan. She's fascist,
she's absolutely a fascist."
I simply did not expect to
hear this from this woman.

Yet there were other women
there who did not see any-
thing out of the ordinary or
who fully supported Friedan's
right to speak, what Friedan
said, and the way she said

The rest of the Political
Caucus ended much better
than I thought. I had at-
tended the first Caucus and
did not think the set of
resolutions would be passed
as they were because they
are fairly radical. But
they were. The only real
arguments came over the reso-
lution to "repeal all laws
dealing with women's repro-
ductive and sexual lives."
It was asked if this meant
prostitution, homosexuality,
and abortion and the answer
was yes. The anti-abortion
women, who constituted a
sizable minority at the Cau-
cus, fought to eliminate the
section on abortion by sub-
stituting another motion for
it. This failed and so
strong was the feeling that
we had discussed this issue
and the issue of women's
sexual lives enough, that a
vote was called for and the
resolution passed, as it
stood, by a 3 to 1 margin.
There were no other real de-
bates on the other resolu-
tions and the anti-abortion
women managed to introduce
another resolution--calling
for increased medical care
for children and pregnant
