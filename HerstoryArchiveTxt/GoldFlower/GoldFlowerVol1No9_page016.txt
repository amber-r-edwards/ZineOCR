Hill, Young ‘Renegade’ Poet  
Hymns Native American Experience  

by Pat Monahan  

"An old woman said to me,  
they can keep you from being  
a poet, but they can't keep  
you from being a citizen."  
She is Oneida, a member of a  
tribe forcibly removed from  
its New York home and re-  
settled in distant Wiscon-  
sin.  

"I want to go out East  
and find Oneida speakers,  
and apply what I learn to my  
poetry." She does not know  
the language of her herit-  
age.  

"There's a richness to  
Indian languages, sounds,  
rhythms--such a richness--  
all these would enrich con-  
temporary poetry." She  
dresses plainly, speaks with  
a simple earnestness.  

Roberta Hill is young,  
an Indian, a student, a wo-  
man. And she is a poet who  
says, "being an artist means  
giving away part of your own  
self--if you just go along  
with what people tell you,  
with their demands, it  
ceases to be giving."  

"That doesn't mean," she  
hastens to add, “that the  
Indian person--or poet--  
should not be involved" in  
the Indian movement but that  
in her eyes, her art tran-  
scends categories in which  
"your imagination gets  
bound up."  

In Minneapolis this month  
in conjunction with the  
current Walker Art Center  
exhibition of Indian art, Ms.  

Hill shared her poems and  
opinions with participants  
in readings and interviews,  
as well as conducting poet-  
ry classes for inner-city  
schoolchildren.  

A graduate student at the  
University of Montana at  
Missoula, Roberta is com-  
pleting her Master of Fine  
Arts thesis, a book of po-  
etry. She plans, after  
spring graduation, to teach  
creative writing as well as  
continuing her own work.  

Her academic background  
is in psychology, which she  
studied in Wisconsin as  
an undergraduate.  

"I never really thought  
of being, you know, ‘a  
poet,'" Roberta remarks,  
but suggests that this non-  
literary training has all-  
owed her a certain imagistic  
freedom: "I don't worry  
about where the images come  
from, or if I've read it  
somewhere before."  

Encouraged by college  
teachers to develop her  
writing talent, Ms. Hill  
last year entered the cre-  
ative writing program in  
Montana, at a school which  
has a department of Ameri-  
can Indian Studies, empha-  
sizing the visual arts.

"I've been writing poet-  
ry--well, good poetry, only  
about two years," she says.  

‘voices!"  

Her work has been published  
in poetry journals such as  
Intro, the American Poetry  
Review and Poetry Northwest;  
she is now touring the  
nation to promote exposure  
of contemporary Indian art.  

Roberta Hill asserts  
that she "wants to use  
Indian rhythms in English  
language poetry," but is  
troubled by technique: "If  
only I had four or five  
She cites Simon  
Ortez' experimental use of  
Indian rhythmic forms as a  
successful example of  
this development in Native  
American writing.  

"I am entrapped here,"  
she cries in one poem but  
asserts as well, "I am a  
renegade."  

"There is a lodestone in  
the prairie," she writes,  
invoking in another poem  
“the prairie...where tears  
salt bread." Traditional  
Native American images--  
soapstone, pony heads--  
appear in her poems, aug-  
mented with urban images  
which recall the experience  
of many modern Native Ameri-  
cans.  

"I think you can tell  
when you're laying yourself  
on the line, and when you're  
not," Roberta Hill says of  
the experience of creation.  
"When you are, it's good.  
When you're not, it's not."
