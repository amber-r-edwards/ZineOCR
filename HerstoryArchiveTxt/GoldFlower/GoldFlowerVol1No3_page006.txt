How to Fix Your Car and Keep It Running

This is the first install-
ment of a series of articles
written by a female mechanic.
The articles will be directed
toward helping women who want
to maintain their own cars.
This first article will deal
with the information, tools,
and sources for parts that
you will need to carry out
the maintenance described in
subsequent installments. It
is suggested that you save
all of these articles and re-
fer back to them as needed.

The first thing that you
will need to work on your
car is information. This
series will provide general
information, but you will
need to know things which ap-
ply to your car in particu-
lar, such as quantities of
oil, sizes of spark plug gaps,
and other things known as
specifications. The best
way to get this information
is from a book written speci-
fically about your car. 
Such books are available in
paperback from parts stores,
discount stores, and by mail
order. If you can't get a
book that is only for your
car, you may have to get one
that covers several model
years, but get the one that
says the most about your car
in particular. Be sure that
it has tune-up specifica-
tions and procedures in it.
Another source of informa-
tion is the public library.
They commonly have the re-
ference manuals "Motors" and
“Chilton's" and "National Ser-
vice Data." Look in them
for your model and year, use
the indexes, there is no ot-
her way, and then get the
information you need and
write it down. These books
ordinarily cannot be checked
out of the library. A third
source of information is a
car dealership with a ser-
vice department that repairs
your brand of car almost ex-
clusively. They usually

In January two women were
asked to leave because they
were dancing together. The
following night Gay Political
Activists (GPA) went to

the Poodle as straight cou-

al gay couples. The manage-

to give it to you. It de-

For most car maintenance
you will need a minimal a-
mount of tools. Some tools
may have come with your car,
a tire iron, bumper jack,
and maybe a wrench. In addi-
tion, you will need to buy
or borrow a couple screw-
drivers of different sizes,
a small set of inexpensive
wrenches, a flashlight, a
wire feeler gauge, and a
spark plug wrench. If you
have to buy wrenches, get
combination wrenches (hand
wrenches with one open end
and one box end) in sizes

Protest Continues at Poodle Bar

ment did not object--they
were quoted in the daily
newspapers as saying business
was slow that night anyway.
However, when the two women
returned again another night,
they were asked to leave
once more.

To meet this the GPA and
others decided to picket the
Poodle. The picket began at
about 9:30 p.m. and continued
until midnight. Approximate-
ly 100 persons picketed. Un-
like the first time gays pro-
tested at the bar, the
management wasn't as friend-
ly. One man gave me a hassle
because I was carrying "Gold

Getting the right parts
may be your biggest problem.
When a part is defective,
you may have two or three
options--buy a new part, buy
a used part, fix the defec-
tive part. When you need a
new part, if possible, find
its part number in your
model book. To go to a
parts store you will need to
know the model and year of
your car, its cubic inch
displacement, and number of
cylinders. Depending on the
kind of part you need, there
may be additional informa-
tion that you will need to
have with you. When special
information may be required,
this series will explain how
to get it. When purchasing
new parts be sure to get and
keep the receipt so that if
it is the wrong part (not
uncommon), you can get your
money back or a new part.

Used parts may be accepta-
ble in some situations—they
can be purchased for sub-
stantially less than new
parts. Used parts can be
purchased from stores listed
as "Automotive Parts and
Supplies--Used & Rebuilt"
listed in the Yellow Pages--
call first. Before you buy
a used part, find out if you
can get your money back if
it is defective and take the
old part with you to make sure
you get the right replace-
ment part.

Sometimes parts can be re-
paired, but before doing so,
you should consider whether
the added useful life will
make up for whatever it
takes to fix the old part.
In addition, some parts of
an automobile are perishable
such as spark plugs, points,
and batteries. Their useful
lives will be extended
through proper maintenance,
but they will still have to
be replaced sometime.

Flowers." I had brought some
to give to the demonstrators.
One of the management asked
to see one and I handed him
one. He then asked if he
could have it and I asked if
he had a donation to help
pay for the paper. He then
yelled that there was no ped-
dling or soliciting allowed
and commanded a 7-foot, mus-
cular being to throw me out.
The first man also later
ripped off four of the pick-
et signs. One other hassle
was a woman who was 24--who
