Conclusion

NOTE TO READERS: The

author was, until recently,  
employed by a Twin Cities  
firm. In May 1972 she filed  
a sex discrimination charge  
against the corporation with  
the Minnesota Department of  
Human Rights. Subsequently,  
she also filed a charge of  
race and sex discrimination  
against the corporation with  
the federal Equal Employment  
Opportunities Commission  
(EEOC).

PART I of this series out-  
lined events leading up to  
the filing of a sex dis-  
crimination charge, the fil-  
ing procedure and the con-  
frontation of the author  

and her supervisor after he  
was served with the charge.

PART II detailed the auth-  
or's relationship with her  
employer after she filed  

the charge and outlined some  
of the pitfalls a woman can  
encounter in a sex discrim-  
ination case.

PART III concludes the  
series.

A writer should never plan  
a three-part series on any-  
thing. Facing the conclus-  
ion of this story, I find  
that my blood has cooled sig-  
nificantly and ennui has  

set in. After some thought,  
however, I conclude that a  
paler mood is appropriate  

to the last segment of my  
story on sex discrimination  
in employment.

Cooled ardor allows me  
some perspective.

As I noted in PART II, my  
employer quickly removed its  
hand from the velvet glove  
when I proved intractable  

and would not drop my charge.  
The company then began its  
series of time-wasting maneu-  
vers to keep me occupied  
charting my "career path" and  
stating job objectives while  
the Personnel Department  

ne. my.ae-  

tion.

I filed my charge in May  
1972. By August I realized  
an attorney was necessary. I  
retained a Twin Cities att-  
orney experienced in dis-  
crimination cases.

Together we reviewed my  
case and awaited the outcome  
of the Department of Human  
Rights' investigation. In  
November 1972 the Commission-  
er of Human Rights delivered  
a decision--"no probable  
cause" to assume that my em-  
ployer had discriminated a-  
gainst me, and by extrapol-  
ation, against women as a  
class.

I was unhappy but not sur-  
prised. After some hesita-  
tion, I met with my attorney,  
and together we planned an  
appeal to the State Appeal  
Board.

In January 1973 my attorn-  
ey and I faced representa-  
tives of my employer at a  
Board hearing. I felt at  
the hearing that we made our  
point. My employer's agents  
found that slick phrases and  
expensive clothing were in-  
adequate defenses against my  
charges.

In April 1973 I was noti-  
fied that the Appeal Board  
had reversed the Commission-  

by Mary Hastings

er's finding and sent my  
case “back for reinvestiga-  
tion.

At this writing, the "re-  

investigation" has been com-  
pleted and I await the Appeal  
Board's further action in the  
matter.

In the interim, however,  
the laws governing filing of  
sex discrimination charges  
have been changed. (See  
February “Gold Flower" for  
article on changes in the  
law.) According to a Depart-  
ment attorney, the Appeal  
Board no longer has the final  
word in sex discrimination  
cases. The Board may rule,  
but the case must then return  
to the State Department of  
Human Rights for final dis-  
position.

One of the most frustrating  
elements—e experience  

has been the very confusing and  
seemingly complicated proced-  
ures the Minnesota Department  
of Human Rights follows in  
investigating a sex discrim-  
ination charge. Any woman con-  
templating filing a charge  
should be prepared to closely  
monitor the progress of her  
case through that Department.  
I have been told that under-
