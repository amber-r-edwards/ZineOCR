STALKING THE 'TERRA

The other morning I got up determined, meditated, smoked half a joint and did 20 sit-ups. Felt the same -- my revolutionary consciousness hadn't risen a bit so I went out. A friend, lately of Virginia said to me recently that loving is the essence of life and sometimes I wonder. I mean about our capacity for loving and potential capacity for hating or maybe it's the other way around except hating takes about seventeen times as much energy and you always have to remember to be mad or hateful so that means it's not really natural to our bodies but everything's mixed up now anyway to the point where some people even remember the times they were happy and loving because they have found themselves there so seldom. Anyway, as much as our culture has isolated us we're still contagious like friendly and horrible vibes. That's one thing that I learned from transcendental meditation was that positive happy vibes were catchy; and that a bus driver or a waitress has really a lot of influence on whole groups of people especially in rush hours. Hacking in Boston I was as dependent on my passengers for the mood tone as they were on me as fighting the traffic 9 hrs. makes one a bit spacey and maybe I came on a bit hard to some people but I got impatient.

Women were the most apprehensive towards conversation, some it's taking us so long to be friends to one another in the revolution. I wonder if the revolution can wait never mind loving one another, but the stoned barriers are beginning to crumble: the other day I saw 2 women on Hennepin Avenue holding hands but somehow with their lack of response. Of them even terrified;

Myths About Sex and Conception

-You can't get pregnant the first time you have intercourse.

False. Getting pregnant doesn't require any practice! The possibility of conception occurring depends upon the timing of intercourse with respect to ovulation and is not related to the amount of sexual experience.

-You can't get pregnant if you are a virgin (have not experienced vaginal penetration).

False. Sperm are able to swim past the hymen without any penetration into the vagina by the penis. If sperm are anywhere near the vagina, pregnancy is possible.

-You can't get pregnant if you are nursing an infant.

False. Ovulation can still occur, and some form of contraception is necessary to prevent conception.

*Look out for men who claim to be sterile. This claim may be false. In the first place, even if the man believes it to be true or knows that at one time it was true, this condition varies over time for many men, except when the result of surgery. Furthermore, some men use this as an excuse to avoid the bother of practicing contraception. It’s awkward to demand a laboratory report; nonetheless, be cautious about claims of sterilization.

*Women don't have as strong a sexual drive as do men.

False. A woman is a sexual being, and it is perfectly natural for her to experience sexual desire ("get horny") and to become sexually aroused as a result of either mental or physical stimulation. A woman's capacity for sexual desire and activity is as great as a man's. In fact, because intercourse is generally less demanding for a woman, she is capable of more sustained sexual activity than is a man. Becoming sexually aroused is largely a product of letting herself receive the sexual stimuli around her. If women seem to experience less sexual drive than men, it is often because they are too concerned with attracting sexual desire to be able to respond adequately themselves.

-If a woman does not experience "vaginal orgasm," she is “frigid.”

False. The vagina is almost completely without nerve endings, and orgasm is not a product of vaginal stimulation. The clitoris is the physical organ responsible for orgasm in the female. Orgasm can occur as the result of direct manual or oral stimulation or as the result of the action of the penis against the vulva during intercourse. It is the movement of the penis against the entrance of the vagina, not penetration into the vagina, that causes female orgasm during intercourse. Thus, those positions that provide the most friction of the penis against the vulva are most likely to provide female orgasm. Masters and Johnson report that the male-above-face-to-face position is one of the poorest in this respect.
