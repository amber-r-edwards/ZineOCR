"I couldn't not come here  
today because of how fantas-  
tic the women of this state  
are. I should be asking  

you the questions, like how  
did you do it, and would  

you like to move to New  
York?"  

Well-educated women, most  
of them married to afflu-  
ence, predominated in the  
group of women gathered to  
hear Gloria Steinem speak  
in support of the Minnesota  
women candidates. Gloria  
geared her comments to their  
interests, but did not cod-  
dle them. "Marriage...is  
locking up women long e-  
nough to figure out who  
sired the baby." And she  
spoke of the poor woman's  
problem in a rich woman's  
terms: "Every woman is only  
one man away from welfare."  

Most of the audience en-  
joyed the privilege of white  
skin. She spoke of our kin-  
ship with blacks.  

"The parallel between wo-  
men and all racial groups  
is the basic fact of Ameri-  
can life...As long as one  
group of people is discrim-  
inated against because of  
the way they look, we are  
all in danger."  

The audience included wo-  
men who have had to use  
"feminine wiles" to main-  
tain themselves. Steinem  
spoke of Uncle Tomming.  

"We all know what Uncle  
Tomm ing is, don't we? It's  
giggling and laughing around  
men, and giving our ideas to  
the man next to us so it  
will be accepted, and say-  
ing, 'Oh, how clever you are  
to know it's Tuesday.'"  

Many of the women present  
had married influential men.  

She spoke of Pat and Dick  
Nixon.  

"President Nixon vetoed  
the child care bill. It's  
interesting to note that Mrs.  
Nixon belonged to a group  
that favored that bill--  
which just proves that you  
can't marry power. You have  
to have your own."  

All of us were high on  
Sisterhood. It carried us  
to the Labor Temple where we  
embraced more of our sisters  
for another session of cath-  
artic self-acceptance.  

There Steinem and the audi-  
ence communicated in a regu-  
lar rhythm of humor and  
laughter, truth and applause.  
Her remarks generally sum-  
marized her morning's mater-  
ial. She described Nixon as  
a war criminal, and said  
that McGovern, while he did  
not have all the answers,  
"at least would not punish  
us as Nixon does."  

She described many women  
as "man junkies." We must  
have a man at our side; "if  
they only knew how little  
difference it makes which  
man it is."

recognition, then knowing  
applause.  

Steinem commented that one  
of the most subtle, chauvan-  
istic responses to the wo-  
men's movement is that men  
are so fragile, they wouldn't  
be able to function if  
women were equal--they would  
not be members "of the  
jockocracy in good standing."  

If we remember only two  
words from Gloria's message,  
let them be, "No More."  

"No more will we allow a power  
structure which allows all  
the typists to be one kind  
of person and all the money-  
makers to be another kind of  
person. Women are beginning  
to actively respond to this  
society, and their response  
is, 'No More!'"  

Ten years ago, I was a  
22-year-old newspaper re-  
porter in Duluth, Minn., with  
a surfeit of naive idealism  
about my ability to alter  
the world with my pen. In  
1962 there was no "women's  
movement."  

At that time, I read  
many fashion magazines. A  
young writer named Gloria  
Steinem appeared regularly  
in "Mademoiselle" and  
"Glamour." She wrote witty,  
bright features about "find-  
ing your fashion type" and  
more serious articles about  
young women working in jour-  
nalism and allied fields.  
She was an extremely attrac-  
tive young woman and often  
appeared in the fashion mag-  
azines as a model for would-  
be career women.  

One very cold, dank night,  
I leafed through a copy of  
"Show" magazine and stopped  
at an article by Gloria  
Steinem on her "undercover"  
stint as a Playboy Bunny.  
The story was well-written  
but, more important, there  
was a strain of real con-  
cern for and indignation  
about the state of women  
working in the Playboy Clubs.  
There was no name for wo-  
men's consciousness in 1962  
but Steinem displayed just  
that in her article. The  
kernel of some disquiet  
grew in my mind but laid  
dormant until two years ago,  
when I, along with millions  
of American women, joined  
the women's movement.  

Although my progress in  
the past 10 years has been  
modest and Steinem's im-  
pressive, I had an oppor-  

Steinem -- 10 Years After  
by Mary Hastings  

tunity to reflect on the  
similarity of all women's  
experience when I attended  
the DFL Women's Caucus Fund-  
raiser in one of the Dayton  
Mansions October 28.  

The handsome old rooms  
were filled with impressive  
political names--Don Fraser,  
Warren Spannaus, Richard  
Moe and Koryn Horbal. Joan  
Mondale attended. DFL  
women's candidates such as  
Phyllis Kahn and Linda  
Berglin were there. Women  
who were not interested in  
the women's movement and  
women who were passionately  
interested in the women's  
movement attended.  

The guest of honor and  
keynote speaker was Gloria  
Steinem.  

I had an opportunity to  
meet Steinem and speak  
briefly with her. She is  
one of the few "celebrities"  
I have ever met whose  
"persona" exceeded her  
press.  

She is a humane and in-  
telligent human being. She  
held the "name-filled" aud-  
ience in the palm of her  
hand: and inspired the poor-  
er audience that attended  
the afternoon rally in the  
Minneapolis Labor Temple.  

It was satisfying to  
realize that this woman, who  
10 years ago was limited to  
commenting on a circumscrib-  
ed "women's world" is now  
recognized for her leader-  
ship and humanity and is a  
national political force  
who will leave her mark on  
history.  

Women have progressed.
