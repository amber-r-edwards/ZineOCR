Dear Les,

As for me, becoming Gay  
has been a recent, agonizing  
tho beautiful process; a  
gradual, explorative, per-  
sonal struggle to effectively  
express yet accept my-  

self. To somehow come to  
terms with and survive the  
radical shifts in feeling  
and the meaning of my fami-  
ly, friends, job change, and  
sexual responses. In short  
a total shift of lifestyle  
and self-definition. There  
do not seem to be any “instant  
Gays." The shift—if  
it takes place—may be said  
to progress slowly through  
three stages each shading  
into the other two.  

1. Being open  

2. Being able  

3. Being committed  

I would like to add a fourth  
experience but am a bit  
unsure at this time—it re-  
minds me somewhat of the old  
saying about whistling in  
the graveyard. So OK, HERE  
GOES.  

4. Is that all there is?  
etc. HO-Hum.  

D. W. Cory once wrote  
teacher but life itself  
could have convinced me that  
homosexual passions do not  
come and go at will, but  
cling relentlessly to the  
last breath of life. When  
I awaken today and feel de-  
void of the drive that has  

dominated my personality, I  
smile and merely await its  
inevitable return.  

Now who am I? I am a mid-  
dle-aged Lesbian, sober  
Alcoholic, Mother—a contri-  
buting, productive member of  
society and one of God's  
children regardless of my  
sexual preference.  

Heedless of any other ethic-  
al verdict I do not accept  
the label of Queer or per-  
vert as applying to me or us  
—if you will.  

With consideration and  
truth we have struggled through  
the crisis of self-accept-  
ance to relearn our Moral  
A B C's in a fashion more  
painful than any Straight  
ever thought of. We have  
also learned the hard way  
that self-hatred is merely  
the refracted result of  
society's rejection. There  
may be many cautious Gays  
around but there are darned  
few cowardly Gays because  
honesty and courage are the  
natural byproducts of all  
who survive this shift.
