ASS

vee. Cloton -shot of adun-
gareed male with hands tuck-
ing a penis inside. some
manual adjustment then the
zipper, rather deliberately
up. a tug on the belt loops
to settle things as the cam-
era doesn't stray from the
subject at hand. something
moves and I blink, not sure
if I have seen what I think
I have; then IT moves again
and as the audience ejacu-
lates a few knowing chuckles,
I realize (oh no) that the
dungies are getting a hard-
on and we are witness to the
grandiose (read over-rated)
event. as the bulge bumps,
grows and gravitates west-
ward, into a rather accom-
modating hand, a gruffled
voice is beckoning: WAIT,
don't rush off...PLEASE COME
to the exciting season of
film greats at the U. (hence,
an alternate frame gives us
the origin of THE VOICE --
some kind of questionable
orifice / click - a penis!
(I confess I don't remember
much of what IT said because,
I think, I was too engrossed
with the action on screen).
-.-. and now about the
audience reaction-- broadly
appreciative. they really
dug it. I even admit that I
was laughing although I

couldn't figure out why...
how clever and unusual--
a talking penis. the topping
on the proverbial cake.
penises have personalities,
people names (you've all
heard of Peter and Dick and
let's not forget John Thomas)
so why not voices? I really
hate to disillusion you
fellas in the film dept.
but in case you haven't
noticed, pricks have been
doing most of the talking
now for years. so why did we
laugh? (a predominately fe-
male audience) maybe out of
embarrassment at having our
attentions focused on a male
sexual organ or an action by
such a thing. possibly it
revealed our fascination
with that particular part of
the male anatomy; certainly
the preoccupation of it by
the film's creators. more ap-
propriately, I think the
only just reason for laugh-
ter is obvious: it acknow-
ledges the true place of the
penis as an instrument of
ridicule. (personal note: I
think if we laughed more at
pricks they would become
less of a threat and/or nui-
sance to us.) I wonder just
how a talking clitoris would
be viewed. reaction? obscene.
not humorous. sexy??? then
to myself I began rational-
izing: I should be grateful

that they didn't present the
regular trip of a nude fe-
male body complete with ap-
propriate beauty and seduc-
tive posture saying something
ludicrous like come and
sample the goodies this sea-
son at the U. (woman as sex
object again) but it wasn't
men as sex object either. it
was sex object as (you guess-
ed it) sex object. but no
matter how you approach it,
it’s still the same old sex-
ist rub: BEHOLD BELOVED PRICK
POWER. males still dominate

the film media but not for

long (witness women's festi-
vals)..and penises are still
subject to fascination: (by
men anyway) (more suitable
would be by men ONLY) which
reminds me of what I had or-
iginally intended to rage
about--the ramifications of
man-hating, or more softly,
the unlimited possibilities
of loving women through the
rejection of men. maybe next
time, as I'm sure I've stir-
red up (more than) enough
curiosity about this abomi-
nable piece of celluloid for

everyone to rush out and see

it..so, at the University of
Minnesota Film Society, Bell
Museum of Natural History on
campus..... Allen Kraning and
his talking penis. something
to laugh at or about--take
your choice.
