ter. Ms. Hanson was surprised
to note that as much hustling
originated from the women as
from the men.

Ms. Hanson says she played
down the feminist angle and
never used the words "women's
liberation" because she knew
if she did, "it would never
sell--and I wanted to teach
this class." She and other
teachers at Vocational do see
some changes in behavior as a
result of her class. A couple
of colleagues have reported
that some of the young men
catch themselves in the mid-
dle of saying "girl" and
change it to "woman."

Sex and Race

Last year's curriculum at
Central High School in Minne-
apolis featured a class
called “Women's Search." The
students, all women, explored
the conditions of their woman-
hood.

Counselor Kathy Ertel,
assisted by English teacher
Jordan and teacher's aide Bes-
sie Green, led 3 weeks of com-
munication exercises. In ret-
rospect, the coordinators and
the students agreed that
these exercises were "absolut-
ely essential" to establish-
ing trust and opening lines
of communication in the class.

At times the exercises seem-
ed futile. Ms. Ertel said,
"We were very discouraged af-
ter some of the classes."
Sometimes they worked, and

the students began opening to
each other, but "by the time
they really got going, the
bell rang." They met at Ms.
Jordan's home to escape the
bell. A 4-hour "marathon"
ensued. Ertel asked the stu-
dents to sit in a circle next
to someone they did not feel
comfortable with. One of the
students noted, "Isn't it in-
teresting that we are sitting
black-white-black-white."

Race naturally colored all
their discussions, since the
class was half white and half
black. As Ms. Green remarked,
there would be a good discus-
sion going, they would really
be communicating, but "as soon
as race was mentioned, you
could almost see the class
split in two."

The black women, for exam-
ple, could not understand why
white women minded being put
on a pedestal. Green, who is
black, said, "I found that a
little hard to understand my-
self."

Another major topic was fe-
male physiology and sexual ac-
tivity. The women chose speak-
ers to invite to discuss vari-
ous subjects: birth control;
pregnancy; abortion, both pro-
and anti-; rape; homosexuality
and open marriage. A large
number of the students were
sexually active, while some
were not, so a wide spectrum
of experience was available in
the class.

Two male panels, one compos-
ed of teachers and one of stu-
dents at Central, offered the
class their viewpoints. The

coordinators concurred that
the panel of teachers was not
as effective as the panel of
students. Ms. Jordan observed
that they seemed less than can-
did, telling the women what
they thought they should hear.

On the other hand, as one of
the white women remarked, "I
cannot help it if I am white,
middle-class, Anglo-Saxon...I
felt just a little bit cheated
that we didn't spend equal
time discussing problems of
white women."

“They were adult men talking
down to teen-age 'girls.'"

She suggested that perhaps the
male teachers were more firmly
entrenched in their roles than
the male students.

When the male student panel
appeared in class, the women
reacted with giggles and ner-
vousness. After the panel
left, the class was very quiet.
One of the coordinators sugges-
ted they talk about the discu-
ssion. One of the students
said, "Maybe we should talk
about the way we acted so that
next time we can be more real."

Ms. Jordan said the coordin-
ators had hoped that some mea-
sure of sisterhood would be
established among the women,
"but that was very idealistic."
Their loyalties are still ra-
cial rather than sexual.

The students did, however,
decide to end the class with a
slumber party. The morning of
the party, one of the students
gave birth to a baby girl.

The class agreed that was a
fitting way to end the course.
