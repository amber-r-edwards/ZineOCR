MWPC’s “Minority” soca smaaess  
Women’s Workshop Resolution  

Minority women agree that their economic  
and social status in American society dic-  
tate that an unrelenting focus and all pos-  
sible energies be directed toward employ-  
ment, education, prison reform, breaking the  
welfare cycle, the best of comprehensive  
day care facilities and personnel, unfair  
percentage of conscription into armed  
services all contribute toward their snail-  
like pace toward gaining their fair share of  
goods and services for their families, com-  
munities and themselves. Although they  
agree that the general goals of the MWPC are  
laudable and necessary to improve the gener-  
al status of women, they feel that their  
focus on the above concerns, with the help  
of majority women in the caucus and certain-  
ly the approval of the MWPC Steering Commit-  
tee will help promote these basic necessi-  
ties. Further, it will gain greater support  
from their minority sisters who remain cool  
toward MWPC activities and all other current  
women's movements.  

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that a Task Force  
be established for all of the minority cul-  
tures, chaired by the minority women's work-  
shop discussion leader, to begin attacking  
the problems identified by the panel of  
minority women.  

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the ten individ-  
uals who signed up for the minority task  
force be the official base for developing  
sensitivity in MWPC toward:  

1) more visibility on panels, conferences,  
etc. throughout Twin Cities, suburbs and  
state;  

2) more reflection of minority women in  
MWPC literature (except for the YWCA, always  
seems to picture faces of the white women);  

3) development of skills bank of minority  
women;  

4) consciousness-raising efforts directed  
toward dispelling myths and prejudices held  
by both majority and minority women; and  

5) alleviating the threat minority males  
feel toward the women's movement as they are  
just beginning to fill new economic  
positions, but still encouraging minority  
women to develop and pursue individual  
creativity.

against AT&T, or the coalition with Shirley  

Chisholm which passed the new—now-vetoed—  
federal minimum wage bill."  
5) “we black women must get serious. A  
recent nationally held Black Women's Caucus  

charged $50 for registration" and there were:  

complaints. And, frequently we criticize  

the women's liberation movement for high  
eg a = O Se  

confusing racism and classism. -52% of  

blacks are in the middle class. ALL POOR  

women are affected by high registration  

fees."  

6) "non-participation. We must take  
offices. We must decide that the goals of  
the women's movement are our goals. We  
better get in there and work for ourselves  
and our sisters."  

7) “we see white women as members of  
white society. The role of white women  
has been defined in a racist society.  
I fear white women will take the place of  
white men. This is based on a media stereo-  
type. Rather, the women's movement wants  
the elimination of the oppression. We can-  
not attack one prejudice while ignoring  
others. I have found that the women oppos-  
ing school busing also oppose change in  
women's roles.  

"The first wave of the women's liberation  
movement was the battle for the abolition  
of slavery. It could never have been won  
without the coalition of the women's move-  
ment with the anti-slavery movement. When  
the right to vote came with the 15th amend-  
ment, black women were left out in the cold  
with white women."  

8) "the personal. There is no indictment  
of black women/white males while condemning  
black males/white females. White sexual  
partners are acceptable for black females,  
but not for black males. Power doesn't come  
from your extemporaneous relationships with  
black women or with white women. There is  
a new role for black women in both the civil  
rights movement and the women's liberation  
movement and that is to build bridges, links  
in the HUMAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT."  

Ms. Colom concluded her speech with a poem  
from Toni Cade's "The Black Woman, An Antho-  
logy," which ended, "'White womanhood is two  
enslaved; the difference is degree.'"
