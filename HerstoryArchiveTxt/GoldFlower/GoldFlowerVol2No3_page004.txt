Lesbianism == continued from page 3

for a lesbian mother regard-
ing child custody.

Two Washington men chal-
lenged their ex-wives who
were living together with
both women's children. With
the aid of a woman lawyer and
favorable testimony by sever-
al social workers, the women
retained custody of their
children.

But the women were ordered
by the court to no longer
live together nor even see
each other in the presence of
their children.

The MCLU has never had a
call concerning attempts by
the Welfare Department to
gain custody of children just
because their mother is a
lesbian.

Welfare tries to gain cust-
ody only if there is also a
reason to believe that the
mother isn't caring for her
children properly.

If a mother has to go to
court to retain custody of
her children, "most attorneys
will tell her to hush up her
lesbianism," said Browne.

Discrimination of lesbians
appears in written and un-
written forms.

Browne had much difficulty
in trying to find a landlord
that would rent to a "Lesbian
Resource Center." And once a
location for the center was
found, the telephone and pub-
lic utilities companies were
reluctant to connect their
services.

Browne, who is one of the
three women at the Lesbian
Resource Center who split a
$500 a month salary, predicts
difficulties the center might
have when it applies to the
state for incorporation.
"It's just hard for any gay
group to get a tax-exempt
status," she said.

The Lesbian Resource Center
as a whole has no definite
political philosophy so that
“all sorts of people feel
comfortable here," said
Browne.

"Yet, most lesbians are
obviously feminists," con-
cluded Livingston.

Few Alternatives

Before the Lesbian Resource
Center opened in mid-January,
Twin City lesbians had only
two places where they could
socialize as lesbians, Gay
House and "the bar."

But Gay House is male dom-
inated and never really at-
tracted that many women, said
Hanson.

Livingston continued,
"There was a lot of solidari-
ty at first but things kind
of died out. More women come
to the center than ever would
have come to Gay House."

In Minnesota there aren't
any laws, such as those in
California, which prohibit
kissing and handholding by
members of the same sex in a
bar. "Or if there are, no
one ever enforces them,"
Browne said.

Gay bars in the Twin Cities
are managed by "straights"
who can take advantage of the
fact that homosexuals have al-
most no place else to go to-
gether.

Hanson implied that the gay
bars are Chicago-syndicate
controlled and can afford to
"pay off" police so that the
bar's clientele won't be has-
sled.

If this is true or not,
Browne said that "the police
haven't given us any trouble
at the bars or the center."

Hanson thinks that a
"straight" syndicate can mo-
nopolize gay bars because the
high price of a liquor
license makes it impossible
for most gays to buy their
own bar.

Policeman Causes Trouble

Besides, owning a gay bar
can be a risky business.

A couple of years ago a
lesbian woman owned a gay bar
in a St. Paul suburb. One
night an off-duty policeman
came into the bar, allegedly
caused some confusion, then
called into his station with
false reports about what the
women were doing in the bar.

Upon closer examination of
the incident by a senior of-
ficer it was determined that
the policeman was at fault
for the disturbance and he
was subsequently discharged
from the force.

But the fear of being
exposed through publicity of
the event made most of the
lesbian patrons stay away
from the bar after that. The
bar soon closed.

Twin City lesbians' rela-
tive freedom from problems
with the police is a contrast
to Martin and Lyon's reports
in Lesbian/Woman of the con-
stant harassment of Califor-
nia police towards lesbians.

For women who don't care to
go to the bars, the Lesbian
Resource Center offers a
variety of activities. Dis-
cussion groups, theater,
films, dances, a coffeehouse
and softball team give les-
bians a chance to be in con-
tact with other lesbians.

Radicalesbians

The level of organized po-
litical activity varies among
lesbians of the Twin Cities
as it does among lesbians of
the country.

"Radicalesbians" are usual-
ly younger women who identify
politically and socially with
their minority. At the other
end of the spectrum are wom-
en, usually older, who are
so well established in their
communities and jobs that
they feel they stand to lose
too much personally if they
become politically active.
But all lesbians agree that
their rights are essential.
As Martin and Lyons state in
Lesbian/Woman, "No longer is
toleration acceptable. The
lesbians, along with all op-
pressed people, want freedom
and we want it now!"
