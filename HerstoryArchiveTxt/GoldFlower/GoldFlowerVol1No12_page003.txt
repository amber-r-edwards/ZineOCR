Letters to the Editor:  
Dear Goldflower:  

Although your name is  
that of a Chinese peasant  
woman, your position is that  
of the NOW women, liberal,  
professional, reform-minded—  
whose goal seems to be a  
mirror of the male world: we  
now see around us.  

This leaves out in the  
cold the women who want a  
complete change, who had en-  
visioned Women's Liberation  
as bringing about a new era  
in which compassion and  
human emotion would change  
all the structures that  
exist today so they could  
operate freely. When you  
talk about working women or  
the housewife or the Chicano  
or the Black women you  
talk about them, you make  
no effort to reach them.  
With the paper the way it is  
today, there is nothing in  
it for them.  

Your way, of course, is  
safe and you will make gains  
for the middle-class  
professional woman. The way  
I advocate has nothing to  
offer but struggle for an  
ideal. To open the minds of  
working women and housewives,  
to organize them, to build  
bridges to our sisters who  
have different colored skin  
will be difficult indeed in  
this time of official govern-  
ment repression and fear  
and hate. Yet this is the  
road, I feel, which will  
lead to real liberation, not  
only of women, but of men.  
This road, I believe, has a  
chance of ridding our coun-  
try of the twin cancers of  
war and racism. Does any-  
one besides myself want to  
follow it? Do you dare to  
print this letter?

Here's a copy of a letter  
I wrote to the Minneapolis  
Tribune that hasn't been  
printed as far as I know.

Dear Editor:  

The December 26 article by  
George Vessey, "More women  
hitchhike; more are assault-  
ed," exposes some often-  
heard biases. Considering  
that U.S. females earn lit-  
tle more than half of what  
males do for regular employ-  
ment, that we are systemati-  
cally discouraged and kept  
from access to the technolo-  
gy of automobile maintain-  
ance (and of weapons by the  
way), and that walking and  
mass transit dangers can  
leave one quite vulnerable,  
is it not surprising young  
women have become only a  
quarter of those resorting  
to hitching to make their  
way around? (I assume an-  
other fourth is not old  
women.)  

Though I've had some won-  
derfully good experiences  
while thumbing (usually a  
neglected aspect), I really  
wouldn't have minded being  
able to own and transport  
myself in the white busi-  
nessman's late model Buick  
in which I had the most  
fearful experience. I've  
read that in a European  
country (Czechoslovakia?)  
those who take the opportun-  
ity to drive cars are ex-  
pected to report the number  
of people to whom they give  
rides for the gas that's  
used. Those here who once  
abuse the privilege of shar-  
ing should be banned from  
the roads, not the needy  
travellers.  

If young women are statis-  
tically more subject to vio-  
lent crimes, the response  
should be training in self-  
defense and in practical  
hitchhiking skills, rather  
than legitimizing them as  
objects of violence. This  
seems to be happening when  
young men see a police cap-  
tain quoted as saying we  
(female hitchhikers) "prac-  
tically invite rape"—by our  
very existence apparently.  
When you see that the  
streets belong to the men,  
cars belong to the men, law  
enforcement also, and news-  
paper stories, you realize  
you have a place someone is  
trying to keep you in.  
"They placed themselves in a  
position where it could hap-  
pen to them," another police  
quote. Let's then name the  
game when I do retreat to  
the safety of one man's side  
—in his car or his house.  
How much protection racket  
and how much free choice in  
an atmosphere of justice and  
equality?

During the first workshop  
on lesbianism at The New  
Feminism conference held  
February 2nd, and 3rd, at  
the University of Minnesota,  
we spent at least thirty  
minutes fielding questions  
asked by one of the two men  
present in the room.
