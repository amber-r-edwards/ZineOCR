_|Where We’re At In

BY ADDIE MATTSON

In a sector of our society
that prides itself on pro-
gress and leadership, we all
as women, from the filing
clerk to the tokenism of the
boardroom, are confronted
with a deeply entrenched
mythology....A doctrine that
says that the woman in busi-
ness is a "girl", relegated
to the unsatisfying, dead-
end jobs - all the boring
stuff that no man would do
at any price; and then they
under-pay us into the "bar-
gain".

One by one we must destroy
the old, hard-line "facts"
of the business world and
lay them out for the dead
myths they are. We cannot
again be party to these
fallacies.

The first "fact" we face is
that "it's a waste of money
to train women for increased
responsibilities because they
will quit and have babies
when they marry anyway." More
and more women are not marry-
ing at all (this is now true
of 10% of all American women).
In the event they do marry,
women are having few chil-
dren, spaced closer together,
and are returning to the
labor force for 30 - 35 years.
In that time, a company will
profit many times over from
money spent training a
woman. At the very worst,
the return on investment
will be postponed a few
years.

Absentee Rates

Then, they tell us it costs
more to employ women because
their rate of absenteeism is
higher. This is false.
Women do have more frequent
absenteeism, a day or two

at a time -- but it's men
who are struck by major
surgeries and sicknesses
that cause long periods of
absence from work, and large
claims to group insurance
carriers as well.

Labor Department statistics

tell us that, overall, women
miss an average of 5.3 days

per year, while men miss 5.4
days per year. The figures

are very close, but they are
also in our favor.

These statistics do not even
reflect the fact that most
women work in repetitive
jobs that take their toll in
days missed from sheer bore-
dom. There are very few
women working in challenging
high-level jobs that have a
far smaller rate of absen-
teeism.

Known as the "Pin Money
Fallacy", one of the most
evil myths of all is the one
that says - women only work
for "pin money" or "to help
out", and that to promote a

woman over a man, or to
equalize her pay, isn't
right because a man has a
family to support.

This is the cruelest hoax of
all - more and more families
are headed by women. Nearly
50% of the women who work
today are those who are
heads of their families, whe-
ther through death, divorce,
separation, or those who are
single, or whose husbands
are disabled. One-third of
the families headed by these
under-paid women live in ac-
tual poverty with median in-
come ranging from $4000 to
$5600. This is substanti-
ally and shamefully below
the $8200 median income for
a family with only the male

partner employed!

Further, how can it be in
the best interest of a pro-
fit-making enterprise to de-
cide compensation and ad-
vancement on the basis of
family status rather than
individual merit?

Promotion Doubts

Very closely related to the
"Pin Money Theory" is the
one that says that promoting
a woman doesn't work because
men don't like to work for
women. This is purely and
simply a crock of rot --
most men have never worked
for a woman and have no ex-
perience on which to base
their prejudice. In fact,
the Labor Department says
that in cases where men have
worked under a woman super-
visor, better than 70% are
willing to work for other
women. But then, who needs
a fact when a good, old,
time-worn preconception will
do?

However, it is in this area
that the business world must
come face to face with a
cold hard fact of life. In
five years there will be one
million less men in the op-

timum managerial age group
(35 - 45 years) than now, at
the same time the demand for
managerial skills will be at
a historic peak. It is of
course deplorable that an
actual demand for women in
decision-making positions is
so contingent on the male
population, but women must
find ways to prepare them-
selves now to step into po-
sitions of real power in the
business world. It would
seem that we will be at last
having time and numbers on
our side.

At this point we confront

a myth perpetrated as much
by women as by men - the
idea that a woman must
either be a "femme fatale" or
a battle-axe" to achieve
success in business. Women
who make it to the top in

Business

the business world have had
to succeed against all of
these ingrained prejudices
in addition to mastering the
technical aspects of her job.
Too, a woman will have more
likely than not made the
grade without the invaluable
personal counseling that one
man will offer to a younger
man in the organization.
She will probably have not
had the advantage of a feel-
ing of support and encour-
agement from her own female
co-workers either. As yet,
we women have not learned to
be supportive of each
other's success. We are
still hung-up on the compe-
tition for a man's favors -
and this is as true in the
office as it is at a cock-
tail party.

Moving In, But Not Up

“Women are moving in, but
not up". This is a fact.
While more and more women
are entering the business
world (we now compose 38% of
the total labor force), the
wages/salaries paid to women in
business have declined. "The
median wage in 1970 for wo-
men was 59.4% of the median
wage for men -- a decrease
from nearly 64% in 1955."
(Labor Department statistic)

We are still by and large
the same secretaries and
clerks we were when women
first started entering the
business world in meaningful
numbers in the early part of
this century.

Not only are women mostly
involved with low-paying,
tedious jobs, but in cases
where women have managerial
level jobs, we are usually
paid less than men doing
identical or closely related
work.

Only 5% of top managerial
positions are held by women
and only 7% of them earn
salaries in excess of
$10,000. Not only that - a
woman in a managerial posi-
tion will in most cases be
more highly qualified -
academic rating, post-gradu-
ate training, self-disci-
plined, and harder working -
than her male co-worker -
because she has to be or she
wouldn't be hired to be paid
less than that male co-worker
in the first place.

And, that is where we're at
now. Most of us are still
clerical workers, still paid
less than men, still being
passed over for promotions,
still "the girls at the
office”.
