I was asked to write a col  
umn about Christmas, on the  
assumption that it is a holi-  
day of the "matriarchal  
witch cult" which has been  
"stolen" by men. It is not  
true that Christmas was a  
witch cult holiday, nor did  
they celebrate the winter  
solstice. Christmas has far  
more significance to women  
than that, and though the re  
quest caught me rather un-  
prepared, I'd like to write  
about the significance  
Christmas has for me. These  
ideas are based on mythology,  
and so are rather incomplete  
and subject to some modifi-  
cation as more information  
becomes available.  

Christmas is essentially  
celebrating the birth of a  
divine child, a recurrent  
motif in ancient mythology,  
but not apparently a feature  
of the witch cult. Information  
about Stone Age (ca  
50,000 BC for the period con-  
sidered here) religious  
practices comes from two  
sources—meager archaeological  
finds, and the traditions  
preserved in the witch cult  
(Margaret Murray, The Witch  
Cult in Western Europe). No  

by the Madonna and child.  

In Crete, where female-  
oriented society probably  
lasted to about 1500 BC,  
there was preserved the leg-  
end of the mother goddess  
Rhea and the birth of her  
divine child, the Cretan  
Zeus. Rhea bore him in a  
cave, surrounded by female  
and male votaries. The fe-  
male votaries were semi-  
divine nymphs who assisted  
at the birth and became the  
child's nurses. The male  
votaries were the Telchines,  
the smiths who used the  
cave, and the Kuretes,  
youths from nearby towns.  
The Cretan Zeus never over-  
shadowed his mother. The  
Greeks later gave Rhea to  
the male god Kronos as wife,  
but on analogy with other  
divine mothers, the birth  
was parthenogenic. The  
birth of Kore (a female) to  
Demeter, and of Hephaistos  
(the smith-god) to Hera are  
other examples of the birth  
of divine children to mother  
goddesses. (Mythological in-  
formation is based on a good  
deal of reading, and largely  
on H. J. Rose, A Handbook of  
Greek Mythology.  

doubt the witch cult had  
added to its original dogma  
through the centuries. For-  
tunately, in some aspects  
archaeology and witch-cult  
records agree. The Paleo-  
lithic practitioners of the  
witch cult buried their  
dead with grave goods, in-  
dicating a belief in an  
afterlife; they believed in  
a dual-sexed divinity which  
could become present in a  
person or animal, and which  
might have been killed and  
eaten as "holy communion."  
The medieval records do not  
discuss a mother goddess or  
a divine child, though the  
female face of the dual  
divinity was worshipped.  
Archaeology reveals the Stone  
Age Venuses, statues of very  
pregnant females. These  
were associated with fertil-  
ity.  

And The Male God Disappears  

It is possible that the  
witch cult originally con-  
tained the concept of a  
mother-goddess who gave  
birth to all living things,  
nourished them, and took  
them back to her in death.  
However, it appears that  
this concept came to great  
prominence in the early agri-  
cultural communities. At  
Catal Huyuk (James Mellaart,  
Earliest Civilizations of  
the Near East) the male god  
virtually disappears. It is  
also at Catal Huyuk (ca  
7000 BC) that the goddess is  
shown delivering and nursing  
a child. These mother and  
child figures were continual-  
ly popular around the Medi-  
terranean, and were replaced  

By Her Own Power  

The stable at Bethlehem  
was a cave. When Mary had  
given birth, the shepherds,  
who also used the cave, came  
to see. Angels, in some  
legends, also assisted at  
the birth. Mary gave birth  
parthenogenically. Feminists  
sometimes speak disparaging-  
ly of the "Virgin" Mary, and  
some Biblical scholars would  
have the word mean "young  
girl." Yet the virginity of  
Mary is an important symbol.  
The mother goddess brought  
forth children by her own  
divine power. When the  
power of the Greek patriarchs  
had increased to the extent  
that they gave Hera, the  
Argive mother goddess, to  
Zeus and made him the father  
of most of her children,  
they were forced to concede  
that she renewed her virgin-  
ity by bathing in a magic  
spring. The mother goddess,  
originally, was never domin-  
ated by men. Mary, too, was  
in a unique position vis a  
vis male domination. In the  
patriarchal Jewish-Roman-  
Greek society in which she  
lived, women were controlled  
by the father while they  
lived with him, and by the  
husband when they were mar-  
ried. Mary was not living  
at home, but travelling to  
Bethlehem with Joseph. Nor  
was she married. She and  
Joseph were betrothed—some-  
thing more formal than an  
engagement, but apparently  
not containing any contract-  
ual vows of obedience.  
Comparing Mary with the  
mother goddess should not  

A Christmas  

disparage Christianity.  
Rather, it should be enrich-  
ing to see that Christianity  
contains the best features  

of an older belief. If one  
believes that Christ's birth  
was arranged by God, is it  
not significant that God ar-  
ranged these parallels with  

a female-oriented religion?  
Is it not reasonable that  

God should reveal herself/  
himself to a female-oriented  
society as a mother, and that  
the birth of the divine child  
should be an important fea-  
ture of this revelation?  

Nor am I saying that Mary is  
a goddess. Her humanity is  
important in Christian trad-  
ition, for she represents  
the perfection we shall all  
attain. Never in ancient  
mythology did a human mother  
bear a fully divine child.  
This emphasis on humans do-  
ing divine work is integral-  
ly Christian.  

At any rate, whether we  
are Christian or not, we can  
see in Christmas a celebra-  
tion of birth. Of course,  
our biology has been deter-  
mining our destiny far too  
long. But Mary became preg-  
nant by her own choice, and  
delivered her child free of  
male domination. Whatever  
else we might want to do, it  
seems to me that feminists  
must begin to emphasize that  
the things women do, and  
have done for millennia, are  
vital, worthy of respect,  
sacred. In our patriarchal  
societies, the most idiotic  
things men do, like fight  
wars, are important, respect-  
able, even sacred, because  
men do them. The things wo-  
men do are unimportant, ridi-  
culous, obscene, because wo-  
men do them. Feminist inter-  
pretations of Christmas  
might emphasize the import-  
ance of birth as a symbol  
for all traditional "women's  
work.”  

The second facet of Christ-  
mas symbology is also relat-  

Meditation  

ed to the mother goddess.  
The story of the dying vege-  
tation god who is also the  
sacred king, dying for the  
people, apparently developed  
in the early days of patri-  
archy. The earliest known  
dying god is Sumerian Dumuzi  
who was cast into hell by  
his wife Inanna when he fail-  
ed to fall down and worship  
her. This is obviously pre-  
patriarchal, but Dumuzi is  
not a vegetation god. The  
more patriarchal Semites  
picked up the motif of the  
dead god and applied it to  
the seasonal death of vege-  
tation (they pronounced his  
name Tammuz). The death of  
Tammuz and his fellows—  
Attis, Osiris, etc.—are  
said to reflect the habit of  
king-killing to ensure fer-  
tility. This was probably  
not a pre-patriarchal habit.  
Yet from it comes the idea  
that the divine child is the  
savior-king who will die for  
the people.  

Not Son, But Lover  

In the Egyptian legend of  
Isis and Horus, the divine  
child saves the people from  
the drought god, Set. The  
divine child Horus does not  
himself die for the people,  
but his "father" Osiris did.  
Phrygian Attis, divine child  
of the mother goddess  
Kybele, does die. Adonis,  
another dying god, is not  
the son but the lover of the  
great mother. Evidently, in  
patriarchal times, the  
legend of the king who dies  
to save the people was  
grafted onto the legend of  
the divine child. This  
prefigures the Christmas  
story, as the baby Jesus is  
the savior and king who will  
die for the people. The  
earlier dying savior-kings  
were never "quite" divine in  
legend and cult. They seem  
to have been people who were  
"taken over" by a god.  
Christ is considered as God  
incarnate.  

The actual date of Christ-  
mas was taken from the pa-  
triarchal Druidic feast of  
the winter solstice, when  
the sacred mistletoe was cut  
from the oak (symbol of the  
supreme god, not goddess),  
and human sacrifices were  
offered to ensure the return  
of the sun. The Druidic  
religion also embodies the  
tradition of king-killing,  
which we have seen as a pa-  
triarchal addition to the  
myths about the mother god-  
dess. It seems unfortunate  
that this date was chosen,  
and that such customs as the  
Yule log and mistletoe were  
adapted from the patriarchal  
feast.  

I don't know to what trad-  
ition Christmas gift-giving  
might be ascribed, though  
it seems likely that a  

divine child would be given  
gifts. The Telchines are  
said to have given the Cre-  
tan child things to play  
with. I like to reflect on  
the countless women who  
sacrificed time and energy  
to make Christmas gifts and  
bake Christmas goodies. I  
would not like to say such  
efforts were foolish. Fe-  
male artists have worked  
with thread and yarn and  
dough for millennia. They  
have been ignored and derid-  
ed for millennia. Will we,  
feminists, also deride their  
work? Cooking is something  
women do every day, but male  
chefs do as a creative pro-  
fession. Yet the tradition-  
al Christmas recipes were  
each invented by some woman  
acting creatively in one way  
that was open to her. So  
too with needlework. The  
male who changes skirt  
lengths is a creative pro-  
fessional; the woman who in-  
vents a new design for a  
quilt or a sweater is just  

a housewife.  

Now that we look forward  
to new ways of acting out  
our creativity and our love  
for others, I look back at  
Christmastime to the valiant  
women who kept alive the  
fragile coals of independ-  
ence. Much of our heritage  
has been lost. We shall  
never recreate the old fe-  
male-oriented religion.  

BY HELEN VICTRY  

But, perhaps because women  
surrounded the feast with good  
food and presents and merri-  
ment, the Christmas cele-  
bration preserves for us the  
mother and the divine child,  
a deliberate link with that  
older religion. Perhaps  
from such links we can in-  
fuse the religions of our  
culture with reality, fem-  
inist reality.  

There is a lot to change  
in Christmas. From artful  
handcrafts and creative  
baking, we have unfettered  
materialism. From the cele-  
bration of birth and the im-  
portance of women, we have  
office Christmas parties.  
Some say the whole affair  
should be junked. I would  
rather fight to keep Christ-  
mas as our ancestresses kept  
it. We must not only create  
our own holidays, we must  
renew what was ours. We who  
are creating a new world  
ought to remember at Christ-  
mas those who have gone be-  
fore: those who lived in a  
female-oriented society who  
made the legend of the  
divine birth; those who  
lived in a male-dominated  
society who kept alive this  
reminder that women and what  
they do are important and  
worthy of respect; those who  
used Christmas as a focus  
for creativity and intelli-  
gence when all other  
channels were denied them.
