Americans Still Pursue by Mary Hastings

‘Bliss Machine” and “Perpetual Plastic’

Little Chapel of the Flowers  
"...nestled between a Texaco  
station and the Yucca Motel."  
The typical Las Vegas wedding  
offers a couple (for an addi-  
tional fee) a white rose cor-  
sage, a license with a white  
bow and “artificial greenery and  
flowers" or “perpetual plastic"  
in Las Vegas parlance.

Perhaps we have been wrong.  
We who have taken the institu-  
tion of marriage seriously. We  
who have taken it seriously in a  
number of ways: By fighting it,  
by striving for it, by trying to  
change it.

It has become clear to me  
that those individuals who plac-  
idly accept marriage as a "sine  

qua non", who readily take those  
vows and comfortably break them,  
really have the proper attitude  

toward marriage.

Now comes Marcia Seligson  
and her book, The Eternal Bliss  
Machine, (304 pp., William  
Morrow & Company, Inc., $7.95).  
She confirms my suspicion that  
marriage is, at best, a form  

to be ignored. Seligson's  

book is subtitled, "America's  
Way of Wedding". And the auth-  
or attempts to exhaust the top-  
ic of marriage as did Jessica  
Mitford that of death in The  
American Way of Death. Selig-  
son fails in her attempt.

Do we laugh or cry? At  
this point, I choose to laugh.  
I cannot take marriage seri-  
ously. I was mildly surprised  
when I finished this book to  
find that I could care less  
about marriage or the author's  
revelation--telegraphed early  
in the book--that more Amer-  
icans than ever are marrying.  
My not very nice reaction is:  
Let them.

customs. Under such chapter  
headings as "The Love Machin-  
ery," "The Dream Brokers" and  
"All Decked in White", Selig-  
son shares with us:

Perhaps joining one's life  
with another is more subject-  
ive, thus less readily quanti-  
tated, than is the great ob-  
jectifier, death. And per-  
haps the author's own bias (to  
view matrimony with some amuse-  
ment) precludes a "weighty"  
tone. At any rate, Seligson's  
book emerges as a sometimes  
amusing, usually interesting  
report on the author's person-  
al observations as "member of  
the wedding".

bride scaling a step ladder to  
the top of her wedding cake  
and handily wielding a large,  
silver knife to produce the  
first, symbolic (?) slice of  
cake.

Seligson begins with a cul-  
tural anthropologist's view of  
marriage. Although these first  
two chapters are deceptively  
earnest, the author does re-  
veal:

--The Jewish wedding with  
the 'flying chuppa' (either a  
symbol of the groom's tent or  
the couple's new home) where  
doves were contained over the  
canopy, released with a flour-  
ish at the 'I do' and all  
floated to the floor--dead."

~-The first marriage con-  
sisted in a male of one  
tribe raiding another  
tribe, kidnapping a female  
and carrying her off.

~-The gold wedding band  

is a symbol of the tether  
around the female's waist  
to facilitate capture.  
(Alas for the vapours  

of Victorian poets and pre-  
1963 songwriters.)

Group meetings will  
start in late June and will  
be held in Health Service  

meeting rooms.

The sessions will be  
staffed by two women from  
the Center and two women  
from the Health Service.  
Groups will form accord-  
ing to participants’ con-  
sciousness. Each group  
will meet about two hours  
per week.

--The primitive male mind  
anchored in endless terrors  
of the unknown, feared wo-  
men perhaps above all else.  
All the aspects of female-  
ness--in their enigmatic  
difference from the male  
structure and function--  
became sources of dread."

at the Women's Center for  
specific information about  
date, time and place of  
the first meetings.

After establishing the  
history of marriage, Seligson  
progresses to an examination  
of America's current marriage
