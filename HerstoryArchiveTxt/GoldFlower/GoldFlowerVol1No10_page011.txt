LECTURES  
PLANNED  
ATU OF M  

Five prominent academic  
women will appear at the Univ-  
ersity of Minnesota this quart-  
er in conjunction with an Amer-  
ican Studies course called "The  
Effects of Feminism on Ameri-  
can Intellectual Life." (Am St-  
3-801).  

Anne Firor Scott, Carroll  
Smith Rosenberg, Jacquelyne J.  
Jackson and Carolyn Kizer will  
present public lectures as well  
as meet with course partici-  
pants. The fifth speaker has not  
yet been announced.  

"We have sought women with  
respectable academic credentials,  
rather than first looking for  
feminist credentials," says  
course coordinator Elsa Greene.  
"They will address themselves to  
the question of whether others  
in their field are affected by  
feminism.  

"We will focus," continues  
Greene, "on the fact that the  
first feminist movement failed  
to acquire additional status for  
women—we can vote but do not have  
much power. This time, are fund-  
amental values being changed?"  

Historian Anne Firor Scott  
inaugurates the program on Jan-  
uary 15. Senior Fellow at the  
Johns Hopkins Institute of South-  
ern History, Scott is a special-  
ist in the history of southern  
women. Not a recent convert to  
the discipline, she has been a  
historian of women since the  
1940s.  

On January 31, Carroll  
Smith Rosenberg, assistant prof-  
essor of history and psychiatry,  
at the University of Pennsylvania,  
will discuss the history of psy-  
chiatric thought. Rosenberg has  
studied the hysterical woman from  
a historical perspective. She  
has also studied lesbian women.  
In addition, she has researched  
the development of women's hist-  
ory as a discipline, and its re-  
lation to psychological theories  
of women.  

Sociologist Jacquelyne Jack-  
son, associate professor of medi-  
cal sociology at Duke University  
and chairman of the Black Soci-  
ologists Caucus of the American  
Sociology Association, will speak  
February 14 on the relation of  
Black women to the dominant soc-  
iety and to feminism. A Black  
activist, she will also address  
herself to the effect of feminism  
on social theories.  

Poet Carolyn Kizer, director  
of the graduate writing program  
at Columbia University and author  
of "Pro Femina," appears Feb-  
ruary 28 to discuss poetry and  
feminist consciousness.  

All lectures are open to the  
public with no admission charge;  
all begin at 8 p.m. in Murphy  
Hall Auditorium, University of  
Minnesota Campus.  

COLLEGES EXPAND  

WOMEN’S  

While no college or univ-  
ersity in the Twin Cities area

vey of local institutions of  
higher learning indicates.  

The following list, while  
not exhaustive, reveals that

their history.
