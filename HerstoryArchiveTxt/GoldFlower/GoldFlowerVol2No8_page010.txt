After she had been home for several weeks,  
Rebecca was still disappointed about the for-  
ceps delivery.  
"I wondered if by squatting  
or sidelying I could have dislodged the baby  
myself."  

She and Jose went to Sharon's office with  
their questions and went through the whole  
birth experience step-by-step. They questioned  
each other as to things they could have  
done differently or how they could have mis-  
read the situation.  
After their discussion,  
"I felt tremendously better, this big thing lifted off me."  

As to Rebecca's impressions of how they  
could have avoided the forceps episode, Re-  
becca said that Sharon wasn't condescending,  
she didn't have the "how dare you question  
me" attitude I've gotten from other doctors?  
"We reached conclusions together and that  
made her feel a part of us.  
It was really good."  

The Barriero's plan to leave the country  
next year, but Rebecca plans to return to  
Sharon for the birth of their second child.  

And the doctor with his handy forceps  
didn't recognize Rebecca when she went for  
her five-weeks checkup.  
"He thought I was a new patient."  

Twin Cities Obstetrics  

With all there is to  
choose from, a woman can either find exactly the kind of  
obstetrical care she wants or  
make a lot of mistakes. Here  
are some suggestions for  
choosing wisely.  

1. If you are interested  
in having a midwife attend  
you, there are two nurse-mid-  
wives in the Twin Cities who  
have private practices, Mar-  
garet Hewitt of Hennepin  
County General Hospital and  
Sharon Rising of the Univer-  
sity of Minnesota School of  
Nursing. Sharon has some  
friends who will soon be set-  
ting up practices and either  
woman would know if other  
midwives are available.  

2. The time and establi-  
shment honored ways to locate  
a physician are to call the  
local medical society or med-  
ical school.  

With the Hennepin County  
Medical Society, you are tak-  
ing pot luck. When one of  
the Society's 2,000 physi-  
cians has an opening, the cen-  
tral desk is notified and you  
get the names of three doc-  
tors in your area.  

The AMA advises prospective  
patients to call their  
local university or medical  
school and describe the  
kind of care you want.  

3. The Childbirth Education  
Association (CEA) has de-  
vised a more personal app-  
roach. By calling the CEA  
class registration number, you  
can also obtain a list of doc-  
tors supportive of prepared  
childbirth and couple parti-  
cipation. The doctors are re-  
commended by those who have  
taken a CEA course. You will  
also be given the home phone  
number of a person who reco-  
mmended that doctor. Call,  
chat with a satisfied customer  
and see if their philosophy a-  
grees with yours. Thus, you  
can save yourself the hassle  
and cost of an office visit  
and get a personal view.  

4. The La Leche League  
does the same kind of referral  
in a less extensive, less or-  
ganized way. They can help  
you find a doctor supportive  
of breastfeeding, however.  

5. Call the individual doc-  
tors you are interested in.  
If they don't inspire confi-  
dence or if you disagree with  
their approach, hang up and  
try again.  

6. Referral agencies such  
as Community Line can give you  
names of agencies and hospi-  
tals but make no individual  
recommendations.  

Sister Mary Meyer of St.  
Joseph's Hospital in St. Paul  
recently completed a survey  
of hospitals offering OB ser-  
vice in this area. She found  
that there are 20 hospitals  
with maternity wards opera-  
ting at 40 percent occupancy.  
In order to economize, some  
are combining gynecological  
departments with OB depart-  
ments.  

According to Sister Meyer,  
both kinds of patients are  
not getting the kind of care  
and attention they deserve.  

So be mindful that when  
you choose an obstetrician or  
family doctor or midwife,  
you are also choosing the hos-  
pital he or she practices in.  

Hospitals are competitive,  
consumer facilities--business-  
es. You are the consumer and  
have every right and an obli-  
gation to yourself to ask que-  
stions.  

Feel free to call the mat-  
ernity wards of individual  
hospitals to ask about facili-  
ties. Tour several and com-  
pare them. Remember, you are  
paying them for their serv-  
ices. If you don't like what  
you see, you probably don't  
live far from a hospital more  
to your liking.  

Feel free to question your  
doctor or midwife about hosp-  
ital and personal policy, too.  
Are fathers allowed in the  
delivery room? On whose  
terms--their permission or  
your request? Can you have  
rooming-in (having your baby  
in your hospital room with  
you)?  

You have the right and an  
increasing opportunity to get  
the kind of childbirth care  
you desire. Don't stop look-  
ing until you are satisfied.  
Having a baby isn't a time for  
worry or questions. It is a  
time to celebrate.
