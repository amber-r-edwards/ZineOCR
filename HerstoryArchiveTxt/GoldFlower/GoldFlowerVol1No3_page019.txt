I happened to run across  
this book when browsing in a  
downtown bookstore in Minne-  
apolis. It was so inspira-  

tional to me that I ran out,  
bought a canvas and composed  
my very first painting.  

something like this:  

It looks

I thought the best way to  
review the book was to tell  
the story behind the paint-  
ing. It is a painting of  

matriarchal legend. All of  
it is described in the first  

part of the book. Miss Davis  
goes on to trace Sagen’s her-  

story through to the present.  
It is not the truth or fal-  
sity of any of her hypotheses  
that the reader is left with  
at the end of each chapter,  
but the overall sense of  
pride and power in being fe-  
male, of knowing that nothing  
could be more natural than  
matriarchy and that the world  
now suffers because the god-  
dess was murdered and raped  
by patriarchal barbarians--  

barbarians who then system-  
atically buried every shred  
of female dignity they could  
find in attempts to keep wo-  
man from her natural state of  
superiority.  

In the beginning there was  
the great goddess; she creat-  
ed the heavens and the earth.  
It simply made sense that the  
first deity was a woman, the  
mother of creation, following  
from her biological function.  
Recent archaeology has un-  
covered numerous women cen-  
tered cities dating back as  
far as 10,000 BC and farther.  
These cities appear very ad-  
vanced technologically for  
their time. Many had elab-  
orate plumbing systems.  
Many had no protective walls  
or apparent mechanisms for  
self-defense, suggesting the  
absence of war. Homes ap-  
pear equal in size, suggest-  
ing that all people shared  
approximately equal material  
possessions. Though these  
people were aware of each other's exist-  
ence, certain symbols were  
common:  

THE CRESCENT MOON was sacred  
to the matriarchy. As the  
mothers lived on the earth,  
in natural surroundings,  
they watched the moon and  
saw that its monthly cycle  
paralleled the menstrual  
cycle of woman. Both went  
full cycle in twenty-eight  
days. This unity between  
themselves and nature, a  
unity which they did not  
understand but which they  
held sacred, was symbolized  
by the crescent moon and the  
number twenty-eight. The  
matriarchal calendar was  
made up of thirteen months,  
each with twenty-eight days.  
Following the cycle of the  
moon. After the patriarchal  
wars which destroyed the  
matriarchal cities, men  
instituted a twelve-month  
year. Each month had an odd  
number of days and the rulers  
named the months after them-  
selves: July for Julius  
Caesar, August for Caesar  
Augustus and so on and so  
forth ad nauseam. Thirteen  
became an unlucky number.  

THE BULL was sacred to the  
great goddess. Bull horns  
were placed over the altar  
in the center of the home.  
Some contend that the bull  

was a phallic symbol, others  
that it was sacred because  
its horns form a perfect  
crescent.  

THE RED RAIN, an ancient  
myth, is said to have been  
the menstrual blood of the  
great goddess.  

WOMEN DEVELOPED FARMING and  
first learned to cultivate  
the soil.  

ART BEGAN when women first  
painted on the walls of  
caves. Fine drawings of red  
flowers with white centers  
forming the face of a woman  
with a wreath of flowers  
around her head have been  
found by archaeologists dig-  
ging in unrelated places.  

THE MIGHTY OAK TREE was the  
legendary home of the great  
goddess. The first chalice  
was carved from wood in the  
shape of an oak tree. Later  
King Arthur chased after the  
holy grail in the patriarch's  
attempts to co-opt matriar-  
chal legend.  

TWO CRESCENTS touching at  
both ends was a female sex  
symbol to the ancient moth-  
ers. It symbolized the  
vulva.  

TWO CRESCENTS touching at  
one end, resembling a horse  
shoe, was a good luck charm.  

THE WOMAN'S SYMBOL is said  
to have been the sacred  
beneath the full moon--  

THE DOUBLE EDGED AX was a  
tool used for many domestic  
purposes. Its shape con-  
nected the outline of four  
crescents. In addition, it  
resembles the butterfly,  
which was a symbol of immor-  
tality.  

THE EGG, for obvious reasons,  
was a fertility symbol.  

THE GOLDEN AGE has been  
sought after ever since pa-  
triarchy brought an end to  
mother rule. Centuries lat-  
er the people still remem-  
bered the "land of milk and  
honey", the land of matriar-  
chy. Milk was an obvious  
reference to mother. Honey  
referred to the natural ma-  
triarchy of bees.  

The great goddess is said to  
have appeared to the people  
in the form of a serpent.  
Coincidentally, the patriar-  
chal satan appeared in the  
same form.  

There can be no doubt that  
patriarchy has deliberately  
suppressed the history of  
matriarchy. Thanks to  
Elizabeth Davis and other  
Feminists who are beginning  
to uncover our past, the  
age of the bull will no  
longer be forgotten.
