During the second work-  
shop, we spent at least ten  
minutes deciding if we  
"should" or "should not" al-  
low men to be present in the  
room.  

Forty fucking minutes.  
Almost one-third of our al-  
lotted “lesbian workshop”  
time spent dealing with men.  
At a feminist conference.  

I think about that, sisters.  

And I think of the endless  
amounts of time and energy  
that I have spent, since  
first becoming involved with  
feminism, answering ques-  
tions from men, fielding  
their attacks, thinking  
about their criticisms,  
listening to their judge-  
ments, trying to "change"  
their sexist attitudes, and,  
at times, watching an ex-  
tremely verbal man out-argue  
a feminist sister who was  
incapable of expressing her  
anger "debate-style.”  

And I think it's about  
time we quit.  

It's about time we quit  
wasting our energy defending  
ourselves against male ego-  
tripping attacks.  

It's about time we quit  
spending one-third, one-  
ninth, or ANY of our time  
listening to men, when our  
revolution will be achieved

The contents of "Gold  
Flower" issues are determin-  
ed, quite naturally, by the  
interests of our contribu-  
tors. Since a relatively  
small number of women is  
presently involved in the  
production of the paper, we  
depend on contributors for  
a diversity of subjects and  
viewpoints.  

If women are not satis-  
fied with our coverage of  
women's issues, we ask for  
contributions from them of  
any kind which will help to  
fill in the gaps. If you  
cannot make it to meetings,  
send us things in the mail.  
But let us hear from you.
