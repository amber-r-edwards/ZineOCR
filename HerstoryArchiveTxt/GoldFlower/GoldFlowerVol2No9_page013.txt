Working Women Band Together

by Heidi Reidell

Women in Minneapolis are

working for bread, not jew-
els. As in all other parts
of the country, the bread
seems more like crumbs—
fully employed women earn $3
for every $5 earned by their
male counterparts. The dis-
crepancy in pay has widened
during the past 15 years, but
the mechanics for change in
Minneapolis are growing
stronger.

The stereotype of the work-
ing girl who leaves her job
to marry and have children
doesn't hold up today. Three
fifths of the working women
in Minneapolis are married
and living with their hus-
bands and one-third are moth-
ers with children under the
age of six.

Most women work to raise
their families' living stand-
ard. In families where the
husband earns between five
and seven thousand dollars
per year, 46% of the wives
work. In Minneapolis, 15% of
working mothers are heads of
households and only 5% of
these women receive welfare
funds. One fifth of working
women are single and self-
supporting and few women have
the luxury of working solely
for personal fulfillment.

Women have always worked to
support themselves and their
families. But since the in-
dustrial revolution women
have left the home and enter-
ed a labor system based on
the obsolete assumption that
they are marking time until
they can retire to the kit-
chen.

Women's role in the labor
force has changed radically
in the last 50 years. The
average woman worker in the
1920s was 28 years old and
single. She comprised 20% of
the labor force and had a life
expectancy of 55 years.

Today, the average working
woman is 39, married and was
30 years old when she sent her
last child off to school. She
can expect to live to be
75 years old.

Working women today are
highly educated. One woman
in ten has a college degree.
However, of the 91,000 work-
ing women in Minneapolis, 42%
have clerical jobs (5% higher
than the national average)
and only 3% are in managerial
positions (0.3% higher than
the national average). In
executive positions, men out-
number women 600 to 1.

From counterculture women's
organizations to a drop-in
center at the YWCA, women are
helping each other find jobs,
training and adequate day-
care facilities.

Aside from social and pol-
itical women's groups, self-
help professional groups are
forming. One such group,
Women in Communication, has
a job placement service
where women exchange inform-
ation about job openings that
are not usually announced pub-
licly.

Some local groups are aff-
iliated with national organ-
izations. Efforts are un-
derway to start a service
modeled after Catalyst, an
organization that places wom-
en in jobs and also pairs wo-
men with similar training so
they can share one job and
work part-time.

Within individual companies
women are becoming more vo-
cal about equal pay, job ad-
vancement and adequate day-
care for their children.

Careers are no longer a
secondary concern of women.

Many are choosing to postpone
having children at all. Those with
small children are working
in increasing numbers. Thir-
ty-five percent of mothers
with children under six are
working.

There are gross inequities
in pay scales, hiring and
promotion policies in Minn-
eapolis and the nation. But
the tools of change are be-
ing wielded by many deter-
mined and dedicated people
in this city.

The traditional female occ-
upations are filled to over-
flowing. Career planners see
expanding job opportunities
in the professions (medicine,
science, engineering, law,
architecture) and in voca-
tional careers (electronics,
mechanics, etc.).

But changing a nation's
labor structure takes time
and effort. The southern
congressman who tacked the
word sex on the 1964 Civil
Rights law in order to quash
the effort, inadvertently
gave women one of their most
powerful tools of advance-
ment. From this legislation
came the momentum for poten-
tially powerful legal action
against sex discrimination
and for legally required
affirmative action programs.
The mechanics to equalize
pay and promotion policies
are there.

Those involved in chang-
ing women's role in the em-
ployment world point to one
vital force of change—the
women themselves. And women
in Minneapolis are banding
together to better their
employment situation.

Harriet Lansing and Judy
Oakes, two attorneys, have
opened Minnesota's first
all-women law firm in St.
Paul.

Located at 400 Sibley St.,
Oakes & Lansing is one of
some half-dozen women's firms
in the nation.

Although they will not be
restricting their practice
to women, the lawyers feel
that their feminist philo-
sophy will affect their en-
tire practice.
Assisting
Wells, law clerk, a stu-
dent at William Mitchell Law
School.

Both Lansing and Oakes are
graduates of the University
of Minnesota Law School.
Oakes previously was an as-
sistant attorney general for
the state of Minnesota (the
first woman to be promoted
to that post) while Lansing
was a city attorney in St.
Paul (the first woman to
be appointed to that position)
