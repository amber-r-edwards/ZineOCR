ERA Passes House, Faces Senate--

Will Bill’s Fate Affect Future Women’s Lobbying?

by Mary Hastings

The Minnesota House of
Representatives passed the
Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)
by a vote of 106 to 24 Jan-
uary 17.

The Amendment, which en-
countered heated opposition,
may face even stronger re-
sistance in the State Sen-
ate. Sen. Jack Davies (L,
Dist. 60), has scheduled a
hearing on the Amendment
before the Senate Judiciary
Committee January 23. Dav-
ies has the option of set-
ting as many hearings on the
Measure as he deems necess-
ary.

The ERA states: "Equality
of rights under the law
shall not be denied or abri-
dged by the United States,
or any State, on account of
sex."

The measure must be rati-
fied by 38 states; at pre-
sent 22 states have ratified
the ERA.

ERA is vital to women's
progress toward economic and
social freedom. But the bill
is only the first--and
seemingly "non-controversi-
al"--step in that direction.
Nonetheless, ERA has elicit-
ed emotional opposition from
such groups as Happiness of
Women (HOW), The American
Legion, The John Birch Soc-
iety, The Ramsey County Re-
publican Women's Association
and The Minnesota T-Party.

It is doubtful that the
wildly irresponsible charges
of anti-ERA forces will de-
feat the bill in the State
Senate. However, the oppo-
sition may produce an un-
desirable effect in our leg-
islators and women fighting
for ERA. If an ERA victory
is hard-won, legislators may
feel smug about their polit-
ical "morality" in support-
ing a "controversial" mea-
sure. And women may exhaust
themselves in the fight for
ERA and retire from the field
with little desire to reded-
icate themselves to the nec-
essary work that must be
done to pass an abortion re-
peal bill, comprehensive
child-care legislation and
welfare reform measures.

Local Women's Movement
groups have dedicated them-
selves to passage of the
ERA. The Coalition to Rat-
ify the ERA has placed eff-
ective lobbyists at the State
Legislature.

History of Gold Flower and Staff

Gold Flower, a monthly Twin
Cities women's publication, is
named for a Chinese peasant wo-
man whose life typifies the stru-
ggles of many women. While in
early life, she flaunted conven-
tion by loving the man of her
choice, Gold Flower later accept-
ed an arranged marriage, in
which she lived miserably. Fin-
ally, banding together with other
village women, she achieved a
personal liberation during the
Chinese political revolution.
This melding of personal and pol-
itical speaks strongly to modern
feminists and for this reason we
have chosen Gold Flower's name
as our own.

Minnesota Women's Political
Caucus (MWPC), predicts that
ERA will pass the State Sen-
ate but may face stronger
opposition than in the House.

Dieterich noted that the
MWPC will also dedicate lob-
bying efforts to the passage
of an effective child care
bill this Session. MWPC
will work with The Child-
ren's Lobby and the Coali-
tion for Comprehensive Child
Care in this effort.

The 1971 Legislature app-
ropriated $250,000 for The
Child Care Facilities Act.
Dieterich explained that the
appropriation should be in-
creased, but the Governor
hasn't asked for an increase
in his budget message.

Dieterich said that
$700,000 would be a "reason-
able figure".

"I think the initial
request will pass," she
added. But the possibility
of an increased appropria-
tion is uncertain.

She added that MWPC will
cooperate in supporting an
abortion bill later in the
legislative session.
