more like men, or doing what it is men do  
in this culture. But on the contrary  
changing that whole concept as well.  

"We are not after equality or tokenism  
whether it is Margaret Chase Smith or  
Bernadine Dorn. We are, in fact, after  
power... 5"  

"I am not talking about reforming the  
system or revising the system or making the  
patriarchy nice or some kind of wonderful  
humanistic glow. I am talking about a world-  
wide feminist revolution. And in fact a  
gynocracy in which women own all secular and  

Robin Morgan Continued  

I am talking about rage which is right and  
justifiable and firm and beautiful. A right  
to 'man hating' as a class. Because the  
class of men, as oppressors, hurt and the  
class of women, as oppressed, have a right to  
hate where that hurt is coming from. Taking  
one's own feelings seriously enough to go as  
far as they will take one. And you can't do  
that alone because you will think that you  
are going mad in the old way. That is why we  
need each other and that is why we need a  
feminist culture."

This statement along with the rational  
conclusion that there will most likely be  
some type of bloodshed is one of the long-

"The need for madness in the face of the  

patriarchy is a very valid one.  

I mean  

something very concrete. ...If what in the  
patriarchy is sane I am wooing madness. ...  

she noticed women openly breaking down and  

May we go mad together, my sisters  

May our labor agony in bringing forth this revolution  
Be the death of all pain  

May we comprehend we cannot be stopped
