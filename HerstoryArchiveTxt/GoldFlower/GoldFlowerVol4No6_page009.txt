POETRY

the feeling is this:

the veins of a city, rain filled,  
channeled through gutters,  

sliding over the surface of things.  
The huge black tree is beyond  

tiny drips slipping in a street light,  
too old to be porous  

The feeling is this:  

It is blood not reaching the heart.  

It is the pulse not pushing the blood,  
but slapping against its thin encasement  
like flippers on a beach.  

It is oxygen lost to habitual breathing  
without inhale  

without return.  

I blow myself up with each sigh.  

Thinner and tighter my skin grows,  
closer my veins to air.  

They are black puzzle cracks  

inseparable from the night.  

I am becoming less porous.  

Rain slides over me like oil on rubber.  
Veins gasp for the rain and blood mixture,  
a poultice that applies itself  

instantly upon rupture,  

complete in itself—  

an automatic healing.  

It is the rain channeled into thirsty  
mazes beneath a city.  

There is one spot between four touching  
buildings where no roof,  

no gutter,  

no escape,  

allows the space to fill like a pool.  

On the surface of the reservoir  
I float, ruptured, frayed,  

my torn edges skim back the  
flotsam.  

I purl the depths with  

blood rhythms.

craving in my sleep  

Last night in sleep  
I heard myself  
sing the darkness.  

The song went on  
till dawn when I  
startled awake, shocked  

by peals of nerve  
spreading a cathedral  
announcement over my  

private city.  
Behind each note echoes  
desperation. Like  

a soprano who winces as she  

sings, remembering the  
laughter  

of a loved one—  
of the loved  
one.  

The scraping laughter  
metal on glass  
and glass shattering  

metal wondering  
what was so  
funny.  

The tail end of  
bitterness shakes  
death rattle  

in my guts.  
Defeat belches up  
a bovine lowing.
