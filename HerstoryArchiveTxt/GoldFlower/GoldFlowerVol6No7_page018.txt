Workshops  

Women as a Private Person: Workshop 1— Suddenly Single (a workshop focusing on  
the needs and roles that are suddenly thrust upon the widow or newly-divorced  
woman). Workshop 2—Sexuality in Communication (this workshop will explore  
women’s sexuality in mid-life).  

Woman as a Public Person: Workshop 3— Entering the Job Market at Mid-Life (a  
workshop to consider the options which are available and the skills necessary to enter  
the job market). Workshop 4—Coping with Change (The middle years are,  
surprisingly, years of great change —both sudden and gradual. We'll be talking  
together about those changes, and how to deal with the effect they have on us).  

Woman as a Physical Person: Workshop 5— The Middle Years in a Youth-Oriented  
Society (all around us we're told it's important to be young and vigorous. How does  
the person who is growing older fit into a youth-oriented society)? Workshop  
6—Myths & Problems (what is the truth about menopause? what about a  
hysterectomy? a mastectomy? we'll talk together about these and more).
