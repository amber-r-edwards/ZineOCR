PENTAGRAPHS. *

The sea-green color that corresponds to the twelfth zodiacal sign could readily signify the envy which Piscean women inspire in their sisters.

But women born under the sign of the fish are more cursed than blessed by this astrological influence, for Pisces women satisfy our cultural requirements of "femininity" from the moment they open their liquid eyes.

Born under a sign not given to self-assertion, the Pisces woman is neither inwardly goaded nor outwardly guided to self-knowledge.

Pisces of both sexes are often languid, purposeless beings, better dreamers than achievers, better poets than physicists. Alas for the Pisces man, for our society demands that men deny those tender qualities that characterize this sign; many a Pisces man has escaped into drink, drugs or self-deprecation from this social pressure. Alas too for the Pisces woman, for her insidious conditioning merely reinforces the worst traits of her sign: indecision, escapism, delusion, romanticism, qualities encouraged if not treasured by our society in its women.

With this negative reinforcement it is difficult for the Pisces woman to discover her potential and fulfill it. The sign's admirable qualities--imagination, empathy, self-transcendence--are so easily confused with its deleterious traits that the Pisces woman, driven neither by inward nor outward demands, may never distinguish the positive manifestations from the negative.

If Pisceans often evoke envy from other women, they must conversely beware of their conviction of feminine joy molded themselves.

Piscean women often fail to understand the difficulty other women may face in assuming the "feminine" role.

For a tyrant; her gentle nature can be easily debased in service to another's ego, a debasement she will oft promote.

Pisces is too often a victim looking to claim as "woman's place."

In this light it is instructive to consider Anais Nin's diaries. The Pisces writer was long in recognizing her own complex motivations; she enjoyed masculine acclaim for her "femininity," even considering herself the mythic woman men told her she was. The slow painful emergence of self in Nin's diaries should prove an inspiring lesson for the Pisces woman.

Other women born under this twelfth zodiacal sign include Angelina Grimke, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Emma Willard, Mary Lyon, Rosa Luxemburg, and Elizabeth Barrett Browning.
