No More “Buck’s”  
and “Squaws”  

KATHY SMITH, A CHICKASAW  
INDIAN, PARTICIPATED IN THE  
OCCUPATION OF WOUNDED KNEE,  
A TOWN ON THE PINE RIDGE RES-  
ERVATION IN SOUTH DAKOTA,  
FROM ITS START TO FINISH.  
LAST MONTH, GOLD FLOWER CAR-  
RIED HER MEMOIR OF THE ROLE  
INDIAN AND NON-INDIAN WOMEN  
PLAYED IN THAT ACTION. THIS  
MONTH, WE PUBLISH THE SECOND  
PART OF SMITH'S ARTICLE: AN  
ANALYSIS OF THE TRADITIONAL  
AND CURRENT ROLES OF INDIAN  
WOMEN.  

Enslavement  

I write this out of love--  
for my Indian brothers and  
sisters, to help you under-  
stand our history and not be  
ashamed that our women, as  
well as our men, are strong  
people.  

Our Indian men are enslaved  
by powerful white men, whose  
power filters down through  
the bureaucracy and reaches  
them in the form of the BIA,  
schools, churches, employ-  

ment agencies and other insti-  

tutions. They in turn try to  
enslave us, the nearest tar-  
get for their rage.  

Our men believe they are  
"demasculinized" by the white  
men, who took away all means  
of earning a living (hunt-  
ing, fishing and so forth)  
and tried to make them over  
in their image, i.e.:  

THE MAN must go out into  
the world to earn a living;  
he divorces himself from his  
emotions, home and children;  
he must work 8-5 every day  
instead of working several  
days then resting and cele-  
brating for several days.  

THE WOMAN bears her children  
in a hospital with arms and  
legs tied down, with no

friends or relatives to help  
her; she raises and teaches  
her children; she sews, cooks  
and cleans.  

THE YOUNG PEOPLE must stay  
clean, quiet, obedient; they  
must learn in school from 9-  
3, instead of from life all  
the time.  

THE OLD PEOPLE must live  
separately, waiting to die,  
instead of teaching young  
ones and practicing medicine.  

Indian children in white  
schools have been punished  
for speaking their own lan-  
guage or practicing their  
own religion or culture. Kept  
from learning their true his-  
tory, they were told only  
that they were savage, drunk,  
lazy, heathen at best.  

Turnabout  

were taught that the  
Indian community--Hol-  
lywood version--meant a  
strong "buck," lord and mas-  
ter over his "squaw," a  
brainless drudge who does all  
the work, waits on him,  
praises him and lives for him.  

This western interpretation  
is decidedly not true!  

For example, take the case  
of Sacajawea--the only per-  
son with the knowledge and  
courage to guide the explor-  
ers Lewis and Clark. There is  
a reason for her self-reli-  
ance and independence--a long-  
time tradition.  

Indian women were accustom-  
ed to responsibility. They  
built the tribe's homes, each  
especially designed for its lo-  
cale, climate and uses--  
pueblos which rival today's  
skyscrapers, teepees which  
are insulated for summer and  
winter, hogans, long houses.  

They also made the policy

of the tribe,  

in the Grand  
Council of Women; they de-  
cided when they should plant,  
according to the moon and  
natural signs. They deter-  
mined when to hunt or move  

to a new location.  

The Medicine Women doctored  
with herbs, teas and other  
medicines--many of which,  
such as quinine and witch  
hazel, were copied and claim-  
ed as original by modern med-  
icine. Family planning was  
practiced, mostly by absten-  
tion from sex, but in some  
cases a strong tea was drunk  
to abort an unwanted fetus.  
The technique of the IUD was  
practiced by placing small  
stones in the womb, which  
prevented the fetus from at-  
taching and growing.  

In the old times, women  
were physically, mentally  
and spiritually attuned.  

They knew that the impor-  
tant matters of the tribe  
rested on their shoulders,  
and that their bodies were  
capable of the most difficult  
work. They were dignified and  
dressed plainly; each woman  
was her own person, knowing  
herself, her capabilities,  
her humor and her judgment.  

The men, on the other hand,  
loved children; they were  
sensitive to nature, art and  
others' feelings.  

Survival  

Indian women were on an  
equal plane; the women still  
have a reputation for being  
able to take care of them-  
selves. Just trying to sur-  
vive as a woman is difficult  
--but it has been, and is,  
especially difficult for  
the Indian woman.
