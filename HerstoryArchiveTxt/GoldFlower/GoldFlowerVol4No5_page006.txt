RAPE - Two Experiences

I better shut up, and do what he said. I did everything he asked. He would ask me at different times, if I wanted the other men. The answer was the same: no, only you, you're the best lover. At times the other men would come to the bedroom window, they would pound and make cat calls. I don't feel I ever realized what was going on inside. The fear of those men outside made what was going on inside less frightening. I remember fantasizing, I was in a park with beautiful trees, all the beautiful colors: greens, yellows, reds, pinks and a blue sky. At times when he became violent, I felt I would be dead in an hour or so. I must do anything to survive. Why does he want to hurt me, what have I done to deserve this? kept going through my mind. After the rape and sodomy were over I got dressed. I had agreed to move in with him, so he could pimp for me.

He walked me back, he didn't want anyone bothering me, now that I was his woman. I'm not sure if he did believe me about coming back. I had been wearing a bra-dress, he told me I could never wear it again, it was obscene. His women had to wear bras. A police car was driving up, he told me he and the cop were good friends and the cop was in on it. The cop stopped, the two of them talked. I didn't say anything just in case he was telling the truth. I wasn't stabbed or beaten badly, I should have fought—fear—is not enough. Was I really raped? I didn't want to have intercourse with him, yet I did have it. In legal or moral terms was it rape? The cop drove off, I got in my car and went home.

When I got home, I told my mother. She didn't believe me nor would she talk about it. I wanted to be held so greatly, to be told everything would be okay. When I think of the rape, I block out my feelings; it is only a great void. I still would like to be held, maybe to get all the hurt and pain out.

I believe men are the ones responsible for stopping rape. I know they won't, and the responsibility is thrown on women. I believe all men are capable of rape, having the hate for women.

After I was raped, I had the experience of a man close to me accused of rape. My first thoughts were confused and hostile. I had awakened to her screams, I had seen the fear and hatred in her eyes. I didn't want to believe her, yet I knew. Men's opinions echoed around the house—all women cry rape—her fault if something did happen. These men were my friends, or so I had thought. I asked one man, who I thought I knew, if he had ever raped a woman. No, was the first answer then a calm, peaceful—"I did force a woman to have sexual intercourse with me, not rape. That was long ago, and she had asked for it."

New Bill on Rape

There is a bill presently under consideration in the Minnesota legislature that would establish different degrees of sexual assault and does not allow the admission of evidence that would discredit the victim. It will be debated in the House shortly.

Write in support of this bill to your senators and representatives—immediately! Refer to House File 654 and Senate File 1041.

**RAPE**  
St. Paul, MN.

As we go to press, a woman in St. Paul awaits the dictum of Ramsey County District Court regarding the charges of aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon, burglary and aggravated rape that she has brought against Melvin Reed, 20, 280 Dayton Av., St. Paul.

Reed and an accomplice broke into her home and threatened her and her two-year-old daughter with a gun. Because she did not fight them, in reality she is on trial for "cooperating" with them. She wrote to Ramsey County Attorney William Randall that she felt "death was imminent... I want to make it clear, that I was forced under threat of losing my life to commit sexual acts with two strange men, neither of whom I had known or had anything to do with before January 22, 1975."

It is almost impossible to convict a rapist if the woman doesn't have lots of bruises to show that she struggled sufficiently. How does one struggle against a gun? Both Randall and Chief Ramsey County Prosecutor Paul Lindholm feel the law is unfair. Police tell people if they are threatened by robbers who carry a weapon they should submit without a struggle. Not so the woman who is confronted by a rapist. Lindholm told the Minneapolis Star that the judge usually instructs the jury that the victim has had to "resist to the utmost of her ability." This isn't surprising. For rape is a crime committed by men against women, and the laws are made by men. They are protective of the rapist.

The law's light-hearted attitude toward the rapist is evident in its treatment thus far of rapists caught in gang rape. Majority Report's March issue tells of two gang rapes by the same gang, in which twenty men abducted women off the street, kept them overnight, committed "rape, sodomy, unlawful imprisonment (of the victims), robbery and the possession of dangerous weapons." Six of the rapists were arrested on the scene, and subsequently turned in eight of their accomplices. The other six remain free.

Both rapes happened on a Sunday night, both involved a black woman abducted at knife point, and in both cases the women were attacked repeatedly—raped, sodomized, and forced to perform fellatio, and beaten. While both women were still in the hospital, all the men arrested were out on either $25.00 bail or from $500 to $2500 bond! A revealing comparison of the seriousness with which the law treats the crime of rape is that of the man who was recently sentenced to two years in prison for bilking the phone company (his employer) of $1.96 for a long-distance phone call he didn't report!
