Nonmethods  
of Contraception  

The following section de-  
scribes several methods that  
traditionally have been used  
to prevent conception, but  
whose failure rate is high  
enough to make them impracti-  
cal for people serious about  
practicing contraception.  
These “nonmethods” have a  
small advantage over using  
no contraception whatever,  
but they are poor substitutes  
for the more effective means  
discussed previously.  

Coitus Interruptus  

There exist three kinds of  
male-controlled contraceptive  
methods, all of which depend  
on the male's preventing the  
entrance of semen into the  
vagina during intercourse.  
In coitus interruptus, the  
male withdraws his penis  
from the vagina and vaginal  
area just before his orgasm  
and ejaculates outside of,  
and away from, the vagina.  
One disadvantage of this  
technique is its limited ef-  
fectiveness. Pregnancy may  
result, because sperm can en-  
ter the vagina in the follow-  
ing ways.  

1. Ejaculation in stages or  
withdrawal after some  
sperm has been released  
in the vagina. It is  
possible for a small a-  
mount of sperm to be re-  
leased in the lubricant  
secreted from the penis  
prior to and during in-  
tercourse. The male may  
not be aware of this.  

2. Failure of some men to  
withdraw in time, due to  
either carelessness or  
lack of ability to pre-  
dict time of orgasm.  

3. Ejaculation near the wo-  
man's external sexual

organs, permitting the  
sperm to migrate into  
the vagina after inter-  
course is completed.*  

4. In men who aren't circum-  
cised, sperm from a pre-  
vious ejaculation can  
remain alive under the  
foreskin and can enter  
the vagina later in an  
act of intercourse.  

Apart from its being an in-  
effective contraceptive meth-  
od, many physicians and psy-  
chologists question the  
psychic and physical effects  
on both partners of coitus  
interruptus. The woman may  
experience anxiety during  
intercourse, because she can-  
not be sure her partner has  
sufficient control to with-  
draw in time, or she may  
fail to attain orgasm by the  
time her partner must with-  
draw. Men also experience  
anxiety over their own con-  
trol and perhaps feel cheated  
of the full pleasure of an  
orgasm within the vagina.  

There exist two related  
techniques, neither of which  
is recommended as being eith-  
er effective or rewarding.  
Coitus reservatus is a method  
in which the male maintains  
an erection until his partner  
has an orgasm and then with-  
draws without having ejacula-  
ted. The second technique,  
coitus obstructus, calls for

firm pressure with fingers  

at the base of the penis at  
the moment of ejaculation,  
thus channeling the semen in-  
to the man's bladder rather  
than into his partner's va-  
gina.  

Rhythm  

The rhythm method of con-  
traception requires absti-  
nence from sexual inter-  
course during the woman's  
fertile period. While the  
efficiency of this method  
is lower than the others al-  
ready discussed, its use is  
better than no contraceptive  
practice at all. The major  
difficulty in using the  
rhythm method is correctly  
determining the time of the  
fertile period. It is advis-  
able to have a physician's  
assistance in this endeavor,  
but for those who want to go  
it alone, below is a brief  
outline of how to determine  
safe and unsafe times. A  
couple may use either of two  
methods, the calendar method  
or the basal body tempera-  
ture method. Both require  
record keeping for a long  
period in advance (several  
months to a year) in order  
to establish the individual  
patterns of menstruation and  
ovulation.  

Calendar Method. To prac-  
tice this method, a woman  

must maintain a record for a

*The petting behavior in  
which the male doesn't pene-  
trate his partner, but ejac-  
ulates between the outer  
lips of the vulva or between  
her thighs, can also lead to  
pregnancy from sperm's later  
swimming into the vagina.  
This can and does happen,  
even when the woman has nev-  
er experienced penile pene-  
tration.

This is the standard chart for the rhythm 23  
method, as prescribed by doctors for many 24  

years.  

To use this chart, a woman should 25  

keep a record of her menstrual cycles for a 26  

year, counting the day on which menstruation  

27  

begins as the first day of each period. 28  
Knowing the number of days in her shortest 29  
and longest cycles, she can find her first 30  

and last unsafe days from the chart.  

Thus,  

for example, a woman whose shortest period in 32  

the past year has been twenty-four days is  

safe until the sixth day of each new period; 34  
if her longest period during the past year 35  
has been twenty-eight days, she becomes safe 36  
again after the seventeenth day of each new 37  

period.
