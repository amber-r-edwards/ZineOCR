SLANTED VAGINA Continued from page 3

World War II soldiers brought back renewed stereo-
types of the "perfect wife" -- male-pleasing, docile
and tolerant of abuse. This stereotype is sometimes
used to exploit jealousy and encourage racism between
white women and Asian women. The media continues to
limit Asian women to the roles of submissive servant
or mysterious seductress -- Miyoshi Umeki playing in
Sayonara and in Eddy's Father on television; Steve
Canyon's "dragon lady."

The imprisonment of Japanese Americans during

World War II is the clearest expression of America's
feelings toward its yellow-skinned citizens. Since
slave days, no group of American citizens has been
imprisoned in the U.S. for their ethnic background
alone. This atrocity is a personal memory for Asian
Americans. It starkly contrasts with the frequently
heard innocent remark: "I didn't know Asians were
discriminated against." This points out how "innocent"
remarks are seen quite differently with Asian American
awareness.

For Japanese women, the “internment camps" were where
many were married and bore their first children. The
strength to continue to live and raise their children
while imprisoned is part of the history of minority
women in the U.S. Yet, for some, the camps introduced
new options. They were forced to work (mess hall,
hospital, file clerks) outside the immediate home
which no longer existed. They took part in outside
activities and, most important, formed sisterhood
outside their families. By no means do I lessen the
horrors of “relocation." "The internment experience
forced families to break from traditional patterns.”
(From Asian Women, "Crisis in the Japanese American
Family," Ann Umemoto.)

The Vietnam War further brutalized the portrait of
the Asian women. Recent G.I. training is not only
sexist but primarily racist. And, it is the Asian
American women who pay the highest price. G.I.s
may transfer the sexist attitudes to women back home.
But, the most terrifying possibility of transference
is to Asian American females. Asian women are both
the examples and the victims of this training --
socially in the United States and militarily in
Indochina.

We, as Asian Americans, cannot divorce ourselves
from this reality. We cannot separate ourselves
from our Asian sisters. "Racism against them is
too often racism against us." (From Asian Women,
"G.I.s and Racism", Evelyn Yoshimura.) 53]
