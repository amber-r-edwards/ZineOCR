The Ladybug’s Hymn and Vice Versa  
or  
Than Whom  

We who are concerned about  
chairone, herstory, hisicanes and  
freshpersons  

must also be on the lookout for  
yespersons, messenger-youngpeople,  
animal married-one-ry  
and junk-individuals  

as well as:  
of-thee-I sing, land-where-our-  
parents-died;  
unmarried folks of the cloth;  
peopleships;  
marksperson and  
Offspring of God.  

Is Norman Mailer  

And though we allow  
Mysteries and masturbation  
maybe we should switch to  
girlcotts and momularity contests  
and just plain eliminate  
malevolence and black widows  
chapped lips and lassitude,  
cock-and-bull stories and the  
Policemen's Balls.  

--Jeannette Wagner  

Early morning-morbid decrepit  
souls all around me  
The depression was  
nearly shock--  
The white man all  
around.  
Didn't know who to  
talk to--  
Where to go--  
Herbie Mann jams  
loud & clear--I think  
he's really here--but there  
is no one.  
Flute, Flute, sound, of  
quiet beauty.  
My legs started to water  
wondering  
Why?  
I took a pause  
to look out the door  
Just to see  
if anything was going on.  
Then you walked  
through--Handcuffs  
Binding your powerful hands--  
a look of hatred &  
pity combined...  
Something rarely seen.  
The words flowed out of your lips  
like the tide--  
Happiness came  
to me--For I have looked for  
someone who was  
for real. Now  
I have found that one--  
O.O.D.  
Early morning  
Beauty surrounds me.

Death’s Door  

Oh Mother Mary darkness is hard,  

My eyes are pinched circles  

Hiding in my skull.  

Get behind me monster, I say,  

(But it won't)  

Curled in a bundle of fright,  

Oh Mary you must save me  

From myself or before long  

My cell will have opened:  

A cage with no door,  

Simple apparatus designed for comfort  

For villains in strange shape,  

With hollow faces and icy limbs.  

I won't stir anymore then  

You'll speak to me in code.  

My heart is stone dear,  

Since I was eight, my chemistry changes  

Practicing secrecy became my game,  

Then essential to well being.  

Mother turned her back, I was too clever  

A child, and now sorrow, a slow spreading  
hate  

Eats away my bones.  

Mother Mary my prayers must be heard.  

Awful incantations hang inside my head:  

You wonderful creature, said the Third Voice  

Only an angel could be that blind.  

Tired of the kitchen, mops, and old bread  

Sickness is breeding,  

She's already half dead.  

I'll age you in silence, a dreadful  
surprise,  

You'll spring up mad  

Before their eyes.  

Her husband, the father figure for unknown  
females  

Worries over careers, occupations and thus  

Needs her for a victim in case he fails.  

O Mary Great Mother that you are  
You must see that this is all too futile  
Problems in domesticity  

While I crawl on the floor,  

Hoping for tranquility,  
Waiting at death's door.  

--Marlene Maynard  

Mother Why  

Why did you feed me lies  
And pour promises down  
My throat--  

{(Prying open my mouth  
With a meat cleaver  
When I grew unresponsive?)  
Assaulting my hope  
With giant decaying  
Sighs of doom;  

You grimly sought  

To mangle my appetites  
To suit  

Your taste.  

With great pressure  
You applied  

Spectre bandages  

To the wounds you  
Imagined I had,  

Until I had not  

Blood nor bone,  
Whereupon you slept.  

--Marlene Maynard
