NOW to Sponsor  

Judy Hickey, manager, and  
Darby Orange, publicity direc-  
tor of the Women's Auto Rac-  
ing Club, presided over a  
meeting Jan. 5 in Cedar Rapids,  
Iowa. Plans were discussed  
for the '73 racing season.  

‘A weekly race for members is  
being considered, plus Special  
Women on Wheels shows. Three  
events have already been  
booked for '73.  

This being the third year  
for some of the members, it  
was discussed having two  
classes in '73. One division  
for non-experienced members,  
basically street stock class  
with safety features only per-  
mitted. The other division  
for experienced drivers will  
feature a modified class.  
Rules for the modified class  
will be furnished at a later  
date.  

Ms. Hickey, manager of WARC,  
is undecided as to what the '73  
season will bring for her.  

She received a request from  
race promoter Lee Wall of the  

Women’s  
Sports  

Convention  

Greenboro Motor Speedway Inc.,  
North Carolina, under NASCAR  
sanction. Wall stated that he  
and other promoters think  

that the time is at hand to  
establish a regular class for  
women in that area. According  
ly Greenboro Motor Speedway  
Inc. has sought and received  
approval to establish such a  
class.  

Ms. Hickey and Ms. Orange  
will be leaving for the south-  
ern states at the end of January  
to discuss future plans for  
the nation's club. And to at-  
tend a National Convention on  
Women in Sports conducted by  
NOW (National Organization  
for Women) which will be held  
in February in Atlanta, Ga.  

Any promoters interested in  
booking a Women on Wheels  
Show in '73 should contact Ms.  
Hickey, 2204 Johnson Ave.,  
Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52405 or

Dear Sisters:  

If your state is to ratify  
the ERA, emergency action is  
needed--and fast. Over in  
St. Paul (how appropriate!)  
the Archdiocesan Council of  
Catholic Women has launched  
a statewide attack on the  
proposed amendment. Unless  
they feel feminist pressure,  
many legislators will show  
their respect for Catholi-  
cism's political clout (and  
their yen for R.C. votes) by  
voting "no" on the ERA.  
Please don't give the Cath-  
olic Church a chance to kill  
this amendment. Urge your  
readers to deluge their con-  
gressmen and legislators  
with pro-twenty-seventh a-  
mendment letters. Thank you  
very much. May "Gold Flow-  
er" blossom now and forever:  

Sincerely,  

Wiccan Rede  
lRead “Sty of Papal Mascu-  
list Sows". Like prisoners  

‘kept in the dark for pro-  

longed periods, some Catho-  
lic women retreat from the  
blinding light entering  
their cell when the door fi-  
nally is opened. Temporar-  
ily unable to bear the re-  
sponsibility of freedom,  
they cannot bear the thought  
of any other woman's liberty.
