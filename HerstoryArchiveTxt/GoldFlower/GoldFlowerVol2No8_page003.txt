weighed 110 pounds and I was

Isn't your virginity more val-

Resistance
"you made no efforts at all

to resist?"

"No. I just said I didn't
want to do it."

(No, I don't want to do it.
I'm a lesbian. I don't sleep
with just anyone. No, I
don't dig intercourse. I
don't believe in paying you
for my ride. Least of all,
a good fuck. No, I don't
wish to do it. No..." DO YOU
WANT YOUR ASS KICKED IN OR
YOUR HEAD SMASHED? DO YOU
DIG WHAT I'M SAYING?" Yes.
Yes. In fact I do. - "THEN
TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES. TAKE
THEM ALL OFF." O.K. o.k...
Okay. o)

when you were lying on the
bed?"

(Standing on my head.
Lesbians do it different.)

"Who took off your underpants,
you or him?" Did he make a
full thrust? Did he come?
What did he say while he was
doing it? What did you say?"

Secretly, and I tell you this
in utmost confidence; I want-

My Word and His

Because: 3) All we have
is your word against his.

(His and yours and the male
judge and the male prosecu-
tor and the male defendant
and the male jury and the

male lawyers and THE MALE.)

man in your position to do
exactly the same thing you
did," said the assistant to
the District Attorney. Who

Who was, again, The Man. Who

HIKING?

Because: 4) You can't
expect the state to pay
your fare here to testify
against him with such a
flimsy case as this.

To Kill

(Fantasies of murder. Never

"You shouldn't stab somebody
just 'cuz they want a little

(The knife. Opening and clo-

your head smashed in?"

of my fingers opening, clo-

gof December our scheduled

Women’s
Clearinghouse

Women's Clearinghouse began
in January 1972 with a twice-
weekly five-minute news broad-
cast on KUOM Radio (770-AM),
covering issues of concern to
women. We have come togeth-
er under the credo that con-
munications in all forms is
vital to the purposes and
goals of the women's move-
ment. In addition to our
regular broadcast, we also o-
ccasionally produce radio
specials with a particular
focus on some aspect of wom-
en's lives, either of current
pertinence or of significance
in women's history.

We are a small volunteer
group (generally 4-6 women),
and have come from an assort-
ment of backgrounds and
groups, bringing a variety of
talents. None have had for-
mal broadcasting education
but gain radio skills through
the experience of Women's
Clearinghouse. We do not
have a hierarchy of responsi-
bilities, thus each member
may expect to gain skills in
announcing, script-writing,
interviewing, operating equip-
ment, etc. Experimental Col-
lege has donated office space
to us at 1507 University Ave.
Babs

Our broadcasts are aired Tues-
day and Friday.* If you have
any information you would

like to share with area women
or if you'd like more informa-
tion about us, contact us at
373-9906.
