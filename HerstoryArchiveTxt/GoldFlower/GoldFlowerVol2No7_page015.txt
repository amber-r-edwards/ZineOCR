it  
Midwifery timed }-  

should be handling the uncomplicated birth  
in a medically sound environment and the  
specialist with training in the complica-  
tions and diseases of pregnancy should be  
reaching patients in outlying areas.  

"The most significant changes in mid-  
wifery will have to come within the estab-  
lished systems," says Rising. "Midwifery  

has existed outside the medical community.  
Doctors have seen only the negative side of  
it when something goes wrong."  

This is unfortunate since midwifery  
requires the backup of established medical  
institutions to function properly. Mid-  
wifery is for healthy normal pregnancy and  
the value of the obstetrician's skill and  
expertise in an emergency are not to be dis-  
counted.  

But obstetricians rarely take the time to  
deal with the pregnant human being and this  
is an advantage of continuous woman-to-woman  
care by a midwife. An office visit en-  
compasses the woman's feelings and fears  
as well as her physical condition. And a  
midwife helps guide the patient's labor  
rather than arriving in the nick of time  
to catch the baby.  

Utilizing midwives could lessen the  
cost of OB care. The care would be more  
extensive in terms of time spent with the  
patient, but the expensive emergency  
equipment used in every hospital delivery  
room could be limited to one emergency  
room, bringing down the overhead.  

Another factor in the cost of midwife  
care is insurance. At the present time,  
midwifery is not recognized as medical  
care by insurance companies. This is an-  
other area where consumer pressure must  
bring about change.

PROGRESS WHEN HE STICKS HIS NECK OUT.  
Across the street from Rising's office,  
Ms. Lois Sonstegard, clinical director of  
obstetrics and gynecology at the University  
of Minnesota Hospitals is also sticking her  
neck out on behalf of women.  

Rules and regulations which interfere  
with satisfying childbearing are being ov-  
ercome by Ms. Sonstegard's carefully laid  

groundwork.  

Many women wish to nurse their newborns  
immediately after delivery. Knowing  

this is psychologically and emotionally ben-  
eficial to mothers and infants and also know-  
ing that it was against hospital policy,  

Ms. Sonstegard allowed it anyway.  

After a period of time, she proposed a  
change of rules to her superiors. When met  
with negative reactions and concern for the  
risks involved, she produced evidence that  
the risks were negligible and were far out-  
weighed by the satisfaction of the patients.  
The rules were changed and parents can now  
hold and nurse their newborns before they  
are taken to the nursery for routine tests  
and observation.  

Another disadvantage of hospital delivery  
is a mother's separation from her other chi-  
ldren. Sonstegard is instituting a chil-  
dren's visiting hour to ease the separation  
for both mother and child and give the fam-  
ily a chance to adjust to a new member.  

"The goal is the most satisfying child-  
birth experience for the people concerned,"  
said Ms. Sonstegard. "There should be no  
feeling of guilt or disappointment or won-  
dering ‘how did I do'," she continued. "  
"When medical care is safe, better care for  
the whole person is important."  

And women all over the Twin Cities area  
are making that happen.
