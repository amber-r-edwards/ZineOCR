Hatshepsut

{continued from page 17}

80,000 pounds. On these she
proclaimed her kingship:
Hatshepsut, "more beautiful
than anything." Hatshepsut
did not, in my opinion,
"want to be male." She kept
her name - Chieftainess of
Noble Women - though many

Her inscriptions often mix
gender from one line to the
next. Egypt was conserva-
tive to the bone; Pharaoh
was “always" referred to in
male gender; when Hatshepsut
was Pharaoh, she referred to
herself as all Pharaohs did.

Throughout Egypt she re-
stored temples with their
schools and hospitals. Hers
was an era of peace and
prosperity. No military ex-
peditions were made; cara-
vans and ships came from

Nubia, Crete, Asia Minor.
Consider the diplomatic
skill which changed those
enemies into friends:

She masterminded a voyage
to Punt (Somaliland) the
source of myrrh. In Hat-
shepsut's time its location
had been forgotten, so the
voyage was a “search for
Eldorado." Ships were built
on the Red Sea, and were
gone for two years on a
peaceful trading expedition.

The voyage must have captured
the attention of the en-
tire nation.

I cannot but see a plan to
turn away from militarism --
building projects to main-
tain national pride; peace
and trade to ensure prosper-
ity; schools and hospitals
for future growth; the voy-
age to Punt to show the ex-
citing side of peace.
Hatshepsut's chief problem

He had matured into a war-
rior-king, and she tried to
keep him in the background.
After the voyage to Punt,
Thothmes made his move. He
opened army enlistment and
promised foreign wars and
generous booty. Men flocked
in. He formed an elite
corps under his direct com-
mand -- "the Braves of the
King." We do not know how
Hatshepsut fought him.
Many years earlier she had
named her daughter Crown
Prince and had the infant
portrayed wearing Pharaoh's
golden beard, indicating
plans for a female succes-
sor. We know Hatshepsut
relied on the people to
choose peace, for her in-
scriptions emphasize her
role as peace-keeper.
Thothmes had called on
the males, promising loot.
This coup was unanswerable.
Yet Hatshepsut held the
throne. Despite the new

Pharaohs changed their names,

was her stepson Thothmes III,

army and the dreaded Braves
of the King, she kept the
peace. One can hardly im-
agine the extent of her
political skill.

In 1468 B.C., when she
was about 32 years old, Hat-
shepsut died. We don't
know how she died, but as-
sassination is possible.
Thothmes tried to erase her
name on all monuments, thus
denying her eternal life.
Her tomb is empty and muti-
lated.

Within three months of
her death, Thothmes marched
into Palestine, beginning a
real empire. Wells says,
"For the next thirty-four
years Thothmes kept the
country in a constant state
of war. Two generations of
young male Egyptians en-
riched their families with
booty won in his battles,
and other young men died."

We know, as yet, only the
outline of Hatshepsut's
reign. Let her sum up her
hopes for Egypt (recorded
when the obelisks were
caused): "rejoicing...sail-
ing downstream in gladness
of heart, all rejoicing, in
jubilee,...in peace..."

Comments on History

disadvantage, that we are
more ‘practical' --they say,
able to do more mundane
chores (follow that line of
logic). The connection with
the animal world and respect
for animals and a general
sense of union on a scale of
equality (a horizontal
scale--Fischer talks about
cultures where the women
nursed homeless animals,
dogs, wolves, etc.), and the
necessary connection with
children leading to a con-
nection and a concern with
other people, connoted in my
mind a recognition with the
world at large and a consid-
eration for people as inter-
acting and subject to envir-
onment and change in the en-
vironment.

One of the things Helen
Victory's article also led

me to think about was that
not only were women respon-

sible for and chief figures
in ancient ('primitive,'
like American Indian) cul-

tures, but were also cen-

tral and responsible for
such ancient and chief civ-
ilizations such as Helen
Victory has written about and
discussed--other parts of
her studies on women in his-
tory in which she shows that
women had a high place and
were at one time rulers in
ancient Crete.

Crete was a highly modern
civilization thousands of
years ago and even had bath-
rooms much like ours with
copper sewage-drainage sys-
tems.

MOTHERS & AMAZONS

I found out by reading
"Mothers and Amazons" by
Helen Diner that India was
at one time a female culture,
and that there is a specific
place in the Vedas where it
states that things will now
be male dominated. Survivor
artifacts of the female cul-
ture are the reverence of
the cow and the notion that
energy-spiritual power pro-
ceeding from Brahman (the im-
personal God before male and
female) is female. That is,
the first being is a female
being in the form of an en-
ergy power force. It has
come to my mind that in the
days of female culture in
India, when the culture cen-
tered around women, was when
the science of yoga came in-
to being.

I have heard that yoga was
brought into practice thou-
sands of years ago by Indian
doctors. Going along with
the ancient practice of wo-
men doing the doctoring, be-
ing the ‘'witches' (ouija, an
Aryan word-wise, wicca,
witch) and the fact that wo-
men had a concern for the
materialist part of people
(the body), it would follow
that it was highly plausible
that women invented the sci-
ence of yoga to prevent and
cure disease and disorders.
Yoga meditation and exercise

are now being practiced by

thousands of the young in
this country to cure both
psychological disorders and
prevent disease.

facet in the film's inten-
tion. Even in the making of
the film experience of the
women is essential. The all
woman film production staff
lived together for three
weeks while they made the
film. Each week the staff
focused on one of the women
and in each presentation
there is an attempt to con-
vey what it is like to exper-
ience that person.

Millet is successful in at
least two of her three por-
traits. Mallory's and Robin's
presentations are very thor-
ough and convincing. In the
case of Lillian's, where
they had some trouble with
the footage, one does not get
the same feeling of a real
confrontation although her
style does come across.

Three Lives played at the
Walker in mid-January. A
lot of women may have missed
it because it was only shown
on two dates, with not much
publicity and it was expen-
sive ($2.59-but they did let
people in for $1.50 if you
complained). I'm hoping
the film will be available
again so that everyone who
wants to can see it.
