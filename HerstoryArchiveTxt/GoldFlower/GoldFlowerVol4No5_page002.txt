WHAT ARE YOU?

when I was young now I say

kids used to ask me I'm Japanese

what are you? and they say

I'd tell them what my mom told me don't you know this is the greatest country
I'm an American in the world

chin chin Chinaman Now I say in America

you're a Jap! I'm part of the third world people

flashing hot inside and they say

I'd go home if you don't like it here

my mom would say why don't you go back “
don't worry Joanne Miyamoto
he who walks alone

walks faster

people kept asking me

what are you?

and I would always answer
I'm an American

they'd say

no, what nationality

I'm an American!

that's where I was born
flashing hot inside

and when I'd tell them what they wanted to
know

Japanese

e++-Oh, I've been to Japan

I'd get it over with

me they could catalogue and file me
pigeonhole me

so they'd know just how

to think of me

priding themselves

they could guess the difference
between Japanese and Chinese

they had me wishing
I was American

just like them

they had me wishing I was what I'd
been seeing in movies and on TV

on billboards and in magazines
and I tried

while they were making laws in California
against us owning land

we were trying to be American

and laws against us intermarrying with
white people

we were trying to be American

when they put us in concentration camps

we were trying to be American

our people volunteered to fight against
their own country

trying to be American

when they dropped the atom bomb Hiro-
shima and Nagasaki

we were still trying

finally we made it

most of our parents

fiercely dedicated to give us

a good education

to give us everything they never had
we made it

now they use us as an example

to the blacks and browns

how we made it

how we overcame

but there was always
someone asking me
what are you?

Now I answer
I'm an Asian
and they say
why do you want to separate yourselves
