THE DESTINY OF  
WOMEN By Addie Mattson  

"I can applaud the present  
attitude of experimentation"  
in sexual roles. This was  
the closing comment of Dr.  
Eleanor Maccoby in her ad-  
dress to the 1973 Nobel Con-  
ference at Gustavus Adol-  
phus College recently. Dr.  
Maccoby is a research psy-  
chologist in the field of  
social and intellectual de-  
velopment of children at  
Stanford University.  

Dr. Maccoby dealt succes-  
sively with the entire  
sphere of criteria the sci-  
entific world has used to  
test sexual differences in  
the psychological area.  

She treated first upon the  
"feminine passive" theory.  
Many people, scientists and  
laymen alike, attach great  
significance to the female  
supine position of the sex-  
ual act--the male intrusive  
and aggressive, the woman re-  
ceptive and passive. Dr.  
Maccoby raised the point at  
this juncture as to whether  
the female's withdrawal was  
not really a form of aggres-  
sion--if indeed, the female  
did not actually originate  
the sexual approach by her  
seeming reluctance which in  
turn stimulates the male to  
pursuit.  

Dr. Maccoby cited reactions  
of young children of both  
sexes under various (to a  
child) threatening circum-  
stances. Children of both  
sexes respond in certain  
ways to the appearance of a  
stranger, removal of a toy,  
a loud noise, but these re-  
actions are not governed  
along consistent sexual  
lines. That is, the number  
of boy toddlers who hollered  
"mama" in one group was  
sometimes greater than the  
number of girls who cried,  
sometimes less.

Dr. Eleanor Maccoby  

When dealing with the ques-  
tion of an existing correla-  
tion between intellect and  
sex, Maccoby gave a simple  
yet thought-provoking illus-  
tration. She first related  
the case of a number of  
young teenage girls whose  
mothers had been given large  
doses of male hormones during the course of their  
pregnancies. The girls were  
very active and competitive  
and had "noticeably" high  
I.Q.'s. (These attributes  
are generally considered  

to be masculine characteris-  
tics, of course).  

After the hum from the audi-  
ence died down, Maccoby  
grinned and then cited an-  
other group of girls whose  
mothers had been given fe-  
male hormones in large  
amounts while pregnant, and  
whose daughters were also  
highly competitive and in-  
telligent. The inference  
drawn from this, she said,  
was not that either male or  
female hormones had caused  
these qualities, but that  
the excessive amounts of  
hormones had made the differ-  
ences.  

Her point was well made:  
that even to the trained  
scientific mind, sometimes  
sexual differences and dis-  
tinctions lie in the eyes  
of the beholder; that even  
scientists sometimes see  
what they want to see.  

As Dr. Maccoby progressed  
more deeply into her lecture,  
a certain pattern began to  
emerge: that, in the early  
years (a few months to about  
three years of age) child  
development there are pre-  
cious few and inconsistent  
areas of differentiation be-  
tween the sexes.  

Maccoby divided intellectu-  
ality into three areas --

How to meet people,  

verbal, mathematical and  
spatial visualization.  

On the first, verbal skills,  
she said that the feminine  
achievement in this area had  
been exaggerated. That al-  
though females talk earlier,  
the differences are still  
minimal in young children.  
The later "talkativeness" of  
women, she said, was due to  
conditioning which came into  
play as the parents began to  
reinforce stereotypes, i.e.,  
the strong silent male, the  
bubbly little "daddy's girl".  

Mathematical skills develop  
at an approximately even  
rate as well, again until  
role reinforcement comes  
into play.  

In spatial visualization,  
the development in the early  
years proceeds at an equal  
rate in children of both  
sexes. However,  

and this, I felt  

was Maccoby's most telling  

point, and the crux of her  
lecture, in mathematical  
skills and in spatial vis-  
ualization, by age seven or  
eight, boys are ahead of  
girls in these areas and as  
the children grow towards  
puberty, and beyond, the  
distinction grows more mark-  
ed and in time becomes a  
permanent differentiating  
factor.  

Dr. Maccoby found a vital  
link between the different  
achievement rates in math  
and spatial visualization  
skills at the early-teen  
stage. Girls, she said,  

at this age are very aware  
already of the "feminine  
mystique". They have learned  
to be "smart enough to play  
dumb". Already they have  
forfeited their psycholo-  
gical equality to social-  
sexual expediency.
