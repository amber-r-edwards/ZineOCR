Poetry by Natasha

Almana deals in aces of spades  
She has no Queens of hearts.  
Her whole deck turns up  
aces black  
And they're all in spades  
Magic  
You shout!  
Magic you retort!  
Oh no, Oh no you're wrong.  
You see she bought them  
that way  
Ha  
Ha  
Ha Ha  
Ha  
another joke, another joke  
but why isn't the world  
laughing. Perhaps they don't  
think it's very funny: Ha Ha  
She scores:  

Louie finally  
went screwy  
When he discovered  
that his pretty little Suzie  
found  
another  
friend at lovers leap end.  

And they executed a perfect  
swan song  

for the whole world  
together.  

Lois Amazon Lane reports  
that she  
must be  
Super Woman.  
Because when she jumped  
that old skyscraper  
in the sky earlier today,  

of all the crazy things to happen  

(Why let me tell you)  
before she reached  
the bottom  
she began to fly.  

Lois being no man's fool  
immediately (if not sooner) took  
appropriate action.  
She went and had S.W. tattooed  
right smack between her two breasts  
Now all she has to worry about  
is Kryptonite  
Oh ya  
Oh ya Kryptonite  
will do it to you  
every time.  

Oh ya  
Oh ya  
Kryptonite can kill. Kill  
you know  
like in  

Kill you dead.

"What a mess!  

"that tops things off!  
that tops things off."  

Sharon always throws  
that phrase in  
when there's nothing else to say  
Oh  

She comes out with some  

real homespun beauties  
like.  

What A Mess!  

I can’t find the start.  

Then Sharon will say  

Now of all the things to be  
relative.  

"We need the smell of roses  
around here. You know  
I can't think straight  
without the smell  
of roses."  

I don't know who's loonier her or me.  
It's all a matter of degree I'm told.  
Ha Ho Ha Ha Ha  

He says....Parties Are.  

How confusing:  

Right.  

words words words you  

Not to know  
when you're on or off.  
But all things considered  
he might be  
After all  
what's in a number?  
Ho? Hot of that matter  
can  
lose yourself in them.  

Just like you can drown.  

Yes it  

(not even a  

Yeah drowned in the sea.  
Sea--a 3 letter word  

it can be blue--it can be green  

or even hum de dum  
can be very evenly all slicked over  
with oil rainbows  

having no pot of gold at their ends  

puff for the soul)  

LALLA LULU LLU LLL ULL  

Misha woke up one morning  
And looked in her mirror.  
Now that  
was her first mistake  
for the day.  
Because she found she lost  
her SMILE  
in her pillow--the night  
before.  
the two lips left,  
She just wore pasted on plainly red.  
plainly red!  
After all Misha,  
who would notice?  
the difference?  
Who could see the change?  

you know  
You never were the image-keeper  
anyway  
anywho.  
Well  

that's  
One smile down and  
a thousand years to go.
