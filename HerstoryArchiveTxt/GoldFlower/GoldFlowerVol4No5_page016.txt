GOLD FLOWER readers often ask how our newspaper got its name. The paper is named after a Chinese
woman whose story is told by Jack Belden in the book "China Shakes the World." Since this woman's
tale is so relevant to the women's movement, and parallels it in its implications, GOLD FLOWER

is reprinting the story as a series for our readers. Part I appears on page 8.
