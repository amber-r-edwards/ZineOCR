exposes Kate Millett's weaknesses

Flying and she reveals her humanness, but for me it also explains why she did become so important to the movement. She is a person with emotional ability to draw forth good from others.

Millett's book may be, as Fumio says within it, “romantic,” it certainly is overly long, but I encourage you to buy it with a friend, read it and then talk about it. The book is a wonderful sharing of a woman's life and for us to extend that sharing further is a way of fulfilling Millett's "mission" as feminist and artist.

FEMINIST INSTITUTE TO OPEN IN

A group of leading women writers, teachers and activists has announced plans for a feminist institute in Burlington, Vermont. According to spokeswoman Joan Peters, the institute, which will be named Sagaris after the double-edged sword of the ancient Amazons, is meant to be a feminist-humanist alternative to existing patriarchal society schools of higher education. Dr. Peters said that the institute would offer a greater degree of academic freedom than is found currently at colleges and universities offering women’s studies. “In many schools,” she asserted, “women’s studies are controlled by men or locked into a system that does not allow adequate freedom for maximum intellectual growth.” Courses at the institute, which will begin with two five-week summer sessions next year, will include political theory, women’s history, psychology, creative writing and journalism — all taught from a feminist perspective. Tuition will be arranged according to a sliding scale based on ability to pay and will include child care.

We have been consistently attempting to reach you on behalf of our organization. We want to work with affirmative action programs and to initiate more companies to affirmative plans which would result in utilization of all people potential available. We want to change the deceit and bribery; the mental torment and the legal prostitution that goes on in the kitchens and offices of middle-upper-and-lower America. We want Pennsylvania Avenue to chime of honesty, not degradation. Our goals are rooted in the philosophy that working people everywhere are entitled to jobs and careers that, however humble, may still earn at least a living wage. We want the living standards of women to be raised to the living standards of men.
