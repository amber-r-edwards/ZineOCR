4. It regularizes menstrual  
periods, lightens the flow,  
and may eliminate cramps.  

Two types of disadvantages  
are associated with the  
pill:  

The first is a group of  
minor side effects that re-  
semble symptoms of early  
pregnancy and commonly dis-  
appear after the first few  
months of taking the pill.  
They may include nausea,  
breast tenderness, depres-  
sion, nervousness, backache,  
or increased vaginal dis-  
charge, which may be linked  
to increased rates of yeast  
infection associated with  
usage of the pill. However,  
these are not experienced by  
all women who take the pill.  

The second type of disad-  
vantage associated with the  
pill has to do with its  
safety, which recently has  
been the subject of much in-  
vestigation. The official  
government verdict as to the  
safety of using oral contra-  
ceptives is that while risks  
exist, "When these potential  
hazards and the value of the  
drugs are balanced, the com-  
mittee finds the ratio of  
benefit to risk sufficiently  
high to justify the designa-  
tion safe within the intent  
of the legislation."**  

The major hazard is an in-  
creased tendency of a few  
pill-taking women toward  
blood-clotting diseases,  
such as thrombophlebitis.  
This ailment can sometimes  
result in a pulmonary embol-  
ism, or blood clot in the  
lung, which is often disabl-  
ing and can be fatal. The  
frequency of such a fatal  
side effect is low: about  
1.5 deaths per 100,000 pill-  
taking women under 35 years  
of age, and 4 deaths per  
100,000 for women over 35.  
These rates may be compared  
with the death rate of preg-  
nant women who die from com-  
plications during their  
pregnancy: 20 to 25 per  
100,000 women. Moreover, it  
is estimated that for every  
100,000 illegal abortions,  
about 100 women die.  

There are unanswered ques-  
tions about a possible con-  
nection between taking the  
pill and acquiring cancer,  

especially of the cervix or  
the breast; about metabolic  
effects, such as diabetes  
and liver dysfunction; about  
genetic effects, such as  
polyploidy, in which the  
fetus has too many sets of  
chromosomes and always  
aborts; and about amenorrhea  
and anovulation, the failure  
to menstruate or ovulate  
after going off the pill.  
Clinicians have suggested  
that women can minimize the  
dangers associated with the  
pill by using a pill with the  
lowest possible amount of  
estrogen, by selecting com-

Pills vary widely in the amounts of estrogen and pro-  

gestins they contain.  

While there are some differences  

in the various compounds and their biologic activity,  
many authorities feel that those differences are not im-  

portant and that,  

in general, the less medication, the  
better, particularly in the amount of estrogens.  

Listed  

above are the pills now approved by the FDA, divided into  

two groups, the combinations and the sequentials.  

The  

preparations are listed in order of increasing estrogen  
component per tablet, then in order of increasing  
progestin component per tablet, and then, when estrogen  
and progestin components are the same, in order of  
increasing number of tablets per month.*

Injectable Contraceptives  

Injectable contraceptives  
(dipo-provera) are a new and  
still experimental type of  
contraceptive. They have...  

been used on a limited basis  
for several years and are  
just now becoming available  
to members of the medical  
profession, who may pre-  
scribe them for contracep-  
tive purposes. Their poten-  
tial drawbacks limit their  
distribution to women who  
are quite certain that they  
have finished their child-  
bearing or that they want no  
children. These contracep-  
tives should be available  
for general use in a few  
years.  

Injectable contraceptives  
are ovulatory depressants  
that consist of progesterone  
acetate, which is injected  
into the patient once every  
three months. Their advan-  
tages include the facts that
