Interaction, which created  
the program is a non-profit  
group concerned with "encou  
raging innovative solutions  
and is dependent on private  
donations and community  
support.

If women living in a sexist  
society face day-to-day prob  
lems that are hard to over-  
come, it is even harder for  
those who are re-entering  

it from a prison situation.  
Ms. Beale, who is a former  
head of Minn. Women's Polit-  

ical Caucus, feels that the  
rights and problems of wo-  
men inmates are generally  
overlooked by the feminist  
movement and this must  
change. I agree. It's per-  
haps one of the best examples  
of how standing up for your  
sisters is important for the  
good of society as a whole,  
as well as for the progress  
of women in society.

If you wish to help, there  
are several areas that need  
volunteers—especially people  

who can escort inmates on  
trips out of Shakopee and  
offer skills or friendship.  
Fundraisers are also wel-  

come; donations of clothing  
for the boutique can be left  
at Pi House.

“We are trying to get things  
to happen in a real way,"  
commented Ms. Beale. But  
that only happens when peo-  
ple reach out to people in  

a real way—not just through  
talk, but action.
