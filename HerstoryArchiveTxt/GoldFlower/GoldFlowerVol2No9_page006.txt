was mentioned as having more  
applications than it can handle. C.E.A. operates at a  
limited capacity because:

1) Small classes facilitate personal conduct be-  
tween students, instructors, and teaching assistants.

2) Small classes encourage active participation of  
all the people in the class. C.E.A. never turns away anyone  
seeking preparation for childbirth, unless all eleven lo-  
cations are at capacity. The screeners who register people  
by telephone try to offer several options as to what  
location, time, and series a person wants to attend. We  
now plan to offer approximately 100 series in 1974, with  
an active teaching staff of 23 instructors and 100's of  
teaching assistants, and a support system of volunteers  
from the community.

We welcome all pregnant women to give C.E.A. a call, and  
learn about what we offer in education and training for  
childbirth.

I personally am very excited about the growing field of  
Midwifery; this will offer a real choice to all women.

Thanks,

Clinic Regroups

Now that it's midwinter we  
have found that our way to  
achieve our goals needed some  
changing. Within the last  
few weeks, through hours of  
discussion, we have come to  
some new conclusions. We  
would like to establish a wo-  
men's health center for edu-  
cation, self-help, counseling  
and discovery. This is a  
change from what we have  
struggled to become for the  
last 9 months.

Our goals, as a refresher,  

are still the same. They are  
grand and glorious, and yet  
we have hope that we can  
start to tackle them. We  
wish to change the way health  
care is delivered by consumer  
control, alleviating the hier-  
archical structure of health  
care workers, undermining the  
drug companies' power, giving  
women knowledge and control  
of their bodies! (How about  
that!)

In the past we felt that if  
we opened a clinic we could  
be an example of how these  

changes could affect delivery  
of health care. But after  
many long hours of discussion  
we felt that to do x-amount  
of Pap and x-amount of VD  
cultures we would end up  
draining all our energies  
just on service. There are  

a lot of facilities that peo-  
ple can use, granted none are  
giving "good" service. But  
by using our energies to put  
the education of women and  
health care workers on top of  
our list we feel we might  
accomplish more (to change  
existing service for all wo-  
men).

So the Center now has a pro-  
gram which started with our  
education. We have broken  
ourselves up into five major  
work groups. Each group  
takes its own responsibility  
for one facet of the center.  
They are as listed:

Funding--a never-ending pro-  
blem. The group is busy  
learning new language and  
writing an “in-house" purpo-  
sal. We also have a video  
tape to use at the funding  
boards. Any ideas for places  
to approach?

Classes--We would like to  
offer classes, probably 5  
sessions at the Health Center  
on women's health.

We start our first health  
class February 6 at 7:30.  
There will be a fee, as yet  
unknown. This is an intro-  
duction and a general class  
on health and women. From  
this class we hope people  
will go into collective study  
groups on individual smaller  
topics. We feel this class  
will give a broad base for  
women to continue to learn  
from. The class topics are  
as follows:

1) feminism and politics

2) anatomy and self-help

3) hormone system and men-  
opause

4) birth control and abor-  
tion

5) VD and vaginal infec-  
tions

6) sexuality

7) birth and children

8) health care issues

9) preventive medicine and  
Eastern medicine

We want to limit the class  
to 15 women and hope that  
people will attend all nine.  
If the registration is high  
we will start a second class  
on Tuesday at 7:30. All classes  
at 2000 South 5th St, the  
People’s Center.

Introduction and Speaking  
Gigs. We hope to do a lot of  
speaking gigs and do some  

teaching on self-help. Any  
group can call and ask for  
this.

Each Wednesday night there  
is an open-ended introduction  
session about the Center, fem-  
inism, and an opportunity to  
learn self-help. The direc-  
tion of these discussions  
will be determined by the  
needs and feelings of the in-  
dividual women present.  
Please come and see what we  
have to offer.

Counseling--There will be  
counselors trained for coun-  
seling or for referral. Op-  
portunities for referral are:

1) health classes

2) an open-ended support  
group

3) women's rap groups

4) counselors with a fem-  
inist perspective will  
be available for long-  
term counseling.

Evaluation--As a feminist  
group we feel the need to  
also evaluate what we do, and  
how we accomplish our objec-  
tives. The group is develop-  
ing a framework within which  
we can evaluate ourselves.

We believe it is necessary  
to have a structure which  
still allows us to be human  
and free. We hope this is  
informative and lets you know  
where we are at. If you want  
any further information please  
contact us. Someone  
is at the Center all day M-F.  
335-7669.  
In sisterhood,  
EBWHC  
PS. Please stop and see us.  
We are anxious to involve  
more women in our center.

I once accused my father of
