UNIVERSITY  
HEALTH  
SERVICE  

Decent health care is our  
right. It is the right of  
every human being, and in-  
come, age, odor, and personal  
appearance and degree of sex-  
ual activity could not be  
more immaterial. It is our  
right as surely as it is our  
right to live and die in de-  
cent circumstances. It be-  
comes increasingly apparent  
that the ideal doesn't pre-  
vail, in Mill City or else-  
where.  

Women are badly screwed in  
the delivery of health care.  
Any woman who has gone to a  
contraceptive clinic knows  
what it's like to feel like  
meat on a rack. Contracep-  
tives that are obviously  
still experimental are dis-  
pensed to women free with  
VD tests and insults, seem-  
ingly a very low wage for  
being a guinea pig and plac-  
ing one's life on the line  
in the name of population  
control. Contraceptives  
that are at once safe, re-  
versible, and effective sim-  
ply do not exist. To add  
insult to injury, abortion  
is unavailable in Minnesota  
not only in the case of con-  
traceptive failure, but also  
in cases of rape, fetal de-  
formity and even death, and  
psychological distress to  
the woman. Women on welfare  
are coerced into steriliza-  
tion and abortion, under  
threat of having the source  
of support to living child-  
ren removed.  

The inequitable situation  
is maintained, in part, by  
the exclusive, inbred, mu-  
tual admiration society that  
is the medical profession.  
The U of M med school has a  
10% enrollment of women,  
which is considered by its  
administrators to be quite  
liberal (10% out of 53% of  
the population?). Those  
women who manage to wallow  
through this built-in sexism  
are often co-opted by anoth-  
er snare: the medical  
mystique.  

The most important thing  
physicians are taught in  
their eight years schooling

is the brass to play god.  
This brass is a double  
bladed ax that permits them  
to simultaneously do great  
services and sometimes, make  
great blunders. Finally,  
one of the greatest oppo-  
nents of socialized medicine  
is the medical profession at  
large, and the AMA specifi-  
cally. Most physicians are  
also opposed to the expan-  
sion of medical schools,  
which might begin to remedy  
the criminal shortage of MDs  
in the U.S. There are 133  
physicians per 100,000 pa-  
tients.  

One place where women have  
succeeded in making concrete  
progress in the arena of wo-  
men's health care is the U  
of M health service. In  
1971, the University of Minn-  
esota Women's Liberation  
group set about to make the  
health service earn its keep  
by presenting and publiciz-  
ing these five demands:  

1) Pap smears at no extra  
charge; 2) post-miscarriage  
and post-abortive care; 3)  
pregnancy tests at no extra  
charge; 4) a publicized abor-  
tion referral service; 5) no  
moral harassment.  

Every student at the Uni-  
versity pays twenty-one dol-  
lars a quarter for the use  
of the health service, and  
although women were no ex-  
ception, they were seemingly  
not getting their money's  
worth since the essential  
services listed above were  
not available.  

The health service did not  
jump at the chance to meet  
the needs of women. When  
asked if the needs of women  
would be met by the health  
service, Director Donald Co-  
wen replied, "but there is a  
clinic across the street."  
In an overwhelming rush of  
moral beneficence, Pap  
smears, a test for uterine  
cancer, were granted in Jan-  
uary. Perhaps they were  
swayed by the argument that  
sperm counts could be obtain-  
ed free, hardly a matter of  
life and death except per-  
haps for a few males' egos.

MEETS  
WOMEN'S  
DEMANDS  

In the spring there was a  
student election, in which  
80% of those voting stated  
they supported all the fem-  
inists' demands as stated on  
the ballot. Since the  
health service is supported  
entirely by student fees,  
the health service position  
appeared less and less valid.  

In the fall of 1972, the  
directorship changed hands,  
and the demands were met.  
Nurse clinicians were  
appointed to chaperone the  
gynecologists, who certainly  
can use some help. Women  
who seek abortions are given  
written referrals, instead  
of the verbal ones they re-  
ceived on an erratic basis  
last year, and are told to  
return for a checkup. Last  
year the stated health ser-  
vice policy was to have  
nothing to do with pregnancy.  

Ms. Jane McNamara has been  
appointed as Patient Ombuds-  
man. McNamara claims she  
follows up every complaint  
put in the health service  
suggestion box. She is  
available through Periodic  
Health at 373-4017. Com-  
plaints may also be present-  
ed to U of M Women's Libera-  
tion at 373-0033. It is on-  
ly logical that the health  
service still needs to be  
supervised by its patients,  
even after all that work.  

The story has a fitting  
close. Bureaucracies have  
very short memories. Paul  
Ruprecht, present director  
of the health service, stat-  
ed in the Minnesota Daily,  
"Whatever is available today  
(for women at the health  
service) was available last  
year." It is to laugh...  
here's what's available,  
through the efforts of some  
angry, persistent women, and  
the University community  
that backed them: Pap  
smears at no extra charge,  
post-miscarriage and post  
abortive care, pregnancy  
tests at no extra charge,  
publicized abortion referral,  
a patient advocate, and  
chaperones for the gynecolo-  
gists. Power to the Sisters!
