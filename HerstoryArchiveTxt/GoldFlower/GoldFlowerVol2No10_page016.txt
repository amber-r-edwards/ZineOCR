We are writing in regard to  
International Women's Day.  

We are all staff members of  
WBFO, a public radio station  
licensed by the State Univer-  
sity of New York at Buffalo  
and a member of the National  
Public Radio network. Women  
make up approximately 40% of  
our staff and hold positions  
in all areas of responsibili-  
ty--program director, produ-  
cer, engineer, program guide  
coordinator, announcer, li-  
brarian, etc. We also pro-  
duce two programs on a weekly  
basis of specific interest to  
women--"Woman Power" and  
“Sappho." All this just to  
give you an idea of who we  
are. Now to the point.  

On March 8, we plan to de-  
vote the entire 20 hours of  
our broadcast day to celebra-  
te International Women's Day.  
Women will be covering all on  
-the-air duties as well as  
technical and engineering.  
We have included a tentative  
schedule for March 8. As  
March 8 is still five weeks  
away, the schedule will un-  
doubtedly go through some  
changes. We hope to include  
drop-in modulars throughout  
the day - five (or so) minute  
tapes by/for/about women's  
activities both in and out of  
Buffalo. If you can prepare  
a short tape on your activi-  
ties or on any group in your  
area, we would love to have  
it for airplay. Needless to  
say, we need them as soon as  
possible. Also, we are pro-  
gramming a one-hour women's  
bibliography and if you can  
send us information about  
your activities as a group -  
bios, history, activities,  
and issues of any publicatio-  
ns, we certainly will use  
them.  

We are really excited about  
how plans for the day are pro-  
gressing. We did the same  
thing last year but hope this  
year's day shows the improve-  
ment we've all made. We want  
the day to be a chorus of wo-  
men's voices from all over  
the country--hope we hear  
from you soon.
