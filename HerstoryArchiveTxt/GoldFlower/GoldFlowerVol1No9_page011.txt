Revolution, Not Reform

Steinem Raises Funds,  
Hopes for DFL Women  

by Jan Jirak  

Gloria Steinem, one of  
America's most talented jour-  
nalists and an editor of Ms.  
magazine, arrived in Minnea-  
polis on Saturday, October 28  
to help the DFL female candi-  
dates with their campaigns.  

The day's activities began  
with a $10 brunch at 1730  
Franklin Avenue in Minneapo-  
lis. Ms. Steinem mingled al-  
most unrecognized through the  
gathering of almost 200 women  
and a few men in the opulent  
surroundings. The absence of  
mobbing and male reporter-  
pushiness seemed almost to  
amuse her.  

After the guests brunched  
on cheese, fruit, and sweet-  
breads, Koryn Horbal, state  
DFL committeewoman, intro-  
duced the male politicians  
and the female candidates.  
Gloria then began her address  
in her characteristically en-  
gaging manner with praise of  
the Minnesota women's move-  
ment. The women sat on the  
floor while Ms. Steinem spoke  
of politics in the traditional  
sense of the word, and al-  
so as any power struggle be-  
tween distinct groups of peo-  
ple. She addressed the prob-  
lem in a historical, anthro-  
pological sense, recalling  
the years of gynocracy fol-  
lowed by paternalism, and  

called for a new era of equal-  

ity. Economic considerations  
followed as an intensely  
feminist issue involving all  
women (We are all “one man  
away from welfare.”).  
Steinem also stressed that  
"The parallel between women  
and all racial groups is one  
of the basic facts of Ameri-  
can life," and that the ra-  
cial minorities and women  

must join in their common  
cause. She called for a true  
revolution in the American  
way of thinking that discrim-  
inates against people who  
look different; not just re-  
form.  

In short, Steinem touched  
on every feminist issue ex-  
cept abortion and gayness.  

From Franklin Avenue the  
women shifted to the Labor  
Temple on Fourth Street for  
a $2 rally. The male, Estab-  
lishment press was there, and  
the crowd was bigger. The  
atmosphere lacked some of  
the feeling of trust that  
emanated at the brunch.  
There, under the glare of  
lights, Steinem hurriedly  
summarized her morning's re-  
marks. She also added some  
remarks on abortion and sev-  
eral about Nixon.  

The audience was with her  
all the way, but with less  
personal warmth than I felt  
at the morning's gathering.  
The Establishment press gave  
her almost no coverage. The  
next day's paper carried two  
lines about the event. The  
TV stations devoted about 60  
seconds. It seems only the  
feminist and educational  
presses dare acknowledge the  
importance of what Steinem  

represents.  

Perhaps her message of  
"Revolution, not reform" is  
best told by an incident  
that occurred as she left  
the Labor Temple. A nervous  
young man approached and  

asked her for her autograph.  

Gloria smiled and replied,  
"No, I don't think so--  
that's the old-fashioned way  
of doing things."
