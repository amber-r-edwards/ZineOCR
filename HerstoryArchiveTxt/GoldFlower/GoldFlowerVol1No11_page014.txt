FEET

by Jan Jirak

A woman's rising conscious-
ness in the liberation move-
ment can be compared to the
instance of someone standing
on your foot. At first you
say, "Excuse me, but you're
standing on my foot." In
rare instances, the offender
will say, "Oh, I'm sorry--"
and get off. More often,
through blindness, he will
say, "No, I'm not--you must
be imagining things." Recog-
nizing his myopia, and trying
to be sympathetic, you say,
"Pardon me, sir, but you are
standing on my foot, and it
does hurt." This exchange
will probably repeat itself
several times with increas-
ing emotion on both sides
until finally the offender
backs off.

Too often the stander's
nose is too high in the air
to let him notice the stand-
ee. This calls for action.
Sometimes you must push him
off. He gets hostile and
complains about how "women's
libbers" make everything in-
to a power struggle. Usual-
ly the support of other wo-
men is needed to get him
off.

Since women have been step-
ped on for so long, many
of them, not knowing any
other state of affairs, ac-
tually think they like it.
They even "invite" such ac-
tions by exposing their feet
and embellishing them until
they look good enough to
walk on. Of course, most
men take the mere presence
of female feet as an invita-
tion.

Women, too, are accomp-
lices in the assault. They
encourage it by treating
themselves and other women
as though they were capable
only of being stepped on.
"Anatomy is destiny"--you
were made with feet, so they
were made to be stepped on.
(Men have feet, too--I won-
der why their anatomy gives
them a different destiny.)

As a result of a long his-
tory of being stepped on,
many women are "flat-footed"
--and as much as they'd like
to walk on their own two
feet, they limp. Even if
their powers haven't been
damaged, everyone thinks
they have; so they have to
walk twice as fast as a man
to keep up with him. Em-
ployers don't trust her to
keep walking; they think
she'll just get married and
go back to being stepped on
again.

And so, until we all get
back on our feet again, I
recommend supportive shoes
to help us walk (women's
organizations) and a little
foot powder (women's publi-
cations) to make the walk
easier.

: Praxis Sc
: Quarter; =

Beginning January 17, the
"Socialist Feminism"
The Praxis School will enter
its second quarter. The

class has three parts; "His-
Story", which was covered in
the fall; "Theory" which will
be covered this quarter; and
"Strategy", which will be
tackled in the spring. Each

quarter, and indeed each
class meeting, however, is
open to all.

We felt that when we were
on more solid ground-in the
history and theory of femin-
ism, we could build a success-
ful strategy to liberate

just society.

Fusion in the Maze
The attempt to fuse femin-
ism and socialism is not as
yet finished, and in most
ways has, as yet, been far
from successful. But the
need remains: our daily ex-
perience can rarely tell us
whether we should be a lib-
eral feminist, or a social-
ist feminist. 

Of the varying views of real-
ity each kind of feminism
assumes, and looking at our
own experience in light of
such a view, can help us
find our way through
the maze. It is for this

reason that the theory course
offered this quarter seems

so crucial. Many of us have
read various feminist works
(Beauvoir, Firestone, Greer,
etc.) as they stimulated us
to change our lives, to be-
come feminists at all. 
Most of us also have predict-
ions to various positions on
the political spectrum, us-
ually from extreme left to
liberal. But few of us have
read these same feminist
works critically and compar-
atively, with an eye to
their broader political per-
spective. It is this task
we plan to begin this quart-
er. As a special treat, we
will also be reading the new-
est theoretical works put
forward by various women's
groups: The Chicago Women's
Union political statement;
The NAM (New American Move-
ment) sexual politics paper;
papers read at the Socialist
Feminist Conference held
over Thanksgiving in Durham,
N.C.

The Praxis School is spon-
sored by the Mpls. chapter
of the New American Movement,
a new national organization
struggling for democratic
socialism in the U.S. Other
NAM projects include The
North Country Peace Campaign,
a political education and
action project, and The Met-
ropolitan Taskforce, a group
researching and struggling
to change the local balance
of power. The "Socialist
Feminist" class meets Wed-
nesdays from 7:30 to 9:30,
for six weeks. Tuition is
by donation.
