“Women Either Cope or Build”

I have always thought: soli-
tude essential in order to get
in touch with oneself and be-
come a strong, autonomous per-
son. Solitude can be peace-
ful, an inward-tuning time of
self-exploration.

For most people in the west-
ern world, however, solitude
is feared and avoided. They
do not know how to make con-
structive use of solitude,
and this is especially true

of women.
A woman is taught from the

earliest moments of infancy
that she will never be alone.
Indeed, she is taught that a-
loneness is a lack rather than
an opportunity. She expects
to marry, have children, grand
children. She is trained to
find escape from loneliness
not in herself, from whom she
could learn the most, or from
other women, with whom she has
the most in common, but from
men, who have shared and under-
stand few of her vital exper-
iences and feelings, and from
children, who are unequipped
for adult relationships.

In her book The Woman Alone

(The New York Times Book Co.
278 pp., $7.95) Patricia

O'Brien tells that she lived
just such a life for most of
her years. She spent her
childhood and young adulthood
dreaming of marriage, which
materialized after her sopho-
more year in college; she
dropped out and bore four
children.

In spite of her fulfilled
dreams, she was unhappy. She
began to learn some lessons
about loneliness. "I could
not understand what was hap-
pening. I had everything I
was ever supposed to have
wanted, yet I would find my-
self crying while I folded di-
apers. Was it loneliness I
felt? But how could I be
lonely? People were around
constantly. My life had shape
and direction and substance—
what was wrong with me? In
fact I had been alone only one
time in my life, a night short-
ly after my fourth daughter
was born. I remember twice
turning off the lights and try-
ing to go to sleep, each time
getting up and turning them on
again, irritated with my cow-

living room to wait out the

wings

She decided to finish col-
lege with a major in journal-
ism. "We bought an old Ply-
mouth for $100 and I drove to
school each morning, singing
with the radio, thinking new
ideas and feeling new emo-
tions. I loved that car. It
gave me wings."

After graduation, she took a
reporting job. While her love
for her work increased, her
marriage ran into trouble.
After a year of futile coun-
seling, she decided to leave.
She took a job on the Chicago
Sun-Times, 80 miles away, and
came home on weekends. Thus
began two years of being alone
the first real solitude she
had ever known. During that
time she met and conquered
loneliness, came to know and
love herself through her sol-
itude and by seeking out
other women alone.

O'Brien recounts the devel-
opment of her sense of
strength and identification
with other women. She re-
cords scores of stories of
women in diverse situations,
all part of the collective
female experience.

Ms. O'Brien tells these sto-
ries with sympathy and percep-
tion.

age

She explores the subject of
age by her story of a 100-
year-old woman's birthday par-
ty. She hated the fussing o-
ver a person usually ignored.
