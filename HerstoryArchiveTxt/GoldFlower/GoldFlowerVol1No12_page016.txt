WEAL FILES SUIT

30 Metro School Districts Charged  
With Failure to Hire Women Teachers  

Ellen Dresselhuis, Presi-  
dent of the Minnesota Divi-  
sion of Women's Equity Ac-  
tion League (WEAL) announced  
this week that WEAL in con-  
junction with Susan B. An-  
thony's birthday, Feb. 15,  
has filed suit with the E-  
qual Employment Opportunity  
Commission (EEOC) against 30  
out of 32 school districts  
in the metropolitan Minnea-  
polis/St. Paul area charging  
sex discrimination in the  
employment of senior high  
school social studies teach-  
ers. Duplicate complaints  
have been filed with the  
U.S. Department of Health,  
Education, and Welfare (HEW).  

On the basis of research  
done by WEAL, it found that  
1/3 of the school districts  
in the metropolitan area  
have no females in their  
senior high school social  
studies departments, 1/3  
have fewer than 10%, and the  
remaining 1/3 have 10-38%.  
Only two school districts  
(West St. Paul and South St.  
Paul) have female representa-

tion in senior high social  
studies proportionate to  
their availability for hir-  
ing.  

The percentage of women  
hired as senior high social  
studies teachers does not re-  
flect the availability of  
women for these positions.  
In 1972, at the University  
of Minnesota, 39% of the ap-  
plicants available for place-  
ment and registered with the  
Placement Service were fe-  
male; at Mankato 23% were  
female, and at St. Cloud,  
22% were female.  

Copies of the complaint  
have been sent to Howard  
Casmey, Minnesota Commis-  
sioner of Education, with a let-  
ter stating that the Minne-  
sota State Board of Educa-  
tion's pamphlet "Eliminating  
Sex Bias in Education: A  
Statement of Policy and Pro-  
posed Action" has not been  
acted upon and that a defin-  
ite affirmative action pro-  
gram should be pursued to  
ensure equal opportunity for  
women and men, and girls and  

forget it," she says,  
rat-infested,

The WEAL suit is endorsed  
by the Human Rights Commit-  
tee of the Minnesota Educa-  
tion Association (MEA), the  
Women's Rights Committee of  
the Minnesota Federation of  
Teachers (MFT), and the Em-

ucation.

behavior patterns of dom-  
inance and aggression will  
be evolutionarily at a dis-  
count; and if that happens  
he will begin to shed them  
as once, long ago, he shed  
his coat of fur.  

“He may feel a little odd  
for the first few millennia  
because he is less accustom-  
ed to living without them  
than we are; but he has  
passed through more violent  
vicissitudes than this and  
survived...All we need to do  
is hold out loving arms to  
him and say:

been corrected by a recent operation.  

"Ask any middle-class person in Minnesota,"  
she says dejectedly, “and they'll tell you  
all about AFDC mothers. We're lazy, welfare  
loafers. There are some like that--there are  
some of every race, creed and color like  
that. But why should you condemn all women  
on AFDC because of a handful?"  

She, too, has encountered problems in find-  
ing housing. "If you tell them you're on  
welfare, nine times out of ten you can just

"Welfare ‘discourages women from going  
out to work. You can't make enough on  
your own to raise your family," she  
says. "If you work, you probably can't  
earn more than you'd get on AFDC."

up," Sally says.  

“You don't see people at work, you  
don't have money to go out. If your  
friends aren't on AFDC, their husbands  
might not want them to associate with  
you. You can just about forget about

money spent on welfare. Well, I wonder  
about all the money spent on that war."
