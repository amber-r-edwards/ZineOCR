100 Boots Out of a Job  
Terminal Island, Calif.  

Feb. 15, 1972  

A California woman artist, Eleanor  
Antin, has earned herself an exhibi-  
tion at the Museum of Modern Art  
(MOMA), New York, through an ingen-  
ious ongoing mailwork.  

100 Boots, a series of 50 postcards  
showing black rubber boots in drama-  
tic situations, is on view at MOMA  
through July 8—when the boots them-  
selves conclude their peripatetic ad-  
ventures with a stay in New York. In  
addition to the entire set of post-  
cards, the exhibition includes photo-  
graphic blow-ups of the boots' New  
York “crash pad."  

Executed over the past 2 1/2 years,  
Antin's 100 Boots was conceived as a  
means of circumventing the limitations  
of the gallery system. The postcards  
have been mailed at irregular inter-  
vals—ranging from 3 days to 5 weeks  
—to some thousand persons and insti-  
tutions around the world.  

As Antin describes it, she origin-  
ally thought of the work as a picar-  
esque novel, but later began to view  
the photographs as highlighted frames  
from a movie serial. Each postcard in-  
cludes a photograph of the boots,  
a title and data on the place and time  
of the photographs. All photographs  
were taken by Philip Steinmetz.  

The postcards were not necessarily  
mailed in sequence of occurrence.  
Instead, Antin reordered the events  
into a continuous narrative, which be-  
gins with the boots in conventional  
society, leads through their first  
crime ("100 Boots Trespass") and  
thence to a series of adventures, odd  
jobs and even an unhappy love affair.  

While most of the boots’ adventures  
have taken place in California (where  
Antin lives), their exploits will con-  
clude in New York when the MOMA ex-  
hibition closes. Jane Necol of the  
MOMA staff directed the exhibition,  
which is the first time the boots'  
wanderings will be fully displayed.
