UNION WOMEN at riOen

The Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW) was formed in Chicago in March 1974. CLUW's purpose is to pursue political and legislative action in the workplace and stronger representation of women in union leadership. A CLUW organizational meeting will be held June 6 at 7:30 p.m. at the United Electrical Hall, 3039 Central Ave. N.E. in Minneapolis. This will be an opportunity for Twin Cities women to learn about the Chicago convention and to discuss issues concerning union women. All bona fide union women are urged to attend. 

The next "Gold Flower" meeting will be at 2 p.m., Sunday, June 10 at 1011 - 27th Ave. SE Minneapolis, Minn. (call: 378-1848, after 6:30 p.m.). Any interested person and all staff members should attend.
