‘NO ADMITTANCE’: A Black woman in Latta, S.C.,  
gave birth to a baby girl in an ambulance after the coun-  
ty hospital refused to admit her, according to a Feb. 20  
Associated Press dispatch.  

The ambulance driver delivered the baby with instruc-  
tions from a midwife when the hospital refused to accept  
the woman, because no physician would take the case.  
She owed $350 for a previous delivery. The driver had  
taken the woman to 20 doctors in an unsuccessful attempt  
to get one of them to deliver the baby.  

There has been no comment from the so-called right-  
to-life forces, now celebrating the manslaughter conviction  
of Dr. Kenneth Edelin for performing a legal abortion.

Woman charged in killing  

is denied jury challenge  

Associated Press  

Washington, N.C.  
Superior Court Judge  
Henry McKinnon refused  
Wednesday to quash the  
first-degree murder indict-  
ment against Joan Little,  
saying he was not con-  
vinced of significant racial  
disparity in Beaufort  
County's jury selection  
process.  

Defense attorneys for the  
20-year-old black woman,  
accused of killing a white  
jailer she claimed was  
trying to rape her, had  
sought to show that the  
grand jury tended to ex-  
clude blacks, women and  
the poor.  

Following the ruling, Miss  
Little’s attorneys began  
arguments on another  
motion calling for dismiss-  
al of the indictment. The  

second motion alleges im-  
proper conduct by the  
state in presenting the  
case to the grand jury.  
Members of the grand jury  
are expected to be called  
as witnesses during argu-  
ments on the second mot-  
ion.  

Miss Little, who was not  
present for yesterday's  
session, was the only  
woman in the county jail  
when Clarence Alligood,  
62, was killed Aug. 27.  
She was confined while  
awaiting appeal on a  
breaking and entering  
charge.  

Judge McKinnon said his  
study of the evidence did  
not lead him to believe  
that discrimination exist-  
ed in the jury selection on  
the basis of sex, race, age  
or economic status.
