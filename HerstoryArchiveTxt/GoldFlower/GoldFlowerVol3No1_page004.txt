I am going to work for the  
future which is sure to come,  
a future in which people will  
be seen as human beings, not  
as sexual stereotypes, when  
all human beings will know  
about the struggle of women  
to participate as full human  
beings, to contribute our  

gifts to the world. Until  

then I will try to make my  

art according to my precepts.  
I am committed to making art  
out of my experiences as a  

woman--making it available to  
as many women as I can, by  

finding ways to exhibit it so  
that many people can see it,  
by selling my work at low  

prices, by trying to build a  
female art community which  
has high standards and a  
broad base.  

ST. KATES OFFERS SUMMER  
WOMEN'S COURSES  

Women of all ages, occupa-  
tions and educational back-  
grounds are most welcome.  
The tuition charge is diff-  
erent from the auditing fee.  
To take these courses for  
credit, students pay the reg-  
ular summer school tuition  
fee of $90 per two-credit u-  
nit. Students auditing pay  
$60 per two-credit unit. New  
students who wish to take  
courses for credit are re-  
quired to pay a non-refund-  
able application fee of $10.  

This summer the College of  
St. Catherine is offering two  
sessions of three-week  
courses designed specifical-  
ly to help women discover  
their intellectual, social  
and creative potential by ex-  
ploring new areas of thought  
and action.  

The two sessions, during  
which courses will be off-  
ered in this program, run  
from June 19 to July 9 and  
from July 10 to July 31. Al-  
though the number of meetings  
each week varies with the  
course, all of the courses  
meet in the morning hours,  
either from 9 to 10:30 or  
from 10:45 to 12:15.  

If notice of cancellation is  
received by the end of the  
fifth day of class, June 26  
(or July 17), 75% of full  
tuition is granted. After  
the fifth day of class,  
there is no refund of tui-  
tion.

there is no obligation to  
take the courses for credit.

skills and could support her-  
self from free-lance jobs  
would have a flexible, autono-  
mous occupation. In this way,  
both workers and customers  
could avoid dealing with an  
agent of the male establish-  
ment: a small step but an im-  
portant concept in creating  

a viable female culture.  

Finding good jobs for wo-  
men, raising employers' con-  
sciousnesses, helping women  
find training, raising the  
average pay scale for women,  
and bypassing male society  
are not the only things these  
women do.  

Every Thursday night they  
conduct workshops for clients  
and employers on topics such  
as "Employment in a Sexist  
Society," "Open Relation-  
ships," and "Relaxation  
through hypnosis and mind con-  
trol." They have offered a  
weekend retreat at a northern  
resort, focusing on employ-  
ment but also on "sisterhood,  
personal growth, development  
and relationships." They  
sponsor a course in astrology  
and a growing speakers bureau.  

All three women are rais-  
ing and supporting families.  
The cupboard runs a bit bare  
now in the beginning stages  
while they reinvest most of  
their profits in the business.  
But they worry more about  
fighting sexism than about  
where their next meal comes  
from. They take part-time  

jobs to keep themselves going,  
crack jokes about making one  
hotdog feed a family of four,  
and speak with confidence of  
the monumental changes they  
will make in society.  

hands keep wanting to open,  
drift like feathers on your back,  
hold your gaze between my palms,  
brood on your nape,  

pull your hips against me.

I don't know how to think it is

wide and shut
