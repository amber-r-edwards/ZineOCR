XQ" Wee a Her Shooting:  
3 Elizabeth Martinez, paralyzed  
from the neck down after a  
sniper attack, appeared in  
court in the trial of Donald  
Carroll to confirm that it was  
his car she saw leaving the  
scene (she didn't see the  
driver). Confined to a  
wheelchair, attended by  
her parents, she spoke  
between bursts of air provided  
by the machine that does  
her breathing for her.  
The prosecution believes  
her shooting was a case  
of mistaken identity.  
Trial continues.
