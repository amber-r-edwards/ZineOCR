THE RAG  

JAM RAG is a weekly devoted to the  
Detroit Rock scene, highly  
recommended as a PR drop if you're  
planning to play there. Editor Tom  
Wess describes JAM RAG's function as  
providing a “bulletin board” for local  
musicians, which is essentially what  
this small photocopy ‘zine is, full of  
quick local bulletins and distributed  
free at record stores. We don't know  
if there's a charge for a sample  
issue--we'd try mailing them a SASE  
and seeing if they mail a copy back  
(it's basically a folded photocopy).  
They encourage contributions and  
note. “Violence, substance abuse, and  
sex will only be presented in context  
to their relationship with Rock and  
Roll.”

THE RAG  

The CHICAGO READER (September 5)  

ran a cover story by Robert McClory  
called “Mutilation: The New Wave in  
Female Self-Abuse.”  

According to the piece, those who  
self-mutilate often call themselves  
“cutters,” after the preferred method of  
injury (although they may also bang  
their arms against the walls, burn  
themselves with cigarettes, etc.) “The  
practitioners...are overwhelmingly  
female and usually white, single, and in  
their late teens or early 20s. Many  
suffer from eating disorders like bulimia  
or anorexia nervosa...” McClory  
reports, adding that they are not  
suicidal. One of the things that makes it  
difficult to treat is that group therapy  
only seems to encourage people to spin  
out self-abuse fantasies in front of an  
audience, reinforcing the problem. One  
patient who slit her wrists said that she  
loved the attention this brought her from  
the staff.  

Rude Girl rides again: Lois LaRue  

(former main axe-welder/songsmith of Rude Girl-- see  
issue *12) is forming an ultimate, heavy heavy ass  
Metal Rock band, and needs a variety of female  
musicians--and singers, of course, you know this means  
you too! To get together for auditioning and jamming,  
call her at 415/661-7625. “You can do it!” Lois  
says, “The time is now!" Fans of her work with  
Addie/Heroines, relax; “It's like an athlete playing more  
than one sport,” she says. “That project will continue,  
but it's a separate one from this one. There’s room for  
arts in one’s life.“  

Puss'n Boots needs drummer:  

L.A. femetal band PussnBoots (with Karina Doll and two  
ex-Orchids, Jan King and Che Zuro) seeks a female  
drummer. Write to them c/o P.O. Box 480797, Los  
Angeles, CA 90048. And expect an album on Axe Killer  
records from the band in the near future.  

Jaded Lady needs guitarist:  
Terry O'Leary and Cathy Amanti are still in the femetal  
band Jaded Lady, but Lori Von Linstruth has replaced  
Danielle Kern, and Mary Jo La Roche has replaced Kerri  
James. They want a female rhythm guitarist to  

complete the line-up. Send demo tape, photo, and short  
personal bio c/o 8033 Sunset Blvd, Suite 25, W  
Hollywood, CA 90064.  

Folk Music Rubberstamps: yes, you heard  
right. Stamps like the one pictured, etc. This has got to  
make a good surprise gift for somebody. Send $2 for  
catalogue to The Rubbersmith, P.O. Box 202,  
Nottingham, NH 03290.  

Sale on Kate Wolf: Kicking Mule Records is  
having a special sale on records by folksinger Kate Wolf,  
any three for $20 (except Give Yourself To Love). Write  
to Kicking Mule Records, Inc., P.O. Box 158, Alderpoint,  
CA 95411.  

Rockin’ In Bethlehem: Bethlehem has  
become “the entertainment capital of the West Bank,”  
according to a recent story in the JERUSALEM POST,  
with Discos that play a sort of Arabic Disco music called  
Franco-Arab music. Elias Abu Aliz, owner of the Golden  
Roof, which attracts both Christians and Muslims, said,  
“People here don't like to concern themselves with  
radicalism. They come from all over to be entertained in  
Bethlehem. Here there are no tensions, no thieves, no  
destruction of property.” Owner Halil Reshmore of  
Sheherazade (where the Jerusalem-based band the  
Silver Stones often play) wants to attract more Jews to  
the clubs. The women dress fashionably, and the fashion  
includes keeping shoulders and cleavage covered. All the  
clubs frown on belly-dancing by either sex.
