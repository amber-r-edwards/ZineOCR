The Orchids evolved out of two Lauries that appeared on Kim Fowley’s
compilation album, Vampires From Outer Space (ex-Runaway Laurie
McAllister and blonde Laurie Bell). The Orchids recorded one album for
MCA, produced by Kim Fowley with the following line-up:

Laurie McAllister: bass, lead vocal on “Bad Guys”

Laurie Bell: drums, lead vocal on “When Does Love Turn Out Right?”

Jan King: lead vocals (formerly of The Wad* and of Spitfire)

Che’ Zuro: lead guitar (formerly of Backstage Pass** and of Blind Rage)

Sunbie Sinn: guitar (her real last name is Harrell)

Sindy Collins was the original 18-year-old lead vocalist for the Orchids.
She sang on the EP, then was replaced by Jan King for the MCA album.
Sindy was fired by Kim Fowley for missing rehearsals.

It may help to list who sang lead vocals on what song, since there were
four lead vocalists in the Orchids, and the album covers never said who
sang what. Sindy Collins sang “Teenage Babylon,” “If Boys Got Pregnant,”
and “Get Out Of My Life.” Che’ Zuro sang “Just A Photograph,” "Bad Guys”
and “Turn Off The Lights.” Che’, Laurie Bell, and Jan all sang “I'm No Fool!”
Laurie Bell sang “Girls” and “When Does Love Turn Out Right?” Jan King
sang “The Boy Can't Dance,” “Daughters Of Babylon,” “Blame it All On The
Night,” “Sunshine Fire,” and “Radio Dream.”

Laurie McAllister quit, and later sang and played bass for the Rough
Boys. The rest of the girls continued to tour clubs like The Whiskey, then
dropped out of sight. That is, until recently—Laurie Bell, Che’ Zuro, and
Sunbie Harrell portrayed 3 members of a 13-piece all-female band called
NADA in the Rock 'n' Roll movie Get Crazy; Che’ Zuro was in Valley Girl; and
Laurie Bell was a drummer in the 1985 horror movie, Night Train To
Terror.
