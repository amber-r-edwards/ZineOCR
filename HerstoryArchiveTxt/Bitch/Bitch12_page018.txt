Addie: Thank you  
Lois: That's where managers and agents come in--the artists are too wigged-out.  
Addie: I just have to get into that space and get into the studio. I'd like to find a really good  
producer to work with me. Not tell me what to do, how to do it, but work with me, not  
somebody that I would tell them what to do and how to do it, either. I went into the studio for a  
year and a half, and I played all the instruments, I sang and wrote everything, engineered it.  
I think that's a mistake...it never gets released, if you do that...I think you have to know when  
to let go. You have a kid, you raise a kid, but you only get him for the first five years, and  
then you have to send him off to kindergarten. And at kindergarten, the teacher says, “Fuck  
you, mom, we know what's right, and we're gonna handle it now, we're gonna teach him to  
read and write.” And mom has to let go, eventually. With a musician, you do your best, you  
make your baby, you write your song, and you make it as happening as you possibly can,  
and somebody, somewhere, has to say, “OKAY, That's ENOUGH. Get it released. Get it  
going”...  
Addie: ...the thing is, a lot of people take control, and I'm, “No, that's not how I want my guitar  
to sound.” They produce me, like, real clean? That's not how I want my voice to sound. They  
hear me in a different way. You need someone who hears you like you hear you...  
Lois: ...like Rude Girl, we were working with the producer from Black Sabbath...I felt really  
good with him, I was really trusting him, “Okay, you made Black Sabbath.”...I think you can  
really fuck up, getting the wrong person to take over...  
Addie: (On Sandy Sledge having sat in on a gig:) Sandy is a great buddy of ours and we love  
playing with her. And we'll probably do more together. We played with Joanne and Sandy--you  
know, Malibu Barbi--too.  
Lois: We played together for the army boys at Ford Ord. They got off. In fact I'm still getting  
letters from that gig!  
Addie: We dig Malibu Barbi and have a lot of respect for them. Those two girls are good  
friends of ours.  
Lois: Amen! Let's hear it for EVERYBODY!

print it in the next issue. You can send additional pages and more dollars, but if  
you get carried away, heck, why not call it a submission and let him foot the  
bill? One dollar from Luke McGuff, P.O. Box 3690,  

review angle. “The Jokes in Ne  
This is brutal. GREAT guitar-playing (think Eric Clapton and Michael Bloomfield; so good it  
feels lame praising it, because she’s way beyond needing praise) but the production has every  
problem that Eric Clapton's late ‘70's recordings had, the guitar-playing vacuum-packed by the  
production. Frustrating. Studio niceties often bland out the fire; what I'd like to hear with this  
is spare Stax-style production. The people who currently produce Eric Clapton or the Fabulous  
Thunderbirds could probably get the right sound for her, but the easiest thing would be to do  
live recordings at clubs and just pick the livest. It's a way to save the mistakes that studios  
make, and flash retrievals from error are often what makes rock guitar exciting (Eddie Van  
Halen said of Pete Townshend's playing on “There are some brilliant mistakes on there!”),  
and this has been too polished. There's also something askew in the rhythm and tempo, but I  
lack the tech talk to be explicit. The best I can do is say that it doesn’t have enough swing for  
the hips, and that I don't mean the rhythm section—but the overall arrangement (it should be  
faster or slower, either would work). Negativity aside, if you get this single, you'll be making  
a solid investment. It's going to be a collector's record. It's $3 from the address below. Also  
available is an $8.95 tape I haven't  

himself produced, of her doing his songs.
