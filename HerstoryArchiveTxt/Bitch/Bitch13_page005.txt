Dear BITCH:

Hi! What's rockin’?

As you can see, I've enclosed 4 bux for BITCHes #7 and #11. The last time I ordered a BITCH from ya you asked about my band Minx!

Well we don't have any promos yet but we are checkin’ out different photographers.

We have a demo but it’s got our old lead guitarist on it so it’s kinda dated.

We will be recording a new one in mid-November tho!

As soon as we have our promo/demo finished I will send you a copy of each and maybe some band info as well.

Well, thanx for reading this, gotta go now!

Dawn Lethbridge, Ontario, Canada.

EDITOR: Looking forward to it!

Hey BITCH! An open letter to “Runaway Jett”: “Bark at my weenie--you low down bitch!” A cat in hell, somewhere in a desert, Phoenix, AZ.

Hello!

My friend read the last BITCH with my letter to you. Guess what? She thought it was STUPID!!! So what I finally noticed is that I didn’t say all those girls are great Rock stars, I mean Ivy and Pat are great! Really, really, REALLY!!! I just think you should come on as who you ARE. I guess I should have said so the first time. Oh, well!

So will you get off my case, Pam? Already? Bye! Tracy from Boston. P.S. Rock is supposed to be about honesty—or isn't it?

EDITOR: We'll ask Elvis next time we see him.

Dear BITCH,

I wanted to thank you for your newsletter in the most supportive way that I knew, so I wrote up the subscription plea on the (enclosed) page. As a computer scientist working at M.I.T., I have access to an international computer network which has electronic “discussion groups” on various topics, one of which is about music. I sent the BITCH write-up to this group. It should be read by thousands of people throughout the U.S.--I hope that lots of them send you cash! Keep up the great work.

Sincerely, Eric Albert, Medford, MA.

EDITOR: Well, aren't you a complete doll, Eric! Thank you so very much--we only wish we had room for the ego-stroke of printing your review (it was great, folks--a rave!) By the way--you confirm our suspicion that our readers are an interesting, unusual and diverse lot.

Would it be rude to address this: “Dear BITCH"?

I am sitting in my room with a pile of mail and listening to Rodney's Sunday night show and he has just dispensed with a brief blurb on this fanzine. Since I am now interested and I am not even close to POO-BAH records in Pasadena, I am

writing to ask for a recent issue. I am also sending along $2 which I hope is adequate monetary compensation. Hope to hear from you soon--

EDITOR: A big “Arf” to you, Pam, for being thoughtful enough to cough up bux in front (and exactly our sample issue price, too). And a great big SLOBBERY BITCH “Arf” for menti --thanks awfully!

Dear BITCH:

I just picked up a copy of your newsletter at Tower Records on Broadway. Being a female musician, I found your publication very enlightening. I just moved to N.Y. and had no idea that there was such a music scene for women. I play the drums and some keys. I have a sq. bass TAMA Imperial Star kit with Zildjian cymbals. I try to be humble, but to promote myself, I must express confidence in myself as a player. I am “Runaway” influenced from my early teens, but listened to classic Rock n Roll bands also--Led Zeppelin (Bonzo is the king of drums), Bad Company, Aerosmith, etc. Being the new kid in town, I need some assistance in finding some Rockers to jam with. I was hoping you could fill me in on some N.Y. based all-girl bands to go see and refer me to any guitarists looking for a female drummer. I'm 22, feminine (but a tomboy at heart), 130 lbs (and always dieting), 5'5" with long brown hair (with the exception of one strip of bleach blonde in front). Please help me to hook up with some local (or distant) lady Rockers. I am subscribing to BITCH and will continue to support you in any way I can. Thanx!

EDITOR: As you'll see on the next page, we're trying to get together a regular “Musicians Wanted” column--that's a beginning. Next issue, we'll have an article on networking groups for female musicians (there are a few.) Gosh, New York...have you seen the Poison Dollys?
