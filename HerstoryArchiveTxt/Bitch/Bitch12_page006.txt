Sandy Sledge of Malibu Barbi—and formerly of Rude Girl—wrote the following letter to Kely  
Hellrazor of METALFORCE: we reprint it with her permission =  

Yo Kely (is that short for KELVIN???),  

In regards to Issue 15, your article on one of the female bands, (who from their picture look like  
they'd feel more at home on a burlesque stage than a Rock stage) seems to suggest that all female  
bands belong in the same general category “...unlike the RUDE GIRLS and TOUGH LOVES of this world.”  
Hey, Kelv, you seem like a cool enough guy, at least liberal-minded enough to care about Metal, why  
can't you give the sex issue a break? As drummer and co-founder of bands RUDE GIRL and MALIBU  
BARBI, I can't IMPRESS upon you how disgusting it is to be separated from my cohorts in Metal  
because of a few biological differences. The way I and some of my female Metal friends here in the  
States are feeling, you'd think we were playing Polka music! We're treated as outsiders in the  
‘Women's Music community’, as a freak show novelty act in the underground Metal scene, and some  
sort of casting couch crew by the music execs. The proof of this can be seen in the way these second  
and third generation ‘all-girl’ bands dress. Boys wear what's comfortable to rock in, these girls are  
merely “slipping into something more comfortable.” UGH. I have seen and heard Tough Love and the  
most Rude Girl ever had IN COMMON with them is the city I was born in.  

While I appreciate you remembering us, I wish you'd categorize us with bands we may have jammed  
like. That way Metal fans can get a better idea of the music and practice what they preach as far as  
the conservative scene goes.  

GET WHAT I MEAN??2777  

As far as the contributing factors to the death of Rude Girl, it was first degree murder of the most  
carefully calculated kind. Seems we're dealing with a highly competitive business here, and the above  
mentioned problem left us virtually on an island,  

THE PRESENT IS AT HAND!!!  

The searing sneering burning driving laughing progressive Metal of MALIBU BARBI is here!!!  

Thanks for listening.  

Yo there BITCH type people.  
God, I absolutely love your magazine, and when I finally scrape enough dough together, I'll subscribe  

(I know, you'll howl all night long ‘til I do). Leathur Panteez, Malibu Barbi—you guys are great!  

How-Z-About a story? Whilst reading the latest ish (courtesy of my buddy Sam) I was  
encountered by a  
strange being called “Durannie” (?). Anyway she comes up to me and says “What are your  
secrets?”  

I promptly replied “BITCH”. Well she threw herself into a hissy and said to her friend, “All I did was ask  
her what she was reading and she called me a bitch!” Can you believe that? No I didn't think so. (It's true  
though). Oh by the way, who's Kate Bush?  
You're still the one! Keep Rockin’, K.C. in Pennsylvania.  

P.S.: A sincere “Yo" to Twersky, Danise, and Sumac.  
EDITOR'S NOTE: A sincere "Yo" back from us (huh?)—say, did you straighten the Duran Duran fan out?  
WHO IS KATE BUSH!?! Well, CONGRATULATIONS, K.C., you asked the secret question! In  
response to your query (and Luke's complaint last issue that we had no Kate Bush piece in the issue  
before that) we have gotten permission from HOMEGROUND (a British KB zine) to reprint part of their
