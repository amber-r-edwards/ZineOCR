"April is the cruellest month..."
at least for local television stations.
in the year 1973. Citizens United
for Responsive Broadcasting
(CURB) and the three New Orleans
stations are engaged in a series of
marathon consciousness raising
sessions preparatory for license

- renewal application to the FCC.
Community input is mandatory to
the process. The result is reluc—
tant media personnel are gazing
across the table and rapping with
feminists, blacks, Spanish-speaking
residents and other sundry groups.

Florynce Kennedy, black
feminist, lawyer and outspoken
political organizer from New
York, sat among a throng of
local feminists on the base-
ment floor at 4535 Saratoga
March 2. The pot luck supper
whose substantial proceeds
went to Sisters Helping Sisters
Abortion Counseling Collective,
drew the largest contingent
from the women's movement
since the women's conference
last September.

nothing moving yet...you gotta

"I've seen you on TV," japes a
news director to a feminist. "I've
seen a lot more of you than you
have of me," she quips in return.

Quips aside, the negotiating
process is both significant and
arduous. CURB is struggling with
the gargantuan tasks of monitoring
all three stations, researching sim-
ilar efforts around the country, and
achieving consensus among its
varied elements as to goals and

From the moment she adjusted
her turban and began to
throw out sentences like
daggers into the crowded aud-
ience there was applause and
admiration. Here was a woman
who had dedicated her life
to fighting sexist and racist
oppression--"the racist is
also invariably the sexist"--
a woman who would stand up to
anybody and make her presence
felt, an uncompromising,
beautiful sister.

Para-Medical
Schools:

WOMEN BEWARE!

BY MARY GEHMAN

The ads in the daily paper
sound good to young women try-
ing to prepare themselves for
a decent job; "nurse's aide,
physician's lab assistant, med-
ical receptionist, 4 hour
course, easy no-interest bud-
get plan, high school not need-
ed, short easy courses with
individualized instruction,
job placement assistance."

What the ads do not say is
that graduates (95% women, the
majority of whom are black) of
such private para-medical
training schools in New Orleans
are having a hard time getting
a job. According to a rash of
complaints filed with the Bet-
ter Business Bureau, 301 Camp
Street, local hospitals and
laboratories prefer women who
have not had previous training
so that they can educate them
in their own classes and pro-
grams. The few physicians who
recognize certificates from
private para-medical schools
pay their lab assistants lower
wages than do hospitals and
they demand services beyond
what the student has learned
in such “short, easy courses."

pulled a plastic speculum from
her purse and waving it in the
air explained its use in per-
mitting women to give them-
selves vaginal examinations.
"We've got to let the gynecologists
know that we understand
our own bodies and not let them
think they're the only ones
who do."

Advocating that midwives
and paramedicals be trained to
give abortions, she commented:
"Abortions are so simple that
they (doctors) don't want to
be bothered with it--but it's
so damn complicated that only
they can do it, you see,"
