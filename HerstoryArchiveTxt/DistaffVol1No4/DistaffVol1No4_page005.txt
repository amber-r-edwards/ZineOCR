Beating the High Cost

of Health Care

by Loraine Despres

After an outrageous bill from
my doctor, I decided to look
into alternative medical faci-
lities.

If your income is less than
$3000 for a family of three
you are probably eligible for
Charity Hospital and its exten-
sive if crowded facilities. If
your income is more, there is
still free and inexpensive med-
ical care available, though it
is scarce and not always satis-
factory.

The HEAD CLINIC at 1130 North
Rampart will give free medical
aid to anyone on a first come, 
first serve basis. It's open from
6 to 9 p.m., Mondays through
Thursdays. Services include pap
smears, pregnancy tests and
birth control pills, but no
other contraceptives unless they
can find a gynecologist. They
also give first aid, immuniza-
tion shots, blood tests, throat
cultures. Wednesdays are pedia-
trics nights, bring your kids.

The FAMILY HEALTH Foundation
with four clinics provides free
family planning services for
all women of child bearing ages.
There are no financial eligibil-
ity restrictions for gynecolo-
gical services which include
initial blood test, pap smear,
examination by a physician and
all methods of birth control.
For pre-natal care you must be
eligible for Charity.

However, we have reports from
Sisters Helping Sisters that
Family Health's pregnancy tests
are not always reliable and
because there are long waits for
appointments these tests can-
not be given when the woman
wants them (immediately!)

We suggest using them for birth
control and the Head Clinic for
pregnancy tests.

For an appointment at the
clinic nearest you, call
581-6613. Be prepared to wait

a couple of weeks for the
appointment and figure two to

four hours for your first

visit.

FREE PAP SMEARS will be

given on Thursdays this
month from 8 to 3 at Charity
Hospital to all women who want
them, by the Cancer Association
of Greater New Orleans. They
are also giving pap smears in
Jefferson and St. Tammany
Parishes, Slidell and Covington.
For more information call the
Association at 522-4456.

FREE CHEST X-RAYS AND BLOOD

TESTS. Free chest X-rays are
available from the Tuberculosis
Control Unit at 517 N. Rampart.
However, the results will not
be sent to you, but to your
doctor or clinic. Free blood
tests are available through
Disease Control Clinic at 122
Lasalle St. It has facilities for
free treatment there. Both units
are administered by the City Health
Department. I understand that
there is very little waiting

at either of these sites.

FREE IMMUNIZATION is available
to all children and their
parents at the ten health cen-
ters operated by the New Orleans
Department of Health. These
centers were originally set up
to give check-ups and innoc-
ulations to babies born at

Charity Hospital, but every-
one may receive innoculations
from 8:00 to 9:30 AM. If you
have taken your children to a
private doctor and would like
to use these services, you
must secure a release and rec-
ords to be kept at the Health
Center. See New Orleans Health
Department in the phone book
for the clinic nearest you.

Go early. There are long waits
for innoculations just before
school starts.

HOSPITAL CLINICS based on
ability to pay are available,
too. But call first, some of
them have geographic eligi-
bility. Others have economic
standards so low, you would
almost have to be Charity
eligible to participate. The
hospitals which do offer clinics
are: Hotel Dieu Ambulatory
Care Clinic, 431 S. Johnson
588-3588; Touro Infirmary,

1401 Foucher, 897-3311; Flint-
Goodridge Hospital of Dillard
University, 2425 Louisiana
Avenue, 899-4521; The Eye, Ear,
Nose & Throat Hospital, 145

I remember when I was just your age

I was
free to run
along
the railroad track
where wild
berries ran,
the ditch that also ran
along
the railroad track

Now you can hardly go to school alone.
Someone might run you home
Or run you down
Or run you wild.

Oh daughter-

When I was ten,

Like you

Old men talked to little girls
Like old men should talk to little girls
The man who talked to you

on the telephone

didn't know I'd answered
in the other room

I said to you

"Hang up the phone."

And cursed him out.
