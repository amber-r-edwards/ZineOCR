The drawings on this page and on  
page 12 were done by Sylvia de  
Swann who is currently preparing  
for a show with three other women  
at the Borenstein Gallery, 511  
Royal Street.  

Born in Rumania in 1941, Sylvia  
de Swann immigrated to the United  
States when she was ten. She  
attended the High School of Music  
and Art in New York City, Hunter  
College and studied at the Art  
Students League.  

In 1961 she went to Mexico City  
where she married an architect  
and had a child. During the next  
ten years she had a very active  
artistic life with numerous shows  
in Mexico and Amsterdam. El Corno  
Emplumado published a book of hers  
entitled DRAWINGS OF LIFE AND  
DEATH and she has hand produced  
BOOK WITHOUT WORDS and  
INSIDE - I. She taught design at  
the University of Mexico, produced

happenings at the International Press  
Club, designed sets for a film, and  
created a very successful series of  
light boxes which she exhibited in a  
one-person show at the prestigious  
Pecanín Gallery in Mexico City.  

Since her arrival in New Orleans  
in December 1971 she has had a one  
person show of drawings and col-  
lages at Gallery 8.  

It's hard for her to speak of her  
art, but she does say she is not trying  
to reproduce reality, but to create an  

inner expression. "Everybody won't  
see what I'm doing. But those who do  

"will discover it rather than have it  
thrown at them."  

Nothing she does is ever facile,  
she always avoids easy tricks,  
because as she says those tricks don't  
really say anything. For me Sylvia  
de Swann's drawings are exquisite  

and moving and speak in a voice much  
deeper than words.
