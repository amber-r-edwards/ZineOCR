WHERE THE MELON MELLOWS, THERE THE FLY

Gladys Payne Kopp

Where the melon mellows, there, the fly  
Rides a faint hum where the seeds  
Keep time, tell the bee, the birds  

The odors, there, we have no breath,  
Say flowers are blooming say trees  
Are born unloved, uncared, sigh  

Nothing sounds, no sounds, say  
Whatever comes and speak of what goes  
And what goes is ember and dry  

Make what goes, go. We are lies  
With sound, don't call, please  
Meek, lay earth, lay now in day  

Does harm feel the sun, the May  
Earth slips, hear the longing deaths  
Cry, who yellows, who dye without breath.  
TIME  
Gladys Payne Kopp  
Time floats  
in words.  

Glazing its surface drawing by Gigi Gillespie  
dream bubbles  

expand, lift, explode  

before their birth to the wind.  
The foam,  

inaudible in vast turbulence, Calm me  
disassembles to Coax me  
the consistence and noise Crush and cleanse me  
of aged cries. Sea --  
Time rushes Give me human things of nature  
at the mouth, I will not accept from humans.  
rad yer ares & del ba Perhaps we could all be close by the  
dropping infinity. in an empty gulf. sae  
Would your powerful presence allow  
us  
To deny our needs from each other?  

Teach me  
Tickle me
