This is an article about child—
birth. (Oh God, another one of
those!" "I can't do it THAT way.
My husband, doctor, Aunt Sarah
says I'm not strong enough." "Why
should I do all the work? What do
I pay that doctor all that money
for?" "That's primitive, dis-
gusting, masochistic. I don't
want to know from anything until
the hairdresser arrives." "But,
I'm so afraid of pain.")

OK, these are usually the kind of

negative comments made in reference
to learning about an occurrence which
has happened to us all, if only in the
sense that we were once born. I
want to talk to these people with the
negative comments, along with those
who are already high on childbirth.

There is so much more to preg-
nancy and delivery than the end
product of a baby. There is the
woman involved. What is happen-
ing to her? Who will she be after
the title "mother" is bestowed on
her? Does that title replace the
state of being a woman? I believe
not. And what about the man? The
woman with whom he's slept and
romanced is now bitchy, fat, and
disturbs his sleep with her belch-
ing and multitudinous nocturnal
visits to the john. And along comes
a baby who sucks on the very
breasts that he enjoyed for so long
and saps all her energy. He feels
mighty left out. Society makes it
clear that he'd better act like Dag-
wood when it comes to baby care,
even though his penis doesn't ever
get caught in the diaper pin when
he changes the baby! And some-
thing about his calm, deep voice
and reassuring manner is magic
to that fretful baby. But, alas, he
has that image to maintain. Wow,
there is a classic case of female
chauvinism.

People have been short changed
up to now. Women haven't had the
chance to actively participate in
what happens to their bodies. Men
have been thrust out of the nest to
kill off the beasts of the world.
Children have weekend fathers,
frustrated mothers. Men and
women are growing apart. Now as
a result of consumerism, educa-
tion, self-awareness, the women's
movement, and the disenchantment
of our youth, the course of obstet-
rical care is changing back to what
it was originally: a family centered
event, with the protection of good
medical care. But it must not
stop there. There is need for more
discussions of human sexuality,
the relatedness of a man and a
woman, the honest care of children.
These discussions I intend to pro-
vide.

My classes are a kind of free-
school on family life. They are
very informal, open to men and
women, married or single, preg-
nant or not. We have opportun-
ities to learn the physiology of
pregnancy, delivery, lactation,
post-partum and thereafter. The
psychological aspects of each of
these states are fully explored,
along with our own feelings, and
we re-evaluate our feelings as the
classes progress. We talk about
establishing reasonable goals, and
the necessity for flexibility. We
do exercises for fitness, and pre-
paring the muscles of delivery.

Relaxation, what a fantastic topic.
We have a lot of fun learning that
with music, touching, rapping.
Relaxation is the key to a positive
experience, whether it be birthing
a baby or taking a final exam or
making a soufflé.

We spend a lot of time discover-
ing ourselves and what it means to
relate to another human being.
Really relate, to reach out and
touch the heart and soul of that
person and to allow ourselves to
be open so they can touch us. We
explore the destructiveness of the
current male-female roles, and
find positive ways to carry on the
work of living without resorting to
those cop-outs. It's called human
liberation.

We discuss the myths which create
a supernatural aura around the
state of motherhood. Frankly, I
don't associate one thing ethereal
with sloshing a browned diaper in
and out of toilet water!

Another important feature is the
exploration of the bond between a
man and woman involved, or people
of the same sex, when a child
enters into the picture. Often
people discover only too late that
their endeavors as parents have
completely obliterated the union
that may have once been present.
It is only after the children are
away do they discover that they
shared meals, sex, chickenpox,
report cards, summer camps,
etc. for nearly a quarter of a
century without really relating to
one another. Our work puts empha-
sis on the need to maintain that
union along with family life.

We discuss human sexuality,
explore our feelings and examine
the concepts involved. A lot of
people are really uptight about
talking about making love. That
old tape from Mom and Dad goes
off in our heads, "You just don't
talk about THAT." Oh sure, they
were the first ones to make jokes
about sex, but getting right down
to talking honestly about it was
another matter indeed; something
private. Well, it's exactly that
kind of rationalization that keeps
taboos alive and fears and mis-
conceptions abundant. Will light-
ning strike if there is open commun-
ication about our sex lives? I doubt
it. Sure, you'll be embarrassed,
and I'll probably be as nervous as
that kid in "Summer of 42" going
to buy his first rubber. But then,
I get nervous going to the dentist
or getting on the plane. I'll survive
and you'll survive, and we'll be a
lot healthier for it. There are a
lot of questions people have about
sex, and there should be a place in
childbirth-family life classes that
provides opportunities for honest
answers.
