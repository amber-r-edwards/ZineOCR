"Objective reporting is a  
myth in the first place--you've  
got to be actively causing  
things to happen and then  
cover them." Flo was on her  
way to the airport and several  
DISTAFF women had caught a  
few minutes in private with  
her to ask how she thought the  
paper could be more effective.  

She said she saw the paper  
as a centralizing force to  

PARA MED...  

There are three para-medical  
schools in New Orleans that  
have been under attack for some  
time by the Better Business  
Bureau: Louisiana Training  

Center at 203 Carondelet Street,  

Tulane Avenue Medical Academy  
at 2126 Tulane Avenue, and  

New Orleans Medical Training  
School at 3534 Tulane Avenue.  
Tom Soniat of the BBB says he  
receives calls almost daily  
about the employment situation  

CURB...  

strategy. The loose coalition, led  
by feminist Sue Westbrook, has  
been astoundingly together. Though  
conflicts have occurred, the effort  
is perhaps the most effective alli-  
ance of oppressed groups yet wit-  
nessed in the city.  

CURB's monitoring process has  
predictably unearthed harrowing  
evidence of sexism and racism over  
the boob tube. News announcers and  
newsmakers are overwhelmingly  
white and male. One channel showed  
a female reporter covering less  
than one percent of stories. Women  
are almost never the newsmakers;  
blacks are featured mostly in sports  
and in a proportion to whites well  
below their portion of the real  
population. Black females virtually  
do not exist in the news as well as  
in other programming.  

In commercials, "authority figures  
and 'experts' were nearly always  
male," reported Annabelle Walker in  
summarizing NOW monitoring  
results. Women were presented  
in TV commercials as "silly, ig-  
norant, dull, vain, submissive,  
and neurotically anxious to please  
men."  

"Amazing what scientific research  
will uncover," said all we monitors  
to ourselves after the task was  
completed, yet what impressed the  

TV stations was not the novelty of  
our claim but that it was backed up  

by over 4,000 pages of empirical  
data.  

This evidence, and the allotment  
of time and money to responsive  

Flo Kennedy raps about distaff  

gathering women together for po-  
litical action, to initiate  
pickets and protests and then  
write about them. That way  
readers would relate to an  
active political unit, not  
just a journalistic body.  
There was a repetition of her  
theme from the lecture at LSU  
on the Pathology of Oppression  
and from the potluck supper  
where she had informally  

of graduates of such schools.  
"In some cases a certificate  
from the school actually keeps  
them from getting a job," he  
told DISTAFF. "The better  
paying places simply won't  
hire them."  

Currently, the three schools  
in question are being reviewed  
by the Louisiana Proprietary  
School Commission in public  
hearings in the 9th floor  
conference room of the State  
Department of Education in  

public affairs programming, are  
the critical issues of negotiation  
between CURB and the television  
stations. Thus far, the process  
has been full of surprises. Channel  
8 (WVUE), which was expected to  
be the most recalcitrant station,  
became the first one to achieve a  
full agreement with CURB. The  
agreement includes a beefed-up  
affirmative action program for  
women and minorities (in fact,  
two female reporters were hired  
by the station over the past month)  
and a tripling of public affairs  
programming to include prime  

time and some coverage of women's  
issues.  

Channel 4 (WWL), station of the  

tax-free Jesuit fathers, is expected  
to reach agreement sometime in  
April. As of press time, CURB is  
likely to file a license challenge  
with the FCC against Channel 6, as  
negotiations with this station broke  
down in the early stages.  

These efforts, no matter how suc-  
cessful, are essentially a symptom-  
atic attack upon the media malaise.  
A true attack would strike at the  
people who have brought it to us:  
those vast commercial interests  
which turn both producers and  
viewers into puppets on the new  
world stage. The medium cool  
must become a monopoly of the  

people.  

Until then, or until next license  
renewal time, CURB is making the  
most of its minimal prerogatives  
to make waves over the wavelengths  
in New Orleans.  

Addressed local feminists:  
DISTAFF should be where the  
action is, no matter if it's  
City Hall,  
Parish Prison, the  
meat boycott or the suit against  
Charity Hospital for not al-  
lowing abortions in a federally  
funded medical  
facility. The  
paper has to be there, intro-  
ducing the issues and serving  
as a vehicle for actuating  
change.  

They, along with  
other private schools in the  
state, are asked by the Commis-  
sion to present full details  

on their staff, course, tui-  
tion and advertising claims  

to determine whether or not  

they will be granted a state  
license to continue operation.  

Until October 1972, private  
schools in Louisiana were not  
subject to state control; any-  
one could open a school and  
claim to train people for a  
profession. Last year, black  
legislators proposed an act  
to bring all private schools  
under the jurisdiction of the  
State Board of Education.  

They felt that too many  
such schools are ripping off  
the black community and other  
minority people who are not  
able to attend colleges or  
accredited trade schools.  
Since October 1972, all private  
schools must apply for a li-  
cense, pay $100 for that  
license and post a $10,000  
bond. Licenses are granted  
only if the school can prove  
that it actually offers the  
education advertised and li-  
censes may be revoked at any  
time the Commission finds  
reason to do so.  

Cheryl Butler, who works  
with Attorney General William  
Guste's office, suggests that  
women who have had bad exper-  
iences with para-medical  
schools in New Orleans, es-  
pecially in the area of find-  
ing employment after complet-  
ing such courses, write the  
Commission about the complaint,  
sending a copy of the letter  
to the Attorney General's  
office. Tom Soniat of the BBB  
has offered to help women  
write such letters and to get  
notarized statements of their  
testimony.  

The Commission, made up of  
seven members, all male and all  
white, does not seem to con-  
sider the question of employ-  
ability as pertinent, Soniat  
said. He feels sure the three  
para-medical schools will be  
licensed despite their failure  
to live up to their job place-  

ment offer to graduates. "In  
my opinion, it will be a  

license to steal," he said.
