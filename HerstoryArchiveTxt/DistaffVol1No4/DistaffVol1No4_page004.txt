DOWN TO EARTH

(DISTAFF editor asked Susan
Raymond to write a personal
account of her life as an artist.
This was her response.)

DISTAFF: Do you ever have any
gallery showings of
your artwork?
Well, no...I'm kind of
turned off to the gallery
deal.

DISTAFF: See, we want to get
some women to write
articles about themselves.

Well, I just work at
Jackson Square and
I'm trying to go up to
Arkansas anyway.

DISTAFF: Do you write?

ME: Well, not really...
Reflecting, I decided I do have a
few thoughts to toss out. Dr. Sor-
um, a psychiatrist speaking at the

Newman Center at Tulane said

something to the effect that because

of social conditioning, women pre-
tend they are dumber than men
after adolescence. I don't agree.

At least for myself that has not

been true. I think I could succeed

at a high-paying, respectable
profession. College is the main
prerequisite for most professions
and earning a bachelor's degree
from the University of California was
not very difficult for me. I am not

a doctor, a lawyer, a scientist, an

executive, a gallery artist because

I do not want to be. I am not pre-

tending that I cannot do the work.

I think I do not place a high value

on the usual product of these pro-

fessions. I do not want to subject
my life to a man-made framework.

What do I place a high value on?
From Lao Tzu:

There is a thing confusedly formed,

Born before heaven and earth.

Silent and void

It stands alone and does not

change,

Goes round and does not weary.

It is capable of being the mother

of the world.

I know not its name

So I style it 'the way'.

Or from the Bible:

The wind blows where it wills;
you hear the sound of it, but you
do not know where it comes from
or where it is going. So with
everyone who is born from
spirit—John 3.

I feel good about my work at
Jackson Square when I get heart and
soul into it. When I'm out of touch with
"the way" my work can be a
drag. I have a hill farm in the
Ozarks. I hope to spend more time
up there and share the farm with
people of all ages who have gotten
out of touch with nature.
Sometimes I have a hard time
relating to people honestly—heart
and soul. I think lots of men and
women have this problem. It is
hard to measure real happiness. I don't
think we should assume
a person is really bad off because
they are lying face down in the
dirt. Some of my most beautiful
moments have been face down in
the dirt.
