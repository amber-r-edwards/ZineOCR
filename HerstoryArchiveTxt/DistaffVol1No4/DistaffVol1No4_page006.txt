HOW SHE DIED  

HOW SHE DIED by Helen Yglesias  
is a feminist novel in the per-  
haps negative sense that it  
explores the traps and confine-  
ments many of us are trying to  
move away from, not the free-  
doms we are trying to move to-  
ward. It gives us a clear view  
of the world we wish to change.  
Yglesias shows very painfully  
the horrors and disasters in  
the lives of two women, Mary  
and Jean, the former dying  
figuratively and literally with-  
in marriage and the latter  
trying to cope with separation,  
divorce, three male children,  
and various stray men who enter  
her life.  

Mary, the "she" of the title,  
grew up without a father and  
with a mother who was a Com-  
munist Party member convicted  
of being an atomic bomb spy  
and sentenced to life imprison-  
ment when Mary was eight. Mary  
was reared by a leftist group  
called the Committee, and when  
the novel opens, she, though  
married, still receives finan-  
cial and emotional support from  
this group. Jean, Mary's best  
friend, is apolitical and lives  
on the fringes of the Party,  
her concern being more personal  
relationships and personal so-  
lutions than politics.  

The title of this novel is  
slightly misleading. It opens  
with Mary in the hospital to  
have her breast removed after  
having her second child, a  
daughter, a pregnancy which  
the doctors realize too late  
was a mistake. The operation  
reveals that Mary has cancer  
and will not live long: the  
remainder of the novel concerns  
her dying, or rather her friends'  
reaction to her slow death, as  
only two chapters are from  
Mary's point of view and all  
others are from Jean's. This  
novel is not easy for a femi-  
nist to read, for the reader  
is forced to see Mary through  
a long series of humiliations:  
her life's work as a political  
activist not respected by her  
husband and best friend; her  
marriage to a man weaker than  
herself but stronger and more  
cruel in the manner peculiar  
to those weak and dependent;  
the conspiracy to withhold the  
news of her encroaching death  
from her, thereby denying her  

its dignity and mean-  

ing; her confinement  

in a  

mental insti-

once she is told of her  
terminal disease and tries to  
react to its reality; her be-  
trayal by her husband and best  
friend; a series of medical  
blunders which lead to her  
body being used finally for  
experimentation; and then at  
last her painful death when she  
is made into a leftist cult  
idol and strangers and friends  
alike are brought in to witness  
her dying.  
Jean, a strange friend at  
best for Mary, seeks to fulfill  
herself not through work or  
political action but through  
men she hopes will give her  
identity and wholeness. A di-  
vorced mother in her late thir-  
ties, Jean finds only married  
men or men who are “between  
women" available for her. Lack-  
ing a sense of self, Jean, in  
constant battle with her sons,  
ex-husband, or lovers, always  
suffers apologetic defeat. The  
night she learns of Mary's im-  
pending death, Jean and Mary's  
husband begin an affair which  
is a cruel exercise in mutual  

dependency and misery.  

Unhappy and unsympathetic as  
Jean appears, the reader is still  
able to find some sympathy with  
her struggles and her rage a-  
gainst her situation. Her met-  
aphor for her view of herself  
is that of a woman "hooked up  
to another's pulse."  

Jean, alone in her room, is  
often bitter about her life.  

On motherhood: "Dumb-beast  
pregnancy, blind child rear-  
ing, ugly middle-aged meddling  
and messing around in their  
lives--and then--acting, no  
feeling, just a pain in the ass  
to them in old age." On her  
relationships with men: "Re-  
touching my lips, in that idi-  
otic pink and red fancy ladies'  
john, I had a terrific insight  
into myself. That I wasn't  
yielding and feminine and  
giving and all that crap with  
men because of my generous,  
womanly nature, but because I  
was scared to be straight with  
them, I was terrified of men's  
displeasure."  

Jean is of interest to the  
reader because she has enough  
self-recognition to make her  
struggles seem valid, but ul-  
timately it is Mary who inter-  
ests us most because her life  
has been one long struggle  
against the entire fabric of  
society, which is epitomized  
by the fine use of the madness  
of life in NYC as the backdrop  
for the action in this novel.  
We suffer for her defeat more  
than for Jean's because Mary  
has a greater sense of self.  
One finishes this novel wish-  
ing that Helen Yglesias had  
shown more of Mary's life be-  
fore she dies in the midst of  
the struggle that many of us  
are just beginning.

BLACKBERRY  
WINTER  

by Charlotte Behre  

BLACKBERRY WINTER by Margaret  
Mead is the autobiography of  
a woman who says, "I was brought  

up within my own culture two  
generations ahead of my time."  
In it, Margaret Mead gives a  
full account of her family and  
an equally detailed account of  
those friends and fellow anthro-  
pologists who shared her edu-  
cational years and her work.  

Margaret has long been a  
"liberated woman." Both her  
mother and grandmother before  
her were vitally interested in  
the world around them and im-  
parted this attitude to their  
children. It is interesting  
that even though they were both  
educators, they chose to send  
Margaret to a formal school for  
only a very few years during  
her growth period. Because they  
felt learning can effectively  
take place only in an unre-  
stricted atmosphere, they chose  
a learning environment in  
which Margaret and her siblings  
could progress at the pace they  
chose. Needless to say, Margaret  
Mead has been pursuing know-  
ledge ever since.  

She comes across as a woman  
who has approximated her potent-  
ial as a scientist and a human  
being and who is still growing  
as a septuagenarian.  

She describes her deep love  
and respect for her family and  
relatives, but an even greater  
ability to live with and love  
the human race.  

She is exuberant about her  
life as a student at Barnard  
and describes her living ar-  
rangements with a group of  
students as follows: “We be-  
longed to a generation of young  
women who felt extraordinarily  
free--free to postpone marriage  
while we did other things, free  
from the need to bargain and
