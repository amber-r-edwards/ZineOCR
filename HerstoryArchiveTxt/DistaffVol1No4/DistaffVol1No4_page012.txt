Letters to Us

Dear DISTAFF Workers & Readers:

I would like to respond to your  
"Right On" column where you  
mentioned Lindy Boggs could be  
Louisiana's first woman elected to  
Congress. Lindy Boggs did NOT  
win the recent Democratic primary:  
Mrs. Hale Boggs won.

Let's not deceive ourselves into  
thinking Louisiana has given women  
the slightest victory whatsoever.

If Lindy Boggs had run on anything  
other than her husband's memory  
and the sympathy of the general  
public to the "widow," surely she  
would not have won.

Even if the women's movement  
succeeds in equal representation in  
Congress, business and all other  
institutions, so what? This system  
is inherently sexist. It must be  
torn down and replaced with one  
where all people are treated with  
equality and dignity.

Capitalism needs some group or  
groups to be the underdog so it  
can thrive. Let's not play those  
games.

Maureen O'Neill

right on!

*** Sarah Frances Anders, acting dean and chairperson of the depart-  
ment of sociology at Louisiana College, Pineville, who asked the  
Southern Baptist Convention to grant women full and equal status with  
men in the leadership of the church. No woman has ever served as  
pastor in an SBC church.

*** State Representative, Dorothy Mae Taylor, for her recent organ-  
ization of a citizens' group to protest conditions in Parish Prison. (We  
hope she will add the Women's House of Detention to the cause.)

*** Debby Millenson, attorney, who after the U.S. 5th Circuit Court  
of Appeals rejected her suit against the Monteleone Hotel Men's Grill,  
says she plans to continue the case. She is also filing suit against  
Hotard's Restaurant in Gretna, the other local public eating place: re-  
fusing to serve people on the basis of sex.

*** Darlene Fife, editor of NOLA EXPRESS, who was asked by the  
Committee of Small Magazine Editors and Publishers (COSMEP) to  
coordinate local programs for their convention in June at Tulane.

*** Patsy Sims, States-Item reporter, whose novel-length series  
about people on sugar cane plantations is the first major publicity  
given the subject. The series called "Behind the Cane Curtain" will  
be available in booklet form for schools and individuals.

*** Evangelist Billy Graham, who during a recent crusade in South  
Africa, stated he recommends castration for rapists.
