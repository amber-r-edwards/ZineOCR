Maud: I love

Into the traditionally male do-
main of television (plugging pro-
ducts, male heroes, female
passivity) strides a tall, proud
daughter-of-a-bull, Maud. And we
love her, every Tuesday night at
7:00, all of us anonymous statistics
of the Neilson ratings. If Archie
Bunker could do it, so can Maud.
Her show has every bit of the bite
and sting of 'All in the Family':
delightfully funny lines perfectly
spaced and timed, laughter that
sounds canned despite live audi-
ences and innuendos that gorgeous-
ly succeed in violating TV moral-
ity codes. It's fun to watch Maud.
She's so damned funny—they're all
damned funny. Ha! Ha! Ha!

Somewhere the laughing stops,
comedy takes on seriousness, su-
perficiality begs for depth. Who is
this unorthodox lampoon of a wo-
man? Whom does she represent?
Why is she so funny?

At first glance, one would bill her
Liberated Woman of the Year. She
is in total command—certainly not
passive—and she makes her own
decisions and bears their conse-
quences unflinchingly. Her strength
and tenacity must be admired by
even the most insensitive male
chauvinist.

Under her heavy tread, pre-
judices are stomped to oblivion
and positive images emerge; whites
hug blacks and vice versa, em-
ployer respects employee, mother
loves daughter, husband and wife
operate in an equal balance of

While petitions are being filed
against Hap Glaudi, sportscaster on

Channel 4-TV, for his condescending

remarks and dirty-old-man chuckles
about women athletes, the local daily
newspaper is also due comment on
the exploitation of women.

One of the obvious examples re-
cently has been STATES-ITEM
coverage of Pam Von Hatton, who
assists her boxer husband, Tom, in
the ring as his trainer and second.
The Von Hattons, of Dallas, Texas,
appeared in New Orleans March 21
when Tom lost a welterweight
contest to Melvin Dennis.

Advance publicity for the fight
billed Von Hatton and his “attractive
wife”—never even mentioning her
first name—as the "principal
attractions" of the evening.

powers. We gloat in Maud's suc-
cess to attack sacred cows of
American society and always come
away grinning.

A second, studied glance brings
another view into focus. For all her
flaunting of chic, liberal ideas and
her well-placed barbs, Maud's role
as a woman remains pathetically
traditional, and beneath the light-
hearted exterior she is as solidly
middle class and status quo as any
soap opera star.

Maud is—and always will be—
first and foremost a housewife.
She never transcends the wife and
mother image; supporting, cajoling,
unconditional giving of self. She
never stops complaining about the
limitations of that role, as pleas-
antly disguised in humor as her
complaints may be. At heart she
yearns to expand, to be somebody
in her own right, yet she lacks the
ability to do so. Even with a grown
daughter and a maid, her time is
still taken up with running the
household and supervising the
family. By trying so hard not to be a
stereotype she ends up being just that;
an updated Lucy Ball, smarter and
aware of her rights but impotent to
effect social change.

And who dares not to love Lucy?
Sure, we laugh at Maud because in
her we women find an identification
we hardly knew existed. Laughing
at her is laughing at ourselves. We
have long since learned that laughter
hides the pain easier than does
crying.

with the Von Hattons by Renee
Saucier in the Family Section, in
which Pam said she resented the
glamorous, sexy image reporters
were accustomed to giving her. "I
wear hot pants," she said, "because
they're in style and they're easy to
work in in the ring."

This was seconded by her husband
in the article who also thinks report-
ers give the wrong impression. "She's
not up there for show—she knows
what she's doing," he said.

But sports writer Nat Belloni of
the STATES-ITEM never got together
with the Family Section reporter. A
few pages back in the same newspaper
Belloni gave Pam mention only as
"an attractive blonde who will serve as
her husband's second," and hurried
on to say that another woman would
be appearing at the fight, a "special
sign-girl" whom promoter Vince
Arona had "indicated will be something to look at."

Reporting March 22, the day after
the fight, Belloni could not resist a
crude pun by describing Pam as "a
knockout in her bright pink pants suit
with white turtleneck sweater." (How
much more modestly could she be
dressed?)

Tom Von Hatton told reporter
Saucier that besides providing him
with a competent trainer and second,
Pam's position makes it possible for
them to travel as a family with their
3-year-old daughter, Tammy, a
reasonable consideration for any
athlete who has to spend a majority
of time on the road. But none of his
nor Pam's opinions on the subject
came across to male sports writers
who insisted on viewing Pam Von
Hatton as "someTHING to look at."

Which leaves all us women sports
fans wondering why Tom Von Hatton
was never given credit for being
handsome, as his photos show him
to be, nor why we were never told
the color of his boxing trunks. If
these considerations were not
pertinent to his position in the ring,
why should they have been for his
wife?
