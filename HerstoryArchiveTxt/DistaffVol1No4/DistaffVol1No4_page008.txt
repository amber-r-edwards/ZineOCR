Growing up isn't easy. Growing up  
when you're not quite sure what you  
are is even harder. I mean what if  
your self-concept doesn't conform  
with the socially assigned one? As  
was my case: a little girl who does  
not want to identify as female so  
having no other model identified in  

large degree as male. (Boy-identified  
in this case.) I knew that I was  
attracted to other little girls -  

which was confusing because I also  
knew that that wasn't the way I was  
supposed to feel because wasn't the  
whole world paired into male and  

female: Mommy/Daddy, Grand-  

mother/Grandfather, Aunt/Uncle  

and all their male and female couple  
friends or single friends who always  
talked about the opposite sex? And  

then there were most of my girl-  
friends talking about how they could  

not wait to "grow up" and go on dates  

and get married and become  
Mommies. I could wait - a long  

time - like forever. I wanted no part  

of that grown-up business. I was a  

total Tomboy: trees, fields, woods,  

dirt piles and mud puddles, etc.  

were my domain. I was a free spirit  
running, playing barefooted,  
barebacked and blue-jeaned (boys'  
dungarees), climbing trees, building  

tree forts, playing cowboys and  

Indians or football and softball, dig-  
ging holes. And when not outside, I  
was reading adventure stories. I was  
Tarzan or Kit Carson or the Last  

of the Mohicans - any free and ad-  
venturous person (which always hap-  
pened to be a man). When I did play  
house I was always the Daddy. I  

dreaded becoming a teenager because  

it meant I would grow breasts and  
wear bras — I would no longer be  
able to run around shirtless. I did  
not want to date boys - I preferred  
beating them up or beating them at  
their own games. And as for becom-  
ing a housewife and Mommy: noth-  
ing struck me as more unappealing  
than spending my days washing,  
ironing, cooking, cleaning, etc.  
(And I was sure that having a baby  
meant that my tummy would be cut  
open.) And my Mother didn't seem  
to me as though she was having a  
good time. She seemed happiest  
when she was outside weeding and  
watering her plants - as was my  
Grandmother - a small, brown  
tanned woman whose greatest joy  
was fishing. Fortunately my Mother  
didn't push me — she knew the bur-  
dens would come soon enough. I  
went through none of the usual teen-  
age trials and traumas (period ex-  
cepted) of "first love", "first date  
and dance" and "will I be accepted  
by my peers?" routine. I rejected

before I ever had the chance to be  
rejected. I was alone because I knew  

I was different. It was a very diffi-  
cult time for me because I was doing  
more than rejecting a role — I was  
also protecting a secret: I was a  
homosexual. Because, finally, at  
the age of thirteen I heard the word  
Lesbian and what it meant. I spent  
hours at the library reading in the  
encyclopedias about homosexuality.  
While I was relieved to know that I  
wasn't the only one attracted to mem-  
bers of the same sex, I was con-  
firmed in my suspicions that such a  
thing was not acceptable - was, in  
fact, viewed as sick, perverted, ab-  
normal, psychotic and sinful. But I  
didn't believe any of it. I couldn't  
see how loving another person,  
regardless of sex, could be wrong.  
Furthermore, my confusion was  

ended — I could now identify as a  
WOMAN who loved other women. I  
no longer had to rationalize with  
male fantasies. And I never once  

felt guilty - which is the most demor-  
alizing thing a homosexual person  
can feel because it denies self-  
acceptance and affirmation — feelings  
so necessary for saneness and whole-  
ness. However, I did keep my feel-  
ings to myself (none of my girl-  
friends ever knew the strong feelings  
I had for some of them.) At the most  
I feared rejection, at the least, dis-  
comfort and misunderstanding on  
their part. For fifteen years I felt  
very alone and isolated, unable and  
afraid to express my thoughts and  

feelings to anyone. I had no close  
friends. I spent most of my time in  
a fantasy world I created to assuage  
the loneliness I felt in my everyday  
existence.  

Yet I was not blind to what was go-  
ing on around me. My alienation  
gave me a distance, a perspective  
which enabled me to view the activity  
around me in a more critical and  
objective way because I was not dir-  
ectly involved.  

I could see from observing my own  
parents and relatives that marriage  
was an institution totally oppressive  
to women who did all the shitwork  
and had little time for themselves.  

I saw that the whole dating scene was  
oppressive because it took all the  
initiative away from women and gave  
it to men (some of whom didn’t want  
it anyway). How often did I hear a  
woman say that she couldn't go out  
with “the girls" because so and so  
just MIGHT call? In school men  
were treated as if they were smarter  
-- which they certainly always were  
not. Everywhere women deferred  

to men. And I honestly couldn't see  
how they deserved it. Everything:  
the roles, the rules, were already  
set up, pre-defined - and to step  
out of them was to be ostracized.  
Women were expected to be passive  
and giving, men to be aggressive  
and active. Conformity was the  
order of the day. A few of my teach-  
ers encouraged individualism: they  
and Emerson and Thoreau were my  
mentors. In college I was liked and  
respected by my peers but still had  
to ward off a few well-meaning  
friends who came after me with  
make-up kits and curlers. And I'll  
never forget the screams of envy  
when a dorm mate came in with a  
ring on her finger and was gleefully  
thrown in the shower. All of it to  
me was a bunch of crap. Even my  
most intelligent and independent fe-  
male friends played the games. But  
a time did come finally when I could  
tell them I was Gay — and they ac-  
cepted it — though they didn't under-  
stand.
