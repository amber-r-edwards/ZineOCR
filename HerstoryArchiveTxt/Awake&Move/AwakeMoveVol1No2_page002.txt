2 AWAKE & MOVE March 1971

TV is  
REVOLTING  

On Sunday, January 31,  
at 7:00 pm, a misleading program  
was aired on Channel 29, WTAF:  
Women are Revolting. The title  
alone indicates a contemptuous  
slant taken with regard to the  
Women's Movement and a latent  
disdain for women in general.  

From the alleged sampling  
of women at the beginning of  
the program, one would assume  
that 95% of all female human  
beings are nudes, models or  
Playboy Bunnies; 1% are like  
Eleanor Roosevelt; and the  
remaining 4% are miscellaneous,  
presumably wives and mothers.  
A particularly provoking scene  
featured the editor of  
"Penthouse" with a slavish  
woman wrapped around him, dumb  
with adoration. (Or possibly  
she was silently counting the  
money she was paid to betray  
her sisters.)  

From a technical standpoint,  
this show seemed to be  
a cloudy collage of “Laugh-In"  
rejects. It was very difficult  
to hear what the various re-  
sponses were. This may have  
been just as well since  
answers that were left in were  
often irrelevant and inane.  
For instance, one segment show-  
ing a man freaked out on  
drugs incoherently voicing  
his hatred of women was ludi-  
crous.  

Approximately 15 minutes of  
the hour-long "Women Are  
Revolting" featured brassiere  
factories, bras being tossed  
away or burnt, etc. It seemed  
to be included to elicit some  
cheap thrills, particularly  
that portion which was mostly  
bouncing breasts. A woman  
should be able to walk down  

the street without a bra and  
not be subject to rape or  
obscene remarks. What was  
presented here did not foster  
this, but rather the contin-  
uance of women as sexual objects.  
Besides, would so much time  
be given to the question of  
how liberated George Washington  

or any other male concerned  
with freedom would feel with  
or without a jock seat?  

I have written to the  

General Manager of station  
WTAF protesting this program.  

I have requested that he now  
give some time on Channel 29  
for speakers from NOW and  

Women's Liberation in the  

Philadelphia area to clarify  
their position. I have received  
no reply whatsoever so far.

WOMEN who would like to form a group based on voicing rather  
than suppressing any intense hostility felt as a result of  

sexism please write to Rita c/o Awake & Move.  

I would also  

like to hear from individuals who want an empathetic discussion.  

The destruction of my child  

was gradual.  

At one she was a flower,  

blooming, smiling, guileless.  

At two  

She danced when she walked.  

At three  

Already I had built a wall  

between us.  

At four  

I and the others took turns.  
At five she was closed.  
The wall had been built,  

Our work was complete.  

She was socialized;  

she was civilized.

Anti-Imperialist Women Rap With Philly Women  

Philly's problems seem to  
be Washington's problems.  

Women out of other movements in  
the Left are asking themselves  
just what is different about the  
women's movement? Why methods  
that worked a couple of years  
ago are not working now.  

That seems one of the con-  
clusions to draw after an after-  
noon of exchanging information  
and experience with Sharon Rose  
and Cathy Thackney, from the  
Washington D.C. Anti-Imperialist  
collective.  

The collective is made up of  
25 - 30 women. These women have  
divided into subgroups. One of  
the issues they are exploring is  
genocide in relation to abortion  
and birth control. The govern-  
ment seems to be co-opting a wo-  
man's right to decide what she  
should do with her own body.  
They also contributed a special  
issue to OFF OUR BACKS on women  
in the revolutionary movements  
around the world.  

Subgroups began conscious-  
ness-raising and then found after  
a few meetings that their time  
was being taken up instead with  
business meetings. Philly women  
admitted to that too. Sharon and  
Kathy both have full-time jobs  
and so find they're trying to do  
two jobs. Philly women suggested  
that maybe job sharing that two  
of the women were doing in this  
city might be a solution to more  
time for the movement.  

The women at the meeting  
agreed that in general women were  
not responding as in previous  
years women from the Left have  
learned to expect the masses to  
do. Wondering out loud was heard  
about the mind game. About where  
the reality was, about the alien-  
ation experienced by Left move-  
ment women. The feeling seemed  
to be that the real world was  
out there.  

Some of the activities go-  
ing on in the Washington Women's  
Liberation are a theatre group  
in psychodrama, the paper OFF  
OUR BACKS, a group of abortion  

counselors, two Day Care centers  

with a possible third. The Day  
Care was seen as privileged  
since working women could not  
donate time to these centers and  
that was part of their requirements.  

A Women's history course is  
being offered, and there were two  
public events, Dec. 20th celebra-  
tion, and concert in the women's  
prison.  

How to go about fundraising  
is also a joint problem of Wash-  
ington and Philly. Grants are  
favored when they can be ob-  
tained. Something like the People's  
Fund is beginning in Washington.  
All in all the situations in  
the two towns are amazingly simi-  
lar.  

Kathy and Sharon were part of  
a group who went to Palestine.  
They planned to show slides and  
talked about their trip at a cof-  
fee house that evening. The Fri-  
day night slide show did not come  
off because the women got tied up  
in a mammoth traffic jam outside  
of Washington.
