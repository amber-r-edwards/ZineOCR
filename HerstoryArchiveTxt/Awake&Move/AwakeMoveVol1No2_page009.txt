ZAP 2’

On January 27 a group of  
women who are concerned with  
the exploitation of women by  
commercial abortion services  
again visited ARS, Abortion  
Referral Service at their  
offices at 3900 Ford Road in  
Phila. (for account of previous  
action see Feb. issue Awake &  
Move, Zap 2) This time there  
were only four of us in the sub  
zero weather. The following  
dialogue is from a discussion  
with Mark Fisher, one of the two  
students who have dropped out of  
Temple University to run this  
"business" full time.

WOMAN: "Are you following any of  
the suggestions we made for  
improving your service toward  
being more concerned with the  
kind of treatment and care  
women get?"

MARK: "We're performing a pretty  
good service as best as we can.  
We're very busy now, call up  
and we'll make an appointment to  
sit down and talk."

WOMAN: "Well, we just wanted you  
to know that we're leafleting  
the people who live in this  
building about this office and  
the services it performs here,  
and we're notifying the manage-  
ment about the services."

MARK: "Oh, they're aware of it."

WOMAN: "We're not sure they're  
aware of it from the point of  
view of the people you purport  
to serve."

MARK: "O.K., if they let you  
stay here I have no qualms about  
it. Anything else I can help  
you with?"

WOMAN: "You're not helping us,  
or women at all."

WOMAN: "We're really fed up  
with people like you making  
profits from women who are in the  
situations they are in."

MARK: “Actually, the $25.90  
deposit that's taken in, I can't  
see why you are very upset  
about it, we're reaching a lot  
of girls."

WOMAN: "Women!"  
WOMAN: “What does the $25.90  
go for?"

MARK: "Very expensive advertising  
to contact almost every college  
in the country."

"and we work with Planned  
Parenthoods around the country."

WOMAN: "Which Planned Parenthoods,  
the Philadelphia branch?"

MARK: "No, mostly in the South  
and the Midwest."

WOMAN: "Is this service known as  
Abortion Referral Service in the  
South and Midwest, all over the  
country?"

MARK: "Yeah, I believe so."

WOMAN: "Do you rent this office?  
and the lease is in your name?"

MARK: "I'm not sure, is it in my  
name? I don't know, I don't know  
if it's in my name or Abortion  
Referral Service, either one,  
not sure."

WOMAN: "I saw an ad last night  
in the paper which said ARS,  
I-N-T, what's the I-N-T for?"

MARK: "International."

WOMAN: "You mean you are exploiting  
women in Europe, or just Third  
World?"

MARK: "Third World."

WOMAN: "Are the women getting  
pregnancy tests now before they  
go to New York?"

MARK: "Yeah, they have been, for  
$3.00."

WOMAN: "Where?"

MARK: "West Park Hospital for  
one place."

WOMAN: "What kind?"  
MARK: "A urinalysis."

WOMAN: "That's an inadequate  
determination."

MARK: "Well if they can't  
determine it that way they use  
slides and I'm really not sure  
how it's done."

WOMAN: "And then the women have  
to pay another $3.90?"

MARK: "No, it's just $3.00. If  
you just walked in there for a  
test you'd have to pay $8.90 but  
we worked it out with the clinic  
they bill us and then the girls  
bring in the $3.00 and then we pay  
the clinic."

WOMAN: "They  
are women, not girls."  
MARK: "I'm sorry, women."  
WOMAN: "Where is this?"

MARK: "West Park Hospital right  
across the street."

WOMAN: "I don't understand why  
women coming in off the street  
would have to pay $8.90 and the  
women you send there would only  
pay $3.90, I don't understand  
where their heads are at."

MARK: "I don't know, maybe they're  
hasty too." "Well, that's a  
good service, you've got to admit  
that's a good service, a pregnancy  
test for $3.90."

WOMAN: "Well, it's not a good  
service when an unreliable test  
is used."

WOMAN: "I've been reading your  
ads and they say professionals,  
who are the professionals on your  
staff?"

MARK: "Well, we have a psychologist  
on retainer, and we have a, uh,  
case social worker who's now with us."

WOMAN: "Are they actually in the  
office?"

MARK: "Yes."

WOMAN: "What's on retainer mean?"

MARK: "Well they get paid a fee  
and we send them to do counseling  
at different colleges."

WOMAN: "Who's that?"

MARK: "Oh, uh, the psychologist?  
Uh, I'm not sure of the name I'll  
have to look it up."

WOMAN: "Why don't you?"

MARK: "Cause I don't feel like it  
and besides what difference does  
it make to you if I give you their  
name?"

WOMAN: "We might be interested in  
talking to them for one thing, for  
another thing I have serious  
questions if you don't know  
the name of the  
person you are paying money to for  
this service."

MARK: "Then I'm lying, right?!"

WOMAN: "It sounds hokey to me."

WOMAN: "It sounds like they aren't  
doing anything, if you work with  
someone you get to know their name  
pretty soon, it seems."

MARK: "Well, I don't know their  
name, I'm sorry."

"Well, the phones are  
getting busy, so why don't you  
call back and we'll sit down and  
talk and I'll make sure Alan is  
here too, so you can talk to him."

WOMAN: "Well, we're getting past  
the talking stage."

MARK: "O.K., well, take care."

We wonder if he meant to  
take care so we wouldn't need his  
exploitative services.
