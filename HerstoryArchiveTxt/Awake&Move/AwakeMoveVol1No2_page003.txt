On January 19, 1970, Philadelphia  
area high school students attended  
a forum on Woman's Liberation at the  
Sheraton Hotel in center city. The  
meeting was sponsored by the Phila-  
delphia World Affairs Council. Three women  
from the Woman's Center also attended,  
but their activities were  
restricted to selling and handing  
out literature. The World Affairs  
Council felt that the presence of  
movement women might be construed  
as an endorsement of the Woman's  
Liberation Movement. The Center  
women were told that the students  
had read a wide selection of  
feminist literature, and had been  
instructed to debate the matter  
among themselves, without inter-  
ference. Therefore, although the  
female directors of the World  
Affairs Council were sympathetic,  
the students and the Woman's  
Liberation people did not mingle.  

The guest speaker for the  
forum was Lisa Richette, a lawyer  
and a professor at Villanova Law  
School. Recently, she published  
a book called The Throwaway Children.  
In her speech, Mrs. Richette  
lent the Woman's Liberation Move-  
ment qualified support; she  
offered numerous examples of  
sexist discrimination from her  
own struggles in the field of  
law, and also expressed shock  
at the poor choices for the list  
of the Ten Most Admired Women.  
Citing these women's lack of  
real contribution to society,  
she stated, “All of these women  
acquired their status secondarily.  
Why is it admirable to be the  
hand-holder of Richard Nixon?"  
Mrs. Richette deplored the  
apathy of women today, saying,  
“Everything in this culture makes  
it easy for a woman to be a cop-  
out." Even if a woman succeeds  
in making it in a man's world,  
there are those people who would  
keep her at the lowest level, and  
pile the hardest work upon her.  

churchwomen discuss  
Sexism  

The Subcommittee on Resources  
(related to the Task Force on  
Women) met on October 16 in Pat  
Kepler's office in the Wither-  
spoon Building.  

The meeting was focused on  
the need to develop resources to  
raise the consciousness of women  
in the church at the local level  
and enable them to become involved  
in meaningful change around the  
male/female question.  

The immediate goal is compiling  
literature and audio-visual aids  
for four training sessions in  
February for women interested in  
forming local task forces to  
deal with the role of women in  
church and society.  

The committee discussed  
discrimination faced by women at  
all levels of the church - in  
employment, in elected and  
appointed positions of decision  
making, and in an attitude which  
holds that women are suited for  
only certain kinds of participation  
in the church and society. Common  
themes were the need to change  

the hierarchical, authoritarian  
and elitist structures (like  
closed meetings of church trustees,  
definitions of secretaries vs.  
professionals), compulsory every-  
thing (education, men as bread-  
winners, women as housewives  
and mothers - the attitude  
seeming to be that "If we don't  
force them to, they won't do it").  

Women's liberation implying  
everybody's liberation - including  
minority groups, men, children  
was discussed. The Committee  
also talked about community.  

Has the church perpetuated  
stereotypes which dehumanize  
men and women? A need was felt  
for consciousness raising and a  
paper on how theology affects  
women and prevents them from  
fighting for the liberation of  
women. Similar roles of women  
and clergymen were explored.  

The Committee talked about  
the need for male approval  
which causes churchwomen to  
compete with other women.  
Many women are or have been  

Lisa Richette told of a case she  
handled where the United States  
government had been keeping women  
and black civil servants in the  
lowest positions by falsifying  
their records when they were in  
line for promotions.  

Unfortunately, however, fully  
documented her evidence on the  
oppression of women might have  
been, Mrs. Richette mouthed a few  
of the popular clichés on Woman's  
Liberation, among them the typical  
disavowal of bra-burning, and the  
opinion that Kate Millet's book  
Sexual Politics was "a vast  
exercise in paranoia." Also,  
she felt compelled to disown  
man-haters and masturbators since  
she opined that there was no need  
for "alternatives" to men.  

On the important subject of  
day care, Mrs. Richette cautioned  
day care advocates on forgetting  
that “a child is a human being.”  

It was felt that the support  

of other women could counteract  
these marks of women's oppression.  
In a women's group, women could  
deal with their own self-image  
and could use the group as a  
point of reference even as they  
made places for themselves and  
other women in male-oriented,  
decision-making structures.  
Perhaps, because women are  
generally uncorrupted by  

power up to now, they can  

bring with them new ways of  
relating to people in human ways.  

Some literature that had  
already been created was shared.  
There is a need for more.  

The Committee decided to re-  
write the poem EVERYWOMAN -  
applying it to EVERYCHURCHWOMAN  
and will bring ideas for this  
at the next committee meeting.  
When the poem is rewritten,  
it may be translated into a  
sound-and-slide show.
