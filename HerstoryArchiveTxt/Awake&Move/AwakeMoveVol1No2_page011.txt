NEW WINE

Organic is the key word.  
The radical women and the es-  
tablishment women who have both  
made it in the male patriarchal  
hierarchy are, at the moment,  
deaf and blind to what the most  
radical revolution in history  
is all about.  

Radical women show this  
by coming to the women's move-  
ment and suggesting a demonstr-  
ation. What kind? Well, how  
about one on discrimination in  
employment? Or abortion?  
Either of these should draw a  
lot of women. Let's get the  
press and TV coverage and  
let's use a mass of women.  
Bodies are important. Warm  
bodies, workers and housewives'  
bodies.  

The establishment women  
agree but would work through  
the chamber of commerce, the  
current system's political  
parties, and they also want  
plenty of TV coverage and  
other media coverage, using wo-  
men to demonstrate against a-  
bortion laws and employment  
discrimination.  

But it becomes clearer  
and clearer that such imposed  
structures, methods and under-  
standings brought in from the  
patriarchy are not at all what  
the women's movement is.  

Basic to the women's move-  

ment is an amorphous, unstruct-  
ured, un-hierarchical act known  
as consciousness-raising.  

There are no leaders or fol-  
lowers, and in a group that  
works there is no domination,  
none of the slave-master non-  
sense that women can and do  
put on each other. Usually  
there are no more than ten wo-  
men in a group.  

There is a great deal of  
self-discovery and a mutuality  
of learning how oppression has  
affected each woman, how each  
woman has had the same stuff  
come down on her. As put re-  
cently: your neighbor has been  
playing nice and pretty Lady to  
you all these years and you've  
been playing the same to her,  
and all the while you're both  
hurting and pretending you're  
not.  

Women who have been lead-  
ers, when coming into consciou-  
ness-raising, have to wrestle  
with their old ways and give  
other women a chance to speak;  
women who have always followed  
have to push themselves to  
speak up. For this reason the  
technique of going around the  
circle (and it is a circle,  
not a square or oblong with a  
stage or lectern at the top)  
with each woman having a chance  
to speak in turn is an impor-  
tant tool.  

What begins to grow out  
of a group such as this is un-  
derstanding, warmth, and a  
high level of trust. The wo-  

men support each other and  
there flows from this process  
a tremendous energy. The wo-  
men in the group become impor-  
tant to each other in a way wo-  
men have never been before.  
Women build up a loyalty to  
each other. More than this  
when a group is organic (and  
that's how I started, didn't I)  
any number of possibilities  
for the group exist and most  
groups after a while also get  
into actions. Actions flow  
from the organic growth in the  
small group and are not, as in  
the patriarchy, an imposed  
structure. Women do not use  
women in demonstrations. They  
themselves feel an oppression  
very strongly and act against  
it. Women act out of their own  
needs and not because they are  
warm bodies and can be used.  

There is pressure on now  
to have black women in the mo-  
vement or factory women or wo-  
men still caught in the patri-  
archal structure. But all of  
these women will join us when  
they are ready because it is  
their movement too. All women  
will come together as each in-  
dividual woman realizes she is  
oppressed, not on an abstract,  
but on a gut level, day by day,  
reality of oppression way.  

One of the amazing re-  
sults of consciousness-rais-  
ing is a freeing of love for  
other women, not just in the  
group but outside the group.  
Positive feelings of support  
and care growing out of the  
group energy are passed along  
to other women.  

When a group is not to-  
gether, when they are fragmen-  
ted, it is sensed fairly soon.  
The group then is not able to  
help others because it cannot  
meet the needs of the women  
in its own group. Nothing  
moves. Under these circum-  
stances interminable discuss-  
ions leading nowhere can take  
place. Nothing can grow here.  

Women need love and care  
and sharing with each other.  
This is what is organic and  
the whole is not only greater  
than the parts but the parts,  
individual women, become grea-  
ter than their individual  
selves.  

Women need understanding  
and they get this by reaching  
a layer in themselves that is  
real. That is not cool or a-  
lienated. When they stop talk-  
ing generalities, head talk,  
and get into their feelings;  
when they express real emo-  
tions and take real risks.  

This is why talking over  

the sensation of being trapped,  

or being worthless, or demand-  
ing to be a human being, with  
a man, is so fruitless. These  
are not his problems.  

I'm not saying that men

are not trapped with a feeling  
of worthlessness, wanting to  
be human beings. What I'm  
saying is that all of this is  
a different level for women.  
Women are still, for a man,  
at the bottom of the pile.  
Women are still there to look  
down on; to be superior to.  
Women get absolutely nowhere  
discussing their feelings or  
thoughts with men because men  
do not take women's thoughts  
or feelings seriously. So wo-  
men end up doubly frustrated.  

Am I really trapped? Is it my  
imagination?  
As one woman said: "For  

years I tried to build some  
understanding between my hus-  
band and myself and got no-  
where. Then I came into cons-  
ciousness-raising and we began,  
all of us, to build communica-  
tions, to talk to each other,  
and I thought: 'This is what I  
was trying to do with my hus-  
band!'"  

Women with their heads in  
the patriarchy are settling for  
power. Power is obviously a  
bad trip. It is time women be-  
gan to explore other possibi-  
lities. Power has brought us  
to the brink of destroying the  
small spaceship we live on.  
Jockeying for power by the wo-  
men in the Left and in the es-  
tablishment is still the same  
game. Some women play that  
game well and so they quite na-  
turally want to stay with it.  
But patriarchal politics are  
not the only way. It's quite  
possible that these politics  

are worn out.  

Women, exploring the un-  
charted areas of the future  
with other women, may find a  
new politics. Women are just  
beginning to learn who they are  
after 5,000 or 10,000 years.  
This is an exciting and painful  
event to happen to a class: the  
finding of an identity.  

There is a tendency in  
women in the patriarchy and  
women in the women's movement  
to name call. Male Left, male-  
oriented woman, Feminist, anti-  
imperialist, revolutionary so-  
cialist. All these labels are  
just as damaging as housewife,  
mother, old maid, anarchist,  
career woman. They say this  
particular woman is in this  
box and this other woman is in  

that one. This is not a human  

being, it's a category.  

What women need to keep in  
mind is that all women are in  
the same box labeled second  
class all over the world (ex-  
cept in wartime) and that fight-  
ing among ourselves will only  
prolong this confinement. All  
of us together can push out of  
the box and learn together  

what woman as a person is.  

All of us together can change  
our quality of living and of  
loving in our world.
