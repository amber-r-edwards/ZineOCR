P.W.C.

Professional Women's  
Caucus is an action-oriented  
interprofessional, inter-  
disciplinary organization that  
evolved to fill a gap that  
existed in the women's move-  
ment. Its goal is to offer  
professional women an  
opportunity to participate  
and to contribute their talents,  
training and resources on a  
broad scale to achieve reforms  
for all women.

More than 500 women from  
21 states, the Virgin Islands  
and Canada attended the initial  
conference at N.Y.U. Law School  
in New York City in April of  
this year. At subsequent  
meetings 11 task forces were  
set up. These include task  
forces on: Education, Legal  
Action, Legislation, Research,  
Employment, Liaison, Public  
Information, Political Action,  
Economic Action, Professions  
and Family and Personal Life.  
Programs for action are still  
in the planning stages and will  
be discussed at a national  
meeting in the spring.

PWC is starting a local  
chapter and would like to  
hear from you if you are  
interested. Please leave  
your name at the Women's  
Liberation Center and someone  
will be in touch with you.

LEGAL.  
SURVIVAL

At the present time legal  
referral service is set up at  
the Women's Center such that  
a woman needing legal advice or  
a lawyer can be put in touch  
with one of the local legal  
services or a specific lawyer  
or law student depending on the  
legal problem.

It has been suggested that  
women need to know how to better  

establish an equalitarian relation-  

ship with a lawyer so they know  
what questions to ask, what is  
going on and how not to feel  
confused and paternalized.  
Another suggestion is that women  
need to understand more fully  
their legal rights - when it comes  
to property, marriage, arrest,  
jail, etc. Please let the Center  
know by phoning or writing what  
you want in the way of a legal  
survival course. Also what form  
should such a course take?
