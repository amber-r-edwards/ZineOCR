10 AWAKE & MOVE March 1971

Hearings on Consumer
Fraud in the Abortion business
last month sparked the begin-
nings of a nationwide abortion
referral and information service
which would be available to all
women seeking information about
abortions.

This step is being taken
by Clergy and Lay Advocates on
Abortion which currently operates
a nationwide counseling and infor-
mation service (Clergy Consulta-
tion Service) and The Pennsylvania
Abortion Rights Association (PARA)
along with other non-profit groups.

This action is a direct
result of the hearings during
which a need for widespread public
information was evident. More
than 25 witnesses testified before
the New York State Attorney
General about the outrageous and
often misleading practices of
commercial abortion agencies
which have sprung up in and around
New York and Philadelphia since
abortion was legalized in New York
State last July 1.

A former employee of a
profit-making agency testified that
the type of abortion needed was
determined on the telephone by
an agency employee with no medical
background. She also testified
that no pregnancy test was required.
The woman rarely knows how the total
cost is broken down among the agency,
the doctor, and hospital or clinic.
One witness called this fee splitting
which is illegal.

Mrs. Rose Berman - developer
of the Frank-Berman pregnancy test
warned that without a reliable
pregnancy test AND an examination
to establish pregnancy, women could
be seeking and getting abortions
when they are not pregnant. "A
positive test does not mean a
woman is pregnant and a negative
test does not mean she is not
pregnant," she said. "Abortion
referral services and abortion
clinics are practicing medicine
without a license," Mrs. Berman
added, which was an opinion
expressed by other witnesses.

Other witnesses raised ques-
tions about post-operative care.
Once a woman returns home, which
may be a considerable distance from
New York City, she has no recourse
to the hospital or clinic should
there be complications and must
find and pay for additional
medical services.

Many of the agencies make
profit-making arrangements on a "package plan"
as information centers they
in fact funnel women to one or
two hospitals or clinics according
to Phyllis Ryan of Pennsylvania
Abortion Rights Association (PARA).
Miss Ryan testified that many
agencies "psych" women into
believing they are pregnant and
should have an abortion scheduled
immediately.

Testimony from represent-
atives of non-profit referral
services (Planned Parenthood and
Clergy Consultation Services)
and former employees of profit-
oriented agencies indicate that
women who call the widely advertised
commercial agencies and request
information about the non-profit
information services are told they
do not exist.

Many witnesses felt that
a need for public information
and non-profit services is a
primary concern. "Regulation is
legitimization," said Susan
Reverby of Health Policy Advisory
Center (Health PAC), a New York
City-based organization.

Since the hearings several
abortion groups including PARA
and Clergy Consultation Service
which is also known as the Clergy
and Lay Advocates on Abortion
have met to begin working on a
non-profit abortion information
and referral clearing house which
would be foundation supported.

A former employee of a profit-making agency testified that she
was instructed to tell a woman -
only if asked - that the fee was
$16 when it actually started at
$60 and went up.

Although many of these
agencies advertise themselves
as information centers, they
in fact funnel women to one or
two hospitals or clinics.

If established, the clearing house
could have a toll-free area code
800 number for women across the
country to call and finances for
an extensive public information
campaign to counter the commercial
agencies.
