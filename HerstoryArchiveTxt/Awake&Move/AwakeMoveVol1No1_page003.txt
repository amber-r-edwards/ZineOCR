to each other as we sat in the  
midst of the audience. The  
atmosphere was threatening and  
we couldn't have an adequate  
discussion of how to proceed.  
The unity we felt when we  
entered the room was shattered  
and we reacted as individuals.  
Three of us sat in confusion,  
not knowing what the others were  
going to do (and thereby get  
us into), hoping HAL people  
would get up and start talking  
so we could take our lead from  
them.  

As the panel discussion  
drew to a close, the fourth  
woman felt the time was ripe and  
she got up, yelling "Excuse me,  
Excuse me." As three hundred  
heads turned, she began to speak  
about the oppressive atmosphere  
in the room - the oppressive  
professionalism, the lack of  
audience participation, the  
presence of people from the  
women's liberation movement and  
HAL who were in the audience but  
should be on the stage speaking.  
She introduced us as her sisters  
and asked us to stand. It  
happened so fast that we were  
paralyzed in our seats and she  
was left standing by herself as  
she went on rapping. In a minute  
or two, some people in the  
audience began applauding and  
the sound soothed our fears. We  
stood up, the moderator became  
more hostile ("You're talking  
about another kind of symposium,  
not the one we set up today"),  
and we began talking alongside  
our sister.  

Soon an older woman in the  
front row, shaking with rage,  
told us she had come to hear the  
one speaker and that we were  
disrupting the proceedings  
and should leave. Another older  
woman started pulling on the arm  
of one of us who was closest to  
the aisle. Someone went outside  
- perhaps to call the cops. After  
another exchange with the moderator  
we announced we were going to the  
lobby and wanted to rap with  
women out there. We also  
talked about the literature we  
had brought (Myth of the  
Vaginal Orgasm, Psychology  
Constructs the Female, and a  
fact sheet on the Women's  
Liberation Center) and urged  
women to get them from us.  

A couple of minutes after  
we left, the moderator  
announced a break (none was  
called for in the schedule)  
and women came into the lobby  
to rap with us. All were  
sympathetic or curious - the  
hostile ones stayed away. We  
talked about the format of the  
program and a little bit about  
the kind of work the women were  
into. We had left the literature  
in the car because we were afraid  
we would look suspicious walking  
into the session with it - so the  
rest of us stalled while one  
woman went back to the car.  

We still had no idea whether  
anyone had called the cops and  
we asked for support from the  
women around us.  

During the break, the  
moderator talked to several of  
us about having representatives  
from women's liberation and HAL  
on stage for the rest of the  
program. He appeared undecided  
but then talked to a woman who  
was in the audience as an  
invited professional but was  
also in a women's group. The  
woman gave him the impression  
that the worst was over and he  
should expect no more trouble  
from us. That decided it; the  
idea of putting us on the  
program was dropped.  

The third lecture began  
and people returned to hear it.  
Our literature arrived and we  
decided to distribute it as  
leaflets when women came out  
for lunch. We did that and  
rapped with a few more women.  
We sold general women's  
liberation literature to both  
men and women and got the  
names of several women who  
were particularly turned on.  
Several psychiatrists and  
psychologists asked HAL  
people to lunch to talk some  
more.  

We four women's liberation  
women went out to lunch together  
so we could unwind and evaluate  
our action. We talked about  
strategy - whether sending  
one representative from  
women's liberation and one from  
HAL onto the panel was legitimizing  
an authoritarian set-up  
(maybe once we got up there we  
could have demanded microphones  
in the audience, discussion  
groups, or whatever) and  
settling for token representation  
(why not demand that  
half the panelists be women  
and/or homosexuals); how you  
determine the best time for an  
action (the fourth woman had  
simply relied on her feelings  
that that was the right moment  
- and she had been correct);  
how you gauge the amount of  
support you can expect (some of  
the women in the audience  
appeared restless during the  
lectures and made comments to  
one another - but the content  
wasn't insulting enough that  
anyone came out openly with  
laughter, boos, or audible  
comments. It was a well-heeled  
professional audience and we  
tried to appeal to them through  
reason - We felt we would have  
been blocked if we had gone for  
the stage, and that few women  
would have joined us outside if  
the moderator hadn't called for  
a break at that time); how we  
were forced to rely only on  
ourselves (the sister who had  
played mediator between us and  
the moderator meant well but was  
trapped by her professional status  
- we could be more militant  
because we had to answer to no  
one there).  

We also talked about how  
we had reacted individually  
during the action - why our  
group started falling apart  
once we were in the room; why  
three of us hadn't supported  
the fourth woman immediately  
(whether or not we live with  
individual men, The Man is  
still there and we shuffle for  
his approval - When people  
started applauding, we got back  
enough strength to get off our  
asses and support her - Would  
we have done that without the  
applause? - Would the increasing  
hostility of the moderator and  
audience have divided or united  
us?); how difficult it was to  
arrive at an on-the-spot  
collective action. (In  
situations like the symposium  
- when it's impossible to  
discuss the next step with  
everyone else - we felt we  
have to be working with women  
we know and trust so that we  
function as one organism,  
with each person capable of  
acting with and for the group  
- We can't retreat because we  
are having an off-day when we  
are in a collective action.)  

Although some of us had  
to deal with guilt feelings  
about not supporting our  
sister sooner, our overall  
feeling was high. We had  
survived our first women's  
action and felt we had  
accomplished about as much as  
possible on a one-shot deal.  
We had taken the big step from  
talking with each other in  
living room discussions to  
dealing with some of the  
women waiting outside. We  
had tasted liberation; and the  
taste was heady and good.  

We will be more together  
next time.

newsstand =  

How can we reach a wide  
audience of women -- not just  
those who have already been  
turned on to the movement?  
Something visible, accessible,  
unthreatening to the uninitiated  
and very cheap. Something like a  
newsstand.  

A newsstand license is $5.  

A mercantile license is $3. That  
certainly qualifies as cheap.  

A newsstand can be located on  
any intersection that has no  
more than one other stand, and  
can measure no more than 28  
square feet. (Information from  
the Phila. Dept. of Licenses  
and Inspections.)  

The area that's being  
considered is on Walnut and  
Chestnut between Broad and 20th  
Street. The stand will be built  
by my household -- with a little  
help from our friends.  

And we need people who will  
contribute scrap lumber, will  
help staff the stand, will  
consider such questions as the  
stocking of the stand and the  
location, and will express faith  
and hope in the venture.  

Originally it seemed a good  
idea -- and even possible -- to  
open in time for the Christmas  
shopping rush. But on further  
consideration it seemed wiser  
to wait until spring because  
it will be easier to get the  
stand staffed, and because  
people are less apt to stop and  
rap in the cold.
