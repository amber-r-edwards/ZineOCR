New Woman Blues

Women in Academe

Pandora shrieked in fear when she saw me.  
I was never born, but by mistake, set free,  
From Earth I stole a woman's body.  

But too many lovers and whispering books  

Are plotting my life.  

The poisons I cook  

Will sweeten my kisses and lighten my looks.  

So take care, my friends.  

I am in disguise,  

And midnight is echoing my low, mad cries.

Natural  

From time to time, the Women's  
Liberation Movement is asked to  
take a position favoring or  
opposing Natural Childbirth and  
Breast Feeding. One particularly  
noteworthy argument in favor  
of non-medicated childbirth is the  
fact that in many cases, women  
feel that unnecessary anesthesia  
dulls the muscles and  
mind, thus rendering a woman  
inactive for a process that has  
great meaning and has traditionally  
required the intense participation  
of the mother. Certainly  
the convenience of doctors too  
often dooms frightened women to  
lonely hours in labor rooms.  

However, Women's Liberation  
can never incorporate natural  
childbirth and breast-feeding as  
policies for its followers since  
endorsement of acts concerned  
primarily with woman's identity  
as a sexual being can be dangerous.  
Also, an overemphasis on  
pregnancy and childbirth entrenches  
the common myth of instinctive,  
inevitable motherhood, as well as  
it weakens the movement's fight for  
good day care centers and abortion rights.  
The essential point in refusing  
to take dogmatic stands on  
childbirth and feeding methods  
is that our goals demand that  
society first see us as persons,  
not wives and mothers.  

Childbirth can be, and nearly  
always is, a thrilling and moving  
experience. It should be  
made meaningful without hysteria.  
Sure it is tempting to think of  
childbirth as creative, especially  
when women are denied so  
many chances at true creativity.  
But natural childbirth and  
breast-feeding have become status  
symbols of a sort, notably among  
young people. Status seeking  
works against freedom, and nothing  
is more important right now than  
giving people the right to choose.  

When my son was born pre-  
maturely and unable to suck, I  
was disappointed that I would  
not be able to nurse him.  
(Natural childbirth had been out  
of the question since, more often  
than not, special classes and  
doctors put the process out of  
financial reach of the poor,  
which I was).  

Kept from breast-feeding, I  
worried about my baby's obviously  
ruined little psyche. Didn't  
Margaret Ribble, the famous baby  

Mother  

doctor say: "Breast feeding is  
the first satisfaction a child  
gets from his mother after  
birth. This pleasure immediately  
begins to establish a focus on  
the mother and prepares the  
ground for the fostering of a  
continually closer relationship.  
For naturally breast-fed babies  
tend to have more trust and confi-  
dence in their mothers and are  
consequently easier to lead, train  
and direct."  

I find the previous statement  
upsetting, and even misleading.  
My bottle-fed son has grown up  
happy and healthy, and I am  
convinced that too much emphasis  
has been placed on feeding methods.  
Breast feeding is good if you like  
it. And bottle feeding is good,  
too, if you like it. And as my  

husband flops out of bed to give  

the baby his morning bottle I  
find I like it! I like it!  

Moving one baby step further,  
I mentally conducted a survey of  
babies I have met, gauging the  
friendliness and acceptance of  
other people in each child against  
the degree to which his mother is  
or is not "liberated" from the  
confining commandment of together-  
ness and resulting "momism."  
Eschewing prejudice, of course,  
I invariably find that most  
babies with hovering, overly  
solicitous mothers develop a  

strong emotional need for her  
presence, especially when a new  
room or a new person is presented.  
These babies scream and howl if  
their mothers leave the room.  
However, my child has never  
developed a frantic dependency  
on me, simply because a number  

of loving people care for him.  
He loves people and is delighted  
by visitors, accepting them without  
fear, willing to play. I'm  
not saying we don't have a secret  
understanding that "I'm the  
mother around here." But more  
importantly, we have a deeper  
understanding that we're all  
human beings around here, too.  

We do not live through, but  

with one another.  

A day-long regional confer-  
ence on Women in the Academic  
Community will be held at the  
University of Pennsylvania on  
Saturday, February 27, 1971.  
Participants in the conference  
will include academic women of  
all ranks: top administrators,  
professors, instructors, admin-  
istrative personnel, and stud-  
ents (both day and night school.)  

The conference program will  
include four speakers in the  
morning and a series of 19 to 15  
workshops in the afternoon.  

The speakers are:  

-- Dr. Erika Freeman, who  
will discuss the socialization  
of the female in America in  
contrast to some other national  
cultures. Dr. Freeman is a  
member of the New York Psycho-  
analytic Institute, Advisor to  
the UN Interregional Director  
for Youth Programs of the  
Developing Countries, and  
Consultant for the National

the Administration of Justice.  

-- Dr. Jo-Ann Gardner will  
speak on the formation of indep-  
endent women's caucuses within  
professional associations and  
will discuss the response of  
the associations to these  
caucuses. Dr. Gardner is the  
co-founder of the Professional  
Women's Caucus and was formerly  
Assistant Professor of Psych-  
ology at the University of  
Pittsburgh.

Provost of Sarah Lawrence  
College, will talk on new dir-

medical and biological views  

of women in the 19th century.  
Dr. Rosenberg is Research  
Assistant Professor of History  
and Lecturer in Psychiatry at  
the University of Pennsylvania.  

The afternoon workshops will  
embrace a broad range of sub-  
jects: history, sociology,  
psychology, psychiatry, liter-  
ature and genetics. In addition,  
such practical matters as women  
and medical care, continuing  
education, women's academic  
organizations and specific  
problems of the woman graduate  
and undergraduate student will  
be covered.  

Women at early planning  
sessions were from the Univer-  
sity of Pennsylvania, Temple  
University, Cornell University  
and the University of Maryland;  
Bryn Mawr, Swarthmore, Sarah  
Lawrence and Douglass Colleges.  
Some 600 women from these and  
other regional colleges are  
expected to attend.
