Angry women carrying  
Signs saying "ABORTION  
REFERRAL SERVICE EXPLOITS  
HUMAN NEEDS, STOP ABORTION  
PROFITEERING, UP AGAINST  
THE WALL A.R.S., marched into  
the Park City West at 3900  
Ford Road, decorated the  
Abortion Referral Service,  
and demanded to see Mark  
Fisher and Alan Lieberman.  
The women were protesting  
the male-dominated referral  
service which for a $25.00  
fee does what N.O.W. and  
Clergy Consultation do for  
free. Fisher and Lieberman  
had gone to New York for the  
day.

Flushed out of Fisher  

& Lieberman's expensive apart-  
ment on the 20th floor were  
two of their henchmen in anti-  
establishment dress, the one  
with dark curly hair the other  
with a ponytail. "Dig those  
clothes," one of the women  
said, "you ought to be wear-  
ing a three piece suit. That's  
where your head is at. You're  
a capitalist. Making money  
off women's bodies."

"Why pick on us?" asked  
Curly "when there're 300  
other guys doing the same  
thing."

"Why are your partners in  
New York?" demanded a woman.  
"Are you expanding your operation?" "Maybe you're setting  
up your own clinic?" another  

"Why pick on us?" asked  

Curly. "Clergy Consultation  
makes three times what we make."

"They're all using us," he  
continued, "Planned Parenthood too!"

They, Curly and Pigtail,  

claimed they were working 24  
hours a day, getting very  
little sleep. That it wasn't  
their business if women were  
willing to pay them $25.00 for  
the name of a doctor.

It was pointed out to them  
that this service of abortion  
referral was available free  
from Philadelphia N.O.W.  
(JE3-7474) and Clergy Consul-  
tation (WA3-5141). Both of  
these services have a 24 hour  
a day answering service.

"How about A.I.A.?" asked  
Curly, "Those guys are million-  
aires."

"Women are getting fed up  
with you guys making money off  
of our bodies. Don't give us  
this bullshit about how human-  
itarian you are."

Curly and Pigtail claimed  
that what they were doing was  
perfectly legal. That they  
could solicit for their service  
across state lines. They  
mentioned girls calling from  
Florida and North Carolina that  
week, to New York State it's okay.

The offices at the Park City  
West looked expensive and discreet.  
The 20th floor apartment very posh.  
Curly and his friend were leaving  
for Miami the next day.

The women left carrying their  

signs, waving their fists, and  
promising they'd be back soon.  
One of the angry women had  

been on WCAU-TV news the previous  
evening along with one of the men  

from the A.R.S.

In another action on November  
18, 1970 seven women visited A.R.S.  

They found that the office was  
being run by a woman volunteer.  
At that time A.R.S. stated that  
they had to charge $25.00 to  

medical subjects relating to  
their specific problems, for  
example, abortion, menopause  
and birth control, that the women at the meeting  

felt that the attitudes toward  
both female personnel and  
patients in medical institutions  
should be drastically changed.  
The group agreed that both  
short and long range goals  
should be set up.  

There was a strong feeling  

at the meeting that we should  
actually they could advertise free  
reach out and involve more women  
through Collegiate Press Service;  
especially since they claim those  
women using the service are  
primarily college women, and it  
is college women they are trying to  
reach. If you are interested, or if you  
know someone who would be interested,  
please get in touch with  

A.R.S. does not do any pre-  
abortion counseling nor any follow-  
up. Unless a woman visits the  
office the whole transaction is  
done by phone. Women are instruc-  
ted to send checks for $25.00  
after which they are called back  
and given a New York appointment.  

UP AGAINST THE WALL A.R.S.  

OLD SONGS  

Health Group  
Brainstorms  

A group of 35 women met at  
the Center early in December to  
discuss how women can get and  

control better health services.  
Many of the women are in the  
health field as community health  
workers, sociologists,  
and nursing students, medical  
writers, secretaries, and  
abortion rights workers.

Phyllis Ryan, of Penn-  
sylvania Abortion Rights  
Association, led the discussion.  
A brainstorming technique was  
used to find fresh and creative  
approaches to the health issues.  
The group suspended critical  
judgment of ideas and just  
"wished" out loud for changes  
they'd like to see. The first  
idea mentioned was "free health  
care." Each idea was written  
on a large tablet in front of  
the room to serve as a memory  
bank for the group; the wishing  
stopped when the wall was filled  
with lists of ideas.

The wishes were then broken  
into patterns and categories:  
(1) Sex education, birth control  
and abortion, (2) Maternity and  
prenatal care, (3) Mental health,  
(4) Community control, (5) Med-  
ical training, and (6) Humanizing  
institutions or services.

Small discussion groups  
developed from the large  
group to work on each of the  
above categories. The small  
groups are ongoing and have  
already met separately to  
discuss ideas and plan possible  
actions.

The myriad of wishes that  
filled the wall reflected the  

He sang me all the old songs:  
man is the hunter  
women want it too  
we're both adult aren't we?  
no one feels guilty anymore  
you want it as much as I do  
no one will ever know  

ALL the old songs I am so familiar with  
I could sing them with him.

You are woman. I am man.  
Me Tarzan. You Jane.  
Can't you see I'm dying?  
Lonely. In despair,  

Save me. Only you can,  

Light years, Light years  
Away from what I am  
And am becoming...

Sing me a new song;  
Or forget me.
