Bryn Mawr Cont. from pg. 7e

you really had a good faith
moment in your mind as a woman
and thought perhaps lying was
not the way to continue, it
would be very hard to hold on
to that moment," she says
explaining that all your
conditioning is against you,
Lesbians tend to fall into
the same power traps as their
heterosexual sisters. The
dominant submissive set-up is
just as likely, even when
outward appearance is not
exaggerated as in the butch.
This is not surprising when
the very air is full of
competitiveness and aggression
in reacting to another person.
Add to this the repression that
a secret life forces you into
and you have such an exagger-

ated condition that the possibil-

ities of what a woman loving a
woman could actually be in an
accepting society we cannot at
this moment even imagine.

"We are the outlaws of
society," says Sappho. No woman
can apply for a job in this
country as an acknowledged
lesbian. She has to protect
this life, she has to pass as a
heterosexual, if she wants to
eat. For this reason the most
visible of lesbians have the
least to lose, and do to a
large extent exaggerate this
situation and may even, and
goodness knows why not under
such repression, be mentally ill.

CAUTION:

Sappho feels that basically
men and women are different.

She said that some homosexuals
have thousands of sexual
contacts a year, while lesbians
are much more faithful to each
other. But her sisters on the
stage pointed out that this
could very well be socializ-
ation again. Women are brought
up to be faithful and trust-
worthy. Men are expected to be
unfaithful.

Lesbians are much more
independent as women. They
earn their own living, they
are more reliable, more respon-
sible. Nevertheless because
they are women they are still
paid less than men. They hold
this in common with their
hetero-sisters.

"One way to think of
lesbianism is as some kind of
an index of what is happening
in society. This is an indica-
tion that society is not able
to provide proper relationships,
totally open, totally free," she
says.

Women in the suburbs are
getting it together with each
other. This is not so
surprising when you consider
that many corporate men travel
for their companies from a
third to a half of each year and

that the lack of adult companion-

ship for long stretches can
drive anyone up the wall.

Then too there are far
too many women for the number
of men, as a result of the

NEVER WORK UNDER A CAR SUPPORTED ONLY BY A BUMPER JACK.
AVOID PLACING ANY PART OF YOUR BODY UNDER A JACKED-UP CAR ANY MORE THAN NECESSARY.

AVOID ROCKING, SHAKING, KICKING THE CAR.

YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE IN
THE TRUNK OF YOUR CAR:

A SPARE TIRE IN GOOD REPAIR.
A BUMPER JACK - ALL 4 PARTS

1. Bumper jack bottom sup-

port - a metal plate with

a hole in it.

2. Jack body - a T-shaped bar

with teeth on one side

and a curved plate which

moves up and down on
these teeth.

3. Jack claw - which hooks

under bumper.

4. Combination handle-wheel
nut wrench — an L-shaped
rod, the angled end con-
taining a nut socket and
the straight end chisel-
shaped.

Also:
FLARES (THIRTY MINUTE)
FLASHLIGHT

Something to serve as
WHEEL BLOCKS, e.g. bricks.

WHEN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A
FLAT, turn on your emer-
gency flashers and drive
slowly until you can find a
level place well off the road
to park the car.

PULL HAND BRAKE UP TIGHT.

thirty years' war. Are a large
percentage of women then

supposed to live lonely isolated

lives simply because American
society only recognizes hetero-
married-nearly the same age
couples locked in the nuclear
family?

Mallory has chosen not to
marry but to live in a nuclear
family. Her mid-western hangups as she
might like us to think. Psyche
is a creative person, careful
of self, who may have chosen to
live alone. Sappho has warmth,
companionship and love. But

all of these women have to deal
with power.
Power is the snake

in the garden of Eden, the
disease of patriarchy, the
conditioning all women have
had and it will take lots and
lots of consciousness raising
to come to know where we are.
Choice too is problematical
when there are so few choices.
