MOORESTOWN  
CONFERENCE  

A day long Women's Libera-  
tion Conference was held in  
Moorestown, New Jersey on No-  
vember 14, 1970 from 9:30  
until 5:00 p.m. with well over  
a hundred women attending.  

Organized for the purpose  
of introducing South Jersey  
women to the movement and to  
each other, the conference  
began with women breaking up  
into small groups for cons-  
ciousness-raising.  

Sympathetic men took care  
of the child care side of the  
conference leaving the women  
free to explore their lack  
of liberation. Some groups  
got so involved that they  
talked right through their  
lunch period and only broke  
up for the skits that brought  
all the groups together.  

For those who did get  
lunch there were free coffee,  
doughnuts, and orange drink  
with the women bringing a  
box lunch.  

There was only one dis-  
sident note in the day.  

This was caused by a group  
of eight members from the  
“Socialist Workers Party  
who set up their table of  
literature in the basement  
of the First Baptist Church  
against the wishes of the  
Women's Liberation Center  
and who spent most of the  
day proselytizing women to  
become members of the YSA  
rather than keeping to the  
spirit of free inquiry which  
the conference was supposed  
to be promoting.  

The skit dealt with the  
problems of being a woman  
and having a brain.  
"You're very bright, why don't  
you study to be a nurse," on  
down to marriage and a male  
chauvinist's night on the  
town without her (who would  
take care of the baby?) which  
he will make all better with  
sex though he's probably not  
up to it, and she's not having  
any anyway. The Media collect-  
ive filmed and taped this one as  
their first effort.  

The group then broke up  
into interest groups on such  
topics as Abortion and Medi-  
cal Care, Welfare, Alternative  
Lifestyles, Nuclear Family and  
Our Children, Women in Poli-  
tics, Sexism and Racism, and  
Homosexuality.  

Sexism and Racism started  
out with a general discussion  
of the roles women and black  
people play in this society and  
how these roles can be changed.  
Also what kinds of options do  
middle class women have that  
other women do not have.  

Two black women in the  
group ran down their feelings  
on women's liberation and  
pointed out that because black  
women suffer from a triple  
oppression: class, race and sex  
that the nature of the struggle  
for them is going to be differ-  
ent from white middle class  
women.  

The Alternative Lifestyle  
workshop had a mixture of ages,  
some older, young married,  
single, and high school women;  
about twenty women in all. Se-  
veral women began talking about  
their decisions for group li-  
ving arrangements and how these  
had come about. They spoke of  
the problems involved in find-  
ing a house suitable for the  
number of people in the family;  
financial arrangements; house-  
keeping chores; handling con-  
flicts that seem to come up  
between members of the house-  
hold.  

Four or five other women  
had had some experience with  
group living arrangements of  
some sort in Boston, Camden and  
several other South Jersey com-  
munities. The general feeling  
of the group was that communal  
living provided opportunities  
in which people could reor-  
ganize roles for men and women,  
distribute child care res-  
ponsibilities, eliminate un-  
necessary expenditures involved  
in traditional one-family, one-  
house set-ups.  

There were questions and  
needs which women's libera-  
tion groups might fill: How  
does a woman get in touch with  
other women of similar poli-  
tical beliefs, who are also  
interested in setting up a  
communal living in a commun-  
ity? This is a problem parti-  
cularly for women in a subur-  
ban group or those not attach-  
ed to an active group. How  
does a woman avoid getting into  
a bad situation? The problem  
remains.  

The workshop on Homo-  
sexuality talked mainly about  
monogamous relationships,  
whether between straight or gay  
people, versus group relation-  
ships such as Radical Les-  
bians. The women talked about  
both pitfalls, jealousy,  
divisiveness, lack of depth of  
multiple relationships and the  
creative possibilities (devel-  
oping a new group consciousness,  
interdependence of many people,  
lack of dependence on one person).  

The Philadelphia Women's  
Center plans to invite Radical  
Lesbians from New York to one  
of their Forums so that all  
women can explore this issue  
further.  

The Political workshop  
was both in and out of the es-  
tablishment. One of the women  
was a Democratic committee  
woman; one had been in all the  
protests and felt that really  
a lot had been accomplished.  

For example, Johnson had resigned.  

The women wondered whether  
there was any response from the  
monolithic government.  
Discussion revolved around rep-  
pression and how very subtle it  
has become.  

Some dis-  

In this workshop, as well  
as probably in others, each woman  
gave her own ideas, in this case  
what it meant to be political,  
as they all sat around the table.  
Political could mean in the kit-  
chen. Who's going to get supper?  
The politics of the family. Or  
it could be national. Do women  
need a party of their own?  

The conference ended with a  
large group meeting that inclu-  
ded announcements about the  
Center, formation of new groups  
and with the group singing  
women's liberation songs. This  
part of the program was taped  
too. It was a good day.  

lib? or liberation?  

jennie bull, baltimore  
reprinted from Women, A Journal  
of Liberation, fall 1970  

I'd like to point out some-  
thing that women in Washington  
corrected me on. We have been  
talking about Women's Lib for  
some time now, as shorthand for  
Women's Liberation, and I would  
like to argue strongly for our  
stopping use of the term and  
using the full word --Liberation.  
Here's why. The press and those  
unsympathetic or simply ignorant  
of Women's Liberation almost  
always use "lib" in a way that  
ends up degrading and making  
light of our cause--a problem we  
have always had. Such phrases as  
"lib ladies" or "Libbies" are  
not uncommon now, and do a real  
disservice to our movement.  
Also, use of "lib" reflects our  
own tendency as women not to  
take ourselves seriously, and  
our liberation seriously. Have  
you ever heard the term "Black  
lib"? You bet not! I suggest  

that we not only erase "Lib"  
from our vocabulary, but challenge  
others who use the term. Right on  
for liberation!  

typewriter  

Awake and Move is desperately  
in need of a typewriter of our  
very own. For this first issue  
we were lucky enough to borrow  
one from a very generous sister,  
but she needs it, and we really  
need one of our own which will be  
available for the newspaper  
collective all the time.  

Because of the nature of  
offset printing we need to buy  
an electric, carbon ribbon  
typewriter (typing copy is soooo  
much cheaper than paying for  
typesetting). And we need bread.  
If everyone who reads this sends  
a dollar to Awake & Move, type-  
writer fund, we can get it.
