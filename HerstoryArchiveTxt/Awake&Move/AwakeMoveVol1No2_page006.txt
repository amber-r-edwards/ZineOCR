BRYN MAWR
FORUM

Bits and pieces of the
Bryn Mawr forum on Nov. 25
come floating back into the
mind...

"Evolution, revolution or
whatever is going to happen,"
Kate Millet tells a self-
declared Marxist socialist
male, "we want to be included
as women, and also as women
who are aware of the fact
that the stereotype we're put
in is very dangerous, very
hostile, very crude and very
insulting for men and women.
And we want to make sure that
(at the end of the revolution)
someone from the SDS doesn't
get up and thank us very much
for our help and send us back
to the kitchen."

"For our help," echoes
Mallory, Kate's sister, "for
our HELP!" Such incredible
male chauvinism.

Kate has a good grasp on
what Women's Liberation is all
about. She sees that women
have to be first in the
revolution. That they must
avoid at all costs being co-
opted by anyone, by any other
party or political movement.
This time women are the
revolution. And what men
have to come to realize is
that until women are truly
free, no man, black, white or
third world will be free.

"I know very well," 
continues Kate, "the
Socialists are not as concerned
with us as we are. They put us
second, third, fourth, fifth,
and sixth, and until there was
a Woman's Liberation they
didn't give much of a good
Goddam about our situation.

But there was always a big
role to talk about." A lot of
newspapers on the left are
covering Women's Liberation,
but says Kate, "It's because
WE ARE AROUND, not because guys
who run the Left thought it up
for us. They don't give a
dam for us and we're
aware of this."

"Yes! Four years ago
where were they?" asks Mallory.

The forum has been billed
as one on Deviance and Deviants
from the norm. Sitting on the
stage are Mallory, a divorced
woman with a child, who has not
been down the analysis trail,
Psyche, a divorced childless
woman who has been, and Sappho,
who is single, a lesbian and
proud of it, and feels as though
by sheer luck and late sexual
awakening, she has avoided the
all-American-dream-trap of
husband, children and twenty
years of your life down the
drain.

"I wonder," says Sappho,
"how much of our mothers' lives
we are now living out; not
necessarily as lesbians but as
we are now having independent
lives for ourselves as women.
My mother worked very hard at
being a mother and on one level
was always getting me ready to
be a wife and mother. Yet on
another level another message
was leaking through."

"She would stare out the
window, or she would say
‘What am I doing here? Why
didn't I become a teacher?!'
Sappho's mother was truly
trapped, Mallory's generation
and Psyche's did not have the
strength to stay out of marriage
but did have the courage to get
out of it again saving them-
selves from alcoholism, nervous
breakdowns and madness.
Sappho's generation has the
courage and insight not to get
into marriage as it now exists;
a power structure of the
patriarchy. A power game where
women always lose, because the
cards are marked, the wheel is
fixed.

Mallory being the intel-
ligent woman she is, tried to
work out a more equitable
arrangement with her husband.
She could see how other
marriages were and didn't want
that for herself or for him.
But society, those around her,
saw the roles: the male, the
provider; the female, the wife
and mother, and saw nothing
else. The patriarchy is after
all over 5,000 years old and
we are all programmed. And
Mallory was that phenomenon of
modern life, a corporate wife;
a woman expected to play the
role of helpmate to her man to

In the film 2001, director
Stanley Kubrick depicts a space-
ship with a crew of six men and a
supercilious computer in a "space
odyssey" toward the boundaries of
the galaxy. Unrealistic? Tech-
nically, perhaps not, but social-
ly, highly unlikely. In a society
with the advanced technology that
Arthur Clarke and Kubrick envis-
ion, 2001 will have, half the crew
in such a spaceship would neces-
sarily be women. Necessarily.
Not superfluously or decoratively.
It is obvious that the education
and superior brainpower of women
would have to be more frequently
tapped in such a complex culture.
So it is erroneous as well as i-
ronic that in 2001, women are
still seen primarily as house-
wives and stewardesses. Apparent-
ly the male creators of the movie
foresee little change in the status
of women as subservient to men.
I don't believe this was an en-
tirely unconscious oversight.

There is a growing male wish to
keep woman confined within a prim-
itive, biological role which she
has finally overcome via education
and birth control. This reaction-
ary male attitude may be another
symptom of what author Alvin Toff-
ler calls "future shock," and may
also be of a desperate, well-
meaning nature. However, women
are being turned away from the
plans for the future without be-
ing given a choice. The pace is
too hectic, males assure us, the
rat race is now jet propelled. To
women has fallen the sole respon-
sibility of maintaining love, se-
renity and humanity. Thus separa-
ted and delegated by sex, the bur-
dens of the future are made heav-
ier. This dangerous and unfair
division of labor has caused such
various cultural reactions as
widespread cinematic sex, the near
epidemic of male heart attacks,
and the rise of militant feminism.
As a result we are all facing the
future with dread instead of en-
thusiasm.

The phrase "Brave New World"
strikes terror into our hearts.
But why? Is it because we fear
and hate any society where people
are arbitrarily classified at
birth as inferior, as worthy of
only menial work? How? Blacks,
Mexicans and Indians have had
myths of “innate racial inferiori-
ty drilled into them for years,
with society's blessing. Do we
fear a soma-addicted population
of quiet, blissful idiots? Per-
haps this is getting closer. In-
telligent people have always prized
the search for meaning in life
above unquestioning content--but
even so, our modern culture has
an overwhelming number of people
who are hooked on materialism and
the "art" of advertising. In
justification of favorite adver-
tisements, many people cite the
