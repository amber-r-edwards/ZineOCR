woman’s  
radio show  
OR  

who doth  
have  
control ?  

These comments come as a re-  
sult of my listening to a recent  
panel discussion on Women's Lib-  
eration on WIFI radio, Sunday,  
December 6, 8:00 to 9:00 a.m.  
Present representing Phila.  
Women's Liberation were two  
Sisters from Phila. and a  
brother from the Phila. Men's  
Liberation group. Throughout  
the hour-long show the Women's  
Liberation people covered  
many of the various areas of  
the movement and much information  
was reviewed for the listener.  
Direct connection was made  
between the goals of the  
Women's movement and the need  
to reorder society's value  
structure. Much emphasis was  
put on the dehumanization of  
people in a capitalistic,  
profit-motivated society with  
many examples and facts used.  

I would like to raise the  
following points in order that  

I “more honestly look at  
how we could better control  
our contacts with the media and  
develop new ways of getting our  
ideas across to people.  

-- Considering a history  
of negative experiences on  
radio and TV involving Women  
Liberationists and male moder-  

ators, I question what effort  

was made to have a woman moder-  
ator.  

-- Initially it appeared  
that women had 50% of the  
representation, but as the  
program proceeded a third male  
voice could be heard making  
comments and asking questions  
as if there existed two moder-  
ators. I don't believe the  
second voice ever got introduced  

but he obviously took the same  
role as the moderator. Having  
later asked one of the women  
about the male voice, I was told  
that he was a technician who had  
been in the studio and had asked  
permission of the moderator to  
be able to make comments during  
the taping. This resulted in  
having a show which was male-  
dominated numerically.  

-- It was very pretentious  
of the moderator to pretend to  
know how the masses think. To  

a woman before the show was  
taped he had commented that he  
would be speaking for "dumb  

Joe public," which is an in-  
dication of his feelings for his  
fellow women. Do we want to be  
in the position of raising his  
(moderator's) consciousness  
during show time or should  

that have happened before the  
show at which time we can  
better judge his receptiveness  
to our ideas?  

-- At times it seemed to the  
listener that the women's liber-  
ation people were trapped into  
arguing with or out-debating the  
moderator,  

-- The moderator's refer-  
ences to, and questions about,  
the women's personal lives were  
not directed in such a way that  
one would be convinced that he  
wanted to look critically at his  
own lifestyle and question what  
the women's movement would mean  
to it. He projected a sense of  
doubt as to the ability of the  
Women's movement to free people  
at all.  

-- Since our movement is  

about the business of quest-  
ioning the sick roles society  
puts us in, it would seem a  
contradiction to allow our-  
selves to be answering male  
stereotype questions from a  
moderator who is acting out one  
of those roles; i.e., devil's  
advocate,  

-- Finally, no time was  
given to explaining to an almost  
total Philadelphia audience what  
was going on locally. No matter  
what format we have to be able  
to make people aware of the con-  
crete activities and projects  
which are available to them.  

The tape of this show is  
available for listening by call-  
ing the Women's Center: Wa3-8330.  

~ GROUPS...  

Consciousness-raising as the  
primary purpose of women meeting  
with other women has been for  
many Philadelphia groups a  
comforting and successful  
project. Other groups how-  
ever, are beginning to feel  
a desire for action. Because  
“consciousness-raising" implies  
a heightened consciousness of  
other women and the realization  
of shared burdens, constructive  
action must be viewed as an  
important fulfillment of the  
process. One consciousness-  
raising group which has moved  
to action is the Monday Night  
West Phila. Group. The women  
in this group, which has been  
together since last April,  
feel that action has strength-  
ened their group solidarity.  
"One of the reasons we feel we  
have survived longer than many  
other groups formed at that  
time, is that we have begun to  
concentrate on action rather  
than pure consciousness  
raising. While the conscious-  
ness-raising was very successful  
and important in establishing  
our identity as a group, it  
began to lose direction,  
becoming occasionally boring  
and occasionally half-assed  
psychonalysis. We decided we  
would become an action-orien-  
ted group, accepting new  
members and integrating  
consciousness raising into  
our meetings so that it would  
be a tool rather than an end  
in itself."  

Any consciousness-raising  
group which has been foundering  
lately and/or feels the threat  
of stagnation should contact  
the Women's Center. There are  
many activities and jobs to  
be done, from typing to marching.  
The Women's Liberation Movement  
cannot survive without women  
who are willing to reach out and  
help other women in their  
battle for equality.  

Members of the Anthropology  
Study Group spoke at West  
Chester State College on Women's  
Liberation from sociological and  
anthropological viewpoints.  

They are currently working on a  
pamphlet.  

Phyllis Ryan of Pennsylvania  
Abortion Rights Association  
(PARA) foresees an interesting  
situation in the months ahead  
as the liberal New York abortion  
laws face even tougher opponents  
than those who fought against —  
their passage. By passing strict  
residency requirements, New  
York may act to severely  
restrict the number of out-  
of-state women who can obtain  
abortions through New York  
hospitals. Thus what seems to  
be (and will be for many women)  
a tragic setback, might be  
turned into useful pressure  
on Pennsylvania to abolish  
abortion laws. Although  
Milton Shapp has spoken  
against abortion, he has not  
done so with the fervor of  
his November opponent, Ray  
Broderick. Also, his wife  
has privately admitted her  
feelings, run strongly in  
favor of abortions as a  
personal decision of individual  
women.  

Several Philadelphia  
Women's Liberation groups  
have initiated reading and  
discussion meetings. The  
women choose one book, essay  
or article (primarily anthro-  
pological and sociological  
writings), read it, and  
evaluate it in a critical  
discussion. Sometimes a  
paper is planned, or a group  
book review. If your group  
would like to do something  
like this, some literature  
may be obtained from the  
Women's Center. Obtaining  
pamphlets at the Center has  
the double advantage of  
helping support the Center  
(which operates on a nearly  
bankrupt basis sometimes),  
and assures you of enough  
copies to go around. Most  
of the literature is cheap  
(in fiscal terms) and  
valuable (in terms of theory).  
Also, if the women in a group  
do write an evaluation or  
book review, Awake & Move  
will be willing to consider  
it for publication.  

If your group has been  
active lately, or would like  
to publicize any event it has  
planned, or just needs new  
members, Awake & Move plans  
to publish a monthly column  
devoted to group activities  
which may be able to help  
you. We would like to hear  
from all groups, since aware-  
ness of what women are doing
