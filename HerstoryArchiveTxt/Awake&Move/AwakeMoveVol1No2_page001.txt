At long last, we have a home,  
sisters -- a place to be together  
in, a place to be alone in. It's  
been amazing to watch the differ-  
ence in the kinds of things that  
have happened already and to con-  
trast them with the feelings and  
atmosphere at 928 Chestnut.  

March 8th is a day for  
all women everywhere. Together  
we will commemorate our struggle  
to the present and consider the  
long road toward future libera-  
tion.  

International Women's Day  
originated in this country and  
has gone almost unnoticed for  
years. On March 8th, 1857  
women garment-textile workers  
marched in New York to protest  
their 12-hour day; miniscule  
salaries and poor working  
conditions. As they moved from  
their poor living area into the  
more affluent part of the city,  
police broke up the march,  
arrested many of the women and  
in the ensuing chaos, some of  
the women were trampled.  

In March of 1860 the  
women garment-textile workers  
formed their first union. Forty-  
eight years later on March 8,  
1908 thousands of women from the  
needle trades industry marched  
again in New York. In sixty-one  
years they had not moved very far:  
the demands were the same, shorter  
hours, an end to child labor and  
the right to vote. In 1910 Clara  
Zetkin, a German Socialist leader  
asked the Second International to  
recognize March 8th as Inter-  
national Women's Day to  
honor the struggles of these  
women. Her resolution was  
enthusiastically approved.  

Philadelphia Women’s Liberation Center  

We are now at 4634 CHESTER  
AVENUE, (19143); SA 7-1717. Two  
women are already living on the  
third floor of the center, and  
there's space for at least one  
more. Facilities include: huge,  
old-fashioned high-ceilinged  
rooms, fireplaces on each floor,  
a large meeting room complete  
with window seats, stained glass  
windows and fireplace, ample space  
for AWAKE AND MOVE, THROUGH THE  
LOOKING GLASS; meetings of small  
groups, places to sit and read, a  
library, an office, and a fourth  
floor dormer room in which to sit  

and do absolutely nothing but think.  

Rent: $200/month; utilities  
will probably come to about an-  
other $60 or $70 each month. The  
women who live in the center will  

pay rent based on their ability to  

pay, but additional funding is nec-  

essary from the Center.  

The place is ours, its possi-  
bilities seem almost limitless.  
Day care, free clinics, room for  

women to meet, classes, etc.  
happen. People have already  
started to gather in the house,  
working together on it. Every-  
one is welcome to drop in any  
time, to come prepared to talk,  
scrub, paint, to just be there.  
Call before you come to make cer-  
tain the place is staffed.  

We need a great many things  
to make the house more comforta-  
ble: chairs (soft as opposed to  
straightbacks), rugs, shelves, a  
couch or two, beds or mattresses.  
How about a wall mural painted by  
some sisters? You can give what  
you think we need. Note--the kit-  
chen is well stocked with dishes,  
etc. already.  

If your group would like to  
meet at the center, give us a  
call. If you need a place to  
be, sisters to talk with, a  
place to read, literature, com-  
pany, a wall to paint, a sense  
of being involved with other  
people COME BY AND SEE US SOME-  
TIME. ALL SISTERS ARE WELCOME,  

can  

pay and no training.  
If a woman does not venture into  
the work world, she is iso-  
lated and performs free  

labor as a support for the  
corporate structure. Many  
women are heads of house-  
holds and suffer doubly under  
the inferior salary-job roles  
and are now organizing through  
welfare rights to fight a  
system that gives corporations  
millions and calls it subsi-  
dies, but gives women and  
children pennies and calls  

it charity. Women are  
discriminated against in  
health matters, particularly  
in terms of information  

about birth control and  

Women are now  
arguing that health care is  

a right for all, not just  
the rich who can afford it.  
Only a system based  

on meeting human needs rather  

than creating enormous profits  
for a few will change the  
status of women. Fulfillment  
of these needs is being  
denied us.  

When women come out of  
their isolation, combat divis-  
iveness perpetuated by compet-  
ition for male protection and  
support, then, we will begin to  
come together, then we can  
achieve full status as human  
beings.

On March 8th, 1917 women  
textile workers in Petrograd struck  
against the overlong bread lines,  
living and working conditions.  

Although International  
Women's Day has been celebrated in  
many countries all over the world,  
observance had lagged in the  
United States until last year.  

The emergence of the Women's  
Liberation Movement has focused  
our attention once again on the  
struggle of all women. We see  

the problem beginning with the  
socialization of the small child,  
progressing to the woman at work  
with inferior job status, inferior  

health care, and lack of access to  
information.
