A WOMAN'S

PLACE

A woman's place is not in the
home. Does that shock you? It
shocked me when I wrote it.
Women's work is not housework
and it is not raising children.
Women's work is in the world -
out there - and it is time they
got on with it. It is time we
got on with it. It is time I
got on with it. Housework is
shit work. I sit here at my
typewriter having just finished
some, having more to do, and
being able to turn around and
do it all over again in another

waste of energy,
“CO pouring Pies”

working for the movement,
working for other women and for

myself. Start evaluating house-
work. Does that sink really have

to be washed? Does that rug really

have to be cleaned? Do those
clothes really have to be ironed?
Why? Why? Why? Keep asking your-
self. Why? You've got a lot of
brainwashing to examine. Do you
really have to wash your hair?
Put on that make-up? Now?
Today? Why?

I'm not advocating impetigo
and staph. But sterility is
not necessary in the home.

Who made you a mother? A
man? Why isn't he watching
the children? How would he like
to take them to work with him?
In his office, his truck, his
ditch, his store. I'm sure that
childcare centers would spring
up like mushrooms if men were
left with children. We would
have no end of federal, state
and local funds; they might
even divert some from the

police, and other such
important areas. Think about
that.

There's a good possibility
that you are working too. Right.
An eight hour day plus another
one at home. What is he doing?
After work? Is he tired, poor
dear? Does he have his feet
up and is he reading the
paper? What are you doing?

Are you sitting in front of
the TV with a drink in your
hand? Who's getting supper?
The kids? Or are you all
going to starve tonight? Hey.

There's an idea, why not?

Or maybe you're head of the
household as the income tax
puts it. And you're working
at a low pay job, or were

you lucky and it's high but

not as much, is it, as the guy
you're working alongside of

by maybe $3,000 or is that

too low an estimate? And
you've got custody of the
children. Yes you do and
you've learned over the years
that you've got to work
because "support" is a misnomer

and you couldn't support a cat

let alone children on what the
state says is necessary. And
he fights paying even that.
Right? Did you ever ask your-
self why when everything seems
turned against women, employment,
low pay, last hired first fired,
laws against what you can and
can't do with your body, no
provision at all for handling
children, that the state gave
you custody of the children?
What is the state, the patri-
archy up to anyway? And he got
married again, right? So his
first allegiance is to his now
wife and any children from that
marriage. Any lawyer will tell
you that. For allegiance spells
MONEY.

Ask yourself who wants
to work? Is it your ex or
the state? Does the state see
you as a freebie? You are taking
all the cost of raising your
children off the state, paying
babysitters, rent, food,
clothes, a good consumer. Split
up a family and now we have two
households consuming twice as
much although your low salary of
course won't consume quite as
much. Is this why divorce is now
condoned or at least allowed?
There is a dangerous situation
here between the state and
divorced women. Divorced women
know what it is to be outsiders.
They are not benefiting from
corporations. They have no
vested interests in this society.

The outcasts in any society,
the pariahs, the ignored or
despised are the dangerous ones.
They are oppressed and they know
it. Since they get little out
of society they have no interest

in seeing it continue and a good
bit of interest in seeing it
modified or destroyed.

There are many ways to destroy
and not all of them are violent.
Evaluating what you really need
and not what you are programmed
to need is one of them. Some
can be classified as necessities -
such as a vacuum cleaner. Of
course if you did not have rugs,

a push broom and mop would do as
well and take less time.

Think about what you bought
last week. What could you have
done without? Cosmetics, clothes
consume an inordinate amount of
energy. Ask yourself why? Who
said you had to dress this way?
Corporate profit-makers? Why
are you so insecure? Why do
we live in a materialistic
society?

Because while it's true that
millions are spent on advertising
and that all this plays into the
corporations' hands there has to
be a counter-cooperation to have
this work. We have seen when it
doesn't work, with the Edsel
and the midi.

So how come? Have you ever
noticed that when you really
wanted or thought you wanted some-
thing that you waited and maybe
even saved for, that there is
a momentary glow, a kind of
happiness, maybe for an hour or
even a day, but it doesn't last.
The object loses its charisma
and it becomes what it always
was, a dress, a tape recorder,

a car, a hat, a guitar.

Because despite what B.B.
King says about "Lucille"
objects are not flesh and blood,
they don't give you a day-to-day
emotional support, or prop up
your ego. Only other humans can
do that.

Only in our society they don't.
We are all isolated from one
another, confined in our own
electric kitchens with our own
children and our own house or
apartment, suspicious, if we are
married, of other women; in
competition for the male if we
are not married. Non-supportive
of each other in a way that men
never are.

Men do support each other.

It may be a dog eat dog world but
it's also a dog help dog. A man
moves up and takes his buddy right
along with him. When a man is
threatened by a woman, men close
ranks. Watch what happens

during a divorce. See how many
friends the woman has then who"
