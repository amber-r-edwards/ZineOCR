Plans are developing for  
a Center City office on Ritten-  
house Square. We have an office  
which is nice for the unbelievable  
price of $10.00 a month.  
Plans for it presently are to  
have it open for several hours  
during the middle of weekdays,  
like 10 to 4. To begin with  
it will function as a place for  
Center City women to come by,  
get literature, rap, bring lunch  
and have a quiet place to relax.  
And we'll see where it goes from  
here. Women are needed to staff.  
If you have part of a day you  
could help, it would be really  
good. It would also be good to  
be able to plan on a regular basis,  
like two hours on the same day  
every week. If you want to get  
involved in setting it up and  
staffing call Gina Oboler -
