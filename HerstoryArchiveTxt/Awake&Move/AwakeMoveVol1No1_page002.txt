support her. See what happens

to her if she has the guts to
buck her boss (a male). Men

will lie to protect each other;
witness how doctors protect their
own sex in the medical societies
even though some doctors may be
drunken slobs and murderers.

In support and trust there
is strength. Women are just
beginning to learn this. Women
too have to learn to close ranks
to support and protect each other.
Women are a class, as men are.
They are not the same class; they
do not have the same interests
as men, and they will have to learn
to separate themselves from men
and learn who they are and what
they want. Not what someone
(male) wants for them.

This is more likely to happen
when women, you and me, know that
a woman's place is not in the
home, or with the children, or
doing the housekeeping jobs
of industry. It is doing real
work in a real world. Working
in real politics. Working for
what really matters to women.
Now.

ZAP 1

I participated in my first
women's gap action today, and I
want to share with you some of
the thoughts and feelings that
are swirling around inside me
now.

Several days ago some women
at the Women's Liberation Center

College of Pennsylvania
(formerly Women's Medical College)
on the Psychodynamics of Human
Sexuality - consisting of five
lectures on: The Implications

of Masters & Johnson's Studies,
Recent Studies in Homosexuality,
Newer Aspects of Sex Education,
Studies in Frigidity and Impotency
and the Relationship Between
Women's Sexual and Maternal
Functions - all conducted by

male psychiatrists and psychologists -
geared to professionals -
all made possible by a grant from
a pharmaceutical company.

Members of the Homophile Action
League (HAL) were already planning
to go together and ask pointed
questions to the speaker on homo-
sexuality. Several of us women's
liberationists decided the sympo-
sium was ripe for (and deserving
of) a women's action, too.

Half a dozen women met the
day before the symposium to map
out strategy. After weighing
several possible actions in a
vacuum of information about the
speakers and audience, it was
decided that four of us would go
and play it pretty much by ear.
Because we were thinking about
a militant action, we agreed to
wait until people from HAL had
asked questions; but we were not
sure what form our action would
take after that.

We wanted to secure seats
right in the front so that
when we began to talk, we could
turn our backs on the speakers
and face the women in the
audience. The next morning,
however, we arrived too late

to do that and found seats
together two-thirds of the way back.
One woman from HAL sat with us;
the rest of the HAL members sat
together in another part of the

room.

The symposium was set up
like an authoritarian class-
room. Three hundred people
(about half women, half men)
sat in rows facing the six
male "teachers!" The brother-
hood was out in force - the
brotherhood of men talking
at, for and down to women,
the brotherhood of profession-
als talking at, for and down
to lower rank professionals
and nonprofessional human
beings. There were no micro-
phones in the audience.

One man on the stage would
make his presentation and
each man on the panel would
put in his two bits of
glittering generalities.
Then they would go on to the
next lecture.

The man commenting on
Masters & Johnson's work was
much more liberal than I
expected. He gave a straight-
forward review of their find-
ings on the myth of the
vaginal orgasm but didn't
explore why facts about
women's sexuality have been
obscured for so long - well,
they're out now, he seemed to
say, and that's scientific
progress. A few points stand
out in my mind -

joking putdowns of the
women's liberation
movement were used

in his criticism of
Masters & Johnson's
lack of data justifying
their contention that

a female-male team
should treat couples
with sexual problems
(how long do you have
to study? Shall we set
up more commissions?)

his statement that

sending a teenage boy

to a prostitute was

a good method of sex
education (this assumes
the boy will then become
the teacher when he has
sex with women - which
will probably be true

as long as we are denied
knowledge about our own
bodies - and it also
exploits women prostitutes
- which sent me into a
whole head trip about
political prisoners.

The four main reasons why
women are in prison -

for theft, alcohol and
drug crimes, prostitution,
and, as young women, for
running away from their
families - strike me as
products of a sick society
which is not serving human
needs.

I felt so angry as each of
these things were said that I
wanted to walk up on stage,
take the mic, and begin
rapping. What held me back
was our agreement to wait
until HAL people made their
move after the second lecture.

The studies cited and the
points made in the second
lecture were so obscure that
it was difficult to remember —
the topic was homosexuality.
I had a hard time focusing
my attention long enough to
verify that the speaker's
basic assumption was: homo-
sexuality is a disorder in the
normal sequence of psychosexual
development. End quote.
Cultural relativity meant
nothing (tell that to the Greeks
who accepted and openly practiced
homosexuality hundreds of years
ago - and to people in dozens of
other cultures who don't
differentiate female-male roles
as rigidly as we do.)

To substantiate his argument,
the speaker cited studies on
the effect of different levels
of androgen on gender differ-
entiation. He spoke about the
"female first" principle - all
human fetuses begin as females
but, if the amount of androgen
is raised to a sufficient level,
the fetus will become male. At
this point, I was so bored,
frustrated and hostile that I
felt like putting androgen-
suppressants in the water supply -
Yea Women!) Male homosexuals
have too little androgen, which
causes them to prefer men as
sexual partners, the learned
doctor maintained; and he
drew a correlation between high
levels of androgen and high
intelligence.

The doctor seemed particularly
hung up about the greater
fragility and vulnerability of

development (stamina, life span,
emotional stability) except
physical prowess. While men
depended on the addition of
androgen for their very existence,
sex differentiation, and
presumably sex role behavior,

came almost automatically to
women. After all, women could
even procreate while unconscious -
and the doctor seemed to equate
this with sexual participation.
Perhaps, he said this vulner-
ability so threatens hetero-
sexual men that it causes them

to behave chauvinistically to
homosexuals and women. How

about that?

During the lecture, our group
was going through a number of
changes. The atmosphere in
the room deadened most of my
urgency and anger (the
second lecture seemed more
absurd and irrelevant than
insulting) and I felt confused
about what to do. The second
woman felt that there wouldn't
be enough support for an action,
that the situation was
hopeless and the best thing
we could do was to absorb what
was going down in the lectures
and use the information later.
The third woman felt that we
should get up and say that the
format was oppressive, explain
why, and walk out. The fourth
woman was the angriest and
wanted to call for a women's
meeting outside the lecture
hall right then and there.

We had to whisper our feelings.
