cally enough, right around Inter-  
national Women's Day. By March  
6th, the courts have ruled that  
Philadelphia County Welfare offi-  
ces must re-establish the human  
machinery to deliver emergency  
checks across the counter—rather  
than send them through the mail.  
The mail system was instituted by  
Governor Shafer about two years  
ago in Philadelphia (but not in  
the other 66 counties of the state)  
based on a particular mistrust of  
recipients in this, the largest  
urban area in Pennsylvania. The  
implications are that more cheat-  
ing goes on in our own largely  
black recipient population than it  
does in the other counties.  

The "across the counter" sys-  
tem attempts to speak to the im-  
mediate, emergency needs of the  
applicants and displays some faith  
in them based on a recognition  
that the rate of fraud involving  
welfare grants is miniscule—less  
than 2%. (85% of all welfare re-  
cipients are either children, el-  
derly, disabled, blind or too sick  
to work; the remaining 15% are  
parents—nearly all women in one-  
parent families.)  

So the court ruling sounds  
like progress, a victory for the  
Welfare Rights Organization—and  
their supporters. But the State  
has failed to allocate any funds

ancial (RAN) department workers  
will have even greater difficulty  
processing the files and checks.  
Unless workers in the local dis-  
trict offices get themselves to-  
gether before then and state that  
they want to serve the clients'  
needs but will be unable to unless  
they get more money and staff,  
they will be colliding head-on  

with angry welfare applicants and  
recipients.  

The majority of both welfare  
workers and welfare rights acti-  
vists are women who lack any real  
power and control over their own  
lives. Last fall, workers of the  
Hill District of the Philadelphia  
County Board of Assistance went  
out on a two-day strike with sup-  
port from recipients—to protest  
the conditions under which they  
are attempting to serve clients.  
The office, originally set up to  
handle 5000 clients now serves  
over 11,000! Clients are badly  
treated; the office has rats and  
roaches; it is dirty. There is no  
privacy for interviews and workers  
must keep their records in card-  
board boxes. Thus the strike.  

As this article is being writ-

soming of this arrangement is that  
the State Office Building is a long  
way from the South District, so  
clients must travel great distan-  
ces to see their caseworkers. A  
sad episode for all the women in-  
volved in it. Women who have ta-  
ken paid positions in the welfare  
department thought these jobs  
would gain for them some degree  
of financial security and decent  
working conditions, but have found  
this is not the case. Welfare  
recipients, of course, are in a  
worse state, having almost no  
choice in determining their own  
destiny. The welfare mother  
should decide for herself whether  
she wants to stay home or to seek  
outside employment. She should  
not be forced to do either. The  
woman whose husband is able to  
support her should have the same  
choice. Quality childcare and a  
guaranteed income should be the  
basic right of all people. But  
these choices are not possible in  
the society under which we all  
now live.  
March 6th could see a lot of  
energy dissipated in the wrong  
direction, focused on the wrong  
people. March 6th could mean sis-  
terhood, the refusal of women to  
be divided from one another. If  
women in the women's liberation  
movement begin to understand the  
connections between women on wel-  

whole, we will be on our way to  
building a movement which speaks  
to the needs of all women, and  
ultimately to the liberation of  
the entire society.  

health care  
project  

Emphasis in recent meetings  
has been on several specific  
areas:  

1. Continuing and broaden-  
ing pressure on profiteering  
abortion referral services  
(There's more than one in Phila-  
delphia now; it's a growing  
industry.)  

2. Getting women trained as  
abortion counsellors—Clergy  
Consultation Service trained a  
dozen women to do abortion coun-  
selling throughout the city. More  
women will be trained in the fu-  
ture, looking toward phasing  
clergy out of abortion counsel-  
ling and replacing them with a  
service of and by women.  

3. PARA (Pennsylvania Abor-  
tion Rights Association) needs  
more women to survey local hos-  
pitals to assess their abortion  
policies and practices. Many  

people feel that one of the big-  
gest mistakes New Yorkers made  
was neglecting to do this before  
NY abortion laws were overturned.  
Call Phyllis Ryan at L03-2270 for  
more information.  

Where is all this leading?  
Several women in the Health Care  
Project are envisioning health  
care services for women and chil-  
dren coming out of the new Women’s  
Center. We might begin with lim-  
ited medical services such as  
abortion counselling, pregnancy  
tests, birth control and sex  
education information, prenatal  
care. Input is needed from many  
more women to realize this goal,  
particularly by women who have  
or are interested in earning  
basic medical skills.  

.. House for Women in  
Transition - The Center has re-  
ceived many calls from women in  
transition - women who are re-  
thinking major portions of their  
lives - marriage, jobs, relation-  
ships with men, other women, chil-  
dren - young women, women coming  
into the city for the first time -  
and countless other reasons and  
situations. What these women  
have in common is a need for free

space, a place to go for an after-  
noon or to live in on a short-  
term basis - and a community of  
other women to support and listen  
to each other. We envision ex-  
perimenting with a new form of  
therapeutic community - rather  
than the rigid shrink/patient re-  
lationship. We see this as a  
logical outgrowth of conscious-  
ness-raising and the major  
changes it produces in women's  
lives.  
We must begin to offer  
material and emotional support  
in ways not open to us yet  
through consciousness-raising  
groups. We are thinking in  
terms of going after major fund-  
ing for this, establishing a  
separate house for this purpose.  
We have several leads on avail-  
able funds but need input on  
designing this project and writ-  
ing a funding proposal. Most of  
the writing will be done in Feb-  
ruary and March, the proposal  
being submitted to one group at  
the end of April. Call Nancy at  
L08-3750 x 58 or BA2-0h20 for  
more information.
