the hilt.

Psyche has been down that  
long analysis trail. and she  
points out how women in analysis  
are urged by their psychiatrists,  
usually male, to conform to the  
norm, i.e. be the second class  
citizen society expects women to  
be. "Had Mallory in fact gone  
to an analyst (which she has not)  
all the fears that she lived  
with anyway which are in the  
air of society would have been  
rigidified. She would most  
likely have been told that her  
primary function, primary role  
in society was not to be an  
actress first, but to be a  
mother and wife first, and  
then whatever room was left  
over could be used for an  
art which would indeed take  
first place if she were a man  
(my husband was an actor).

That art, had she gone to an  
analyst would have been  
negated to a second position."

Men from the age of two  
have the knowledge that they  
can determine their destiny.  
Women are given a minimal  
amount of this feeling,  
since they have not, up until  
now, had much destiny to  
determine. It is the differ-  
ence between building bridges  
and dusting. The bridge,  
when it is built, can be seen  
and used. It is an accomplish-  
ment. The dust, while it can  
be cleared up today, will be  
back tomorrow as will the  

dishes in the sink, and the  
dirty wash. Why should one  
half of the population, because  
of sex be kept from destiny?

"For the damage Freud has  
done to women, I'm not sure  
I'll ever forgive him," she  
says.

Woman is seen as the object,  
the male as the subject in  
society. The man is the screwer,  
the woman the screwed. The man  
as the raper, the woman as raped.  
The active and the passive,  
sadism and masochism.  
Psychiatry's biggest faux  
pas after the castration and  
penis envy myth was the myth  
of the vaginal orgasm.

Women were told by psychiat-  
rists that if they did  
not experience this non-existent  
myth they were ill. Women, in  
order to prove a man's virility,  
had to lie, had to say they  
experienced what in fact they  
did not: vaginal orgasm, when  
in fact there is only clitoral  
orgasm. The myth has served  
men well.

Psyche calls this "lying  
in bed." Women have been  
taught so strongly to please  
the man at any cost that there  
is actual lying, sexual lying,  
lying in fantasy, lying in  
reality, and this too has been  
reinforced by psychiatric  
thought; the object (woman) is  
to please. "If for a moment

Last issue we asked for your  
help to buy a badly needed  
typewriter, and we got some  
response, some very generous  
response. But, we are still  

a long way from having enough.  
Can you help? We asked every  
one who read the paper to send  

a dollar, so if you've been  
meaning to, but haven't gotten  
around to it, we'd appreciate  

if you would. Also we are in  
need of equipment: T-squares,  
metal rulers, art-layout type  
stuff, and typing paper, etc.  
All donations will be appreciated!  
Also if you'd like to join the  
group of women who put out this  
paper, or Through The Looking  
Glass which is another Phila,  
women's paper, call the center  
and leave your name, SA7-1717.  
We appreciate letters, comments...  
suggestions. Please write to  
us at Box 93, Penllyn, Pa, 19422.

"creativity, cleverness," and  
sometimes even the "poetry" of ads.  
Like the soma addicts of "Brave  
New World" however, they will  

stay happy and secure as long as  
the Frito Bandito continues to  
skip across the screen. Boob tube,  
soma. No big difference.

What then is so horrifying a-  
bout "Brave New World"? It is, in  
fact, the elimination of natural  
motherhood and pregnancy, which,  
one gathers from Aldous Huxley,  
means the inevitable elimination of  
love. In accepting this gloomy  
thesis, society at the time the  
book was published overreacted,  
and the concept of sacred, glorious  
motherhood soared into popu-  
larity (and frantic practice).

But in swallowing Huxley's belief  
that love and "mother" are insep-  
arable, we have conveniently  
avoided facing up to the real  
problem of woman's role in the fu-  
ture. No one wants to see love  
eliminated from humanity, there-  
fore no one must challenge mother-  
hood. So until the past few years  
motherhood and pregnancy grew in  
popularity to the point where  
pregnant women were cheered and  
eulogized as the happiest and  
most beautiful creatures alive,  
and the whole natural childbirth-  
breast-feeding routine became a  
status symbol, a mystique in it-  
self.

Then came over-population,  
pollution, and the threat of fa-  
mine. The pill was invented and  
nearly half the women in America  
went to college or held jobs.

"Brave New World is here" we  
cried in horror as women clamored  
for birth control, abortion, job  
equality, day care centers, and  
better education.

"Go back to your kitchens and  
bedrooms!" women are ever being  
urged. In the name of Love, men  
are pleading with their wives and  
mothers to stay imprisoned in the  
narrow social and intellectual  
limits set for females in the Vic-  
torian Era. To those men who  
benefit most from the femininity  
myth, “liberation” for women  
means nothing more than giving  
girls the right to initiate sex-  
ual intercourse, smoke their own  
dainty cigarettes, and do a little  
"creative" cooking or sewing for  
the menfolk. The really serious  
questioning of motherhood, mar-  
riage, and the home can thus be  
easily overlooked.

No one, however, is fooled  
for very long.

We have already reached the  
point where thousands of young  
women have renounced the idea of  
large families. The beginning of  
the end? If more people do not  
also pledge to limit the number  
of their children, it will be.

Motherhood needs a good cleaning--  
time to do away with the gilded  
cherubs, the valentine candy box,  
and the phony greeting card verses  
that have measured our guilt and  
bewilderment over a glorified na-  
tural state. To say that by de-  
emphasizing maternity we will lose  
Love is to say that love is a flim-  
sier emotion than it actually is.  
A friend does not give birth to a  
friend, nor do adoptive parents  
conceive their children, yet both  
love. Lovers are not born be-  
cause one single person desired a  
mate, but because two people  
reached out, shared, and communi-  
cated.

Increasingly today, the moth-  
er role as a lifetime commitment  
is losing ground. When it reaches  
its natural level of importance--  
one of unhysterical dignity--at  
least one problem, over-population,  
may be on its way to a solution.  
To paraphrase the famous epigram  
on war: "Love is too important to  
be left entirely to mothers."
