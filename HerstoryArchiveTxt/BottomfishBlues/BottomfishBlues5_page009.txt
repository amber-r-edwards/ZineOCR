to get away with our white  
power feminism if everyone saw  
it as it is, so we need to col-  
orize our community a little.  
We need just enough Women of  
Color—but never so many that  
our agenda would be changed...  
So we can pretend we're for all  
women, not just Ms. number one.  

Which is why we need to  
steal New Afrikan women's poli-  
tics. So we can claim to have a  
women's consciousness that we  
don't have. You have only to  
look at the Dianne Davidson  
mess—or a thousand others—to  
figure out that we, just by  
ourselves, aren't anti-racist  

at all. We can repeat the words  

by rote but we don't know how  
to live it. Left to our lone-  
some we'd look like politically  
backward, unsensitive white  
bigots. That's why we need them  
as our cleaning women, to keep  
washing up our community, keep  
wiping the dirt off our faces.  
Fronting for us. We leave it to  
Third World women to catch the  

worst racist "slips", to pro-  
test. Then we say, “Our commu-  
nity is fighting racism." No,  
ain't no “our", no “we:" They  
are doing it & we're coasting  
off it. And, of course, we need  
their energy and strength and  
ideas to help build Jane's  
house. To help build institu-  
tions and organizations that  
are our property & that they  
get something out of (else they  
wouldn't do it), but which will  
never be theirs.  

Black women are unique to  
us. We got a special thing  
about them, which you & I know  
in our guts but we can't talk  
about in public. Unlike Indian  
or German or Palestinian women,  
we deny New Afrikan women their  
nationality. Alone, of all the  
women on the face of the earth.  
No one denies that Lakota women  
or Nicaraguan women have their  
own nation whose situation &  

struggles they are part of. But  
Black sisters, we really feel  
that they are ours, out of hun-  
dreds of years of their invol-  
untary sharing & involuntary  
caring for us. We demand that  
they stay by our side, be a  
"sift" to our community to help  
us make this transition. To  
give it their strength & their  
soul. It's more important that  
New Afrikan women educate us &  
help us than take care of their  
own—our problems come first.  
We demand that they leave their  
nation for us.  

‘Course we put it on New  
Afrikan women's weakness. Say  
Black men are too violent, too  
homophobic, too Islamic, too  
everything for them to deal  
with. Think we're doing the  
charitable thing, always skim-  
ming some of the most con-  
scious New Afrikan women for  
our community. Take the few &  
leave the many. Do we really  
believe that New Afrikan  
sisters can't take care  

of themselves? I don't know  
what direction New Afrikan  
women will choose. How they  
will solve their problems. But  
I do know they ain't on earth  
to solve mine.  

The thing is, we really  
fear New Afrikan women even  
more than we do men. When the  
Black pin-prick hysteria on the  
Upper West Side was going on, I  
couldn't help thinking of "The  
Birds." You know, that old Al-  
fred Hitchcock movie. Here we  
just assume those birds are out  
there, flying ‘round doing  
their harmless thing, for us to  
use however we feel like. Shoot  
'em out of the sky for fun, lis-  
ten to their music for lifting  
our souls, then roast 'em up for  
din-din. Love those birds. But  
then ("It's not nice to fool  
Mother Nature!") the birds get  
the word & everywhere around  
the world, white civilization  
perishes as billions of fed-up  
birds, in relentless waves,  

swarm over & peck to death  
every last white person. Wow!  
Moviegoers were terrified.  
Whites were shocked that they'd  
never thought of the obvious—  
you mean something we use &  
take for granted might resent  
us, might do payback? I think  
it wasn't birds that whites  
were so unconsciously guilty  
and worried about. We know that  
what we've done to New Afrikan  
women for generation after gen-  
eration is so cruel & anti-  
woman that if it were us—and  
if we got the chance for pay-  
back—why we'd... That's why  
the panic last Fall, when white  
women were taking cabs to their  
front doors after work, only  
going out with escorts, avoid-  
ing Black women, wanting more  
police protection... All ‘cause  
of seven women-children.  

When I speak on the silence  
in our community about all  
this, I'm not talking about  
evil people—I wanna emphasize  
that—but about the degrading &  
anti-woman effects on all of us  
from this phony integration.  
Sisters work for years at edu-  
cating & building, only to see  
things slide backwards time  
after time. Look at Womanews,  
which has always been one of  
the most serious local women's  
newspapers. A real survivor  
from the 1970s.  

Like most women's projects,  
it was integrated in the usual  
sense—mostly white sisters  
with a few die-hard women of  
color. That gradually changed  
as more Women of Color came  
around & they began demanding  

more respect. Finally, Third  

World sisters’ complaints about  
continued racism led them to  
forming a caucus, taking the  
steering wheel & demanding that  
white sisters get themselves  
together. Overnight, white  
women fled. According to an ac-  
count in their pages a few  
months ago, there is now only  
one white sister left full-time  
on Womanews. So years & years  
of integration has added up to  
feminist "white flight." And a  
telling situation where women  
of color put out a newspaper  
whose primary beneficiaries and  
readers are white women, while  
there is yet no New Afrikan or  
Latina women's newspaper in  
NYC. Just like every conference  
ends with angry words and Third  
World women's caucuses and com-  
plaints of racism,  

Some sisters worry that  
moving to upfront white groups  
& bringing up racism will be a  
dangerous mess (that fear  
should fax something to us  
FAST), that then the racism  
will get really ugly. Yup,  
that's what I'd guess too. But  
let it all out. The storm is  
coming to Amerikkka anyway.  
White sisters gotta stand alone  

for a while, gotta find out  

where we really are. No cover-  
up, no more nice pretend words,  
no more using Women of Color.  
It's gotta end so we can tell  
who's really into sisterhood.
