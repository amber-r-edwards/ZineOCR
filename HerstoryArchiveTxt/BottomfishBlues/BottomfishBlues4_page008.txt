A word of caution: Red Zora  
is not simply an evening activ-  
ity of sisters from your local  
anti-rape center or Third World  
solidarity group. If you think  
that's all it is & just jump out  
there yourself and do something  
spontaneously, you're gonna get  
in over your head. So consider  
yourself warned.  

Red Zora grew out of the  
early political experiences of  
another radical underground, the  
male/female Revolutionary Cells.  
("Revolutionäre Zelle"), with  
which it still shares common  
principles and a working  
alliance. Both networks use the  
initials "RZ" to mark their  
commonality. This has been con-  

troversial with some parts of  
the women's movement.  

Red Zora  

Frauen aus Protest auf die  
(rae, ea  

tions. Together with the Revo-  
lutionary Cells, we printed up  
‘pirate’ public transit fare-  
cards, and handed them out in  
the Rulo district to introduce  

a little ‘tax-free income’.  

“ZORA 1: We don't limit our-  
selves only to the most obvious  
women's oppression. As women we  
are also concerned about social  
power conditions... We don't like  
the left ‘division of labor’  
under the motto: the women for  
the women's question, the men  
for the general political  
themes. Nobody can take away  
from us the responsibility for  
changing our everyday life.  
Therefore, for example, we have  
set fire to the fancy cars of  
the lawyers of the slumlord  
Kaussen, who were responsible  
for a series of brutal evic-  

tions.  

women cooperate with the Revolu-  
tionary Cells to carry out some  
projects (such as the protest  
bombings that greeted President  
Reagan's visit to the Nazi ceme-  
tery at Bitburg). They told  
Emma about the relationship:  

“ZORA 2: ...But there are  
also stressful discussions.  
Sometimes men who otherwise  
transform their radical break  
with the system into real prac-  
tice are at the same time  
alarmingly far away from real-  
izing what anti-sexist struggle  
means, and what meaning it has  
for the perspective of revolu-  
tionizing society. Between us  
women there is also controversy  
where the limits are, when a  
cooperation [with mixed groups]  
strengthens or paralyzes our  
women's struggle. But we think  
our feminist identity unites us  
with some women of the Revolu-  
tionary Cells."  

AGAINST GENOCIDE  

When the feminist guerrillas  
of Red Zora staged a midnight  
raid on the files of the Insti-  
tute of Human Genetics at the  
University of Muenster, on Aug-  
ust 5, 1986, it went unreported  
here, not causing a ripple. It  
was an important women's action  
against genocide, however. It  
was the kind of action that no  
one took in the 1920s to stop  
the rise of fascism then.  

In Germany imperialist  
science and genocide have always  
grown from the same root (not  
that it's any different here).  
Nazi genocide wasn't "unimagin-  
able" excesses by a scummy rac-  
ist ideology; it was the main-  
stay of the patriarchal system  
of industrialists and sci-  
entists. While in prison young  
Adolf Hitler had read the uni-  
versity biology textbook Eugen-  
ics and Race-Hygiene, written by  
Germany's foremost professors of  
genetics and anthropology. He  
took their imperialist master  
race theories for his own book,  
Mein Kampf, the bible of the  
National Socialist movement.  
These very same leading scien-  
tists had prominent roles later  
in the Nazi extermination  
system.  

Even in the 1930s these geno-  
cidal German scientists were be-  
ing funded and sponsored by the  
Rockefeller interests, which af-  
ter the War helped them to in-  
conspicuously resume their dead-  
ly work in "democratic" West  
Germany. It is this genocide  
science which is today poten-  
tially more powerful than ever  
in the form of new bio- and  
genetic technology. Red Zora  
women guerrillas and feminists  
in "legal" women's groups have  
been fighting to expose imper-  
ialist bio-technology, which  
masquerades as only a humani-  
tarian research to improve crop  
yields and help women prevent  
birth defects, for the intended  
weapon that it is.  

Imperialist science now  
believes that it is on the brink  
of achieving what the Nazis  
merely fantasized, of true popu-  
lation control. Reshaping and  
culling out the human race just  
like a breed of livestock or a  
hybrid strain of vegetables. As  
many women have warned, we are  
the target center of this  
thrust. For imperialist bio-  
genetic technology needs to re-  
capture women's bodies to con-  
trol and cull out as their  
living breeding machines.  

The relationship to Nazi gen-  
ocide is simple to trace, since  
men's genocide is a family af-  
fair. West Germany's Institute  
for Human Genetics was led in  
the 1950s by Dr. Otmar Von Ver-  
sucher. While we are certain  
that Dr. Von Versucher prayed  
before bed each night to remain  
undiscovered another day, he was  
really a historic figure in  
patriarchal science.  

Already a department head at  
the elite Kaiser Wilhelm Insti-  
tute of Anthropology when the  
Nazis came to power in 1933, Von  
Versucher and his colleagues  
built the Nazi system of race-  
classification. Every German  
was eventually screened by this  
system, which decided who would  
be killed and who would be per-  
mitted to live for their labor,  
according to what degree of  
"sub-human" (i.e. gypsy or Jew-  
ish) genes they supposedly had.  

That it was crazy and unsci-
