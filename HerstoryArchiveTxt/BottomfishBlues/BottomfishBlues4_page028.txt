semitic" too). Of course, when  
it looks like the power struc-  
ture is singling out some Black  
man for attack, that only moti-  
vates people to take them more  
seriously, to wanna support  
them. It all goes round and  
round, like the roulette wheels  
at Las Vegas, where the house  
always wins. In this case it's  
the White House.  

How smart do we gotta be to  
get the message? This "Black  
anti-semitism" is a neocolonial  
game, in which they're the only  
winners. It's what happens  
when white women don't break  
with the patriarchy and New Af-  
rikans haven't broken with the  
white nation. And if we don't  
see that, if we're still fooled,  
it's only because we secretly  
want to be, like the magician's  
willing audience.  

There are a few Jewish women  
who see through it all, recog-  
nize it as a patriarchal game,  
but they're too scared to act  
up. It is scary in amerikkka  
or anywhere else in A Man's  
World to place yourself in op-  
position to genocide.  

Here in amerikkka the zionist  
community is actually working  
for the real anti-semites. —  
That's why this "Black anti-sem-  
itism" propaganda has worked so  
well. Isn't real anti-semitism  
a white thing? Something creat-  
ed by euro-culture and christi-  
anity. Everyone knows that, un-  
like New Afrikans, the armed  
white right-wing has done it  
all: assassinated Jews, bombed  
temples, beaten up Jews on the  
streets, put up anti-semitic  
graffiti, and keep bragging  
they're going to do much more.  
And they've got a mass base of  
anti-semitic amerikkkan sympa-  
thizers, including the Republi-  
can Party hierarchy.  

And yet and again, the Jewish  
patriarchy says that "Black  
anti-semitism" is the threat.  
Isn't that just a sophisticated  
version of "Willie Horton"-ism?  

I mean, you don't have to be  
a genius to see something wrong  
there. Last year Nathan Perl-  
mutter, national director of the  
Jewish Anti-Defamation League  
(A.D.L.), said that based on an  
opinion poll his office had com-  
missioned, Jews could feel "re-  
assured"—that's his exact word—  
about right-wing groups like  
the Aryan Nation. Although many  
reports have described the  
growth of armed right-wing  
groups in the white farm belt  
(and elsewhere in white settler  
society), Perlmutter told the  
press conference that "Anti-Sem-  
itism is not on the rise in  
rural America."  

The headline says “Anti-Semi-  
tic Appeal in Farmland Is Not  
Taking Hold, Survey Finds." But  
in the small print, here's what  
they found after interviewing  
white farmers in Iowa and Neb-  
raska:  

2% said that they had attend-  
ed armed right-wing meet—  
ings  

13% put “a good deal of"  
blame for the farm crisis  
on "certain religious  
groups, such as the Jews"  

15% said that they knew about  
the armed right-wing groups  

27% placed the blame for  
their troubles on “inter-  
national Jewish bankers."  

losers in white sheets, they're  
nothing). After accepting their  
resignations, George Bush's ad-  
visors had him send a message  
back to their white ethnic com-  
munities that he still supported  
them and was unhappy that they'd  
been exposed:  

"Nobody's giving in...We're  
not accusing anybody of any-  
thing. We're getting into a  

Demonstrators yesterday at ABC television in Manhattan protest news coverage of Israeli beatings of Palestinians  

How “reassured" should Jewish  
women feel about that?  

There was a moment's fuss  
last year about the six chris-  
tian anti-semitic officials  
exposed in the ‘Bush for Presi-  
dent campaign. (“Only six?" we  
thought.) But that wasn't the  
story, that was merely the  
coverup.  

Five of the men were on the  
G.O.P. campaign committee for  
white ethnics, the “coalition of  
American Nationalities." They  
had to resign because of pro-  
nazi activities. Many had been  
personally involved in their  
youth in killing Jews back in  
Europe. One in the Arrowcross,  
the Hungarian anti-semitic gang  
that spent the 1930s murdering  
Jews and communists and femin-  
ists and trade-unionists. One  
in the Roumanian Iron Guard.  
Another in "P2", the Italian  
1970s secret fascist conspiracy.  
Kinda like a "Who's Who" of in-  
ternational right-wing men's  
consciousness-raising groups.  

What everybody is covering up  
is that none of this was any  
surprise to the Bush campaign.  
For the Republican Party has  
sought out and courted all the  
most influential white anti-  

-semitic leaders (forget those  

very peculiar deal where people  
are accusing people. I don't  
like it a bit."  

"BLACK ANTI-SEMITISM" IN CHICAGO  

What amerikkka calls "Black  
anti-semitism" is mainly a white  
thing, run by white people, for  
white people, out of white euro-  
culture. Since this fuss has  
been about words, about talk, we  
should check out the talkers.  

Most notorious is Steve Coke-  
ly, who until a national contro-  
versy last spring was a special  
aide to Chicago mayor Eugene  
Sawyer. Cokely was being paid  
$35,568 a year to go around the  
New Afrikan community making  
speeches saying that U.S. euro-  
capitalism wasn't responsible  
for the oppression of Black peo-  
ple, that it was the Jews. He  
said that a Jewish "secret soci-  
ety" was taking over the world,  
and even said that “the AIDS  
epidemic is a result of doctors,  
especially Jewish ones, who in-  
ject the AIDS virus in the  
Blacks."  

That’s the Real Thing, that  
crackhead old-time European em
