The opening-night party for ‘Les Misérables’ at the Seventh Regiment Armory.  

In Celebration of an Opening  

By RON ALEXANDER  

Question: How many people are in  
a mood to party after seeing a som-  
ber musical in which the hero dies,  

half the characters bite the dust dur-  

ing the Paris insurrection of 1832 and  
the most striking set is a sewer?  
Answer: Close to a thousand. That  
is how many showed up at the Sev-  
enth Regiment Armory Thursday for  
the opening night party for ‘Les Mi-  
sérables.’ Never mind that Raquel  

Welch, Calvin Klein, Carol Channing -  

and Mayor Koch were among the no-  
shows: the guests who did arrive  
more than filled the vast Drill Hall of  
the 1880 landmark building. They  
danced to everything from rock to  
“La Vie en Rose,” while upstairs,  
dozens of homeless women found  
shelter for the night.  

An ‘Appropriate’ Setting  

Jim McNabb, who coordinated the  
$147,000 party for Cameron Mackin-  
tosh, the producer of ‘Les Miséra-  
bles,’ said he chose the armory be-  
cause the fortresslike building is “ap-  
propriate to the struggle of the down-  
trodden theme of Victor Hugo’s  
novel.” For the party, which was un-  
derwritten by the Mutual Benefit  
Companies, the restrooms were re-  
painted, trees were brought into  
the hall, centerpieces were made of  
French wildflowers in wicker has-  

avoid haute cuisine and place  
stronger emphasis on cuisine ordi-  
naire,” said Jean-Michel Savoca of  
New York Parties, which whipped up  
everything from choucroute à Valsa-  
cienne to apple tarts from a Norman  
recipe. (The food, Mr. Savoca said,  
was also sent upstairs to the home-  
less women, as well as to the shelters  
at the Bowery Mission and the Fifth  
Avenue Presbyterian Church.)  

A Yen for Spareribs  

Not everyone was impressed. “I’m  
not going to stand in a long line wait-  
ing for food to be served,” said  
Joanne Winship, who left at 10:30  
P.M. with her husband, Frederick. “I  
mean, we’re not peasants. Anyway,  
my housekeeper has the most deli-  
cious spareribs in the oven.”  

Kathleen Turner and her husband,  
Jay Weiss, did not stay long either,  
but Claus von Bülow appeared to  
enjoy himself immensely. He had  
kind words for the show, too: “I liked  
it very much because I feel so much  
like Jean Valjean.”  

Chita Rivera was there and so were  
Bernadette Peters, Margot Kidder,  
Brooke Adams, Burt Bacharach, the  
cast of the show and chums and rela-  
tives from England and Ireland.  

“I play the innkeeper and I watch  
you on television all the time.” John
