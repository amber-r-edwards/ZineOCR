disclosure of such a scandal could  
jeopardize congressional funding..."

He was then flown to CDC head-  
quarters in Atlanta for a top-level  
meeting, in which the usefulness of  
the study was defended by "health"  
officials. A proposal that any  
survivors be told the truth and  
given antibiotics was rejected.  
Since all the African-American  
survivors were expected to have  
serious heart damage, the doctors  
said, the shock of treatment might  
kill them. Besides, the CDC wanted  
to secretly continue their Nazi  
experiment.

In 1972 the story finally came  
out, after 40 years, ending the  
secret experiment in public scandal.  
One part of the Tuskegee Study is  
still going strong, however, the  
coverup. A heavy-duty whiteout came  
down, in which a government-appointed  
panel (chaired by a Black  
college president) issued a report  
only mildly criticizing the lack of  
informed consent by the subjects.  
The statement by CDC assistant  
chief Dr. Ralph J. Henderson that  
the experiment had "started out as  
a good thing" was echoed by the  
panel.

The government coverup centered  
on keeping African-American women  
and children invisible. CDC head-  
quarters in Atlanta admitted that  

the 431 men had an average of 5  
children each, 80% were married,  
and there were an unknown number of  
sex partners involved. You and I  
would think that there were many  
hundreds of African-American women  
and children also infected, many of  
the children congenitally infected  
at birth. Many of these children  
would never have lived to adulthood  
if untreated.

All sides on the investigating  
panel were quick on the draw to say  
that no African-American women and  
children had been infected. Replying  
to a setup question by Sen. Edward  
Kennedy, Dr. Henry Simmons, deputy  
to then HEW Secretary Casper Wein-  
berger (now Ronnie's Secretary of  
Defense), said that there had been  
no “hazard to those around the  
patients" because their later-stage  
syphilis was non-infectious.

Here the coverup showed itself in  
a thin lie. While the later stages  
of syphilis are mostly "latent",  
where the bacteria is silently des-  
troying the nervous system, blood  
vessels, vital organs and bones,  
but is not infectious to others, at  
any time the disease can switch to  
the "active" phase and be very  
infectious. The Tuskegee Study  
knowingly condemned African-American  
women and children to death, as well  
as 357 adult men. Government  
doctors could not screen and inform  

and treat women and children with-  
out tipping off the primary male  
subjects that something was wrong.

In 1973 a CDC memo, not given out  
to the public, confessed: "the  
possibilities are that wives may  
have contracted the disease directly  
and that children may suffer from  
congenital conditions." The memo  
confidentially estimated the expense  
of medical treatment just for  
surviving children at up to $127  
million. How many women died has  
never been made public (50 women  
were still being treated by govern-  
ment doctors in 1980), since the  
coverup is still running.

For 40 years, through Democratic  
and Republican administrations, the  
government had kept a conspiracy  
going to withhold medical treatment  
from African-Americans so that the  
deadly progress of a disease could  
be studied by white male science,  
for the benefit of the empire. And  
this is what they have done with  
AIDS in the NYC African-American  
community, only this time on a far  
grander scale of death.

For six years the NYC Dept. of  
"Health" refused to carry out any  
of the recommendations of gay  
organizations, AIDS researchers,  
and public health specialists. ALL  
steps that might have headed off  
the epidemic in the African-American
