Goode had to do the hora, an Is—
raeli folk dance, and personally
sang "Happy Birthday, Dear Is-
rael, Happy Birthday to you"
over the microphone at a Jewish
rally to support Israel's crush-
ing Palestinian protests (only
natural by now for Mr. Goode,
first you fire-bomb your own
children & then you support the
Jews beating and shooting Pales-
tinian children). Harold Wash-
ington was not Wilson Goode, but
he did have to make his symbol-
ically important first foreign
trip not to Afrika, not to Mexi-
co or Puerto Rico, but to Is—-
rael, to prove his support for
the Jewish agenda.

This is all plantation poli-
tics, a patriarchal & capitalis-
tic mess. Chicago's racist
Catholic political machine hired
Steve Cokely to use Jew-baiting
to help them bring down their
most hated enemy, Harold Wash-
ington, a New Afrikan who had
beaten them badly. Cokely was
also supposed to make their
Uncle Tom front-men appear na-
tionalistic.

This became even more impor-
tant to the White Power boys af-
ter Washington's unexpected
death, in November 1987, when
the old-time Machine bloc in the
city council voted their front-
man, alderman Eugene Sawyer, in
as interim mayor. Over loud
protests from the New Afrikan
community.

The White Power boys reward
those who help them inflate
"Black anti-Semitism." Case in
point: Harold Washington's for-
mer aide, Dorothear Washington,
who switched sides to the Ma-
chine after his death. Doro-
thear Washington came out for
mayor Sawyer & is a vocal de-
fender of Steve Cokely, "I took
the position that he had a right
to do or say," she said. "I
have nothing against him at
all."

Her reward? Dorothear
Washington helicoptered from a
$14,772 aide position to her
$45,481-a-year job as the Ma-
chine's security coordinator for
public housing projects. Her
job is to be the official liai-
son with the F.B.I., the U.S.
Attorney's office, and the other
police agencies. "Black anti-
Semitism" keeps curious company.

Everyone wants to make this
"Black anti-Semitism" out to be
something nationalistic, some-
thing from the streets. Like it
came out of Afrika and not out of
Europe. But when we check it
out, we find white manipula-
tions, white goals, white patri-
archal Euro-culture.

White Power.

In her Zionist attack on New
Afrikan and Palestinian women,
“Anti-Semitism in the Women's
Movement," former MS. magazine
editor Letty Cottin Pogrebin
used Black sociologist Iva Car-
ruthers, also from Chicago, as a
major example of New Afrikan
women's supposed anti-Semitism:

"Jewish women I interviewed
mentioned certain grievances
more than once. For example,
this passage from Iva E. Car-
ruthers’ ‘War on African Family-
hood’... "Today one of the most
serious assaults to African
familyhood is being forged by
the white feminist movement; the
theory for which is emerging -
from a predominantly Jewish
elite group...'"

Again, who is Iva Carruthers?
Her career is a creation of.
She is one of a
clique of Black professors who
were formed in the early 1970s
by the top white male admini-
strators of the Illinois state
university system. They were
hired because the F.B.I. was
worried about New Afrikan stu-
dent support there for revolu-
tionary groups, particularly the
Black Panther Party and the
Black Liberation Army.

Once, the government would
have hired upfront Toms, preach-
ing love for Amerikkka and loy-
alty to the White Man. But by
1970 the U.S. government knew
that the old-fashioned slave act
wouldn't cut it. So this clique
of bourgy professors were hired
as posers, brought in to attack
revolutionary organizations,
substituting instead an Al
Sharpton-like blend of "get me a
grant"ism and pacudo-national-
istic rhetoric.

Carruthers believes what she
says, just as Zionist women do.
This grouping of Black profes-
sionals criticize Jews as their
main enemy precisely because
they want assimilation into mid-
dle-class Amerikkka. Jews are
personally seen by them as riv-
als, because Jews are their
ideal model for New Afrikans to
follow in terms of using "ethnic
solidarity" and "minority capit-
alism" to work out more profita-
ble deals with the white power
structure. In other words, the
Cokelys and Carruthers want to
be what Jews are.

This whole obsession with &
imitation of Jews is closet
Euro-centrism, a secret worship
of the white patriarchy's way of
doing things.

For white women who've gotten
confused & abused and turned all
around by being mixed up in the
love affair between "Black anti-
Semitism" and the white patriar-
chy, the choice is there. In or
out. We still think in shallow
ways, conditioned ways, like
Pavlov's dog hearing the bell.
Zionism and "Black anti-semi-
tism" are different faces,
different fronts, for the same
thing. It's our choice now to
opt into the whole patriarchal
mess or to opt out. To set out
upon the journey of generations
to fight for our own society,

to build an Amazon alternative
to genocide-civilization.
