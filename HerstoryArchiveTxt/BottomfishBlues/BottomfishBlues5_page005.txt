Festival  
Workers’  
Statement  

Saturday we had a Town Meeting in order to  
actively undo Racism both conscious and un-  
conscious. This translates into naming racist  
attitudes and behaviors as we see and hear  
them. Friday night Dianne Davidson introduced  
a song by saying, and I paraphrase, “every white  
family in the South with a little bit of money  
would hire a Black woman to raise their  
children. It was the smartest thing my parents  
ever did.” Dianne then went on to sing a song  
describing how wonderful an experience that  
relationship was for her, and how she found  
comfort in “ebony arms.”  

Given the community commitment to make  
clear the full meaning of such statements, we  
must make clear that there is nothing comfort-  
ing about the institution of slavery from which  
this tradition grew. The context doesn’t address  
the historical and current conditions which  
make it possible for a white woman with “a  
little bit of money” to hire a Black woman to  
raise white children.  

The song focused solely on Dianne’s exper-  
ience while excluding the Black woman's ex-  
perience. This perpetuates racism, which allows  
whites to benefit from the oppression of Blacks.  
It is important that both Black and white  
women address the historical and current  
racist overtones of our relationships. White  
women cannot continue to make the exper-  
ience of Women of Color invisible.  

Dianne was given the opportunity to respond  
to our concerns as described in this statement.  
Her official response was “No comment.”  

Saying that it is smart to hire a “mammy,” is  
saying that it is smart to be racist. White women  
must accept the responsibility to recognize and  
interrupt such racism in our home communities  
and at our community gatherings.  

If we are serious about creating an actively  
anti-racist community, white women must rec-  
ognize and immediately interrupt racism.  

Womanews/October 1989  

Let's bring this closer to  
home. How come nobody speaks on  
those New Afrikan women-child  
amazons? Why the silence? I  
mean, this trial should have  
been an exciting event for po-  
litical women. Shoulda drawn  
women activists to it. All  
those women agree how brave the  
young women-children of Soweto  
are, confronting the oppressors.  
And the Palestinian women—  
children of the Intifada,  
hurling stones at the white op-  
pressors. Forcing a reluctant  
world to bow in recognition.  
But when these New Afrikan  
women-children do the same  
thing right here, everyone  
falls silent. Are your chickens  
coming home to roost?  

Instead, we left it to the  
men's press to brand them as  
social basket cases & their  
mothers as worse. So those  
women we destroy we forget as  
losers & those women who fight  
back we try to dismiss as  
losers. And we only want our  
white State to make it all go  
away (tho it won't!).  

Interesting isn't it that  
when something "unspeakable"  
happens like the Central Park  
Rape everyone speaks on it.  
Everyone wants to feel in-  
volved, money & concern pour  
in, debate happens, there's  
even a defense campaign. But  
this which should be spoken on  
draws only silence. Especially,  
most especially, from our inte-  
grated women's community, our  
publications and organizations.  
NYC's women's newspaper,  
belatedly had a short story on  
it. Neither they nor anyone  
else organized any support  
about this.  

So why can't sisters who  
tell us all about Palestine and  
South Africa see the same thing  
when it happens right here? It  
has a lot to do with this phony  
integration, with this shining  
lie that we're a movement of &  
for all sisters. It’s only when  
you admit that New Afrikans are  
a colonized nation, that you  
can see what these kids are  
doing—albeit crude and not  
thought out—as resistance  
against oppression.  

The whole mindset of the  
integrated women's movement,  
that we are for all sisters  
together, shields white women  
from being recognized as op-  
pressors of other women. It  
takes a shining vision of the  
future & says that's what rela-  
tionships are now, instead of  
the harder reality we start  
from. Simple black and white  
information isn't recognized by  
the mind in a clean, crisp way.  
So the integrated women's com-  
munity can't talk about the  
seven because to talk of the  
justice of women-children as  
incipient New Afrikan amazons  
would break the illusion. And  
you're married to the illusion.  

Understand that overcoming  
this integration is no side  
issue. It's the most important  
thing we can do. Our shallow  
ideas of sisterhood and our  
willing complicity in men's  
crimes are all knotted together  
in our white racism, much more  
than we understand right now.  
This is the central struggle in  
our community. In the long run  
it will answer our first ques-  
tion: who the "we" are.  

Last summer our racism  
bolted right out of the closet  
into the middle of the Michigan  
Womyn's Music Festival. There  
was already controversy about  
singer Dianne Davidson. In the  
Spring, an interview with the  
women's journal Sojourner had  
led to criticism & an intense  
exchange of letters. The con-  
troversy & letters in lesbian  
journals still continue.  

Davidson comes from a  
small-town Southern background.  
From the time she was five days  
old she was cared for & essen-  
tially raised by her family's  
New Afrikan servant, Hattie  
Ruth Simon. Davidson sings a  
song sentimentalizing this re-  
lationship, in a tradition in-  
dulged in by white Southerners  
ever since slavery days. She  
also says that she "wasn't  
white" in her previous life &  
that her servant woman was sent  
to her by some goddess or  
spirits to help her make this  
racial transition. Or something  
like that.  

On Friday night when David-  
son did these same things from  
the stage at Michigan, there  
was some shock & some anger.  
Led by New Afrikan and Latina  
sisters, most of them long-  
time Festival workers and per-  
formers, backstage discussions  
began about interrupting the  
racism. An official Festival  
workers' statement was read on-  
stage on Sunday that criticized  
Davidson for "perpetuating  
racism," and ended:  

"White women must accept  
the responsibility to recognize  
and interrupt such racism in  
our home communities and at our  
community gatherings."  

On Saturday, the Festival  
had scheduled not merely a  
workshop, as is customary, but  
for the first time an all-fest-  
ival Town Meeting on fighting  
racism, which 500 women took  
part in. One good result of  
that meeting was C.L.E.A.R.—  
Chicago Lesbians Emerging  
Against Racism. (see C.L.E.A.R.  
Statement). According to a  
friendly article by Ginny Ber-  
son and Achy Obejas in Windy  
City Times, C.L.E.A.R. began  
when seven white sisters who'd  
been through Michigan heard that  
Davidson was going to perform  
at Mountain Moving Coffeehouse  
on October 28, 1989. This white  
group took the responsibility  
for interrupting our communi-  
ty's racism, calling a boycott  
of the concert & an anti-racist  
workshop there afterwards.  

This boycott and the heated  
political discussions that took  
place around it both with Moun-  
tain Moving and in the press
