Police Still Digging for Leads in Suitland Slayings

By Keith H. sure the community of the same

Prince George’s County ees  
investigators returned  
to a wooded area near Suitland Road  
where the bodies of five young  
black women were found almost  
three months ago, checking to  
ensure that the department’s  
patrols had prevented  
other bodies from being dumped  
there, police said.  
“We wanted to reassure ourselves that there were no other  
bodies left there since the last  
search in the early part of January,”  
said Robert Law, a county police  
spokesman. “And we wanted to as—

Soon after finding the fourth and  
fifth bodies on Jan. 13, police set up  

a command post at their Forestville  
headquarters. As the case progressed,  
with fewer calls to take  
and fewer leads to pursue, the num-  
ber of investigators assigned to the  
case full time has been cut by about  
half.

The 16-hour days ended several  
weeks ago, when Police Chief Mi-  
chael J. Flaherty cut back on over-  
time throughout the department,  
including the homicide unit.

“We are not saying that we are at  
a dead end,” said Maj. James Ross,  
head of the Criminal Investigations  
Division. “We are still very vigor-  
ously pursuing leads.”

But Ross and other officers con-  
cede that as time passes, the leads  
and tips come farther apart and the

The ruling class is also trying  
to mess with our minds. By terror-  
izing us with all these accounts of  
women as helpless victims. They  
want us to panic, if not for our-  
selves for our children, and see  
ourselves only as victims. So that  
we can be herded back to the  
nuclear family.

They want us to run to white men  
for protection, as husbands or as  
cops. Whiteout of minds is an  
essential element in men's counter-  
attack against women's liberation.  
They want us to reach for whiteness  
as our only protection—back the  
police, take refuge in "safe" white  
condos or white suburbs where we  
lock ourselves in with the white  

men who attack us, help  

"our" men  

drive Black people out (lynch mobs  
are just the working man's gentri-  

fication),  

although over 90% of  

rapes and violent attacks on white  
women are done by white men.  
African-American women are terror-  
ized by African-American men while  
the entire Euro-American nation  
(women and men) get off on their  

brutalization.

Whiteout also means the ruling  
class doesn't publicize women's  
resistance, whites it out so that  
we don't see how much women are  
starting to fight back, so we don't  
see what our anger and our strength  
really are. Case in point: when

Search for Body Parts

CEDAR GROVE, Ind.—Search  
teams failed to find any additional  
body parts in a rural section of  
Franklin County where two legs,  
clothed in blue jeans and women’s  
suede boots, were found over the  
weekend.

They were found in a wooded  
area near U.S. 52, adjacent to the  
Old Cedar Grove Baptist Church,  
by people rehearsing for a wed-  
ding.

STABBING DEATH __

Police seek identity  
of woman with tattoo

Baltimore police were trying yes-  
terday to identify a woman found in  
the morning stabbed to death near a  
marina in the 1200 block of South  
Lakewood Avenue.

Dennis S. Hill, a police spokes-  
man, said the woman had been  
stabbed numerous times in the up-  
per torso.

She was described by police as  
white, in her late 20s, about 5 feet 5  
inches tall and weighing 130  
pounds. They said she had a rose  
tattoo on her left breast.

Police said they had no suspect  
and were uncertain of a motive.

slashed up by men with razor blades  
it was front page news day after  
day. Helpless white beauty ruined  
by low-lifes.

In comparison, in 1986 you might,  
just might, have noticed a two-inch  
high bit in the Daily News, back on  
page 48. That was about how a 23-year-old woman  
ingeniously killed a would-be  
rapist. She and a woman friend were  
relaxing at the Four Corners Recre-  
ational Area, a state park outside  
Nashville, Tenn. Two men attacked  
them. One of the men chased her  
companion, who outdistanced him  
racing through the forest.

The other rapist, 46-year-old  
Leceil Sawyer, was outdistanced by  
the woman as she leapt into her car  
and slammed the door. He got his  
arm through the window as she rolled  
it up, and kept trying to reach her.  
With an appropriate sense of tactics  
she simply drove off at warp ten.  
Flooring the accelerator she swerved  
over the yellow line and side-  
swiped the would-be rapist to death  
against an oncoming car. Every  
woman I spoke to about it said it  
was a gross but great story ("happy  
ending" was one smiling comment.  
"Rapist-paste" was another). But it  
wasn't on TV; it was buried in the  
back pages or cut out. Our success—  
ful resistance isn't a good story  
to them. But we must never forget  
that every day thousands of women  
are resisting, fighting back.

The other thing the ruling class  
wants is to hold our resistance at  
an individual level, scattered,  
unorganized. Each woman should
