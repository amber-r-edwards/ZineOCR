Chapter Three: Science of Genocide |

Nothing stands still, and our
lack of breakthrough has meant po-
litical regression. There is danger
that even the most radical feminist &

lesbian thought will be erased over
the next generation. This is scarcely
an original concern. Many radical
women's voices have long since sound—
ed an alarm. As Sidney Spinster
reminds us in her valuable essay,
"The Evolution of Lesbian Separatist
Consciousness," a decade ago TRIBAD
was observing white lesbians’ slip-
page back to the patriarchy:

"We're not dangerous as individuals.
We got scared of the political group
and went back to being individuals in
the economy. —

"Mainstream culture prints liberal
writings and calls it radical. The
culture doesn't print radical writings
(revolutionary political writings).

"Careerism has ruined the movement.
What is now visible as Movement is not
radical. All the Dykes went home to
get a lover and a job."

This danger of regression is not
mere speculation. After all, the
first white women's movement, the
women's suffrage movement that began
in 1848 and climaxed in 1920, got
completely wiped out. Leaving behind
da zip, da nada; nothing. That's why
we had to start from ground zero in
the 1960s, having nothing & knowing
nothing except that we were the first
generation. Ever wonder about that?

“THE FIRST WHITE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT

That movement was like ours in so
many ways. It was created out of a
time of struggle for the New Afrikan
Nation, just as ours was. White
women's politics in amerikkka have
always revolved around New Afrika, as
much as we deny it. From chattel
slavery to segregation to integration
& to today's genocide. How could it
be otherwise here.

White women's suffrage grew out
of the Northern anti-slavery move-
ment. The first women's political
organizations in the U.S. were the
Female Anti-Slavery Societies, which
were first started by New Afrikan
sisters of Salem, Mass. in 1832 (just
as New Afrikan women activists in
Mississippi were the first to raise
women's liberation in the 1960s).

Those local women's groups, of which
there were a hundred by the end of
the 1830s, were mostly white. Women
as public speakers & going door-to-
door organizing for a radical cause
freaked out white society, which had
prohibited its women from speaking on
& taking part in political life and
any public affairs at all.

The resolve of those women was
clear in the resolution passed by the
first Anti-Slavery Convention of
American Women in 1837, attended by
over 200 women from ten states, who:

"...no longer remain satisfied in
the circumscribed limits with which
corrupt custom and a perverted
application of scripture have encir—
cled her; therefore it is the duty of

woman, and the province of woman, to

plead the cause of the oppressed in
this land..."

In no time white women's politi-
cal activity was a greater outrage
to the established order than Anti-
Slavery itself. Anti-slavery activ—
ists were commonly attacked then as
now, and in 1838 the second Convent-
