reservation were vetoed by city  
"health" officials. Once again the  
government was pretending to have a  
"health" program, while being busy  
behind the scenes making sure that  
nothing interfered with the pro-  
gress of disease among Afrikan-  
Americans.

Step one for the government was  
to lull the victims, to give the  
Afrikan-American community a false  
picture of the disease. For six  
years the city "health" department  

refused to put out serious education  

about AIDS. Instead, publicity  
gimmicks such as the drive against  
gay bathhouses reinforced the image  
of AIDS as a "lifestyle" disease of  
gay white men. Yet in New York half  
of all AIDS victims are Afrikan-  
American and Latin, with the per-  
centage increasing every year.

On a world basis the majority of  

AIDS deaths are among women, Afrikan  

women. In the most infected areas,  
such as around Lake Victoria in  

Uganda, villages are devastated with  

survivors fleeing to other places  
and over half the people stricken.  
Is it impossible for this to happen  
here in the NY Afrikan-American  
reservation?

Step two for the city "health"  
plan has been to prevent AIDS  

screening, to deny Afrikan-Americans  

knowledge of whether they carry the  

AIDS virus. At first, for six years,  

the health arm at Leet ile ot,  

in opposing screening,  
under the leadership of Dr. David  
Spencer, former city "health"  
commissioner, who came here after  
being in charge of the Tuskegee  
Study cover-up operation at CDC  
headquarters in Atlanta. Only last  
year deputy "health" commissioner  

Dr. Stephen Schultz declared: "There  

is no value to testing any popula-  

tion except blood donors." Of course,  

they don't want straight whites or  
even, heavens forbid, the ruling  
class, to get AIDS through contam-  
inated blood transfusions.

But the government doesn't want to  

interfere with their study of un-  
knowing Afrikan-Americans trans-  
mitting AIDS to other Afrikan-  
Americans. The city even forbade

In the face of a pending worldwide  
AIDS epidemic, governments and  
individuals are calling for action, and  

what was once a stone wall of denial  
among Africans and blacks has given  
way to a new determination to confront  
the problem.

But as much-needed education and  
medical campaigns are unveiled around  
the world to try to stop the spread of  
the disease, many thoughtful observers  
are worried that there are attempts to  
fuel racism by associating AIDS with  
blacks and Hispanics. These groups  
account for 40 percent of AIDS cases in  
the United States, according to  
statistics.

“Some individuals are using [AIDS’  
disproportionate impact on blacks] as a  
tool to destroy hard-earned civil rights,”  
said Dr. Wayne Greaves of Howard  
University Hospital. “We know many  

anonymous testing (except for white  
gays who went to their private  
doctors), saying that Afrikan-  
Americans and Latins who wanted  
AIDS virus screening had to go to a  
few unpublicized clinics, register  
as gay and/or drug addict (you had  
to pick one to get the test), and  
present proof of identity. Not too  
many lined up to do that.

Now that the epidemic is in  
sight (the World Health Org-  
anization is talking about 100  
million victims worldwide)  

AIDS and Racism  

Haitians who work as housekeepers and  
taxi drivers who have been  
discriminated against.”

Furthermore, like any group in  
society that has historically been  
ostracized, the whole group can be  
affected by negative stereotyping.

“Over the years, blacks have been  
considered to be lazy, living off welfare  
and not taking care of their health,” said  
Greaves. “AIDS is seen as almost an  
extension of this.” According to people  
who think like this, blacks, just like  
homosexuals, are getting what they  
deserve.

Moreover, with widely circulated but  
unsubstantiated reports that the deadly  
virus originated in African countries and  
in Haiti, the circle was completed of the  
disease being seen as concentrated in  
groups not generally highly regarded in  
society.

According to World Health  
Organization estimates, at least 50,000  
Africans have died of the disease and 2  
million to 5 million are carriers of the  
virus. A November report from the  
U.S. Center for Disease Control said  
blacks and Hispanics account for 40%  

States and are far more likely to get the  

disease than white Americans.

THE WASHINGTON Post  

these same "health" officials  

are verbally acknowledging the  
need for community-based, eas-  
ily available, anonymous AIDS  

education and testing.

The city opened one such  
AIDS center at the end of 1986,  
in the Chelsea area to serve  
the gay male community (which  
already has services they've  
organized on their own, against  
government opposition). The  
opening of the last four AIDS  
testing and education store-  
front sites in 1987, one each  
in Harlem, Bronx, Brooklyn, and  
Queens, is only a gesture. One  
storefront for every 500,000  
-1 million people. That's like  
having a ship with the promise  
of one lifeboat for every 1000  
passengers. This kind of plan  
isn't a "health plan" but only  
a deception; the Afrikan-  
American community is being stud-  
ied but not helped to live.

Deliberately withholding  
services for drug addicts was  
important, since that was the  
main vector of AIDS spread  
into the community. Some 90%  
of addicts who use needles
