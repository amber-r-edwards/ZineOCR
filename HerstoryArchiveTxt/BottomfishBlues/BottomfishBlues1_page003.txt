illnesses. Only 74 survived. An
unknown but large number of Black
women and children were also
victims over the 40 years. The
government is still keeping its
cover-up going on this part. If it
admitted to killing off not only
Afrikan-American men, but also
women and children, why then the
question of genocide might come up.
Their story is worth telling be-
cause this is the same white
"health" bureaucracy running the
AIDS epidemic today.

Like AIDS today, syphilis had
become an epidemic in the Afrikan-
American community by the 1930s.
That was no problem for white
doctors, who claimed that venereal
disease was biologically natural
for people of color—Afrikans in
particular. Articles in white
medical journals then tossed around
labels like: "Negroes: A Syphilis-
Soaked Race". It was known that
most untreated syphilis patients
died from the disease. But white
doctors wondered if that only ap-
plied to Europeans. Afrikans, being
so used to the disease, might need
no treatment at all. That was in-
sane, I know, but that's what white
male science has always been like.

The ruling class wanted the
syphilis problem cleared up only
because the epidemic was interfer-
ing with their exploitation of the
Afrikan-American community. U.S.
army doctors had been forced to let
more and more Afrikan-American men
go because they were infected; as
many as 20% of all Black draftees
by 1940. So "health" authorities
began pilot programs with free VD
screening and medicine. But some
white doctors argued that money
could be saved by not treating
Afrikan-Americans.

The Tuskegee Study was done to
test that theory on living, unsus-
pecting Afrikan-Americans, to see
how many would die. Macon County,
Alabama, was chosen by the U.S.
Public Health Service because its
population of 27,000 was mostly
Afrikan-American (82%). They were
sharecroppers and farm laborers
who were isolated geographically,
uneducated and under Klan domina-
tion. The Afrikan-American commun-
ity there was "saturated" with
syphilis, 39% of adults testing
positive in a 1930 screening by the
Julius Rosenwald Foundation.

So in 1932 the Afrikan-American
residents of Macon County were glad
to hear that the federal government
had come with a special free
"health" program for them. At

Throughout back country (above) of Macon County,
Ala., and in town of Tuskegee, recruitment drives to
secure experiment subjects got underway in fall of
1932. The Depression and poverty in general encour-
aged recruits to accept free lunches and free burials.

church meetings Afrikan-American
doctors from the Tuskegee Insti-
tute, the famed Black school

started by Booker T. Washington,

told them that their cooperation—

with the government would wipe out
venereal disease in the community.

1,782 Afrikan-American men over
25 were asked to take blood tests.
Slightly over 400 of these men were
found to be in the later stages of
syphilis. These men were persuaded
to take part in the study with the
promise of free government doctors'

examinations, medicines, free "hot
meals" on exam days, and burial
insurance. The idea was even en-
couraged that this was a status
thing, a Black men's social club
and burial lodge sponsored by the
federal government.

But there was no health program,
only the deception of something
meant to look like one. The U.S.
Public Health Service’s plan was to
cut these Afrikan-American families
off from medical care so that their
deaths could be studied. There was
only a killing program. In 1936 one
of the white government officials
wrote of his Black subjects:

"Such individuals seemed to offer
an unusual opportunity to study the
untreated syphilis patient from the
beginning of the disease to the
death of the infected person. An
opportunity was offered to compare
the syphilitic process uninflu-
enced by modern treatment, with the
results attained when treatment has
been given."

The government "health" plan re-
quired a major conspiracy, for the
Afrikan-American families had to be
kept unknowing and with no way to
get medical care. Government doctors
and nurses were careful never to
tell the men that they would pro-
bably die without medical treatment.
The men were only told that they
had "bad blood". One man, Herman
Shaw, remembers that all the govern-
ment doctors would tell him was to
slap him on the back and exclaim,
"You are good for 100 years". Shaw
was accidentally sent to a Birming-
ham hospital for treatment once,
and had to be found and bused home
the next morning to keep him from
getting penicillin.

Each year the men got visits from
the Black U.S. Public "Health"
nurse, who dispensed free bottles
of painkillers and worthless
"spring tonic". The idea was to fool
the families into thinking they were
getting medicine. The conspiracy
involved the entire "health" system.
Names of the men were on a list
given to all local doctors and
hospitals. No one on the list could
get treatment by secret order of the

No one on the list could be told this.
Catch-22.

This Nazi-like experiment was
being financed by a liberal white
foundation in NYC, the Milbank
Memorial Fund. Other U.S. Public
"Health" Service work in the Afrikan-
American community was being finan-
ced by the Julius Rosenwald Found-
ation in Chicago. Both foundations
were regarded as being "in the
vanguard of the civil rights move-
ment", and were very involved in
Afrikan-American community affairs.
Since most of the Tuskegee Insti-
tute's budget came from one source,
the same Julius Rosenwald Foundation,
they willingly cooperated in denying
medical care to the Black families
selected for death.

The experiment went on until 1972.
In 1966 a young U.S. Public
"Health" Service doctor in San
Francisco, hearing about the study
from a co-worker, wrote to the dir-
ector of the Center for Disease
Control (CDC) in Atlanta. This is
the elite federal communicable
disease center, which was managing
the Tuskegee Study and which, co-
incidentally, is in charge of the
national AIDS program today. The
young doctor warned his superiors:

"The Tuskegee study could be
compared to the German medical ex-
periments at Dachau and that public
