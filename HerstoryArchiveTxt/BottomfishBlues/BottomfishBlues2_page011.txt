Gloria Steinem earned $1.2 million
in a single day recently as a result of
two different auctions conducted by a
friend who is not a literary agent.

In the first auction, Little, Brown
outbid 16 other publishers with an of-
fer of $700,000 for Ms. Steinem’s
“Bedside Book of Self-Esteem.” In
the second, Simon & Schuster outbid
seven other publishers with a $500,000
offer for a book about women from
rich and powerful American families.

Both books were offered by Letty
Cottin Pogrebin, an author and, like
Ms. Steinem, a founding editor of Ms.
magazine. A former subsidiary
rights director for a publisher, Ms.
Pogrebin acted as the agent for Ms.

Unlikely Looking Robbers ‘Stalk Fla.

Fort Lauderdale, Fla. (UPI) — Two
groups of female robbers are stalking
wealthy men in South Florida night-
clubs and hotels, knocking them out
with drugs and stealing their valua-
bles, police investigators said yester-
day.

Police said the women have taken
from $10,000 to $20,000 in cash and
valuables in each robbery. In all the
cases, the women were described as
well-spoken, attractive and fashion-
ably dressed.

“These are women who come off as
schoolteachers on vacation or airline
stewardesses in between flights,” Fort
Lauderdale Det. Jim Ives said.

“They don’t come off at all like pros-
titutes, and in all our cases there is no
offer of sex for money. These are guys
who just think they've picked a woman
up in a bar.”

Detectives are unsure how many
women are involved, but they think
two groups — one white, one black —
are working Broward, Dade and Palm
Beach counties in South Florida. Inves-
tigators said the women put powerful,
fast-acting drugs in their victims’
drinks, knock them out and rob them.

Ms. Pogrebin said that she had had
an “interesting re-entry” as an agent
but that she has no plans to continue
in the role. As for her friend, she said,
“Now maybe Gloria can grow old
without worrying about having to go
to the Feminist Old Folks Home.”
