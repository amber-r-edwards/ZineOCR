INTEGRATION  
“Learn A Way To  
_Say Good-Bye”  

As the genocide crisis  
grows out of control in  
amerikkka, scattering bodies  
everywhere, it's time to draw  
the balance sheet on integra-  
tion & what it's really meant  
in the women's community. In  
this incredibly racist society,  
the women's community is almost  
unique in being a community  
that was founded with a commit-  
ment to integration. A communi-  
ty whose sisters think of them-—  
selves as being against racism.  
A community not directly con-  
trolled by white men. There is  
public silence among us—yet  
again, the violent racial  
crisis shaking amerikkka is  
also a crisis in the women's  
community. But we don't wanna  
really look too hard at inte-  
gration & what it's meant to  
us, to our community. This is  
what I mean to talk about,  
directly & bluntly as I can.  

Let's deal with what inte-  
gration really is in amerikkka.  
Let's strip it down. 'Cause  
integration has nothing to do  
with propaganda about black 'n  
white walking hand in hand into  
the sunset. It presupposes that  
there are women of at least two  
separate nations, one oppressor  
& one oppressed (else why would  
we need to fight to integrate?)  
After all, white women are in  
the patriarchal white ameri-  
kkkan nation. We sure don't got  
one of our own. We want and  
accept citizenship, don't we,  
with all its privileges and du-  
ties, in Dick's white nation?  
Black women aren't citizens in  
the white patriarchal nation.  
New Afrikan women are captives  
in amerikkka, not citizens. In-  
tegration recapitulates the old  
mistress-slave relationship of  
European to African, which is no  
why we're not talking about in-  
tegrating Indian women or Cam-  
bodian women. Just as slavery  
was a property relation, & seg-  
regation a property relation,  
so is integration a property  
relation at a higher historical  
point.  

Integration presupposes  
something—dis-integration.  
That's the hidden thing no  
one's talking about. If you're  
integrating two things then at  
least one thing has to go, has  
got to give way & dis-inte-  
grate, the captured into the  
captors. So integration means  
someone's got to move, prac-  
tically speaking. That's
