Protesters at the house laughed  
at government claims that it was  
only a coincidence. A V.A. officer  
told the press: "This does not nec-  
essarily make a precedent, as far  
as we're concerned." Morning Sunday,  
who had visited the two sisters on  
Fulton Ave. daily to show her sup-  
port, was jubilant.  

"I think the homeless are no lon-  
ger willing to be shuffled from  
shelter to shelter. They are start—  
ing to fight back—and isn't that  
American?”  

Unidentified family moves out of VA-owned row house  

As Mayor Ed has found out, the  
homeless are a time bomb. He thoug-  
ht surplus Blacks and Puerto Ricans  
would just go away and die off  
somewhere. Now his Wall St. friends  
are telling him he's got to get  
homeless African Americans out of  
their faces. The city is trying to  
place distant reservations (called  
shelters) in the outer boroughs,  
just as Indians were isolated by  
being moved to remote reservations.  

In Washington DC the government is  
even more uptight, since the rising  
number of African American homeless  
are within bomb's throw of the  
Capitol AND White House. DC Mayor  
Marion Barry Jr. told Congress last  
year that 40,000 African American  
squatters had illegally crashed  
into apartments in the projects,  
refusing to pay rent and ignoring  
orders to leave. Barry has promised  
to evict them all, like a man.  

In the spirit of Morning Sunday  
and all fighting African American  
women, I have a piece of information  
to share. The Black Nation owns  
enough territory here in NYC to live  
on and support them. No, I'm not  
even talking about Harlem. African—  
Americans owned and own—with deeds  
and all that paper—big chunks of  

midtown and lower Manhattan. Under  
the Dutch colony (in the 1600s when  
NYC was called New Amsterdam), free  
African farmers owned the land now  
called Herald Square, Greenwich  
Village, and Astor Place. In 1664  
the conquering British seized all  
this African property without com-  

pensation (but not the Dutch prop-  
erty).  

So why shouldn't African Americans  
get their property back now? Gimbels  
is vacant, so lots of families could  
move in. Macy's already is packed  
with lots of clothing and furniture  
they could use. Maybe New York  
University and Cooper Union could start  
paying rent to the Black Nation?  
Maybe the first African American  
Women's University could start there—  
just take over a few blocks. This  
is billions of dollars worth of  
prime land we're talking about.  

Homelessness and wealth is merely  
a question of who's the oppressed  
and who's the oppressor. I can see  
why African American revolutionary  
nationalists want to secede from  
Amerikkka, to free their own Nation  
in the deep south (the states that  
African slaves built with centuries  
of forced labor). White people, if  
they think about such things at all,  
think they're too "far out" and un-  
realistic. But African American  
women dying of homelessness in Penn  
Station, while thousands of well-  
dressed white commuters rush past  
them to catch the suburban train,  
that's not far out? Or your movie  
actor president flying missiles and  

a birthday cake to an equally perv-  

old man in Iran, that's not far out?  
The future always looks far out  
from the past.  

African American women are going  
to fight. Always have, always will.  
A closer question is what we're go-  
ing to do? White women are into  
genocide. Can't avoid it, can't  
stay uninvolved somewhere else on  
an offshore sidelines that don't  
exist. Hey, it's easy to criticize  
Mayor Ed. "We should have more  
shelters." "There should be more  
public housing in other neighbor-  
hoods." But Crazy Ed is only cook—  
ing the meal you wanna eat. Every  
time African American and Puerto  
Rican communities are driven out  
into the streets, white women are  
right there side-by-side with "our"  
men copping that housing.  

We all know that when the banks  
want to genocide out a neighborhood  
they first send in the “urban pio-  
neers." Young white women, gay men,  
students, lesbians, artists, are  
the first in, the beachhead. We all  

know it, even joke about it:  

"Gentrification is the next person  
who moves in after you."  

Then as the turf turns white it  
gets too expensive and they get  
sent on to the next urban beachhead.  
Chelsea, Upper West Side, Lower East  
Side, Boerum Hill, Fort Greene, etc.  
Don't fight the ruling class for  
housing, get yours by helping them  
create homelessness. Maybe that  
tired, desperate-looking woman at  
the Martinique used to live where  
you now live. Ratty as it may be,  
you've gotten your little bribe to  

go along with genocide. "Sisters."  

Ever think what happened to ever-  

ything the Jews and communists and  

gays and gypsies had to leave be-  

hind when that impossible thing  

happened to them? Apartments and  
jobs and dining room tables and...  
a sea of possessions. Good Germans  
took those jobs; moved into those  
apartments, grabbed everything of  
value, tried on everything left be-  
hind. Filled the vacuum. "It's too  
bad, but somebody will get it, why  
not me?" each said. If we don't  
fight genocide, we bear personal  
responsibility for it. Stop taking  
part in homelessness. Leave the  
"family of man."  

sunday update  

FRIDAY MARCH 6: Morning Sunday was  
arrested and sent to jail. The city  
had tried to get her to leave by  
offering her another city-owned  
building, plus help getting financ-  
ing to fix it up. Ms. Sunday refused,  
as a matter of principle. City off-  
icials, she said, "are saying that  
this building is just 'too good' for  
the poor people who live in this  
neighborhood, and that's not right."  
Evicted by police on the previous  
Friday, Feb. 28th, Ms. Sunday came  
back and removed the boards that the  
city had nailed over the front door,  
knowing she would be arrested.  

Out of jail, Morning Sunday is at  
this time living in the Murphy Homes  
projects. She says that her fight is  
not just for a place to live, but  
to stop the city from stealing an  
entire African American neighborhood  
so that middle-class whites can have  
more space. Already, Ms. Sunday  
observes, the city is "warehousing"  
254 of the Franklin Square area,  
fronting for the developers. She  
notes that the city N.P.A. agency  
is headed by a woman. Morning  
Sunday also reports that "so-called  
revolutionaries" visited her during  
the house occupation, promised her  
support and then split. Now, she  
says, they tell her that they'd like  
to visit her but are afraid to  
come into Murphy Homes.
