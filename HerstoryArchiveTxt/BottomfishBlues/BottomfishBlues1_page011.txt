The Dark Side of Man of the Year  
Boys Club Director — Sex Charges  

By Ellis Henican  

In many respects, John German was  
very good to the boys he is now ac-  
cused of molesting.  

Listen to what two of them had to  
say just before Christmas in 1986,  
when German, executive director of  
the Flushing Boys Club in Queens,  
was named Rotary Club Man of the  
Year:  

“John is like a father to me, ‘cause I  
don’t have one. Without him, I  
wouldn’t be as smart as I am now. He  
puts a lot of effort into all he does for  
me. It’s great to have a friend like  
John.”  

That comes from a gap-toothed  
youngster from Bushwick, Brooklyn,  
one of German’s “little brothers.”  

German pleaded guilty last month  
in federal court to taking the boy, now  
15, on a Mexican holiday “for an il-  
legal sexual purpose.” He was indicted  
last Wednesday on related state  
charges.  

Here’s what another of German’s  
“little brothers” said back in 1985.  
German met him at the Rova Club in  
J The two boys are among his accus-  
ers. They claim that on dozens of occa-  
sions, German convinced them to join  
him in a plethora of sexual acts. “He  
seems genuinely to have enjoyed the  
company of children,” said Assistant  
U.S. Attorney Valerie Caproni, who  
was assigned to prosecute German on  
related federal charges. “The boys mo-

attacks from any number of larger  
men at any time. That's a ninja-  
superfem type trickbag, designed to  
make most of us feel helpless and  
inadequate. Women can never be safe  
in this society. It's the system  
that's the problem.  

We need a political army to take  
back the night 365 nights a year—  
not just one. Self-defense is not  
the answer. No one tells the south

About 50 people gathered outside the Somerville courthouse Oct. 7 to protest

Martial laws as a program can never  
free us, although it has its uses.  
I'm a 50-year-old woman, and even  
though I do a physical job and am  
used to taking care of myself on  
the street, I'm never going to beat  
up a young, fast man. The self—  
defense thing isolates us. A poli-  
tical army makes use of every  
woman's ability, young and old  
alike. We need to depend on our-  
selves in a new way.  

There are countless places to  

die... . Stants. We need a national registry —  

of missing women—our MIAs. Women  
don't want to face it but this is a  
mass problem. Without expecting it  
our MIAs flash through our aware-  
ness at odd moments. This fall I  
was reading a travel article about  
day hikes in California's Los  
Padres National Forest. Matter-of-  
factly the male author notes that  
at the edge of the trail into the  
wilderness:  

" ..a notice board is posted  

with desultory signs and messages.  
There is a picnic table, a water  
tank, and a ranger's tiny mobile  
home. There is no sign of a ranger.  
We park and walk to the notice  
board to ascertain our next move. A  
poster, long faded, its edges curl-  
ing: MISSING. HAVE YOU SEEN THIS  
WOMAN? A girl's face stares out at  
us, smiling. She was a botany  
student, last seen a year ago..."  

We are so CONDITIONED that we  

applaud the Mothers of the Plaza de  
Mayo, the Argentine women who  
wouldn't let the military junta  
cover up the "disappeared" youths  
killed by death squads—but we for-  
get that this is us. We forget our  
own "disappeared," the thousands of  
our sisters abducted and killed by  
male death squads. Our "disappeared"  
are unidentified Jane Does forgotten  
in city morgues, unidentified  
remains found in parks and wilder-  
ness areas. Where are our Sisters  

of the Plaza?
