AMERICA'S AMERIKA;

AMERIK

The original Americas didn't even
have that name. They had Indian
names and were made up of one hun-
dred million people in many nations
and tribes. They didn't have T.V.
and maxi series. There was not a
hero chief played by Kris Kristof-
ferson, with the Anglo-Saxon name
of Devin Milford. There were
leaders with names like Tecumseh,
among others.

The indigenous peoples were in-
vaded by Europeans from across the
seas looking for land to steal and
people to enslave. I think by
butchers with names like Milford
and maybe Kristofferson, not

Russian names like "Andrei Denisov."

No one has yet portrayed the
Indian sisters in these native
societies as screwing their way up
the social ladder or jumping like
greedy frogs into the beds of the
invaders.

In A.B.C.'s “Amerika” the in-

this invasion is, unlike the first,
a major social tragedy which must
be rectified. How this invasion was
accomplished is also not explained.
At any rate the blame is placed
where it must belong. At one point,
hero Milford, in explaining why
his country got so weak, says
"Amerikans have allowed themselves
to become immobilized by their own
selfish concerns." These bad con-
cerns, Milford goes on, include
“minority” issues (spelled
B-L-A-C-K) and "women against

men." Black rebellion and Women's
Liberation lead to the inner
collapse of Amerika. Sounds almost
too good to be true. It is.

Ten years after the Russian in- (%

vasion Devin Milford, a Kennedy-
type presidential candidate, comes
home from a six year bit in a

commie prison camp to lead a rebel-
lion. Of course, all he sees

around him are the wimpish heroes
and half-witted sluts. Devin Mil-
ford's evil ex-wife Marion (played
by Wendy Hughes) screwed her way up
the Russian ranks 'til she struck

it rich with an equally evil Russian
general. Milford's sister Aletha
(Christine Lahti) is an alcoholic
slut doing the bidding of a sadistic
East German. Then there is the

usual dumb blonde actress Kimberly
Ballard (played by Mariel Heming-
way), mistress of suave KGB Colonel

Andrei Denisov.

I guess I am supposed to get riled
up at this obvious right-wing de-
grading portrait of Amerikkkan
women. But I can't quite get to it.
What I mostly feel is, what's new?
Aren't we supposed to go to bed
with the winner? Isn't that what
we are trained for? If you are a
woman in Amerikkka and you want
power—marry it. If you want the
goodies of privilege put yourself
in one grotesque posture or another.
How are the fictional fems in
"Amerika" that different than say,

cont. Over

We need a national campaign for
women MIA-POWs—the real missing in
action. For all these sisters
fallen due to men's war against us.
And surely we must "fight like
hell, for the living," to celebrate
and defend our POWs. Our prisoners
who are imprisoned because they
killed an oppressor (which is no
crime to us) or because they
decided to do revolutionary
violence against this wretched
system.

To have an Amazon army we have to
have Amazon honesty. We have to
fight for this honesty. Even at its
height—the women's movement never
raised this question of the war

against women in a political way,
and never had a program to deal
with it. Take Back The Night isn't
a program, it's a once-a-year
slogan by women who don't intend to
do it. Women still want to run to
men, still mourn their sons but not
their daughters.

We have to build in the cracks
and crevices for now. We're not
ready for a guerrilla army, al-
though it's coming. Amerikkka still
looks normal but everyone knows it
isn't, though it's still coasting
downhill on all its wealth. This
empire is falling apart. Lots of
people are beginning to think be-

yond Amerikkka, to leave it in
their minds. People don't pay
taxes or go to the police or obey
any laws—and that's more and more

people—they're starting to leave
Amerikkka. That's true for some
right-wing men as well as revolu-
tionary women. Either go with "our
men into trying to hold onto the
past, or leave the white patriarchy
and go with the circle of women. I
believe that women today can begin
to build something different, some-
thing the world has never seen
before but that we've always ached
for. Think about leaving Amerikkka
behind.
